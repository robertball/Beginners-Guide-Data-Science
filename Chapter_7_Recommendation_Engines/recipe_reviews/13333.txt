I've used this recipe every winter since I found the posting. 
Jaime's recipe is terrific & I've made several changes which make it more appealing to my family.
 I omit green beans & replace them with cannellini beans along with the Red kidney beans. 
 I use lots of fresh spinach and cabbage if I have it.
 Ditalini is our favorite soup pasta, it hold up better than shells.
 We like lots of veggies so I didn't decrease any amounts of carrots, zucchini or celery.
 The first stage of sauteing the aromatic veggies is so important. It is the basis for a terrific soup.
 Thank you, Jaime! This is comfort food at its best.

Fabulous recipe!  I did some substitutions though:  I used potatoes instead of zucchini, and I added white wine instead of red.  I also used italian-crushed tomatoes and only one small can of tomato sauce.  This is a great recipe that can easily be modified to suit both your tastes and whatever you have in the cupboard.  Husband loved it!

I absolutely love soup and read all the great reviews for this soup. It defintely didn't let me down. I did make some minor alterations based on the reviews. I used 5 cloves of garlic, 8 cups of chicken broth (instead of water), and 3/4 cup red wine, and the whole bag of baby spinach. I didn't add the kidney beans until the last 10 minutes so they wouldn't fall apart. I cooked the pasta separately and then added it. I used more then a half a cup because I like to see the pasta in my soup. It was a very thick soup even with the addition of all that chicken broth. I cooked it for about 1 hour give or take a little bit. I did think that addition of the parmesan cheese gave the soup great taste. I highly recommend this soup. All the great reviews are right, this soup is great.

This was the best soup I have ever made!  I did make a few changes.  First of all, I omitted the celery.  I used 5 cans of chicken broth, 2 cans of tomato paste, 1 can of tomato juice and 1 can of V8. Even with this much liquid I still needed to add the 2 cups of water. I used all fresh vegetables.  I substituted a squash for one of the zucchini.  I also added 1 cup shredded cabbage and 3 red potatoes.  Instead of the seashell pasta I choice Ditalini because I prefer a smaller pasta.  I did not have fresh basil or oregano on hand so I used Italian seasoning.  I cooked it for 2 hours adding the potatoes and pasta in the last 20 minutes.  This does make a ton of soup so you could freeze half and save it for another night.

What a fantastic soup!  And yes, it does make a *ton*.  I cut the recipe in half, and still had a very large pot of soup.  I've never been able to resist meddling, so I also cut down the amount of celery, used yellow squash and zucchini both, white beans instead of kidney beans, and ditalini pasta instead of shells.  Fresh basil and rosemary added wonderful flavor, this is the perfect vegetable soup.  I also added a few drops of lemon juice while it simmered, to freshen the flavors a little.  Thank you Jamie!

This really is a GREAT recipe.  I made it for after Christmas when we didn't need any more calories.  I made my noodles (mini - egg bow ties) in a seperate pot and added them per individual, topped off with a small amount of fresh parmesan cheese.  I didn't add the spinach, and I did use 1- 14 oz. can - Italian diced tomatoes, and only 1 -8oz. can of tomato sauce, frozen green beans, and 3 cups 98% fat free chicken broth, 1 cup of water, and only FRESH herbs. Served with homemade fresh bread! EXCELLENT!!  I also made it ahead of time so it reduced time in the kitchen during the holidays.

This was great.  I did things slightly different. I used all broth not 1/2 broth 1/2 water.  And I used crushed tomatoes instead of the sauce.  The zucchini this time of year was really expensive, so I used a frozen veggie mix that had squash, zucchini, green beans and red peppers.  This worked perfectly.  Thanks for the great post.

This was fantastic! I changed a few things here and there just because of what I had on hand.  I used canned cannelli beans rather than kidney beans.  I used a mixture of chicken broth and vegetable broth, replaced some of the tomato sauce with diced tomato. I added a squash in lieu of 2 of the zucchini and I added some red pepper flakes that gave it a bit of a bite.

My entire family enjoyed it and I have some in the freezer for cold winter nights.

Thanks for sharing this Jamie!

If using tomato sauce it is more a tomato soup with vegetables than minestrone soup.  I replaced a 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce with water and used fresh green beans, adding another 1/2 cup water because the canned beans were undrained.  Three zucchini was a lot to add, switching to 1 zucchini and other family favorite vegetables recommended (corn adds color variation).  If the broth is too acidic or tangy after 10 minutes of simmering add an 1/8 tsp. baking soda to cut it.

This is my second time reviewing this recipe...and this time I made it RIGHT!!  Don't add any meat or extra veggies like I did the first time, you won't have enough liquid.  This recipe is perfect just as it is.  It really is classic...and now that I've learned to just leave the recipe ALONE I absolutely love it.  It is a real treat, and pretty cheap and easy to make.  It's fun to have fresh bread and red wine with it, too.

I absolutely LOVED this soup. My husband went on and on about how good it was. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use double the broth omitting the water. I also used a can of diced tomatoes in addition to the sauce. I threw in some Okra, Bell Pepper and white corn as well. There was quite a bit of chopping to be done, I used canned carrots tocut down a little. Wonderful, healthy, taste good soup!

This soup really is fantastic! I was craving a hearty vegtable soup, one that I could make during the day, and serve my family for dinner. This is it! The vegtables were all cooked perfectly, and you can really tweak it for your own taste. I added pasta the meatballs (premade) to my husbands dinner, but I just enjoy the soup itself. Some changes I made- I had no fresh herbs on hand, so I used all dried, an "italin" blend, and some additional parsely and bay leaf. I also added a few grinds of lemon pepper. I used carrots, celery (stalks and leaves) canned kidney beans, white beans, and canned green beans. I didn't have any zuchinni, so I cut 3 small potatoes and used those (with skins). I used one can of beef broth and one can of chicken, instead of water( forgot the wine too!). All low sodium... I think that any changes you make will be great! The base recipe is wonderful also, but we made do with what was on hand. For a final touch, I splashed in some worshirtire sauce. Probably not typical, but it gives the soup a richness and brings everything together.


Few quick tips- saute the onions, then add the garlic. Onions need more time to soften, and garlic burns rather quickly. And chopping all those veggies really doesn't take more than 5 mins tops. I saw a few complaints about that-what do you expect? Fresh food takes alitte work!

Amazing soup!  I made very few adjustments in ingredients to match my personal taste.  This one's definitely a make again - Bravo Jamie!

I just want to point out that because so many canned ingredients are being used here, a serving of this soup and a can (which is regarded as approximately 2 servings) of Progresso Minestrone soup are not too far off.  True, making it at home allows us to include a lot more vegetables than the canned soup, but let's not fall under the illusion that this version of Minestrone is so much healthier than we can find in a can.

Calories:
Serving of Jamie's soup - 232
Can of Progresso - 220

Total Fat:
Serving of Jamie's soup - 8.3g
Can of Progresso - 4g

Saturated Fat:
Serving of Jamie's soup - 1.4g
Can of Progresso - 1g

Sodium:

Carbs:
Serving of Jamie's soup - 32.1g
Can of Progresso - 38g

Sugars:
Serving of Jamie's soup - 12.1g
Can of Progresso - 4g

I'm still a fan of this recipe, and I think that the benefits of having the chunky fresh vegetables in the soup outweigh the higher sugar and fat content by a longshot, but some people on restrictive diets may not agree.

I am not much of a vegetarian meal lover and unfortunately I thought I could improve this recipe by adding some ground beef.  WRONG!  The soup was great until I ruined it.  Don't make the same mistake, make it as is and you will be very happy.

This is a great recipe! The first time I made this, I gave it 3 stars because the oregano taste was too strong-MY FAULT!!! It turns out that 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs is the same as 1 teaspoon dried herbs!!! I'm so glad I figured it out, since this is so yummy and healthy!

O.K. this is the second time I made this and I love it.  The first time I made it almost at written and it was really good.  But this time I changed some things as per reviews and my own thing.  I added about of pound of Turkey Italian Sausage (hot) did half tomato sauce and half Italian style diced tomatoes.  And double the amount of garlic (just my thing) anyway it is wonderful.  Thank you for the post.

This soup was really good.  I did use all broth and no water as well.  I used regular spinach vs baby spinach (as it was half the cost).  I just chopped it up smaller, and it worked just fine.  I would definately recommend cooking the pasta separately just before serving.  I cooked mine separately, but added it to the soup a few hours before serving, and it soaked up a lot of the juice.  I think doing as the recipes says would work much better.

I was pleasantly surprised with this one!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I did choose to omit celery (hate it), use frozen green beans in lieu of canned, and use all chicken broth rather than some water.  This came together fairly quickly and easily and made for a great lunch on an icy winter day.  I was being lazy (and had planned to freeze some soup) so I chose to use ancient de peep for pasta and simply added it towards the end of simmering.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will add another can of kidney beans and perhaps another bean for a little more texture and protein.  Thanks, Jamie, for a "keeper"!

This soup is hearty and delicious! No changes necessary... just follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed. My husband didn't even miss the meat in this one and he's usually not too fond of meatless dinners! This one's in my archives to stay! Will make it again and again!

This was a hit at work. I added the rind from a brick of Parmigianno Regiano and it added wonderful depth to this hearty soup. I also added a quart of homemade chicken broth instead of canned. I omitted all but 1 cup of the  tomato sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes. Really even better the next day. also I through it all in a crockpot , really easy.

Excellent!  Even my hubby (who thinks that soup is an appetizer and not a meal) LOVED IT! After reading some of the reviews, I did make a few minor changes to the recipe.  I used fresh green beans (instead of canned), added in 1 cup of shredded cabage, usded 6 cups of broth and 1 cup of water, no salt added tomato sauce, dried herbs instead of fresh, and 1 cup of uncooked ditalini (cooked separately).  I cooked the soup for about 3 hours on low.  This made an enormous amount of soup, which I divided into individual portions and put in the freezer for easy lunches.  YUMMO!

This soup turned out fantastic. Here are my modifications:

1. I did not put in the can of green beans.
2. For convenience sake, I used 1 29 oz. can of tomato sauce, 2 14 oz. cans of chicken broth, and 1 cup of water instead of the amounts listed. 
3. At the very end, I felt like it was missing something, so I added a bit of cayenne pepper. That made a huge difference!

This is a really hearty, delicious soup. I would like to have a bit more broth next time, so I'm going to increase the liquids when I make this soup again. My entire family loved this recipe!

Good foundational recipe that can be customized per individual tastes.  I increase the garlic and use a mixture of dried herbs because I rarely have fresh on hand.  Also, I use canned stewed tomatoes (broken into small pieces--with the liquid) and a few tablespoons of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and use only broth instead of water and broth (also works well with a combination of chicken and beef broth).  For my taste, this does need some added salt, but that's just me.  Enjoy!

Very good basic minestrone. I tweaked it a little on recommendation from a friend that the water made it a tad bland. Subbed 6 cups of tomato juice for the 2 cups water and 4 cups tomato sauce. Perfect. Served with a loaf of hot and fresh home Italian bread for a big family lunch get-together. EVeryone loved it. :-)

I got 2# of zucchini in my CSA delivery this week, so was looking for recipes to use it in when I came across this one.  I started with about a pound of sweet italian sausage; after browning and draining the oil, I continued pretty much with the recipe, with only the following changes:  probably a bit more zucchini (so I didn't have to save a portion of one), doubled the broth, added a pinch of red pepper flakes, used kale instead of spinach (also from this week's delivery), used the full can of beans, so probably 1 1/2 c.,  and dried herbs instead of the fresh.  Oh - no wine (forgot!).  I liked the idea of cooking the pasta separately, as we have lots of soup left over, and I know how pasta absorbs most of the liquid.  I let people grate their own parmesan.  (I am sure that this would be great without the sausage - it was a request of my husband, and it really did turn out good.  Everyone at the table gave it 2 thumbs up!)  Thanks for a great starting point.

This is fantastic--good for using up all the squash, green beans and good stuff from the garden. I used kidney and white beans, fresh veg instead of canned, crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and I just dropped the raw pasta in during last 15 minutes of cooking.  Fantastic!

This was an excellent dinner on a chilly fall night!  I made it following the directions, but added some things like baby red potatoes and squash (1/2 the zuccini)  I also added some mushrooms that went well with the wine.  I added more chicken stock than called for, because I had more veggies.  I served it with warm bread and it was a hit.  This recipes will def. go in my books as a regular!

I have an afterschool cooking class with a few 5th graders and we made this soup.  It was a hit!  We made as directed (except for the red wine!).  It made more than we could eat so we shared it with other teachers.  Everyone who tried it asked for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Very good! I find that the liquids are a bit off since I always have to add more but otherwise it is fantastic.  I do not use any water I use all broth. Made with chicken and beef broth and both times it was great.

This soup is really good! A couple changes - definitely add at least one can of garbanzo beans (balances the "bite" of the wine/spinach); Saute the carrot/onion/celery mixture until the carrots are soft (mine stayed too firm for a couple days); Add the beans during last 20 minutes to prevent mushiness. I found that I needed more liquid, so I tossed in a very small can of tomato sauce and some sugar, as well as an additional 2 c. of chicken stock and another 1/4 c. of wine. I will make this all the time!

This soup is OUTSTANDING!! I followed others' suggestions to substitute diced tomatoes for part of the tomato sauce and added the kidney beans toward the end. I added more red wine than the recipe indicates -- don't know what difference that made. Definitely cook the pasta separately  and spoon soup over it to serve. I simmered for about 2 1/2 hours. I will make this over and over again -- we loved it!
P.S. On making a second time, I added shredded cooked chicken breasts (3 medium sized breasts) -- made it a bit heartier, same delicious, satisfying flavors.

This is good soup!  It makes a ton.  Full of vegetables.  I didn't put spinich in because I hate cooked spinich.  I also put garbanzo beans and a can of corn in.  I saute'ed the garlic, onion, carrots and celery in a pot first then transferred everything to the crock pot.  Cooked it for 5 hours on high and it turned out perfectly.  Great soup!

Fantastic soup and also a great way of using any left over veggies you may have in the fridge. Zucchini is a nice addition as well as mini meatballs. Good job Jamie!

This is one of the best soups I have made and believe me I have made many.  The only change I made was to use beef broth (personnel preference) and add more water as we like a brothy soup.  I also used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  This gave the soup a slightly sweet taste which my husband loved. Also substituted garbanzo beans for the green beans (again personnel preference).  This made a ton of soup, enough for my huband's lunch and also enough for another meal or two.  Thank you so much Jaime.

This soup tasted great however I docked 1 star because cooking those vegetables in the soup for so long took away the vibrant color and made them rather soft. I would say simmer the soup for less time and then add the veggies during the last 10 minutes.

Absolutely fantastic!  I added extra garlic, was heavy on the herbs and pepper.  Thought the red wine added a nice touch --- I wouldn't leave it out!  I used whole wheat penne -- I like the nuttiness and density of the pasta, it holds up quite well in this soup.

This was fabulous. Seriously delicious. The only change I made was adding about 1 TBSP white sugar to the mix, since all the tomato action makes it a bit acidic. The sugar takes the edge off of that, and made it even better.

This soup is a delicious 5 star recipe with a few changes, some at others suggestions. I used 5 cloves of garlic (this recipe makes a lot of soup!), all chicken broth instead of water, one can italian diced tomatoes & one can tomato sauce. I didn't use wine b/c I didn't have it and didn't use basil, but did use the fresh orgeano. I'm sure it's even better with them. I will add more pasta and more broth next time. I had so many delicious veggies and not enough liquid...but it was SO good. My husband loved it. Lots of leftovers to freeze. This is a keeper!

This soup was wonderful!  It took a while to chop up all of the veggies, but was worth the effort.  I substituted star shaped pasta to appeal to my 2 and 4 year old.  It must have worked b/c they each had 2 bowls!  I wish I would have thought ahead and made some crusty bread to go with it.

This soup was wonderful!  I changed two things... I used a can of San Marzano tomatoes instead of sauce (gave it a fresher, richer flavor) and used kale instead of spinach (I don't care for wilted spinach).  Great idea to add the pasta in the individual bowls instead of the whole pot of soup.  It keeps it from swelling that way.

Been making this for years. Superb. I'm happy to see so many new reviews and fans. I'm about to break a 21 day Master Cleanse using this soup, but omitting the beans, pasta and cheese. I like the idea of adding more veggies.

I never use water, I increase the chicken broth to 4 cups and it comes out divine.

Very good! My changes: used 4 cups chicken stock instead of half stock/half water. I also used a 28 oz can of San Marzano crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Great, fresh flavor and hearty too.

Wonderful recipe! I upped the broth to 3 cups and cooked the pasta in the soup. Also used 2 cups tomato sauce plus 1 can petite diced tomatoes instead of 4 c sauce. I only had 2 zucchini and that was plenty. Served with french bread and merlot. A great meal!

So, so, SOOO good! I made minor changes after reading the reviews. Used all chicken broth instead of water and substituted petite diced tomatoes for some of the tomato sauce. Absolutely wonderful! Served it with a loaf of crusty French bread.

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted more chicken broth for the red wine.  I let the soup simmer for 3 hours.  Everyone loved it.  So tasty and so healthy!

I am not really a tomato based soup eater, but I LOVE this recipe!  The only addition I make is adding 1 lb. of browned and seasoned ground beef.  I make 3 or 4 batches at a time, cool and freeze them in gallon sized zip loc bags.  When I need a quick meal I thaw it out and heat it up.  So yummy!  My whole family likes it too.  Which is a hard one to find with 3 kids 7 and younger.

Wonderful! Instead of pasta I added cheese tortellini that I pre-cooked. It was hearty and satisfying for the whole family.

Wow...this soup is soooo good. I sampled some after 40 minutes of simmering and it is fabulous. I can only imagine how wonderful it will be tomorrow! It is always better the next day!

I too ommitted the water and used 4 cups of chicken broth. I did not use green beans but a can each of cannelini and garbanzo beans as well as the kidney beans. I also tossed in a can of diced potatoes.

I used more vegetables than the recipe called for but I love hearty soup. I also used merlot wine (not cooking wine) and not only did my kitchen smell fabulous, the soup is wonderful. You really can add any veggies you like.

I don't eat meat but my family does so I will be adding italian sausage to theres. I need not look any further for a good minestrone soup recipe.

I made this for the first time tonight and followed the recipe word for word. This was by far and away the best minestrone I have ever had. Next time I make it I make half the amount and will play with the ingredients a little bit, but two thumbs up as is.

Very good for a using all canned goods and extremely easy to put together.  Added some diced tomatoes too and skipped the pasta all together.    There are closer to 12 servings than 8.  Thanks for the recipe.

oh my goodness this is so good. My children love this so much too. I added the pasta to the soup instead of cooking seperately. We make this almost every week. Its great for when the "men" of the house are hungry, and so healthy too.

The recipe listed here is awesome. I have been looking for a good vegetable soup recipe for a long time. I don't like a strong tomato base, so I only used one can of tomato sauce and instead of water, I used chicken soup for the whole recipe. I freeze individual servings so I can have great lunch in a rush.

Outstanding!!!! Just a great tasting minestrone soup.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, a can of white beans and an extra can of broth, and used fresh green beans.  Wonderful flavor.

This recipe was all it was chalked up to be and then some!  Per other user's suggestions, I added additional chicken broth, water and a touch more tomato sauce so it wasn't as chunky.  A little time consuming to cut up the veggies, but it made 10 servings and freezes very well.  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

This soup was incredible. I was looking for a soup to make on Halloween after trick-or-treating. I have never been too crazy about minestrone, but I had to try this one after seeing the ratings and reviews. I am so glad that I did! My husband, in-laws and even my 2 year old absolutely loved this minestrone soup! I took some of the advice from other reviews - added a little more red wine, used a can of diced tomatoes, put the beans in later in the cooking time, and served sweet italian sausage on the side (I cooked it separately, sliced it, put it on the soup after ladling it into the bowls, and then topped it with parmesan cheese). It does make a lot, but the leftovers are just as wonderful if not better the next day!

Sorry but a 1 star for me!
I made mine exactly to the recipe, using tomato sauce.
Well what is tomato sauce (im british) i added what we call tomato sauce (what you put on your fish and chips on a friday night) its full of vinegar sugar salt etc.
Im guessing i used the wrong one as my soup tasted rank!

I think there needs to be some clarity on this 'tomato sauce'

Very, very good!!  I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and substituted V-8 juice for half of the tomato sauce.  It's a thick soup but it is delicious.

Very good soup... I used a little more broth. Also omitted the all the oil.. there's no need for it and it just adds fat. I sauted the onions and celery in broth. Instead on boiling the liquids I put all the ingredients in a crock pot for the day, turned out great. Thanks Jamie!

Best soup I've ever made, and soup is my specialty! It was so good I finally got over it being sad it was still soup weather in May. I did this to make it vegetarian, healthier & richer: Skip the chicken broth, add one can of garbanzo beans, 2 cups cooked quinoa, and 1.5 cups cooked red lentils. I did NOT add pasta. It didn't need it and it would have made the whole process more complicated and harder to store. I also just added some tomato paste (1/3 cup of so) instead of tomato sauce to save money.
I felt amazing after eating it! (Full disclosure I finished the whole pot in 48 hours).

YUM! Just made this soup for lunch. I have been craving some good soup for days, but haven't had the energy to make it as I have not been feeling well. What is it about being sick that makes us crave soup? Comfort that's what and the canned stuff just doesn't do it for me. Anyhow, I decided that my craving for soup outweighed my not feeling well and got up and made it. It wasn't alot of work at all, totaly worth it! I cut the recipe in half as other reviewers went on about how much it makes. Glad I did as there is just my hubby and myself. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only things I changed was to add a can of diced tomatoes with liquid, used half zuchinni and half yellow squash, used frozen italian green beans, and I added 1/2 t of ceyenne pepper to open up my stuffy head.  I also used pam instead of olive oil to cut the fat. This soup is wonderful, thick hearty and brimming with fresh veggies. The ceyenne was a nice touch and did open up my head. My picky hubby even liked it despite the fact that he doesn't like spinach or squash ;)
Would be great served with salad and crusty bread too!

I made this last night for dinner and loved it! The only change I made was I used white vs red wine since that's what was available.  I would say the cook time should be longer because the zucchini was a bit crunchy, so I will make sure I cook it longer next time. Great recipe!

This soup is fantastic! You have to use a little effort to get all the veggies ready but it is worth it! I followed the recipe as follows, except I didn't use red wine. I let the soup simmer for 4 hours on the stove. It has a ton of flavor and heats up very well. My kids ate 2 helpings 2 nights in a row! It's a great way to get them to eat their veggies.

I followed the directions right on except that I did not have fresh basil/oregano so I used the dried spice-aisle kind. The 4 cups of tomato sauce overwhelmed all other flavors, it was all you could taste. The veggies and everything else were completely lost, it was like chunky acidy tomato soup or something. Tasted nothing like what Minestrone should taste like. It makes a huge amount too, it broke my heart to throw all that food away but it was unedible. I browsed another Minestrone recipe on this site (Minestrone Soup 1) and it uses 1 can stewed tomatoes and a 1 tbsp of tomato paste, that sounds much more sensible.

The only thing I changed with this recipe was I used all broth (4-5 cups), no water.
I also didn't have fresh herbs (with the exception of a few leaves of fresh basil, which I saved, minced and sprinkled on top when serving)... instead I used a heaping teaspoon of dried oregano and almost exactly 1 tablespoon of dried basil. Which seemed adequate in flavoring the soup nicely.
I only had 1 1/2 cups of tomato sauce, so I made up for the rest by chopping up 4 roma tomatoes that I had that needed using.
This was so good and made a whole lot of soup. After 5 people ate and 3 having seconds, there was still half a pot left!!! Can't wait for leftovers!

Really enjoyed this soup. Used 4 cups chicken broth and skipped the water. Also used combo of tomato sauce and stewed tomatoes. Skipped the zucchini and used kale instead of spinach. Really, really tasty.

This recipe is Great!!  My girls loved it, which says a lot!!  The only thing I didn't follow was I didn't use the red wine and I replaced the celery with green peppers (Only because I forgot to buy them).  Cant wait to make this for my husband...

Not as flavorful as hoped.  Used vegetable broth, added 2 bay leaves, and spinach/collard greens mix.  Left out green beans and added cannelini beans.

I made some changes and it turned out fantastic.  Substituted canned tomato sauce, kidney beans with no salt added and fresh green beans for the canned.  Added some "no salt" to give it a bit of salty flavour.  Brings sodium content down using 1tbsp parm cheese.  Now you can seconds or if your my husband 3rds and not feel guilty.

Love this recipe! I only made minor modifications--I used all chicken stock instead of water and subbed cannelloni beans for the green beans. I added a little more spinach than it called for and I put 1 c of uncooked pasta right into the soup. It is delicious! My kids love it too. Thanks for the great recipe

What a delicious, healthy and hearty soup! Made some slight changes -  I used a can of white kidney beans, omitted the green beans and spinach. The amount of vegetables can be adjusted to your liking. I only had one 398ml can of tomato sauce so I used that plus a 798ml can of diced tomatoes. I used 4 cups of water with 4 tsps of chicken bouillon and omitted the wine. I also added a heaping tbsp of white sugar to cut down on the tartness and added 1 tsp of hot pepper flakes. To make it even more hearty, I tossed in tortellini instead of the seashell pasta. I served with French bread. So delicious! This makes A LOT of soup. I'm sure it will freeze well though! Will make again!

This was really good.  I tried to make it a meal with salad and bread, but the family was still hungry afterwards.  I guess we just are not the vegetarian type and need meat at each dinner.

I really, really enjoyed this soup.  I have NEVER made a soup without having to tweak it...until now that is! I measuresd everything precisely (usually eyeball it)and the soup was perfect, the fresh basil is what gives it that real minestrone taste, just a little sweetness...mmm mmm.  And definitely don't forget to sprinkle the parm on top-it just brings out all those yummy flavours!  I'll be making this again for sure :D

I left out the zucchini and the seashell pasta.  But I added a can of corn and two diced potatoes.  I have to say that this the best!!  Because I added more vegetables it reminded me of vegetable soup.  The spices were just right for this.  I will be making this again and again!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe:)

AWESOME RECIPE!  Only change is that I double the broth, sub 1 can sauce for 1 can diced tomatos, and omit the spinach.  I make this every 2-3 weeks in bulk for my boyfriend and I.  We freeze the extra and it heats up again really nicely.

This is absolutely wonderful.  I did use all chicken broth (no water) and added about 1/2 C red wine as suggested.  I also used all fresh veggies w/ whole wheat noodles.  Wonderful!!

oh my gosh, this is the best minestrone I have had!  This sure beats the canned kind any day!  I made a few last minute adjustments. (I was going to make homemade chicken soup, but forgot to buy chicken!!  LOL)  I used 4 cups of beef broth, a lg. can of crushed tomoatoes, parsley flakes, thyme and garlic powder.  I also added one HUGE potato, omitted the zuchinni, and added a can of whole kernel corn.  Oh and it was a little too tomatoey for me, so I added a can of chicken broth (I was out of beef).  And it turned out GREAT!!  Thank you Jamie for a wonderful recipe to warm me up on these cold Wisconsin nights!!

What a fantastic minestrone!  This was wonderful.  I used fresh green beans and I did add a pound of lean stew beef, mainly because of the husband. Other than that I followed the recipe as shown. I can't get over what a delicious soup this was!

If you love vegetables, you will love this soup.  It is a great healthy comfort food.  I DEFINITELY recommend not combining the noodles with the vegetables before serving or when putting up the leftovers.  The pasta will absorb all the juice.  I served the soup over the pasta, but when I went to put the leftovers in the fridge, I mixed it all together in the same storage container.  Don't do this.  The pasta absorbs all the soup.
Thanks for a great recipe.

Luscious! So healthy! A complete meal in one pot. I chopped the veggies in my chopper. I cooked it longer than stated. I also added 3 new potatoes because my hubbie doesn’t think any meal is complete without potatoes. Also, as Justin Wilson used to say, this is a great soup to clean out the fridge! I didn’t have fresh herbs. That’s my next goal . . . to grow a herb garden (too expensive at the local mart). My chicken broth was roasted garlic. Thanks so much for sharing!!! As stated cook noodles only when you need them. This way you don't have soggy noodles (or noodles that soak up broth)mixed in as the last reviewer complained about.

I a lot of chopping to do, but this soup is very good.  I substituted potatoes instead of zuchinni.  I cut up the potatoes and boiled them for about 10 minutes and then added it to the soup. I don't think I will do this next time and just let it cook longer or in the crock pot.   I also just added the noddles right into the soup, without cooking them first.  The soup was a little thick because of the starch from the potatoes so next time I will add more water or chicken stock. Instead of using all tomato sauce I used i can of garlic and onion diced tomatoes.  Overall very good and healthy recipe.  Makes a ton!

This soup was so good - better than my favorite italian resteraunt I used 2 cans of chicken broth and the rest water to equal the four cups of liquid.  I also used one can of tomatoe sauce and one can of chopped tomatoes and used white northern beans instead of kidney beans - will definetly make this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe

This soup is superb!  I'll never go back to canned minestrone again!  To make it a bit simpler, I just added the cooked macaroni to the soup.  I love all the vegetables in this soup.

This is my all-time favorite soup recipe.  I love that I can use what I have at home.  I know traditional minestrone calls for seashell pasta but I don't have that on a regular basis, so when I'm craving this soup, I usually have macaroni noodles so I'll use those.  My boss in Nauvoo, IL liked this soup so much she started serving it at her restaurant.  Of course, I got to make it all the time!  It was fabulous!!!  Thanks for this recipe....Definitly a keeper!

Just polished off my second bowl. 5 Stars. The only thing I would do differently next time is increase the chicken broth by at least 1 cup, add more kidney beans and I used 4 cups (after blending) of fresh tomatoes.

This minestrone is awesome!!  I didn;t use any spinach because I didn;t have it on hand, but pretty much used everything else and it turned out awesome!  I used multi-colored shell pasta, which added some extra color to the soup.  Very good and I will be making it again, for sure!

This was AWESOME! Made this recipe for Christmas progressive supper with my in-laws. I received compliments! Here's the surprise...I made a double batch so had to use two dutch ovens. As usual, the hostess/cook is the last to serve up. I sat down feeling quite proud of my efforts and enjoying the compliments. Was I surprised when I took my first bite and MY SOUP WAS COLD! I had finished cooking early and turned down the burners to keep things warm. When I checked the soup, I only checked one pot. Most of my guests had dished up from the other pot and still loved it. LOL! I will defintely make this soup year round. Hot in winter and cold in summer! Very versatile. ;)

Everyone loves this soup, including my Picky About Things With No Meat husband.  The only changes I make are adding a can of white beans and using crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

I make about 15 different soups every winter and this is by far the BEST! I added chick peas and fire roasted tomatoes but left the recipe the same and it turned out delicious! The broth is perfect with the combination of the tomato sauce, garlic, basil and oregano! Brilliant! I ate it for breakfast! Double the pot, 8 servings is not enough.

Excellent minestrone that impressed my Italian husband.  A little too many veggies and not enough broth for my taste, so I will probably double the broth and tomarot sauce, but wonderful flavors.  I have frozen remainders for a good, quick hot meal later on.  Thanks, Jamie!

This soup came out good, but I didn't love it like my daughter did... Not something I would make again. BUT, I did put the pasta in with the soup and didn't cook it sperately as suggested. I would recommend following the directions so your mini shells don't get soggy....

This soup was easy and wonderful. I'm a high school student, and although it was a busy schoolnight, I went to Safeway and bought ingredients so I could eat this! I ended up adding canned spinach, and half tomato sauce/half diced canned tomato, and omitted carrots. I used organic vegetable stock. I forgot to buy pasta, so left it out, but the soup was hearty enough to make a fine dinner. My family loved it, even my mom who had a stomachache ate seconds! Next time, though, I'll add more green beans and spinach, cut down on zuchinni, and add more diced tomatoes instead of sauce. I'll leave out kidney beans until the last 10 minutes or so of cooking because my kidney beans were so mushed up that they were nowhere to be found.

This was unbelieveable!  Coming from an Italian family, I didn't want to bow down to my mother-in-law for her recipe, so I took the chance on Jamie and it was worth it!  I did have to add 2-3 cups extra chicken broth to give it more "soup" but it was hearty and I just happen to make it on a miserable, rainy day so everyone loved it even more!  I shared some with a friend & everyone freaked over it!  I will save this one forever maybe adding other veggies next time but it's just right the way it is!  Thanks!

I used red wine which gave this soup a nice deepth. Added an extra 2 cups water and threw the pasta directly in the soup. Cooking the pasta separately is an unnecessary step. The addition of wine should not be omitted!

I was very excited to try this recipe, but I knew I really didnt have the time to cut up all the veggies, so I went to the grocery store and bought all frozen ones...carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, Italian cut green beans, and spinach.  I also added quite a bit more chicken broth and a can of tomatos with Italin seasonings...other than that I followed the recipe on how to put it together...I used Alphabet noodles and the kids loved that!!!  I will make this recipe again!!!  It was so good and so easy!!!!

MMMmmmm... I love a good minestrone, this was just what I was looking for. Now, I thought I'd be all slick and dumped the uncooked pasta right into the soup. Not a good idea. The starch from the pasta thickened the soup so it was more like a stew. Won't do that next time!

This is a wonderful recipe for Minestrone!  I used my biggest pot, but it was almost overflowing!  The only changes I made were to use one very large sweeet onion, not two, and one zucchini.  I omitted the pasta because I served this with Italian Herb Bread I from this site, made into breadsticks.  I added a touch more spinach.  We will be enjoying the leftovers tomorrow!

This soup was really delicious. The entire recipe makes a lot of soup - I cut it in half and it made 6 servings. The other changes I made were: 1) twice the garlic, 2) a little less carrot (2 for a half recipe), 3) 1/4 c. wine for a half recipe,  4) I substitued dry for fresh herbs (make sure to adjust measurements - 1 tsp. dried oregano for 1 Tbsp. fresh, 1/2 Tbsp. dried basil for 1 Tbsp. fresh), 5) I left out the spinach, because I didn't have any, and the green beans, because I don't like them. I came out with a hearty, flavorful, and truly delicious soup that adds a lot to any meal! I highly recommend this recipe.

This soup is pretty good!  My family sure enjoyed it!  A few things to note, though, before you begin: 

1) Two things make this soup: the parmesan cheese and the flavor.  The parmesan adds a lot of unexpected taste to the whole picture, so do not skip over it.  Regarding the flavor, go ahead and simmer the collaboration for 1.5-2 hours minimum.  Then, throw it in the refrigerator overnight.  The flavors will pull through much better… trust me. 

2)Change of ingredients: I nixed the spinach, because I’m not a big fan, threw in a bunch of halved button mushrooms and about ½ cup of diced yellow pepper (sauté both of these in the very beginning with the onion).  Furthermore, grocery stores sell seasoned tomato sauce.  I used ½ “garlic and onion” tomato sauce and half regular to bump the recipe up a notch. 

3) Existing ingredients: Use only two zucchinis and I wouldn’t say more than two carrots, especially if you add the mushrooms above.  Otherwise you’ll lose the broth in a mass of vegetables.  Be generous with the oregano and basil.  And don’t be afraid of the wine - it adds a beautiful flavor. 

4) Possibilities: I considered adding Italian sausage to the recipe, but served those on the side (-*highly recommended*).  Shrimp might be interesting, though I haven’t tried it. 

Enjoy! You can have a lot of fun with this soup!

This does make lot, which I like a lot!  It freezes well and it's great to have on hand in the freezer.  I've made this a few times.  Yesterday, I followed the recipe exactly, give or take veggie amounts.  I had been using more chicken broth and less tomato sauce.  I find that using tomato sauce with the chicken broth in these amounts makes this soup more filling and satisfying as a complete meal.  Also, I see no need to saute veggies, or add olive oil (or salt) to this recipe. I've done it both ways and there was no difference in taste.  I love this soup, and the parmesean really seals it as a five star.  Thanks Jamie.

I did not like this recipe too much.  It was too tomatoey and lacked a freshness, probably because of the tomato sauce used.  There were also too many veggies I think.  Won't be making it again.

Terrific!  Of course, I couldn't leave well enough alone; I added 3 potatoes and 
cabbage, substituted 1 leek and 1 onion for the 2 onions, 2 yellow sqash for 
2 of the zucchini, and 1 can each crushed and diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  
It's hard to go wrong with this one.

This is the BEST minestrone that I've ever tasted!  I added spicy Italian sausage and this added the extra zip that my family LOVES!  We've been eating it for leftovers for a couple of days now and we're not even close to being sick of it!  A+

I was searching for a GREAT Minestrone recipe when I stumbled onto Jamie's version.  It had some different ingredients than others I'd looked at, the red wine and tomato sauce in particular, and I think it was these differences that made this soup so extraordinarily good.  As I've tried to move toward a more healthy and nutritious diet, I've often been disappointed at the lack of flavor in many "healthy" dishes, but this minestrone soup has more flavor than I thought possible.  Definitely worth the time to make, and I'll never crack open a CAN of Minestrone again.

My family and I LOVED this soup! I cut down the olive oil to 1 tablespoon. I also used all chicken broth for the liquid instead of half broth, half water. I served it with grilled Italian sausages (for those who wanted some meat with their meal) and garlic bread. Super healthy, hearty, and satisfying! :)

It was great.  The only thing I would change is to use fresh ingredients wherever you can.  I used fresh green beans and the flavor was better.  If you are trying to cut down on sodium (which is what the author stated she was trying to do), avoid the canned stuff, which has lots of salt in it.  If you must use canned beans, rinse them first so some of the excess sodium comes off.  Overall I did enjoy this.  I added fresh basil, fresh thyme.

This soup was delicious!!!  I made it with only a couple changes based on other reviews... I doubled the garlic, used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of water and added in an extra can of diced tomatoes along with the tomato sauce.  My family LOVED it, my husband along with my 2 year old and 4 year old all went back for seconds!!  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll definitely be using this one often!!

Absolutely AMAZING!! My husband and 12 year old will not eat: kidney beans, celery, tomatoes (unless puréed in spaghetti), spinach or zucchini and they LOVED this soup! Followed recipe with no changes, scooped out 1/2 for me and puréed the rest. Gave my boys the puréed version and I ate the chunky of course...my 12 year old said "WOW this is the best soup I've ever tasted!" husband said ditto. When my 12 year old got up to clear the table he gave me a hug and said "mom, thanks for taking all the vegetables out of mine and giving me just the broth." what a testament to how wonderful the flavors are in this soup! I thought the 3Tbls of herbs would be too much...not so! This is a must try! I added baby tortellini for my pasta as it was what I had on hand. Thanks Jaimie....my family all ate vegetables and loved them for the 1st time ever!

Wonderful and delicious -did everyone add the 4 cups tomato sauce? I didn't -used 2 cans tomatoes instead. It just seemed would be way too tomatoey with all that sauce.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! Easy to make, healthy, and full of flavor.  What else can you ask for?  I used less, tomato sauce, added a can of diced tomatoes, and used 4 cups of chicken broth rather than broth and water.

I made this recipe with absolutely no changes (wine and all!) and it was by far the most delicious soup I've ever made. Even my husband was raving over it and it's already being requested again.  My search for the perfect minestrone is over - thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This is definitely healthy as it is packed with fresh veggies. We all liked okay. No one was overly thrilled about it. I think is was kind of bland and would definitely double, if not triple the spices.

Sorry, but I did not care for this at all.  I thought that it would be great with all of the amazing reviews, but nobody in my family would eat it.  We ended up wasting an entire pot of soup and ordering take-out instead...

I had to rate this 5 stars because it was absolutely great!!! I used all fresh veggies from the garden except the kidney beans. I followed Jamie's recipe exactly to the tea without any modifications and it turned out perfect.  Thanks Jamie for a great recipe.

We loved this!!!  I ended up being lazy and not adding the pasta.  It was still great!  A huge plus to this is Jamie knows enough to keep the pasta separate from the soup!  Now that's a sign of a good cook!!!  Thank you for sharing!!!

This was great. Took some advice from others - used all chicken broth but had to add some water as it did get too thick. Used large can of crushed tomatoes instead of sauce. Added red wine, some red pepper for zing and about half a lemon to brighten it up. Waited to add the beans until the end so not too mushy. Great basic recipe.

Four stars as made per recipe.  Five stars with some simple changes.  The tomato sauce is too overpowering for all these great veggies (we use fresh, not canned or frozen).  Use San Marzanos, crushed instead of the sauce or fresh if handy.

this fabulous soup uses veggies that are in season together and is hearty and delicious.  I never have canned veggies so used frozen, and dried oregano added earlier in the recipe lacking fresh.  I've used different kinds of spinach, or swiss chard instead.

like Jamie, we also love a good hearty soup.  It was so easy and very flavorful.  The husband and kids all loved it.  I doubled the recipe and all I can say is Yay for leftovers!  We will be making this over and over again.  Perfect for a cold wintery day.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

With some minor adjustments, this is the best vegetable soup I've ever had! I've made it many times and still love it. I don't like kidney beans and didn't want green beans in this soup, so I use yellow squash instead and add more spinach. I replace the water with 2 c. of vegetable broth. I skip the red wine, pasta and parmesan. I also add the carrots sooner to make sure they end up tender. Using Trader Joe's organic tomato sauce is a must for me too, as I think the flavor is great. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Before this even had a chance to simmer, I tasted the broth so I could start thinking about what I might need to add to enhance the flavor... to my surprise, it was already delicious! No measuring for me. And I hate having a measely 1/2cup or so of beans hanging around, so I tossed in the whole can. I just realized I didn't add the green beans...oops! I would've done frozen if I added them anyways. --My *ONLY* criticism, something I should've trusted my instinct on, was the carrots. I knew I should've either chopped them smaller or cooked them longer. I ended up letting this simmer for awhile longer to cook the carrots more. Since I had already added the pasta at that point, the pasta ended up a little too soft... bummer! The flavor is so irresistable I found myself sampling the bowls I had portioned out for lunches... mmm! Looking forward to lunch tomorrow!  **Tip: add the dried pasta toward the end of simmering and you can skip the extra step of cooking the pasta. Just be careful you don't cook too long!

LOVE this soup!  I only used 1 onion (2 would've been too oniony for my liking), used the entire can of beans, and had to use frozen spinach rather than fresh.  I got 10 decent size servings, which is good because I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers.

Loved this soup!  Made a few minor changes based on other reviews...Used beef base instead of chicken broth.  Used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 4 cups of tomato sauce.  Was a nice hardy soup on a cool spring day!  Thank you for the great recipe Jamie!

Delicious!  Used ditalini, and instead of fresh, I used the same measurements of dried basil and oregano.  I used a whole 15 oz can of kidney beans and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and also did 3 cups of chicken broth and no water.  Otherwise, threw all ingredients in a slow cooker and simmered all day.  Delicious!  Makes a ton, though, half the recipe would have been quite enough for my family of 6.

Wow! Excellent, excellent! Loved this soup. Great flavor. Used 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and some tomato paste in place of tomato sauce, frozen peas in place of green beans, and four Idaho potatoes in place of zucchini. Served it with homemade garlic bread on a wintry night. This definitely hit the spot.

This soup was not a hit with my family.  I think you have to add the wine or else you won't get the full extent of the flavor.  The broth was good, but I felt that the vegetables overpowered it, eventhough I cut down on them!  I only used one zucchini and 4 carrots.  But there was still too many vegetables.  More of a stoup than a soup.

Not one review I've read didn't change the recipe-so why review it? It's not the same recipe! If you post a rating/review, make it as stated. Otherwise it's just your recipe! As posted this recipe merits 4 1/2 stars in my books.

I absolutely love this recipe, I have used this recipe about a dozen times now and have made it exactly the way it was written about 4 times and the other times have added veggies that I just had in the fridge or not used certain veggies because I didn't have them, But this has never been a fail for me, the family enjoys it every single time I make it. In my opinion people are losing out if they do not pick this minestrone recipe to make. Delicious I would give it a million stars if I could :)

This is a fantastic recipe! the only changes i made was i put 5 cloves garlic, 4 cups vegi broth instead of half and half broth and water, added an additional cup of water, and i used dried herbs b/c i could not find any fresh herbs at the market that were worth buying, put alot more spinach than the recipe called for (maybe 3/4 of a 10 oz bag?) and i let it simmer for aprox. 2 hours. GREAT! my husband loved it as well!

This soup is delicious especially on a cold day. However, I did a little tweaking here and there to make the recipe even better. I used 2 cups of tomato sauce and 2 cup of dice tomato. Also added additional red wine about 3/4 of a cup. Used white beans in addition to kidney beans, but cut back on zucchinis to just 1(not much of a fan). I also used frozen green beans, chopped up instead of canned. Omitted the onions completely and the recipe was still fine. Also add about 4-5 cups of chopped spinach and a lot more basil, I just love the aroma of basil! I made this for my mom and dad, they both loved it. I recommend this recipe for beginners since its easy to follow.

I love this recipe, and it is a true standby now. I add other veggies depending on what I have in the house, but the only thing I relaly recommend is to add a splash of balsamic vinegar near the beginning, it adds a wonderful depth to the soup!

This recipe is great as written, but I also use it as a base to use up whatever vegetables are in the fridge and whatever canned beans I have in the pantry.  I love to add butter beans and barley! I use vegetable stock as we are vegetarian and I add an extra 1/4 cup of grated parmesan to the pot as I love the creaminess that it gives the soup.  It's a lovely hearty soup, perfect comfort food for winter especially when served with garlic bread. I usually serve it without the pasta on the first night and add pasta the second night for variety. Freezes well.

Amazing!!! I was VERY loose with this recipe and it turned out superbly. I'd never made Minestrone before and this was the greatest more forgiving recipe. I swayed off the beaten path by adding chopped kale stems and broccoli stems (I never like to throw scraps away). I also didn't follow the amount recommendations for anything- I just used what I had. They key ingredient was certainly the basil. That made all the difference.

This recipe is amazing! I took it to an internationals carry-in and every bit was eaten. I did make some changes, primarily using vegetable broth rather than chicken broth in order to make it a vegan dish and I added both garbanzo beans and cannelli beans. I also read the suggestions of others and instead of just zucchini I used squash and potatoes. I used cooking sherry instead of red wine and also added some basalmic vinegar. I also sauteed all my fresh veggies along with the herbs before adding any liquids. The only things I waited to add were the canned items (beans). We had a dietician at the event that looked over the recipe and she was thrilled with the healthiness of it! Great choice for anybody trying to make a large, healthy meal.

I am crazy about soup and this is the best recipe I've made this year. I used fresh green beans and dry kidney beans (just boil for 45 minutes before adding). Included red wine and a few drops of lemon as recommended by another reviewer. Fantastic!

I thought this was pretty good, though a little bland. I cut everything in half except the veggies and the chicken broth. I didn't have spinach on hand, but it still worked well. I also used frozen green beans instead of canned, white wine instead of red.

This was so sooo delicious! It embodies classic minestrone as a comfort food. As usual though, I couldn't help but add my own twist on it and if any of my changes appeal to you please use them! First of all I halved the recipe so my alterations were applied as such: 1 cup can diced tomato in place of 1 cup of tomato sauce, about 1/4 cup chardonnay, juice of 1 lime, splash of red wine vinegar, 8 oz can garbanzo beans in place of green beans, 1 yellow squash in place of 1 zucchini, 1 roasted red bell pepper, 6 oz chicken breast pieces, and I used mini farfalle (bow ties) instead of shells. For more seasoning I added about 2 tbsp sugar and a pinch of each of these: red pepper flakes, cumin, thyme, rosemary, paprika, and 1 bay leaf. I also made parmesean crisps instead of sprinkling it on top. After trying it both ways I think sprinking it on top is indeed better!

Great recipe!  I feel the need to point out the nutrition error in a previous review.  I am a dietician and Jamie's recipe is very healthy. I subbed whole wheat pasta and used low-sodium broth and tomatoes, rinsed the beans before adding to the soup and use fresh or frozen veggies. I don't know where the reviewer got some of the numbers but I just made the soup and can say that the sodium is NO WHERE near 1267 per serving (when using lower sodium products).  Fresh is ALWAYS better than canned and pre-made. Great soup Jamie!

I just made this soup for my family. It was amazing! I added two diced potatoes, fresh green beans, and the entire bag of spinach. I also added 1/2 green pepper to the onion and garlic saute. I didn't have fresh basil so I used 3 heaping tablespoons of basil pesto. Serve with lots of freshly grated Romano cheese on top and a side of crusty bread.

I have made this soup 3 times now and if you stick to the basic's it turns out perfect every time. I have changed the beans to black then both kidney and black beans but if you put the spinach in it will get slimy quickly by the next day.  Just add the spinach to your bowl and put it in the microwave or kettle and heat it up good.  It is the best!!!!!!

I made this recipe with excellent reviews from a group of friends.  I used several suggestions from others - increased amount of chicken broth and water, used only 2 zucchini, did not use spinach because of preferences of others.  I also used diced, Italian seasoned tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce (I pureed one large can and added one small can as is).  Next time I think I'll use 2 cans of beans and add them near the end so that they don't break down as much.

This soup turned out pretty good. I just made a few minor changes... used veggie broth instead of chicken, used white wine instead of red, and used dried oregano and basil (a little fresh basil too). I cut the recipe in half and it made about 5 servings. The large pot I used wouldn't have been able to fit the entire recipe in. I will be making this again and adding it to my recipe book!
**Tip: Cut the carrots thin or they'll take about an hour to cook!

This was delicious for being so healthy! This recipe is very modifiable depending on what you have on hand.  I used 4 cups of stock, 2 cans of diced tomato, & 1/2 cup red wine for the base. I skipped the sauteing step and instead let everything simmer for 1.5 hours.  I threw in an entire box of rotini pasta for the last 20 minutes.  I omitted the green beans and used about 2 cups of canellini beans.  I seasoned with some Tony's Creole seasoning, and then when it was done I added a few dashes of McCormick's Salad Supreme and parmesan cheese.

WOW!!!  This was SOOO good.  To be completely honest, while it was simmering I was getting a little bummed because I didn't think it smelled all that great, but we just got done with dinner and my husband and I both absolutely loved it!!  I already just sat down to write it on a recipe card with a few of my personal preferences.  Definitely a 5-star.  One note: this NEEDS to be topped with the Parmesan.  Without it, it would not have been near as good. It's vital to the perfect flavor.  

My adjustments...I doubled the chicken broth, only did 1 zucchini, but added 1 yellow squash, added 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes and some creole seasoning and cayenne for a kick.  I used dried herbs because that's what I had.  I did not add the wine, simply because I didn't want to buy any today.  I didn't feel like the soup was missing anything without it. Absolutely perfect!    I will make it exactly the same way next time!

This was wonderful!!  I made some slight alterations.  We are non-drinkers, so I did not add the wine.  I also added some crookneck squash which are abundant in our garden right now.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!!

The aroma itself earns 5 stars.  My house smells heavenly.  The taste doesn't let you down either.  It is magnificent.  Use the wine, it pulls it all together.  I used a Merlot.  It made so much that I gave half of it to my parents.  They both LOVED it.

This is a great summer or winter soup.  I love to make it in the summer with garden fresh vegetables.  I usually substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth to make a vegetarian soup.  This also freezes well.  I have used dried oregano and basil in a pinch and it was still very good.

Fantastic recipe!  I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe such as, I used garbanzo beans instead of kidney beans.  I also used minced beef in.  I browned the meat in a bit of olive oil and when partially cooked I added the garlic, followed by the carrots and celery.  One minute later I added the onions and let the mixture cook through.  I used two veggie cubes and two chicken cubes instead of chicken stock and I also used one small can of tomoto puree.  I had to add more water since I used meat and since I also added a bit more vegetables than were called for, but that's due to personal liking.  I froze half and will definitely enjoy it in the future!

What a wonderful soup! It makes alot more than 8 servings. The grocery store forgot to put my spinach in the bag, so I didn't put that in my soup. It was still delicious. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "T". This will become part of my tried and true recipes and I will be making it many, many more times!

Delicious! But I only used two 15oz cans of tomato sauce insted of the full 4cups, so as not to waste most of a third can! Plus I added garbanzo beans in the same amount as the kidney beans... yummy

Great recipe. Even my boyfriend who is strictly anti-vegetarian finished a bowl of this soup! I did make a few adjustments as follows: after simmering for a while the soup did evaporate a little, so I added two additional cups of chicken stock. I also added a 1/4 cup pearl barley about 40 minutes before the soup was ready. Instead of cooking the pasta separately, I simply added the raw pasta in the final 20 minutes of cooking time. Like another reviewer, I thought the high acidity of the tomato puree called for some sugar, and added a tablespoon which seemed to work quite well. Next time I might cut down on the celery (some of it still stayed a little crunchy even though I cooked this for about an hour, but other than that, I wouldn't change anything else. Plus - it makes plenty of soup - I actually had to use two pots! This will definately come in handy stored in containers in the freezer (which is good considering it took so long to prepare...chopping vegetables is time consuming!). Thanks for a great recipe Jamie!

This is definitely better when it's had a chance to sit for a while. I only used a small can of tomato sauce, a few tablespoons of tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes. I used all chicken broth  - no water. I added a bit of crushed red pepper and some fresh thyme. Used ditalini pasta because I like the way it holds up in soups. This makes a ton of soup. Loved it. I'll make this again for sure.

Loved this soup!!  The only thing I changed is I added more broth and a extra can of beans(daughter loves beans).  I think the wine really makes this soup good.

Awesome! I used 2 cans chicken broth and 1 28 oz tomato sauce. I think 2 zukes were enough. I made it last night and its gone! I will made this all the time.

My family loves this soup! It's wonderful made exactly as written, but now that I've made it several times, I've started adding some crushed fennel seeds.  It seems to add a little something.

I have made this soup several times and it is wonderful.  I always get asked for the recipe.  I add parsnips, turnips, squash, corn and any other vegetables I have.  Always so yummy!  Thanks for this recipe!

Yummy! Dried herbs work fine for this, just use one tablespoon each. For a low carb version skip the pasta (there isn't much of it anyway) and use turnips instead of carrots or just leave the carrots out. Wonderful with hearty whole grain bread to sop up the left over sauce.

This is excellent. I added 1.5 lb. of ground turkey when sauteing the onions and it added great flavor. I also substituted crushed tom and a bit of tom. past for the tomato sauce and white wine for the red. This was one delicious and filling soup!

This was one of the first recipes I tried from "allrecipes" and is a family favorite.  With so many ingredients, it lends itself well to personalizing.  My daughter is a vegetarian so we use vegetable broth and I add garbanzo beans.  I also like to use raddiatore instead of shells cause they don't break down so easily.  Thanks, Jamie.

Great soup!  After reading a number of reviews, I did make a few changes.  I used beef broth rather than chicken.  I also added a large veg. bullion cube to the water which I increased to 2 1/2 cups.  Instead of 4 cups tomato sauce I used 2 cans chopped and 1 can sauce.  I also added 4 small white potatoes cut into cubes and 1 lb lean ground beef browned (My Hubby isn't wild about soup with no meat).  I used about 1 C frozen green beans rather than canned and left out the wine because I didn't have any on hand.  Finally I kicked up the spice a bit.  I added twice as much Basil (fresh), 1 T italian seasoning, 4 cloves worth of garlic (minced fresh in a jar), salt, pepper, and a couple of shakes of dried hot peppers just to give it a little kick.  I would say this is the best ministroni soup I have ever made.  It is great because you can easily make changes to fit your own tastes.

I don't even LIKE minestrone and just made it for fiance, but boy is this a far cry from the canned kind... This is fabulous!  5 star worthy recipe if there ever was one... I only made a couple changes, used all chicken broth in place of water and added an extra can, so 3 cans total, added a can of garbonzo beans, omitted the spinach and used dry basil because my store was out of fresh and added a bay leaf.  This is amazing, I am so glad I tried it!

Added:  I am on Weight Watchers so I wanted to know the serving size... With the extra can of chicken broth I used, it made a little over 12 cups of soup.

This recipe is perfect!  It's hearty, but it doesn't make you feel like you've eaten too much food.  It's flavorful and you can taste everything!  I will half the recipe next time, I had to use 2 pots just to fit all the ingredients.

This was great. I found a package of "soup vegetables" in the produce section and used most of it (it contained some celery, a carrot, a poatato, an onion, and two other root veggies) I also added chicken and used tortellini instead of regular pasta. DELICIOUS. will make again!

This was excellent but I made a few changes: twice the kidney beans, an extra cup of chicken broth, lots of red wine and black pepper, and 1 cup of macaroni pasta mixed into the soup rather than pouring the soup over them. Next time, I will use one less carrot and a little less celery.

This has a wonderful taste to it!  My husband & really enjoyed it.  I only made some minor changes, added 2 cups each more of chicken broth & tomato suace as I like the "soup" part of soup.  I was a little nervous about putting in the wine because I've had recipes end up tasting only like the wine, but this really did complement it the soup.  I would make this again.

This soup is wonderful.  I have been looking for a recipe for a great minestrone and this one hit it right on the nose.  I too made it with vegetable broth, I addded a few bay leaves for extra flavor, and used white wine (about 1/2 C) instead of red.  It's easy to taylor to your preferences.  This soup freezes well if you leave the noodles out.  I also made it with barley on one occasion and that was great too.  I make this soup about once a month and it never gets old.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This is just a great soup - some of the best ministrone we've ever had.  My wife and I both really enjoyed it, and our 10 year old even ate a bowl!  Next time I think I'll add a bit more garlic, chicken stock, and use the whole can of kidney beans.  I'll definitely make this one again.

I'm very disappointed by this recipe and as others said it lacks the flavor of a good, rich minestrone.  I even used all chicken stock and cut back on some veggies and didn't add the beans but there was still way to many veggies.  Plus, the acidity of the tomato sauce made mush out of the zucchini.  My boyfriend said to me - where's the broth, hun?  What little broth there was had a nice flavor and that accounts for the extra star, otherwise I would have given this just one.

This soup was very flavorful and nice and chunky!  I've worked at the Olive Garden and hands down this beat their minestrone.  I let it simmer about 45-55 minutes and it was wonderful!

"BUONO MINESTRA"  Good Soup in Italian! I've been looking for a good minestrone and this is it! I pretty much stuck to the recipe but I did add more broth and I added cannoli beans. About the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, I added a couple handfuls of pasta (pick your own shape) and some Romano cheese and it was Delicious. Will definately make this a staple. What a savings too. It's almost a sin to buy canned soup. A small can of minestrone runs over a dollar a can some almost two and doesn't taste half as good. Buon Appetito!

Yum!!!  This was quite tasty.  (It takes quite a lot for me to give anything 5 stars!)  I added my own twist, but I'm sure it would have been good as is.  I included some chicken sausage and substituted cheese filled tortillini for the pasta.  I also did not have fresh herbs on hand so I substituted 3 tsp. of Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle, which I absolutely love.  It had a good flavor, not over powering, but delicious.  I'll definitely make this again.

When he said "overflowing with veggies" he wasn't kidding!!  This almost resembled a stew once I got everything in!!  Per other reviewers suggestions, I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (2 cans), but I think next time I'll go ahead and add one can of tomato sauce in addition...there wasn't quite enough broth for my liking, and I think the tomato sauce will add alot to the flavor!  Good healthy, HEARTY soup!!

Thanks for this great soup recipe.  My inlaws loved it and even asked for some to take home and freeze!!  I took the advice of others by adding canned corn and doubling the amount of broth, and using diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Yummy!!!

Jamie's Minestrone is absolutely magnificent!! The soup is bursting with flavor and chocked-full of healthy and tasty veggies. Some of the things I did differently were substituting some canned green bean and bean water for plain water, doubling the amount of broth, and using diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I also added some dried rosemary and thyme as well as the basil and oregano, which were also dried. This turned out perfect!! Definitely a keeper! Thanks Jamie!

This recipe is simply terrific. I read all the reviews first and made a few of the suggested changes (doubled the amount of broth, added diced canned tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, added red chili peppers for a little more kick, added some canned corn, added some chopped scallions I had left over in the fridge). Also, since everyone was saying how much it made, I split the recipe into two pots keeping one vegetarian and the other half I added spicy italian sausage to (as my husband would shy away from anything that was totally veggie). I also omitted the pasta and didn't miss it at all. The soup was so good I couldn't help sharing it with friends and family- but then I didn't end up with much for me! I'll be making it again this weekend and probably doubling the whole thing so that I'll have enough to eat for lunch all next week. Yum, yum, yum!!! Thank you Jamie :-)

Very delicious and healthy.  I used one can of regular tomato sauce and one can of italien herbed tomato sauce.  Definitely make sure that you use fresh basil, it really makes a difference. YUMMY!!

Awesome!  I added homemade chicken stock.  Tomato juice instead of water, omitted the kidney beans and added chopped grilled chicken breast.  Was even delicious to my brother who is mainly a meat eater and does no care for soup.

Loved this soup.  Served in bread bowls with salads.  Had company for dinner and they said they could smell the soup out in the street.  They said they knew it must be my house because I am the only one on my block that cooks!  Thanks to jamie and allrecipe.com

This soup was EXCELLENT!  I omitted the red wine and pasta.  Didn't have tomato sauce so I added a can of crushed tomatoes.  It was more of a vegetable stew and as the other reviewers noted it certainly tasted better the next day!

This is the best soup I ever made in my life! I tried this for a church function and everyone loved it !! The spinach brought so much color and zest . I actually made the soup 2 days before I needed it and it tasted as if I made it the same day. I always thought that minestrone soup was hard to make until I tried this recipe. The vegetables made this soup awesome. I did not even use the pasta because the broth and vegatables were so delicious. If your looking to explore your tomatoe soups this recipe is a MUST TRY!!!!

Very good. I halved the recipe, which still made a huge pot, and made similar adjustments as other reviewers: diced tomatoes and a small can of sauce, all broth no water, white beans, more pasta and left out canned green beans. Good combination of veggies and simmer time is right on for a thick soup and tender veggies, with the exception of the celery which I will sauté longer next time. Cooking pasta separate and adding to each bowl really helps keep it from being overdone. Great with Parmesan and French bread - thank you!

My husband claims to hate half the vegetables in this soup, but cleaned his bowl with a smile on his face. I managed to burn my garlic right off the bat so threw that out and started over, subbing 3/4 tsp garlic powder when I poured in the liquids. Used dried herbs (on hand). "Pepper to taste" was 1/4 tsp (perfect). I did not add salt and it didn't need it, even though I used homemade chicken stock with very little salt. I would probably add if I didn't use canned green beans. Very, very good!

What a great soup! I did not have canned kidney beans, so I added a handful of dried bean mixture (lentils, navy, kidney, peas). This mixture is found in the soup aisle and is a great pantry staple. My guess is one could add just about any vegetable you have on hand it will come out great. This soup keeps a long time in the fridge and actually improves over a few days!

This was so delicious!! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I pretty much doubled the garlic (I love garlic) and I strongly recommend the red wine addition, it just makes all the favors pop!! I'm definitely a beginner soup chef, but this was such a great recipe that it makes me want to do more!

So yum!!! As the author says, this is a low sodium, high vegetable version of minestrone. My modifications to the recipe were: 2 cups of crushed tomatoes, 4 cups of water, chicken bullion to make 2 cups of broth, and because I happened to have a 14 oz can of tomatoes seasoned with basil, they went in too. I was a little shy on some of the vegetables but that didn't really matter. I also used probably 2 tablespoons of my favorite Italian seasoning blend instead of fresh. I didn't have red wine on hand so I used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar. The tip to cook the pasta separately and add it in the bowl is excellent. This is a great use-it-up soup and it's also freezer friendly. It's going to get a long term place in my recipe rotation.

This is my "go-to" soup.  Easy to make, eaten by all in the family including the picky eaters.  A couple of changes: I use 2 cans of chicken broth (Swanson low-sodium)with a 1/2 can water and 1/2 can red wine instead of the measurements listed.  I also make 1 1/2 cups (dry) shells and add them directly to the pot after they are cooked.  This time I used whole wheat shells and they were fantastic!

lots of chopping but essentially simple to put together...very good.  I did use whole tomatoes that I crushed up instead of tomato sauce and added 1 large diced potato.

This is the best minestrone recipe I've tried!  I only made a few minor changes:  used 1 quart of organic "no chicken" broth in place of the chicken broth and water (I'm vegan), added an extra clove of garlic, and used a pound of fresh organic green beans instead of canned.  Perfect!!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  Family and friends loved it as well.  Pretty much stuck with the recipe only added fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden.  Will never order it out again as I will know I will be dissappointed.

Incredible, I've tried a few different recipes, and this one is by far the best. I've never made it exactly as stated, which to me says that you can't go wrong. The very few negative reviews sound to be people who aren't used to cooking - anyone who knows anything about cooking knows that tomato sauce is basically passata with herbs and garlic, and maybe some tomato puree. It's not dolmio, and it certainly isn't ketchup. I just use my own tomato sauce ingredients and throw them in the pot - for this recipe, that's lots of dry herbs, lots of garlic, a bay leaf and three tins of plum tomatoes that I squeeze to break up. I also added two dry chillies. My boyfriend just had two extra helpings of this. Absolutely top notch, good enough for us to eat for three days in a row

Reminded me of the Weight Watchers veggie soup which I like but I was just hoping for a more robust soup. Although much better on day #2, I didn't think this was all that great.

Very good soup-used merlot and a parmesan rind for flavor....the veggies needed alot more time to simmer than the recipe stated to become soft.

Really enjoyed this soup.  Great flavors and loads of veggies.  Per other reviews I used 4 cups chicken stock, 3 cups tomato sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes, added in 3 cubed red potatoes, used 2 zucchinis instead of 3, added 1 can (not 1 cup) kidney beans and cannellini beans, and used dried oregano and basil.  Simmered for a little over an hour, and everything turned out great.  This makes a TON of soup though - way more than 8 servings in my house - probably closer to 10-12.

As other people have commented - turned out fantastic. I also added some chopped chayote that I had in the fridge and some blended fresh tomatoes in place of some of the tomato sauce. Great recipe!

Thank you for a delicious and healthy recipe, I can't stop eating this stuff!  The second time I made it I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted V8 for the tomato sauce and water and chicken broth, and added a chicken bouillon cube, and it turned out wonderful.

I stayed pretty much on course with the recipe with the following exceptions due to personal taste:
-I cooked up some hot italian sausage first and sauteed the mirepoix with that.
-We don't like green beans so I substituted shredded cabbage there.
-I'm not a fan of the kidney bean so I used garbanzos insted.
-I prefer dittelini in this particular soup.
-We require a high level of spiciness so I added cayenne and crushed red.

This is a total keeper. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it still made a TON so bear that in mind.

4.5 stars.  This was 5 star good the night I made it, but unfortunately as leftovers the next day I didn't think it was nearly as good.  And I have LOTS of leftovers :(  If I make it again, I will make only enough to serve for one meal.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jamie!!

This was delicious! I used 1 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and 1 14 oz can of tomato sauce, instead of all tomato sauce. I also used swiss chard in place  of the spinach because I had it on hand. 

This is the first minestrone recipe I have encountered that recommends cooking the pasta separately - excellent idea.  For leftovers, I didn't add the cooked pasta in until the soup was completely cool. This prevents the pasta from becoming monstrous ginormo noodles overnight as happens too often.

Considering adding some bacon or pancetta in at the beginning with the onions next time.

This recipe is great, no changes.  If you are going to change the recipe it is no longer Jamie's recipe, it is yours.  Why review it with all the changes.  If it was my recipe it would make me feel bad with all of your changes.

Great soup. Only changes I made were based on financial need (or using what I already had bought). No celery, but 2 cans of beans (one kidney, one cannelini). Probably a few extra carrots because the 2lb bag I bought had The Smallest Carrots Ever, so after cutting up 6 or so it seemed like too few, and I ended up putting in all 2lbs! I swear it did NOT look like that much... I used a whole package of baby spinach - it cooks down so it barely adds any mass. I also used 5 cups water + 3 chicken bouillon cubes, and instead of 4C tomato sauce, I had v8 in the fridge so I used 4C of that. The only other thing I added was 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and a can of tomato paste because I was worried about leaving out the tomato sauce. I only had dried spices too, no fresh. Finally, I cooked a whole 16oz package of small shell macaroni and mixed it in at the end. I know this sounds like a lot of changes but ultimately I still love this recipe. I will be happy to make it with fresh spices when I can afford them. I just happened to have wine on hand, and I always use bullion cubes when I can... Even the night I made it, the soup was chunky and delicious. If I had extra tomato sauce instead of v8 I would have used it, but still a whole bag of macaroni because I love pasta and chunky soup. Exactly the recipe I was looking for... from one Jamie to another, thank you! :)

I've made this dozens of times, and it usually turns out good.  Normally, I use only two zucchini and 1 handful of raw baby spinach, and trust me, that's more than enough.  (That change resulted in my 4 star rating for the original recipe.)  Recently I made this, and tried using veggie broth to make it more vegetarian friendly.  If you're going to do this, do NOT skip the wine, and plan on adding tons more spies than called for (at least 4x each of oregano and basil).  You lose a lot of flavor when using veggie broth.

I have never lover of minestrone basically because I'm not a fan of tomato based soups but there was something about this recipe that caught my eye. 
My husband is a soup fanatic and I try to find good recipes that will last for a few meals because I get home too late from work to start fussing in the kitchen.
I have to say that this is a fantastic recipe for something I'm not even crazy about!
I pretty much followed it as written but I added a can of diced tomatoes and baked some Italian sausage in which I cut in to tiny pieces and threw into the pot. Also, I only used two zucchinis because they were pretty big ones and omitted the wine simply because I really dislike it. As usual, I tasted a bit here and there as it cooked but I just had my first bowl and could not believe how incredibly scrumptious this is.
It's the very first minestrone that I've loved. I can't recommend it highly enough. Jamie, you're a genius.  Thank you sooooo much!!!

Amazing soup!  I halved the recipe and substituted chicken broth for the water, and diced tomatoes for half the tomato sauce.  I kept the amount of garlic the same (3 cloves)  Also added 1/2 tsp salt and grated pepper to lightly cover the top of the pot while cooking.  I actually made it up to the point of putting all the veggies in and bringing it to a boil then turning it off for the afternoon.  When I got home,  Insimmered it for about 20 min with the kidney beans in and  cooking the pasta on the side.  It was perfect!  My husband wanted another batch the next night and I couldn't agree more!  A healthy and tasty way of getting all your veggies!

Yum!! This soup is delicious, healthy, hearty easy. I changed it by adding potatoes & chickpeas and left out spinach & greenbeans. Used 1 tbsp dried basil and 1 tsp dried oregano as I had no fresh. Used all veggie broth instead of water. Lots more noodles as I like noodles! Added kidney beans at the end so they weren't all mushy. Also added some chipotle poweder, which made all the difference! Blended maybe 1/4-1/3 for great texture! 40 min is perfect or I feel the zucc, potatoes, carrots, etc... would get mushy. Glad I will be eating this for days!

This soup is SOOO good!  A great way to get the kids to eat a variety of veggies!  I made a few changes to suit my family's taste...

I omitted the red wine (but I'm sure it's really good with, I was just worried the kids wouldn't like it)
I omitted the pasta
I omitted the parmesan cheese
I used 1/2 large vidalia onion instead of 2 whole onions
I added vegetable stock instead of chicken stock
I added 1 idaho potato ( I peeled, cubed and boiled it to texture I like and added it after the soup was done cooking)
I also added peas and corn, about 3/4 to 1 cup of each
The only other thing I did different was I waited until the last 5 minutes of cooking to add the zucchini so it didn't get mushy, it was perfection!  I cold eat this soup every day of the week!

This was an easy (but lots of chopping) recipe and so, so yummy!  It really is one of the best minestrone soups I've tasted and it's sooo healthy.  I love this and will make it throughout the fall and winter every year.

This is definately the BEST minestrone I have ever had. My husband who has never  liked minestrone, LOVED it! I did add Italian sausage and canned Italian stewed tomatoes to it, which took it to a 6 star rating if there were 6 stars. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will be making it again and again!

Best minestrone!! Don't leave out the red wine it ablsolutely makes this soup! I used frozen spinach, no zucchini (didn't have any), 4 cans of chicken broth, trippled the pasta, added a can of garbanzo beans, used dried basil and oregano and added a tsp of crushed red pepper. Spicy with the red pepper but that's how I like it! WOW!!! So much flavor! I cant wait to make it again with zucchini and fresh herbs it can only get better!

I kind of played with the veggies based on what I had, but remained true to the rest of the recipe.  One thing I did was to use a box of frozen spinach (defrosted and squeezed of liquid) instead of the fresh.  I made and froze (minus the pasta) to take on a family vacation.  My dad and FIL ate almost half of it themselves - and neither one likes spinach!  With great response from finicky eaters, this recipe couldn't be rated lower than a 5.  Thanks so much for sharing - I will make this often.

Absolutely delicious.
I've never made minestrone before and found this to be simple and healthy and very tasty exactly as written!

This soup is wonderful. 

I cook and serve the pasta separately from the soup to be added by each person since I've been trying to cut carbs.

Also, my husband is a meat eater, so I chop up a package of Italian sausage (with the poultry shears) and saute and serve separately.

Thanks Jamie...this soup has been a favorite for years.

I made the recipe as is. It was delicious and full of flavor. I've been dissatisfied with Minestrone I've ordered at restaurants...this recipe definitely tops them all! My only complaint was that it was really chunky and full of vegetables and I would have preferred a little more broth. Other reviewers said it was more like "stoup" than soup. I would agree. Easy fix for next time I make it.

I love this recipe, I've been making this minestrone for years now. I do change it up a bit, like fresh green beans, dry, non canned kidney beans and more water or chicken broth. This is my favorite soup, I never get tired of it. Thank you Jamie!! You ROCK!

These was great, it made a super harty soup, but i may have overdone it on the veggies, because i had to add more broth,water, and tomato sauce. With so much in it, it didnt soften the veggies as much as i prefer. but eating it the next day was perfect! Great with garlic bread sticks.

Amazing soup.  It's my go-to recipe if I need soup on hand.  I mostly just follow the recipe but adapt with veggies and beans that I have on hand.  I like the added red wine, gives deeper flavor especially 2nd day.

I would cut down on the tomato sauce and use more broth/water. I think 2 cups of tomato sauce is plenty. Otherwise a solid recipe for a healthy and flavorful miestrone.

This was great!  I made it in a crock pot on high for 6 hours.  I used dry beans and didn't even soak them first.  It turned out great.  I also added the cooked pasta directly to the soup in the last 15 minutes.

This was so yummy! I added 1lbs. of ground beef mixed that with the onion and garlic.  so i didnt add the olive oil- added kale instead of spinach-added fresh green beans and added all the other veggies.  it turned out really really good and thinking about making it again this week with cabbage.  we made this soup with a pumpernickel bread from this site and it turned out really good together! thank you for sharing the recipe!

I really enjoyed this soup!  Great taste and very satisfying with all the veggies.  The one change I made to this recipe was that I cooked it in a slow cooker.  I sauteed the garlic and onions in olive oil, threw that with everything else (except pasta and cheese) in a slow cooker and cooked on low for somewhere between 6-8 hrs.  I boiled the pasta separately and added it to the soup before serving.

This minestrone soup has to be the best I ever had. The flavor was amazing and it was so hearty. With the exception of having to substitute dried herbs instead of fresh I followed the recipe to the letter. I did add the red wine. Next time I will double the liquids and spices to make it a little soupier but this went over so well we didn't even have any leftovers! (Even my picky 2 year old loved it!)

This was delicious! My husband loved it and said it was probably the most vegetables he's eaten at once. I did forget the Parmesan, which I really wanted to try since all the other reviews said it was good. Fortunately, there's plenty left over. I made it the day before serving (but didn't add the pasta until before serving) and it was just delicious.

This is a GREAT recipe! I have made this many times. I don't change anything, and it is SO good!! It really is better the longer it can simmer, letting the flavors blend together. We love this! It does make a lot, though. Thanks for the great recipe Jamie!

The best minestrone that I have found so far! I loved the huge amount of veggies and everything tasted great. I made this for a vegan friend so I changed the chicken broth to vegetable broth, and skipped the cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect soup for a cold day.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken to accomodate a vegetarian family member, and had to use dried spices instead of fresh.  It's a great recipe to add any type of vegetable you want.

Homemade soups are super nourishing.   This is a great recipe.   May I make a few suggestions? keep celery in.  It's a wonderful, mild diuretic. keep zucchini also.  Green beans:  fresh are best. simply wash an cut into 1" angled pieces.. so easy. Homemade chicken broth... a good habit to get into making a big batch once a week.   preferably use a can of organic chopped tomatos (juice is optional) and can of organic beans, unsalted (your choice)  for greens lacinata kale is superb as well as endive.... as for pasta,  it's best to add at end of cooking soup.  Turn off heat,   throw in handful of raw pasta and let sit about 8 mins. Pasta should always be "al dente"  Otherwise if overcooked,  it spikes insulin levels rapidly. wine would be optional... I would increase fresh chick broth instead and finally, of course,  fresh grated parm cheese.   Yummmm !

I made a lot of modifications to this recipe, but it was a great base to work from. I would always skip the canned green beans (yuck!) and make sure to include the wine (port works as well).

Minestrone soup was never my favorite - until now. This recipe is amazing.  Please, please, please make it as stated and don't skip the red wine.  The red wine really makes a huge difference - for the better.

My family loved this soup!  I was happy feeding it to them knowing how many servings of veggies they were getting, my little secret!  I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 4 hours on high, could have used a little more time but everyone was hungry.

We were surprised at how good this was.  It seemed so simple, just throwing regular ingredients in the pot like this, but it really was delicious.  It just kept on getting better, the longer it sat.  It's unusual for me not to have to throw out the last bit of leftovers when we finally get tired of eating it, but I didn't waste a drop of this soup!

This soup is SO good, I'd been looking for a great soup recipe and this is definitely it! I used 2 large cans of no-salt whole tomatoes, 4 C of chicken broth, and chopped kale and mushrooms which I sauteed with the carrots and celery. Tomorrow we're going to toss some cooked ground bison in with the leftover soup and see what that's like. Made a loaf of rye bread and it was a very satisfying meal!

This was good yet bland.  I had to add way more seasoning and more sauce (tomato and chicken broth) as it was very chunky.  Made a ton, ate it for two nights, gave two servings to the neighbor and have left overs in the freezer for two or three more meals.

Comforting and yummy! Every other time I've tried to make minestrone it seems to be lacking - this has everything you could want with wonderful full-body taste! I followed other reviewers and used white wine since we didn't have red. I also sauteed the onions in the olive oil before adding the garlic and veggies. One mistake a novice chef might make is accidently burning the garlic which can completely ruin this delicious soup! If you cook the onions through first then you won't risk burning your garlic. I also used garbanzo beans, and added about 1/2 the can on juice from my canned green beans (they're my fav). You cannot mess this up! Can't wait to make again once the weather cools down so I can thoroughly enjoy Jamie's Minestrone!

This is the best minestrone soup I've ever tasted, and my family agrees.  I used to really like the minestrone at Olive Garden, but this is even better.  After reading the reviews, I made a few changes too...  I used 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cups vegetable broth (no water).  I used 1 cup of noodles.  I like a few more noodles than the recipe calls for but not too many that the soup is dominated by them.  I used 2 zucchini and 1 yellow squash just for color.  I used 2 cups frozen cut green beans instead of canned.  I found that I was out of oregano so I used a heaping tablespoon of dried italian seasoning.  I used the entire 15 oz. can of kidney beans.  I added the wine - first 1/4 cup to see how it changed the flavor, then the other 1/4 cup because it was delicious.  It added a depth to the flavors.  Oh, and one more thing - I added a 15 oz. can of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I like tomatoes in the soup.  It was so delicious!

Delish!  Made this yesterday and  was very pleased with the results.  The changes I made were:  Used 5 cups tomato sauce cause I had a half can leftover from another meal.  Used frozen green beans and I yellow squash for one of the zucchinis.  I added a can of diced tomatoes per other reviewers.  Used dried spices because that is what I had on hand.  Added a handful of ditalini pasta to the pot last 10 mins of cooking and added the can of kidney beans at the end.  I also added a package of fully cooked "al fresco" spicy jalapeno chicken sausage, skin removed cut into 1/2 inch slices.  Also added a pinch of sugar because I like to do that when I cook with tomato base sauces.  This is a very hearty dish.

Delicious soup, but definitely not a true minestrone. A real one would be less thick, and would be made with tomato juice, not tomato sauce and water. I was actually asked if I used a roux in this soup! I left out spinach and zuchini, used 4 carrots, dried instread of fresh herbs, doubled the beans, and added peas and corn. As always, lots of fresh pepper. Very yummy, will make again!

In Jamie's description she says "lack of veggies" this soup definitely has the veggies. Nice hearty soup for a winter day. It was excellent. Another + is that its HEALTHY. I made a few minor modifications other than made it exactly like the instructions. I substituted crush tomatoes for tomato sauce. I also couldn't find fresh basil/oregeno so i used dried. The only thing i might try with this recipe in the future is to put a parmesian reggiona rind in the soup (don't throw those rinds away).

Absolutely delicious! I have been wanting to try a minestrone recipe for awhile, & I am so glad I picked this one! It is a bit time-consuming to chop all the vegetables, but I would say it is well worth the effort. I ended up adding more chicken broth & tomato sauce, simply because I added extra kidney beans & some cannellini beans, & I like a lot of juice in my soup. I also used dried basil & oregano with good results. Because of my additions, we ended up with tons of leftovers (not a bad thing! :)) This is a very hearty & filling recipe, but very healthy. A new favorite!

Really like this...followed recipe exactly. The reason I gave 4 stars is because it needs a little extra kick, something to give the flavor more depth, to make you say, "YUMM!!!"...next time will add more wine and maybe some heat.

Best minestrone recipe I've found!  I've made this many, many times and my family is always happy when they find out it's on the menu.  I play around with ingredients, depending on what I happen to have on hand.  Canned italian green beans work in a pinch, and I use arugula rather than spinach.  It's key to cook your pasta separately and only add as you dish it out.  When storing leftovers, don't add the pasta to the soup - it lets the pasta break down and then you have mush.  Also, if I add beans, I always add them near the last 20-30 minutes so they don't get mushy.

Very good, and good for you. I added potatoes and took out the zuchinni, but you could add nearly any vegetable, Very Versatile. There is not much liquid with this recipe, I would probably add more tomato sauce or broth, or even blended whole tomatoes (From a jar or seeded tomatoes). Fresh basil and oregano make all the difference. VERY GOOD!

This was excellent. My family enjoyed it very much. The only thing I did differently was to add the Zucchini at the same time as the pasta because I don't like soft zucchini. Great recipe! Thank you for sharing!

Oh wow!  This was really good.  I made subsitutions to fit what i had on hand.  I omitted the red wine, finished the beef broth I had on hand, used 32oz crushed italian tomatoes, 1 14 oz can diced italian tomatoes.  Added frozen corn, green beans and spinach.  Also added a can of canelli beans.  Added chicken broth as the soup cooked so that it wouldn't be too think.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It was even better for lunch the next day.

A true Italian Minestrone!  Lots of subtle flavors, nothing overpowers.  Followed the recipe to a T.  Only difference was that I used 4 cups turkey broth instead of chicken broth and water.  Thank you Jamie.

I thought it was a great dish. My only comments are to double what it says for the broth because there isn't nearly enough and also if you want to add a little zip to the flavor I would suggest adding two tablespoons of hot sauce.

Wonderful! I was a little worried it would be bland, because I do love my spices and heat, but it was just lovely as written (though nearly anything can benefit from a bit of sriracha!). One thing to plan for is using way more liquid than called for - so perhaps buy some extra stock and an extra can of tomato sauce. The red wine really gave a subtle but necessary depth of flavor, so I recommend using it. This is the first veggie soup I've ever made, and it made my day! Thanks for sharing what will become my go-to cold-weather soup!

Nice and easy to make. I didn't adhere to the recipe 100% (because I didn't have all the ingredients), but it was a hit all the same. Next time I'll make sure to get everything I need.

At first, I thought it was going to be bland but the flavors developed at the end of the cooking process. I still added some extra garlic and cayenne pepper. This is a very good minestrone recipe, although it seems to be missing a real Italian flair. Maybe it was because I didn't have fresh oregano and used dry? I will use this recipe again anyway! Oh and and the other reviewers are right, this made a ton of soup, even if I skipped celery and only used 3 carrots and two zucchinis... ETA: When reheated, this soup is totally worth 5 stars! My colleague raved about the wondeful smell. Even my cat, who usually despises human food, wanted to try some... If that doesn't say something!

Delicious and so easy!  I tweaked slightly for what I had on hand & made it vegitarian:  A little less tomato sauce; vegie broth instead of chick broth (no extra water); lots of extra fresh basil.  This is a new favorite and I will make again soon.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I have made this more times than I can count and just realized that I have never reviewed it.  I follow it to the letter, why mess with perfection?  The tip for the pasta is a bonus.  Thank you so much Jamie for sharing your creativity with us!

This is a fantastic soup!  It's so versatile, because you can use whatever veggies you have on hand.  I didn't have celery, so I just used more carrot.  I threw in a can of chickpeas that I had on hand.  Even the kids really liked it.  I halved the recipe and still had way too much for a family of 5!

Very good soup! I used all canned veggies as a timesaver. I am sure it is better with fresh veggies, but delicous and fast with canned.

Just wonderful! I made it vegetarian by replacing the chicken broth with vegi broth. I also added frozen lima beans and corn. My boyfriend who is not usually a fan of soups had seconds!
Thanks so much...this is certainly a keeper!

This soup recipe was stellar.  To save time, I put the macaroni right into the soup pot, but this was a big mistake.  When we had the soup for leftovers the next day, the pasta had soaked up all of the liquid and was bloated and mushy.  It is a very delicious soup, I will definitely make it again.

This is such a great recipe!  I made as if with the exception of:  I added 4 cups of broth instead of 2 cups broth & 2 cups water.  (I made the broth with vegetarian bouillon cubes.)  Also I added 1 pkg. of Boca Crumbles (fake hamburger) to add protein.  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil instead of fresh.  The flavor of this is unbelieveable--I say it rivals that in restaurants!  Thanks so much Jamie!

Your search is OVER! Oh my GOSH! This is absolutely outstanding! When I make this I double the recipe, making leftovers. This freezes well too. I made this for some guys my husband brought home from work. I was a little nervous about using the batch I had frozen, but it was perfect. The guys were still talking about it at work 3 days later! I make no changes to this recipe, perfect as is.

Delicious! I made some slight changes, I used just 2 zucchini's, doubled the chicken broth, added drained diced tomatoes, and doubled the spices.  This was really tasty with fresh bread, very hearty.

I had my doubts while I was cooking this, but this soup turned out FABULOUS.  I didn't have the issues others did with it being too thick, either.  *Changes*  I used  1 can tomato paste + 1 1/2 cans of water per cup of tomato sauce called for.  I also subbed potato for zucchini since I sadly had none.  I also used white wine instead of red, added an extra can of kidney beans and omitted the green beans. Like another user, I did not use pasta.  I might add some in for my husband if he wants it so it's more hearty.  Otherwise I followed the directions and ended up with a HUGE but wonderful batch of Minestrone.  This puts Olive garden on a run for it's money!

This turned out pretty good.  I think that the carrots and celery need to be sauteed a little longer before the other ingredients are added, because I had to let the soup simmer for about 1 1/2 hours so they were soft enough.  By then, my zucchini had turned to mush.  I thought it was tasty, though.  Especially for being so healthy!

This recipe was wonderful but I made a few changes. I used all chicken broth and no water and I used dry spices instead of fresh. Also, I added shrimp and scallops the last few minutes of cooking. I will definitely make this dish again.

My soup came out more like a stew (very little liquid).  I cut all of the ingredients in half except the chicken broth, and I left it alone, and it still came out with very little liquid in the end.  The broth was also more tomato-y that I like with a Minestrone.  I think next time I'll find a recipe with a white wine broth and no tomato sauce.

This soup is phenomenal. It's good warm or cold, and is super easy to make. I didn't change a thing except adding 2 cups of pasta instead of one, as well as an extra cup of chicken stock.

I added chopped cabbage, an envelope of dry onion soup mix and substituted cooked carrots and frozen peas for the broccoli. The 2nd day the taste was much better.

This is a very good, healthy soup. My husband and I enjoyed the flavor and although our 4 kids (7,6,3&2) ate it, they didn't care for all the vegetables :-). I used fresh green beans and frozen spinach.  I would not add any spinach at all the next time.  And I did add a bit of cauliflour.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is a really great soup.  I don't exactly know the difference between minestrone and a vegetable soup (maybe the pasta?), but either way, it turned out really yummy.  The only differences were that I halved the recipe, omitted the spinach (didn't have any) and used dried herbs rather than fresh.  I also added some diced potatoes.  It was a great meal with bread and a salad!

Very delicious!  I used the bones of this recipe to make my own version: substituted extra can of chicken broth for water and cabbage for spinach, added can of navy beans, diced potatos, and one chopped tomato.  Also added 1/2 cup parmesan/romano to the pot.  Didn't have fresh herbs so I used 1 tsp Italian seasoning.

This was excellent!  I halved the recipe but still had enough for 2 meals.  Added a can of stewed tomatoes and changed up beans as suggested in other reviews.  I'm not a very good cook and this turned out great - foolproof!

Like this recipe needs anyone else to get on here and say, "Oh, how terrific!" But I thought I'd throw my compliments into the pot as well. SO good! Better than I've had at nice Italian restaurants ... and I made it!!

Absolutely Delicious!  Like others I used a can of canelli beans as well as kidney.  Also used fresh green beans - like the firmer texture.  If the base of the soup is not spicy enough, add some dried onion soup mix to taste.  Will definately make again!

Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum!!!  Soooo good, even my 5 year old ate 2 bowls!  I used all chicken stock, no green beans, and added a can of cannellini beans along with the kidney beans.  Cooked the pasta seperate as directed.  We will be having this often - even this summer!!!

This recipe is great! I make it as-is and even my meat-loving hubby who thinks it's not a "meal" unless meat is the main course will happily eat it for dinner with a side of toasted garlic french bread. DON'T skip out on the red wine, though. It's SO worth it. Really adds that extra richness to the flavor. I skipped on it a couple times and it was like a completely different soup! :(

Went a different route and cut out the pasta and beans, replacing with cup of lentils, did not use chicken broth, only tomato sauce which was added after lentils were tender. Blended at the end. AWESOME!

I thought this had great potential when I started it, but it was disapointing! It was just really bland. It made a big serving, and I sure won't be eating the leftovers.

This recipe was great! Just what I was looking for!  I did not use the wine, and used elbow noodles instead.  I also used a lot more garlic than called for.  I actually made a large batch and froze it in small containers, and I eat it for lunch all the time!  I'm planning on making more next week so I can stock up my freezer!

well i am now on my second day of the soup and these are my recommendations.  a whole bag of spinich, sweet chili sauce (you know from your local thai restaruant) add the beans towards the end and seasonal vegatables.  and you have a great soup for a week or more

A wonderful soup. I too used 4 cups of chicken broth and omitted the water. I also used dried herbs, more than doubled the pasta, and added a can of garbanzo beans. I served it with a freshly baked sourdough baguette. It was delicious! I'll definitely make it again, although with even more beans.

This should be called hearty vegetable soup or a summer minestrone. Very light and not rich enough in flavor to be called minestrone. It is a perfect lunch.

This turned out great following the directions as given.  It also turned out great using beef broth instead of chicken and adding some frozen meatballs during the last 25 minutes!  Thanks for the great recipe.

My grocery store was out of baby spinach so I bought a can of canned spinach, drained and squeezed the water out of it, added it but scooped most of it out, I was terribly afraid it would wreck my soup. This soup was awesome.  Added my pasta at the end to cook in the broth.  I would have added more kidney beans.

Loved it! I like beans so I doubled the beans, but it is great as-is.

An excellent soup. My dad loves the minestrone soup at our local resturante, but after trying this one he says he'll never go back! Very flavorful and something the whole family enjoyed!

I thought this was good, but the leftovers didn't taste very good, the noodles absorbed all the liquid.

Thank you Jamie, I can't believe that I waited so long to make this. This soup is the BEST!! My family of five (all being males except me) raved about this soup. I thought that they used a straw because they just inhaled it. I did add the red wine and I think this is the key to the wonderful flavor. I substituted cannelli beans for the red kidney beans and kept everything else the same. This will be a regular request at our house.

This recipe makes a great minestrone! The only thing I added was garbanzos, because I love them. It made a ton! More like 10-12 servings! I stored the pasta seperate from the soup when I put it in the fridge, it keeps the pasta from getting too soft. We ate it for a week, and it tasted fresh everytime!

This soup is FABULOUS!  I made it for a family get together and everyone loved it.  I made this a day ahead so that the flavors could blend, and surprisingly enough, the soup was better the first day.  I used an inexpensive Burgundy wine and that added a robust flavor that my other Minestrone stand by was lacking.  This is my new favorite Minestone!  Thanks for posting!

VERY good, will make again!! Important note, if you're going to add the pasta in to cook with the rest of the soup at the end, add extra liquid to make up for it.  I added more pasta than called for, which was great, but it was way too thick.  And the fresh basil really adds so much, so don't skimp on it like I almost did.  I would even add this recipe to my "company worthy" file.  Enjoy :)

This is the best Minestone I've ever had!! Fresh herbs & good wine make for an amazing soup. I used 2 cups of tomato sauce & 1 lg can of whole peeled tomatoes that I crushed by hand with the juice from the can and used 1/3 cup of wine. Use organic produce if you can, the taste is superior.

Great easy recipe.  I substituted tomato juice and more broth for the tomato sauce and water.  I simmered the soup 90 minutes and cooked the pasta in the simmering broth the last few minutes before serving.

In answer to the pasta dilemma--I used orzo (just threw it in)--it held up well and froze well.

We have never been much for eating soup, but this recipe changed our minds.  I changed the recipe a little, but this is an awesome base recipe.  I substituted cabbage for the spinach and added 2 more cups of water.  I also omitted the fresh oregano and basil for dried berbs -  1TB. Herbs de Provence and 1Tb. Basil, as well as adding a lot more pasta.  I served with Sunflower and flax seed wheat rolls - what a healthy meal.    Great recipe - Thanks Jaime!

This one's a keeper! I got rave reviews from my boyfriend and neighbor, and I love it, too.  I followed the recipe except I added potatos instead of zucchini (I didn't have any) and 3 cups of tomato sauce instead of 4 (because I ran out). I also omitted the oregano because I didn't have any on hand, and added 4 bay leaves instead. It still came out delicious!

This soup is excellent. The only change I did was add about 1 cup of red wine instead of the amount listed. This soup is very easy to make and really affordable. This is definitely at the top of the rotation.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I didn't go exactly by the recipe but the taste of the broth is the base and then you just do whatever you want as far as adding veggies.  I put chicken broth, vegetable broth (instead of plain water), stewed Italian tomatoes (instead of sauce), onion, and seasonings adding more garlic in my slow cooker, let it cook all day long to marry the seasonings.  Last two hours of cooking I added some frozen mix with carrots, etc. Let that heat through, added couple cans of beans then the last hour added some pasta.  Turned out superb except hubby did mention he would prefer more broth but that is easy to fix.  Great meal we had served with grilled toast points.

I am sure that there are other excellent minestrone recipes at this site, but I finally chose this one and it did indeed live up to all the expectations! I did make it a day ahead due to my schedule, and yes, it is better the second day!  I added quite a bit more broth and a little more red wine.  Next time I am going to add the kidney beans much later in the simmering or even on the second day because they were quite mushy (the green beans were fine).  I also added some Italian sausage that I had cut into small slices and then browned, and that added some good flavor and pleases the carnivores.  I also added garbanzo beans which I love.  Next time I will add a little more of the herbs and garlic, just for kicks, and I may add some chopped canned tomatoes.  It worked out so well that I am gong to serve it for a dinner party this Sunday.  Thanks! (P.S. Except for the sodium, which you can reduce with low-sodium or homemade broth and by rinsing the canned veggies, this is a very healthful soup!  Lots of fiber, low fat, and many vitamins and anti-oxidants and lycopenes.)

This recipe isnt exactly the "authentic" minestrone I was looking for. I cut back on some of the veggies and added some more seasoning, but it was not very rich and was semi bland. Certainly better the next day, but I will look for another minestrone recipe to try.

everyone in my family loved this soup.  the only thing i would do different the next time i make it is to increase the amount of spice as well as add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  This soup has made it into my recipe box.

Excellent! Served to a crowd and they all loved it. The only thing I changed was to add a can of petite diced tomatoes (to lengthen it) and a can of vegetable broth toward the end so it was not quite so thick. Will definetly make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This soup is very yummie tomato based soup.  I added 1 shot of Worcestishire sauce like other reviewers mentioned and it spiced it up, excellent idea.  Since I did not want to eat it with pasta, I just added 2 cubed smaller potatoes into it after the liquid came to a boil and I used veggie broth instead of chicken to keep it 100% vegetarian. I cooked it for 1 hour after all ingredients were in there but the carrots and the celery could have cooked longer.  They were eatable but had a slight crunch to them. Maybe next time I have to chop them into smaller cubes. I also cooked it on medium low after boiling because I just wanted it to get done faster.  I think if I cooked it for 1.5 hours it would have been perfect.  Next time I will add the parmesan cheese at the end.  This soup uses up a big pot and I definitely will have to freeze a lot of it, but that's ok, at least I don't have to make it from scrach for a while.  I highly recommend this soup.  Enjoy!

This recipe is great.  I omitted the pasta and added a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano.  I think I will add more chicken or vegetable broth next time because it was very thick.  One important thing I found was that the cooking time was not nearly long enough.  I simmered the soup about 2 hours rather than 30-40 minutes.  My vegetables were not near cooked after 30 minutes.  My family loved this soup - I will definitely make it again!

The kids loved it.  I added extra spinach and carrots and skipped the red wine.  Too much zucchini for us and we deleted the pasta.  Next time I might use the correct chix broth/water because I took other's suggestions and it was very saucy.

This recipe is great, however I amde a few changes. To make it vegetarian I used vegetable broth, but after it had simmered most of the broth was gone so I ended up using a second can. It was delicious! Before we put the leftovers in the refrigerator, we added the noodles and today it is much better.

Yum Yum!  This is a keeper.  Soup was very tasty and it made me feel good knowing its all healthy and a good source of fiber!  It definitely was overflowing with veggies.  The only thing I did differently was add a few chopped potatoes. I think I'll add more chicken broth next time to give it a more "soupy" consistency.

Add me to the list of another cook more than satisfied with this minestrone recipe. For such simple ingredients it turns out delicious and smells SO good while simmering on the stove. I used 2-15oz and 1-8oz cans of tomato sauce and 1- 29oz can of diced tomatoes, about 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups of water. It took awhile for my carrots and celery to cook down so they weren't so crunchy even with sauting them first but that's because I didn't slice them real thin. The longer cooking time only made for an even better tasting soup! I didn't use the wine only because I didn't have any but will try it next time just to compare.  Also used dried oregano and basil for lack of having fresh and it tasted great, I can only imagine how good the fresh must be.  I used a can of cannelini beans, drained and rinsed, in place of the green beans. All the other ingredients stayed the same as the original recipe. We're so happy we've got leftovers of this delicious minestrone!  Thanks much for sharing this great recipe Jamie!

This was delicious!  Next time I make this I would add some red pepper flakes and a little more salt - it needs a little more seasoning. I did add the wine and it definitely adds to the flavor of the soup - and I added fresh green beans - not canned - they would have gotten too soft. There is a lot of slicing in this recipe and I found that my mandoline really did the job very well for me - much quicker than if I did it with a knife and much more consistent size slices of veggies!!!!!

This is excellent.  I cut the recipe in half, and let it simmer for a couple of hours.  I used all the ingredients, but did use a whole can of kidney beans because I didn't know what I would do with the leftovers.  There isn't much broth, it's hugely thick, but the flavor is excellent and I highly recommend it for a cold day.  (Also a bonus, no meat and basic ingredients make it very convenient, and very thrifty to make. I think I spent less than 5 bucks for the whole pot)

This was a great recipe.  I also took the advise of some others and used canned tomatos instead of the tomato sauce and put some yellow squash in also and frozen green beans instead of canned.  My 5 year old loved it. Thanks!

This was a very good minestrone!  The only changes I made were to use diced tomatoes instead of the sauce, fresh grean beans, added some broccoli in addition to the other veggies, and then I totally forgot about adding pasta at the end until we were sitting down to eat and it was too late.  (I would have used ditalini instead of shells, though.)  It still turned out delicious - I'm adding it to my tried-and-true recipe box!

This was delicious!! I only changed a couple of things: I added a can of cannelini beans in addition to the kidney beans, and I used 4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth and ommitted the water. Turned out excellent, and is even more flavorful the second day! Thanks Jamie!

This soup is great!  I was also cooking up some stock for another soup and I took the left over  vegitables, blended them, and added them to this recipe.  Made for a thicker, heartier soup.  My two year old nephew loved it.

I always thought I made a great minestrone...now with some of the additional ingredients found in this recipe, it is simply PERFECT!  The only significant change I made to this recipe was omitting the tomato sauce.  I used 1 16 oz can of diced tomatoes instead.  I then had to increase the wine and broth.  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thanks Jamie!

This soup has been a lifesaver!  I'm 2 months pregnant and soup has been one of my staples.  This one is healthy and delicious.  I make a huge pot and freeze it in single servings.  I did add a couple of yellow squash and increased the kidney beans.  Thanks!

Made this for an Italian dinner with friends - everyone asked for this recipe, and no one asked for anything else we made!  I doctored it like others did - chicken broth, no water, Italian diced tomatoes, extra liquid, one yellow squash, etc.  The spinach looks so soggy, I'll skip that next time. Adding the pasta to the soup thickens it too much - next time I'll keep it separate like Jamie says.  Made it 2 days ahead of time, cooking it until the carrots were done.

I first made this soup last spring.  It was my first attempt at homemade soup and I was very pleased with the results.  I have made the recipe several times and each time I am just as pleased.  When I make it, I freeze it in individual servings and use it for quick meals. I do two things differently than suggested: adding a can of corn and using frozen green beans instead of canned.  Highly recommended!  I pass the recipe on every time someone asks what I'm eating for lunch.

In a word FANTASTIC!  This soup is so easy to throw together the night before in the crock pot and what a great aroma greets you when you walk through the door. This is a regular meal for us in the winter.  Even my "not soup again" teens love it.  A must try!!

I have looked for a good homemade vegetable soup recipe for a long time.  I finally found one that tastes great!  I've made it several times and frozen it in individual bowls for quick meals.  I added corn and used frozen green beans instead of the suggested canned.

This is a wonderful, hearty recipe. I left out the red wine b/c I didn't have any on hand and it was still really tasty.  It also makes enough for an army that hasn't eaten for two weeks.

This soup was fabulous.  I've never been a big minestrone fan but was looking for a way to get more veggies in my diet so tried this.  Even my picky husband loved it.  Will definately make this again.  The only change I made was slightly less celery and I like smaller pasta so used Ditalini instead of shells.  Terrific!

My whole family adored this soup!  It was truly fabulous.  Tangy, just the tiniest bit sweet, and lots of flavors/textures.  I added almost double the pasta, though.  Next time, I'm going to try it in my crockpot to give the flavors plenty of time to get to know each other.

My husband and I loved this soup! It was more like a vegetable stew than a soup.  I did substitute 1 can of diced tomatoes and a large can of crushed tomatoes for the sauce. I also added 1 can of cannelini beans as well as a can of garbanzo beans to the recipe. It was easy to make and I will make it again before the weather turns warm!

Make this soup the day before for optimum flavor.  Don't leave out the spinach and zucchini - they add so much class and flavor.  I cooked the pasta in the soup at the end of the cooking time.  I liked the way it thickened it up. Great recipe!!!

I added three different kinds of beans to this soup, as well as a can of seasoned diced tomatoes and a can of corn.  We loved it -- I'm sure I'll make this a lot this winter.

Absolutely delicious and versatile, too!  I omitted the spinach & zucchinis, substituting 3 cups of chopped potatoes, along with dried herbs instead.  Tastes even better the next day!  Good idea to sautee crunchy vegetables (carrots, celery, potatoes) first in some water for about 20 minutes before adding other ingredients to ensure they're cooked through.  One of the best soup recipes I have . . . . . . Thanks, Jamie!  This gets 9 out of 10 stars!

This soup is absolutely wonderful.  Although I didn't have any fresh basil and oregano, I just added extra of the dried.  It turned out sooooo good.  I can't wait to make it for company, for it is sure to be a hit!!  My 10 year old son begged for me to let him take it for lunch for two days straight.  Thank you Jamie!! A job well done!!

I didn’t use any wine and substituted vegetable base for chicken broth. I sautéed the carrots, celery and onion before adding the garlic, because garlic burns too quickly.

Didn't really like the taste.  Used 5 cloves garlic.  1 tsp dried each of oregano and basil, 1/4 c red wine had in frig., and Home-style pasta (Vita sana Fusilli), that Robert liked.  Hadn't added green beans.   Hadn't added salt or pepper, because used 1 tsp Herbamare, but added some more at table.
Needed more flavour.

This recipe was a disappointment made as written. Way too much tomato sauce and way too thick. Not what I would call an authentic Italian minestrone. Will not make again.

I'm not sure how this has so many good ratings - I just made it exactly like the recipe says (without the wine) it was absolutely inedible.  

I think the problem was the tomato sauce - maybe he doesn't mean 'tomato sauce/ketchup' I only put 2 cups not the 4 and it still tasted like vinegar, my house still smells like vinegar... DO NOT 'simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, the longer the better' because it turned to slosh... so disappointed. :/

Good basic soup but I had to add a lot of dry basil and oregano to really amp up the flavour and give it thatminestrone taste.

My family loved this. It was easy to prepare. The only changes I made were due to things I had on hand. I didn't have zucchini but used all the other vegetables. I only had one small can of tomato sauce, so I used that plus two cans of tomato paste and 1 quart of home bottled stewed tomatoes. I didn't have small shells so I used penne pasta and it was fine. It made a lot but that's ok because we'll either eat the leftovers or I'll freeze some. I made some garlic/cheese bread to go with it and it was all great. Thank you.

I modified it by using beef broth and no water, a can of diced tomatoes, frozen spinach, and whole wheat pasta shells. I also added a pinch of chili and cayanne for some heat. It turned out hearty and great! Enjoy with some hot french bread.

Very good.  I used Dilatini pasta and too much of it (my fault) and it sucked up all the liquid. Had to use much more chicken stock. About 8 cups in total. Makes a ton of soup too.

YUM!! These five star ratings are right on! I doubled the recipe to bring some to a friend and really didn't need to double it. I nearly overflowed my pressure cooker with the doubled recipe! I have an 8 quart electric pressure cooker and started this recipe (with the lid off) on brown rice, to sauté the onions and garlic until they were soft. Then added everything else besides the pasta, green beans, and spinach and set it for the soup function (16 minutes). I quick-released the pressure and added the pasta (I used ditalini). I used manual pressure cook time of 4 minutes, once again quick-released the pressure and added the green beans and spinach. Gave it a minute or two for the spinach to wilt and it was complete! The Parmesan finish is a must!! Delicious!

This is a very good minestrone,  I made it exactly as directed but next time I will use only 2 cups of tomato sauce and add one can of diced tomatoes, which I like.   My granddaughter ( a vegetarian) loved it but agreed on the extra can tomatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious flavor! My only complaint is that it doesn't have enough liquid at the end, after simmering for so long. Next time I will add more broth and tomato sauce. Other than that though, fantastic recipe!

This soup is hearty and delicious!  It's so easy to make and very versatile... add cabbage, garbanzo beans, etc.  Topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese and accompanied with some crusty bread... one word: Heaven!

Needed a more soup like consistency. I think it could be really good cutting tomato sauce in half and increasing chicken broth and pasta.

Excellent!  I made the pasta in a separate pot and added it directly to the soup.  We didn't eat right away and the pasta really soaked up the broth and doubled in size.  Stick to the amount of pasta the recipe suggests.  It seems like a little, but if you do what I did and let it sit, it is the perfect amount of pasta for this soup!

Love it! I didn't have fresh herbs, so I used 1 tsp. dried oregano and 1tsp. dried basil. The fresh veggies make it special. I will be serving this again!

Excellent! Love this soup. I also added a pinch of celery seeds and a packet of chicken stock to the broth. I used boiling onions instead of regular onions because I feel they give the soup a better taste( ratio of about 5 boiling onions to one medium onion) I add these to all my soups

Great basic delish minestrone,  just what I was craving! I didn't really change it, just added some more vegetables, cannelini beans and my trusty Spike seasoning. I did use the wine. I loved it, will make often as my 3 year old gobbled it up!

I love this soup. It's my #1 WW recipe for 2 points or less. I usually use 1 28oz can of tomatoes and a small tomato paste. That's usually what I have on hand. It doesn't change the outcome.  I also add a tbsp of hot pepper flakes as a personal preference. The parm cheese is a must!  Thanks for a quick and easy, healthy recipe.  I make it often.

My hubby doesn't like soup, especially any soup without meat in it, and he dubbed this the best minestrone soup he's ever had!  I only used 1 onion and left out the zucchini, as I didn't have any on hand, and it was so good!  Super easy to put together and then let simmer as I baked up a fresh loaf of bread to serve with it.  I love having the noodles separate so they didn't get soggy.  Don't know why I haven't thought of that before!  Thanks for the amazing recipe!!!

I make this a few times a year.  I follow the recipe exactly, but I rarely have fresh herbs so I use dried.  It is my go to soup! I forgot once to add the pasta and now I don't even miss it! Sometimes I add potatoes or different veggies.  It's always great.  It's really a no-fail recipe.

Tastes like the soup you can get at an Italian restaurant, great, easy recipe. Changes I made: added a can if diced tomatoes in addition to the tomato sauce. Used whole wheat fusilli noodles, and omitted the cheese and wine. I get my groceries at trader joes and they have pre-chopped onions, carrots, and celery, which made the process simple. Also used dried basil and oregano it tasted fine. Will def make

This hit the spot! Here are my adjustments: 1 can petite diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce with one large box of low sodium vegetable stock. I also used cabbage instead of spinach because it seems more traditional to me. And I used white cannelini or great northern beans. The beans should be white IMHO. I also added a rind of parmesean Reggiano to add a bit more depth. And I didn't have fresh oregano or basil so I used dried. Just be sure to add them to the oil after sautéing onions. This helps with the flavor. I added celery too. Was celery called for? Anyway, it's perfect. I love this so much!! I use cavatapi noodles which are hearty and fun. Thanks for the great recipe!

The best recipe. I made for my daughter and also cooked some mild Italian sausage to add to bowl with the pasta. I also added one can cannelloni beans. Everything else the same. Absolutely delicious!!

Fantastic! I used a combination of many of the suggestions that together turned out to make one of the best soups we've tried: I used about 46 oz. of chicken broth, no water, 2 cups of tomato sauce, about 3/4 cup of wine (half when the recipe tells you to and half near the end). I used dried spices, but probably ended up using about the same quantities of the dried that the recipe calls for in fresh. Otherwise this might be bland. I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper, not to make it hot, but rather to bring out the flavors. oh, and I chose not to use any kind of bean other than the green.

I have now made this twice exactly as written. This makes a very hearty soup, loaded with vegetables. If you're looking for something with lots of broth, this isn't it. I usually add a little extra chicken broth and tomato sauce as needed just to give this soup a little more broth. The flavor is as good if not better than what you can get at the local Italian eateries. I would not change a thing in this.

This was great, I especially love the idea of cooking the pasta separately. I have never liked the pasta being overcooked. I also cut the carrots large size so they weren't overcooked either. Cooking pasta separately was the best!

This was a great recipe, but I made a few changes. I added corn and I put pasta directly into the pot of soup to cook so it would soak up all the flavor of the soup. I also used 4 cups of chicken stock to replace the 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups water.I will make this over and over this winter.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and it's delicious! Yesterday I followed it almost to the letter, except I made it in the slow cooker. I first sauteed the onion, celery and carrots as directed. I added the garlic closer to the end of sauteeing, instead of the beginning, since garlic can burn easily. Then I dumped this mixture into the slow cooker along with all the remaining ingredients except for the spinach and the pasta, and let it cook for about 4 hours. I used vegetable broth to make it vegan. I added the spinach near serving time and let it wilt. Pasta is cooked separately, because if you cook it with the soup, it will suck up all the broth. I used small whole wheat shells and it was delicious. This recipe is very adaptable. You can use whatever veggies you have on hand. It makes an excellent and healthy vegetarian meal served with some whole grain garlic bread and maybe a salad.

This is the second time I am making this soup.  Tonight I am trying it with sweet potato to change it up.  Last time I added fresh tomatoes at the end because I love tomatoes!  This recipe will be a regular addition to my dinners.

An excellent, very flexible recipe.  I ended up with a "stoup" with not enough liquid, so I added another can of chicken broth and another can of water. You may want to add more tomato sauce after this, but I thought the broth was fine with out more.  I cooked the pasta in the soup rather than separately which resulted in almost too soft pasta.   Probably should have stayed with the recipe on that one!  I will be making this again. Thanks!

Loved  this recipe. We made a few changes but nothing major. Added a can of diced tomatos. Used 2 cans of kidney beans. Three cups of chicken broth. I used dried spices 1T basil 1/2T oregano because I didn't have fresh. I did not add the wine we didn't have any. Used 1 cup uncooked small shell pasta. Cooked seperate and added right before serving. Overall this was an awesome soup we will be making this again.

This recipe was awesome!  I never rate recipes but I couldn't help but rate this one. I used fresh veggies from the garden. I added some yellow squash and fresh tomatoes. I also added more spinach and had some rosemary/olive oil bread with it. Delicious!

Wonderful basic recipe exactly how it is.  You can add more veggies if you want to or make some slight changes depending on how you feel.  I have made this at least 10 times now and it is still a family favorite!

This was very tasty! Easy to play around with. Like a few other reviewers, I used 4 cups of broth. I also used one can of tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice (undrained). Also, I pureed about 2 cups of the mixture (before adding pasta) to thicken it a little. Super easy and so healthy and full of veggies! I'll definitely make it again!

WOW!!! This was awesome soup!! Both my hubby and my wee man gobbled this up :)  I followed this exactly (which is not like me) but after reading all the reviews, I thought I'd play by the rules and glad I did. Cooked the macaroni at the end, put a few tbsp in a bowl then poured the soup over top and YUMMM...  THANK YOU for this recipe!

Fantastic soup recipe - definitely a keeper. Tastes so healthy and delicious. I didn't have much tomato sauce but instead added 4 cans of diced tomatos without problem. Yum Yum!

Made this for a work potluck. Everyone that tried it said they loved it. The red wine I felt really did give it that little extra flavoring that it was lacking before it was added.

Tomato sauce made this MUCH too tangy/sour for my taste.  Also, it sort of glops onto the vegetables if you simmer it as long as needed to remove some of the acidity.  I would use crushed tomatoes instead next time and increase the water/broth combination a bit to ensure soupy consistency.

Very very nice recipe!  Only reason for ranking a 4 was based on personal taste preferences as I found the broth to be a little lacking in flavor.  Note to self:  substitute a mixture of diced tomatoes, tomato juice and/or paste for sauce, canninoli beans for kidney, frozen or fresh green beans vs canned, and then add a chunk of parm cheese rind.  Everything else is great.

Yum yum yummy! I used fresh parsley (since it was the only fresh herb I had left) and seasoned tomato sauce. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

Yet another winner from this site. Extremely delicious, filling and healthy (if you use the parmigiana sparingly) and easy to make. I would say it took a good hour of simmering after adding all the vegetables. Don't skip the little drizzle of olive oil in the bowl before serving. It really adds some richness to the broth.

This is a terrific soup recipe easily tailored to your families' particular tastes.  Changing the vegetables, beans, and to some extent, the seasonings, does not take away from the basic goodness of this recipe.  My husband declared it "outstanding" several times through the course of our meal.  If you are looking for ways to cut down on your consumption of meat, this soup is a hearty option!

We finally had this the other day and we really enjoyed it. I found that it was hard to make some of the portion because it seemed like a waste of a can, so we actually used all the chicken broth in place of some tomato sauce and it wasn't bad.

Used canned diced tomatoes instead of sauce and whole can of kidney beans. This was easy and definitely better than any canned or packaged soup.

I followed the recipe to a "T" including the optional wine.  It was just ok, I'm going to continue to search for a minestrone soup recipe.  The carrots weren't done and the broth didn't have a great flavor.

I think it was OKAY but it was lacking seasoning.  I added 2 bay leaves, Old bay seasoning (about 1tbsp), omitted water, only used Chicken Broth, did not spray with olive oil, I don't think that's necessary and added 2 cups of chopped chicken.

Followed everything except the green beans. I used white beans instead. I diluted it with a little more broth at the end after it cooked down a bit to thin it out. I thought it had really great flavor as directed and didn't need any extra herbs. Served with some wonderful California style sourdough bread and butter and it was a hearty meal on the first day of Fall! Very good! Will make again.

This was great!  I made it for my 9 yr. old who loves minestrone.  I usually don't care for it, but this recipe was so delicious.  I used 3 c. tomato sauce, 2 c. chicken broth, and 3 c. water (to further reduce the sodium a bit), and it was very flavorful still.  I used canellini (white kidney) beans and extra zucchini in place of green beans.  A recipe like this leaves room for substitutions, IMHO.  I didn't have red wine, so I didn't use it.  I also used less olive oil in a non-stick pan to lower the calorie count.  If you serve 8 with this recipe, they will be very large servings.  I thought it could serve 16 if you had bread and salad or something similar.  I froze some, so hopefully it will defrost well.  I'll update how that goes when I get around to using it.

This was an amazing soup!!! I altered the recipe slightly and added 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water (to cut down the taste of the tomato, and thin the soup. I also added a can of chili beans with 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder to give it more of a kick. Since i did not have fresh oregano, i used 1 tablespoon of dried oregano. I even added a couple of potatoes. My whole family enjoyed this soup, and in fact i am enjoying a bowl of it as i am typing. my helpful tip would be to make sure you cut the potato and zucchini into small pieces (you do not want them to be too big). Overall this was a delicious soup and i will make this again and again.  Thanks Jamie!!!

So I changed the recipes. Had no celery. Used a whole large can of chicken broth, can of paste, and a soda can sized V8. Added chicken chunks and no beans but I really wished I had some white beans in there. I loved the zucchini in there. Parmesan on top is a must!

Delicious!  As with other reviewers, I added more garlic (we love it, so I added a lot to our taste).  For the liquid, I ended up adding a total of 4 cups of chicken broth, a cup of veggie broth that I had and a cup of water and I replaced one cup of sauce for diced tomatoes undrained.  Without the extra liquid, it would have been much more of a thick stew than a brothy soup.  I also skipped the pasta and just had it as a tomato based vegetable soup.  Oh, one last thing...I only added the spinach for the last 10 minutes of simmering.  I think longer than that would have been too much for the delicate baby spinach leaves.

This recipe makes a LOT of soup.  Be prepared to cut the recipe down or have lots of leftovers.  I put some in the freezer for another day! :)

Excellent! Used low sodium chicken broth and still didn't need any additional salt. I sauteed the garlic, onions, carrots and celery all together. Subbed white kidney beans for green beans because I don't like them. Also used about 1 cup of pasta and dried herbs because that's what I had. I did not spray olive oil on it. It was delicious and stock full of veggies, a definite keeper!

This ministrone has a great flavor. I was forced to adapt the recipe slightly as i felt the ration of tomatoe sauce:water:chicken broth was slightly high for my taste (reduced tomatoe sauce by 1 cup and water by 1/2 cup). For vegtarians the chicken broth can be substitued by a mushroom broth without any affect on the taste. 

Jaime, congratulations and thanks, there is nothing better than a well presented and tasteful recipe!

Regrads from Switzerland,
Michael

Outstanding recipe.  This will replace all of my Minestrone soup recipes.  Made exactly as stated with minor change.

Only used 2 cups of tomato sauce and added 1 can diced tomatoes roasted.  Increased chicken broth to 3 cups for more juice.  I did use wine.

Thanks Jamie for taking the time to share.  Love it.

Awesome recipe!! I adjusted a few items to meet our family's taste. Instead of tomato sauce, I used canned tomatoes with green chilies to give it a little kick. I also added cheese tortellini instead of regular pasta. Additionally, I added 2 T fresh cilantro.

It states that the red wine is optional, but I would not skip it! It adds such depth to the flavor!

So much goodness in one bowl!  I used chopped tomatoes and it was great!  Minestrone was never really my favorite soup option, but I find myself craving more of this version!  Makes a ton, so we had guests over and they loved it as well.  Next time I will try freezing it, so wonderful!

This is a great recipe!  A few suggestions though - I used fresh cooked beans, not canned; I used frozen green beans, not canned; I left out the zucchini (don't like it, thought it'd be mushy anyway); and I added chickpeas (a must for minestrone!).  These changes made for a great soup!  In general, this is a great starter recipe, but the proportions of the veggies can be adjusted to your preferences.  I also used minced garlic and dried herbs instead of the fresh --- still turned out great!

Oh My Gooses!!  This is da bomb! I hosted a luncheon at my place after church and knew I wanted an Italian theme but would not have time to make this all in one day.  So I made everything but pasta the night before and when I left for church put it in a crock pot on warm and then made the pasta right before lunch was served and it was a huge hit!  Everyone there asked for this recipe.  This is one of those foods that does great the next day!  Two thumbs up!!!  I did not add water but used all chicken broth instead.

Excellent!  Lots of chopping - but makes a ton of soup.  Loved the red wine addition.  Had leftover penne pasta (cooked), so just cut some of those in 1/2 and added!  Also, used low sodium chicken broth and tomato sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

I substituted white wine for red, as I'm not a red wine drinker, and added some grilled chicken breasts for a little more protein. The Parmesan cheese really finishes this off nicely. This was a hit with everyone, and was great the next day!

This went over really well with my family.  5 out of 6 approved!!

Changes Made:  Omitted the water and used a 48oz carton of broth.  Otherwise there would not be enough liquid.  I also upped the pasta to 1 cup - ditalini not shells, could have probably used a little bit more but it wasn't lacking.  We just like a lot of pasta.

Next time will add corn, use 1/2 the zucchini called for and add some potatoes.  Personal preference but tastes great with the veggies called for.

Perfect flavor and makes enough for 12 with second and possibly third servings.

I recently had freshly made minestrone in a pizzeria.  It was so delicious that i went on a hunt for something like it on Allrecipe.  I found this one and made it several times in two weeks and i will make it again and again. This is the best! I basically kept it as is just used collard greens instead of spinach.  This is the BEST !!!

Omitted carrots and celery. Added broccoli, pepper flakes, tofu, baby corn, dried Italian spices, and three bay leaves. I added more chicken broth instead of using water. I sauteed the onion and garlic with tofu...yum! Next time, I will add green pepper and mushroom. Thanks for the recipe.

Jamie, this rocks!  I, too, like almost everyone else, made slight modifications -- but not many.  I have a childhood aversion to cooked zucchini, so substituted one good-sized, peeled russet potato per the suggestion of another reviewer.  Simmered everything for closer to two hours and then covered, reduced heat and simmered for another two hours.  You're absolutely right:  the longer it simmers, the better it tasted.  Totally skipped steps 3 and 4; there's enough soup to feed 10 easily without the pasta.  Had it this morning for breakfast (couldn't help myself, the devil made me do it -- couldn't have it yesterday when I made it so this was the first time tasting) -- absolutely wonderful!  The flavors blend so beautifully; there's a certain sweetness that I'm thinking is the tomato sauce and the fresh basil.  I'll be passing this recipe along to a gluten-free friend of mine (without the pasta it's perfect) and to a couple of vegan friends.  The only thing they have to change is the broth.  Great recipe -- thank you so very much!  This is going to be winter necessity.

So delicious! It's now my new favorite.
Changes I made:
Didn't have zucchini's, sadly. 
Omitted green beans 
added pinto beans, black beans, and navy beans instead of kidney.
and I used red wine vinegar instead of red wine, which I thought made a huge and delicious difference.

Yummy! I added some veggies languishing in my vegetable drawer - green and orange pepper, broccoli stems; substitued can of crushed tomatoes for sauce and used 1 cup cabbage/1 cup spinach.  This recipe makes a LOT of soup - I put two containers in the freezer.

I made this on Sunday and it was fantastic!  Full of veggies, pasta, and beans!  So healthy!  I used low sodium chicken broth, and cannelinni beans (sp?), and probably 3 cups of water to get more broth, and cooked the pasta in the soup.  It was delicious.  Will definitely be made once a month - it makes A TON!

This was really good.  All I had was one cup of shredded frozen zucchini, but that worked well instead of the fresh (although I'm sure fresh would be outstanding, but we eat locally and organically so in Dec that is not an option for us).  And I had to use dried herbs instead of fresh.  I used 4 cups homemade chicken bone broth and 1 qt homemade organic tomato sauce and it was so good.  I would definitely make it again.  My husband did prefer it with ground beef mixed in.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I made a couple changes.  I'm quite sure this would have been terrific just as written, but I have a husband who wants a little meat in his soup, so I added some chicken and garlic sausage, and used four cups of chicken broth in place of the water, I also doubled the amount of sea shells pasta .  This is a keeper and I will not be looking any further for a great minestrone recipe!

Made this recipe exactly as written, and it is wonderful!!  Did use whole wheat pasta, but that wouldn't/didn't affect anything.  The parmesean cheese really makes a diference.  I just sprinkled it directly into the pot at the end, since i'll be reheating and eating this over a week or so.  It is very thick the next day so you could add some more chicken broth when making it.  But regardless...Fantastic!!

this is the best minestrone soup i have ever made! my husband kept saying how much he liked it. i used a whole carton of vegetable broth, whole can of kidney beans, 16 oz. bag of frozen green beans, i never have wine on hand so used some white cooking wine, and i added the cooked pasta at the end. didn't even notice on the recipe that was supposed to be added to individual dishes until i read the reviews. seemed fine. i always like a thinner broth soup but this was excellent. this will be my "go to"  minestrone soup from now on.

Loved this recipe.  Next time I will chop everything first before starting to cook.  I used 3 tsps of fresh minced garlic, 32 oz chicken broth, 4 cups of water, only 1- 28 oz can of tomato sauce, no wine, white kidney beans - which I added after a 1/2 hour of simmering, no spinach, a bag of frozen green beans and added cooked ground hamburger.  I let simmer for 2 hours on low and added the noodles right before serving.  I warmed it up for lunch and the noodles were perfect the next day.  Even my husband loved it...and he doesn't care for zucchini!

I just tried this, hoping to recreate the Olive Garden recipe.  It was wonderful!  I did substitute a quart of home-canned tomatoes for most of the tomato sauce, using only one small can of sauce.  I only had dried oregano, but with the fresh basil, it didn't seem to matter. I used one can each of red and white kidney beans. I used organic vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and water and omitted the green beans.   I'll make this over and over!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  I accidentally picked up white cannellini beans instead of red- worked fine. Added potatoes, kale, and a bay leaf.  Substituted 1 bunch parsley (no stems!) for the oregano and basil as the tomato sauce I used had oregano and basil already.  I also added a couple of chicken thighs with the skins for extra flavor.  It's  a pretty incredible soup, and the author gives us a wonderful base.

This is a must try recipe! Affordable and a great way to use up those extra garden zucchini and basil at the end of Summer! Even if you modify some of the veggies in this recipe you cannot go wrong. Excellent flavor and hearty!

This was so good! This was the most veggie packed minestrone soup I have every had! I had planned to freeze half of it for later but my husband and I had it three days in a row (2 dinners and 3 lunches)! It's a keeper.

I made this last night and was very pleased with the results.  I only added a bit of brown sugar and used less tomato sauce and added a can of whole tomatoes. I love a kick to my soups so I added a couple tablespoons of garlic/chili sauce.
Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing!!!  The only things I did different were I added a can of cannellini beans and used a cup and a half of noodles to make it go further.  This recipe is delicious and definitely deserves the high rating!  I'll be making this all winter!

Delicious.  I used beet leaves instead of spinach and fresh parsley instead of fresh basil as these were not handy.  I did not want a dairy dish so I left out the cheese.  I used dry Italian seasonings in place of some missing herbs.  It was deliciously amazing.  I did not use the wine but would be willing to try it.

Way too much tomato (and I didn't even put all of it in there).  Bland flavor, my husband never uses salt and had to smother the soup with it.  Not enough broth and no meat.  Other than that, I liked all the veggies in it and the cheese was a great touch.

great! i put all the ingredients in, EXCEPT instead of boiling the pasta seperately, i just threw it into the soup while it was simmering. The pasta shells came out PERFECT. I did estimate on the veggies because I personally love extra veggies. but other then that kept the same taste and all. WONDERFUL

This is a great, versatile base recipe!  I make it multiple times per year.  I usually make a large batch and freeze the leftovers.  It freezes beautifully as long as you skip the zucchini and spinach (it gets mushy).  Also, when freezing, I make sure not to include the pasta, because that gets mushy as well.  Instead of spinach and zucchini, i use cabbage.  Add balsamic when serving.  I use whatever beans I have in my pantry.  I will also use whatever tomato product I have in my pantry.  Fresh is always best, but I usually use dried basil and oregano.  Finally, I don't use any water, all low sodium stock and wine.

My 11 yr old son made this tonight.  We loved it.  I agree though, it did end up needing more chicken broth on it's own, though his needed even more because we tossed in lots of veggies.  Thanks!

This soup was absolutely PERFECT! The only thing I changed was instead of fresh oregano I used dry oregano but only because I didn't have fresh and added a little more chicken broth for more juice but other than that it was wonderful and I will be making this time and time again!! Thank you for the great recipe..

The end result is delicious, but only after some modifications.
First of all, I used about 35oz (1000g) of canned tomatoes instead of the sauce. I also used frozen spinach (250g), which in the finished soup I found to be kind of odd and out of place, even though it adds more nutritional value. I also used frozen green beans, and veggie stock instead of chicken.
I had to use *way* more water than called for. I think altogether it was about 1.5 liters (1.5 quarts), in addition to the broth. I have no idea how only 2 cups water plus the broth would be enough given the quantity of vegetables in the soup. Since I added more water, I also added more basil and oregano.

Overall this is a delicious soup. It makes a lot, so I am going to freeze about half of it.

Very nice, you could still taste the freshness from each veggie individually as well as this soup just tasting amazing.  the 2 cups of tomato sauce is a bit much so I actually used an extra cup of chicken broth and added some table wine and let it cook down a bit before.  I also browned some cubed steak and crumbled bacon and tossed that in to the mix...making it more of a vegetable beef than a minestrone but delicious none the same!

Left out green beans.  Changed the beans to kidney, canalleni and garbanzo, added great texture to soup.  Also I added additional chicken stock and used a can of homemade canned tomatoes with juice.

I've been trying to lose weight with weight watchers.  This soup is FANTASTIC.  With all the healthy fibers and vegetables the point value is low and the taste is superb.  I HIGHLY recommend the red wine, the wonderful additional character to this was great.  I made a double portion and ate all week.

Very good recipe.  I used all chicken broth instead of using half water, frozen green beans instead of canned, added a can of Italian diced tomatoes, used a whole can of beans instead of just a cup.  Also, three zucchinis seemed like way too much, so I cut back to two.  Thought it could use a little more macaroni.  Also seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and about a teaspoon of paprika.  Chopped the spinach up small to look like basil to fool the kids.

This is an amazing recipe.  I made a few slight changes, I did not add the water, just used extra broth, and I only had a can of mixed beans (kidney, romano, garbanzo, etc.) and used the whole can instead of only 1 cup. (worked out to almost 2 cups)  But the flavor was wonderful!  I will definately be making this again.

Awesome recipe. Very flavorful and basically a healthy meal. I made this pretty much to the recipe, except there are a LOT of veggies, and I like my soup with more broth. So I kept the veggie ratio the same (actually added a couple of more carrots) and added appr 6 more cups of broth to it- with a total of 10 cups- 6 cups chicken and 4 cups beef (I used no water), then seasoned to taste. It made enough to put several containers in the freezer. I will definitely make this again. Forgot- I also added two cans of low-sodium diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic.

Very good minestrone. A great basic recipe. As many of the reviewers- I substituted some of the veggies- I used fresh green beans, purple swiss chard along with the carrots and zucchini. (More prep time) My husband who's very picky about soups, he likes, gave it a positive review. This is a "keeper" recipe- so healthy and perfect for cold winter days.

YUM!!!  changed servings to 8.  only used 1 1/2 onions, and a handful frozen french style greenbeans and pink beans instead of Kidney.  LOVED it and so did my 3 kids.   Let it cook a good 45 minutes for full flavor.

This is an excellent recipe, easy to tailor to your liking.  I use vegetable stock to make it vegetarian and add a chopped potato too in with the carrot and celery.

This may very well be my all time favorite soup. I make it in huge batches and freeze it so I can eat it all winter. Excellent! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Fabulous!  I used dried oregano & basil instead of fresh.  I did add the half cup of red wine and I think it really brought out the depth of the flavor.  I also used Ditalini pasta instead of seashell.  The house smelled wonderful while this was simmering and I couldn't wait to taste it.  Definitely was not disappointed!

Hello fellow reviewers! Made this for dinner tonight. I must admit, I enjoyed this more than my fiance did (but that doesn't surprise me...). Having said that, I do think I like Andrea's Pasta Fagioli a bit better.... It only took reading thru one page of reviews (sorted by most helpful) to realize only "slight" changes were necessary. The only modifications I felt were critical (some out of necessity) were to add the rind from a block of Parmesan cheese to my soup (it would have gone to waste otherwise, and to my surprise, gave my soup GREAT flavor) and to substitute garbanzo beans for kidney beans, Italian-seasoned tomato sauce for plain tomato sauce and chicken stock for broth . I chose to add wine (cabernet sauvignon) and am glad I dd. The wine adds flavor and depth, IMHO. Despite other's complaints about not having enough broth, I had plenty. :) And, despite one reviewer's complaint about this being less healthy than Progresso....It really depends on whether or not you use low-sodium / salt-free products (I used reduced-sodium canned green beans / stock and no salt added tomato sauce) & if you RINSE / DRAIN your beans. These two changes can AND do make all the difference. Served with warm slices of parmesan focaccia bread (Sandra Bennett), this was a perfect meal for this chilly fall evening.  And, to boot, I got my serving's worth of veggies for the day! Thanks for sharing,  Jamie! :-)

This is the best vegetable soup I have ever tasted!  My 10, 8, and 5 year old boys even loved it!  Only change was to add white beans and a little cayenne pepper!  Great on a cold, wet, fall day!

My Hubby and I LOVED this soup.  I replaced the 2 c of water with another 2 c of chicken broth.  I also added 1 c shredded cabbage, 3 diced potatoes (instead of pasta), and frozen spinach (instead of fresh).  I sauteed the onions separately from the other veggies and added the garlic last minute to prevent burning.  Great soup for a cool, fall day! :~)

I tried this recipe as written and it was way too tomato-y. 4 cups is way, way too much. It was like tomato sauce with veggies. I did not like it at all and minestrone soup is one of my favorite soups. After the great reviews I was really looking forward to making this. I would not make this again.

4 C chicken broth, 2 cans tomato paste + 4 cans water, noodles cooked separately, added spinach and kidney beans during lat 10-15 minutes.  Fresh green beans (pre-cooked/blanched) YUM!  I thought the tomato paste would make it bitter like it is in my spagetti sauce, but it wasn't.  I guess it was approx. 1 T kosher salt and 1 t pepper.  Perfect seasoning.

Cold winter night? This is the perfect dinner! Here are a few modifications, but this is the kind of thing you can create to taste. Here's what made it perfect for me: used large can of crushed tomatoes with basil + 3 cans chicken broth and no water. Used red potatoes (2) and no celery or green beans. Also used both kidney and white beans -- and it looked gorgeous. I saw one review that added potatoes at the end because of a longer cooking time. I threw the potatoes in withthat carrots though atthe beginning and it was great. Near the end, also recommend adding a little olive oil to the pot just to add more depth and when serving, definitely top with a generous spoon of Parmesan. I served with Parmesan crescent rolls and it was a cozy monster hit!!!

GREAT!!  So fresh and healthy.  I added more garlic (always the case) and used dried oregano since that is all I had on hand.  This will be a staple in my kitchen!  Thanks Jamie.

This soup is so delicious!! You will not be disappointed! I followed the recipe exactly, except for a few changes, due only to what I had on hand. I used 4 cups of vegetable juice instead of tomato sauce, fresh green beans instead of canned & added a can of cannellini beans with the kidney beans. Also 1 can of Italian style diced tomatoes for some extra flavor. It is the best minestrone soup i've ever had! Served it with the crusty french bread recipe from this site and a big salad with Tuscan Italian dressing...Also from this site. Thank you so much for this recipe, Jamie!!

This is by far my very favoritite soup recipe.  It is easy to make and it freezes well and it is SOOO good.  I throw in some portabella mushrooms and occasionally I will throw in some italian turkey or chicken meatballs or just some chicken and it is awesome... Can't go wrong with this one..

Wow, I can't believe so many people rated this 5 stars! My version was only slightly tweaked--no beans (didn't have any kidneys on hand), frozen spinach instead of fresh, less tomato sauce. Turned out so bland! Hearty, though, which was nice. Definitely more like a veggie stew than soup. Also, as stated, the soup yields WAY more than 8 servings--maybe closer to 16 or 20 servings. Next time, I'd reduce the amount of servings, as well.  If I make this another time, I will triple the spices, quadruple the garlic, add more broth, and probably cook for longer. I only let the soup stew for 1.5 hours, so maybe the flavors hadn't had a chance to fully meld or something. Overall, kind of a let down--I'm going to keep searching for a minestrone recipe that suits my tastes.

This is a wonderful, no fail soup recipe.  I agree with the other raters, you can customize it to your family's liking.  If you don't like something, leave it out.  If you really need something else, then add it.  There are so many wonderful flavors in this soup, an addition or subtraction will only make it better for your personal taste.  I made it exactly as written and also more customized with extra carrots, a few potatoes and a can of chopped tomatos instead of tomato sauce.  I also used lots of spices and herbs, it was a great dish to pour the 'end of the bottle' for many herbs and spices. Thanks for sharing, the whole family loved it.

I made this soup today for my family that came to visit for the day.  It was DELICIOUS! Because one person was vegan - I changed the chicken broth to just water with a few tablespoons of salted herbes (a product I get from Gaspe in my province of Quebec). I also used a 28 oz. tin of chopped tomatoes, about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce that I had hanging around that was only going to go to waste.  I liked adding the pasta individually to the bowls rather then the usual method of dumping the pasta into the soup pot.  When I served the soup, I put a good dollop of pesto sauce on the top.  My nephew said this really made the soup by putting this on top (he had 2 servings).  He now wants the recipe!  I'll definitely pass this one on to anyone who wants a simple but tasty soup - and being a Type 1 diabetic - low in carbs!! Guess what I'm having for dinner?  FatCatAnna

This recipe has been a family favorite since I found it 2 years ago.  We make it atleast once a month.  It is pretty much one of the only ways that my husband and kids will gladly eat vegetables!  Thank you Jamie.  (We omit the wine, and it is fine, and we sometimes serve with a slice of Provolone cheese melting over the top of the hot bowl of soup.

Great minestrone. Made the following modifications for a 5 star minestrone. Used 3 cans diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, added 2 cans garbanzo beans, 2 1/2 tsp dried basil instead of fresh, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper. Omitted the zucchini and beans just because I didn't have them on hand. Yummy, my whole family loved it.

I thought this soup was bland. Maybe it is because I did not use onion or celery, I never do though. After cooking all day long and adding a few ingredients it came out pretty good.If I had only cooked for the time stated in would not have been good. I used all chicken broth for more flavor and  added red potatoes and cabbage. It makes a lot.

I just made this with my wife tonight and it came out great.  We used cannellini beans instead of kidney beans and we used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of using water (although we did add ~1cup of water as well).  We skipped the green beans and added dried herbs (didn't have fresh on hand) and we skipped the red wine (didn't have any on hand, will try with red wine next time).  For pasta we used ditalini and we used finely shredded mozzarella instead of parmesan.  This recipe is definitely a keeper (just alter vegetable to your liking).  If relevant, we used Hunt's Tomato Sauce which was lower in sodium compared to the other cans.

This is a great recipe. I cut the veggies very chunky to make it rustic. I used V8 instead of tomato sauce and used vegetarian broth instead of chicken. HOW CLEVER TO COOK THE PASTA SEPARATELY AND ADD IT IN! so it does not get mushy.

This came out awesome. My sister hates beans so I left them out (I'd rather have kept them, though), and zucchini costs an awful lot here and I'm on a tight budget, so I didn't bother with it. Even so, this is one of the most vegetable-filled, tasty soups I've ever made. Thanks Jamie!

This recipe hardly needs another review, but it was truly that wonderful!  I made this for the first visit by the future in-laws (particularly for my fiance's super-picky father) and it was a huge hit with everyone.  I did make the following changes for various dietary and other reasons: 1 cup white wine for the red, no beans other than green, no pasta -- used potatoes, no spinach -- used cabbage, added bay leaves and parm. cheese rind, increased stock by quite a bit and used more of the called for spices, and made it one day in advance, which definitely seemed to improve the flavor.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

WOW. Took 40 min to prepare, 40 min to cook, and it tops the top of all the soups I have made. No chicken broth needed--just used H20 & a bit of veggie boullion. Amazing soup--tastes professional.

This is one of those soups that you can totally change to your family's taste without sacrificing the awesomeness of the soup.  My family doesn't like celery or green beans so we omitted them, added fresh tomatoes, 2 boxes of stock one chicken, one beef (accidentally thought it was chicken), 15 oz can of tomato sauce, 2 yellow squash, 4 huge cloves of garlic, dried oregano and basil, ditalini pasta, 1/2lb of ground beef and a whole can of kidney beans.  I love spinach in soup but the kids won't eat anything leafy green in their soup so I left it out.  I will definitely be making this again really soon.

We loved this soup, it was hearty and warming on a cold winter night.  I used regular spinach instead of baby, 1 tsp dried oregano instead of fresh, and 1 tbsp of dried basil instead of fresh since that's what I had on hand.  Next time I make it I will add the kidney beans about 10 minutes before serving as they got kind of mushy after simmering for 45 minutes.  This is definately a keeper!

Excellent soup and very easy!  I added one can of stewed tomatoes and the water, instead of one of the cups of water called for.  The only question I had is why a recipe that calls for fresh ingredients recommends canned green beans.  If fresh veggies are not available, substitute frozen since they are so much better for you and don't have all of the sodium.  I'm not sure it's necessary to cook the veggies and pasta separately.  If you're going to simmer the soup for a while, you can toss everything together and they will all cook in the pot.

My fiance declared this minestrone 'better than Olive Garden's'.  And I agree!  What I did differently:  crushed tomatoes for tomato sauce; fresh green beans; much more spinach (stemmed and chopped coarse, even tho I did use 'baby'); just two zucchini; ditalini pasta.  What I will do differently next time:  blanch the green beans; use one zucchini (even two was *plenty* for us); maybe another can of beans; maybe a can of whole tomatoes, broken up.  I think keeping the pasta separate is key!  I used the ditalini based on another reviewer's suggestion that ditalini holds up better in soups.  I did make a second batch using red beans and didn't care for them much.  They were smaller and mushier than the kidney beans.  And one more note on the prep time:  maybe I'm slow, but I spent an hour preparing the vegetables; much more than the thirty-five minutes indicated on the recipe.  But, I did stem and chop the spinach and also used the fresh green beans.  But the end result was well worth it!

LOVE THIS RECIPE! Nothing needs to be changed unless you have a preference. It is excellant with the addition of the wine and parmasan cheese - don't leave these out. Only because I wanted to I used fresh green beans and did add more spinach, used 4 c. chicken broth (low sodium/low fat) and added water as needed to adjust consistency of stock. I used 2 c. no salt tomato sauce so I could better control sodium levels and sub'd cauliflower for zucchini because I don't care for zucchini. This is easy to make, doesn't need to cook long, makes a lot and is a GREAT soup that is adaptable to your personal taste. Thanks Jamie for sharing this with us.

I love making this soup every winter with the zucchini I freeze in the summer. The only change I make is to use vegetable broth instead of chicken. Interesting to note that even homemade with no added salt, the recipe still has 1142 mg of sodium.

I had a bunch of spare veggies on hand and needed a recipe to put them into - something fairly flexible so that I could make substitutions as needed. This recipe was perfect! It's nutritious, makes a ton, and surprisingly filling - one bowl with some crusty bread and I was stuffed! I definitely didn't use all the ingredients listed - for example I omitted the red wine and spinach, and added zucchini. I also used crushed tomatoes rather than tomato sauce, and used Ditalini pasta. That's the beauty of this recipe - use what you have, or what is in season, or what you love. And, you can feel good about eating it! Thanks for the keeper :)

This was a great recipe that helped use up the huge zucchini my 4-yr old discovered hidden in the garden! Did not use red wine but did slosh in some red wine vinegar. A great vegetarian minestrone- even my soup-hating husband enjoyed it and took leftovers to work!

I didnt have everything on hand, no spinach, no celery and no fresh herbs. This was still so yummy. But I am a soup lover! I made this a one pot dish by doing everything in...one pot. I sauted the veggies in the big pot that I used to make the soup, and at the end I just put the pasta right in with everyting else and let it cook there. I used all homemade veggie broth up front instead of the water called for. But aas it kept cooking I did need to add quit a bit of water, in order for this to have any broth. with as much veggies as it has in it. Great recipe!

I've made this about 3 times so far, each with a bit of tweaking.  I find that I get the best flavor if I omit 2 cups of the tomato sauce and use 2 cups of V-8 juice instead.  I also added a can of drain portabello mushrooms to the soup while it was simmering.  I only had white wine on hand, so that's what i used.  I also used 1lb of browned ground beef instead of pasta.  My husband loved it.  Anything that sticks to your ribs is a winner with him.  Plus, most of these veggies I got out of my veggie garden!  Perfect!  I served this in bread bowls and got rave reviews.  There was not one drop of soup left.   5 Stars!!

This soup made SO much!  I only made enough for "4" servings and it made so much that I was able to freeze half of the soup for another night.    My family loved it and compared it to Olive Garden!  My 16 month old daughter loved it!

My husband loves minestrone soup so I thought I'd make this one.  Having never made any homemade soup, I was a little nervous.  He said it was as good as any he'd ever eaten.  He loved all the vegetables.

This is a great recipe for a delicious, healthy soup. I didn't have fresh herbs so used a bit of Herbs de Provence. We're trying to avoid white flour and I'm not a fan of whole wheat pasta so just left out the shells and added garbanzo beans and lots of extra spinach. At the end, took a cup of the soup and pureed with a small piece of the leftover rind of good parmesan, added back in and YUM!! Thanks Jamie!

My teenage boys loved this!  It was a great way to get veggies into them. I added a pound of ground turkey and two spicy sausages.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I would however make one slight change next time I make it. I would double up on the tomato sauce and chicken broth. Soup got too thick for my tastes after it sat. Also, this soup was soooo much better the next day. Freezed beautifully.

This soup is delicious! I love the abundance of vegetables. I used frozen green beans instead of canned (better for you) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I served it with the whole wheat beer bread from this site (also delicious) and it made a great dinner for a winter night.

This is very good after a bit of doctoring, but for my taste it was a bit bland as written, so I added red pepper and some smoked sausage. I think using hot sausage would do the trick next time. I was too lazy to thaw and fry it tonight,  but definately plan to make it again and try the hot Bob Evans sausage. I don't like my thing fiery hot, but just a little kick is perfect for me. I did not find it hard or very time consuming to make. I was a bit surprised at how quickly it came together. Will make it again, but w/ my changes in use.

Excellent recipe. Like other members I changed it to suit our tastes and what I had available. Left out spinach (kids hate it), reduced the oil and used canellini beans instead of green beans. Also used tinned tomatoes instead of sauce. It was a veggie packed hearty soup and the kids loved it, cleared their bowls and had the rest for lunch next day....hence the 5 stars!

Use the wine - it makes a huge difference in the taste of the broth and adds a little extra juice.  I also added white beans to the mix.  Other than that it was great!

Outstanding.  This was really so good and so simple.  I decided to add two 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes and one small can of tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce because I love tomatoes.  I also chicken broth in place of the water and added 2 chicken boullion cubes.  It did need a little more salt, but we're adding that when we serve instead of to the whole pot.  This is so much better than even the soup they serve at the local Italian restaurant.  Definitely top with fresh grated parmesan as it adds that little extra something and a little saltiness.  Thanks for the post.

This is such a good recipe.  Put it all in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours and was perfect.  Added corn and two cans kidney beans, also used one box frozen spinach and one can diced tomatoes and two small cans tomato sauce instead of all tomato sauce as recommended.  Also left out the green beans because the pot was too full!!  What a healthy and tasty recipe, thanks!

I added more pasta so I had to almost double the liquid part.  It tastes really good though!! I swapped out some of the veggies - ie corn for the green beans.  The soup is very versitle so you can really put in anything you have on hand.  My husband isn't usually a soup lover and he cleaned his bowl.  It makes a TON so there is definitely plenty to freeze or give away.

This IS minestrone soup.  Classic minestrone is a vegetable soup except for maybe stock - many here have meat...How Italian it tastes depends a lot on your touch with the spices (enough, but not too much).  I don't use kidney beans, I do use a lot of mushrooms.  I'll make the sofrito and maybe some veggies in broth and use an in-the-pot blender to make a heartier base, into which the chunkier veggies go to cook.  This is the stuff, right here.  Use all fresh ingredients, if you can.

Delicious! I substituted potatoes of the zucchini, used frozen green and wax beans, omitted the kidney beans and used 4 cups of broth instead of the 2 cups and 2 cups of water. Fresh tasting and warming on a cold day.

This was really, really good soup. I like it because it's so versatile.  Subbed potatoes for zucchini, diced tomatoes for sauce and beef broth for chicken cuz that's what I had.  Loved it with my crusty bread.  Thanks.

This is one of the best soups I have eaten. I did add more red wine, about 1 to 1 1/2 cups. I don't add the macaroni as we don't like it. It freezes well.

The reviews are right! This is a great recipe. I also used all chicken broth. Can't resist a few changes, though...used 1/2 and 1/2 crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce, instead of only tomato sauce, replaced zucchini with about 1 cup of yellow squash and no kidney beans. This is one of those great recipes that you can do all kinds of changes to the veggies and make it your own. Thanks for sharing.

This is a really tasty soup. Chock full of vegies and beans. I followed the recipe but didn't have any zucchini, so I used kidney beans, corn, green beans, celery, and carrots and omitted the wine. I also added red pepper flake to suit my taste for spicy. It made a lot, which made my hubby happy, since he can now have it for lunch too! I will be making this quite often, come the winter months!

Though I made a couple of changes, I am still rating this recipe 5 stars, because I think it would still be yummy without my changes. I made those because of what was available in my pantry.  First of all, I dint use chicken broth, I used vegetable, and used the full amount (instead of the water too). Then I dint have tomato sauce, so I used 4 fresh tomatoes and 3 tablespoons tomato paste. I also used chick peas instead of the kidney beans and I doubled the spinach. Lastly I added a couple of shitake mushrooms, and lots of crushed red pepper to suit my husband's spicy tastebuds. It was just tooooooo yum!
Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I made this for our family tradition of  meatless mondays.
I left out the spinach and zucchini, and instead of using 4 cups of tomato sauce, I used 2C sauce and 2C diced canned tomatoes instead. I had some mini macaroni noodles that I used in place of the shell pasta and used dried herbs that I had on hand
My family liked it with the exception of my 9 year old who I have a hard time getting to eat his veggies. 
My husband placed a biscuit in the bottom of his bowl pouring the soup on top. 
Will make again in the future.

Absolutely wonderful! My 17 month old daughter is pretty much only interested in eating vegetable soup and chicken strips so I thought I would try this recipe instead of buying tons of Campbells! She loves it! I added a few veggies for her sake though: corn, squash, potatoes and peas. Also, instead of kidney beans, I used small white beans and barley (she has a hard time chewing the kidney beans). :) Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very nice! It makes heaps and keeps really well and gets better in the day or two after making. I used half a large tin of tomato juice in it so it was a beautiful rich tomato flavour. I also added chopped bacon which I browned quickly first then kept on with the recipe. I am lazy when it comes to measuring out individual italian spices and I substituted bottled italian herbs and a couple of bay leaves.

Very very good!  I made this during lent to serve as an entree and it worked well.  It is not only filling but great tasting.  I was so disappointed when all my left overs ran out.  I agree with other reviewers that it makes much more than eight portions.  Will be making again soon.

my boyfriend and i made this yesterday  -and WOW! we just loved this soup. it really tastes like minestrone. the pot of soup fed 10 ppl with healthy appetites (served garlic bread alongside). i did make some substitutions: instead of 2 cups of water, used 4 cups of chicken stock (total). used a combination of diced and canned tomatoes. increased the amount of fresh basil (used the whole, small bunch of fresh basil). also, i let it simmer for around 1.5 hrs. the soup cooks itself pretty much - and is so easy. thank you jamie!

I had gone to the Olive Garden with my daughter and had a cup of Minestrone. Here it is a couple weeks later and I had to have some more! I made this recipe in my slow cooker. I live in a condo and the smell that went down the hall had my neighbors asking what I was making that smelled so good. I mixed yellow and green zucchini and used low sodium ingredients to lower the salt content. With the seasonings I didn't miss the extra salt. I doubled the recipe and shared with the guys next door who never seem to have girlfriends that cook! This is one of the best recipes I have found on Allresipes! The fact it is -10 degrees outside today made this worth ten stars.

Very good! I will make this again. It can be very versitile with the ingredients you have in your house which is nice! I added more carrots, added some chopped tomatos, mixed 1/2 chicken and 1/2 turkey broth, skipped the wine spinach and zucchini (although I can't wait to try it with these ingredients once I have them in the house), used dry herbs (1/2 amount than fresh),and spiral noodles instead of seashell. Good!

THanks for such a great recipe. This soup is in my winter rotation, and it is great for all those things in your fridge I lovingly call "must goes" I have made many variations, based on what I had on hand. My favorite is to start with a puree of leftover French Onion Soup (from this site) and add to it beef broth (leftover from prime rib) and whatever veggies I have on hand. I always use the whole wheat shell pasta, and I always cook it in water and let it sit for at least an hour (do not drain) before I add it to the soup, in order to keep the noodles from soaking up all the broth. I like to add the carrots and celery early, and the zucchini and spinach towards the end. A great, healthy meal for families on the go! Thanks, Jamie!!

Great hearty, healthy soup!  I only changed a couple of things: I added corn and used one can stewed italian tomatoes for half the tomato sauce. I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken. I used less olive oil.  Very yummy.  Next time I will spice it up a bit more for my personal tastes and add other spices such as red pepper, sage, etc.

I changed this to serve 40 people so I could served it for an event at church.  RAVE reviews.  Heard comments that this was better than what is served at that GARDEN restaurant.  Will make this again.

Very good...did not use wine (fresh out!), used dried herbs (my plants aren't looking great!), and did not add final drizzle of olive oil (forgot too...don't think it needs it). The flavour of the soup was lovely, and we are looking forward to making this again and playing with the vegetables. We think that broccoli and cauliflower would be great, as would mushrooms, leeks, asparagus, corn, chickpeas or pretty much anything else you had hanging around. Thanks for the healthy, versatile recipe!

Good, but it is high in salt and needs more liquid.  While cooking I found it a little bland, so I just added a bit of tabasco sauce and vinegar to flavor (but we tend to like more acidic soups).  That did the trick!

This minestrone is delicious. I didnt have any zucchini so I added more spinach. Also, after sautee'ing the vegetables, I cooked this soup in a crock pot on high for 4 hours. Its very flavorful.

Update below! This recipe made a hearty dinner for two and we froze 4 quarts of soup for later.  Used a mix of crushed tomatoes and diced instead of the tomato sauce, doubled the spices, and left out the spinach (I forgot to buy any).  Used elbow macaroni instead of shells; shells would have been prettier, but I already had elbow in the cupboard. I let this simmer on the stove for about three hours before adding the pasta and serving.

2015 update - This has become my go-to vegetable soup recipe. Sometimes I make it as written, but after the base of aromatics and tomato, there's a lot of flexibility to go in any direction. I often omit the pasta and I've swapped vegetable stock for chicken to make a dinner for vegetarian friends. I tend to use marsala as my cooking wine.

I often make a pot and freeze it in single-serving containers for lunches.  It's a good, hearty, healthy meal without the added sugar, salt, and preservatives of canned soup. (Plus, I don't feel so guilty if dinner skimps on vegetables when we've had a big bowl of veggies for lunch!)

I have made this more times than I can count and I have never heard a complaint!  The only changes I make are:  frozen green beans (or fresh if available)and I used Italian-crushed tomatoes and only a little can of tomato sauce.  I make either a loaf of tomato bread or crusty country bread to go with it -- it is GREAT!!!!  Always a hit.  This the best minestrone I have ever had; I can never eat minestrone at restaurants now.  I prefer to make my own.  Oh, it is EASY to cut up stuff and get it all ready ahead of time so the actual puttting it together can go quickly!

made this tonight and loved it!
my husband thought it was great!
i added 3 small red baby bliss potatoes and cooked it for 1 and a half hours!  Also did not use the pasta as the potatoes made it hearty enough.
Delicious!  Thanks!

Mmmmmmm good!  I didn't think I changed much- but I did.  I used all chx broth and no water.  I used fresh zucchini and green beans, cannellini beans instead of kidney beans, and 1 can of diced tomatoes- no sauce, dried herbs not fresh, ditalini pasta (boiled right in the soup not separate) instead of sea shells.  Also, I sauteed some bacon and added it back in to the soup at the end .  This was DELICIOUS!  I think this was the best minestrone I've ever had!!  YUM!!!  Thanks for a delicious and very easy to adapt for what's in the cupboard recipe!

Wow - this is an excellent soup, I've made it several times this fall already. Some revisions I now make: 2 zucchinis is plenty; use one can tomato sauce, and one can diced Italian-style tomatoes; used half the amount of dried spices; and add the pasta to the soup during the last 20 or so minutes of cooking. Makes a lot, but I look forward to the leftovers. It's a keeper.

Excellent soup! I did add less tomato sauce then it called for because I do not like a soup that is too tomatoey.  This is a great soup if you have toddlers.  I keep portions in the freezer to take out and warm up for lunch.

Like Many, the thickness might be a problem if you are thinking SOUP. I saw this coming in the last 45 mins. of simmering and added more liquid at that time. I made a big stock pot full and it was wonderful. My wife loved it as well and is bring over a container full to her parents house tomorrow for lunch. Cut back a little on the veggies.. thats the only difference I will make the next time... Great name for the Minestrone too.

This really is more like a stew than a soup with the amount of broth & water the recipe suggests so I had to add more water in order to make it an actual soup.  There are way too many vegetables in this and it's a lot of working chopping everything up by hand (no food processor).  I think there was a bit too much tomato sauce and would use more chicken broth next time.  Also, it needed a lot of salt & pepper because it is basically a very bland, vegetable soup.  The parmesan cheese makes an excellent touch and definitely makes for a lovely presentation.  

I also didn't think there was enough pasta so I added more, because afterall, that's what minestrone soup is...pasta, beans & veg in a tomato based broth.

OMG this was amazing! I don't have a dutch oven so I just did everything in a big tall soup pot on top of the stove rather than the oven.  My fiance absolutely loved it!  It wasn't mushy the next day either!

The ONLY changes I made: Added mushrooms and a 28 oz. can of whole peeled italian tomatoes.
Yummy!

This is my first attempt at a minestrone, and it was a success!  It ended up a little too thick, so I'll have to address that next time with more liquid.  I did let this simmer for 60 minutes as I felt this let the zucchini and carrots soften a little more.  I included the red wine (an $8 merlot...nothing expensive).  My wife and I both enjoyed this recipe and would recommend it to all!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! I change this recipe every time I make it adding veggies that are in season. I also make my own tomato sauce which makes that soup even more flavorful. I also always use 2 cans of black beans instead of 1 can of kidney. Great hot or cold, you must try this recipe!

Great Recipe! The only thing Id change is the amount of basil and oregano, Id say to add to taste because for me it was way too much.  Oh and I dont think the preliminary sauteeing is necessary..so Id skip that and omit the oil. Otherwise the soup was wonderful!

The soup-base was excellent, but I felt like there was simply too much going on. Next time I think I'll leave out the green beans and spinach.

Mayb I'm a tough sell because I'm Italian, but i would really call this more of a vegetable soup than a true minestrone.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but we ended up throwing out the leftovers which is rare for soup in my house.  Needs something more, not sure what...

Bravisimo!!  I made this for my salad club at work and they have requested it again the next time it is my turn on salad day!  The wine is optional but I believe it really is the ultimate ingredient in this soup.

This was a great soup! A few things I did differently was added corn, and just put the dry noodles right into the soup for the last fifteen minutes instead of cooking them seperately. It turned out great.

This is DELICIOUS! I left out the spinach and red wine because I didn't have any and it was so good. You can do anything with this, leave some stuff out, put whatever you want in. So healthy and just good. I use Fat Free chicken broth, it's 5 calories for 1 cup.... it's crazy. And just all veggies and the tomato sauce. So good!!!

Yummy! I only did two things differently--Instead of adding 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water, I added 4 cups of chicken broth. I also added a small potato-diced. Thanks for the awesome recipe Jaime.

this is a great soup.  I added 2 fresh chopped tomatoes, and I recommend less zucchinis.  And, of course, add the pasta as you need it like the recipe says.

This soup is delish!  I omitted the Parmesan for topping, and used whole grain elbow noodles.  Where we live, I can not find a lot of fresh herbs, so I just added a bit of them dried.  My two girls, ages 3 and 5 ate every bite and the entire pot was gone in 2 1/2 days!!!Thanks for the keeper!

This soup was delish.  After using required measurements I found myself with a little of this and that left, just threw it in not to waste, did not make a difference in the end.  I also decided to top each dish with a good spoonful of romano cheese, that added the finishing touch needed.  My husband is a fan of minnestrone so he loved it, enough to freeze for a quick meal.  The My grandaughter Jaime loved the fact I made "her soup"  I would make it again.Mabe add a bit of ground beef next time for a twist.

Excellent! I also used chicken broth instead of the water and crushed tomatoes. And to make it even easier, I used frozen crinkle-cut carrots and a package of frozen, chopped spinach instead of fresh. I also added canneloni beans & Ditalini pasta.

This was very good.  I will definitely make it again.  I didn't use the spinach because it had gone bad in the fridge...but the flavor was so good I didn't miss it.  I used extra oregano and basil so as not to waste it and used the tiny shell pastas.  Very yummy.

I only used one onion, and 3 carrots. I didn't add the red wine or the spinach, and I used one zucchini and 2 yellow squash. I also totally omitted the last sentence about the parmesan cheese. I also used about a half a small bag of small seashell pasta, just cause I wanted more than a half a cup.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except to make more pasta since my kids always end up picking the noodles out and eating those.  I did not add the wine, since I didn't have an open bottle.  Oh, and I used white kidney (cannellini) beans.  Really wonderful soup.  Very flavorful.  Next time I will add a bit more chicken broth to thin it just a little, and I'll try the suggestions about adding some diced tomatoes in place of some of the sauce.  Thanks Jamie!

Absolutely fantastic.  I didn't need any pasta.  Loaded with veggies and I simmered it for longer than required because I prefer the vegetables softer.  I added more wine than required and it really gave a great flavor - Kiss Campbells' goodbye!!!

This is very good. It's actually even much better after sitting for a day whent he flavors all blend together nicely. I did mine in a crock pot. I sauteed all the vegetables up until the celery. Then I put them in the crock pot and added the other ingredients.I left the salt out until the end and found that it needed very little, about 3/4 tsp.

Great soup!  I never rally like tomato based soups but the chicken broth and water really tame in down a bit.  I put turkey in it and it was great!  Next time, I will make it with some left over beef roast.  This made plenty but it won't last long!  Thanks for a great comforting soup recipe!

I love all soups.
This was really simple and very good. I never have wine and I added 1 cup finely shredded cabbage and red  swiss chard(instead of spinach). I also used italian diced tomatoes instead of sauce.

I have been looking for a tasty vegetable soup and this minestrone is excellent. I made it with vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth.  The only other thing I left out was spinach, and that was only because of the concerns about spinach being safe right now.  I am excited to add this soup to my repertoire.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this soup. There are only two of us, but I made a whole recipe based on the rave reviews, thinking we'd want leftovers. I was right! It kept very well in the fridge. Great recipe to make on the weekend and keep for a night you want a light dinner.

This is the best minestrone I've ever made - I left out the spinach and used a can of diced tomatoes with basil to accent the flavor and consistency. I'm really impressed with the blending of flavors and hope hubby will like it!

This is a great recipe.  I modified it a bit.  I was making ti for a vegitarian friend of  mine and my girlfriend, so i did not add the chicken broth.  Also, i did not have spinach, but did have garbonzo beans.  I didn't have time to simmer the soup, so i sauted the vegies, cooked in potatoes, and then mixed it all in the boing vegi broth.  great job jamie

This really is just like the true, classic Italian recipe! Sooooo good!!!The only thing I did differently was to replace the spinach with chard (ok, and added a little red wine).

Very good!....I didn't add spinach, but I did put in some yellow squash.  Word of advice...I had read another reviewers advice of just cooking the pasta with the soup instead of seperately...don't do this!  It totally ruined it the first time I tried to make it.  The second time I cooked the pasta separately and it was so much better!!  I will definitely make this again.

This was great! I left out the spinach and only used one zucchini (because I didn't have any more), and the pot was still overflowing with vegetables! This made so much soup that I had enough for three days, and then froze the rest! Thanks Jamie!

5+++!!! This was one of the first allrecipes.com recipes I ever made; hub & I made this together when we were dating a few years ago, and I never rated it.  It is SUCH a great soup and such a great base to take it as far as you want. I made a vegetable stock, from scratch, because I have so many garden veggies to use, and subbed that for the chicken broth & water. Ended up with so much stock that I doubled the recipe. Used fresh green beans, omitted the spinach and used fresh corn on the cob, along with some additional Trader Joe's frozen fire-roasted corn. Subbed 2 med cans diced tomatoes, 1 small can tomato sauce for the 4c tomato sauce. Doubled the pasta 'cause I'm a carb freak. Served with a dollop of homemade basil pesto which was absolutely the BEST final touch to the soup!  Served with homemade rolls. Great dinner for a chilly autumn night. FABulous soup. Thanks SO much, Jamie!

Excellent minestrone, really awesome tomato/herb flavor. I used dried herbs, and didn't use spinach, or pasta, as this makes a huge pot of soup and it was more than enough food. I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of one of the cans of tomato sauce. Tasty! We're having the leftovers tonight for dinner! Thanks for a great recipe.

turned out WONDERFUL!!  my fiance and i love soups...and this one made it in the recipe box for sure!  I made a couple of changes though.  I doubled the amount of chicken stock..and i'm glad i did!  i did 1 yellow squash and 1 zuch.  i also added 1 can of diced tomatoes (italian flavor/style) - - may add one more next time!!  I also did not have the fresh herbs..i used dried and A LOT.  Turned out great...but will try fresh next time.  DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE PARMESAN!!  this is a must have... i tried the soup (forgetting about the parmesan) and it was "missing something" - added the parmesan and that was IT!! mmm.  I also did not add the wine (was delicious without) - but my fiance added just a few spashes of merlot at the end when simmering. MMM..was very very good!  I ate mine with saltine crackers..mmmm.  can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!  it's a keeper!

This was a great recipe because it was so versatile.  Plus , after reading other reviews, I realized I did not need to worry about being exact with measurements but to go by feel & personal preference.  SO thanks Jamie, this was great.  My friends raved when I made it today for lunch. :)

I made this soup once, and although it requires a lot of time & ingredients, its worth the effort! It tastes just like the minestrone soup served at our favorite italian restaurant chain. Freshly grated parmesan cheese is the perfect added touch.

This was ok but I have to be honest. I think salt makes it taste good! I think this tastes best served right after it's prepared.

Very good.  The only changes I made were to add garbanzo beans (can't imagine Minestrone with 'em) and I used Italian green beans, instead of regular green beans.  A bit more garlic and didn't add the wine. Be sure to only add the pasta to each bot, not to the pot of soup...it soaks up the 'broth' too much.

I cut back on the veggies but the tomato base was still over powering. I thought it lacked flavor. It wasn’t really the authentic type of Minestrone soup I was looking for.

Excellent minestrone Jamie! It's so enjoyable to make a soup like this. All that chopping is good for the soul.
My hard-working ironworker BF practically inhaled the contents of the pot when he was hit by the fabulous aroma at the front door. After a long hard day "It's like walking into heaven". All 4 of my children love it too. Thank you Jamie.

Yummmy! This soup recipe is GREAT! My hubby came home for lunch especially for this soup. it was that good and is a definately keeper. I didn't use chicken broth just added water and used dried herbs as i didn't have fresh. next time i will use fresh herbs and am sure it will be even better. Thanks for such a great recipe

Great soup!  Lots of veggies.  My 6 yo had 3 bowls for dinner.  Served it with some sun dried tomato ciabatta.  My 5 yo liked the pasta.  Very complete meal.  Will definitely make again.

This was soooo good! My boyfriend and I both loved it, and my roommates were drawn to the kitchen by the smell! Did need a bit more liquid though - next time I'll add more chicken broth or try it with the red wine.

The BEST! Used leeks and onion, and half again the water (could still add more when warming). No pasta nor beans (not sure if this disqualifies as Minestrone, but low carb). A must: leave overnight for better flavor.

Everyone I have served this soup to has loved it!  We always double the recipe – it is great to pack up and take for lunch.  I add some diced tomatoes and skip the spinach, but other than that stay pretty close to the original.  Also I use ditilini pasta instead (sometimes called salad macaroni) because that is the type of pasta in the minestrone at the Italian restaurant I worked at.  I think it works a little better in a soup than the seashells.  Delicious!

Tasted much more hearty with Parmesan and croutons.  Took longer than specified time to get the beans soft.

Great soup, just needed more broth.  Added a can of italian diced tomatoes and a extra small can of tomato sauce with two cans of water.  Used beef broth instead and made little italian meatballs.  Frozen green beans too. Turns out great every time.   
Love, Love, Love this soup!!!!!

This is a great recipe!  I prepared this soup for some co-workers  and when I went to get a bowl for myself - gone!  I used 5 (4oz) cans of Hunt's Basil, Oregano and Garlic Tomato Sauce along with fresh herbs, 2 cans of Swanson's Low Sodium Chicken Broth, Cheese-filled Tortellini and added some Jalapeno Sausages for flavoring and followed the recipe from there.  Many have asked for the recipe. Thanks Jamie!

I really enjoyed this....it had ALOT of flavor and few calories.  I increased the chicken broth to three 14 oz cans to make more broth.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I froze the leftovers.  I will cook some seashells and have soup on cold snowy days!  Thanks !

This recipe is great!  I very much enjoyed it and so did my husband.  I two seasoned and cooked chicken breasts and I also added a can of diced tomatoes and chilies for a little more flavor and spice.  I also added a little more broth as other recipes had suggested.  This recipe is great, anyone can make it.  Thanks Jamie, I have told so many people about this recipe!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to cut back on the amount of each vegetable...I wanted a brothy soup and other reviewers have commented on this needing more broth.  It is a great recipe...and I will be making it often this winter.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a lighter minestrone (not the usual beef) and this really fit the bill. I used a bit more garlic, fresh green beans and tomatoes and some flat leaf parsley from my herb garden. My 14 year old football player came home after practice and devoured two huge bowls with some warm "Fabulous Homemade Bread" (recipe from this site). As with most soups, it was even better the next day. Thanks!

This soup was good and definitely hearty! The only thing I might change is I will use fresh spinach next time. I used frozen and I think it took away from it. I may even omit the spinach next time. Thanks!

I was not formerly a fan of minestone, but this soup was a big hit.  I borrowed some of the ideas of others.  I substituted vegetarian broth for the chicken broth.  For half of the tomato sauce I used V8 juice.  I used fresh basil, but dried oregano. We like the small shells and put more per bowl than the recipe called for. We enjoyed the grated cheese on top. Except for making it vegetarian friendly for loved ones, I wouldn't stray too far from the original recipe, because it is super!

This is my favorite recipe from allrecipes.com.  Absolutely wonderful!  I have substituted vegetables for what I have had on hand.  It is a thick hearty soup and also freezes well.  You might need to add a little extra broth or water if it thickens too much.

I used all chicken broth, a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes, less zucchini and more spinach.  I also used dried herbs as my grocery was low on fresh when I visited.  I can't imagine that fresh herbs would have improved the flavor of this soup that much, so I will stick with dried.  My husband loved this topped with freshly grated asiago. Easy to throw together and delicious. Great job, Jamie!

Excellent recipe!  Try it!  It has become one of my all time favorite meals.  I would classify it more as a stew.  The only change is I add more fresh garlic, more carrots and I do not add any pasta.

It says 4 cups Tomato Sauce. I used Prego..then followed everything exactly. Still tasted like Prego, even with the wine and all broth. Maybe it meant canned plain sauce??? If so maybe it will be too plain...Anyhow, I think it worth tweaking. Thanks!!

Even my vegetable phobic daughter loved this soup. The recipe is quick to make and easy to adapt. Mine tends to be more like a vegetable stew, but it is very filling and nutritious. It has inspired my friend to go home and make some as well.

Delicious!! I used frozen green bean and a frozen package of spinach which I just threw in frozen and let cook down. Great flavors and very healthy. I didnt serve with the pasta...trying to cut carbs a bit....but still a wonderful soup!

This was a great recipe!  Very hearty and reminded me of my mother's minestrone.  I did double the chicken broth and eliminate the water.  I also increased the red wine to 1/2 cup.  I tend to like my soup a little more soupy so I cut back on the vegetable portions and used broken spaghetti in place of the seashell pasta (I put the dry spaghetti directly into the soup while it was simmering so it could soak up the flavors as well).

This was such an easy recipe to follow and everyone really liked it!! Especially my very picky 11 month old. Turned out wonderful. I made it in my slow cooker and added the pasta after adding the liquid and it turned out wonderful. Will use this recipe over and over again. My mother is already asking me for it! thanks!

I really thought I was going to like this, and I was pretty disappointed. I think perhaps it was too much basil-- maybe I'm just not much of a basil fan, I don't know. I did add some potatoes, which helped, but I don't think I'll make this again.

I'm giving this a five even though I agree with so many others - this is not a "soup" its almost vegetable stew.  Thankfully for others reviewers who said that I decided to trust them.  I used the suggested amt. of onions and celery, only used 2 lg. carrots, omitted the zuchinni and pasta (just a preference).  Used 4 cups of chicken broth (rather than 1/2 water, l/2 broth), used a 32 oz. can of whole tomatoes in thick puree breaking up the tomoatoes, 1 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, the kidney beans, splash of wine (not really necessary), and all the seasonings.  During the last 15 min. I added a cup of diced potatoes and last 5 min. added the can of green beans (can't imagine cooking canned green beans more than 5 min. - they turn to mush!).  It was delicious - but do want to say that even by my cutting back that much on the vegetables there is not a great amount of liquid.  We did love it though - the seasonings were just right and it tasted like minestrone.

I thought this was VERY good.  My husband (a meat & potatoes kind of guy) didn't like it the first time I served it, but when I reheated I added a spicy chicken sausage to his & he loved it!

This was very yummy... I made a few changes though... I used 4 cups beef broth instead of chicken, 1 can tomatoe sauce, 3 tablespoons tomatoe paste, 1 can of drained diced tomatoes, no spinach and a little over 1 cup of wine.  Oregano and basil was dried instead of fresh, and I used penne pasta.  Next time I would add more kidney beans because I really like them.  Yummy!  I just hope I remember all the changes I made for next time...

I made this soup on a cold, rainy autumn day...talk about "hitting the spot"!  I used fresh green beans and ditalini pasta, otherwise followed the recipe.  Hearty and healthy!  Thank you Jamie!

I made this for the Super Bowl since my fiance's vegetarian sister-in-law was there. Everyone loved it! I will make it again sometime as a vegetable beef stew by adding meat. Once you've done all the chopping, this is extremely easy!

Very, very good soup!  I made a mistake of letting it simmer too long, though, and the vegetable were mushy.  Next time I will follow the directions exactly and it will be awesome.  I love how the noodles are added right before serving so they stay al dente.  Wonderful flavor!!  THANKS!!

Awesome!
My ego gets stroked every time I make this soup. It is really flexible - I toss in whatever veggies I have on-hand (but the zuchinni is a must). I use frozen veggies to save on time. I would not recommend canned, they'll get too mushy. Fresh herbs and garlic are essential! Just talking about it makes me want to make it...

Excellent! The vegetables were all crisp and crunchy. This recipe was incredibly easy and filling. And as others have mentioned it's even better the second day. Instead of crushed red pepper I used thick and zesty tomato sauce and it gave it a fantastic kick. This is great with crusty bread or rolls!
Thanks Jamie!

This recipe was great! This is the first soup I'd ever made, and I got raving reviews from my 5 housemates. Made a few alterations due to what I had on hand - used 3 cups sauce and one tin of crushed tomatoes, used frozen green beans, used a 3 bean mix instead of kidney beans, added just under a quarter of a cabbage. I made this the night before serving, and simmered it for about 2 hours - hence I also added more water. The results were fantastic! Served with "Bread Machine Rolls" and fresh butter - will definitely be making this again! Thanks Jamie :)

This was sooooo delicious!!  I added summer squash and omitted the oil.  But I use the freshly grated parmesan on top and served with fresh Italian bread.  It was a hit!!  Everyone asks me for this recipe.

This soup is delicious.  I checked out the other reviews and used some V-8 instead of sauce and threw in some frozen corn, used frozen beans instead of canned.  I scaled this recipe to 75 servings and brought it to church for soup night.  It was a big hit! Comments included "as good as my Grandmothers!" and someone must have a farm with all these veggies!"

Great recipe.  I was a little daunted at first by the number of ingredients, but the actual preparation was simple and the soup was delicious.  I had been searching for a recipe similar to one at a restaurant that had altered it (and not for the better).  This is as close to that original recipe as I have found.

Very good and healthy with all the veggies.  Will definetely make this recipe again and again.  I only gave it four stars because I thought it could use a little bit more flavor.  Maybe I should have used fresh spices instead of dried.  Next time!

This is so much better than a sodium laden canned soup with skimpy, lame veggies.  Our central heat is broken, and it warmed us right up.  I think I might add more beans next time, but that's just a personal thing.  THis recipe is perfect as is.

This was excellent.  A neighbor passed on lots of fresh veggies from her garden and I figured this would be an excellent way to use them.  I did use a lot of veggies and had to use more broth, but the end result was great.  I used fresh from the garden squashes (3 varities), potatoes, green beans, and tomato.  I also used crushed tomatoes in puree instead of the tomato sauce.  I served it with crusty french bread and it was great.  I just wish I had enough veggies to make another pot.

This became an overnight favorite in our home.  There is a fair amount of prep time however.  Lots of chopping.  A food processor helps a lot.  We substituted diced tomatos in sauce for the plain tomato sauce.  A nice add.  We did need additional liquid however.  Great recipe!  You'll love it!

I made this last night and we had it for dinner tonight.  Absolutely delicious.  I added a can of white beans just because I like them in soup.  Also, I noticed the soup didn't have a lot of liquid, so I added a can of V-8 juice and this seemed to give it just the right amount of liquid.  I love it and will make it again and again.

This is really great soup!  It is so hearty and so tasty.  My husband has been eating the leftovers for lunch and after three days is still not sick of it!  I loved it!

This soup is extremely tasty, but even more so after a day or two in the fridge! Beware, this makes a huge pot!

I loved this more than my 12yr old son did.  I found it to be an easy, hearty soup that makes a good meal for quick re-heating at the office.  I used all broth instead of adding water, but have added water since, while reheating

I used this recipe as a base for my own minestrone soup. I omited some of the vegetables like spinach and zucchinni, and added brocolli, cauliflower, grated carrots, ground beef, etc. I also used dried herbs instead of fresh. This is a suberb recipe and one that is easily customizable! Great flavors no matter what you add to it!

I used navy beans in the place of kidney beans and used baby carrots. Be sure not to add the pasta until the end.

Very delicious.  It makes lots.  Had it for dinner with french bread. Had leftovers, brought it to work for lunch - co-workers loved it.  It was better on Day 3 than just made.
I too added one can more of chicken broth and 1 cup more of water.  I also used tomatoe sauce with garlic and basil instead of adding it earlier.

This was a very easy and yummy soup - lots of savory veggies and enough leftovers for a couple of great lunches!  I let the veggies simmer about 1 1/2 hours - that seemed like just enough.  Great soup!

This soup was really good.  I did't add the wine and I added anothere 2 cups of broth because I wanted it a little more soupier.  It was wonderful with a loaf of fresh sourdough bread.  A real keeper.

This was great!  It's been unseasonally hot here, so I wanted something light and easy--and this fit the bill!  Serve with some crusty french bread, and you have dinner!!!

Next time, I think I will cut the zucchini in half, add a cut up potato, and 1 more can each of broth and tomato paste--it got REALLY thick on me the second day.

But, still perfect.....  Thanks for sharing Jamie!  Keep creating more!!!  :-)

This is an excellent  soup.  If you are going to simmer longer than the recipe specifies, add more  broth.  It really does  get  thick.

I was looking for something easy and hearty and this fits the bill.  Everyone liked it and were surprised that only one bowl was enough.  It is very filling.  I was lucky I planned to share this with a couple of sick friends because it makes a huge pot.  If I make it again just for my family, I will cut it in half.

This was the minestrone recipe I was looking for.  I was tired of the watered down versions that you get most of the time.  Jaime's recipe has the heartiness to satisfy.

This was a superb soup, although really more like a stew.  I added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and cooked the pasta in the soup. I let it simmer for about 2 hours which really improved the flavor.

Thank you, Jamie, for this great tasting, simple recipe!!
I discovered this excellent recipe on here years ago. I have recommended Jamie's Minestrone Soup to strangers for  almost 10 years now. I have taken her basic recipe and made some minor modifications. I try to use all organic ingredients, when possible. I add an extra can of red kidney beans.
For convenience, I use a frozen organic Mediterranean Blend of veggies from Whole Foods, which contains almost everything I need. For extra protein and Vitamin B12, I'll bake a half (or whole) chicken breast, cut it up, and add it to the soup. I NEVER cook or ADD the pasta to the soup directly! I always refrigerate the left over soup and pasta separately. Some good grated Reggiano Parmesano on top is the "icing on the cake". P.S. I strongly recommend using cannelloni beans, NOT a substitute.

For this, I believe I end up making a larger portion than the recipe says (have a really big pot that I always make when I make it).  I love garlic and always add a great deal more than this recipe ever calls for.  You can substitute 1 heaping tsp of basil and oregano, as fresh is more expensive / doesn't keep long......also lets you have them on hand in the future and for other cooking.

I also tend to use cannelini beans rather than the kidney, since so much is already red in here lol.  I wait to add the spinach after I bring the pot to a boil, which causes spinach to wilt quickly that lets you cram a whole bunch in.  I end up buying 2 lbs, and I often will add any remaining spinach to the leftovers over time.

Lastly, if you buy everything "normal" (meaning not the unsalted varieties) you will probably still end up with less sodium in the end product.  However, I get everything "no salt added."  You will not miss the salt.

This was delicious!  I didn't cook the pasta separately, I just threw in 2 cups ten minutes before it was done.  I think the only thing I would do differently next time is use real green beans instead of canned.

Made it/loved it and FYI switch your broth to veggie broth and omit the parm cheese at the end and you have an amazing VEGAN soup

If I'm making an all vegetable/ pasta soup, I don't want to use chicken broth in it.  I change that every time & use vegetable broth instead. I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe,  although I used a little more or a little less of some of the ingredients- depending on what I had on hand- it is fairly close. I did add a can of diced tomatoes & more green beans then called for & used already sliced carrots, so I'm not sure how many there are. I just dumped it all in. I don't think 30-40 minutes is enough cook time,  so it simmered much longer. Keeping the pasta separate doesn't work for me because I plan on freezing several containers for my evenings when I don't want to cook, so after cooking pasta separately,  it's added to the pot too. I'm hoping my non-vegetarian husband will like it too! I will make it again, even if it's just for me.

This is a hearty and flavorful soup. I doubled the chicken broth to 4 cups, substituted white wine for red, and doubled the pasta to 1 cup. An ideal soup for a fall or winter day, and would pair well with grilled cheese sandwiches for a complete meal.

Blackeye Peas, Fresh Butternut Squash, Fresh Green Beans !

This soup was excellent! Hearty and full of flavor. I was looking for a recipe that seemed forgiving so that I could make substitutions based on what ingredients I had on hand. I included everything the recipe called for with these substitutions/modifications: 

1 yellow onion + 1/2 white onion; 1/2 c chopped celery; roughly half of a fresh butternut squash peeled and cubed in lieu of carrots; cab for the red wine; 1 can blackeye peas in lieu of kidney beans; 1 large handful fresh green beans that I then chopped into 3rds; dried oregano and basil in lieu of fresh (remember to adjust accordingly - general ratio is 1:3 dried to fresh). Simmered just under an hour until squash and green beans were tender.

Cooked spiral pasta separately (al dente) then added to pot of soup just before serving.

Topped with fresh grated parmesan and sprinkling of capers.
------------------------------
For those few minority reviews that complained it was too tomatoey - perhaps they mistook "cups" for "cans?" For example, 4 cups tomato sauce is really just two of the standard 14.5 oz cans, and 2 cups broth is just one can. (It's soup - the ounces don't have to be exact! ;) )

This minestrone is by far the best I have ever eaten! The only ways I varied from the recipe as written were to add a couple  small diced garden tomatoes that needed used and since I didn't have red wine, I added a few splashes of balsamic vinegar, salted each layer as I went since I was using unsalted chicken stock, added a sprig of fresh rosemary, and omitted the parmesan rind (sprinkled grated parmesan on in each bowl instead). I am not a huge fan of beans so I pureed the beans and broth--didn't taste them or have to deal with the texture I hate, they just effectively disappeared. I loved the fact this came together relatively quickly and used ingredients that are mostly staples.

It makes a ton - so great for food prepping! I love that you can throw all kinds of veggies in it. 
I used 4 cups chicken broth. Instead of just spinach I used a spinach/chard/kale mix and added an extra cup of it. Onion powder instead of chopped onion worked fine. I threw in some salt but honestly, due to the extra broth, it didn't need it. 
The soup is hearty, delicious, and simple! A PERFECT winter soup.

I put a can of diced tomatoes, reduce sauce to 2 C. The wine is important for a more complex flavor. Otherwise a great recipe. Who said soup is just for winter?

This has been a staple for years around our home. Last year introduced it as a harvest meal and it was such a hit, it was highly requested this year again. I make a double batch in my stock pot and follow the recipe relatively closely. 
 I'll add an extra can of kidney beans, extra garlic too. 
 For the harvest crowd I add ground beef to make it more filling for everyone working in the fields.  I freeze ahead and warm it on the day needed.

Terrific example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  I usually omit the wine, use 4 cups broth (no water), make more pasta because I've got kids, and rough chop the spinach and add it in the last 5 mins or so so it doesn't fall apart completely.  THIS is my minestrone recipe.

This soup is absolutely excellent. I use a tetra pack of veggie broth and a 28oz can of tomato sauce (not water or wine) and it comes out perfectly. I’ve also subbed cannellini beans for kidney beans because it’s what I had in the pantry. I make this severalThanks for the great recipe!

I made this for a friend home from the hospital following a heart attack. She needed to be on a heart healthy diet. I made enough to take and to keep. They loved it and asked for the recipe. It is a hearty, comforting soup. Our family loved it too. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect.

Really good recipe!  Made a couple changes, left the celery out (daughter despises it), added a can of fire roasted tomatoes, added a couple of yellow squash, used vegetable broth instead of chicken (to make it vegan), used mainly broth rather than water for flavor. Everyone really enjoyed it, and the leftovers too!

Doubled the garlic. Instead of tomatoe sauce use 1 can tomatoes paste and 1 can diced tomatoes. 4 cubes of trader Joe's frozen chopped chili's for mild heat. All stock instead of water-best is combo of 4c chicken and 4c veg. Added extra carrots, celery, can of chicken peas.

Great soup, and easy to make too! I subbed the tomato sauce for some of my home-canned tomatoes, and used a bag of frozen mixed veggies in place of the canned green beans. Perfect way to warm up on a frigid day! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Husband loved it when I made it and commented again about how he liked it the next day as leftovers.  My daughter has a friend who is vegan so next time I may substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth so she can enjoy it too!

I loved this!  It was delicious.  I added some potatoes since they needed to be used up, didn't have the wine, and am vegetarian so I used water instead of the chicken broth.  I also didn't have tomato sauce so used chopped tomatoes.  I let it simmer for 4 hours, and it was delicious, even better the next day!

Cooked it for about 3 hours, doubled the garlic, crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, increased the red wine, used all homemade chicken broth instead of water, dried oregano and basil, whole wheat dilatini pasta to add more of a chewy bite and frozen green beans. Added the zucchini near the end of cooking so it wouldn't turn to mush.  This was very good!  To be made again!

I love this recipe!
I didn't have several ingredients this time but it turned just as delicious as last time. Substituted potatoes for pasta, broccoli for squash, kale for spinach and nothing for carrots. I didn't have enough tomato sauce so I put in 2 small cans Italian stewed tomatoes and added olives for color.
Thank you for this, its my go to recipe now.

My husband is Italian and we made this for the first time. Great recipe! I substituted cannelloni beans for the green beans and will probably up the bean ratio next time, but this was a hit with the entire family!! We will make this again!

I've been looking for homemade soups to make as a healthy, low-sodium option to share with my aging parents. We make Jamie's Minestrone on a regular basis and everyone enjoys it. We wanted a richer taste without the wine, so we substitute beef broth for the chicken broth and we often simply skip the pasta altogether.  Making it again tonight!

I’ve made this three times and absolutely delicious.  Everyone really like it and I didn’t make much change except used baked beans as didn’t have kidney beans and didn’t have fresh herbs so used dried.   Would definitely recommend.

Outstanding!   I pretty much stuck to the recipe except for a few minor changes.  I used fresh green beans in place of canned. I didn’t have fresh spices on hand so used dried.  I used marinara sauce with the red wine.   I also simmered this for 2 hours.

This was very good and it was easy. I will make it again but I will add an extra cup of water, an extra cup of broth and an extra cup of tomato sauce because with so many vegetables in there, it was thicker like a stew rather than a soup.

I followed the recipe except for using vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.  It turned out great.  So much flavor.  I doubled the recipe and took it to work for a potluck in a crockpot and it was a big hit.   Next time I might add some more kidney beans - one can didn't seem enough with all the veggies!

Very good recipe and easy to make.  I did need to reduce the sodium for my  mother.  I used unsalted chicken broth (4c and left out 2c water),  4c. no salt added diced tomatoes instead of sauce, no salt added kidney and green beans - it is very tasty and she loves it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We love Minestrone ! And I know like most soups, it's very forgiving.. I had made as is before and it was too "tomatoy" for my taste. So this time, I only used 2/3 the amount of tomato sauce called for and extra broth to make up for the missing liquid. I skipped the wine. I didn't have any zucchini so substituted some bell peppers. Also dried herbs for fresh, about 1/3 the amount, as dried herbs are stronger than fresh.
It was delicious and we enjoyed it for lunch with some crusty bread.

I used a dark vegetable broth to keep this vegetarian and included a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Corn was a good addition (instead of spinach). I chose an alphabet pasta. (future note: Might adjust servings to 6, so there are some leftovers for our family of 4.)

So easy and so good!!! Did all chicken broth instead of half water as others have said.  Added a bit of extra garlic and spinach because we like them.   Cooked and added the pasta separately.  It was amazing!

I made this it was excellent. I just added some leftover veggies I had from a recipe the night before. Red and orange bell peppers, yellow squash, zucchini and eggplant.

I've made this twice. The first time without the zucchini (I completely forgot. The second with the zucchini. Both time it was a huge success. My mother-in-law, who can be difficult to please, LOVED it.  She actually asked me to make it again. Once the veggies are cut, the recipe is a breeze. Perfect for the cold weather. It has the flavor of a soup that's been cooking all day without  it taking all day.  I didn't use the red wine and I think I might add another cup of water next time to thin out the the tomato soup a bit.  Overall, a filling, healthy soup!

I’ve made this many times. It’s delicious and can be made with any vegetables. I add a can of chick peas.

This is really excellent, no exaggeration. The only changes I made were personal likes, i.e., 1 cup of chopped celery instead of 2, 3 carrots instead of 5, 2 zucchinis instead of 3, frozen green beans instead of canned, 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 2 + 2 cups of water, and I used Navy beans instead of kidney beans (which I dislike).  I also used Merlot for the red wine. Absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written. I was shocked and disappointed that the 1/2 cup of seashell pasta didn't go further. I ate an entire bowl of soup and I don't think I had a single pasta in my bowl. When I think of minestrone, I think of all the wonderful veggies and the pasta. If I were to make it again, I'd probably quadruple the pasta, and cut the onion amount in half. It left a overly strong taste for my liking. The soup was mediocre.

Delicious and not as time consuming as one would think.   I used vegetable broth vs. chicken. Also took the advise of other reviewers and went with 4 cups of broth and  2 cups of tomato sauce vs. 2 cups of broth and 4 cups of tomato. I added all the recommended ingredients plus yellow squash. I noticed the list of ingredients didn't show green beans however the video does, we added the green beans. Served with a side salad and warm bread. It was delicious. Anytime the 17 year old son gets seconds of a meatless meal you know the meal was a win!! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Amazing!  Like others, I tweaked it based on our favorite veggies. I cut down the onions to one, added canned mushrooms, fresh green beans, a can of low salt while corn, and a can of garbanzo beans. Agree with reviews to cook the pasta separately. The 12 year olds? They love it!

If the food is bland, it is the fault of the cook not necessarily the recipe.  Anyone should be able to  add flavor to food.  My only change would be  add the fresh herbs may be just 10 minutes before serving because otherwise they lose their flavor.  I sometimes use frozen veg also.

This was a huge hit at our house. I let it simmer for about an hour and I think that it really helped to boost the flavor. I made a pull-apart garlic cheesy bread on the side. The family was  very complimentary.

Awesome recipe.  I used a crockpot instead of the stovetop and it turned out quite tasty.  I also dumped some leftover pasta in towards the end instead of right as I was serving, so it soaked up a bit of the liquid and made it really thick, a little too thick for me to honestly still call it soup.  But it was still delicious and I'll be making it again!

Made a few modifications and turned out great. Ended up making much more than need so will cut recipe in half next time.  Instead of 3 zucchinis/use 2; use marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce; add sliced mushrooms, tomato paste, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.

Best minestrone soup I’ve ever had! I used dried herbs because that’s all I had. I also didn’t have zucchini or spinach so I used two cans of white beans. The red wine definitely made it. Yum!

Love this soup!  So fresh tasting.  I would give it a 4 1/2 stars because I did add some chicken bouillon powder at the end because it just needed a little something.  But overall, loved, loved the soup!

Made this today... after reviewing the recipe yesterday morning.  I knew it would be killer to make make a double batch and can up a few extra quarts to grab in a pinch later this winter.  I reduced the zucchini by half and added some potatoes, plus I used an additional can of chili beans.  The soup was incredible today and we are super excited to try our canned quarts on a super cold day with some fresh bread!!

My husband and I liked this recipe - my kids less so.  I cooked my pasta with the soup so I didn't have another pot to wash and I waited to add the spinach in the last few minutes of cooking.  I used more pasta than it called for so I should have added more chicken broth.

I added 4 potatoes , used 5 cups chicken broth, omitted the tomato sauce, and subbed white wine for red. Also pureed about 3 cups of the soup to make it thicker. Everyone loved it!

Soup is great! Would've given 5stars but definitely had to spice up- added Worcestershire, tomato paste and some other seasonings. Just need to season to your taste..Everything else about recipe is great!

Delicious! Per other reviews, I threw a parmigiana rind in for flavor. Used all chicken stock, no water, and added beans and veggies we like. Loved it! Will make again!  My Italian neighbors said it was the best minestrone ever!

Really good. I make this about once per winter/fall.  Sometimes I use variations on the vegetables, depending on what I have on hand, and sometimes I add beef or chicken.  Taste a lot at the end to see if it is salty enough for you.

Perfect Fall vegetable soup.  Used fresh beans, small amount of kale, swiss chard, fresh basil and oregano, zucchini and canned tomatoes (rather than tomato sauce). Added some cheese rind as suggested by another review.  Used 6 c chicken stock and no water.   Don't need a lot of vegetables to make a lot of great soup.

I did to taste w/the broth/sauce and used beer instead of wine (one small can each); used mix of frozen/fresh zuchinni, mushrooms/sweet potato and can bean.  
my kids prefer bowtie pasta- otherwise, they loved the soup, esp my pescetarian!

A great recipe for leftover veggies! Really can't go wrong if using basic herbs, pasta, and tomato sauce. Next time I will add Italian meatballs.

This soup turned out awesome. The batch was big even after only making half. That's okay though because leftovers tomorrow will be just as good. Looking forward to is. My husband says if this were in a restaurant he would recommend it to all his friends.

This is a great minestrone. Get depth of flavor in broth by adding Wine, water with boulion . Add garlic powder, and seasoning salt, sea salt and ground pepper to soup. Also use 4 cups of tomatoes sauce with sea salt added. Put veggies in and serve with bread. Wonderful mibestrone,  Really great!

I gave this 4 stars because I had to make some changes, but overall it turned out very well. I had to double the broth and water because it was very chunky with very little broth. Also, instead of half a cup of wine I used half a bottle. This recipe makes a LOT of soup. I didn't realize it and was cooking for 2. But that's ok; it makes great leftovers!

I've made this twice now.  I can't keep any leftovers by the next day it's all gone. My boys love meat so I added ground turkey to the recipe and it was great. I think is easy and delicious.

This recipe is amazing! I wouldn't omit anything, but I added a couple extra ingredients. I made it using 4 cups of chicken broth, 2 cans of kidney beans, and a can of diced  Italian tomatoes. It goes well with French bread topped with mozzarella cheese and a side salad!

The soup was very tasty. Instead of tomato sauce  I used a big can of whole tomatoes that I crushed up into the pot. I ended up not adding pasta but loved the Parmesan on top.

Loved the soup.  I did make a few modifications, 1) used 4 cups low sodium chicken broth and one cup water, 2) 2 cans of beans (cannellini  and kidney beans), 3) entire batch of fresh oregano and basil I got from the store, probably 4-5 TBSP each, 4) 1/4 TBSP of cayenne pepper, 5) mixed in some orzo into the soup, no pasta shells, 6) did not use spinach or the green beans as my pot was not big enough and would have boiled over!, 7) no wine, 8) and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

Was very good, did make a ton of soup and i like that as i like to freeze some from every batch i make.  Do cook pasta separately as it doesn't absorb all the liquid in the soup.

I cannot review the recipe as written because I didn't make it as written, but as a starting base, this was excellent. 

Instead of chicken broth & water, I added four cups of vegetable  broth to make this an entirely vegetarian dish. I also cut the serving sizes most of the vegetables in half since several of the comments mentioned that this recipe makes a ton. It still made a lot even with cutting things in half. I omitted the wine and used two cups of tomato sauce with a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes (with the sauce) in place of the four cups of tomato sauce. I don't like the texture of zucchini, especially cooked, so I diced a medium potato and added that instead. I used frozen green beans instead of canned since I find they hold up better in soups and stews. Lastly, I substituted 3/4 cups of ditalini pasta for the shells. 

One things many of the comments mentioned, which I did not do, was add extra broth. Between the pasta and adding potatoes, all of my liquid was soaked up. I will probably add eight cups of veggie broth next time. 

I served it with some freshly made Italian bread and it was a delicious, hearty meal on a cold wintery night.

Very tasty soup and easily adjusted to your tastes.  I didn't have zucchini or spinach on hand, but threw in a bunch of chopped fresh parsley and tomatoes.  Fresh or frozen green beans are a much better choice than canned, which are always soggy and limp.  I like the method of cooking the pasta and not having it simmer with the soup because it doesn't have a chance to get mushy.  Like other reviewers, I needed to add more liquid.  I also sprinkled cooked bacon bits on top with the fresh Parmesan cheese.  Yum!

Loved it!  Made a few changes based on what was in the pantry. Used both chicken and beef broth (which gave it a rich taste). 2 cans of kidney beans, corn from 2 cobs, jarred oregano and basil, 3 cups of spinach and put it in the crock pot.  Husband LOVED it.  Made corn muffins and that was dinner!

Very healthy & hearty soup.  I added cannellini beans, zucchini, yellow squash, Italian style diced tomatoes.  But without these  extras it is still a very yummy soup.  So glad that this recipe was posted, thank you.

I made this soup for my family tonight and it was absolutely delicious! Perfect a for a rainy day! I added  chicken flavored bouillon instead of salt, and omitted the Parmesan cheese. We added crushed red pepper to season, and it was amazing!! I will definitely be adding this soup to my regular dinner rotation. Thanks!

I made some minor changes but this was very well received by my family.  I used one can of tomato sauce and and one can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano.  I used a 4 cups of chicken broth as it was very thick.   Added a can of chick peas as well. Omitted the wine.  Delicious!

This was delicious and makes a lot of soup!  It heats up well and tastes just as good when leftover as when fresh.

I have also been making this minestrone for years and it is always a hit with my family.  Usually make it exactly as stated with the addition of some diced tomatoes ....and sometimes potatoes if my son is home.  Great, healthy recipe!

This is an excellent recipe! Only minor change was less spinach and 1 can of diced tomatoes in garlic & oregano (drained). Flavor was right on the money!!

I just made this recipe. I would make it again. I did use the wine. I used Berenger Merlot. Anyway, very good. I feel it has a better taste than Giana's. I would recommend this recipe.

Fantastic recipe! Huge hit with the family and 16 guests. I added two cans of beans, Great Northern, and light red kidney. I also used 6 cloves of garlic and an additional can of tomato puree.

Fantastic soup!!  I made it twice in four days and it was a winner at both parties.   I did not have tomato sauce so I used canned stewed tomatoes with a bit of tomato paste the first time.  The second time I used one can of tomato sauce and I didn't like it as well.  I am going to stick with the stewed for sure!  No sauce for me.  Added more veggies and especially fresh green beans and cannaneli beans along with the kidney beans.  More pasta, not shells, the other one people were talking about in the other reviews.

No changes to the recipe. I prepared it exactly as written and served it with sandwiches for my husband's family for lunch. It was perfect! The seasonings were perfect, the heartiness was perfect and the satisfied smiles on everyone's face was perfect!  Thank you verr much! - *in my pseudo Elvis voice*

Great recipe. I added in a bay leaf and substituted chicken broth with 8 cups of water and 5 chicken boullion cubes. Skipped the wine as it made it too sweet. Best minestrone I've ever had.

Made this soup last night and I thought it was fantastic! I took some advice from the comments and replaced 1/2 c tomato sauce with water, but other than that I didn't feel like it needed any adjustments. Using fresh herbs really made a difference! Perfect for a chilly evening!

A great soup all around! A few alterations I made: 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 32oz box of chicken broth, 1 can of Italian style diced tomatoes, only 2 zucchini, and 1 TBS each of dried basil and dried oregano.

Loved this soup!  I looked at most of the Minestrone recipes on this site and decided on this one...very glad I did.  I made it as stated, except fresh green beans instead of canned, 4 cups chicken broth instead of water.  Oh, and as was on a different Minestrone recipe, a (generous!) pinch of red pepper flakes, because I put them in pretty much everything for a little kick.  It made a lot so the next day I had to add more liquid (more tomato sauce and chicken broth) because the veggies absorbed a good bit of the liquid.  I thought the guys I cook for would complain that there's no meat, but they didn't...it was very hearty and filling.  Thank you for recipe and I will make it regularly.  Super healthy too!

We leave out the pasta and add browned ground  pork or chicken. Also add green beans and 2x as much spinach. One of our favorites.

I modified this a bit -- I threw it all in the crock pot to cook overnight on low.  Added more water, added more spices.  Hubby hates vegetables, but he LOVED this.  Any vegetable works fine, just throw it all in the pot...

Good recipe but doesn't make enough broth. I'll definitely increase the liquids and decrease the vegetables next time. I also found the wine a must (made it initially without it and it was bland so I added it in and cooked for additional 15 minutes).

I made this soup for a church potluck and it was gone instantly!  Everyone loved it.  I used vegetable broth to keep this minestrone recipe vegetarian.  I also used 1 quart of tomato sauce I had put up from my garden, and 4 c vegetable broth, no water.  I chopped up some cabbage too and added that instead of spinach just because I had it on hand.  It was delicious!   P.S. My dad who barely eats anything now, really enjoyed this soup too.  Heartfelt thanks for sharing this recipe, Jamie.

This was very good.  I made it in the crock pot.  I did not saute any vegetables, just threw everything except spinach and pasta in crock pot and cooked all afternoon.  I did add a dash of chipotle tabasco, Worcestershire, extra garlic, and salt and pepper.  45 minutes before eating I added heaping cup of sea shell pasta and 1/2 bag of baby spinach.  I did not use any water, but used extra chicken broth to accommodate for the lack of liquid.

Excellent soup! I did have to add more broth though, almost double the amount. Didn't have any wine open, so didn't add. As my own touch, I added a can of diced tomatoes. Will make again.

This soup was so delicious! The only changes I made were using veggie broth instead of chicken and using fresh green beans. This is a great vegetarian meal! My non-vegetarian family even loved it and asked me to make sure and keep the recipe.

This soup is delicious. I made some changes after reading other reviews here. First of all, I made the soup in the crockpot. I love the idea of putting a recipe together, and going about my day while supper is cooking. I added two cans of chicken broth, two cans of diced tomatoes, two zucchini, one yellow squash, and green beans. They all came from our garden and I had blanched and froze them, Next, I added three carrots, two stalks of celery, and one onion.A 10.5 oz bag fresh spinach,  I added a clove of garlic, and 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 tsp dried basil. It cooked low all day. An hour before eating, I added a 1/2 cup elbow macaroni . I omitted the kidney beans as my husband doesn't like them., I served a salad and grand biscuits with our meal. This recipe makes so much, my crockpot was full. We have plenty left to have again tomorrow night.

Delicious. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. No celery? Add Anaheim Peppers. Used Safeway organic broth, not low sodium and no water and no wine. Lots of heirloom tomatoes, so I used  Black Krims instead of canned. Used one can of Garbanzos. Frozen green beans. No spinach. Italian seasoning and a ton of fresh basil. Not as salty as it probably would have been, so I added a little salt.

My favorite minestrone ever! Super easy to adjust to your own liking :) I always use a jar of marinara sauce and a little bit of canned tomato sauce + vegetable bouillon in place of the herbs and chicken broth. I don't use zucchini and just add whatever vegetables I feel like that day! Don't be afraid to play around with it- it's a very forgiving recipe!

This was very yummy. I forgot the celery and made it non-traditional by adding grass fed beef and instead of using broth from a can used a condensed vegetable broth. It was delicious, even my 12 yo loved it! I also used veggie noodles to make this as healthy as possible. Thanks!

Yummy soup for a fall or winter day.  I didn't have wine but will add it next time.  I used fire roasted corn and fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic and with Italian seasoning, kidney beans and black beans.  I used stock from chicken I had cooked for pulled bbq sandwich, recipe from this site, added Multi colored bow tie pasta  since I didn't have macaroni.  Needles to say we ended up with a lot of soup, but family and friends were happy to share!  This is definitely a recipe I will use again!

This recipe is amazing. One of the amazing things about it is that it's so versatile. Anyone can make substitutions, adjust portions, add what they want, omit what they want, and it's still a fantastic soup. EVEN AS IS.... It's awesome.  My husband will be home from a nursing home after suffering from a stroke. He's been gone for 2 years and will be coming home on Tuesday. His request for his home coming meal is this minestrone soup.

Great! Very tomato saucy and I only added 3 cups tomato sauce. So will just add more water or chicken broth. This soup thickens nicely. I also added a grilled Italian sausage with the cooked pasta in the bowl and scooped the hot soup on top and waa la! This soup is fun because there are so many variations you can try to suit you taste and families taste!

Great recipe! I decided to make a smaller batch without wine (but with delicious leftovers, of course!), and I cooked it on low in the Crock pot for 7 hours (minus the noodles, and spinach). I didn't use cheese (personal preference) as a topper. I served it with a side of French bread, and extra virgin olive oil/balsamic vinegar/pepper to dip it in. Delicious outcome!

Great time for this recipe with all the fresh zucchini from the garden. I didn't have chicken stock or tomato sauce so I substituted beef stock and a can of san marizano tomatoes and used fresh garden beans instead of canned.

I only make low sodium versions of soup, modifying recipes as I go. This amazing soup needs no changes to be very low sodium. I left out salt, use no salt added tomato sauce and low sodium chicken broth and calculated about 90 mg per cup. From my parents to my grandchildren, we loved it. Thank you Jamie.

This is one of my favourite soup recipes ever.  The flavour is superb.  I make mine with bell peppers instead of zucchini as a family preference and I use a small amount of frozen spinach instead of the fresh.  We also substitute apple or grape juice for the wine.  The fresh herbs in this recipe really make it wonderful.  A keeper!

This is an absolutely wonderful soup!
My family loved it, and we had enough leftovers for 3 days.  It was quite a bit of work chopping up all those veggies,  bit it was so worth it when the soup was finished! I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth.  I recommend this since it's a vegetarian soup. It was so delicious.  I will definitely make it again and again!

Just the kind of soup I love! I use whatever veggies and beans I have on hand and it turns out delicious!!! For my minestrone soups, I always keep parmesan rinds. I throw them in the soup and it gives an amazing flavor.

This was a very tasty soup and also hearty. I think next time I would cut the tomato sauce in half. I think I would also use another can of beans (1 red kidney and 1 white cannellini) and maybe some diced potatoes. I didn't use any water and just used chicken broth in place of it. Overall, I was really happy with how this turned out. NOTE: it makes a really big batch so you may want to cut it in half if you don't have a crowd to feed.

I've made this so many times now and we just love it! Living here in the Tampa bay area we don't eat a lot of soups, just a little warm. The flavor of the vegetables are so fresh be sure to use fresh green beans if you can,and the little bit of bite from the Parmesan cheese finishes it off just right.

I crave olive garden's minestrone all the time. When it is warmer outside, this soup is so filling and delicious! And some bread and butter goes great with it haha! But seriously follow this recipe, and you will end up with a great soup to enjoy. There are always lots of leftovers since it is just my boyfriend and I.

My teenage son loves the Old Spaghetti Factory's minestrone soup.  I made this and he was stunned (so was I) at how close the flavour is.  Definitely a nice hearty soup with a great zesty taste.

This was very good.  I used 4 cups of chicken broth and no water.  I did not use the spinach because I forgot it and added a pinch of paprika and cumin for a little added flavor.  I used all the veggies called for and thought it was the perfect amount.

This was GREAT!  I altered just slightly-- used vegetable stock (3 cups),  1 , 28-ounce can of diced tomatoes, used dried oregano (1 tsp) and I omitted the green beans because I'm not a huge fan.  I will make this again, and again, and AGAIN. Not only did it satisfy my meat eating husband, but to my surprise, my picky 3 year old gobbled it up as well! Thank you!

I made it nearly exact to recipe except used fresh green beans cut smaller and then used dried spices. I felt it could've used a bit more seasoning, but the real Parmesan cheese ontop made it great!!

I make this soup all the time. At least once a month if not more and then eat it for multiple meals, multiple days. I have been asked by many for my recipe and I always give it to them with a couple of tweaks. I use all low sodium chicken broth, no water. I substitute half of the zucchini for diced red potatoes. I take about 2 cups of the soup, both veggies and liquid and blend it up to put it back in and create a thicker base. It's so good. People love it.

Thank you for posting this! I followed another recipe that was soooo bland and hardly editable. I came here to figure out what I needed to do differently and with the help of the tomato sauce (still can't believe that wasn't in the other recipe) and some of the veggies, I not only salvaged the other soup but my husband said it was one of his favorite dinners ever!

Super easy, and had great flavor. In the future, I'd add spicy sausage or chorizo. Reheated the next day, it wasn't as flavorful, so make sure to add salt and pepper to leftovers.

i liked it, however, i will use a bit more salt and garlic next time. Substituted Chard for the spinach since i had some in the fridge. Also, it ended up needing substantially more water, but that could be the size of the carrots, zucchini, and such. Curious if anybody has canned this recipe and if so could they lend some guidance

Delicious!  I used chick peas instead of the kidney beans and ditalini pasta instead of shells.   Loved all the veggies.  Great recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

This was FANTASTIC! I halved the recipe, and made minor changes based on other reviewers suggestions. I did more chicken broth instead of water, used fresh oregano and basil, and I only had apple cider vinegar, so I did a cap full of that instead of the red wine vinegar. Served in a crusty bead bowl- YUM!

This was an amazing soup. Perfect for a chilly winter night. I made a few changes based on others reviews:
*I used canelli beans and I puréed  them with a cup of the broth and added to the soup since my household is anti beans 
*I added a Parmesan cheese rind while simmering and took out before serving 
*i used white wine bc I didn't have red and it tasted fine 
* I omitted green beans 
* I made the pasta but didn't end up putting it in bc I served it with a side of crusty French bread instead 
delicious will make again

Great Minestrone! Didn't use red wine, only because I didn't have it on hand. I will definitely use the wine next time. I think that will add the deep flavor I like in a minestrone! This is a great recipe, everyone loved it! Will make again- my go to recipe for many minestrones to come!  Thanks!

I made this pretty much exactly as written and it was fantastic! I used a large can of crushed tomatoes and a small can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because I like my soup thicker. I also used 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth instead of 2 broth and 2 water.   I added 2 yellow squash and used tubettini pasta instead of egg noodles.  Everyone went back for seconds.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Healthy, hearty, and just downright yummy! I made this for dinner and even appeased a picky eater! I omitted the celery and green beans and added one more can of Cannolini beans. I also upped the (beef) broth to 3 cups to 1 cup of water. A delicious dinner staple! Thanks Jaime! :)

This is a fantastic recipe! Everyone in the family LOVED it! I used dried oregano and basil because I didn't have fresh and only 2 zucchini. I also used mostly chicken broth and only 1 cup of water.

This is a fantastic soup and very forgiving for modifications. I added extra beans (2 cans of kidney beans) and extra pasta (2 cups of ditalini). I used vegetable broth instead of chicken to make this a vegetarian soup. The red wine was a brilliant addition.  This is going onto the regular rotation in the winter!

This soup was amazing. I used 3 cups stock and 1 cup water. While I was chopping the veg I threw in a frozen rotisserie chicken carcass in to the canned stock. *THIS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD* if you can't use homemade chicken stock, do this, you won't regret it. I also didn't have any fresh seasoning song used powdered. I took out the green beans and used cannelloni. I used only one giant onion instead of 2  and I did a mix of crookneck squash and zucchini. This is going in the repeat pile!!!!

Made this soup and loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe as written with minor changes to suit my taste and based on things I had on hand. I froze some of the soup in small portion sizes for quick easy meals. The soup freezes well and did not affect the texture of the pasta or veggies. I gave some to a friend at work and she asked for the recipe...she loved the fact that the veggies were not soft and mushy but stayed barely crisp.  This is a hearty soup with good flavor - a must try soup.

This is a very hearty vegetable  soup. You really don't miss the fact that there is no meat. The pasta probably helps too. The chicken broth and tomato sauce base is a nice balance. The only thing that I did different was to steam some fresh green beans instead of using canned.

I loved this.  My hubby felt it was "too much tomato taste" so I may tone down the tomatoes next time.  Also the pasta soaks up too much of the liquid so I'll keep that for serving only.

I've made this a handful of times, it's one of our favorites. I use homegrown, preserved tomato sauce, grated & frozen zucchini, green beans & dried herbs. I freeze the leftovers to use for a quick lunch.

Delicious. I couldn't believe my three kids (all under 5) ate it and enjoyed it.  I used 2 zucchini rather than 3,  cut the veggies and onions really small and used vegetable broth instead of chicken  but other than that I followed the recipe and it was soooo good.

Used beef broth (16 oz)) and vegetable broth (32 oz) instead of water and chicken broth. Used cannelloni beans and pinto beans instead of green beans and kidney beans. Only

We LOVED how healthy and delicious this recipe is! I've made it twice in the past week. I halved the recipe each time for my small family. Made a few adjustments: not a huge fan of canned tomato paste, so I used about 2 cups of chopped tomatoes and only about 2 tablespoons of canned tomato sauce. Also didn't have oregano, so substituted some dried thyme instead, which gave it a wonderful flavour. Doubled the amount of noodles. Used no green beans and about twice the amount of kidney beans specified in the recipe. No wine. Served it with the herbed French bread from this site and it was a fantastic and very comforting meal!! Will be making this time and again.

I added more tomatoes and I only had 1 zucchini.  I did not add red wine.  
I let it cook all afternoon and served it on top the macaroni .
It was wonderful.  I would not have made it, without the recommendation.  When I finished it, I dumped the rest of the macaroni into the left overs.

Excellent Minestrone recipe! I did use both chicken stock and vegetable stock as well as crushed tomatoes and a can of peeled tomatoes.  Lots of fresh veggies- yellow squash, zucchini, green beans, spinach Carrots, celery, onion, garlic and ground herbs.  Also used small shell pasta and fresh grated Parmesan on top! My husband (who always says he doesn't like soup) LOVES this soup.  It definitely tastes better after being frozen and reheated.  Another tip if it tastes too savory you can add some sugar.

I made 8 quarts.  Everyone loved it.  Only changes I made was I only used 15 ozs of tomato sauce and I made the chicken broth using Knorr chicken flavored bouillon.  It is gluten free bouillon which we needed due to food allergies.  Prep work took awhile but this soup was seriously restaurant grade.  Will for sure make again.  Awesome!

I never make soup and I tried this because of Jamie's description on why she made this recipe. This is the best soup I've ever had ! The only changes I made is I added a very large can of green beans and of course all chicken broth, no water. makes a lot I froze half of it. I will make this again.  Also make sure you sauté the carrots for much longer and keep noodles separate in a container.

This is a great soup and honestly one of the best minestrones I have ever made. I did make a few changes and they were as follows:
-4 cups chicken broth instead of 2 broth and 2 water
-2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash
-I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes

Other than that the soup is perfect as is! Thank you!

I personally got only a taste of this.  We made it up to serve 100 at our Sr Ctr Fundraiser soup lunch where it got rave reviews.  I will be making this again.  The only place I didn't follow the recipe exactly was with the herbs - had no fresh, I used all dry.  Just a note, I used tomato sauce as per the recipe and it did NOT make it soupy. Perfect balance of all ingredients though I may have added a bit more pasta than required - it was quite thick.  Delicious.

Since discovering this recipe, I have made it several dozen times. It's so good, I've never even looked up another recipe for minestrone or vegetable soup. I too add diced and stewed tomatoes instead of sauce, but other than that I make no changes. It is just wonderful, and so healthy! I have made it for many friends over the years, and not once have they failed to request the recipe. This makes amazing soup!

After also looking for a more  hearty minestrone, this one hits the spot.  My whole family loves this recipe. Perfect for a child fall/winter day.  Perfect for potlucks or taking a meal to a friend.  Definitely a keeper.

Yum!   Healthy, healthy, flavourful, delicious.   I used fresh green beans instead of canned, and used half tomato sauce and half canned tomatoes (which I first buzzed with a hand blender).   I will definitely make this again.

I looked for a recipe to use fresh tomato and found this.  I used other suggestions and sub'd some beans for the pasta and squash and romaine for the green beans, spinach and spinach and zucchini.  It is a wonderful soup. I plan to freeze portions and expect the flavors to only improve.   Thanks. what a great way to save the summer.

I made this and used 2C turkey meatballs cut in half and also added chopped yellow squash and omitted the spinach and celery and used elbow noodles instead of shells, and 2 cans of tomato soup instead of sauce, and added 2T dried celery seed, and thyme. white wine instead of red.

I've made this MANY times, & I use what I have on hand.  I've also made it in the slow cooker, reserving the pasta until last or cooking the pasta separately. I've used potatoes in place of pasta, & avoided the pasta entirely!  I have blended this into a purée & called it pasta sauce for finicky kids! :) I'm making it again today, with extra zucchini!

Excellent! Everyone in my family liked this soup. I changed a few things, but only because I had a surplus of ripe tomatoes, and fresh green beans. Instead of the tomato sauce I dropped about 5 medium-sized beefstake tomatoes in a pot boiling water until the skins split. Then I peeled and chopped them and put them in the soup along with 1 Tbsp of tomato paste.

This was great!  My toughest judge - my 10 yr old loved it!  I have made it before and I find it's a versatile soup - I had to make adjustments to the veggies - whatever is on hand - red peppers instead of zucchini, no carrots but extra celery.  I only used 2 cups of tomato sauce & 2 extra cups of chicken broth and I did add the cup of red wine.  The spices is what makes it.  Delicious!

I used cauliflower instead of green beans. Replaced half of the tomato sauce with canned diced tomatoes, colored rotini instead of seashell pasta. Skipped the wine. Replaced water with chicken broth and added a cup more. Added a dash of red chili pepper. Still perfect! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

I make soup every Sunday in the winter time to eat for lunch during the week.  This is a delish hearty soup that will warm you right up. I do use more chicken broth (I prefer my soups to have extra broth for sipping : )

Turned out waaaaayyyy too thick. Unfortunate as it was rather time consuming. Giving it three stars because I used a six bean blend instead of kidney beans, and I halved the recipe, so it could ave been my adjustments that did it, but I wouldn't think it would change it to give it a stew consistency. Smelled yummy, though!

one of my favorite soups I've made yet! i personally love vegetables so i was very excited about making this recipe and i was definitely taken back by the wonderful flavors of fresh herbs. i did however add garlic powder, vegeta seasoning, Italian seasoning, and lemon pepper----minor changes. i also decided to add red wine as the recipe suggested which made it all the tastier. serve with croutons and (as the recipe states) Parmesan cheese on top! :)

I've used this recipe as a base a dozen times it's great! I omit tomato sauce, water and wine and use tomato purée and red wine vinegar instead. Amazing flavor, I get tons of compliments.

This was a wonderful soup for a cold rainy evening. I ommited the water and substituted with using all chicken broth as the other reviewers recommended, and added some red pepper flakes to the sauteed vegetables to give the soup some kick. I also used gluten-free penne which I cooked seperately so it held it's shape well and sprinkled parm flakes at the end. Cooked on the stove for about an hour. Beautiful flavor added by the red wine and I was able to freeze a large tupperware of leftovers!

I've made this recipe exactly as written, and changed the veggies depending on what I had on hand. My favorite addition so far is 1 package of dry beefy onion soup in the place of boullion and fresh onion. It really makes the entire soup! It freezes so well that I love that it makes such a huge batch!!! It's amazing, you won't regret making this!

Great versital recipe. If anyone has made soup before without recipes they would know leaving out the tomato base does not make it minestrone. It makes it chicken soup.. Cracks me up how people change things so much and then rate. I have my own version of minestrone I made up long ago. I had everything on hand left over from a winter garden for this one so gave it a go. Yes, I changed vegetables for our liking. But the base was the same. Yummy it was. Similar to mine only instead of tomato sauce I use half chicken and half pasta sauce. I do think the pasta sauce makes it thicker and packs more flavor but this way is just as good and will be put in my rotation.  Minestrone is my favorite soup and I make it more then others.

This recipe is outstanding. I used all chicken stock (instead of 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken stock). I also reduced the merlot for a minute or so (my wine of choice for this soup) before adding it; just a personal preference. I used frozen spinach. It was good but next time I will use the chopped spinach instead. Great taste. This one is a keeper!

Really good soup and a lot of it! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a crock pot. After sauteing the veggies, I dumped everything (except the noodles) in the crock pot, filled to the brim, and cooked on low for about 10 hours. Everything held up nicely, and there was a ton of broth. The fresh herbs made a big difference. For wine, I used Apothic Red, which was good in the soup and also served alongside it. I found that the soup needed a lot of extra salt to meet its potential, plus a little cayenne pepper. Otherwise pretty spot on! I used those sweet little organic carrots in mine, and they were tasty. I've been eating on this soup for days, shared several bowls with friends, and there's still a lot left.

Oh my goodness! This is the best minestrone recipe I have made yet! (and I love minestrone so I have tried many)It does make a huge batch so I just keep the pasta separate and freeze. So good and easily adjustable for substitutions.

A very simple and easy recipe to make. The whole family loved and we even had left overs that we froze and ate about a month later. I don't think there was much I changed other then subbing out vegetables that I didn't like for the ones I did.

Made as stated this is only a 2 or 3 star soup. But I managed to make it into a 4 star before my husband came home. I did tweak this recipe but only after tasting it and it didn't taste like minestrone, more like a bland tomato soup with onion. I noticed as it simmered that there wasn't going to be much liquid so I added 1 cup more broth and kept adding water as I saw fit (probably 2 more cups). Had to use a lot of salt as it lacked flavor and I am not a good enough cook to know how to use herbs or spices to add flavor to food. Way to many veggies. Love them but way way to many. I'll cut it down to half next time I try this (if I do). So finally it was done, and it was just alright, but it still lacked something. So I added lime to my dish (which I was wary of doing because I didn't know how good it would go with the Parmesan but it worked out). Ate two bowls. Husband ate without the lime and said it was ok for being my first time attempting this soup but he did eat another bowl a few hours later. 

Not sure if the servings are off or if it was the 3 extra cups of liquid added, but after 5 bowls of soup eaten, I still have over half the pot full. 

So if you live near me and want to try this soup, please come by for some.

Great base to start with. Here are my tweaks. 4 cups of veggie broth instead of the water. 1/4 cup tomato paste that I sauteed in with the veggies. 2 cans tomato sauce. 2 cups carrots, 2 cans beans(drained/rinsed), 2 cups of frozen fresh green beans, 3/4 cup of Cabernet Sauvignon, I also used dried basil and oregano and used about 2.5T-ish of each. I used a 1.5 cups of dried pasta that I cooked separately, drained then dumped directly into the soup.

This is a great base soup recipe.  I emptied my refrigerator of any vegetables that needed to be eaten soon, including some tomatoes (in place of some of the tomato sauce), a sweet potato, cabbage and frozen spinach.  I used 5 cups of frozen turkey broth that I had left over from making turkey carcass soup after Thanksgiving, no water. I used dried herbs as I did not have fresh.  I also added a 1/2 pound of browned Italian sausage.  The broth is incredibly flavourful.  It made a lot of soup and I will be enjoying this great soup all week.

I've made this several times now and it's fantastic!  I make this as directed, but I don't add the wine.  Also I only use fresh herbs when available, dried work just as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great hearty soup for a cold winters day. I changed up a few things: instead of green beans I used chick peas and instead of tomato sauce I blended a can and a half of whole tomatoes. I also added the pasta into the soup uncooked about 20 mins before it was ready. Turned out really nice very flavourful!!!

This was one of the best soups I've ever made!  I was looking for a recipe to use up some ingredients that I had, so my soup wasn't 100% according to the recipe but I don't think it would matter, the base was the same.  I added a couple of Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut up, about a cup of a corn/pea/carrot/green bean frozen vegetable mix instead of the can of green beans, and one whole can of white kidney beans instead of one cup red.  I omitted the red wine and used one large zucchini instead of three.  I used half of the amount called for of onion, celery and carrots.  I kept the ratio of chicken broth, water and tomato sauce.  Finally, I used whole wheat penne instead of shells, and cut them into shell-sized pieces once cooked.  We were really impressed with the results and will definitely be making it again!

Made it yesterday. Loved it. I used two cans of kidney beans instead of one. Also, I didn't have enough tomato sauce so I added some diced tomatoes, too. I think it was a good addition. Finally, the red wine adds a nice dimension - use it if you can. Get your freezing containers ready... This recipe makes a nice, huge batch. (I sent some to the neighbors.)

Great taste. I have to cut down on the spinach. I didn't use zucchini and added the shells to the soup before serving. The longer this cooks the better it is.

I made this for a youth group function that had about 50 people, so needless to say I had to up the quantities.  This was an amazing soup!!! I had so many compliments on it.  One note that I did and recommend not doing, I added the noodles way too early - so by the time I served it they were soggy and broke up.  They became the mystry ingredient that no one could figure out!!! Still yummy though.  Thanks for sharing this! :)

Great recipe!  Used one onion instead of two (only because they're not my favorite) and 1/2 c. quinoa (just to add more protein) per serving instead of the pasta.  I also had about a cup of leftover garbanzo beans, so I added those to the soup as well.  I love making a big pot of soup to have on hand during winter for lunches or whenever, so this was perfect!

Yum, loved this!  I used frozen green beans instead of canned and cooked the pasta in the soup to save time. I did add the wine which gave it a great flavor. It was very tomato-ey, but hubby and I really enjoyed it.  I cut it in half for just the two of us and it made four bowls. Will definitely make this again!

Made this recipe last week.  I followed it almost exactly.  I didn't use as much garlic or onion to accommodate my own preferences, I don't like too much of those ingredients in my recipes.  This recipe did take me about an hour and a half to make which is stated in the recipe so I was warned.  It ended up tasting a bit bland.  Maybe because I used tomato sauce with less sodium, or possibly because I cut out garlic and onion.  Also, the acidity of the tomato sauce upset my stomach as well as my bf's stomach.  If I were to make this again, I would definitely use less tomato sauce.

This is the best minestrone recipe. Remember to sauté the veggies with garlic and onion prior to throwing in the pot. You almost need to get some of them on the burnt side to bring out more flavor. I used all fresh veggies..no can's and slow cooked for 8 hours. It does taste on the lightly seasoned side but once you add the parmesan at the end it tastes perfect!

I made this recipe mostly as it is written and while it was good, will make some tweaks.  Way too tomato-y tasking with the tomato sauce so will just used canned diced tomatoes next time. I did add a dash of Worcestershire sauce that I liked. I will make again.

i'm a huge fan of making soups, but as written this seemed to lean more towards a very hearty tomato flavored stew.. i cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 an onion, 1 1/2 stalks of celery, 10 baby carrots cut into matchsticks, 3 cups of chicken broth, one 8 oz can of tomato sauce, canellini beans instead of kidney, 1/2 cup of frozen green beans, probably a little more spinach than called for, added 10 oz of italian seasoning ground turkey and made little meatballs out of them, one zucchini instead of 1 1/2, doubled the pasta and used the corkscrew kind,  1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning for the oregano and basil, a smidgen of ground thyme and a dash of cayenne.. in the future i'd add the zucchini's much later as we like our veggies more crisp and by the time everything was done the zucchini's were very soft.. i will give Jamie credit as the whole point of this recipe was to incorporate more veggies into the soup and reduce the salt which canned soups are notorious for.. it may be a bit much for most people.. but you get an A for effort.. ty for a great starting point

Fantastic!!! I made a few changes based on personal choices but I guarantee as written this rocks - hence a justified 5 star recipe. All I did was sub veggie broth for chicken broth and add Lima beans and potatoes.  Used dried basil and such because I'm cheap. Oh, and added a can of diced Italian tomatoes. Delicious, filling, and healthy. Yum!!

Side note - I suggest Quinoa pasta shells. That's the very best pasta brand. :)

I've used this recipe several times and as other reviewers have suggested I made substitutions and/or addition of veggies to fit my family's tastes.  It is amazing every time.  I always do all broth instead of water and broth.  I like to use yellow squash and zucchini.  I also use ditalini pasta instead of shells.  I've tried with cabbage instead of spinach and have found I like the spinach better.  But again, this recipe produces an amazing soup as long as you stick to the basic premise.

This is a great soup recipe.  I only changed one thing.  I did not add the green beans.  I did put a can of Kidney beans and a can of Romano beans instead.  My whole family loved this one.  I definitely will be making it again.

Love this recipe. Used homemade crushed Roma tomatoes for the base, scallopini squash instead of zucchinni (needed to use it up) and pretty much followed the recipe. Made a double batch to freeze half. Used some Eden Kamut small tube noodles cooked on the side! Delicious!

I'm about to be one of those totally annoying people who change the recipe. But here goes... I sauteed garlic and onion, then added sweet Italian sausage links. When that had cooked down for a while, I cut up the sausage with scissors then added 4 cups of chicken broth, 2 cans of Italian-style stewed tomatoes, some white wine, and let it come to a boil, then added everything else - 2 small zucchini, 1 small yellow squash, fresh basil, fresh oregano, a bag of frozen mixed veggies (corn, carrots, green beans, lima beans), a can of garbanzos, a can of kidneys, fresh kale and fresh spinach. Let it all cook down for an hour plus. When it was almost done, I realized I'd forgotten the fingerling potatoes I'd bought at the farmer's market, so I sliced them 1/4 inch and threw them into the boiling pot for 20 more minutes.

Ladled soup over big shell pasta and garnished with lots of fresh grated parm. It was to die for. 

Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm!

Just made the recipe tonight and it was delicious! So easy to make. The combination of chicken broth/stock and tomato sauce tasted like I had made it completely from scratch. I cut the recipe in half and still had leftovers after a family of 4 served. I bet it will be even better tomorrow. It certainly will be great on a cold, winter night. Thanks!

This soup is absolutely wonderful, just as good as a restaurants. The only thing I change bc it's alittle bland for us is to use 2qts of pure tomatoe juice instead of the sauce and water (healthier and less sugar) double the garlic and add more seasoning per taste but otherwise great soup I also add either a few chopped up tomatoes or a can of diced tomatoes and often 2 cans beans makes it just that touch more rich and hearty as we don't like watery soup

This recipe is good as a base start. When I made it as written it was a little bland. I suggest adding your own extra ingredients to your liking. Otherwise I really do like how simple this recipe is and easy to follow.

MADE A LOT OF CHANGES! USED BEAN STOCK INSTEAD OF WATER FOR MORE NUTRIENTS AND FLAVOR;(COOKED KIDNEY BEANS FROM SCRATCH AND SAVED STOCK); USED BOK CHOY LEAVES AND STALK INSTEAD OF CELERY AND SPINACH,OMITTED TOMATO SAUCE AND SQUEEZED A CAN OF DICED TOMATOES THROUGH A SIEVE INSTEAD,(USED EXTRA BEAN STOCK FOR LIQUID), OMITTED ZUCHHINI AND SUBSTITUTED MORE FRESH, FROZEN GREEN BEANS AS OPPOSED TO CANNED. NOW,IT IS FABULOUS!/arnetage68

I make this all the time, it is "comfort food" delicious! I never make a full batch unless I'm feeding a crowd; I just somewhat half it (I don't bother halving the canned foods). Also, I use dried herbs if I don't have fresh and it's just as good.

I made this recipe exactly as written with the omission of the pasta and addition of some crushed red pepper.  My family inhaled it and it will be added to our soup repetoire.

Amazing, delicious minestrone soup! I personally like to add the spinach separately, when the soup is about 15 minutes from being done simmering. The spinach seems to taste and look fresher that way. 

Please note that this recipe also makes a ton of soup! It ended up being closer to 10-12 servings, but the leftovers tasted so good, that none of it went to waste!

Such a hit! Like others, I modified to what I had on hand (used Kale instead of spinach for an extra health boost!). I also used all vegetable broth to make it 100% vegetarian. I saw one review comparing this soup to Progresso and had to laugh. If you're using mostly fresh ingredients and keep the canned ingredients simple, there is no way this recipe comes even close. Commercial canned soups are loaded with MSG and other preservatives one would never cook with in the kitchen.

This was easy to make and very tasty.  I followed the recipe in general, putting more or less of the veggies depending on what we liked.  It made a very big pot of soup.  I did not put in the tomato sauce but substituted 1can of diced tomatoes instead and a little tomato paste.  Added all broth instead of half water.  Nice hot bowl of soup for a cold day.  Great soup, will make this again.

This is my favorite soup.  I could eat it every day.  I used 32 oz of vegetable broth instead of water/broth.  I didn't have any zucchini, but I threw in about a cup of broccoli.  I cooked the whole thing in a crock pot on hi for about 6 hours.  It was amazing, I'll make it the same way forever.  I'm famous for my lasagna, and that's what I always make on Christmas Eve.  I had to remind people to eat the lasagna because everyone was helping themselves to a second and third helping of soup.  I served this soup, breadsticks, a simple salad and lasagna.  It was a delicious feast!

This was delicious and filling! Even my vegetable hating children liked it. I substituted a small can of tomato paste and 3 1/2 cups of tomato juice since I didn't have tomato sauce on hand. Also, I added an additional can of small white beans to make it heartier. Next time I may use more liquid since mine was less of a soup than a stew.

Recipe was great!  I changed the quantities to make a really full soup.  The one other substitute I made was including crushed tomatoes for some of the tomato sauce.  There is no real way to mess up this recipe!!  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I made this soup last night for dinner. A hit! I added 1/2 tsp of fresh-dried cilantro. Worked wonderfully. Like others have said, the recipe makes tons. I am freezing some for the rest of winter when I don't feel like cooking. 

Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious!  so thick and rich with lots of veggies.  The only change I made was using dried herbs.  thats only because its January in Michigan and fresh herbs are not too plentiful.  Otherwise, wouldnt change a thing!

I loved this!!!! And only minor changes. I am now meat products free and also staying away from extra/added oils and butter. So i cut those out and just a little PAM in the begining. I am also trying to eat more fresh veggies. So I used fresh green beans and also added dino kale 6 stalks. We like little kick so i added 1\2 teaspoon red pepperflakes. And last dried hrebs because of the long cook time. So great very happy eaters!

This was so easy and absolutely delicious!! I put a little too much tomato sauce so I added a little beef broth and it helped. Also threw in some asparagus. Will definitely make this again.

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic. I made some minor changes- I subbed two cans of petit diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil for the tomato sauce and I used all chicken broth instead of water. I also used an entire 9oz package of fresh spinach and threw a cup of uncooked sea shells in for the last 15 min of cooking instead of cooking separately. Oh, and I used dried herbs (half the rx amount for fresh). I left some at my parents today for them to reheat for dinner and my dad called me to tell me it was outstanding and better than carrabas minestrone that he had just had! With some tweaks to your taste, this recipe is 5 stars!!

I made this today and it was a really good base recipe. I did make some minor changes. I used dried herbs rather than fresh because that's what I had. I omitted the kidney beans, zucchini, and wine just a personal preference. I added 3 red potatoes and a can of petite diced tomatoes. I also used about 2.5c vegetable broth, 1c chicken broth, and 1c water. The broth came out a little thicker then I would have liked, probly because of the potatoes but I came out delicious. I think next time I'll just cook the noodles in the soup that way they'll cook in the flavor.. I also think I'll add more seasoning next time cuz I feel like it was still missing something! But overall delicious!

I've made this soup several times and really enjoy the chunky vegetables.  I tend to add a bit more seasoning for flavor (quite a bit more garlic, oregano, basil, parsley, and a bit of rosemary) but overall a great alternative to canned soup

Loved this soup! I skipped the pasta and added an extra can of (white) kidney beans. I also used a whole, 9-oz bag of spinach, stirring it in at the last two minutes. One more thing: I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, including one with chiles, as the tomato sauce. The Parmesan cheese in our bowls was the finishing touch! Very healthful and easy dinner.

Wow! We loved this recipe so much, I'd like to meet Jamie and shake hands! I made it for a chilly weekend in the mountains and it was just perfect. Don't leave out the red wine; it adds a nice level of richness. I had to use dried herbs; just adjusted measurements. For sauce, I used a large can and then pureed a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Do yourself a favor and make a big pot right now.

I ended up needing to add more liquid to the soup since I put in too many veggies.  I would recommend just adding the pasta to the soup to cook since separating it turned out to be inconvenient. I also would suggest adding any fresh herbs at the very last so they don't cook to a slimy texture.

This was a great soup! Made enough for two dinners for 4 people and then froze the rest.  I made this the crockpot and let it cook for about 5 hours and the vegetables were tender-crisp, not over cooked like some soups can be.  I used some of the reviewers suggestions and used all chicken stock and reduced the water to 1/2 cup.  I also used 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of fire-roasted, diced tomatoes.  Definitely add the wine!  I sauteed the onion, carrot and celery a few minutes just to get the flavors to blend and added everything to the crockpot.  Omitted the spinach and added a can of white beans.  The spices were perfect.  This is a keeper!!

Delicious!  I used the base in the recipe, but I also halved it with a canned stock base I had that consisted of tomatoes, carrots, onions & cabbage.  I did omit the zucchini and spinach just cause' I didn't have it on hand!

Made this for the first course of a progressive dinner for my daughter's group of friends.  It was "teenager approved"!!! It has been a year since I made this for them and they still come up to me and talk about my homemade soup.

This was fantastic. Made minor adjustments: Used 4 C chicken broth and 1 cup water. Large can of tomato sauce (29 oz) I just poured it all in. I subbed cannellini beans for the kidney beans based on personal preference and skipped the green beans. It tasted delicious- can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I substituted cauliflower and kale for the zucchini and spinach out of necessity, and it came out wonderful. I scooped out all the kale with whatever veggies came with it at the end and pureed it (its texture can be a bit rough), then put it back in the soup. Also used Italian-style canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. The entire family enjoyed it, including the 1-year-old. The taste is so hearty and wholesome.

Good! I used all chicken broth instead of half water, plus I added more broth toward the end because it was too tomato for me. Also added some Cavendar's Greek Seasoning.

Super delish recipe, although the ratio of veggies to broth is totally out of whack. As the recipe stands, it is more of a stew than a soup. And I didn't even include the spinach! I made it again with the same amount of broth/liquid but halved the amounts of veggies and it turned out much better, although I still had to thin it out some.  I also tripled the amount of pasta shells because you hardly notice one cup.

One of the few soups my husband likes is minestrone, which up until recently was courtesy of campbell's....I have tried a couple of recipes that didn't turn out so great, not enough flavor. This one is the winner, my husband will never again have minestrone from a can! Thank you Jamie! Fantastic flavor and chock full of great veggies. Changes made, I chopped the veggies smaller than suggested (personal preference) added 4 cups of chicken broth and no water, an extra can of beans (used canellini instead of kidney) and an extra can of green beans. I also used dried oregano and basil instead of fresh. Tasted great the first day so I know it will be even better tomorrow...looking forward to the leftovers.

This soup came out GREAT!  The only change I made was to add 3 small potatoes, peeled and cubed.  It made the soup a bit thicker, which I like.
This soup had a great flavor and this recipe is a keeper.

I made this soup over the weekend and it was delicious!  I didn't have regular tomatoe sauce so I added an entire jar of prepared marinara sauce.  It was awesome and I will make this recipe again and again!

This is one of my best go-to soup recipes! I (luckily!) found this recipe years ago and I make it regularly. My children ADORE it! Easy to adapt due to dietary restrictions or simply a missing ingredient. Truly, my family's FAVORITE minestrone recipe, ever!

I used HALF of the tomato sauce and used Rotel's spicy sauce. Added mild Italian Sausage (hubby has to have meat). Used the ditalini noodles as someone else said they don't get so soggy. This turned out awesome. And there is enough to freeze for another time. It would be great for an office potluck as it would feed about a dozen folks.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have made it according to the directions, and made one single change since. I use V8 instead of tomato sauce. Everything else I follow exactly. Delicious!

Tripled the recipe for the soup portion of a progressive college dinner.  It was well received and easy to make.  Make it vegetarian by subbing in veggie stock!

Friends loved this! I made a few changes based on the reviews and used double the chicken stock instead of the water, a bit more red wine and pasta and i used one can of whole tomatoes with its juices, smashed it and added tomato paste to make it thicker. It turned out delicious and healthy! Thanks!

You can use any kind of veggies on hand, which is the beauty of this recipe! Didn't have any beans so I added peas, corn, extra garlic and more spices - cumin, red chili flakes, chili powder and basil (because I LOVE some heat!). It's better to use smaller pasta and don't leave out the Parmesan, it really gives that extra oomph :)

Excellent!  Even with my modifications of no green beans and no spinach and my change to use fresh tomatoes and roast them and basil that came from a jar of pesto, and omitting the wine (it was for a church Lenten soup supper) and I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth and this was STILL an awesome recipe.

This is by far the best soup i've ever made.  And the way it is written makes super yummy soup.  I've now made this 4 times and have been changing it and having so much fun making it my own.  I recently made it and added shrimp and cabbage.  My other tip is to add 2 cans of tomato paste to the broth.  it really made it nice and tomatoe-y! i also doubled the green beans, skipped the wine and kept the water! Have fun!!

Made this for a viisiting almost-vegan friend. Used veg broth, subbed red potatoes for the zucchini and crushed tomatoes for sauce, as suggested in reviews, forgot the pasta and omitted the parm topping.  Dee-lish, needed salt.  Next time I will use 4 cloves of garlic, 3 onions, 3 cups of celery, 2.5 broth and 1.5 water, 1 cup wine, 2 cans kidney beans and fresh green beans instead of canned.  It will be better!

easy to do, hard to screw up.  tastes fantastic.  I added red pepper flakes to it, cuz i like spicy food.  It makes a lot of soup though.  Next time I'll dial down the amount.  Great with a panini!

I made this 8 serving size soup after seeing this recipe.  Switched the celery & zucchinis for potatoes.  Switched the chicken broth for vegetable broth.  Cooked everything else according to the recipe.  It turned out very nice!  I made extra pasta the first day, I used it the second day, the pasta didn't go soggy and tasted fine.  I thought the soup would be too thick, but that was not the case at all.  I loved it, ate it for 2-3 meals.  I am making it again tonight for my family.  

This time I'll go with a side of bread.  With all those veggies, this is a very nutritious meal.

This is truly the best recipe I have ever used for Minestrone soup.  It is better than what you get in some restaurants.  The only change I made was to use 4 cups of broth and no water and garbanzo beans instead of green beans.

Very good! Added more chicken stock. If you do not add extra liquids, it will be more like a stew then a soup. And the longer you cook it the better it tastes. Low and slow..

Wonderful minestrone recipe... Reduced the overall sodium levels a bit more by choosing low sodium tomato sauce and no sodium added to the canned beans.   Tremendous flavor.   Enough soup for two to last a few days.  Great winter recipe.

I added a couple other ingredients (corn, more beans, mushrooms, tomatoes) and cooked the pasta in the soup rather than in a separate pot, but other than that I followed the recipe and it was fantastic.  Would definitely make again.

BEST soup ever, Honestly!  ok, I used only about 1 cup tom sauce.  Added lots of fresh spinach - at least 3 cups (cut it up a bit), lots of celery,lots of carrots, zucchini is a must.   soooooo good!

This was an excellent soup.  I, too, added 4 cups broth rather than 2 and believe the wine is a must.  It really enriches the broth.  I prefer frozen Italian green beans and cooked the pasta in the soup rather than separately.  This soup is a "real keeper."  Thank you Jamie.

Very tasty!  I did not have red wine, so I skipped that step and instead of kidney beans I added chick peas, green beans and lima beans.  I also used a red onion because it's a stronger flavor.  Definitely going into my regular recipes rotation.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I only used green beans (frozen). I also added a half of pork sausage for flavor. I also did not use the spinach. It made a great broth, and the vegetables made it a perfect January soup.

Haven't tried this yet, but it sounds really good.  Just wondering where all the sodium is coming from.  Especially for a supposedly lower sodium recipe.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review.  I've made this minestrone several times and every time I get asked for the recipe.  The only change I make is to add some red chili flakes (I like spice) and sometimes I add ground turkey (browned first).  I think adding turkey means this is technically no longer minestrone, but if I want all my food groups in one bowl it works for me.

Loved this!!! I was wanting some minestrone similar to a restaurant, but this was even better. Also, I have a 5 and 2 year old that don't usually eat things mixed together, but they both ate tons of this without the slightest complaint.

Yummy. I ended up using black beans instead of kidney, and used only 2 zucchinis but added broccoli and cabbage. Also, used 2 cups of tomato sauce and 2 cups of crushed tomatoes. Instead of oregano, used an "Italian seasoning." Skipped the pasta-- very nice soup.

This is a hit. One warning, it makes a LOT of soup. With a family of 7 I double pretty much all recipes, but doubling this required me to use two 8 quart pots, both full almost to the brim. Still, it was so good we ate a pot and a half and finished the rest up the next day.

ok, this isn't truly fair to THIS recipe because I didn't have kidney beans or green beans, but it was still a really yummy base, so thus the 5 stars. 

to make up for the missing ingredients, i added a box of uncle bens long grain wild rice and a little more water to compensate. it may be because I am sick right now, but I am LOVING it, especially with real parm on top. mmm.

I've made this about twice a month since I found it and it's tured out great every single time.  The only realy changes that I've made is to substitute peas for the green beans, and to add garbanzo beans.  I keep meaning to make it with the spinach but I never seem to have it on hand when I make it (still great with out it).  This is a staple in our house!

Pretty darn good. Be sure to simmer the carrots and celery for 5 to 10 minutes longer the it says to. Otherwise they come out too crunchy.

This is honestly my new favorite soup! I love the amount of vegetables and the Italian kick in it. The amount of beans is just right and so is the amount of whole grain pasta with each serving. I made this recipe for my family and every single one of them thought that it was amazing!! "Best soup ever!"-my older sister

This was amazing.  Who knew a simple list of ingredients would taste so good!  Even better the kids really liked it, too! Doesn't need much salt due to the chkn broth and would have loved to have made it with the wine but we were out!

I'm only giving this a four start because it is lacking in flavor.  My 8 yr old said when he first tasted it was "it has no taste"  so next time, and I will make it again, I will add more spices to it.

This was excellent, and very hearty.  I did omit the green beans, as I had a green bean casserole.  And I omitted the pasta, and used Veg Broth.  It was a very healthy, filling and hearty soup.  It was a big hit!

I tried this with some butternut squash instead of zucchini and added about half a pound of diced sirloin to this to satisfy the meat eaters in the family but otherwise stuck to the recipe - it was a big hit. Even the picky non-vegetable eating child liked it, and there was more than enough for two nights dinner for the whole family. Great!

Wow! This soup was amazing! The changes I made were to use Black Beans instead of Kidney Beans, omitted the celery, used dried minced onions, and used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of the 2 cups of water. This was fabulous. To go with it, I made an amazing recipe called Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls (its here on the site). I will definitely make this again and again and again!

Great recipe!  I omitted the zucchini and kidney beans, added white beans, and used elbow pasta instead of seashell.  Best minestrone ever.

I don't typically eat soup but with the recent cold and rainy weather I found myself wanting something hot for dinner. This soup really hit the spot - it was easy to prepare for someone who has never made soup before. I'm quite picky, so I left out some ingredients and added more of the ones that I do like.

This is the best soup ever!  So flavorful, has loads of vegetables and I especially like the zucchini.  I added real crumbled bacon, fresh diced tomatoes, garbanzo and white beans.  I think ground turkey or sausage would also be good in it.  This is going to be a permanent recipe in my file.

Wow.  This is better than five stars.  All I did differently was use veggie broth rather than chicken broth (I'm a vegetarian).  I kept everything else the same.  I love all the veggies in this, and the herbs make everything really flavorful.  I made a huge pot of this and I'm really happy that I did.  Thanks, Jamie!

This is a great start for creating minestrone soup. In typical fashion, I made changes to suit our tastes. I used all vegetable broth instead of water and chicken broth (vegetarian). I used more beans, cannellini and red kidney, the entire can of both, less green beans, more spinach, no zucchini since we forgot to buy, added diced red potatoes, added about 2 extra cups of broth and 1 cup of tomato sauce. It STILL came out quite chunky and delicious. It makes a lot of soup but it only tastes better the next day. Thanks Jamie for a great recipe!

full rich flavor--so delicious! i made a few veggies changes based on preference and what i had on hand. the only main differences in the way i cooked it was to put uncooked orzo pasta in during the last 30 minutes of simmering and to add a chunk of parmesan (diced) to the soup at the same time.

Wow! I have never made Minestrone but I love ordering it a restraunt's like Olive Garden and I must say it can definitely compete with some of the best! My husband and I loved it! I didn't use red wine (didn't have any on hand = (  ... ) however it  was still fantastic. I will be making this a staple in our home it really doesn't take much time, especially if you have pre-chopped veggies!

Great soup. I don't change much about it, except I leave out the pasta and add chopped baby red potatoes. It makes a LOT, so be prepared to pack some away. I just made a double batch because it freezes well. Thanks Jamie for sharing such a great recipe!

Wowsers!  This is one of the most impressive-tasting recipes I've come across, but was very straightforward to make.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I only had 2 cups of tomato sauce, so I added a couple of fresh diced tomatoes and a few squirts of tomato paste (was flavorful enough this way, so will be curious to see whether it is over-flavored with 4 full cups of sauce).  I also omitted the green beans and doubled the amount of spinach.  Finally, during the cooking process, I just threw some uncooked ditalini into the soup when there was about 10 mins left in the cooking process vs. cooking separately.  I thoroughly enjoyed this soup... it was so flavorful and so healthy.  Did not even need the parmesan cheese.

First ever homemade soup.  Came out awesome.  Pretty much stuck to the heart of the recipe, only I did one 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and one can tomato sauce.

Make this all the time with fresh vegetables.   I use fresh green beans etc... I like to add the red wine.  Love this recipe and so does everyone that eats it with me.

The changes I made were: no green beans, dried herbs, and 1 cup of water (instead of 2). It was my first time making minestrone and I was very impressed. My picky kids even enjoyed it! Next time, I will probably cut the recipe in half because it makes more than my husband and I and the three kids can eat and we are not huge on leftovers.

This was very good.  I hadn't had minestrone soup in years and for some reason got the craving.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because mine ended up more like a pasta dish, maybe because I used large macaroni noodles instead of the standard size.  But it was still tastey.  I used beef broth since that is what I had, and omitted the wine since I don't keep wine in the house.  A very healthy dinner and my kids loved it, and didn't complain once about all the veggies (used spinach from our garden which was very exciting, our first vegetable to be harvested this year).

This is a fantastic soup! It makes so much and you can freeze the extra for later. I love this because it makes an easy pack-and-go lunch when it's sitting in the fridge.  Some changes I make: I add extra tomato sauce (whatever one Large can is) and then I also add a large can of chunks of tomatoes to add some more texture! Also, I do less water and more chicken broth for more flavor and I just add in a ton of veggies. I do add at least one yellow squash for the color, too. It doesn't seem that you can mess up this soup! I don't use pasta shells, cheese or the olive oil at the end because I think it's a hearty enough soup without the extra calories!

Such a yummy, surprisingly hearty vegetable soup! Very adaptable to whatever veggies you have on hand.  I didn't have green beans, but did use a can of white beans, and subbed some shredded green cabbage for the spinach.  With some fresh sourdough bread this was an awesome supper!

You don't even need another rave review, but you get it again. This was very good. I don't often get excited when I'm making something, but just putting this together was a treat to the eye. I took the liberty of using young green beans instead of canned, steaming them for five minutes before chopping to add when the canned would have gone in. Also, we already had some cooked spaghetti in the refrigerator, so I chopped the strands for the pasta portion, which may not have been as pretty, but was faithful to the flavor concept, surely. For any who are doing Weight Watcher's. This comes in at 4 points per generous serving.

I have been wanting to make a homemade minestrone soup for a long time and when I found this recipe, I decided to try it. I am glad I did! This soup turned out excellent and I will definitely be making it again. I did make a few changes: used all chicken stock instead of water, added a can of diced tomatoes in addition to the tomato sauce, and I used dried spices instead of fresh. I also added some Merlot to the soup. My husband and children loved this soup. We also made our own garlic bread with mozzarella cheese toasted in the oven to dip in the soup. This will be a regular soup recipe in our home.

This recipe is amazing!  I made a few small changes just because of personal preferences.  I increased the garlic to 5 cloves, increased the kidney beans to 2 cups, decreased the zucchinis to 2, and added 2 fresh tomatoes.  I suggest making minor alterations to enjoy it your way!

This is so delicious! My family can easily eat the whole pot! I have made it with and without the wine. I have made it without the celery and spinach too and it is still fantastic. I didn't use fresh basil or oregano (jarred instead) and you just about cannot mess this up.  I overly add carrots and zucchini too and I have never ever been disappointed with this recipe or any variation of it that I come up with.  Thank you so much for this Jamie!

Loved it, but had to make some modifications...added 1/4c. of tomato paste as it was a little bland. I think using all stock and no water would have improved it. I also used tortellini instead as this is my preference. Good soup :-)

I didn't spray with olive oil, and didn't add zucchini because I didn't have any.  I added more carrots and celery to make up for it, but kept everything else the same.  It's delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent soup!  As others have noted, this is a wonderful base for a soup that can be adjusted based upon personal tastes and ingredients one has on hand.  I made this for a vegetarian friend, therefore substituted vegetable stock for the chicken broth and the water.   And I like things very spicy, so I added a couple pinches of crushed red pepper flakes and tripled the garlic.  Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe and thought it was a very balanced, delicious soup!

This was such a great recipe.  I added shredded cabbage (cole slaw mix) as another reviewer suggested.  I definitely added extra spices...probably double.  It was so good leftover.  Yum Yum.  I used a gourmet refrigerated small pasta that was perfect.  The pasta you use will definitely make a difference.  5 stars!

Excellent soup that's very comes together very quickly. I've made a few minor substitutions: canned chopped tomatoes with juice instead of tomato sauce, garbanzo beans instead of kidney, frozen spinach instead of fresh, dried herbs instead of fresh. Came out healthy and delicious, got kudos even from non-soup eaters.

This was very delicious for such simple ingredients. The only changes I made were using dried spices instead of fresh and fresh green beans instead of canned. Great with nice warm bisuits on a cold day. Another great one to add to my soup rotation for the winter :)

This has become a regular hit in our household, and we always refer to it as "Jamie's Minestrone," even though we don't know this Jamie.  But Jamie's evident genius lives on nevertheless.  It's one of the only failproof 5-star savory recipes I know.

I made this tonight for a round robin with our friends. Most of them are hard core carnivores but this received unsolicited 5-star raving reviews!!! I did not use the wine. I think that I may consider adding garbanzo beans-personal preference. I otherwise followed the recipe as-it.

This soup is excellent!  I used fresh herbs, including the addition of parsley.  I added a leek to the mix, and added tomatoes per the suggestions of others.  I also omitted the pasta and served with cornbread.  It was absolutely delicious.

I made a few moderations (omitted green beans, added lots of sliced fresh cabbage and threw in the rind from a wedge of fresh parmesan), but overall this is a great base recipe that easily adapts to whatever one has in the house.

I made this and meatball sandwiches for Christmas Eve dinner.  I didn't really try the soup that night, but two days later I reheated it for lunch and really tasted it. It is really wonderful, tastes authentic as in any Italian restaurant. Delicious. (I let it simmer for around 2 hours)

This is a great versatile soup!!! I used veggie broth and like most other reviewers I used italian style diced tomatoes. I did use a small can of Contadina tomato sauce. I also added quartered red potatoes and used fresh spinach. I love soup in the winter and this is great vegetarian soup to make. Thanks!

This was wonderful.  I added A LOT more basil and oregano, omitted the pasta in favor of potatos to increase the broth to substance ratio, and doubled te broth while halving the tomato sauce to cut acidity.  It was really really great and I hate tomato based soups AND minestrone as a general category.

Fantastic soup. I used cannelli beans instead of green beans, it makes a very large batch but was gone in one day. Everyone took 2 bowls and then packed it for lunch the next day. Definatly a keeper.

Outstanding One change I did was instead of 4 cups of tomato sauce I used -  15 oz. of tomato sauce and 1 cup of commercial spaghetti sauce.

This was delicious!! I was so excited to try it that I burned my mouth...lol, but it was still good and even my DH, who hates vegetables, finished his bowl and agreed that it was yummy. I love the fact that you can pretty much make it with whatever vegetables your family prefers. A very flexible recipe.

It was okay. Next time I will do equal parts chicken broth & tomato sauce. It was pretty thick. Needs to cook/simmer for a lot longer than stated to get the flavors together and cook the carrots. I liked all the veggies, but it needed tomato pieces too.

This is an excellent recipe.  Doubled it for a big family group and all raved.  Instead of canned green beans I used frozen Italian flat beans and used all chicken broth (instead of leaving part of the larger containers unused).  don't think either substitution made any difference overall.  Thanks for such a good recipe.

This is a great soup recipe. It really does taste like the minestroni soup they used to serve at my favorite Italian restaraunt. I did add the red wine, and I feel it adds a depth that you cannot get with white wine. I also used all the tomato sauce plus one can of drained diced tomatoes. Next time I will add the entire bag of spinach. I know it was said before, but this makes a huge amount of soup. Do not cut down the recipe though, freeze half for later. Delicious. Thank you for posting.

I made this soup for a bridal shower and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes based on what I had/preference - I used white wine instead of red, replaced 1/4 of the tomato sauce with crushed Italian tomatoes and replaced 1/2 of the zucchini with summer squash. I will be making this again!

This was awesome.  I've been looking for a good minestrone recipe.  This one definetly rivals Olive Garden's.  I did add a pound of browned, drained, and rinsed Italian sausage and two bay leaves.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Jamie!

Great soup that's really easy to make, you can interchange lots of veggies, and it's still really good. We omitted the pasta and added extra zucchini. Great recipe.

Excellent.  Don't omit the wine, even though it says optional.  It is key to this hearty soup. It is also excellent if you add 1/2 pound of browned Italian Sausage to it.  Yummy, my family loved it!

My mom's Minestrone Soup has always been my favorite, but she doesn't have it written down exactly.  So when looking for a recipe to try, this sounded most like it.  And it's (almost) just as delicious!  Excellent!

I'm sorry but this had no flavor and I even added more garlic than normal and a lot more fresh herbs!  I was so excited to try this but it did not meet my expectations!  I redecued the recipe to 4 servings and it ended up making about 6 very healthy servings.  I will NOT be making this again!

Very simple and very good.  You can obviously add & subtract and many diff. vegies as desired. I omitted the kidney beans and spinach and added fresh green beans instead of canned.  This was just b/c of what I had on hand.  Fresh gr. beans are awesome in this.  I also had to add a lot more water and therefore more spices (tried to keep same ratio).  Even though added more water I didn't feel I needed more tomato sauce.  I also cooked my pasta directly in the stew about 1/2 way through.  Delicious and will definitely make again.

Very tasty minestrone- not as traditional as some I've had, but awesome. I couldn't find spinach at the store, so I added a bag of frozen peas instead, and added mushrooms. I also used 4 cups of chicken stock (skipped water), white instead of red wine, a small can of tomatoes sauce, and one 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes.

Our family are crazy about soups. We've taught our kids to eat soups, and we usually have a soup for lunch.  Well, this quickly became one of the favorites.  I've tried making it with some suggestions of other users, or as listed here - it is all good.

This was really good!  I especially loved all the fresh, chunky vegetables.  Great flavor.  Also, a really forgiving recipe because you can basically use whatever veggies you've got on hand.  I generally add stewed toms (cut up) and a bit of Worcestershire.  And serve the noodles separate by letting people add them to their individual bowls.  That way the noodles don't get too mushy in the leftovers!  This is a great recipe for easy-going rainy days. :)

Found this soup to be very good but not WOW.  I used this for my internet cafe lunch special and although the customers liked it, they didn't rave about it or ask for a second bowl like they do with some of my other recipes.

This is one of my favorite soups to make and freeze portions for later.  It is most adaptable, and no matter what you add, it is just wonderful. The only change I made to the basic soup is to use all broth instead of 1/2 water. I am leaving now to make a pot of this.  Today,I am adding some deer sausage my son gave me. It has jalapeno peppers added and I think it will be a great addition.

This was my first attempt at making a soup/stew.  This is such an easy, great, and healthy recipe!  I replaced half of the tomato sauce with a can of italian diced tomatoes, and I used dried oregano and basil, and I didn't add the red wine.  It tasted wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was truly delicious. Hubby doesn't like soup for dinner but went back for seconds so he could dip more bread in it! Had it with fresh Sourdough round and roasted garlic cloves to spread on it. Yumm! Best minestrone I've made!

FABULOUS! I've made this soup 3 times now doing variations each time. I like to add frexh mozzarella on top. I also add corn and skip the pasta to forego the extra calories. I love the spinach!! Thanks for sharing this!!

This is a delicious, hearty soup.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I did find the red wine changes the flavor slightly.  With or without the wine, a 5 star hit.

This Minestrone was really good. I used a whole can of chicken broth and left out the water. Also, used fresh green beans instead of canned. It makes a lot of soup!

Mmm, good soup!  I used dried Great Northern beans instead of canned kidney beans--1/2 cup, soaked for about six hours.  After I sauteed the veggies, I added the soaked beans and four cups of water, and let it bubble away until the beans softened--a little over an hour.  I did end up having to add about three more cups of water to keep it from getting too thick.  Once the beans were soft, I added one can diced tomatoes, one chopped fresh tomato, one 8oz. can of tomato sauce, the zucchini and spinach (left out the green beans), two chicken bouillon cubes, white wine, and dried herbs, and simmered for another 45 minutes.  Final result is wonderful.  I will come back to this recipe often.

that was good! I replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth. I also didn't want a stew so I used drained diced tomatoes as well. I added cabbage, hominy, garbanzo beans and left out the pasta. Zero animal fat to speak of in my version.

This soup is absolutely the best.  Thanks for a great recipe. I did use frozen green beans like one reviewer suggested. Also my husband grew some regular spinach, so I used that as well.  I just cut it up into smaller pieces.  I see now that I forgot the wine, but the recipe was still great.  I have enough leftover for the my college kids when they raid my freezer looking for foods to take back with them.

Delicious! I'm sure it would've tasted better with fresh herbs, but since I didn't have any, I used dried herbs instead. Also, to save a little bit of time, I used frozen spinach instead of fresh baby spinach. I simply added the frozen spinach to the pot along with the chicken broth, water & tomato sauce.

This is an excellent recipe.  Try adding double the wine and some parmesean rinds if you can get them at your Italian market.  Makes a whole new layer of flavor.  I usually add a can of garbanzo beans for variance in color as well.

WOW!  Why I waited soooo long to make this, I'll never know.  I used diced tomatoes and tomato sauce as others had recommended.  I also uses frozen green beans for a better crunch.  Served with just the Parmesan sprinkled on top and some cracker and cheese.  A great lunch that kept me going all afternoon.

Great stuff, easy to make, and yields a ton of very chunky soup.  I ran largely with the recipe as written but cut the sodium way down: Herb-ox instead of real broth, no salt added tomato sauce and beans, no cheese or salt - added a smidge of cayenne to add a little zing and cover for the lack of salt.  Followed the other comments and used ditalini instead of shells.  Turned out fantastic.  Will add more broth and some crushed tomatoes next time and maybe some cabbage.

Loved this recipe. I made half of the recipe and it still made a huge amount. But that is great-packed for lunch the next day for myself and my boyfriend.  I did not have oregano and basil so I used an Italian seasoning packet and we are cabbage fans so I used cabbage instead of spinach. Did not have fresh carrots so I used canned sliced carrots. Came out wonderfully! Will make again and again. Very filling and hearty soup.

I'm a big soup fan so I loved this recipe.  The first time I cooked everything exactly and didn't like how soft the vegetables were so I cut the sauteing time in half and loved it.  MY husband doesn't like soup and he will ask for this meal.  Thanks

As written, this was a little bland.  I added a couple dashes of hot sauce, two chicken bullion and one beef bullion and that gave it more flavor.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes as some reviews suggested.  I think if I make it again, I would use beef broth instead of chicken but overall a pretty good base soup.  I'm just the type of person who likes my food bursting with flavor.

My husband and I are doing Weight Watchers, and we were looking for something filling and hardy. This fit the bill! It was delicious, chunky, soothing, and plentiful! The recipe made a ton of soup--next time I'll cut it in half, but this time I'm using it for lunches at work all week. Thanks, Jamie--we really enjoyed it!

This is by far the best minestrone soup that I have eaten! I love that it full of vegetables and that also makes it very filling.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't add the red wine only because we didn't have any. I would highly recommend this recipe!

A+ delicious! I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of the sauce and I also used diced white potatoes instead of pasta. I cooked it with a ham bone leftover from our Christmas ham and it came out sooooo good! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

OMW - This recipe is EXCELLENT. Made ALMOST ;-) exactly to the "T". I used just 1 zucchinni because I had a couple of potatoes that I wanted to use too. Made the house smell awesome!!! This one is a keeper for sure!!!

I had mistakenly made a version of Minestrone that wasn't "jamie's" and it was a waste of ingredients.   I will not stray again.  
modifications include a box of chick broth (32oz) and only 1 can (15oz) of Tomato sauce, then added some cabbage.  Yum

This was absolutely wonderful. I would have preferred a bit more liquid, next time will add more broth. I have never liked Minestone, usually too greasy, until NOW. Everyone loved it.

I tried making this in the crock pot and it was overflowing.  Pretty good, but it needed some extra seasoning.  I'm not a salt user, but I added quite a bit to bring out the flavor.  It still seemed like it needed something more.

I really liked this and even got a comment from my husband that he liked it too, which is a small feat in itself. Recipe is so versatile with what you have on hand which makes it even better.
Will definitely be keeping this and making it in the future.

Yep, this is worth the ratings. I did clean out my fridge of veggies, and had no zucchini, but it was still really good. I added cooked Tortellini noodles. I also added some leftover "kubideh" -chopped up and put in the bottom of the bowl, with hot soup poured over top. It made a nice decent amount, so I was able to feed the four of us, have some for lunch the next day, and still freeze half for another week. 
THANKS!!

I've made this three times now and it never fails to be a hit!  The only things I changed about the recipe this last time I made it was that I used all chicken stock (no water), added a can of diced tomatoes, and I decided to double the garlic.  This soup comes out more like a heavy stew and is so satisfying and incredibly delicious.  I would recommend this recipe 100% to anyone who is looking for a good minestrone recipe.  You won't be disappointed!  Absolutely fabulous!

This really is the best homemade minestrone I've ever had! I actually like it better than some restaurants' minestrone. It's so easy to make, and it makes a ton! I didn't change anything.

I have made this the last 3 years the day before Thanksgiving.  When you have different family members coming in at all different times and you know they will be hungry, this is a great one to try.  It is so good; the flavor is just right and it has a little nip to it.  The best thing about this recipe is that it is better the next day and the day after that.  I didn't go back to work until the MOnday after Thanksgiving and it was still great then.  Thanks for sharing this..it has become a part of my recipe collection.

So yummy and flavourful! I made a few changes as suggested in other reviews. I used 4 c. chicken stock instead of 2c. stock and 2c. water. I eliminated the kidney beans as we're not fans. But a very delicous and rich tasting soup. The recipe as writen does make a very large batch; I filled my crockpot and filled about the same amount to keep in the freezer for a quick meal. Great recipe!

I adore this recipe, I love the big chunks of vegetables and the flavour is fantastic!
It freezes well and works great to bring to a potluck - I get nothing but compliments on this recipe! Even my boyfriend eats it and he doesn't like soup!

Best minestrone I have ever made.  I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I am getting ready to make it a second time- delicious!

This is a great, hearty soup.  I followed the recipe, but omitted the optional wine and substituted squash for one of the zucchinis.  I also used Italian greenbeans to add more Italian flair.  It turned out really well, and makes a great Italian veggie soup without the pasta.  Thanks!

Fantastic - even my kids ate it.  The only change I made was add diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce then I whirled 1/3 of it in the blender before serving to make more broth.  I also added alphabet pasta to make it more interesting for the kids.

Agreeing with all the other posts, this is excellent and very adaptable to what ever is on hand in your area. I do agree with a little more garlic and just broth for the base. THANK YOU Jamie for sharing this with us!!

This was not a hit at our house. I am unsure if it was the recipe or if it was because nobody seemed to like this sort of soup.

It's good.  My family really likes it and I enjoy the healthy aspects of this meal.  I also like how versatile it is.  Really if you don't have zucchini use something else or nothing else at all.

Pretty darn good! So easy to make and it tastes just like the stuff you would get in a can without all the nasty extras. I sauteed the onion, garlic, carrots and celery then put everything into the slow cooker on low for the day. I used homemade chicken stock and didn't add the spinach.  I also competely forgot to add the kidney beans which I only realised when we were eating!  Served with Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site.

Delicious!! I substituted potatoes for the zucchini. It needed to cook a bit longer than the recipe states, although I probably didn't cut up the veggies small enough. Used the tiny salad macaroni noodles, which worked perfectly.

This is a fantastic recipe! I make this all the time especially in the winter and the great thing is that you really can throw in any vegetables that are in season and it tastes great!  Sometimes I leave the pasta out to cut out the carbs.  This soup also freezes really well... since it makes so much I freeze it in individual servings and re-heat for lunch!  Also if fresh herbs arent available or I dont have them I use the basil, oregano tomato sauce which also tastes great!

This is the Best Minestrone soup I've ever had and a favorite soup in my family.  I only made some minor adjustments-I used 1 cup chopped celery instead of 2, 6 cups of chicken broth and 2 large (15 oz each) cans of tomato sauce, skipped the wine and made more pasta.  If you don't use more liquid than the original recipe calls for I think it would be too thick.

I have also been looking for a good minestrone soup that does not come out of a can. The can stuff really is not good for us just check out all the preservatives and additives next time you are in the supermarket. This is the minestrone for my family! The only changes I made were taking out the beans and zucchini. I replaced with sweet yellow capsicum and some fresh corn. This soup is super tasty and very I will continue to make this for a very long time. Thanks Jamie! Smiles from Australia(:

The basics of this recipe is definitely a keeper! I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I substituted spag. sauce, which still turned out great...of course your veggies can vary in it (according to what you like). I really like the addition of the red wine; it gave a nice, distinct flavor. Very good!

Wonderful!!  My husband was a big fan and he is very hard to please when it comes to soup. I sometimes add potato and almost never include the spinach but otherwise I pretty much stick to the recipe - although I tend to do a lot of estimating rather than measuring.

THIS WAS GOOD. DONT KNOW IF I WILL EVER MAKE AGAIN JUST BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS AND TIME IT TAKES TO CHOP EVERYTHING UP BUT IT WAS GOOD FOR A CHANGE! I WOULD SUGGEST NOT AS MUCH SPINACH BECAUSE OURS HAD WAY TO MUCH AND MAYBE MORE NOODLES? THANK YOU =]

This was good because of all the vegetables. I felt that it had too much of a tomato sauce flavor, next time I will use crushed tomato. I could not finish a small bowl, it felt like I was eating spoonfuls of tomato sauce. I just added more chicken broth to thin the soup out hopefully that will help.
I used fresh steamed green beans, orzo intead of shells, and dried herbs. Everything else to a "T."

This was great, we all loved it.  We even ate the leftovers which is saying a lot because we are not the leftover types.  I added some ground beef and served french bread.  Great dinner.  Next time I'll maybe add tiny meatballs.  This was great thanks!!!

I made this soup for the first time durring the summer, and even in the hot hot heat, this soup was so amazing and refreshing.  I am making again now that its spring.  And will be sharing with all my neighbors because they all love it too!  I usually use navy or white beans in addition to kidny beans.  And the red wine is  MUST!

This is very good soup and is even better the next day. I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because that's what I had on hand and cooked the pasta in the soup.

This was a great soup full of flavor and vegetables. I didn't have spinach, so I used cabbage instead. It still tasted like a great minestrone.

Good!  I really enjoyed this and so did my company.  I didn't change much, except for, I only added 2 zucchini's, used fresh green beans, dried oregano and added an extra 1/2 cup of the pasta.  I liked how healthy and fresh tasting it was.

Delicious. I cut the recipe in half and still had quite a bit of soup. My fiance went back for seconds. There was a lot of prep with all the veggie chopping, but the result was yummy.

This was a great minestrone. We left out Celery. But we added Okra, Red Potatoes and Chickpeas (garbanzo beans). It was a great hearty soup that we enjoyed all weekend long.

We liked this well enough.  I did leave out the canned green beans since I HATE canned veggies, maybe next time I will try it with fresh.  I needed to add about 2 extra cups of broth to have it be soup like instead of stew like.  I also added a little extra of all the spices to make up for the extra broth.  Overall .....  real good soup!  Thanks!!

Brava!

I made this "mostly" following the recipe but adding white kidney beans instead of green beans and simply dumping in the pasta before simmering.  Excellent recipe ... great taste!  Thanks, Jamie.

I add more beans (I like to put in a can of garbanzos as well as the kidneys) ;and I use dried oregano but fresh basil. I use one or two potatoes and one or two zucchinis. A GREAT RECIPE!

I must agree with everyone else: this is wonderful! With every bowl, I like it more! I added an additional can of chicken broth and a pound of ground turkey; I also used 3 tbsp of Italian seasoning since I did not have basil. It turned out great..although I look fwd to making it acc to the recipe so I can see if that makes any difference.

Good basic recipe. I used northern beans (white beans) instead, just because I prefer them. Otherwise, it was pretty good as is. I did have to add extra water/broth as it got more like a stew or sauce than soup after time.

****Delicious***- this soup is a definite do again.  I made very few changes: used a crock pot on low for 6 hours and added half the amount of water-no wine.

This was really good. I think I'd add less oregano and less celery and more beans. And  maybe a couple cans of corn. 

I used orzo instead of shells and it worked just fine.

I LOVED this soup.  My whole family liked it as well--which is saying something since I have 3 picky kids.  The only thing I changed was I browned some ground turkey with the onions to give it more protein.  It turned out perfectly!

Great recipe. Added an extra cup of chicken stock as it has so many veggies that it needed a little bit more soup. Also added potatoes - yummy

So, so good! I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have shell pasta, so I used the little cork screw looking ones. It made a wee bit more than 8 servings, IMO. So I froze the rest for dinner enother night. This recipe is definatly a keeper.

HOLY TOLEDO!!!  Okay - I am definitely a soup person and I've tried minestrone several times and finally found a good one!  I LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVED THIS SOUP!  I can't wait to go home and eat leftovers!  I changed it up a tad - no green beans, extra garlic, white wine, a chopped up potatoe and crushed tomatoes.  Oh, and a little more broth... But mann..........  this soup was on FIRE!  I loved loved loved LOVED IT!

Delicious! I did make subsitutions based on what I had at home, but I'm sure it would be great as is: white instead of red wine, cannellini beans instead of kidney, all broth instead of broth and water, added can of stewed tomatoes, added italian seasonings. It was a huge hit!

Very good.  I made a batch and had leftovers.  One time I added some ground beef for a yummy vegetable beef soup.  Another time, I added some shrimp...yummy too.  The only thing I would change is cut down on the amount of tomato sauce, perhaps to one can and some fresh tomatoes or a can of canned tomatoes.  My son and husband loved this recipe and I will make it again and again!

This recipe is the best.  I love using all of the fresh veggies.  I did however ommit the spinach from the recipe.  

**I blended a few laddles of the soup in a blender and then added the pasta for my daughter.  My daughter loved it.  She could not even tell she was eating veggies.  Thanks Jamie for posting this awesome recipe:)

I first made this soup a few years ago, I just forgot to rate it!  This Minestrone is awesome!  The only change I made was adding more broth because it was a little thick for our taste.  It seems like a perfect recipe for a cold day, so I am making this again this week!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This soup had great flavor with only 4 spices! I used cheese filled tortellini instead of shell pasta and it came out almost like a stew. I would add a can of diced or crushed tomatoes next time, otherwise a perfect soup for the winter time!

This soup is so healthy and delicious. I gave it 4 stars because I made many modifications, although I'm sure it would have been good anyway. I used 1 (29 oz) can of concentrated crushed tomatoes, 1 (28 oz) can of regular crushed tomatoes. I also added a lot more garlic than called for. I used one full can each of chicken broth & vegetable broth instead of the water and dried oregano because I didn't find fresh at the store. I used dry kidney beans (pre-soaked) and fresh green beans instead of canned. I used 2 yellow squash and 2 zucchinis, whole wheat rotini (store didn't have seashell pasta).

I used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth since we are vegetarians.  It turned out great.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and increased the stock amount and only used 2 zuchinis.  Next time I leave the zuchinis out all together since my husband doesn't like them.  Left overs can be frozen and make for great lunch

I've been making this soup for years and am just getting around to rating it... I call this soup "garbage soup" mostly because I add just about any veggies I have in the fridge.  I also sometimes start off the soup by frying up some crumbled italian sausage and then sauting my veggies in the fat.  I have added canned corn, black beans, white beans...if I have it, it generally goes in. I always use italian seasoning though instead of the recommended seasonings.

Very good minestrone, the wine is a must adds great depth to the soup, also dont forget the parmesan cheese adds lots of flavor, I added a can of tomato juice, as other reviewers suggested that the soup didnt have enough liquid - was perfect.

I didnt mind this soup, personally. It IS however more of a stew than a soup. My boyfriend couldnt eat it... when asked why, he answered 
".. it just tastes like vegetables with tomato sauce poured over it. Not a very nice taste. Theres no broth.. wheres the broth??"
I guess it needs more broth, and I think the wine is essential. 
I'll make this again, I'll just tweak the hell out of the recipe. lol.
Thanks for a healthy alternative to canned soups!

DELICIOUS!!  I've made this both with the red wine and without and it's definitely better with the red wine, adds an amazing deep flavor.  Totally love this soup!!!  And it can be varied in so many ways.  (I added okra instead of green beans)

A tasty soup full of vegies and goodness! I used two 32 oz. cartons of msg-free Wolfgang Puck chicken broth instead of the 2 cups water and 2 cups chicken broth to make it more of a soup than a stew (as others said).

This Stew (not soup) tasted very good, but there was way to much stuff in this recipe. It was so thick with hardly any liquid and I added extra water and tomato sauce. Next time, I think I will add about half of the veggies and a little more noodles.

I added another 1/2 cup of pasta just expand it a bit, but otherwise it is the best Minestrone recipe out there.  You will not be disappointed.

pretty good. nice flavour. i added procini mushrooms, and it added a nice texture. I am not really a giant fan of zucchini and I found there was way too much;I would add less next time. Maybe add chickpeas as well. Overall I was satisfied with this soup, my family really enjoyed it. Nice and healthy.

This was so great.  Let simmer for about 1.5 hours and came out perfect.  Made so much for the two of us that I have tons frozen and lots of leftovers.  Delicious and Inexpensive to make! Edited: I have made this many, many times since my initial review.  It is fail proof, and everyone loves it.  The recipe as-is is VERY thick and I always felt like I wanted more liquid.  These are my changes: 2 zuchinni and 2 squash, 8 cups chicken broth and omit the water, 1 can crushed tomatoes, and 3 cans tomato sauce.  Seems like a lot, but it made it the perfect consistency.   I have made it with both fresh and dried spices, and it's well worth the effort to use fresh.  Sometimes I add pasta, and sometimes I don't, but either way, it's great.  It is ALWAYS best the day after (which makes it perfect for pot lucks) it is cooked.  Have fun--you really can't go wrong with this recipe!

Loved it.  I made it exactly as directed and loved it.  I will add more spinach next time because I love spinach.  My husband is not a big fan of minestrone because it doesn't keep him full but he loved it too.

This was excellent served with a sprinkle of pecorina romano on top!  I used beef broth instead of chicken broth because it had less fat.  Used fire roasted diced tomatoes and a little more garlic.  Other than that, followed the recipe...Delish!!

I love this recipe. I've made it many times for myself, freezing some since it makes so much, or for get togethers. Its always eaten quite heartily. I'm fairly free with the vegetables and will add more of something I have more of on hand or thats in season.

I really like this soup.  I used veggie broth instead of water, dried herbs, and diced tomatoes in place of half of the tomoto sauce.  I also left out the green beans and spinich.  I like broth so I doubled the chicken broth and seasoned as necessary.  A great way to eat your veggies!

Fabulous soup!  Great flavor, perhaps the carrots need to be cooked a little longer before adding to soup to make sure they're tender.

Excellent!  This makes a ton.  I halved the recipe, since it was only for my husband and I, and it still lasted a couple days.  I followed other reviews and added more chicken broth to make it soupier, and used dried herbs because that's what I had on hand.  I also sub. garbonzo beans for kidney (just preference) EXCELLENT!!

This soup really is TO DIE FOR!  The only thing I did differently, was I just added the pasta right to the soup, rather than cooking it on its own.  This makes a LOT, but it's even better the 2nd and 3rd time around!  This recipe is a winner for sure!

This recipe has good ingredients. I throw in fresh green beans, diced tomatoes, and use beef broth instead of chicken. Also, I added shredded Napa cabbage in place of the spinach. And I add pesto at the end of cooking. Minestrone is great because you can put in whatever you like.

I thought the soup was fabulous.  I remember when I was a kid my dad would make Minestrone soup and of course I wouldn't eat it - what kid likes vegetables!  But now that I'm grown up I don't mind them so I tried the recipe.  I made a handful of changes but I though it was great.

I added some small quartered yukon gold potatoes instead of pasta and a can of S&W pinquito beans with their flavorful sauce instead of kidney beans.  I also added frozen italian green beans instead of canned.  Great soup!
*using potatoes instead of pasta makes this gluten free.

everyone loved it except my husband who hates vegetables. You can leave out the beans like we did or you can use cannelini beans instead.

This is very good! I added more garlic, garbanzo beans, and 1.5 cups more chicken broth. I'm glad I did because it is very chunky. If you prefer more broth, I would recommend cutting back on the veggies a bit. All in all, a great dish. A great healthy meal. I'm actually eating the leftovers right now! Thanks Jamie!

I give this recipes five stars! My family loved this soup and is just perfect on a rainy day. I made it with my mom's homemade sauce, which I think made it even better, and then left out the greenbeans. The results were spectacular!

Very chunky and very tasty. My wife begged me to make some minestrone, which I've never been a fan of before. This recipe definitely won me over!

What an awesome recipe.  Some complain that there is too many veggies, but I added more than the recipe calls for and was completely delighted.  What a wonderful alternative to a veggie soup!!! The flavor was terrific as well.

Excellent. Followed the recipe,only substitute I made was shredded cabbage (on hand) for spinach (which I didn't have). Tasted as good as the minestrone soup at our favorite Italian restaurtant. Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good soup FULL of veggies. I only had 3 stalks of celery, 3 carrots and no green beans but it was still so full of vegetables. I used a full quart of vegetable stalk instead of 2 cups stalk 2 cups water. Added stewed tomatoes because I prefer them. And of course more garlic and a little more basil, SO GOOD.

This soup is delicious!! I have made it twice in the last three weeks.  My boyfriend gobbles it up.  I like it because it is filling, healthy and easy on the budget.  Tastes great too.   Pair it with homemade muffins and you have a "comfy"  , healthy lunch/dinner.

really really really good. just don't use a food processor to chop anything. i chopped celery and onion in the food processor and came out too small. it just blended away in the sauce. the soup is very hearty and after rewarming a few times, there was very little broth left. not complaining though. really good with bread.

Really good.  I'd say 4-1/2*, darn near 5. Used more chicken broth/less water; frozen(thawed)chopped spinach (already on hand), added 1 can italian peeled/diced tomatoes, and extra oregano and basil.  Friends really enjoyed, but I thought it might be missing something.

I halved the recipe but still used 2c of chicken stock and 1 cup of water since I cooked the pasta in the soup before I served it.  I used canellini beans instead of kidney and didn't have any zucchini on hand.  I'd recommend using the wine as well.

This was soooo good.  Everyone raved about it.  I added some browned ground turkey for the men in the family.  Delicious.

Really, REALLY good!!!!  I made it pretty close to the original recipe, just substituted a large can of crushed tomatoes for part of the tomato sauce called for, and increased the chicken broth to 4 cups. I let it simmer for about 2 hours.  Very good flavor, rich and hearty.  I will definately be making this one again!

This was a great recipe. I have the recipe for this soup from a well known italian restaurant in my city, and this was better, I think.  The fresh herbs and spinach made a huge difference.  I made it yesterday, had it for dinner, and then froze the leftovers in freezer bags to use later.  I ended up giving most of it away to friends and had it with a couple friends for lunch today, and they raved about it.  Before freezing, I added the noodles and extra water, about 1/2c per gallon freezer bag, and I was afraid this would affect the taste, but it didn't.  I gave it 4 stars because overall, it could use a little stronger flavor, and it could use a little extra broth(very hearty and thick).  However, it really was good, easy to modify(flavor), and easy to make with my 3 year old daughter.  Good job!

This soup is an easy and tasty way to get your daily dose of veggies.  I used tri-colored cheese tortellini instead of seashell pasta.  Very tasty!  Thanks!

A huge success!  I didn't have any tomato sauce or v8 juice, so I ended up using a can of diced tomatoes and 4 ripe vine-ripe fresh tomatoes.  I added worcestershire sauce to add depth as it was mentioned in another post and it really helped.  I used 2 zucchinis and 1 yellow onion.  I also added some peas and potatoes instead of pasta.  I agree with others that this is a very good base recipe that you can play with.  The recipe did make a lot of soup.  It tastes much better the next day.

Very good! I did make a few changes. Did not add zucchini or canned green beans. I did use frozen green beans and a can of chopped tomatoes. Will make again.

Delicious and healthy.  I made it for my house of ten girls and they loved it!  Did take about 1 1/2 to cook the vegetables enough though.

This minestrone is truly amazing!  Every spoonful tasted like something from a gourmet restaraunt.  The BEST minestrone I've ever eaten, not to mention the best I ever made.  Worthy of 5 *****'s (I'd give more if I could).  Thank You Jamie for submitting such a great recipe!

This is EASY, HEALTHY, AND TASTY!!
My children asked for seconds, although my hubby complained there was no meat. I omitted the pasta because the soup was already getting too thick, even after I added more chicken broth and water (I like a soup I can sip). This is a GREAT RECIPE, I will surely make this again!

Everyone I have served this to has loved it. I did increase the red wine to 1 cup and I don't measure the vegetables. I use what I have. It freezes really well so I make it up and keep it on hand in the freezer. I also don't use the pasta. I think it is unnecessary.

Great Soup.  I added some peas to the recipe but besides that changed nothing.  There was a lot of soup so I put some in the freezer and still was great when defrosted and reheated/  Thanks

Great soup!  Just what I was in the mood for!  I followed the recipe almost exactly using the wine and added more pasta shells than called for.  It made it pretty thick but I didn't care.  It was delicious, healthy, and made plenty for lots of leftovers.  Thanks for a keeper for my recipe book!

This was wonderful! I made it last night and having some of the leftovers for lunch today. I did omit the celery, wine, spinach and zucchini...because hubby does not like but it was fantastic! I did add a little sugar to it as we do like sweeter sauces/soups and it was perfect. This one will definitely stay in my cookbook!

This is excellent.   Lots of chopping...fun to make.  Tasted great, and very healthy.

I would personally increase the volume of liquid next time to make it "brothier."

This is fabulous soup!  There were only minimal changes made.  I added a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of 4 cups, and cut back on the water a little, also added orzo pasta to the soup.

Wonderful!  I make this about every 2 weeks and it's a great way to get your veggies in during the week!  Warm, hearty and delicious.  I cut back on the liquid a bit to make it a bit more like a stew than a soup.  YUM!

It's become a staple in my house. We always seem to serve it on special occasions, so my kids call it "Celebration Soup".
Like everyone else, I've modified what I add - use fresh instead of canned green beans, not as many carrots, but I add asparagus, and veggie stock instead of chicken broth.
The fresh basil and oregano are key to the recipe - don't use dried.

I must admit to being a bit nervous after adding the veg concoction to the pot.  It was just so chunky and even after letting it simmer for an hour, the veggies were still a bit crunchy.  In the end, this turned out to be one of the best tasting soups I've ever tried from this site - but not without a few alterations.  I did end up allowing the soup to simmer for an additional hour and 20 mins longer than the recipe indicated.  I also added another can of chx broth ( plus a tad more oregano and basil) and 1tsp of garlic powder.   Deeelissh!

This soup is fabulous.  I had to use 32 oz. of V8 instead of the tomato sauce as I did not have that in my pantry, and I also added a shot of Worcestershire sauce which added a little depth.  It makes a LOT, but my husband ate at least half the pot in one sitting.

What a great tasting, simple soup!!!  I scaled it down, and instead of using tomato sauce, I used V8 as I do in mostly all of my soups.  I love all the veggies and the beans, and I just can't say enough for how good this all tastes together!  Even my teenage daughter loved it, and that says a lot.  I will make this again and again and again and again.......  :-)

Great recipe and so easy! The most time consuming part is cutting the vegetables, but it's worth it. I used dried oregano and basil and added a bit too much, but it still tastes great!

I ommited the kidney beans and wine. I didn't have fresh basil/oregano- I just used the jar stuff. Ton of pepper. It was a reallly good home cooked soup. One of those comfort foods. I did let it simmer for quite a long time and as a result there wasn't much broth left, so I added a little tomatoe paste and water and it was still a five star recipe.

I love Olive Garden's minestrone, but I could never quite get homemade minestrone to taste like that, but this is really close. It is so good and just what I was looking for! Thanks!

In a word: AWESOME! This soup is the absolute best minestrone I have ever tasted (let alone made!) I have made it about a dozen times for various charity events and dinner parties and people ALWAYS ask for the recipe! What a great find!

This recipe was great, I did change it a bit by adding twice as much garlic and i also added a serrano pepper to the soup to add spice. It was delicious, my guests loved it.

Amazing! My husband begs for me to make this soup, even in the middle of summer!  I use diced canned tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, add more wine (~1 cup), and have been known to throw in any random vegetable I find in the house.

Good minestrone. You could add just about any vegetable to this. I used fresh green beans (instead of canned), tomato paste (instead of tomato sauce), vegetable broth (instead of chicken broth), and 1/2 cup spagetti sauce. Turned out delcious. Make sure you add baby spinach, it cooks down and tastes yummy. Oh, you can't hardly taste the garlic, so if you love garlic, at least double the amount.

I have had great minestrone, which this is not.  There wasn't any one thing I could pick out and tinker with, it just lacked the rich flavor of a good minestrone.  I won't be making this again.

I have tried countless recipes for minestrone.  Some have turned out mediocre and some just plain bad.  This turned out wonderful!  My husband is an Iowa farmboy, so if it doesn't have meat, he doesn't eat it, but he had three bowls of this!  Absolutely wonderful.  I sliced all the veggies on my V-blade slicer and it made it super easy...no hand chopping for me.  I am so happy that I have finally found a minestrone recipe that I can use again and again.

This is the best tasting, healthy, heartiest soup there is.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I love it, I love it.  I make it 3-4 times a year but it's especially good when it's cold outside.  Thanks Jamie!

This is the best soup! I added some finley chopped mushrooms and added about 1 cup of V8 to it and one can less of tomato sauce. Also add some shell pasta that has been cooked seperatly as you are serving it. It can be also made exactly as the recipe is stated and still be great! Thanks!

Superb.  Everybody loved it.  I thought it was too thick and thought about adding more water or broth, but my wife said, "That's that way it's supposed to be." And even if I do say so myself, it was most excellent.

I enjoyed this recipe and my husband enjoyed it even more.  I used white kidney beans and whole wheat bow ties.  Well worth the time to make.

Excellent!! This soup is delicious... It's perfect for fall. I was able to use up much of the fresh vegetables still growing in my garden. Thank you so much for the recipe, Jamie!

I'll be making this one a lot - nice basic soup that is easily adaptable to what you have on hand, freezes well...  What more do you want?  I added more beans because we like them and changed the veggies somewhat, but nothing drastic.  In my opinion, the wine is a must - I add it to most of my tomato based soups and sauces, and it just enhances and brings out the flavors so much.

A rich, thick vegetable soup great for winter meals. I added more wine and use low-sodium chicken broth. And I use low-sodium V8 for half of the required tomato sauce. Make sure you use a LARGE stock pot.

I found this receipe much better than any I have tried thus far. Lots of veggies, great flavor, perfect for a chilly Fall day.  I added just a bit of shredded leftover roast beef...perfect!  
Thanks, Jamie!

I made this soup for my parents when they visited. They loved it, so I copied the recipe for them, and they in turned shared it with two friends. Next I'm going to send it to my daughter. It's such a great soup! I added some diced red bell pepper because I didn't have enough carrots around, and I also substituted a half box of frozen chopped spinach for the fresh spinach.  I will be making this again I'm sure.

I tried this recipe for the first time this past week, and it was DELICIOUS! My husband flipped, and I also sent some to my daughter and her family and they, too, loved it. I added a can of diced tomatoes and made some turkey meat balls. I think it made it that much better! I also used frozen spinach and fresh green beans. Definitely worth trying and making again and again!

I used a combination of tomatoes and tomato sauce (one large can tomatoes, 1-2 small cans tomato sauce), and used a combination of zucchini and yellow squash instead of just zucchini to give it more color.  This is now one our favorite soups!!  Perfect on a cold winter day!

This recipe is awesome ! I added fresh broccoli and cauliflower and I doubled the ingredients ,so I had to added another 2 cups of chicken broth, water, and tomato sauce. It was scrumptous ! The only thing I will do differently next time is to add burger or sausage because my husband is a meat fanatic ...hahaha. This is definitly a keeper !
