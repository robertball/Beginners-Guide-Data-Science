Exceptional! Great holiday drink. Didn't make any changes.
It says it makes 1 serving, but it perfectly filled my 2 martini glasses. I used a 1 cup measuring glass. Start with vodka and coffee liqueur (1/4 cup each) then add eggnog to 1 cup. Eggnog is thick and covers the numbers if you put in first.

I sub'd  eggnog in my white Russian for the cream and had to check here to see if anyone else knew the wonders of this  magic holiday creation.  I am not a martini fan, and like my White Russians a bit dilute so keep the ice and make it your own Egg Russian/ Nogtini.  This  is a yummy wonderful holiday drink.

It was pretty good although I made some changes that made it even better in my opinion. I left everything the same EXCEPT I used 1 shot of whipped flavored vodka instead of 2 shots regular vodka. I also added a splash of milk. Perfect!

I did not care for this at all.  Maybe it's me?  It just had a strange taste to it.  Maybe it was the eggnog I bought.  I'll try it again next holiday season.

Sooo good!!! I used a generic brand of "Quik" chocolate syrup and it was too liquid, it pooled at the bottom of the glass instead of making nice swirls. But the taste was still awesome!

Yum! I did not have Kahluha so I used creme de Cocoa. This is the perfect amount to fill your martini glass right to the top (for one big drink). It's nice and strong but tasty. Definitely drizzle the chocolate syrup in the glass, it looks good and I liked it better than without. Good starter signature drink for a holiday get together.

Got hooked on these last winter, they were almost a daily drink. Im happy eggnog is back on the shelf! It might sound weird to some but you really have to try it, it's delicious.

It's really strong, even for 2 people to share. I added more eggnog to the mix. But over all this is an amazing drink! Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have chocolate syrup but substituted ghirardelli cocoa powder and shook the heck out of it before straining into a glass.   I was after the chocolate taste after all, not the presentation ;).  Very good and rich!

I used to call a similar drink "White Christmas" but this is even better!
