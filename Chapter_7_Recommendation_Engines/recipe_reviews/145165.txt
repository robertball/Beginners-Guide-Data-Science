I've found that with "iced" drinks, adding ice cubes waters it down too much. So what I've been doing is pouring the drink - lemonade, coffee, fruit juice, etc - into ice cube trays, then blending it to whatever consistency you prefer. This way, the ice doesn't water down the slush too much...With THIS recipe, I made the lemonade as directed, then froze it in ice cube trays. Very refreshing!

This is an icy cold, mildly flavored lemonade. At first I thought it was too watery, and neither sweet nor tart enough. But it grew on me almost instantly. It’s *because* of its mild flavor that it’s particularly refreshing and thirst-quenching, especially important and nice on these hot days when our body needs fluids the most. Rather than peeling the lemon a grapefruit spoon (or serrated knife) made quick work of releasing the juice and pulp (and a few pesky seeds). I’m always guilty of not drinking enough water and since I always have a big bowl of lemons on the counter this could quickly make me drink more than I do.

This was very refreshing! My lemon may not have been 'large' enough, so next time I will use 2. Also, I added more ice cubes (like 10 total), to get a more slushy drink. This definately needs to be served immediately, as the 'slushy' tends to seperate from the liquid. All in all, a nice, tasty, simple drink for a humid summer day. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very yummy! Its mostly just cold lemonade and it's very pulpy though so you have to strain it, but all around good.

Delicious, but not the consistency of a slushie, more liquidy. I would definitely make this again, though.
