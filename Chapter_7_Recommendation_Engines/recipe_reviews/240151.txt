This is an amazing cheesecake... we're not big cheesecake fans, but this one is awesome.  It's not a super heavy, thick cheesecake... wonderful texture.  Lots of compliments on it at Thanksgiving.  The directions weren't detailed enough, so I had to learn a little about cheesecake-making in order to fill in the gaps.  So, here's what I did learn:  when wrapping the spring-form pan with aluminum foil, make sure you have the extra wide foil.  Otherwise, it won't wrap high enough on the spring-form pan to keep the water from seeping in. The directions don't say how long to whip the ingredients with the paddle attachment, so I looked it up on another recipe and here's what I did (it turned out amazing, so I'm sharing this for those who need more details):  Add cream cheese and brown/white sugar - mix on low for 1 minute or until smooth. Then, raise speed to high and mix for about 3 more minutes, or until light and fluffy.  Follow the other directions as stated.  Overcooking the cheesecake can ruin it, so check with a thermometer that the temp is between 155 and 160 degrees F.  To keep from having cracks in the cake, I followed a few tips from the "How to make pumpkin cheesecake" recipe by Chef John.  If you get cracks, however, there is a very easy way to repair them - just check out youtube on that subject.  Super easy to make it look professional.  I didn't change the recipe at all, though... just thought the directions could use a few extra details to have a successful cake.

Never again will I set a foiled wrapped cheesecake in water!  I will follow the normal way and place a cheesecake OVER a pan of water to bake. I will make the cheesecake again and bake it my way and if it turns out better I will change my review and add a suggestion.  Glad this wasn't the only dessert for Thanksgiving dinner!  :o)

Very easy to prepare and so delicious! The springform pan I used was actually a 9 1/4" and it was filled to the brim, I was worried that it might overflow but it didn't. In my oven the cake needed to bake for 1 hour 10 minutes. Other than that, everything else was as stated in recipe. So good and I highly recommend chilling it overnight. :)

This is a delicious recipe.  Equally appreciated by both the pumpkin pie lovers and the pumpkin pie haters!  The perfect blend of pumpkin and cheesecake.  I did need to extend the cooking time by 10 minutes or so and let it cool in the oven as the recipe suggests.  No cracks at all, it turned out beautifully.

Oh. My. God. I made this cake for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. It's literally like mixing a cheesecake with pumpkin pie. It's super simple to make and it makes your brains fall out when it hits your tongue. The only change I would make is to cut back a little on the sugar in the graham-cracker crust. It was a little over-sweet.

I followed the recipe except I had to place the water  bath directly below the cheesecake, and it is beautiful.  Took an extra 40 mins to cook, I live at 5300 ft. so thats not unusual. I rate it a 10!!

I followed the recipe, but I did not do all the foil water stuff.  I put a pie pan of water under the cheesecake,  it came out great and everyone really like it.  we have different pumpkin recipe we have use that we like, but this was easy and came out perfect.

This was FANTASTIC!  I made this for Thanksgiving.   The flavor was sublime and the light texture was soooo perfect!  Even the crust was just right. Everyone loved it.
I made this exactly as it is written except instead of a water bath, I put a shallow square pan of water that was larger in area than the springform pan on the rack just below the cheesecake while it cooked.   I put the pan of water in the oven while it was preheating so the water was already hot and steaming when the cheesecake went in to cook.  I also followed the cheesecake making details another reviewer listed for using a kitchenaid stand mixer such as how long to mix the cream cheese and sugar (1 min on low then 3 min on high till light and fluffy) and checking for doneness with a meat thermometer (155-160 F).   After one hour the temp on mine was 163 F so next time I will check it at 50 minutes.  If it matters, I used the full fat version of cream cheese and pastured unsalted butter (kerrygold).  Yum!!!

I followed the recipe to the T. I also, will never again wrap my spring form pan in aluminum foil. It leaked. I used wide foil, and wrapped it well. Who knew there was a tiny pinhole? Never again in a water bath....I'll do the hot water filled pan beneath my cheesecake, on the lower rack. Hubby and I did taste the filling, it was very good. I just don't know how far up the water seeped. I'll make this again at Christmas. I'm so bummed! At least I have Pumpkin Custard to serve tomorrow, Thanksgiving.

I must have beat the mixture too long because it rose above the top of my spring form pan which has never happened to me before.

I forgot to put the chocolate syrup on before baking.  It is delicious put on afterwards, but changes the appearance.  Maybe next time I'll get it right.  No problems getting it baked without cracks, texture was great for serving.

This truly is a 5 star recipe! Every Thanksgiving, I try out a new pumpkin cheesecake recipe in hopes of getting it just right for my fussy eaters. They like "a little pumpkin flavor" but nothing overwhelmingly pumpkin. This is it!! I have a daughter who's sensitive to nutmeg, so I omitted that - other than that, I baked it exactly as written. You can definitely taste the pumpkin, but it blends so nicely with the rest of the ingredients. I feel like Goldilocks, lol - I finally found the one that is "just right." I know this will be the only pumpkin cheesecake recipe I will need from here on out. Thanks for sharing!

very good and simple to make. I made a few changes. I added one tablespoon of vanilla and two tablespoons of sour cream. I did not put the foil around the pan, I just put a pan of boiling water in the oven beneath the cheesecake.  I also added Carmel on top of the batter along with the chocolate.  Next time I'm going to add crushed walnuts to the batter.  I followed the baking and cooking directions. It came out delicious.

Made the gluten free version for Thanksgiving. Ground up gluten free gingersnaps are an amazing substitution. If you want to avoid using a ban marie, you can cool the cheesecake in the oven. Worked for me, at least. No guarantees.

I've tried a bunch of cheesecake recipes over the years and while most were good, none compared to the quality that this recipe created.  Must be the perfect blend of ingredients.  Try this one.  You'll be glad you did.

My husband requested pumpkin pie for Christmas and my son requested cheesecake...this was PERFECT!  I started on the recipe from memory before checking it and accidentally added some chopped pecans to the crust, which turned out delicious.  We all loved it.

This was enjoyed by everyone on Christmas. I chose this recipe because it used the whole can of pumpkin, and called for brown sugar. It is very creamy and light in texture compared to other cheesecakes. I only wished mine had cooked about 5 minutes or so longer because the middle was too soft (I was waiting for my new thermepen for Christmas so did not get to check the temp, only followed basic cooking instructions). Two days later when my daughters family came over I put the leftovers in the freezer for awhile and when we ate it it was so delicious- almost a cross between pumpkin ice cream, pumpkin pie, and pumpkin cheesecake. This actually tastes very similar to my pumpkin pie, which is creamier than most other recipes, but this was much easier to make. Instead of drizzling with chocolate syrup, I served it with warmed caramel sauce and whipped cream, and was very glad I did because my family found that combination excellent. Oh- and I replaced the crust recipe with one that used ginger snaps and finely diced pecans-and wished I had pre baked the crust a bit. For those having a problem with a water bath: I use extra long heavy duty foil and wrap my pan two or three times to make sure nothing leaks. It is the perfect way to achieve a super creamy cheesecake. While this recipe was good, so are so many other pumpkin cheesecakes, and it will be quite a while before I make this one again.

I Dutchiefied a part of the recipe. I used "speculaas spices" roughly the same as pumpkin spice but more pepery in flavour and added the Speculaas cookies on the top. I brought it to a Thanksgiving party and it was a big hit! :)

I used reduced fat cream cheese and fat free evaporated milk (it's what I had on hand). It was wonderful.  My family likes more of a pumpkin spice flavor, I will add more spice next time I make it.  This is an instant family favorite.

This was so yummy and moist, I had never done the water bath method.  Everyone at dinner was in love with it and are already talking about me making more at Christmas

This recipe is now my signature Thanksgiving dessert! 
I made it last year and it came out amazing. Not too heavy, not too pumkin'y not too cheesecake'y. Literally, just right.

This cheesecake is absolutely amazing but it does take much longer than 1 hour. In my oven it took around 1 hr 45 mins. It is a very high cheesecake if you're using a typical springform pan. It is absolutely worth it though. Honestly if you screw it up and undercook it, just call it pumpkin cheesecake mousse.. lol.  I did that the first time because I blindly followed the 1 hr timeline and it wasn't even close to done. My 6 year old still devoured it like pudding and I had to cut him off so he wouldn't go into sugar shock.

This is my first "real" cheesecake!  It is still chilling to firm up.  It was easy to put together!  I hope the finishing product tastes great, I am concerned about it not firming enough.  Water did seep into foil!

I brought it to work and now I have a following and constant nagging about when I am going to do it again. Really pleased with this.
