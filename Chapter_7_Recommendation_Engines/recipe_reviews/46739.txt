Found the problem other folks are having w/ this recipe. 10min may be too long to cook your tomatoes, slice them a bit thicker than you think you should because they will cook down. If you want them to stay in one piece, they have to be pretty thick slices. Don't cook them until they're mush. Its pretty easy to overcook the tomatoes.   The other problem I saw, people felt like there wasn't enough eggs.    Last problem was probably just me- the spice looked to be "too much". So I halved it and I'm glad I did.    So, if you're gonna try this recipe again... I was satisfied with this : Two slicing tomatoes sliced thick, half can of tomato paste, 4 eggs, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp allspice, salt to taste. Serves two.   I'd give the recipe 5-stars if it worked out as posted. 4-stars because it requires a hella ton of fixing to make it the best !

I think the potential is here but WHOOOO, too much sauce and spice!!  Next time I will halve everything except the eggs and I would cut the tomatoes extra thick or just chop them up.  The flavor was good but too intense.  I will be putting the rest of this on rice tonight for dinner.  Hopefully the rice will mellow the intense flavors a little.....

Simple and delicious.  Easy to make with ingredients on hand- I added 1/2 a can of corn and my little girls loved it!

Hi. This is basically a Shashouka Recipe.  You don't have to use sunflower oil.  I typically use Olive Oil.  I poach my eggs in the tomato sauce (instead of scrambled) which looks nicer and I like my yolk a little soft.  You can also add a little diced hot peppers (your favourite) which I prefer.   Serve with fresh warm bread and a side salad ... yummm

This was interesting. I did notice it was a lot like Shashouka, except that you would poach the eggs in the sauce with Shashouka. But it was still a great way to use up tomatoes from the garden.

This recipe is similar to one of my comfort foods, which uses soy sauce and sugar instead of cumin and allspice.  I served with pita bread and it was very good.  Next time I will try serving with rice.  I will also try using at least 6 eggs instead of 4, because the ratio seemed off.  I was nervous about the tomato paste at first because it wasn't mixing in, but as the tomatoes cooked down more, they released more juice, which mixed with the tomato paste to create a sauce.  I might dilute it a bit next time with some broth.  My final product did not turn out like the picture - the tomatoes were completely cooked down and unrecognizable, but I liked it this way.  Will definitely make this again because money is tight this month...

I added 1/3 Cup chopped green onions and omitted tomato paste.  It came out tasty.  I used 2 tomatoes and 2 eggs for a single serving.

This was a bit of a disappointment. A few previous reviewers had the same problems I did. I made it exactly as written, using sea salt and sunflower oil (which was a new ingredient to me). My cooking times were 10 minutes each time - I didn't gauge them as was hinted at, but I probably should have, in retrospect. The results looked nothing like the picture - they were a gloppy mess. (This lasted me for three breakfasts, and the leftovers were a bit more solid.) Definitely no extra points for visual/textural appeal. On the other hand, the taste was somewhat good - I like cumin a lot. I agree with a previous reviewer that the proportions were off - I would add more eggs, or cut down on the tomato ingedients, if I made this again. I'd probably give this a 2-star rating, but I guess I'll add an extra star for taste/ease/healthiness.

I thought it was a tasty and filling recipe, as well as a good use of garden tomatoes.  However, my boyfriend did not like it much so it is not for everyone.

I used chopped Roma tomatoes instead of sliced hothouse tomatoes.  The flavor was okay.

I am middle eastern and although I have not tried this particular version I was raised eating it prepare the way Layla13 explained in her review. Additionally, it is served with pita bread.  I will be trying this version as it includes all the ingredients and spices I like in general.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Lovely flavour! I followed reviews and cooked the tomatoes a lot less and only put 1/4 tsp cumin and 6 eggs. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks

I have to admit I thought this sounded really strange, but I had a lot of tomatoes so I tried it anyway.  Turned out to be quite good.  I didn't have enough tomato paste so I used some home-made spaghetti sauce and it was very tasty.  Thanks!

This was good. I served it with couscous and toast, and the kids added ketchup (as they do with scrambled eggs). I didn't time how long I let it cook, just used common sense.

Very different. Tony wasn't sure that he would try them again. Maybe try it with more eggs. And add sour cream.
