This was great but I made it a little better.  First the sauce must be a clear color and takes over the flavor of the meat.  The meat also needed a little help.  This is what I did.  For the meatballs, I added 1 TBS of Worcestershire Sauce and used 1 TBS Arrowroot instead of the other starches because there is no flavor and it is clear.  For the sauce, I substituted again Arrowroot for the other starch mixture for a clear and no aftertaste thickener.  I also changed the 1/2 cup sugar to 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup Brown sugar and I added 1 TBS Lemon Juice for tartness.  This turned out clean, clear with a lot of sweet/sour flavor.  My family of 62 people, all home styled Chefs thought it was great.  I married a Russian.  Need I say more?

This was pretty good. I did make some changes. I was leary about putting cornstarch in the meatballs so I substituted dry bread crumbs. Instead of frying the meatballs I cooked them in the oven. For the sauce I doubled the soy, pineapple juice and vinegar. I replaced the fresh pineapple with red bell pepper. All and all it came out good and I also served it over rice.

Very good recipe! My suggestions:  Double the sauce ingredients if you are serving over rice.  Want to cut calories? Use splenda instead of sugar.  Spray Pam in pan prior to browning meatballs and omit oil prior to adding pineapple juice.  If sauce is too thick for you add additional juice or water.

This is really authentic. We had it over garlic fried rice with veggie egg rolls. I didn't really care for the meatballs, but I'm not really a fan, even in Italian food. I did enjoy the veggies and I liked the taste of the sauce. Hubby, who loves this sort of food, really enjoyed it.

I have made this recipe twice, and there is just enough sauce.  The first time I doubled the sauce as others had mentioned.  It made too much sauce, and all we tasted was the sauce.  The second time we kept the recipe as is, and it was perfect.

As for the meatballs, I was leary about using cornstarch, but I did and they were the best meatballs I tasted.  They were moist, delicate and just melts in your mouth.

Absolutely awseome! You can double the sauce as most here have suggested, or use half pork, half beef, (that's what I did...excellent) but whatever you do, make it! Your loved ones will think you've become a chef! (I know mine did.....now to live up to this ..hmmmmmm)  LOVED IT!!  Rob

I have tried other recipes, and this one is my family's favorite. I always make extra for left overs too. I do add more veggies though. Always extra peppers and sometimes celery too. What ever I have that might work.

Great!

Added chunks of pineapple to the meat prior to making the meatballs. Added just a little zest, and blended great with the rest of the recipe.

Served over rice.

This was something diffrent to make and it turned out really good.  I do agree with some other reviewers that the meatballs could be a little better, but it is a great start.  Next time I'm just gonna make the sauce and veggies and use shrimp or chicken for my meat.

Another great use for hamburger. This turned out very good. My family really enjoyed this dish. I used dried minced onion in the meatballs. I sauteed the onion and the green pepper strips with the meatballs just before I poured the sauce over. I used rice vinegar. My husband isn't a pineapple fan, so he just picked the meatballs out of the sauce, but even he enjoyed this dish. I'll keep this recipe in my file, thanks so much!
UPDATE 4-2011:
I fixed this using fresh minced onion in the meatballs, added a little panko bread crumbs to the beef, I used canned pineapple and the juice from the can, didn't have carrot and tossed in the onion and some diced green pepper from the freezer (still frozen) in to the sauce and cooked it a few minutes. Awesome recipe! Super Easy.

OMG...so good and so easy. Even my 7 year old cleaned her plate, and my husband had to step away from the table because he couldn't stop eating. Would also be good with chicken or pork. This is definitely going in our regular rotation!

I made this recipe almost as is and my husband and I loved it. I will definitely make again. I didn't see the need for the oil - so I omitted that and I steamed the veggies a bit before adding to the sauce because we prefer them a bit softer.  Next time I may try to reduce the amount of sugar.  We watch our calories and 1 cup is a lot of sugar.  But overall excellent recipe and will definitely make again.

Very, very good! I used red peppers because they were on sale and threw in some broccoli that I had on hand. It was very colorful and really tasty. I will definately make this again and will try it with chicken soon. My stepdaughter couldn't believe it was homemade except she said she knew it was better than any of the local restaurants! Thanks QUIKSMYLE!!

This is an awesome Sweet and Sour Meatball recipe!  After reading many of the reviews, I did double the sauce.  I made the meatballs as is but I did add about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, and more than a pinch of fresh ground pepper.  I also baked the meatballs in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  For the sauce, I doubled everything across the board except for the pineapple juice.  I used a large can of pineapple tidbits which yielded 1 cup of juice, so I just added filtered water to make 2 cups of juice.  As suggested in another review, instead of using all white sugar, I used half brown sugar and half organic evaporated cane juice sugar (because that's all I had, but regular sugar would be just fine.)  Delish!!  I will be making this one again!

This was fairly good. I made 2 batches. 1st batch had way to much sweet and sour sauce and not quite enough of everything else. So the 2nd batch was made with this adjustment..increased ground beef to 2lbs and 1 addtional egg and 1 tsp minced garlic. Increase pineapple juice just to 1 1/3 cup, decresased vinegar to 2 tbsp, pineapple to 2 cups, 2 bell peppers, 1 whole carrot and 1 whole onion. And that worked very nicely. That's how I remember sweet and sour meatballs when I lived in Guam.

These were okay, I had some left over pineapple to use up, so thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Other than using fresh pineapple, I followed the recipe and was not overly impressed.  I didn't care for the consistency of the sauce.  I did of course adjust it afterward but if made as written this recipe is 3 stars at best.

Soooooo delicious! I'm a vegetarian so I used soy "meatballs." I doubled the sauce and added a bunch more veggies. The sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and sour. This was quick and easy to make and yummy to eat. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this recipe before, and definitely recommend doubling the sauce. I also toss in a little lemon or lime juice for extra tartness.

Last night, though, in a fit of crazy brilliance, I threw in some fresh cranberries with the pineapple juice, and later added a couple of spare jalepenos! Sure the cranberries turned the leftovers a very unique shade of purple - but the flavour was GREAT! And a nice little zip to boot!

This was great. Made it for a pot luck and it was the first to go. I'm glad I read the reviews because I followed someone's suggestion and added Worcestershire to the meat and I think that's what made them "pop"

I doubled the sauce for these meatballs.  My daughter and I are also vegetarian, so I made the meatballs using GimmeLean soy, and they were great.  I think the sauce is very good, but my husband thought it was too sweet.  Next time I make it, I will try adding lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer.

This wasn't awful, but I don't think I'll make this again. I have made sweet and sour before, using a mix for a base and liked that better. Maybe I should have cut down on the sugar more. I also think this needed far more veggies.

We really enjoyed this recipe served over rice. I had some leftover meatballs to use up from another recipe, so I just made the sauce and veggie combo as listed here (with the addition of some broccoli to the mix). I did sautee the vegetables before adding everything into the sauce mixture. Overall, the recipe has a nice flavor to it. I made this looking for something different, but I ended up with a recipe that I'll definitely be making often. Thanks for sharing!

This by far was one of my favorite recipes that I have prepared from this site. I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. Changes I made were I baked the meatballs as one of the reviewers noted and I added green onions and a bit of bread crumbs to the ground beef. ooh I also doubled the sauce as one reviewer said. It tastes so great over the rice. I would give this recipe more stars if I could!!

Good recipe.The beef meatballs were ok but maybe if they were pork the meat taste would be milder and more complimentary to the sweet sour sauce. Will have to try it with ground pork next time. I started the sauce (added a few chili flakes) in my skillet but then let it thicken with the meatballs in my slow cooker for 4 hours on low (longer is better) but added the veggies only at the last hour of cooking. The meatballs were softer after soaking in the sauce overnight so it was better the next day.I'll make this recipe again since I can easily tweak it to my liking if I want some extra flavour.

I tripled this recipe for a party and it turned out great!  I also split the sugars, half brown, half white, and I used my own meatball recipe.  I didn't use quite as much cornstarch as the sauce called for and I let the veggies and meatballs simmer in the sauce for about an hour, then they sat in the fridge overnight.  It was delicious and easy.  I will use this recipe from now on!!! Loved it!

Very good. I boiled the meatballs to cut back fat. Added mushrooms just because I like mushrooms.

Made this for dinner last nite, the sauce was great, even my picky 6 yr. old ate it on rice. The meat balls were just a little blaa, not a big hit. Will try again with my meatballs. Thanks for the great sauce.

I really liked the meatballs using ground chicken instead of the ground beef and will use the meatball recipe again but where I had problems was with the sauce.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly and found that 3 TBSP of cornstarch for the amount of liquid seemed to be too much, I ended up with a very thick gluey type sauce.  I had to add more liquid and in the end added 1/4 cup ketchup and 2/3 cup of water and it tasted quite good. I did measure my cornstarch accurately and used level TBSP's not heaping, so not quite sure what I did wrong,

I am a big fan of sweet and sour chicken, and I love meat balls with marinara sauce. However, I have discovered that I am not partial to meatballs in sweet and sour sauce. I thought the meatballs were really bland, and I wasn't especially impressed with the sauce either - there are better recipes for both on this site. Sorry.

Do you know that thing that happens when you have something you really, really like?  You want more.  This is the case here.  So now, I've waited a respectable 4 days and I'm making it again tonight. I just loved it!  Adding other veggies will do, but onions and peppers are a must!  Thanks!

I did as the submitter suggested and made this a vegetarian dish substituting the meatballs with chopped broccoli.  I really like the sauce and didn't find it too sweet.  I did not add the carrots but would recommend doing so because the more veggies, the better.  This was yummy...thanks Poni.

Great!  I doubled the recipe.  I used quite a bit less sugar because I don’t like things too sweet.  I added hot pepper flakes.  I used fresh pineapple and juiced two cups for the recipe.  Oh I also added celery for crunch.

Everything was really good except the meatballs.  I am going to try the recipe again with some sauteed shrimp.  Probably be a lot easier, and better.

Although I added ginger, lemon, more salt, and garlic powder, I still found the meatballs and sauce bland.  I'll look for a different sweet and sour recipe next time I want to make meatballs.

I made this last night and it was pretty good. I recommend cutting all the veggies first to keep the cooking time down to a minimum. I used 1 lb. of ground beef & 1 lb. of lean ground turkey which kept the meatballs moist. I forgot to take into account that I added more meat which left us lacking the sauce, mmmm so good, I used brown sugar instead of white. I had to make it a little on the plain side for my picky eaters so no peppers & no onion. Next time I think I'll add some chili & a little garlic to the sauce & definitely double on the sauce recipe. Overall it was good. Thanks for sharing! :)

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doubling the sauce.  I loved the flavor in the sauce but the combination of the meatballs and the sauce didn't work for me.  I might have liked a lighter meatball made with chicken or turkey.  The sauce would be yummy over chicken or shrimp.

There was literally nothing left!!  Everyone loved this dish and it was easy.  I doubled the sauce, as some here suggested, and I didn't have cornstarch, so I just used some flour.  Next time I might consider using frozen meatballs, to speed up the process a bit.

I loved the sauce and vegetables.  I did not care for the meatballs at all however.  They had a strange texture (from a lack of bread crumbs or oatmeal is what I think) and little taste.  I would make this again but with a different meatball recipe.  Also, I had never tried frying meatballs before, had previously only baked them, but wanted to give it a try.  I think baking is much, much easier.

I thought this was pretty good.  Husband loved it because I used beef instead of my usual ground turkey.  I didn't put the pineapple in, just used about 3/4 c. red bell pepper.  I may have liked it better if there was another vegetable in it-- broccoli maybe?

This recipe is wonderful.  I did not use the bell green pepper and carrots.  I added one chopped apple and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes. Served them as an appetizer last night, not one left! They not only ate them all, but I had to give them the recipe too!

Pretty quick and easy to make.  I might cut down a little on the sugar next time, because it was a little too sweet, but otherwise very good.  It is very good served over white rice.
