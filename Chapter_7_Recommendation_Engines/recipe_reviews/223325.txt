Halfed the recipe and it still worked great in a pie dish (did have to bake it a little longer). I also made a few adjustments. 
Used greek yogurt in place of sour cream.
Used avocado instead of mushroom.
Cut down the cheese on top and used gouda instead.
Mixed in a handful of fresh spinach.
Loved it and plan to do it again soon for a pot luck.

I cut the ingredients in half and it made just enough for my family of four (2 adults, 2 children). Used an 9x9 baking dish and followed the same instructions from  the recipe. It was a big hit!

This was good!  I followed the recipe except I cut it in half and added some green chili and bell pepper.  It's a flexible recipe that allows you to add ingredients you may prefer.

I made this for a group this morning and it was a big hit.  I added a few chopped nacho peppers and reduced the amount of onion.  It is easy and tasty.

Tripled the recipe.  Used a large aluminum pan.  Made the night before and heated up in the morning for my daughters high school swim team breakfast.  They went crazy over it!  Not one morsel left in the pan. Will make again for the family in the original size and maybe Ill get some!

We love this recipe, it is very versatile. We took out the tomatoes and added jalapenos and green onions.  We have used a variety of protein such as ham chunks, bacon and the sausage. We prefer the sausage. We also added cayenne pepper for added spice. We also added more sour cream for richness. Love it and make it all the time. Serve with your favorite salsa!

Followed some other reviews and used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.   Used bacon bits and strained salsa, was delicious.  Puffed up quite a bit when baked, not sure why but texture was very nice.

I made it without sausage because my sister included it in a dish with hash browns. I also added spinach and used small sweet tomatoes instead.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good. I added more sausage.  Probably try it with broccoli next time.
