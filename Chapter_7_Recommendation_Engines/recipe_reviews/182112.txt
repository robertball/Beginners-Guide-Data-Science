This was absolutely delicious.  I added kale at the end, and could feel the health as I ate it.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the method could be improved.  I first sauteed the veggies before adding the broth to develop their flavor more.

A really easy recipe when you want a nice hot, soup FAST.  I didn't have cabbage on hand so I threw in an equivalent amount of celery and it turned out delicious.  It's just the right consistency, something that always seems to be an issue when blending soups.  I will definitely make it again.

This soup is easy to make and really good!  I did not blend it, though.

Very good!  A nice light soup that is also very forgiving.  I doubled the recipe and used more carrots and cabbage.  I also threw in a couple stalks of celery and a couple of parsnips (had to get used up).  I also added about 1 tsp of curry and a splash of apple cider vinegar (as others suggested).  Used the immersion blender right in the pot to blend everything up.  Will put on the Winter soup rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent vegetable soup! We were having it with Rueben sandwiches, so didn't try it this time, but for a stand alone dinner soup, I might try it with kielbasa slices added.  I did not blend the soup, as I kind of liked the rustic look and feel of it as it was.  I did add a little bit of instant potato buds to slightly thicken the broth.  YUMMY soup!

Very tastey and easy to make.  I kept the ingredients the same however I did not blend the soup.  I finely chopped all the veggies, cooked and served.

Great!  It was very easy to make and very forgiving because I wasn't too precise with the measurements.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was way better than I thought it would be. I blended half of it, it was a very nice texture.  Also, I added a little bit extra basil/thyme (probably a 1/2 teas).  And when I made the broth, I added 6 cups of water and 3 chicken boullion cubes.  It was very good!

I am not partial to thyme and there was far too much in this recipe (even at 1/4 tsp). Next "thyme" (ha! get it?) I will know to use less. I decided to crock pot this and it turned out well! 4 hours on high was perfect. I also didn't blend it. Could use a tad more salt. Will try the recipe again only modifying the spices a bit... maybe more basil?

I was looking for something to make with a bag of pre cut cabbage that I had on hand and I came across this soup.  I used 8 cups of vegetable stock, powdered thyme, and about 2 tsps of parsley (no other herbs).  Definitely saute the vegetables first in a bit of olive oil and butter if you like.  The increase in flavor makes it very worth while.  I pureed about 3-4 cups of the soup which gave the soup some additional flavor and added body but still left the fun chunky pieces to eat.  This is what I would do again the next time.  If you aren't worried crazy about calories, right before you take the soup off the heat, swirl in about 2-3 tablespoons of butter which will give the soup a great sheen and flavor.  Great soup to serve with Irish Soda Bread on a cold March day.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was easy and tasty and the leftovers didn't last long.  I didn't blend all the soup and the bits of whole veggies were great.

Great soup. Great base, I added 3 more cups of chicken bouillon and used the whole cabbage and added a ham hock, 2 stalks of celery, and 3 tablespoons of instant mash potatoes to get the desired consistency. (add more or less to suit you) I Removed the ham hock and used a hand mixer to chop up about 1/3rd of vegetables.  It turned out delicious and I forgot to add the Thyme! Oops.
Thanks Don!

I thought this was very tasty.  I added some turnip, and only blended 3/4 of it.  I've made it several times now and love it!

This soup goes over very well in our house, even with 4 picky eaters.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious.  My husband had me set aside a serving for him that was not blended to compare and he prefers it unblended.  In the subsequent times I have prepared this recipe I have added whatever vegetables we happen to have in the produce drawer that were on their way out.  It has been delicious every time.  We typically shred everything instead of slicing them and I don't blend it for the first night, but I do blend the leftovers before I freeze them.

Warning - modifications ahead but I don't make soup often and really appreciated this as a base and the other reviews. I didn't use any white potato - only sweet and carrots, added a ton more garlic because I love garlic. I sauted the veggies first. Since I removed white potato - I added lentils which just up'd the health factor by a ton! I also love spice so I added chili pepper flakes. AND finally I added Kale at the end again to really increase the nutrients in this dish. Please don't hate me for all my modifications! Take this as a way to modify the dish to your liking. :)

I thought this was a great vegetable soup for a warming lunch on a chilly and rainy Illinois day.  I did saute the veggies before adding the stock and although I didn't blend the soup, I did use my potato masher to "round off" the edges.  Packaged cole slaw mix cuts the prep time and makes this even easier.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It is hearty and healthy.  I always double for leftovers and the freezer.  I did saute the veggies; carrots, celery, onions, then cabbage prior to mixing all ingredients.  I really think the saute adds to the flavor of the stock.  Passed the recipe on to pfiends and family!  Making it today, a football Sunday afternoon.  Thank you, Dan, for submitting this recipe.  I wanted a  potato soup without the fattening & cholesterol laden cream.

This is super easy, super quick and very inexpensive to make. I did not have any basil...don't know how that happened but I was out so I used a touch more tyhme and it was good! I would make it again. Very filling. Mild in flavor and I blended half of the soup. Thank you.

Good recipe.  As most people say, I think it is the perfect soup to modify to your liking and to use up all the veg on the verge of going bad in the fridge.

My modifications were:
1. I used leeks instead of onions, baby redskin potatoes with the skin on, added leftover mashed potatoes, multicolored carrots (those cool red, orange and yellow ones) and some apple cider vinegar.
2.  I sauteed the leeks and the garlic in olive oil with some cracked black pepper and Celtic sea salt to start.
3.  I used a homemade stock for the broth.

It is really good, I usually end up mixing about half of it up to get a more satisfying texture.  The cabbage can hide better that way, too.

Good for a cold, grey day with a little one sick.  Crank in that garlic and help fight the germs!

Since I'm going to the bother of slicing/dicing potatoes and carrots and onions, I decided I might as well increase the flavour of this soup by 50% by sauteing or sweating them. I skipped the salt and added a nice dash of hot sauce (could use a sprinkling of cayenne or hot pepper flakes). I like to have some small chunks, so I mash the cooked soup with a potato masher instead of using the blender, which is always a messy job. Delicious.

Surprisingly, quite tasty. It was super easy and the result was good. I've made soups with similar ingredients that were much more time consuming but the results were equally delicious. 

I followed directions fairly closely, just added more cabbage and less carrots, as that's what I had on hand. I blended completely. 

Not the best soup in the world but great for what it is.

This recipe has been in our family for years. It sounds like it wouldn't be yummy, but trust me, it is super easy and delish! My kids love it and when I make it, each time I make it a little bit bigger so everyone can have left overs the next day for lunch. This is a recipe staple in our home.(I do not blend mine, we like it hearty and our recipe looks just like picture number three)

I did not have potatoes but made anyways. I did not miss them. I did increase the cabbage to 1/2 head. I also did not blend 100% but kept some chunks of carrot. GREAT soup!!

I add sweet potato instead of white potato.  Also, I saute ground chicken and put thyme, sage and parsley flakes in (1 bay leaf too). I add 2 cups veg. juice(v8) along with chocken stock.

This soup was SUPER easy. I probably used a little more veggies than the recipe said and ended up adding about 3 more cups of broth. I did not blend at all, and it was delicious.

So flavorful and delicious!  Left out the oil, subbed veggie broth and added a pinch of red pepper and sage (only a PINCH!) and it is fantastic!  Would try again without the potatoes to make carb free.

Second weekend making this! Great to use up carrots from garden. Perfect as is but I did add 1 c celery and 1lb Polska kielbasa sausage and we really like it with the meat.  I did not blend it and did saute all of the veggies in about 1 c chicken broth and olive oil before adding remaining broth and herbs.

Fantastic soup!  I even accidentally added too much cabbage, and it still turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

WONDERFUL soup! It's been a crowd-pleaser every time. I add a little ground ginger, a dash of apple cider vinegar, a healthy dollop of plain yogurt and a nice dose of prepared brown mustard.

This soup was so easy & very good, the only difference  was I made was with Thai Coconut Curry broth because that was all I had.  The hubby & I couldn't get enough of it.  I will make it next time with regular chicken stock just to see how different it is.

I'm a big fan of pureed vegtable soups, and this one does not dissapoint.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, the main difference was that I used nearly the whole head of cabbage, and it turned out excellent, nice and creamy and full of flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good - very easy.  Everyone had seconds!  What a great way to get my family to eat a variety of vegetables without them realizing it : )  I added a few spices to suit our taste (a little oregano and a little white pepper) but very good.  Thanks for sharing!

I would definitely make this soup again. Only changed I made was to add 3/4 head of cabbage and added the salt at the end when the soup was near room temperature rather than during cook time. I was worried there would be to much salt with the six cups of broth. Also I only blended half so there was still chunks of veggies and a nice creamy texture. Very good.

I followed the recipe to a T, until...
________________________________________________
It was okay, but I'm not partial to thyme, hence, just 3 stars.

  However, since the recipe called for such a small amount of thyme, I figured, what the heck, and added it.  Sure enough, it ruined the soup... for me anyway.  But all was not lost; as usual, curry saved the day!  :)  If  you like the delicious taste of curry, and happen to screw up a savory dish like this, curry will come to the rescue every time.   It cancels the taste of just about any other spice - simply keep adding pinches of curry until you can barely detect the flavor of the unwanted spice.  I was able to detect only a hint of thyme, and the soup turned out to be really delicious!  :)

Excellent soup! I had field onions, carrots, potatoes and cabbage in my local market share bag this week, so this recipe was exactly what I needed! My one and only addition was some leftover roasted corn that I cut off the cob. This would be equally as good made with vegetable stock. All that's needed for a delicious meal is a pan of cornbread or a crusty Italian bread. Make sure you freeze some for the upcoming cold/flu season!

Don't blend this beautiful soup! This is the second time making it. Amazing soup. I don't blend the soup and I add more potatoes and it comes out so delicious. I use canned chicken broth low sodium. One of these days I am going to make my own chicken broth and then make this soup. This soup is a keeper.

This is pretty salty!!!  And I only used 1/2 of what it called for! So the sodium content is pretty revolting :( Taste wise, it's bland... not bad, just bland. Eh~ I'll try it again but with more spices, garlic, and some flavor :o)

I added fennel instead of onion, and sauted the garlic, fennel & carrots in the olive oil b4 adding the rest of the ingredients.  Used 2 serving size ingredients, except chicken stock - 3 cups of homemade stock - no sodium.  Also added a pinch of dried sage.  Served with Italian Herb Foccia bread - YUMMY!!!

This is an excellent soup.  I left all the veggies in chunks, as I don't like the texture of pureed/blended soups.  I also used homemade vegetable stock to cut the sodium.  I will be making this one again soon!

This was a good, hearty soup, but needed meat to make a meal of it for our family. We added 2 cups of shredded corn-beef, in honor of our Irish heritage while removing the salt. We then ate it with large squares of hot-buttered corn bread. Yum!

A upbeat, clarifying soup that helps elevate a chest cold up to your sinuses so you can blow some of it out. I ate this with piles of electric blanket across my lap, set at medium-high heat. Vegetable broth replaced the chicken stock, and I doubled the spices, and declined to blend. Overall, similar to many soups on this website, but none the worse for it. Well done.

We had our St. Patty's Day celebration this past weekend, so I used up the leftover carrots, potatoes and cabbage in this soup.  I blended the soup in the hopes that I could get my family to try it, but they weren't willing.  I thought it was pretty good and imagine it would be even better if the veggies were cooked in the broth, as directed.  I did add a dash of red pepper for a little kick.

I would definitely make this again. It is a great base that you can tailor to your own taste. Adding some cooked chicken or ham after blending would be a nice addition, and/or you could add some white beans to make it even more hearty.

nice and creamy and delicious. I only pureed a portion of the soup. I loved the carrots in it. I seasoned with a fantastic seasoning here in New Orleans, Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning "Veggie Flavor." I made one HUGE mistake and I guess it shows my lack of experience with cabbage. I used the leaves on the outside of the cabbage, they were so beautiful and the cabbage was bought from a local farmer. Now I know why the grocery stores removed the outer leaves, they NEVER got tender. If I had removed the veins but I didn't. I ate the soup and it was still okay but I sure wouldn't offer it to a friend! Lesson learned! I am so tired of learning lessons the hard way... lol

Excellent soup and easy to throw together.  One pot cooking is my style.  Followed as written except I omitted thyme as I didnt have any and used 3 cloves of garlic.  You can substitute veggie broth for chicken broth.

I didn't have green cabbage, so I used red cabbage.  I grow parsley and basil, so I used fresh herbs instead of dried.  This is a tasty soup.  I season my own bowl at the table with a dollop of Greek yogurt, and a pour of wine vinegar.  If I had thought ahead to make croutons, they would have been a great addition.  I will make this again.

Very tasty soup! Even my kids liked it. I did cook the carrots and onions in the pan before boiling them, I think that's important. Also, to achieve consistent results, especially when making 2-3 times the recipe, it would be great if the quantities were in cups instead of number of vegetables of a certain size... this is too vague, though of course it is not critical for a recipe like this. I will make this recipe again for sure.

When you taste the broth of a soup and say, oooo, tis good! The broth was even better next day. I cooked the soup in the crockpot, did not blend it and threw in a small piece of kielbasa I had left in freezer. My husband and I both loved it.

Definitely will make again.   Very tasty as written and quick easy soup!!  I added 1/2 # of fried Jimmy Dean sausage at the end and would try Ham too another time.   Like a bit of meat in the soup!  I used an immersion blender and only blended a small amount of the soup in the pot to thicken it a bit.

I didn't blend it at all, I sautéed all the veggies in olive oil and  I added chicken to it already boiled and shredded from this morning ?? It was delicious everyone wanted seconds..... I had to make 2 cups of my own broth because the chicken stock only made enough for 4 cups and using the empty broth box I added water to it then emptied it to a measuring cup till it marked 2 cups and added a cap full of Chicken flavor powder by Knorr and that created a broth on its on. It was DELICIOUS I will definitely repeat this soup for cold times. In Houston it's hot right now but I was anxious to make this soup today.

Excellent. I kept the amount of veggies the same but only used a box of chicken broth (about 4 cups).  It was thick and tasty.  Even my 8 year old liked it!  Next time though I might add a little more liquid or a little less veggies.

I started by lightly frying the onion, carrot, cabbage, garlic in the olive oil in a large pot. I didn't have basil, but I had fresh parsley so I added half a bunch of chopped parsley. When the vegetables had softened, I added the remaining ingredients and brought the mixture to a simmer before adding potatoes. I let them cook for 15 minutes.  In the last five minutes, I added a handful of snow peas. It came out sooooooo good! I'll make this often.

I've made soup from this recipe at least a few times over the past couple years & love it! Only things I do differently are add more cabbage (1/2 head or so instead or 1/4) & only blend it partway. So it's not totally smooth and has a little more hearty texture. Delicious!

I followed this recipe as written except for the blending. At first I only blended it a little and felt the flavor was a little bland.  I also didn't care for the texture, so I blended it till it was smooth and that's when all the flavors came together to make a wonderful soup. The extra step makes all the differences so don't skip it. This is going in my keeper file. Thanks Andrea

Rather than half a cabbage, I use a whole green cabbage and I leave the vegetables unblended. I use a sweet potato instead of a white potato and add crushed red pepper. As another reviewer suggested, I add a splash of 
Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and 1 t of curry plus whatever is in my vegetable bin that needs to be used. I like this recipe and have made it 3 - 4 times because I typically have everything needed on hand.

Nice and healthy soup. I replaced the cabbage with celery as I didn't have any cabbage in hand, and added some chili as I prefer spicy soups.

Delicious soup..I followed the recipe to the T except for I sauteed the veggies before adding the broth to develop their flavor more..It's easy to make,super healthy and fresh.Make sure you use decent carrots else the flavor will differ.I've been eating it without blending but the last bit i did blend,and it was super.Must try

very good. I made some modifications to make this a vegetarian main meal. firstly, i fried all the vegetables in the olive oil till tender, then I added 1tablespoon apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon sugar with vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. I just mashed all the vegetables together instead of blending and added a small can of baked beans in tomato sauce for protein. I also made dumplings and allowed them to simmer for 20minutes as per recipe. healthy and filling meal.

This soup was very tasty!  I'm always pleased when I try a recipe and I don't have to make a whole bunch of tweaks to it to get it to taste good.  I pretty much left the recipe as is except I sautéed the onion, carrot, garlic and cabbage in 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil before adding it to the soup and then I left it chunky.  I seriously doubt if I will get my kids to eat this but I'm perfectly happy to gobble it all up myself.  I don't think it takes quite as long to prep as the recipe says.  The chopping went quickly (although I did use pre-diced onions) and the sautéing was pretty hands off.  Once I got it in the skillet, I only stirred every so often because I wanted the veggies to start to carmelize.  I used medium heat and a heavy, cast iron skillet so I was able to do other things during this part of the prep.  Overall, a keeper that I will make again.

Great recipe! I made the vegan version-substituted water for the chicken broth. Also changed the herbs a bit - added oregano and mustard, cut the parsley. I caramelized the onion first, then added some garlic till fragrant, then added the chopped veggies. I did blend it in the Cuisinart. Wow! My kids ate it with brown bread toast.

This has become a staple in our household. It's the proportions that are most important. You can replace the specific vegetables a bit if you need to, but what's great about this soup is the consistency that it comes out with.

I made this but used bacon grease instead of olive oil.  Also, added a dash of siracha sauce.  Delicious!

I halved this recipe and used an "italian herb" grinder to taste instead of the thyme and basil(what I had on hand) and it still came out great.  Love this soup, so easy to make and flavorful. Thanks for sharing!

Very good vegetable soup. No need to blend - it is great as is. I usually add a few more carrots and use a 1/2 head of cabbage (sometimes double the spices as well). Leftovers are great.

Simple, healthy, and tasty!  Made as written, next time I may just blend half of it.  Had the consistency of applesauce.  I liked it, but my husband said it needed meat - go figure!  Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious! I followed the recipe to a T, but only blended about 3 quarters of it. It has a wonderful consistency and it is bursting with flavour! Hi 5's... I will definitely make this again.

This was really good. If you're not crazy about Thyme, I also make a version using curry and adding chickpeas. For a vegan treat, substitute veggie broth for the chicken which is what I normally use. Do try this soup in any variation. It's really good!

I used leftover cabbage from St. Patty's day feast, so it was seasoned with pickling spices. I don't know if this made any difference. I also forgot to add the olive pil. OOPS. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. After I used the blender, it was the consistency of bisque. This is now one of my favorite soups to make. YUMMY.

My husband and I loved this! I had ran out of parsley but it was still great! Only two things I did different was use less onion, small cubed the poatoes and I only blended 1/4 of it :o) It did make a lot, which is great for left overs! Thank you! Such a cheap, healthy dinner!

I found it bland. The recipe makes a lot. We ate it for days and everyday I added something to try to give it some "omph".  The best was a bit of Campbell's tomatoe soup concentrate with a splash of water. I won't make it again.

I doubled it to use on hand cabbage and added I/2 sweet and 1/2 russet potatoes.  i knew the herb  and spice would need boosting to my taste but it was a very good recipe to build on in the future.  I diced and cut the vegetables knowing I would prefer not to blend and it worked fine but a bit more prep.

Love it, I didn't blend it this time, my daughter can't eat tomatoes so this was great. Next time double batch, blend one and leave the other as is.  Great taste, just adjust it to your taste buds :)

This was so easy!!!  I sautéed the garlic and onions first then added cabbage, sweet potato, white potato and carrots and cooked for 5 minutes the added the broth. I added one sweet potato and one white for more color, used vegetable broth instead of chicken, fresh basil and lemon juice. Soooo yummy! 
Thank you for this great recipe ??

Tasted great but I did change it up a little… I’m not a fan of. Puréed Soups so I sautéed the carrots, onions, garlic and spices  in the oil for about 10 mins, then I added veggie broth (To keep it vegan) and boiled that for about 20 mins.  Then I used an immersion blender to “kinda “ purée the soup, and THEN I added the diced potatoes and cabbage, cooking it another 20 mins.  Result was a chunk cabbage soup with thick base.  I added a little hot sauce and it was perfect!

Excellent soup for cold winter nights. It is easy and relatively quick to make and filling. Also easy to update with your own preferences. Put it along side some cornbread or biscuits and you will sigh. Comfort food it is.

My husband was sick and I wanted to make him feel better. I decided not to blend it as he doesn’t care for that and it came out great!  I increased the garlic and reduced the carrots. I doubled the recipe with the expectation of freezing some but we didn’t have any leftovers!  In my husbands words, “This is a do over!”

Very good!  This couldn't be easier or faster.  I sauteed the veggies before putting them in the stock.  I didn't have potatoes, but I did have half a large daikon.  So, I used the daikon instead of potato.  I didn't blend the soup.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty.  I did alter the basic recipe a bit.  I added a dash of sage, celery salt, a tbsp apple cider vinegar, also a can diced tomatoes, had some scallions I needed to use up so added those too plus a handful of cilantro chopped a bit.  Will definitely make again.

I sautéed the vegetables before adding the broth. First onions and garlic. Then cabbage and finally carrots and potatoes. I used both sewer and white potatoes. I blended half of the soup.

This soup was a nice way to use cabbage that I bought by mistake.  “Medium head” is subjective; I used half of a head that I’d estimate to have been about 6 inches in diameter.  I added a little water, as it did not seem there was enough liquid.  Turns out there was, so our soup was more well, soupy, than it would have been.  But we really enjoyed it, and it “feels” super healthy.  Will make it again!

I don't know what I did wrong but this did not turn out.  Too much cabbage?

Easy to make, wonderful taste. The only change I made was I did not blend the soup at the end. I left it chunky. It was delicious.

Excellent base for many soups and easily adapted to adding other vegetables as other reviewers suggested.  I made a large batch with half blended and then added the other half back with some chicken for an evenjng meal with crusty bread - delicious .

Far tastier than I expected, and is lightening fast for a soup.  From peeling vegetables to the table in under 2 hours.   I can see lots of different ways to change this up,  using whatever needs to be used up.  This is definitely a new go to for us!

I made a big 7quart pot of this, 1/2 very large cabbage grated in the food processor with 5 med carrots, 6 potatoes chopped really small, 3 leeks chopped fine, heaping teaspoon of mustard, hot pepper flakes and a dash of Tabasco, 2 tetra packs of chicken broth, basil, thyme (I never measure just eyeball) and the crowning flavour was some fennel (I used one drop of fennel essential oil - food grade, as I didn't have fennel seed). The fennel sweetened the soup up and tied the flavours together. It was delicious. I just did a few bursts with emmersion blender as I didn't want it totally blended. Plus I added more water at the end as it was very thick.

Good and a good way to use leftover veg. (I had half a bag of slaw mix leftover and I also had a leek leftover and added that. ) I took half of the soup out of the pot and put it into a large measuring cup. I blitzed that with an immersion blender and added that pureed amount back to the soup. Made for a good texture without being too smooth. Thanks  for a recipe I will make again and again! (This soup is very similar to one at a French restaurant in Los Angeles...I might try Herbes de Provence next time in lieu of thyme/basil.) **Did indeed make it with Herbes de Prov. and I like both versions. Excellent recipe - so easy, so good - thanks again!

Used 1 1/3 gallon home made bone broth from Ball canning book. Followed all other instructions except for blending. Quadrupled vegetables added 1 tsp turmeric. Did not use thyme. Love it. Will make jp's big daddy biscuits for it.

I’m new to the Instant Pot craze and stumbled upon this recipe this morning. Had all on hand including some chopped celery tops,  a couple of bay leaves and Better than Bouillon Chicken Base instead of adding salt. Was also inspired to add 1/4 cup of barley before closing the lid and setting on it default Soup/Stew setting, which is 30 minutes. Opted not to purée...I like it just as it came out of the pot. Thanks, Dan!

One of my favorite soups now! I did sauté the veggies first with onion and garlic. I also added peas and only blended 3/4 of the soup. It was delicious with a scoop of sour cream on top of it. Definitely will be making this often.

i loved this. Looking at the recipe, nothing sticks out as unusual in a soup, but I loved the final product.

i added 1/2 cup of half n half, and some extra veggies (cabbage, cauliflower, chickpeas). i would make this again in a second.

Yummy!  Folowed the recipe, but had leftover fresh broccoli and zucchini, so I threw them in!  Blended half of the soup and the result is a nice thick broth with veggies.

I have been remiss in rating this recipe, not because I don’t like it, but because I LOVE it. I can’t tell you how many times I have made this, because I’ve made this SO many times. It’s a perfect cold weather soup and warms you to your bones and your soul. I do not cream this soup as we like the texture of this soup.  Otherwise, no changes made. You can’t fix perfect after all.

This recipe was easy and really just delicious. I was tempted not to blend/purée but did so as the recipe mentioned. Will try going 50/50 chunky/blitzed next time. Overall, simply yummy and comforting!

I omitted the salt (you don't need it with  broth or stock) and used organic vegetable broth instead of chicken.  This is an excellent easy go to recipe for a light healthy soup.

This recipe looked so simple, I really wasn't expecting much.  But is was excellent.  I I only had 4 cups chicken broth, so added 2 cups water and it still tasted marvelous.  I may have added more thyme and garlic (just guestimated).

Added a yam to the mix, for extra flavor.  After blended, fried up slices of apple chicken sausage (from Costco) and added to the soup along with frozen corn.  Paired with cornbread.

I used other's advice and saute'd the onions carrots and diced garlic.  I also did not bother to blend it and left it chunky and it was fine.  Was good as written, made a second time and added Turkey Kielbasa and even better!

I  love this soup and healthy besides.  The only thing I did
different was to add celery and I had 1 small parsnip and also had some soup herbs, other than that I did everything as recipe said.  Oh, I forgot, I also added fresh parsley and I did blend it and also sauteed the veggies first as other reviewers said.
Great soup and no long cooking time.  Will definitely make this again, and again.

Very tasty! Like another reviewer I didn't blend the ingredients together, but it still turned out fine. I halved the recipe since it was just for my husband and I. I found the pepper to be a overpowering, so I'll add less next time. Also, I forget to add the olive oil, but it didn't seem to make a difference.

This is delicious!  I used yellow, purple and orange carrots and added celery too.  Used a whole head of cabbage.  Sautéed all veggies before adding broth.  I doubled the recipe and added 3 chicken boullion cubes for a little extra flavor.  I made this for myself to freeze for low cal lunches.  Daughter and husband loved it, even without meat.  To make it more hearty, next time I will add ground sausage.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great easy soup... I was a bit concerned that I wasnt sauteing the onions first but in fact it turned out really well.    Have a 50% vegetarian family but everyone liked the soup.   I will make again for sure..

Ditto what others have said. GREAT base soup that takes modifications well. I added 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar to up the flavor. Tomato paste would work similarly. I did not puree because, well, I was lazy.

This was very easy and tasty! I followed the recipe and sauteed the veggies first like others suggested. The only changes  I made: I added more garlic cloves since I love garlic,  I used 2 carrots instead of 4 because 4 seemed to be too much, and used a blend of dry Italian seasoning for the spices since this blend has thyme, basil , and parsley. This is a simple soup and very good for you.

I used 2 large carrots, I potato, 2 stalks of celery and about 1/2 head of green cabbage.  Onion powder, no salt and only 4 cups of stock.  This soup is wonderful.  I didn't purée it, it looked pretty with the pcs.  Keeper for sure!!!

This was my first time making and eating cabbage soup and I REALLY liked it! I made a batch and we ate it for lunch all week. I left the salt & pepper out so that each person could season it as they liked. *I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed the veggies first. * I will make this again.

Very tastey for a simple ingredient soup.  The only thing different I did was wait to add the cabbage until after  pureeing the mixture...this gave it some "crunch".

We really enjoyed this soup, with very minor changes. Used oregano instead of dried basil & parsley (personal pref.) Added celery & sliced sausage. Next time I will saute the veggies first and I believe it will become a 5* for us! Thanks for the recipe.

I knew I would love it from reading the ingredients so I made a double batch right off.  I read the comments first and incorporated some of their ideas.  For my double recipe, I used a bag of shredded slaw mix (instead of cutting up a cabbage), a bag of shredded carrots, 5 potatoes, 2 onions, and two stalks of celery.  I doubled the seasonings for my double batch using the ones prescribed.  

Then...I used an in-pot blender for one minute rather than  taking it out in small batches and putting in a regular blender.  I have to add some additional seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic salt) to each bowl...but it is delicious.  I love the versatility and I won't need to freeze any as I am eating it all this week.  Next week when I make it again, I may add kale as I saw someone recommended that.

Really good. I did not use as much thyme, as another person said it was too much. I also added butter, and blended everything in a blender. Very good. Thank you.

What a wonderful recipe - I did have a couple doubts, but went for it and it turned out so tasty.  I added a bit of cooked sausage (at the end) to give a bit more taste - didn't need to tho!
Mine turned out rather thick - tried to half the recipe and maybe the consistency got off, but still a "keeper" for sure!
Thanks - I love Allrecipes for making my life more interesting and delicious !

Loved this simple flavorful recipe. I puréed the entire batch.  I liked the flavor but I added a half cup of cream to make it smoother and I added a bit of ground cayenne pepper for just a little spice.  This soup is inexpensive and quick and would make a great addition to any meal.

Definitely make it again.  Added fresh ginger and celery.  Also TONS of chopped fresh parsley and a little wine.  A very flexible soup for whatever you want to put in it.  I too blended most of it but first removed a few scoops of the veggies, making it more interesting to eat, with those scoops added back in.  I always find a soup is best eaten the next day too.  Definitely would consider freezing it some time when making it again.

This is simple, tasty, nutritious.  It is great alone or as a base for additions.  There is just so much you can do with it.

Very good.  Did not make any changes to recipe as given.   Very fast and easy to make.  This will be a nice soup for cold winter  days.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first recipe to try out from all recipes.com. it was totally delicious. I am sold on allrecipes.com. I get the emails daily and I could not pass this particular one up. I did not blend it as the directions said but left it in the cut form. I cannot believe how it turned out so deliciously and so easy to make. I'll be back for more recipes and maybe even subscribe to the magazine. Thank you allrecipes.com.

Loved it as is, especially si ce it is filling and low calorie. If you want a flavor boost, try carmelizing some of the onions and cabbage in some olive oil, butter or a mix of olive oil and butter before adding to the rest if the ingredients. 

We have a skinny son with low cholesterol and olive oil is a healthier oil for the rest of us.  It definitely will add extra calories. But oh ...the flavor! 

It takes awhile to get those veggies csrmelized. Definitely worth it.

It was great... I added 1 pound of smoked sausage and diced the potatoes,  carrots, and cabbage.  I did not place in blender. Served with fresh rye bread. Gave leftovers to some of my single neighbors. They loved it too.

I make this frequently during the cold months. I use a stick blender but leave it chunky. Sometimes I get wild and crazy and add a little Kim Chee instead of thyme. Good also with beef stock  rather than chicken.

Very good and easy. I used 18 ounces of bagged shredded cabbage with carrots from TJ, 4 ounces of mushrooms, a pinch of cayenne, about a Tblsp of apple cider vinegar per recommendations of others .Sauteed veggies till soft then added  chicken broth. A bit bland until I added 1/2 tsp Thyme and wow! Did not puree but used a potato masher. Result: Perfection! Will make again. It's cold here in San Francisco (of course it is - it's almost summer haha) and this soup is perfect.  Will finish with Creme Fraiche.Thank you to the submitter.

It is similar to Weight Watcher's 1 Point cabbage soup. I leave out the potatoes and add a turmip, 1 Tbs. tomato paste and 1 bay leaf and saute the onion and garlic in evoo before adding broth and other veggies. I do not blend it. I like the cut up  veggies better. Great soup!

My mother is from France and we grew up on this.  Back when vegetables were cheap, we could not afford meat.  She called it French Vegetable soup...Thank you for posting this and reminding me of how to make it.   We would add a few pieces of bacon to it for a meat flavoring but bacon was cheap back then.  We also added Turnip to it

Using a stick blender is much quicker for blending soups. Funnily enough I didn't like the smell, but when I tasted it, it tasted great.

I call this my Post Patty's Day Pick-me-up!  Brilliant soup for St. Patrick's Day veggie leftovers.  I plopped my cabbage, potatoes, and carrots into the pot, then added the onions and spices.  Cooked about 20 minutes, then threw the veggies into the food processor.  Delicious!  We put our soup over white rice and added a scoop of cream cheese.  I might try some sour cream or greek yogurt next time.  Perhaps add some black beans? YUM

I added chopped bacon and minced peppers, and sauteed the onions and peppers in the bacon fat. I was pretty sloppy at following the measurements in the recipe, and i don't have a blender, so I mashed it with a potato masher, but it still turned out good! It was an awesome, quick all-in one meal.

I used this as a way to use up my leftover corned beef and cabbage vegetables, so I followed this loosely. I sauteed half an onion, added about 3 potatoes, 2-3 cups of cabbage, and a few carrots. There were also some leftover bits of corned beef and subsequent spices (mustard seed, peppercorn etc) in the mix. I added a carton of chicken broth and a few sprigs of thyme and just left everything heat through and soften a bit more. Since everything was already cooked, it came together in no time! Hit it with the immersion blender and it ended up super smooth, creamy and flavorful like a cream of potato soup. YUM!

Easy.  I'll use this as my basic recipe.  I left out the cabbage.  Add about 1/2 cup of pink or light cream at the end for a creamy soup.

i didn't bother to blend the soup.  I chopped all the veges to bite size pieces and it was good.  I also added a bit more seasoning.  This is a good, healthy soup!

Easy to make.Good flavor. I blended about 1/2 of the soup after cooking,and added 1 cup of half&half to make it a bit creamier. I'll use low sodium chicken stock next time after seeing the sodium content in the Nutritional data

I added chicken, rice, and only blended about 1/4 of the vegetable mixture. This was very tasty, but had to add a little more salt for taste.. Very easy to make!

I had some leftover cabbage and my family is not very fond of that vegetable so I was happy to find a soup recipe where I could "hide" it. I took some other reviews rec's about sauteeing the veggies; since we were adding olive oil anyway it seemed to make sense to do a quick sautee to bring out the flavors of the garlic and onion then dump everything else in. The results were great - a quick, easy soup made up of items I usually have on hand. It's light, healthy and delicious. Can't ask for more than that!

This soup was good as written and it is a good way to get some more veg in your diet.  I thought it tasted a bit too "cabbagey" as it seemed to overwhelm the other flavors.  Next time I will try this recipe without the cabbage.  But this is the beauty of this recipe, you can pretty much make this with any vegetable and herbs you prefer!

It turned out absolutely wonderful!! I chopped all the veggies and let them sweat in the soup pan for about 10 minutes before I added the broth. The sweat really blends the flavor of the veggies quite nicely. I actually used terragon and oregano for the herbs since they were on hand and threw in some white pepper for a bit of added warmth. In my opinion white pepper is a better choice for soups such as this. PS If you've got a Ninja, this soup is even quicker yet!! I heart my Ninja.

This is the 4th time in 2 weeks that I am making this recipe. I love it for so many reasons: it's fulfilling, affordable, easy to make,  and great to freeze/and or bring to work for leftovers.  My roommate (who doesn't like cabbage even gobbled this up). I did add a little garlic powder and white pepper, but the recipe is so versatile that you could add anything to your own preference. By the way, I haven't even tried it pureed.  It's great as it is!!

There is absolutely no reason to blend this beautiful soup. It's lovely just the way it is before the blend. I also buy a rotisserie chicken and pull the meat an add to the soup about 30 minutes before its done. Best when summered about an hour to an hour and a half.

Lovely recipe and one from which you can "stray." I used some broccoli and a tiny bit or rosemary. Pureed the broccoli. Really happy to have a dairy free potato soup!!!

so simple, and so good, and got rave reviews from all my dinner guests!  I don't know why it calls to be pureed, because having the nice texture of the vegetables was what made it so satisfying.  I actually used canned diced potatoes (including the water they're packed in), which hold up really nicely in every recipe I've ever used them in and makes it that much easier.

Hi all - I enjoyed this recipe as well.  I sauteed the onions with some butter and oil, and I had some roasted garlic leftover from last night, so I used that. I blended the soup with a little milk.  Easy and satisfying!!

I think there is a mistake in this recipe! It says to blend until smooth. The picture doesn't show the final product to have benn blended until smooth. Unless they don't really mean smooth.  I wound up with more vegetables than liquid so I had to add more of the spices and chicken stock, so that through it off. I guess their definition of medium or large potatoes, carrots, etc. is different.

I will definitely be making this recipe again. I'm vegetarian so I used vegetable bullion. I'm also not a fan of thyme so I just didn't add it, I didn't have any basil either.  I didn't blend it because I like my soup chunky.

Made it with red cabbage and it turned a pretty purplish color.  Used vegetable broth base.  Blended about 2 or 3 cups and mixed back into soup.  Husband loved it.  I also added couple bay leaves.  Next time thinking of adding more potato and use green cabbage instead:)  I served it with cornbread and family ate it up:)

Wow didn't think this would turn out tasting as good as it did. 5 stars for taste, simplicity, and low calories and forgiveness. Didn't use exact measurements, winged it but came out tasting great. Next time might sub cooked white rice instead of potatoes or do both.

We loved this soup. I will definitely make it again. I did make a few changes to accommodate our needs. I skipped the onion and substituted celery. My husband is allergic to onions so this is not a recipe complaint but a health issue. I also added smoked sausage. The reason I gave this recipe only 4 stars is because it has no protein. Without protein it isn't a complete meal. It really only serves as a side dish.

This recipe is surprisingly good, despite the basic ingredients. I thought there wasn't enough spices, and so included  about 1/2 tsp each thyme and basil, and  it turned out great. I think following the recipe would have been just fine also. I used no salt epicure broth and 1 tsp salt as per recipe, which was plenty. I added some buffalo sausage that complimented the flavours well. Like many others we didn't bother blending it. My family loved it!

Perfect for tackling the CSA box. Used potato and kohlrabi, roughly half and half. Only other adjustment was using vegetable broth instead of chicken because I wanted to share leftovers with my vegetarian friends.

Very good and very easy. I threw in some sliced mushrooms and leftover rotisserie chicken, didn't follow the receipe very closely, and it still turned out great. I would agree with the other reviews, a little thyme goes a long way. Next time I will only put in half of what is called for.

Very easy and very, very yummy.  In fact, I could add very after very it was so good.  I added a half pound of sausage since my husband gets huffy at vegetarian meals and I didn't bother to blend it.  We aren't soup fans either, but I had leftover cabbage and thought I would try something different.  This was perfect especailly since half of our family has colds right now.  I highly recommend this one.

This was nice, quick and healthy. Not fantastic. I added salt as well as nutmeg, but there was still something missing. It fit the bill for my meatless Monday just fine, with salad, apples, bread and cheese to accompany.

I't a week before Christmas 2012. I saw this recipe a few days ago and tonight is my first try. The recipe by itself is ready to go but looking at the reviews it lends itself to adding extras. As mentioned it's the end of December in South Idaho, we have had heavy rain and the ground is saturated and low temps in the 30's. Important, yep! I went out and cut fresh cabbage, both green and red, dug carrots and brought in potatoes from the garden that are in storage. I started with a 14 quart kettle. I cut up 2 cabbages, added about two quarts of potatoes and 2 quarts of carrots. After adding the onion the contents were sitting about 2 inches above the top of the container. I then started to adlib the parsley flakes, basil, pepper, thyme, almost forgot the olive oil, threw in a splash of raw viniger (after reading reviews people were putting in anything they wanted) and that's where I got the splash of vinegar. I added tarragon and cumin. 4 sixteen ounce cans of broth did not come close to the right amount of liquid so I added 3 more cubes of chicken bullion and 6 or 8 cups water until I could see it through the vegies. After cooking a few minutes the volume dropped in the pan so added another head of cabbage, this time the red one and I was on my way. After bringing to boil and then simmer 45 mins was all it took. Prepping carrots, cabbage and potatoes was almost 2 hours but it has been fun, especially using December goods fresh from the garden, but, I forgot the Salt!:)

I may have followed this receipe too loosely since I needed to use an entire head of cabbage from my CSA.  I basically tripled the receipe and thought the taste was pretty bland.  I did not find this receipe "easy" since it was fairly time-consuming to slice all the cabbage and vegetable and then blend.

It was yummy! I ate it as is without blending it up. It is a very light soup. I will put some sort of sausage in it next time I cook it. But great alone!

Great soup!  We doubled the recipe and added swiss chard at the end of cooking since we had it in the fridge.  The flavor was delicious.  We did not blend the soup and am glad we didn't - perfect without.  We also added two leftover grilled veggie sausages for added protein.  We'll be making this again!

Very good.  Low fat, low calories and good fiber.  Next time I will use half the salt.  Using an immersible blender, I left plenty of texture rather than pureeing it.  I see that several people added other vegetables, which I will also try.

Easy. Quick. Fun to muck with depending on what you have about.  Recommend using veg stock.  I stock which was made from cooking up some rutabagas a few days earlier.  Be generous with the pepper.

delicious - didn't have parsley so used Italian seasoning and used Yukon gold potatoes (about 7) - is great alone but will be adding diced ham for a rounded meal, as per hubby it should have ;o)

I followed this recipe exactly and even added more seasoning and it still seemed blah to me. It was OK but I probably won't make again.

This was gobbled up by the kids in no time at all, much to my surprise.  With a little tweaking it turned into a great soup at little cost.

I didn't use carrots and I didn't puree it but it came out great just the same!
