This recipe was awesome!  I did make some of the suggested changes. I used a red pepper, 1 stalk of celery, about 1/4 C. of frozen corn, a healthy dash of cayenne, 4 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp. of cumin. Once done, I stirred in the juice of 1/2 a fresh lime. Also, I salted the veggies while sauteing in the beginning, so I didn't use any more in the recipe. Garnished with sour cream, salsa, cilantro, and finely grated cheddar-jack cheese. We had corn muffins on the side to dip in the soup.  My husband, who is not a big bean eater loved it.  Thanks for the post!

Both my husband and I loved it (and he's not a fan of soups, or beans, or veggies).  My adjustments include:  subbing 1 can of refried black beans for 1 can of black beans, thereby eliminating need for blender.  Used red bell pepper instead of green (YUM), garlic powder instead of garlic, 2 carrots instead of 1, omitted ham because none on hand, added juice of 1/2 a lime.  It was fabulous!  Garnished with fresh cilantro, sour cream, salsa, fried tortilla strips.  Will definitely make again.  This is a very mild version, could spice it up if preferred.  Quick and easy.

Made this the other evening and we LOVED it!  Made it exactly as written but left out the ham.  I ran it all through the food processor, thinking that I wanted a little texture in the soup, but after trying it, I think I'd prefer it being smoother.  Next time I will use the blender and puree it.  It was kind of a weird color and looked a little strange while cooking, but it tasted fantastic!  It was even better for lunch the next day!  Highly recommend!

I loved this recipe!  I prefer a 'smooth" black bean so when finished cooking I pureed it in a blender. It took me straight back to Mexico (where I think the best black bean soup is found).  Thanks for a great recipe.

AMAZING!!!  I added an extra carrot and 1/2 tsp cumin.  Once I added all the ingedients, I used an immersion blender and blended the whole soup.  I served it with cheese and fried tortilla strips.  This is absolutely delicious and will become a regular on our menu!

My modifications included red pepper instead of green, sea salt, 2 stalks celery, 2 carrots, lots more cumin, adobo and cayenne pepper. I also used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.   It was great and hearty and thick. I omitted the ham, sour creeam and cheese because I am vegetarian, I think next tiem I will add tomatos for more of a chili feel.

This was a big hit among my vegetarian, vegan, and meat-eating roommates! Loved it.  I skipped the ham and the green pepper. It reheated very well. I served it with cheddar biscuits.

I have made this recipe several times and our whole family likes it.  I have made it with a can of refried beans instead of blended black beans, and we prefer it that way.  I also add extra carrots and garlic, and pass on the sour cream.

As written, I think this would have been a little bland tasting for me, but it was a very good base to build on.  I added about 1tsp. chili powder, a dash of ground cayenne pepper, 1 stalk of celery, a little less salt & about 2Tbsp. of ketchup.  In the end, this had really good flavor.  My husband wasn't thrilled with the idea of black bean soup, but ate it enthusiastically.  Good post!

oh  man this is soooo good!!!  I left out the ham because I'm trying to eat less meat, but other than that I almost follow this to the letter :).  Left out the cheese entirely, I added a splash of lime juice, some fresh cilantro and diced fresh tomatoes (a must!!!!) and I left out the oil.  I cooked everything minus sour cream, tomatoes and cilantro together and pureed it and then added the tomato & cilantro.  Garnish with a dab of FF sour cream at serving.  Lick the bowl good!!!!  Cheap and healthy and DEEEEELISH!!!  Totally worth your time and a smidge of effort (but not a ton).

I changed a few ingredients to make this lower in salt and calories. I used two very large red peppers, one can of organic black beans and one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes. Instead of ham, I used one package ground turkey that I browned and drained. After tasting it, I did add a couple more spices, like ground california chile pepper, oregano, coriander, a little more cumin, paprika and a little fresh lime juice. I also added one can organic tomato sauce. I threw everything in the crockpot and cooked it on low for most of the day and we all enjoyed this quite a bit. Very cost effective and very filling, with a side of low fat/low sugar cornbread.

This is a favorite of my 3 boys, husband (who hates soup) and myself. I used the exact ingredients, but added 1 extra can of beans and 1 can of diced tomatoes. I didnt puree, but allowed all the ingredients to simmer for an hour (after cooking the veggies) I serve it over rice. Delicious!

Delicious!  I substituted a few things to avoid going to the grocery store.  We had a ton of black beans left over from making black bean burgers the previous night (not canned, they soaked x 2 nights).  After rinsing beans I boiled them in chicken broth for about 30-45 mins.  I think the big hit was that I added lots of chorizo instead of ham and didn't measure but a lot more cumin and some paprika.  We also added celery since we had it.  It was even better the next day.  Next time I will not hesitate to make a huge batch and freeze some or take to a potluck or something.

Really good.  While cooking I did throw in an extra cup of water and some chicken bouillon to extend it.  I used a hand immersion blender to blend most of it and loved the consistency.  Good recipe!

This recipe has become a regular part of our family dining.  My husband and kids all request this.  Like others have suggested, I prefer an extra can of black beans, and use a large onion and bell pepper.  Rather than blend the black beans before adding them to the soup, I wait until the soup has cooked, then use a hand emulsion blender to blend some of it right in the cookware.  As an added benefit - my son doesn't like carrots and my daughter doesen't like green peppper...but when it's blended into the soup and the can't see it...they love it!  :-)   I also like to make this with cornbread, and we have begun crumbling the cornbread right into the soup.  Yum!!

My whole family loved this recipe (even my picky eaters). Because we have 5 kids, I doubled the recipe and added 2 chopped celery stalks and a cup of corn. I used turkey ham for a healthier meat. It was fantastic! I'll definitely make this recipe again.

I left out the carrot and used a red bell pepper instead of green.  Instead of using canned beans I use dry beans that I cook in advance and freeze.  Much less sodium and more economical.  The only thing I would change would be to add the ham AFTER pureeing the soup because the ham shreds and gives it a strange stringy texture.  Very tasty though. Thanks.

This was so delicious!  I used the hints suggested including red bell pepper, tomatoes, a squeeze of lime, cayenne, and refried beans instead of blending.  I also nixed the ham and thereby much of the sodium.  Not only was it fast, easy, and cheap, but nutritional as well.  Truly a keeper!

I used a red pepper instead of green and omitted the ham. Delicious!

Update: Have made this several times. I also add cayenne pepper and a dash of garlic salt. Drain the black beans before adding to soup. Puree all of the soup except a half can of black beans at the end. The carrots will stay unpureed if they all sliced and not diced too small. Garnish with sour cream, fresh cilantro, and green onions. Dip french baguette into the soup and pick up some of the garnish on the way to your mouth. Mmmmmm mmmmmm....Awesome soup!

Thanks for sharing!  I love black beans so was excited to try this.  I followed recipe as stated, though eyeballed the chicken stock and seasonings, and did end up adding another can of beans to make it go further.  I also pureed the whole thing, as I like pureed soup.  Will make again!

This turned out great!!!  I doubled the cumin, and added about a teaspoon of a blackening season mix that I had.  I made this in the morning for lunch, gave my husband a taste and he ended up eating it for breakfast!  This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is very good just as it was written and I am rating it as such.  I do variations for a vegetarian soup by leaving out meat, adding carrots, celery and more (vegetable) broth and cumin.  I reserve half a can of beans and I blend it all together after cooking.  Then I return it to the pot to reheat and then add the remainder of the beans and throw in some frozen corn.

I made this without the ham and the carrots but it still came out really well. I didnt use the cheese or the sour cream either.  It needed a little but more spice, next time I will add the adobo and more cumin per other suggestions.

I made this with low expectations. The ingredients fit what I had in the fridge (used green beans instead of green pepper and I don't use onions). It's delicious!

Dash of cayenne pepper, lime juice, and paprika.  Blend most for thicker soup.

This soup is delicious!!! A basic, easy recipe but sooo tasty! I will definitely keep making it. I have been adding one more can of beans because I wanted it thicker, but after reading reviews, I think all I need to do is puree it all together once it's cooked. Otherwise, it's more liquidy and soup-like. We prefer it thicker.

Wonderful, wonderful recipe.  The aroma in the house was delightful.  I used the suggestion about using a can of refried black beans.  That was a big time saver because there was no clean-up.  I will be making this again soon.

This is a great recipe for left over ham from the holidays! I also cheated by adding an additional can of refried BLACK beans from Trader Joes (2 regular cans, and 1 can refried). Next time I might kick it up a notch with a jalapeno or cayenne. Super easy and delish (pretty healthy too). YUM!

Excellent SOUP!  I made a couple of changes: added cubed ham and substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the chicken broth.  The Rotel tomatoes gave the soup an extra kick and a few more veggies.  A big hit at my house!

This was quick to make and absolutely delicious over some long grain rice and topped with cheddar.  It's also a great final destination for left over roasts and the like.

This recipe was easy & delicious! The only change that I made was that I added an extra shredded carrot. This has to be one of my favorite recipes to date!  I will be making this regularly.

I've been making this for 2 years now and it's a hit every time. I make it vegetarian by replacing the chicken broth with vegetable stock  and leaving out the ham. Spice it up with chili pepper and bump up the cumin and it's a people pleaser.

Fanastic recipes!
Added flour cloves of garlic, extra carrots, two stalks of celery, a tomato, 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne. Removed ham and pureed the soup after cooking.
I even replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth one time to make it vegan, and had to replace one can of black beans with red kidney beans when I ran out and it was still great.

This makes a great tasting bean soup.  I was using another recipe that called for one can of bean soup as a garnish.  As, I did not have it on hand, I was very happy to find this little work around.  It was so easy it felt like cheating.  I liked it because nothing complicated with spices and the refried beans give it the desired texture.  It was so yummy, I will be using it again to combine with other mexcian meals!

I love this! I make a triple batch once a month and freeze it. It works great to pull out for lunch.  It's 5 Weight watchers points per serving (4 servings per batch).. it's filling and tastes great!!

This was great!  I changed it a little..added fresh cilantro, frozen corn, 1/2tsp of cumin, red bell pepper instead of green.  It was tasty but needed a little kick, so after cooking I added some hot sauce.  I think I'll cook some habenero hot sauce into the mix next time.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious! My only modifications were using less oil to saute the vegetables (about 2 tsp.), leaving out the ham (I'm a vegetarian), and adding chili powder to spice it up.

I'd give this soup a hundred stars if I could.  I found this recipe on here and have been making it for years now.  It's great, no changes necessary.  Sometimes I make this using a pack of bacon - just chop it up and toss it in raw- and sometimes I use the cubed ham.  Either way is excellent.  Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Didn't change a thing. Made it exactly as listed. Only I never serve the sour cream and cheese on top. I stir it all in together then serve the soup. Everyone in the house loved it from the 6yo to the 14yo to my bf who is a cook!!! Thank you for sharing this!!!!

loved it. I didn't have black beans in the house, so I used red. I didn't bother to puree as I like a chunkier soup. I added more cumin and more garlic. Thanks :)

Loved this soup - I increased the cumin to 2 tsp, otherwise great as is.  When you put the beans in the blender, it helps to add a little chicken broth.  Will definitely make again.

My family and I really liked this!   I didn't make any changes and found it to be really tasty and filling.   Instead of using the blender, I merely used my stick blender to blend things together right in the pot, which was super convenient.    

I did double the recipe and had no trouble.

Fast & Delicious Black Bean Soup Haiku: "Delicious, oh yes! But I made mine, slow, not fast, made it in crockpot." I put everything but 1 can of beans in the crockpot and used my immersion blender on it for a few moments b4 adding that 2nd can of beans. After 6 hrs. on low, I added a healthy handful of chopped cilantro, and we served it w/ tostones, lime wedges, shredded cheddar and additional cilantro. OHWOWOW, this was great.

Tonight was the first time I made black bean soup and this recipe did not disapoint! I took most of the suggestions and added a carrot to make 2, had 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3, I had a red bell pepper instead of a green, and along with 2 cans of black beans, I added a can of refried black beans and along with cumin added ceyenne pepper and red pepper flakes. Made a wonderful spicy kick. I had no ham on hand. I pureed most of the soup so it would look more appealing to my kids.I just had my kids add sour cream and cheese to over-ride the spice. This is definitly a keeper!

I LOVED this recipe!  My husband is half-cuban, and has been begging for black bean soup, so I tried out this recipe. IT IS AWESOMEEEE!!!! I halved it, as it is just the two of us. I also switched the green bell pepper with about 6 sweet peppers, and the ham with chicken, only because that's what we had. He kept raving about it, that it even tasted cuban! GREAT RECIPE!

Absolutely delicious.  A lot of veggies, healthy too. I did add some home made fried tortilla strips (not as healthy).  Will add this as one of my favorite main recipes.

this is a 4-5 star recipe.  I gave is a 4 just because I changed a few things:  1/2 tsp. cumin,  and I pureed all but 1/4 c. so that there was a little texture to the soup.  It's good!!

We liked this.  Added some refried and skipped the blending.  This was great with tortilla chips, we also had sweet potato fries and cucumber tomato feta salad.

This was pretty good.  I might try it again with some of the suggestions of increasing the cumin or adding a stalk or two of celery.  Although it was good, the Black Bean and Salsa Soup recipe is still my favorite.

Wow! This was my first attempt at black bean soup, and this recipe is a keeper. I took some of the suggestions from other reviewers, and used one can of refried beans and one of black beans, omitted the ham, carrots, and cumin, (didn't have any) and used a chili pepper instead of a bell pepper. I put it all in the blender after I sauteed the vegetables, then returned it to the pot to simmer. I also added lime juice, cayenne, and some tapatio. I am a very picky eater, and my husband isn't a big fan of soups, black beans or anything without meat, but we both actually really liked it! We had it for dinner, then the following day we added some more cheese (mexican blend) to thicken it up a bit and ate it with chips for lunch. Super yummy, our 3 year old even liked it! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Awesome! I only had 1 can of black beans, so used a can of black eyed peas, and used half a regular onion, sauteed with garlic. I also used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of 1.5. My boyfriend loved it!

Amazing soup. Took some of the suggestions posted here and increased the cumin to a half teaspoon and added lime juice. Also, because I'm a huge fan of spicy food, I substituted the green pepper for a jalapeno and added a dash or two of crushed red pepper. Didn't produce as much heat as I would have like, which is ok, since the other eating the meal seemed content with the level of spiciness. If I was to make it again, I may throw in an extra pepper. The meal tasted good, was filling, and is a great way to get in some protein and vegetables. This is likely going to be my go to recipe for when I want black bean soup.

This is the BEST Black Bean soup we have ever tried.   I left out the ham (because I didn't have any on hand) and it was just as delicious without it!  We serve it with cornbread, and a green salad. Very good.

I used 2 cans black beans & 1/2 can of refried pinto beans because it was still a little thin for  my taste. No ham for us, and used cayenne & more cumin. Red bell pepper & red onions were a great addition. Will definitely make again!

FANTASTIC!  very quick and easy.  The only changes I made were adding a shallot, juice from half a lime, a splash of hot sauce, and  a dash of chili powder for some oomph.  I also used a turkey keilbasa instead of ham.  Love it!!!

This is delicious!! Very fast and easy too. I followed the directions pretty closely the only thing I changes was to use a red pepper instead of green, just because I had one that needed to be used. I've used a lot of soup/stew recipes from this website and this one is by far my favorite! I will definately keep this and make it many more times!!

This soup definitely got better over time and the cheese and sour cream on top is a must.  It definitely needs the fat from the ham, although I wonder if hot sausage might be best.

Very good!  I made this tonight with awesome results.  Extremely quick and simple to throw together, and very tasty.  I made a few adjustments:  I added an entire heaping teaspoon of cumin, a bit less salt, and a lot of pepper.  My blender is broken so I couldn't puree the beans but I don't think this was a problem.  Also didn't have a bell pepper or carrot on hand but the soup came out extremely well anyway.  I'm definitely going to be making LOTS more very soon!

5 stars just because this recipe is so versitile.  I used left over shredded pork instead of ham and added an extra carrot and more broth and more cumin.  Really tasty and easy!  Served with the buttery corn bread recipe on this site.

Wow, this was simple and so delicious! I was surprised at how well it turned out, since the ingredients seemed pretty simple. I found this recipe 30 minutes before dinner needed to be on the table and had it done with time to spare.  I used scallion onions instead of green onions and omitted the ham. I threw in a little lime juice. It was great! I'll be making it again and again!

This is very tasty!  I was out of fresh garlic and substituted some powdered once the liquids were added, which worked.  I also used a red bell pepper instead of green and used two carrots.  I bought one can of whole black beans and one can of re-fried black beans, so I didn't have to do the blender part.  It makes the soup even faster to make, plus less to clean!  I don't think any salt had to be added; the chicken broth was salty enough.  But that's my preference.  It keeps well, and the leftovers taste even better.

I have been searching for a black bean recipe that tastes authentic without a lot of effort. Although, there are many recipes that claim to be authentic they are very involved without the results.  This recipe (IMO without the ham) has it all, you can use this recipe or modify to your taste. After trying many recipes, this is going to be my mainstay.  I did double the cumin, used about 1/2c ham (because that is all I had), and about 2 teaspoons of vinegar at the end.  WE LOVED IT!! Thank you sooo much for posting. We served over yellow rice. :)

I've been searching for a black bean soup recipe and I've found it!  This is delicious.  I didn't add the ham simply b/c I didn't have any, but it was great without it.  Good flavor and easy to make.  My search has ended.

Tasted great with homemade cornbread and was even better the next day! I didn't bother putting the beans in the food processor. I just used my submersion blender until I got the consistency I wanted. I also added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up.

Muy delicioso!  This was a great recipe for a nice, Fall evening.  I omitted the bell pepper (hubby doesn't like 'em) and substituted cumin & garlic powder seasoned, bite size chicken for the ham.  Also, I didn't have any sour cream to garnish the soup, but it actually didn't need it and I don't need the extra calories ;o)  The fresh cilantro and regular tortilla chips as the topping was good enough for me!  Will definitely make the recipe again...thanks!

Very yummy. I didn't add the salt and am glad I didn't. The ham added more than enough, and even at that it was more salty than I like. If you add the ham, DON'T ADD THE SALT!

A must have basic recipe. It can be adjusted based on what happens to be in your cupboard at the time, and tastes fantastic anyway. It is easily converted to a vegetarian dish, and a penny pincher side dish on Mexican night using frozen stew vegetables, dried seasonings and bullion cubes.

Not really fast, but very good.  I upped the cumin, and added a 1/4ts of coriander as well as some chipotle pepper.  I skipped the sour cream, cheddar and chips and it was still very nice.

This was very good.  It is a very substantial soup with all the ham in it.  It wasn't quite as fast as I'd hoped, but it was worth it.

I used some left-over chicken tenders (not breaded) instead of ham and a yellow pepper since that's all I had.  It was pretty fast and tasted good.

This was delicious and so much faster to make than most bean soup recipes!  I added one extra carrot, but followed the rest of the recipe.  Yum!  I will definitely plan to make this again.

Great soup and easy to prep.  Only 4 stars as I didn't have carrots or bell peppers on hand.  As with others, I increased the cumin by half.   After it had simmered awhile, I turned it off to let it sit for about an hour, then reheated and enjoyed.  I think it that break gave the flavors time to meld and by dinner time it was wonderful.  Too easy not to be a keeper!

This is a great black bean soup. It's perfect as a meal with a rustic cornbread. I subbed diced green chilies for the bell pepper. I garnished each bowl with a bit of crumbled goat cheese, half a diced avocado, and a spoonful of sour cream. I finished each serving with a dash of ground cayenne. Amazing.

Don't forget the garnish!
There are other black bean recipes on this site and many of them are very similar.  And this soup was very good.  
What made my taste buds sit up and yell in ecstacy was the garnish of lime, sour cream, finely chopped onion and some Asian 'Chile Garlic Sauce'.  
Very well done!

This soup is so so good! I have made it 2 days in row.  I used a yellow bell pepper, 2 carrots and celery. I salted the veggies while sauteing them. I used  3/4 of tsp. cumin, low sodium chicken broth and  added salt & pepper to taste, and Chalulua. I topped with cheese and cilantro! This soup is keeper!

Wanted a non-meat version so I used vegetable stock and no ham. I added diced celery and might also add corn to the bowl of leftovers. Especially good with the sour cream, green onions and cheese toppings. Served this black soup on Black Friday (instead of shopping), might make it a tradition!

I was presently surprised by how delicious this was.  Even my husband, who is a picky eater, complimented it.  I needed to keep it vegan so I used veggie broth and left out the ham.  So good I'm making it again today!

Yummy. Kids enjoyed it too. I did puree it with a stick mixer before serving with some ground chilli flakes.  Very simple, quick and easy. I had no cilantro in house but I will definitly add it next time as a topping.

This is the 2nd time I've made this soup. The 1st time I made it as written. This time I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of refried beans. Didn't add carrots ?? (adverse experience with knife, long story). It cooked up nice and tasted great. I have added it to my favorites and will definitely make it again.

Doesn't look like the picture.  It looks even better.  Made as directed and it was Devine.  My children ages 2, 10, 15, and 17 all wanted more.  The ham is essential to the overall flavor.  If it is omitted, then the taste will be less than perfect.  I will, however make this with half the ham next time.  There was a lot of ham.  Hopefully it will taste just as good.

Excellent soup!  I used a can of refried beans instead of blenderizing a can of black beans, and inadvertently added too much liquid by about a cup.  I used more cumin as I really like it.  otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the taste,  hubby too.  will be making this often!!!  thank you!!

Really good! Came out better than I expected, but I used kidney beans and pinto beans instead of black beans. (Didnt have black beans.) I also decide don't to blend all of it and instead blended about half of the vegetables and bouillon. I also added some Karachi to the pot in order to get a little kick.

Good! But I did add  1/4 cup of quinoa and did not purée the 2nd can of beans., just put them in with the first one. Will definitely make again, but in the future I will double the recipe and freeze in individual portions.  Then ,when serving , add the cheese and sour cream.  (I leave out the sour cream on my husband's and he said it was very good. I, on the other hand, loved the dollop of cold sour cream on really hot soup.)

I made this as a pick-me-up during a bad cold I had this week, and it was perfect!  I left out the carrot and added another cup of beans and pureed all of it until smooth.  I actually pureed it early on and only sauted and simmered half the time it called for (I like things a little more on the raw side), and it was awesome still. Chopped cilantro on the top was great!

I used bacon instead of ham. If it seems like too much bacon then you obviously hate bacon.

Everyone loved this soup although my 3 year old was concerned about eating something that was black ;) I omitted the ham, didn't have any, but I don't think I would add it next time. I pureed an extra can of black beans and I used red instead of green bell pepper. We will be making this again.

OMG-So good! I cooked our Christmas ham bone in 4 cups chicken broth/4 cups water until I could get all the meat off.  Strained the cooking liquid and used it in the soup.  Pretty much followed the rest of the recipe except put all the beans in whole as hubby likes our soups "brothy".  This was delicious!!  I even made Mexican cornbread to go with-YUM!!

Great recipe.  I just added 2 tbs chopped chillies a dash or two of cayenne pepper and some chopped celery to heat it up a bit.  Thanks Floporama, this is a keeper!

We thought this tasted pretty good. Mixing in the sour cream made a big difference. The down side to this dish was its appearance. It looks pretty nasty. My son asked me what color it was and my bro-in-law said it tasted a whole lot better than it looked. I didn't have any ham but used diced chicken and it was fine. I will make this again with the ham and see which we like better. I appreciated that was so quick and easy to prepare and get to the table. I would recommend this recipe just don't serve it to company.

This recipe is very well titled. This went together very quickly and tasted great. I don't eat pork so I skipped the ham but made no other alterations. We topped the soup with salsa a sprinkle of cheese and a dollop of sour cream...this went great with some left over grilled chicken breast from the weekend.

I really enjoyed this recipe; it’s fast and fairly nutritious. I used another member’s advice and used my emersion blender so I could get just the right texture between the beans and the veggies. I mostly made it to take to work by my boyfriend couldn’t resist trying it and he loves it! The only reason why I rated it a four versus a five is there was just too much ham for me. I did use a red bell pepper instead of green. Overall a great easy recipe!! Leftovers are great, one pot can make a several lunches!

A delicious and oh-so-easy black bean soup.  I did not use carrots nor ham, but followed the recipe exactly as is, adding the juice of about 1/2 lime (which, to me, was a critical ingredient!).  Also what makes this soup SO good are the toppings:  I had bowls of sour cream, shredded cheddar, cilantro and fresh salsa for adding as desired.  Simply delicious when all are added!!  This soup is even better the next day.

This was really good! I didn't have any carrots, so I added 2 stalks of celery instead. I used half a red pepper and half a green pepper. I also didn't have any ham, so I just added a little ham soup base. I did simmer it for a bit longer than the recipe called for just because I like my soup to be a little thicker. I mashed some of the beans up with my potato masher too. But the flavor was really good - I'm glad I don't have to search for a great black bean soup recipe anymore!

I am giving this 5 stars for how easy it was and it came out really yummy!  I wouldn't compare it to a slow cooked bean soup that has simmered all day, but it really was good.  I omitted the green peppers and added a can of diced green chilis and I added a couple of teaspoons of chili powder.  This will stay on my list for super quick tasty meals!

Souper easy meal. My 2 and 4 year old loved it. Used 3 cans of beans (blended 2) and used a little celery salt. Added crushed red pepper to my own bowl. Yummy!

I only gave this 4 stars as I did not use all the ingredients listed. I didnt have a pepper on hand so I added some chili powder and red pepper flakes to add heat. I also doubled the cumin and Did not use ham. I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon and extra garlic as we like things garlicky. The recipe is a good base to add your own twist. I did not puree the beans first, i cooked all the ingredients till the flavors came together and used an imersion blender to get the texture I was after.  Delicious, even my husband who normally is not a fan of spice in dishes thought this was tasty. I served with a dollop of sour cream and cornbread on the side for a quick and hearty weeknight meal :)

This belongs in a cookbook! It was really easy and so good. I added some extra cayenne and used crumbled bacon instead of the ham. I think next time I might add an extra can of black beans.

First time I've made this soup and it was well received.  The version made was slightly different than the original recipe.  A green chile (de-seeded and chopped) was added with the other vegetables.  Vegetable broth replaced chicken broth.

This was really good.  I did add more cumin, 1/4 t. didn't seem like enough.  I added approx 1/2-I didn't measure =)  I think I would add less ham next time though.

Really great soup. I changed the recipe a bit, so I can't give it five stars, just because I don't know what it is really supposed to taste like! I used beef consume instead of chicken broth, and I doubled the beans and spices, added chipotle chili powder, plus added a half a can of diced tomatoes. With the rest of the canned tomatoes, I whipped up a fresh salsa to float on top with the cheese. A great and filling soup, this recipe is a great starting point to be creative!

I made this for dinner tonight and LOVED it.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 a tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of salt (i like things a little saltier than most people).  It's a great rainy day meal.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I only needed two servings so I halved everything and it was still very good.  Using just one can of beans, I poured off one half and then used two forks to "puree" the other half inside the can.  I also found myself short on chicken broth and cubed ham, so I cooked up some bacon and then used the grease and some water as a substitute.  NOT the healthiest option, but it was scrumptious!

This was AWESOME! However, I'm giving it 5 stars with my addition of 1/2 of one chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  I also added a tiny potato, minced, that I needed to use up, and I only had 1/2 of a green pepper, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe (I didn't measure the ham, but only used 1/2 lb).  I wonder if the author intended for the juice from the beans to be added?  I drained and rinsed mine, but it made it hard to puree the beans in the blender, so I ended up just adding some of the soup to the blender with the beans.  Honestly, I think it would be hard to mess up this soup.  It's easy, quick & goes great with cornbread & yams (we skipped the toppings, since I think they'd take away from the character of the soup).

This was great.  Quick, delicious, easy and made from ingredients I usually have on hand in my pantry.  My husband even loved it and he is not a fan of ham.  The only substitution I made was using shredded pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar, which gave it a nice kick.  Will definitely make again.

I pureed the broth, veggies and 1 can of beans for a flavorful base, without veggie chunks....then added the 2nd can of whole beans.  3 cloves of garlic was a bit much, so I added a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes with cilantro and lime at the end to cut the garlic flavor. Yummy! (Also omitted the ham).

We substituted onion with scallion and only used one garlic clove.  Also added 2 tsp of lime juice on recommendation of other reviews.  

This is one of my favorite recipes thus far.  It is going in my permanent recipe book to make for guests!

Holy Moly!  This was my first time making black bean soup and this was FANTASTIC!  I doubled the beans and chicken broth and used the refried black beans, which had some jalapenos in them.  I also put 1 tsp cumin, some cayenne, some lime juice, and a little celery.  I put some tabasco in when serving, and put some diced tomatoes with jalapenos and chives on top.  SOOOOO very good - can't wait to make again!!!

This soup was very easy and very good. I substituted dried minced garlic for garlic; one red bell pepper for the green pepper; and used one can of refried beans and one can of black bean soup. It was great with cheddar cheese and cilantro on top (sour cream not necessary). If I made this again, I would use more cumin (1 tsp.) and tabasco sauce for more of a kick. Overall, very good.

Yum.  I loved this soup - very easy to make.  I used an immersion blender to blend the beans and veges prior to adding the ham.  Delish!

Very good and easy.  I followed the tip to use one can black beans and one can refried beans to simplify.  I did not use ham as I wanted a meatless meal, and also added an extra can of broth.  Very satisfying and great flavor.  Great with saltine crackers as well.

Fantastic!  I left out the peppers, cumin, and used chicken instead.  I don't eat this without sour cream and tortilla chips on top.  My husband loves this and he's not a big soup person.
