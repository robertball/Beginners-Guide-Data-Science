My entire Italian family has prepared spinach this way for generations, so this "recipe" is classic. Shallots or onions are a nice touch, but certainly not necessary, but fresh garlic, on the other hand, is. Also,if you're going to be making a lot of spinach, don't add it to the pan all at once.  Add more spinach to the pan as each addition wilts, which will occur rapidly. Substituting butter for the olive oil is not a good idea, as butter has such a low burning temperature. So if you'd like to add butter, do so at the end. This is a simple and delicious way to prepare fresh spinach!

Use a combo of butter and olive oil...add some crushed garlic to the shallots and add some fresh mushrooms...When done, sprinkle with grated parmesean cheese...remember, spinach cooks down to pratically nothing so if you want a lot, you definately need to cook a lot.

Good stuff and so simple! I used a bit of red onion since I didn't have shallots. I also mixed in two minced cloves of garlic and some mushrooms as recommended by another reviewer. Cooked in a bit of olive oil and butter, it was delicious. I made it with lemon garlic roasted chicken and the meal rocked.  Great way to get in extra veggies.

Excellent side dish, next time add a few shakes of balsamic vinegar for a little more flavor.

This was a delicious side dish.  My grocery didn't have any shallots, so I used 1/2 cup of finely diced red onion instead. I was trying to stir too many pots while my onion was cooking and it got a little bit carmelized.  That was okay though, the flavor was very, very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great for a quick and easy side.  I used frozen chopped spinach that I had thawed which worked just fine.

Quick, easy, delicious.  I used oil and butter.  Butter has such a delicious flavor with veggies!  It's hard to go wrong with this one.  Next time I might try pearl onions with it.

It really is fast and easy - and delicious too! A suirt of lemon at the table makes a big difference for me. Since nobody else in my house likes cooked spinach, I had to eat it all myself - lucky me. Next time, I will try adding some garlic with the shallot, but I really don't think butter would add to this dish. I think it would take away from the fresh clean taste of the spinach. Thanks for the great recipe.

I wanted something fast and easy but also healthy and this was the perfect side dish! I sauteed some shallots in a little olive oil with 1 garlic ( I love garlic). I then added 2 bags of fresh baby organic spinach. It took me mere minutes and it turned out delicious. Simple, tasty and healthy. I served this along with my salmon and shrimp tonight.

This is one of my favorite ways to prepare spinach!  My personal preference, is to add a couple of cloves of minced garlic to the pan along with the shallots.  I also hit the pan with a splash of balsamic vinegar right before serving.  The boyfriend likes this best when I top it with some grated parmesan, but it is equally delicious without!

Loved it! used scallions instead of shallots and it gave it a real pop. Made me wish I had made more; I definitely suggest this side.

Good, but next time needs something for a little extra kick.  Maybe balsamic and lemon.  I did add minced garlic, but it still needed more flavor.  Dash of red pepper flakes, maybe?

This was a pretty nice veggie side dish. I made it exactly as written. I've only cooked with baby spinach once or twice before, and I'm always amazed at how the volume reduces so much. My store only sells 6-ounce bags of baby spinach, so I weighed out the proper amount in order to get the proportions right for this recipe. I should add this dish to my recipe repertoire.

Simple and delicious! What else can I say...I would recommend disregarding the cooking time and only cooking the spinach until it's just wilted. It'll only take a minute or two.

I used onion, garlic and a bit if nama shoyu (raw soy sauce) for liquid to help it wilt faster. I served this with Lemon-Pepper Salmon II and it was restaurant quality.

Didn't have shallots so I finely diced sweet onion instead. Also used butter instead of EVOO just because I wanted that taste. Added some minced garlic as well but not too much to overpower the spinach. Super fast and easy. It was only two generous servings but darn good ones. A+.

This was a really delicious way to prepare something so heathy. I used a 10 oz bag of locally grown spinach rather than baby spinach, and thought the ratio of shallots to greens was perfect.

I'm really digging this recipe!  I was burned out on different ways to make fresh spinach and decided to give this a go.  I am SO glad I did!  This is my new favorite way to prepare spinach.  I go heavy on garlic and shallots and use quite a few splashes of balsamic vinegar.  I use WAY more spinach than the recipe calls for and believe it or not, even my kids love this method of preparing spinach.  Great recipe!  My new fav!

This was simple, speedy and yummy.  A good way to jazz up spinach I added a sprinkle of garlic powder to the shallots.  Will make again.  Thanks

Delicious......next time I will double the recipe. I didn't have shallots, so I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in the evoo and added some crushed red pepper flakes, added the spinach, salt and pepper. The spinach wilted nicely and was still so green. Yummy....healthy and so good. Thanks!

So quick, easy and flavorful. I'm the only one who likes spinach in my family, so this recipe is great since I can easily adjust it to make just a single portion.

The shallots are a nice alternative to garlic. They added a nice flavor without the tendency of bitterness from garlic.

This was pretty good for plain spinach. I added fresh garlic with the shallot, but it still seemed to be missing something. Probably won't make this again.

Quick and easy with only a few ingredients.  

One thing was that in the directions, I would put to add the salt and pepper after the spinach has wilted because it's hard to tell how much s&p to add in the pan while cooking.  Also, it might be difficult for some to find shallots (also called eshallots).

I served this dish to guests along with Lamb Chops and mashed potatoes and got rave reviews.  I took the reviewer Honey's advice and added butter, and mushrooms to the spinach and sprinkled with parmesan cheese and it was fabulous!

Superb - made per recipe and sprayed with a little vinegar before serving.  The shallots added wonderful flavor.  And I thought I didn’t like cooked spinach - this will be a regular vegetable for me from now on.

Make sure you like the flavor shallots! It was too strong for me and I did not like this dish at all. I actually rinsed the cooked spinach to eat it so I wouldn't waste it.

Good and easy recipe.  I added fresh garlic, a few mushrooms and a little yellow pepper that I had left over.  Splashed with a little balsamic vinegar at the end, and it didn't last long.

Wonerful way to prepare baby spinach!  I added in some fresh minced garlic and even the kids thought it was great!  I ended up using two whole bags of baby spinch till all was said and done.

I used red onion instead of shallots and it turned out great. My husband said it tasted just like the spinach served at our favorite little place called the pirate house in Savannah GA.

I also press garlic instead of shallots and yum!  This is my new favorite way to make spinach.

Best cooked spinach I've ever eaten. Took lots of your readers advise: added a little butter, didn't have shallots, so used green onions, added a little minced garlic, and when I put it on the plates, added a splash of Balsamic vinegar. This goes in my file to use again.

It was pretty good. I think I overdid the oil a bit, but I was altering the recipe for fewer servings. Less oil and it would have been at least four stars.

Found a bag of spinach in the veg bin that had to be used immediately - found this recipe doing a search and it was great.  I used green onions and garlic powder since that was what I had and it worked out fine.  Real fast and easy as the recipe says.  Thanks submitter.

My Dad and I enjoyed this. I liked how quick and simple it was. I didn't have any shallots, so I used a regular white onion and added some minced garlic. Next time I'd probably use garlic powder, cause I didn't like the texture of the garlic with the spinach, but it still tasted awesome.

What a nice and easy, quick way to get some greens into my meal! I LOVE spinach, and this was yet another delicious way to serve it.
