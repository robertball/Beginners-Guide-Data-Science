This recipe was perfect for what I needed. I used half water and half milk instead of all water. I also cut the salt in half because many reviews said it was too salty. My frosting tasted wonderful!

After reading the reviews, I just put a dash of salt in it and it turned out great. Easy to spread also. :)

I made some changes to this recipe to suit my tastes a little.  Instead of water I added milk since it milds out the powdered sugar.  I added less salt (1/4 tsp).  I also added only 1/4 tsp vanilla and added 1/4 tsp peppermint extract.  It's good

This icing was WAAAYY to salty! It made the cookies taste awful. I had to scrap it off and replace it with a butter icing. I suggest either leaving out the salt or using another recipe for the icing.

I used this frosting with the easy valentine cookies and it tastes fine.  It came out one of the best sugar cookies I've ever made.  I didn't make any changes except it was dry and all you have to do is add a little water at a time until you get the consistency you want or until it is easy to spread as clearly stated in the directions. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe left me very confused! I didn't get anything like a frosting with this. I got hard chunks of confectioners sugar.  The first review said she added 'more milk'.  I didn't see milk on the recipe at all. Was I supposed to add milk?  I imagine that would help. It was certainly lacking moisture.

A simple icing that works well on the Valentine cookies.  You can add sprinkles and just lightly press them in.

Sorry, but mine turned out a gloppy, watery, sugary, mess. I don't know why, but afterward it turned as hard as a rock. Too bad, because the Valentine's Day Sandwich Cookies were delicious!

i used milk instead of water, and omitted the salt as my butter was salted anyways, but otherwise this is a great recipe that tastes delicious!

Worked great as a glue to hold a little heart-shaped cookie on to a bigger heart-shaped cookie (using the Easy Valentine Sugar Cookie recipe), but I was very disappointed in the flavor.  I was apologizing for the taste of the frosting before people would take a bite.

Leave out the salt.  Makes a great icing without it.

Way too thick and horribly salty.  I had to add more powdered sugar and tons more milk (only go 1 tablespoon at a time, though, so it doesn't get too thin) to cut back on the saltiness.  Cookie recipe was great, but next time I'll just use my usual powdered sugar frosting recipe...(with no salt!)

This was WAY too much salt for such a small frosting recipe. I mixed it up according to the recipe and thank goodness I tasted it before putting it on my cookies because they would have been ruined and I was planning to give them away as gifts. I quadrupled the rest of the ingredients while leaving the salt at 1/4 tsp and it turned out ok. I also replace the water with milk.

I thought the frosting tasted a little salty - it was still good, but just a little too much salt.
