I did not care for this recipe. It is easier in recipes where you cream the butter and sugar and then add the flour. The dough didn't turn out right both times I made it. I have tried other recipes where you cream the butter and sugar and will stick with those...they are easier to make and taste better!

My step-mother makes these, and they are fantastic.  She does two things differently than this recipe, which I follow as well.  We use 1 cup butter instead of margarine...I can't stand margarine.  Also, we use 2 tsp vanilla, instead of the 1/2 tsp called for in this recipe.

So Tasty! My mom loved these cookies.  I altered the recipe as suggested and used butter instead of margarine.  I also creamed the butter before adding the dry ingredients and 1 3/4 cups of pecans.  These were delicious!

These could be the best cookies you ever ate - but they MUST be made with butter!!! I've been making this recipe for over 30 years, always with butter - they are a family favorite at Christmas. They literally melt on your tongue. Yummy!!

I am making these cookies for the first time. I am working on my second batch. the first batch was a little tough to make into balls so I cut down the amount of pecans from 2 cups to 1 3/4 cups. Much easier to form into balls. Thanks for the recipe. They taste great!!!!

My mom, and now me, have made these for many, many years.  They are a wonderful butter cookie.  Yes, you need to cream the butter and sugar together first.  My old family recipe calls for a 325 degree oven and bake for 18-20 minutes.  They are light and creamy - dreamy too!  I've actually made some with walnuts as my husband isn't too excited about pecans.  Both are great - pecans just a little bit better in my opinion. I roll in powdered sugar when they first come out of the oven and then after they've cooled, I sprinkle with more powdered sugar.  Enjoy!

If you don't dredge them in the powdered sugar they are just as good and better for you!

They have such a little amount of sugar in them to begin with, even my diabetic husband can enjoy a couple on occasion.

This is an amazingly easy and very delectable cookie! Comes out nice and soft. My only change was i cook for about twenty minutes then let cool about 8-10 minutes before shaking in the confectioners sugar in a large zip lock bag. Only shake a few at a time and make sure to use fresh sugar half way thru coating. Will use over and over again!

simple to make.  very good taste.  I had to cut the recipe in half as I didn't have enough pecans.  However, I was still able to get about 20 smaller balls from half the recipe.

I used softened butter instead of margarine. The dough was easy to mix when I used my hands, difficult with a fork. I bought chopped pecans that were not chopped very well, so I re-chopped them and should have chopped them more. FINELY chopped pecans would be best. Also I only cooked for 20 minutes at a time.. at 25 minutes the bottoms burned.

Funny, its called Pecan "Butter" Balls, with no butter? Found this recipe to be very bland, even with substituting the margarine with butter. It was disappointing to me.

These are easy and delicious. I took the advice of some other home bakers and creamed my butter & vanilla before adding the flour & pecans. I also used 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Instead of just dusting them in confections sugar, I took 6 glazed donuts, toasted them in the oven like croutons, then ground them into almost a dust and mixed that in with the confections sugar. They came out delicious!

I love this recipe especially around the holidays. It makes a nice contrast to all the chocolate and sugar cookies on the plate.  I did make a few changes to this recipe; using powdered sugar and real butter makes the cookie really smooth and melt in your mouth. I have also made it with Pillsbury's Best Gluten Free flour mix for my gluten intolerant friends and it was wonderful! We like smaller cookies that you can pop in your mouth so this recipe made about 4 doz. The recipe does not say but most butter cookies are easier to work with if the dough is chilled 30 min before forming.

Fantastic! Just like mom’s! This is all my husband wants for Christmas, a real classic. I followed Tami’s suggestion and creamed the butter, sugar, & vanilla (definitely 2 tsp). Two cups of chopped nuts are a lot - totally delicious, but don’t worry if you don’t have that exact amount. Finely chopped walnuts are good too.

This recipe is so simple with only a few ingredients but the cookies are so delicious. Everyone loves them.
I also used butter rather than margarine and creamed the sugar with the butter then added the dry ingredients.
I will definitely be making these again.

These are the same cookies my mother used to make; she called them "snowballs".  They're easy to make and delicious.  I used butter, not margarine; otherwise I kept everything the same.  Made a couple of batches for Christmas and everyone loves them.

Not good. Even though they're covered in confectioner's sugar, the recipe didn't call for enough sugar. And I have never before added vanilla to flour, nor will I again.

This is almost identical to a recipe that I've used for many years but now prefer to store recipes online. Changes: I used my Cuisinart to chop the pecans and then added all the ingredients to the bowl to continue the process. They turned out great and just melt in the mouth!

Taste just like my grandmother's, I used 1 cube of butter and 1 cube of margarine. That is the only adjustment I made.
