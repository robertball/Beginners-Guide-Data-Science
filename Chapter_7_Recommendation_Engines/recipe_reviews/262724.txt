Made it exactly as written but did stir the rice, milk, sugar and vanilla constantly to ensure a thick, smooth consistancy.  This tastes out of this world! My mother loves rice pudding but has never made it. We are celebrating mothers day today and she is going to be thrilled. This was my first time ever making rice pudding and this was the right recipe to pick!!!!!

Followed the recipe exactly with one exception; I added the vanilla at the end. Delicious!

Let me start by saying  I LOVE rice pudding. Despite many attempts at making it myself, it sadly, has never turned out to my satisfaction. (Kozy Shack could probably retire on my money alone  I was giving this one more try and found this recipe, had arborio rice in the cabinet and voila- sucess!!. I followed recipe with one change and that was adding vanilla when I added the egg mixture. I do have one question and that is why the heavy cream  The consistency was beautiful before I even added it , and why do you whip it before adding it which kind of defeats the purpose of whipping it sent it falls when you add it to the warm-ish pudding.  I think the next time and there WILL b a next time- I will leave the cream out. Si glad I found this recipe! I'm eating the whole thing by myself and not sharing one spoonful!
