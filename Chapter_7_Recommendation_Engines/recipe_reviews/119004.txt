I have an overabundance of Bailey's, so I used it for the water called for in the mix, then frosted them with "Rich Chocolate Frosting," scaled down to 6 servings, and used Bailey's again for the milk called for in that recipe.  The brownies were incredibly rich and moist...almost TOO moist, actually. Hubby, my taste tester, said he normally doesn't like brownies, but gives these a thumbs up, particularly because of the chocolate chips in the brownies, and because of the frosting. These are fudgey, nutty, creamy...decadent.

I am not sure the title of this fits the end product.  These are not "cakey" brownies at all.  They are moist and chewy and fudgy.  I followed the recipe, but used the brownie frosting recipe from this site instead of canned frosting.  Sprinkled some fall colored sprinkles on the top, and they were a huge hit in the teacher's lounge today.  Thanks for a simple, but delicious recipe!

I hate making stuff from boxes, but a last minute potluck forced me to make some boxed brownies, so I used this recipe to dress them up. They were awesome!  The amount of choc. chips was perfect, so don't add any more.  I also didn't have frosting to put on them, but they really didn't need it.  Try them, they are awesome!

These are the best brownies that I have ever had!!!  I was so happy to find a recipe that built on a package mix and made them even better.  I baked mine in a jelly roll pan for 25 minutes, frosted them with homemade frosting, and used a biscuit cutter to make little round brownie cakes.  They looked beautiful on a platter sprinkled with cocoa sugar and they tasted wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Oh the heavens thank you! These were fabulous!! I didn't have any chocolate frostiong so I took about 3/4 cup of the choc. chips and melted them on top about the last two min -let cool- and oh my!! One thing my WHOLE family does is brownies and believe me they were impressed. Thank you so much. Would really like to try marshmellows and nuts for the rocky road effect these would be the perfect base for that too.

A super easy & yummy batch of brownies! I didn't have time to make a frosting, so I just poured another half bag of chocolate chips on top after I pulled them out of the oven. It made a nice presentation!

These brownies were definitely tasty, but it's hard to find a bad brownie! Canned frosting isn't quite as yummy as I remember it being when I was a kid, so if I make these again I'll try to make my own, but I wasn't exactly overwhelmed with time and it definitely did the trick.  The sour cream is really what makes these different; I do think it made them a bit tangier, but to be honest I'd have to do a side-by-side comparison to see if the tanginess was enough of an improvement to justify the additional fat and calories from the sour cream.  I do think it might have cut the "mix-y" taste and they were definitely moist and deliciously dense.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry, even though I forgot to add the walnuts (added to the icing) this was waay too much chocolate for me.  Not that big a chocolate fan I guess.  It was of good texture for a brownie though.

I'm also one that will use box mixes as a last resort. Needed to make something quick and saw this recipe. I used leftover coffee instead of the water called for in mix. I think the coffee brings out the chocolate flavor a little more. Then  followed as stated. Very good fudgy brownies. A keeper! Thanks for posting the recipe.

This is my go to brownie recipe.  I love that the brownie is not cakey but still very moist.  I followed the viewers advise and used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe in this site.

These were good, but very rich.  I would probably use less chocolate chips next time, but overall these were pretty good.

The whole pan was gone in less than a day. Left out the nuts,but kept everything else the same. My chips sunk to the bottom,so will have to fix that next time I make them(which will probably be later this evening).

Great way to jazz up a box mix. Each time I make these, people think they're from scratch. I combine this recipe with the "Cheesecake Brownies" recipe on this site (I leave out the frosting) and my brownies come out perfectly.

Good recipe.  I made chocolate frosting from scratch (used the dark Hershey's cocoa powder, butter, milk, vanilla and confectioner's sugar).  Makes for a very moist, dense cake.  Thanks for sharing.

OH MY!!  These are awesome.  I left out the walnuts because I took them to our church homecoming this morning and wasn't sure who had allergies.  ( also I used cream cheese frosting).  The sour cream addition really "takes the cake." hee hee

This recipe is perfect for making boxed brownie mix taste homemade. After baking the brownies, I sprinkled the rest of the bag of chocolate chips over the top of the brownies.Then I put the pan back into the oven for a minute, just until the chips looked glossy. Then I spread the chocolate over the top and then chilled until the chocolate was firm enough to cut. Very rich and decadent.

These brownies were the bomb!  I had so many compliments on these & they were gone within 3 hours.  I doubled the recipe & baked in a 16 x 16 x 1 pan.  This one is a keeper & will become a "staple" in our home!  Thank you!

What a wonderful recipe!  Easy additions make these box brownies taste  homemade.
