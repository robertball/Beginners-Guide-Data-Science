i don't like rating a recipe that i have altered, but it was so fantastic i just have to comment. i think the recipe would be great on it's own, but b/c  of what i did and did not have I: used brown sugar instead of splenda, used 3 bananas and 1 c applesauce, added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, i cut back 1/4 c. flour and added 1 c oats, 1/2 c walnuts, sprinkled w/ oats. I made 4 mini loaves. it was a dark pan so I baked for 25 min. perfect.  sooo yummy especially for such a healthy bread.

Delicious healthy banana bread.  I followed others recomendations by using brown sugar instead of the splenda (I don't like using artificial sweetners), 5 bananas instead of 3, 1/2c of applesauce, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg and cut 1/4c of flour and added 1c. oats.  I'm always looking for healthier versions of our family favorites and this is now one of them.  Very tasty!!

WOW! I am not renowned for my baking ability, yet these muffins turned out BEAUTIFULLY. I even made substitutions which I am rarely brave enough to do! I used brown sugar instead of splenda (because I don't like the fake supersweet aftertaste), nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, and substituted 1/2 c. wheat bran for 1/2 c of the ww flour. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg as recommended by another reviewer (thanks!) and added 1/2 c. each chopped pecans and chocolate chips. They turned out stunningly! They were quickly gobbled down. I made 18 medium-sized muffins and baked them in silicone pans, so had to keep them in 5-10 minutes longer than expected (about 30m). They came to 191 calories a piece with my changes, including 6.2 grams of fat (from the pecans, chocolate and flax mostly), 32.6 g carbs (including 17 g sugar and 5 g fibre), and 4.5 g protein per muffin... if you left out the choc chips, -35.5 calories; no pecans = -22.8 calories; splenda = -32.3 calories (per muffin). So you could get 'em down to about 100 calories each, but they wouldn't taste as good :)

I made a lot of changes based on what I had available, and these turned out excellent--super moist & full of flavor.  Here's what I did:  --substituted 1/2c. maple syrup for splenda/sugar
--substituted 1/2 c. peach keifer for sour cream & milk
--substituted 1/2c. hemp seeds for flaxseed (for someone who doesn't like this the crunchy hemp I would rec. walnut pieces).
--substitute 2/3 c. old fashioned oats for for 2/3 of the whole wheat flour
--added 1tsp. cinnamon and 1tsp. vanilla
--used 1 whole egg instead of eggwhites
--baked in toaster over (to avoid heating my already hot house during a souther CA summer!) in muffin tins, 30 mins each tin (might take less time in regular oven)
--yield:  16 muffins

I have played around with this recipe and now use golden flaxseed and whole wheat pastry flour which makes it even better.

I had to make a couple of adjustments, first I didn't have flaxseed so I used more flour I also used stone ground whole wheat flour.  I think it came out great because of the flour I used it had an interesting texture that my husband loves.

I really liked this recipe, however I did alter it some because of what I had on hand and preference. I used dark brown sugar instead of splenda and vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. Plus, I threw in a tablspoon or two or whole wheat germ. It turned out wonderfully. It will make a great quick breakfast on days when I'm short on time.

I know that the changes I made make this more fattening but I had to share because this turned out so yummy. I used butter instead of sour cream and one whole egg.  At least the flax and whole wheat organic flour I used makes me feel a bit better about cheating. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! I really liked this! I used regular sugar, soy milk, the white of one egg, and half the salt, and it still turned out great. It's not a light bread, but very substantial. Nice to bite and wonderful flavor.

These were amazing! I changed some of the ingredients as recommended by others and wow!
Instead of 2 cups of flour I added 1 1/2 with another 1/2 cup of oats. I only had 4 bananas so added some homemade applesauce (just finished the jars that my son didn't eat at dinner:)) added vanilla yoghurt instead of sour cream, added flax seeds (just poured a bunch in), and added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Oh, and instead of sugar added 1/2 cup of maple syrup (I am Canadian after all!)
Enjoy!!!

I'm always looking for healthy recipes so when I came across this one, I was psyched. But the product was just ok. The amount of flax seed added to this recipe made the bread somewhat sticky/chewy. I'd cut back on the flax seed and sub in more whole wheat flour.

My daughters LOVED it!!! The only change we made was substituting Agave for the splenda and extending the cooking time.

I made this last night and it turned out wonderful! However I did make some changes. Instead of splenda, I used 1/2 cup agave nectar. I also used the egg whites of one egg so I probably used more than the recommended 2 teaspoons. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a sprinkle of nutmeg! AMAZING!

This was awesome!  Added the teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, used the whole egg, reduced the flour to 3/4 and added 1 cup of oats.  Threw in a handful of choc chips and pecans.  May put in applesauce instead of sourcream next time to reduce the fat.  Also added 2 scoops of Greens & Whey protein.

I also altered the recipe.  I replaced the splenda with 3/4 cup of brown sugar, used 3 bananas and 1 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I don't like to waste egg yolks so I used two eggs.  Mine comes out a little heavy and my husband calls it Banana Health BARS instead of bread.  We love it for breakfast!!!

I don't normally write reviews, but am very impressed with this recipe. DH & I have made gret strides in making better food choices. Low-fat, low-suger, whole grains etc.  I've really been missing baked goods. It seems that so many of the healthy recipes just don't cut it for me.  Gummy, lacking in flavor. I'd rather go without than have a mediocre banana bread.  This recipe surprise me. It's good! It's really, really good! I will be making again.  I used Splenda brown sugar and added cinnamon & nutmeg per other reveiwers suggestion.  I used 4 bananas (cause that is what I had on hand) and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe.  The bread is moist and tastes like a banana bread should! Even skeptical DH took two slices to eat during his commute this morning.

This recipe is awesome!   I've used it a couple of times, and each time, I alter* it a slight bit based on the ingredients that are available to me, but each time the bread turns out delicious.   Thank you for sharing!  * As others have noted as well: equal parts Brown Sugar  Splenda.   * Equal parts butter  low-fat sour cream  * Whole egg  egg whites  * 1/4 cup oats  flax seed meal (remaining 1/2 cup of flax seed is subbed by whole wheat flour)  * Throw in a good mixture of (crushed) white macadamia nuts, pecans, and walnuts.   * Throw in at the end a good measure of both white and dark chocolate chips.   * AND LASTLY, to top it off: Spread Nutella over to taste - whilst serving.   Probably not so healthy anymore, huh?

The taste isn't bad but the recipe needs a little work. It didn't have the same consistency as bread and have a "rubbery" taste.

great recipe!  followed as written except to add 1 T of poppy seeds and 1 t vanilla extract and made into muffins instead of bread.  This makes a very stiff dough, but it rose beautifully.

The core of this recipe is excellent. The three changes I made was to substitute organic blue agave for the Splenda, 4 (not 5) bananas, 1/2 cup of cinnamon apple sauce, and 1 packet of Stevia.
The result was excellent.  An extremely healthy and fulfilling bread that is good any time of day. The healthy agave is a low glycemic sweetener.  It does add calories, but a good substitute for the questionable nature of Splenda.  Luv it!

My rating is really a 2.5. I made mine following the recipe exactly. Are they as good as regular banana bread? Of course not, they're low fat, low sugar! But they are edible and they did a good job curing my "baked goods craving" without ruining my healthy eating habits. They are definitely not great as is, but this recipe is something I can work with. Next time I will add some cinnamon and vanilla extract...which should help enhance the flavor without altering the sugar/calories/fat, etc.

I think this turned out pretty good. I'm glad I checked it when I did, as if I had let it cook for an hour and ten minutes, I think it would have been a brick. As it is, 45 minutes made it a little hard around the edges.   I used organic cane sugar instead of splenda because I don't like the artificial sweetners, and I also used vanilla soymilk instead of milk because that's what I had. After reading some other reviews I reduced the amount of bananas to three, and I think that was a good choice. If it makes a difference, mine were frozen, very ripe bananas. I think the flax meal gives it a lovely texture and a bit of natural, earthy sweetness as well. I also threw in about 1/2-3/4 of a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips because, why not?! I will definitely make this again!  I'm only giving it a four because the cooking time was way off.

Great recipe! I use 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of the sour cream. Healthier and it tasted just as good!

This bread was so healthy and satisfying!  I followed the recipe almost exactly -- but substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar (don't like splenda) and reduced the flour by 1/4 cup (seemed dry during the mixing.) I can't believe it doesn't have oil, it is so moist.

I've been looking for a healthy banana bread for a while and this one was good and still had a strong banana flavor.  I only substituted brown sugar for the splenda and one egg for the egg white, and it was tasty and filling.  A toasted slice with a little cream cheese on the top was a handy traveling breakfast that held me over for three hours!

Followed the recipe except for I used plain Splenda instead of the sugar blend and I substituted 1 cup of oats for a cup of the whole wheat flour and these came out perfect!!!  I cannot believe how healthy they are! YUM!

I made this  with 1 alteration, instead of Splenda (not a fan of artificial sweeteners) i use 1/2 cup white granulated sugar.  The recipe instructs to bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes yet it took me only half hour to bake this. I find finished product dry. The next time I make this I will be adding more liquid or perhaps apple sauce as some reviewers suggested.

I ended up using the substitutions from angiehdavis as i was short on bananas and am not a big Splenda fan.  These turned out to be very moist, had to cook them quite a while, maybe 35 minutes for 4 small loaf pans. Next time i will use all bananas for more banana flavor.  SO loved this version though!  I liked the addition of oats and walnuts.

Unfortunately this was not good. It was not moist or tasty - kind of takes the point out of eating. Understandably if you want a healthier banana bread you may have to give up some taste but this was too extreme for me and very dense.

The best I've ever made and healthy, too!  I did substitute brown sugar for the splenda and used one cup white whole wheat and one cup whole wheat flour.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Texture was like cake batter. Tasted sweet but looked like a cement brick. I recommend using half the flax seeds and substitute 1/2 half wheat and white flour.

YUMMY!!  I didn't alter this recipe one bit!  Its perfect and LOW FAT/CALORIES!  This bread is so moist and dense, like a regular heavenly piece of banana bread with out all the added calories and lots more fiber!  You won't be disappointed with this one! :)

This is a great, HEALTHY alternative to my mom's recipe (which is still my favorite, but this is a close second). I really liked the nutty flavor from the flax meal and wheat flour.  It was very lumpy and "rough" looking when I spread it in the pan - not like a regular bread batter.  Watch the time carefully - I used a dark pan and ended up decreasing the baking time by 20 minutes.

Very Good!I used 1/2 spelt flour and 1/2 stone ground flour for a little more fiber. I only had 3 large bananas but it still turned out great. I only had splenda brown sugar blend and it worked beautifully. Finally somerthing I can give my 6 yr old, that is tasty and healthy.

I was surprised how good this bread was.  It is perfect for Phase II & III of the South Beach Diet.  I used a whole egg and vanilla non-fat yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Even without any added oil, this is very moist.  This will be a well-used recipe in my kitchen.

Wow! This is a great recipe. I used the other reviewers ideas for real sugar (I used brown sugar) and whole wheat pastry flour (this is wonderful stuff). I added vanilla and walnuts. I went with 55 minutes and then kept an eye on it. This one will be made many times! To the person who said too much flaxseed - Use ground flaxseed. Big difference!!!

This was very good.  I had some flax seed that I didn't know what to do with, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and ground it up in place of the flax seed meal.

These were delicious! I made the 4 mini loaves. They were very moist. I was not sure what flax meal was, so I used flax seeds that I ground up in my coffee grinder. I also substituted Equal for baking, instead of the Splenda.

Really good and healthy.....I used flax seed instead of meal and decreased it a little less than 1/2c. Kept everything else the same, my sister really loved this one. I also used the whole egg white, thought it would be kind of difficult to measure 2tsp of it. Great healthy way to use up bananas! Thanks!

The recipe turned out great and it was easy to make. I used 1/2cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup cane sugar (jaggery/gur) and substituted plain yogurt for sour cream and used 1 whole egg. kids are eating it up. Great way to put rotting bananas back in lunch box circulation and so much healthy flax seed - a bonus!

I thought this was so, so good.  I didn't have any flax seed, so I ground a bit of oatmeal and threw in a dash of vegetable oil.  I did muffins, half with walnuts and half without.  The ones with walnuts I thought were particularly good.

I made some substitutions - and I think that it (greek yogurt 0%%) made it more chewy. I also used 1/2 the amount of milk, and used fat free condensed because it was on hand. Also, I did not use measuring spoons, no nothing was measured precisely. I also added vanilla bean paste I had on hand (sugared but strong vanilla paste) and Siagon cinnamon (that type helps keep blood sugar level) because it seemed people suggested that for a fuller body taste. I served it with Smart balance. If I were making it for a guest, I would have ground up some oats and added some regular bread flour to ease the denseness.

I wasn't expecting much, but this was very, very good!  Just wish I had added nuts--just because I like 'em.  UPDATE:  I've started making this with walnuts, and it's so wonderful that I find myself making this all the time.  I'm almost never without this bread and never get tired of it.

I'm sure the recipe is fine as is, but I used soya milk, apple sauce instead of sour cream (need to use up) and a whole egg instead of just whites, 1 cup spelt flour and 1 cup whole grain and for the sweetner 1/4 cup brown rice syrup. 
Also added pumpkin seeds, cranberries and mini choc. chips.

Delish!  I have altered this combining tips from other cooks and what I have in my kitchen.  So moist and addicting, its better than ANY banana bread.  You feel better after eating it than the regular white flour, sugar loaded stuff I see.  I never use splenda or egg whites- usually maple syrup and 1 egg.  Just BOUGHT browning bananas so I can make it again today!

I am a beginner when it comes to cooking and this was so easy and delicious. I used to make banana bread from the box and this tasted better and was completely healthy. I actually made muffins and they were gobbled up in 3 days! This recipe is a keeper.  The only change I made was I used a natural sweetener instead of Splenda.

To my surprise, my family really enjoyed this banana bread!  I used brown sugar instead of splenda.  I used less wheat flour and added oatmeal, I also used yogurt instead of sour cream.  I made two batches and 1 batch I made mini muffins, the 2nd batch I made the regular loaf.  The muffins were great to eat on the go and just a quick go to snack.  We will be using this recipe again for sure!

Really good banana bread, moist, healthy and satisfying. I substituted, like some others, based on what I had on hand, and used nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream. I also used half the amount of Splenda, since the bananas I used were REALLY ripe. I'm also amazed that there's no oil. Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

Made some modifications and it was delicious! I made cookies out of the mix since I felt like it, but they ended up tasting like they definitely should have been muffins =)

Here's what I used
    * 1/4 cup brown sugar
    * 1/4 cup honey
    * 5 ripe bananas, mashed
    * 1/2 cup vanilla soy milk
    * 1/4 cup nonfat greek yogurt
    * 1 egg
    * 2 cups whole wheat flour
    * 1 teaspoon baking soda
    * 1/2 teaspoon salt
    * 1/2 cup natural instant oats
    * a lot of blackberries!!!
    * a lot of walnuts!!!


Bake on 375 for 10-15 mins
(yes I burned the cookies to the bottom of the pan because I did not grease with enough oil- whoops. but they were perfect otherwise!)

I was looking for a whole grain healthy bread to make while using bananas before they spoiled. This recipe is excellent. It is the first time I cooked with an artificial sweetener and was pleasantly surprised. I also modified the recipe to work as a healthy pumpkin bread. Both have received rave reviews from friends and family.

This bread was really better the second day. It doesn't take that long to cook so I would watch it at about 50 minutes. My top was starting to really crack & burn. I used a mix of Splenda & dark brown sugar. Thanks!

Used the changes from the review below with only one exception- I used vanilla yougert (low fat of course) instead of sour cream...this bread tastes great and is very healthy for you...especially good for helping to lower cholesterol as long as you don't soak it in butter!

YUM!!!   I am a caterer so I do ALOT of cooking and baking. I followed this recipe exactly....and it is by far the best banana bread I have ever had.  I may add walnuts when i make it again....it is so delicious.  I had a hard time convincing my son (a chef and exercise nut) that it was a healthy, whole grain low fat recipe. Thanks!!!!

I wasn't terribly impressed with this recipe.  We didn't even eat the leftovers, if that is any indication.  I know there have to be better whole grain banana bread recipes out there.

Very nice flavour and texture. I added some cinnamon and vanilla, which gave it a little zip. (I meant to add some walnuts, too, which would have given the bread some crunch, but I forgot.) I also used one whole egg instead of 2 whites, brown sugar instead of Splenda, and only 4 bananas (that's all I had). The only problem I had was that after about 50 minutes in the oven, the top was very browned, but it was still slightly undercooked at the bottom. Next time, I may try reducing the oven temp to 325 and maybe substituting a 1/2 cup of the whole wheat flour for white flour. But it's a great basic recipe and I will fool around with it some more!

I have made SEVERAL banana bread and muffin recipes, and this is by far the best! I must admit it tasted even better after cooling. I substituted organic vanilla yogurt for sour cream, and organic brown sugar instead of splenda. I also (being a chocoholic added a handful of chocolate chips and walnuts) My family LOVED it!

This was a great recipe. I subbed in regular sugar as thats what I had on hand. Also added some mini choc chips, chopped dated, and chopped spinach to the mix. It came out wonderful and I managed to sneak some extra greens into my husband and toddler! :)

I made this because I wanted to try Truvia in a recipe.  This is not as good tasting as the sugar filled banana bread but for someone who wants to keep their insulin level in check the taste of this was pretty good. I was surprised at how moist it was. I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon as one reader suggested.

i don't like bananas, only in smoothies and baked so i decided to bake the ones i had in my fridge because no one was eating them and i didn't want them to waste. i love the recipe except i was wondering are they supposed to come out thick and chewy like? i was hoping for fluffy crumb muffins, but not one crumb. i followed the recipe to the tee. they not like in the picture at all. :(

The only substitutions I made were that I used organic cane sugar instead of Splenda, used all white flour instead of wheat simply because that's what we had, and used unsweetened almond milk in place of skim milk. Baked at for just over an hour, pulling it out about 7 minutes early because the top was browning. Very moist and delicious. My husband loved it too.

I substituted plain nonfat yogurt for sour cream, and a cup of protein powder for a cup of the whole wheat flour. On my second attempt, I made this into 12 muffins. Through much trial and error I eventually got a great muffin, but had to make a lot of changes.

What a great recipe! I did as others suggested ( I am not a big fan of cooking with Splenda either) and used brown sugar. That was all I changed. This is a heavy, moist bread, which I love.  My 11-year-old likes it (bot is not crazy about it) so that says something too. I feel like I am having dessert! Thanks Eileen for a great recipe.

Basically it was gross. I followed the recipie, a few adjustments i used brown sugar instead, 1/3 cup walnuts, bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, 1 cup flour 1 cup oats still seemed too wet after adding all wet ingredents. So i added a few tablespoons of wheat germ and bit more flour. i used 4 bananas approx. and low fat yogurt instead of sour cream. anyway it was still wayy too mosit when it came out of the oven i tasted some... it tasted SO BAD!! it was like gooey flour no flavor besides the od walnut i put in myself. Defintely adjust before attempting. i know other people have used just 1 cup oats and 1/4 cup flour ... so i dont know what happen to mine ,any suggestions much appreacaited.

I made this recipe and  angiehdavis' version of the recipe. The original had a strong banana flavor (I used three large bananas) it was good but  angiehdavis' version was a lot more moist with less banana taste (this version also took longer to bake and next time I would double the cinnamon). Both versions were very heavy, and this is why i rated it 4 stars. Next time I will use the original recipe and add baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe a 1/2 cup of applesauce.

This bread was pretty good. I was a little skeptical because the mixture seemed dry due to all the milled flaxseed. After an extra spoonful of sour cream it seemed ok. I wrapped it and let it sit overnight before slicing into it. My one year old loves it!

My kids and I loved this bread after a few modifications. I used less milled flax (1/4 C), 4 bananas, and 3/4 C applesauce. I used 2C whole wheat flour as the recipe calls for, but then I added about 1/2 C quick oats, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg as other users suggested. I also added about 3/4 C chocolate chips. It had a lot of flavor and is one of the best healthy banana breads we've had!

I altered this recipe a lot based on the suggestions and what I made tasted so good I had to share! 1/2 cup maple syrup, 3/4 cup flax seed, 4 bananas, 3/4 cup apple sauce, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt, 1 regular egg, 1 3/4 wheat flour, 1/4 oats, 1 tsp. Baking soda, 1/2 tsp. Salt, 1 cup walnuts, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 cup dark chocolate chips, 1 tsp vanilla. Oven at 350 for about 30 minutes ( I used 3 small baking tins instead of 1 large one) SO GOOD! By far best banana bread I have ever had and So much more HEALTHY!

I only had 3 large bananas so I added more apple sauce but it wasn't as moist as it should be. I would make sure to have 5 bananas for this like the recipe calls for.

These are excellent. My kids ate them up quickly. I used several others suggestions to make mine. I used regular sugar (about 1/2 cup) plain yogurt for sour cream, added applesauce and left out the flax seed meal. This will be a recipe I will use many times. Healthy and tasty.

Delicious - I added about one teaspoon cinnamon to the dry ingredients and the kids devoured it by the pool. Great recipe!
