These are great... but you will enjoy them more with a little help. There is a LOT of sugar here, and that carmelizes when it bakes, so if you overbake these they become hard as a rock when that sugar solidifies on cool down. Watch carefully, and these may seem a little raw when you pull them from the oven. Walnuts ruin these, IMO. Skip those and use shredded coconut instead. Even if you don't like the flavor... it bulks these up and helps retain the moisture and keep these chewy. YUM!

I love these!  I substituted 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips for the nuts and they're gloriously chewy.

Good, but they dry out fast. 32 bars out of an 8x8 in. pan? You're kidding... I don't serve brownies (or for that matter anything else) in pea-sized portions. The recipe makes 9 normal-sized brownies.

I am NOT allowed to make these anymore!  I couldn't resist them... I had doubled the batch because I didn't have the right size pan (made them in a 9x13) and I finished them off myself in 3 days.  I told my husband (who liked the flavor but doesn't like sweets) to not let me make them ever again unless we are going to some sort of gathering or potluck.  They were fabulous!

I'm finding these brownies quite hard to rate. I'm hovering between a 3 and a 4. 4 because I'd just got home from vacation, had very little baking ingredients and wanted a dessert for dinner and these fitted the bill perfectly. 3 because I was disappointed with how thin they were. I used the right size pan and followed the directions exactly, but it could have been something I did. Finally I've decided on a 4 because they tasted good and had a great chewy texture. I will make these again but double the mixture and cook them longer. Thankyou.

I baked for the minimum amount of time, and I didn't have any problem with the sugar carmelizing.  They turned out nice and chewy.  I loathe walnuts, so I replaced it with another 1/4 cup flour.  These brownies aren't overly sweet, so if you're looking for more flavor, I bet throwing in a few butterscotch chips would perk these up!  Good recipe overall!

These are fabulous! I just loved them! This is a recipe that doesn't call for a bunch of ingredients so they can be made in a pinch. I was sure not to overbake them, I only put them in the oven for 18 minutes and they are PERFECT! I will make again for sure!

Would give it more stars if I could! A wonderful change from regular brownies....sinful! Definately double the recipe and increase the vanilla to 1T.  I used 4 oz of butterscotch chips and 1/2 C caramelized walnuts.....Definate keeper and hard to resist eating the entire pan by yourself!

I took these to a bridal shower at work and I got so many compliments - the words "divine" and "amazing" came up.  Easy to make with a minimum of ingredients, they are the perfect treat to bake on the fly.

delish! but did change the following things to give it more of a true butterscotch flavor to my palate: doubled recipe & baked in 12 pie plate so sliced it looked like a torte. ingredients: melted butter on stove top and dissolved all sugar in it...gently stirring it to brown it just a tad...letting cool then adding the eggs - tempering them so as not to cook them.  Added 1/2 tsp salt...even though I used salted butter I felt it balances the flavor and increased vanilla to 1 tablespoon for the double batch...adding extra tbs of flour....and 1 cup of chopped pecans!  was a knock out ....warm drizzle of cream....few berries! sit back and enjoy the smiles it brings!

This is definitely not a recipe I would make again.  I absolutely love butterscotch, but I did not care for these.  I donâ€™t think they have a butterscotch flavor at all.  They just taste like sugar.  They were very hard and crunchy on the outside and too gooey on the inside.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I would not recommend this to anyone.

I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, used organic coconut oil and chopped the walnuts instead of grinding. My husband ate 1/2 the pan while I was on the phone (I'll take that as a compliment).

These are wonderful!!! They DO taste like butterscotch!  I did make a few changes for the better: I substituted the ground walnuts for 1/4cup chopped walnuts to retain the moisture.  I reduced the baking powder to 3/4 t. I also paid close attention to the cooking time. I cooked them for 24 minutes (I am at high elevation). They may look a bit undercooked at first but they will harden as they cool down.  Also to test the level of sweetness I made two batches, the first with 1 cup of sugar and the other one with 1/2 cup. My husband and I thought that with 1cup of sugar the brownies taste wonderful, like a butterscotch candy. With 1/2 cup it is fluffier and lighter but a bit bland. Next time I will try 3/4 cup of sugar and I think it will be perfect. I really had to control myself not to eat the whole batch!!!!!

These were very easy to whip up.  We added a handful of chocolate chips to make things interesting (probably half a cup) and it was a sweet addition.  I left out the walnuts and added flour to make up the difference, but I think it detracted from the chewiness. I'll try it without the extra flour next time.

These turned out amazing.  I love the chewy light texture.  I added some butterscotch chips that I crushed to the dry ingredients.  I also added a little more vanilla than what was recommended.  They were yummy!!!  FYI They are thin but thats not a big deal to me considering on the number I will eat!!!

I have no idea what happened but the outside looked awesome when they came out of the oven, but the inside was complete sugary mush. The whole thing had to be thrown out. I followed all sorts of suggestions to thicken the mixture, but apparently it didn't work for me.

Very easy and turned out great.  I baked it in an 8-inch heart pan.  My knife never came out clean, but after it cooled, it was the perfect consistency.

The recipe is delicious but makes so few brownies. I would recommend making a double match and omitting the nuts for choc chips.

Pretty good.  Will add about 1/4 cup more flour next time and switch to bread flour so they are more chewy.  Left out the nuts and topped with butterscotch chips.  Do watch your cooking time as there is only one minute from done to over done.

My mother used to make these years ago.  They are excellent.  I used melted butter which added a little bit more flavor, and doubled the recipe then baked in a pie pan to make the brownies thicker.  I serve them warm with vanilla ice cream.  They are wonderful!!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

So, I didn't follow this recipe very well at all. I melted the butter in a bowl and added the sugar (I used light brown sugar) and half an 11 ounce bag of butterscotch chips, stirring until they melted. I beat the egg and vanilla together slightly, then stirred it in to the butterscotch stuff. Then I dumped in all the dry ingredients and stirred it together, and baked in a 6x6 greased glass pan for 25 minutes. I let it cool covered in foil. It fell in in the middle as it cooled, but tasted delicious. I gave this three stars because it's almost a different recipe - I'll try it as written tonight and re-rate.

Super easy AND ingredients that I almost always have on hand! I did add some dark chocolate chips to this - and I think I will try some semi sweet next time.

As simple to prepare as a boxed mix yet better tasting!  My kids gobbles them up before Dad was home from work!

i feel there is something missing with this recipe. It is not like a brownie at all.  They were flat and boring.  I followed the recipe exact.  Not a recipe i will try again.

I am a Firefighter for MiamiDade Fire Rescue and I made these for my firehouse. I doubled the recipe. I only had " I can't believe its not butter" and was a little nervous baking with it, but it came out great. I also used 1/2 bag of butterscotch chips, omitted the nuts and cooked it for 25 mins. I sifted powder suger over it after it cooled. I also used parchment paper for baking so I could pull it out and have less to clean. The firefighters filpped out loving these brownies. We had a drill a two in the morning where we trained getting a person trapped out of the metrorail and they made me make more brownies for after the drill!! These are a new Firehouse 12 favorite!

Suppose it's my turn for a recipe to fail inexplicably.  Made it exactly according to directions and these just didn't turn out.  More like baked caramel sugar.  We had to throw them away.

I was craving something sweet and decided to make these. They are soooo delicious. I didn't put the walnuts in this time but I plan on adding them when I make them again or I may add pecans instead.  They are very chewy and not too sweet. Love this recipe.

I, too, added coconut--very yummy & went over well at the office pot luck. They were a little more moist in the middle than I usually like, so the coconut helped.

Unless you have amazing dental insurance - you're not gonna wanna make these. (I'm positive after the one I tried, I now have about 16 cavities). For the second time in my life, I have to say something is "TOO SWEET."  Used Butter flavored Crisco, nixed the nuts and used Butterscotch chips, and added a splash of oil...otherwise the same.  These took an eternity to bake, and by the time they were only "set" in the pan - the outsides were pretty hard and crumbly, with the inside very ooey gooey. More like a "cookie bar" than a brownie...

These were not that great.  I probably won't make them again.  They were too flat and were not thick enough for me.  However, they would work if you were really wanting something sweet to eat but only have the basic ingredients on hand.  That would be the only time I would ever consider making them again.

I used to make butterscotch brownies from a cookbook of my moms. These tasted just like those brownies. I'm not a nut fan, so I left out the walnuts. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to perfection.

Great recipe!  It is easy to make with ingredients usually on hand.  They even cut well and stay looking nice for cookie platters.

I've made these twice now.  Both times I had to bake longer than the 24 minutes. Neither time did I use ground walnuts. These are ok but I won't be making a third time.

I couldn't find my butterscotch brownie recipe from a friend, so tried this one. It was close to mine, but didn't nail it.  Recently I found the recipe I had been looking for. Everything is the same except instead of shortening, mine calls for 1/4 c of real butter. This makes a big difference!
(and you will always want to at the very least double this recipe! It does not make very much)

These are delicious!! SOOO chewy!! The only thing I will do different next time is double the recipe and put it all in one pan. They came out very thin and I want them thicker. Other than that they are awesome!!
