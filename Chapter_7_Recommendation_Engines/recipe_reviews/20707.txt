This is great...very easy to make and everyone raves!  I changed it slightly by substituting 1/2 of the sour cream with 2/3 a stick of cream cheese.  I found that this keeps the dip from getting too soggy with the sour cream.  Also, I occasionally add chopped lettuce, tomatoes, and onions before the cheese layer.  Thanks for sharing!!

I love this recipe...I omit the  guacamole and add cooked chicken or ground beef to make a whole meal.  I also like lettuce and green onions chopped and sprinkled on top.  I make individual plates of this and serve it with chips or warm tortillas.

Good stuff. Tastes just as good with fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese. I like to add sliced black olives on top too.

I served this recipe at a party and everyone loved it!  It's very spicy because of the taco seasoning which makes it stand out compared to other mexican dips.  Instead of jalepeno peppers I chose to use green peppers. -Sheila

A real hit.  Made it for the superbowl game.  Makes a LOT.  Might want to cut in 1/2 or make two containers.  Everyone loved it.  A keeper

I changed a few things and it turned out really, really well.  First I didn't have any bean dip, so I added 1/2 of the seasoning to refried beans.  The other 1/2 I added to the sourcream. I also added a layer of salsa which I think is a must!

I'm definitely keeping this recipe around to make again! I wanted a quick and easy layered dip that involved guacamole and this was perfect.  No baking, no meat, and after serving it at my New Year's party there was absolutely none left!  The only thing I changed was using black olives instead of jalapenos, but still had great flavor!   Love this!

Didn't do much for me & was way too salty.  I am glad I tried this out at home alone because I would have been embarrased had I served it to guests.  There are so many other good Mexican dip recipes out there I see no point in trying to fix this one.

I like to add in a can of corn, ground beef, sliced olives, sliced onions and even a few frest roasted green chiles....these give great texture and taste! This is one recipe you can taylor to fit your tastes without really messing it up! I like a lot of 'junk' so I rate it 3....really its a great recipe but based on your taste.

Very good recipe.  I did make some adjustments.  To me, refried beans are very bland.  So I stirred in a small can of chopped jalepeno peppers into the beans before spreading them into the pan.  I topped the sour cream mixture with cheese and that was it, I didn't add the other toppings.  Very yummy!

A GREAT dip, I made two of them one with all the fixings and one with the bean dip,sour cream & taco season and cheese for those who are more picky. It was a big hit. Served it with Frito chips and corn tortilla chips. Defiently the best bean dip ever. Very tastey and spicy

Very good!  I added sliced olives, green onions and canned jalapenos that I diced and seeded. I like the taste of the bean dip versus the canned refried beans. Will make again!!!

I added seasoned ground beef and salsa rather than tomatoes.  The salsa may have made it a bit soggy - I won't do that again.  It was good enough for me at home, very tasty, but I would not make this for a crowd.  Thanks for the recipe.

An entire packet of taco seasoning seems a bit much.  I might scale it back a bit.  I also added chopped olives and red peppers on top.

This was a real hit with my family. I left out the avacado ( my family never was too crazy about it)and instead of jalopeno peppers, I used zesty yellow ones and threw in some black olives for good measure. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Made this for a small movie get together. It disappeared entirely. I added a few spices etc. to make it my own, but all in all a great recipe for parties or munchy occassions.

Bean Dip (not refried beans) is the secret to the best seven layer dip ever.  You know the kind you dip Fritos into, yes Bean Dip, excellent!

About the only thing I like to add to this is jalapeño peppers because I like a little extra heat.  You can add or remove ingredients according to personal tast.

I have made this for several years for our super bowl party. It is always a big hit, never any leftovers! The only change I make is I also sprinkle  some sliced black olives and sliced green onions  over the top.  Yum!

This is a great recipe. I left out the guacamole because my family doesn't care for it. My friend makes this recipe and she uses one can of refried beans and 1/4 c. taco bell, taco sauce. She also uses green onions on top and grape tomatoes cut in half to make the dish pretty. I've also made it with 2 tsp. of tobasco sauce in the bean dip. It is a great recipe. Will make again!
