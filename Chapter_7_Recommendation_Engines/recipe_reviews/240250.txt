This works perfectly for a light night snack. I used garlic powder instead of salt and halved the amount. Perfect! Thanks for the recipe.

I used garlic salt and a little pepper. It was fantastic.  My 4 & 5 year old love it!!  We make it at least once a week.

Kudos to the mom who says her kids love it. I personally LOVE vegetables, but could barely eat this recipe. I guess I expected it to be at least somewhat crispy somewhere but it was pretty mushy. Maybe I overcooked it.

This was a yummy way to eat cauliflower! I used olive oil and mixed a little bit of melted butter for flavor. Spices I used were garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. I roasted at 400 but it took longer than suggested in recipe. I roasted it for about 30-35 min total tossing twice to get all sides roasted. Then I sprinkled a little white cheddar popcorn seasoning on. My kids loved it and so did 3 other neighborhood kids!

My kids won't touch it but my husband and I love this! He has me make it all the time. It's delicious as is but I like add a little bit of white pepper and turmeric as well. Thank you for the recipe!

My boys give it a big thumbs-up. Not crunchy, just basically roasted. I did shake-and-bake with olive oil and spices, good and easy! I used Italian seasoning, doll, garlic, pepper. You could easily add chili powder or paprika to kick it up if desired. Yum!

This was ok for roasted cauliflower, but I don't see why it's called popcorn. It was soft, not crunchy like other cauliflower popcorn I've had.

I used coconut oil (because of a restrictive food sensitivity diet) and garlic salt.  I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower, but this recipe was easy and pretty tasty.  Will definitely make it again.

This is so yummy!
I just tossed the cauliflower in olive oil in a gallon ziplock and then poured them out onto a cookie sheet 
Sprinkled them with garlic salt and then baked until they were golden brown (I turned them halfway)
Note:
Eat them up right away cause its not good microwaved the next day

Used a 2 pound head of cauliflower. Four cloves of garlic grated, some chopped onion, oil, salt, and sprinkled on turmeric. Baked 16 minutes. Maybe I had too much cauliflower? Not much flavor.

I used sesame oil instead of olive--omg yum! Some of the cauliflower browned and it turns crispy just like popcorn!  I'm impressed! This is definitely going to be a vege I'll cook more often!

This was great for my weight conscious friends. The roasting took a little longer, I just stirred occasionally for even browning. Adding some tumeric and other spices made it tasty.

I followed directions exactly.  I'm not a fan.  Didn't have much taste and didn't brown well.

Definitely a keeper.  It's a great starting point to add your own preferred flavors.  I like the Indian spiced cauliflower popcorn available on this site, but my children didn't like the turmeric flavoring.   So I've both kept it simple and made complicated  flavor combinations; it's all about what you and your family like.  The basic recipe here will let you find a way to add cauliflower to your diet.

Easy and good! My kids prefer this over their microwave popcorn now! We tried it with a little melted butter and garlic powder.
