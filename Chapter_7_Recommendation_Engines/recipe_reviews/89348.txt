Whoa. Holy sweet drink. I cut back the half-n-half to a 1/4 cup. This one's a sipper, not a throw back. Good, but way sweet.

Made a few alteration because of a lack of ingredients--used bailey's ice cream (haagen daz), a bit more regular (light) rum instead of spiced to make up for the lack of bailey's, and the amaretto and coffee liqueurs...definitely in the cordial category, but a nice sweet treat, almost an adult milkshake!

I was out of light cream so I mixed heavy cream and skim milk to make up the rest of the drink.  That all being said, this drink tasted quite good, a nice change from my usual fare.

Awesome! I recommend using the ice cream over the half and half. The alcohol flavor is pretty strong in this and the sweetness helps balance it out a bit. Drink enough of these and you really will think you can move things with your mind.
