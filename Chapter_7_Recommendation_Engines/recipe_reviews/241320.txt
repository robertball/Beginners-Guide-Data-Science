This dish makes a beautiful presentation. I would recommend making sure the indentation is large enough to contain the egg and I would be generous with the cheese as it tends to get lost with the other ingredients. I used American cheese which was very good but I would increase the amount the next time.

The flavor was good but who can fit all the ingredients into a 3-1/2" roll? The egg white ran all over the edge onto the baking sheet and was just a mess. Hubby ended up digging the contents from the center of the roll and eating with a fork and spoon. Will be deleting the recipe from my "recipe box" on this site.

A real crowd pleaser. Next time I will get slightly bigger rolls and/or smaller eggs; it was a bit of a challenge to get the whole egg to sit nicely in the roll on top of bacon and cheese. Perhaps putting the egg in the roll first and then adding the bacon and cheese halfway through cooking might help. Crusty rolls need a sharp serrated type steak knife. I'll be making it again!

As a non-foodstylist I would say my photo turned out pretty fair. I used hamburger buns from the bakery. If I made again I would use a sweeter roll maybe Hawaiian. Be sure to make a hole bigger than 1 inch I just ripped out some of the bun insides and that seemed to work but was a balancing act on the way into the oven. I baked for 25 mins and then 5 mins more for the bun tops but the bottoms burned a little and the egg yolk started to set. 15-20 minutes and then 5 more mins with the bun tops would be better.

The concept sounds delicious the execution is a different story. I used Kaiser rolls and even so the ingredients were a tight fit and the egg just didn't cook right.
