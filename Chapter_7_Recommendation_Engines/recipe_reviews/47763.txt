The idea of a mustard BBQ sauce really only hits home in South Carolina and Northern GA. It is very popular down there and is what I grew up on. This recipe is a little different, we use apple cider vinegar and less honey

This is a great base sauce or paint for pork, especially ribs or pulled pork sandwiches.  My personal taste leans towards something with more bite, so I add a hint of Worchestershire saucea, garlic powder, cayenne and chipotle pepper.  The smoky flavor of the chipotle really accents the mustard/vinegar base!

awesome recipe!  we decreased the honey and brown sugar a bit, increased the vinegar, added garlic, ginger, paprika and a splash or two of vodka and poured a double batch over a large shredded pork butt and served it over rice.  it was better than the best mustard bbq we had in the 12 years we lived in SC!  SO excited to have this recipe!  We have missed it since we moved!

In the cooking process I added 1/3 cup finely chopped yellow onions.. It seemed to round out the flavor.

My fiancee was stationed in NC for years and this took him right back to his days in the Marines! I served the sauce over a pulled pork sandwich (made from loin) with toasted bun and carolina slaw on top! You made me look like a star! Color and favor were spot on! Thanks!

This is so quick and easy, and it always impresses.  I've started adding black cherry juice concentrate to give a nice fruit flavor depending on the dish this is being served with.

We have only had mustard based barbecue sauce a few times and never liked it much. This easy and tasty sauce has changed our minds. I used it on baby backs and YUM! I am going to try it with a little mayo to make a salad dressing and it would also be wonderful to dip chicken tenders in. Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe. This goes into my winner file!

I doubled the recipe, but cut down on the honey some as I wanted bbq sauce and not so much a honey mustard sauce.  Otherwise, the only change I made was to add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.  Great base recipe, and a wonderful way to cut expenses- it is amazing what the markup is on bbq sauce (and this taste just as good)!

THIS IS IT!!! This sauce is awesome, great with smoked pork butt, ribs or chicken. In fact, I’ll be barbecuing tomorrow and serving this sauce with it. It’s a perfect blend of tangy and sweet – the only change I made was the addition of a half cup of minced red onion. Definitely worth trying.

I have been searching for a diet-friendly bbq sauce (because of allergies I can't eat nightshade plants, i.e., tomatoes/peppers).  Being from Alabama this has been hard to do!  I love vinegar so increased that, and for the "kick" I miss so much, I increased the black pepper and added garlic/onion/and whisked in a few dollops of Wasabi paste.  Thanks!!!

This was really good! I added a little dash of hot sauce to it, just personal preference, and used apple cider vinegar because that's what we had. It was very good on chicken, and we also used it on sausage sandwiches with peppers and onions and it was awesome on those too. Thanks for a great (and simple!) recipe!

Yummy. Thought I would try it as my husband and sons don't like a very sweet sauce. I made "Sweet and Savory Slow Cooker Pulled Pork ". After removing the pork and pulling it apart,I returned it to the crockpot, mixed the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl, and added it to the crockpot and mixed it well. Very tasty!

There is a BBQ restaurant in East Tennessee called Pratts. They have a sauce called Carolina Gold that is fantastic. This is way better if you add the Worcester sauce, garlic powder and a little Chipotle hot sauce. Too bad I can't give this 6 stars!

My daughter made this under my supervision for a large group as a side sauce for pulled pork. We followed the recipe exactly, doubling it; however as an oversight, we didn't actually cook the sauce like the directions say to. We did warm it in the microwave for about 30 seconds just before serving. I personally thought it was good but a little too much like honey mustard, but many of our guests said it was delicious, and my husband agreed with them.

I did this last night and added red pepper flakes. I poured it over two large pork steaks,cover with cling wrap and baked at 175 for 6-8 hours. It turned out wonderfully.

I tooke ChristieSC’s suggestions for authentic SC flavor and it was a huge hit! I made some pulled pork in a slow cooker using this as a cooking sauce and my neighbors praised it as the best pulled pork they ever had. It was really quite delicious and I’m fixin to make some more!

Added a little onion powder and garlic powder.  This time I didn’t have any honey so I doubled the brown sugar.  And a little cayenne.   I’ve made this a lot and it’s a fantastic sauce as is but also a great jumping off point to make it your own. This one is not as tangy as some I’ve tried and I liked it much better.

This is a fine SC mustard BBQ sauce  but its basic set of ingredients leave the resulting sauce a bit flat. Don't get me wrong, it is a good sauce, but other sauce recipes seem to offer more depth. As a native South Carolinian (and SC BBQ blogger), I have spent a lifetime trying variety of mustard-based sauces, both at the restaurants I review and recipes I try. Bottom line, this sauce won't steer you wrong and, let's face it, pork and mustard-based sauces were meant for one another!

I made the adjustments other reviewers made but I found it a little too spicy, wish I had used the full amount of brown sugar. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this sauce. I used it on a pork loin I smoked to make  a Cuban pork burger. I added a bit more brown sugar (1/4 cup more).  Will definitely make again!

This is a good recipes for a sauce that's hard to find in the Pacific Northwest. I love mustard on everything, so adding a tang to my BBQ is exactly what I was hoping far. I made a huge batch of this!

Solid recipe to start with, but you'll need to play with it a bit. Try subbing champagne vinegar, Dijon, and dark brown sugar... It's roughly what I use to impress my SC upcountry inlaws.

I was looking for something a little different for some pulled pork and boy did I find it! I followed the instructions exactly and all I could taste was vinegar. So, I tried adding some things from the other commenters to try to salvage it. I.e.worsheshire sauce, extra honey, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder. I only added these a little at a time, mind you. But nope, nothing helped. It left a nasty taste in my mouth from beginning to end. Maybe I'm just too used to the ketchup based BBQ sauces. Although I love honey mustard... This tasted nothing like it. Anyway, it doesn't hurt to try new things!

Excellent recipe for Southern Mustard based sauce. I, however, add 1/4 to 1/3 Cup of Dukes' Mayonaise after the sauce has simmered. This adds body and richness in my opinion.

I live in South Carolina and love mustard based sauces. We forgot to pick some up for pulled pork sandwiches tonight so I threw this together. Very quick and easy, took no time at all to get it ready. It was a bit too sweet for my liking. Husband loved it, as did the kids.

I love mustard and vinegar, so this was perfect! Delicious on chicken. The only changes I made were: spicy brown mustard because that's what I had on hand, and I added some onion and garlic powder.

This is very, very good! I changed the recipe just slightly by reducing the mustard to 1/2 c. and keeping all the other ingredient quantities the same for a bit of a sweeter sauce. I served this was shredded pork. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This sauce is the bomb!  I put boneless pork ribs in the slow cooker, added sliced onions and dried cranberries, then covered everything with the sauce and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Yum! Definitely a keeper!

The best BBQ sauce ever.  Everyone I've made it for Raves about it.  The first time I had this sauce I was in South Carolina visiting my Girlfriend. I add 1/2 teaspoon of Liquid smoke!

I made this sauce for a pork loin, and although it was good, it's a bit too sweet for my taste. Otherwise not bad.  I expected it to be too "mustardy", but it mellowed well.

I did make some changes.  I cut the mustard ti 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of bottled bbq sauce, and it was very good and easy.
