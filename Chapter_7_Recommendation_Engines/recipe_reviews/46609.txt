Just edible. Not worth a second helping let alone making again. The combination of flavors, and particularly the cilantro, just didn't work here. Hubby said the cilantro with the green beans was an "unnatural act."  I expect more from a dish with so many ingredients in the seasoning. Once again, this dish proves simple is better.

Absolutely delicious. The red wine vinegar adds the perfect amount of "tang." I didn't have red onions on hand so I substituted dried, minced onions and it came out fine.

It was 2004 when I first reviewed this recipe.  As suggested by others  added bacon, and sauteed the onion and garlic in some bacon fat.  I'm still making them, I have two kids now and this is only 1 of two vegetables they will eat!

This is the first time I leave a review (shame on me I use this site all the time) Everyone loved these green beans, I was pressed for time so I used french cut green beans, cooked them completely and added all other ingredients as per the recipe except the chicken broth (I did not want a sauce )my cousin - as he was serving himself again- kept saying how he just did not like green beans.  I've read comments like this before and never got such results, but this time I did!  Try it! The vinegar, sweet taste of the red onion and bacon just make it a great side dish, I've made it twice in the last two weeks because my husband asked me to!  HE DOES NOT EAT VEGGIES!

I used white onions cut in rings & skipped the boiling step.  I prefer my veggies with a little texture to them.  I sauteed them for about 8 minutes covered and completely ignored them the whole time.  These were the best green beans I have had in years!  Thanks for the recipe!

BTW, I forgot to mention, they aren't Georgia Green Beans as in the American South, but rather, from the country in Eastern Europe.  Sorry about the confusion!

Ran acrosss this recipe and after reading the reviews, I figured if the non green bean lovers,  such as Dreginek liked this dish, it must be good. I'm not a big green bean lover either, so I decided to use brussel sprouts instead. LOVED IT, LOVED IT!!!! I plan to try this with other vegies too. Thanks Sara!

These made a great vegetable.  The red onions sauteed almost gave it a sweet taste.  The cilantro (which I love anyway) was the key.  My husband suggested we add real bacon bits next time.  I cooked the beans longer than the recipe called for.

oh, yeah... I would have sworn Southern green beans had to be loaded with animal fat, but these were quite good.  I used a minimal amount of a low-fat butter substitute instead of butter, and couldn't help but be impressed by the flavor of one of our new healthy sides.

Very easy and very good.  I cooked the beans a little longer though as my family prefers the beans a little softer.

Awesome!  I substituted veggie broth for the beef so that my vegetarian friends could enjoy it as well and they loved it.  Even those that are not green been eaters enjoyed it.

In my opinion there was nothing spectacular about this dish. The combination of flavors was just ok to me. I used red onions and a little fresh cilantro. I didn’t think the cilantro worked in this dish especially with red wine vinegar and seasonings. The red wine vinegar was slightly overpowering and didn't blend too well with other seasonings. There was a slight sweetness but lots of tanginess throughout the dish and thou it was edible I most likely will not consider making this again. Because everyone else in my family liked the beans I ended up giving this a 4 stars. I served this side dish with, “Herb-Crusted Chuck Roast,” and “Sally’s Spinach Mashed Potatoes,” all from this website.

This was ok.  I'll try again but boil the beans a little longer than 3 minutes because I like them tender.

Very Good. My whole family ate the green beans all up. No leftovers in this household. Very healthy and tasty, plus the fresh green beans made the meal better rather then canned gren beans.

Very good recipe, particularly if you are looking for an alternative to cooking with a ham hock.  Mom thought these were the best fresh green beans recipe she had ever had.   This one stays in the recipe box.

I thought these were very good, but my husband LOVED them.  In fact, I had one serving and he ate the rest with dinner - getting 2nds and 3rds.  I didn't find them as flavorful as I'd have liked, but he sure did.  So, I will be making these again - obviously!

Since the garden produced sooo many green beans, I am in search of ways to use them up! Although I still am not a huge fan of green beans - this was pretty good - even for me (although I'm still not fully converted)! My daughter loved them ~ but she likes green beans no matter what. Thanks Sara - believe it or not - I WILL make this green bean recipe again!

These were rather sour tasting, and the vinegar (or perhaps the 15 minutes of cooking time) changed the color of the green beans to a dull, unappealing shade. The taste of cilantro wasn't perceptible at all. Nobody at my house liked them.

It might have had something to do with my preparation, but I didn't care for this recipe.  It was rather bland, and the green beans were oily.  I might cut the butter in half next time.

These were pretty good!  I made in olive oil instead of butter for the health aspect.  Next time I will use more red onion and more cilantro.  I love cilantro and the flavor didn't come through as much as I hoped.

I can't put my finger on it but something just tasted off in the flavor combination.  My husband, on the other hand liked it. But I won't be making it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It had great flavor and all of the ingredients were things I would normally have in the kitchen.  We'll make this again.  Thanks!

Pretty good green beans, I liked the tangy flavor the vinegar gave, but not the flavor of the cilantro. I don't much like cilantro, but keep trying to acquire a taste for it since so many foods I love have it in them. Hubby ate these up and there were no leftovers.

I made this on 2/24/17,  following the directions assiduously.  My wife and I decided that it would be better next time out to steam the beans, so they'll be fully cooked. That's because I have no dentures and cannot crew practically raw beans.  We tried to cook them tender at the tail end of the process,  but they burned and ....
I've rewritten the recipe to  suit my dental requirements.  The recipe, as provided, sounded heavenly.

Tasty side dish with barbecue, but if vinegar gives depth to flavor. Very easy to prepare. Will be a regular on our supper table.

These beans are so flavorful. Don't change a thing! My husband and I both loved them. Plus, they only count as 1pt per/serving on the weight watcher program. I will make these often!

I thought the taste was delicious.  I accompanied this with the Baked Pork Chops recipe from this website (the one that has like 400 reviews and is a five star) and I added Uncle SoandSo's Wild Rice.  My boyfriend said thumbs way up!

This dish is delicious and fools proof!  My 9yr old daughter loved it and had seconds and she doesn't really like green beans and my husband was very pleased of the flavor combos as they are similar to common ingrediants in the home we use all the time.  I loved it and thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I followed one reviews advise and simply pan fried all the ingrediants together to keep the beans crisp.  Yummy!!!

I used frozen green beans and once cooked added them to the sauce and served.  I did not have chicken broth so I just used water and the green beans were still delicious.

These were good green beans! The only complaint I have is that I really couldn't taste the cilantro at all... maybe next time I will double it.
