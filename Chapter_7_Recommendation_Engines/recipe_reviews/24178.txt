This recipe is different, but good. I used tortillas instead of lunchmeat. Would love to hear some other variations.

Tried this recipe and couldn't even eat it.  The pickles overpowered everything.  Had to add another 8 oz of cream cheese and ham slices within the roll to cover taste. I think I will stick to my traditional recipe even though I love all these ingredients separately, I didn't like the combination.
