Fantastic recipe! i loved it!
I changed the recipe to my likings though.
I sauteed the garlic with dried italian seasoning then i added the onion until is was soft.
I then added fresh tomatos and dried chili peppers and simmered it until it looked more like sauce.
I added the pasta and mixed. Made this three times in the past month. I LOVE IT!

I make a version of this at home; but I just use a can of Rotel (tomatoes and chili peppers) to decrease a step.

Very good. I was surprised that the sauce did not come out to cover the pasta very well, but it didn't really matter once we started eating - the taste was great. Just the right amount of 'kick'. Great blend of herbs and spices.  This is a great dish to try out whole wheat pasta. The sauce/herb mixture will overpower any taste you dislike associated with whole wheat.

I thought this pasta was too dry and not all that spicy.  I made it as per the recipe, then decided to add another can of diced tomatoes along with some crushed red pepper flakes and some curry powder.  We ate this with shredded grilled chicken, and I think my husband liked the chicken better than the pasta.

I used half a chile pepper and no hot sauce, and my face was burning for hours afterwards.  Guess I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness :)

Tasty! I used Campanelle shaped pasta since I had it on hand, and red chile powder because I didn't have the chile peppers. Same thing, really. I didn't season with salt and pepper, but the end result has quite a bit of flavor, so I didn't miss it. Great last minute meal idea using convenient staple items, thank you!

Good! In truth, not that spicy (but I think thats more personal taste..) So I added a lot of hot sauce haha Its very filling. Yes! to me it seemed like to much onion. BUT. its all necessary. (worth the tears). Its really wasn't all that I expected that it would be, but its a lovely quick dinner. I look forward to making it again :)

Made this as directed, except for the red chile peppers.. I couldn't find any. Also added half a can of drained black beans. I just really didn't find it very tasty, and probably won't make again.

Loved it! Use frozen, diced poblano peppers instead of green chiles. Very delicious! Would be great with chicken added for a meal.

I have been making this for years and I love it - but I am not sure where you eat that calorie count from. There is NO package of 12 oz rotini anywhere that will yield that small amount. I did the math on My Fitness Pal using the regular calorie info and it comes out to about 200 calories per serving.

Throughout the process of cooking, I learned new things and ways to prepare things. I found it easy to follow because it was straight forward. The final product turned out better than the professional picture but the taste wasn't as right. If i was to alter the ingredients then i would probably change the spices and add some cheese. The spice to me didn't go right with the pasta. If i did the recipe again I would take out the Spices. The final product looked fabulous. I would only recommend this recipe to people who like spicy food, because we left a lot of people needing water...

Very good. I made this very spicy and we loved it that way. I did have a hard time finding the chilies, however.
