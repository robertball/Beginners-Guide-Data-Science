10.29.19 Spent the day doing yard work, and just wasn’t up to doing anything too involved for dinner and too lazy to even go out for dinner. Looked in the freezer and found some roasted garlic chicken sausage, so knew that was going on the grill. There were some cooked apples that I made yesterday sitting in the fridge, so I wanted to style up this simple meal with a nice (and easy) side dish. I had some fresh asparagus, always have Israeli couscous in the pantry, a nice fresh lemon, and then I remembered I’d saved this recipe to try in the future. It was absolutely perfect for this simple meal, and on its own, is very easy to make. We like our asparagus crisp tender, so I wanted to be sure not to overcook it. It will cook a bit more from residual heat when mixed in with the hot couscous, so just be careful to not overcook (nothing worse than mushy asparagus). The shallot adds something a little special, the lemon zest and juice brightens the flavor, and just takes it over the top. Thanks for sharing this really tasty recipe, it definitely deserves a 5-star rating!
