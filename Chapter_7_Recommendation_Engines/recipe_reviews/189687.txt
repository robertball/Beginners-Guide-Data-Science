This is my recipe and I forgot to put down 4 cups of granulated sugar in the ingredients. Blend the sugar with the other two ingredients.

I soak the seeds and nuts separately for 8 hours to improve digestibility and then dry them (I don't have a dehydrator, so I lightly pan roast the sesame seeds just until they start to pop and dry-roast  the walnuts in a 325 degree oven for 10 minutes, then cool both before grinding the seeds and chopping the nuts. Then I mix the two together and sweeten the mix with raw organic honey and roll into balls for a delicious dessert. (I understood that honey is the preferred sweetener for this traditional and therapeutic Chinese recipe, rather than white sugar, and I think it improves the taste and nutrition). Delicious recipe--thank you so much for sharing!
