Absolutely delicious! I wanted a thicker crust so I increased 1 1/2 times the crust amount ( 1 1/2 c flour, 3/4 c br sugar, 3/4c chopped walnuts and 3/4 c butter). I finely chopped up 2 c. of fresh strawberries and sprinkled 1T of white sugar over the strawberries  to help make it more sweeter and release its' red juices. Next I whipped up 1 c. of heavy whipping cream adding lemon juice and sugar. When I folded the strawberry mixture into the whipped cream, its' juices made a pretty pink color. And when I poured the filling over the crust it made nice pink and white swirls throughout the filling. I froze this dessert for at least 8 hours before cutting into it.  Once frozen solid I had no problem cutting into the squares. I placed a dollop of homemade whipped cream from this site,"Sweetened Whipped Cream". This dessert makes a pretty presentation with flecked strawberry bits in the pinkish hue filling. The strawberries are definitely sweet and juicy. The filling itself is light, fluffy and creamy. I like the crunchy toasted walnuts in the crust as well as the topping. It adds a nice texture to the dessert. It is not too sweet -just right. The crust ended up being the right amount for this size dessert and I am glad I increased the amount. We all enjoyed this cool and creamy dessert. Frozen whipped cream blended with chopped strawberries and topped with a crunchy walnut topping, is a refreshing and perfect way to end a hot, humid day here in Hawaii!

I made this the other night to have after a lobster feed. It was light and delicious, and I am making it again today for a family bbq. I changed the ingredients a bit the second time, as I am using Cool Whip to keep the calories down, so I used a half cup of Splenda instead of 1 cup of sugar in the egg whites, and it is just as good, with a lot less calories.

Easy and quick to make and tastes good too!  I used 1 cup extra creamy cool whip in place of the whipped cream.  Only thing I would change is to chop up my strawberries a lot more the next time.  I "sliced" them like the recipe said but I didn't like biting into a frozen slice of strawberry.  Even tho you let this sit out for 10-15 minutes, the berries are still frozen.  I'll try cutting them into smaller pieces next time.

Excellent dessert!  I actually grew up with this being a staple summertime dessert at my grandmother's house. My recipe is slightly modified to use cut up fresh strawberries and mix with egg whites, sugar and lemon juice using hand mixer until peaks form. Also, to cut fat even more, we always use Kraft Dream Whip, prepared as directed on box. Prior to serving in individual portions, I always garnish with fresh strawberries. Delicious summer treat!

Wonderful childhood memories of my Grandmother bringing this delicious dessert to family gatherings. However, she would never give anyone "her" recipe! Thank goodness for allrecipes; I now have the secret recipe! I am surprised that no one has commented on the safety of using raw egg whites. I would substitute powdered egg whites.

This is delicious.  I made the crumbles with almonds and pecans because I don't like walnuts and it turned out awesome!

This was delicious, but it was WAY to sweet. I cut back almost 1/2 of the sugar and it was still too sweet. Will probably make it again, but will cut back even more on the sugar. I added extra strawberries too. Will probably add double the strawberries next time.

Delicious and not too difficult to make.  I chopped the strawberries into tiny pieces and I replaced the walnuts with oatmeal because my son is allergic to walnuts and it turned out very well.

I am diabetic so to make it healthier I added some oats to the crust. And used 1/2 c Splenda vs the sugar and used a can of mandarins and blueberries I has on hand with whip cream vs heavy cream. It was fantastic!!!

I made this tonight and it was pretty good. I will definitely make this again. Next time I will make a couple of changes. I will decrease the sugar to about 1/2 cup because a whole cup was way too sweet and Also make extra for the bottom crust to be a bit thicker.

I have made this twice for coworkers birthdays everyone seems to like it. I don't have a mixer so doing by hand is a pain in the rump but otherwise its a very easy to make.I did follow the others advice and doubled the crust part and I also did 1+ 1/2 on the filling cause the first time I made it it was kind of flat for a 9x13 pan. I also cut my strawberries small as well. It comes out nice and gives a good presentation. I myself am a more chocolate person but it is a good dessert. I like to changes things up a bit. I might even try this with blueberries next time.
