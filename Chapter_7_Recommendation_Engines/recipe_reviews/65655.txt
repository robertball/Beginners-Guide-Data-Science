I mashed a couple tablespoons of butter into the sweet potatoes and used butter instead of margerine for the topping I mixed a 1/4 cup of oatmeal with the brown sugar and added a handful of chopped walnuts), and added nutmeg and cinnamon. Other than that, I kept everything the same. Simple but oh, so good. TIP: Use fresh squeezed orange juice with just a tbsp. orange juice concentrate stirred in. It's lovely.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was delicious.  There was a lot of orange flavor which I really enjoyed.  The only change I made was that I boiled the potatoes instead of baking them to save some time. I will make this again

Very nice. I boiled the potatoes and didn't have any orange peels, but I quite enjoyed the result!

Love this recipe!  Substituted butter, microwaved the potatoes for about 15 minutes.  Cut a slit lengthwise in each cooked potato and used a pair of bent tongs to peel the skin off.  I used a mixer to make everything super smooth.  

I transferred the mixture to a small round corning ware dish.  To top it off, in a bowl I crushed three cinnamon graham crackers, added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and about three tablespoons of melted butter.  I mixed everything till it had a meal consistency and then sprinkled it on the potatoes in the corning dish.  

With the oven at 425 degree F, I baked the mixture for five minutes, just to get everything golden and crispy.  

Result:  YUM!

Great recipe! A couple of things sweet potatoes have much more flavor when baked. You lose flavor and nutritional value by boiling. If short on time microwave to get them started and then finish off in the oven so the heat does it magic with the natural sugar in the sweet potatoes they taste so much richer. We like it better with butter.

I boiled the potatoes to save some time. I also added a 1 cup of brown sugar for a little extra sweetness. Next time I wont add as much orange juice, it made the potatoes thinner than I like them.

The only thing I changed was upping the orange peel to 1 tsp. However, I used small sweet potatoes, so it came out soupy. I baked them for about 20 min to dry them out a bit, which helped the texture. The flavor was great. I think if I had used larger potatoes, I may have not thought the dish was flavorful enough.

YUM!  I used honey (from my brother's bees!) instead of brown sugar, butter instead of margarine, and I scaled the recipe for one big sweet potato.  : )  Also, added just a pinch of salt.  Delicious!

Really good!!! I did cheat and "baked" my yams in the microwave using the baked potato option. Cut down my cooking time a lot. I used real butter also. Served as a side to glazed pork chops. I will make again.

Very tasty dish that I was able to make ahead for a busy holiday meal
