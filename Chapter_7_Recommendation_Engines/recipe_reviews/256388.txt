I used 1 C buckwheat flour, 3/4 C whole wheat flour.  Also added 1 TBSP cinnamon and ground espresso!  Left out the syrup, added 1 TSP each of maple and vanilla extracts.  It is incredibly good, I love it and will make often.

After 2.5 hrs in the oven this bread is still wet in the middle. I've made many recipies on this site with success, but I  do not recommend this one. Very disappointing to waste perfectly good ingredients.  I do like the flavour though. It might work with half the apple sauce. Don't try this.

I will absolutely make this again! I added 1/4 tsp ground allspice a full tsp of cinnamon (instead of 3/4) and used 1 tbsp fresh ginger instead of powdered. I also cut the maple syrup in half. I baked it for 50 minutes but I might bake it for a little bit less next time. I added 1/2 tsp extra virgin olive oil to my slice after it was finished cooling. I loved how big the slices were when I cut the bread into eighths! I typically cut my bread into 12 or even 16 slices but this was still a relatively low-calorie slice even though it was so thick!
