Oven Roasted Sweet Potatoes Haiku: "Yay, no marshmallows! Savory sweet potatoes, glad that I found you!" Super easy recipe and delicious; I left mine in longer, stirring frequently enough that the sweet potatoes browned evenly, but my onions were a little burnt and shrivel-y, which is my bad b/c I didn't cut them into wedges, as directed. I did follow the recipe, other than apparently being a little too dainty w/ my onion cuts. Wow, these were terrific, and how nice that they weren't bathed in brown sugar or some other sticky sweetness. I squashed some of the leftovers (sans onions) for the baby, and she said "gurgle blurgle /smile" as she devoured hers too.

I omitted the balsamic vinegar (husband hates it) but kept everything else the same. It was DELICIOUS and easy to make. I like that it is a savory sweet potato recipe with few ingredients. It's definitely on our favorites list!

Didn't even peel the taters and it turned out so yummy! I would've posted a picture but... all that's left is a blob of olive oil. Caticalic, tell your Granny she's a genius :) Husband says these are the best sweet potatoes he's ever tasted!

Excellent! I made a few changes making this for Christmas dinner: I used 4 potatoes and did not measure how many cups. I used white balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any regular. I slicedabout 1/2 C fresh cranberries in half and added them. Also added about a half cup of chopped pecans. It was delicious & was a nice substitute for sweet potato pie.

We were in a bit of a hurry so I put the potatoes and onion in a microwave safe container with a bit of water and covered for 10 minutes.  Then we mixed in the olive oil and garlic and spread potatoes on a cookie sheet and sprinkled with Mrs. Dash.  We then baked for 15 minutes.  I was AMAZING!!!!!

Wonderful way to cook sweet potatoes, not sure why people want to sweeten them up with brown sugar and marshmallows, that's just not appealing to me, they have such a nice sweet flavor on their own.  I like this savory rather than sweet recipe.  Although I didn't  have a vidalia onion, I used a regular yellow onion and it worked just fine, got kind of caramelized after baking for 45 minutes.  These go great with pork chops.

Really good !
Only addition I made to the recipe was to add a little thyme to it.
My wife couldnt believe there was no honey, syrup or sugar added, the sweetness was all natural and healthy ingredients :)
I broiled it for 2-3 minutes at the end just to caramelize the sweet potatoes a little and get a nice crisp on them
Will make this again for sure!

This was a real nice change from my usual mashed sweet potatoes. The sweet onion combined with the sweet potatoes was really good.  I made it on a hot day, so I put the ingredients in foil and cooked it on the grill, about 35 minutes.

I made this according to the recipe. It was very good but I have a tweak in mind that I'll try the next time I make it. Next time I'll use a little more oil than the recipe calls for and salt/pepper before I put the potatoes in the oven. It's a good, easy dish though, and will definitely be making it again and again and again.

I tossed the potatoes and onions in a large gallon zipper bag with the EVOO to make sure everything was coated well.  Love this recipe!

These sweet potatoes are YU-MMY!  Mine were a little burnt at 35 minutes but I missed the direction to turn them frequently!  BE SURE TO TURN THEM!  (Unless you like crispy-burnt on one side)  I crushed the garlic and added it after the oil so it dispersed throughout and added salt and pepper both before and after cooking.  The balsamic vinegar after cooking takes them over the edge! I will definitely be making these again.

Simply delicious! Although I don't like it when someone changes a recipe...... I did add garlic Rosemary seasoning after making it as written 2 times. We did like it much better with the change. My wife says its like eating real potatoes not sweet potatoes.

It was tasty, but way to oily.  I plan to do it again, but half the oil.

This is a year round option for a healthy dish! I had grown tired of the standard annual sweet potato casserole style dish. This was a refreshing change! The sweet onion created a perfect balance with the vinegar. Awesome!!

I was skeptical going in, but HOLY  this was good! I am 50 years old and I have never EVER known sweet potatoes in ANY form without cinnamon and/or sugar.  Even when I have sweet potato fries I dip them in something sweet.  So imagine my surprise about this dish! Love it! Oh, one thing; I did not use the vinegar.  When I took them out of the oven I started eating them and did not make it to the vinegar! Also, I left the skin on.

We loved them. Made them per recipe. They were not baking to my satisfaction so I took them out of oven and finished them in a skillet on the cook top with a little butter, they were great. Will make again.

I had some sweet potatoes left from another meal and wanted to use them.  I found this recipe, and had all ingredients on hand, so I made it.  The house smelled wonderful while cooking.   My 11 year old grandson was drawn by the aroma, and hung around to try some.  It tasted great, I will make again!

I don't usually write reviews, but this recipe is amazing! I had a couple sweet potatoes left over, and I just used a regular onion, but the sweet and savory flavors go together SO well! I don't often cook with sweet potatoes, but I'll be making this more often.

Great recipe for a side dish! Paired it with a crispy garlic chicken breast recipe on this site and it was a perfect pairing. Used minced garlic and cut the onions & sweet potatoes in big chucks (don't skin them, that's where all the nutrients & flavor are!) and they took a little longer than stated & weren't as crispy as I imagined but still really good. My picky family

Super easy and delicious!  Don't be afraid to double EVOO, garlic, etc for a larger quantity of sweet potatoes. I also added about 10 minutes to the baking time!

Very good! I didn't use the vinegar, I added a couple of bay leaves and rosemary (dried because I didn't had fresh, next time I will). It was very tasty and aromatic. I will make it again!

Great and easy recipe.  I put some extra onions in it and used a garlic press for the garlic.

It was a really simple, yummy side dish.  I forgot to turn them so some of them burnt on the bottom but other than that they were quick and tasty.

These were just ok. You have to toss them a lot to keep them from burning. The salt and pepper didn't stick well when added after - may need to season before putting in oven. I have made better versions of roasted sweet potatoes.  I made with shallots which are lovely when roasted.

Excellent and healthy recipe. Don't peel the potatoes, or you miss the fiber and vitamins from the skins. You barely know the skins are there when eating. Next time I would try adding the garlic just the last few minutes because they burned cooking them the 30 minutes. 
So good having sweet potatoes without a lot of sugar and or butter.
Line the pan with foil or parchment paper for easy cleanup.

This was so good and simple that it will be my sweet potatoes go-to for some time. The only change I made was a grate or two of nutmeg.

Oh, and I did find out that a sweet onion was a vidalia, that I think could have been said. And a Walla Walla which I never heard of.

I make these often in my air Fryer... they are so good! I  often season with cumin and chipotle seasoning for a kick off flavor instead of the vinegar... so easy they take about 20 minutes... stop and toss or stir a couple of times

I've been trying to find better ways to eat sweet potatoes than covered in brown sugar and butter and this is absolutely the best dish I've had yet!  The kick from the balsamic sealed the deal.  This is getting repeated verrry soon.

I made it using the exact ingredients but changed how I cooked it.  Since I only have one oven, I couldn't figure out how I could bake a turkey at 325 and roast sweet potatoes at 425. So I roasted them the day before when I was baking pies.  I baked them only 20 minutes, allowed them to cool, then put them in a covered casserole dish.  I put them in with the turkey about 1 hour before dinner.  They were piping hot and cooked all the way through. I topped them with balsamic vinegar and they were wonderful.

Super delish! I added salt and pepper in the bowl to be absorbed during the cooking process. Olive oil should not be heated so used grape oil instead and at the end used balsamic glaze instead of vinegar. My kids and husband loved it.

Followed the recipe as far as cooking instructions; hubby does not love onions, so just used a bit of onion dust along with salt and pepper, and then forgot about the balsamic vinegar! lol Anyhow, hubby couldn't stop eating them when they were put on the table. Great recipe because it's simple and allows you to taste the sweet potatoes without all the usual butter/sugar/marshmallows/spices that get added to them. Thank you for sharing.

You need to thank your grandmother for me. This was exactly what I was looking for. I have had sweet potato casseroles in the past with the sugar and marshmallows, but as I was recently found diabetic, I wanted something else that wasn't too sweet.

We used white sweet potatoes instead of the orange ones. They are a bit more mild in sweetness than the orange ones. Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of perhaps adding a bit more vinegar, but these were well received. Will be adding this to my regular rotation.

Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I have to admit, I didn't have Balsamic and considered making a mixture with a similar vinegar/sugar combo, but decided to just leave it out. Not sure what I am missing from the original, but it really had a great flavour even without. 

One thing I will say is that I am going to use a little less onion and a little less oil. I may also broil it to try to crisp it up a bit. Just my own little tweak, but the original recipe was great.

I did precook my sweet potatoes a bit as one reviewer recommended. We omitted the balsamic and they were very good! Will do again.

Made this exactly as is but also with a dash of red cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I didn't think we needed the balsamic vinegar since it was very good the way it was, but it took it over the top!

Really good, didn’t use balsamic, used 4 sweet potatoes half onion a bunch of garlic. Leave garlic big so it doesn’t burn.  Do full time in oven.  Next time try in casserole dish to see if easier to mix

Got rave reviews for this dish at my dinner party. My husband bought Hannah sweet potatoes (the ones that are pale/tan on the outside and white on the inside), so while  the dish was lacking in color, it was still very delicious. I did not use any balsamic vinegar drizzle.

This is another perfectly easy dish to pair it up with any meal. Though I had trouble slicing the yam, I made it work. I had less garlic and onions and the balsamic vinegar since it could be overwhelming.

I liked the onion and garlic addition and the fact that mine only took 20 minutes since I cut them into chunks.  Also, the balsamic vinegar was a nice touch.

Adjusted the recipe to serve 12 for Thanksgiving.  Other than the peel on and the salt and pepper off, I made the recipe as written. It was a hit, several people commented that they'd never had a savory sweet potato dish before and would try it at home. One of my in-laws thanked me  for not serving it sweet with brown sugar, etc. Thank you, CATICALIC!

My dad loves sweet potatoes, but Wanted a healthier way to cook them without all the added sugar.  I typically do not like sweet potatoes, but I really like these.  Everyone actually commented on how good them were.  I wil make again.

Turned sweet potato haters into sweet potato lovers! Had them going back for seconds!!!  I didn’t use the balsamic vinegar but only because it was for a church Thanksgiving dinner and I wasn’t sure about everyone’s preferences so I left it out. But it was phenomenal with out it!  Next time I’ll leave the skins on and try to brown them a bit longer, but that’s my own experiment. I loved them just the way they were!

I'm a *huge* fan of traditional sweet potato (with brown sugar, cinnamon, etc). but I was introduced to roasted sweet potatoes by my wife's daughter a few months ago, so I was excited to give this recipe a try.  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe, though:  I omitted the onions, I added Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, thyme), and also added Parmesan cheese in the last few minutes of cooking.  The result was *fantastic* so I'm sure I'll be cooking this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Can't go wrong with sweet taters. I only had yellow onions so I used that in stead of sweet. Had all the ingredients on hand and would make this again.  Only issue I had was some of the onions were burnt.

This is a great basic recipe.  The only (minor) change I made was that I only used 1 Tbs oil because that's all you really need, and instead of balsamic vinegar I used a blackberry-ginger balsamic reduction (we are fortunate to have a store that sells primo aged and flavoured oils and vinegars in our town).  Yum.  Next time I'll try the black cherry balsamic.

Great combination of flavors.  I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, especially when even more sweetness is added.  But this is savory, not sweet, and I will make it again!  I had some balsamic reduction on hand and used that.  Wow.  My grandsons chose not to use the balsamic, but I think they missed out!

One of my favorite Sweet Potato recipes.  I added the balsamic before cooking it (just because I didn't read the recipe correctly) but it still came out great.  I love sweet potatoes without all the extra sweetness and this was really good.

I love this recipe, very easy to make and short cook time. I followed the recipe as written, and only added a bit of cinnamon sugar to the potatoes after they were done, to give it a sweet salty mix, and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again and again and again.

I made this recipe ommitting the vinegar and adding salt and pepper to taste. I should have left them in 5 minutes longer to get them softer. But they were very good.

Really easy and delicious side. Great alternative to the usual sweet dish. My husband (who is not a fan of sweet potato’s) loved them and asked me to make them again.

I made this with oriental sweet potatoes - I think they taste roughly the same. Just white in color. I also used red onion because that is what I had on hand. So yummy! Had to go back for seconds. Thanks for sharing.

This dish is a new Family favorite.  I prepared it just like the recipe except I probably added a little extra balsamic vinegar (I didn't measure) and I added some dried basil.  I threw it all in the Instant Pot and 20 min later it was done.  Absolutely Delish!!

This was really good. Tender and moist without all the marshmallows. I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, so just went with the kosher salt. It was very good without the vinegar.  It also smelled really good while it was baking in the oven.

This is such a simple way to prepare these vegetables and it was a huge hit with everyone in the house from 12-44 years old. I've since experimented with this by using some different veggie combinations and all have been good but the recipe is best just as it is. Thank you for sharing this. It has become a staple of weeknight meals cause it's so easy and delicious.

Overall, recipe is OK and I made it as written. I think this dish could use more balsamic vinegar to make it pop. I was really looking for a hint of it. It took longer to cook the potatoes than recipe indicated and the end result didn't taste anything other than roasted sweet potato. For us, the addition of the balsamic was useless. I rare it a 2 and my husband rates it a 3.

Absolutely delicious. I doubled everything (except the onions); I chopped one large onion and was tired of chopping veggies, so I added some onion powder. Out of 7 family members, only my youngest and oldest sons were not asking for seconds. Everyone else, even my 5 year old daughter loved them and wanted more. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!!

It's amazing how good this simple dish was! I prefer savory sweet potatoes over the sugary kind any day. I'd like to experiment with herbs in this recipe.

I always try to make a recipe as written the first time. With these, I accidentally mixed the balsamic vinegar in before baking. They still turned out good. My hubby gave them 4 stars. I gave them 3.

I added some garlic and onion powder, a few drops of vanilla extract, and I used everything else that was included in the ingriedents. It tasted great. I made the recipe twice. I opted out for the balsamic vinegar.

There is no way you can cook this for 30 minutes and they're ready. It took my an hour of cooking. Plus, they had no flavor.

I was looking for a sweet potato recipe that wasn’t ooey gooey,  sickeningly sweet and tried this one on a whim. It was the perfect mix of savory and natural sweetness. This one will definitely be a regular side dish at holiday meals (and maybe other times as well).

Will definitely make it again the wife loved them.

 I added minced dill pickle, and instead of balsamic, I used Worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar and added about a teaspoon of red chili flakes. Sounds weird but they were amazing! We can’t wait to make them again.

This was absolutely wonderful and a nice departure from sweet, sweet potatoes. The only difference that I made was (in a similar recipe) add Amaretto before baking.  I probably did 1/8 cup; just enough to coat.

Two big sweet potato. 8 cloves of Garlic, smashed and chopped. two sweet bell peppers quartered; added the salt and the oil,  added black pepper and red chili flakes at the end when cooked. completely forgot the balsamic. didn't matter! but can see where the acid would work. warmed the oven to 450 and turned it down right after the sheet when i.. 6 small red onions, quartered lengthwise, skins on... Great recipe. Easy prep great results.

Made this tonight and it turned out just great.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only had a yellow onion and I chopped the onion a little smaller, but it all turned out fine.  Hubby even liked the dish and he usually doesn't like any kind of vinegar.  Will definitely make this dish again.

I thought the flavor was very good - especially with the addition of the balsamic vinegar.  The vinegar gave the acidity that worked perfectly with the sweet, creamy potatoes.   The only problem I had was that the potatoes never browned or carmelized.

I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used half as much white distilled vinegar. (I was nervous, but it would probably have been fine with the full amount).  These were great, a savory sweet potato recipe that is making a believer out of this sweet tooth.

Good fool-proof way of cooking sweet potatoes. I will definitely make this again. Might adjust/change the seasoning depending on what I'm serving them with.

Made according to recipe except for adding a Tbsp of Mrs Dash and used a Balsamic and berry reduction for drizzling  overtop. It was really good and hubby who is not all that fond of sweet potatoes had 2 servings. Will definitely make again.

This recipes is fantastic,. Very simple to make and the onions give the dish a very savory taste as well the balsamic vinegar at the end. 
So far I made it two times and the family loves it. Freeze a bash and after reheated, it's was perfect.

We loved it so much, I made it twice.  The second time I added more garlic and a dash more salt to my taste.  I'm not a salt lover, but a dash more did reveal more depth of flavors.

Very good, very simple recipe that I will make many times more.  The balsamic vinegar adds a nice touch.  I cooked these along with some pork chops and they were both done at the same time.  Great meal!

I added halved fresh white mushrooms because I had a hankering for mushrooms and salted the mix before putting it all in the oven instead of after. No basalmic vinegar. It's the whole family's favorite way to have sweet potatoes, now. The kids were picking out the last of the sweet potatoes before anyone else could eat them, so that's a good sign.

It was easy  - nice mix of flavors with the sweet potatoes, roasted onion and garlic - with the overlay of tangy/sweet Balsamic topping.  I made it with 1/2 cloves of garlic scattered throughout - yummy!   It was great as leftovers too!

The recipe was a big hit! The sweet potatoes browned evenly, and came out crispy.

II left out the balsamic vinegar, and it was fine. I also left out the onion, because someone can't eat onions.

The salt and black pepper was good seasoning for the dish.

I would love to make this recipe again. Even without the vinegar and onions.

Rave reviews from my husband & 9 yo son who said "These are the BEST sweet potatoes ever!" I didn't have any garlic or balsamic in the house.  Made it anyway without those 2 ingredients.  Turned out amazing.  So nice to now have a sweet potato recipe that doesn't call for sugar, cinnamon, marshmallows, or pecans!  Just the natural goodness of the sweet potato!

I had two big sweet potatoes in the fridge and had no clue what to do with them. This was SO easy, tasty and healthy!! My family loved it!

Simple to make and delicious! Made the recipe as-is. DELISH!
Put some aside before sprinkling balsamic over it all. Added a dab of butter and light sprinkle of brown sugar. Kids loved them!

I did not use vinegar and I seasoned it before it went in. At the end I broiled it for just a couple minutes and it was delicious!

Sweet potatoes are my new obsession, and this recipe was just what I was looking for.

I used more garlic than the recipe calls for because we like the flavor - I would say, use garlic to taste. I also used sea salt because the texture works well with this, and balsamic syrup instead of regular balsamic vinegar because it's a little thicker and doesn't have as strong a vinegar taste to me. I think next time, I will roast them just slightly longer to get a little more brown on the potatoes, but I will definitely make them again.

I would definitely make this again.  I was a little nervous that the Balsamic vinegar would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

Finally! This is the first recipe I've tried on sweet potatoes that is delicious without added sweetners. Not sure if it's the addition of sweet onion or the balsamic but this works, this is my new go to!

This was delicious. My husband loves sweet potatoes, but I'm not a huge fan. I would eat these again. Hubby also suggested that this would be great with regular potatoes.

This was great!  Very easy.  It did take about 15 minutes longer to cook but I had about 6 cups of sweet potato so that could be why.  We started eating it without the balsamic vinegar and it was so good we didn't even bother with adding it.

These were delicious! I made just as stated, roasted a bit longer as I had more sweet potatoes in the pan. I loved the way it tasted out of the oven, so I didn't bother with the balsamic. I will make this frequently, it is so easy to prepare!

I added some extra balsamic vinegar at the end because we're big fans of the stuff but other than that, followed the recipe as is and it was delicious! We love onions so we'll probably add in an extra one next time. This recipe is great!

Easy for someone who does very "involved" cooking on a rare basis, but really tasty!

I added a bit more salt than was perhaps necessary, but people loved it anyway! I think next time, I'll go with less salt. Otherwise, this is a great recipe and one I'll be pulling out at future dinners, both personal and potluck!

My sister made this last weekend. It was great, and I'm not a big sweet potato person. In the past, I think I ate more of the marshmallows then the sweet potato! :)

Wonderful way to eat sweet potatoes! I found the combo of onion, garlic, and balsamic vinegar was a bit too many very strong flavored.

Forgot to drizzle the balsamic vinegar on it, but it was still delicious! And easy, my favorite kind of recipe.
