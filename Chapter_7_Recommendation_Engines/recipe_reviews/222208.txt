Chef John never disappoints!  This sauce is fantastic, and you can customize the amount of heat to your liking by adjusting the amount of cayenne.  Keep in mind that this recipe is only for 2 servings, so plan on tripling it for a family of 4-6.  We ate ours with grilled chicken, and loved it, even my 10 year old daughter.  Bravo!

I used this recipe for some meatballs for a party, so I needed considerably more... I kept the ratios the same, and tweaked the recipe as follows:
1.5 cups chicken broth
half cup peach preserves
half cup cherry preserves
I squeezed a whole lemon into a half cup measure and filled the remainder of the cup measure with red wine vinegar. 
a heaping teaspoon of chinese hot chili sauce. 

Simmered for awhile, probably at least 20 minutes. It turned out great.

I've made this twice, the second time I bought the 5 spice Chinese powder to go into it and it added a strange flavor that we didn't care for (I wished I'd saved the $5).  The sauce definitely needs to be thickened.

Excellent sauce you can adjust to your taste.  I use peach preserves for a lot of things because it isn't that strong in peach flavor to overpower the other flavors and makes sweet things fruity.  Examples are Candied Sweet Potatoes, Sweet pork chops, Upside down cakes, Peach Pie and peach toppings, etc.

Was delicious.  Great with our turkey dinner and later on sandwiches.  I did use oranges instead of tangerines as they are not easily found in Alaska this time of year.

I made it using the three part broth, two part peach preserves and one part vinegar method.   It turned out great.

I tried this recipe to resurrect some over-cooked pork tenderloin.  it was just what was needed adding a touch of spice with this sweet and sour sauce.  I added some ginger which gave it an additional amount of kick.  Thank you Chef John!
