That's a great sandwhich!  I wasn't sure what "prepared dijon mustard and mayonnaise blend" was, so I used dijon on one side and Smart Balance mayo on the other.  Wonderful taste and texture; the tomato keeps it from being too dry.  Defintely a keeper!

I don't know if I'll make these again, but if I do, I'll see how they turn out with the tomato put on after the broiling... the heat of the oven just got those juices going, so that half of the bread was soggy and gross.  We ended up pulling the topping off and eating them with a fork... the flavor was very good, though.

These are mighty tasty! I've made them several times. In a pinch I'll use regular sandwich bread and mix a little dijon with mayo instead of using the blend. They can get a bit juicy under the broiler, so keep a napkin handy when eating.

Wow - now this is a sandwich! And, it had my husband's name written all over it - the more the better! This is perfect for a quick weeknight meal when you don't have time to cook, or just don't feel like it. I lightly toasted the roll before assembling it and left off the tomatoes until after it was done. Be sure you have an appetite and a lot of napkins ready because this makes one heck of a meal. I served it with pickles and kettle cooked chips - YUM!

Delicious!  This recipe has been waiting for a picture for a long time.  Why, I don't know because it is a keeper.  The addition of thinly sliced red onions would be great.

Made this for the recipe group selection of the week. We had no problem with soggy bread and we had some juicy tomatoes, maybe because we kept them under the meat and cheese. We also added onion slices and avocado wedges, broiled them too. I did sprinkle some oregano on the meat to give the Italian taste the cook was talking about, and of course some ground pepper. A nice quick easy summertime meal, they were very good and I'm sure we'll make them again.

Made this for the Buzz Recipe Group.  It is a quick and easy recipe.  I made my own Dijon mustard and mayonnaise blend.  This makes a rather large sandwich with a generous amount of meat and cheese.  I halved the sandwiches and served with shredded lettuce and sliced purple onion along with a side of vegetable chips and dill pickles.  Thanks Laurie Abkemeier for sharing your recipe.

Simple, easy and what's not to like. I too made my own Dijonaise by mixing Dijon Mustard and Mayonnaise to taste. Basic ingredients that go well together and seems too that everyone likes. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*).

Absolutely LOVED these!! If you follow the order of the ingredients, as given in the directions you should have no issues w/soggy bread from tomatoes. The sammies are under the broiler for maybe 2-3 min max(at least under my broiler). Just wonderful!!

Average, but a good possibility in the hot weather when I don't feel like cooking.  I omitted the mustard & Mayo and used butter and barbecue sauce.

This recipe is perfect for a quick dinner.  I use it on those nights I'm too tired to cook.  Highly reccommend at least trying this one on a busy night when you are pressed for time.  You will be pleasantly surprised at how yummy and easy this one is.

Such a tasty sandwich! I used onion buns, my favorite. Melty goodness all around. The mayo (I may have used too much) made the whole thing not want to stay together so I made a mess of myself :) Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is a yummy, albeit HUGE, sandwich.  I was worried that it was going to be on the dry side, but it was not dry at all (nor was it soggy).  Loved the addition of the muenster cheese.  Thanks for te recipe, LAURIE ABKEMEIER!

Recipe Group Selection:  24, August 2013 ~ Once again I'm late to making the group selection, but, better late than never.  My hubby LOVED this very meaty sandwich.  I made 'French Baguettes' from AR as the bread for this filling sandwich.  The bread was a great selection.  I didn't have any problems with the bread getting soggy at all.  This sandwich came together very quickly and paired nicely with a bowl of soup.

This weekend we had a "SANDWICH WAR SHOWDOWN"!!  
Meet The competitors:  Italian Beef Sandwiches vs. The Munroe Melt.
The Munroe Melt 5 stars.
Italian Beef Sandwich 3 stars
This was so good and filling.  The tomato in the middle made it messy to eat - maybe add it to the top of the sammy?  Also had an avacado - what the heck, nice addition.

I am definitely a sandwich lover and this is a good one.   I always just fill my roll, sub or bulkie, with what I love most and am always a happy camper.  I'd give any sandwich 5 stars, even the humble PB&J, to which I often add sliced banana :).

We loved these. I made a kid's version with the munster, the spreads, and the roast beef. My daughter liked it. The real versions, made for my husband and I, were such a hit we ate too much. I cooked enough for leftover meals and well, there isn't any left. Well, I almost forgot, I don't really favor swiss cheese on anything, and I replaced that with provolone. It was amazing! So I suppose my family had three versions here, but this idea, which by the way introduced my family to dijonnaise for the first time, is an overall great one that will go permanently into the recipe box.

This was a big hit with my family. My husband was really worried because he doesn't like mustard but it was a really great flavor. We've made it a few times now and I wouldn't change a thing!
