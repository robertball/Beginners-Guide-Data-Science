I used whole wheat bread and reduced fat mayonnaise for this sandwich recipe. The sandwich itself was good but the kids and I didn't really care for the sandwich cooked in the microwave. Next time, I'll just use the toaster oven to toast the bread alone.

Great sandwich - a nice twist on a regular BLT! I used hickory smoked bacon instead of turkey bacon (my husband would freak if turkey bacon every touched his lips) and used a combination of swiss and cheddar cheeses.  I didn't bother putting this in the microwave to melt the cheese - I didn't see the point as it was perfect as is.  All it needed was a dill pickle and kettle cooked chips on the side.  Excellent!

Quite honestly, I always use these ingredients when making a BLT (with the exemtion of the turkey bacon) but I assemble it differently.  I kinda made it like a grilled cheese by spreading the mayo on the outside of the bread, placed it (mayo) side down and layered cheese, lettuce, bacon, cheese & then topped again, this way the bread is nice & soft.  The kids loved em even with the turkey bacon, actually, they didn't even notice the difference.  Thanks for sharing Amy!

I had to laugh at myself the first time I made this sandwich!  I had misread the description and used layers of turkey; bacon; not as much cheese; lettuce; tomato, and mayo.  I grilled it as a Panini.  Actually, the turkey slices were a great addition.

I thought this was very good.  I didn't have any turkey bacon on hand so I just used the regular and spiced it up with a little bit of fresh ground pepper.  I also used Sharp Cheddar and Colby Jack.  It was really good, and will definately be made again in our house.

Last night, I made this recipe b/c we were in such a rush to get to the Timberwolves game and there was NO WAY we'd go and pay $3.25+ for a measly hotdog! This is an easy & quick recipe!! I followed MC_MA's advice to the letter with the exception I used deli-sliced colby jack cheese. Also, I obtained the turkey bacon from my "almost-inlaws" who live right across the street (MC_MA = I laughed so hard upon reading your review about YOUR inlaws this morning. Hilarous! What's funnier is my situation is the same as they live right across the street! Not kidding as they could watch us from their front bay window if they wanted. It is a mixed blessing, wouldn't you say?). The "almost inlaws" eat turkey everything! Turkey burgers, turkey bacon, turkey nuggets, ect...I was surprised that I couldn't even tell the difference (once it was in the sandwich)! Just like a BLT...only better with the cheese & mayo...and MAYBE just a tad healthier due to the turkey bacon (or maybe not with all the other condiments I added:)). Although this not the most original recipe for a sanwich I've had, it certainly was good and filled us up for the game. Thanks Amy!

Very easy and delicious, I would sometimes put 1000 Island spread instead of mayo.

A classic BLT only with "triple" the amount of bacon, lettuce and cheddar cheese! We ate these sandwiches for lunch with homemade soup. I skipped the microwave method for melting the cheese and just placed the slices of cheddar cheese inside the sandwiches. Very filling, tasty and satisfying.

What I like about this is that my kids can microwave the turkey bacon easily and there isn't a lot of hot grease to worry about. Generally we don't use as much mayo as called for here, just enough to cover the insides of both pieces of bread, use 1 or 2 slices of American cheese. We have also used shaved ham instead of the turkey bacon. Much better and cheaper for you than a fast food sandwich.

This was okay.  My husband made them and thinks you should put the lettuce on after you put the sandwiches in the oven.  The lettuce becomes soggy if you don't.  I think that I would personally go with a different kind of bacon for the best flavor, but if you are looking for a healthy sandwich than turkey bacon makes sense.

Very simple and very tasty.  My husband claims to dislike turkey bacon, but he just devoured this sammy.  I used multigrain bread and "fresh from the garden" tomatoes for a delicious and more healthy touch.

I think using Tuscan artisan bread is better. I used Sharp Cheddar for the cheese and added onions. I did not heat this in the microwave with the lettuce and tomatoes.

Delicious! Swapped the lettuce for tomato and it was still fantastic!
