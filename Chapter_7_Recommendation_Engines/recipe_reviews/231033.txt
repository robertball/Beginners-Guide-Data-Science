Very good! I used spiral pasta b/c I had some in the fridge that needed to be used. I cut back a bit on the cilantro b/c I *like* it, but not enough to put that much in, lol. Great flavor combination, and I LOVED the honey-roasted peanuts! I would totally make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This salad was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a few squirts of lime juice to give it a bit of extra tang, although it's also perfectly good without it. I went full gourmet and made my own honey roasted peanuts, which I think gave it a sophisticated touch.

I think this would also be a great main dish with the addition of tofu or chicken.

Second review, I made it again this time I had sesame seeds, and they were definitely a nice addition.  The first time I used about a half teaspoon of pepper flakes, this time I added a whole teaspoon.  That's about where I like it.  The biggest change we made, which I think is the perfect balance, is using 1/4 cup sesame oil instead of a half cup.  This made room to experience more of the flavor profiles, and other agreed.

My mom just made this dish, definitely a keeper. Spaghetti noodles are the way to go. Make sure to let the sauce sit for a least four hours and DONT skip the nuts if possible

I'm eating this salad on day two and it is even better than day one.
Used spaghetti, 1/4 cup sesame oil, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, threw in a few more peanuts and added 3 cups cubed poached chicken breast, 1 cup snow peas and 1 cup shredded carrots. (Drained the spaghetti on top of the peas and carrots in a colander to blanch them.)  Served as a meal in a bowl!  This recipes lends itself to all kinds of additions.   It also makes a ton!   Will cut in half next time I make it - unless I'm feeding an army!  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't enjoy this dish. The sesame oil and soy sauce were overpowering.

Just made this......I found it a bit bland, so I added about a tsp. of balsamic vinegar.  That helped.   It wasn't bad.....just not great.  I like more of a burst of flavor in my food.   Just personal preferences.

This is a great recipe!  It's fantastic as it is, but I like my veggies.  I used about 3/4 the amount of pasta and added a couple of cups each thinly sliced carrots and small broccoli florets.  Add a squeeze of fresh lime juice on top and you have an amazing lunch or dinner!  Yum!

Just made this pasta salad. I honestly thought the ingredients sounded like a strange combination but I like all of them and am always looking for unique flavor combinations. Folks, this totally works!  It’s not your usual pasta salad but ba-better!  Make it just like the recipe states, I bet you won’t need to tweak a thing.

I made this pasta salad earlier this month and it was a hit! I did have to improvise on a couple of things. I did use salted caramel peanuts and used a sweeter soy sauce than normal,but  it turned out great anyways. I forgot to put pepper flakes in,but that's okay. I think if you're thinking of trying this recipe,don't think about it too long. Just do it!

This is SO good the way it is. My mom made it for a pot luck I hosted and EVERYONE raved about it so she made it a few more times for parties we had, and again everyone raved. I just recently made it myself for a 4th of July BBQ I went to, and again- loved by all. The only thing I did differently  was chop up the peanuts- just a personal preference and use radiatore pasta (to me a pasta salad needs small noodles, not spaghetti- again personal preference)
I suggest you make this if you like spice, cilantro and sesame ??

My husband and I loved this; but too spicy. Next time, will cut the red pepper flakes in half. Also, I substituted roasted almonds for the peanuts b/c my nephew has a peanut allergy. This recipe had an addictive quality -- couldn't stop eating, despite the heat. How far in advance can it be made and still taste good or can it be frozen? I have a brunch coming up at the end of a busy weekend. Was hoping to make it on Thursday and serve it on Sunday. Will that work?

Left out cilantro because we don't like it. This is a keeper.

I've made this many many times for guests and everyone LoVES it!  I never use sesame oil or corn oil simply because I don't have it. I use olive oil. I also don't use cilantro because no one likes it. I also add a package of extra firm tofu chopped. Seriously best dish ever!

second review: Added two tablespoons of White Balsamic Glaze and now that's a fantastic Asian pasta salad.  You could i imagine use a Reg Balsamic Glaze I used the white to keep the light color. but not just balsamic vinegar. The glaze is thick and sweet.
