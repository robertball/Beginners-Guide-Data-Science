So funny how so many reviewers remember their mothers making a similar recipe. It's good to be reminded that simple, old standbys can still be good. "Ranch" has kind of become today's go-to for dips and dressing, where mayonnaise used to be. What I remember my mother (and grandmother!) doing was mixing a bit of ketchup into mayonnaise and making a thousand island style dressing to go over the lettuce wedge. Bacon is an awsome addition, but the tomatoes are totally optional (for those days there's nothing in the kitchen).

OMG - my mom used to make this when I was a kid (some 50 years ago) but she'd use mayo instead of ranch.  I make this quite often when I don't know what to make or don't want a heavy meal.  Have used ranch for picky kid but always mayo for mine.  Thanks for posting and bringing back such wonderful memories.

I, too, have made this recipe for years. It's the freshest tasting salad with the least amount of fuss.  I have fun arranging things on the chilled individual plates: some tomato wedges, some cucumber slices, a little pile of feta cheese, maybe a half of a hard boiled egg and a long scallion draped artfully across the top ;).  Absolutely delightful!

For something so simple, this is always good.  You can use any dressing that you like, but for me....Ranch is the way to go.

This is a great salad, A friend made it for me for lunch one day. Shes uses Blue cheese Dressing, drizzles a little Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing on the plate first then the lettuce, bacon, dressing and tomatoes.  I made it for my husband, he also liked it.

Thanks for posting the recipe. There is a great restaurant here in Orlando called Friends that makes a similar wedge, but they add blue cheese crumbles and crumbled bacon. Mel's Diner on the Gulf Coast of Florida (chain) also makes a similar wedge with blue cheese dressing. Yumm.

I have made this recipe in the past and it's a great summer lunch. It is so refreshing to have a nice cold wedge of crispy lettuce. I like to make the packaged ranch dressing. No other lettuce gives you the same texture. Serve it with good bread and an avocado half.

So simple.  There is something about leaving the lettuce whole that makes this meal so much heartier.

This was actually better than I expected.  Im not much of a salad eater but I was making this primarily for my dad and he raved about it.  Its more so the concept of it thats fabulous (obv) and you use much less dressing as you would a typical salad.  Id love to try some different similar shapes that allow more toppings to be places on it.  Great easy recipe.

I served this side some broiled crabcakes I made for lunch one day.  My family enjoyed it very much.  A great summer meal.  Thank you.

Great old recipe!  We sometimes forget the simplest are best.  My mom used to make this with her homemade mayo dressing, 40 years ago.  She would add a hard boiled egg on the side to make it a complete lunch for us..I love it with red onion and blue cheese dressing and double the BACON!!

At my house this is the ultimate salad... forget the Ceasar and bring on the wedge. However, we serve it the old steakhouse way and use blue cheese instead of ranch. Add the crispy bacon and diced tomatoes and you're in business.

Funny, but this is just a salad when you look at it, but is so much better.

My 5-year-old will eat this so I love it.  He likes it because he can pick it up and eat it with his hands.

These are fun and interesting to have once in awhile, but messy for the kids (and adults) to eat.

This is a wonderful way to make a quick salad when you're in a rush, and it's delicious!  I've made this salad with blue cheese dressing as well and thought it was great!

I love this salad but I took a cue from Johnny Carino's Italian Wedge Salad and top mine with candied pecans, gorgonzola cheese, a diced apple, bacon and ranch dressing.

Wow!  What a tasty, easy summer recipe.  Used some cubed rotisserie chicken once, chop suey noodles another time.  Husband wants to gild the lily with blue cheese--Down, boy!--but am resisting with various excuses.

This is one of our favorites.  The crispness is especially appropo for a summer meal.  I use homemade blue cheese dressing and add sliced bermuda onion.  Yum!

Just wonderful, i love the crunchy texture of Iceberg lettuce.
