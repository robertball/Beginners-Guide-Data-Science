Lovely recipe. I had 4 smaller leeks and it came up 1lb. It was a little sour for me so I added just a touch of agave. My teenage boys even liked it. Thanks Don for another keeper!

I really didn't think this would be so tasty. I was very surprised that it was so good! We ate it with teriyaki chicken and rice. Will make this again for sure!

This is truly yummy. I have given the recipe to several friends. The leeks cook down quite a bit, so it's better to have too much than too little.

Loved this simple recipe.  It was hard to determine how many pounds of leeks to buy to get 2-lbs. of whites.  I didn't buy enough, so I just made a half a batch.  I really enjoyed the subtle taste of the fresh lemon in this recipe.  Thanks, Don for sharing your recipe.

This recipe was so simple and so tasty.  We will definitely be eating more leeks now. I served it with tuscan chicken and a tossed salad.  I was looking for a great weeknight recipe and this one fits the bill. To dress it up for company (aka, add some color) I may try adding red peppers and/or parsley or thyme.

Followed recipe as written.  Makes an interesting side for many meat dishes, but would not want to make an entire meal on it.

We have enjoyed leeks for years, it is not a new vegetable for us. But this recipe is really different and easy, and does justice to this wonderful vegetable.

I added an extra half lemon's worth of juice to the leeks after cooking them as the lemon flavor was not as pronounced as I was hoping!

I tried this recipe and didn't make any changes.  Suffice it to say, there were no leftovers!  Simple and tasty!  This will become a "go to" recipe anytime I have leeks.  Thanks for a recipe worth keeping!

I will cook this tomorrow. The recipe says use the whites from 2 lbs of Leeks. Not 2 lbs of whites. Personally, I'll use more like 3 or 4 leeks (depending on the whites), but include some green, like one of the two picture shows.
