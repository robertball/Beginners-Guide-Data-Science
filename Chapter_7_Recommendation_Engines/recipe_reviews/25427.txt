This recipe is really good for long BBQ lunches in summer. 
Although I didn't want to lose the look of the crab. I used Australian Sand Crabs. I just pried off the underside of the shell and left the rest intact. Then grilled on my BBQ like the recipe stated, basting the whole crab useing the marinade. I then put the undershell back onn briefly so I could flip the crab without losing everything. I served this with a light Ceasar Salad and a glass of Houghtons White Burgandy, MMMMMMMM Yum. 
I used a medium sizex BBQ and we fitted 4 meduim to large crabs and about 2 doxen tiger prawns, si size is not a problem

It was wonderful and it got me thinking of other things I could do. I seasoned them really well, put them in a pan with a little water and butter. Then put them on the pit with indirect heat. Amazing.
