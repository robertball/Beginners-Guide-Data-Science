I really hate to do this but I have to be honest. I like all of the ingredients in this recipe and this sounded delicious but this recipe did not work at all for us. The taste was ok but the texture was so unappealing that I couldn't even bring myself to eat the leftovers. When plated it looks like a big mound of mashed potatoes but every other bite you get a piece of hidden fish or shrimp that just throws you off. Again, the flavor was fine if you can get over the texture or lack there of. I almost think it would be better if you put the potato layer down first and baked it to form a "crust" and then later added the shrimp and sauce? I don't know but it is just a thought. I will not be attempting this one again...sorry
