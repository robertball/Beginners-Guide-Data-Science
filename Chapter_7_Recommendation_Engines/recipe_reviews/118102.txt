These may have been the best pancakes I've ever eaten!  They were very fluffy, and light, but not too light.  The texture was fabulous.  The taste was wonderful!  I doubled the recipe and had more than enough for my family of 5 (3 of which are little boys) with plenty leftover for breakfast in the morning!  I used 2 cups Southern Comfort non-alcoholic eggnog and 1 cup whole milk.  It turned SO yummy.  I'll be making this again!

This is a good recipe... I sifted the dry ingredients to help it not be too dense, since eggnog is so thick.  The eggnog flavor is very subtle - almost understated, but nice.  A full recipe will make about 12 1/4c. pancakes.

I LOVED the flavor of these... But for once I didn't read reviews beforehand (oops) Like everyone said, the measurements are off. The batter is way thick as written. I kept adding more eggnog and finally got it thinned out to make the pancakes. I didn't want to thin with water or milk, as I didn't want to lose the eggnog flavor. I'm going to try these again and try to get the measurements figured out. These do brown really quick because of the sugar in the eggnog, so watch them carefully :)

A Huge, huge hit!  I prepared them exactly as written, using "Turkey Hill Eggnog".  My husband thoroughly enjoyed them (as did I), and it rescued me from the dog house... ("Why did you buy so much New Year's Eggnog???") I'll upload our pics soon.  Hopefully you-all will laugh with me, because I only remembered to snap the shot after my hubby had nearly polished them off.  :D

Can you say, "YUMM"???? Ohmygosh, these pancakes were so good!  As per others, I too added an extra 1/2 c eggnog and 1/2 c milk to thin out the batter..it was just waaaay too thick.  I also sifted the dry ingredients together before adding them with the wet stuff ;)  I topped these little babies with real maple syrup and they were oh-so-tasty..the maple really did enhance the flavor of the eggnog!  This is making a permanent home in my recipe book :~)

Made half a recipe with 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/4 tsp nutmeg (personal preference) but otherwise I changed nothing.  Made waffles instead of pancakes and they turned out fantastic - wonderfully risen and with a delicate eggnog flavor.  Great recipe for using up that extra eggnog in my fridge!

Hubby & my grandsons made these pancakes for breakfast thsi morning. They added a bit more eggnog & then some water to thin it out some. The eggnog flavor was subtle & I was afraid it would be masked by maple syrup but strangely enough, it helped bring the eggnog flavor out. Thansk for a tasty seasonal breakfast...we enjoyed it!

I used a homemade shortcut eggnog in this recipe and I subtracted two teaspoons of the eggnog and added in two teaspoons of quality rum extract. Seriously one of the best pancakes we've ever had. Light, fluffy and very flavorful. I served them with homemade maple-vanilla syrup and we ate every single pancake--NO leftovers.

These pancakes were fun.  While I wouldn't particularly run out and buy eggnog to make these, I would happily recall this recipe to use leftover eggnog.  I too, found the batter to be very thick, and I burned the my first batch.  I added more eggnog, the batter was still fairly thick, but it held its shape while I rounded it about with the edge of my measuring cup. Maple syrup was good, but is perhaps too sweet, and I think a strawberry topping would be a better choice.  I can picture these as making one heck of a  special waffle and might try that instead!

These were really good. Made them for Christmas brunch and they tasted great. Just like most of the other reviewers stated the batter was really thick and since I only had the exact amount of eggnog the recipe called for i had to add 2 tbsp of milk to help thin it out. The pancakes were still a bit thick but cooked up really nice and the milk didn't really take away from the flavor of the pancake. Served with warm maple syrup and it was a hit with my whole family!

5 stars as long as you add more eggnog. I don't see how this recipe can be made as is, the batter turns out like dough!

Very good pancakes! I used Dean's eggnog in my batter, and I sifted the dry ingredients first. I also added more eggnog to thin out the batter some. The first time I made them I burned them because I waited for bubbles to form. Had I read the comments first I'd have known about how quickly they brown. The second time I turned the heat down to medium low so that they would brown sufficiently and be done in the middle. PERFECTION!  Add 100% pure maple syrup & enjoy!!

I turned these into waffles to like another reviewer did but halved the baking powder and added cinnamon & fresh ground nutmet + 2 tsp of rum. They were good but didn't have the flavor I was hoping for with all that eggnog. Will have to play with recipe to make it better but its a good start.

My family really enjoyed these (even the eggnog haters), they smelled wonderful. I did have to add a splash of milk, maybe a quarter cup? as the batter was too thick for my liking.

Delicious pancakes! But I also had to add a 1/2c or more of milk to thin out the batter, it was much too thick. Will make them again probably next year, nice way to use up the extra eggnog :)

Excellent recipe!  I made these on Christmas morning for my family.  Noting others' reviews, I added an additional 1/2 c. eggnog.  I think the batter was still too thick.  Next time, I will try adding 1/2 c. milk instead of the additional eggnog along with a tad more nutmeg so I do not "dilute" the eggnog flavor.  We loved the recipe and will make it again.  However, it does need some tweaking!

Great holiday fare!

I halved the recipe using the handy-dandy AllRecipes calculator, and, following the suggestions of those rating the recipe, increased the eggnog from 3/4 cup to 1-1/3 cup to get the right consistency. Also added cinnamon along with the freshly-grated nutmeg. This half batch made 8 4-5 inch pancakes.

The batter is way to thick as written. Had to bake the first 2 in the oven to cook through. 

If you double the amount of eggnog then it's much better. Similar to buttermilk pancakes, but not quite as fluffy or good.

The batter was way to thick, so I used the advice of other reviews and thinned it out with milk. It would have been better if thinned out with eggnog. I'll try this recipe again, but with the extra eggnog.

this turned out really good!we don't really enjoy eggnog since i guess we are not used to having it in our country.i made eggnog using the recipe of AMAZINGLY GOOD EGGNOG by nataliesmom..my brother and i liked it but the rest did not,i guess it's just a matter of personal preference.so i used the leftover eggnog to put in this pancake recipe and they all loved it!i wanted more eggnog flavor in it and i added more to my panckake but it ended up being too thin.haha.it was still good though..i also tryed if it could pass up as a crepe and it was great!

These were ok.  Not a huge amount of eggnog flavor to make it worth the effort of making!

very good with the change as others said in the amount of eggnog -- i put in about 2 1/2 cups (enough to make a good pancake consistency).

We enjoyed these pancakes for Christmas morning.  They have a nice eggnog flavor, without the heaviness of actually drinking eggnog.  I took the advice from other reviews to add more eggnog and nutmeg.  I used 2 1/4 c eggnog and almost doubled the nutmeg.  I microwaved the butter in the microwave, but forgot to add it and they still turned out fine.  They were very thick pancakes.

i decided to use bisquick.....NO BUENO!!  way too runny.  yes i know it says to use flour but i "figured" flour/bisquick- same thing.  Lesson learned!!  i ended up adding about 3/4 cups of regular flour and voila....eatable pancakes.

I tried these pancakes this morning, following the recipe exactly.  They don't taste like egg nog, the batter was much too thick, like a biscuit dough, and needed quite a bit of tweaking.  My husband added milk to thin the batter, more seasoning, and baking powder to fix it.  I haven't gone to read the other reviews of the recipe yet so I don't know why so many liked this recipe.  I hoped for great pancakes, and was terribly disappointed.

What a great way to use up leftover eggnog. I made these into Belgian waffles and used some cream cheese frosting I had leftover from baking cupcakes.

Pretty good, with the addition of at least a cup more liquid.  I did another 1/2 cup eggnog and 1/2 cup milk.  I also added some cinnamon and a tsp vanilla.  There's no way I could've made anything with the measurements as they were listed.  The maple syrup did bring out the eggnog flavor as others stated.  I'll make again.

Good flavor . . . I didn't read the reviews first and it was VERY thick.  I had a hard time getting them to cook all the way through.  If I try it again I will add more egg nog.

this recipie is awesome. i found the pancakes to be rich and filling, with a great aroma of eggnog. i brought these babies to work and my co-workers went crazy. i can't wait to make it for my dad who's favorite part of the holidays is eggnog.

These were really good.  Cut the recipe down to 3 servings.  They are so light and fluffy, and I used half whole wheat pastry flour.  I used Organic Valley egg nog, and was short 2 tablespoons, so I used skim milk to make up the difference.  The batter was so thick that I added a few more splashes of skim milk to thin it out a little.  I added extra nutmeg too.  Vintage is right, maple syrup does help bring out the eggnog flavor.  My kids helped me make these; one stirred the dry ingredients together while the other stirred the wet.  I made mini pancakes for them and they just loved them!  Great recipe.

My husband and I are both big fans of eggnog and look forward to enjoying it every year. We were equally pleased with these pancakes and enjoyed the eggnog flavor. The best part is that the eggnog (even with the 1 1/2 cups) was a lot, it was not overpowering! Will use this recipe again!! We used Oberweis eggnog, very thick, it made about 9 pancakes.

My family enjoyed these very much. I added another 1/2 cup of eggnog as the batter is way to thick if you follow the recipe.

These were really good; light with a nuance of eggnog flavor. Will make again.
Thanks Marilyn!

Flavor was good - however, I had to add almost another cup of eggnog to get the pancakes to the correct consistency? When I tried one as is - it was biscuit-like.
