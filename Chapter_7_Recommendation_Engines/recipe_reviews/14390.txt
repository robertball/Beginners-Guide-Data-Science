The salad was good but not great so I gave it 4 stars.  Not sure if I would try this again.

This was very good.  Similar to my mom's German Potato salad.  I left out the black olives but I will try them next time.  I'm thinking kalamata would be best.

Great potluck dish.  Doesn't need the bacon.  I recommend cutting the potatoes into 1" cubes and then boiling--easier to cook and eat.  I let them marinade overnight then added the olives, apple and onion the next day and served at room temperature.

Looking for some type of potato to go with grilled hamburgers, I found this recipe in my recipe box.  Not sure what makes “Spanish” potato salad, but it was good and different.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and omitted the chopped black olives in the dish.  This salad does need to marinate for a while.  The longer the potatoes sit in the dressing the more flavor it has.  I mixed this up in the morning, refrigerated it all day and let come to room temp for about an hour.  My family liked the dish, but wasn’t crazy about it at room temp.  They did enjoy it much better when I heated the leftovers in the toaster oven and served it as a hot side dish.
