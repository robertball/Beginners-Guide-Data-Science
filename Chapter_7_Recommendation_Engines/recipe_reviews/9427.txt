I'd really like to see this recipe under "nut roll" because that would have been easier to find. When I made this today, I cut down the recipe to 14 servings (4 rolls), in case it didn't turn out. It turned out great. I left the dough in a ball to rise for several hours (my fast rising yeast must have been on strike). Then I formed the rolls and poked it with a fork to let the steam escape before cooking. I brushed the tops with melted butter when they came out of the oven. They really weren't much trouble at all to make on a small scale. Hopefully the picture I sent will show how good they look!

I made this and everyone said it was better than grandma used to make.  Time consuming, but well worth the effort!

Nut Roll!! I am so happy to see someone put up a recipe similar to my grandmothers famously delicious nut rolls!! Of course, Grandma's is the best. And as soon as I get the exact recipe from her I will post it up here.

This is an excellent recipe.  I was worried because the dough was so stiff (I did not use all the flour called for) and so slow to rise.  The wait was worth it.  Very moist, flavorful bread.  I added some chopped dates to the filling, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Much easier to make than the mother in laws recipe from Yugoslavia, and best of all, my husband says it tastes better!

Just like Grandma made!  I also cut this down to 14 servings (4 rolls).  I might try to make this next year for co-workers instead of small holiday gifts!  It's good that the original recipe is for 16 rolls!

I followed this recipe to a tee, but it is unclear when to do certain steps, like when to add the butter, sugar, and egg mixture to the milk... how long to raise the dough...  I have some bread making skills so I filled in the blanks.
It turned out nicely, but it's not as moist as I would have liked. This could have been my oven. I'll probably have to continue my search for a good walnut bread roll, unless anyone has a few hints for me.

Totally awesome, and totally correct to be listed under walnut poteca! I was looking for a recipe to hold me over while waiting for my grandma to mail me her recipe. My only trouble was figuring out how the heck to spell poteca with my 87 yr old Italian grandmother living 1,400 miles away. Thanks so much for sharing, YUM!

Took awhile to find this recipe, my grandmother used to make it & just called it black walnut bread. I used to collect the nuts with my grandfather. I found some woods where they grow wild. I know it was very hard to crack & she'll them, ( any ideas?) also later in life my grandmother bought frozen dough. Does anyone have any ideas has to a brand that would be good, or if it should be a sweet dough ? Thanks
