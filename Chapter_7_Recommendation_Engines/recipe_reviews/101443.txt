Much easier than rolling enchiladas.  I made this with veggie chicken and used a can of tomatoes with green chilies instead of one can of plain tomatoes and one small can of green chilies.  Tasted very good and easy to make. I'll use this recipe again.

This recipe was really good. However, I did substitute a few of the ingredients. I didn't use green chili's or tomato sauce & seasoning, instead I used a can of enchildada sauce, a really good brand is best. I added a can of diced tomatoes to the sauce for texture. This is a really good hearty family dish. I added a dollop of sour cream on tops and jalepenos for my husband. Even better than the original "rolled" type of enchiladas. Even better heated up the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are good enchiladas.  I made them like traditional enchiladas, wrapped up in flour tortillas and baked in the oven to melt the cheese.  I only give four stars because they are not restaurant quality - you wouldn't find these in a Tex-Mex restaurant.  But I still recommend, the recipe is user friendly and the flavors are solid.

This was great.  I fixed it one night for my son, and when I got home there was only a very VERY small piece left for me.  I used flour tortillas, and no olives.  I also added about a tablespoon of hot sauce to the sauce mixture.  Great eating!  I'm going to make it with hamburger and sausage combo next.
