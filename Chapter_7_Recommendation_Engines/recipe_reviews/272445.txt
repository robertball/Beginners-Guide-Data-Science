Excellent! I made this as written and it was delicious. I served it over fish tacos but it would be good on many different things.

I have to admit, I'm not a fan of avocado.  I made this to cut the heat from the barbacoa I made and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of this sauce.  It was excellent!  I made it as written.
