I made the recipe as written except that I peeled the apples. I liked having very little sugar as I am trying to break my sugar habit. Next time I might add some chopped pecans. The apples were excellant with a pork roast.

This was delicious. I didn't have raisins, so I used craisins instead. I also used 2-3 tablespoons of the craisins because I figured it would add to the flavor, and it did! I didn't use the lemon juice because of the tartness of the cranberries. my family wants me to peel the apples next time, but I liked it as it was.

These were perfect even when I used Jameson Whiskey. Honeycrisp apples were the right call as well.

Followed the recipe to the letter, and there are a few things I will change in the future to suit our personal taste preferences.  The bourbon flavor was negligible, and there wasn’t much syrup after the apples were cooked resulting in dry apples.  Next time, I will double the syrup ingredients (water, bourbon, butter, and brown sugar) to see if that will help.  As written, this is a pretty healthy recipe, so I hope it works for you.  I do understand my planned changes will add to fat and calories but, hopefully, not too much.  Easy, quick, and tasty recipe.

I made this and used Southern Comfort in it. It was very tasty with my Thanksgiving dinner.

Absolutely amazing! I peeled the apples and used cranberries because I was out of raisins. Will definitely make again!

Excellent flavor!  Unfortunately, because the recipe doesn’t specify what type of apples to use, I purchased “Honey Crips” and they were too mild (not enough apple flavor and they remained on the crisp side.  I will definitely give these another try, but will probably stick to Granny Smiths. Thank you for the recipe!

Loved it. However I used Paddy’s Irish Whiskey and craisins. Will definitely make again.

I did a little twist on the recipe. I replaced one apple with one pair. I doubled on the dark brown sugar, used bourbon flavored vanilla extract, added 3 tablespoons of raw honey and cooked on the stove in half the time. I prefer my apples with a little bit of crispness.

These are excellent. I used Fireball so a little less sugar was needed.

Excellent recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I put French vanilla ice cream on top and drizzled a little caramel sauce over that.

I used a mixture of golden delicious and gala apples.  They were perfect.

I followed the directions exactly, and these were delicious. I love southern fried apples, and even though this recipe calls for less butter and sugar than most recipes, I didn't feel like I was missing a thing!
