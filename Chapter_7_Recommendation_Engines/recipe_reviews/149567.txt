Used balsamic vinegar instead of the required one and added 4tablespoons of lemon juice; turned out pretty good! Will definitely be going making this a regular dressing kept in the fridge.

This dressing is fabulous...made it just as the recipe called for but next time would use a bit less olive oil..it tastes just like the Greek dressing we used to get in Detroit's greek area...really really good and sooo simple!

I made this to use on a greek salad. I used a herb mixture of greens, feta cheese, onions, and tomatos. It was good and I especially liked that this recipe doesn't make too much so that way it won't go to waste and get used up in a timely manner. Thanks!

Will not make again. I fixed it exactly as the recipe states and it was very oily. Too greasy on the salad.

This was very tasty, but I do believe as stated there is a bit too much oil (which, of course, can be a matter of personal preference).  I measured nothing, just went with what quantities felt right, so I'm assuming I used 1/4 cup vinegar to the 1/2 cup oil.  I used this over Grecian Beef, Tomato & Cucumber Salad from this site and it was a perfect match!  I whisked the oil in very slowly to emulsify it and the end result was a pretty thick dressing.  Will use this one again for sure - Thanks, StevenRN!

I used white vinegar, reduced the oil, and added some water. I used it as a marinade for kebobs (chicken, red & green peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini)-- marinating the meat and vegetables separately in ziploc bags for 1 hour.  It worked out well and tastes delicious.

I needed dressing in a pinch, and this was just perfect for it.  Came together easily, tasted great with a greek salad (tomatos, olives, feta).

This was extremely oily.  If I make it again I will try to find some way to remedy that.  Apart from that, the flavor was not bad.

Nice dressing that is simple to make. I cut the oil amount in half and minced one whole garlic clove.

I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar after having just returned from a trip to Greeece, where they definitely seems to have a love for lemon juice when it comes to souvlaki! Delicious!

This dressing is great and serves more than four salads.  Like others said it is oily, so I think it would be best lightly dressing a salad not drowning it. I don't think I would change the amount of oil just use less on the salad. I served on romaine lettuce with kalamata olives, feta cheese, tomatoes, red onion, and carrots.  I didn't have dry mustard so I used yellow mustard instead. I needed it right away so we couldn't wait two hours - it was delightful.  This is a keeper!
