Here's my take: I spread peanut butter on the bread, top with marshmallows (not the creme) and pop in the toaster oven. It gives the bread a nice crunch, makes the peanut butter gooey and gives the marshmallows a nice campfire feel. With my adjustments I give it a five. Great comfort food. Yummo!

I'm from Massachusetts and we call this recipe a Fluffernutter. Now that I'm an adult I get to have one every single day if I want to. And I do!

I loved making this for lunch. The peanut butter sort of over powered the marshmallow so next time I'm going to add more marshmallow.

Nutella (chocolate and hazelnuts creamy spread) and marshmallows would be equally as good for a different treat with white or cinnamon and raison bread.

My dad (from back east) took these sandwiches to school in his lunch.
He called them "Fluffer Nutters". He passed away many years ago. My kids and grandkids as well as I do to this day still enjoy these sandwiches with him in thought.

Very good for a sweet/salty craving.  Try this with Nutella in place of the PB for a sweet switch.

Bread in microwave?  Asking for a soggy mess!  Instead of creme, I used mini marshmallows.  I took the advice of other reviewers and put mine in the toaster oven.  This with a glass of milk -NOW it's 5 stars.

I grew up on these.  My grandmother would make them for us on long fishing trips sometimes with banana and sometime without.  Try a light spread of butter on the side of the bread you will put the marshmallow creme on to help it spread easier.

i have not had one of these in a while, since i have been more health conscious.  however, i would reccommend using the strawberry fluff with natural peanut butter and to use sprouted whole-grain bread.

I loved this as a youngster.  Still think about pbm sandwiches with 1 exception and that is the worse.
I CAN'T find Marshmallow Fluff on the West Coast.  I was brought up on the East Coast and miss a lot of the good stuff you can't find in Waschington State.

these are the easiest way to satisfy a sweet craving that I know!! It's like dessert for lunch. Like many others I grew up eating these and I still enjoy them as do my kids. I sometimes make them with local farmer's market peanut butter mixed with flaxseeds to make a treat that's also good for you!

I love fluffenuters! I occasionally like to cut a banana into thin slices and place them inbetween the fluff and peanut butter. Great way to add some calcium for my niece and nephew!

I have been making these sandwiches since I was a very little girl, and that was a long time ago.  What I can't believe is that someone actually submitted this as a recipe.  I thought everyone in North America knew about Fluffernutters.  And my favorite twist to it is to add a layer of strawberry or raspberry jam on top of the peanut butter before putting the Fluff covered piece of bread on top.  Cinnamon raisin bread changes the whole taste of it and takes it away from being a Fluffernutter.

My daughter hates jelly with her p/b so I thought the marshmallow creme would be very yummy. She thought that the two combined is way too thick.

5 stars as listed, but give it a twist and try it with Nutella instead of the peanut butter - so good!

Great sandwich! I forgot to microwave it but it was still delish. I didn't measure but I thought the marshmellow creme would be too much if I added too much, but it definitely doesn't over power it, in fact I added more marshmellow creme. Don't be shy, next time I certainly won't.

Microwaving this is a bad idea. The bread comes out far too soft and a bit soggy which makes it difficult to hold. Stick with toasting the bread first and then applying the peanut butter and marshmallow and you'll be golden.

There's a resturant here in Seattle that makes this sandwich but with bacon on it (still called a Fluffernutter). Reservations must be made there just because of the sandwich! I have to say that it was pretty amazing! Also great with Nutella rather than PB.

We call these "fluffernutters."  I make these for my son, he loves them (and so do I). The only change I make is I put the sandwich together and then toast it in a skillet over medium heat.  The bread turns lightly brown and both the peanut butter and the marshmallow become gooey and blend together nicely.  YUMMY!

I use a toaster oven to make this yummy treat! I put two pieces of bread in the toaster oven. When the bread is nearly toasted I add 2 marshmallows to one piece of bread. When the marshmallows start to swell, I take it out and add PB to the other slice of bread. I then put the two pieces of bread togather and enjoy the gooey goodness.

I forgot about this sandwich recipe. I am a peanut butter lover and it has taken me 42 years to rediscover this wonderful concoction and try it. I placed my sandwich in the toaster oven long enough for the two ingredients to melt together.  Heaven between two slices of bread.

This sandwich is even better when cooked in a frying pan like grilled cheese (spray outside of bread with cooking spray).  I use torn up marshmallows when camping instead of the fluff spread.  AND, this is amazing on cinnamon raisin bread!

I have loved this sandwich all my 69 years.  I'm from Northern Maine and everybody eats it there.  Anytime I've mentioned it in other places I've lived, people look at me like I'm crazy.
