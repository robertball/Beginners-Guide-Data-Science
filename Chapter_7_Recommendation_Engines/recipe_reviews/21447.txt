As I was making this I was preparing myself not to like it as it seemed odd but I was pleasantly surprised!! The tastes really do work well together. I didnt like though that I could faintly taste the cottage cheese. I think I would prefer this with sour cream instead and that is what I will try next time. I also wanted to make it on the grill so I just marinated the fish for 1/2 hour in the lemon juice, bay leaf and I added garlic. I also think the sauce would taste better with fresh herbs. BUT all in all, a good starting point!!!!

I love this recipe!  It's very simple and elegant.  My kids devoured every bit of it.  Definately worth doubling, because everyone will want seconds.

Yes, a very simple & elegant meal! The swordfish was like butter, subtle flavors. I did use sour cream, because it was what I had on hand...but is such a quick, easy recipe, I had to give it 5 stars.  Thanks.

I made a few changes, but I don't think they impacted that significantly. I used sour cream instead of cottage cheese because I didn't really like the idea. I also added lemon pepper to the sauce, but wish I hadn't. The swordfish wasn't nearly as flavorsome as I remember it being (I rarely make recipes with swordfish), and I should have known that asparagus is kinda woody this time of year. I don't know, it just wasn't nearly as great as I thought it would be. Thanks anyway!

The dish was very easy and quick to make,  delicious, and appealing to the eye and nose!  We preferred just a dab of the sauce.  The cooking time was perfect.
