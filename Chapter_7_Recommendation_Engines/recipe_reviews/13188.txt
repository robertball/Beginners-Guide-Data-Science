Tasted very good. The soupy broth was quite nice. I used 1 1/3 pounds of mild italian sausage instead of pepperoni added a few sprinkles of oregano leaves increased the broth to 2 cans and added 1 cup of water. The melted cheese was a nice touch too. The only bad thing was that I forgot to let it cool down! It was interesting and unqiue but this will not be a part of my regular rotation. Good recipe Lise

A local restuarant that we frequent serves a soup that is very close to this (a little tastier & with sausage but close). I added a 1/2 cup of pizza sauce to thicken it up a bit. Don't be turned off by it its good.

I'll be honest this soup is nothing to what I am used to but it is pretty good. I used 1 lb of mild italian sausage and just a few slices of pepperoni. Due to the increase in meat I increased the beef broth to 1 1/2 cups and added (per other suggestions) 1 14oz can pizza sauce. This thicken the soup as others suggested and made it taste just like a pizza. It is good and maybe if I keep making it the recipe will grow on me more.

I tripled the recipe except for the meat and my family with 4 teenagers loved it. I stacked and quartered the pepperoni for smaller pieces. Serve with soft breadsticks. Very easy to make after work and a big hit at my house.

Fantastic! It really pays to keep these ingredients on hand. Perfect for: "Honey the guys and I are done with basketball and everybody is coming over. We're starving! See you in 30 minutes."

Thought it tasted good and not greesy at all. The only thing I did differently is that I added one small jar of pizza sauce and it was yummy. I served with bread sticks.

This soup is great. My wife is pregnant in her third trimester and I'm trying to do most of the cooking. I'm not the swiftest in the kitchen but I like to dabble. This soup was very well received. Easy to make but with the broiled cheese seems a little fancy. And tastes great!! This soup is not for those on a diet.

This wasn't horrible and it wasn't fabulous. Average. There are so many other soups on this site that will give you top notch results. While this came together very easily the flavor was not very interesting. Needs some doctoring for our individual tastes but I am sure others will love it. Sorry but I won't make it again.

I doubled this recipe. I used extra virgin olive oil added about 12 cloves fresh minced garlic fire roasted canned tomatoes two large red/yellow peppers turkey pepperoni and one large can of olives that I chopped. I added my own pizza seasoning (basil oregano red pepper flake Splenda brown sugar fresh ground pepper sea salt onion powder garlic powder thyme fennel paprika little lemon pepper seasoning parmesan cheese.) Because the soup wasn't as tomato-y as I'd like I did add two cans of organic tomato sauce. It's a good base recipe for me to start with but I needed it a little more hearty for this to be my soup for the week. I ended up sauteeing the vegetables and adding them with the rest of the ingredients in my large crockpot to cook all day. It smells SO good. I really didn't need the added cheese it stood well on it's own. Next time I'd like to add a little more chopped veggies or maybe some ground turkey sausage or ground chicken.

This recipe is so incredibly delicious! My toddler liked it but my 7 year old was turned off by seeing tomatoes. He's pretty picky. Despite that we are DEFINITELY keeping this recipe!

I needed to use up pepperoni so I gave this a shot for Sunday lunch. I omitted the seasoning and the green pepper and the flavor was surprisingly good. We really liked how flavorful the tomatoes turned out. The kids (7&5) even ate the veggies!

This is an incredibly easy recipe but hearty and delicious! I've made it several times and substitued canned mushrooms when I didn't have fresh on hand as well as different colured peppers kielbassa instead of pepperoni chicken stock instead of beef and it always turns out great! Very versatile and always a hit with my family!

This soup was okay. It was too greasy for my liking. It was very easy to make but I won't make it again due to the high fat content and the fact that it didn't do much for me. I would suggest using half the pepporonis and put more veggies. Maybe italian sausage would be good in this in place of the pepporoni?!

This was fabulous. I know that a recipe on here shouldn't be totally changed but I am going to put what I did. Took 3 Johnsonville Mild Italian Brats and uncased them and browned them. I then threw in onion green pepper mushroom and zucchini and browned that up. I put all of this in a pot and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes in juices (no salt added) and then a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. To this I added cut up turkey pepperoni basil and crushed red pepper flakes. On the side I cooked 3 cups of uncooked pasta i used large noodles so this might make a difference if you used elbow but after that was Al Dente I added it to the soup. I heated this through and topped with shredded mozzarella. DELISH!

Very quick and easy to make. When you first say "pizza soup" people are hesitant but love it once they try it. Big hit at staff luncheon.

It has a great flavor and I will definitely make again. The only change was I added a pound of ground beef. Served over a slice of italian style bread.

I made this just as written except that I left out the mushrooms. I also used turkey pepperoni. This didn't sound great but ended up being one of the best soups I've ever tasted! Stewed tomatoes and beef broth made a really tasty soup base as well.

Very yummy! Even my 4 yr old had some! I used turkey pepperoni slices and crushed tomatoes (because I had it on hand) rather than stewed tomatoes. I also added lots more Italian spices to rev up our metabolisms. Very easy to make as well! Enjoy!

This is a good recipe but I like to spice it up a little more by adding some hot sauce or some diced jalapeno peppers.

I made a bigger batch did not use stewed tomatoes and added 1lb sauteed ground sweet & 1lb sauteed ground hot sausage jar of tomato sauce and 2 large cans of crushed tomatoes. I also had shredded cheese on the side that when put on the top of each serving readily melted on the hot soup.

Good recipe. For my taste next time I will really smash the tomatoes before adding. It was a little chunky. I added garlic powder.

We had a wedding shower for my cousin. Her favorite food is pizza and I wanted to make something a different. I made this for 40 people and almost everyone went back for seconds and asked for the recipe. I went to 4 years of Culinary school and I give this recipe an A. A Must try! I did tweak the recipe a little I put about 1/2 the amount of pepperonis that it called for in and I made sure to skim the grease from the pepperoni off before serving. Also I put more tomatoes in about a 1/4 more because I knew the soup was going to be sitting in a slow cooker and some of the liquid would evaporate.

Pretty tasty! I also substituted mild Italian sausage for the pepperoni. I only used one can of tomatoes and two cups of homemade beef broth. I'm going to fix a batch for the freezer hoping this will take care of a pizza craving instead of ordering out.

Very versatile recipe. It's a good base and just like calling your local pizzeria it's modifiable to suit nearly any taste. I omit pepperoni add spicy sausage olives veggies and tomato paste. I don't broil the cheese just let it melt on in. Definitely a favorite for me.

Great soup! In addition decided to puree it (after straining out the chunky veggies) through the blender for a smoother texture. YUM!!! Added red/orange peppers and zucchini as well. Had it cooking in the slow cooker for 6 hours turned out great.

I used the entire container of beef bone broth.  I also used mini pepperonis and mild sausage.  I put pizza sauce in the soup as well.  I will most certainly make this again.
