Iâ€™ll definitely use this as my baseline recipe from now on! 
I used 2 tbsp beef drippings from a meatloaf I made, 2 cups of chicken tomato bullion broth, the 1/4 cup flour, a full cup of fresh sliced white mushrooms, garlic powder, a touch of rosemary and Italian seasoning, and some salt and pepper. This was delicious. I mixed the flour with the drippings until it clumped over medium heat and then added the broth and mushrooms at the same time to soften them. I let it boil and thicken while adding the seasonings. This recipe is very versatile!

I used a vegetarian chicken cube with 2 cups water and a little more than 1/4 cup flour. Thickness is great and very quick to make.

Well, yesterday was Thanksgiving so instead of 2 tablespoons of chicken drippings, I used turkey instead. I have the tendency to be gravy challenged but this turned out perfect for me. It was a little thinner than most but that is how I prefer it. I wasn't sure about the canned mushrooms but I was very pleased with the outcome. Fresh parsley really makes a difference in this one. I will be making this again today so that I have some for all of the leftovers.
