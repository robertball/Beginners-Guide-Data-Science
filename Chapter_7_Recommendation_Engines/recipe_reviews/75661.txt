It's a good way to do asparagus differently (I usually just steam it).  I think it's highly dependent on the quality of the balsamic vinegar, so use a good quality.  Easy to do.  Water chestnuts add good taste and texture. The first time I made this, I didn't have red onions, so I used white.  The second time, I used red onions and dish was vastly improved.  Worth a try, even for non-asparagus lovers. (It does look very nice!)  Addendum:  try adding a red pepper sliced lengthways for color.  I think it really adds to the look, and it's a good texture bridge between the water chestnuts and the asparagus.  I added the red pepper in at the same time as the asparagus and water chestnuts.

Instead of asparagus, I used this recipe with fresh green beans.  They were wonderful!

I used fresh asparagus.  Very easy, healthy dish to make.  I added a lot more onion and garlic to the dish, because it did seem a bit bland.  If you are looking for simple and healthy, this is a good recipe.

This was pretty good.  But don't use canned asparagus, turns out mushy.

This was pretty good.  I've never had asparagus before, but my husband requested some, so I found this recipe.  It was very easy and he loved it.

We loved this recipe. No changes were made to the recipe whatsoever and there were no leftovers. I will likely make this again tonight to complement our Tilapia dish.

Made this tonight using fresh asparagus.  I cooked it twice as long and forgot to put in the butter it was still delish. I'll be using this recipe as a side dish standby.  Thanks for the totally different side dish.

I followed the directions exactly, but mine came out mushy within minutes of heating it.  The only difference was that I used my own frozen asparagus, rather than store-bought.  That may have made the difference.

This recipe was different.  It didn't taste bad but I prefer my asparagus plain.  I will not make again.

This recipe was different.  I left out the water chestnuts because I don't like them.  But it was pretty good.  Also, it was quick and easy.

I enjoyed this dish using fresh asparagus. Be sure to wash the chestnuts in a bowl of water, until the water runs clear then place the strained chestnuts into an kitchen towel a few moments to get most of the moisture off them.  While I was growing up one of my friends was native to Mainland Hawaii.  From my cooking  lesson I also found out that most Hawaiian's harvest their own nuts as they grow prolifically on the island.  I find this gives the chestnuts a clean taste..

Pretty good stuff. Healthy, low fat, low carb, low cal. Cooked longer cause we don't like "crunchy" asparagus!

LOVED!  Served with (a slightly adapted) Balsamic-Glazed Salmon Fillets (ISYBEL).  Great compliments, great dinner.  So glad frozen asparagus worked well, as I often have it in the freezer.  As some reviewers have mentioned, the quality of the balsamic probably comes into play pretty greatly.  In case it's of any help, we love (and used) Monari Federzoni Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - Aged (available in most grocery stores). Thank you for submitting!

This was easy and different. The frozen asparagus was pretty crunchy, I may try it with fresh asparagus when in season.  I would make it again.
