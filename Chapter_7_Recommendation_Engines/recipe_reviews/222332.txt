I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very easy to do.  I bought a 12 lb. turkey but when the 3 hours were up the turkey was not done.  The breast was almost done but the legs and thighs were still bleeding. I had to put it back in but by the time the dark meat cooked, the breast was dried out.  I cried all Christmas dinner.

This was my first year cooking a turkey from scratch. The recipe is flexible but the technique that he explains in the video made this year a complete 100% success! Thanks Chef John!

Good recipe for flavour. I will definitely do this again. My problem was the temp. For an 11 lbs unstuffed turkey, it took 4 hours, and it was still iffy by the bone. 
I will start my next one at 400 F, breast down for 1 hour. Then flip it breast side up, reduce temp to 325 F for 2 more hours. 
This is my tried and true method, and the meat literally falls off the bone. 
Looking forward to combining these recipes. Yum!

Great video! For those of us that have been cruising by while Mom made the Turkey each year and all of a sudden it's our turn and we haven't got a clue.

I know this recipe says for beginners and first-time turkey makers, but I have been cooking the Thanksgiving meal for my family for over 20 years, and this is still my favorite way to cook a turkey. There are fancier methods out there, but I think turkey is one of those foods that is so delicious all by itself that it doesn't really need all those bells and whistles. This easy recipe gives you a delicious, juicy, beautiful turkey every single time. Thanks Chef John for another winner!!

Made a delayed Thanksgiving Dinner today....Absolutely the best Turkey Ever!!  So moist and flavorful.  Try this recipe and drain the juices and add chicken stock to make the gravy at the end.  You will not be sorry.

Great turkey recipe. The herbs and butter are what make it shine.

Cook 20 minutes per pound.

I made my first turkey with this recipe and it came out perfectly! I added a bit more butter, seasoning, doubled the herbs and added thyme to baste turkey with and total cook time was 4.5 hours. It turned out beautifully! This is going to be my go-to recipe for turkey.

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times now so clearly it's a winner!  My only deviation is that I always add a Granny Smith apple to the veggies in which the turkey cooks.   I've also used jar spices for the Rosemary & Sage when I forgot to buy fresh and could not face another trip to the store.  It's an acceptable substitute and I don't kick myself for it.  The turkey is always tender and NOT DRY (yay!) and falls off the bone.  My hubby and 5 boys love it and more importantly I love it. HA!   Thanks!

Aloha. I followed the recipe but I didn't use the vegetables on the bottom. I used a wire rack but to add height to it I thickly sliced potatoes and placed it under. The potatoes actually cooked with the juices from the turkey. The salt, blk pepper & cayenne mixture plus the sage and rosemary really added great flavor to the turkey. In the final half 45 minutes I basted the turkey with the juices causing the skin to have a beautiful crunch. Great and easy recipe.

I have cooked many a Turkey and this is the moistest Turkey I have ever cooked. I used the recipe as written. Excellent! Even the gravy had a nice spicy kick to it everyone enjoyed. I saved this recipe to use it again.

I followed the video presentation of this recipe, it is slightly different to the written one.  I am from Australia,and I am visiting family over here.  I cooked the turkey yesterday for Thanksgiving.  It was so amazing, it turned out beautifully, I have never tasted something so juicy and flavor some.  Thank you Chef John for sharing this recipe.

I was so excited about this recipe because it got such rave reviews.  Honestly, the turkey flavor was fine, but the gravy was so stinkin' hot.  Definitely not your traditional turkey recipe.  Next time, I won't use the cayenne.

I have to say this.... I wish I could hang with Chef John, without him ...and countless others on this site my family would starve! I wouldn't get a man through his stomach, I wouldn't get teenagers to remain at the table and the most of all I wouldn't get the approval of crusty elderly people  I have learned so much and I thank you.

Chef John, thank you! This was my first turkey and it was amazing. I was a little scared not placing the turkey in a bag like my mom did when I was younger, and I'm so glad I didn't. This turkey was wonderful. I'm not going to bore people with what I did differently. By the way, I only changed a few spices to our taste and fresh herbs. The timing was perfect, the bird was excellent, and you made me a professional!

Thanks Chef John!   I've made this for two years in a row and have GREAT success  both times!    The first year I used a tbsp of cayenne pepper.    It was warm ? but it was worth it!   It was great!   Easy recipe and great taste!   Making  amateurs look like professionals!!

A last-minute Thanksgiving schedule change required that I find a set-it-and-forget-it turkey recipe.  This one was just the ticket! Fast, easy, and tasty; what a combo.  This was my first time cooking a turkey and it's really nice to know that it doesn't have to be difficult!

This was my first time making a turkey. I had a small one, just 12 pounds. It was moist and delicious.  The herbs were wonderful.  Don't be afraid to try roasting a turkey.

I did this today.  Perfect!  I didn't have Rosemary or sage so I added those dry spices to the salt and pepper mix.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Very moist.  Very easy.  Will do this from now on.

Delicious, savory, make sure to put some water in the pan under the turkey, why? So your turkey doesn't come out dry. And bend the turkey wings under the turkey so they don't cook crusty, it will be hard to bend so get a strong friend to help you.

I loved this recipe.  It was my first turkey that I had to prepare for a big family Christmas dinner and I found the video very calming ;-).    I bought a nice organic bird.  I substituted fresh herbs for dry.  It came out amazingly well and so delicious.  Thank you.  As the Chef says - it was magazine perfect!

Used this recipe a couple of times now. I’ve put stuffing in with herbs. Loved it both ways! Also bribed first and that made it even better

This turkey was excellent!  And, as promised, it was super easy (video was super helpful)!  Everyone was complimenting it at Thanksgiving dinner and it indeed looked like a magazine cover (but forgot to get a pic in the scramble of getting everything ready).  Thank you, Chef John!

This was the best Turkey Recipe EVER!!!  I followed it  exactly but left out the Cayenne pepper.  I was amazed at how much gravy this method made it was so amazing.  We love gravy and never get enough.  This method made the most delicious turkey and gravy.  I had so many compliments this year.  I wish All Recipes would take all their 5 star recipes and make a large cookbook.  Please do this and you will get  my sale for sure.

Easy and delicious!  I used Tastefully Simple Rustic Herb seasoning instead of fresh herbs because my grocery store was completely out with the Thanksgiving holiday.  It turned out so delicious!

Never cooked a turkey on a bed of vegetables, but it was great and will now be my go-to method!  I wasn't getting much juice while cooking, so added some turkey stock to bottom of the pan so that I could baste.  Delicious.  Also did pretty much the same thing with a turkey breast (lots of white meat eaters in this group and needed some extra!).  With the breast, I put lots of butter under the skin. Thanks for this idea!

With the help of viewing the video first, this made for fairly simple preparation considering it was a last-minute decision to find a fool-proof, simple recipe. And turned out to be one of the best turkeys I've ever made! Mine was a 21 pounder but I still think I could have used a little less of the seasoning amounts called for the 12 pounder here. Nevertheless, the drippings plus some low-sodium chicken broth made for an excellent gravy. I may even be a little more intentional about the carrots next year and pick them out for a very delicious and colorful side dish.

Great Starter for a beginner/novice. I added and adjusted, but the basics of this recipe will yield a perfect bird for family. I followed this recipe to a tee, but added 2 quarters of fresh naval orange, 2 quarters of sweet yellow onion, Five fresh, uncut garlic cloves, and also added garlic, rosemary, thyme, and sage to the butter reduction.  I also added some rubbed sage to the salt, pepper, and cayenne. I know I’m going on and on, but I also doubled the amount of fresh veggies for the bed in the pan, and added pats of butter just under the skin of the bird. I slowed the cook time by going with 300°. And let me tell you, it was the best turkey I ever made! Thank you for the basis of this recipe, and never be afraid to add to it a little!!

This is close to how I do my turkey, but I stuff two apples (big slices) in my bird (keeps it super moist). Then when it comes to roasting, cover mine with foil to start with, then uncover for the last hour, basting every 15 mins. Keeps the skin crisp and doesn’t burn.

I didn’t use the celery, onion, or carrots. Also I didn’t have fresh sage. However this is the BEST turkey I’ve ever made. There were no leftovers!!  I did use an oven bag to keep it moist.

I made this with a 14.3 lb turkey and it turned out great! I didn’t have the fresh ingredients to stuff the bird with so I just used the salt mixture. We had stuff to do away from home so I put it in the oven before we left and had it in for between 3-4 hours. I was super pleased with the results! I was able to use the broth in my pan for my gravy and didn’t need to add any seasonings to it.. was great as-is.... super easy recipe for how good the results were!

My cooking abilities are limited to pasta & putting premade meals in the oven. With minimal help I made this turkey & it was delicious. 11.5 pound turkey was in the oven for 2 hours 40 minutes. Thank you so much it was inexpensive & easy to follow!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I always felt completely incompetent to cook a nice turkey but this recipe makes it easy and straightforward and all the flavors are delicious. I didn't have fresh herbs on hand so subbed dry rosemary and thyme. Also didn't have cayenne so subbed red chile powder.

OMG!!!!!! I have cooked many birds before but this recipe beats every recipe I’ve ever done!  (in fact, I threw out every other turkey recipe I have!) No brining, smoking, deep frying to get a super moist, tasty bird—just use this recipe.  The only thing I did do was to cook my 21lb bird an oven bag (due to a time crunch) for about 3 1/2 hours at 350.  I had planned to remove it from the bag and cook it the last half hour uncovered (as oven bagged birds have not given me the golden brown color (see photo—taken just out of  from the oven) I’m looking for), but when I opened the oven my bird was perfect!  Thank you Chef John for this amazing recipe!  Now I look forward to cooking my next turkey instead of dressing it:)

First time cooking a turkey and it's a huge success! Only variation I did is use more butter and next time I might step it up a little more, 6 tablespoons, since the rosemary and sage soak a lot of it up. Not sure if I'm biased since I cooked it but it's the most delicious turkey I've had in my life!

Absolutely wonderful!!!! I did a few things different. I added the salt and peppers to the melted butter instead of sprinkling the seasonings over the buttered turkey, and it came out a beautiful, all over, roasted brown. I did not have sprigs of rosemary, so I used my dried rosemary and sage, lightly chopped, moistened, rubbed inside and place remaining inside the turkey. The gravy was very salty, so I plan to adjust the salt in the giblet broth instead of on the turkey. however, I did not stuff the turkey and that may change the saltiness. I plan to only bake a turkey this way in the future. It was that good!

I make a turkey once every couple weeks as meal prep for my dog and there's no other recipe that tastes as good as this one. Although I swap out the onion for beets for my dogs health I always save my favourite parts of the turkey for myself. The spice mix and cooking time are always perfect and I've never once had any issues. My dog especially gives this recipe 10/10

I’ve made a few turkeys over the years. This is the absolute best one I’ve eve made! I only had to make a minor change. I used dried herbs since I didn’t have fresh. I received a lot of compliments. This recipe is a keeper!!!

Omg!! Poultry is my nemesis!! This has been the best Turkey I have ever done!! Thank you Chef John his recipes never disappoint.  I seasoned my turkey to my liking and injected it with Mojo.  Covered it with bacon weave and stuffed it with a whole apple garlic and half a sour orange. I cooked it at 325° for 3 & half hours it was 15lb pounder at the 3 hour mark I checked for temp, breast was done but legs needed about 5 degrees. I covered the breast with aluminum foil. I did let the bird rest for a good hour before carving... I was amazed at house juice it was and completely cooked... I also tried not to open the oven door at all.

I cooked a turkey using this recipe for Thanksgiving and I was most pleased with it. I followed directions and in return yielded a delicious juicy and beautiful turkey. Everyone enjoyed it and this is now the recipe for me for now on.

This was my first time cooking a turkey, and it was PERFECTION. It was so super juicy and incredibly flavorful. (And I don’t usually like turkey)

I followed others’ advice and 1. lessened the cayenne pepper, and 2. cooked it on 400 flipped breast down for one hour, and then 325 for 2 hours and voila! DeLISH!

Used this recipe to cook my first turkey. It came out amazing! Moist and full of flavor. My stove is small and gets hotter than regular ovens, so I reduced time to be 12 min per pound.

I covered the breast with foil and about halfway through i uncovered it.  This helped keep the breast real moist. The turkey was perfect. By far the best I've made yet.

Delicious. I followed the directions except that I had some thyme to add in and I also cooked mine in a turkey bag, so I followed the temp/time for the bag instead of those here.  Worked very well.  Moist and delicious. The cayenne adds just the right amount of kick.

I followed the instructions and then added a few things.  The instructions are EXTREMELY EASY to follow.  I also made my own stuffing and stuffed the turkey.  I cooked it for almost 3 hours and it came out perfect.  I used a 12 lb turkey and it was moist.  I set it to the temperature indicated.

For the person who says their turkey was not cooked after 3 hours, I would have to say it's the oven.  All ovens are different but most should cook a 12lb turkey after 2 1/2 hours.

I also used the popout timer.  I place one on the thickest part of the thigh and another at the thickest part of the breast.  The thigh timer popped first and then 20 minutes later the breast timer popped.  I left it in the oven, turned off for an additional 10 minutes and the turkey was to perfection.  My guests could not stop complementing how moist and delicious the turkey was.  I am happy with this recipe and will continue to use it.  Also this is the second time in my life I made a turkey.  The first time was 22 years ago, followed a Betty Crocker recipe and this time I used this recipe.  Both times it came out super delicious!

I have been cooking turkeys for many years and they come out pretty well in terms of moisture and flavor. However, I've never been able to cook one where the Turkey looked evenly golden brown and so pretty. This recipe is so easy to follow and I was happy with my results. 

I didn't have fresh sage or rosemary. My go-to store was out. So I mixed 2 teaspoons of ground sage and crushed rosemary into the butter when I melted it. I used the same spices to coat two chopped up celery stalks in a bowl and then stuffed the raw Turkey with the coated celery. That way my Turkey was able to still get a good, aromatic flavor from inside the cavity as it cooked. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you Chef John!

My turkey turned out quite well after all for me. I had mixed all dry ingredients in the butter and I rubbed the Turkey with it and baste a few times during cooking.

Quite good, actually. Thank you for posting. :-)

I made this yet again. It turned out great, again. I love all of the spices, but it does make a gravy that is a little too spicy. I added chicken stock to my gravy this time and less drippings, and it turned out perfectly! I love this recipe. I love chef John, and I am so grateful for this site.

I followed the recipe and it came out looking like something you would see in a magazine. It was so juicy and delicious. Everyone came running with their phones. It was a 25 lb bird and gone the next day.

I made it on a rack instead of on top of veggies. No one could believe how beautifully golden and moist it was! It stayed moist through reheating for multiple days! Saved for my ONLY way to roast a turkey! Its all about the thermometer I think. I am going to buy the oven proof kind just so I dont keep poking it, but it was still PERFECT!

Delicious, but too salty for our taste (and we enjoy salt).
The cayenne pepper was a nice change. If you taste the dry spice mix it will be spicy, but once cooked on the turkey - it was very nice and not at all too spicy.
I used a 16.5 pound turkey and followed the recipe exactly (exception: recipe calls for 12 pound turkey and I only had fine Sea Salt). 
I think had I used this on a 12 pound turkey, I'd be rating it lower than  four stars because it would have been SO salty.
The next time I make this I will reduce the salt to 1 Tablespoon or perhaps slightly rounded Tablespoon.  ( I used Bob's Red Mill Sea Salt. I have used Kosher salt before and although the Kosher was a tad larger grain - I believe it would still have been too salty). 
Next time I make this I will reduce the salt (to amount mentioned above) but,  I will keep everything else as the recipe lists. Also, this recipe would be delicious with a roast chicken in place of turkey.

This turned out good.  Mild herb flavor since the herbs were inside verses rubbed under the skin like other recipes.  I did cover my bird in the beginning  b/c it was a 20lb and I didn't want it to get too brown.  The gravy from the drippings was way too salty for our taste though so I would reduce the salt by half for our taste.

I got all the way to the end and realized we forgot to get white wine.... I subbed light beer (coors light) and it still came out AMAZING. My husband said it's the first 'non boring' turkey he's ever had, lol. I think it was the best turkey I've had too. After the brine sat for 12 hrs I discarded the liquid & let the turkey 'dry out' over night in the fridge... this helps it brown better. It was picture perfect!  It was just 2 of us and a little, so we did a turkey breast & scaled the recipe.

I can't say enough. I never enjoyed turkey until tonight! It was beyond moist and delicious. I seasoned with 1 tbsp salt 1 tbsp pepper and 1 t bsp of my favorite grill seasoning.  I also rubbed some of the herbed butter and rubbed under the skin as well as on the outside.

No more bags, brine, or basting!  This came out perfect with no effort at all!  The hardest part was opening the turkey bag.  lol I give it 6 stars! :)

I wish I could give this 10 stars!! It was SO easy and turned out better than ANY turkey I've ever had. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving since my mom has passed the torch to me and I was worried mine wouldn't turn out like hers does. But she loved it and told me it was the best turkey she had in her whole life. It was a huge compliment and everyone one else felt the same! Look no further for a great recipe!

My family said it was the best turkey I've ever made!  It was easy, the only thing I did differently was use dry sage as I did not have fresh.  Very flavourful!

I added poultry seasoning and cut back on the salt.
The flavor was amazing, and the meat was super tender

This was my first turkey i ever made myself. I have never liked turkey because everyone always cooks it bad and dry and nasty. This was so easy and the flavor was beyond heavenly. Unbelievably juicy. Best turkey ever. Thanks so much.
