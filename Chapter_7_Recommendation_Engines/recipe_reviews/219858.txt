So delicious! Made this cake for my roommate's birthday and it was a huge hit. One of the best basic chocolate cakes I've had!

Much much better than most cake mix chocolate cakes.   Could not find the organic buttery spread so substitute 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter which was cooled.  Seemed to work just fine if someone else out there doesn t have what is called for. Great flavor and texture.

This cake was delicious.  My friend Julie made it on Christmas Day and it was moist and delicious.  We couldn't stop eating it. It would be five stars if it had chocolate chunks in it. :)

Great recipe!  I used Special Dark chocolate pudding and pieces from Hershey's and substituted butter(I'm in WI) for the organic spread and lo-fat vanilla yogurt for the sour cream.  I didn't have a bundt pan so I used 2-8" squares. I added chocolate butter cream frosting between the layers, topped with a dk. choc glaze, strawberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar-Wha-la!

The cake is very good, however, the batter came up through the funnel of the bundt pan and spilled into my oven. Has anyone had this happen?  I did use butter instead of the suggested organic spread, but not as much.

Fabulous chocolate bundt cake! Made it for an adult birthday party and it got rave reviews-very moist and rich! I did use a chocolate fudge cake mix as a base and used the mini chocolate chips  per other reviewers' suggestions. Will definitely make this cake again!

Delicious and easy to make.  I made it for Christmas and decorated it with chocolate glaze and raspberries and it looked very festive.  I added sifted powder sugar over it too.  I used regular melted butter. My family loved it.
