I love soup and this is definitely in our rotation.  I've made it a number of times and I can get even my picky relatives to eat a little.  I don't put the mushrooms in anymore - I love mushrooms and will add them to just about anything but they don't really work in this.  Also, if you feel like cutting the cost or want something more as a side, it's good without the ham, too.  With the ham, it's a great meal all by itself.

This was a different type of soup. My kids are asking when I will make it again. I think the next time I will try it with broccoli instead. And I will also sautee the onions first. I didnt add mushrooms since I dont eat them. We are looking forward to this soup again. It is a little pricey tho. The cheese alone cost was over $5.00, and the ham was $6.00. But it was well worth it.

I don't know - maybe I did something wrong. But my Velveeta didn't melt well with the water, and the soup ended up waaay too watery. I'd try this again, maybe with milk.

Delicious and easy soup! Per the recommendations, I added a little chicken broth for some of the water, and also saut√©ed the onions and ham for a bit before adding them to the soup. I didn't need extra salt (the ham provides enough), but I did add some garlic powder and pepper. I will be making this one again!

I cooked down a ham bone with some chicken stock instead of plain water. I think this gave the soup way more flavor. I only used about half of the velveeta, and it was plenty.Also added a little garlic pepper and salt, because I add that to everything. Very easy and delicious.

Mmmm, comfort food at its best. I added the buillion cube as suggested. I didn't peel the potatoes and that was fine. The mushrooms were great. We will definitely make again!

I had leftover ham and cauliflower and wasn't too hopeful for this recipe, but it was surprisingly good! I gave it a 4 because I thought the mushrooms were kind of nasty in it. It was thick and creamy and pretty fast to prepare. I served it with cornbread. Only changes I made were to use onion powder and I cut back the amounts to make four servings. To me it was less a cauliflower soup than a potato/ham soup. Thanks for the recipe. I will make it again!

My whole family really liked this soup. It is very easy to prepare, and besides cutting up the vegetables doesn't take real long. The soup is very cheesy so if you don't like a lot of cheese, this one is probably not for you. I think I ended up cutting my potatoes too little because they seemed to kind of disappear in the soup and I didn't really notice them. This would be a good recipe to make if you have a lot of leftover veggies to use because any vegetable would be good in here. Thanks for this recipe, Missy!

Very good...I added chicken bouillon cubes to the broth when cooking the cauliflower and potato.
