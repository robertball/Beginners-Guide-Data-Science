Very nice potato salad with thick dressing.  It's appropriately named because it is really creamy.  This recipe had a lot of ingredients, but they all work well together.  I was out of paprika, but I know the visual presentation would have been even nicer with a sprinkle of that.  We enjoyed it!

I have tried quite a few potato salad recipes over the years but always fell back on my wife's recipe because nothing ever came close to how great hers is.  Well, this holiday weekend, she was not feeling well so I decided to try this one and I am so glad I did.  I stuck to the recipe and it is AMAZING.  My 8 year old son and I cook together and whipped this out in no time and even my wife has rated it better than hers.  I took some to our Memorial Day pool party and it was a hit with everyone one there too.

We loved this recipe! I substituted Top the Tater brand sour cream, added four diced radishes, a stalk of fresh chopped celery, some diced green peppers, 2 large diced dill pickles, and 3 tbs pickle juice. (Just like Grandpa Doug's Garden Potato Salad we grew up on!)

Excellent! I halved the recipe, but went with two slices of bacon and two eggs. I also used chopped celery in place of the celery seed. While the potatoes were still warm, I sprinkled a small amount of the vinegar over them hoping to impart more flavor. I just sampled the finished product, and the two cloves of chopped fresh garlic that I used are a big flavor enhancer. I'm sure this will be better after it stands, but I couldn't wait! Thanks for a great recipe, ROCK415.

This is really good but I leave out the celery seed and use finely sliced celery because we like it.  Celery seed is a good alternative for people who (think) they do not like it.  I also like to add some chopped sweet gherkins to this, and sometimes if I do not have enough eggs, use less eggs.

I made it as written and everybody loved it!  The next time I will double the bacon, I used thick sliced bacon which added a great taste and texture but I think it needed more.

I love this  potato salad, and so did all of  my guests.  I took the advice of others and reduce the amount of mustard by 50%.  I also used Dijon as I am not a big fan of yellow mustard

This is my recipe except for the celery seed and I use half the mustard and twice the bacon.  It is truly a meal
when served with salad and crusty bread.

Oh yum, I think I found a new potato salad to put into our meal rotation!  I love this recipe but I wasn't expecting it to be more of a "mustard" potato salad.  The 2 TBS. of yellow mustard seemed very strong when I tasted the dressing.  But once everything was put together and the eggs were added, it really toned down the mustard flavor and came together nicely.  With that said, I do think next time I may half the mustard and add more as needed, or even use half yellow and half dijon or another mustard.  I made the recipe exactly as listed and then added additional tweaks that I think it needed.  The dressing is very creamy like the title suggests, and it makes a lot!  I like a very heavily dressed potato salad, but I thought that for all the dressing that this made, that I could up the potatoes to 2.5 lbs. and also I think it needed more veggies.  So I added in a little diced onion, celery, and bell pepper.  Also I doubled the bacon, doubled the green onion, added in some parsley, and used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine.  YUM!  The recipe as is was deliciously good, but the additional veggies made it even better.  The recipe was a little smaller of a portion than I normally make, but it was enough to feed 3-4 people as a side to a meal.  Also this is great made up right away.  I tried it while it was warm and it was delicious, along with the next day when it was cold.  It was good both ways and this recipe is full of flavor that it really didn't need a "marinating"

This is really delicious.  Made it without bacon as there was a guest opposed to that, gonna be sure to add the bacon next time.  Got lots of compliments on this.  Definitely a keeper!

Embarrassing to say, but this is the first "from scratch" potato salad I've ever made.  Excellent. Chopped celery instead of celery seed and added chopped green pepper for more crunch.  I did add sweet pickle relish, and that was a mistake (and isn't in the recipe).  Served on top of a garden fresh tomato--this is a keeper!

I think I have finally found my go-to potato salad recipe!  Minor changes are:  add 2 stalks finely chopped celery; add 1/4 c. drained sweet pickle relish; increase bacon to 3 slices.
Thanks for the recipe, I've tried many, many potato salads and this is my favorite so far :)

This was a 3.5 star recipe as written.  It was ok, a couple of people liked it, but it was bland and boring.  The next day I took the leftovers and doubled the bacon, salt, and pepper and added about 1/2 a cup each of sweet pickle relish and celery.  After the changes this was a 5 star recipe for sure!

I find onion to be overpowering in this salad; I will leave it out or cut back on the amount next time. Overall; this is a great salad; good consistency.

Wow! I loved this! This is my new favourite potato salad! Couldn't find pimentos, otherwise only other changes was to add some minced garlic and add some red capsicum. Whole family loved this dish. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Very tasty.  We don't like mustard and this was great without it.  I followed the recipe except used real bacon bits rather than taking the time to fry up bacon which we rarely eat.  I mixed all the dressing together the night before as well as boiled small new potatoes, but didn't mix them together until shortly before serving.  Will make it again.

Totally love it.   Made very minor changes. Since I am an egg lover, I added 1 more egg, a little less sour cream and more green onions.  Definitely will make it again.
