This is from the original poster, Mrs.Wolfie. This was my grandmothers recipe dated back to the mid-1940's. I posted as she wrote it on a recipe card. Some of the ingredients and steps may seem archaic so I wanted to make sure you all understood this is a 50 year plus recipe. The changes mentioned are nice and I'm glad so many are enjoying it. My family still prefers it the way Clatie made it.. I'm sure she is thrilled this simple recipe she made up has garnered this much attention!

Update II: Yummy and satisfying as is. I do admit to sneaking in extra sour cream cuz I LOVE it! What a great way to use a pound of ground beef on a cold winter night.Update!!! This time I made it with Italian sausage and used just one can of the tomato sauce . Since I was using sausage, I cut the salt in half. I sauteed the onion before mixing it in with the sourcream/cream cheese mixture. Topped with mozarella. Great results and I thin I will try it with chorizo and mexican cheeses next time. I can see so many possibilities for grandmas homestyle casserole. I have to add that the review by the "Versatile Foodie" seems hardly fair. She reviewed this as if it was some fine wine or gourmet recipe. This is NOT that kind of recipe and I don't think it has been represented that way. This is just one of those old fashioned simple casseroles that calls for easily attained and simple ingredients. Nothing fancy schmancy, just good stick to the ribs family pleasing casserole. Thanks for sharing LaDonna and Grandma!

I made this casserole last night with a couple of very small moderations. 
Instead of chopping or dicing the onion, ( an entire sweet yellow onion ) I put it in my mini chopper and pureed it. 
I made the recipe with Prego@ Traditional spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I topped the casserole with sharp cheddar, romano and parmesan cheeses. 
I loved this casserole, but better yet, my husband and grandson loved it too. ( my husband usually doesn't like casseroles. and doesn't like spaghetti. ) We had enough left for lunch today and it's even better the day after. This is a keeper. We loved it.

This was a great find.  The layers of sour cream, cream cheese, and onion really set off the flavor of this simple dish.  The family really enjoyed it and leftovers weren't left over for very long.  I imagine that many readers will find ways to tweak this recipe with additional ingredients.  I prepared it exactly to the recipe and  would argue that no adjustments are necessary.

I am trying to lose weight and am careful with my calories so I played with this. I used lean ground beef, switched the sour cream for fat free yogurt, used low fat cream cheese diced tomatoes instead of sauce and low fat mozzarella and I was able to make a very satisfying dish, true to the intent of the recipe and 25% fewer calories.  I did add spinach to the cream cheese layer and fresh garlic because I had no garlic salt.  There was plenty of flavor and as someone else pointed out this is a perfect recipe to your own taste.  Thanks, Mrs. Wolfie we enjoyed this.

Great recipe, just make sure to undercook the pasta, otherwise it ends up a bit mushy.

Found this as I had ground beef already cooking on the stove with a vague idea that I was going to cook SOME kind of casserole. I am always looking for new additions to our weekly routine and this one fit the bill nicely.  I expected it to be a bigger hit with my small children, but my husband and I both enjoyed it immensely.  I added canned peas and fresh chopped carrots as well as parsley, and I cooked most of the onion with the beef and only added a small amount to the cheese/sour cream mixture.  I will make this again, but sparingly.  This is firmly in the comfort food department and can't be very waistline friendly...which is why it tastes so good!

Very tasty dish although I noticed there were very few herbs or spices involved. I made some additions: 2 tsp. dried basil and fresh black pepper to taste. The sour cream mixture makes the dish creamy and adds lightness. I would make it again.

This recipe was easy and and a hit with my family. I did have a few modifications. I use ground turkey instead of beef.  While browning the turkey, I added some minced garlic and the diced onion. I also used a jar of spaghetti sauce versus the tomato sauce and sugar. I traded the egg noodles for a box of rotini pasta and used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. To make it extra cheesy, I added Parmesan cheese to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.

This was a big hit.  I added more sugar to tone down the tomato sauce (I forgot I had some spaghetti sauce I could have used), and added some oregano and pepper. I mixed the first layer of noodles and sour cream mixture with some cheese, then layered the rest according to the instructions.  A green salad along with garlic bread made for a very good dinner.

I make this a little differently and it's to die for.  I use 2 lbs ground beef. 1 pint of sour cream, 1 11 oz of whipped cream cheese and 1 bunch of chopped green onions.  I use Chinese noodles ( looks like spegetti).  I put noodles in a 13x9 dish then the cream cheese  mixture then tomato mix then cheese and refrigerate overnight.  Cover in foil.  Bake 350 for 40 min and take foil off and  cook 5 min more.  It is super yummy??

I was worried when I was preparing this because I taste tested the sauce and it seemed very salty, I did not care for it, but proceeded exactly as recipe indicated.  I then taste tested sour cream/cream cheese/onion portion and not terribly impressed with that either.  I continued with recipe exactly as called for and baked.  Did not have high expectations but after baking it -- it was transformed!  I mean it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  We loved it!  It is true comfort food and will be delish on a cold winter night with good crusty bread.  My son said it was the best thing I've ever made!  I was tempted to brown onion with ground beef as I am not a fan of onions but was so glad I didn't because that  combination of onion, sour cream and cream cheese was outstanding!  Really made the dish unique.  And, come on, this was Grandma's recipe and who second guesses Grandma's cooking?  She knows best every time!  This recipe is going in my rotation for Fall/Winter dinners.  Excellent!

Comfort food at it's best! I made this last evening for dinner and it was GREAT!! I normally follow recipes to a T the first time I make them - and for this I did, except for the garlic salt (I used garlic powder) and I added some dried parsley to the meat sauce mixture. I also did find that I needed more of the cream cheese/sour cream mixture, as I didn't have enough for the one layer, so I used the entire 8oz package of cream cheese and the entire container of sour cream - (unless I read the recipe wrong?? I couldn't find a 3oz package of cream cheese?!? so got an 8oz package) - so I doubled the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.
I will definitely make this again! My roommate loved it too! Thanks!

Usually this kind of recipe is not something I cook. I'm not much for gulah & casseroles but I decided to try it anyway. It was actually really good!!! Next time I will cut the cream cheese down a bit and probably mix the meat sauce with the sour cream & cream cheese just to ensure it's mixed a little better. Otherwise it was delish &  a hit with the family!

I needed a recipe for ground beef and this looked simple. My husband and I both liked it. Lots of flavor. Although, I could see my younger grandchildren not liking the sour cream and onion. I'll definitely make this again, but I'll use garlic powder instead of garlic salt as I thought it was a bit salty. My husband didn't agree, he liked it as is. The only change I made was using kluski noodles (heavier noodle) instead of egg noodles because that's all I had on hand and I didn't have quite the 8oz. so there was more sauce and sour cream mixture than would have been. Oh, and I didn't wait until the sauce mixture was room temp. I just didn't have the time. I don't see where that changed anything. My only criticism is the amount of dirty dishes necessary to make the recipe. On the up side, it's a do ahead kind of meal and I can see where you can add various vegetables to make the dish more interesting. I'd add some zucchini or eggplant to kick it up a notch. I would even feel comfortable serving this to company. Just add a loaf of good Italian bread and you're good to go.

Very yummy. The second time I added a little more sugar and garlic salt and a pre-made spaghetti sauce instead of just plain tomato sauce and like that a lot better. The recipe as-is is a little bland for my taste, but overall a delicious addition to my family's menu.

I didn't expect to like this but made it because I had all the ingredients in the house and needed something for dinner.  My husband and I really loved it.  I'll definitely make it again. The only think I added was a layer of cheddar after the first layer of beef otherwise I followed the recipe.

This was one of the better casseroles on this website with a few minor changes.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream.  I used 2 cups mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and double the cream cheese.  And mixed about 1 cup of the mozzarella in with the sour cream/cream cheese/onion mix.  I think it's important to do the layers as stated and not mix the noodles in with the sauce ahead of time.  That way you get the pockets of flavor from the sauce and cheese/onion mix, and it almost tastes like a lasanga.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and not mushy using extra large egg noodles and cooked only 5 minutes in the water.  We will definitely make this again... It's also important to use a good tomato sauce because the dish will taste totally different depending on how good your sauce is.  We used MIDS traditional sauce.

Way too much salt!  That is all we could taste.  I wonder if the contributor meant garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  My kids would not eat it.

Just a note: This recipe takes longer to "prep" than it states, since the item that simmers for 20 minutes is supposed to cool to room temperature before adding to the casserole dish. I didn't understand why, so I used it hot off the stove. This recipe is also very dish-heavy: a skillet to brown beef (and simmer tomato sauce), a pot to boil noodles (and a colander to drain them and/or the beef), and a casserole dish. I used a crock-pot to brown the beef, then reused it to bake the casserole. I also reused the pasta pot to simmer the sauce. I know that doesn't matter to everyone, but I was surprised by how much longer it took to get to the oven (than the 20 minutes stated), as well as by how it totaled out my available dishes while being a fairly "simple" dish. Waiting now for it to come out of the oven to see what my guys think of it. I'm cooking for hubby (with a small appetite due to recent surgery), 2 teenage boys, and 2 lower elementary age girls. 
Well, the unanimous vote was that it wasn't bad, but just nothing to write home about. We couldn't figure out whether to think of it as Mexican (because of the sour cream & cheese), or Italian (because of the noodles and tomato) or American (because of the onion and cream cheese). We all ate it... we were starved by the time it was finally done! So oh, well. If I try it again I will severely tweak it! Good taste, but not exciting enough to warrant the investment of time and dishes!

I've made this at least 3 times now. My husband LOVES it. It's great reheated too. Like most reviewers, I cook the onion with the beef. I thought it was too salty the first time I made it so now I leave out the garlic salt and use minced garlic instead. I also like to add oregano and black pepper to the tomato sauce. I also use much more than 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. What can I say? We love cheese!

Good comfort food.  I enjoyed this & my fiance liked it so much he asked if he could take all of the leftover's to work.  Well, I gave him a large portion, but this girl needs to eat too!  I thought this may have been too salty with 1 t of salt & 1 t of garlic salt, so I omitted the salt then added 3/4 t of garlic powder instead (we love garlic).   I sauteed the onions in 1 T of butter before I added them & I'm glad that I did because they were still slightly crunchy when this was done.  I also used plain yogurt and increased the cream cheese to approx 5 oz. and added colby on top instead of cheddar (what we had on hand).  The cooking time was accurate & I was sure to not to overcook the noodles as previous reviews stated.  End result was a great weeknight meal.  The only thing I did not look forward to is all of the dishes.  Thanks for submitting.

Time consuming but amazing!  We cook the onions prior to putting them in the dish.

Very good!
I personally, think spaghetti sauce would be too sweet.
Waaaay, too much onion and I like alot of onion and I used probably what is considered a medium onion.
DO NOT OVERCOOK NOODLES!!

I finally got kudos from my husband and mother-in-law! I pretty much don't know how to cook, but I could easily follow this recipe. And it was delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time is add a little more sour cream and cream cheese. We like our cheese!

This was delicious.  It really is a clean-out-the-fridge kind of dish.  I used ground turkey, linguine instead of egg noodles, and diced tomatoes rather than tomato sauce.  I also had to use onion powder b/c I was out of onions.  I ended up throwing in a little bit of leftover vodka sauce with the meat and tomato mixture.  I also added some grated parmesan and Italian seasoning with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture, and threw some frozen peas between the two layers.  Husband, 4yo, and toddler all ate it up.  Thank you for sharing a great starting point.

This was wonderful. I am sure that kids would love this as much as adults. I think the sour cream mixture is the secret to this recipe. This is going on my top recipes list. I made two adjustments because I didn't have the ingredients on hand and a third personal preference. 1. Swapped out a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and about 2/3 can of tomato paste for the tomato sauce. 2. Used pasta in place of egg noodles. 3. Slightly sauteed onions before adding to sour cream mixture. This recipe easily feeds 4 adults as a stand alone dish. This would make a great pot-luck dish as it would be easy to reheat. Thanks for the recipe MrsWolfie!!!  P.S. The second time I made it I used Tomato Soup by mistake and it was also wonderful but a little sweet so I would omit the sugar.

I chopped my onions in the blender and added cream cheese and sour cream.  Made a smooth mixture and the onions were blended in easily.

This casserole is one of my husband's favorites. Quick, easy, a big hit at our house. The onions mixed with cream cheese and sour cream give it a wonderful sweet accent. Two thumbs up.

Fantastic dish! We doubled the cream cheese and sour cream to make it a bit thicker of a layer.  Flavours were amazing, and will be reheating the leftovers today!

The basic recipe is wonderful and the family enjoyed it! The second time I made it though I added a few things for more taste. Instead of the sugar, I used honey. When mixing the sour cream, cream cheese and onions... I added diced green bell pepper and red bell peppers. I layered it by mixing the noodles+meat+sauce together then the cream sauce with the onions and peppers. Finished it with the meat mix; then topped it with shredded cheese. My family loves it this way.

This was delicious! I was looking for a recipe my mom used to make and this seemed similar. I browned the onions with the meat. I added a little extra salt, some black pepper, about a tsp of worcestershire, and oregano. Because I had two pounds of meat, I used about 3/4 of a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes as well. Yum!

This rating is not technically fair... but I have to say one warning to other people that try this recipe:
Saute the onions first!! Either with the beef or alone with the cheese and sour cream. 

Otherwise, you end up with a very "oniony" tasting dish, which some people may like, but I personally do not like one bit. 

If I had done this, the dish would have been amazing. Since I did not, it was a complete disaster that I ended up throwing out, again, i am not a big fan of only half-cooked, large quantities of onions.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. So happy I tried it as written (well, mostly.) I had to sub the cheddar for Mozzarella!
The cream cheese and sour cream had me questioning if it would be good or kind of blah... *Spoiler alert : Delicious! 
Minor changes: Sautéed onion with ground beef. Added wayyy more spices than recipe called for (loaded up on Italian, plus red pepper flakes). 
With pasta in colander, I threw the chunk of cream cheese in the (still hot) pot to mix with the sour cream. Blended, then stirred in pasta.
Didn't bother layering (who has the patience?) so my egg noodles with creamy cheese went down first, with sauce and meaty goodness next. Oh, and I did test out cheddar cheese on one itty bitty little corner of the pan. That made a huge difference  (nobody liked it). Mozzarella for the win with this one! Yum, yum, yum!

I found it very easy recipe to customize to my tastes and what I had of leftovers in my fridge. I added a green pepper, some garlic and basil. I usually make the recipe exactly as written the first time but this one screamed to personalise it and since I love green peppers, garlic and basil I added them. I am not an expert chef but I do know it will taste better (to me) if I add things I like. Thanks for the idea for the recipe. I will make a version of this again.

Puh-leeze!  Omit the sugar!  I also added some thin sliced celery and half a can of whole kernel corn.  Really makes this a one dish meal.  A dash of Worcestershire sauce is a good addition too,

I was a bit worried about my husband's reaction to the cream cheese/sour cream combo since he's not a fan of either - but he said this was awesome "lasagna" and the cheese I used was amazing. Between him and our teenager - none was left!

Made this with my 11yo last night and it was delicious. Added spinach and mushroom, used a jar of tomato basil sauce instead of seasonings and tomato sauce, used Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar but it was still amazing and has gone to my favorites file.

I agree with mauigirl, this is kid friendly, basic comfort food. It's not gourmet, but perfect for a family with young kids. I found the measurements work best in a 2qt, 11x7 casserole dish.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and we really liked it.  It's creamy and delicious.  I am sure left overs will be just as good if not better.  If you feel like comfort food and something easy to make for your family for dinner... this is wonderful.  BUT if you are being health conscious this probably isn't the recipe for you.

Family didn't like it as much which was crazy.  Husband would have liked it better with finer diced onions.  I had leftover ham so I diced that up and added it in too.  Delicious!

Believe it or not, my family has had the same recipe over  several decades.  We call it Hungry man Casserole.  Like you I have changed it up a little depending on what I have, but yeah...this is it.  I have 8 kids and this is the one recipe that everyone loves.
Wonderful!

Easy delicious recipe.  I did add more noodles closer to a 16 oz package to ensure bottom and middle layers in my 9x13 pan.  Also I chose to cook my onion with ground beef verses raw in cream layer.  Absolutely will be making this again.

My husband loves this!  The only tweak I made was that instead of using plain tomato sauce and adding in the spices, I simply used Hunts spaghetti sauce (traditional).  We had leftovers (only 2 of us) but that meant I had easy lunch/ supper options later.  A definite keeper.

I made no changes, it was dry and the onions were raw after 45 minutes in the oven. It went to the garbage, I could not eat it. Was a peanut butter and jelly night.

Comfort food favorite.  I made this with no changes and it was a big hit.  My husband is usually pretty picky about new recipes, but he loved this one.  It is worth sharing.

I did make some changes. First I used half a green pepper and half an onion with a large clove of garlic and sautéed them before adding them to the sour cream mixture. I seasoned the sour cream mixture with salt, pepper, garlic powder and garlic salt. I used one can diced tomatoes and one can tomato sauce. And seasoned the ground beef the way instructed but added garlic powder and basil. My kid ate all of it which isn't normal. I will definitely keep this recipe to make again, although I may substitute yogurt for the sour cream to make it a little lighter.

Made many changes to the recipe to make it healthier (and zestier!).  When sautéing the beef, I mixed in other green veggies I had lying around like broccoli, green peppers, etc.  To give it a little spice, I diced up jalapeno and threw that in as well.  Instead of mixing the onion with the creamy mixture, I cooked it in with the beef.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used two cans of diced tomatoes to give it a more chunky texture.  Also, instead of garlic salt I cooked in two minced cloves of garlic.

As for the cream mixture, I used low fat cream cheese and 1 cup of nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

Easy, quick substitutions made this much lighter on the plate and on the stomach (and in my opinion, tastier!)

I did not have tomato sauce in the pantry, just diced tomatoes. I used 1/2 lb ground turkey and 1/2 lb. ground beef. We will make this again.

I doubled this recipe, and substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of a second can of tomato sauce.  My kids and husband loved this recipe, and that's pretty good for all of them to like it!

It was ok. Not as good as I expected but I will be adding to it next time. I followed exactly so I am reviewing the actual recipe. Also it is delicious the second day and it's a great base recipe to fiddle with and make your own. I think I would add more cheese on top and use Italian sausage next time.

Only changes were that I put the onion in with the browning beef and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Next time I'll double the sour cream/cream cheese mixture. Pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.

This recipe takes a lot longer than the recipe indicates and uses a LOT of dishes. I got frustrated trying to layer the noodles and spread the cream cheese mixture on it so I dumped the noodles & cream cheese mixture into the pot with the beef and sauce. I mixed it well and poured into the casserole dish then topped with cheese as directed. The dish was very good and comforting.

I've been sick with pneumonia all week, so I haven't been to the store -or even outside. I made it from what I had on hand. I used sour cream, cream cheese, and grated parmesan with some Italian seasoning. Grated parmesan on top. This was actually very good and I'll make it again.

I don't normally review a dish I haven't prepared several times but I won't be making this one again.  With that said my husband liked it.  Maybe it could be better with a few changes.  Less sour cream, more cream cheese.  Add some veggies to it, maybe red peppers or zucchini.  Add some seasonings to the cream cheese sour cream mixture.  It is a clean out the fridge kind of meal. The only thing I had to purchase with sourcream, but wasn't impressed with the finished product.

I read almost all the reviews before making this. So many were positive, I thought I'd give it a try, even though I was hesitant about the egg noodles. Egg noodles in what is basically an Italian dish? I made it almost exactly to instruction (only sauteeing the onion and adding spices to the beef). The only part I liked was the meat sauce. The egg noodles were a killer. Really gross texture and taste. If I ever make this again, I'd do it with penne or even bowtie, any kind of pasta but egg noodles.

I really enjoyed this. Next time, though, I will saute the onions before adding to the cream cheese/sour cream. I think it's just a matter of preferring cooked onions to raw ones. I used my favorite spaghetti sauce in a jar. That sour cream and cream cheese layer is what makes this very very good. Thank you!

It was ok. Good flavor, but onions were not cooked. Nothing worse than crunchy uncooked onions. I was tempted to cook the onions with the ground beef. Wish I would have. I also seasoned the ground beef to taste while cooking. Otherwise, I think it would have too bland. But crunchy onions, the worst. Put back in oven, to try to cook onions. Hopefully, that will make it better.

The recipes says to mix the chopped onion with the cream cheese and sour cream. I would have cooked the onions with the hamburger, because they were not cooked, and were crunchy. I also would not have layered it. I would have mixed the sour cream & cream cheese with all  the noodles , then poured the hamburger/tomato sauce over the noodles. If it weren't for the onions not being cooked, it would be delicious.

This was excellent.  I agree with other posters to use mozzarella instead of cheddar and spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and can eliminate the sugar.  Was a favorite in our house. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was the ultimate comfort food and SO tasty. I bought a whole 8oz block of cream cheese, and I didn’t want it to go to waste, so I used the whole thing and mixed it with 2 cups of sour cream. So glad I did. My egg noodles came in a 12 oz bag, so I used the whole thing there too. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and it still tasted great. I used a jar and a half of Ragu pasta sauce for the tomato sauce, and topped the whole thing with mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. It definitely used up a lot of pots/pans/bowls, but it was pretty darn good.

The only reason I rated this a 3 is the fact the onions were nor fully cooked when I took it out of the oven.  Sauteing the onions with the ground beef would be an improvement.  The flavors were good and I will try it again.

It is a good recipe. Easy and quick with appropriate prep. Next time I make it, I will double the amount of cream cheese and use more noodles. It just seemed like there was way more meat and sauce than noodles required.

I made this recipe with a few revisions. First I used ground turkey ,then instead of sour cream, I used Greek yogurt, I did not put regular or kosher salt in it, however I did put several other no salt spices in with the meat when I cooked it. I also sauteed the onions with the ground turkey  instead of leaving them to mix with the yogurt  and cream cheese mixture. I used no salt tomato sauce and instead of the regular tomato sauce Palma and instead of cheddar cheese,  I used yogurt cheese slices. I also added half a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and a can of no salt stewed tomatoes. It turned out perfect and delicious and a lot healthier. The first version had like 1,500 mg of sodium per serving, after my revisions, it was down to less than 500 mg per serving.

This was delicious. I had a roll of breakfast sausage that needed to be used, so I made it with a pound of beef AND a pound of breakfast sausage, and I threw in a can of Rotel for a little added flavor. It was delicious

Great recipe!  I thought it was a little salty.  Soften the cream cheese at the beginning right away.  Boil your water while you cook your hamburg.  It’s a quick made yummy and warm recipe especially for New Englanders!

Perfect just the way it is. I dumped a LOT more cheese on it just because I felt like it and I think it made it better, of course.  Recommended.

This was really good! I will add this to my recipe book and make again when in need of a comfort food casserole.  The only two changes I made was to use a seasoning blend with salt, pepper, and garlic (rather than the salt and garlic salt).  I also used two jars of tomato sauce canned from our garden last summer.  I also softened the cream cheese for about 30 seconds in the microwave before adding in the sour cream and onion.

This recipe was amazing! Very different, my whole family liked it. The only thing I would do differently is to soften the cream cheese prior so it blends in the mixture smoothly. My daughters did not like having the chunks of cream cheese in it and it does not melt in the oven like the other cheeses. This is just a texture/taste preference for my family. Otherwise, we loved this new recipe!

Super good! I knew when I saw it was a 'grandmas's recipe' it would be good. Older recipes are best.

I followed it except for I waited to put the cheese on top until the last 5 minutes so it was melted but not brown.

I don't normally make or like casseroles, but I really need some new meal ideas. This one will get made again.   =)

This recipe  brought us to our childhood. It was terrific just as written. Next time I will cut down the onions, that would be the only change I would make. Will definitely make this again!

I think it turned out yummy but my roommate didn't like it. He said the onion overpowered the taste so next time I'm going to fry the onions before I mix them in and use less onion. I used Philadelphia cream cheese

I’ve made this recipe to many times to count. Once as the recipe says and then tweaking it each time I made it. I use jarred tomato sauce and sautee the onions with garlic. Instead of layering it which is good I’ll admit, I mix everything together, spoon it into the casserole dish then top with a mixture of jack and cheddar. So good!

Sorry but this was bland and runny. The tomato sauce overpowered the entire casserole. Suggestions for improvement: Use 1 can of diced tomatoes with seasoning plus add additional seasoning in the Italian family.  Use 1 small onion, not a large one.

Big Hit!!  Perfect dinner for a cold night & easy to put together.  I used 1 can of petite diced and 1 can of sauce - it's a casserole, tweak it to what you have on hand.  I'll be making this again in the coming months.  Serve with some nice homemade biscuits.

Thanks for the recipe LaDonna

I liked this recipe, but I really felt it was missing something to make it stand out, so I added some sliced jalapeños on top, and ended up added even more on the side after I realizing how good it was. Also used a jar of marinara sauce instead of the tomato sauce cans and sugar— heard from a chef on TV once that those exact ingredients are interchangeable!

I am actually rather shocked that this recipe has received so many positive reviews. I just made it for the first time and followed the instructions exactly as written. Not only did it turn out to be a soupy mess, but it is much too salty and even regardless of the salt, it just does not taste good at all. I feel bad for saying this, but honestly, even Chef Boyardee tastes better than this. :( I don't know what could possibly be done to make this taste good, but I will definitely never be making this again. My husband and son both agreed that it does not taste good at all.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  I have made it several times with great success. We like it spaetzle noodles instead of flat egg noodles. They hold up very well and adds wonderful texture to the dish. This time, I used a marinara sauce, spaetzle noodles, and 1/3 ground beef to 2/3 ground turkey. Drained the meat in the middle of cooking, then finished it very browned. It tastes like steak! This is by far our favorite casserole.

Made a warm meal enjoyed by all.  I did modify slightly using 1 can condensed tomato soup and 1 can whole tomatos (pureed in blender).  This just happened to be what I had and it turned out as I would have expected.  Although I didn't do this, but I have seen a similar recipe add bread crumbs to the top instead of cheese.  Both would have worked.

I made some changes. I added 4 oz. of herb and garlic cream cheese instead of 3oz. of regular cr. chs. I also added about half a cup of cottage cheese. Then to the meat I added pepper, paprika and oregano and instead of just tomatoes, I substituted 1 of the tomatoes with salsa. I put in fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. My husband insisted I write in the changes so I wouldn’t forget what I did. It was a big hit.

Made it just like the recipe except that I didn’t have a cup of sour cream so only used what I had which was maybe 1/3C of sour cream. In my opinion it was only okay; nothing special. Too much tomato sauce I think for me. Doesn’t need the sugar. My husband likes it though. Not sure I would make it again. If I do I’ll probably use a jar or two of pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce. Not bad; just not great.

I give this 5 stars for being a wonderful base recipe that can be varied in many ways, as I can see from the other reviews. Personally,  I added extra sour cream and no cream cheese. I also fried the hamburger with Sofrito and that gave it a little extra zing. I also mixed shredded cheese into the sour cream. It was a hit here at my house.

This was mouth- watering! My family wanted the leftovers for every meal. I substituted fire roasted diced tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce because I was out. I just put the can in the chopper.  I added an Anaheim pepper and extra seasoning. Delicious!

Just the creamy, cheesy, gooey casserole I was craving! It was getting late, and I was tired, so I didn't do the layers. I let the meat mixture cool off, and then in the same pan stirred in the sour cream mixture and noodles. Covered the top with cheese and baked. Turned out nicely.

This was a hit and I will make it again.  I cooked the onions with the hamburger and omitted the sugar.  I also added a little bit of grated Parmesan/Romano cheese to the sour cream and cream cheese mixture. I had some trouble layering the mixture, so I mixed it with the noodles and then added the sauce. I then added sharp cheddar/mozzarella cheese.  It turned out great! I also added some other seasonings.

Oh yeah...I’m calling this Grandma’s Kitchen Sink Casserole! Love the idea of using up what you have on hand. I used a jar of spaghetti sauce I had and added a can of garlic basil tomato paste. I used up a 1/2 bag of sharp cheddar (middle layer) and 1/2 bag of mozzarella and some left over Parmesan cheese (top layer) I found the cream cheese/sour cream layer hard to spread so I just tossed the egg noodles in that mixture to coat them evenly. II sautéed the onion in with the ground beef instead of raw in the cream cheese mixture. We all loved this recipe, thank you!

This was so delicious!  I made the following changes:  used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, eliminated the salt in the recipe (it was plenty salty), added 1/2 tsp each of oregano and basil, and used 4 oz. instead of 3 oz. cream cheese and added some fresh spinach.  I will use 12 oz. of egg noodles next time, I didn't think 8 oz. was enough.  There are so many variations you could do on this recipe.  I will definitely
 be making this again.

Vintage recipes interest me. After having this recipe in my Favorites for awhile, I decided to make it. Since I only had one can of tomato sauce, I chopped up a beefsteak tomato and added it to the sauce. I used a red onion instead of white and left out the salt, since I used the garlic salt. This was good. It had a vintage flavor. Quite acidic.

I love, love, love this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it. I’ve used different kinds of noodles depending what I had on hand. I doubled the cream cheese. This gets rave reviews every time.

This recipe actually does taste like somrthing my mom made when I was small. We liked it, but my husband thoight it was a little bland. The second time I made it I took the recipe writer at her word and used what I had on hand. I seasoned the hamburger with onion and garlic powder while it was cooking. I also cooked the onion with the meat.  I used left over jarred spagetti sauce with a small can of tomato sauce. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of minced garlic from the jar to the meat sauce while it simmered. I used whole wheat wide noodles.  My family liked this version better. You really can't mess this recipe up!

This is great and family friendly. I made a few changes: saute the onions, used ground turkey and topped with mozzarella cheese.  Very yummy and filling! Made great leftovers!

This was a great recipe.  To the creamy layer I added thin sliced summer squash, Italian squash and mushrooms. Just because I like to hide and disguise my vegetables in flavorful goodness.

Although this was really good. The ingredients are way off for a 9x13 dish. I didn’t have enough sauce or sour cream/cream cheese mixture. I would definitely lay off on the salt though, way too salty. I used elbow noodles instead of egg noodles.

This was horrible. The garlic over-powered all other flavors. If I ever make this again, which is doubtful, I'd leave out the garlic.

The only substitution I made was using ground turkey instead of ground beef, and chopped frozen onions as I don’t do well with chopping them! Two thumbs up from the husband! This oldie but goodie recipe is delicious!

Thanks for the recipe. We really didn't care for the flavor combination of cream cheese and sour cream with what is a basic lasagna meat sauce. The sauce had a good flavor and I may use it with noodles again.

Loved it!  The only (very minor) changes I made was adding a little Parmesan cheese to the sour cream mixture and adding a little Italian seasoning to the red sauce.  Other than that I made it as written and everyone loved it!

This dish was just “okay”. I wouldn’t make it again without adjusting the recipe. First, it had too much sauce for my taste. The right amount of meat, but I’d cut back the tomato sauce by 1/4-1/2 cup. Second, it definitely needed more seasonings. Last, I thought the sour cream flavor was overpowering, so I’d switch the ratio of that and the cream cheese. My family loved it though.

Delicious and simple to make!  I liked that I had most of the ingredients at home already.  I did not use cream cheese, so I subbed heavy cream and mozz cheese in the sour cream mixture , and it was still delicious.  Next time, I'll add the onions to the ground beef so they come out cooked.  I also added chopped garlic to the ground beef.  I think next time, I'll try green peppers in the ground beef as well.

I have a similar recipe I have been making for years. I omit the sugar (never noticed the difference) and use tomato paste instead of sauce for a more rich flavor. In recent years my husband and I have become sensitive to onions so will use a scallion/green onion flavored cream cheese OR sour cream instead. Works just as well.

The recipe l used to make was pretty much the same casserole but was called "Hamburger Hurrah" & everyone who ate it loved it. The one thing different was the onion. Mine called for chopped Green Onion & also for a 2 tsp. of crushed garlic instead of the garlic salt.
These differences didn't change the casserole too much & was still deee-liscious! Try it - you'll love it too?

I combined a garlic and herb smear with regular cream cheese and it gave it an extra kick. This recipe yields more servings than required for just my husband and me so I shared it with co-workers and family and they loved it. A couple of people asked for the recipe so it must be good!!!

Good basic recipe reminds me of a  recipe called dairy casserole that use cottage cheese  sour cream and cheddar cheese This recipe adds onion at the bottom of recipe ingredients then does not mention it in the directions must be a typo or last second add in. I fry my ground beef and onion together add garlic powder not garlic salt and omit sugar can add whatever you like green pepper mushrooms celery etc can use sausage  instead of ground beef even left over pork roast I have done this and it is very good!

Surprisingly different with the cream cheese/sour cream with raw onions! I used more of the cream cheese, sour cream, and tomatoes. I didn't have tomato sauce so I put diced tomatoes in my Magic Bullet and it worked good! Also used diced tomatoes and spiced it up a bit. I will make this again.

I doubled the recipe and made it in a 1/2 sheet pan.  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese, ricotta and sour cream and blended in melted cheese.  I also used Prego spaghetti sauce with mushrooms.  I sautéed the ground sirloin with mixed bell peppers and onions.  The family loved it.  Similar to Million dollar spaghetti, but with a slightly different taste because of the egg noodles.

I made this as written and enjoyed it. Is it a recipe for a 5 Star restaurant? Nope. But it's definitely a 5 Star recipe for some of those busy weeknights. What I loved the most was the leftovers. A couple of days later it was even much better and in fact, I will probably ad this to my **Sunday afternoon casserole marathon**... All those things you can get ready to pop in the oven or microwave during the busy week ahead. For this casserole you only need to add a salad, a green veggie and you've got a great dinner on the table in 15 minutes!

I see a lot of people liked this recipe, but NOONE in my house liked this and I made it exactly as the recipe stated with fresh ingredients.  Noone (including myself) would eat the leftovers and I had to through it out.  Won't be making it again.  Sorry Grandma.

Wonderful. I did cook the onion with the beef. I also used an Italian cheese blend on top.  Definitely a keeper and I will make again.

I was looking for a recipe my mom made, and I as a young mother cooking for a family of five - but I lost the recipe. I found this, which was very close. I used garlic and olive oil spaghetti sauce, added , salt and pepper  when frying the meat, used green onions instead of white, 6 oz. cream cheese instead of 3, and added  garlic salt and pepper to the cream cheese mixture. I also used  sharp cheddar between layers and on top. Delicious, just like my memories! Thank you.

This was good as written. Next time, I will saute the onions along with the beef (they were a little too crunchy), and add a bit more tomato sauce, perhaps another small 6 oz can because we like a lot of sauce.

Love this!  The only thing I change out is use spaghetti sauce from a jar (something I rarely do as I prefer my own homemade but like to keep a jar on hand for quick use) and in doing such I leave out the sugar and salt.    I agree with another review who loves the onions raw in the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  I do too!   I just mince them very small  and use only about half a small onion.   I love how this recipe can be made in stages,  i.e., cool the beef mixture before moving to the next step, slightly cool the noodles, etc.   On weekends that gives me time to enjoy a glass of wine between steps.   Thank you for sharing your grandma's wonderful recipe!    So good with some garlic bread!   (PS:I also love MauiGirl's suggestion for Italian Sausage or Chorizo!  Can't wait to try those!)

Needed to be baked a lot longer than 25-30 min.  Wasn't HOT when I took it out of the oven.  Of course, I didn't know that until we started eating it.  Also, I thought the cream cheese & sour cream would have dispersed throughout the noodle mixture, but it just sat there and wasn't mixed in.  I would bake it at least an hour,  cover with foil and put cheese on for last 10 min. to melt.

This is not a keeper.  The onions need to be cooked before adding to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  I did not like the still raw taste of onions in this recipe.

The origination of this recipe is interesting. I used to make this often in the late 70's, early 80's. My recipe came from the Mueller's Classic Recipes. I don't see much difference except for fresh garlic and 1 cup cheddar cheese. It's a great recipe. I'll have to start making again.

1 word?  OUTSTANDING!  I used Mid's spaghetti sauce and DID add 1 tsp. sugar to it (I think it cut down on the bitterness sauce sometimes has, but did not change the flavor).  I added mozzarella cheese to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  Boil  the noodles ONLY 5 minutes and start the timer before the 2nd boil after adding the noodles - it came out perfect (not mushy at all).  Having a hard time layering the cheese mix over the 1st layer of noodles was tricky, so I just mixed it all together, added a layer of mozzarella cheese, then the sauce as directed.  The 2nd layer of cheese mixture was easier to layer over the 2nd layer of noodles for some reason and glad I took the time to do it  - the layering made a difference!  Yes, this does require a lot of pots/pans, but absolutely worth it!

First time I made it according to recipe and it just had too many onions and the cheddar cheese gave it a weird taste.  But, it was okay.  The second time I added green pepper/onions and used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  Much better taste.

I was looking for 1970's style recipes for a party, and came across this casserole. It is exactly like what my mom used to make regularly and call Hamburger Noodle Bake. The only changes I made to this recipe as I went along were: I added some garlic and most of the onion to the beef while it was browning to give it flavor, so that left me with maybe 1/4 of the onion to mix into the sour cream/cream cheese blend.  Everyone thought it was delicious and felt like comfort food from their childhoods. Thanks for a great recipe and great stroll down memory lane! I will definitely make this again!

I browned the ground beef with onions, mushrooms, and oregano. Used Ricotta Cheese instead of cream cheese because that's all I had on hand. This was very good and we will definitely make again! I think the sour cream/ricotta(in my case)/onion mixture is what made this so great! Thank you.

I really like this recipe. I had a hard time spreading the sour cream mixture, so I just mixed it with the noodles. I couldn't taste the cream cheese or sour cream, so I think I will double it next time. It's a great comfort food and tastes even better as leftovers! Slap a little bit of ranch on top and this dish is gone in 60 seconds!!

This was good but not fantastic. A little bland as the recipe stands. I did add some diced red/orange/yellow bell pepper for flavor and nutrition. I will try this again but with more spices.

Made exactly how recipe called. I had to use a smaller deeper rectangle dish because there was too much room to layer a 9x13 in pan with the amount of noodles. It came out GREAT! Thanks to your Grandma and thanks to you for sharing with us all!

Would I make it again?  Yes!  But would make one minor change.  I needed something to make with the ground beef I had in the fridge and this one looked like a good choice.  I didn't have tomato sauce but I did have diced tomatoes and tomato paste -probably and acceptable sustitue but after baking it was  a little dry for my taste.  I cooked the onions with the ground beef and didn't add the sugar but followed the rest of the recipe.  I was worried there wasn't enough sour cream/cream cheese but is oozed out just fine in the oven.  I heated up canned spaghetti sauce for my boys to add when they got home and they all loved it. So, it's a keeper I just need to make sure the meat is more saucy next time....and I might add some crushed red pepper too.  Simple, quick mid week meal.  And I was counting on leftovers for lunch tomorrow, no such luck ...it was devoured.

P.S.  I reserve the right to increase to 5 stars after the next attempt.

A quick recipe and satisfying.   Only difference, I used plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. - and skipped the tsp of salt and sugar.  Garlic salt was sufficient.

Its a keeper.

I will definitely make this again; after the one in the freezer is gone!  I increased the recipe because it looked so good, and I'm really glad I did.  I did make a few changes using 3 lbs of ground beef. Instead of garlic salt, I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic, minced.  I eliminated the sugar. I added a can of diced tomatoes (15 oz), and a small bag of frozen mixed vegetables. Also added a tablespoon of Italian seasons. Also since I had a full tub of cream cheese, I used the whole thing along with the cup of sour cream (which is all I had).  On top I put a layer of refrigerated crescent dough and sprinkled the cheese over.  Next time, I will try using refrigerated biscuits as I thought the crescents were too sweet.  I did not put any dough on the one in the freezer - will do it before baking.

My family thought this was okay (two liked it, two didn't, one was indifferent.)  If I make it again I'll mix the sour cream mixture in with the meat because they didn't like that separate.

This dish was awesome I did make some minor adjustments like using a can of Rotel and I cooked the onions while I was browning the meat. It was super easy and so delicious!!

Good and hearty. Even my picky son loved it. I may add some sausage to the mix next time, but it's not necessary. Thanks

I’ve been in the mood for comfort food lately, so I thought this might fit the bill.  I made half this recipe, but I cheated and used pasta sauce for the tomato sauce and seasonings.  I added a clove of garlic and some crushed red pepper flakes when browning the ground beef.  I added the Cheddar cheese to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture and I sautéed the onions before adding them.  I layered as the recipe indicates, lightly adding salt and pepper to each layer and ending with a layer of the meat mixture.  I put this all together in the afternoon, so it was ready to go in the oven at dinnertime.  I served this with a Caesar salad and we both enjoyed it!  I would make this one again!

Great!

Sauteed 3/4 onion, minced garlic, added basil, oregano, some Wild Tree Garlic seasoning when browning meat.  Added parm cheese to the cheddar.  Don't overcook noodles.

Really tasty old fashioned comfort food. I made a few changes just due to what I had in the frig and what I didn't. The family really enjoyed it

My family loved this.  I did customize it to our taste.  Just added green peppers and a little hot pepper flakes (we like some spice).  I also used some fresh basil from my garden and some parsley.  All in all we liked this recipe and will make it again.

My hubbys fave casserole.  The only change I made was using green onions, something about them in the cream cheese sour cream makes it scrumptious. I've made it a lot and find if I use just one can of tomato sauce it holds together well.  Thx for sharing this comfort recipe.

Good as written.  Did not have enough tomato sauce on hand.  Used half recommended sauce, three diced plum tomatoes, one small can of tomato paste and small can tomato paste of water.  Added a little dry parsley and black pepper.  Keeper at my house.

It was a little salty for our taste, so I replaced the garlic salt with 1/2 tsp. garlic powder the next time I made it. Spot on!  This is a great recipe that never leaves left overs! We ate so much the first time, we were miserable! lol :)

Delicious recipe that I will make it again.  But, next time, I will saute the onion with the ground beef.  Pretty darn good!

This is in our monthly rotation. Hubby and kids love it. After making it several times as directed, I think next time I will brown the onions before adding them to the sour cream/cheese mixture. I'm just not a fan of raw onion flavor. But definitely an excellent quick and easy meal!

I needed something super easy for a lunch at work where the tastes varied.

I followed the recipe as it was written only adding some quality dried basil.  

Everything went into the toss away pan at night. Covered it with foil and then baked it the next morning at work.

The responses were all positive and there was nothing left to wrap.

Whether it is family or work ... Here's an option for everyone!

My mother made an extremely similar casserole!  My family has always loved it and simply requests "Casserole".  The only thing we do differently is add some worchestershire sauce & a splash of hot sauce to the tomato sauce and some diced red bell pepper to the cream cheese/sour cream/onion mixture.  We layer beef, noodles, cream cheese, noodles, beef.  No cheese on top.  Comfort food at its BEST!
