I left out the seltzer because when i tried the watermelon mixed with the strawberries it was freaking amazing.  i improvised and needed to blend up all my leftover watermelon that was starting to get too ripe and i mixed in some frozen strawberries and some fresh mint.  it was so so so good and refreshing.
