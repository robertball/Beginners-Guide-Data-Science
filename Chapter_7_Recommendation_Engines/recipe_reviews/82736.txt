Very good!  I followed the recipe for the ingredients but just filled halved acorn squash with the ingredients and roasted in the oven at 375 (covered for half of the time) until the squash was tender.  Yum!

I have used a similar recipe for a long time that uses more butter.  I put a little nutmeg and cardamon in mine as well.  I am giving this 5 stars because it is a delicious way to make squash, and also for the tip on how to peel those buggers-they're not easy!!  Thanks for the tip!!!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I find myself making it weekly.  Thank you so much for posting it.  I omit the walnuts and add 2/3 cup of dried cranberries and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.

This was very sweet and delicious.  Thanks for the tip on peeling the squash - it worked great.  Make sure you use a sweet apple.

YAAA!!! I got my kids to eat Squash!!  They thought it tasted like a dessert.  Very Good.  Thank you soooo much on the tip to peeling the squash.  The peel almost fell off the squash.  Will make again, great for a fall side dish!!

Fantastic!  Thanks for the great idea on peeling the squash.  This came out terrific, I drizzled about a tablespoon of Vermont maple syrup over the mixture to add some extra flavor.  It came out great- Only complaint...it just wasn't enough- I will double the recipe next time.

This was very good!  I usually shy away from the winter squash because it takes so long to prepare.  This was quick and easy and tasted delicious.  Even my 5 year old vegetable-hater ate and enjoyed it!  Yay!  Next time I think I'll try adding the nutmeg and cardamon like an earlier reviewer mentioned just for the variety.

I loved this recipe. It was simple to prepare and bake.  Halved the squash and cleaned out the center.  Mixed together in a bowl the sugar, cinnamon, salt and walnuts, then tossed in the apples.  Split the apple mixture between the two halves.  Topped each half with a tablespoon of butter. Placed in a glass baking dish and put in the oven (preheated to 350 degrees F) for 25 minutes uncovered to roast, then covered for and additional 20 minutes.    My house smelled wonderful, and the squash tasted sublime.  Next time, I think I'll add another teaspoon of brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon each of nutmeg and ginger, an extra pinch of cinnamon, and 2-3 tablespoons of applesauce to keep the apples moist while baking.  Also, I'm single and had a half left over.  Still tasted just as wonderful when reheated two days later! I will definitely adding this recipe to my autumn recipe standards!

This was a very good recipe especially if you are looking for something different to do with acorn squash. I used black walnuts for a more nutty flavor and natural sugar. I also fixed them in a skillet on the stove top since I very seldom use the microwave, because of losing the nutritional value of foods.

One of my favorite combinations! A little nutmeg is good too. I generally peel squash with a potato peeler, it works just fine. For ridged squash like Acorn, I first slice them along the channels (you're going to cut it up anyway) and then it takes just a few seconds to peel the slice with the peeler.

For health and safety, NEVER put plastic in the microwave. Study after study has shown that once heated, the plastic molecules will seep into the food and are cancer causing. I would highly recommend baking this recipe (and any recipe that includes plastic in the microwave) in a conventional oven.

I am a vegetarian that does not like squash. I have tried more recipes than I can count trying to find one that I can eat.  Well, I found yours, had several jars of apples that I had canned and   wooo Hoooo!!! I now love acorn squash.  Thank you so much!

A simply wonderful veggie side dish! The recipe was doubled (except for the salt), baked in the oven in a covered casserole at 375 F. I've made this many times now, and have peeled the squash two ways - as directed in this recipe, which works well, and cut into wedges and peeled with a vegetable peeler. Personally, the vegetable peeler works best for me.  It has been served chunky and blended together. Craisins have been added as well several times, which adds a nice tartness to it. We haven’t had any leftovers regardless of how it is prepared, have shared the recipe and get requests for making it! It’s a keeper! Will try a savory version of this recipe in the near future too, and will report back. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious & Nutritious! I microwave the whole squash for about 5 minutes so I can cut it in half and just add the ingredients, makes a pretty presentation. I  chop the apples, use craisins, a tsp of cinnamon and a little nutmeg. pecans are also great in this if you don't have walnuts. love it

I really enjoyed this recipe, and I'm not huge squash fan.

Borrowing from other reviews, I modified the cooking method slightly: I mixed all the spices together; added a diced apple and mixed to cover; added a tbsp of melted butter and tossed the mixture so that everything was "wet." Stuffed back into the halved acorn squash, and baked in a 400-degree oven uncovered for 30 and then covered for 30.  Probably could have gone in for less, but I was happy with how it turned out.

Served with a couscous salad with curry, turmeric, apple and golden raisins (not on this site) - perfect fall meal!

I LOVE this and have made it a few times before, my babies both adore it and can't get enough, even my squash hating husband appreciates it! One thing I JUST discovered tonight though, in baking in the oven, the author insisted on adding 1/4 cup to the ingredients before baking. I think she may be referring to this for baking WITHOUT a cover! I always put a cover on my stuff (otherwise the oven will singe everything), and adding the water made my mix super soupy. I'll still gobble it down, but I prefer its consistency to that which you get in the microwave. Next time I bake I'll leave the water out unless I bake uncovered! Yummy yummy!

Great recipe!  Made this for Thanksgiving and turned out very well.  Everyone was pleased.  A note on peeling squash - it is very helpful to boil the squash first.  At least 15 minutes - I did mine 20 minutes and about 10 minutes in the cold water bath.  

This recipe can be made ahead of time.  if making the night before, just take it out of the frig about an hour or so before baking in a pre-heated oven.

Baked this at 375 for 45 min in a corningware dish and it came out amazing. Tasted like a dessert.  My roommate actually ate about 3 helpings of the dish (finishing it).  Will definitely make again.

So festive and delicious.  I halved the squash and mixed the rest of the ingredients together then filled the squash with the apple mixture.  I baked this @ 400* for about an hour.  Beautiful presentation and delicious.

Pretty good! I ended up adding a more brown sugar but other than that I followed the recipe and we ate it up.  And the fact that I can microwave this... priceless.

Yummy!  Used red delicious apples.  Make apple chunks the same size as squash.  Add more pecans (walnuts) and cinnamon.  Didn't take as long to microwave as recipe indicated.

Turned out great - I used twice as much butter instead (2 T.) Was my husband's first time trying squash and he went back for seconds. He chose to add more brown sugar as he was eating it, but I liked mine just as it was. A tasty change from the ordinary!

Fantastic recipe. The squash peeled perfectly after I boiled it and the cooking time was right on. It was just sweet enough with the apples and brown sugar. Next time I will probably add more walnuts, as a tablespoon really didn't do it for me.

Thanks for the tip on peeling the squash! Worked like a charm, except for the tail of the squash which refused to stay underwater. As for the recipe, it was ok, sweet more like a dessert than a side. And it actually tasted much better the next day, after the flavors had melded more. Right out of the microwave it tasted strongly like squash, with little apple flavor.

I'm making this for the first time right now, but I'm anticipating 5 stars.  I love the tip on peeling the squash, but instead of a knife I used my potato peeler, which also got into the grooves really well.  I did discover I'd run out of cinnamon over the holidays, so there's a little cinnamon, but I ended up using some pumpkin pie spice.  I think it should add something.

Dare I say I liked this microwave version better than roasting in the oven?  It's actually a bit more work to have to boil and peel it, but I think this method makes it much easier to scoop out all the strings.  I made this a couple of times as is, then added raisins the last time.  All very delicious.

Good flavor, but a somewhat unpleasant texture.  I might like it better if it were mashed/creamed?  I'll have to experiment with it

I made this for Thanksgiving and my kids loved it!! I baked mine in the oven after cutting it in half and scooping out the seeds and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on it. I added one apple and one pear and I puree my squash and then put it back in the oven for 15 mins. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This rates 10 out of 5 stars. It was so good, the two of us ate the whole thing in one sitting (so much for 6 servings!). It is absolutely delicious, with a great texture and appearance. The fact that it's so easy to make.is an added bonus.   NOTE: I had to substitute a butternut squash and chopped cashews, but I doubt if it really mattered. It will taste good with just about any winter squash.

Felt like tic-tac-toe in my mouth, the mild acorn squash and the tangy apples were in constant alternation.  my easy suggestion:  melt the butter & honey (instead of sugar), stir into prepped veggies along with dry ingredients. cover & microwave.

This is a very good way to introduce winter squash to the family. I did as Aileen did and just put the ingredients into the halved squash except I baked the halved & seeded squash in the oven cut sides down for 30 min at 350 degrees first. Then I flipped them over & filled them with the apples & seasonings (I used more cinnamon), covered them with foil & put back in the oven for 30 more min. When they were done, I scooped it all into a serving bowl & lightly mashed it all together. Excellent side dish!

I don't think we really liked this recipe the way it was written.  The prep time is a little misleading because it takes a bit of time to peel the squash after it has been boiled.  By that time I could have roasted it in the oven and cut it into chunks and I think the flavor would have been much better.  The squash and apple was bland and watery tasting.  It just reminds me why I don't like to 'cook' things in the microwave.  I don't feel like it really saved any time and the flavor was lacking.  I DO think this recipe is worth a shot in the oven though and will try it again that way.  Thanks for a great idea!

We really liked this.  I didn't have time to boil the squash whole as recommended so I just peeled it with a potato peeler.  That was harder than I thought it would be, but got the job done.  I followed the rest of the directions as explained.  Turned out really good.  I think I will leave out the nuts next time.

Made this for Thanksgiving and I was really disappointed.  It tasted bland and boring so I kept adding more brown sugar and butter until it was practically floating in it.  Then I tried to heat it in a saucepan to thicken it into a glaze, but that didn't really work out.  I guess I was expecting the sugar to form a glaze and infuse the butternut squash with sweetness and taste less squashy but it didn't.   I wish I had tried this before debuting at Thanksgiving dinner but it sounded like it would be such a sure thing.

Everyone enjoyed this dish at Thanksgiving.  I had a butternut squash that needed to be used.  I followed the same directions to soften the skin and then used a peeler to remove it.  I used pecans because that's what I had in the freezer.  I had one gala apple and one red delicious.  The gala apple looked prettier after cooking, but the two different kinds complimented each other well.  I did double the butter, nuts, and brown sugar.

I love acorn squash, but my 2 young kids aren't a fan unless mixed with apple.  I usually puree the two, but this is a nice change (be careful not to overcook the squash).  Added extra apple for the kids, but will definitely make it again!

Love this recipe because it gives directions on how to chop acorn squash easily.  It is hard to get acorn chunks for roasting, etc.  Most of the time, you cook it and have to puree or mush it up.  This process works great!  Since we got a bumper crop of acorn squash from our CSA this year, I am looking for ways to eat this wonderful veg.  Roasting will be yummy.  Thanks for the critical tip!

First of all, THANK YOU for the peeling the acorn squash tip!!!  That was awesome!

I loved this recipe.  It just tasted like fall.  Nice nutty squash with sweet apples and a titch of cinnamon.  Deliciousl!  I made a double batch but in 2 separate bowls - one with nuts and one without for non-nutty daughter.  Both were equally good.  Keep an eye on your squash.  Depending on how fast your squash cooks on the stove, 15 minutes in the microwave may be too much or not enough.

This was pretty good!  Although after several attempts at cooking acorn squash, I finally realized that this particular squash just isn't for my taste buds, prefer the butternut variety much more.  The apples however, were to die for; wow they were so good in this recipe!  I also found that only 6 minutes in my microwave was sufficient in cooking the ingredients, after stirring I taste tested it and the apples were already soft and tender, no need to pop it back in for another 7 1/2 minutes.  Will definitely make this recipe again, but perhaps with a different variety squash or just use apples instead for a sweet treat.

I served this to a group of picky eaters at Thanksgiving, and they all loved it. In fact, some of them thought it was almost dessert-like. What a great side dish. I will make making this again at Christmas for sure!

I tried this method to get the peel off the squash and it didn't work very well for me.  I also prefer my squash cooked so that it's mushy and smooth and this still had more squash texture left.  However, the flavors did very well together.  I think I'm going to take the base ingredients and try adding a few eggs, puree in my food processor, and bake for a bit until set.  I think that way you'd get the nice combination of flavors in a texture that I prefer.  Or, I'll bake the squash until I can scoop the flesh out easily, puree it, and then add in the cooked apples in small chunks.  My husband and my 4 year old boy liked this recipe, but the 2 year old discovered the difference between the apple bits and the squash and only ate the apples.

Halved the acorn squash, scooped out the seeds and left halves as is.  Mixed together apple mixture using one large, softball sized apple and a dash of lemon juice and the rest of the ingredients from the original recipe.  Divided this mixture between the two acorn squash halves, popped them in the oven at 375.  Covered with foil about 30 minutes in when the apples started browning.  The squash took about 90 minutes to become soft but it was a fairly large one.  Delicious!  Would probably go heavier on the butter and add nutmeg next time but that's just my taste.

I made this with a huge squash from the garden and 3 apples. No one was impressed. For all the work of peeling it I think I'll stick with baking the halves. I will say the peeling method worked great.

We love this recipe!  I sometimes make it just as the recipe says, (except I use brown Splenda to cut the carbs, as I am diabetic, and salt substiture.)  I also serve the same basic recipe, but just cut the squash in half, add the apples and walnuts with the sugar mixture and bake the halves in the oven. Either way, it is a family favorite.

Just wanted to update this review... Still had some leftover and I was looking for a dessert type thing.  So.. I made some oatmeal and added this on top with a little whipped cream.  It was delicious  We really loved this!  Took the suggestions and added maple syrup.  Also used some "splenda" instead of brown sugar.  The boiling method to remove skin was great.. worked well :-)  Very easy and really yummy!

this was outrageously good!  it's good as a side dish AND maybe i'm weird, but i put icecream on it and had it for dessert, too.   really, it tastes like crust-less apple pie.    my only changes were in the interest of health:  instead of brown sugar, i used 2 tb splenda and 1 tb sugar free maple syrup.  i also used lite "i can't believe it's not butter."  it still tasted amazing.

This was amazing!  I sliced the squash in half, hollowed it out and filled the empty cavity with the remaining ingredients.  I used real dark maple syrup in place of brown sugar.  I covered with tinfoil and placed on a baking sheet and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes until it was tender then I removed the tinfoil and baked for another 20 minutes.  It was perfect!!

This was good. I have never had acorn squash before, but I liked it cooked this way. I did bake in the oven according to the alternative directions. It smelled the house up like apple pie. I used a white acorn squash because I wasn't sure which one to buy. They are small so the apple chunks far outnumbered the squash.

Great recipe, I made it tonight and it was quick, and easy.  This is the first time I cooked acorn squash.  I bought it earlier this week and just couldn't pick a recipe.  Since the great tip on peeling, I used yours and am so glad I did.  Next time I will add nutmeg and vanilla.  Thanks so much for posting.

This was a good recipe, but we felt the squash needed something else.  We're not big squash eaters.  The other ingredients sounded like they'd make this a great dish but it just wasn't that great for us.  Will try it again with maybe more brown sugar.

Delicious...but it was missing something...still can't figure out what it is.  Will make again in a couple weeks and maybe by then I will figure out what else I'm looking for in this dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

I omitted the brown sugar because I'm on a silly diet, and even so, this was sweet and delicious! Oh, I also used pecans instead of walnuts because they were all I had on hand. Thanks for a simple, delicious and pretty healthy recipe!

This dish is very good.  And cooking the acorn squash to peel the skin is great!  The only change I will make in the future is to use a sweeter apple.  Other than that, I enjoyed this very much as did my husband who is not a big fan of squash.

It's like eating Apple Pie without the crust!  Absolutely fabulous and easy!  We've found that with our microwave that we've had to adjust the cooking time some.  We microwave the squash covered for 7.5 minutes on high and then add the apples and cover and cook another 7.5 minutes on high.  We cut the apples into wedges that are about 3/8 inches thick.  If you cut them too thin you'll end up with applesauce.  Our young son was allergic to soy and dairy for a time, so we substituted canola oil and it turns out just as well as when we've followed the recipe with butter.  We've also used butternut squash and it's just as awesome.  Goes great with a roasted chicken or turkey.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner since my sister-in-law had asked me to bring some type of acorn squash dish. It was great, everyone complimented me on it. The apples added a nice touch. To cook the squash I cut it in half, baked them in the oven with some brown sugar and butter, and when it had soften and cooled, I was able to scoop the squash right out of the skin.

Great, easy recipe (my favorite kind).  The tip about peeling the squash was very helpful.  I added some dried cranberries for a little extra flavor and color. Yummy!

Made this pretty much exactly as the recipe stated, except that I added dried cranberries from someone's suggestion. I can't stress enough how GOOD this came out. Savory, sweet, salty...YUM. Definitely recommend this recipe

This recipe sounded like a great idea since I had some acorn squash and apples lying around.   Unfortunately, it didn't work to my liking.  I followed the recipe exactly even down to the peeling of the squash.  My husband and daughter wouldn't eat it after the first taste.  Make with caution.

My boyfriend and I were splint on this one.  I thouht the flavor and the apples were great, but couldn't get too excited about the acorn squash.  I'd never had acorn squash before so I guess it's just not my thing.  I did add an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  My boyfriend also suggested that I chop the squash and apples into smaller pieces so that you get more of a melding of flavor in each bite.  He loved it, so I'll be making again I'm sure.

I thought this was great!  My only complaint that it took awhile to peel.  I added some dried cranberries - very delicious.  They plumped up nicely from the moisture of the squash.  Next time I will add more nuts - I don't think a tablespoon was enough.  The sweetness was perfect; contrary to other reviews, the sweetness was perfect - adding more sugar would make it too dessert-like.

Is it just me, or does anyone else find this too salty?  It barely tasted sweet to me.  Not bad, but not what I expected.  Next time I'll definitely leave out the 1/2 tsp of salt.

First time trying acorn squash.  Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner.  Used three apples instead of two and increased cinnamon as we like cinnamon.  While it is pretty good, I think it is best in small doses as it is kinda sweet.  I just don't think I like a dessert-type vegetable along side my roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas and carrots. Even though it wasn't bad, I highly doubt that I will make it again.  Family didn't mind it either but felt the same as I.

Excellent recipe.  I made it exactly as described, except I used a little extra brown sugar & cinnamon because I had a HUGE acorn squash from the garden.  Next time I might do two things different.  I'l leave out the butter, which really isn't critical to the recipe and I prefer to cook without fat.  I might also try adding some raisins, which should plump up nicely in the cooking juices.  Thanks so much for this simple, tasty recipe!  I plan to make it for Thanksgiving this year.

This is really yummy. A quick version when you have less time or don't want to go to all the work---half your squash, clean it out and bake in oven til tender, or microwave. Fill cavities with apple pie filling and bake another 10-15 minutes. Delish! My 11 year old will even eat this--an entire half!

This was a great recipe for squash.  The only downside (for me) is the prep.  I used a veggie peeler to take the skin off, since I didn't want to wait 20 mintues just to peel it.  Otherwise, it tasted really good, with a mixture of brown sugar, maple syrup and honey.  It did take a bit longer than an hour for the squash to bake up tender.

This was very good, but it could use more flavor. I added a little more cinnamon and like someone else's review I added some nutmeg, but it still needed something more. I'll be tweaking the next time I make it, but it's a definite keeper.

3 1/2 stars
I followed the recipe to a T. It was good; texture, sweetness, instructions were on the mark. I gave it 3 1/2 stars because even though we liked it, we didn't LOVE it. It was a nice, easy recipe to try and it gave use a different vegetable side dish to eat. (I used Granny Smith apples)

My mother-in-law and I are the only squash eaters in my husband's side of the family, and I was asked to bring some to our Christmas dinner. I thought this looked interesting because I love sweet potatoes and apples, and I've always thought acorn squash has a similar taste to sweet potatoes. We really liked it. I did increase the cinnamon to a full teaspoon, and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and cardamom. Instead of dotting the squash and apples with butter, I melted the butter, and then mixed it in a separate bowl with the sugar, salt, and spices, and also added a tablespoon of lite pancake syrup then poured it over the squash, and mixed it in. I took out the walnuts because my mother-in-law has an allergic reaction to them, and replaced them with craisins. This was the only thing I did not like about it. I generally love cranberries, but I did not like the flavor they added to this. Next time I will use pecans (mother-in-law only reacts to walnuts), or I could see pistachios tasting good in this. I also thought it could use a little more salt, but I tend to like more of a salty/sweet flavor in squash. My kids liked this too, and I ate some leftovers for breakfast the day after Christmas. I'll be adding this to my recipe box.

This was good, but I think we would have liked it a bit sweeter.  Even with cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar, it didn't have much flavor.  I will probably try making it again with some changes.  Boiling the squash is a great idea though and worked perfectly!

I made this for thanksgiving for a family that has never had squash as part of thanksgiving dinner before.  In fact, my sister and I are the only ones who even think of squash as a side dish. We made a double recipe, however, hoping that it would be deemed acceptable - it got rave reviews and was thoroughly enjoyed, and out of 18 people, I think only the youngest refused to try it.  The only change I'll make next time is likely to omit the walnuts, but that's just a personal preference.

This was wonderful! It's important to use a squash that's ripe and not too big, because I've found that bigger ones aren't really sweet, and under or overripe ones are stringy and dry.

I was hesitant because I've never made squash before (and was scared of cutting off my hand due to the rind!).  It was very nice!  I didn't know what to expect, but the flavors were very mellow and I was able to enjoy the flavor of the squash, but still enjoy the cinnamon taste.  I would add a little more brown sugar and more cinnamon next time.  My 6 year old daughter had two helpings of it and enjoyed it immensely.  I will make it again!  Thanks!

Maybe my expectations were too high from reading the other reviews, but this dish was nothing special.  It was not sweet enough and did not have a lot of flavor - and I like squash.  Maybe the squash I used was too big - I did add some extra butter and sugar, but it wasn't enough.  I did throw in some dried cherries I had on hand to spice it up, and those were a nice touch.  Also, I used the peeling suggestion, but the task of peeling a squash was still rather daunting. If I make this again, I will use this as a stuffing and bake the squash in the oven, b/c peeling it is too much work.

My family liked this dish. I have made a similiar one stuffing the squash with the apple mixture, but this way you get alot more squash. Thanks for the tip about peeling the squash too, it worked great!

I am a novice cook.  I made this recipe at the end of a hectic day when I did'nt have a lot of energy to concentrate---it was excellent.  My family loved it and it will become our "standard" acorn squash recipe from now on.

This was my first time eating acorn squash, and I LOVED it. You could throw an oat topping on this and call it apple crisp and fool anybody - it was sweet (and I even reduced the sugar) and delicious and so easy to make. I didn't have walnuts so I just used some almonds and while they were good, I'm not huge into nuts; I think I might just make it without any nuts at all in the future. But I will definitely be making this again!

This is so easy and yummy! I made it with three small acorn squash, three granny smith apples, and doubled the rest of the ingredients to make eight nice servings. It's sweet and tasty. The squash boiling is briliant and is totally the tip to this working so fast!

Pleasantly surprised by the yummy-ness of this recipe. The apples go great with the squash and add sweetness. Doubled all the ingredients expect for the brown sugar and the recipe turned out great. The peeling method was also quick and easy.

Tasty!  Despite the tips, the squash was still a major pain to chop and peel.  Not sure if I will go through the trouble again.

My boyfriend and I did not care for this recipe.  I really enjoy pumpkin, and since pumpkin is a member of the squash family, I thought I might enjoy a "sweetened" acorn squash dish.  Unfortunately, we did not like the flavor it gave the squash.

I liked this.  The apples and sugar added a nice sweetness to the squash, without being too sweet.  The tip for peeling the squash was helpful as well, even though I'm not daunted by the skin myself.  I somewhat prefer the flavor you get from traditional roasting, but if you want a quick and easy way to prepare squash, this is the one to try.

I love sweets so I can't believe I am going to say this, but this was too sweet.  Maybe it was a kind of apples I used (Harleson).  I don't know if I'll make this dish again.

Great recipe!  I substituted pecans for the walnuts, but kept everything else the same.  Thanks for the tip on how to peel the squash!  I've been eyeing them at the grocery store, but have never been quite sure as to how to cook them.  This was a fantastic start for me!  Husband liked it to and I will be serving it as part of our Thanksgiving feast this year.

THANK YOU!  As a child my mother made the most hideous, watery, insipid squash possible.  I have avoided squash since (and my children have never tasted it because of my aversion). Until now!  I cut the sugar and butter by half and I only had one apple (forgot to go to the store) and it was still super yummy.  Everyone had seconds.

This was soooo good. However, I left out the salt and the walnuts. When the squash came out of the microwave, I mashed it together with the apples like mashed potatos and even my 2 year old liked them! Went well with pork chops. Thanks!

I baked it in the oven as someone previously suggested. It was so good. I made this as part of Sunday dinner for friends and left the nuts out since one of their kids doesn't like nuts. It was good but next time I am going to use chopped pecans. Yum!

As suggested in the Variations, I made this with butternut squash and maple syrup instead of acorn squash and brown sugar and I roasted it. Delicious! It was a big hit with everyone and it was easy to make. I will be making it again this weekend.

We made this one night when I looked up a recipe just because I had an acorn squash on hand. I used Jonathan Apples. I added grated fresh ginger - about two teaspoons, chipotle pepper - maybe a 1/4 teaspoon, and sprinkled it with salt before completing this with the open-dish / conventional oven / add 1/4 cup of water baking method. With those modifications, it turned out great.

Surprisingly good.  The combination of nuts, apples and squash were good.  I added a generous amount of dried cranberries and that just topped it off. I will definitely have this dish again.

This recipe was a smash hit at the family gathering I made it for! However, I used yellow squash instead of acorn since we had that on hand, and crushed pecans instead of walnuts. I'll definitely be making this again!

Peeling the squash was a lot of extra work. I didn't want to use plastic in a microwave, so baked it, covered, 15 minutes in the oven, then took it out and stirred it.  It looked dry, so I added a couple of tablespoons of maple syrup and a dash of apple juice before baking another 15 minutes.  It was still dry and was lackluster in taste.

I was tempted by a low price acorn squash thanksgiving day (a whopping 75 cents) and needed a quick easy recipe. This was perfect because I had never in my life eaten an acorn squash much less attempted to peel one. The tip worked great and the recipe delicious and exactly what I had on hand. Everyone loved it, and the microwaving saving valuable oven space cooking it perfectly.

My husband thought it was too sweet with the brown sugar, but I liked the squash/apple combination.  So I've whittled it down to just chopping and sprinkling lightly with salt and cinnamon, then cooking as directed.  So easy.  The flavors blend, the apple mellows the squash flavor.  This is my favorite way to eat squash.  Works well with sweet potato too.

Easy to make. Squash & Apples are very plentiful and affordable this time of year. I also spiced it up a bit with some nutmeg, ground cloves and allspice. My wife couldn't believe something that delicious was so quick and easy, right from the microwave. This will be a fall favorite for years to come. Leftovers great with ice cream too!

I used a 1/4 c of cashews and lots of extra cinnamon.  I also cooked it in the oven instead of the microwave.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's very cheap and easy to make with things you have on hand at home.

I cut the squash in half, left the peelings on: used red delicious apples (left their peelings on,for the color is so vibrant), and baked at 375 degrees like the other reviewer mentioned: covered for the first half and uncovered the second half. This is wonderful!!!!

This was a perfect accompaniment to Thanksgiving dinner.  It was definitely a feast for the senses, as it made my home smell heavenly and the colours were perfect for a fall harvest theme.  And it tasted delicious, of course.

this was really good. It was time consuming to peel, and I didn't really like the texture of the squash. I will make this again, maybe trying a different type of squash next time. Thanks!

I didn't care for this.  It turned out watery, bland and the texture was strange.    I won't be making this again. Sorry.  :(

I didn't use walnuts and this still came out very tasty. Don't know whether to use this as a side dish or dessert.

My picky youngest even liked! I didnt' have time to boil and peel (I would have preferred that method), I peeled what I could w/ a sharp veggie peeler then when I cut into small pieces I sliced along crevices and peeled that - it didn't take too long (less time than other method but more frustrating and difficult!).  It needed a little more salt and it turned out a bit dry- I would add a little water when microwaving AND I had to add more cooking time. I prefer roasting and will go that route when I have more time to cook this.

The flavor of this dish was good, but I would suggest adding a few extra walnuts at the end beause they blended in too much for me.  I like the crunch!

Awesome alternative way to eat squash. The peel method worked awesome. I changed it up a little bit by adding another tablespoon of butter, another tablespoon of brown sugar, nutmeg, and at the end I mashed them. The kids thought they were eating "applesauce" instead of "yucky" squash. This is a great fall side dish.

This is excellent. I love squash and this is a great recipe. I bet you could make it with sweet potatoes too. I didn't have any walnuts, but I added a few sliced prunes. Next time I will dice the apples because they were hard to stir in consistently. My 2 year old wouldn't try it (yet), but I loved it!

Just lovely. I have some food allergies, and I'm always trying to find different recipes - and this one is a keeper. I made it, loved it and immediately sent it on to mom for her to try.

Thanks for the peeling tip. I found using a potato peeler easier than a knife.  The second time I made this recipe, I cooked the squash and apples on top of the stove with a little water, added the rest of the ingredients and mashed it all like potatoes when done.  Very good.

I usually only make acorn squash one way-- whipped with butter and brown sugar.  I really liked the change of texture with this recipe and the addition of cinnamon and apple.  I kept the nuts out becuase my husband doesn't like them.  Loved this recipe.

This was a great squash recipe.  My husband absolutely loved it.  I almost felt guilty eating it during supper since it tasted like it could have been a dessert.  Next time I may add raisins to the mix.

I would have given this recipe five stars for the peeling tip alone.  As one reviewer's son said "taste like the inside of an apple pie."  I ate the left over's for breakfast. Thanks!

very good. my son is a very picky eater and doesn't like his vegetables. i didn't tell him what was in it, and he loved it. he says it tastes like apple pie without the crust.
