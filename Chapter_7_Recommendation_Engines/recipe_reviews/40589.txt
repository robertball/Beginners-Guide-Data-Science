I was afraid that baked potatoes would be too crumbly, so I used boiled red potatoes.  This dish was out of this world! I love what the red wine vinegar did for the spinach... it gave it a sweet savory taste that took away any bitterness.  Kudos to Emily for this one!

A good blend of fresh herbs make these potatoes have tons of flavor! I only used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 4.  The added spinach is a nice healthy touch.

I thought this dish was excellent!  I love vinegar so I added extra.  I used baked potatoes and they were a little crumbly -but it was fine.  I will try to use different potatoes next time.

This was really good! I started searching looking for a recipe with potatoes and spinach and found this. I used russet potatoes, dried herbs and frozen spinach, that's what I had. It was sooo yummy tho! I am embarrassed to say I ate half the pan and would happily eat the other half if that wasn't just obscene. I will definately make this again.

This wasn't bad exactly, but I would change a few things the next time I make it. I would fry the potatoes in the first place instead of boiling them (they were too mushy). I would chop up the spinach also, the recipes didn't specify and since I was using baby spinach it didn't seem like it would be a problem but all the leaves bunched together so there were big hunks of spinach instead of a more even distribution. Plus it would be helpful if the recipe gave some cooking times.

Sorry but all that quanitty of herbs runied the dish for me and DH. Since I always make a recipe exactly as direct the first time and rate it on how that turns out I can only give you a 3 (and that is even stretching it). I'll try again with only a tiny touch of herbs and see if we like it any better.

My family is not really into too much spices. With that said, I used ALOT less of fresh basil, fresh rosemary, fresh oregano. I usually just make fried potatoes with red onion, Vidalia or yellow onions, potatoes, minced garlic, and olive oil. The addition of spices and vinegar was really tasty.

I made these without the spinach (didn't have any on hand), and I thought they tasted pretty good. My husband didn't like the kick that the vinegar gave them; I thought that was the best part!

I was expecting the red wine vinegar to be strong but it was very tame.  Very Good!

YUMMY!  Terrific recipe... subtle flavours, and a great way to get your greens with your 'taters.  My 1 yr. old loved it, too, though he had trouble chewing the spinach (too much like lettuce for a little guy like him!).  This is not "spinach-y" tasting - it is perfect!  Next time I will try to have feta around to add to it, as well.  Thanks for sharing, Emily!

These were pretty good the first time I served them.  They were even better the next day, made into patties and lightly pan fried.  Served on toasted English muffins with scrambled eggs and a bit of cheese.

Very adaptable recipe - I used raw potatoes, not baked. I also substituted garam masala for the listed spices, but kept the vinegar in, as well as including sliced carrots, and that came out really tasty - like an Indian-influenced potato stir fry.

These are YUMMY!!!!!! My hubby hates spinach and he absolutely loved these.  The vinegar really does do something really nice for the flavor of the spinach.  I am going to make this for Thanksgiving, because I'm sure my whole family will LOVE them. Thanks so much for the recipe Emily.

For the amount of ingredients and preparation involved, I expected it to be better. The potatoes were mushy and just OK - nothing great.

These were pretty good. I did not have any rosemary and had to use dried oregano as I did not have any fresh. The vinegar taste was interesting but I think I put too much. Also, make sure that you don't overcook the spinach like I did. My husband ate a lot so I know I'll be making this again.

While this tastes good, it was not the texture I was hoping for. Sauteing the boiled potatoes makes them mushy - the whole dish is gummy. I like the flavor of the spinach with the vinegar.

I used dried herbs (no fresh at hand) and it turned out really well. Interesting flavor combination.
