I made this for my class today and they LOVED it! Very moist. yummy! I used a strong cup of my favorite coffee in place of the water/instant coffee. I didn't mix the ingredients in the order of the recipe. I combined the chocolate, sour cream, oil and sugar. Then I combined the dry ingredients. I alternated adding the dry and hot coffee to the chocolate mix. well worth it!

I think the amount of water called for in this recipe is too much--the batter was so thin that the nuts and chocolate chips that are sprinkled on the top sunk to the center/bottom.  I think cutting the amount of water down to 1/2 or 2/3 cup would be better.  This coffee/water mixture should be mixed with the wet ingredients--mixing it the way it calls for in the recipe doesn't work very well.  Also, I think it would help to mix the sugar with the wet ingredients instead of with the dry ingredients.  All in all, the flavor of this cake is good, but the texture is not.

This cake is moist, fudgey.  I was worried about how thin the batter looked when I put it in the baking pan, but don't worry!  It came out great!  I didn't use any frosting, and it was perfect without it.

I accidentally melted both cups of chocolate chips and when I realized my mistake, decided to go ahead with the recipe. Came out like mocha brownies which were very tasty!

I got mixed reviews on this one. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I thought it was very bland. My guest thought it was good, but, I think they were being nice. I was expected it to be richer and sweeter. Sorry to say, I will not be making this one again.

I made this cake several times for potlucks and it always got rave reviews! Even without the nuts, it is definitely a winning recipe. The second time I increased the chocolate a bit, it made it just that much more chocolatey.

Thank you for the recipe, my family and friends love this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time I bake this cake after that I modify the recipe just a little bit to my taste.   I love coffee, so I add another tablespoon of instant coffee.  My husband and my mom are diabetics so, for the 2 cup of white sugar called for in the recipe, I mixed 1/2 cup raw sugar, 24 packets of Splendar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I also add another Â¼ cup of sour cream to the recipe.

It was pretty good. I made it using applesauce instead of oil and with Hersey's syrup instead of chocolate chips ( I didn't have choc chips on hand). I think it might nudge up to a five with the choc chips

Yummy! Very moist and fudgy. All my friends loved them and asked me for the recipe. I have made a few times and baked them into cup cakes. Batter was a bit thin so I added 1/4 cup of flour and 1 extra tablespoon of instant coffee for more coffee flavour. Did not have sour cream at one time so I substituted with plain yoghurt and it turned out good.  Sharon

This cake turned out flat and chewy like brownies. I topped them with peanut butter frosting. As brownies they were great but as a cake not so much.

I made this to take to an anniversary and it was terrific.  Very moist and flavorful.  After reading the other reviews I knew that the batter would appear thin so I was prepared for that. I also took the advice of one reviewer and added the extra 1/4 cup of flour. Additionally, added strong coffee in place of water and coffee granules.

Was sooooo watery.  The middle was hard and the batter went way up the sides - almost boiled over.  When cook time was done I took out and broke off the middle.  It was very gooey in the middle so I returned it to oven.  It never cooked!!  very disappointed as I was making this for potluck.

I made this cake using vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream as that is what I had on hand and it worked out quite well.  The finished cake has more of a "fudgy" texture than a traditional cake.  Prior to baking, the batter is very thin so I took another reviewer's comment to heart about the remaining chips and nuts sinking to the bottom of the pan.  So, I baked the cake without them. . . when the cake was done, I sprinkled the remaining chips on it and returned it to the oven for one minute.  Then, I spread the melted chips using a spatula and sprinkled nuts on top.  That worked well.  I would make this again.  I've only rated it four out of five stars because although we liked it, I have other chocolate cake recipes we prefer.

I don't know what I did wrong, but there's a hard, smaller rectangle type shape in the center of the cake.  It's very hard in this area.  This appeared after I baked it.  I followed the recipe to a "T", so I don't understand what happened. I just didn't add the nuts.  The hardness does not go all the way to the bottom of the cake, just about a 1/2" down.  It also appears to be sinking in the middle.
