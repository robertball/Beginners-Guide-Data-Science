When I was in the military my roommate made this dip. I loved it! I have always wanted to make it but wasn't sure how. I knew it was easy but wasn't sure of exact ingredients. This is it! I left out the cinnamon. Apple season here I come!

2.6.16 Very simple to make with a good balance of the cream cheese-marshmallow flavors. This would be a welcome complement to all of the decadent and rich foods we'll be consuming on Super Bowl Sunday. I used the reduced fat cream cheese and just a pinch of the cinnamon.
