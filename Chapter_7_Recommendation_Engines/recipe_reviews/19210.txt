I have modified this recipe slightly and always hear "These are the best I've ever had".  Here are the modifications I like (for 24 servings recipe) -

Use equal amounts of white & brown sugar (1/2 cup each).

Change the amount of raisins to 1 1/2 cups Craisins.

Change the amount of Vanilla & Cinnamon to 1 Tablespoon each instead of 1/2 teaspoon.

Roll into 1 1/2 inch balls and put on the cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 15 minutes.

NOTE: The boiling of the raisins (put in a microwave bowl, cover with water and microwave 5 mins. Let sit for about 10 more mins.) This made such a difference; I'm glad I read that in these reviews.
These bars are absolutely fantastic! I can't keep my husband away from these! I can't believe how easy this was. For an added treat I frosted some with white frosting and they tasted awesome (I was having a sugar craving at the time!!)

Finally! These are great! They aren't full of fat and greasy like all the other oatmeal cookie recipes I have tried from this site and for once, the recipe works perfectly fine as is! You don't have to read through a thousand reviews and mark down all the changes you need to make to have it turn out! You can make them as bar cookies or just drop cookies. I had no "self-rising" flour so I added 1 tsp of baking powder and used "salted" butter, actually I used Becel (a healthy, soft, tub type margerine)and the recipe turned out superb. (Self-rising flour is just regular flour with added baking powder and salt, you will notice baking recipes that call for it usually do not call for baking powder.) I also had to use whole wheat pastry flour (a very fine ground whole wheat flour you will find at a health-food store) because I ran out of all-purpose flour but my kids still gobbled them up! Anyway, thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

These were very good!  I made the recipe exactly as written and had great results.  I baked for 14 minutes to get the edges to start browning, then pulled it out.  Don't be alarmed if the center seems underdone.  The top and bottom crisp up as the bars cool, leaving a crisp outside and chewy inside.  For me, at least half the charm was that this recipe was SO easy and baked in so little time, giving almost immediate results.  The flavor was great and this recipe would be very easy to modify if you wanted to add some extra goodies like coconut, toffee bits or chocolate chips of any variety, as well as changing the recipe so that it would be more nutritious.  Don't be afraid to try this one, folks.  It's easy, quick and tastey!

I just made these cookies for my mother and they were excellent. I did notice that these were a bar cookie recipe but I made them into cookies instead.I read some of the other reviews before making these cookies and made sure to put my raisins in a boil of water and microwave them for 5 minutes. This made the raisins very plump and juicy. Make sure to drain them before adding them to the mixture. I used a tablespoon to scoop out the cookies and put them on the cookie sheets. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the mix.I also added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. An outsanding cookie very soft and chewy just the way I like them.

We found this recipe quick and easy to make. I changed the sugar amounts to 1/2 cup 
white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added coconut because we happened to 
have it handy. The recipe is very adaptable; the cookies were very moist and 
delicious. A definite hit with the kids, and a very portable cookie (doesn't fall apart)

Wow! These are great...Again the recipe is perfect. I love that they are not full of fatty ingredients. I made a couple of changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients: 1) Used whole wheat flour and all purpose flour; 2)I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder since I didn't have self-rising flour; 3) used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 of white sugar; 4)doubled the amount of cinnamon. They are by far the best oatmeal raisin bar recipe! Thank you soooo much. I will definetly do this one over and over.

Oh my! These are the best cookies I have made in a long, long time! They have the perfect amount of sugar, raisins and aren't too greasy. I made a big batch and brought them to a Halloween party and they were a BIG hit. I plan to make some as Christmas gifts to give to friends (if I don't eat them all).*****

So easy to make and so tasty!  It's an essential during camping trips because of their portability. Sometimes I add walnut or pecan pieces just to give it an extra crunch. Watch them in the oven carefully though; once it's all brown in colour, it will be a tad on the tough side.

amazing!  Everyone that tasted these loved them.  I used 1/2 c. white sugar instead of 3/4 c, and they were the perfect sweetness for me.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.

this is a good base oatmeal bar recipe, but i had to put them in an 8x8 pan, there wasn't enough dough for a 9x13. i used whole wheat flour + 1/2 t of baking powder. i also decreased the sugar to 1/2 c per other reviews. flavor and texture were right on. i didn't pay so much attention to cooking time, but rather just took them out when the edges were beginning to brown. i'm going to make another batch with chocolate chips. i think cranberries and white chocolate will be good too!

ABSOLUTELY SCRUMPTIOUS!  Made these for a quick dessert for some company tonight.....AWESOME!  I, too, soaked the raisins first in hot water for about 15 minutes before adding them to the batter.  Otherwise, I did not alter this recipe ONE BIT!  YUMMY!  THANKS!

After reading reviews, plumped my raisins before adding and downed the white sugar to 1/2 cup. These tasted awesome, but WAY too many raisins. I'm used to 5 or six raisins per cookie, these have 10 - 15. Will make again, but with 1/2 the amount of raisins.

My husband was craving something sweet and I had the ingredients for these. They were better than expected!  I didn't have self-rising flour so I added some baking powder.  Made a half a pan instead of a full.  I will use this recipe again!  This was a somewhat healthy treat.  Thanks.

These have become a staple at our house!  I add a little bit of nutmeg, and bake a few minutes longer.  We can't leave them alone!  My two year old loves them, too.

I made these exactly as it is written in the recipe and they turned out great. Although I used a flour/baking powder combo instead of self-rising flour, but it's the same thing.  

Some reviewers have complained about them not holding together, but I didn't have any trouble.  I made bars, so maybe it was the fact that I used my fingers to really press all the dough down into the pan before baking?  Or maybe it is because I tend to use real butter rather than margarine or other processed butter substitutes.  Whatever the reason, I will certainly make them again!

I reduced the sugar and used white and brown sugar as others indicated.  At the end I threw in a handful of choc chips.  My co-workers loved these.  I did "plum" the raisins in the micro before adding them too.  I will make this again, but I will reduce the sugar more.  They were sweet, but loved!

When I made these bars I thought I'd gotten it wrong because everytime I tested it to see if it was ready the knife came out sticky, it wasn't until I read other reviews and realised it was supposed to be that sticky! I'm glad it was though, I recommend this recipe to everyone!

This will one day become a top recipe.  If it were a stock, it'd be google in the 1990s.  I set out to ruin these cookies.  I had a premade dry mix from another recipe that I messed up by using self rising flour.  I started over with that recipe, but kept the dry mix and ingredient searched it and up pops this recipe.  It wasn't an exact fit, but I adjusted:  Salt was in the dry mix, so I added more sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and more vanilla to mask it.  Molasses was thrown in with the wet ingredients, since the full amount of sugar was in the dry mix...and thus, no creaming of the butter and sugar.  Steeped dates subbed for raisins.  An 8x8 pan was used, and yes, it was a little overfilled (could've been worse had I not taken some out to make drop cookies).  I lowered the temp and baked longer to avoid undercooking the middle; checked frequently b/c of the alterations.  This was meant to be a grand fustercluck.  How it came out so incredibly yummy was no credit to me.  The cookies were very flat and thin and of a cake-y texture, but with carmelized edges.  Very good, and I preferred it to the bars.  But the bars being so moist...and the taste was a 10/10...would be heaven eaten warm with vanilla ice cream.  Thank you to the cook who created this, your recipe is utterly foolproof.  I'll pass it along to my husband.

The batter was delicious. unfortunately if you are going to make drop cookies with it, as someone else suggested it would work, you need adjust the baking temp down to about 325 for 10 minutes. I have an oven thermometer to calibrate my baking temperture, my first batch burned at 360.

This recipe was great!  I made them as cookies and they were very tasty. I made them with all purpose flour and had no problem. I will make these again.

Yummy!  Even my almost 3 year old loved them!  I added about 1/2 cup more raisins than the recipe called for, and soaked them in hot (almost boiling water) for about 30 minutes so they wouldn't dry out while baking.  They stayed nice and plump.  This recipe has tons of flavor to it!

Nice & chewy!  Too sweet!  Next time I'd use 1/4 c. brown and white sugar.  I used 1/2 c. both white and brown sugar this time and it was still too sweet for me.  But it was very tasty and coworkers are asking for the recipe!

Loved these!  Made these just as the recipe stated and turned out great!  Make sure you soak the raisins in water for 5 minutes or so and then drain them.  Also, if you take them out of the oven when the side are brown (not the top), they will be super moist when cooled.  They may not look quite cook when you take them out, but they will be.

YUMMY! After reading the reviews, I boiled the raisins too, great tip.  I only had brown sugar and I cut it down a little.  I added 1/2 cup mini M&M's.  For easier spreading I sprayed a spatula with non-stick spray and used that to spread.  Great recipe -thanks

I'm giving this 5 stars based on the recipe with the following changes:  reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup, added honey instead of brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, used whole wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp baking powder, added 1/2 tsp ground cloves.  Found it easier to handle once chilled.  It is delicious, addictive, and very easy to make!

Awesome, awesome awesome! Chewy, soft and sweet. Melts in your mouth! I used a 9x9" pan which took a bit longer to cook. SO good, make sure you have enough ingredients to make a second batch, because you WILL make a second batch!!!

I just made these as cookies and they are amazing!  They only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp of baking powder because I used all-purpose flour instead of self-rising.

These cookies are so delicious.  I made some adjustments; adding more brown sugar and less white, and putting in a tablespoon of baking powder b/c I didn't have self-rising flour.  Other than that, it was very good; the edges are crispy, but the middle are moist and chewy.

This is absolutely the BEST oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I have ever baked or eaten! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I don't like the look or texture of whole oats in my cookies. So I put my oats in the blender and grind them into a fine powder.  I also followed another reviewer's advice to place the raisins in a microwave dish, cover with water and cook for 5 minutes. Then let them stand for 10 minutes more.

My cookies were still soft and chewy three days later!

Made cookies according to recipe with a few changes-- I added 1 tsp baking powder because I didn't have self-rising flour on hand, microwaved the raisens in water for 5 minutes and let sit for 10 min to plump them up, and also used smart balance butter. The results-- I used a teaspoon to drop the cookies onto baking sheet instead of making bars. Could have cut back on the sugar as they were plenty sweet enough. Also, let the batter sit after adding everything so that it will thicken up a bit and allow extra room around each cookie on baking sheet as they spread as they bake. Overall--awesome and healthier cookie option!!

I made this for my grandfather with the following changes:

1- Used all brown sugar, it has not been bleached and therefore has more nutrients

2- Used whole wheat flour (for fiber and B complex vitamins in the wheat germ)

3- Plumpled up the raisins for a half hour (easier chewing) I mixed both "blond" and regular raisins. Yum.

4- Make sure to use butter and not trans-fat containing "shortenings" (some even say 0% trans fat because legally, if they have .5 g per serving, they can say 0%. So if a serving is a teaspon or two... If is says partially of fully hydrogenated, it's got trans fats. period.)

I made them as drop cookies, and they were both delicious and nutritious.

Very nice!!! My picky kids LOVED them. I put in 1/4 cup each of margarine, butter, white sugar and brown sugar in my attempt to make this healthier. I also used whole wheat flour and added 1 tsp. of baking powder. I used rolled oats; so, without the fine powder from the quick cooking oats, I had to compensate by adding more flour to soak some fluid in order to get plump cookies instead of the flattened ones. The two versions are in my submitted photo on 3/17/07  I also let the raisins sit in hot water for 10 min. or so prior to using them in the recipe.

These are my oatmeal cookies from now on.  Perfect texture, nice and chewy, works perfectly with raisins, chocolate chips, or combination.  I increased the proportion of brown sugar to white and used whole wheat pastry flour.  The second time I made these I ran out of normal oatmeal so I had to use some steel-cut oats.  This changed the texture in a way that I liked, but that probably not everyone would appreciate.  I am very happy to have found this recipe, thank you very much!

These are good but if I make again, I will cut back on the sugar. They probably would have been moister if I had boiled the raisins first.  They are still pretty tasty.

I cooked it about 20 minutes and used all brown sugar and coconut oil.  They are awesome!  I'll make these again.  I also cut the cookies while they were warm, then let them cool in the pan , but it was hard to wait that long to eat them.

I usually don't make cookies because of the hassle of dropping them individually by tsps or tbsps.  This was a perfect recipe for solving that problem and they are delicious and chewy to boot!   I did do the raisin boil which was recommended by others, and 1/2 cup each of the white and brown sugar, and also increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and did a rounded 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

I omited the brown sugar to save on calories and sugar intake. Added a mix or rasins, cranberries & dates.  That gave it a nice punch without all the sugar.

These cookies are awesome!I have made them 3 times in the last 10 days for various groups of people and everyone loves them. I doubled the cinnamon, added chopped walnuts, and added baking powder because I didn't have self-rising flour. I had to bake a few minutes longer but just kept checking the edges. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very good - I agree with other reviewers to reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup; even with the reduced amount was pretty sweet.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Chewy with a slight crispiness on top.
Update:  Made some additional changes that I think add to the flavor:  used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, omitted raisins, added 1/2 cup chopped pecans, and 1 tsp cardamom. Baked it slightly longer, about 15-16 minutes.  This makes it a 5 star recipe in my opinion.
Update2:  I thought I'd share my results with some additional modifications.  I substituted almond butter for the butter (equal amounts) and added 1/4 cup honey to the 1/2 cup brown sugar, omitting the white sugar altogether.  This gave me the same great chewy texture of the original cookie but with the added benefit and flavor of the almond butter.  It's less sweet but the craisins make up for that.  I also tried a version with 1/2 cup almond butter, 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  This produced a much drier cookie, almost like a granola bar, though still tasty.

It was pretty good! =) I liked it.  I used 2 packs of cinnamon sugar oatmeal and 2 1/2 packs of raisin, date & walnut oatmeal.  I had trouble getting it to cook, because my 9x13 pan was unavailable.  I used an 8x8 pan, which took longer. Nice recipe though, I recommend using original oatmeal if you don't want the taste to be ridiculously strong.  Mine was, but I like it that way!

Very delicious and really easy! I liked that it made a small (22) batch of cookies(I rolled the dough into balls and baked til the edges browned).  I did use 1/2 wheat, 1/2 white flour (and may try all wheat next time) and did increase the amount of vanilla and cinnamon.  I will probably cut the sugar down next time as well - I think with the sweetness of the raisins, about 1/2 cup of so would do fine.

Oh My God! This is the best recipe ever! I was in a hurry and didn't want to waste time with cookies. My friend LOVES oatmeal raisin cookies.  This was a great way to have his favorite cookie, but cook just one batch.
They cooked up BEAUTIFULLY! I made it just as written and the entire pan was gone that night, (only 4 of us eating them). I will make this again and again.

My family loves these bars!  For a healthier recipe, use all organic ingredients, use half the sugar, and substitute coconut oil for the butter.  Delicious, and near guiltless!

Yummy! I made this recipe last week and I'm being told to make it again! I added cinnamon and crushed walnuts to the recipe. Also, taking the advice of others about soaking the raisins, I just rinsed them in my hands under hot running water. A short cut, but you can see them plump right up! This recipe will be a favorite, for sure!

I boiled the raisins prior to adding them, halved the sugar, and had to use all-purpose flour instead of the self-rising.  I thought the cookie was too "cake-like", but my boyfriend loves them.

As recommended by another reviewer, I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  Because my son doesn't care for raisins, I substituted 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Excellent bars.  Plenty sweet minus the 1/4 cup of sugar.

Great cookie was I figured out how to use regular flour instead of self rising flour.  I don't even really like oatmeal raisin (I made them for my husband's boss), but I loved these.  Next time I'm trying chocolate chip!

I made this recipe in a 9 x 13 pan, and I baked it for 5 minutes extra because I wasn't sure it was fully cooked through. I also used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1/4 c. wheat bran and cut the white sugar by 1/4 c. The bars turned out terrific. I think you could cut some of the butter too.

Great recipe!  I also boiled the raisins first (per one of the reviewers suggestions).  Since I like more spice, I increased the cinnamon, and added a touch of nutmeg.   I loved the generous amount of raisins that this called for.

Fantastic recipe. It turned out great for our Halloween evening. I followed the recipe except I used 2 cups of raisins and cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup to even the mixture. (I like more of the brown sugar personally!)

This tasted awesome, instead of bars, I made them into regular cookies, flattened them a little and baked for 8-10 minutes.  It had the most chewy and crisp texture. Everyone who tasted it loved the taste and texture.

Would modify these if I make again.  Was looking to make oatmeal bars and they are a little crumbly for that.  Also, tasted a little soapy, perhaps reducing or omitting the baking soda if using self rising flour...I am thinking adding grated apples might help with moisture.....heck, it would then be a completely different recipe!

Thanks for posting this recipe! I made it this morning and it came out great!  I looove oatmeal raisin cookies but hate having all the preservatives of store-bought so this recipe was a must-try for me.  Thanks to whomever recommended popping the raisins into the microwave in water first!  I think that helps, as I did that as well and they were super-soft and chewy in the cookie!  Couldn’t believe they came out this great on first try :-)

I didn't have vanilla so I used Baileys Irish cream. I got the wrong oats and used steel cut. And my pan was 9 x 11 so my batch was a little thicker. They are quite crispy with a nice malty richness. I tossed a little brown sugar on top and these things are sweet. And great. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

First of all, you really do need to plump your raisins in boiling water for five minutes. Then really let them drain as you’re  making your batter. I followed the directions  and the comments. I used half white sugar, half brown sugar. I made them in a pan for cookie bars. I did end up cooking them almost 17 minutes because center just didn’t look like it was setting up at all. Per a previous review it stated that  if they got too brown it would get tough, but I left them in there anyway. They came out kind of flat. Excellent taste . However,  even the next day they never firmed up completely to hold their shape. So if it was a cookie or just a square bar, when you pick one up, the free edge of the cookie actually starts to bend over and fall off. So, I don’t know whether you have to add more flour or more oatmeal but they were disappointing in that aspect. Flavor was great though. I’ll try it again, but I’ll probably add half a cup more flour or more oatmeal and hope  it’ll hold it’s shape.

Followed recipe exactly except it says to put it in a 9x13 pan and I rolled dough on a cookie sheet. They taste great but came out paper thin and kind of crumbly. Not sure why.

I doubled the recipe, used 1 cup of white and 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup choc chips. Also added 1 t allspice and 1/2 t cloves. Rolled them into balls and cooked 350 for 15 mins. Perfect!

A so-so recipe. I tried it exactly as written, with the exception of using old-fashioned oatmeal instead of quick-cooking oats, and margarine instead of butter. The batter was too thin!  The flour needed to be increased to about 1 1/4 c.

These are much too sugary sweet for me!  They did not rise up very much, so they were thin and more crispy than I prefer as well.  I used the recipe as is except that I had to add a 1t. of baking powder since I only had all purpose flour.  I also plumped the raisins ahead of time as suggested. (cover raisins with water and microwave for 5 minutes, then drain)  I left them sit for a good 20 minutes before I used them since I wanted to make sure there was not too much moisture left inside of them to affect the consistency of the cookies.  I am going to go back to my usual oatmeal raisin cookie recipe on here, which is Beth's spicy oatmeal raisin cookies.  You can taste more than just the sugar in those!

Great flavor, but mine came out very thin. I wouldn't have expected any of the substitutions I made to do that:

self-rising flour -> AP flour + 1 tsp baking powder
raisins -> choc chips
1/2 cup white sugar, + 1/2 cup brown sugar

If you're doing chocolate chips, I would recommend adding less sugar to the mix because they sweeten it up a lot.

More importantly, my husband loved it! After inhaling three of them before I could get them off the cooling rack, he declared them to be "Best oatmeal-raisin cookies, EVER!" 

Instead of making the bars, I used an ice cream scooper to make cookies. 

I added crushed slivered almonds to my recipe since my husband requested they be added – a nice added touch, I must confess. If you love oatmeal-raisin cookies and are looking for an easy, delicious recipe, this is it! While typically oatmeal-raisin cookies are more "chewy", I baked them about five minutes longer for them to have a crunchy texture. Amazing!!

I just made these for my husband.  He is an oatmeal cookie snob, so I wasn't sure what response I was going to get LOL.  He loves them!!!!  Illbe keeping this recipe, and using it often.  the ONLY thing I did change, was since I did not have any eggs on hand, I used 2TB water, 1t oil, and 2TB baking powder.  We could not taste any sifference, and they cooked up perfectly!

Loved these! I did alter the recipe a little according to other reviewers and did the following: Half cup of white sugar and half cup of brown sugar. I used unsalted butter. I only had all-purpose flour, so I increased the baking soda to 1 tsp and the salt to a 1/2 tsp. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. These were so full of flavor! It's a new favorite in my house.

I baked them as cookies at 375f for 8 minutes in my oven.  I used 1/2 cup each dark brown sugar and white sugar, and used 1T cinnamon & vanilla, and added a bit of cloves.  I also toasted the oatmeal first and plumped the raisins.  Yummy cookies!

These were very, very good cookies! Made a double batch for my large family! I did microwave 3 C. of rasins in a liquid measuring cup with water that covered the raisins, for 5 minutes, then let them cool for 10 min before, draining, and adding them to the dough. I used 2 sticks of butter right from the fridge and 1 C. Brown & 1C. White sugars. Used a hand mixer to get all flour, etc incorporated and smooth. Used required double amount of oats, but then added addl oats as dough could use more when mixing. I also didn't measure my spices, just eyeballed it with extra cinnamon. Cooked them on 350 for about 13 minutes.

I am NOT an oatmeal raisin fan, but my dear friend helped me move and I promised him cookies. I made these as a bar and he absolutely adored them! More importantly, I tried the leftovers and found myself converted to an oatmeal raisin fan! Great, unique flavor in an excellent moist bar!

I made the bars and they are delicious!!  I took the advice of others and boiled the raisins in the microwave first.  I think that made a big difference.  My only complaint, and reason for 4 stars, is that they fall apart really easily and don't present well when giving to someone.

These are some great cookies. My husband said the best I've made in a while. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and substituted chocolate chips for raisins. I did not make these as bars but dropped by rounded spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet for 13 minutes at 350. They came out perfect. A delicious and chewy cookie.

I found these to be a tad too sweet.  They were crumbly and soft, which is great except they were a bit difficult to get out of the pan as bar cookies.  I may try these again as drop cookies--may work better for me.  All in all, relatively good and easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I rated a 5 even though for some reason mine are so soft that they won't stay together,though....I dont' really care because these taste sooo good! I will probably do cookies next time to get them a little more crisp. Exactly what i wanted!!   Edit...I can't stay out of this stuff....warning...addictive...must have self control!

I added a little more cinnamon, cloves and soaked the rasins. They were fabulous!  Will make again.

This recipe was great!  It went over well at home.  I made this on a Saturday afternoon and am preparing to make it again today (it's only Sunday!).  I tried plumping the raisins a bit and I also added some semi-sweet chocolate chunks...DELISH!  The only reason I didn't rate it with 5 stars is because it was a little too sweet...next time I'll use a bit less sugar.

These turned out great. They were chewy like I like and a little crusty on the edges. Super easy! However, I think my baking soda was not up to date so instead, this recipe made like almost 4 dozen cookies!!!! Very good.

Very good cookies and easy to follow!  Thanks for the reviewers comments on plumping the raisins up - made a difference!  I also didn't have quick oats and they turned out great!

I've been having major cravings for oatmeal raisin cookies and these just made my cravings worse! They were hard, almost like a rock and they tasted really bad. Oatmeal raisin cookies are my fave and this was a huge dissapointment.

I used to love this recipe, but the past few times that I've made it, the cookies turn out really flat and greasy. Anyone know why???

Brilliant recipe in all its incarnations. Like others, I cut the sugar by half, and added 1 tsp baking powder as I was using all-purpose flour.  Omitted the cinnamon and raisins and added chocolate chips. Next time, I'll keep the cinnamon and use  butterscotch chips. As great as any oatmeal cookie without the time to dip-n-drop each cookie, and truly versatile with the add-ins. Also, as stated, not too greasy!

I thought the taste of this recipe is exceptional, but the cookies fell apart (I made cookies out of them).  I doubled the cinnamon, since I love cinnamon and did the remaining recipe exactly stated.  I could eat these cookies over and over without getting tired of them.  I just which they would hold together better.  I just tried the bar method and I hope maybe they hold together better that way.  Very delicious!

Everytime I take these to an "event" I get lots of complements.  People ask for the recipe all the time, and I happily give it to them.  I have doubled the recipe because it went so fast.

Love the idea of a one pan cookie/bar.
Easy to make, l did add less raisins,added some craisins and mini chocolate chips. I also decreased the amount of white sugar to 1/2 a cup, only because l added the chocolate chips and craisins which are sweet on there own. These cookies were not too sweet which l really liked. Will try next time adding some pecans.
Yummy!!

Awesome recipes, even with all the substitutions and absent ingredients I had. I used Splenda instead of sugar, molasses instead of brown sugar (plus 1/4 extra of Splenda), salted butter and no salt, egg Beaters instead of an egg, and whole wheat flour (not self-rising). I had no baking powder so they didn't puff up much and kind of crumbled after baking, but I am satisfied with the taste and will definitely be better prepared the next time I cook up batch of these.

Overall a pretty good recipe.  Easy to make without a mixer, cooks fast, and isn't too overpoweringly sweet.  I did them as bars, but have not tried dropping them as cookies and probably would use a different recipe if I make oatmeal cookies, but as bars, they are good.

I made these yesterday for a work pot-luck. I ended up not bringing them becuase after the bars cooled and I started to cut them they fell apart. The flavor was very good, and I am keeping them for the family. They're just a big messy.

Dang good bars! I also loved the "soak the raisins first" idea mentioned by previous reviewers. I've never heard of that one before and I'll be doing that from now on in all my recipes calling for raisins.

Everybody enjoyed these.  I doubled the recipe, filled a 9x13 pan with a little more than half of the cookie dough, then attempted to bake the rest of the dough just as drop cookies.  The drop cookies didn't bake up very well, but the bars were amazing!! Thanks so much, I will be making these again and again!

These are definately the best oatmeal cookies. I agree that they're not heavy or greasy like other oatmeal cookies. They're easy to make and this makes just the right amount. I boiled the raisins and used equal amounts of white/brown sugars. Perfect! Might try these with gumdrops instead of raisins during the holidays.

As this site has enabled me to cook wonderful meals for my family I feel it is my duty to give feedback to help others. 5 stars without a doubt! I made few changes- equal amounts brown and white sugar(half cup) and use wheat flour decreased the butter just a bit,finally adding walnuts for personal pleasure. Best compliment when the kids think your the best cook in the world!

I read all the reviews first and I did like most everyone else and soaked the raisins.  I read that alot of the cookie bars came out cake-like.  So I used King Arthur whole wheat flour.  As indicated by others, I cut back the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup each of regular and brown.  These cookies came out nice and will made again.

These are great.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I also doubled the cinnamon and boiled the raisins as other reviewers said.  These cookies are a little cakier than I like, but still are really good!

Very good bar cookies.  The hardest thing was to get them to spread out in the pan as the dough was very heavy and sticky.

I must say that I didn't know this was a bar recipe until I got ready to put them in the oven.  I still made them in cookie form and they turned out well.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon.  I also greased the pan with butter.  The first batch I did with oil and felt as though they retained the flavor of the oil too much.  Next time I will soak the raisins, although mine didn't dry out.

I didn't make these yet, but I am definitly going to, but another good way to make  these cookies is to replace the raisin with chocolate chips! It is really good. Thanks for this recipe!
