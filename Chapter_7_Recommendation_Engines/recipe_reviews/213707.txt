cotija is a mexican cheese that is white and crumbly, similar to feta - i would try that if you can't find cotija!

This was an excellent, flavorful dish, with lots of awesome veggies in it!  My market was out of poblanos so I used a jalapeno, which was fine.  Wish I could have found the cotija, but we're a little far north for that, so I used a good mountain feta instead; if you go that route, I'd recommend adding it to each serving as it's plated, since it kind of disappears in the pan.  I'd also definitely recommend not sauteeing the garlic with the onions for more than a minute or so, since the heat is so high; mine was starting to burn before I could pick my spoon up off the counter.  And next time I might halve the recipe since it makes a ton.  Still excellent, though; thanks so much!

This was a good, solid recipe, and we enjoyed it and have made it a couple of times. It's not "oh my goodness - amazing!" quality, but definitely a nice, tasty sort of weeknight side-dish. I tossed the (cheese-less) leftovers the next morning into my scrambled eggs, which I enjoyed a lot (probably enough to make this dish specifically for that purpose), which made my breakfast a bit healthier due to the vegetables. Cotija cheese is available in pretty much every supermarket in southern california, so I had no problems finding that, but I think it would also be good with queso fresco, panela, or any mild and crumbly sheep's milk cheese. I don't think feta would be a good substitute, as suggested by previous reviewers because it's too salty.

This is a good recipe for using all that summer zucchini!  I did not add cheese and it was still delicious.  Be careful not to over cook the zucchini, as it will be mushy if cooked too long.

Straight-up fantastico! Didn't take nearly 50 minutes, but I chop fast. Didn't have fresh corn, but look forward to the first crop. Served on the side of a slow cooker Cochinita Pibil with some tortillas. Will be eating a lot of this over the summer. Thanks!

This was delicious and easy. I didn't boil the corn; I just tossed it in with the zucchini. I don't like mushy tomatoes, so I added mine with the pepper (I used roasted NM green chile). I omitted the cotija because I'm not a fan of cheese with veggies. This was excellent in a burrito with Refried Beans Without the Refry (also from this site) and guacamole.

This was a very tasty way to serve vegetables! My mom isn't a fan of the heat so the poblano pepper worried her a bit but although I wasn't sure, I told her I doubted it was hot because so many reviews mentioned adding a jalapeno or some sort of kick. I wouldn't have minded a kick but my mom's not a fan so we made it as is. Very tasty! The only change from original recipe was we used frozen corn kernels. I'm sure it would be even better with fresh!

I don't normally like zucchini and even I thought this was great.  Only because of time constraints, I substituted frozen corn and a small can of green chilies.  I had some great home-grown tomatoes on hand so I used those instead of roma.  I am sure I would like this even more with fresh corn and a fresh poblano pepper.  But this was easy and delicious.  My husband loved it.

I used canned diced chiles since I didn't have any fresh and added a can of black beans.  It was really good with a little guacamole in a tortilla.

So good. The only peppers I had on hand were jalapenos, so I diced up on of those and threw it in. I added cumin and skipped the cheese. Loved the use of the fresh corn in this. Thanks :)

Super easy, and the fresh flavors are amazing together! I bought everything from a local farmers market, which the kids really enjoyed visiting... although they refused to eat the results. My husband, however, has once again re-declared his undying love. Thank you, gema! I'll be making this year-round. : )

So easy and so yummy.  I used frozen corn instead of fresh cobs.  I also sprinkled with feta cheese because I had some left over from another recipe.  The flavor is slightly different from cotija, but not enough to notice in the quantity used for garnish and the texture is pretty much identical.  This is a really great way to include some very tasty veggies into a meal.

Simple recipe, quick but yummy.  We've also added tomato sauce and ground turkey or ground beef to make it into a meal, and more of a soup.

Proof that there are delicious and healthier Mexican side dish alternatives for enchiladas other than rice and beans.  (Due to Hubs’ sensitive innards  I was forced to modify this recipe by significantly reducing the amount of corn so he could easily pick it out)

I use this site all the time but don't often post reviews. This recipe deserved a review. I've made it several times; it's is a fabulous way to use zucchini and fresh corn. I added bell peppers too. Instead of a poblano I used a habanero which gave it a nice smoky flavor. Like other posters I used feta, which was perfect. I had so much that I have transformed the extra into a delicious cream soup. Yum!

I used this recipe for guidance, but didn't measure things. It was a great way to use up a plethora of zukes and summer squash! (I used some of each.) I didn't have cojita, so used grated Colby Jack, and that tasted good and counteracted some of the heat from the small hot peppers I used. I made a very large batch thinking I'd add beans for a hearty lunch the next day, but my husband ate 3 servings so I didn't have a lot left...

I made this because I had a bunch of zucchini left from my garden.  We actually ate this as the meal, just served in tortillas like Fajitas.  The only complaint my husband had was that there was too much liquid..so next time I will cook with the lid off and let the liquid evaporate. I did use feta because I couldn't find cotija cheese.  And I used frozen corn that I had on hand and it tasted fine.

This is so good! I didn't want to take the time to prepare the fresh corn, so I use canned whole kernels. I was afraid that it would be too spicy, but in the end it wasn't spicy at all. I couldn't find crumbled cotija cheese, so I use grated cotija instead. I will be making this again for sure!

Made this as a side with our grilled spicy chicken burgers.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used Feta as the cheese.  There were five adults at dinner - about 3 tablespoons left!!!!  So fresh tasting. Everyone commented on the mingling of flavors. We voted - this is a keeper!  Yum!

Great way to use up a bumper crop of zucchini. I added peri-peri instead of poblano and I used herbed goat cheese instead of cotija. But what really put this recipe over the top was using grilled corn cut off the cob.

Excellent as written, even better if you skip the cilantro and sprinkle in about 1/4 tsp. cumin and for (or in addition to) the poblano pepper substitute a large jalapeno (seeded if you like so it won't be too spicy) and chopped, with the onions & garlic while sauteing in pan. We ate this as a main dish with four flour tortillas that I steamed one at a time over the simmering vegetables and buttered and stacked on warm plate. There are only two uf us and there were NO leftovers!

My husband said it was the best calabacitas I had ever made.  I used fresh corn and roasted the chiles.  I cut the zuccini on my mandolin for uniform slices.  Will keep this recipe.

What a coincidence! I made this last night before I saw this recipe in my email this morning!  I had fresh frozen corn to use up and tossed it in near the end with the garlic.  Threw in a large bell pepper and some sliced black olives, also some oregano and basil, and crushed red pepper instead of the poblano (wish I'd had one though).  Didn't think of adding cheese!  Next time!

Very tasty side dish. I really enjoyed the combination of flavors. I did leave out the cheese, in my opinion it did not need it.

My family always used Oaxaca cheese which can be subbed with mozarella which makes the dish so gooey and cheesy and brought it to a consistency close to a stew - muy delicioso !??

we really enjoyed this dish.. didn't have the poblano.. probably used more cheese than called for.. and i couldn't imagine going without it.. i think cotija is closer in taste to parm than feta.. feta comes off too sour.. cotija is just a salty cheese.. anyway, ty so much for the recipe

Thank you for posting...This is very authentic.. very good. if you use other things like adding sugar, creme, beans..etc... it wont be a Mexican dish..This is a side dish that you can salsa while eating in a warm flour tortilla... with any kind of mean on the side..pollo or carne asada..

This was really delicious. I left out the cotija cheese as we're vegan, and added some diced potatoes when I was sauteeing the garlic and onion just for a little heft. I also used some seasoned salt in place of the regular salt for flavor and we ate this as taco filling with seasoned black beans on the side. SOOO good and filling! Didn't miss any meat or cheese. We will make this again and again, I may add another tomato next time. And that's coming from someone who HATES tomatoes. Also, this is a very romantic recipe to cook with someone. I had fun cutting all of the veggies up with my boyfriend :)

Easy, quick, and refreshing zucchini dish.
I added some cumin, canned chilis, and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to spice it up; used Mexican cheese for the cotija.

This is a great foundation for lots of things; this time around I added red bell pepper, and backed off the tomato a bit. In the future  I will probably play around with more heat, and perhaps add some small peach or mango chunks.  Great to have in one's repertoire.

While I love calabacitas, I had to rate a 4 because people are more hesitant to get as excited about summer squash as I do. Beyond altering amounts of the different veggies, I add a splash of chicken stock to the dish before covering. It adds nice complexity to the vegetal flavors and blends well with the Mexican cheese. I don't know how authentic that is and whether or not vegans find it blasphemous, but I like it!!!!!

I had some zucchini that I needed to use up and I came across this recipe and had all of the ingredients on hand. My KIDS asked me to make it again for next week!!! I love when I come across a recipe that is easy, healthy AND tasty to my kids! I served it on whole wheat tortillas for some of the family and the others had it with brown rice. We added Black beans, cumin and chili powder at the table but I think I will add them to the pan with everything next time. The only cheese I had on hand was feta and it was outstanding! This is a dish of delish!! Thanks for sharing the recipe! Edit: I served the rest of what was left with brown rice in a bowl with a jammy egg on top...It was really tasty!

This is really very good as a side with rolled chicken tacos !!! Makes me wish I had planted a garden this past summer.  But fresh veges are also good from our local Farmers Market.

This is a great side dish and my family loves it.  I have made it many times, but with queso fresco instead of cotija.  I've also used jalapeno instead of poblano, but prefer poblano.  I don't add the tomato.  I've seen other recipes that don't call for it and we prefer it without.  That's the beauty of it.  Make it however you like it.

I live in New Mexico close to the Mexican border and also very close to Hatch, NM.  Calabacitas are frequently served as a side dish and I made it more like I see it here.... with both yellow squash and zucchini ( adds sweetness and a nice contrast), no cheese (although it's often served with cheesy dishes like enchiladas and I will try it with cojita sometime).  Of course all over NM, we don't use a lot of poblano... when Hatch green chilies are so awesome and ubiquitous   ;)

This recipe is great and can be flexed with what you have on hand. I've subbed in frozen corn, canned green chiles, and canned diced tomatoes. None of them are quite as good as fresh, but it's still a wonderful recipe. The leftovers are delicious in breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs.

I really like this recipe. During the hot summer months, we usually have all these ingredients from our CSA farm share, and it is easy and fresh. I leave out the hot pepper (maybe I'll try chili powder), substitute queso fresco for the  cotija, don't pre-cook the corn, and top it with cilantro.  Sometimes, I use grape tomatoes, instead of romas. It is also great in a quesadilla. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a great dish to use wonderful summer vegetables! I loved the blend of flavors and my husband was a big fan.   The only change I made was to use feta cheese because I couldn't find cotija.

It was good but it could of been better if I wouldn't of overcooked the zucchini and if I would not have used queso cotija, it was too salty.  I eat it at my fav restaurant "Street Tacos & Beer" it is so delicious. I know now what not to do the next time.

Great calabacitas recipe-wouldn't change a thing! Make sure to add the cotija- it adds a salty creaminess to the delicious veggies.  Cheers!

I'm a lazy cook, but I love fresh ingredients! I cheated a lot! But the results were very tasty! I got fresh corn and zucchini  and a can of Mexican Rotel. I used the liquid from the rotel to cook the corn in. When the liquid was gone, I threw in the rest of the can's ingredients. Added the chopped zucchini, cooked til done. Threw in a handful of chopped fresh cilantro and cotija cheese!

I grew up eating this dish that was prepared using pork.  This is one of my all-time favorite traditional Mexican meals.  Now that I am a vegan, I prepare it without the meat.  It is great and very healthy.  A little tip for those out there who are preparing it, dash some cumin in there at the end and it will be perfect!

I used frozen corn because there wasn't any fresh and an Anaheim pepper (that was too hot) because there weren't any poblanos. This is a fresh and tasty side dish. No one will ever say, "wow!" But, it's tasty and I'll make it again.

I made this last night at my sisters suggestion.  Soooo delicious.  I added a couple chorizo links I had in fridge plus cilantro and homemade salsa verde on top, toasted corn tortillas and avocado on the side. Def do-overs, prolly with black beans next time.

This was fantastic!  Even my picky toddlers ate this, which is really saying something.  I left out the onion and used frozen corn kernels.  I forgot the cojita cheese the first time and it was still extremely tasty.  With the leftovers I used the cojita and it was even better!

As another reviewer said: this is a "good solid dish". However, the reason why it is four stars and not five is that it could use a little jazz. The flavors of the vegetables together worked nicely, but overall it seemed a bit bland. I will definitely make this dish again but I will probably pair it with a spicier dish such as the "Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken" recipe, which is also listed on this site. That way the "blandness" of this dish will even out with all the spices of that one. ALSO, I didn't use the cheese because we didn't have any. Maybe that made a difference but I don't know; I am not a huge fan of cheese in general.
