Never having beans made this way it was an experience. I halfed the recipe and did however make in a slowcooker. Rinsed the beans well, soaked overnight, changed the water a few times to help remove the gas causing property then the next morning heated the beans in their water on the stove top, changed the water and heated them up again. When they were tender I drained them, put all the ingredients in the slowcooker with the exception of the butter, covered the top with foil and put the lid on to create a tighter seal. Cooked on high for about 5 hours, turned off slowcooker, checked that they were done and then left them sit for about another hour. They had a good flavor, sorta like boston baked beans but in a watery broth as oppossed to a thick syrup. I vision this being made on an open range for a true cowboy dinner.

Your Recipe and mine r very similar.  These beans have to be made in the ground... I have a bean hole in my back yard that I use almost every weekend.  People around the Bangor area are amazed when I share with them what I am doing. Most of the time they wonder why I dont just throw them in the oven. I tell them its not the same and that the experiance is well worth the added flavor of being cooked in the ground.  Its gotta be a maine thing cuz most folks just dont understand why people would put so much effort into cooking.  I use just a smidge of real maple syrup in mine aswell.  Thanks for keeping the tradition alive! Thank You!
