FOR THOSE WHO ARE DIABETIC, ON A LOW CARB DIET, OR JUST WATCHING THEIR WEIGHT, THIS IS THE TREAT FOR YOU. I HAVE MADE THIS MANY TIMES AND IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW GOOD IT IS. NICE AND TANGY-SWEET, LUSCIOUS, AND CREAMY-----MY HUSBAND COULDN'T TELL IT ISN'T THE HIGH CALORIE KIND. I MUST SAY HOWEVER, I USED THE ORIGINAL RECIPE @ THE EQUAL SITE THAT MADE THE RECIPE EVEN EASIER BY USING A 9" PIE PLATE----IT'S A SNAP! TRY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!

This is a great recipe, especially refreshing in the summer.  It's like a combination between a cheesecake and a Key lime pie.  I did not use a springform pan, but just a regular graham cracker crust in a 9-inch pie plate and it turned out great.  I also used two eggs, instead of one egg and two egg whites.  Served topped with a dollop of whipped cream and few raspberries - wonderful!

I made it with real sugar and it tasted great. Not very limey though. I have an 8 1/2 inch spring form pan and it made a very low cheesecake. Next time I make this, I will scale it for 3 blocks of cream cheese instead.
