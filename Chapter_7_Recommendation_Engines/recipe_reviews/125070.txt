These were AMAZING I made them for my brother's friends birthday. They didnt trust that a 12 year old was making their food but as it was done everyone loved it. I would say best with pretzels.

These are really quick and easy. The kids and hubby eat them up.  I have also found that I can use any size biscuits depending on what i have in the fridge (grands, etc.), the depth of the cup just varies.

I made my own biscuit dough, added an onion and garlic to the ground beef mixture and used two kinds of cheese. Big hit!! I also got 12 muffins out of the recipe.

This was the hit of the party with the kids and adults.  Due to the lack of muffin sheets at home, we decided to make farmhouse BBQ mini-burgers and it worked out very well.  

One note: Drain the meat well if you make this recipe in a hotpocket/mini-burger style because the bread started splitting due to the moisture.

I made my own biscuit dough and added minced onion and garlic as other reviewers suggested.  The flavour was good, but they turned out really dry.

I made these for a luncheon but they never made it out of the church kitchen! I thought the sauce might be too sweet,but the biscuit compliments the beef well. Some ladies thought they would add Worcestershire sauce when they made them. All in all a great idea and a great taste!

A little sweet for my taste, but still good. I really made them for the kids, anyway, and they raved! Next time I will cut the sugar back by a tablespoon.

Made these last night and the family loved it. The only thing I changed is I made my own biscuits since I hate store bought ones. YUM!!  I will definitely make again and already thinking of other things for the filling. Thank you for sharing.

These are fantastically amazing!  We loved the bit of sweetness.  We made these with a side of mac'n'cheese for lunch, and all 4 of my picky kids and my picky husband LOVED them!   I'm a super busy mom, and this was a super quick and easy lunch for me to prepare.  Thanks for the recipe!

So good!  I did not make muffin cups, I just baked the biscuits in a 9x9 pan until they were almost done, then poured the meat mixture over them and sprinkled with cheddar & baked until cheese was melted.  I thought they were delicious.  The meat had wonderful flavor!  Even as leftovers, they were good!

I knew husband would like these the minute I read the recipe, and I was right.  It's kld-friendly, and he eats like a 7 year old.  I enjoyed it, too, but wanted to make it a little more adult-friendly.  I ran out of ketchup, so made up the difference with some honey barbecue sauce, added minced garlic and more chili powder than called for.  I liked the zing of the cider vinegar; it came through really well.  Shredded a LOT of cheese, and piled it on top of the muffins before baking, so the cheese got nicely browned and kind of crispy at the edges.  Husband suggested that we try it next time with pulled pork.

I have made these twice now and my family loves them!  The first time I made the recipe exactly, the second time I made a batch with sloppy joe mix instead of bbq sauce.  I have to say the kids and I both liked the sloppy joe version better.  I think next I may try a breakfast version with eggs, sausage and veggies.  One thing is for sure, these have now earned a permant place in our monthly menu!  A great quick, easy, cheap meal for busy nights!

Pretty tasty, but I think it needs some minced onion to give it a little more kick.  My nephew (age 16) suggested it would be better with taco meat so maybe I'll try it that way next time.

I made my own biscuits with pancake mix and milk. We were thinking that these would be good with taco mix instead of barbecue sauce. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

So simple. Fairly quick, and so tasty. Very kid friendly too. I started out rolling out the biscuits, but found it was faster and easier to place them in the muffin cups and mash them to fit. These were good, but I prefer a bit more zip zing and zowie to my bbq beef cups so I'll probably go back to my usual recipe with bottled bbq sauce as a base, or doctor this one some. This was a great lunch and made good leftovers for my son to eat when he gets in late from his football game tonight.

Really easy to make and tasted not bad too... they survived the six year old test in my house! (I had to use double the sauce though and glad I did... might have been dry otherwise.)

This was a good meal for a busy night when we didn't have too many ingredients available. I halved the Ketchup and added some Open Pit BBQ sauce. Also added a dash of Worshtechire sauce. It came out a tad sweeter than I expected, but still good. Tasted like a sloppy joe with cheese in a biscuit. The little bit of leftovers we had (since we had a 7.5 oz container of biscuits) was used for sloppy joes the next day.

These were just OK.  My family would prefer to just have the meat/cheese in a hamburger bun instead of the biscuit.  Also sauce is a little too sweet .

Fun and tasty.  A favorite at my household.  Think it needs a little more BBQ sauce than called for.

Great tasting recipe! the only changes i made was doubling the chili powder, and adding minced garlic and onion. Also, instead of using muffin cups i just used my fingers to flatten and strech the circular dough untill big enough to put the meat and cheese in the middle and fold the four corners together.Then i pinched them shut. I stuck a toothpick through the dough, pulled up and pinched together the remaining four corners and put another toothpick through that dough as well. They look like little flowers! I just bake them like usual and they come out fluffy and delicious! My boys LOVE this recipe!

Made these for dinner and paired with beef flavored rice and corn.  They were good and kid friendly. My 3 year old ate them but my husband wasn't crazy about them. I did freeze what was leftover and they are the right size to pop in the toaster oven for lunch.

Good base recipe. I don't like my sauces too ketchup-y, so I used half BBQ and half ketchup. I added spices, like onion powder and garlic powder. This ended up filling twelve biscuit "cups" nicely, with plenty of cheese on top. I found the sauce way too sweet but my boys inhaled darn near all of these. If I make this again, I'll use the homemade whiskey BBQ sauce instead and cut out the brown sugar. Great boy food.

Easy and very good.  Daughter won't touch anything with ketchup, so I used a 1/2 cup of tomato soup, 1 T. BBQ sauce, 1 t. prepared mustard and a 1/4 t. of pepper.

I rarely review these recipes, but this is one of the few that I've tried that everyone in our family of 6 ate without threat! I was a little scared of the cider vinegar, but the sauce was excellent! Sweet & tangy and....well just perfect! I wouldn't change a thing!!

Great starting point, but the "sloppy joe" meat mixture needs a bit of tweaking.  I cooked the ground beef with some minced onion to add more flavor, and as I always do with sloppy joes, also added some mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper to the meat along with the ketchup, cider vinegar, and brown sugar as the recipe lists.  (I left out the chili powder).  Not being a canned biscuit kind of a cook, I made some quick Bisquick biscuits (two batches of 1 doz. each required for just over a lb. of beef), and loaded up the two dozen biscuit-lined cups with beef and shredded Cheddar before baking.  These little appetizer-style sandwiches worked very well for an after-church reception.  I'm sure I'll be taking them again to similar group functions!  They disappeared quickly and everyone liked them!

These were so easy to make! I paired them up with a recipe I found for McDonald's french fries. They were a hit, and SO filling. I'll be making these again soon!

TIP: I use Grands! Jr biscuits instead of the bigger Grands biscuits.  I have found the Grands! Jr are just the right size. These are delicious! My family loves them.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was great.  All the children at my daughter's birthday party loved it.  Now I make it on lazy dinner days with french fries or salad.  This recipe is a regular at my house.  Thanks

Utterly fabulous.  Kids loved it, hubby loved it, sister loved it, co-workers are all asking for the recipe after 4 yr old went to work and bragged about how good they were.  

Changes I made~ I put onion and garlic in with the meat while it browned.  I added a dash of worshtishire sauce and a splash of A1 sauce too.  The first time I made them I didnt have any chedder so I used a colby jack blend.  Made it much moister, than using the chedder but two different flavors made with the diff cheeses.  

Have fun these are great!!!!

This is a suprisingly tasty recipe. My guests really liked them, only change I would make is to add finely diced onion to the meat mixture and maybe a dash of worcestshire sauce. I also would add a bit more cheese to the top to make them a bit cheesier. Also, make sure you have a rolling pin because without it the biscuit dough is very hard to flatten by hand. Update: I made these again and with the addition of the onion and extra cheese they were a HUGE hit at a party. The biscuit dough is still a pain with a rolling pin but it was MUCH easier to manage than without it.

These are wonderful.  I have another recipe for filled muffins that suggests using a 1/3 of each biscuit as a "lid" for each muffin.  I did that with these, and it was spectacular.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Bonus - my hubby doesn't like new recipes, and he loved these!

I absolutely LOVE these! The recipe is perfect. My husband asks me to make these all the time. Terrific!

As an added bonus: the beef filling also makes awesome sloppy joes.
