I've been making stuffed portobellos for years in a similar fashion.  The recipe changes every time based on what I have on hand.  Last time I used about 3/4 cup leftover cooked basmati rice, sauteed summer squash, zucchini, tomato, onion, garlic, about 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, and 1/2 cup chedder cheese.  I also like to add 1 beaten egg to help it all hold together.  If you don't have time to marinate, drizzle the mushroom caps (stem side up) with a little balsamic (not too much, it can be overpowering) or soy sauce and bake for about 10 mins before topping with the stuffing.

Really, really excellent vegetarian dish.  I didn't have eggplant so substituted regular mushrooms which worked just fine.  One change I would make would to be to cook the whole dish maybe 15-18 minutes to make the portobello a little bit more tender.

I loved these. I didn't have an eggplant, so I used the spinach,garlic,onion, artichoke heart, and added fresh chopped roma tomatoes. I also added a little red wine to the bottom of the baking dish. Excellent.

This is a wonderful vegetarian recipe.  To make it a bit more economical I use regular sliced mushrooms and just layer all the ingredients to make it into a casserole.  I do use a little less Balsamic vinegar but otherwise follow the recipe as is.

Oh my! These were oh-so-good!  I had to use my mushroom caps quickly but had no time to go to the store so I made a couple alterations - no eggplant, so I used a mixture of chopped white mushrooms and summer squash (which actually made this very colorful!), fresh spinach, which I just barely wilted in the pan, and no fresh tomatoes on hand so I use canned diced tomatoes.  Threw some oregano in there and also cut back on the mozzarella.  Finally, I had no time to marinate so I just brushed the tops of the mushroom caps with the vinegar - added a little olive oil to it also.  I look forward to making these with eggplant, or zucchini, or whatever combinations I can come up with.  Very versatile recipe! Thanks, Elise!!!

Awesome recipe, but I have to admit I tweaked it a bit!  I read a the reviews and decided to tone down the vinegar.  I sprinkled about 2 tbsp of vinegar and a pinch of garlic and onion powder into each cap and let it soak in while I prepared the remaining ingredients.  I did bake them for about 25 min, as after 12 they were barely warm.  I used fresh instead of frozen spinach but I am sure the result was the same.  She is right, great way to get your veggies!

Found the recipe too heavy on the vinegar.  Will soften next time.  Also, cooked for 25 min at 350d.  Was not done/hot at the recommended 12 min time.

What a waste of some beautiful, fresh vegetables. The vinegar was so strong I could not finish eating the dish. I marinated five portobellos for 30 minutes and it still made it inedible. The topping was a good start but needed seasoning like salt or maybe some garlic.

These were great!  My 12 year old daughter does not eat meat anymore so I'm always looking for vegetarian dishes for her.  I made these stuffed mushrooms and served them with a green salad and a loaf of crusty Italian bread.  Even my husband who always wants meat with dinner enjoyed this.  I made extra and took them for lunch the next day.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very tasty and a nice way to eat more veggies. I added feta cheese which add some extra flavor.

I had great expectations and made this as a side for dinner. The mushrooms should marinate much longer, because they were chewy in the middle and not completely done, and there was too much artichoke for our tastes. Thanks for the post; I'm sure it was our personal tastes; great idea.

Really delicious; I definitely needed to add a fair amount of salt, but it was really good. Served it atop a bed of pasta with tomato basil marinara sauce, which really complemented it. I would definitely make it again.

This was really good!  We skipped the eggplant but I only made 2 mushrooms since it was just DH and me.  I also used lots more cheese - yum!  I had too much filling so I just put it around the mushrooms in the baking pan.  Our only complaint was that the mushrooms did taste like biting into vinegar - ick!  So next time I will either make this as a casserole OR I will only brush the mushrooms with balsamic and EVOO before baking, as others have suggested.  Tasty and a great non-meat dinner - thanks!

I liked this recipe but my DH said that it was too vinegar-y. He was right but it still had good flavors.  I used large portobellos so I would only marinate these for half the time next time.

These were soooo tasty!  I've been asked to add this to my "definitely make again" list :)

I used zucchini instead of eggplant, and fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I made 2 of them without the cheese, and they were still super tasty.  I served these over angel hair pasta that had been seasoned lightly with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder, tossed in a little olive oil and dusted with parm. Yum!

Loved this recipe :) instead of using regular balsamic, I used white balsamic with a little bit of white wine (3:1 ratio) and only marinated for 25 minutes. It gave the mushrooms enough kick, but didn't taste too vinegary. Also, instead of using spinach, I used fresh basil and added that to my vegetable saute right at the end. Cooked at 350 for 17 minutes and the mushrooms came out perfectly! Served with onion & garlic rice.

These are terrific.  You are only limited by your own imaginiation in which vegetables to use.  Even DH (meat and potatoes man) loved these and said he can't wait to have them again.

I really hate to give this recipe such a bad rating, but we really didn't care for this at all. Marinating the mushrooms in balsamic for that long made the flavor overpowering and there was just too much acidity going on in the dish overall. Thanks for sharing with us!

These are pretty good. I let them cook a little longer so the ports could get super soft, and also cause the boyfriend's rice wasn't done yet. Choose the smallest eggplant you can find. Choose the deepest port caps for stuffing. Made no alterations, delicious as is!

Mushrooms soaked up too much of the vinegar and was way overpowering.  I had to throw out the mushrooms and just eat the stuffing.  That was an expensive dish to make and it went down the garbage disposal!  Plus, it wasn't hot.  Right out of the oven, the mushrooms were just room tempiture.  Yes, I had the oven preheated to 350 degrees.

So, my husband challenged me to make something with portabella mushroom & veg. That taste good & is healthy. I' ve never used this mushroom before. So, I found this recipe & gave it a go. Followed the recipe except I didn't have spinach so I used squash & I sprinkled parsley ontop.  I added less vinegar & spiced the veg.  I topped it on spagetti squash sautted with olive oil & garlic.Next time I'll try the spinach but, I think it would taste better if it's cooked on the broiler pan so the liquid drains off. I won the bet he liked it.

These were yummy!  As a vegetarian, I am always looking for delicious, healthy recipes.  The only thing I will do different next time is to omit the marinade step.  Like others said, the balsamic vinegar was overpowering.  I think they will be delicious without it, just stuff and bake!

Really tasty and healthy.  I layered it like a casserole and brushed the mushrooms with a mixture of olive oil, balsalmic vinegar, garlic and onion powder and baked for ten minutes.  Then added the sauted spinach and eggplant, layered fesh sliced tomatoes, parmesan cheese, homemade spanish rice, fire roasted green chiles and shredded pepper jack cheese.

it WAS vinegar-y but delish still.  I too didn't have the eggplant so I made it semi-tarian by subing with summer sausasage.  And because plum tomatoes are out of season now, I topped each cap wit a Tbsp of tomato sauce. Be warned that, if possible, find port caps that are deep so it won't be messy trying to stuff them.  Next time I'll try sauteeing the artichoke with the spinach mix.

This recipe is so versatile in that you can switch up the ingredients to go in the "filling" to satisfy your desires!  I was going for super healthy so I used one tomato, marinated artichoke hearts, roast red peppers, spring mix, and eggplant spread, all chopped and mixed.  Then I used one tsp. parm cheese on each mushroom.  I drizzled the mushrooms with white balsamic vinegar, S&P.  Such a pretty presentation, and super healthy too.  Great recipe, Elise!

Delicious, healthy, and easy! I used fresh chopped onion and garlic instead of the powders. I also cut out the mozzarella cheese to cut down on the fat content. The result was hearty and full of flavor!

These were fabulous Elise!! Some members commented on the balsamic overpowering the mushrooms so instead, I marinated them in a bottled balsamic salad dressing and it was perfect.  In addition to topping the dish off with parm, I also mixed some into the filling along with garlic and onion powders. Altho I love eggplant, I chose to use zucchini for this dish. The mushrooms were so darn pretty and I really wish I had remembered to have taken a picture!! My family so enjoyed this and they all thank you for sharing!!

I've never reviewed a recipe before, but I was so unimpressed and disappointed with this recipe. This is partly because I was expecting the flavors to mirror something like I had at a restaurant not long ago (the ingredients are similar), but instead it was very thin. I was hoping for something much more robust. It's a very good start, and the stuffing does make an excellent filling for omelets, but I'm hoping for a way to make the flavors of all the delicious vegetables pop and dance across the tongue. In this recipe as it stands, that is definitely not the case.

This recipe was amazing, however I did make quite a few changes. First off, I followed the advice of others and did not marinate the mushrooms. Instead, I put some balsamic vinegar and garlic powder in a bowl and just dipped the bottom of the mushrooms in the mixture, and also dropped a few drops of it inside of each mushroom, just so that they would have a hint of flavor. For the vegetables, I used finely cubed eggplant, a half a bag of baby spinach and I also finely chopped up the mushroom stems and added them along with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to taste. I layered the vegetable mixture on the mushrooms with goat cheese and cooked for 15 minutes uncovered and 10 minutes covered. My boyfriend could not stop raving about them! They were really perfect. I served them with maple mashed sweet potatoes and white wine.

The vinegar REALLY overpowered the other ingredients, even though I only marinated the mushrooms for about 15 minutes.  Next time I'll omit the vinegar, brush the mushrooms with olive oil and sprinkle them with the seasonings that would have been mixed with the vinegar.  Also, they could have baked about 5-10 min longer than instructed.  These changes might make it five stars :)

This was excellent!  The only changes I made were to rub a little balsamic on the portobellos and bake for 10 minutes before adding the stuffing, as suggested by another review and I added a few chopped garlic cloves to the eggplant and spinach (just because I add garlic to everything).  Delicious!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe is a keeper! I do make small changes. I prefer using fresh ingredients so I use chopped onion and garlic instead of powder. I also use fresh spinach which maintains better color and flavor when baked all together. I saute garlic, onion and spinach together before piling it into the mushroom cap. Also, I have switched out the eggplant for zucchinni when my garden is stocked full of them. Overall, very tasty!

These were fantastic! I left out the eggplant because I don't like it, and cooked them for 15 minutes like one reviewer suggested. They turned out great! This is definitely a dish that will be added to my regular rotation!

The recipe is a great base, however it does lack herbs/spices.  After the initial taste, I sprinkled basil, oregano, garlic powder and (since I like heat) chili flakes on top and it added a lot more flavor! I'll be using these spices in my next bake. I cooked it for 15 mins, but left it in the oven with the heat off until I was ready to eat. Luckily, I didn't marinate for more than 30 mins, so it's wasn't too vinagery. Plus I think adding the spices created a balance of flavor.

I made this as written but only basted the balsamic. It was really good but I nor my family are big balsamic vinegar fans. The great thing is that you can use any salad dressing. I might try poppyseed next time or Girards Champagne salad dressing. Great base recipe. Thanks.

Was pretty good, easy and fun to make. Vinegar was too overpowering though. I also feel like it needed more seasoning, even after salting.

I made it exactly according to the recipe (except I didn't have a full cup of Balsamic Vinegar, so added about 1/3 cup red wine vinegar. )It was the best! I served it with Spanish rice for a carb. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough seasoning in the vegetables, but the marinated mushrooms provided enough flavor.  Enough for 2 meals for us. If you're lucky enough to have a partner who helps in the kitchen, he peeled and cut up the veggies,  so it really didn't  take long to make. I did cook it  for an extra 5 minutes.

Too much vinegar and not a long enough cook time for the mushrooms. It is a really good recipe to modify. Next time I may just add a dash of balsamic vinegar  to the stuffing rather than marinading the portobellos. Also, I want to bake the mushrooms a bit before adding the stuffing. I might leave out the artichokes next time, I felt like they didn't fit with the other flavors.

These were great! For those complaining about the strength of the vinegar flavor, cut your marinade time in half. It's perfect. I served mine with shirataki noodles and a mushroom marinara. Healthy and delicious!

Nothing wrong with the recipe per se; it just didn't have the right balance of flavors.  Next time I will skip the marinade and simply lightly drizzle balsamic over the caps.  I will also use the brine from the artichokes to cook the eggplant and spinach.  I will use only grated Parmesan, since I couldn't taste the mozzarella.

After reading the reviews, instead of marinating the mushrooms in the balsamic mixture I just lightly rubbed the mushrooms with it before stuffing.  Perfect, and the filling is delicious!

This recipe is so flexible and that makes it fantastic. Like many other reviewers, I needed to be a bit creative about what I had in the fridge. I used only 1/2c balsamic vinegar and still had some to spare after marinating. Instead of frozen spinach, I used about 5 leaves of chopped fresh kale, omitted the tomatoes, added in some button mushrooms, swapped shredded jack and cheddar for mozzarella, and I LOVED it!

Marinated for about an hour in balsamic vinegarette, otherwise prepared as directed. Delicious.  Even enjoyed by my husband, who is trying to learn to eat "fungi".  Very pretty.  The mushroom was a little tough, I wonder if that is because of the vinegar?  Could not be fork-cut, had to use a knife.  Other than that, great taste and presentation.

I'd recommend cutting the marinate time by half or doing a balsamic reduction (simmering the balsamic down to a sweeter, thicker state. Balsamic and portobellos are two of my favorite things, so I was a little disheartened that this came out a tad too tangy and overpowered by the vinegar. Still very tasty and presentable.

These mushrooms were way to vinegary!  The topping was ok but my fiance couldn't even eat the mushroom the balsamic flavour was so strong.  Would definitely not make again.
