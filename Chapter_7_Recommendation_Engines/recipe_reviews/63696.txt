I thought this was terrible - the semi-sweet chocolate was too bitter for the strawberries -  The chocolate was so thick dipping - I had to add 3x the amount of whipping cream.

Perfect for those who love chocolate.  If any one has tried chocolate fondue it is very similar.  I do agree with another review however that adding more whipping cream is the best way to make the chocolate richer and smoother.

This is a great recipe -- and easy -- with the alterations other reviewers have already stated.  There is not enough cream/liquid to make the chocolate dippable.  Also, if I don't have cream in the fridge -- milk also works.

With a few tweaks I thought this recipe was excellent.  I used 3 squares of bitter-sweet chocolate and easily covered 15 berries with extra chocolate aside.  I also used at least 2 tablespoons of whipping cream.

the chocolate is not dippable by far and even the bitter-sweet chocolate was too bitter.  i was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews first.

I was thrilled to see a recipe for something chocoloate in my SBD cookbook and made this dessert during Phase 2.  While we enjoyed the taste, the chocolate was too thick and I had to add quite a bit more cream to thin it.
