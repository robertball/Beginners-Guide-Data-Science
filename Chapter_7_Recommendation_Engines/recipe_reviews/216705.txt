It tasted fantastic. I made it almost exactly. I used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple but I pressed the liquid out and I just sprinkled some plain brown suger on top.

This was sooo good. Your absolutly right it taste like a desert. My husband ate it as a desert with a glass of milk. I would cut back on the sugar, just because theres enough sugars from the pineapple and coconut. Overall an excellent side dish

Absolutely wonderful! I didn't change a thing and it was delicious! I make sweet potato casseroles frequently and this has to be my all time favorite. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone who tried it raved about it. The guests asked for take home containers and told me that they couldn't wait to warm it up for leftovers. I agree that it does taste like a dessert but it is a fabulous compliment to a meal. Thanks so much for sharing!

This sweet potato casserole was really good. 

I only used half of the amount of white sugar, and I substituted shredded sweetened coconut for the flaked.

I love candied yams but my husband likes casserole I made it for him, really and had no intention of having any. Normally, I'm a substitutions kind of girl but I made this dish as it is out of sheer curiosity. Holy yum! The coconut inside adds that little extra something and that pecan streusel is everything. 

 I roasted the potatoes in the crock pot the night before and it made quick work of this. I'm so glad I didn't even need to break out the mixer. It's definitely going into my heavy rotation for seasonal potlucks.

OMG, I think I died and went to heaven!  Made it exactly as is, except I substituted macadamia nuts for pecans, which made sense given the coconut and pineapples in the base.  What a wonderful twist on a basic sweet potato casserole!

This was very good. The coconut gave it a different touch and texture. Not sure if I would add it again, but was still good!

It truly is a dessert over a side dish.  I cut the sugar by half and still VERY sweet.  Super easy to make and would make again.

Made some slight variations - diced instead of mashed potatoes and poured other ingredients over. Also sprinkled some mini marshmallows over prior to crumb topping.  Made it for a crowd at a party - was a hit.

I'm a bit new to cooking, so I was looking for something relatively easy to bring to Thanksgiving dinner with my co-workers. This was my first attempt at a sweet potato casserole, and it was a big hit! I've made it twice now, and I definitely recommend the variation that calls for halving the amount of white sugar in the recipe...otherwise it is delicious as a dessert but too sweet as a side dish. I also used a full 20 oz. can of pineapple, and it came out delicious.

For new cooks like me...if you are wondering how many sweet potatoes to mash for this, I used two huge ones (either Jewel or Garnet I think) per full-sized dish.

I doubled the recipe except for the white sugar and the pecan/brown sugar topping and it turned out great. Brought it to Thanksgiving dinner with the family and it was a hit! Everyone loved it.

I made this dish for the first time for Thanksgiving 2016. My wife was out of town and the yams have traditionally been her domain. But since she wasn't here this year, I decided to try something new. This dish was a hit! Everyone loved it. There are no marshmallows on top. The crumbly crust is completely different and made this dish taste more like a desert. Even my grandson who is 20 months old gobbled this down and waved off the turkey and stuffing! Talk about an endorsement!

I cut the amount of sugar in the sweet potatoes in half and added a bit more flour to the topping mixture. It was a huge hit at a potluck! I'm definitely making it again.

It's so good; can really see this baked in a pie shell. For special occasions only for anyone who has to watch calories or sugar because it is difficult to limit portions; It really is that good.

Well I tell you what I love sweet potatoes, yam whay ever we all like to call them we all got different names .  My wife has always cooked a simple casserole . This time I told her lets find some thing different and that's what I did. I'm a sweet and salty kind of guy the hotter the better and a little sweetness to throw it off . So this was great with turkey, Mac and cheese, green beans and bacon, dressing and cranberries. Great recipie thank you for sharing it. Seemed like southern cooking. Do it again sorry no pic got ate to quick.

This was just too sweet for me. Ill definitely reduce the amount of white sugar next time. I made it for thanksgiving this year and my dad said it was good, but put it in a pie shell and call it sweet potato pie!

My son brought made this and we all loved it.  Better than any sweet potato casserole I've ever had.  I would probably cut back on the sugar as it is very sweet.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was the only dish that didn't have leftovers. It was fantastic! I was so surprised by how much I liked it and by how much everyone else liked it. I've been told its required for Christmas too. Thanks so much for this delicious new addition to our family get togethers.

This was without a doubt the most tasty sweet potato dish I've ever had!  Now if you don't like "sweet" sweet potatoes, then skip this dish, but the pineapple and coconut took sweet potatoes to the next level, in my opinion.  Since other reviews had said this was a sweet dish, and since pineapple and coconut were included, I only used half of the sugar that was called for and only made half of the crumble topping (had some left over) and it was amazing regardless and certainly sweet enough. My mom raved about it and in her 93 years of life, said this was "the best ever"!  Made my day!

I have made this every year for the past 4 years for our Thanksgiving dinner. I have extended family requesting that I make it. I use unsweetened coconut, but otherwise follow the recipe exact.
