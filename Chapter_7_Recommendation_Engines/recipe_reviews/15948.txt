This was an average pumpkin pecan pie. Not as sweet as the recipe states. I would have not added the lemon juice & rind because thats all I tasted, even though it was a small amount. The pie will be filled to the top, but cooks down so dont worry about it rising past the crust.

Wow!  This was THE BEST pumpkin pecan pie recipe I've ever tried.  Even my mother (who considers herself quite the pie connoisseur) thought it was the best and had to have the recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

My husband always request a pecan pie for Thanksgiving, but my favorite has always been pumpkin pie. It was great to make a recipe that combined the two. It was very easy and delicious!

This looks really good.  I didn't have or want to use eggs so I used eggbeaters instead.  No sour creme so I used peach yogart...all I could find.  It is very tasty and like the advertisement said not as overpowering as a regular pecan pie.  Kind of light and fluffy.  I'd make it again but only if my cholesterol levels go down and I can use real eggs.

I tried this pie out in prep for Thanksgiving. I added an additional tablespoon of brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves in the pumpkin layer, left out the lemon juice & zest in the pecan layer.  The layer flavors were awesome BUT my crust was raw on the bottom, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.  Next time I will pre-bake the crust for 10 min and then add foil shield when reducing the oven heat so not to burn the crust edges.  Then I'm hoping it becomes 5 star!

I tried this pie out in preparation of Thanksgiving... Used my work collegues as guinea pigs if you will. I first must say that the flavors were definitely there. It was soft, smooth, chewy and crunchy.. My complaint is this. Pumpkin to me seems like it should have been more firm. I even pre baked the first layer 10 minutes (trying to get it distinct) and it was still very soft. And with the temperature, my crust was toast. Totally crunchy black. I set my timer and backed off the oven and the timer went off before I made it to 350... I'm an ammateur baker... well.. beginner is more like it, so I don't know how to fix the firmness, the distinction or the blackening of the crust, but I'm probably not going to be showing off this particular pie for dinner anymore.

I have never been a big fan of pecan pie but I really enjoyed the combination of the two flavors and my family really liked it.

I really was not thrilled with this pie.  I followed the recipe except I left out the lemon juice and rind, as others suggested.  It just did not taste like pumpkin or pecan pie.  I was hoping for the best of both worlds, but didn't get anything that I really liked.  I think I'll try using my own pumpkin pie and pecan pie recipes and try to combine them.
