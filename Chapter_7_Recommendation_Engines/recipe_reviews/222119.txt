I ran the onion, red pepper, carrots and garlic through the food processor to get a fine chop before sauteing it. I wanted a little smokier flavor, I used half ketchup/half barbecue sauce. This sloppy joe recipe was okay--it worked for me because it used ingredients on hand and it was quick to make. I served this with ranch jo-jo potatoes and a veggie platter.

I like sneaking extra veggies in dinner. I should have chopped the carrots much smaller, but my husband and I didn't mind. Children would have. These burgers had a slightly spicy taste. I also lightened this recipe a bit by using Quorn instead of ground beef.

I adjusted for I had ingredients I had on hand. I use ground turkey, a whole red pepper, a whole small white onion, & a whole small Purple Onion. And as I increase the veggies quite a bit, I had increased the amount of ketchup used. Next time I think I might use canned diced tomatoes. It was amazing.  I loved it.... loved it .....loved it.

Fantastic! Super easy and healthy. I used some chilis in adobo sauce to give a kick and added crushed red pepper flakes. Used cabbage instead of bread for fewer calories. Thank you!

Loved it and a great way to sneak in veggies. I chopped the carrots too big the first time and it was a little dry for my taste, so the second time around I used the slap chopper thing we have to get it super finely chopped. I increased the ketchup to a full cup to add a little more moisture and I loved it.

Just made this with a few modifications and it came out delicious ! 
Modifications: 
Added habanero peppers for a kick 
Added cumin, paprika, and chili powder 
User 99% lean turkey breast (only 480 cal for 1 lb) 
LOW CALORIE KETCHUP.  My favorite is G Hughes sugar free ketchup. Trust me on this it’s so good and I prefer it over regular ketchup now. 
Almost 3/4 large red onion 
Used about 3-4 tsp of McCormick sloppy joe seasoning mix but it would have tasted just as good without it I think. 
Used sir Kensington honey mustard (10 cal for tsp) instead of regular mustard.

Also because I used so much veggie my recipe didn’t come out looking like a sloppy joe. It’s packing that dark meaty look but I let still tastes incredible

Delicious and hubby loved it too! Increased bell pepper, carrot and garlic.  Also added chopped celery (same amount as carrot and bell pepper). For the sauce I used ketchup and chilli sauce with a bit more prepared mustard than the recipe called for and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Will definitely make again!

This was very good!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because we are trying to stay limit the amount of red meat we eat.  It was a tad bit sweet so next time I make it, I'll reduce the sugar a bit but I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

The only thing I didn't use was the carrots because I didn't have any and didn't feel like going to the store for just that.  I followed the recipe other than that and it turned out great!  I added some jalapenos just for a kick and it was awesome!  My husband loved it!  Thanks again!

I love this recipe! I have made it multiple times.   I add more veggies - I use 2 small green peppers, 1 red pepper, 1/2 of an onion and 4 carrots and times all ingredients in the sauce (ketchup,  mustard and brown sugar) by 1 & 1/2. Comes out amazing.

My family loved this slightly healthier version of sloppy joes, even my husband who doesn't tend to like anything but the "authentic" version (no healthy substitutions in general) liked this a lot and asked me to make sure I make it again.     

The only change I made was I added a bit of tomato paste (maybe 2 Tbsp) - we like our sloppy joes a bit saucier and I didn't want to keep adding more ketchup because of the sugar etc.    

I also made a vegetarian version with veggie crumble, btw, because I have a son who's vegetarian.   His version came out just as good, though I had to add a bit of liquid to it as the veggie crumble is slightly different in texture etc. than ground beef - I added maybe a Tbsp or two of water and also the 2 Tbsp tomato paste I also added to our version. 

We'll definitely make this regularly - easy, relatively healthy, fun!

Had to change a few things because of what we had on hand, left out the onion (didn't have one), added mustard because we were out of ground mustard, and   used a little less ketchup than it called for (ran out while cooking), but the kids still ate it up and went back for more!

My husband is sort of a sloppy joe snob and he loved these! Next time I will grate the carrots. It was very good. I am going to try ground turkey next time and maybe a little more carrots. Yummmmmy.

Well, it’s now been three weeks since my twin boys Cody and Brody left to attend university. We’ve been in high spirits most of that time, but every now and again we’ll really feel their absence in the house. Their boisterous laughs, heavy panting after a jump on the trampoline, and love of blasting rock music all through the house would fill our lives with light in a way we didn’t realize until it was gone. They loved sloppy joes and this healthier recipe (we’ve got to watch our cholesterol) was perfect for remembering

I prepared a half recipe for my hubby and myself, substituting finely chopped celery for the carrots. Added some tomato puree since it didn't look "sloppy" enough, and a good shake from a packet of sloppy Joe seasoning. It was a tad sweet but we enjoyed it, and I will definitely make it again.

These are awesome! I will never eat them from a can again! I used a whole small onion and a whole small green Pepper. Towards the end Of the 30 min I added 2-3 tablespoons of water to avoid it from getting to dry and be able to get the carrots fully cooked. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

First time I have ever made sloppy joes from scratch. Easy to make and a bit more healthy than canned, especially if you use ground turkey instead of beef.

Vegan (soy protein, beef-less) ground meat with homemade sloppy joe sauce. Instead of brown crystallized sugar, I used agave nectar and added coconut aminos in place of Worcestershire sauce in some recipes. It tastes great!

OMG this was awesome.. bf said this was a roaring success.. i've never made sloppy joes from scratch before other than maybe adding a can of manwich to some ground beef/turkey when i was a kid.. i was running out of ketchup (reduced sugar Heinz) and used about 1/4 cup and 3 tablespoons of it so i added 2 tablespoons of bbq sauce.. left out the brown sugar since the bbq sauce brings a bit of sweetness anyway.. instead of chopping up everything by hand i just threw it all in my food processor to get it chopped super fine.. can't wait to make this again.. ty for the recipe
