A friend of mine that I work with from El Salvador had given me a variation of this recipe.  He didn't include the radishes or the pepper flakes.  He added in 2 medium avacadoes cut into chunks and mixed in with the rest of the salsa.  Very delicious!!

I love this recipe...it's very light and refreshing.  I usually omit the radishes and red pepper flakes. My girlfriend's husband is from El Salvador and her mother-in-law gave me the recipe but there were no radieshes or red pepper flakes.  Oh well, to each their own. To me radishes are very potent. The longer the lemon juice blends with the tomato juice the more flavor you get.  The cilantro adds the perfect zing. I usually put this on top of yellow rice although it can be used with chips.  I have even eaten it w/o anything else, lol!

I substitutes green jalapenos for the red pepper and it tasted a lot better.  If you can handle the heat that is ;).  Tastes great with a bar-b-q or with mixed with rice....

Excellent! I love the addition of radishes! The texture and flavor they add is incredible. It gets spicier the longer it sits, fyi so if you’re a heat wuss like me, you might want to keep an eye on the pepper flakes. I think using jalapeño or other fresh chilies in place of the flakes would make this a five star.

We love a fresh tangy salsa... with summer and fresh radishes from the garden this is even better than when we made it this winter(radishes aren't so strong)The radishes give a unique hot flavor... thanks for a fun alternate version to a fresh salsa.

I liked this a lot but only gave it a three because I would next time make some changes.  I think more radishes would be good, and I thought a whole lemon's worth of juice made too much pool at the bottom.  Really good flavors though, very nice.

Too spicy for me but Husband enjoyed it. I would like to make it again as a previous reviewer suggests - with a fresh jalapeno instead of the red pepper flakes. Thanks!

This was my first attempt at making salsa and it didn't fare well.  I'm not sure the exact amount of "1 bunch cilantro" but the amount that I put in... probably a 4th of the bunch I got at the grocery store... was way too much.  We couldn't even eat it.

Wonderful salsa! I make this according to the recipe (well, maybe an extra radish or two, depending on size). I just love it!! Very different and refreshing!

This recipe was not for me. Had no flavor or heat. The red pepper flakes ruined it.

Personally I felt this could use more than just 2 radishes (I shredded mine in to a fine grate, so that may have been why I felt that way). Otherwise, nice fresh flavor! It's almost completely gone after just one sitting!
