I make a variation of this recipe all the time - saute garlic and onion in EVOO, add a can of chickpeas and a can of tomatoes.  Throw in some curry powder, red pepper and whatever else (turmeric, ginger, garam masala)....

Delish :)

Very similar to chana masala. A can of coconut milk 'smoothes' out the curry flavor- and don't forget to add sauteed onions, if you can, it totally makes the dish!

I used a half a can of diced tomatoes that also included onions and green peppers.  I also added a bit of cumin (to taste) and served it over rice.  My boyfriend loved it!  It tastes even better the next day.  This recipe shows some promise...play around with it, I say.

This recipe gave me a great start and often you just need a basic idea to get you started.  I started by sauteing mustard seed in a bit of olive oil.  It pops for a while, then add chopped garlic, spices such as curry, basil, cumin, red pepper, etc. and saute a bit more.  Then add tomatoes and garbanzos with some veggie broth and the key ingredient, 1-2 T fresh lime juice, and simmer for 15-20 minutes (while the rice is cooking!)  yum!

I loved this recipe, just like one I make on the stove, only faster!  You can add spinach (canned) too, and it's great!!

I'm really into chickpeas right now so I thought I'd give this one a try.  I made a couple of changes to this recipe. I sauted some garlic and onion then added the chickpeas and tomatoes.  I used the stovetop rather than the microwave.  I also cut down on the amout of curry, I used 3 tsp and it was enough for me.  I made white rice to go with it. This recipe was ok, although I don't know if I'll make it again.

Not sure why my review was deleted. Anywho- this was a good, basic dish. I don't have curry powder, so I used a bit more of the garlic powder, added some crushed red pepper flakes, and a bit of pizza sauce for added flavor. Thanks for the post, YummySmells.

The only good thing about this was how easy it was to make.  The portions seem off -- WAY too much curry powder.  All in all, it was a little bland.

Easy enough, but not very great tasting. It needs something- but it's okay for a quick lunch.

It wasn't bad, but you can get tired of the strong curry taste very quickly. Maybe it would work better in a smaller portion as a side-dish.
