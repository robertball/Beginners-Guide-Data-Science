I was hesitant about making this in the crockpot since my family doesn't like meat done this way. I liked the idea of baking it the last 30 mins. so I gave it a try. We were all pleasantly surprised. I had 16 chicken legs and two crockpots so I put half in each. I did one recipe exactly as listed. Very very very yummy!!! The other I used one of the variations from the reviews and instead of the hot sauce, I used some chicken broth. I also added sliced onions and two cans of mushrooms because my kids don't like spicy foods. This also turned out wonderful! I served both varieties with cooked rice. I poured the juices over the rice. We loved it. This is my favorite recipe from this site. I'll use it again and again. Thanks!!

These were so good!  I used Texas Pete hot sauce, cooked in crock for 2 1/2 hrs., placed on a cookie sheet, splashed on more Texas Pete, and baked in the over for the last 1/2 hr. of cooking time.  They were perfect. I normally remove skin from chicken, but I left it on this time. My husband, who hates chicken skin, didn't even notice because the outside was so nice and crisp. Everyone in my family wanted more, and they all asked me to make them again soon.  Not only were these very good, but they are super easy!

This is good recipe!  I'm not a big fan of dark meat but a friend bought a huge package of chicken legs and I needed a good recipe so I made these for Christmas dinner to accompany the main dish.  I must admit I changed it a little only because I wanted crispier texture but juicy so I rubbed the legs in olive oil, seasoned, and let them marinate in refridgerator overnite. I used a package of 13 legs so I had to adjust seasoning to the amount of chicken.  I baked them on 350 for almost an hour without foil.  Placing butter pieces on each leg during this hour.  I took them out the oven and covered well with the hot sauce.  I baked them at least another half hour.  I served them with Bob's blue cheese dressing also from this site with fresh cut celery.  My family loved it!  Thank you.  Note: I used seasoning salt instead of iodized, or kosher and fresh black pepper.  Did not measure, just covered well. None of the other ingrediants were changed.  Be careful with your seasoning salt because the hot sauce with provide additional salt.  Thanks again, it was definitely a hit!

I actually read through all one hundred seventeen reviews before making this one, and I was more confused than when I began. I almost was just going to cook them in the oven instead of the crock pot, but went ahead and put 12 legs with the skin on in my large crock-pot after rubbing them with pepper, cayenne, paprika, onion and garlic powder mixed with some light butter spread. They pretty much fit on the bottom, and I used Franks hot sauce because that is "OUR" hot sauce. I just covered the top of the chicken. Only cooked on high for 2.5 hours and then removed and cooked them in the oven at 400 for thirty minutes, then put them back in the juice in the crock until we were ready to eat them, leaving it on warm. They were actually very good. I do think the crock pot is needed to lock in the juice, and the oven to seal the deal. I made the Absolutely Best Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese dressing on AR for dipping.

Not just like Buffalo Wings, but still quite tasty.  My crockpot book suggests sauteeing chicken with the skin on in a few T's oil before putting into the crock-pot.  Do this if you think you may eat the skin.  If not, don't bother, its just extra work.

Good recipe! I Highly recommend putting it in the oven to make it crispier.  It looks awfully pale without browning.  It might also work to brown before placing in the crockpot.

This just tasted like chicken with hot sauce.  I'll do it again, but not in the crockpot. The crockpot made it accumalate too much juice and I just had to reseason the chicken and put it in the oven.

This is SO Yummy!  This was an immediate and enthusiastic winner with my 3 teens and husband!! I followed the recipe except I used a combination of legs and thighs, added a couple of dashes of Liquid Smoke, and used less butter - only  1 T.
I removed all the skin from the chicken - it was very moist and the flavor was awesome.
I did place in 400 oven for 30 minutes after the Crockpot.
I served it with hot cooked buckwheat and we spooned the excess sauce over the chicken and the grain -- rice or any other grain would work just as well.
I will definitely make this again as it was a real family pleaser.

I actually joined this site JUST to review this recipe.  :)  It's getting five stars for one reason: it is the FIRST meal I have ever cooked that got such enthusiastic thumbs up from not one (that's easy!) but both kids.  And my husband loves everything I cook, so his opinion doesn't even go toward this rating, although that would just cement the five.  :)

Yumy yumy yumy--I got love in my tummy.  Made exactly as is.  I like the idea of NOT browining prior to putting in the crock pot.  I thought the idea of this recipe was to have "hot wings" with out all the calories----and it delivers. I used only 7 chicken legs and Smart Balance butter.  This would be great to take to a potluck.  Thanks for the recipe.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  I followed the recipe exactly how it said and the chicken legs turned out moist, tender, and SOOO flavorful!  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent.  I added some chicken broth during the cooking because I didn't feel the hot sauce was enough to make the chicken not dry.  I also added onions under the chicken.  I did as most suggested and I put in oven for last 30 mins to make it crispy.  When the chicken was in the oven, I took some of the hot sauce/chicken broth out and mixed it with some corn starch.  Once it was mixed well I poured it back into the crockpot with the remaining sauce to make a thicker sauce.  I made rice to serve with the chicken and poured the sauce over it.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and came right off the bone.  The sauce was delicious and perfect with the rice.  This recipe is definitely a keeper...in fact, making it for the second time in a week. :)

Not very good. Not hot and/or spicy. More like boiled chicken than anything else. I am an excellent chef. When I read this recipe I didn't think it would turn out to be tasty. But the reviews convinced me to try it anyway. I should have listened to myself and not the reviews.

A wonderful recipe.  I slow cooked the chicken legs for five hours and that worked just fine.  I stuck to the recipe with the exception of adding cayenne pepper, a dash or two of liquid smoke and diced onions.  Before placing the chicken legs in the oven, I brushed barbeque sauce on half of the chicken legs for variety.  A word of caution.  When baking the chicken legs, be careful not to bake too long as it will lead to dry chicken.  You may want to check the chicken after 15 minutes and determine your remaining baking time.  A big hit at our home and a good winter dish to be served with brown rice and steamed vegetables.

This was great for our 16 pack of chicken legs my wife purchased on a bargain buy. I made this for the Superbowl and I was only able to eat 1! Everyone licked them right up and had their plate polished. I didnt want to just have "boiled chicken" so I first fried the legs in a little bit of oil, then slow cooked them, then threw them in the oven for 20 minutes, then back into the crockpot when ready to be served. Perfect texture, NO meat was left on the bone and tasted great. Everyone enjoyed how they tasted like chicken wings in a way, but they were actually able to get a bite full of meat instead of chewing it off of the bone and getting in their teeth. Good recipe, very easy, and not that spicy.

Very good and easy! I actually did the oven version since it was to late to use the crock pot. Baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes and they were perfect. My 4 year old ate 3 legs so make sure you make enough!

4.5 Stars! With my changes.... 
I didn't have time for the crock pot- so I prepared the sauce on the side with melted butter. 

-Seared chicken in coconut oil
-Tossed in sauce
-Baked at 350 until 160 degrees (about 30 minutes)
-Sprinkled with paprika and parsley and broiled until crispy. 

The sauce was great- chicken was super moist! Husband loved it!

Great recipe, especially if you love buffalo wings but not the calories and fat. no need to change this recipe, however I did remove the majority of the skin from the drumsticks, leaving just a small amount for flavor.  If you don't like extreme hot, use "Franks" hot sauce.

THIS was a wonderful idea!  We are a large family of seven and I'm always looking to make the things we love more frugally and that take less time. The flavour was very good. I broiled them in the oven for 10 minutes at the end of the cooking time. It was a hit for us!

This was an extremely easy and tasty meal.  It smelled really hot while cooking but could have used more kick.  I skipped putting them in the oven and enjoyed them right out of the crock pot.

My husband enjoyed these because they were spicy but not too hot for him....You absolutely should crisp in oven because they look sad and not so delicious right out of the slow cooker.

I made this with omitting butter and still turned out awesome.  i spiced the chicken before putting it into the crock pot and also used a crock pot liner for easy cleanup.  i cooked for 2 3/4 hrs and cooked in oven the last 15 min adding some more franks hot sauce, i love hot foods but this turned out great!!!!!

Delish!! Made exactly as the recipe says and it was FAB. The second time I made this (yeah, I made it twice), I cut the crock pot time by 1/2 hour and finished at 400 in the oven. Not worth the effort. The original way was just as good. Thank you!!

Very good. I left mine in my crock pot for about six hours on low. The meat fell off the bones it was so tender. I don't care for skin but cooking it this way didn't bother me at all.

These are too hot for me but my husband LOVES them!  I bake them for about 50 minutes in the oven on 350 versus using the crock-pot.  Delicious!

I usually only buy boneless, skinless chicken breast so when I bought drumsticks I was not sure how to cook them.  This was an easy meal that everyone loved.  I did bake for the last 1/2 and think that made a big difference in at least the look of the chicken.  The chicken was very tender and fell off the bones.  Will definitely make again. *also I put the chicken in the slow cooker frozen and it still was great!

Follow directions exactly, but was bland. Wasn't very flavorful. Basically chicken in a hot soup. Not sure if I will try again!

As good as our hot wings. Cooked in the slow cooker for 2 hours and then put them on the charcoal grill. I made a batch for the adults and another barbecue one for the children. Put the kids drumsticks on the grill also. Served with blue cheese & celery sticks!!

This chicken was very good and easy.  I think it needs a little more seasoning is not that spicy.  Also the browning in the oven really makes it turn out nicer.  I will fix this again.

I took another reviewer's advice and baked for the last 30 minutes. I used some of the liquid so it wouldn't stick. I added more hot sauce and seasoning before putting in the oven. Big hit with the family, they loved it!!

I was very hopeful about this recipe.  Is it easy? Yes.  Is it edible? Absolutely.  My only issue with it was it needed....MORE.  I was worried it was going to be too spicy but it was the opposite.  It kinda made me thing of a watered down version of my favorite wing place and kinda made me want to go there and eat LOL.  I MIGHT make these again in a pinch, but, they need something.  Possibly to be broiled or baked a while after the crock pot....i dunno.

Really tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, but took them out after 2 1/2 hours and baked for about an hour longer on 425.  Really good!  Also mixed up some more butter/hot sauce mixture to pour on top before serving with blue cheese dressing and celery. Delicious, thanks!!!!

This is very similar to an oven baked buffalo wing recipe that I make. I decided to try this out so that I wouldn't have to go through all the trouble of cooking them. I used drummettes (I was trying to make finger foods for a lazy Sunday) and coated them with flour before putting them in the slow cooker. This gives them a bit of a mock breading when they cook. I ended up cooking them for about 3 hours on low (since they were smaller) and then broiling them to crisp them up for the last 15 or 20 minutes. I also flipped the drummettes half way through and spooned more sauce over them. They turned out so tender and delicious! My husband was loved them and had no complaints!

This was great.  I added lots of spices to the legs and covered in louisiana hot sauce wich I think I will vut back on next time cause my 3 yr old loved it so much she wouldnt quit eating it but she cried almost the whole time cause it was a little to hot for her.  I think next time I will use bbq instead of hot sauce.  I did out them in a 400 oven for 30 min and they were perfect.

This one is a keeper.  I seasoned the legs with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika and browned before placing in the crock pot with the hot sauce and butter.  Husband loved it, and the next day I took the meat off the bone and let it cook in the sauce.  Great with the blue cheese dressing.

I tried this recipe tonight using one large oval slowcooker for 12 very large chicken drumsticks.  I followed the recipe with the exception of stopping the cooking in the slowcooker after 2 1/2 hours, then finishing the meat off in the oven 30 minutes at 350 degrees. They were most appetizing with a crunchy skin.  They were just the right amount of heat!

I have been doing this recipe for years, as it makes great substitution  for chicken wings(quit buying wings years ago when the price skyrocketed) I have experimented with many  variations such as adding sweet & sour sauce, adding a couple drops of liquid smoke, adding a tad bit of vinegar and  other things, all come out  great ( of course as always it's a matter of personal tastes & preferences )  these  are a hit with any small get together or small party.

Fall off the bone type, not bad except the skin was slimy.  They need to somehow be made a bit crispy.

Although these drumsticks were nothing like "hot wings" I found this recipe to be just delicious.  I used my favorite buffalo style hot sauce and halved the recipe since I didn't want to make so much of something I had never tried before.  I did the legs in the crockpot for 2.5 hours then it only took about 20 minutes for them to get good and crispy in the 400 degree oven.  I wonder if this recipe would work well for BBQ sauce as well?  Served with rice and sauce.  Yum yum.

I was not impressed with this. I also found that the flavor didn't go through the meat (where it did, it was good but....). Maybe if I left the skin on and baked it afterwards it would have been different. The sauce was so thin it didn't even stay on the chicken. As is, it was not that flavorful but it was easy. I will try this again and take the advise of others by leaving the skin on and baking afterwards.

This was just the recipe I was looking for. I had a package of drumsticks and didn't know what to do with them since we weren't able to use the grill. 
I added about 1/4 cup of Gates Hot & Spicy BBQ sauce to the red pepper sauce and cooked this in the oven because I didn't have time to wait for the slow cooker. It turned out great! My boyfriend loved it.

Chicken legs are one of our least favorite meals (which is why I didn't give this recipe more stars) but this was a really good recipe. We didn't dip in the blue cheese dressing or bake in the oven to finish them off and I would make them the same way again. It didn't smell too great while it was cooking but tasted good (had the flavor of mild chicken wings).

This was very good but even when I used Texas Pete's, Tobasco, and Melinda's Habanero Sauce it was a little bland for me. I think cooking it in the oven is a good idea.  I tried the last 30 on the grill and it just peeled off the skin.

These were good.  After baking I served them with the leftover sauce from the slow cooker and ranch dressing on the side.  I was able to get 12 legs into my slow cooker by putting them in vertically - meaty side down.  I'll make this again.

I enjoyed them to some degree. They weren't the slam but they were tasty. I would make a few minor adjustments and that is to use dark meat and remove the skin because it is much more tender and juicy,the flavors just soak into the meat

OK.... maybe the last 30 min in the oven did wonders (I didn't do this).  It's about what I expected out of a crock pot.   I don't think it's anything special.  I probably will try it again though.

Didn't use crock pot--short on time.  I used 16 substantial chicken legs, mixed butter, red hot, spices (no salt) and a splash of vinegar and baked 50 minutes.  Then took to cook-out the next day and reheated on the grill with a little extra Frank's Red Hot and served with blue cheese dressing.  Probably would have cooked in oven just a bit longer as the drumsticks had more meat.  Will try with crock-pot --as the flavor was good.

This is a good recipe. I'm guessing you could do this with many flavor profiles. The most important part is to finish in the oven. It looked gross and unappetizing to me right our of the crock. Mine only needed 20 minutes in the oven. The whole family liked it.

Delicious. Definitely toss them in the oven at the end to let the skin crisp up.

This is such a fantastic way to make unique and delicious chicken legs! My husband and I loved this recipe. We used Frank's Hot Sauce, generous on the butter (we love butter) and drenched it in the suggested seasoning, and some of our pepper flakes. Baked it until I was satisfied with the crispness. I also only had access to leg quarters, so I also cooked thighs. The meat was just spicy enough inside and out from sitting in the juices.... so simple and perfect!

We loved it! I followed the recipe as written and finished it in the oven with a light spritz of oil and a 2nd batch of sauce for the last half-hour. I've never used hot sauce before and wasn't sure what to expect, but I got the most wonderful crust on it that was spicy enough to bring a few tears to my eyes. Neither of us are fans of blue cheese so I skipped the dressing, but even my boyfriend enjoyed it so much that the next day he suggested that we go buy more chicken. I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce - now I wonder if I dare go with something a bit hotter? Chowsito, thank you for sharing this delicious sinus-clearing recipe!

Been making hot legs instead of wings in crockpot for years. I also take them out and put them in the oven to finish cooking and add other sauces such as bbq, teriyaki, Asian sweet and spicy.Really any kind of sauce works. They are the best, meat just falls off the bones soo tender

I pretty much followed the recipe. It's not your typical buffalo chicken, but it was delicious. You could put any marinade on the chicken and cook it in the crock pot on high for 3 hours and get tender, excellent chicken drumsticks. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe was pretty good. Make sure you use a "hot" enough hot sauce, otherwise the chicken will be pretty bland. Also, baking it in the oven for 30 minutes is essential! I'll be making this again.

I didn't think this would be 5 stars - way too easy and minimal ingredients.  Well, I was wrong!  These turned out delicious and were the perfect "crispiness" after finishing off in the oven.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Even though we used the required amount of hot sauce, our teens didn't think it had much flavor. I would alter this next time and add more seasoning. It was a cinch to prepare.

I was super disappointed with this recipe.  These were not like any chicken wings I ever  had.  I finished them off in the oven, but unfortunately they still weren't crispy.  The skin was just soft and fatty.  none of the flavor was in the chicken at all.  So, I ended up just pulling the skin off and dipping the chicken in the sauce that I saved from the recipe.  Definitely won't make again.  If I want good chicken wings, I'll just go to a restaurant to buy them.

I really, really wanted to like this dish because of how easy it was to make. The legs were spicy and the meat did fall off the bone, but we thought they were just ok...nothing special.

very simple and a go to when drumsticks or leg quarters go on sale.  I split the recipe and use my little crock pot b/c it is just my husband and I.  I add a little vinegar to reduce the heat of the tabasco.

Keeper!  The way I did it: Sprinkled a little Cajun spice on top instead of the onion and garlic powder. Did not use the blue cheese dressing and it was still great.  Thank you for submitting recipe.

wow, SO EASY--and very good--may try and slow cook for 2 1/2 hour and then bake as 1 reviewer suggested--not sure, it was very good as it was--but, I will have to make it a little spicier next time or find a hotter hot sauce--great, easy meal.  Update: Used Sriracha sauce and cooked 2 hours in the crock pot and remaining time in the oven cooked it perfectly to our liking so that we could eat the skin as well.

This recipe was pretty good, I took the recommendation of others and baked for the last half hour, which made it brown and crispy. It looked pretty pale and unappetizing before that.

Hey, this Recipe was very good.  I usually don't eat chicken drums unless cooked on the grill.  I followed the recipe as called, pending on available ingrediants. Used Franks Red Hot inplace of the called for pepper-sauce, and fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  My wife drained all the sauce prior to serving, although I saved some for dipping.  The fresh blue cheese added the final touch.  I left it in the slow cooker for 4 hours, then transported over to my mothers house. We reheated in the oven for 15 minutes, just to warm it up. -  We all enjoyed, thanks for the Recipe......

I wasn't sure if I would like this because I've never had drumsticks in the slow cooker, but it turned out pretty good. I did cook it for 20 min. in the oven at 400 which I think you really should do. I added more hot sauce when I put them in the oven.

I love this recipe.  It is quick and easy.  I even used the sauce on chicken breasts and in the oven. My boyfriend loved it so much he just had to take it to work for potluck.  The second time I made it for him I added some lousianna hot sauce to make them hotter.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was really easy and the chicken was flavorful. I think the next time I prepare this recipe, I'll use a hot wing barbecue sauce instead of regular hot sauce.... I tried this recipe again using Texas Pete Buffalo Style Chicken Wing BBQ Sauce and I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Delicious!!!

Wanted to do something different with legs that I had thawed, so I tried this.  We grilled rather than baked them at the end, but next time I think I'll try the oven method.

Good recipe. I added more sauce and butter and baked it the last 30 minutes.

It was good. I'd use less hot sauce... Since I dont like blue cheese dressing.. I used ranch and it was great. Also, I cooked them in the oven instead of a slow cooker.. and cooked until crispy. Mmmm!

I doubled the recipe and I ended up with tons of juice in the crockpot basically boiling my chicken.  I HAD to bake them and pour off all that juice just so that I wouldn't be serving a weird drumstick soup.  I had to put more of the hotsauce on the chicken when I baked it because it mostly came off boiling in all the juice.  Overall very  tasty, but not exactly what I was expecting.

This was very simple.    The first time I used the recipe exactly and it was just fine.   The second time I used some chicken broth in place of hot sauce, seasoned as specified and then put in the oven  for 30 minutes and it was great.    This is for those of you who don't particularly care for hot sauce.    You could, also, put some barbeque sauce on the last half hour and that works, too.

I used 4 leg quarters cut into 8 pieces leaving the skin on.  The crock pot was basically full of skin grease after 2 hours covering most of the chicken and washing off most of the spices.  I made the hot sauce mix again...put the chicken in the oven at 325 spooning the new mix over the chicken, then spooning again every 15 minutes.  It was very hot and very good.  I also added a tad of liquid smoke...mmmmmm...liquid smoke.

AMAZING.  Using a whole bottle of hot sauce sounds like it's going to be too hot and not enough flavor, but this turns out AMAZING just following the recipe.

Very tasty, but not just like chicken wings. I also added a little habanero sauce to give them even more of a kick.

I thought this would be like hot wings only with chicken legs. Nope, not even close. It's just chicken legs cooked in the crock pot. I could barely taste the hot sauce. And my choice of sauce wasnt the problem since its the same one I use with my wings. I guess this recipe didnt live up to my expectations hence the disappointment. 
But the meat was good dipped in bleu cheese dressing.

It doesn't get much easier than this!  My first time to use slo-cooker for chicken and it was very good and moist. Did not put in oven and would probably add a little extra cayenne as I like things quite hot.  This was mild. Great for when the guys come over for the game!

No changes made to the recipe. I made it for Super Bowl this year instead of wings & it was a big hit.  I even made it when we had company from Texas; they liked it so much they asked for the recipe & have already served it at a recent family barbecue.

I did cook in slow cooker on high for 2.5 hours, I removed the legs and placed them on a baking sheet, added pats of butter to each leg as well as another shake of hot sauce per leg and baked at 400 degrees for another 45 minutes to get them nice and crispy, they were very good, will  make them again.

I would definetly make this again!
I used legs and  thighs (skin trimed, or removed).After cooking in  a Crock Pot, I cooked them on the outdoor grill 10-15 min (turning over half way). I severd with additional sauce..BBQ sauce also went well!

Excellent! Though one the people I cook for can't abide any noticeable spice. So I nixed the hot sauce, used 1/2 cup butter (cubed) and sprinkled a tiny bit of chili powder on them.

Maybe someday I'll use some Tabasco... when he's not eating here!

This was surprisingly very good! I adjusted the serving to 3 and followed the proportions. I did add sautéed onions, some curry powder, and cumin powder. I also added both broth and hot sauce. Mine was done in two hours and 15 minutes. It was fall off the bone, so juicy and tender! I skipped the oven. I really liked the texture as is.  My husband who is very picky said he is taking this for his lunch! I'll definitely make this again.

I just made a mix of the softened butter with all the spices and rubbed it  all over the legs. To avoid that pale pasty look, I first used kitchen bouquet browning sauce then seasoned them with the butter spice mixture.

It tastes great and it is quick and easy to make.   I did not need to put it in the oven at all, it was amazing straight out of the crockpot.  Because you do not add water to this recipe,  the chicken legs  actually end up crispy on the top. My husband loved them.  We did not even use blue cheese to dip in, we used the juices left over in the crock pot as our dipping sauce. Will definitely make again.

Overall, this is a great dish. I made this dish in the past and really enjoyed it. The second time I made this dish, I used skinless chicken thighs and Sriracha sauce in place of the Louisiana Hot Sauce. To neutralized the heat a bit, I used a tablespoon of raw sugar (I was out of honey). It came out just as good as the original dish... just a different spicy flavor.

I was pretty skeptical about this recipe at first, since it seems as though it would simply taste like chicken smothered in hot sauce.  However, after baking it at 400 for 30 min (you MUST do this step!), it was incredible!  The meat fell off the bone and the skin was nice and crispy.  The flavor was a lot more complex than I'd anticipated, so that was a welcome surprise!  I'll definitely make this again since it was super easy!

Made some changes, therefore can't give this version a 5 star.  I started by taking the skin off the drumsticks.  I mixed BBQ sauce with cayenne pepper to replace the hot sauce, cooked them for 5 hours in the crock pot (12 drumsticks), and finished them in the oven as suggested.  This is a great way to use the crock pot to cook drumsticks, thank you for submitting this.

Very good!  I used a very mild buffalo sauce and cooked for 45 minutes in the oven on 400 after the slow cooker.  The husband said it was better than the chicken he cooks on the grill!  Now, that is a compliment!  We add this to the meal rotation for sure!

This was good, but not as great as I expected. Just a bit lackluster in flavor after cooking that long. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a lot of red chili flakes as we like spicy stuff at our house.  I did what most others said and put them in the crockpot for 2 1/2 hours, then in the oven for 30 minutes, then back in the sauce in the crockpot for a couple minutes on warm.   We're kind of foodies in our house so maybe that's why we weren't that impressed. Great in concept though and the meat was super tender!  This cooking process gives me other ideas for cooking drumsticks!

It was ok to me, but my guests enjoyed it.  I removed the skins as I did not want a lot of fat sitting in the pot for hours.  Cooked for about 2.5hrs on high then last 30min on low.  The chicken fell apart as I removed it so I ended up having to make shredded chicken instead of drumsticks.  That was not planned so put me behind on the rest of the meal.  I added some worchestire and vinegar to match Chef Johns Buffalo sauce.  Next time, I will either brown/sear the drumsticks and follow other suggestions to crock pot for about 2hrs then bake.  Without the extra juice mixed in, it was a little bland.  I think browning will go a long way.

Good but nothing special.  We ended up with a pool of hot sauce "gravy" that I guess I should have used to baste the chicken legs during the last hour or so.  It was good over rice.

i didn't want to have to crisp them up, like reviews said, to serve it as drumsticks, which is what you expect from drumsticks. instead, i changed up the recipe for a one-pot meal.  i filled the crockpot with a large head of sliced cabbage and topped it with chicken thighs, seasoned with the onion powder, garlic powder and frank's red hot (no butter - and i didn't miss it).  it was reallllly good and i served it with rolls.  the juice that comes out while slow cooking makes it good to dip the rolls in.  it's kind of like an open faced buffalo chicken sandwich... it's not a pretty meal, but it's delicious and REALLY easy!

Halved the recipe since it was just for me and my hubby.  I did not add as much butter but kept the Frank's Hot Wing sauce at 5 ounce.  We love things spicy!  I also rubbed the chicken with a bit of cayenne, pepper, garlic, and onion before placing it in the sauce.  Didn't crispen in the oven, but I didn't leave it in that long because I do not like dry chicken.  Best served with some starch - rice or potatoes.

These were fantastic. Great flavor, not overly hot, and so easy. I used tabasco hot sauce, and cooked in the crock pot for 2.5 hr, then convection oven on 400 for 20. Perfect!

Loved the flavor, No fuss to put in slow cooker and finish in the oven, did take a  little longer than 30 min in oven  but worth the wait.

Tender chicken, but the hot sauce really didnt add much flavor...i am not so sure i would say the crockpot made it taste like hot wings...but it was a good way to get tender chicken.

These drumsticks are really good and really easy. This is my second time cooking them and this time I used franks hot sauce  and i also recommend cooking them in the oven or the last 30 minute to give them a nice brown color and i serve them over brown rice. Next time i will try barbeque sauce

I've prepared this on quite a few occasions. Very good and spicy (the way I like it). I usually don't use the full amount of butter required. I've also tried it with chicken thighs and chicken legs. It can also be prepared in the slow cooker (with the skin removed).

This was a great recipe.  I decided to rub the spices into the chicken, and cook in slow cooker for about an hour prior to adding the hot sauce, then added the hot sauce for 2.5 hours, then removed, brushed and coated with hot sauce again and cooked in oven for 30 minutes.  We gobbled them up.  We like HOT in this family and they could of been hotter.

These turned out pretty good, but I did stray from the instructions a little bit. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked chicken in slow cooker for 2.5 hours on high. I then placed chicken on a greased cookie sheet and baked in oven for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. This gave the chicken a little crunch, otherwise the meat pretty much just falls off the bone. I would definately do it this way again in the future.

The chicken was really juicy but it was really spicy!!! I only used 2 onces of hot sauce rather than 5 onces. i couldn't imagine how spicy it would be with 5 onces of hot sauce!

I gave this a 3 star only because of the convenience.  You would think it would be flavorful with all of the Hot Sauce, however it wasnt.  The flavor didnt seep into the meat.  I removed the skin so there was no need to place them in the oven maybe thats what was missing.  Wil not make this again no time soon.

Very, very good! Will make again. I did end up finishing them on the grill, I didn't realize my crock pot was unplugged, and ran out of time. Will make again for sure. I don't measure, just dump in ingredients. Yum.

Excellent.  Fast, easy & very tasty.  My husband immediately said I should make this again. With few ingredients, this is a great take on buffalo wings.  The flavor penetrates the meat since it's in a crock pot.  I added a smidge (1 Tablespoon) of BBQ sauce and some Chinese Garlic Spice hot sauce to make the sauce stick to the meat since it wasn't sticking with the recipe as is. Aside from that, cook as is.  So good & so simple.

Just okay.  Not visually appealing.  I even put it in the oven for the last 30 mins as suggested by others.  It was hot... but not really that flavorful.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and put in the oven for last 30 min. My family found it to be very bland, there was no spice to it at all and very little flavor. The kids dipped it in the redhot after it was done to give it some flavor.

These came out as really a really nice milder "wing taste."  My husband enjoys the wings typically sold at sports bars I often find the wings there to be too overpowering, these were a great compromise and family friendly as well.  I removed the skin prior to cooking, and as a result the flavor of the meat was excellent, perfectly seasoned and perfectly moist and tender.  I used Frank's Red Hot in the recipe for the hot sauce.  I served it straight from the crockpot with celery and blue cheese dressing.  I used 10 drumsticks, as I wanted the remaining ones from my package for another recipe.

I liked it, but used an air fryer.  They turned out as well as could be expected.  But I think I prefer wings due to the amount of sauce they can hold and meat that is contained in them.  With legs, there is a lot of meat, but you lose the sauce after the first bite.

I made these using 5 oz. of Sriracha instead of the hot sauce, they came out mildly spicy and not overly hot. Tossed in some extra Italian Seasoning I had lying around. Sauce seemed on the light side for slow cooking, but it was actually about right in the end. I did have to cook on high for an extra hour (4 hours total), and baked afterwards at 400 for 30 per the recipe. They turned out good. Pretty versatile recipe for tweaking with what you have around the kitchen and pantry.

Used a Ghost Pepper Sauce. Delicious!!! 3 hours on high in slow cooker, then 15 minutes under the broiler to crisp up. Simple but very tasty! Served with Spanish Rice, celery and carrots with Ranch dressing.  A favorite for sure...

We loved this recipe but made 2 tweaks: I don't add butter because I saw no reason for it. Also, Since it is liquidy after I take them our before baking I add sauce and extra seasoning to the ones with less or no sauce.  Gonna try with barbeque sauce too!! Yummy!!

Love these. I first made them entirely in the crock pot, the next time I used the oven as several reviewers commented. I even turned on the broiler the last few minutes and that was perfect.

Really good, I used wings, but only 10, probably more meat than 12 drumsticks, so next time I'll have to add a little more sauce and flavoring.

This was fantastic! I don't even like drumsticks, but I had some so thought I'd try this. I followed the recipe including the must do step of putting them in the oven after to crisp them up. I added additional Franks hot sauce before I put them in the oven and they came out hot and spicy and crispy on the outside and tender inside. They were really good, the whole family loved them. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellant!   I used my electric multi cooker so I browned the legs first, than slow cooked at low 4 hours.  Half an hour in a 400'F oven finished them off.  They had just enough spice for me!

I rubbed the legs with a mixture of Pepper, Paprika, garlic powder and onion powder then I put them in the crock pot and put small dabs of soft butter on them.  I had 4 drumsticks and about 2 Tbps of real butter.  Then I shook on about 1/2 of the 5-oz bottle of Franks Hot Sauce and cooked it on high for 3 hrs.  Then I took them out of the crock pot and put them on a cookie sheet lined with Parchment paper and put them in a 400-degree oven for 30 mins as others have recommended.    They were wonderful and tasted just as good cold the next day.  I will definitely make again!

I used sriracha in stead of red pepper sauce and added adobo to the seasoning. I also didn’t really abide by the portions in the recipe when it came to the spices, I went much over to really cover the chicken completely.

This was a super easy recipe!  We aren’t really big on legs but they were a great price but this will convert to wings and this is the best basic starter for s wing chef I have seen. You can add from this and teach yourself and learn what your family likes. I did follow someone’s suggestion and put them in the oven for 30 min on 400  to finish them.

I followed the recipe as written but after cooking, took it one step further.  I placed the chicken in a pan and made another batch of sauce, brushed it over the chicken and baked it in the oven 1/2 hour to brown.  The sauce in the crockpot was not good anymore as it was diluted from cooking with the chicken.  This is why I gave it the 4 stars.  I did buy chicken at the store that was enhanced per the package label not the bird on the farm which meant who knows what was in this bird.....This dish had great flavor and will make again!

Just sprinkling the spices on top don’t do much for the flavour on the pieces underneath. Next time I would make sure all pieces got seasoned. The flavour was good but I would also try baking them after.

I was hesitant to make this recipe because generally when you put chicken in a crockpot with sauce, the chicken becomes slimy and the sauce turns to soup. I gave it a go anyway because the ratings were so high. It came out exactly as I expected. The chicken skin was slimy and the chicken was just floating around in a pool of hot sauce and butter. None of the hot sauce or seasoning actually stuck to the chicken. It wasn't spicy at all. It literally just tastes like boiled chicken.  Do I think this recipe could be altered to taste good? Yes... any recipe can taste good if you make enough changes, but the recipe that is written here just isn't good.

Very tender, juicy and tasty! The suggestions in other reviews to cook at 400 for 30 minutes after leaving the crockpot should be a requirement. Since you only use 5 ounces of hot sauce, I recommend brushing additional sauce on the chicken before putting it in the oven.

I thought this might be fun to try and was pleasantly surprised.  Good, quick recipe for a day when gardening all day was a priority.  However, I did use a spicy BBQ sauce with a bit of chicken bone broth to liquify more, added 3 chopped green onions, 3 chopped garlic cloves and a mushroom spice that included dried mushrooms.  Served it with black beans and a caribbean style rice.  Delicious.   Thank you!!

I made this recipe only because I had drum sticks and all of the ingredients on hand.
I admittedly, was very unimpressed. Like many of the other posts here, I agree that they come out looking very anemic and pale. You definitely have to send them to an over for some additional time for shear color and a bit of crisping. 
As for the flavor.... meh.... just chicken with hot sauce.... 
Nothing to write home about there.

This was my first time ever cooking in a crock pot, so I followed the recipe to the T. This was absolutely fantastic and (unlike my family) I love Blue Cheese so the reccomendation for it was phenomenal. Couldn't be happier and has inspired me to cook more crock pot recipes!!! I'd have uploaded a photo but they were eaten too quick lol

what i liked about the recipe was that is was quick to make but really did not have to much flavor.  Possibly  because i used Crystal hot sauce instead of a different brand?

Easy, delicious and great flavor throughout!   Not hot, just tasty.  I eyeballed the garlic and onion and probably used closer to a teaspoon of each.  I had 9 very large chicken legs and cooked them for 4 hours. A keeper for sure!

Just awful. The chicken was over cooked and didn't have that much flavor. Next time I'll just skip the crock pot  and cook entirely in the oven.

That had to be the worst chicken I've ever made or eaten.  In fact, after the first one, I couldn't eat it.  My husband braved through about 4 drumsticks because there simply wasn't anything else to eat but this chicken is completely awful.  Way overcooked. It tasted very much like what I would imagine shoe leather to taste like.  Really REALLY bad.  Not recommended at all. There's no saving this one.  As long as it's 3 hours in a slow cooker at high it's going to be overdone.  YUCK!

When the chicken was finished in the crock pot I made up a small amount of sauce and brushed the drumsticks then put them on the grill long enough to get the outside crisp. This was 
easy and the flavor was not only on the outside it had cooked all the way through the chicken .  I will fix this again.

It wasn't hot enough for us. I followed the directions to the "T", it just didn't have the kick.  I suppose I can kick up the heat next time.

Chicken was tender. Bland. Will not make again. Better in oven. What's the deal with the reviews. They are really out dated.

Disappointed. Chicken doesnt get crispy as i imagined or anticipated. Not spicy either. Chicken did fall off bone and meal wasnt a total loss but did not turn out they way I expected

Started out exactly as written. The sauce needed something  because I wanted to use it over rice. So I added equivalent of a packet of dry ranch dressing mix and about 1 cup of homemade greek yogurt and heated it. It was great over rice  this way and toned down the heat of the buffalo sauce just perfectly.

I halved the recipe and used legs/thighs.  After about 3 hours in my crockpot on high, I took the pieces out and sprinkled a little more garlic powder and pepper on the ones that were "underneath", then cooked for 15 minutes @ 350 in my convected oven.  Great flavor, and super easy!

These turned out well for me. I broiled them and then threw them in the stove top, because I don't have a slow cooker. I mixed all the ingredients and added paprika. Then poured them over the chicken legs. Cooked for  a little while and the sauce was not sticking to the chicken legs well. So I put them back in the oven for the last 30min. and I thickened the sauce on the stove with cornstarch and it worked well. I poured more sauce on them. They came out just like chicken wings. Covered in sauce.

I used chicken legs instead of drummettes.  I even cooked it the last 30 minutes in a 400 degree oven.  The flavor was yummy but there was no crispiness.  However, it is an easy meal in the crock pot.  Not something I would take to a gathering, but fine for home or leftovers at work.

Followed  recipe exactly and it came out like a mush not  what it should have. Couldnt serve it to my guests and couldnt make it into something else. Very dissapointed. First time in a slow cooker with this recipe.  Next time in the oven.

Came out great. I added a little chicken broth to the hot sauce and poured it over the chicken along with all the other ingredients.  Cooked it for three hours, then baked it for 15 minutes, skin was nice and crispy.

this turned out great and the chicken was juicy. I did use other suggestions and cooked in the crock pot for 2 1/2 hours and stuck in the oven at 400 for 35 minutes. PERFECT!

I used breast meat. I stabbed it with a fork to create holes for the sauce to get inside better. I can't have that much fat in my diet so I changed to white meat. I thought it was really good. Next time I am going to cut the chicken in cubes and cook it in the sauce then serve them as hors d'oeuvres with toothpicks in them for easy eating and less clean up. For a sweet kick try adding a bit of honey.

I used 5oz. of hot wing sauce for this recipe but I used only 4 legs and 1 giant breast that I sliced into 1/2" strips, then halved the rest of the ingredients.  This was nice and spicy and very tender. I served it with rice and my husband spooned the sauce over the rice.

I made it exactly as described, with baking it to crisp it up.  I have to agree with most people that this was not particularly great.  Not bad, but seemed like more work than should be needed for "buffalo" spiced legs.  Next time I'll try another recipe that is just cooked in the oven.  Cooking in slow cooker is great if I don't have to finish off in another place, and there is no way I'd eat this recipe right from the crock pot.

Notes to myself: I baked them for 45 mins at 375f. Not long enough and not spiced enough. I changed too much the original recipe and didn't come out as good as I imagine it being.

It wasn't that great. It was okay.  I followed the instructions to a tea and wasn't impressed by it.  I even added another 30 minutes on and put it in the oven to make sure the meat was cooked thoroughly.  dissapointment.

It was ful of flavor and a very juicy Chicken Leg. The recipe was easy to follow, and I plan on making this at my future cooking parties.

I took the recommendation of baking it for the last 30minutes, but before I put it in the oven I added some more Frank's then baked it at 350°F. I served it with veggie sticks and homemade french fries- pub night at home!

Overall this recipe was good! I just made two minor alterations: first, I added about a quarter cup of flour to the crock pot after noticing that the sauce was quite thin (this helped to thicken it up nicely), and second, I used blue cheese crumbles instead of salad dressing (just a personal preference). For the hot sauce I just kept it simple and used Tabasco. It was REALLY hot, but that's kind of how it's supposed to be!

I followed the recipe, and then baked at 400 for 20 minutes and broiled for another 5 minutes or so.  My family really liked it.  It wasn't nearly as spicy as I was expecting, but it was still yummy.  It was something different and easy to do with chicken, so I appreciate the recipe.

Husband and teen approved. I used drumsticks, wings and chicken strips. Once I removed them from the crock pot, I placed them on a cookie sheet, brushed on additional buffalo sauce and baked at 350° for 30 minutes.

Absolutely great.  Made it exactly per recipe (but with 6 drumsticks) using a Mexican hot sauce.  The flavor had penetrated completely through the meat.   The meat fell off the bone.  Next time, I'll try browning the chicken before slow cooking and then baking for the last 30 mins just for crispiness/variety in the texture.  I can see a peppered bacon working into this well, too.  Super low effort, thanks for posting this recipe!

This was very good! Would do it again! Tweaked it a little..I added fresh mushrooms and diced onions to the slow cooker as well as a little Liquid Smoke. Gave it 2.5 hours on high in the slow cooker, then spread out the chicken on some heavy duty foil on a baking sheet and gave it 15 minutes in the oven at 400. The gave it about 10 minutes under the broiler to make it good and crispy. I cut up leg quarters so I had legs and thighs. While the chicken was in the oven I added some corn starch to the sauce and thickened it up some, then added it over some rice. Also served with celery and Blu Cheese.

I browned the chicken seasoned with garlic, lemon juice, and used potato flour/gluten free breadcrumbs(I'm celiac).  Then it all went into the slow cooker with the hot sauce(mixed ones we love here) and a little bit of water and butter with the rec. spices.  Came out great. I know family would not have liked it without the browning first. We loved it.

Great recipe!  I used a spicy hot BBQ sauce, garlic salt and pepper.  As others have done, I used my Crock Pot on high for 2.5 hours and then baked on convection 375 for 25 minutes with more BBQ sauce.  Wonderfully tender and moist!

This chicken was pretty good. Easy recipe with ingredients that are usually on hand.
I kept  the ingredients the same, except by using half the butter in the crock pot and the other half , I melted and mixed with some more hot sauce and then
 brushed on the drum sticks before baking.

Paired this with http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/231988/twice-baked-potato-casserole-with-bacon/
Came out great just eye balling the ingredients. Had two layers of drum sticks in my crock so I made sure everything was covered with sauce and other ingredients. Used Sweet Baby Ray's sriracha wing sauce. Putting the chicken in the oven the last half hour gave it a great brown color.

I had some left over frozen chicken breasts from another recipe. So, to use them up, I decided to follow this recipe. I didn't have the blue cheese salad dressing it asks for, so I made my own with mayo, feta cheese, apple cider vinegar, salt and brown sugar. Everything else in the recipe, I used. I didn't slow cook this as long as the recipe recommends because I HATE over-cooked chicken. The end result was absolutely great! These flavors go together so well and I will save this recipe with my accidental variations.

I made this tonight. But I changed it a little bit. I added a whole jar of hot sauce and a whole stick of butter. Also I added some chicken broth. I cooked it for about 6 hours on low. It was so delicious, and was falling off the bones. I will definitely make this again in the future.

I was surprised that this was decent since it was made in a slow cooker, but I will probably stick to cooking in the oven in the future.  Definitely cook in the oven at the end to crisp chicken.

I followed the recipe except I cooked on low for 5 hours. The meat fell off the bone so I scooped that up into a pan and baked for 30 minutes.  I served over white rice and it was very flavorful.  I thought that much hot sauce might make it too spicy but it was really enjoyable.  I did not use the dressing because of using the rice.

I added about a cup of Marinara Sauce to make what my Granpa used to call "Sauce Meat" Topped with the Blue Cheese dressing ala sour cream. Used some Indian Naan bread to dip in the sauce. Also added some Adobo seasoning for a more exotic flavor. Great stuff!!

Sriracha sauce works very well as the sauce to cook this in, much thicker and will adhere to the chicken, the oven is a great idea and use more of the sauce then also. There are some Asian sweet hot chili sauces (May Ploy)that also are great with this!

I loved this!! I cooked it in the oven for an 1 1/2 at 400 degrees, since I used half the pack of chicken legs for a recipe my mom loves (Oven BBQ Chicken Drumsticks, on this site), and I just followed that recipe. My little brother couldn't get enough, and I ended up only getting 2 out of 8 chicken legs. I will definitely make this again.

Yummy and easy! We used Gunslinger for the sauce, and it's the best. I will bake the legs the last half hour next time I make them because so many folks recommended that, but they were delicious and tender right out of the crock pot. Definitely making them again!

These were really good, but I also baked them at 400 for 30 minutes with more sauce.  It made them look better and took some of the crock pot flavor off.  I had 10 legs in this batch, but could easily have put more in there.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that when done I put them on a cookie sheet and under the broiler in the oven for 5 minutes, then turned them and broiled the other side for 5 minutes. Then I put them back into the crock-pot and sauced them back up. They weren't as spicy as I expected them to be. And while I won't say that they were as good as hot wings, they were an easy substitute.

My family thought this was good. We put it in the oven for the 30 minutes and that was a good thing because it tasted so much better that way. We also added a little extra hotsauce/butter mixture on top before serving to give it a little extra kick. Very good. Will be making this one again!

Well since I live near Buffalo and we're all about the wings.  This was ok....not spicy enough for me.  Would reccomend baking to get it crispy.

3+ stars.  So this one was ok for us.  I'm not a huge fan of the slow cooker unless it is meat your going to shred.  This one was just ok for us.  Thanks for sharing.

I was really looking forward to these but ended up siding with the "not much flavor" camp of reviewers.  Baking in the oven the last 30 minutes definitely helped, but the sauce just doesn't stick to the legs very well.  Must say that it tasted better the 2nd day.

We were not fans of this dish. The legs fell apart in the crock, and the pieces retained very little hot sauce flavor.

These are sooo good. I used texas pete hot sauce and cut the recipe in half. My husband who hates the skin gobbled the skin up. Next time I might try and bake them the last 30 min. to crisp the skin? but really it's not nessasary. I served with rice and the sauce over the rice is yum yum. But spicy so beware!
