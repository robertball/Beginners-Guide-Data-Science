I loved this recipe! I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth. I also added a twist and added chunks of chicken and fermented garlic as well as bell pepper and mushrooms to it and it turned out amazing. I highly recommend this and use this as a good base and add some garlic chili paste to really spice it if you like it spicy

Great soup! I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth in the recipe to give it more flavor, and added some cubed and cooked chicken breast as well. Curry is also always a must when I make soup that has coconut milk in it. The lemon was a nice touch of flavor, but I felt a whole lemon was just a little bit too much. If I make this again, I'll probably use only the juice from about half a lemon.

Was really great and the family ate on it for a few days. Needed a little extra flavor somehow, but I am not a talented enough cook to make a suggestion one way or the other. Either way, this one will go in the recipe box.

Delicious! And very quick and easy to make. My very picky toddlers even ate some of the cooked yams I pulled out of the soup!

I added onion and a yellow pepper diced up. It was so flavorful and a great balance between sweet and savory. Thinking about making it again as a start to Thanksgiving!

I wanted to really love this but mine turned out very lemony and it was OK but not phenomenal. Will probably not make it again.
