These were soo easy to make and very cute!  Looked like real toes!  I took them to a halloween potluck for my husbands unit and they went so fast i didn't even get to try one!!  I even won the best dish contest and my husband gets a 3 day weekend!!  I used corn tortillas because i didn't have flour and they worked great, i think it gave them more flavor!  I also soaked the toothpicks in water so they didn't burn! I will def make them again!

I changed this slightly to make Mummy Fingers because I wanted to make them for dinner rather than as an appetizer.  I used hot dogs and cut small flour tortillas in half, sprinkled the tortilla halves with cheese, then rolled them up with a hot dog in the center.  Secured with toothpicks and baked.  When they were out of the oven I took out the toothpicks and the melted cheese held the "bandages" down.  I think they turned out really cute and were a fun, spooky, quick dinner for Halloween.

Great party idea, and my bad for not following the recipe to get the nails to look quite right.  I think adding something inside the wrap would make it better (maybe even something a little sweet?).  Also, if I do this again, I'll add red food coloring to ketchup (make it really 'bloody') and drizzle more on the 'bandages'.  Might even try to find a wrap that looks more 'bandage-y'.
