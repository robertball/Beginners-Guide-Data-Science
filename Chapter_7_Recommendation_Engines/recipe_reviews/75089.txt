I made this into a casserole. Added cheddar cheese and parmesan. Also a little milk. Topped it off with panko bread crumbs. My son-in-law went back for second and took some for his lunch the next day. I will definially be making this again.

I thought that these were quite good.  I did add sour cream, pepper, and shredded parmesan cheese to them before baking.  The squash really complimented the potato.

I thought these were great.  The filling was a little runny (I didn't let my squash drain very long) but it ended up fine after the final baking time.  I think I'll see if I can get by with less butter next time and still make them taste flavorful and good.  Great combination!  Thanks!

Really good!  I never thought to do this.  I used a Gold Nugget Squash that I've been wanting to use up.  Awesome idea!!

I made a rendition of this recipe with yams. I think they are more moist which gave them a nice smooth texture. I refilled the skins and broiled them 'til their tips browned. I toppped them with a caramel sauce, then sliced them into appetizer sized pieces. A wonderful dessert :) Thanks for a great basic recipe, I'm sure I'll make it a thousand ways.

Awesome recipe... i used tiny butternut squash and filled the shells of the potatoes and the tiny squashes made such a nice display on the table. Sprinkled fresh parm. on the top with salt.  Delish!
