This is a great smoothie recipe.  I absolutely love Vanilla Almond Milk.  I do use frozen berries which of course makes it a frozen smoothie that stays so nice and cold till the very last drop is gone!!  Also sometimes I'll put a couple of teaspoons of creamy peanut butter in the blender.  I have also added protein powder on occasion.  If  you use Soy Milk, I highly recommend you switch to Almond Milk for anything and everything  you make!
