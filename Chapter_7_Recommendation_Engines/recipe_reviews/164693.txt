I tried a very similar recipe years ago and the meatballs did not taste good until they had simmered in a crockpot on low for several hours, giving the flavors a chance to "marry". Let them hang out a while in the slow cooker and they will taste much better.

The rice krispies in the sausage meat made the meatballs chewy as if they were still raw.  More of a main dish served on a bed of rice, than an "appetizer".  Would not make again.
