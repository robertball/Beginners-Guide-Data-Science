Important: Do drain the roasted green chile, or else the mayonnaise will become runny. This was delicious, whether with Monterey Jack or Mexican quesadilla cheese.  I tried it as written & it was great, but I do prefer stronger flavors so more (roasted) jalapeno & fresh cilantro was added. This was a different way to spotlight green chile on a burger. Here in New Mexico, chopped roasted green chile is offered with all burgers (including the fast food burgers), as is, topping a burger like lettuce or tomato. In Bobby Flay's recipe, he has put the green chile only in the mayo, making a stellar condiment for the burger.

This is a great sauce.  I used the small food processor and whirled the chilies, jalapeno peppers, garlic and cilantro together and stirred into the mayonnaise.  Very tasty.

Yum! I doubled the cilantro, used fresh jalapeno instead of pickled, and I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese so I topped with crumbled queso fresco. Delicious. Thanks :)

Only used the sauce from the recipe....used another SPICIER burger recipe, so I'll only review the "chili sauce" here.  Didn't care for the stand out flavor of mayo which still dominated the flavors.  We also made a chili lime sauce (recipe also on this site) which just totally spanked this one.  I won't give it one star though, cause it didn't exactly taste BAD.  Just not good.  Forgettable.

Yum! These were really good. My boys (hubby included :) loved the mayo sauce. We will be making this again. Simple and delicious.

These were excellent!  I forgot to buy pickled jalapenos, so I had to improvise a bit.  I made the mayo mixture and the burgers as written, but topped them with Pepper Jack instead of Monterey Jack cheese and I did not brush oil on the burgers before grilling, but I did oil the grill.  This is a keeper.

Seriously delish! I left out the jalapenos because I'm on the wimpy side-loved it! Even my hubby, who HATES mayo, loved them & ate 2. We dipped our fries in the leftover sauce. Will DEFINATELY be making this again!

These were pretty good. I think they would have been better with sour cream instead of mayonnaise, the mayonnaise taste was too overpowering.

Really Good, I only used 1 1/2 TBSP jalepenos since I was a little scared for the spice, and I felt it was perfect.

I made this for the Recipe Exchange group recipe for the week of May 17th. This was just ok for us. We'd have preferred to just put those seasonings into the meat and omit the mayo. (We'd also then slather it with A1, because we love A1 that much.) There's nothing wrong with this recipe at all, just, didn't knock our socks off. Thanks for the recipe :)

This is beyond a 5 star cheeseburger! We absolutely LOVED them! I chopped the chilis (which I drained most of the liquid from) and garlic in the food processor then stirred in the mayo and jalapenos (omitted the cilantro-not a fan) because I didn't want it to be too runny. I had some mushrooms to use up, so I sauteed those and put them on the burgers along with the cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion and served on a toasted Hawaiian bun. This recipe is a sure winner and I will be using this OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)

My husband actually said, "Yum" out loud at first bite. Can't get a better review than that. I forgot to pick up the jalapeno peppers and I think this would have been out of this world with them, next time! (skipped the cilantro, I don't care for it)
