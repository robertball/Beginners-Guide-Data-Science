Very good! Light, healthy, and delicious! Even my husband liked it and he does not like salads. The sweetness of the fruit and dressing and the great taste of the toasted nuts sort of hides the lettuce--good for people who aren't salad fans.

This is a very good salad. By accident, I bought red grape juice and used red wine vinegar. It just made it that much prettier and better. I made this for Christmas. It was a hit.

I made this salad for a dinner party and it was a hit! Several people asked for the recipe. When I
made the dressing maybe I was alittle heavy on the vinegar, so i added sugar to tame it somewhat.
They raved over it! Also it seems to bring out something wonderful with the strawberries. A keeper!!

We used this at our first supper club and it was delicious!  What a great way to start off a great tradition.  We used pistacchio nuts instead of macadamia nuts and it was just as good.

Outstanding salad.  I made it two nights in a row and did not have any extra kiwi fruit.  I used green grapes instead with pistachio nuts. It was wonderful.

Excellent!  Even my picky daughter loved it.  I made it at Thanksgiving to raves from all.  I usually do it by the recipe, but when I didn't have all the ingredients, I sustituted sliced grapes, slivered sweet onion and chopped walnuts.  It was every bit as good!!
My family wants it all the time now!  Thanks!
