Really nice muffin. Simple and tasty. I replaced all the oil with applesauce. I also substituted some whole wheat flour for the white flour. These are great even without frosting.

I haven't tried the original, but like others, changed some things to make a little more healthy -- and the group I served them to tonight LOVED them. Thanks for posting the original recipe -- it was a great starting point!!!!

I used half all-purpose flour and half high-altitude whole wheat flour (I tried all whole wheat earlier and they were too dense) 
added a little more cinnamon, plus 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
Used a little less sugar 
I replaced the oil with nearly a cup of applesauce
I added about 1/4 cup of golden raisins 

I used muffin liners and sprayed them with non-stick spray. I had to cook the muffins about 25 minutes (I don't know if it's because of the altitude 6,000+ or because of applesauce). 

I used one batch of frosting to do nearly two dozen muffins (don't like it too sweet).

YUM! i followed the recipe exactly, & i really luved how these turned out! my dad said that they were "dang good", & my mom said she "really liked them". (i made 'em 'cause i had to stop my mom from buying a pack of four from the store, & was buying carrots anyway(she really likes stuff w/ carrots in 'em).(i like to bake alot) ya sure, the pack of four at the store has 4 bigger ones, but this recipe made 12 smaller ones-amount totally makes up for size. i even was able to use my dessert decorator to use to put the icing on them-quite a bit of fun using that thing. i was kinda worried that the icing would be too thick, but luckily it came out fairly nice(out of the decorator). i will SOOO make these again!!!! DELICIOUS!

These turned out amazing!  I used whole wheat flour for that "healthier" feeling. (good thing since I ate 6 myself) They are great without the icing too.

i followed the recipe exactly but did not make the frosting. due to the amount of baking soda (or, pehaps due to the baking soda i used being a few years old :S) there was this awful metal taste to the otherwise good muffins. also, the muffins had a strange red tinge to them; again, probably due to the baking soda. but, aside from that, the texture was good as it was light, fluffy, and moist.

This makes the best tasting carrot cake ever! The cream cheese icing is a nice addition as well! The recipie was super easy (I made it as a cake as opposed to muffins) I made it twice and everyone loved it each time!

Very, very good, natural carrot muffin. The batter recipe and icing recipe make more than enough. I have small-ish cupcake pans, perfect for typical cupcake liners, and this recipe made 18. I'm glad I didn't double the recipe. I did add 1C chopped walnuts with the carrots, and the batter handled it just fine. The only way to improve this would be a little stronger on the spice(s), if you like them spicier. Our family of 3 is quite pleased. I'm holding onto the recipe and will use this anytime we want carrot muffins. Not heavy at all, but not too light, either. Also, I followed the recipe exactly, and baked for 20 minutes in a weak gas oven.... no problems with the directions. Beautiful.

Just read all the reviews...I don't know what people are doing wrong..But...this is the third time I have had to print this recipe...I am a slob lol.  I have made these 8 times or more...ALWAYS perfect.  I do add nutmeg ( love the stuff) and I never bother with icing.  just butter them.   curiously though sometimes cooking times need increasing???  go figure.

Fantastic recipe! Don't know why my muffin bottoms came out a little wet though. Maybe it's my oven, or my muffin tin. I will try this again! I used half the oil, and substituted the rest for applesauce. A good first muffin-baking attempt for me, I reckon. : )

These were light and fluffy, exactly like it says! We took these to the cottage, so they were made for a couple days before being eaten -- still  as good as always! Everyone loved them. To make storage less of a mess, I put the icing in a ziplock bag, snipped a corner and squeezed icing onto the cupcakes whenever we ate them. Less mess and hassle!

Great, especially if making a full carrot cake is not in the cards.  Helps control serving size for those of you who live with cake addicts.  Also used baby or snacking carrots which are a little sweeter.

Great muffins! Kids loved them use apple sauce I instead of oil and instead of icing I mixed some butter with brown sugar and sprinkled it over the top of the muffins. Will definitely make these again.

These muffins are truly "fluffy"! They are not at all heavy like many carrot muffins are.  I recently made over 400 of them for a function.  They are easy and came out absolutely perfect!  In addition to the frosting, I decorated the tops with rice crispy treat nests filled with jelly beans!  Perfect for Easter!

I thought these were pretty good. I used apple sauce instead of oil, all whole wheat flour and only 3/4 cup sugar.  They are a very moist and flavorful. My three year old ate 4 (without the frosting) and is now asking for another.  I guess that means he approves as well.  The frosting is so good that I don't actually care about the muffins. I would eat that stuff slathered on tree bark.

I am amazed at all the rave reviews for this recipe. I am not sure if I did something wrong, but the final product tasted like baking soda for me! May be if I reduced the baking soda to about 3/4 tsp this recipe may  have worked.  I followed the recipe to the T , it did not work for me. I will have to look for the recipe in foodnetwork.com. This was a disappointment. :( I am glad this worked for a few!

Delicious! :) The only thing I changed was, instead of 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, I added just a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon with 1 tsp. nutmeg and a dash of ground cardamom. They turned out perfect !!

I make these, but pretty much have come up with my own low fat version, I use whole wheat flour, and apple sauce (1 cup) in place of the oil...I have even gotten to the point where I make the apple sauce myself to avoid the sugar in the pre-made kind, plus I like the slight chunkiness mine adds...I also add raisins.  I use splenda in place of the sugar, but that's just me....everyone raves about these muffins!  I sometimes add the frosting (using low fat cream cheese) and sometimes not)

I thought these were perfect.  I will admit that I made a few substitutions but not because I thought the original recipe was lacking - some were intentional, others not.  

Intentional: I used half regular flour, half whole wheat.  I also used a little prune puree and used a little less oil (not much) to add extra nutrients - they were for a friend who just had a baby.  

Unintentional: Uhm, I ran out of everything (her visit was sorta last minute) - ran out of carrots - it takes quite a few to make 2 cups so I shredded some apples too (unpeeled for what it is worth).  I also ran out of cinnamon so only had a little left and subbed allspice instead (I was going to use nutmeg and cinnamon both anyway so it is was good from a flavor perspective).  Finally, I ran out of sugar (I know, I know - why I am even bothering at this point) at about 2/3 cup so I used powdered sugar and for the remainder but didn't make a full cup because of its density difference.

Overall, they were fantastic.  I would probably do the whole wheat again and maybe even the apple as they were really moist and wouldn't mind if I had to do it exactly over.  It made closer to 15 muffins in my tins.

These muffins are awesome and so is the icing. I made them for my son's teacher's birthday as a healthier treat. I could also see offering these as snack for kids without icing. My husband's favorite is carrot cake and he adored them.   I added some raisins. I replaced half the oil with apple sauce, which I think it made them a little dry -- but still very good. I also used India Tree Natural Dye because my son is very sensitive to artificial dyes. I've uploaded a picture, mine look organic and natural :-)

I wish I could give this recipe 10 STARS. That's how good this is. I didn't even try the frosting because according the other reviews how good the muffin was without it.  I think  this is FABULOUS they way it is. NO FROSTING NEEDED. I just added a dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp more cinnamon. Don't let this one get away.

I made these muffins for breakfast one morning, and they tasted so flavorful and moist! My family loves them, and now I make them often. I personally feel they are sweet enough without the frosting, so I just dust them with powdered sugar. Overall a great recipe.

These came out oily and bitter. They taste like I left the sugar out even though I did not.

Unfortunately these muffins were disappointing. I followed the recipe to the letter and although they came out nice and fluffy they had a strange metallic taste from all of the baking soda. I will not be making these again.

I just made these muffins and they turned out nice and fluffy.  I used cupcake liners and they did not stick.  Hopefully my daughters will like them, I put a few chocolate chips on top to entice them.  I baked them for 24 minutes.

Awesome Recipe!  These turn out amazing when made with the oil, or apple sauce!  And they freeze wonderfully as well (a must in our house).  My husband and son ask for these constantly :)

Just made these exactly as recipe calls for. I even ran out of vanilla and they were sooo good. So light, fluffy and moist, definitely a keeper recipe.  I was a little confused on the frosting part, it was all crumbly when I was mixing it with my hand mixer, so I stopped and used a rubber spatula to mix it together and it was fine.  Thanks for the recipe. Deelish!

This is a great recipe as is I'm sure, but I did make some modifications based on my mood/preference.   1) I used 1/2 AP and 1/2 Whole Wheat Flour 2) I used 1/2 c veg. oil and subbed the rest using ground flax seed with cinnamon (yay fiber) 3) Added raisins and walnuts to mix 4) Used a little less sugar, not sure how much just "eyed" it 5) Added a few shakes of all spice. I also made a few mini muffins so I could snack while the big ones cooled. :-D I didn't prepare the frosting since I'm pregnant and want to attempt to control myself (I knew I'd be eating as many of these as I could before my husband got to them so I figured I'd skip the extra sugar.) They taste great straight from the oven although I will experiment with freezing a few of these. *If you double this recipe, you won't regret it!* Thanks!!

I was looking for a moist muffin, and this is just what I needed. I made it with 3/4 cup of oil, but the next time I used 2/3 c. and it was better. I might try the applesauce substitute sometime...Delicious without any icing!

These did not turn out for me. The one thing i changed was putting 2 eggs instead of one. The insides of the muffins caved in and the outside was very crunchy and tasted gross, even after putting the cream cheese icing on top. I wouldn't make these again.

If you've ever wondered what the taste of baked rotten eggs tastes like, this is the recipe you've been dying to try.  And once you have, you're taste buds will have died, forever.  Keep a bottle of whiskey nearby to try and wash away the gross after taste.  When that fails, at least you'll be drunk and won't care.

I made this using whole wheat pastry flour,  half white  sugar and half yellow, half apple sauce in place  of half the oil,  a bit of extra cinnamon and a bit of extra grated carrot. They turned out moist and yummy and my kids love them. I got twenty four full-sized muffins and 24 mini muffins from a double batch. Oh and I didn't bother with the icing...not necessary!

Great texture! Wow these turned out really light, nice crumb, great rise - an easy recipe that adapts well. I was looking for an easy & healthy carrot muffin recipe as I've never been able to make a batch that didn't have sunken tops. A few reviews complained about a heavy baking soda taste and although it is perceptible, they were still yummy (maybe shifting dry ingredients together would have fixed this). I liked that the recipe calls for 2 cups of carrots - many use only one grated carrot. As with others, I made substitutions: 2 eggs and 1 tbsp flaxseed with 2 tbsp almond milk to replace third; 1 c whole wheat flour instead of white. 1/3 c oats and 2 tbsp of almond meal (roughly), 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 of oil, plus added ground ginger, nutmeg & cardamon. Baked for 22 min. Delish with or without icing, bookmarked!

Very moist and flavorful, caved in a little in the center. I added a pinch of cloves and nutmeg and used coconut oil. I think I am going to add some unsweetened coconut flakes next time as well.

This recipe was real good... I didn't have enough carrots on hand so I decided to use what I had which was probably a cup and then I did a pineapple upside down with this as the base... So I placed a cherry in the middle then some pieces of diced pineapples around it then I added the extra pine to the batter as well as a little of the pine juice...

Theses were good but a little too oily. I think next time I will do half oil and apple sauce and I will do half white and brown sugar. 

I also put half carrots/apples

Mine just came out of the oven. I used unsweetened applesauce as the oil substitute. The only other change was using 1 cup white flour and the 1/3 cup ww and a sprinkling of nutmeg.  They looked great coming out of the oven. They rose well and were completely done in 25 min. Though they are moist, and not dense, there still seems like there's a little lacking without the frosting. But once the cream cheese frosting is on, they taste great. I made one batch of 12 regular muffins and then another batch of 12 mini muffins and the batter gave me 8 additional regular size muffins. One batch of frosting covered 12 reg and 12 mini. The 8 remaining I will freeze. Thanks.

These muffins were delicious even after a few health-tweaks! I replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce, used 1/2 wholewheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour, and used brown instead of white sugar (3/4 cup). Also, I made them irresistible (say my friends) by adding a little extra spice: 1/4 tsp ginger powder and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. YUM!

These are yummy!!  I made a few substitutions.  For the vegetable oil (which I don't cook with anymore), I used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. melted coconut oil.  They were good enough on their own to eat, but needed a little something else.  I didn't have cream cheese, so I whipped up a little glaze using confectioners sugar and orange juice.  My 5- and 7-year-olds love them, and so do I.  Thank you for this recipe!!

Delicious, moist, and easy! For a healthier version, substituted sifted wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour and applesauce instead of oil. Yum! Will add raisins and walnuts next time. Delicious with or w/o icing. Everyone loved them :)

I'm in love with these muffins! My nana said they were the best muffins she's ever had. I reduced the sugar in the icing by 1/2 a cup, as I prefer a less sweet icing. Turned out fantastic! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

this was my first time making muffins, so I didn´t have much expectations, but these were outstanding muffins, tasty, soft, and humid!!! the came out perfect.
I put some colored stars on it and ask kids to help me, the little ones realy loved it, they would never say it had vegetables on it.
PERFECT CHOICE FOR BEGINNERS!!!

I have recently started baking so when I saw this easy recipe with ingredients I already had, I thought I would give it a go.  And it turned out really well, so light and fluffy!  My husband doesn't like frosting so I just gave it to him as is and he loves it.  I am definately going to be making these every week. Also, it made 18 muffins and not 12 - which was a bonus  :)

Excellent recipe.  Used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. vegetable oil.  Made into mini muffins and piped a dollop of frosting on top.  Perfect bite sized morsel.  A great way to get a "vegetable" into my kid!  :-)

These were good.   I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and the oil down to 1/4 cup.  I added about 1/2 c applesauce plus some flax seed and used whole wheat pastry flour.  I also added raisins and unsweetened flaked coconut (1/2 c of each).  My 2 year old LOVES them plain.  I frosted a few - those were my favorite.  I will definitely make these again. (1/4 c cream cheese = 2 oz)

These carrot muffins were absolutely delicious! I am a huge fan of carrot cake and carrot muffins so I decided to make them for breakfast one day. They were so quick and easy to make! During the process of making them I discovered that I only had one egg out of the necessary three and I also only had like 15 baby carrot sticks. The limited number of carrots still worked out great with the same wonderful texture and taste as any carrot cake product. Also in replace of the other two eggs I decided to use yogurt and also for the oil I did 2 parts applesauce one part oil. I don't know if it is simply the recipe or my additives, but the muffins were sooo deliciously moist and incredible! Really yummy!!!! 100% recommended.

Holy cow, these are good!!  When I made the batter it seemed like there was too much carrot, and not enough flour, but was I wrong.  These turned out light, fluffy, and really tastey.  I did change a few things.  I put in half the sugar, and cut down on the oil.  They turned out excellent.

Terrific recipe - thank you! I made a few changes based on other reviews and my own personal tastes: I used only 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, with the rest being whole wheat flour, I used 2 tsp cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp allspice (you gotta have allspice when it comes to carrot muffins!) and 2 tbsp of wheat germ to give them some protein power pack (I'm vegetarian, I worry about protein). I replaced the oil with applesauce, used only 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 eggs and added a splash of skim milk and a generous 1/4 cup of raisins at the end.  I skipped the icing entirely and these were still yummy yummy. Sometimes when you 'healthy-ify' a muffin recipe it ends up being too dense but these turned out perfect - I wouldn't change a thing at this point. Well... I might add the icing if it's a special occasion :)  Thank you for the great recipe!!

Although the muffins seemed to have a little too much oil, this recipe's a keeper. I made a few with mini chocolate chips. I also added a bit more cinnamon. Next time, I'll add raisins... maybe some pineapple. These kick butt!! Frosting is good too!

This was a fantastic carrot muffin recipe. Believe it or not: I've been looking for a tasty, moist carrot muffin recipe for the LONGEST time. Every recipe I found, the muffins were dry and tasteless. But this tastes very similar to the muffins I buy from coffee shops. But I did make a few alterations. I used 2 eggs instead of 3, I used 1/2 cup of oil instead of 3/4, and I only used 1 tsp of baking soda instead of 1 1/2. My husband also loved this recipe, and I'm definitely going to make these muffins again.

These came out really good. I followed the recipe as is, and I will make it the same exact way next time. My family loved them. I'd say they are more of a dessert than breakfast though. Nothing's wrong with that:)

I just made these!  What a mess!  I'm not sure what happened - I have a huge mess in my oven.  I also had just a sloppy, gooey,caved in mess. What did I do wrong?  I followed the recipe exactly.  I am at high altitude, 8500ft.

I made these for my son's birthday. I used less oil as suggested in several reviews. I had to laugh at the description of less than pretty. These were a sloppy mess. I tried using the extra in small loaf pans. These caved in in the center just like the muffins. My neighborhood birds had a feast.

I made them as the recipe explained, but in retrospect would definitely use less oil than 3/4 cup.  I also added 1/2 cup walnuts.  They are very good!

This was great! Added some extra cinnimon and substituted 1/2 the flour with baby rice cereal for added nutrician.  My 4 yr old son devoured them!  Didn't even need to ice them!

I wanted to rate this recipe higher but unfortunately it has major flaws.  I have made it twice, hoping that I had made a mistake the first time but got the same results the 2nd time as well.  First of all: too oily (I even used only 3/4c oil). Second problem: bland (I even used extra cinnamon plus 1/2 tsp nutmeg). Third problem: way too much baking soda/powder that left a strong metallic flavor on my mouth.   I made these with the intention of not frosting them as I wanted to make them more like muffins than cupcakes.  I think some of the flaws of the recipe are masked when you eat the muffins with the frosting but when you eat the muffin on its own, it just doesn't taste right.  In fact, it is disappointing.

I followed your recipe to the letter and the muffins turned out a deflated, and a weird colour... they tasted awful, I didnt bother wasting the frosting by putting it on the muffins because no one in my family was going to eat them anyway. Sorry..

Yuck! I have made other vegetable muffins/quick breads before, and they have all tasted better than this recipe. I followed the recipe to a "T" and I would not be able to eat the muffin "as is" without putting the frosting on it. The frosting is this recipe's only saving grace. They were very oily and tasted oily as well. Sorry for the glum review, but I guess my taste buds are different than others.

I guess I must have done something incorrectly because my carrot muffins turned out awful. I must admit I was suspicious when I saw the oil amount vs the flour amount. Maybe mine did not turn out good due to that I grated my carrots fine and got too much. I also got way more batter than for 12 muffins and I filled them all the way up. Maybe I will try it again but I am doubtful I will. :( I had looked forward to carrot muffins.

I followed the directions exactly and they ended up super oily and the taste was overwhelmed by the taste of vegetable oil.  Maybe I'll try again later using applesauce instead of so much oil, like other people suggested.

These came out GREAT. Easy to make and taste great! The firt batch i made with applesauce instead of oil (since i didnt have enough oil) and they were delish! They also taste great without the icing. I made them with the icing the 2nd time around and it wasnt as "cream cheesy" as i was expecting, next time i might up the cream cheese measurement!!

Since I had a lot of carrots left over from Easter, I needed a quick recipe. This worked very well but instead of muffins I used it as a cake. It turned out lovely and moist. The cinnamon was a great complement for the carrot and seemed more spice cake than carrot which was perfect for me. 

The frosting is more of an icing which is fine with me. Maybe it needs more cream cheese. Next time I will try to make them as muffins and see what happens.

I followed the recipe.  Some reviews added raisins and walnuts and since we love both I added 1/3 cup hot water softened raisins and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts.  This recipe is a keeper.  In my family recipe book for sure!!!  I share with 22 family members and several friends whom I have served them too.  All love them with or without raisins or walnuts and some with frosting.  Thank you for such a nice easy recipe.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe for the first batch and they were wonderful! They don't even need the icing.  On the next batch, I added raisins and a small swirl of the icing - absolutely delicious!

So moist and tasty!!! I followed the recipe as is (only subbing whole wheat flour for white AP), and baked for 25 mins, and they came out perfect :) Not too sweet with just enough spice, and it didn't need the frosting.  Next time, I'll add nuts :)

One word: wow! So fluffy and tasty. I make mine with a bit more spice, and I substitute 1/3 cup of the flour with instant oats and finely grated unsweetened coconut flakes. I’m sure even without changing anything, this recipe rocks. Will definitely make again!

I substituted the white flour for sprouted whole wheat flour and used coconut sugar instead of white sugar.  I used maple syrup in the frosting and added vanilla.  My family loved them and gobbled them up.

These were sooo good! I used wholemeal flour and added chopped pecans and added a bit less that 3/4 cup oil because I couldn't bring myself to use so much oil. I was really freaked out I had stirred it too much even though it didn't  mention it would toughen if stirred too much but they came out great! Didn't need icing but when icing was added they were divine! Waiting to see how they taste tomorrow otherwise I would have given these 5 stars. I have a feeling they will still be great out of the fridge. Oh yes I only added 1/4 cup of sugar! Thats less  than half the sugar in the recipe!

Made this without icing as a muffin and it was really quite nice! I shredded my carrots and then put them through my food processor to get the pieces smaller (mostly for the sake of my 4yo), but it made for a nice even distribution of carrot. I also added a 1/4 tsp nutmeg and about  1/2 cup raisins (coated in the flour mix) since I'm used to raisins in my carrot cake. In the end the family loved them, even my picky kiddo!

Tops Market had carrots on sale BOGO 2lb bags. I decided to juice an entire bag, and with the carrot pulp I made these muffins. The cream cheese topping was amazing. I did, however, use 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg because I enjoy my spiced foods....you know...spiced. 'twas delicious and extremely simple.

Really good recipe! I did notice that it called for a lot of oil -  I changed it to only 2 tbs and it worked out wonderfully! Highly recommend for anyone who wants a quick and easy recipe.

Great recipe, the muffins turned out moist and fluffy, just like the title!  One detail that I changed was the amount of cinnamon.  I used one teaspoon only, but I think next time I would use the full 1 1/2 teaspoons as directed.  Even my very picky 13 yr old thought they were to die for!

These muffins taste great! I don't do the frosting as I prefer less fat and sugar. Watch out not to put too much baking soda/powder, make sure you don't overfill the spoons.

Excellent rerecipe light fluffy there about the best I have tried. I 5 x  the resipe so all our kids and grandkids kids could have some and they all say they are the best they have ever had. Only change I make was added 1/2 cups raisins per batch and I used duck eggs I don't think my additions improved the resipe  I just had to many duck eggs and like raisins.

Even with a mixture of whole wheat pastry flour and a little cake flour these came out light and delicious. I only had 2 eggs, lowered the sugar and oil amounts, forgot the vanilla, and left off the frosting and my 2 and 6 year old had two apiece! Yay for 'hidden' veggies!

I made this the first time, following the recipe exactly as written and they were fantastic...light, fluffy and moist!  The second time, I added two cups of carrots, one cup of crushed (drained) pineapple some chopped pecans and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking and they were even more fabulous.  Not sure why some gave negative ratings!  Just a reminder, old baking powder and baking soda can ruin a perfectly good recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly. Like other reviewers , I found they had a baking soda taste. I did thoroughly sift the dry ingredients so will reduce the baking soda next time as the muffins were great otherwise. Icing is unnecessary but nice if you want a sweeter muffin.

This is awesome.  Cut back the b soda to 1 tsp, add nutmeg and cloves, sub 1/2 c of applesauce for oil, but put in 1/4 c oil, add in 1/2 c trail mix, and sprinkle some on top.  Very similar to the West coast trail muffins at Thrifty Foods - made a doz muffins plus 3

I followed the recipe  except I decreased the amount of  sugar to 3/4 cup, added chopped walnuts and raisins.   These  came out really moist, had a really good rise  ( a lot of carrot cake/ muffin recipes have very little rise) and was not overly oily. Would  make these again!

First a confession. I can cook like nobody's business but baking?... Not so great. I did however attempt these muffins and they are wonderful! I had no applesauce to replace oil so I melted coconut oil and used that as a substitute. I also used whole wheat flour and added about 1/3 cup flaxseed meal. In addition, I threw in a 1/2 cup of raisins. I used brown sugar instead of white. Da-lish! Not sweet at all. Also, I substituted coconut oil for the butter in the cream cheese frosting. I think the frosting is not as rich as traditional cream cheese frosting. And I put my frosting in a separate container so we could frost our own muffin as desired, or not at all!

These turned out perfect . The only changes I made was to add 3/4 cups of raisins and to add a brown sugar crumb topping . It took 30 minutes at 350 in my oven . I will definitely make them again.

I didn't have the cream cheese, so I left off the frosting, and I added in some nutmeg. They're very tasty! Definitely will make again!

Look no further this is the best carrott muffin recipe. No need for the frosting, unless you want frosting then by all means go for it.

This recipe simply has too much oil and sugar. I cut both drastically, used some whole wheat flour instead of all white, added some flaxseed and other spices (nutmeg, cloves), and used more carrot than called for. I would have used applesauce in place of some of the oil, had I had it in the house. I also skipped the icing. All in all, the muffins turned out good with my changes, and I think this is a fine recipe as long as you modify to better  fit your tastes.

Added tablespoon orange zest & cup plumped raisins to batter & used 1/2 mashed banana 1/2 oil - very moist & tasty
Also used orange juice in place of vanilla & extra 1/4 cup cream cheese to make thicker & cheesier icing !!! YUMMMM ??

There is way too much baking soda in this recipe, especially considering that baking powder has baking soda in it too. My carrots turned green, and the muffin texture and taste were off.  I had to rework this recipe into something new to enjoy it (my second attempt was stellar), so I gave a star for inspiration and a star for the excellent frosting. \ I suggest reducing the baking soda AND baking powder to 1 tsp each.

Loved this recipe. I used 3/4 STICK (3/8 cup) softened butter instead of oil , thereby reducing the calories by a huge amount, and left out the salt since there was such a lot of baking soda and baking powder in the batter.  It made 25 mini muffins in paper muffin cups. Still took 20 minutes to bake. Turned out perfect. Moist, tasty and I ate 4 immediately!!!

oh my, these were good. W/o frosting they can be muffins, but they'd easily satisfy as cupcakes w/ frosting!
I added chop' pecans & raisins...left other ingredients as in recipe. Didn't get the metallic taste others mentioned. DELICIOUS!
In future I may try other pan sizes--loaf, 9x13, bunds cause the recipe/taste is that good.

Loved the recipe! I personally like my carrot muffins with some spice so I added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the batter and they turned out perfect! Also, when I tasted the icing it was a tad too sugary and sweet for me so I put in about 1/8-1/4 cup more cream cheese to the icing and it turned out great!

Fantastic recipe I'll be sure to use it again!

My boyfriend is a stickler for carrot muffins. They always have to be better than his mothers or they are no good. I made the mistake of making a "healthy" carrot muffin that tasted so terrible we took one bite and threw 24 muffins in the garbage. So now I really have to be on my a-game with these bad boys. Boyfriend approved muffins.

Made these for my husband's birthday. They turned out great, were delicious, and were very easy and not time consuming. Only glitch wa that when I reduced the servings something got lost in translation regarding the frosting, so I had to add a bit if almond milk.

This recipe is resilient!  I used carrot pulp (leftover from juicing) instead of shredded carrots, half all-purpose flour and half rye flour, I added 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup sunflower seeds, and I reduced the amount of powdered sugar in the frosting by 1/3.  I also added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cardamom.  They were amazing!

Delicious on their own and with icing! They were a little greasy, but I believe that could be easily fixed by substituting the oil for apple sauce.

Good muffins, but in the future, I will change the icing recipe. I found it to be too sweet with all the icing sugar and vanilla together. The cream cheese icing didn't taste that cheesy. I also added some nutmeg to the muffin mix and it added just a little extra kick to them.

Excellent muffins! I made this last night and followed the recipe. I made them again tonight with some changes.  I added a chopped apple, about 1/2 of chopped walnuts another I/2 tsp cinnamon (total 2 tsp) and a couple of sprinkles of all spice.  Very amazing! And instead of frosting on top, I injected about 4-5 cc (1 tsp) of the cream cheese frosting  directly into the center of the muffin. Very yummy!
Thank you for this recipe...it's a keeper!

Pretty good. Although I did a lot of substitution...mostly to make it less fattening. Subs 1/2 cup of oil with yogurt. Decrease sugar to 2/3 cups. Subs 1/3 cup of flour with whole wheat flour. Didn't do any frosting. Still taste pretty great with all theses healthy subs.

fluffy and light but I found they tasted too much of baking soda ( I didn't frost them so maybe that covers the strong baking soda taste).  If I make again I will definitely reduce the b. soda.

So, originally when I made this recipe I forgot the sugar...oops!  However, the texture came out wonderfully fluffy and it made a good sort of bread.  I made it again the correct way and didn't like the texture as much, though I still enjoyed the taste.  I replaced 2/3 of the oil with applesauce for a healthy snack for the kids.  They weren't nuts for it, but they did eat some...may add a little of the cream cheese icing to sweeten the deal!

Delicious recipe!  Like a lot of the other reviewers, I used 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 oil, & added chopped walnuts and raisins. Had a mild "metallic" taste also, must be from the baking soda.  I'll just omit this the next time I make them.  This is definitely a must keep recipe!

I just made these muffins (minus the icing) and they are delicious!! Light and fluffy and moist. The only adjustment that I made was dropping the oil (I used Canola) down to 1/2 cup. My 2.5 year old is eating one right now which means they're a hit! Am definitely printing and adding to my recipe book.

Wow!  These sure ARE fluffy.  I can't imagine frosting these, because a) they're quite sweet as-is, and b) they're quite soft and I think trying to ice them would tear the surface.  Anyway, very easy to make and a hit with the kids.  As a plus, I peeled too many carrots (only needed 3), so I served these with carrot sticks.  ;-)

The muffins were very delicious!  That said, I reduced the sugar from 1 cup to just 3/4 cup and next time will try 1/2 cup and still think they will be plenty sweet.  Also reduced the sugar in the icing by nearly 1/2 and was more than sweet enough. oh and think I had a bit over 2 cups of grated carrots, shredded what I had and think it came to more like 2 1/2 cups.  Otherwise followed recipe as stated.  Was skeptical when I saw the very thin/runny batter, but it baked very nicely and truly was 'fluffy' and light.  Will make again... loved by the kids and adults alike!

Yup, these are really good even without frosting.  The only thing I did different was I used Pure Coconut oil in place of vegetable oil, and I used half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar.
They are recipe box worthy.  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful! I had a couple carrots left over, and wasn't sure what to do with them. Most other recipes required pineapple or applesauce. This very simple and delicious recipe was just what I needed! I subbed out the oil, for melted margarine, and added a bit of nutmeg. Yummy!

Love it! Love it! Love it!. I used Wholemeal flour entirely, 3/4 cup light brown sugar because I try to consume less sugar because of my insulin resistance, and only 3/4 cup vegetable oil. It turns out a bit dry, just as I like maybe because of the flour but surprisingly fluffy!  And spray a bit of Pam on the bottom of your muffin tin, you won't have any problem taking the muffin out.   Definitely a KEEPER!

My boys gave this recipe 2 thumbs up and they are carrot muffin connoissuers.  I did follow the advice and used a combination of applesauce (200ml-slightly less than 3/4 cup) and 2 tbsp of canola oil.

Great recipe! Very very moist! I added a 1/2 cup of raisins in the batter too.  I didn't even frost these delicious morsels as they were already tasty without it.

These are really good, kid-friendly muffins. I made them without frosting. I replaced 1/2c. oil with apple sauce (and reduced sugar by about 1/5c.) and replaced 1/3c. regular flour with whole wheat flour. I'll be making them again!

great moist wonderful ....... ok so i omit the oil and add the same amount of applesauce (lower the fat right and add a very kid friendly twist) than i omit white sugar for equal amount of splenda (my moms is diebetic) i double the amount of cinnamon ..... i have never truly made the cream cheese frosting but one day plan too ..... i stumbled across this recipe one day with only the stuff to make the muffins on hand ..... another thing i have done is made a double batch and made mini muffins and loafs with brown sugar sprinkled on top mmmm mmmm mmm

I replaced 3/4 of the oil with apple sauce, and all the sugar with splenda to reduce the calories and oil content.  I also didn't make the frosting for the same reason.  But as a base carrot muffin recipe, I'm not sure this one can be beat!

I made a few changes as I am intolerant to wheat flour & try to keep things low in sugar for my 4 year old. I used 1 1/3 cups of brown rice flour, 1/2 cup of agave syrup instead of sugar & reduced the oil to 1/4 cup. No icing. They were delicious! My husband & son both loved them.

These were fantastic! I followed some of the alterations others had used...3/4 c of sugar instead of the suggested 1 cup, 2 1/2 c carrots, and 1 cup of applesauce in place of the oil. They turned out sweet and moist! I made 12 large muffins and 10 small muffins with the recipe above.

These are really yummy muffins!  I made a few changes, I only used 1/2 cup oil, I used brown sugar instead of granulated, I added 1/4 cup plumped raisins and I made a spread with 8 ounces cream cheese, a tsp vanilla, 2 TBSP milk and 2 cups powdered sugar because I wanted a less sugary cream cheese topping.  These taste just scrumptious.

These are good muffins. The carrot taste and colour is good. They have a nice softness, but they are way too oily. The muffin cups were soaked with oil and your fingers get greasy when you eat them. I will make them again, but substitute the oil for applesauce. The frosting was good too, although not necessary. They were good without frosting. I had to add a bit of milk to make it mix better (I can't remember if the recipe called for milk or not).

I have made this many times with a few changes and additions. I use carrot pulp left from my juicer.  Add 1/2 cup of raisons and walnuts.  I add 1/3 cup of chocolate chips to the last half of the batch. Don't need the frosting.  We love these for breakfast and then for dessert too!

Really yummy, moist and easy muffins to make.  I added a small bag (70g) of chopped walnuts which was fab. I also added some lemon juice to the icing to cut through some of the sweetness. Only problem was that I did find these muffins rather oily.  I'll definitely make them again - but try 2/3 cup of oil.

Yummy and moist.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour and apple sauce instead of oil.  They're a hit even without the frosting.

Not the prettiest muffin (and I followed the recipe exactly), so I would think twice before making these for a gathering, but they tasted great! Of course, the frosting might dress them up a bit. I didn't make it because I was just looking for a way to get more veggies into my kid's diet.

My children and I really enjoyed these muffins, even though I made them without the frosting.  I made them for a special treat, and they went over great.  Such an easy recipe to follow, and a great way to use up the huge bag of baby carrots.

Made these for an easter egg hunt party.  Nice flavor, but I agree with others that they were a bit oily.  I would cut the oil by 1/4 c next time or use apple sauce as suggested by another review.  overall a nice little snack for our little ones!

This recipe is delicious exactly as written. I finely grated the carrots. The only slight change I made was to skimp on the oil (I only had 2/3 cup left and didn't open another bottle). The muffins are delicious, moist and not too heavy. The frosting is a nice touch. I held some back, colored it orange and green and piped little carrots on top to "fancy' them up. I got 15 nice sized muffins. Thanks for a recipe I will definitely make again!

This was a great recipe.  I took some advice and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 whole wheat flour, and added 1/4 cup raisins.  Very good!

These muffins turned out wonderfully fluffy and the icing was fine even when I used reduced fat cream cheese.  Actually, they were so fluffy that I found them to be remarkably more like cupcakes than any muffins I've ever tasted... Semantics aside, they were delicious and fully deserving of five stars.

These are very good carrot muffins the first batch didn't even get icing put on and they were gone.  I have a juicer and I used the pulp from carrot, apple and pear juice instead of shredded carrots. These were so moist and amazing!

I'm not much of a baker, but you can't go wrong with this.  Everyone here loved it!  I used applesauce in lieu of the oil like others suggested! Thanks!!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out great! The only possible difference I could see was that I put my carrots in the Cuisinart, so they were rather finely chopped, and not "grated." This recipe as written did NOT make 12 cupcakes, however, unless perhaps they were supposed to be jumbo-sized?! I could have gotten at least 24 cupcakes, but didn't have enough frosting (I used my own vanilla frosting recipe)...so I made 12 cupcakes, and put the remainder of the batter into a loaf pan. It baked longer (about 30-35 min), but was delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

Heavenly! We did not make any substitutions, nor frost them as they were good just by themselves. There were no funky ingrediants, just normal household stuff.

I made these for my son's preschool as his Birthday treat.  They went over well and they satisfied the teacher's desire for "healthier cupcakes". I made twice the frosting and had a half cup left over.  I did frost them fairly heavy as they were for a Birthday treat.  My batter also made 16 muffins and they were overflowing the tins.  I would fill less next time and will likely get another.

These muffins were delicious!  The only alterations that I made were to use 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour and I didn't frost them. Thanks for sharing!

Everyone really liked these! I'm not a huge egg fan though and next time I might reduce the eggs to 2 eggs. 
I will probably increase the temperature to 375 next time because in my oven, it took about 25 minutes before they were done.
Good recipe! I love the icing on these.
