This has an OK taste, but it is not really a daiquiri.  You should replace the lemon lime soda with strawberry daiquiri mix and I would definitely add more fresh strawberries in the recipe.  The sugar is not necessary for a daiquiri and should be left out completely and the lemon juice should be replaced with orange juice.  You may also want a few more ice cubes to get a daiquiri like consistency.  Also, this does not make a very large serving, so you may want to double all ingredients.

i used this recipe as a "base" and adjusted it to fit our taste.  i replaced the lemon-lime soda with pear juice (that was the only thing i had in the pantry..i imagine any mild-tasting juice would taste good too) and replaced the lemon juice with freshly-squeezed orange juice.  with extra ice, my family said it was the best virgin strawberry daiquiri ever!

Delicious!  We used frozen strawberries, left out the sugar altogether and used a limited edition specialty 7-UP that had Pomegranate in it.  I'll make these again for sure.

YUM!  For a six-serving size, I used about 15 large frozen strawberries, the same sugar, ice, & lemon juice listed, and one, 12-ounce can of grapefruit soda/pop.  My hubby and son loved it!!!  It helps that I have a brand new mixer that makes very fine crushed ice!  Who needs alcohol in their drink?

Would get easily 5 stars but I made adjustments...  I'm preggers & this was EXACTLY what I was craving.  1/4 c. of sugar makes it way too sweet, so just use 1/8 c. sugar & add more if you need to.  5 strawberries makes it more fruity.  I went easy on the lemon juice too, more can be added at the end if needed.  YAY for a recipe that makes 1 drink!  I've been craving fruit so much and will probably go through my carton of strawberries just making these every night.  Big plans for adding other fruits to it too!

I used this recipe as a stating place, as I didn't have everything on the list. I used a fruit punch flavored soda, mixed frozen fruit (strawberries,peaches, and raspberries), lemon juice, and ice. No sugar. I didn't really measure it myself, but what I came up with was delicious.

I made this one night in hopes of having a cold, refreshing drink outside, but instead I got this. It had the consistency and sweetness of powdered kool-aid. There is way too much sugar and way too little ice. If I were you I would disregard this recipe immediately, unless of course, you like feeling light-headed from a sugar overdose. Never try this drink, it is like drinking syrup!

Not the best recipe ever, but still good. I used frozen strawberries, and only put in about 1 T. sugar. Not "strawberry-ee" enough...so be sure to add MANY more...maybe like 6 or 7? Not bad for a refreshing beverage, but just needs to be added to.

I made this exactly as written and I thought it was great!  Slightly tart but plenty sweet.  I love the bubbles on top.  I left my drink for 1 hour while I dipped in the pool and when I got out it still had bubbles!

I don't drink alcohol, and I've only had a virgin strawberry daiquiri once. With that said, I really liked this drink. I had a lot of strawberries to use and found this recipe. It's cool and refreshing. After making it according to the recipe and tasting it, I did throw in a few extra strawberries (mine were quite small) and 5 extra ice cubes to get a slushier consistency. *****The next time I made this, I used Splenda and Diet 7-Up. It's just as good!

Almost everyone who gave this recipe a good review changed stuff...so I don't think it should have been given such a good review. I had to add way more ice, at least 3 more strawberries, and more lemon. Partly I think that there was way too much sugar. But also, freeze this when you're done, no matter how cold your products are. If you freeze it partly for a couple hours then blend it, it is slushy. Also, I think lime would be a nice touch, and I will try that next time. This recipe was an okay template, but I definitely changed the proportions.

This was great! I made it with the Magic Bullet©. It came out really well and I have enjoyed it many times with friends. The amount of sugar was too much for some of my friends so I varied it and it was still great!

I made my first one according to the recipe and found it to be way too sweet for my tastes.  I used very sweet strawberries and found that it needed way more strawiberries for my taste, as well.  My second one I increased the strawberries to six and reduced the sugar to one tablespoon.  I used Sprite Zero for the soda.  Although my strawberries were very ripe, I did not get the nice red color like some of the photos depict.  The second one suited my tastes much better,and I would probably rate my second one a four.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Helena W.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I used a little extra lemon juice to add a little tang to it, but other than that it is perfect! Depending on your taste you may want to use a little less sugar. But this is my absolute favorite drink for summer time!

My Girl Scout troop made these for a Frozen Slumber Party and absolutely loved them!!  The only adjustment I made was using frozen strawberries because I freeze my own and keep them on had.

fantastic. I do it almost every week now I love it so much. It is simple ad great when added whipped cream and a cherry ;) other recipes had too much fake flavoring but this was perfect. I made it for a group of five and everyone enjoyed it (it helps to add Bacardi).
