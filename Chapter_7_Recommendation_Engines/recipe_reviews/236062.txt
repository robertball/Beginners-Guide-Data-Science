So easy and so delicious! I needed something to take to a Labor Day picnic and this fit the bill. I was worried about the dreaded "box cake mix" flavor coming through so I added a heaping Tbsp. of vanilla extract to the melted butter, egg, and yellow cake mix. To make things easy and to avoid anything sticking I used Reynolds Wrap heavy duty non-stick foil (great stuff). I did up the amount of lemon juice and zest just a bit because I wanted the lemon flavor to come through and it complimented the blueberries nicely. It baked up beautifully and once it was completely cooled I added a little lemon zest on top for a little contrast in color (plus it just looked pretty). Be sure to wipe your knife clean after each cut to avoid a mess. These were light, lemony and bursting with blueberries - you'd never know cake mix made this little dessert so yummy!

Love this recipe.   It is a hit whenever I make it.   Try it with a lemon cake mix if you want to up the lemon flavor.

This recipe was so easy I was able to write it down for a cousin of mine from heart.  Simple, easy, and  with the yellow cake mix for the crust it was such a delicious desert!  Even in how I made it I only put 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries and even with less blueberries it still had the right combination of lemon and blueberries.

Two years ago I tried this recipe and it has been a go to dessert ever since. I have requests to make it all the time, it is my son-in-laws all time favorite dessert as well as 2 of my friends. 
It is refreshing, with a sweet pop from the blueberry and a tart hint from the lemon. The taste and texture are both heavenly - even to my grandgirl who had texture issues with food. 
It is easy to make, makes a lot and is a lovely presentation. It does need to be cold for it to taste it's best. I'm making it now as it was requested I take it tomorrow to a 4th of July party.

These were very easy to make and so delicious! They were an instant hit at the BBQ I brought them to. Next time, I might double the lemon zest or use lemon cake mix instead of yellow cake mix because these were a bit too sweet for my liking. However, my boyfriend loved them as is and told me to give the recipe five stars.

These were great... the only addition I made was to sprinkle the top of the dessert with cinnamon and brown sugar before baking... just added a little touch.

I made this for a large baby shower, along with some other delicious desserts. The first tray was gone before all the people arrived! Everyone wanted the recipe. Very good. I did use lemon cake mix as some others suggested, and frozen blueberries as fresh are very expensive right now. Both worked great!

Fantastic recipe! I had so many blueberries from my kids picking them at summer camp, and I didn't quite know what to do with them all. This recipe is sooo good, and super easy. I used a lemon cake mix and left out the lemon zest and juice. Yumm-O

I made this for a cookie recipe contest at my church's annual picnic and I tied for first place. It is really amazing. No one would know there's boxed cake mix in it. Based on the previous comments, the only change I made was to use lemon cake mix and it was truly a perfect balance of flavor. Will definitely make again!

No changes..I don't believe in changing a recipe the first time I try it.  This was SUPER easy & SUPER tasty!  I haven't been baking in quite some time and I'm trying to expand my flavor profiles since I now live in the berry laden state of Washington.  This will definitely be on my short list of desserts.  No boxed cake mix flavor but if you want it more lemony--try a lemon cake mix.  I'm going to try one of those next time.

I did not care for this recipe, tastes too much like boxed cake mix.  None of my family liked it either.   Will not make again.

So easy and simple to make and test delicious. It was great even when I only had one package of cream cheese. Good stuff!

This was a nice combination of sweet cakey crust and sour blueberry/lemon cream cheese. My boyfriend likes sweets, otherwise for my tastes it is too sweet. Next time I make this (and I will) I will cover for the first 30 minutes, as the crumbles started too brown too much, and refrigerate the leftover cake batter crust while making the cheese filling so that it crumbles easier. This is a great dessert!

The dough stuck to the aluminum foil. I was  able to get about 20 bars out of it and delivered that. If you're going to make these, just grease the bottom of a pan and pat the batter into the pan.  It will give more substance to the crust and the bars will hold together better, and it will have a richer flavor. Overall, the flavor was just okay.

Easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it worked out wonderfully. I will definitely make these again.
