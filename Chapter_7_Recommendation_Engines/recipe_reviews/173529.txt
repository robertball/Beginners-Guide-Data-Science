i made this recipe for my family yesterday, and it is one of the best things i ever tasted. i used scallops instead of shrimp because my mom doesn't eat shrimp and it worked very well. the parmesan was a really nice touch, it added a little tang. the recipes also really packs a mouthful of flavor, which makes it go really well with white rice.

This an excellent recipe the taste is great. I only wish there was a tiny bit more of a crust on the shrimp. Next time I will dip them in a bit of egg before shaking. I added the Parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture which helped.

These shrimp were really good and very easy to make.  I used 8-12 count shrimp and they were excellent paired with a steak for surf and turf.  Thanks so much for  posting the recipe.

I used 3 tsp total of the salt and dipped in beaten eggs before shaking in flour mixture. Turned out awesome! Kids said it was like a dish from a restaurant, "How did you do that?!"

An excellent recipe, but I agree with the reviewer who said there was way too much salt. I just gave a few healthy twists of rock salt into the bag - nothing near the three tablespoons suggested in the recipe. Otherwise, I kept the recipe the same. My husband said this was some of the best shrimp he had ever tasted. Next time I might add some dried parsley.

Pretty sure I followed the recipe exactly, I even put less salt than listed in the recipe, but the prawns came out way too salty, I either stuffed up big or the tablespoons are meant to be teaspoons?
