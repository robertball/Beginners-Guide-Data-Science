I've never made eggnog, but I've done custards before so I felt comfortable tempering the eggs. I made a half-batch but otherwise followed the recipe. And... it's delicious but super thick. It's barely even a drink, it's easier to eat with a spoon than sip! I spooned it into smoothie containers to bring to the party. But it is perfectly spiced for that gingerbread taste and with just the right alcoholic bite
