Like the other review this was now very sweet. I added 2 cups of powder sugar and it was still not sweet. If I make them again I will add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and cream together with the butter and still add 2 cups total of the powdered sugar and increase the water to 5 tablespoons to balance it out. I would want to keep the light crisp texture that Milano cookies are known for; the powdered sugar gives these cookies that texture.

I just made this recipe with the changes suggested by rebeccasatc.  And now that I've just tasted one, I definitely think that they're nice and light, and the changes rebeccasatc suggested were spot on.  I would, however, cut the almond extract in half the next time I make them.  Whatever brand I used may have a stronger flavor than others, but I found the almond flavor a little too overpowering in each bite.  Otherwise, great tasting with the changes!

The powdered sugar didn't give near the amount of sweetness that I would have hoped (even the chocolate chips didn't give it enough sweetness).  Don't be deceived by their pale appearance, mine were done in an easy 8 minutes.  Dare I say it?  They were bland.

A lot of the reviews say these are bland, but I think they're perfect. Milano cookies aren't overly sweet, they have a light texture with a bit of sweetness. For me, these are bang on.

These were extremely dry and bland.
