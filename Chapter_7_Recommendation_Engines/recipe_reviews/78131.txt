I was looking forward to this recipe because I love peanut sauces and fresh green beans but my family wasn't as excited.  Once they got a couple of bites, they were sold and kept asking for more.  I thought the chile paste might have been too strong for the kids but nobody minded and I thought it was just perfect for me.  I even liked the way the rice was cooked on this recipe versus the way I would normally cook it.  Next time, I'll probably make twice the rice and twice the sauce.  Fantastic recipe!

This was fabulous and I will definitely be adding it to the rotation.  I was a little leery about the peanut butter but it didn't taste like peanut butter at all.  Just a really flavorful peanut sauce.  I had some thin-cut pork chops on hand which I sliced into thin strips which worked great for this, instead of chicken.  Also when I got home, the dogs had gotten into the cabinet and eaten the honey so I just added some sugar instead.  I doubled the sauce (and I'm glad I did) because I'm always scared there won't be enough sauce.  Oh, and I added some chopped fresh cilantro as a garnish which really added to it, making a nice fresh flavor.  I'm trying to get my burgers-n-fries boyfriend to branch out and accept ethnic food, and he loved this!  Awesome recipe!!!

Yum!  We really like this dish.  The recipe calls for low-sodium chicken broth and soy sauce and this is important or it turn out too salty.

Absolutely fabulous!  I loved this dish and so did my family.  I think there is an error in the recipe when is states to "mix in the greens beans and rice" I think it is supposed to be "mix in the grean beans and Chicken" and then serve over rice.  I skipped that part all together anyway.  I placed the green beans and chicken on top of the rice and the poured the sauce over it.  Superb! Thanks for sharing Erin!

If you like peanut butter, you WILL like this dinner...I didn't find the peanut butter overwhelming at all!  I had chicken cooked in the freezer, so it was REALLY quick and easy to make also...I added some cumin, curry and garlic cause most thai meals have those spices and it added just the "kick" it needed.  My friend took some home to her husband and he loved it too!  Great recipe!

I've tried a fair few stir fry recipes from this website, and this one had been by far the best.  I added chopped water chestnuts, red peppers, and low fat chunky PB to make it a bit healthier.  This was great- thanks for the recipe!

This is very americanized, in spite of doubling the lemon and chile sauce it was very bland.  The chicken needs to be sauteed with garlic/onions or something to give it some flavor.  This tasted like chicken and beans smothered in peanut butter. . .yuk

Quick, easy, and very good.  I used lime juice instead of lemon and hot sauce instead of the chile paste because that is all I had on hand.  Still turned out great.  I'll be making this again.

Very easy and yummy.  I've tried peanut chicken recipes before and my husband hasn't liked them, but he thought this was great!  I used stir fry vegetables instead of the green beans...was very good.

This was really good, my husband isn't a big chicken or rice fan so I'm always trying to find new ways to make these ingredients as I love both of them. The husband gave his seal of approval and said I could make this again. I loved the peanut flavor in the sauce. I might omit the green beans next time, or put them on the side.

This recipe was fabulous! Everybody loved. The peanut flavor is not overpowering so it is a nice flavorful dish. I added some sliced carrots and onion to the chicken while I was Sautéing it, I also added a little more soy sauce. Very appealing easy presentation.

Wow.  What a delicious dish!  I just finished eating it, and am really happy that I decided to make it.

I had some reservations, despite the stellar reviews.  I thought it would be another disgusting version of an Asian dish, with a strong peanutbutter taste.  But I couldn't have been more wrong!  You can't even tell there's peanutbutter, and the lemon juice gives it that extra something.

Very delicious, and healthy, and easy to make to boot.  Thanks for sharing!

By the way, there is a mistake in the recipe.  After making the sauce, I dumped it into the saucepan with the chicken and cooked it a bit more, then added the green beans.

This was a crowd pleaser!  I added other veggies (carrots, green pepper and a little onion) just to make it a "one pot" meal.  I also tried to short-cut by cooking the veggies and meat together...wasn't the greatest idea b/c the veggies were a little overcooked.  But the great taste of the sauce saved the day.  I love Thai food and this was excellent.  I will serve again...but will cook the veggies separately!!

This was really good. I did cook the chicken with onion, garlic and red chili flakes. I also under measured the peanut butter in fear of it tasting too peanut buttery. The changes I will make next time I cook this are: double the sauce, keep the peanut butter the same and definitely take it up a notch on the chile paste and red pepper flakes. It was yummy.

I was worried as I put this together because the ingredients seem like an odd combination.  When it all came together, it was a wonderful meal!  I topped it with cold cilantro, bean sprouts and peanuts.  The flavor/texture turned out great!

Excellent--and really pretty too. I added sliced red and green bell-pepper, and carrots made into long curly papery strips (via a potato peeler:))I also reduced the peanut butter a tad, and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the sauce, and cause nothing beats red chile sauce, tripled the amount. Loved it. Thanks!

Very good! We used about 1.6 pounds of chicken and at least a pound of green beans. Sooo good over rice, and served with na'an bread.

Amazing. Super flavorful. As somebody else reviewed, I added a few dashes of cumin, and curry (to the chicken) while cooking. I didn't have green beans, so I sauteed zucchini, red/green bell peppers and the green onions. The different combo of veggies likely contributed to the great flavor. I'll probably do it again this way, rather than using green beans. My husband and I both loved the flavors, and he said, "gotta make sure you keep that recipe!" I toasted some chopped peanuts on the stovetop before sprinkling them on top of the finished dish. Delish!

As written the recipe is just okay.  The lemon juice was a little overpowering for me and it seemed to have been fighting with the peanut butter taste instead of going well together. It also tasted as if it were definitely missing something. I don't know if I would make this one again.

I stumbled upon this recipe and knew I had to make it.  I had all the ingredients in my house AND my name is Erin!  I admit I used canned green beans instead of fresh (I've also used frozen) and since I can never find chili paste in our grocery stores I just dump in some cayenne pepper and some hot sauce.  I also suggest saving yourself a step and using chunky peanut butter instead of smooth and then you don't have to add the nuts at the end.  My husband and I both love this recipe and I love that it's so simple to make with ingredients I almost always have on hand.

Thanks for the recipe.  My boyfriend is half Indonesian and he grew up eating Indonesian recipes so of course I wanted to make sure I did his culture proud.  He said this dish was just like one his mom used to make.  I think this recipe can be simplified without affecting the taste.  I skipped the step of steaming the green beans.  Instead, once I had the sauce going, I threw the green beans in and they seemed to cook enough on their own.  After the green beans were in there for a couple of minutes, I put the chicken back in and mixed it all up to finish cooking. I make my own version of rice. Finished off by garnishing with chopped green onions.  This was great. I'll keep my eye out for more Indonesian recipes now that I know I can competently make them.

This was absolutely delicious!  I did not have any chili paste, but I substituted with 1 tsp chili powder.  I had also used canned green beans and added them at the end, as the sauce was thickening.  The whole meal was prepared in the one saute pan, instead of cooking the sauce separately.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was really, really good!  I did change the recipe slightly... I know, it probably isn't right to give this recipe 5 stars if I changed it, but it was really good.  I didn't have any chile paste, so I used tabasco sauce instead.  The ingredients are fairly similar.  I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I soaked the chicken (just to coat) in additional low sodium soy sauce before cooking (about 10 min.) and stir-fried it with 4 cloves of minced garlic and crushed red pepper to taste.  I love garlic!  I also used crunchy peanut butter and omitted the extra peanuts.  I was afraid of adding too many peanuts (I've done that to Kung Pao Chicken before and it doesn't taste good!).  The amount of "peanutty" taste was perfect.  The only thing that I would do different next time I make this recipe is steam the green beans for about 7-8 minutes instead of 10.  I overcooked them slightly... it was my fault because I should've been watching them as cooking times vary.  Other than that, everything was delicious.  Thanks for sharing, Erin.  This recipe is a keeper.

I used this mostly as a guideline since I'm not too keen on using measurements  for cooking.  I had about 3/4 pound of chicken and almost 3/4 pound of green beans, and I felt the sauce was sufficient.  This tastes great and I didn't think it was too peanutty, although I did use natural peanut butter.  I also sauteed the chicken with some garlic.  YUMMY!  Tastes like what I'd find at a Thai restaurant.

This is a keeper! Made as stated, but next time will increase the chile to 2-3 t. for more kick. Used all natural peanut butter (no additives, sweetners, or preservatives), so maybe that makes a difference in not tasting too peanut butter-y....Also toasted my peanuts-yum!

Absolutely loved this recipe!  This is by far the best peanut sauce recipe I've ever found.  I followed the directions exactly except I served it over brown rice.  The only  thing I might do differently next time would be to add more veggies, perhaps sliced red pepper, snow peas, and maybe baby corns?  This is a true winner and is definitely one of my top Allrecipes favorites!

I was looking for a recipe that would be similar to Lean Cuisine's "Chicken in Peanut Sauce" that my daughter is crazy about...this recipe was very close (even better, we thought)!  I substitued 4 oz of whole wheat angel hair pasta for the rice, and steamed the green beans in the microwave...other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I absolutely loved this meal. My husband loves it too.  I've substituted tofu for the chicken sometimes (when we're really feeling cheap) and it still is wonderful.  I have also added more veggies.  Yummy!

As written, it is OK, but it needed a little something extra. I took the advice of another reviewer and added some curry powder, garlic, and cumin and that made it a five star recipe.

I really liked the flavors of this meal.  I used fresh green beans from my fathers garden. I found the recipe to be very easy to make.  The only thing I might do differnt, would be to double the sauce, and keep a little in a separate container. I had some of the dinner left over, and found that it was not as saucy as the day I made the meal. So, I think the extra sauce poured over any left overs would be best.   Thanks Erin for a good and different meal!

loved this sauce!  i actually changed most of the other details (used garbanzo beans and black beans instead of chicken, broccoli instead of green beans) but that's just because that's what i had.  i also added fresh garlic and it was great.  definitely a versatile sauce that i'll be using over and over!

I love this recipe.  It is so easy to make, and very satisfying.  I like my food really spicy, so I added extra sirachi, and some garlic.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It was great! Easy to make, tasted great, and used ingredients that I always have on hand. I did make two changes - or rather additions. I added two minced garlic cloves and 1 tsp minced ginger. To me, it's just not an asian dish without garlic and ginger. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Brilliant recipe! Easy, delicious, made with inexpensive ingredients (which you already probably have at home). I substituted the honey for Agave nectar and I used unsweetened natural peanut butter. Turned out great – will definitely be making this again!!!!

My husband and I really liked this, the kids were a little put off by the appearance but picked out the chicken, ate the Quinoa (I served it over quinoa instead of rice) and "tried" the greenbeans.  So for family friendliness and flavor I gave it a 4.  I will make this again and maybe eventually it will be their favorite food :)

Not sure if it was something I did, but the sauce was way too thick.  Although it tasted okay, the texture was almost like eating chicken dipped in peanut butter.  If I make it again, I would add more water, or heat the sauce for a much shorter period of time.

Very good recipe! I made some changes based on other reviews: added an onion and 2 cloves of garlic, made it with asparagus instead of beans, added some cumin and curry powder. I also simplified cooking and made chicken, asparagus and sauce in one step: browned the chicken, added onion and garlic, then asparagus, sauteed all for 10-15 min,  added mixed ingredients for the sauce over it.

Everyone liked this (including my two year old) but I will say that I thought the recipe was a bit too thick...especially when reheated.  But overall I liked the flavor and will probably make this again.

Yum!  Doubled the sauce, used 1/2 chunky and 1/2 smooth peanut butter, omitted peanuts.  Otherwise made it as written.  Excellent flavor, just the right kick.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is good!  I did a few things different though and added julliened carrots and a garlic clove and crunchy peanuts butter instead of smooth.  After cooking the green beans in the microwave till almost done, I sauted the carrots, green beans and garlic in a little oil.  Removed them and cooked the chicken pieces till done and then added the vegetables back in.  After cooking the sauce, I added it to the meat/vegetable mixture and thickend it with a little cornstarch.  I served it over cooked rice.  This is excellent!

This recipe was really good. I have a small kitchen so I didn't use as many different pans as the recipe stated. I first cooked the chicken, and removed it from the pan. I added the sauce ingredients to the pan to cook, then added the beans and I added some water chestnuts (yum!). I put the chicken back in at the end to re-heat, and absorb some flavour.

This dish was really excellent and very easy to make. I used chunky peanut butter (because that's what I like) and didn't put the extra peanuts on top. I didn't have chile paste but used hot sauce and it was good... I'd like to have more zing though so I'll go out and buy some paste. It was done quickly and I cut the recipe in half for just 2 people and it was perfect. I will definitely be making this again!

I am not a fan of peanut sauces.  This did not taste too peanutty at all.  I doubled the sauce, which I'm really glad I did because there would not have been enough.  I could not find chile paste at the store, so I just added chili powder.  I added twice as much honey as called for to make a little sweeter.  This was wonderful, everyone enjoyed.

Very simple, time-efficient, and healthy recipe to make.  The gravy is excellent.  However, next time I will have to season/marinate the chicken - it was way too bland for our taste.  I forgot the honey, used chili sauce instead of chili paste, used regular (sodium) broth and soy sauce, and low-fat peanut butter.  The sauce still tasted great.  I also sauteed the green beans a bit after steaming.  The peaunts/green onions added extra flavor, color, and crunch.

Great dinner tonight!  I made the rice in a steamer, rather than the stovetop.  I browned the chicken, and added onion slices during the browning.  I doubled the sauce since I had a 1.25 lbs. of chicken, and it was the right amount of sauce.  Not having red chili paste, I used Sriracha Sauce in its place and it worked great. I added the optional crushed peanuts to mine, but skipped them on my husbands.  He said twice during the meal, "This is a really good supper."  I will be making this again and recommending it to my SIL.  Thanks, ERINPETERSON, for sharing your favorite meal.  It was very well received in our house.

Absolutely delicious! No lemon so, I added lime instead. I used lettuce wraps to make it a little bit healthier... Sauce thicken enough so, my wraps wouldn't fall apart. If u love peanut butter this is the recipe for u!

Found this during an ingredient search where I was trying to figure out what to make for dinner if you have rice, chicken and green beans.  So I did end up with some substitutions, since I didn't have all the ingredients.  

I used a combination of boneless chicken thighs and breasts.  I used rice vinegar, not lemon juice and brown sugar, not honey.  I also doubled the chili paste, 'cause I like chili paste, put some garlic powder, salt and pepper on the chicken while it cooked, since that seemed like a good idea and put in some frozen peas and cooked them in the sauce at the very end, since I didn't have enough beans.

It was delicious!  I'll make it again.

Very good and reasonably easy! I followed the recipe to the letter for a delicious meal in. :) The only thing my boyfriend and I will do differently next time is double the chili paste - not sure if it's the kind we got, but it just wasn't spicy enough for us!

This was wonderful, and something different for us. I skipped the green beans (didn't have any) and added half a sauteed onion and red pepper to the sauces. I also didn't have the chile paste so substituted a bit of hot sauce instead. My husband doesn't even like peanut butter but said this was the best chicken dish I have made so far. I will make this regularly. Thank you!

We loved this dish. I added a little extra honey and some red pepper flakes to the sauce. I also added some broccoli and onions in with the beans and stir-fried them instead of steaming them. The dish does have a very strong peanut butter flavour, but to us it was very tasty.

So GOOD!!! Only things I did different was added red pepper flakes, and sub. lime juice for lemon. I live in Costa Rica and it is hard to find lemons or their juice. Made for guests and they loved it. Won't be the last time I make this!

I used a bottled peanut sauce because it was in the pantry. That said it's hard to give this a completely fair review. It was good enough that I'll try it from scratch on another occasion.

I am drawn to flavors from the East and I love peanuts and peanut sauces...so I naturally wanted to try this.  My family and I were not disappointed.  It is VERY good. I didn't change anything, but doubled the recipe for my hearty eaters. This will make it into my regular rotation. It's quick enough for a work night and delicious enough for anytime.

When I made it, I thought "not so good". Then had it for leftovers the next day and thought "fabulous!". Marinating made a huge difference. Next time I will prepare it the day before and add the green beans on the day of serving.

I expected more. Maybe it's because I used leftover rotisserie chicken or I cooked the sauce a little too long but the peanut butter taste was overpowering (and I love peanut butter and satays and such) and left my mouth really dry.

I can't believe this got good ratings. The sauce is so watery that you can barely taste it, and I followed the recipe exactly. It would have been good if the chicken, green beans, and sauce were all cooked together and if the sauce was actually thick enough to stick to the food.

I love peanut-flavored dishes, but never knew how to make them until now.  Easy.  My grocery store didn't carry chili paste, so I tried chili sauce, but then after tasting the sauce, wanted it spicer with more "zing" so I used lots of hot sauce and doubled the lemon juice.  I would suggest you follow the recipe; taste it; and then add whatever you think it needs (you may be happy without changing a thing!)

I modified the recipe as follows: instead of chicken chunks - butterflied chicken breasts completely in half. In the same skillet sauteed half of a sliced sweet onion, gave sweetness to counter pb, think pb&j (omitted green onion). Used angel hair pasta instead of rice. I also used asian sweet chili sauce instead of the paste. To serve, layer on each plate: pasta, green beans, chicken breast, onion, then drizzle with good amount sauce. Lovely presentation and wonderful mix of flavors!

I loved this recipe!!  I got some fresh green beans through my CSA, and wasn't sure what to do with them, since I have disliked green beans all my life.  I found this recipe and figured with the sauce and the chicken, they would be tolerable....Well, I ended up having seconds!!  It was delicious.  After simmering the sauce, I added it to the skillet with the chicken and beans...then I sliced the green onion and stirred it in.  Served over brown rice.  AWESOME!!

While I was cooking this dish, I taste tested the sauce and thought it tasted terrible. But when the sauce boiled and thickened and combined with the chicken, it was wonderful. Such an original flavor and a different way to prepare the same old chicken breast. I only had canned green beans so I served them on the side. I also browned the chicken in a little sesame oil for more nutty flavor. Too spicy for my toddlers, perfect amount of spice for adults. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good!  I made this for the first time for some friends, and everyone loved it.  I doubled the sauce ingredients, and I used chunky natural peanut butter, but otherwise did everything as the recipe stated. Next time I will probably add more chili paste because I like it spicy (but our guests said that they liked the spice level and would not have wanted more chilis, they are closer to average when it comes to spice).  The sauce is great and you could easily make this recipe flexible by using other veggies to change it up from time to time -- i will try broccoli and peppers in the future.  I agree with another reviewer that you could also replace the rice with noodles for a different twist!  I think this will go into my "regulars" list!

Fantastic mix of flavors! I used red curry paste instead of red chile paste. Double the sauce recipe and the chile part for more oomph! I added onions and broccoli as well.

So, so good, but bland made as is.  I made jasmime rice instead of plain white, using one tsp of canola, heat rice till coated and smells like popcorn, then add water, heat to boil, then turn to low, cover and cook 20mins (perfect rice every time!).  I added thin sliced carrots with the beans, 1/2 tsp dark sesame oil, 1 tbsp white wine and 1tbsp fine grated fresh ginger (1/2 tsp dry) to the sauce mix, it was fantastic and smelled wonderful!

I was somewhat doubtful about the peanut butter in this recipe, but wow! it was just the right amount of peanutty flavor.  I only made a couple small changes.  I used lime instead of lemon and added half of it right before serving, and I didn't have any chile paste, so I used a combination of red chile flakes, cayenne, and tabasco.  The sauce thickened really nicely but took more than 5 minutes.  Yummy, I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.  A definate keeper.

This is going into our regular rotation! Good food and very easy to make. I made a few changes: I used broccoli instead of beans (to soak up the sauce), and also used regular chicken broth and soy sauce as I did not have low-sodium versions on hand-- it still wasn't salty at all! I nearly doubled the chili paste and still couldn't really detect any heat... next time I will use quite a bit more and will also use some broth to cook the chicken as opposed to the oil. As a last step I added the broccoli and sauce to the chicken and cooked for just a moment, which brought everything together very well. I had a little peanut sauce left over - it will be great for a snack with some shrimp chips! Thanks for a great recipe!

Nobody in my family liked this recipe  not even my peanut butter loving daughter.  Plus not enough sauce. My suggestion would be to double the sauce if you are a peanut butter lover.

Not bad, but created a lot of dishes for what turned out to be an average recipe. If I make this again, I will experiment more with the sauce. The peanut butter is indeed somewhat dominant, so try increasing the soy and chile paste, as well as the green onion garnish.

LOVED IT!!  It was fantastic.  I make Thai chicken all the time, but always have to use a spice packet or a jar of peanut sauce...no more!  This is the best homemade peanut sauce.  Good and spicy too!  Thanks Erin

This tasted very much like peanut butter to me and that's the only thing I didn't like.  This is just a personal preference and not a judgment on the recipe.

This dish was good, except it needed a little something sweet, maybe brown sugar or more honey.  The low-sodium was not necessary...I found myself adding more soy sauce to my individual plate.  My hubby doesn't care for peanutty meat dishes (I temporarily forgot until he sneered at the ingredient list I relayed over the phone), but he said it wasn't as "bad" as he expected.  I think this would be awesome if it were a little sweeter and saltier, then chopped finely, put into an egg roll wrapper, fried, and served with sweet and sour sauce. I probably won't try it again on my husband, but will pass it on to neighbors.

This was great!  It was quick and easy to make even though I had every stove eye on at one point.  I used crunchy peanut butter and I liked having some peanuts mixed in with the sauce.  The sauce also had a nice spice to it.

This was fantastic and easy to make. It also looked beautiful on the plate. It was so different from anything I've ever made.   Thanks so much.

Edit: I make this all the time as a stir fry. I just add whatever veggies I have then add the sauce for the last few minutes. Yummy with sprouts, and water chestnuts added. 

This is one of my go to recipes.

Really good recipe, I did not have it over rice though and used tofu and chicken in the sauce.  I did not use the chile paste and liked how it came out, although it may be too sweet for some people.  I also used half a lemon while cooking the sauce and then topped the fnished dish with the rest of the lemon.  I will make this again and maybe try it with lime instead.  Also, I used chunky p.b and it was good with that too.

Great dish! I didn't cook the rice-- just the green beans and chicken. Peanut sauce was delicious. I've made peanut sauce before, but this is the best I've made. Quick, easy and tasty dinner. I omitted the green onion and chopped peaunuts-- came out great! Will definitely make again.

I am giving this a 2 because my hubby was actually able to eat it, even though he requested I axe it for the future. I was not able to eat it. Maybe I am just not used to this type of food. The warm peanut butter was not a taste that I liked. I did not like the smell while it was cooking. Adding the chile sauce just made it worse. It was just a very strong sauce that overwhelmed the chicken and green beans. This is one recipe that I will not be repeating.

Absolutely incredible!  The peanut butter was too strong for me so I added about 3/4 cups of chicken broth and let it simmer down.  I also added 1/2 cup of lemon juice because I have really juicy lemons growing right now.  But it was so light and delicious and hubby thought so too.

The flavor was there but although I used smooth PB, the sauce was gritty.

Easy and absolutely delicious!   I didn't use the peanuts because I'm not a lover of peanuts on top of hot food, but love the peanut buttery taste of the dish.

Quadrupled the sauce because my family is saucy. Also, didn’t have enough honey, so used sugar cubes and added more lemon juice to taste. Loved it.

I made the sauce per the recipe (though I did double it so we'd have plenty), but used it to baste some lovely chicken leg quarters rather than sautéing in it. I baked the chicken with a little olive oil and salt and pepper for 30 minutes at 325, then began basting it every 5-10 minutes for another 15 minutes. 
 For the last bit, I turned the oven up to 425 and added heavier coatings of the sauce, and then set it under broil for the final 2-3 minutes.
Served with Jasmine rice and steamed fresh green beans, with extra sauce. Delish!

I'm sorry but this chicken is just blah.  It's lacking so much I'm not even sure where to start.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was featured in All Recipes Magazine, but yuck.  Too much peanut butter, too thick, not enough pizzazz, no spice, no heat.  Yes, I could have tweaked it myself but that's not the point of one of these highly-rated recipes.  You're supposed to be able to make it as it stands and it should be fantastic.  We ate it since I hate to waste food but I crumpled up the recipe I had ripped out of the magazine and threw it away afterwards.  Sorry :(

I was very good. The only change I made was to add more chili paste (I always  use the Korean type) and double up on the soy sauce. I also doubled the recipe and it served 5 with very little left over.

Just OK.  Seems like it's missing something.  Use sriracha sauce instead of chile paste, but don't  think that was it. Not worth making again.

For the newbie chefs:  this one is easy to make but be sure to prep your ingredients (particularly the green beans and the chicken) ahead of time so you're not scrambling trying to get everything together.  As for the flavor: my husband loved it and my toddler ate it up, so I definitely appreciate the recipe for that.  I felt like it was a bit too much peanut butter and not enough other flavors, though. Next time I plan on increasing the sriracha, soy sauce, and lemon juice to try to kick up the boldness a bit.  This is one that I'll probably continue to keep tweaking as time goes on to get it just right for our own tastes.

This is wonderful. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. While the peanut flavor is strong, somehow it's not overpowering. The only two things I did a teeny bit different was to add salt to the cooking water for the rice and I stir-fried the blanched green beans in the pan I cooked the chicken in for a little extra flavor. Adding the chicken on top, then the garnishes, makes for a nice presentation.

This was great. I was concerned that the peanut butter would be overpowering (the smell was really strong) but the flavor was subtle. I sautéed the scallions and then added the chicken and sprinkled it with a little ginger as it cooked. I like my veggies firm, and the green beans were pretty soft so I will probably cut the steam time to ~5 minutes next time. Overall, an easy and tasty dish. Even my kids loved it.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Turned out great! I really like the sauce. I will make it again.  I didn't have any chili paste, but the sauce still turned out nice.  I added some onion and red pepper strips.  Very nice. Kids even liked it.

I added some galangal for extra Indonesian flavoring with the sauce, and I cooked the sauce in with the chicken and green beans; these changes did not improve the taste. I also added chopped garlic. I was out if lime juice otherwise I would have substituted the lemon juice with lime juice. Instead of honey I probably would use kecap manis. Also instead of chili paste I would just chop either red or green bird's eye chili pepper and cook that in with the sauce. This didn't taste particularly Indonesian to me... Probably will not make again.  All my suggested changes are basically similar to making authentic chicken satay, just minus the satay sticks and turning it into a stir fry.

Molly on the Buzz noted this recipe and I decided to try it. I did change it up by grilling boneless chicken breasts basting with some of the sauce and steamed broccoli instead of green beans. Placed the chicken on the rice, added broccoli all around and drizzled the sauce over everything. The sauce is really key and was very good! Thanks, we enjoyed this!

This was easy, and good, but it lacked the deep savory flavors of Asian dishes. Although the general population felt otherwise, I felt the peanut butter flavor was the front runner for flavor.  I'm more a soy, sesame oil, garlic, sherry and black pepper girl.

I did double the recipe and ate two small portions so it's not bad, I guess I expected more from the reviews.

This was so yummy! After reading a lot of the comments it was obvious that its best to double the sauce. OMG the sauce! YUMMY!! I also added an extra tsp of chili paste. I didn't have green beans so I used what I had on hand. I heated 2 tsp of olive oil in a skillet and pan fried one small onion (sliced thinly) with one carrot cut into matchsticks, then added some half a small yellow zuchhini chopped in quarters and a small red pepper cut in thin strips. Cooked them partially then put aside. Once the chicken was almost cooked I added the vegetables and 1/2 cup of frozen peas (cooked for 30 seconds in microwave). Tossed it all together than added half the sauce. I served the remaining sauce on the side so that everyone could choose just how saucy they wanted it. Everyone said it was fabulous and asked if I could please make again. We loved the sauce so much that we are going to use it to baste skewers of pork and chicken on the BBQ this weekend! Enjoy!

My husband and I liked the sauce, but kids didn't.  Didn't have any honey, so I used apple butter instead.  Weird, I know.  But it was good.  Didn't have any chili paste; used a couple of dashes of ground cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes.  I will make this again, fo sho!

I've got to agree with Maxween's review, this seriously just tastes like peanut butter covered chicken. All the ingredients that go into that sauce have their flavors completely annihilated by the peanut butter.

I truly cannot recommend this recipe. I like chicken, I like peanut butter, I like rice, I like green beans. When you put them together, they form an ungodly mash.

We really enjoyed this!  I doubled the sauce as other have mentioned because I like it saucy.  Next time I make it (and I will make again) I think I might add more/different vegetables.  Mushrooms, broccoli, carrots might be a good addition.  Thanks for sharing this super easy and tasty dish!

I may have messed this up and added too much but all I tasted was peanut butter.  The combination sounds great but I found the peanut butter drowned out the other flavors.

I used some chopped chili peppers instead of chili paste in order to give the recipe some extra heat. It turned out wonderful, and was very easy and quick to prepare.

This was easy and delicious!  I'm actually eating it right now as I type :) I think I added a bit too much peanut butter, because I was in a rush and didn't measure.  But my 2yr old loooves peanut butter, so he dug right in!  After I served my son I added a little more curry sauce (didn't have chili paste) to spice it up more for my husband and myself(and overpower the peanut butter). I enjoy the green beans in it, but would like to try it with asparagus, as another reviewer suggested, and broccoli.

Great recipe. I am not much of a green bean fan, so I substituted with great northern beans - not very Asian I'm sure...

Absolutely amazing: only made one change to sauce out of necessity- had no red chile paste so used few drops of tabasco. Gave it just enough kick in the background but still ok for my one year old two year old to eat! As for what I put the sauce on: had no green beans or produce more or less, so used frozen bag of stew veggies of all things, one fresh bell pepper, and frozen peas. Sauteed veggies in some broth, added powdered ginger, garlic powder, pepper. Added cooked chicken then covered everything with peanut sauce. Topped plates with chopped green onions. Was so surprised and food tasted unbelievable. Thank you so much for giving my family a show stopping balanced meal.

Honestly, I didn't think I was going to like this recipe. I'm not a fan of peanut butter but I wanted to make something different for my husband. So this was an experiment and it went horribly right! When all was finished I loved it, my husband, who hates peanut butter, loved it but my children, who love peanut butter, would not touch it with a ten foot pole. Maybe, it was the green beans they had such an aversion to but like I said, i made it for my husband. I didn't put in fresh green beans but used frozen and cut the red chile paste and added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead.

DELICIOUS!!!  I couldn't find any red pepper paste so I have used both chipotle and cayenne powder and it has been wonderful with both.  The chipotle gives the sauce a nice smoky flavor.  I have made this many time for at home and potlucks and have received rave reviews!

I'm finally getting around to reviewing this. We love it! It is now a "regular" in our meal rotation.  At some point I'm going to try it with tofu instead of chicken...

I am a big fan of peanut based sauces so I had to try this one.  Overall I liked it, but there was something about the sauce that struck me a little off.  I plan on trying some of the suggestions others have thrown out to improve upon it.

This was so good. I wasn't sure about adding the chicken to the peanut butter, so I just kept it to the side and dipped it.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE peanut butter.. but I did NOT love this recipe.  I followed it exactly and it just tasted like chicken and green beans rolled in PB. My boyfriend thought it was ok, but I could barely eat it.  It needs some drastic changes. I will not make this again.

I followed the sauce recipe exactly & cooked the chicken in sesame oil instead of olive oil.  The sauce thickened up nicely however the finished product needs some serious help. The lemon juice was very prominent, I did use fresh squeezed & that might have been part of the issue.  My husband thought it was ok but I thought it tasted like chicken/green beans dipped in peanut butter mixed with lemon juice, not flavors that go well together. It stuck to my tongue & I couldn't finish.  Next time I will use more broth & less peanut butter to thin it out a little, leave out the lemon juice, and maybe replace it with coconut milk, I'm not sure but this recipe needs to be changed before I could eat it again.

yum- I also added red bell pepper - the sauce gets very creamy and delicious- I used brown rice which adds to the creaminess.  Cilantro makes a great addition and fresh topping.  The kids and kids' friend all thought this was great- as did hubby.

I used lime juice instead of lemon, and also garnished the dish with lime wedges, plus a sprinkle of freshly-snipped cilantro. I just added the green beans and sauce mixture to the browned chicken chunks. Part from that, I made this pretty much as written. Delicious. Thanks!

This was pretty bland even with the red chile paste.  It also has a much stronger peanut butter taste than I was looking for.  Thanks for the recipe but I will not be trying this again.

I dont know how anyone can complain that this dish was bland?! I followed the recipe as written with great results. The chile paste gave it a nice kick. The sauce coated the beans and chicken nicely and gave it lots of flavor. Will make again!

This is a really good quick dinner.  I grilled the chicken and then poured the sauce over the chicken and rice on the plate... you CAN taste the peanut butter, but all the flavours work well.  I'll be making this one again!

I think I was expecting much more due to the great reviews of this recipe.  It was very simple to make and tasted great.  My boyfriend loved it (and would have given it 5 stars) I wished it would have been a tad spicier.  I doubled the chili paste in the recipe and it still wasn't quite enough for me.  Will definitely make again though, perhaps tripling the chili paste!

Used wild rice for a twist.  Doubled the sauce so it was almost a gravy with all the green beans on top the of rice. Also made an extra pound of chicken (lightly seasoned).  Made it for work and everyone loved it!

Delicious!  I added garlic, red pepper and mushrooms to the mix, and halved the chicken.  Could easily make this with tofu and vegetable broth as a vegetarian alternative.  I wanted it 'saucier' ;) so I upped the quantity of all sauce ingredients.  Used basmati rice.  This is an awesome, totally versatile and SIMPLE recipe.

The combination of sauce ingredients was definitely a bit strange for us.  My husband took three bites and could not eat anymore.  He said that it was like eating a peanut butter chicken sandwich.  But, if you really like the combination of peanut butter and poultry, then you will probably like it.   I'm glad we tried it.

With the recipe as written I had to give it just 3-stars :(    I tasted the sauce after completion (following the recipe exactly) and it just did not do anything for me. I ended up thickening the sauce with flour/water mixture, adding more honey, more chile paste and more lemon juice. I also sauteed some garlic and added this to the sauce as well. After I revised the recipe, the sauce was pretty good and my husband and I really enjoyed it!

Both my teenagers loved this! I added some onion, doubled the sauce and used a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it. There were NO leftovers.

I made this with cashew butter (from Trader Joe's) instead of peanut butter. It was great--rich and complex flavor. I made extra sauce and used every bit of it.

My husband really liked this recipe.  I didnt care for the flavors in it, but I dont think my dislike is a knock on the recipe, just a difference in taste buds!  I think it is worth a taste. I will be making again for my husband.

This was awesome!  We made it with whole trimmed frozen green beans and brown rice. The next time I think I will add more chile paste as it wasn't very spicy (that may just be my paste though). We will definitely make this again.

I enjoyed this, but the rest of my family didn't. The peanut butter taste wasn't quite subtle enough. Perhaps I'll try again with less.

I had company over and didn't know what to make since the visit had been unsuspected.  I found and decided to make this little gem and it turned out terrific!  I like things very spicy while my company didn't.  This recipe kept us both happy although I will definitely add more hot paste next time.  As others suggested, I will also make extra sauce.  It is wonderful as left overs!!!!

I didn't have any green peas but had a bag of mixed frozen veggies.  I used that instead  and it was fabulous!

I did a little bit of change with this one.  First I did not make white rice.  I made yellow vegetable rice.  I put an envelope of sazon (make sure you buy the one with coriander and annatto) and I put frozen veggies in with the rice.  It all cooks together. It comes out really good.  As for the chicken I cooked it first and I seasoned it with Adobo.  Once the chicken was cook I mixed all the ingredients to make the sauce.  Once the sauce was cooking for a bit I put in all the chicken in the sauce and cooked it.  I let the chicken cook in the sauce covered for about 10 minutes.  I also used beef booth since that is what I had on hand.  It all come out really good.  I did not use the green beans too since I made vegetable rice.  Also I used a teaspoon of chilli powder because I could not find Chilli paste.  I would defiantly make this one again.

Neither my family nor I liked this recipe.  We just didn't care for the taste of the peanut sauce.  I did substitute chili powder for chili paste as someone else suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed.

The sauce can get a little too thick, so be careful about keeping it on the stove too long to thicken. Otherwise, this has turned into one of our all-time favorite stand by meals. Y-U-M!!

This was one of the most delicious chicken recipes I have ever cooked. I added the chicken to the sauce and let them simmer together for 3 minutes to give the chicken more flavor. Snow peas and water chestnuts work also work really well.

I've never eaten a meal that had peanut butter besides pb&j and I didn't know what to expect.  My boyfriend and I thought it was very tasty, but you have to really enjoy the peanut sauce.  The sauce was not overpowering at all, but different.  We will probably make this again....  :)

It's not the prettiest dish, but it tasted good! I'll add more chile paste next time, and maybe more stir-fry vegetables.  It's worth making again.

Well, I really wanted to love this recipe but it was just okay. My hubby wasn't excited about it. I would add garlic & onions to the chicken while cooking. I love pad thai and this would be good on top of the noodles that are used in pad thai instead of rice.

It's a delicious and simple recipe. My family loved it, although it tasted a bit too much like peanutbutter. Next time I'll try it with a bit less peanutbutter. I think you could also add a few other vegetables to the sauce. 
Thanks for this great recipe!!

I made this dish last night and scaled the recipe to 6 servings instead of 4.  It called for three tablespoons of lemon juice and all I had to substitute was white vinegar and I only put in 2 tbsp because 3 seemed a bit much.  it looked okay at first but then when you taste it, it REALLY has a strong PEANUT BUTTER taste to it (not just a regular peanut sauce taste).  Also, when I put it in the leftovers in the fridge that night and took it out the next day, it basically looked like regular peanut butter with pieces of chicken and green bean.  if anyone has any ideas on how to dilute the peanut butter and still have it taste good, suggestions are welcome.

I thought this was good, but hubby and the kids weren't too sure. They said it tasted too much like just peanut butter mixed in with the chicken and green beans. Guess we won't be adding this one to the recipe box. Thanks anyway!

Great basic flavor, easy to make, I plan on using double or triple the chili paste next time though.

This was a very good recipe.  Dh said it was "tasty."  I doubled the sauce and I am glad I did.  I mistakenly grabbed chili garlic sauce instead of paste, and I used 3 tsp of chili sauce, but I thought it could have used more.  Testing the sauce alone, it did not do much for me, but once it was mixed with the onion, chicken and green beans it was very good.  A good blend of flavors.
