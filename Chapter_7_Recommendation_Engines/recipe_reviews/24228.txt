this recipe is a must for sushi fans!  I cant begin to tell you the money I've been spending a week on sushi! *lol*  

I make the rolls with the rice in the nori or on the outside.  I've watched at the sushi station and figured out after pressing the rice onto the nori, sprinkle sesame seeds and flip it over onto the bamboo mat (wrapped in syran wrap) so the rice is on the bottom and nori ontop.  Fill with whatever you want and roll.  

I've been making the small snack ones with cucumber and carrot in them (nori outside, rice inside), crab salad instead of the crabstick with avacado, shrimp with cucumber and this spicy sauce they make at the sushi station (consisting of rice vinegar, mayo and chilli sauce (the oriental one), the other shrimp one Ive made is shrimp, spicy sauce, avacado and these little crispy rice balls (not sure what they are called but it adds a little crunch) wow are they good!

I make these now atleast once a week.  If you go to kitchen ect or some place like that, you can pick up a sushi set which has all you need, (bamboo mat, bamboo spoon, rice, wasabi, vinegar, soy sauce, little cook book ect) and its only 30 bucks!  well worth it seeing that 9 rolls cost you 5-7 each time.  

Also, the guy at the sushi station said the trick to perfect sushi is a tight roll!  Use the mat and press tight each turn you make with the mat, this will make the rolls tight and things wont fall out or come apart.  Good Luck and Enjoy!

the hardest part of any sushi recipe is finding a bamboo mat... for a long time mine would come out bulky and uneven and generally not pretty. It's hard to roll sushi with just your hands - the nori rips if you press too hard and the roll coomes apart if not hard enough. The easiest thing to do if you cant find a bamboo mat is use a clean dish towel. To get the meat and other stuff right in the center of the roll, position it 3/4 down on the rice, rather than the center. Just some sushi tricks I've learned these past few years ^^

It's nice to see sushi recipes posted. Thanks for this one. I too do not use sugar in my sushi rice. It seems the seasoned rice vinegar has enough sweetness on its own. Also, my japanese neighbor, (originally from Tokyo) always used Heavy Duty Foil instead of a bamboo mat to roll her sushi. She just smiled at me when she saw my bamboo mat and said "No one really uses these at home in Japan." The foil is easy enough, and no cleaning! Just throw it/recycle it. She taught me that in her neighborhood, a california roll had 3 color components, White/red (the crab), green,( cucumber or avocado) and yellow/orange, (roe, carrot, or she used scrambled egg strips). I always make mine with crab, cucumber, & egg.) My husband lived in Japan for 6 yrs and he likes his sushi with crab, lettuce, and mayo. WHEN SHE CUT THE SUSHI ROLL> She used a serrated knife, and a water soaked paper-towel. She folded up the wet paper-towel and dabbed each side of the knife blade to make it wet..before cutting each individual slice. So the nori would have a clean cut edge (not torn/jagged). I hope any of this info. is helpful.

My sister had to present a project for her japanese class, so she chose to make these sushi rolls for them.  Boy were they a hit, she made everyone one and made extras just in case.  They were all gone and people were asking for more.  Tastes just as good as any restaurants. I had a problem trying to find "short-grain" rice, and then I figured out it was "calrose" rice.  That's the rice they use.  Don't be fooled by the brands that say "japenese rice" that sell for 3x as much as calrose rice.  They're both the same.  Anyway, thanks, will be making again.

I've made these for years and I love them. You can make them with only one item rolled in or combine items in the rolls. I don't like to flake the crabmeat (it's better when you buy the long thin strips - it's more like at the restaurants, easier, and less messy). Go to a Japanese grocery store where you can buy frozen salmon, tuna, roe, etc. for some more variety. Also, I spread a VERY thin line of wasabi on the rice before I put on the avocado etc. It adds a little kick. And make sure when you're spreading the rice on the nori that you leave about a half inch at the end without rice so that when you're tightly rolling and almost at the end, you can wet that bare edge slightly with a little water on your fingertip. That way the roll will hold together. I don't heat the nori. I store it in the fridge, take it out and roll it just like that. I usually cut them into 8 pieces, otherwise they're too big. And when making the rice I add salt to the water instead of adding it after the rice is cooked and I don't put any sugar in it when I add the rice vinegar. Serve with soy sauce with a little wasabi mixed in. Sooooooo delicious!

Sometimes its hard to keep those bambo mats clean. So what i do is put mine in a zip lock bag or wrap it in seran wrap. It works great and you can just throw away the bag or the saran when done. This recipe is very good and so easy to do.

These were great! Tip: For the section of the recipe that calls for adding/blending the rice vinegar, sugar and salt mixture into the rice pan - do the opposite.  Remove the rice from the pan and mix it into a large bowl of the rice vinegar, sugar ,and salt blend. By doing this you won't scorch your rice when the sugary mixture meets the hot bottom of the pan.  This may have been what happened to the one reviewer who said her rice scorches each time she's made it.  This also helps the rice to cool faster.  :o)

This is a good recipie for sushi, however, I usually add a slice of cream cheese (put in freezer for 10 min to harden) and I leave the pickled ginger on the side with the wasabi.  If you like spicy rolls, mix the krab with japanese mayo and sriracha chili sauce (avail at asian stores.) Its awesome!

My husband and I LOVE sushi, but this rice was WAY too sweet.  I suggest cutting back on the sugar big time.  I will stick to my original recipe.

It was very good, but I added toasted sesame seeds to the rice, approximately 2 tablespoons.  It added a delicate flavour and texture to the sushi.  Also, wetting my hands to handle the rice helped create an even layer.

My Korean friend taught a group of us to make sushi.  This is a good starter recipe, but it is too sweet.  I use 1/3 cup regular vinegar, 1 Tbsp sugar and 1 tsp salt.  Add just enough of this to the rice to make it sticky (so you may not use it all.)  I also add toasted sesame seed to the rice.  I have never heated the Nori or used a bamboo mat, and I've never had a problem rolling it.  Use this recipe as a base, and change it to suit your taste.  It's easy and your friends will be so impressed that YOU made it!

This recipe for sushi is perfect! I had some doubts that it'd come out anything like the kind I've bought before, but after adding the rice vinegar/sugar mixture to the rice, and I caught a wiff of the authentic sushi roll smell, OH! I could hardly believe it. :D I made these with california style ingredients: a slice of fake crab, cucumber, and avocado. Then I made the inside-out version, using sesame seeds to keep the rice on the outside from sticking too much. I even chopped up a fake crab chunk into tiny bits, mixed in 1.5 tbsp mayo (miracle whip, really) and a dab of wasabi, used it with the avocado strips, and made another set of inside-out rolls. Delicious! Tastes like the stuff I pay $7+ for at the grocery store or restaurants, but at a major fraction of the cost. Just so you know, I actually used long grain rice (its what I already had in the cupboard) and it worked out very well. I suggest you rinse the rice several times until the water is no longer white or super cloudy. Keep your fingers and knife dipped in water often to keep the rice from sticking. Roll the sushi nice and tight so the insides don't fall out, especially if you do an inside-out roll. AND I didn't use a bamboo mat- large ziplock bags work great, you'll be surprised. For first-timers, just so you know, you roll the sushi with the bag/mat like an army tank's tread- don't roll it into the sushi! ;)

A good take on the California Roll recipe. Left out the pickled ginger due to personal preferences, but otherwise everything was really yummy! Best served with Wasabi.

I wish there were more stars. Sushi is my absolute favorite thing in the whole world. We spend $50.00 for my husband and I each time we go out... or at least we used to. This recipe is seriously just as good as the pricey restaurants and SOOO much cheaper. I made 10 servings of this and fed 4 people till we were all stuffed for  $8.00:
1/2	pack	Nori  $1.00
1/4 5lb bag rice $1.75
1/2 cup sugar	$0.40
1/2 cup Rice vinegar	$0.80
1 Avocados $1.00
1/2 Cucumber	$0.50
1/4 pkg Cream Cheese $0.57
1/4 Lbs Imitation Crab $0.75
1/4 lb Shrimp $1.00
(We don't care for ginger)
I got the rice and nori at a local Asian market and the rest at Winco which kept the prices low. You'll need the bamboo mat which is also available at any Asian market and many other stores. Also, soy sauce, sriracha sauce, and wasabi are a must. I put all of the ingredients out buffet style and we just picked out our fillings and had fun sampling the different rolls. I included jalapenos and made a spicy mayo to mix with the crab for a few rolls. I took a roll to work for my boss who also loves sushi and she commented all day about how great it was. I even made a vegi roll for my pregnant friend and she loved it to. I definitely recommend doing a google search and watching a few videos on sushi rolling and making the perfect rice. The rolling is easier than it looks, but making the rice right is the challenge. Have fun and enjoy! I know we will.

I make these often, but more the korean style, wrapping strips of fried egg, cucumber, carrot, crab sticks and smoked sausage..I always use short grain rice- or pudding rice, its glutinous, sticks together right and tastes the same for much less the price of 'sushi rice'. Once I've rolled mine I brush with sesame oil and sprinkle sesame seeds on.. soo yum!

Just some tips I have learned from making my own sushi:

An easy one to start with would be something simple like a tuna roll.  It's easier to roll up.  

Keeping your hands slightly wet will help with the rice sticking to them.  

Having a rice cooker is a huge help.  

Heating the nori isn't required, it'll soak up the water from the rice and become soft and flexible.

If you check Borders, they sell a sushi kit with chopsticks, roll recipes, bamboo mat, and little soy sauce dishes.

Make sure to get some powdered wasabi, and low sodium soy sauce, and mix a little sugar into it.  Sushi soy sauce is less salty and sweeter than regular soy sauce.

You need to cool the rice to room temperature before using it.  Very important.

Cute idea but I thought I would note, this is not Sushi, This is Maki, Sushi is fish (raw or not) on rice, Maki is the name of the nori wrapped roll.
We have been making Maki in my (half Japanese) family for years and for all the interesting ways you can cusomise it, why pay $12 for it?
Thank you! this is a great inexpensive way to enjoy something wonderful and (depending on what you fill it with) healthy!

Great recipe I am a sushi nut! I could eat it daily. The only different thing that I do I pulse the crab or lox with a bit of cream cheese then smear in roll. I also like to serve it with plum ginger dipping sauce.

I was amazed that my kids ate these - AND they LOVED them!
I gotta get a sushi mat, though, the towel trick I found didn't roll them tight enough.

Perfect flavor, but keep in mind that with every batch of rice the absorbtion of liquid will be different. You should only add a little of the sushi-su mix at a time and taste the flavor as it cooks. Also, take into consideration that the flavor will mellow once cooled.

This is a great basic recipe for suchi.  You can add anything to it that you want.  As for the reviwers saying they didn't need to bake to nori: if you just bought it, then it will be strong enough, but if you opened the package and saved some nori for later, even if you sealed it in a bag, you might need to bake it because it gets soft and falls apart.  Thanks for the recipe!  I have been making this sushi for almost a year now and my boyfreind still requests it...that's when you know its a keeper :)

Nice starting recipe but I would recommend lowering the amount of rice vinegar and sugar down to 2 tablespoons each (even when using 2 cups of uncooked rice as I do to make a California Roll) as you don't want it to overpower the flavor. Otherwise a good recipe to start from.

This was our first sushi making experience and it was very successful! This recipe is easy and wonderful! We also did not heat the nori and it was fine. We used sashimi tuna and cream cheese for some variation.

I used this recipe only for the rice of my sushi rolls. I thought the vinegar was way too strong, and there was also a bit too much sugar. I had to make a second batch of plain rice to mix with the sushi rice to dull the taste a bit. 

Of course, I'm used to sushi from Japan, which is a bit more mild than American sushi.

Aside from the difficulity of rolling the sushi the right way, it's a great recipe.  May I also suggest imitation lobster meat in place of crab meat?  They cost about the same but they taste quite different.

All I needed was easily found at a local grocery store called Meijer, in the Asian food section. Now if I can find a book on Sushi rolling for dummies... ;)

I am flabbergasted by all of the positive reviews for this recipe.  The proportions are way, WAY off.  Look at any other recipe for sushi rice and you will see.  This recipe has WAY too much vinegar and WAY too much sugar for the amount of rice used.  The end result is a sloppy, wet, sugary mess that doesn't hold together.  Also, most other recipes call for heating the sugar/vinegar/salt combination together to blend them, and also for letting the rice rest to absorb the last amount of liquid.  This was just awful.  I can only assume that everyone else who made this recipe simply ignored all of the errors and did their own thing.  This was a disaster.

This is a great recipe!  My children have really gotten into the process of making sushi.  We have made this recipe exactly, but we have also added cream cheese and/or tuna.  Next we plan on trying some smoked salmon.  I find the seasoning in the rice a bit strong so I use a little more rice.  Even my 4 year old likes this!

The rice turned out just right with this recipe.  The "stuffings" are pretty standard and you can adjust them to taste.  Very useful recipe for getting started with sushi. Thanks Adam.

I love making sushi and this recipe is a good basic one if your just starting off. I use a rice cooker to make the rice and the rice I used is calrose rice I put in 1 cup rice and 1.5 cups of water. Always remember that if your using a rice cooker add a half cup more water than the amount of rice you use ex: 2 cups rice you would need 2.5 cups water. When the rice has cooked i add about half tbs of rice vinegar and 3 tsps of sugar then mix while the rice is still warm. For the stuffing I like strips of cucumber, crm cheese, fresh salmon, avocado, and a mixture of flaked crab w/ mayo. I only use half of the seaweed paper that way Im not eating too much rice. After I cover the seaweed with rice I sprinkle it with sesame seeds and flip it over to stuff it. I then roll it on a bamboo mat covered in plastic wrap. The sauces I use is eel sauce (which can be found at your asian market by the name unagi sauce) and spicy mayo (half sriracha and half mayo)

Excellent! The only change I made was that I put the ginger on the side rather than inside the sushi (I'm not a huge fan of ginger) and I halved the sugar. My friends raved about them. They were rather huge, which was unexpected. Giant Sushi - so I found that if I used all of the stuffing it just squished out. I ended up using approximately 3/4 of what was asked for.

This recipe is good.  It was my first attempt at a roll, and it's surprisingly easy.   Bringing the combination of the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, to a boil and allowing it to cool makes for better consistancy.  I used more rice than the recipe called for.  And, it's important to note the rice should be fanned down to body temperature before applying it to the nori.  I did not include ginger in mine as that is traditionally used as a palatte cleanser after eating the sushi.  Very good.

A lot of prep work, but tons of fun and very, very good!  I made the rice in a rice cooker, it came out perfect!  Make sure you use sushi rice as the rice really makes the difference here.  Whole Foods had excellent nori sheets, I highly recommend.  You can change it up any way you want to.  We added lobster tail to some...yummy!

I'm not a huge sushi eater, but I really did like this recipe.  I took another reviewers advice and made a roll with bacon and avacado.  It was my favorite.  I will be making this again later in the week using shrimp.  Today we used crab, bacon, and salmon.

This was a great recipe! I will say the rice vinegar was a bit strong (next time I may try using only 2 tbs), but we will definitely be making this again.

A good starter recipe for when we were beginners at homemade sushi...  My husband and I still use this recipe for just the rice, occasionally, when making sushi.  Don't be afraid to also try smoked salmon, julienned veggies, or even soba noodles.. mmm!

Help!  Can't figure out why all the nori I've tried at home has a strong "fishy" taste.  It's never like that when I've had it out or purchased it from a market.  I have tried rinsing it with no luck.  It's all that keeps me and hubby from making it at home on a regular basis.  Can anyone explain or give us some advice on the type or brand to buy???? Thanks!!

This is a great basic sushi roll recipe.  I love to entertain and had a "sushi party" recently.  I prepared the rice in advance and had all the ingredients sliced and chopped (i.e shrimp,avocado, cucumber, smoked salmon, pickled ginger, daikon radish...etc. BE CREATIVE)  Everyone was provided with a rolling mat and plenty of nori sheets then layered on the rice and ingredients of their choice.  This was a super fun party and I will defintely use this recipe again!

This was my 1st ever sushi roll making recipe. However in saying that, I found a few things that made it difficult. I followed the rice making to a T and will say after nearly 25 minutes on the stove, it looked like porridge. I'll stick to making rice in my rice cooker. The result in which adding the sugar, salt and rice vinegar made it extremely wet, not dry-ish sticky. It also made the nori tear-able. That also resulted in 3 massacred rolls before I realized...strain off the liquid. I even went and sought out sushi videos, just to be clear at what I was doing wrong and it was the rice. Next time, increase the adjustments to 1:1 cup ratio. And follow through with the said amounts of rice vinegar, sugar and salt. I couldn't find pickled ginger anywhere, so I left it out. And another note to help with rolling, I found if I laid down a sheet of plastic wrap over my mat, it helped keep the mat clean and kept my ingredients together when I was assembling and rolling them up. Made for clean, tight and uniformed sushi rolls. Will make again even though the rice components gave me a problem in the beginning. My daughter was happy with the end result and asked me to help her learn. So she could make her own.

I Love this!!  I used this recipe to learn how to make Sushi, and now I make it all the time!  It is much cheaper than eating out, and my husband agrees it is restaurant quality!  It is fun to make as well.  I like trying different ingredients to make my own special rolls.

My family had a great time making these together. So easy!! I followed the advice of other reviewers & left the sugar & salt out of the rice, (my rice vinegar had plenty of sugar.) We also added toasted sesame seeds to rice mixture. AWESOME post for a great base recipe and beginners!!  Thank you, 1ORANGE1!!

I LOVE sushi! In my opinion though, this recipe is way to sweet with a big vinegar taste. I didn't listen to one of the reviews that said it was too sweet.....I regret that now. Luckily, I only made two rolls so it wasn't a big waste. I may try to reduce the vinegar and sugar significantly and try again.

Just made it and it came out wonderfully. The rice is exactly the way it tastes and smells in Japan, and the directions clear. I only made the small change of ripping the nori sheet to its roll size before starting to roll, I think my knife was too dull as it broke down the nori and undid the roll.  It takes a while to get the hang of how to make a perfect roll, but it was really worth it. I can't wait to surprise my friends with this as an appetizer. Tonight's rolls will only be for me though!

This was my first time making sushi & after reading the reviews, I really didn't think I would have any problems.  First, the rice didn't absorb all of the water, next the nori didn't really change in texture after heating & lastly, after putting ingredients on nori & rolling, the ingredients sqeezed out the side & the roll fell apart.  I was extremely frustrated.

These were really good! The rice was perfect. I didn't used flaked crab because I think it's easier to use the "leg-style." Now I just have to work on rolling them better!

I never knew sushi could be so easy! I can't wait to try out different flavor combinations. However, it doesn't freeze well, the sushi loses its shape. Plus there didn't seem to be enough rice for four nori sheets, so next time I'm making it I'm going to double the rice. It was so pretty that after I made it, I took a picture!

Good recipe, we made it without any seafood, it was still great.  I had trouble with the rice and getting the rolls tight. It should say heat nori for 30 seconds.  Also to press the rice on the nori with hands to make it stick together. I mean realy press it alot!  We made it again with sald shrimp and the fake crab. yummmy! My husband did all the pressing.  I will make over and over again.

This was the first time I have made Sushi and I loved it. I didn't roll it tight enough and next time i will make twice the rice. Very good and way cheaper than buying it at the restaurant and better than store bought. I will make again and again.

I have had homemade sushi and restaurant sushi and I didn't care for this. Way, way too sweet. I made it according to directions and my rice was very wet and extremely sweet. I made it again and halfed the sugar and also used less vinegar and it was still really sweet. I couldn't finish my roll.

This was a great recipe for beginers.  THis was my first time attempting to make sushi and my roll ended up about 6 inches in diameter.  I guess it will take me a coulpe tries to perfect the art of sushi rolling.  I also added cream cheese to my roll.

Delicous sushi rolls and great for beginers to try out. We had a bit of trouble cutting it, so we decided next time we try it to let it sit in the refrigerator and then cut it. Otherwise the taste was great and I'm sure once we get the hang of cutting it, the sushi will go a lot easier.

This recipe is wonderful. One of my favorite rolls that is always is a hit is my 'Bacon and Avocado' roll. Inside the roll is spicy mayo, 2 or 3 strips of bacon, and avocado slices. A perfect and easy combination!

This recipe is basically about the rice and it is too sweet and too vinegary. I did not like the taste or texture of this rice. I rolled them inside out because to me they look prettier that way. They looked gorgeous but I did not like the rice taste!

I make sushi with ingredients I find in my refregerator also. This time, I used imitation crab, tobiko roe, avocado and canned chicken. I also used plain rice instead of sushi rice. I like this way for calfornia type rolls. Kids love to make sushi too.

We just got some bamboo sushi mats as a gift and we had never made sushi before.  I found this recipe and it was great!  Not only was it delicious, but it was so much fun to make, too.  I used 2 cups of rice and only 2 tablespoons vinegar and sugar and it was perfect.

Great Sushi base!! I just did my rice in a steamer and it was amazing with this recipe. Of course, being the sushi junkie that I am, I had ingredients for 6 different rolls.

Excellant...great flavor. I omitted the pickled ginger. This was a huge hit with everone, even my 10 year old. I made the wasabi/mayo sauce that I found on this site...perfect!

I didn't have rice vinegar so subbed with apple cider vinegar; wasn't too sweet like some other people thought but maybe that's why.  Used a large ziplock bag like one other reviewer recommended...worked great and I could see what I was doing.  Had no idea making sushi was this EASY!!!

Wonderful! I use cooked salad shrimp in mine instead of crab meat - another inexpensive and safe alternative to preparing raw fish. Cream cheese is great in them too.

I'm not a big sushi fan but i've made these rolls several times for my friends and family and they absolutely love them! I also make my rice a little different, using another sushi rice recipe on this website. Also the process of making them is really fun in my opinion.

I cut way down on the sugar and used a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar. For the roll I used cucumber, avacado, and roasted eel. This was washed down with Korean Soju.

The rice turned out excellent.  I used the tempura shrimp recipe from this site and made tempura rolls with avocado, a bit of the imitation crab mixed with mayo and lots of Sriracha & wasabi.  So good, a girlfriend & I made about 10 rolls and we had a feast with our fiances.  Best of all, it's super inexpensive compared to going out to sushi.

LOVE this recipe and use it all the time. I use regular rice (because that is just what I have on hand) and let simmer after adding the vinegar/sugar mixture until it is the desired consistancy. Otherwise it ends up too watery. Having some trouble finding places that supply sushi quality fish so I can expand out from California rolls.

this was... ok. I LOVE sushi but the rice was too sweet. And authentically, you don't put pickled ginger INSIDE the sushi... and! NO on the dipping it in teriyaki sauce and wasabi... gotta be soy sauce and wasabi. Nice attempt though.

This sushi turned out perfect! My mom and I were worried the rice wouldn't taste right. I suggest letting it sit before serving so that the nori moistens. Next time I will use more rice, a full cup, and it calls for more imitation crab than we used.

Fantastic!  Just like I've had in many Japanese restaurants.  I used smoked salmon, which was great.  Make sure to dip in a mixture of soy sauce and wasabi.  I doubled the recipe and my husband and I ate it three days in a row!

I've never made sushi before and this is an excellent recipe. I had no idea there is rice vinegar, sugar and salt mixed with the rice. We used avocado, cucumber, mango, shrimp and imitation crab to make a variety of rolls. I'll try adding cream cheese and thin carrot sticks in the future. My only issue was that there was not enough rice for 4 nori sheets. Other recipes also mention to leave a 1/2'' gap at the top of the nori sheet to help with rolling it up, which I will try next time. Great recipe and the family loved them.

Today , I made sushi. It was difficult work. It is very hard to make a stable roll.  I have to spend more time on rolling. It will taste very good if you put less rice and more ingredients in the roll.  I think it is a good snack.

Simple and tasty! I put a little less sugar in my rice just to cut back a bit. Crab meat is probably the easiest ingredient to come by and it tastes great in these rolls!

Way too much sugar, salt, and vinegar for the rice. Next time I'll try half the amount of vinegar and omit the salt and sugar entirely.

This was really good, made it with avocado and imitation lobster, served with wasabi paste and siracha sauce on the side. Rice had great flavor and held together, rolled like a dream, even without heating the nori. We will definitely have this again.

This was a really easy recipe. I didn't add sugar and the rice was great. We added cream chse and asparagus (yum yum). The only thing we didn't care for was the imitation crab, it had no flavor. But we will definite try it again with different ingredients. Thanks

This is the first time I make sushi and it was better than the restaurants! My family wants it on a weekly basis plus birthdays and holidays lol! I couldn't believe the kids loved it so much, the youngest is 4! My other son who's been eating sushi since 3 (now 10 ), also said it's the best ever! Sushi is his favorite food and he knows his stuff when it comes to sushi. He usually has 4 rolls on his own, if not more, at the restaurant and I'm so happy I found this recipe. This is cost effective and tastes amazing! The ingredient proportions were right on. Don't change a thing and follow the recipe exactly as it is, just prefect!

Well, I tried this and as is my way completely winged it, I had some already cooked wrong sort of rice. With the addition of the wrong vinegar (balsamic) some soy sauce fish sauce and oyster sauce with sugar mixed in I then spread the rice out on the nori then stuck a couple of fish sticks, some chopped olives, a squirt of alioli sauce then rolled it up with a tea towel. When I tried to cut it everything fell to bits. With the second nori I kept it a bit drier and it worked a bit better. But it tasted great! Oh, and I added toasted seed to it as well because it was there. This I will master with the help of the fridge before cutting and also putting less rice in before rolling! The vinegar thing is key to the taste and fish sauce (thai) added something too.

Way to much salt and sugar. I made a batch with 1 full cup of rice. Besides, already enough salt in the dipping sauce.

We made these for a New Year's Eve party with a family who was gluten-free.  They couldn't believe how easy these were to make and how tasty.  I found out later that soy sauce has gluten in it, however, but everyone at the party loved these.  They were the first things to go.

I'm going to agree with Mommyof2CutiePies after trying this recipe for myself.  While the rice vinegar sugar mixture does make the rice taste like sushi rice rather than ordinary bland rice, it is WAY too overpowering and sweet.  This was my first attempt at sushi and I thought I would try this recipe since it has such high reviews, but it has left me wondering if either everyone who rated it highly tweaked it, or if they just haven't had good sushi...  Again, I wasn't expecting this to come out amazing being my first attempt, but it was simply inedible, even after a second try.  I am going to research some more recipes for sushi rice and have to experiment to try to create an edible sushi roll.  If you try this recipe out, I would recommend slowly adding the rice vinegar mixture a little at a time to taste.  I might even cut a table spoon of sugar out of the mix.  Slight tweaking of this recipe may bring it from a 2 star to at least a 4 star if not higher.

I make this as a special treat for my kids.  I like it but it still lacks something that'll make it seem like the ones I get in a Japanese restaurant.  Still a nice taste and super easy to put together.  Just make sure to get the sushi rolling mat...it makes all the difference in making a tight and even roll.

I'm in HEAVEN!!! Amazing and super simple! Never made these before so I wasn't very good using the bamboo mat. It was easier to roll with my fingers but I only spent a dollar for the mat on Ebay so if you have to have a mat, look there. In addition; I pushed my rice down tight onto the nori with the back of the rice spoon and I think that made it easier to roll. Also, if you use imitation crab meat, get the long pieces. You can unroll them and put them on the rice then put the other goodies on that and roll it all together. Makes for a nice presentation when you cut it too. I didn't bother with making the sauce as I prefer to just put pickled ginger, wasabi and soy on my sushi so that saved some time.  

If I were to have went to the grocery store(mine has pre-made sushi)and bought the equivalent to what I made I would have easily spent over $50.00!  All I had to buy to make about 50 pieces was a cucumber, nori, small bag of rice, an avocado, small bag of carrots, a block of cream cheese and a $2.50 bag of imitation crab meat. (I don't follow recipes so I used more then 4 sheets of nori etc.)

I absolutely love this recipe! I added matchstick carrots for color and extra crunch. I used Kikoman's Ponzu Sauce as a dip, just awesome! Way better Sushi than my local grocery store!

It looks great! I left out the vinegar and sugar (too sweet), the cheapest rice is the best, because it is stickier.

I had no bamboo mat so I just rolled these using squares of wax paper. Just make sure the rice isn't so hot it weakens the wax paper. I'd drop my rice on it, fold the wax paper over the rice and press it out in seconds. If the shape wasn't right it was was easy to cut off, move the rice and repress. Fold the wax paper close to the rice to make a straight edge. After I rolled it up tightly I pinched the ends tightly together and chilled in the fridge for an hour or more before cutting.

I was just looking for a good basic rice recipe and this worked  well.  There was good flavor, not overpowering at all.   The only problem I had was that the  bottom layer burnt to the pan.  That could have been user error though.

I LOVED this recipe! I made it for a bunch of vegetarians, so I didn't use the crabmeat and I added carrot and radishes. Yum! Pickled ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi for dipping are musts!

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make and it tastes like it comes from a sushi bar. I moved to a small town from a large city, and sushi is not available to me now. So, this recipe is a godsend. If I would have known that I could make sushi of this quality when I lived in the city, I would have saved a lot of money! :)

The tip for using tea towel to roll was perfect...saved $. I like mine spicy and added mayo and chili oil to taste(oriental section of supermarket) to the crab. EXCELLENT !! Wasabi and ginger on the side, please :) Thanks again!
