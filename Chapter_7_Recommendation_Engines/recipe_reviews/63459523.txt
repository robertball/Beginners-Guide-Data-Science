I changed this recipe a bit here's what I added or changed: 
Rum 1/2 cup, chocolate chips 1/4 cup, dried cranberries 1/4 cup, 2 teaspoons of almond extract and only 1 teaspoon of vanilla, I toasted the cacao nibs a bit to take out the bitterness...  Oh I made it with 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of 1 and I used 2 1/2 chia seed eggs.
