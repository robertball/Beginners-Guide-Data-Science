I normally try hard to adhere to a recipe as it's written when trying it the first time. In this case however, I kept some of the reviews and my prior experience making this type of simple fudge in mind before proceeding, as I was concerned about wasting ingredients. The typical ratio of chips to milk with this type of fudge is 2.5 cups chips to 14 ounces of milk. That's what I have always used, and it's always worked out for me. I just could not see this setting up as written and many of the reviews confirmed that, therefore I used 2.5 cups chips. The end result was a firm but creamy textured fudge. I also chose dried tart cherries instead of candied, for more of a sweet/tart contrast and next time I would add a touch more almond extract.

I listened to the other reviews and added an extra half a bag of chocolate chips, so it wouldn't be too soft. Still turned out slightly softer than I like, will add whole bag next time. Tasted great, everyone loved it. Thanks!!!

Although this tastes really good, the texture of it is much too soft to be considered fudge. I followed the recipes word for word, and even after staying in the fridge all night, it stayed soft enough to be considered ice-cream topping, which is how I'm going to eat it.

Delicious and so easy! Following the comments of prior reviews I used 2 1/2 C of chips along with dried tart cherries.  I made several different fudges for my family and this one was the hands down favorite for everyone.

This tastes wonderful, but is pretty soft. It stays together, just a little gooey. I followed the recipe exactly, and I am not sure why it stayed so gooey. I froze the fudge after cutting, hopefully when I serve it, it won't be quite as messy.

Wonderfully delicious and rich with the cherries really enhancing the fudge! It was definitely a hit for Valentine's Day at the office! I made this exactly according to the recipe (forgot to check other reviews). It was definitely very soft but I didn't think it was too bad. However, I'd still adjust the recipe to use more chocolate or less condensed milk next time. I'd also try adding more almonds and maybe even more cherries. As I said, it tasted amazing but I found I could barely notice the almonds. The cherries really made it something special adding that fruity sweetness.

I liked it taste wise. My only suggestion would be to put in in a larger pan or to make sure  and pat dry the cherries that you put inside it. I'm going to try both next time cause it didn't fully set at the bottom where the cherries settled at. I'm also going to use parchment paper to line instead of foil cause I ended up covered in chocolate peeling off tiny bits of ripped foil. Over all I think the recipe is great it just needs tiny tweaks in execution to make it a little easier to manage.

This is the best fudge ....especially with the candied cherries with walnuts or pecans, instead of almonds.

Such a hit last year, making lots of extra this year.

Use the candied fruit like you use in fruit cake cookies or fruit cake.

Wonderful fudge recipe! The only change I made was using my stove instead of the microwave so that I could control the melting better but that's just personal preference!  The recipe was great as is and set up nicely for me!

This tasted good but didn't look as nice as I would have wanted (I was making this to give to friends). I followed the advice of reviewers to use 2 bags of chips and it was a little too firm for my preference. I will try 1 1/2 bags next time. 

Unfortunately I ended up w/ a few tiny pools of fat that turned white when I put the fudge in the refrigerator. After 1.5 minutes, the chips had not melted so I put it in for another 30 seconds. Not sure if I over microwaved it or what but it was clumpy and cooled quickly before I could smooth it into the pan. So the texture was rough looking.

I used pecans ( a lot of pecans) and no cherries. It was so good and so very easy. I lined my pan with parchment paper cause aluminum foil sticks to it real bad.

This is really really good.  Like many others, I made my own changes.  We don't like pure semi-sweet, so I used part of a bag of regular chips and a bag of white chips.  I also put in about a quarter cup of butter, and used crushed mints instead of the cherries and almonds.  It is incredibly smooth and tasty, but like others have mentioned, soft.  I think the next time, and there will be a next time, I will add a bit of powdered sugar to the mix to firm it up a bit.  I highly recommend this if you like rich, yummy fudge.

Made this fudge with a couple changes as per other reviews. I used tart dried cherries and 2 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. This is a quick and easy recipe to follow and the taste is wonderful. My husband loves it. Will definitely make this again and again.

Followed the recommendations of others by increasing the amount of chocolate chips which gave a great consistency. Will add more almond extract next time too. Plan to try with dried cherries but it was a very pretty fudge. It was snatched up quickly by the team I work with in the OR.

I tried using more almond extract as it asked for and I think it wasn't too sweet.  I would use the exact amount or just a little less.  Also, it was a little chewy, not like regular fudge.  I would recommend putting more chocolate chips than it says.  Another 6oz of chocolate chips would probably make it a little harder.  Other than those two isssues, the fudge tasted great after is chilled completely.  I added an extra ingredient, mini marshmallows, and it was a good idea.  Another tweak I made was adding the cherries inside the mix as well as the top like the recipe says.   I would definitely make these again, but it isn't gonna help you win a bake of contest unless you can find the right proportions of ofningredient and decorate it on the top a little.

After reading the reviews, I decided to increase the chocolate chips from 2 cups to 2 1/2 cups.  After all, there is no such thing as too much chocolate.  We didn't have any almond extract on hand (my oversight), but the fudge was still good.  Next time, I will put the almond extract in as soon as it comes out of the microwave.  Another suggestion was to use dried cherries.  I really liked them in the fudge.  I topped some of the pieces with pecan halves and some with candied cherries.  Next time I will put the pecan halves / cherries on top before I chill the fudge.  This fudge was easy to make.  I will make it again.

12/15/2016 -- I did make it again, only this time, used 2 1/2 cups chocolate chips, 1 can of condensed milk and 1/2 cup crushed candy canes.  I thought about putting mint extract in it, but decided not to.  After putting it in the pan, I sprinkled more crushed candy canes on top.  I took it to a pot luck lunch and got good reviews.  I tried to crush the candy canes with rolling pin . . . that didn't work very well, so I put them in the food processor.  That worked.
