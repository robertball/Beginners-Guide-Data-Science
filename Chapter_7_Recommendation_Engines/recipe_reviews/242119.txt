I personally did not like the  taste the cinnamon gave it and it's very time consuming having to turn it every 30 minutes for four hours. I wonder if you could just sear it on both sides then put it in crockpot? I also put in some butter when I put in veggies for a little richness and I thickened the juices a bit with cornstarch as mine was very soup like and I wanted a sort of gravy.
