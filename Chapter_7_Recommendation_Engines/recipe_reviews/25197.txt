I have had this recipe in my collection for years, and have made it a million times.  My family loves it.  Here are a few tips to cut the prep time:  Oven bake the meatballs at 350 degrees for 20 minutes on a foil lined broiler pan.  The fat melts off, and the meatballs stay firm, instead of crumbling apart.  Cuts down on calories and fat, and improves the taste.  Also, when making the sauce, just dump all the ingredients in a saucepan at the same time, and whisk the heck out of it.  No lumps, and cuts down on dishes.  Enjoy!  We love this recipe!

The only thing that I do differently after having been making this recipe for several years is that instead of cooking the meatballs on the stove, I put them on a cookie sheet and cook them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Much less messy, and faster too.  I can cook the meatballs in the oven while I do the sauce on the stovetop.  Plus, my meatballs never fall apart this way!

I make this alot. It is a BETTY CROCKER ORIGINAL.... It is highly requested for parties I attend. I cook the meatballs in the oven 350 for 20 min, then double the sauce and mix it all in the crockpot. Keep on low, and stir occasionally.

A big hit!  I made a few changes and used fresh bread crumbs instead of crackers and some cilantro for the meatballs.  I used less sugar for the sauce and red peppers instead of green. No leftovers!

These were delicious.  I made some changes:  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, I used reduced-fat ritz crackers instead of saltines, like some other people, I baked mine in a 350F oven for 20 mins then I added them to the sauce, I added 1/2 of a red pepper and more green pepper, I used fresh ginger instead of ground, and all I had was a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks so I used almost all of that.  I also cut down a tiny bit on the sugar.  Everyone loved them...I served them over brown rice.  Thanks!

First of all, we added coarsely chopped onion, red pepper, yellow pepper, green pepper, and a sliced carrot.  Then we just used 1lb of ground pork for the balls.  We used bread crumbs instead of crackers and we used fresh grated ginger instead of the powdered.  The meatballs were great.  Our sauce turned out a little bland although we still had plenty of sauce with the additions.  Next time we will do everything the same, except add extra soy sauce and some red pepper flake to kick it up.

My family loves this with chicken (cubed or whole boneless skinless breasts), ground turkey, TVP, and my hubby likes it with ground beef :)  To the sauce I add red pepper, green onions, garlic powder, ginger, use 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of vinegar, 1/4 cup br. sugar & 2 tbsp honey.  And it was awesome just as it was written as well!

I really liked these.  I did bake them like other reviewers suggested on 350 for about 20 minutes, then broiled them to get just a little more color on top.  I also used fresh ginger that I grated instead of ground ginger.  Hubby said that the meatballs were delicious, but the sauce was only o.k.  I loved the sauce.  Was a little afraid that it would be too sweet after reading some of the reviews, but I guess we like sweet.  I will definately make again, very easy.  Thanks for the post.

Easy, but only 4 stars for taste.  The sauce was tangy and sweet, but the meatballs were fairly bland.  The ginger added a nice dimension but was not enough to save the meatballs from mediocrity.

This recipie turned out good, the kids liked it, I found it a little bland.  I added a bit of hot pepper flakes towards the end of cooking to balance the sweet flavour.  I also used brown sugar sweetner, so it might have been that I should have used less.

These meatballs were pretty mild tasting. They were O.K. but they needed something extra to spice them up a bit.

Love this recipe!  We usually julienne the onion into bigger pieces that stick out of the meatball that way they get fried a little when cooking and taste oh soo good.  Also we usually cook the meatballs in one pan and do the sauce with pineapple and green separate.  It makes it easier to reheat the left overs.

This is a terrific appetizer but I changed it by using frozen meatballs & I use red and yellow peppers. I also cook the meatballs & sauce in a slow cooker for 3-4 hours and everyone loves them.

i made this for a company christmas party. it was a big hit! i leave out the vinegar and use more pineapple juice & soy sauce. it is my favorite meal my mom always made it when i lived at home. she used to mince the bell pepper and include it with the meatballs which adds more flavor to the meat. anyway, big hit!

This was so good, my husband loves sweet and sour and really liked these meatball. I will put them in the oven next time as some people have said, sounds a lot less messy. I did not have enough sauce for the rice so I ended up adding a can of beefy mushroom soup, gave me much more sauce for the rice and added even more flavor. I frooze the left overs for another meal, since there is just the two of us. Just need to make the rice for the left overs, how easy is that

So good!  I, too, baked the meatballs and used onion powder instead of minced onion.  I added some red pepper flakes to the meatball mixture.  My son loved it!

I was disappointed with this...it looked so good. I probably messed something up when makng it, b/c my meatballs all fell apart in the skillet so it was a crumbly beef mixture. My hubby thought it was edible, but I did not.;o)

Absolutely Delicious!!  My husband and daughters are very picky eaters and they LOVED it!!  The only change I made was using a red bell pepper instead of a green pepper.  Everything else in the recipe I kept exactly the same.  This is definitely a new family favorite...and sooo easy to make!!  :)

I took the advice of others and baked the meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes. I let the sauce simmer in the meantime, with the green pepper included (we like it more cooked than raw).  We loved the flavor of the meatballs with the sauce. We like pineapple, but all agreed that the chunks were a little bit overwhelming...next time I will try tidbits.

I thaught this recepie was great.  It had lots of flavor contrary to some reviews.  I followed the suggestions of others and baked the meatballs in the oven on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  The only change I made was I cooked the sauce in a saucepan, added the peppers and pineapple at the last few mins to get warm...I placed the meatballs in a glass bakingdish and poured the sauce mixture ontop and baked at 350 for 30mins turning once.  They ended up AWESOME!!!  Tastey all the way through..mmmmm.

OK, so I haven't made the meatballs before, but I have made the sauce multiple times paired with frozen store-bought meatballs and it is wonderful!  An excellent balance between sweet and sour and I love the pineapple and peppers!

Made it for New Year's Eve Party and it was gone in less than 30 minutes.  So easy and very good.  I did cut back on the sugar to 1/3 Cup instead of the 1/2 cup.

These meatballs were really good! My 7-year-old daughter loved them. However, she didn't care for the sauce, so I left some meatballs out of the sauce just for her. I cooked them on a foil-lined, sprayed cookie sheet in the oven rather than on the stove (at 350 F for about 30 minutes - I had made them pretty large).

I cut this down to 4 servings so I could use 1 pound of meat (we don't eat ground beef, so I used ground turkey instead), but I used the full amount of sauce ingredients.  I worried about the sauce being too sweet, so I cut back on the brown sugar and I was glad I did.  After frying the meatballs, I sauteed the bell pepper for a few minutes so it would be a little more tender, then I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup of chicken broth before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I served it over white rice cooked in chicken broth.  Overall, it was pretty good with less brown sugar, but the meatballs do need a bit more seasoning.  I'll make these again, but I'll add some salt and pepper to the meatballs and definitely add more bell pepper.

Great sauce.  The meatballs were like your average meatballs - but they were moist.  The sauce would be great on pork in my opinion.

These were very good.  I'm not sure I'm crazy about the ginger flavor of the meatballs, and I even used 2 lbs of hamburger and did not increase the ginger.  I cooked the meatballs in the oven at 400 for about 1/2 hr.  I also cooked the green pepper before adding to the sauce as I don't like raw green peppers.  I doubled the sauce and it came out fine even though I wasn't sure about the amounts since I could only find the pineapple in 20oz cans instead of 15oz cans.  A little sweet but we didn't mind that.

I made these last minute because someone onte Buzz got me thinking about meatballs and this recipe at 4:00pm, lol   I found the sauce just a bit sweet for my taste so I added about 2 more tsp. of soya sauce and a dash of worchestshire sauce. I also used dark brown sugar because I prefer it for a savory sauce.  That is completely personal taste though.  It was a really nice thick sauce.

Yummy, used ground turkey instead of beef and it turned out great. I would recommend oven baking the meatballs and if you're using the ingredients as shiskabobs you may need to double the peppers.

This was a quick & easy hit with guests. I made this along with other appetizers for a Holiday open-house for family and friends. I kept it warm in a slow cooker and had my rice cooker next to it for any party-hoppers that wanted something more substantial. I will make this again and again.

This is a great family pleaser.  I have been cooking this for over 20 years.  IT is requested quite often by my family.  I have tried it with ground turkey as well and served over brown rice to make it a little healthier.

I totally cheated and used a bag of trader joes turkey meatballs and I still think this is a 5 star recipe.  I just added some fresh Ginger to the sauce since it isn't in the meatballs.  I also used an entire green pepper.  Next time I would reduce the sugar some, it was a little too sweet for us.

I have been making this dish for 30 years!  It was the first cookbook I bought when I got married.  My family loves this dish.  Probably one of their all time requested meals.  I serve it over rice and also add carrots with the peppers.  YUM!!

This was a FANTASTIC recipe!  I followed other reader's suggestions and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes and then broiled a few minutes longer to make them crispier.  I do think I will double the sauce recipe next time as there didn't seem to be enough!  I may also play around with spices for the meatballs just for variation (thought they're fine as is).  Another suggestion I would add is to use more green pepper.  I didn't think 1/3 cup was enough!  Overall-Very tasty and very simple!

These were really good and very simple to make.  The sauce is EXTREMELY sweet, so next time I would cut the sugar in half at least.  The meatballs are just begging for some garlic, so I added some to the meat mixture.  I used a tube of ginger paste rather than ground ginger. Fresh ginger would be awesome as well.  I also baked my meatballs for 15 minutes at 375 degrees rather than pan fry them.  Quick, easy, and less messy.  Really enjoyed this with rice, thanks!

If you like sweet and sour sauce and if you like meatballs, you're gonna like this.  I didn't want my peppers to get mushy, so I sautéed just until slightly tender the bell peppers (used mixed colors to enhance appearance) and added some slices of vertically-cut onion in a skillet sprayed with olive oil.  Then I added the meatballs and pineapple chunks to the skillet along with the sweet-sour sauce and heated all together.  You easily could make a big of these meatballs, bake them at 350 until done (about 20 minutes or so), cool, toss into a zip-lock bag, and freeze.  Then all you'd have to do for a quick & delicious weekday meal is saute the veggies and make the sauce (which takes no time at all) and add the meatballs.  Delicious and going into my Favorites folder.****UPDATE:  2.20.19  Had a beautiful, perfectly ripe and sweet pineapple in the fridge, and this recipe was calling my name for dinner.  My day  was dedicated to yard work, so instead of making the  recipe’s meatballs, I used a bag of frozen Casual Gourmet Hawaiian Chicken Meatballs with Pineapple, threw in lots of multi-color bell pepper slices, onion slices, pineapple chunks, and snow peas for a little crunch.  This recipe never disappoints.

This was quite delicious until I put them in the crockpot to keep warm!  Don't do that!  The steam waters it down.  Bummer for my dinner.  Wish I had stuck with keeping it in the pan.

This is a fave recipe in our family. I've made it as written and also modified it to make it Paleo-friendly. To do that, I used cooked ground beef mixed with the sauce (with aminos instead of soy sauce) and serve it lettuce-cup style using butter lettuce. You do have to chop the pineapple and other ingredients a bit smaller to make it easier to eat. It's a good meal and also makes a good appetizer.

Delicious. browned in pan then moved to slow cooker. Flavor was great and meatballs were "melt in your mouth", however sauce did not thicken in slow cooker so had to put it in sauce pan to thicken. Next time I will make sauce in pan 'till thick then move it to slow cooker with meatballs.

I am constantly being asked for this recipe, I am so glad I found it online now I can just e-mail a copy to all my friends.  The only thing I changed is that I use frozen ready made meatballs.  You can use turkey or beef just defrost them in the microwave for 3 minutes before adding to the sauce.  This becomes a ridiculoulsly easy and fast party appetizer, or add over rice for a main dish.

Love this recipe. If you use pineapple in syrup it is too sweet, but is great if you omit the sugar, otherwise use pineapple in pineapple juice. I could have this every night. Over rice is a good way to enjoy them.

My grandmother used to make these - they are my favourite!  The only difference was that I have never added the green peppers ... will have to the next time I make them.  In our family, we like the sauce over rice so I always double it.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I tweek it a little and add 1 .5 cup julienned carrots and serve it over white rice.  With the yellow pineapple, orange carrots, green bell peppers, brown meatballs and white rice it has a great presentation.

These were delicious after a little bit of tweaking.  I don't think I've ever made meatballs without some garlic, so I felt the need to add one large clove of minced along with a teaspoon of soy sauce, replacing the 1/2 teaspoon of salt, in the meat mixture.  I also upped the amount of peppers used in the sauce and par-cooked them along with some chopped onion.  I baked the meatballs instead of frying (350° for 22 minutes, flipping them halfway through the baking). Served over white rice.  Next time I think I'll double the sauce.

I thought this was OK.  It reminded me of church potlucks and grandma's party food.  My husband didn't like the sauce at all.  He took his plate to the sink and rinsed the sauce off of his meatballs.  I might use the meatball recipe again, but use a different sauce, BBQ perhaps.

This is actually an old recipe given to me by a friend of mine.  When you get to the sauce, sometimes it comes out a little thick after cooking. Unless you happen to have pineapple juice on hand, add about 1/4-1/2 C of orange juice to thin the sauce.  Excellent!  You can also substitute leaner beef and/or mix with ground turkey for a healthy alternative.

This has been a regular family recipe since I can remember.  We use bread crumbs instead of crackers and double the sauce.  I tried baking the meatballs as others suggested, but prefer the flavor of pan seared meatballs (without the oil), though you need to be attentive, regularly turning them in the pan.

I really liked the sauce but the meatballs were heavy and had very little flavor.

This was surprisingly good!  I made two batches and froze one for later.  I just dumped it into a large saucepan with a lid and heated it up.  Turned out great!  My 8 yr old helped me roll the meatballs and was very proud of her success.

This is from Betty Crocker's Red cookbook and we grew up eating it.  And loving it!  I usually double the sauce and use whatever citrus juice I have on hand to make up the difference.  For some extra veggies I toss in matchstick carrots too.

This was very good and my husband really loved it. I did bake my meatballs instead of frying. I only had a yellow bell pepper, but next time will make with red and green. Served over white rice.

I used frozen meatballs instead of the recipe given. I also added red pepper flakes per someone elses suggestion and I added fresh ginger. This was so sweet we can not eat it. I did everything else according to the directions and it just simply is way to sweet. If I had used 1/4 of the sugar we may had liked it but I seriously doubt I will ever make it again. :(

For the meatballs, I only used 1 tsp. ground ginger, and that was plenty for us, I grated the onion which made the meatballs more moist in my opinion. I, like other reviewers baked mine at 350 for 20 min. only because I wanted to use my toaster oven. I did saute the bell pepper and pineapple, on med/high just to brown slightly, for an added flavor. I used rice wine vinegar instead of white keeping with the asian profile. I also felt the 2 tbsp. of cornstarch was too much, making the sauce too thick so I added water to thin it out, I also added a little chicken base for added flavor. Next time I will start with one tbsp. of cornstarch and go from there. Very good recipe, thanks for posting CMAYBELL :)

Wow, this was really good!  I made the meatballs and sauce early in the afternoon, baking the meatballs for 20 minutes at 350.  I set out to make half the recipe, but I wanted to add more peppers and some onion and realized I wasn’t going to have enough sauce for all of that.  So, I had to improvise a little and made half the meatballs but a full recipe of the sauce.  I drained an 8 oz. can of pineapple tidbits and realized that I needed more liquid, so I added an equal amount of orange juice.   I cut the brown sugar in half and it was still plenty sweet.  I wanted my peppers and onions cooked to crisp tender, rather than just “heated through” so I sautéed them in a little olive oil first and then added the sauce and meatballs.  I simmered that covered for a few minutes and then added the pineapple to heat through.  I served this over jasmine rice and it was excellent!  Both Hubs and I were very impressed.  I used a mix of red, yellow, orange and green bell peppers, which resulted in a very colorful, delicious dish.

Very Very good! Meatballs were awesome, I cooked them low and slow in my deep skillet. I would suggest however to cut the brown sugar from a 1/2 Cup to a 1/4 Cup...it was just a bit sweet with the pinapple juice and pinapple chuncks. I served these with Orange Rice Medley and Sesame Broccoli (all recipes from this site). An asian flavored dinner without paying for take out. 

I would also like to mention this dish did take a bit more prep time than noted in the recipe...if you are in a hurry I would use a slow cooker or prep your veggies ahead of time.

Tasty and easy for weeknight cooking.  Just add it to some white rice and you've got a meal right there.  I followed the recipe this time but in the future, I might switch up the vegetables.  My 4-year-old daughter and husband both enjoyed it so it's a keeper!

I enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  Just kicked up the sauce and meatballs with a little hot sauce.  I baked the meatballs as others did rather than putting them in a pan.  I served them over rice.  I think the hot sauce is necessary to balance out the sweetness.

I was short on time so I used frozen Italian meatballs and this recipe still was wonderful.  I used brown rice instead of white rice, too.  Next time I will add strips of onion and give the recipes meatballs a try.  Will make this one a regular for my family.  Great. Maxine

Great recipe.. I just made a few changes: I used ground turkey instead of beef, I like to watch my sodium intake so I used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted top crakers. This made the recipe very good for people with high blood pressure. I also used Splenda brown sugar which made it low in calories. I will be making this again soon!

Love this recipe.  I used ground pork and onion powder in the meatballs and added chunks of onion with the bells and pineapple chunks.  I also added more ginger and soy sauce to the sauce and everyone loved it.

I didn't think the vinegar was too much at all, as I've read in other reviews. I used rice vinegar and a few shakes of red wine vinegar and it worked beautifully. I'm gluten intolerant, so a piece of tapioca bread ground up finely in the mini chopper easily replaced the saltines. Big chunks of sweet onion were a nice addition to the sauce, and the possibilities are endless as to what could be added (bamboo shoots, carrots, celery, etc.). Great recipe – thanks for sharing!

These are delicious, quick, and easy. I used a little extra pineapple juice and soy - but was quite sloppy with my ingredients so this recipe is very forgiving and still turned out great. Meatball fans will love this.

My mother in law forwarded this recipe.  Apparently she used to make it for my husband when he was little.  It had the added benefit of requiring everything we already had that needed used up.  So *I* give it 5 stars for that alone.  :) DH said it was tasty and I should "add it to the rotation!"  Even our 3 year old and 10 month old ate two portions.

This is something we've made in our family for years.  Not sure where my mother got the recipe, but was very happy to see it here so I can stop writing it out all the time, and instead just print it!  It is always a hit, seems I can never make enough.  Great in a crock pot for an appetizer, or over white rice as a dinner.

With the recipe followed as written, it's delicious! However, baking the meatballs instead of frying them is easier - the grease self-drains and I don't have to worry about squishing/breaking my meatballs while turning them. (20 minutes @ 350 degrees)

I have to give this a five because my husband LOVED these.  The sauce thickened up perfectly.  We omitted the pineapple chunks at the end and added more peppers (we love peppers in everything) and followed everyhting else.  We used venicin, since my husband loves to hunt, and they did not taste gamey at all.  I will def make again for him.  We made white rice and poured over for a waikiki meal.

too much pineapple IMO. and i love pineapple. yes, the meatballs need to be kicked up a notch, bit bland. I used chopped onions instead of minced. I also baked my meatballs ahead of time. I also used sauteed red and orange peppers.

This is deelish, the clan really liked it, even the picky one. Only changes made--due to preference--meatballs were ground chix and pork, used 2 red bells and 1 green, doubled sauce with a tad more Bragg's Amino Acids (we use that instead of soy sauce) and added a purple onion. Wow! Was very pretty on a bed rice. I will be making this again, idk why i waited so long!  ;O)

I frequently make this dish for dinner. It is a favorite for both myself and my husband. I feel I must finally give it a review.
The only change I make is baking the meatballs. I've never actually tried to cook the meatballs in the skillet. It's just so easy to just stick them in the oven.
Wonderful flavors!

I am going to rate the sauce, because I used my own recipe for the meatballs. It was excellent! I used half the amount of sugar suggested, 1 whole bell pepper and half regular vinegar / half balsamic. Thanks for a new stapler!

Sauce tasted watery sweet. If that makes sense. The meatballs were a bit bland. Strong taste of the ginger in the meatballs and that was it. No making this again. Its so nasty, and my husband and I are SO AGAINST wasting food but were throwing the pot full of this in the trash. I made 20 meatballs with this recipe and my husband and I had 2 meatballs each because we were so hungry. The rest of it is going in the garbage. Its the worst meatballs weve ever had! Im having a bowl of cereal now for dinner because I cant eat these meatballs! Im from Hawaii and its a disgrace to calls this recipe Waikiki Meatballs! My 3 year old said it was nasty! So disappointed!

A little too much ginger, and next time I will try baking the meatballs since they fell apart in the pan.  Otherwise, very very good.

My husband and son loved this meal.  I used ground turkey and I cooked the sauce separately in a pot and then poured it over the meatballs to serve.  I think keeping it separated is better for the left overs.  It reminds us of sweet & sour chicken at a Chinese restaurant!

I thought this was really good.  I followed the recipe pretty close.  I used a whole 20oz can of pineapple IN JUICE NOT SYRUP...i think some people used the ones that are in heavy syrup and that is why it was too sweet.  I also used rice vinegar in place of white.  I also used italian bread crumbs in place of the crackers and added garlic the the meat mixture.  I also added big chunks of onion as well.  Next time I think I will add some asian hot chili paste to the meat balls before cooking.  I served this with fried rice from this site.  I also cooked these in the oven. Great meal! Thanks

I think this was pretty good, but i think the sauce was too sweet.  it needs less sugar.  also, the sauce does need to be doubled to make enough for the meatballs.  i would suggest adding more seasonings to the meatballs.  mine tasted more like meatloaf than meatballs.  next time i will add more ginger, maybe a little cumin and parlsey.

Delicious.  My four kids loved it.  I followed all the directions except I added only 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1/3 cup vineagar and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  It tasted great and was not too sweet.  I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers:  I baked the meatballs in the oven (350 F for 30 minutes) and made the sauce directly in a sauce pan.  I served it with rice and steamed vegetables.  I will be adding this to my regulars.

Like other reviewers, I made some changes.  I did bake them in a 350 degree oven for 25 mins, made the sauce on the stovetop and placed it all in a crockpot for simmering.  I'm not a huge fan of "sweet" food, so I omitted the pineapples in the simmering process.  I doubled the sauce (except for the brown sugar- only added 1/4c.).  I added sliced carrots, 3 cloves of fresh sliced garlic and coarsely chopped onions to the sauce.  I served it over brown rice and had fresh steamed green beans as a side item.  My husband and 2 year old daughter loved it!  I liked the meatball part of this recipe again, but not the sauce.  I will make my own sauce or use someone else's sauce recipe from this site.

My mom used to make these in the 70's and I loved them.  I was going to a tiki pot-luck recently and so I looked them up and found the recipe on here (it is originally from an old Betty Crocker recipe card I think).  I have made these 3 times in the last 2 months because they are so delicious and easy to make.  I was running short on time once, so I bought the frozen mini party meatballs at Trader Joe's, and it was equally as good (and much easier) that way.

I have used this recipe for a long time.. I love it.  The sauce is also good with chicken.  I like to cut it into chunks.

Fantastic! I love sweet and sour and this was really good for what it is. A really quick meal to put together, I had this done by the time the rice was finished. This uses ingredients readily available in my pantry. I didn't have green pepper. I made the sauce separpately then poured it over the meatballs after it thickened. The only thing I changed was to add a sprinkle of chow mein noodles over this for crunch. Awesome dish! This would be great for a busy weeknight as it is quick and easy. Thanks Cathy, I really enjoyed this dish!

This was pretty tasty! I have never thought to use ginger in meatballs before, and it added a really nice flavour. Will use it every time I do s+s meatballs from now on. Tried baking them, and that also turned out nicely. The sauce itself left a bit to be desired; I think I will keep using my regular sauce recipe. This was quite a lovely recipe! Thanks for sharing!

So easy!!!!  I used frozen turkey meatballs instead of making my own and had this on the table in under 25 minutes.  Otherwise the only change I made was I omitted the green pepper (not a fan of peppers) and used broccoli instead.  This is a new family favorite!

I used ground turkey and extra ginger and this was fabulous. I would make smaller meatballs next time, bite-sized. This is a "keeper" recipe for me.

Everyone at my Bunco party enjoyed these. I left out the salt and used slightly less than the brown sugar called for. I made these mini, then put five to a bamboo skewer and served them in a chafing dish. I also loved the tip from two reviewers about baking the meatballs rather than frying them. I'll do that from now on! Wonderful suggestion. Thanks.

Tasted pretty good, but I think next time I'd increase the quantity of crackers and perhaps fry the meatballs longer before adding the sauce.

These are always a hit! I make a few changes to add color and more veggies. Like red and green pepper and onion . and i always double the sauce. My family askes for these for every gathering! Also i have made with a pork and beef mixture adds more flavor.

I was in a hurry to cook this in less than 3 hours, and I did, and it was great! It will be even better day 2. I modified the recipe by using 1/2 ground beef & 1/2 pork (this saves us $$). I baked the meatballs at 350-degrees for 1/2 hour. I did a quick dump of all the other ingredients into a crock pot and let it cook for 3 hours. I did boil the green peppers quickly so as to soften them up a bit (again, I was in a hurry) and added them and the meatballs on top in crock pot, stirring every so often. Three hours later (during the football game) served it with rice and everyone enjoyed. 

Day 2 I am adding in a bunch of chopped, dried chili peppers to add some "hot" to it, and the color will be great too. Thanks!

Pretty good..left out the ginger and doubled the sauce. Next time will probably use less sugar but triple the sauce. I also added red and green bell peppers with onions.  All in all I will make again. Its also good with added pepper flakes .

I've been making this recipe for over 30 years.

Well, I don't do a lot differently after all these years, but I do add water chestnuts to the veggiesand a heaping tablespoon of garlic-chili paste to the sauce for a little "kick."  I recommend that, honestly, it's a great addition and doesn't majorly interfere with the "intended" effect.

This was not a good recipe. The meatballs turned out mushy. I LOVE the idea of meatballs in a sweet teriyaki-like sauce but this is not the one you want. The ginger and milk just ruined any chance of good flavor. I should have know better. Next time I will make my own meatball recipe and put them in a different sauce as this recipe didn't make nearly enough sauce. Just very disappointing.

Used the oven cooking method. But cooked for 23/25 minutes just to make sure they were cooked. Make your meatballs small. I think I'm gonna add snow peas next time maybe carrots.

I've been making this for years at all potlucks I attend. I do make some altercations. I use turkey instead of meat, and ground onion instead of minced. I also use plain bread crumbs instead of crackers. and I let it sit in a crock pot on simmer to stay warm and people just grab them with toothpicks.

I substituted Johnsonville reduced fat pork & chicken Italian sausage  for the ground beef and these were INCREDIBLE!  The spices in the sausage add an extra layer of savory to the sweet sauce and my family absolutely loved it.  I won't make it any other way now!  Try it, it's fantastic!

I followed this recipes pretty close, but used fresh ginger and assorted peppers.  It was alright. The sauce had a strong flavor and the meatballs were a little bland.  My step son loved it (but he's a teenager and they'll pretty much eat anything!), I thought it was alright.  I may make it again.  Wasn't awesome.

I've been making this exact recipe for years, found it in an old church cook book. Fabulously good polynesian dish that is easy to make and tastes great as left overs. Make a large batch and keep in slow cooker for parties or buffet.

Everyone really enjoyed these meatballs.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Next time I'd rather use ground turkey and bread crumbs.  The meatballs needed more flavor - maybe try adding some oregano and garlic powder?

This was excellent! The only change I made was using oyster crackers instead of saltines. I realized that I had red and orange peppers in the house, but not green, and went with that. It added more color and flavor anyway. I went with white wine vinegar, instead of regular white, as I find it less strong and low-sodium soy sauce. For the beef I used 93% lean and it worked great. I was worried the sauce would have flavor but the meatballs wouldn't blend in well, but with the added ginger, they blend perfectly. I did use scant spoonfuls of the ginger, as I didn't want an overwhelming ginger taste, and it seemed to be the right amount. I served it with some lightly buttered rice. Delicious!

Surprisingly sweet and irresistible! They store well as leftovers too, if you are lucky enough to have any. Although, the tend to fall apart; better to bake em in the oven

This recipe is awesome! My kids love it. I will make this again and again, I made a double batch of the sauce because my husband likes a lot of juice. Although I did take advice from some of the others and cut the sugar down by half, and added two heaping tablespoons of apricot preserves, delicious: o)

I love sweet food, but this was entirely too sweet. The underlying flavors were very promising, but next time I'm cutting the brown sugar in half.

loved this. soooo easy to do when you use boxed meatballs and a flavourwave. dinner is ready in 25 minutes.  no green peppers, used pineapple tidbits and dumped it all into a saucepan, boiled it and added the meatballs. couldn't be easier served over pasta.

This was an awesome recipe.  Like everyone else this one is going to be a keeper.  I also suggest cooking them in the oven vs over the stove.  In the oven is healthier and less messy.  It still tastes as great :)

They were wonderful!!  I made these last night.  Thinking I would only have five of us eating, I changed the recipe to serve 8.  Good thing I did.  As soon as my other kids found out what I was making, they stayed to try them.  Even my most pickiest eater, (9 year old), loved them.  Looks like this will be a weekly dish.

Delicious!  I used the pineapple tidbits instead of chunks.  What a great summer-time supper with basmati rice and a side of fresh green beans.  Very easy to make, didn't have any problem with the meatballs falling apart at all.

Yummy, used frozen meatballs to cut down on prep time. I liked the sweet and sourness. I did add a diced onion with the pineapple and green pepper. I made these in the slow cooker I think next time I will add the pineapple at the end, it was very mushy.

Great recipe.  It was delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.  The only change I had was that my pineapple was a 20 oz. can.  I used all the juice, but not quite all the pineapple.  It was so good.  Thanks for sharing!

Key is the ginger in the meatballs.  I used the slow cooker since it was an open house and it turned out great but the sauce would have been even better if I followed the recipe to a T!

Yummy! I used premade meatballs from Ikea. Blended together sauce ingredients into a large pot over med. heat. I didn't have enough brown sugar, so added some white. I added about 2 more Tbsp. of soy sauce and left out the green peppers. I also used crushed pineapple which was very good! Everyone loved it!

This was surprisingly easy and delicious!  I only used 1 lb of very lean hamburger and ommited the ginger (we both hate the taste of ginger).  I used a 20oz can of chunk pineapple and added broccoli, green, red & yellow bell peppers and also some green onions to the saute after the meatballs were done.  The sauce was devine just as written and I wouldn't change one thing about it.  I thought it would need more soy sauce but this was the perfect amount.  You won't be disappointed if you are looking for a good sweet & sour recipe.  I think this would be good with sauted chicken breasts also.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I don't eat hamburg, but I made these for my family and they absolutely loved them. Since discovering them about three weeks ago, they have asked for them (and I've made them) four times. I think I may try the "sauce" on chicken next time, since they can't stop raving about the taste of them.  A definite keeper!

Instead of making the meatballs by scratch I used some itallian meatballs i purchased from Sams Club. Instead of adding the ginger to the meat mix;  I added it to the broth. With the mixture of Italian seasonings, this actually came out better than expected. Even after making the meatballs from scratch, this actually tastes better.

I was looking to make something different with the ground beef I had to use, this was a nice change.  I decreased the amount of ginger, since my husband isn't too fond of the flavor, but I couldn't taste it and he didn't say anything about it, so next time I'll use the full amount.  I also baked the meatballs at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.  I used one 8 oz can of pineapple tidbits and the juice of one 8 oz can of crushed pineapple(that's what I had on hand).  Next time I would decrease the amount of brown sugar and double the sauce.  I also didn't use green peppers, since I didn't have any.

This was great and the kids loved it.  I will definately make it again.  I gave 4 stars because I added only 1/4c brown sugar and it was just sweet enough.  I added extra veggies and some fresh ginger to the sauce.  I also added a little chicken broth to stretch the sauce a bit.  Delish!

I made these for a Super Bowl party on Sunday...some people really liked them, but my boyfriend and I didn't like them at all.  The meatballs were very bland, and we were not a big fan of the sauce.   I won't be making these again.

These were awesome.  Pretty sweet but really good.  Made this for two but another two ended up stopping by and were so upset all they could have was one serving!!  Very good recipe.

I used breadcrumbs instead of crushed saltines, and added some garlic and ketchup to the meatballs.  As other reviewers suggested, I baked the meatballs for 20 minutes at 350 instead of frying them.  I changed the way the recipe was assembled a bit.  I made the sauce and set it aside.  Then I browned the green pepper and pineapple along with some onion wedges in a little oil.  When the vegetables were crisp/tender I added the sauce, let it thicken, then added the meatballs.  I thought the sauce tasted a bit harsh as written, and I didn't like the color, so I added a squirt or two of ketchup and some sweet chile sauce.  Served over rice, this made an adequate, filling, but not exactly spectacular meal.  Thanks for the post!

The meatballs were pretty good, but the sauce was too sweet! I had a 20oz can of pineapple and I used all the juice but only 3/4 of the pineapple and just 1/4 c brown sugar, (since other reviewers said it was too sweet). Maybe I should have used less juice. I think these would be good as appetizers, but in my opinion, they don't work as a meal. It tasted good at first (I served it over brown rice) but I couldn't quite finish my plate because it just got to be too sweet. Maybe it needs just the right side dish to balance out the sweet. I do like the ginger in the meatballs though! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My neighbor says she makes a very similar recipe that her family loves. She also told me that there is a difference between canned pineapples. Apparently there is pineapple canned in its own juice but there is also pineapple canned in a SWEETENED juice....who knew?? No idea which one I used, but maybe that is why some found it too sweet??

I am incredibly impressed with this great recipe! While making the meatballs, I took a cue from the Joy Of Cooking and mixed the ingredients together with my hand mixer and added just a little bit of water...made them fluffy! I also followed the suggestions of other reviewers by baking the meatballs as opposed to frying, and by adding a little ketchup to the sauce. My fiance loves this dish...looks like it will be going on our regular rotation from now on! Thanks for sharing, we appreciate it a lot. :-)

I made this for my husband this evening and he just loved it.  The only changes I made was to use flour instead of corn starch (simply because I was out of corn starch) and to bake the meatballs instead of frying them.  After they had baked, I drained them and added the sauce, peppers, & pineapple to them and baked for another 15 minutes.  Delicious served with a green salad and over white rice.

These were ok. They were the last things to disappear at my party. The meatballs themselves didn't have much flavor, but the sauce was pretty good. I think if I work with them a little more, it could be really good.

My mom has made this dish since I've been a kid -- ok, dating myself here, but she's been making them at LEAST 25-30 years and it is one of my absolute favorites.  I was really surprised to see this recipe here, but when I did, I felt compelled to review.  A side note: Ritz crackers work fine too if you don't have the saltines.  :)

Loved this recipe! I added extra pineapple juice -- an 8 oz can - and another half-tablespoon of corn starch, just to make extra sauce. Will try it with ground pork next time - my family (kids included) loved this one!

Boyfriend loved the meatballs! I used ground turkey, bread crumbs, 1 t. ground ginger, ~1/2 t. fresh ginger, and baked the 'balls as other suggested.  For the sauce I added a nice dose of chili flakes to balance out the sweetness. I then heated up a skillet and gave the 'balls a touch more browning before throwing into the pan with the sauce.  Served over boring white rice - next time I'll go for brown rice.  Yum!  The boyfriend suggests keeping the fat in the meatballs or using ground pork.

My mom used to make this for us when we were kids. I looked around for the recipe and this was almost exactly like mom used to make. She used less ginger and sugar, though. We also like to double the sauce and use apple cider vinegar. Very yummy!

This is the best meatball recipe that I have found.  It is SOOOOO easy!  I also use the sauce to make "sweet-n-sour pork", or "sweet-n-sour chicken".  It is so good, we have it at least twice a month (and we don't often repeat recipes in this house!)  Thanks Cathy!

The sauce was way too thick and way too sweet.  I added more vinegar to thin it but then the pinapple flavour I was looking for disappeared.  Will not make these again.

This recipe was very good.  I was looking for a sweet and sour recipe that didn't use ketchup as the base for the sauce.  This was great.  Would cut back a bit on the sugar next time as the pineapple juice is quite sweet added with the sugar.  Didn't have a green pepper so just used a white onion chopped up.  The sauce was a little thick after it was cooked so I just thinned with a little water and worked great.  Will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe!  My husband doesn't care too much for sweet and sour sauce, but he really likes this.  He doesn't like anything with Pinapples, so I keep in the juice but leave out the pinapple chunks, just so he doesn't see that it is in there.  He doesn't even notice!  I serve it on top of croissants.  It is soooo good.

Awesome recipe!  I'm using this one for a wedding reception for 300 in 2 weeks except we're using premade meatballs...and it's still marvelous.  We love these.  If you don't like green pepper, you may want to cut back on them by half.  The flavor is wonderful!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I used pre-packaged, plain meatballs and made the sauce in a crock-pot.  Wasn’t a big hit at my Christmas Party.  Don’t know if there was too much other food to pick from, or if people just didn’t like the way they tasted.  The sauce lost flavor to me after cooking in the crock-pot.  Didn’t have that “punch” I was looking for.

This was a wonderful recipe.  My son and daughter-in-law showed up the evening I was making it and they also loved it.  My 3 yr old grandson didn't like it, but he is very picky.  The only time consuming thing was making the meatballs themselves, but they should held together good!  The sauce was wonderful! I served it over noodles.

These meatballs were fantastic. I made them for a large group function and everyone loved them...including people who don't like pineapple. No flavor overpowers the other.

I've done this over and over when the kids were young (and still make today) and now they are making it for their kids. 
Great for cocktail parties. Make smaller meatballs and skewer with pineapple and red/green pepper. I've also used oats when I did have crackers. Also tried fruit cocktail with cherries instead of pineapple.

My mother made this in the 70-80s.  It turned out great! I used ground turkey I reduced the sugar by 1/4 and used Splenda brown sugar- I was surprised to find out I was all out of ground ginger- however I had frozen “cheat ginger “ from Trader Joe’s - I microwaved 3 cubes and threw it into the meat mixture.  I added 2 teaspoons of worcheshire sauce into the meatballs.

Excellent!  I'll definitely make this again.  Family loved it.  The one thing I'll do differently is to saute the green peppers a bit before making the sauce.

I read the reviews a bit before making and opted to add a tsp or so of soy sauce to the meatball mixture. I also omitted the ginger. I thought the meatballs were actually pretty good. I thought the sauce was good too, but I am not sure I liked the combination of meatballs and sauce. I might consider using diced chicken next time instead of meatballs as the sauce was a great "sweet and sour" sauce. I even considered using the meatball recipe for a more savory meatballs and rice combination (tomato based?). Either way, this is great weeknight meal if you bake the meatballs and refrigerate them until you are ready to warm them up. I warmed them up in my electric pressure cooker on saute and then threw in the sauce and cooked until heated through.

OK recipe.  I gave it four stars instead of five because the meatballs themselves were bland.  One ingredient change - cooked brown rice i/o crackers.  One  procedural change - I followed one reviewer's recommendation and baked the meatballs on a foil-lined broiler pan at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes.  Will make again and up the ground ginger next time.

I thought this was just okay, but my husband LOVED IT.  Said he could eat it 6 days a week.  I  parbaked the meatballs in the oven.  I then put them in the crockpot along with the sauce and cooked on low for several hours and then added the pineapple and red pepper (not green)  and cooked for a couple of hours.  I served it over white rice.

I've been making this exact recipe for years since before I lost my Betty Crocker cookbook. My only change is that a few years ago, I started to bake my meatballs instead of frying in the pan. Cover broiler pan with foil, spray with oil, place meatballs on foil and bake 30 min at 350. Then place warm meatballs in cooked sauce, pineapple and bell pepper.

My family has made this recipe for years, it has always been my fathers birthday dinner.  We have always used a roaster and cooked our meatballs in the oven, exactly how "My4NonBlondes" has said.  It is an amazing difference and the taste is phenomenal

Easy & delicious! I was in a rush, so I used frozen meatballs & cooked it on the stove instead of the crock pot. Since the prepared meatballs likely didn't have ginger, I added it to the sauce to keep the ginger flavor. I also like red peppers over green. My family really enjoyed the meal.

Great recipe. It makes 2 dozen meatballs. I tweaked it a little by using a tbsp. minced fresh ginger instead of ground.  Also, 1/3 cup green pepper seemed to me not enough, so I chopped half of one and also added an equal amount of chopped red pepper. I also added the rest of the onion, chopped.  Served over rice.

First of all, this recipe brought a huge smile to my face because my sister first made it for us in the '70s. I still make it on occasion, though it's a little sweet for my tastes these days. It's a great, easy recipe.

We started with powdered ginger, cooked a few in the microwave. We added fresh grated ginger, cooked some more and then we made the meatballs. They were nice and soft. Sauce Way Too Sweet!!! Will try 1/4 brown sugar next time. Had with rice, grandkids only at the meatballs- as we said way too sweet.

Although this sounds like a strange dish it is good! I baked the meatballs for 20 minutes at 350 and used breadcrumbs instead of saltines because that is all I had.  I doubled the sauce and added more bell pepper then served over rice. Yummy.

I don't want to rate this recipe since it is not original. It is in my Betty Crocker Cookbook (circa 1974). But I do want to thank you for sharing it. My family liked this a lot. But many years ago, I spilled on that page. As a result, I now have 2 pages stuck together and can no longer read it. Once again I can treat my family to this dish.

Accidentally used cinnamon sugar instead of brown sugar. Turned this dish up about eight notches. Also used ground chicken instead of beef. Will be making this again.

I'm not in to sweet & sour but hubby is.  He came back for seconds and said it I could make it again and quite frankly I thought it was good too.  The other two adults in the house said it was too sweet.  The  1 1/2 year old ate it up.  I didn't think the meatballs were anything spectacular more like meatloaf but they were moist and most of mine held together well.

I made five pounds of meat so I could have some leftover meatballs for lunches which was about two frying pans full of large meatballs. I withheld one pan of meatballs from the sauce. With that I tripled the sauce which was just about right for one pan of good size meatballs.  So I would definitely double the sauce with recipe as written.  I bought 20 oz sweetened pineapple chunks and used all the juice from both cans (I tripled the sauce) and about 1 1/2 cans of pineapple chunks.  Next time I will buy one sweetened and one unsweetened and see if that doesn't fix the sweet issue and I may cut back on the pineapple chunks too.  Adding another table spoon of soy sauce and maybe unpacked brown sugar may also help.  

I will probably keep looking for a meatball recipe and tweak this one a bit, but this was a pretty quick meal that will be added to our once every two months rotation.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good!  Didn't make any adjustments, except what others suggested & baked the meatballs.  I did brown them first though.  Other than that, my husband & I thought it was excellent.

We make this all the time.  However instead of meatballs sometimes I use chicken that I  cut up fry in a little oil and I use steak cut up and fried in oil (olive oil). We serve it over rice then. It's always been a favorite while my kids were growing up and now it's a favorite they serve to their families.

My kids absolutely love this recipe!  To healthy it up a bit I use 1 lb of ground turkey or chicken in place of beef and add 1-2T of wheat germ in place of some of the saltine crumbs (which I always use bread crumbs).  I also usually don't need to use the milk if I only use one lb of meat or at least I add bread crumbs until I get a good constancy so I don't need it.  I grate the onion and ginger on the large pores of a regular grater (after a bad microplane incident w/ ginger! :) ). I also add grated carrots, use about 1/2 the brown sugar and serve over brown rice.

Made this recipe exactly as stated and it was by far the worst thing I've ever had.  The kids were grossed out by the overly sweet flavor and refused to eat it after the first bite.

This was a very yummy dinner, very much like what I remember back in the 60's...  Sometimes it's nice to go down memory lane. I cheated a bit and used frozen meatballs from the supermarket but added more veggies - onions, red pepper and celery. It was delicious!  The sauce turned out very well...  A great choice for dinner and/or potlucks.

So yummy!  I've never had sweet and sour meatballs before but now these will become a regular meal for us.  Super easy to make.  I cooked meatballs in oven as other reviews advised.  Added crushed red pepper to sauce which I think added a great dimension to the flavor.

I have made this for at least 35 years.  It's good and easy.  For the first time, I made a change and used ground oatmeal (not instant) instead of crackers.  My attempt at making it healthier!  I use oats in my meatloaf, but I don't grind it for that.

Very good recipe- only thing I did different was make the meatballs and bake them in the oven on a cookie sheet lined w/ foil for easy clean up. Also, added some cut up sweet vidalia onion along w/ the pepper and pineapple. A keeper- will make again!

I didn't love these, mainly the meatballs were bland - I really think because of the saltines. Yet DH liked them which is interesting because he's not a fan of meatballs. But I will try again using Ritz I think - and maybe either fresh ginger or more ground ginger.  I did use more peppers and sauteed them before making the sauce, I used a 20oz can of pineapple chunks so only 1/4c brown sugar because of the added sweetness from the pineapples. We liked the sauce very much, I wasn't crazy about the meatballs but worth working with.

These were really good & soo easy to make! I usually use another recipe similar to this with a lot more ingredients so this was a nice easy change! The only thing I did diffrently was use bread crumbs instead of crackers. Other than that followed the recipe exactly! I would double the sauce next time though! And to save dishes as other reviewers mentioned, bake meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes & bring sauce to a boil on stove top whisking out lumps of cornstarch. Then serve on white rice for a fantastic dinner!

Great!  I used one poud of ground turkey, added fresh garlic and pepper to the mixture and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  The sauce was very sweet so I ended up adding quite a bit more soy sauce then the recipe calls for. I also combined all the sauce ingredients in one pot and stirred until thickened. The meatballs were moist, the sauce tangy.  It was a wonderful and EASY meal that is now added to my rotation.

My husband and I really liked this. I dislike it when people change recipes on the first try...but I admit I did. I didn't have soy sauce so I used worchestershire...I didn't have onions so I used 2 teaspoons of onion salt...which I prefer because of texture. I also added a can and a half of La Choy Veggies (bean sprouts, water chestnuts, etc.) After the meat was brown, but not done I added the pineapple, peppers, and La Choy Veggies...then when those were hot and cooked thru, I added the glaze/sauce. I don't think any changes I made were "needed"...I just wanted a little more than peppers and pineapple to munch on when complete. It was terrific spooned over rice. I gave it 4 stars because I had wished the meatballs were more infused with flavor...but that's just a personal preference.

A GREAT recipe.  Am looking forward to trying slight variations (including the baking technique) but just as it is, it was a BIG HIT at our dinner table.  Even the 7 year old ate it, and that's saying something at our house...

Ok, I am only rating the sauce with the peppers and pineapple. I bought frozen meatballs because I did not have time to make them. The sauce is very, very good and soooo easy. I served this w/the meatballs over white rice. YUM!

Delicious! I substituted the ground beef w/ground turkey, used oatmeal instead of the crackers, and 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg and it came out beautiful!  Our son (who is sooo picky) even liked it!

Very good.  However, I did add about 1/2 cup of kethup to the sauce, not only for taste but color as well.  Also, I added a couple of drops of red food coloring.  I use this recipe quite often and with those two minor additions, works well for us!

We used to make this when I was a a kid whenever me and my sister wanted to cook for the family dinner. It was in one of moms old cook books which she no longer has. I have been looking all over the internet for it I was so happy to found it. It tasted the same as the one we made as kids. I like this better than other sweet and sour recipes as the sauce is more balanced between the sweet and the sour. I found most sweet and sour to sweet and not enough sour. I serve it over white rice. I make it exactly as it is written. I like to let everyone add soy sauce to their own taste. I am going to try it with chicken chunks next time instead of the meatballs.

This is a great mid week recipe. I too cooked the meatballs in the oven whilst making the sauce. I did not use pineapple pces or juice. I used chicken stock and added a whole peeled lime and a fresh from the garden yellow zucchini and a tablespoon of fresh minced mixed herbs. Will reduce the sugar next time.

I remember doing this recipe a very long time ago, and find the sauce to be too sour; so I put less vinegar and found it was just right for our taste. Instead of the green peppers I added red, big chunks of onions and mushrooms and it was very tasty. To give the meatballs more flavor I also added thym, basil and garlic powder.  I served this with butter and herbs pasta as a side dish which makes a good combination. We loved this and will make again but trying a different side dish next time.

I loved the sauce, but did not like the texture/taste of onions in the meatballs. Maybe it would have been better to leave onions out of the meatballs, and cut chunky onion pieces into the sauce with the pineapple and green peppers.

I loved this. Before I made it, I read the reviews and it seemed to me that it might turn out on the bland side so I used fresh ginger & added onion powder, cilantro, white pepper, black pepper and a pinch of ground clove to the meat. I used bread crumbs intstead of crackers and I did cook the meatballs in a frying pan, drained the oil and deglaced with cooking sherry to add flavor to the sauce. My husband will make sure I make this again.

I made some adjustments, but thought these were yummy!  I added 1 package of Liptons beef onion soup mix, 1 cup of water, and about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I don't like ginger so I didn't use it.  I served these over wide egg noodles and they were delicious!

This was awesome & quick!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it.  I substituted pea pods for the green pepper because that's what I had on hand.  The sauce was so good, that I will use it again and substitute chicken breasts or even pork tenderloin pieces.

This was really simple to make.  I did think the meatballs were plain and will use fresh ginger next time.  The sauce was really good also.  Good over white rice.

Oh YYYUUUUUMMMMM!!!  Pineapple and hamburgar together equals perfection!  I LOVE this recipe.  I left out the green peppers though.  We served it over brown rice and zucchini.  It was so good.

I needed a meatball recipe that didn't call for breadcrumbs and this was perfect. I chopped up some fresh ginger because that was all I had, and I think it gave it a nice flavor. Didn't make the sauce because it was just a side dish and I didn't have all those ingredients. I only had ground buffalo rather than beef, but I think it was a nice complementary flavor. I'll definitely try the whole recipe again.

Sweet, but not too sweet.  A nice spin on Sweet and Sour Meatballs.  I did make a couple of small changes to the recipe.  I've tried making meatballs in a skillet before, and they fell apart, so I took some of the other reviewers advice and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  Added some garlic to the meat mixture, increased the soy sauce and ginger and decreased the amount of vinegar and brown sugar.  Spooned over white rice, everybody loved it.

This recipe has been such a hit with my husband and I. It is delicious and is now one of our favorites. The only thing is that the meatballs never stay together, so I never form them anymore, just make it a ground beef topping. Still VERY good!

I threw mine in the crockpot and used frozen meatballs.  We served over rice, and it turned out great!  I thought the leftovers tasted even better...I think the meatballs absorbed the yummy pineapple sauce overnight!

The sauce was really good, but the meatballs didn't have much flavor. I used these for an appetizer, but maybe next time I will try them with rice to get more of the sauce in each bite.

Like others, I baked the meatballs at 350 degrees for approx. 20 minutes.  I substituted the chopped bell pepper for slices of onions and used apple cider vinegar.  I also used bread crumbs instead of saltines.  They tasted pretty good, although next time I would increase the amount of sauce.

Yummy!  Even my boys liked this one.  I only gave it four stars just because it was a little sweet for my taste.  Next time I won't use so much brown sugar.  Good recipe though definately a keeper.

Not a fan.  My husband, who is from Hawaii, could barely choke this down.  There is way too much vinegar and ginger in this.  Would not make it again.  I think cooking sherry in place of the vinegar and fresh ginger rather than the powdered would help this some.

I was looking for something "different" to make for dinner one night and came across this recipe.  WOW!  It was fast, easy and absolutely DELICIOUS!  The family loved it!  I made it with chinese style rice noodles for more of an "Asian" flare.

I thought these were really good.  I didn't have the bland flavor many people complained about, but I used Progresso Italian Bread crumbs and a little bit of ginger in my meatballs.  So maybe that helped.  I made it with Broccoli in the sauce, not peppers, because that is what I had on hand.  Will be making this again!!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I made a couple of adjustments, however. I added about 1/4 c of ketchup to the sauce making it more similar to other sweet and sours I've made before and I added half of a pepper instead of 1/3. Also, I added chopped onion. I stir fried them in a pan alone and added the sauce mix to that. I baked the meatballs as other's suggested and then added them to the sauce mix! Wonderful! Even my 6 year old son loved them!

Loved the recipe! I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines, and I didn't have pineapple. I just used pineapple juice, and it turned out yummy. I also baked it as others recommended.
My husband asked me to make these again, and I definitely will!

Loved the addition of ginger in the meat balls. It went really well with all the other flavours. :)

skipped the green pepper as I don't like cooked peppers - too soggy. followed the rest of the recipe to the letter with the exception of the vinegar - used just half. doubled the recipe - not one left after our party!

Delicious!  I was tempted to get frozen meatballs for this recipe, but I'm so glad I didn't.  The meat was terrific and this recipe was pretty simple.  Definitely something I would serve to dinner guests...over rice.

This is really good. I normally make with ground turkey and serve with rice. Great flavor.

I followed the recipe to the letter and everything turned out great. My mom used to make a similar recipe and these are just as good. The meatballs are sweet, pineappley, with a hint of ginger and soy - just enough. Also, I think this would be a good recipe for kids because it's more sweet than spicy. Very, very good stuff. Thanks!

They had a Chinese food flavor. I served them over rice. I think they would be good appetizers also.

These are scrumptious!  Ordinarily, I buy pre-cooked meatballs that are very similiar to this at our local meat shop. My kids love them because they're so moist and flavorful, and served alongside some rice (meatballs and rice, two things most kids will eat!), they make a fast and simple meal.  Thank you for sharing your great recipe!

This is the first time i've commented on a recipe from this site although I've used several and have had fairly good luck. I made these meatballs a day early, then threw them in the crockpot with the sauce for a party last night. Lots of compliments. I thought the meatballs were bland, although I added a little garlic. If I make them again i will add more garlic and probably some spices.  The sauce was very good with a few additions - 1/3 c. catsup, a couple of tablespoons spicy mustard, and about 1/4 extra soy sauce. My friend said she doesn't usually like "sweet meat" but she loved it and asked for the recipe. thanks!

My late mother-in-law made these meatballs every Thanksgiving and Christmas. After she died I lost the recipe and have been unable to recreate it. Found this recipe and made it for Christmas Eve. It is exactly like I remember. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'll be making them again every Thankgiving and Christmas as did my mother-in-law.

If I were to make this again, I would use less ginger, or maybe none at all, as I found it overpowering (however, I did only make 1.2 lbs of beef instead of 1.5 as the recipe calls for.  The meatballs smelled great while they were frying, but I might try baking them instead because it was difficult to brown them on all sides without them falling apart.  I let them cook for a while because they seemed to stay together better when brown.  My husband found the meatballs too soft (and didn't like the chunks of cracker crumbs) and thought the whole thing was too sweet.  Overall, the dish looked good and seemed like it should have been good, but neither of us really enjoyed it.

I followed this recipe exactly and served it over couscous - yummy!  The pineapple chunks and green peppers give it a little color for a nice presentation, too.  Thanks Cathy!

I made these for a buffet get-together at Christmas and they were gone in no time.  I, too, baked the meatballs in the oven to save time.  Great recipe!

A little bit of Hawaii in this easy dish....Absolutely delicious. Cooked it on stove-top on low medium heat with Olive Oil. Served as a main dish for dinner. Will definitely make as an appetizer, will just make them smaller.. YUMMY!!

My husband loved this!!  He gave it a 9 1/2 stars which is very generous for him and made me promise to make this again!

Very easy, I used crushed pineapple instead and it turned out great.

Okay.  Mild in flavor.  Some people liked it and some didn't.  I don't think I will go through the trouble of making these again.

Wonderful Recipe!! Great if your family loves the taste of 'Sweet and Sour'.  I serve my meat balls over a bed of white fluffy jasmine rice along with a nice green salad. Very filling and satisfying.

One word sums this recipe up...YUM!!!!!! DH loved it and I thought the meatballs had great flavor. I personally don't care too much for too sweet sauces but this really wasn't bad. We omitted the green peppers since we aren't too keen on cooked hot peppers. Served on top of egg noodles, this was a great meal! A definate keeper that I suggest that anyone give a try! Thanks so much Cathy! This was GREAT!!!!

Delicious!  The first time I made this recipe, I thought the vinegar was too strong.  So the next time I reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup, and it was perfect!

The whole family loved it! We had it over rice and it was perfect. I will make the meatballs ahead next time to cut down on the prep time. It takes longer than 20 minutes, more like 30 minutes. It was worth it though!
