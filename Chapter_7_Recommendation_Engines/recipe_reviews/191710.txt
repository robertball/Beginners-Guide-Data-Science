Yummmm!  I was too lazy (and hungry) to do the butter melting/cooling thing, so I just added some vegetable oil and a little butter extract.  These are fluffy and cook perfectly.  Love that crunchy crust that comes from the cornmeal!  My first time making cornmeal pancakes - won't be my last!

Great cornmeal flavour. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 2% milk, and I only used 1 tbsp sugar as there is plenty if you're topping it with real maple syrup. I'd probably add a bit of vanilla next time. This recipe made about eight 6-inch pancakes.

I followed the recipe and it was great. I have a stupid question, when you modify the recipe the rating you give it is it for the original or the modified? Ratings should be based on the recipe. IF you modify it and it does not taste good then don't rate the recipe to mislead people due to your modifications.

This recipe is fabulous as is! Since we tried it, we've made these once a week (it's been several weeks). I always think I'll just save the leftovers in the freezer... yeah. No leftovers.
**tip** Sometimes I save time by mixing all the dry ingredients together the night before, cover and leave them on the counter. In the morning, I just preheat the pan while I mix together my 3 wet ingredients and breakfast is on in no time!

These are kind of like a sweet cornbread but in pancake form. Like a johnnycake almost. If you are expecting pancakes and not a pancake version of cornbread, you will be disappointed. Adjust the sugar to reflect the amount of sweet you like in your cornbread. I think I put in 3 teaspoons, and it was fine. I will make these again.

It was very tasty and easy to make.  I gave it a four instead of a five only because it was way too thick as-is and I had to add a half a cup of whole milk.  Otherwise, it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing it!

Delicious recipe!  I'm keeping this!

A couple things I did wrong (not because the recipe told me so!) that I wanted to share, just in case:

*Don't mix the butter in with the flour and cornmeal first!  If you do, you'll get lots of little lumps of cornmeal/butter floating in floury milk.  I don't know HOW I thought this would work... but it was not good.  I blended the sucker with a submersion blender and then it was all good.

*Coarse, stone-ground cornmeal makes for VERY crunchy pancakes!  Again, this problem was mostly solved by the submersion blender - but next time I'm sticking to something finer ground.  The batter doesn't cook for as long as cornbread, so I think the cooking time doesn't give the really coarse cornmeal grains a chance to soften.  

Those mistakes were my own, though, and not the recipes's - these suckers taste delicious!  Thank you!

Nice. They have a beautiful golden hue and fluffy texture, perhaps because I added more b/p and b/s. No buttermilk so I soured milk with a T. of vinegar. It was a surprising change from cornbread and my family enjoyed it. Thank you.

I have been making and eating these pancakes for 45 years. I always have on hand all the ingredients except the buttermilk. But I have found a satisfactory substitute when I have no buttermilk on hand. Its called Saco brand cultured, blended buttermilk, in dry, instant form, in  packets, that make one cup of buttermilk, just add milk,or water. One packet makes one cup. And it has a long shelf life, comes 4 packets to a box. Available at most grocery stores in baking goods section. Very handy and very good.

Excellent recipe; thank you.  These pancakes are easy to make and come out delicious. No changes to the recipe are needed.  I served ours with maple syrup to my husband and daughter.  Not a single pancake was left over!

Thank you for this delicious recipe!  Very light and flavorful.  I did not have buttermilk but used one tablespoon of vinegar with 2% milk and they were amazing.

I made these tonight with minor changes...I read some reviews that said they were a little sweet, so when I doubled the recipe instead of doubling the sugar, I used the original 2 Tbsp as instructed.  I also changed the flour to 1 cup of all-purpose flour, and 1/2 a cup of Masa flour (for making tamales) and used the full 1 1/2 cups of yellow cornmeal.  
They were delicious and went perfectly with the soup I made for dinner.  I'll be making these again!   
If I hadn't doubled the recipe, I would have used 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup Masa flour, and 3/4 cup cornmeal.  That would be in keeping with what I did tonight.  (oh, and only use half the sugar for a less sweet pancake).  
This was just what I was looking for - thank you for posting the recipe!

Absolutely brilliant recipe.  I left out the butter and sugar and used milk with 1tbls vinegar instead of Buttermilk.  Cooked like a dream, super fast and tasty.  We added maple syrup and butter at the table.

My family loved them!  They are much better than the cornmeal griddle cake recipe I usually use - very moist and fluffy.  (Gotta love buttermilk!)  I have been trying prepare higher fiber foods, and this recipe fit the bill.

Our first pancakes were very thin, so we added 1/2 c. more flour. These pancakes do not get light & fluffy. They are a heavier pancake.  My family wasn't crazy about them. If you like cornmeal flavor you will like these, you can definitely taste the cornmeal. Thanks.

Mmm, delicious and fluffy pancakes! Cures the cornbread craving if you're like me and too lazy to wait for cornbread to bake! I ran out of buttermilk so used about 1 cup buttermilk and 1/4 whipping cream, and I also used corn flour instead of cornmeal. Not much difference in flavor, but it has a finer texture.

These were very good for something a little different. I did thin them out a bit more w/added milk only because I like thinner corn cakes. Thank you! I got enough for 2 cakes per serving(5 people), making them about 6".

Good pancakes...they are a bit heartier than regular pancakes and not sweet.  (You might consider adding extra sugar if you are looking for some sweetness.)  I added a splash of vanilla but otherwise followed the recipe.

Prepared exactly as written...not horrible but not something we'd like again. I didn't find it overly cornbread tasting nor too sweet, we just didn't like the texture, taste was so-so...not what we were hoping for.

These sounded interesting & we wanted to try something like a johnnycake but I had a hard time finding a recipe for a good johnnycake so I made these. They are good for a one time thing, but we prefer regular pancakes so we probably won't make them again. Definately like cornbread in a pancake version..

Never even thought of making anything like this.  Very good recipe.  Hardly needed any additional butter or syrup.  Will definitely make again.

Three stars for taste and four stars for texture. These were light and fluffy, and the cornmeal added a delightful texture that I really liked. The flavor, though, was just okay. While it didn't taste bad by any means, the flavor was just too reminiscent of corn bread. I do like corn bread, but that wasn't what I was looking for in my pancakes. 3.5 stars.

Made this past weekend.  Good but not exceptional.  Not much different than regular buttermilk pancakes.

These just didn't work - the batter was way too thin, and almost no cornmeal flavor at all.  I ended up adding an extra 1/4 cup cornmeal and some more baking powder and they turned out okay.  I think I'll just stick with cornbread.

I really loved this recipe. I have a bunch of cornmeal that I need to use and this was a perfect way.  I actually made waffles instead of pancakes.  i took the advice of another person on the list by adding vinegar to regular milk to sour it.  Yummmmy

Great recipe!  I didn't have buttermilk at home so I substituted plain yogurt and changed the baking soda and baking powder accordingly.  Next time I will try it with buttermilk because the yogurt made the pancakes a little heavy.  That's why I still gave the recipe 5 stars since I changed the ingredients.

Made it just like the recipe (except I made my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar) and they were wonderful with pinto beans, fresh diced onions, and fried ham. Yum! The only thing different was that I halved the recipe because it's just my husband and I. And we still have leftovers for tomorrow!

I made it this morning with no variation from the recipe.  I have been making buttermilk pancakes for years, but the idea of using cornmeal intrigued me. I loved the crispiness, the inside was light with an almost gritty consistency. The recipe made 15 - 4 inch pancakes. I made them in batches of 4, topping them with a bit of butter and real maple syrup. The first batch was made with butter to grease the pan, but it tended to burn so I switched to coconut oil for the rest.

Very good- I substituted white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and they still turned out delicious. I only wish there was a stronger corn flavor.

I accidentally increased buttermilk to 1 1/2c; & didn't accidentally decrease sugar to 1T & butter to 2T.  'Can't say I liked them better than traditional; but, on the off-chance I'm short of flour & want pancakes, I'll make again.  They weren't too cornbready, almost couldn't tell.  I used regular, not stoneground cornmeal.  Update, next morning:  Not-so-good. They got pretty stiff & cornbready.  :D  I'll save them for cornbread dressing soooo okay when fresh, not leftovers.

I just made these and I didn't know what to rate them...4 stars for flavor but two for texture so I went with the average. As other reviewers said, they are very dense and flat. I kind of expected that though since cornmeal muffins and bread are not exactly light and fluffy. However, these were very tasty! I agree with another person who said they were too sweet though, especially if you are going to put something sweet on top like syrup. I will make these again but leave out the sugar and add 1/2 cup more flour. I added 1/4 after making 4 pancakes to see if it would make them a little thicker and/or fluffier and it did make a little difference. I also think I will use a little less butter, maybe 2 TBS since I noticed that as they were frying, you could see the butter oozing out.
So I suggest if you love cornmeal...make these, you'll probably like them like we did. However, if you want a light fluffy pancake, these aren't for you.

These pancakes were great!  I didn't have cornmeal so I just used a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix (the back of the box listed the ingredients as: wheat flour, cornmeal and sugar - perfect!) and then I added the rest of the ingredients that this recipe called for.  I had to substitute skim milk + vinegar for the buttermilk and I also added a little brown sugar.  The edges turned out a little crispy and the insides were nice and fluffy.  My husband and I both loved them!  They are a fun spin on traditional pancakes and they taste great topped with blueberries and maple syrup.

These were tasty. I wanted to try a different type of pancake and came across this one. Made it for me and hubby. We both liked them. They rock with some melted butter and maple syrup! Yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good. I had to modify mine because I have celiacs disease and can not eat wheat gluten. By simply substituting my gluten free flour mixture cup for cup for the wheat flour and adding a teaspoon of xantham gum these came out excellent. I would highly recommend them to anyone.

These have very good flavor and texture, but they are flat, not fat. I'm used to big fat fluffy pancakes. These didn't rise much, but otherwise very good and not too heavy.

I was amazed to find the initial mixture was far too thick. I needed to add one whole cup more milk to pour the batter.  Also, I doubled the salt as they were quite tasteless otherwise.  I fried them in 2 small non- stick frying pans so they turned out perfectly round.  The end result was excellent but I cannot understand why only one other reviewer said they had to add extra milk, and even they only added half a cup.

Nice change of pace from the normal pancake. I add a little bit more flour as the batter was a little to liquidy. My family really like these and I will be making them again.

These "Cornbread Pancakes" are very satisfactory. I would make them again. I especially liked the fact that the light batter cooks quickly and DOES NOT STICK TO THE NON-STICK PAN (HUGE BONUS). Thank you CocoBean for sharing your recipe.

I was on my own for dinner tonight and decided to make pancakes.  I'm really glad that I picked this recipe.  I scaled it down to 2 servings.  I used the whole egg instead of 3/4 of an egg but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I got 3 pancakes about 5 inches in size.  They were light and fluffy and I could definitely taste the cornmeal.  I plan to make these for breakfast very soon and I know Hubby will love them. Thanks for a really great recipe.

Delicious!  By the way, this is the recipe for McDonald’s hot cakes, which was once available as Kraft Complete Pancake & Waffle Mix.  About 30 years ago, Kraft and McD made an exclusive contract for the mix.  Grrr!  The secret ingredient is the cornmeal.  Use the finest size of cornmeal you can find!

I made recipe with all ingredients, with exception of using milk and vinegar for buttermilk. They turned out nice and fluffy but the taste was a little bland for me. I wanted more buttery sweetness .  It the maple syrup and butter made them good .

Loved these as is! Also amazing if you add mini chocolate chips to the batter...and then syrup isn’t needed in my opinion :)

I did use Trader Joe's all purpose gluten free flour instead of wheat flour. And added chopped fresh strawberries.

Really delicious.   

But keep your fry pan on medium heat when you put in batter if your frying the pancakes in butter. Then raise heat if needed.  With the cornmeal and sugar, these can burn easily.

This...this is a 5 Star recipe.  They were so good...I’m not sure that I can go back to regular pancakes :(.  The only modification that I made was adding an additional tbsp or two of buttermilk to thin the batter out.  It was like eating cornbread....sooooo delicious and FILLING.  Did I mention delicious? Definitely making these for breakfast tomorrow........maybe brinner tonight.

These were good. First time that I have made them. The corn flavor was really great. Consistency was a little heavier than I prefer but overall very good. Thanks for recipe.

This was delicious! My picky 3 yr old and husband even ate it for lunch because they loved it so much! Just make sure you stir the batter after keeping it in the fridge. It's amazing with honey and butter.

I had to use Jiffy corn muffin mix because I didn't have any corn meal other than that but followed the rest of the directions and I found it was still a bit too runny so I added about a 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup more flour and I also added vanilla extract and these were great. I also used the vinegar in the milk in place of the buttermilk. Very good I will make these again. I only give it 4 stars because it was so runny and I had to thicken it otherwise very good.

Heavenly served warm and drizzled with honey.  My husband told me I should stop making regular corn bread and make these pancakes instead.  Buttery, not too sweet, and perfect in texture/thickness.  I followed the recipe as listed except for subbing 1/4 cup Skim Milk (because I only had a cup of buttermilk left in the fridge).  I also sifted my dry ingredients before mixing with the wet, and used a nonstick griddle heated to 350.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Wow these were good. The consistency was awesome. I have celiac so I used gluten free Pillsbury all purpose flour and lemon juice with regular milk to make sour milk. Otherwise perfect. It taste like butter lol.

These are probably the best pancakes I have ever made! Paired with some homemade buttermilk syrup they are to die for. My fiancé isn't even a huge fan of pancakes but he keeps raving about these.

Something went sooo wrong for me with these pancakes. Followed recipe, batter was extremely thin. I made a batch nonetheless and the cooked product was eggy and greasy from all of the butter. I ended up adding another quarter cup of cornmeal and three quarters of a cup of flour. The cakes cooked better after that but the flavor wasn't great. Maybe I'll toy with the recipe to see if I get better results.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have butter milk on hand, so I took out one tablespoon of the milk and put in one tablespoon of white vinegar. Other recipes did that so I tried it here and it worked fine. "Yummy"

I thought these were great and easy.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and sucanat instead of sugar and organic corn meal.  We switched to real food a few months ago so try to avoid refined ingredients.  It was great, didn't taste healthy at all.

Pretty darn good, although the listed heat is way too hot.  Low heat or they burn like crazy.  Try with Tabasco instead of syrup.  I don't usually like Tabasco, but somehow it's amazing on these.

I didn't add the sugar because it's sweet enough already. 
They were nice and thick, great taste without the sugar.

Everyone loves these just as written.  Also good with regular milk in a pinch.  For a lighter textured version I up the ratio of corn meal to flour from 1:1 to 1:2 with very good results as well.  A great addition to weekend breakfasts with family and guests and certainly as easy as a mix.

The batter is very liquid, but fluffs right up in the pan. I love cornmeal pancakes and these hit the spot beautifully.

What a super recipe.  Great proportions/ratios.  I decided to give it a try as an alternative to making a big skillet of cornbread.  I've been playing around with it, too.  To make it a bit more Southern, I omitted the sugar ...great!  A an easy foil to chili and/or Mexican foods, I added garlic and cumin and a bit of red pepper ...tasty!  Now I'm seeing how well I can freeze them.

Here's a question for the gang: my wife is suddenly vegan.  Any good ideas on how to replace the eggs in this recipe?  I'm certain that eggs add a necessary leavening.

Thanks again!
Mike

I made the recipe as is.  I let the batter set while I cooked bacon on my griddle.... scraped and toweled the griddle while still on the burners.  The griddle was the just right temperature and they turned out beautifully browned.  They were soft, fluffy and flavorful.  I think letting them sit for that 12 minutes softened the cornmeal and activated the baking powder.  Then the cakes got a second burst of rising when they hit the hot griddle.  Perfect recipe.  I only wished I had thawed out some blueberries to put on a top.

Great, adaptable recipe! I made these for breakfast at a family reunion—adjusted it for 20 servings, which meant that there were plenty of pancakes for the 13 of us. I used canola oil instead of melted butter (we were running low) and only 5 eggs instead of the 8 the quadrupled recipe called for, and they still held together well. Delicious.

My husband and one of my three enjoyed these. My two kids didn't like the texture but liked the taste. I would make them again with 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup cornmeal.

This recipe makes and excellent corn pancake -- they are exceptionally light, cook very quickly (unlike most pancakes, which have you staring at a pan for what feels like ages), and come out a beautiful golden brown.

Just whipped these up for dinner! Poured a bit of maple syrup over them and served with ham, bacon and strawberries. Our whole family devoured them. I didn't have time to read through the reviews, so I went with the recipe as is. I'm glad I did. I wouldn't change a thing. These were perfect. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I adapted this recipe to be gluten-free by swapping garbanzo bean flour for the all-purpose flour and it came out wonderfully! I also need to be dairy-free, so I used melted ghee rather than butter and made my own "buttermilk" using white wine vinegar and almond milk (1T / 1c) and letting it sit for 15min.  While the batter looked thick and dense, they ended up quite fluffy in the end.  Possibly the best foundation pancake recipe I've come across!

Pretty good as written, but as mentioned by other reviewers, they are a bit "heavy" as is.  I think I will cut flour to 1/2 C next time I make these, and perhaps change the butter to melted bacon grease (something I always save & freeze).  Thanks for the recipe!

Best pancakes I ever had! I was impressed that I made them. Definately a must try. I will never go back to normal pancakes. I think the cornmeal and buttermilk really make the difference.

These are pretty good--I followed the recipe other than the buttermilk, which I had none of so I used regular milk with vinegar.  I don't know why some of the reviewers said the batter was too thick because I thought it was too thin.  The pancakes I got were very flat, but did have a nice cornbread flavor.

Awesome! Made these this morning. Like another reviewer, I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I added a tablespoon of vinegar (apple cider) to my measuring cup, and then did the rest milk. My milk was skim, so I think that caused the batter to be a bit thinner. Added about 3 Tbsp. more of flour and a touch more baking powder to compensate. Also added a teaspoon more of sugar and a splash of vanilla. Great flavor, and that cornbread-y hint to it makes it a good, different pancake option.

Ran out of pancake mix but had some masa so I used this recipe. I used whole milk and added some vanilla and they were gobbled up by my 3 kids. Don't skimp on the sugar. They are thin but we like thin pancakes. They aren't crepe like thin though, just right.

I really liked these pancakes.  I made them for my boyfriend and he wasn't the biggest fan but I love cornmeal way more than he does.  I also eat them without syrup, just some butter or honey and it's just like having cornbread for breakfast.

I used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. cornmeal, slightly less butter than called for and half the sugar.  These were a big hit.  They were definitely not too dense or heavy and didn't have as grainy a texture as cornbread (as some reviewers experienced).  I beat the wet ingredients really well before folding them in to the dry very gently.  Maybe that helped?  We love pancakes in this house and will be making these again!

I've made the original version several times and have tried a couple of variations. This morning, for example, I halved the recipe and instead of using 3/4 cup of 2% milk, I used half a cup of that plus 1/4 c of olive oil. I also used 'fake butter' rather than the real thing. My fiancee, who was eating alone, said they were 'fabulous' -- as good or better than other versions I've made. Maybe because I went a little heavy on the butter, and 'lightly greased' the pan with bacon drippings. (I gave only a four rating because I think the buttermilk ingredient is an unnecessary complication: How many people just happen to have that on hand on a spur-of-the-moment 'pancake morning?)

Used a blend of all-purpose & whole-wheat pastry flour, as well as melted virgin coconut oil/butter blend.  Exactly the taste I was looking for...Ate them with blueberries and real maple syrup.

So yummy and just what I was expecting! The batter was a little thinner than I like, so I added at least a half cup more of flour and 1/4 teaspoon more baking powder and it was perfect. Also added some mini chocolate chips to mimic a chocolate chip cornbread recipe I make and it tasted exactly the same! My kids gobbled them all up.....and no syrup was needed!  These have now been added to our weekend pancake rotation! Thanks!

We loved these!  Didn't have all-purpose flour so used White whole wheat and they still got a thumbs up from the whole family.  I think next time I will try Olive oil instead of butter just to make more healthy.

Love cornbread, the pancakes were great. Made them this morning, the difference was I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar, and coconut oil. REALLY good!

Great option for pancakes. I made them exactly per the recipe except I used agave nectar instead of granulated sugar (1 TB).

I make these regularly and my family loves them.  They are very filling and absolutely delicious.  No need to adjust anything.  Perfect just like they are.

I made these for dinner this evening and my family said they are the best pancakes they ever tasted.  I will definitely be making these again.

I think I must be crazy because when I ate these I wasn't blown away but everyone else seems to think these are the best. 

I think the recipe is good, not great.

Everything old is new again.  My mother (87) made these as a dinner bread when we were going thru hard times (she lived thru the Depression).  A treat for us kids!  Butter/jelly - that was enough.  I had not thought about this in more than three decades! Please!  If you make these, cut back on the sugar - at LEAST by a tablespoon! You'll have a bread worthy of any sausage or milk (as mom calls it) gravey you can sop up.  Thanks for the memories!

I love cornbread, so when I saw this recipe I had to try it and it was awesome. The family loved it for Sunday morning breakfast. I didn't have the buttermilk and did as others have done and it was great. I think this will now be on our Sunday morning breakfast must have.

Really good! I had to sour my milk with vinegar since I rarely buy buttermilk. Also used closer to 1.5 cups of milk to finish off the gallon :P the batter was not too runny or too thick this way, perhaps because I'm at a high altitude? Anyway, I think for my tastes a little more sugar and a slightly coarser corn meal would be better, but that is by no means the fault of the recipe. Also... melting 3tbs of butter and cooling it isn't that hard, I melted first, let it sit on the counter, and when I was almost ready for it I stuck it in the fridge for a brief period of time, maybe a minute or two. To detect they are ready to flip, there weren't the usual pancake bubbles, but the surface of the pancake was 90% less shiny, if that makes any sense. I have leftover batter in the fridge... about to go make more!

Sounds yummy!  I don't keep buttermilk around the house, and I don't like the taste when you try to sour sweet milk.  However yogurt works just as well.  Just add 1/2 cup of sweet milk to thin it out.  I use whatever flavour I have on hand.  My family love them.

delicious!.... but next time I will add more buttermilk. We found them to be quite dense with the amount recommended in the recipe.

It was delicious!  Modified it only because we are Gluten Free and used GF flour.  The rest I kept the same and they were fluffy and light and very tasty.  Thanks!!!

My wife said it best, "With the cornbread taste, you didn't know whether to just put butter on them or if you should use some syrup."
Overall, they are good.  I like the cornbread taste.  However, it's something I'd only do occasionally, like for company or for an option from regular pancakes.

For some reason I have been in the mood for Something made with cornmeal and this recipe was there.  I followed the directions exactly and like others, used the milk/vinegar combo as a substitute for buttermilk.  since I don't like syrup on pancakes ( yes I know that's weird) these will make a good snack with something spread on them or rolled up in them.  This recipe was delicious and easy thank you for sharing.
