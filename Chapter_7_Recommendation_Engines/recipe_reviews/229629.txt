Best pancake recipe ever. Loved the taste and texture (no doughy cakes for me); it's what I've been looking for for years. No issues at all with runny batter since I used quick oats instead of old fashioned; they more readily absorbed the buttermilk. They were also great the next day,didn't get soggy and held up very well. This is my go-to recipe.

This is a wonderful option for those looking for a healthier morning pancake.  The flavor and texture is good, but next time I will send them over the top by adding blueberries.   These pancakes would be perfect with the addition of fruit.

Excellent, great texture.  I followed the recipe exactly and my wife and I were very happy with the results.  We served them with bananas and toasted pecans.

I have been searching for an oatmeal pancake recipe that I my family really liked.  Have tried others and the texture was too doughy - but these were great!  I did whirl my oats in the blender first and soaked them and the cornmeal in the milk.  I added about 1/4 cup more flour so batter would not be so thin.  Sprinkled the tops with blueberries and these were so good.  I think my search for a great oatmeal pancake has ended.  Thank you!

This is excellent! Just as good, maybe better, than my favorites at the famous pancake parlor in Sugar Hill, New Hampshire. I cut the recipe in half, as I only needed 2 servings, which was more than adequate. Half the recipe makes 6-8 four inch pancakes (I used 1/3 cup measure for each). I also mixed the cornmeal in with the oats and buttermilk to soften for 5 minutes. Delicious whole grain flavor yet still light with a pleasing texture. Cooked up beautifully with nice golden color. A mainstay for sure!

My whole family liked this. I had to make add more flour and cornmeal because the batter was too runny (I added an additional 1/2 cup of each, keeping the ratios consistent). I also used brown sugar instead of white, added 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon because it sounded yummy.  I also tried it with mixed in blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. Not everyone liked the berries. This was hearty so you will eat less of these than normal pancakes.

This will serve 4 if you are feeding teenage boys or farm/ranch hands.  For ordinary adults, this will serve 6-8 and these are true "stick-to-your-ribs" style hearty pancakes.  My husband balked at the recipe originally, but one bite turned him into a fan.

Awesome Pancakes!!  I increased the sugar to 1 Tbsp... everything was exact.  These are sooo good! We had them for dinner and I don't feel one bit guilty;)  Texture and flavor are perfect.  They do have to cook just a bit longer than the standard batter.  This will be a go to!

I have made these many times, and they are great as is. Sometimes I add vanilla for a special occasion. These pancakes are thin, but that is how we like ours. The flavor and texture is delicious. When I tried putting blueberries in the batter it was too thin to work very well, so we put our fruit on top.

Initially surprised by how thin the batter was, but just made big pancakes and let it spread out.  Increased sugar slightly and added chopped walnuts.  Plan to add mashed banana next time as well.

Excellent! Used cornmeal muffin mix instead of cornmeal and it was not runny at all. Less gritty too Double the recipe and keep extras in the freezer for quick breakfasts (if there are any leftover!)

Made these exactly per the recipe. Texture was a bit off for me. Maybe better if the oats had been blasted in the blender or food processor first? Might try a second attempt with that method.

I have been making this recipe for a few weeks and love it.  I use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and I add vanilla extract and cinnamon.  Instead of making pancakes, I make Belgium Waffles. They are really delicious.

Delicious!! I made this GF by using Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour instead of the wheat all purposes flour. I never have buttermilk so I used 2 Tablespoon lemon juice and filled a two-cup measure with almond milk. I made the mistake of using a course corn meal so will adjust next time and use a finer grain. I don't think any of these substitutes changed the original recipe just made it gluten and dairy-free friendly. I didn't not find the batter runny at all.  It is important to let the oatmeal and buttermilk set for the 5 minutes.

Love these pancakes!  This was my first attempt at oatmeal or buttermilk pancakes and I loved the flavor and texture.  The third time I tried this recipe I had run out of rolled oats and used steel-cut oats instead.  This didn't turn out well because of the longer cooking time that steel cut oats require. I even tried softening the buttermilk/oat mixture in the microwave for 7 minutes at 50% power but the oats were still chewy.  I will still love them though.  I freeze the extra pancakes and they make a great, quick breakfast in the toaster oven every morning.

This will be my default recipe! Three of my grandchildren and I made this recipe this morning and we loved everything about them. They're healthier with the oatmeal and cornmeal and they have more flavor. My grandkids tell me to tell you that even the first batch was beautiful! Jack, who is 10 and who cooks a lot, says maybe they'd be even tastier with a teaspoon of cinnamon...6 years later, same 3 grand kids, we all still LOVE this recipe--and we added cinnamon!

I was looking for a healthier take on buttermilk pancakes and thought the rolled oats would do it but I found the 1/4 of oil kind of cancelled it out. It made the pancakes really dense and not so healthy tasting. In addition, when I make pancakes i often also make bacon and I like to use some of the bacon drippings to cook the pancakes. I found the oats in this recipe acted like a sponge for the bacon fat and made the first batch totally inedible. They also begged for a little more sweetness so I mashed a banana and added it to the consequent batches. Better but I still won’t make them again.

First of all,  I am not a fan of folks saying "I made it, it's great...BUT...". So I only will say I DID substitute kefir for  the buttermilk only because kefir is what I have, and buttermilk is what I cannot get. My husband loved these pancakes. Delicious, great texture, and filling. You could eat them plain. Thanks!!

Reduced milk to 1 1/2 cups.  Partially chopped oats in food processor.  Added oats and cornmeal to milk and soaked for few minutes.  Added eggs, oil (used coconut) to milk oat mixture.  Added mix to flour and remaining ingredients.  Added 1 mashed ripe banana.  Batter was not thin.
Good texture and flavour.

These are fantastic!! Hearty, great texture and delicious. I really like the crunch the corn meal gives it. They would make an excellent base for savory add ins like ham, broccoli and cheese. I think we will try it with those add ins next time.

These were delicious and easy.  I used quick oats and soaked them with the cornmeal and sugar in the buttermilk and I added a dribble of vanilla.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I did not find the batter soupy at all..in fact, I had to add a few Tbsp of liquid to the batter; I used orange juice.  The cornmeal added a little extra texture to them, we loved it but it could be subbed with additional oatmeal if you choose.  I will definitely make these again.

I made these as recipe directed. We found the pancakes to have a gritty texture. I think if I were to make them again I would substitute flour or oatmeal for the corn meal.

I made this exactly as it appears.  The pancakes were fantastic with maple syrup the first day and with blueberry syrup the second day.  Even my husband's blue and gold macaw and my Congo African grey parrot loved these.

These turned out fabulously! I cooked mine in coconut oil and a little bit of vegetable oil, all in a cast iron skillet!!! So yummy! I did add some extra flour and cornmeal (batter a little runny), doubled the sugar, and added about a tsp of vanilla extract! Delicious!

Always looking for healthy pancakes. We liked the cornmeal flavor.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg and some chopped pecans to the batter. Blueberries added a nice interest.  Would be really good with a hot fruit compote before serving.

These looked like a good pancake, smelled like a good pancake. The texture was different, but not bad. My first impression was, healthy pancakes that do not taste like cardboard, as most wheat based healthy alternatives do. They were just a little less than OK. My wife and I think the corn meal is what made them less desirable. It's a personal taste, but corn meal in pancakes is not something we like.

I just made these pancakes, they were quite good, would make them again. I used  what I had,Trader Joes' toasted flake multigrain cereal as I did not have oatmeal and polenta rather than finer corn meal. I did add up the white sugar to 1 tsp and added 2 tsp brown sugar. They were quite chewy from the undercooked grains, would hit those with the blender nefore hand next time.Otherwise very good

Great recipe to get the kids filled up for school!  I did take the advice of a previous review and used a food processor to make the whole oats a bit finer for the kids.  Didn't have cornmeal so substituted a scoop of protein powder. Topped it with bananas and blueberries.  Also great with  a spread of peanut butter  topped off with chocolate chips  or applesauce.  Made the day before and warmed in toaster oven!

These were moist and delicious. We reheated the left over pancakes the next day and they were still delicious. Letting the oats and buttermilk sit for a few minutes is important because the oats swell, soften and absorb the buttermilk. Don't skip this step. All directions are good and recipe can be followed exactly. Hubby wanted to make sure I saved the recipe.

Made a half recipe successfully. Enjoyed the taste and texture of the oatmeal. Allowing the oatmeal to rest in the buttermilk for a full five minutes, or longer if you have the time, is important as the oatmeal softens. Stored the left over batter overnight, and the last pancake cooked up just fine. Will make this again.

OMG!!! This is amazing!! It sounded so unusual to me, I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, but scaled it down to only 2 servings & added a bit of ground cinnamon & vanilla extract to the batter. The texture is a little different from what I'm used to, but in a good way! I served them with a simple homemade blueberry syrup. This is definitely going into my rotation. Thank you so much for this great recipe!!!

LOVE these pancakes! They have a  bit of a nutty flavour and the cornmeal gives it a fun crunch. The kids love it! We usually eat them with peanut butter on them and skip the syrup.

Not my kind of pancake.  Cornmeal remained grainy, not a nice texture.  Batter was very thin, even after adding a bit more flour.  Pancakes were not sweet at all.

I had 1 cup of buttermilk and 1/2 cup of quick oats to use up. . . I halved the  recipe for two of us (only used the oats I had) and added a handful of dried blueberries to batter. My batter was NOT too thin. Good pancake with slight chewiness of oatmeal and grit of corn meal. I enjoyed mine topped with Greek yogurt and fresh blueberries/strawberries.

Yes and No!  The flavor was good (perhaps all that buttermilk contributed to that), but the texture was too heavy for me.  We  prefer our pancakes light and fluffy so if anyone that's not particular about that, then you'd probably would like this recipe.  I followed it to the "T" and our overnight company thought they were really good.  If you like the texture of oatmeal and the flavor of buttermilk, then definitely try this recipe...I don't think you'll be disappointed.

I made these cakes this morning for the first time and they had an extraordinary texture and wholesome taste.  I did add some blueberries as someone suggested. I think the blueberries added too much moisture to the otherwise somewhat crispy texture. Next time I will try chopped dried apricots or something of that nature. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe exactly except added a splash of vanilla (used quick oats). This made a great, hearty pancake with a yummy texture.    Not for you if you like a more traditional floppy, doughy pancake, though.

I made this exactly as written and it was great. The right combination -- buttermilk for fluff and moisture, cornmeal and oats for a little hearty chewiness. I made this again using whole wheat flour and it was just as good. This was an instant favorite.

Review update 9/25: I can now change my review from the former 4 stars to the well deserved 5 stars. I must have made an error on my measurements the first time. The batter was perfect in consistency. I added blueberries to the dry flour combination to coat and then combined with soaked oats/liquid.  Excellent! 
First review - 4 stars
Imade this recipe this morning for breakfast. The pancakes are delicious and quite filling. The "surprise" slight crunch of the cornmeal is a pleasant surprise.  I soaked the oatmeal as suggested. Perfect! I adjusted the recipe for 2 servings and followed the directions as written with the exception of adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. The batter was so stiff, I had to add more buttermilk (about 1/4 cup)  before putting the batter on the griddle. Not sure what happened but I will try them again. I added blueberries once they were on the griddle...delicious!

This is a hearty, filling, easy to make pancake mix. Great for little kids help too. I've doubled the recipe (uses all the buttermilk in a quart size container) and substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil.  Always a hit to add chocolate and/or vanilla chips while cooking too!

Absolutely delicious!! I was looking for a heartier, healthier alternative to traditional pancakes and this was a hit with the whole family. I used 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake which yielded 14 pancakes, each about 4.25 inches across. And if my calculations are correct, each pancake is approximately 130 calories. Perfect!

I liked the texture and flavour of these pancakes but found them to be quite oily. Not sure if switching to butter might help?

Turned out yummy, really nice texture. Only changes I made was I used melted butter in place of oil. I also added blueberries.

Little crunch and great neutral flavor. I did a dash of cinnamon in the batter and peach preserves on top,  ate myself into a coma.

My new favorite pancake; I've never had better, even in restaurants. I added a little cinnamon and vanilla extract but this recipe would also be delicious without change.

I lost a treasured cook book 26 years ago with many wonderful recipes. Among them was one like this. I would use dry buttermilk and make them when we went camping, too. I was so thrilled to see this one here! It's very good and my children--now all adults--were thrilled to have them, again, too!!

I used thick rolled oats and it turned out a little too chewy. Next time I will try quick oats. Good tasting and healthy. My toddler likes them :)

I LOVE these pancakes, and I don't actually enjoy pancakes generally.  These get almost a savory aspect, I think because of the tang of the buttermilk, and crispy texture thanks to the corn meal.  Great texture and flavor.  I make an easy berry syrup from an allrecipes recipe, and the combination is just delicious.

Adult approved, but the kids weren't sure.  They ate them all, but complained that there were different.  Well, of course they are! I like that I can feel better about feeding something more healthy to them!

Great multi-grain pancakes. Good flavor and texture. Maybe not the best recipe for you if you like fat, fluffy, doughy pancakes.

This is a very good recipe. Made a few alterations as I prepared. But then I always do that. A bit more flour, a little less milk, extra egg makes for thicker fluffier pancakes. Make sure not to over mix and let mix sit a bit before grill.

We make these according to the original recipe and they cook beautifully.  We make them at least once a week.  So much better for you than the other.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe for a hearty stick to your ribs kind of breakfast.  After reading reviews about it being runny, I used  rounded measurements of the oats (I used a multi-grain hot cereal) and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and it wasn't runny at all.  I used a 1/4 measuring cup to scoop out the batter and 2 small pancakes was enough to satisfy me.  To top it off, I made a blueberry and banana sauce for the win.

Just tried this recipe and thought it was great.  Loved the texture added by the oat and corn meal.  The pancakes were slightly thinner than many recipes, but I prefer pancakes that way anyway.  You can adjust the milk down a little if you prefer thicker pancakes.

The recipe was too thin and runny and had to be cooking a long time to resemble pancake texture. Not the best recipe.

Great recipe. Nice texture and holds up well under butter and syrup. Adding blueberries would be great.
