I would highly suggest you watch the webisode prior to making this recipe!!!  This recipe for all it's effort, is delightful and if you have all of the ingredients at hand, is a breeze to make.  I was able to find the crème fraiche, and HIGHLY recommend that you make every attempt to procur this, as it has a texture all of it's own.  To try to use any other substitute will not be comparable.  I would NOT suggest using whipping cream, as whipping cream doesn't have the same texture as crème fraiche, the closest -texture wise to crème fraiche is sour cream, but to get the taste of crème fraiche you'll want to mix sour cream AND whipping cream, I would suggest 2 Tablespoons of sour cream, and 1 Tablespoon heavy whipping cream.  If you notice the webisode, she speaks of using chicken thighs - I don't pretend to know why, but imagine this would be due to the thigh having more fat thus it won't be dried out, like a breast would.  This had GREAT plate appeal (see picture I submitted) and it tasted phenomenal!!!!  Thank you Allrecipes for the webisode, and thank you contributor for having shared a delightful recipe!!!

(Update 18 Jan 2015) I've made this three times now and it's amazing! It is a special meal so I don't make it all the time, and to the person who gave it a low review, you likely messed up. Please don't downgrade a recipe if your cooking is not up to par. This is far from bland, and you're just needing additional kitchen skills.

It's true that this is not a quick meal but totally worth the time if you want something special. It was AMAZING! I followed the recipe as written except used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. The single solitary little clove seemed silly until I tasted it and realized it is was a magical little clove that added serious depth to the flavors. Delicious! I saved the stock and made chicken noodle soup out of it which also was wonderful.

This was a little too time intensive for a weeknight dinner but not impressive enough looking at the table to make for guests.
It was a little bland, it needed something.  But I liked the idea that I was cooking "French" food. :-) Thanks!

2 stars is generous for this recipe. It lacked the wow factor that would make me want to take the time involved with this recipe to cook it again. I cooked it exactly as the recipe read exept I only used chicken breasts. While we ate it, all in the family thought it was bland, and dry without tons of the sauce poured over top. I even went the exrea mile to make creme frache as recommended in the video. Sorry, not my favorite. Maybe iI will check back to see what other suggestions people make.

As others have said, this is time consuming but totally worth it!  I actually really enjoyed making this, all the steps, while many, were easy and there is plenty of time for wine in between steps! My family really enjoyed this and we felt very french while eating it! Tastes fresh and was great with broccoli and french bread ( or really flaky biscuts)!

Wasn't horrible but not memorable either and I have to agree with the other reviewers it's pretty bland. The meats not dry at all if you know how to cook but I expected much more from the sauce after all the work that went into it.

I watched the video, and made the recipe with 2 breasts, 5 thighs, 2 drumsticks (all bone-in, skin on). I also used creme fraiche.  I thought the dish was flavorful and quite good.  When I make this dish again, I think I would only use the thighs, as that meat turned out the best.  The breasts seemed a bit dry to me.  Yes, it took some time to prepare, but I was very happy with the results.

Very delicious and would make again! Had all day to make this so I simmered the stock a bit longer after taking out the chicken, then refrigerated and skimmed some fat off the top. I had 3 pounds of chicken thighs so that's what I used, and it took more than 2 T of flour. This was awesome, might only add more mushrooms next time, thanks for the recipe!
