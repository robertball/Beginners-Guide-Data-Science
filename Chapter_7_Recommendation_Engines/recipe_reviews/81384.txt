My neighbor's whiney little 7 year old stopped in as these were getting done. He hung around until I offered him a taste (He's like Mikey - He hates EVERYTHING). As it turned out, a taste wasn't enough. He asked for some in a bowl - which I gave him. He left and a few minutes later, the phone rang - it was his mom wanting the recipe. This isn't my review - it's Kenny's. Thanks for sharing!!

I've used this recipe for years, but I substitute Smoked Pork Hocks or Salt Pork for the bacon. If using the pork hocks, use whole and then cut the meat off and return it to the pot when finished cooking. Excellent taste!

Being raised in the south I grew up on Collards but as an adult I had never cooked them until this year. I made them for New Years Day and they were great. My husband never had Collards and he loved them. My 28 year old daughter said that these were her new favorite dish. Needless to say I will be using this recipe quite a bit

I made this at my parent's house for Christmas and they love Collards greens - with ham hocks. I on the other hand don't like ham hocks so I was happy to try this recipe. They worried me to no end saying they didn't see any ham hocks, how are you cooking greens without ham hocks, do you want us to run out and get some for you? I was concerned the red wine vinegar may be too overpowering, but it was perfect. My entire family loved the greens and I caught my mom stashing some in the BACK of the freezer for later. Nice simple recipe, thanks so much! By the way, I added a small amount of crushed red pepper and I used hickory smoked bacon.

I served this as a side dish for a South American dinner and wine tasting we hosted and it was a huge hit - even those who thought they didn't like collards - liked these!  I only used about 1/4 tsp of cayenne and it had enough kick for us!

These greens are sooooo good! I can't believe that there are only 5 reviews for this dish. If I could I would give this ten stars. Definetly a keeper in my book.

Tasty but too spicy.  I would probably start with 1/2 tsp of cayenne and then add to taste.  I did mine in the crock pot for about 8 hours after browning the salt pork and onion in the pan.

I've been making this Brazilian collard recipe for a year now. Finally getting around to review it. This is the only way I will ever do collard greens. Works well with Mustard, turnip, and Kale also. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews and how people just loved this recipe I decided to take it to a dinner and it was not the hit of the party, in fact it was the opposite! Won't be making that again!

I grew up in the south eating collards.  These are the best I've ever made/had.  Our family absolutely loves them.  Can't believe there are so few reviews of these - try them!

I attended the Wine Tasting/South American Food Party, and these collards were the best I've ever had! Tender, flavorful, no bitterness at all- enjoyed by everyone there! Excellent as leftovers too, since I was able to take the little bit left, home with us(G). Yummy!  Lisa

we got collard greens in our CSA and my not being very fond of southern food was so excited to find this recipe.  We couldn't find peppered bacon so we used side meat (cooked twice as much needed to get the fat content and saved the rest of the meat to make a scramble in the morning).  It was so flavorful with a little bit of spice.  I think we found a recipe for any time we get collards again!

These greens ROCK!! I gave the recipe to my mother and she made them exactly as written only she used "peppered salt pork" (all we could find)so she didn't use quite as much as called for. You can adjust the "kick" with the cayenne pepper. My 7 year old granddaughter ate two helpings. This will be my new greens recipe. Thanks for sharing.

My own "Brazilian Collards" were so salty!!! This was quite a surprise because I did use low-salt (50% reduced salt) bacon instead of the bacon I usually buy (salt-free bacon from the butcher shop). I guess my chicken stock must have also been salty. I will definitely make this again because it has the potential to be very delicious. I will certainly be watching the "non-added salt" though. Thank you Javagoddess for sharing your recipe.

WOW!  These collards are excellent.  I served them at a big family dinner.  Everyone raved about the dish.  My father who's been making collards since before I was born asked me for the recipe.  That's a HUGE compliment!  If I make them again when there will be a lot of kids I may half the cayenne pepper so the collards can be enjoyed by the little ones as well.  Thanks for this great, great recipe!!!

I grew up on all types of greens but these were AWESOME! I love the smokey spicy flavor and the red wine vinegar took just enough of the bitterness away without depriving the green of its fresh garden taste.Love it!

I go light on the cayenne since my family isn't into a lot of spice. And I use a crockpot, it makes less liquid and turns out wonderfully!

Delicious! Served with Hoppin John and corn bread for New Years Day. You'll need to use a large stockpot to be able to stir the collards prior to them cooking down.

I like traditional southern collards, but wanted to try something a bit different - voila! This is it! I've had it with bacon, but also used pork cutlets. Either way is delicious! Highly recommended!

I recently tried collards at a restaurant and was looking for a recipe that would mimic those collards and this is pretty closer. I used Hickory bacon, apple cider vinegar, and about a teaspoon or less of sugar. I love this recipe and will make again. I like a little 'bite' to my collards and the time listed was perfect for that. If you like your collards more tender you may need to allow for more time.

Made this dish with kale from the garden. Didn't have wine vinegar so used a mixture of cider vinegar and cooking sherry.Big hit, definitely will be making again.

The best collards I've ever had -- and I'm from Tennessee, so I've had lots. I've never served it to anyone who didn't love it. Even if you think you don't like collards, give these a try.

These the best! I make especially for New Year's Day. You can use any type of greens. This recipe is not the healthiest use of greens but for a splurge... so worth it! I have made this recipe without using pepper bacon and added freshly cracked pepper.

5 Star! Love these, best collards I've ever had. So good my super picky husband ate them and actually liked them. I used regular bacon(it's what I had on hand), and only used 1/4 of the cayenne, it was just the right amount of kick! I used 2 1/4 cups of chicken stock, only because I make and freeze my own and that's how I had it frozen...even with the extra chicken stock the collards were not soupy.

This was an excellent recipe. I didn't have any peppered bacon so I just used regular bacon and added a LOT of pepper. Not quite the same, I'm sure but still very good. Thank you for sharing.

I omitted the chicken stock and the wine vinegar. My husband doesn't like soupy collards. This recipe is very tasty and simple.
