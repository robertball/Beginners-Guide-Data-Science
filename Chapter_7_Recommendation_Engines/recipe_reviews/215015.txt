I cut this down to two servings used a frozen banana used Starbucks Cafe Verona blend coffee and kept the chocolate syrup the same. (I did use sugar free chocolate syrup.) I didn't need as much ice because I used the frozen banana. My husband was kind of meh about it but I thought it was great as did my kids. (They made no bones about finishing off Daddy's cup.) This one's a keeper! NOTE: I usually keep a pitcher of premade coffee in my fridge. I used cold coffee in this recipe. I learned from working for Seattle's Best that if you don't want to water down your coffee you usually will use cold coffee or add your cold milk then coffee.

This was good. I think it would be better if the coffee was brewed and then chilled for a while before serving over ice. Because as soon as I poured the fresh coffee mixture over the ice the ice immediately melted and there was a weird combo of warm/cool spots throughout. Good taste though.:)

I only used one cup of coffee with 3 cups of water and it turned out a little bland... I was just afraid of it being too coffee-y. Next time I'll definitely do the full amount. It has a very refreshing taste.

I tried this for the first time yesterday. I mixed it up a bit wrong according to the recipe and loved it! lol Today I made it according to the recipe and didn't like it as much. It's good but I liked it better yesterday. Yesterday I made the coffee and set it aside then I blended the ice cubes approximately 1 cup of frozen banana 1 1/2 scoops chocolate whey protein and 2 oz. almond milk. I didn't use the chocolate syrup since I have the chocolate whey. Blend at a pulse just a little then pour over hot coffee mix a little and enjoy!
