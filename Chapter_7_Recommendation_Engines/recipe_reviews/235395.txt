I doubled this and made my own apple pie spice. My crescents needed a little longer to bake, mine weren't done until almost fifteen minutes. After letting this cool, I served them with vanilla bean ice cream. Eight thumbs up, my whole family loved them. I will make this again.

The dessert was a big hit, I added a Caramel drizzle for a little extra richness. Served warm and just a dalup of whip. I would blanch my apples a little next time for a softer apple. (microwave bowl dash of lemon for about 2-3 min.)

It took more than 10 minutes to prepare but it is really good.  Yes, it is high in calories but it certainly tastes better than a doughnut!

I will definitely make it again. I went BIG, used the large cresent rolls, using two making a large rectangle.  Lined up 5-6 slices apple per roll up. Ingredients wise, the same - butter, cinnamon, & brown sugar. Thanks Pillsbury,  it's delicious by itself or served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Drizzled w/ Chocolate! And, this is a cinch to make. 
Thanks,  Brenda

I made this recipe using two of the triangles together to form a rectangle. Sprinkled the sugar and spice onto the dough. I cut the apple into slices and placed them all along the rectangle and rolled them up. So fast and easy and delicious. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe is a super easy way to enjoy an apple pie taste w/o all the hard work. I have made it with different types of apples.  Very good, simple recipe.

I really loved these and so did my family. They are a great little dessert and you can make them healthier. I used the 90 calorie crescent rolls and I didn't use as much sugar but added some cinnamon. They turned out great. Will defiantly make these again.

Love, love, love this! So easy and quick to make.  Love the slightly saltiness from the crescent roll mixed with sweetness of the brown sugar, spices, and apple. I tried it with vanilla bean ice cream and without. I actually liked it better without.

Delicious, but how can you go wrong with the ingredients used?  I would have liked for my apples to soften a bit more.

Eh. The apples were a bit too hard. It tastes wonderful but wasn't easy to eat.

Great recipe. When I make it again Iâ€™m going to cut the apples smaller and wrap the dough around that.

I did not need to use the whole dry mix inside of the rolls.  Just slice the apple, don't chop.

Excellent easy dessert! I did decide to caramelize the apple mixture in the stovetop, and added almond extract as well, and it worked like a charm. My fiance gobbled them down! Next time I'll make more and save some for ice cream topping.

We made this for a breakfast treat. It turned out great! The dough was soft and fluffy. The apple had a bite without being mushy. I didn't have apple pie spice so I made my own with cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.

I mixed the spices and apples before putting them in the rolls, also the bigger Cresent rolls. It allowed the rolls to almost seal shut. Topped it with with whipped cream and it was a big hit with the guys in my family.

This was so simple and so delicious! Doubled the recipe and glad I did. They didn't last long.
