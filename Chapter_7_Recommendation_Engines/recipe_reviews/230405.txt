What a delicious, hearty root soup!  My husband does not like fennel, so we used marjoram and it was a complete hit.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this without the beets (gold ones not in this area) and without fennel.  I just wanted to make this hearty soup!  It was delicious!

Love it - very yummy and substitutions do not subtract from it. Saved it and will make again. I did need another cup of broth.

Awesome!  I used a red beet instead of golden beet, a turnip instead of a rutabaga, and dal instead of whole lentils.  I also used low-sodium "not chicken" vegetarian broth.  No one flavor stands out, but they blend harmoniously.  It was super and we will definitely be making this again!

Cut down on the sodium by halving the broth and adding 2 cups of water instead. Added about a tablespoon of vinegar (before the lentils), a teaspoon of celery salt and a tablespoon of fresh-ground marjoram. No fennel, so the marjoram was definitely a different flavor, but so tasty! Used regular beets because that's what we had, so the color was fun too.

The taste was very different but good.  I don't use root vegetables very often so I followed the directions very closely. Even before I started to let it simmer there was very little liquid to cook 1 C of lentils.  I ended up adding at least two cups of broth.  It simmered for over an hour and lentils were just done.
