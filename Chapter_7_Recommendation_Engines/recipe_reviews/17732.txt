I love pork chops so I make them once a week for my family.(they like them, too) No matter what I bread them with- crackers, bread crumbs-the secret is buying thin,lean pork chops and cooking them in a 400-425 oven for 15-20 minutes.  I spray the pan with cooking spray and turn the chops after 10 min.  They come out brown on the outside and juicy in the inside. I hope this information is helpful. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I read the other reviews and it seems like the only negative remarks were that the coating did not stick well and that the chops are too rich. With this in mind (and always thinking of the fat and calories!) I used just 1/2 cup of melted margarine mixed with 3/4 cup of buttermilk. The chops were just wonderful. I did have some coating left but only about a cup so I think the buttermilk makes the coating stick better. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The chops were very moist and very tasty. I would not hesitate to seve this to guests. Thanks Marilyn for sharing this Great recipe.

I eyeball a lot of ingredients when cooking and this recipe was no exception. I had a package of 6 pretty thin boneless pork chops and decided that 3 cups of saltines and two cups of cheese was way too much! I crushed up one package of crackers and used about a half cup of parmesan cheese. This still ended up to be too much but not by much. I'm always trying to reduce the fat and calories in my meals so I used a half cup of margarine instead of one of butter. I also found that after dipping the chops and coating them in the cracker mixture, that pushing the mix into the chops really helped to make it stick well. I have a gas stove that I'm still learning about (we just moved in) and it took 19 minutes at 400 degrees for them to cook through. I flipped them at ten minutes (as per another reviewer) and they were moist and very flavorful--not dry at all! My husband and I were very happy...Superb!

Marilyn this recipe is great.  I used 1 1/2 cups Ritz crackers instead.  I used 1 cup of parmesan cheese since the other reviews said they had too much breading.  I also took another suggestion from another reviewer and used a 1/2 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of buttermilk.  I also seasoned my porkchops with a little accent, unseasoned meat tenderizer, pepper and a little seasoned salt and let it sit for an hour before I started the recipe.  I made 7 pork chops.  Oh My! Absolutely Awesome.  My Husband and Kids Loved it.  I was looking for something different and this did it!  Thank you again Marilyn!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years, and it's one of my favorites.  It's quick and easy, and I love that it has a different flavor than most recipes.  I always line my baking pan with some of the breading, mostly the crackers, and then sprinkle more over the top.  That helps make the chops crispier, but I have never even come close to using all the breading mixture. I only use enough butter to coat the chops once, more than that and it gets soggy.

These were very good! I too cut the breading mixture in half, and baked mine on my pampered chef pizza stone.  I'd definately make these again!!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I put the chops under the broiler for 5 minutes at the end because they got quite soggy while baking.

I love pork chops. I would recoomend thin pork chops as the "most helpful" review suggested. The breading was a tad soggy. I had thicker pork chops and think this is the reason. Decrease the breading mixture. I will make again to attempt to give it 5 stars.

Absolutely devine - I've made this recipe a few times now, though I cut it down to serve just two or three people. The original recipe has too much leftover "batter."

These were so delicious!  I cut the recipe down based on past reviews.  I used 6 thin-cut sliced pork chops.  2 cups of saltines and 1 cup of parmesan cheese.  I used 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of butter to dip the pork chops in.  I cooked them at 400 for 30 minutes and they were done.  Very juicy and delicious!  My fiance loved them and ate 3 pork chops!  I made with quartered red potatoes shaken in a coating of olive oil, garlic and rosemary.  Cooked them on a baking sheet while the pork chops were cooking.  Great compliment to the dinner.  Then I served a steamed vegetable.  Very simple, easy, home style dinner.

The chops were tasty but the measurements are incorrect.  One cup of butter was way too much, I ended up throwing half a cup of butter in the trash.  And it was the same thing with the crackers.  This recipe is definitely an easy 4 stars but I can't go that high due to the wasted food.

As always, I followed the recipe exactly as provided so that I can provide my honest opinion.  The recipe calls for way more crackers and parmesan than is necessary.  The coating would not stick at all so I did my best to make a layer of coating under the pork chops and then made a layer on top, and had leftover crumbs.  The coating had an odd smell when I pulled the chops out of the oven.  While they were edible, they weren't good.  This one is not a keeper for me.

Delicious! I thought the recipe looked great, but I didn't have everythng on hand. I used 2 cups of Panko (so crunchy and delicious), 1 cup of grated Parmesan, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 T of Italian seasoning for the breading. Baked for 15 minutes on each side at 425 and got rave reviews from the hubby. Thanks!

I only use 3 chops, so halved the ingredients, but still found I had too much butter and crumbs over, otherwise it was really delicious.

My family loved it.  I did not have enough Parmesan Cheese so I halved it with grated mozzarella.  It made a hole load of coating, so I froze half.  You can easily half the coating mix.

Dug this out of my recipe file after printing it out in 2001 but never trying it.  Wish I had gotten on-line to read the recent reviews.  I too had the problem of them being a bit soggy.  I'll try the broiler tip next time.  The taste was awesome.  My VERY picky husband couldn't stop raving.  My 5 yr. old who never eats pork chops ate these.  I realized it was way too much coating, so I put half in a zip lock bag before using to save for later.  Will definately be making again and again.

The taste of these pork chops were great! BUT, as others said WAYYYYY to much coating!! I am giving only a 3 because of the waste of coating. I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and only used 1 1/4 cups at that. Only 1/2 cup butter is needed and 3/4 cup parm. cheese.  I will make them again the way I made them

they were a bit dry for my taste - perhaps it was the breading or the cut, maybe a lil bit of both.  but it was so easy that i'd like to give it another shot with a different cut - will update!

These are great pork chops, easy to make and delicious. As other reviewers have said, there's a lot of crumb mixture left over. This time, using 4 pork chops, I cut down the crackers to 1 C with 2/3 C Parmesan, left the Italian season at 1T and the garlic powder at 1/4 t. There was still 1/2 C of crumb mixture left over, but that was better than the 1st time I made this recipe. I used 1/4 C Butter, which was perfect for the 4 chops. Also sprinkled with a little salt and pepper before dipping in the butter. I cut the time to 10 min each side at 425.

I reduced the breading mixture to 2/1 and kept the seasonings the same but still had extra breading.  Pretty easy but flavorful meal.

Tasty.  Had an issue getting the breading to crisp up and needed to give it a few extra minutes under the broiler.

Its delicious, but the coating did fall off & wasnt as crispy as Id like it. But that can all be altered for the next time I make it. And I will cut the saltines & parm cheese down to half what it calls for, I threw away A LOT of that mixture. But it was delicious & I'll try it again.

Very good! There is way too much breading, if you ask me... I cut the recipe in half and had about 3x as much breading as I needed. Thanks :)

Wonderful!! Even hubby who dosen't like pork chops loved them.  I've made them a few times now and have modified the recipe slightly to our tastes.  Didn't have butter once so I coated the pork chops in mayo, think we liked them better that way.  I also cook them on my pizza stone and they come out sooo crispy.

These were so delicious that I ate the extras left over and I never do that!!! I read that everyone had extra coating so I double dipped them. Dipped them first in egg, then crumbs, then butter, then crumbs. I really didn't have that much left over. SOOOO YUMMYYY!!!!!!!!!

Was great, very yummy, but would have been nice if the recipe said crush crackers to fine crumbs(would have stuck better to meat)  once coated and in pan I took a bunch more of the coating and sprinkled it over the chops. I mixed up the dry ingredients and put half into another bowl as it made way to much(that's with cutting down the recipe to 3 servings).  I used this remaining coating and used it on chicken I baked a few days later, kept the coating mix in a tupperware in the fridge. Had this with the Broccoli and Stuffing Casserole on this site  excellent!

my husband loves these, and gets excited when i say i'm going to make them.. i always make the full amount of coating, use half on the pork chops, and then freeze the other half for another time (i've had it in the freezer for over a month at a time and it stays just as good) this coating also works really well for fish (i've used it on pickerel and perch)

Absolutely delicious!! This is so simple and quick to make. I made it with whole grain Waverly crackers because I always have those on hand. I use my cast iron skillets and have no problem with them sticking to the pan and losing the crust. I have made these at least 5 times since I first found this recipe, that is how good they are. Thanks for sharing!

BF LOVED this.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and halved the ingredients as most people have suggested.  Pressing the bread crumbs and broiling it during the last couple of minutes also helped make it crispier.

I made this because I didn't have a lot of time.  It was a good, basic recipe for a weeknight dinner.  As suggested, I turned the chops over after 10 minutes.  I suggest cutting the crackers and cheese amounts in half- too much of it goes to waste.

As my kids would say...these are "bangin". So far, these are the best pork chops I've ever eaten...I normally don't care for pork chops. I did make some changes but nothing drastic and they came out perfect.  I used Ritz crackers...1 1/2 sleeves crushed with rolling pin in baggie, 3/4-1 cup grating cheese and everything else stayed the same.  This was just enough coating for 10 thin chops...I sprinkled on top after put in pan, turned and sprinkled again.  I baked at 400 for 20 minutes turning after 10...the last 2 minutes of the final 10 I turned on broiler...I'll say again...best chops ever!

These pork chops were sooo good! Nice and juicy and such great flavor!  I used another reviewer's tip and sprayed the bottom of the dish with cooking spray and the crackers stayed crisp - no mushiness. Delicious - will def make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

It came out very good, instead of only butter, I mixed it with a little bit of milk.  Also, I sprayed PAM to the baking dish and the breading stayed all together.  I would do it again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Loved it!

I really enjoyed the flavor of these. I used whole wheat saltines, and dredged my chops in a beaten egg rather than butter. I also threw a packet of Italian salad dressing mix in with the breadcrumbs. Make sure you use the thin pork chops, mine were perfectly cooked in just under 30 minutes. I served the leftovers as sandwiches, and even my picky eater gobbled them up.

These were very good but the recipe proportions are way off.  I only had 4 pork chops instead of 6 so I used slightly less of everything and still threw away over half of all my unused ingredients.  Definitely try them - very easy!

Cut way down on the butter but kept everything else exactly the same. Delicious pork chops that the family devore. I have made this dish several times with the same fab results. I cut the butter down to 1/4 a cup melted and added a bit of milk then dip the pork chops in. Cuts down on the fat and calories and also saves butter.

This recipe deserves 5 stars for the fantastic flavor alone. However, the ingredient amounts are way too much! I only used 1 and a half cups of crushed saltines and just 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, and it was PLENTY!!! I still wound up with a lot left over to dispose of. I baked mine for 20 minutes and then flipped them over for the remaining 20 minutes more. They had a nice crispy crunch to them and were absolutely delicious! Simple to prepare and with great results... YUMMY!!!

This was really easy to pull together with staples I usually have on hand. 

I used fresh shredded parmesan and added
ground black pepper and onion powder. I took another cook's advice and did half melted butter with a 1/3 c. buttermilk to cut the richness a little. 

This was so good. And the whole family scarfed it, even the kids. My husband had THIRDS. 

This is going in the new rotation. Great
recipe!

EDITED TO ADD: Oh. And by the way, I used those round, buttery crackers instead of the saltines.

This was a really good recipe to add to my collection.  I did cut down on the ingredients and it came out perfectly w/o wasting anything.  I used 1 cup cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup parm cheese, 1 teas. Italian seas. and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  I only needed 5 Tblsp. of melted butter to completely cover all the chops.  They were quite large ones too.  The trick on the crackers to make them stick better and go farther is to make sure they are finely crushed.  They stuck right to the meat no problem!  Also, some have commented that it came out soggy.  I am not sure why this would happen but I didn't cover mine and they had a nice crisp coating.  No sign of any liquid or sogginess.  I didn't give this a 5 because I reserve that for  "to die for recipes", but these were great and I will add them to my regular meals!

These are one of my favorite comfort food dishes.  The only advice I have is to reduce the amount of "breading" and to add a touch more garlic powder.  We love this and will continue to use it all the time.  Thanks for the post.

I liked this recipe,  and so did my picky eater sons.  I wanted a crispier coating,  so I used 2 cups Panko and 1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Other than that,  followed the recipe exactly.  Using thin sliced, bone in pork chops,  I baked in the oven for the full 40 minutes,  and they did indeed come out crispy coating outside,  moist on the inside,  and very tasty!

The cooking time and temp is way off for this recipe. I cooked them at 425 for 25 mins and they were way over cooked. If I make them again, I'd cook them at 350 for 30 minutes or until the thermometer reads 145/150.

It was pretty good. It needed to be more crunchy, and I would use a little less Italian seasoning. It was a bit strong.

Absolutely wonderful...Had to make a couple of changes as I did not have crackers, so I used Panko breadcrumbs....Hubby won't eat anything with parmesan, so had to leave it out...Other than that, I followed the seasonings & measurements...it was perfect for 8 chops!  The coating was crunchy & not soggy at all...First time ever for me....Thank you!!!!  :)

WOW!!  These are the best pork chops I have ever eaten.  Love, Love, Love this recipe.  Even my 6 yr old raved about them.  This has already been deemed a family favorite and I envision making these tasty pork chops on a regular basis. Yummy.

hubby loved these!  great flavor to the coating.  i chose to use boneless pork sirloin chops instead of regular pork chops, but this coating could work with virtually any cut of meat.  thanks!

Not bad, but 5 cups of breading for 6 pork chops?  I'm wondering if this was scaled down and the scaling didn't translate well or something.  I used 1/3 of the ingredients, and used bread crumbs instead of saltines, and I still had enough for a thick breading on 4 pork chops and 4 pieces of chicken, plus a little leftover that I'll use on something in the near future.  The bottom does get soggy, so I'd suggest flipping as other reviewers did.  Not a bad weeknight meal, but nothing really special.  I served with mashed potatoes and salad.  thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I thought it was delicious.  The house smelled so good while it was baking that we couldn't wait to have dinner.  Because I had no crackers, I used 2 cups Italian bread crumbs and 1/2 cup butter for six pork chops.  The butter was gone but I had lots of bread crumb mixture left.  I will definitely make this again and would not hesitate to make it for guests.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good recipe!  Thanks!  Agree with other users that coating does not stick well unless you press it into the meat.  Would add a pinch more garlic next time, but otherwise very good!

These are the best pork chops I have ever had! I  eyeballed all the ingredients and didn't have Italian seasoning so used garlic power, black pepper and oregano - they turned out great! I just ate one cold for lunch and it may have been even better than last night. Great recipe - thanks!!

These were the most moist melt in your mouth chops I have ever made! I only had 4 chops so I halved the recipe and still had some left over. I didn't have saltines so I used whole wheat Ritz crackers. I had some trouble getting the breading to stick so I dredged it again after one coat of breading and then rebreaded and it worked great. I cooked them at 425 for 20 minutes and flipped them at the half way point. In the end to get the coating really crisp I broiled the chops flipping once and it was great. A definite keeper for me!

I used italian breadcrumbs and parmeasean cheese. I season the chops with seasoning salt, chilli powder and pepper first. Great taste but the coating did not coat great, but good enough!

This was great!! My husband usually isn't a fan of pork chops, but he loved these. I followed the recipe exactly for my family, but skipped the butter for me (I'm on Weight Watchers). Even my kids loved these pork chops! For myself, I dipped the chop in fat free milk first rather than the butter to cut out some fat and I thought it was really great that way, too! I did taste the butter version....out of this world!

Loved this recipe! It is so delicious. I will be making this again since my whole family loved it, even my picky son. The only thing that I did differently was I used bread crumbs in a can because I didn't have any saltine crackers. I didn't have any problems with the coating staying on the pork chops.

I really liked this recipe. It was very easy to make and the only down side that I can think of is that the coating recipe makes way to much I would probably cut it in half if I made it again. Other than that the chicken was very moist and the coating complimented the texture very well.

I made this reciepe for my family and they loved it.  I did add seasoning salt and a little extra garlic it coma out good.  The only thing is I should have turned them over so that the bottoms would have not been soggy but other then that they turned out really good.  My husband who is a cook said they were good and I did a good job.

These were great! I did half the breading mix and still had a little too much, but I just dumped it on and baked them. They were yummy with homemade applesauce!

These came out very well served with spaghetti and meat sauce.  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings and added extra Italian seasoning.  I had enough butter and topping to cover 8 boneless loin chops.  I don't know why the recipe calls for so much of the ingredients.  I baked for 30 min and then turned the broiler on for 5 min to crisp them up.  Excellent.

I thought the breading was excellent! That might be because I added garlic salt and pepper to the cracker mix. I followed it as was stated. I did read the reviews and knew the chops could be soggy. I added some of the leftover cracker mix on the bottom of the pan to help soak up the extra moisture. I made sure I really pressed my chops into the mixture to make sure the crackers stayed on. I would definitely make this recipe again!

My dad and I wanted to try something new with pork chops so i found this recipe.We didn't know how it was going to come out but when it was cooked it smelled soo good.We liked how the prok chops were still juicy and the flavors of garlic and the other spices tasted together.

I used the same ingredients & I seasoned by eye, but there definitely weren't any left overs.  My boyfriend looked at me like he fell in love all over again. Thanks!

I took the advice of another reviewer and used thin chops.  I only had 3 so I cut the recipe in half.  I ended up with quite a bit of leftover cracker mixture so I will cut down on that next time.  I also only used 1/2 a stick of butter (1/4 cup) and that was the perfect amount.  I baked at 400 for 30 min.  My only complaint was that mine didn't turn golden brown like in the picture.  I will make again.

The first time I made this I put the crackers in a baggie and crushed them. They seemed to fall off the chops that way. The next time I made them I put the crackers in the food processor and they didn't fall off at all. I also took suggestions from other reviewers and used Ritz crackers, thin pork chops on the bone and buttermilk to dip them in before breading them. Super yummy!

This is a great recipe, particularly for boneless, lean chops. I have tenderized the chops with meat mallet first. Then instead of butter, sprayed meat with Olive oil, coated first with beaten eggs, then with Parmesan/Cracker mixture. Cooked 12 minutes on each side. Result simply divine, crispy outside, extremely soft, and moist inside, and much lighter fat-wise.  I have modified the recipe by omitting butter, and tenderizing the chops a little with a meat mallet

These were alright.  The flavor wasn't too bad, but they got soggy. I read other reviews about them being soggy, and I was really careful to keep them as dry as possible - and they still got soggy. Make sure you use thin porkchops - mine were pretty thick and the pork overpowered the seasoning.

Delicious. My kids think they had chicken :) I did use 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of olive oil and 1/2 c of buttermilk as suggested by somebody. You can reduce the dry ingredients b/c you'll end up with a lot of it left. I used butterflied pork chops.

This is a great recipe for coated pork chops and I love that they are baked (instead of frying them). I didn't have butter or margarine on hand (what kind of cook runs out of those?!... me) so I just did an egg wash and it worked well for me. The coating was flavorful and very delicious. My chops were very thin boneless kind and I overcooked them a little so they were a tad dry for my taste but when I make them next I will try a thicker cut of chop, I'm sure the recipe had nothing to do with the dryness. I will probably continue using the egg wash instead of butter. Very good! Will make SEVERAL times more

I have never really enjoyed porchops, but this recipe kept them moist and delicious! I'm a huge ranch dressing advocate so I drizzled a little ranch on top which made them even better.

Loved this recipe.  So simple, so delicious.  A few changes.  I had to use 1/2 italian seasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 ritz wheat crackers crushed, dried minced garlic, oregano, parsley.  Other than that..it worked wonderfully and the meat was tender and tasty!  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and delicious...this is a nice alternative to shake and bake!  I took another posters advice and only used 1/2 the butter and about 3/4 cup buttermilk to dip pork chops in before coating with crumb mixture...turned out great!

I changed this quite a bit...I took inspiration from my own personal chicken parmesan recipe for the breading. For four bone-in chops I used about a quarter cup of parmesan, a quarter cup of italian breadcrumbs and a quarter cup of crushed italian croutons.  My solution to getting the breading to stick was I used one beaten egg yolk with about 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  Once breaded I also spinkled on some garlic powder, then baked them at 425 for about 17 minutes.  I generally loathe pork chops, but actually this wasn't too bad, and my roomate and boyfriend loved it.

I Used seasoned croutons because I didn't have saltines or bread crumbs on hand. Turned out amazing!!! I just crushed the croutons and added grated Parmesan and a little more basil and oregano. super easy and very tasty! i also used less butter than called for and they turned out great! even my 13month old loved the pork chops If I don't make this again my husband will disown me ;)

My mom said these were the best prock chops she had ever had. I can't use parmesan, because my dad is allergic, so I substituted some finely shredded mozarella. I also drizzled a little bit of the melted butter over the top before baking and turned them halfway through. Definitely a keeper.

I added seasoning salt, and instead of saltine crackers I used italian bread crumbs. I also seasoned the pork chop before I dipped them in the butter. Turned out great! Thanks

Great! I used Ritz Crackers and instead of dipping in butter I dipped the chops in skim milk. The breading stuck just fine. Then I put a few small pieces of butter on top of the pork chops. Baked for about 20 minutes and bam. They were great.

We LOVED this. I used fat-free saltines, because that's just what we keep in the pantry, and I put a baking rack in the baking dish. I did use the one reviewer's suggestion of using a combination of melted butter and buttermilk. I had some fairly thick chops, so it took a little longer to get them to the desired internal temperature, but the coating was nice a crisp. We will definitely be having this again. In fact, I was just told "you really out did yourself with this one", so thanks for a really fantastic recipe!

This recipe is great! I'm not a big fan of pork chops, but my husband loves them and this is a recipe that we both love! I used ritz crackers and also dredged the meat in a mixture of butter and olive oil. I added some spices to the meat before coating them. I took the advice of others and reduced the breading. I used 1 cup of crackers and 3/4 cup of parm cheese. It was plenty. I cooked 15 min on each side and then put them in the broiler for a couple of minutes to make the coating crispy. They were great!

Wow! This is one of the BEST pork chop recipes I have ever had! WAY to much butter. I halved the butter, and still had too much. Save your stick! Yummy :). I will definitely make this again.

Not sure what the secret is but all I was left with was soggy breading!  The chops were still edible so it wasn't a complete flop but they weren't at all what I was hoping for.  Still on the hunt for a CRUNCHY pork chop recipe...

I decided to use regular bread crumbs instead of the saltines.  The pork chops were wonderful and enjoyed by all.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe ROCKS!!  I did add some fresh parsley & oregano to the cracker mixture.  Instead of dipping the chops in just buter, I did a tblsp. of butter and a tblsp. of olive oil.  I cut down on the crackers too.  I will make this recipe again and again!

Thank you!! I had almost given up on making pork chops. My husband and I find them just too tough and often bland no matter which way we make them. I even began sticking to only 'rib' chops because they seem a little more tender. I stocked up when I actually found them on sale. Made them a couple times and was just not impressed. I had a last batch to use (with nothing else in the house) so decided to try one last recipe. This one was easy and Delicious! Everyone including my young boys loved them. I used Ritz because it's what I had and halved the amount of cracker mix which was still plenty. (Oh, and I cut off the bone just to fit more in the pan).

This was a great recipe.  So easy too!  I did use italian bread crumbs instead of crackers and really liked the flavor.

This was very easy to make. I halved the breading as suggested and still had plenty. I also substituted Ritz crackers. This is a nice change to the standard breaded pork chop. Everyone loved it!

These chops turned out really good.  I cut the breading down by 1/2 (as suggested by others)and still had lots left over, however.  I reduced the butter a lot too-I used about 1 1/2 T. for 2 pork chops.  Once they were ready to be baked, I drizzled the leftover butter on top.  This sealed the breading on pretty well.  I will surely be trying this recipe again.

This is the bomb!!! My family and I really loved this recipe.  The ingredients are so easy to put together, because I already had them. I did make a few ajustments. I put half cracker and half corn flakes for the breading.The crackers did come out somewhat soggy, but the corn flakes kept it crunchy.  I also added some of my own seasoning for more flavor.  This recipe will be past down to my kids for future baking.

This recipe was fantastic.  I cut the recipe in half, cooking the 7/8" thick chops 
for around 35 min.  I had too much breading mixture left over after thoroughly
breading the chops, so I threw some extra on top, and still had some left over.
I also used bread crumbs instead of saltines.  A++

These were great!  My only complaints: 1.There was WAY too much coating mixture left over for 4 pork chops - I had to throw away nearly half of it. 2. The coating didn't stick very well.  3. The cook time was too long and mine were a little dry.  I will make these again but will need to make some modifications.

I don't eat Pork chops, but my husband does. He said they were the best he has had. I tried the breading and it was very good. Quite flavorful and moist while not soggy at the same time. Very Good.

I am always on the lookout for a good recipe to woo my hubby, especially a meat one. (The way to a Mans Heart is through his stomach you know) He absolutly loved them!!  His Mom is Italian, so its kinda hard to measure up, but with this recipe I found yet another meal that he raves about to others.  Thank you MHFAB1, This is a recipe that will stay in my "Favorites" section of my Cook book.

This is really pretty good. Taste is very similar to Shake N Bake. My pork chops were pretty thick, and they only needed cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. I did not load the coating on, and I also turned the pork twice while cooking and - didn't get soggy!

These are quite good, I changed the serving size to four pork chops, and had plenty of butter and cracker mixture leftover. So much in fact, I had to double check to make sure the adjustment was made.

I made these tonight (a modified version) for my boyfriend and I - and they were quite tasty and the pork was incredibly tender!  I only cooked for us so I scaled the recipe back for two. I tend to "eyeball" things vs. exact measurements - so if you think you'll need more or less - just adjust accordingly.

Very tasty dish. It is true, the crumb coating doesn't stick very well, but I just sort of scooped the coating up with the pork chop and it worked just fine. Making sure the crackers are crushed finely helps, too.

I do not understand all these good ratings.Made up chops strictly to this recipe..the parmesan added an acid background and chops were not really moist. Maybe better if cooked at lower temp.

I used one tube of saltines, and cut the other ingredients in half for 6 boneless pork chops.  It worked perfectly and was REALLY good!!

Loved this, though even with turning them over halfway through the bake time they were still a little soggy on the bottom. Next time I well try a slotted baking pan.

Great!  We used 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of butter and Panko bread crumbs instead of the saltines.  Just amazing, we're still talking about how good and easy they were this morning.

My husband and I have both always hated pork chops.  That being said, we LOVE these!

My 5 stars is based on three modifications that I made based on reviews:

I used THIN pork chops
Instead of Saltines I used Ritz crackers
I baked the pork chops for 15 minutes in a 425 oven, then lowered the heat to 400, flipped the chops, and cooked them another 10 minutes at the reduced temp.

We just got done eating these for the second time and they're definitely going to become a regular meal around here.  Bravo!

These were pretty good, just not fantastic. I only made up 1/2 the cracker mix and still had way too much!!!

Dipping pork in butter seemed like fat redundancy to me. So instead of butter, I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder and seasoned salt, then rubbed with mustard. I then let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before coating in the cracker crumbs. My fiance' likened the breading to Shake n' Bake which was very good for him. I used Ritz-style crackers instead of saltine because that is what I had in the house. I paired the pork chops with mashed potatoes and wilted spinach. Excellent!

Used Ritz crackers, halved crackers and cheese, doubled (at least) garlic powder. Used only enough butter to coat chops. Baked in 425 oven ten minutes on each side in glass baking dish, DELICIOUS!! will make again and again. Was worried about it being bland, but the amount of Italian seasoning seems just right, with a little less cracker/cheese mixture.

I did as many others and cut the butter in this recipe in half.  Also, I don't particularly like the taste of crushed saltines, and they add a lot of salt, so I used plain bread crumbs instead.  Used just 1 cup of dried parmesan.  As another reviewer noted, I pushed the crumb mixture into the chops which made it stick very well.  The pork chops cooked really fast, and tasted very good.  Would definitely make this again as noted.

Great recipe! Only thing is WAY to much breading.  You could 1/2 the amount and still have 2x as much as you need.

These are wonderful chops.  I changed the recipe up a bit after reading some of the reviews.  I had 4 good size chops so I used 1/2 stick of melted margarine and 3/4 cup of buttermilk. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs with the Parmesan cheese instead of crackers.  Instead of cooking them in a baking dish I placed them on an oven broiler pan which kept them from being soggy as I had seen on some of the reviews. They were yummy.  Will definitely cook these again.

This was my first time ever making pork chops and it was a HUGE success! My husband and another couple we had over absolutely loved them! I did dip the chops in egg rather than butter and it turned out well. There was definitely WAY TOO MUCH cracker mixture though! I only made about half of the mixture and I still had quite a bit left over! I'll definitely be making these again though! My husband requested that I add them to our weekly menu!  :)

This recipe tasted great and was very easy! I didn't have saltines or parmesan cheese so I used cornflakes for the breading and I put shredded mozzarella on top in the last 5 mins of baking. Everyone loved them! I will make these again!

I didn't have saltine crackers so I used butter crackers (Ritz).  This was delicious.  One member of our family isn't able to eat pork so I made a chicken breast with the same recipe.  It received rave reviews.  I think the recipe calls for too much butter--start with 1/2 cup and see if you need more.  It really was a delicious recipe

This was very good.  My family loved it.  The only complaint I have is it makes way more coating then it needs to be.  I could have coated 10 to 12 large pork chops with this recipe.  I am going to cut it way back next time.

This recipe was great. I usually don't like pork chops the way we make them, so I looked for something different and found this. It was SO good. I baked them for 3 mins and flipped them after 15. The only thing is that I didn't re-pam the pan before I set back down the flipped porkchops, so some of them stuck.

This was very good.  I did add more seasoning though.  The coating did fall off, I think I'll try adding the buttermilk next time as per other reviews.  I also only made half of the cracker mixture and only 1/2 c. butter.  It was more than enough.  Baked at 425 for 20 min. and flipped them half way through.  Perfect!  Not too tough or dry!  Thanks.

I must say I underestimated this recipe. At first it looked a little odd, but smelled really good in the oven, and the outcome was great! On the pork chops I sprinkled cumin, all seasoning, and I put the italian seasoning directly on it also instead of in the cracker mix ...and put bread crumbs in the mix also..My boyfriend gave me the 'oh my god its soo good' eyes on the first bite, so I'd say this is a keeper ;)

I'm a vegetarian so I never tried this recipe, however my husband and my friend gave this a 5* rating! It was also very simple to cook.

I like this recipe better with Italian bread crumbs.  Too much crackery taste, or maybe not enough seasoning.

This one's a winner!  I will reduce the breading mixture to half next time since I had tons left over!  I'll also reduce the butter to half for the same reason.  When I breaded the chops, I think I included too much of the fine crumbs, resulting in some sogginess -- next time I'll make sure I only use the coarser crushed pieces (they came out golden & crunchy).  I had no Italian Seasoning so I liberally sprinkled the breading with basil & oregano & it was still delicious! Highly recommended.

Good recipe to start with but too much cracker and too little seasonings.  Lessen the cracker a bit and add more seasonings (maybe double the italian seasonings?) and it will be a better recipe for those who are tired of "Shake and Bake".

Delicious, although I used thin chops and overcooked them a bit, it still had a great flavor.  Will make them again with thicker chops.  Thanks!

These were a nice and easy change from my usual fried pork chops. I used italian bread crumbs in place of the saltines. They were a bit soggy as other reviews state. But the taste was good, and it's a quick simple recipe. I will make these again, and hopefully figure out a way to crisp them up.

This was a good recipe.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and cut the recipe in half.  This still left a LOT left over so next time I will do a third of the recipe.  I also sprayed the bottom of the pan before cooking which definitely was helpful.  It is definitely a tasty recipe

This recipe is great! It is quick and easy. I have been making this recipe for some months by now. (I must have done it at least ten times) I followed the advice in the reviews about the crumble mixture and using thin pork chops. Also, I use bread crumbs rather than saltine crackers.

Made these with egg beaters. Too much egg & breading. But everyone loved them. Made them with regular bone-in chops. Never had made breaded pork chops before but will again.

I made this for my boyfriend last night, and both of us agree that these are the best pork chops we have ever had.  Judging from the other comments, I halved the recipe for the crumb mixture.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again!

Pretty good.  The good thing about this recipe is that I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.  I cooked 4 small pork chops and used 1/2 of the other ingredients.  I could have used 1/4 and still had plenty.  Hubby really liked it.

REALLY GOOD! and so easy! I read the previous reviews and only made half of the cracker mixture.  I poured about a cup out onto a plate and added more as needed.  I ended up with some leftover (that I hadn't put on the plate) so I put it in a bag in the fridge and will use it for chicken or fish (or something).  I only melted one stick of butter and that was just enough. I sprayed the tops of the chops with some cooking oil and I put the broiler on for the last few minutes and they browned up nice.  I will absolutely make these again!

My kids loved it!  My husband and I really enjoyed it too but were amazed at how much the kids loved it because they aren't big meat eaters typically.  My daughter loved it enough to request it for lunch the next day and ask that I make it again soon.  I cut the recipe down a third based on previous reviews and also combined butter and olive oil together for dipping the pork chops in.  An easy yet delicious meal!  Thank you!

I got this recipe MAYBE 2 weeks ago, and I can't even count how many times we've eaten it so far!!  A definite staple in my house now.  I tweak EVERY recipe I've ever come across to my family's taste, but the only thing I did to this one was pour the leftover melted butter in the pan between all of the chops.  YUMMMM!

These pork chops are so delicious. I made them with wheat crackers instead of the saltines, but they came out so very tender. I'll probably make them again after I finish eating the 2 I just made.

These are definitely a repeat.  The only thing I did differently was that I drizzled the chops w/ the leftover melted butter before placing them in the oven.  It made them crispier and easier to remove from the pan.

I used olive oil instead of butter and I brushed the oil on the pork chops.  I also seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper before rolling in the cracker and cheese mixture.  I baked this for 35 minutes in my oven and it was done!  Delicious! My husband loved this!

I used dijon mustard instead to bind the bread crumbs to the chops for a lighter version and it came out perfect. I will definatly make this again.

This recipe is very good.  I made a few modifications based on other reviewers and because I only had 4 chops.  I crushed about 1 cup of saltines, put 1/3 c parmesan cheese and eyeballed the other ingredients.  Also, I sprayed the pan with PAM and did not add the extra butter and they came out crispy.

These were great! I didn't have crackers so I used bread crumbs and added salt to them.  The flavor was great. I can't wait to try them with the crackers!

I tried making these, and they really didn't blow anybody away.  I did substitute bread crumbs for crackers b/c that's what I had, so that may have made a difference.  But the coating didn't get crisp at all...it was thick and gooey, and even the flavor was just so-so.  I don't regret trying it, but I probably won't make them again.

We didn't find anything remarkable about these chops.  They were easy to make and didn't taste bad, but they just weren't special.  I used the saltine cracers called for in the recipe and really didn't make any significant changes.

Excellent Chops!  We loved them and so did the kids.  I added about a tsp of Garlic Salt and 1 tbsp of Garlic Powder and 1/2 tsp Onion Powder to the cracker/cheese mixture.  Also I didn't add as much cheese about a cup.  I will definitely make this again!

There was nothing wrong with this recipe, it was just very bland in my opinion.  I scaled the recipe to 2, but the amount of crackers, cheese and butter still seemed like way too much. I used a 1/4 melted butter, 10 saltine crackers (which was still too much, 8 would have been sufficient) and 1/3 cup parmesan cheese (also too much, 1/4 cup would have been fine).  I also found that the butter didn't enhance the flavour of the pork chops at all, olive oil would work just as well.  In the end, the chops tasted fine, we just found them to be a bit boring.

This is a great pork chop recipe. The only changes we made are to change it to two servings and used Italian bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. We also put the breading ingredients in a zip-lock bag and shook the pork chops in it and then sprinkled more on top before baking. It is wonderful!!

This recipe turned out well and was very easy to do. I followed the directions exactly and the chops were very tasty. I only had three pork chops so I cut the recipe in half, and still had a TON of the cracker/parmesan mixture left over.

These were the best porkchops ever!! I made a 18 chops without increasing the breading ingredients, and froze 1/3 of them after breading but before cooking.  The ones from the freezer were just as delicious after they were baked as the fresh ones.  I didn't have enough saltine crackers so I used 1 cup of panko (Japanese Crispy Crumbs) and the chops were crisp and cheesy. I have already passed this recipe on to several of my friends and they love it.  Thanks so much for sharing this one- it is a keeper!!!  Jana.

This is a favorite at our house! I do cut the crackers/cheese mix in half since I had too much the first time I tried it.  My picky daughter LOVES it...and so does my DH.  Definitely a keeper!  Plus, the aroma from the oven is amazing:-)

I followed the recipe exactly.  I put a little extra breading on the top since there was a lot left, which may have been a mistake.  After 30 minutes the chops were juicy, but the coating was pretty mushy, with just a little browning.  If I make this again I won't put on extra breading.

Not for those on a diet but taste great. I used buttercheese crakers since I was out of saltines and cut the cheese to a half cup to two cups crumbs. Next time I will halve both again. I used five 1 1/4" chops and still had half of crumb mixture left. I think the secret is the hot 425 degree oven. Not soggy outside at all and moist inside.

Wow! These are absolutely awesome! This recipe makes a TON of breading, so what I did is I measured out only what I needed and saved the rest in the fridge in an air-tight container for later. This breading would taste great on chicken breasts too!  If you try them that way, make sure your oven is preheated to 350 degrees and you bake the chicken for an hour. These pork chops were so awesome my husband said they tasted like they came from a fancy restaurant!

Very good taste. I cut the breading amounts by 1/3, and used just 1/4 cup butter. I used center-cut boneless chops. The chops turned out perfect, crispy coating on the outside and still moist on the inside. I plan to try this with boneless chicken breasts too.

We're not huge fans of pork chops, but this is pretty good. We used boneless chops. Be careful not to overbake because these can get chewy very quickly. The coating is yummy. You don't need as much butter or breading as it calls for. Overall, I'd make this again.

I also cut the breading measurements in half per other reviewers. I still had alot of leftover! Chops came out quite pretty and golden. I just thought they were quite rich - I guess because of the butter. I would make them again but I would like to try it with margerine instead and see if that lightens the richness a bit.

REALLY delicious!!!!! I used boneless and very lean pork loin chops.  I did cut the breading/coating measurements by half of what the recipe called for, and still had some left over. (I read in another review of this recipe that the suggested amounts made too much) They turned out soooooooooo tender and tasty!  I will definately use this often and serve to company!!!  AWESOME!

This was delicious. I used cornflake crumbs instead of cracker. It made a little too much of the mixture though, seemed wasteful. My boyfriend isn't even a big fan of baked chops and he ate two!

This was so delicous!  Even though I didn't have the italian seasoning and the parm cheese, I had to substitute it with salt & pepper and mild chedder cheese--it was still great!  This may be the only way I cook porkchops for now on!

I LOVED this recipe! I used center cut boneless chops and freshly grated parm cheese and served it with a zucchini casserole and herbed noodles.
The pork came out very tender and had a wonderful flavor to it..... Thanks so much for this recipe!

Although I had to put them under the broiler briefly to get them browned on top (I think I got them too buttery/wet), they stayed very moist and tender.  It is a great recipe and will become a staple recipe for pork chops.

I just made this recipe and it was really wonderful. I made two chops (thick, bone-in, organic pork loin chops from Oregon) so I downsized the recipe. I used Club crackers instead of saltines, because that's what I had, and I used also some Italian breadcrumbs, about equal parts of each, plus garlic powder and parmesan as the recipe called for. I used a pastry brush to cover the chops in a lot of melted butter, and found that the breading stuck easily. I cooked them for half an hour, to 160 degrees, and served them with carrot-mashed potatoes and a caramelized apples. They were not crispy, which is totally fine. The breading with all that butter imparted a rich and wonderful flavor into the meat, which came out very juicy, but also beautifully browned, with a delicious sauce from the drippings as well. I liked that this recipe didn't ask me to transfer a pan from the stove, since I don't currently have an oven-safe pan. I will make this again, yum.

Pretty great!  I adjusted for Gluten-free and to lessen waste of ingredients.  I used 1/2 cup of a Gluten-free all purpose flour blend, 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 tbsp italian, and 1/4tsp garlic. Double dipped in 1/2 cup butter and the blend.  sprinkled mix with salt (next time I'll remember to mix it in the coating blend., baked as instructed.  They came out moist, tender and delicious.  My kids and hubby gobbled them up right along with me.

I made this for my family for Sunday dinner and it was great. The whole family liked them. I did make a few changes though. I used Italian style bread crumbs and used 2 teaspoons Italian dressing seasoning mix. It was very delicious.

This recipe, like all regular recipes,  presents a challenge in our house. My husband has Celiacs, so all of my cooking is gluten free. I saw this and thought it sounded too good to pass up. I used gluten free corn flakes instead of bread crumbs, but used all of the rest of the regular ingredients. And I used an egg wash instead of butter as he is a bit dairy sensitive as well. Before cooking or dredging the chops, I seasoned them in some balsamic vinegar and season-all salt and pepper. We live at a high altitude so cooking time and temp was 375 and about 30 minutes. I also made quartered red potatoes shaken in different seasonings and olive oil and baked at 450 for 40 minutes. My husband did did everything but lick the plate. (Although he may have done that when he walked into the kitchen and I wasn't looking) Love this recipe and can't wait to try different things with it.

This were really good! My husband doesn't eat butter, so I omitted it and used 1 egg instead (before coating the chops). Very tasty and easy to make.

I have to say these are the best pork chops I've ever had!!   Very tender - didn't really even need a knife to cut!!   I used reduced fat Ritz crackers instead ~ FANTASTIC!!   One suggestion - make EXTRAS - they'll be eaten!!

Wonderful recipe. Chops came out beautiful.
I would use less crackers & cheese. Makes to much coating. I used the rest for meatballs a few days later.
Loved it..... Thank you

This recipe was absolutely amazing! My wife and I loved it, so did her pregnant friend. I didn't have any Italian seasoning on hand, so I ended up using the same amount, but with my beloved Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, for a little extra kick. It was amazing! My wife and her friend added a little applesauce to their plates and said it was great.

Amazing recipe!!  The best pork chops I've ever cooked.  I had some rosemary olive oil and used that instead of the butter along with Mrs. Dash to season.  Also cut the amount of crackers and cheese used as suggested by others.  Really appreciate how simple it was to put together!  A keeper for sure...  Thank you!

These Pork chops came out sooooooo good :-) Just make sure you put it in a big enough cooking pan because if they are too close together the sides don't get crispy. Otherwise, amazing!

I will definately say that my chops were moist. I didn't have any problems with the coating coming off, but I did press it into the meat. I would of liked it crispier but the flavour is great. I too cooked it on my pampered chef pan. I also flipped them at half time to cook evenly and used thick pork chops, half the recipe.

Just not my thing. Made this and only marinate 10-15 minutes. Made them on my George Foreman indoor grill. However, something about these I just didn't like. After a few bites, the flavor became way too overpowering and "one note"....almost didn't finish my chop. Just not for me.

This recipe is on our menu every month or two, but the breading is WAY too much. I've learned to cut it back...thus the 4-star rating instead of 5.

Great chops! I made the recipe exactly as stated (just a little less butter and had no parm). I sprinkled feta over the crusted chops before baking and it really gave them some ZIP. We both loved them - served with steamed asparagus and red potatoes.

These were great Love the breading. I only used 1/2 cup of butter, and I had to press the crumbles onto the chops.

They were ok. They turned out soggy in some areas, needed more flavor too.

Very good! I used 10 small thin boneless chops. Only 1/2 cup of butter (just enough), and I cut the breading recipe in half, still using 1/4 tsp garlic powder for added flavor. I still had ALOT of breading left over, and I'll probably cut it down even further next time I make this. Served with stuffing, & candied yams this made a very good, & easy meal.

It was ok, not great.  My husband didn't like it at all.  Great idea for the breading mixture.  Most of the breading stuck to the dish.  Pan frying might be a better idea.

I found this recipe several months back and it has become a family favorite. They do not want pork chops any other way. I do take the easy way out and use Italian Bread Crumbs. Super easy and super yummy! Thank you for sharing!

Easy, simple and really good.  I made it on the stove (on a heavy skillet) in the low setting (turning them once) and then in medlow to make it crispier.  Beware of the cheese that will stick to the skillet or the spatula if not crispy enough.  Overall it cooked very nicely.  I used ritz cookies and the taste was really good.  I will make it again.

These are AWESOME! This recipe is one of my new staples. I made it not expecting to much and I was blown away. I pushed the cracker mix into the pork chop and then dumped the rest into the pan, and I wouldn't coat the bottom because the bottom of the chop gets soggy upon reheating but other than that A+

I made this last night and my boyfriend absolutely LOVED it!  He said they were the best pork chops he's ever had.  The only alteration I did was instead of garlic powder, I minced one fresh clove of garlic and added it to the melted butter.  (Remember, I cut the recipe in half, so for the full serving, I suggest 1 1/2 cloves).  We also decide yesterday that going forth, Monday nights will be Pork Chop Monday's so I'm sure I'll be repeating this recipe much more (& very soon!).

Absolutely Delicious! I thought there was too much cheese to cracker ratio, next time I'll do half the amount of cheese and less crackers. It made WAY more than needed for 6 chops. But all in all, terrific recipe. Thanks!

Finally a pork chop recipe that is DELICIOUS!!  This recipe as written I agree calls for way too much of the cheese and crackers, but just cut back on both of those items leave the rest as the recipe says. Really great!! I turned the meat over about 1/2 way through cook time. I think next time I make these I may not turn them for a comparison.  My Husband HATES,  HATES parmesan cheese..did I say HATE?? But, he really liked these chops, this is a real keeper...thanks for the recipe!!

Good chops, but the breading was pretty soggy, even with cooking at high temps.  Still very good though.  I used buttermilk and a little butter.  I think the buttermilk is good for moistening, sticking crust, and tenderizing.

This is a great recipe! Even my boyfriend who's italian, said that they tasted just like grandmas. The only thing that I would change is the mixture made WAY too much. Id cut the parm and crackers in half and for some reason, it took my chops 1.5 hrs to cook, not 30-40 minutes.

I would even cut this mixture down to 1/3. I threw a lot away. But the chops came out very tasty. It was a nice quick dinner that I could throw together in a pinch. Thanks for another keeper!

This recipe was very easy and very yummy. It was a huge success in my home. I used fresh Parmesan cheese, and also added a little of the extra cracker mixture to the top of the chops before baking.

I followed this recipe to a t.  It was EXCELLENT!!  I am used to making pork chops the traditional way throw a few spices on and bake or fry them.  This was my first experiment with a pork chop and I am so happy I tried it.  I use thin, boneless pork chops and they came out delicious!!!

Very good. I didn't have any butter or saltine crackers, so I dipped the chops in egg and used Ritz crackers for the breading. It was pretty tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I'd say this was definitely a hit since everyone except my oldest cleaned their plate and even she said it was better than most pork chops. (She HATES pork chops). I do think you could get by with half the ingredients since I made more than 6 pork chops and still had a good half left. I melted the butter a stick at a time as I needed it and ended up using app. a stick and 1/4 of another. I sprayed my pans with non-stick spray 1st. rolled my chops in the mixture patting them good to be sure they were covered and they were nice and brown when I took them out of the oven. Not soggy in the least. Great recipe just needs minor adjustments!

This is an excellent pork chop recipe!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use milk and less butter.  Very tender and juicy chops!

The flavor in these chops is great!! I gave it 4 out of 5 stars though because I have made it twice and I've tried cooking them in the broiler for the last 10 minutes and also tried browning them first and they still ended up a little soggy. Next time I think I will reduce the amount of butter :) I served them with mashed potatoes!

This was very tasty.  Took others advice using thinner chops (cutlets), and pressing the crumb mixture into the chop so that it would stick better.
Thanks for sharing!

Extremely tender and moist.This can be such a versitile recipie by changing the seasoning in the breading according to your tastes. I recommend trying it as it is written first. I also agree that you  should cut the breading mixture so that you won't have so much waste. Hard to make a mistake with this one.

Really good and flavorful without being overpowering. I only used 1/2 c. butter and halved the topping as well. After dredging the chops and putting them in the pan I pressed some extra topping onto them. Chops came out juicy with a crunch to the crust. Yum!

i agree with the other reviewers in terms of the excessive breading in the recipe. otherwise, it is really, really, good...quite a change from the same old, same old...and it's quite easy to make too. makes it doubly delicious.

My family loves these tasty pork chops.  I made the entire breading mix and used more chops.  Nice change from plain old pork chops.  Served with homemade marinara and pasta.  Will make again!

This was quite good and very popular with the children at the table (hard to find something for the adults and kids sometimes).  I didn't give it four stars because I thought it was lacking some punch--will have to experiment with some herbs.  Will definitely try again.

Though i use this site all often i've never rated a recipe.  I'll preface this by saying i don't usually cook pork but i wanted to try something new and this recipe was a hit.  I bought boneless pork loin chops, thick about 1", at Safeway.  the flavor was fine but the meat was TOUGH!!  my family tasted it and then was done.  it was really chewy!  now i have to try to figure out what to do with all the lefotvers!  did i not buy the right cut or quality?  i'm not ready to give up on pork but if i don't do better my family will!

Mmmmm, yum! But you can cut back on the breading. I used 8 chops, only 1/2 C butter, and only about 1 1/2 C of breading (and I still had extra). I suspect you could skip the butter all together but I haven't tried it. I didn't have enough crackers on hand so I used a combo of crackers and croutons and that worked fine. I baked about 40 minutes, then broiled for about 5 minutes to make the top crispier. If I made it again, I'd bake on a broiler rack and flip halfway through so the bottom sides don't end up soggy in a pool of butter.

Very easy and flavorful!  I dipped in egg instead of butter and used Townhouse crackers instead of saltines.  I did use pats of butter around the baking dish and added a little onion powder to the dry mix.  I thought these had great taste and family really enjoyed them.  Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely loves this stuff, as does everyone else I've made it for. When I haven't had crackers on hands, I've used Italian bread crumbs instead.  Have also used chicken breasts instead of chops.  Turns out yummy everytime.

These chops were great but listen to the other reviewers and cut the cracker mixture down to 1/4 of what it calls for.  The breading didn't seem to be crunchy enough so at the last minute I put under the broiler and they turned out great.  My husband loved these and asked that I make them often!

Yummy!!  I did not use as much parm cheese or crackers as the recipe calls for and still had plenty to use.  The chops were very moist and tender.  The crust was excellent.  My husband even said it was great.  That is amazing for him to say a pork chop recipe is great.  We will be making this again and again.

Tender and tasty boneless loin chops.  I added extra garlic powder, plus s+p to the crumbs for extra zip.  I cut the crumb part to 1/3rd for 4 chops, and I still had half the crumbs left.  Follow everyones' advice, and you won't waste cheese.

Better than most pork chops I've had but I had some problems with the coating too.  I flipped the chops halfway to get the bottoms crunchy but then the coating came off the other side!  Will try again, my husband enjoyed!

Amazing!  Great flavor, definitely will be a family favorite.  Way too much of the coating mix left over, though -- cutting it in half would be more than sufficient.

I was sick of boring fried pork chops and wanted something different.  This was AMAZING.  My family loved it!  Although, there was one thing I will do differently next time - cut down on the saltine crackers, parm cheese and butter.  I had so much mixture and butter left over.  Next time I will cut in half to avoid waste.  Other than that.....FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!

This was a huge hit with my family. I was asked to put it into our regular rotation. It was easy to make and the ingredients were all things you've probably got on hand so no additional trips to the store needed. I would highhly recommend it. The flavor of the mixture was delicious and the meat was tender!

Chops melted in mouth!  Easy and fun recipe. Family loved it.  I also, on the side opened a can of crushed tomatoes adding peppers and onions with seasonings in frying pan for those who wanted sauce on top of chops.  Big Hit!!

I am not a cook and these turned out great!  I was suprised at how tender they were.  I used 1 cup grated parmesan and 1 cup shredded parmesan.  I just wish I would have "crushed" the crackers to be more like a breading mix.  They were still great though!

Sorry, this was a gloppy, soggy mess.  We were expecting a crunchy coating with some flavor and got neither.  A waste of good pork chops.  Next time I'll stick with Italian Shake and Bake.

It was really good, only suggestion is to spray the bottom of the pan with non stick cooking spray so the bottoms will not stick.  Also, to give it a golden brown top, use your broiler for about a minute.

This was an excellent dish. I've always had trouble with pork chops since I never know how to make it-mine usually comes out dry. I followed the other reviewers comments - used italian style breadcrumbs instead- with the rest of the ingredients, and had leftover bacon grease and added a little butter to it(I realize the fat content must've been huge after I did this). I used thin cut pork chops and baked at 425 for 10 minutes and then under the broiler for 2 mins. Hubby and 3 1/2 year old loved it. It worked great with sweet potatoes and green beans. What a quick way to make dinner! This will be one of our usual items on the dinner menu.

I also halved the breading mixture.  I used thin pork chops and cooked for 30 min on 400 degrees.  I turned once during cooking.

These were so delicious!!  I substituted italian bread crumbs (didn't have any saltines) and my family gobbled them up. Juicy and flavorful. THese will definitely be a regualar meal at out house.

Didn't care for this one. I was way to buttery. Didn't have much flavor. Might try again, but use less butter and more seasoning

I thought this was a bit "blah" but the prep was easy AND my husband liked it...so I am giving it 4 stars.  The next time I use this recipe, I will season the meat directly (perhaps after the butter-dip) rather than relying on the cracker-crust to add flavor.

I admit I absolutely overcooked these chops, and that was a big part of the problem, but I still don't think the flavor was all that great.  I used Ritz as other reviewers recommended and mixed all the dry ingredients in a Ziploc and after coating chops with butter shook them in the bag.  It was really easy, unfortunately I don't think I'll try again.

I tried these tonite after receiving them as the 'daily dish' a few days back, and I must say, they are sooooo good!! I did add a bit more garlic powder and a dash of seasoning salt, but that is only because we are a family of garlic lovers. I also found that we had about two cups of crumb mixture left over that we will save for next time. My husband is doing the 'no-carb' diet and for him I just used the leftover butter, (heated up once more) and added the required seasonings for the crumb mixture (minus the crackers) and mixed into butter and dredged his chops thru, they all turned out delicious!!

I did what others mentioned about using less crackers & butter, but it was still to much.  I'll try this again using about a 1/4 of the coating recipe for the number of servings I have already reduced it to.

Very easy and pretty good flavor.  I will salt and pepper the pork chops first though.  I served marinara sauce on the side for dipping.

Delicious.I halved the coating mixture and used ritz crackers as suggested by other reviewers. I also used a baking stone which kept the chops from getting soggy. This recipe is a keeper and the chops taste even better the next day.

I made this as listed, only differences were: I used sliced tenderloin instead of chops, and I added a little milk to the butter. I did realize that once the butter started re-solidifying, it made the pork more sticky and the breading stuck better. I had double the pork, and used the amount of breading in the recipe, and it was just enough. These came out pretty good. I'll have to try this with chicken breasts. I sent some to work with my husband today, and will update with his opinion once he tells me how he liked it. I had two last night, and they reminded me of the breaded pork tenderloin I used to get in Iowa. I think the way I made them, they'll make a good sandwich, too.

This was very good.  I covered the baking dish loosly with foil for the first 30 minutes, then let them brown for another 30 minutes (my chops were quite large so it took an hour to cook).

Great coating! As others have said, the recipe makes too much of the coating.  I cut the recipe in half and still had a lot of extra breading.  I used 3 very thin boneless chops and only had to cook for 15 minutes.  I baked them for 10 minutes and then broiled for 5 more.  They were tender and delicious!

My husband made this today and we both liked it a lot! He added a little oregano for taste. It was a little salty though; next time we won't use as many crackers. We reheated it later tonight for a late dinner and it was great. We'll definitely make this again.

This is VERY good!  I was looking for a recipe to help me use up a huge block of fresh parmesan I bought.  Hubby asked me to make it 3 times in about a week!  I used butter-cracker crumbs because I ran out of saltines.  It didn't make much of a difference.

This recipe is great.  I cut the crumb mixture in half and it was plenty.  At first I was grossed out about dipping the pork chops into butter, as opposed to using eggs, however when the dish is finished cooking, the pork chops tasted so delicious and were not at all dry.  Very good.  I will cook this again.

This is a good, basic chop recipe.  Only made a half recipe - which was definitely enough.  Also used egg whites instead of butter with good results.

This is a very tasty breading for porkchops.  I have also used it on baked chicken and it was delicious.  Only thing I found wrong with this recipe is that I had a lot of breading left over. I would probably cut down the amounts on it next time.

I didn't have crackers. Used bread crumbs. Cut down on the breading mixture by a third. It was still too much. Dipped in butter then seasoned with salt and pepper before coating in Parmesan mixture. Good flavor overall.

I have used this coating, with two changes, several times for pork chops and chicken breasts. I didn't have crackers or breadcrumbs the first time I made this, so I finely crushed some french fried onions to use. I also only had grated parmesan and romano cheese blend on hand. It's a hit with my family every time!

i think that these were some of the best pork chops that i have ever made. i adjusted a few things as i only had thin sliced pork chops, to cracker mixture i added fresh thyme and rosemary and alittle white sharp cheddar as i ran out of parm. cooked for 15 mintues at 350 and 2 mintues under boiler

This was excellent! I condensed some of the ingredients because I was only serving 2 but it came out completely tender and mouth-watering! I followed other recommendations and flipped it half-way.

Wonderful!  I used thin-sliced pork chops and substituted half the saltine crackers for 1 packet of Shake N' Bake Extra Crispy mix.  I also put a thin layer of the finished dry mix on the baking pan before laying down the chops.  After I put the chops down, I added more dry mix to the top of them.  I also used the buttermilk/margarine advice!  Yum-my!!

This was delicious.  It's even better the day after.  I decided to broil the chops just before I took it out of the oven to make it crispy.

Tasty but very rich and heavy. Next time I will use a mix of olive oil & margarine. I agree with most reviewers, this recipe makes too much breading (lots of waste). Cut the butter/breading ingredients in half at least as others have suggested.

My husband and I really enjoyed these. I used club crackers and regular saltines. I didn't measure anything except the butter. I only put 2tbsp of butter and used about 1/3c olive oil for the rest. I had just enough for 4 chops. The smell is overpowering when you cook them but the taste is tamed. I will be keeping this recipe. Thanks.

Great one!  I seasoned the chop with salt and garlic powder then I followed the receipe pretty much as stated except adding parsley for color.  The cheese gives it a great thickness to the crunch.  These are so nice for lunch pack the next day.

Cut this recipe in half and still had leftover butter and cracker mixture. It had a really good flavor but found the meat a little tough. Don't know if I will fix it again, if I do it will be with pork chops that are thin cut.

These are delicious! Instead of dredging them I mix all the ingredients and then spoon the mixture on top of the chops. It makes a lovely, tender chop with a yummy, crunchy topping.

I cut back on the amount of breading that I used because I knew the amounts called for were too much.  We all thought that this needed more flavour.  If I make it again, I will probably add some pepper flakes.

This recipe is great but I always have to alter a recipe with cheese.  I used seasoned herbed croutons with just a    dash of rosemary.  My husband hates cheese so no parmesan or saltine crackers for me.  Everything else the same and it turns out GREAT!!

My husband and I liked this dish, but the amount of "Italian" seasoning was a bit much.  We added kielbasa sausage also, just because we had it in  the freezer.  Pretty good overall.

I found that the breading could really coat about twice as many pork chops, but other than that, it was a good recipe.

Good.  Kitchen smelled rediculously tasty.  Chops were a little dry, will reduce cooking time next time and possibly add some butter around the chops in the pan.

This is a great recipe when you don't feel like spending too much time in the kitchen preparing. I use bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers since I buy them already prepared in the store. My family loves this.

I thought this was excellent.  Not exactly something you'd get at a nice restaurant, but it tasted great!  I used Captain's Wafers for the crackers because that's all I had, and I added a little Tony Cachere's seasoning and pepper to the mixture.  I changed the quantity in the recipe to 2 servings, and that was the perfect amount for 4 thin, bone-in chops.  And I only had them in for about 20 minutes since they were thinner.  I will certainly be making this one again.  Thanks!

I was great! I used Ritz crackers, which gave it a thicker crust. Just be careful to not make the crust too thick.

This was a very good recipe.  Will definately cook it again.  The batter would even be good for chicken breast.  I really liked how the batter made the chops a little crunchy on the outside.

These were very good, all of my kids liked them so that is worth 4 starts right then.  I too used italian bread crumbs instead of the saltine crackers, the poor person who had this recipe originally must think we all are against the original one since so many use the bread crumbs instead, but it is tastey that way!

This recipe needed more things, and really didnt do it for me. It needed more favor. I think that next time I make this, I will have to add more herbs and spices. But thanks for the base of something.

I "customized" this to 1 serving and still had enough for 4  3/4"-thick pork chops. It was very good, but a bit salty. I used some leftover garlic-butter I had made, rather than plain butter, and whole-grain saltines. I cooked the chops on the rack in our toaster oven at the temp & time recommended: they were moist & tender. Mostly the coating was crunchy, but there were some soggy spots. I will make it again.

Half coating and butter. DO NOT cook in a baking dish. They will be soggy. Had to add more bread crumbs to soak up extra juice. Very good flavor...added more spice. Will cook again.

Very Good. I took the suggestions of others and halved the amount of butter. I also substituted italian style bread crumbs for the crackers and turned the chops at about 15 minutes so they were browned on both sides.

This dish was VERY GOOD!!!! I changed a few things instead of a cup of melted butter I only used about half a cup. I also used Ritz crackers instead of saltines and I salted the pork loins with cracked pepper and Kosher salt after coating with the butter. The taste was good and flavorful!!! The only thing I would change next time I would probably only cook for 30 mins. instead of 40 minutes. I will cook this again THANKS!!!!!

These were really good. I added more garlic and italian seasoning to the mixture for more flavor. I followed everything else exactly. I also had a ton left over, next time I will half it.

Ok, Yum! I've never been one to follow   recipes to a T, I just use them as a base to build on (no wonder I can't bake). These were fantastic! I only made 2 chops and adjusted the ingredients. If you find them too "bready", adjust---it will be well worth your time!

Very good I have 4 boys ages 2 to 9 and they all loved it.  my 2 year old ate meat. I used thin chops.  So I used other peoples idias for them.  Cooked for 20 min. and broiled for 5 min.  I also used what was left of the breading mixture and coated the bottom of the dish and put on top of the meat to soak up the fat.

My family liked these a lot but the amounts some of the ingredients seemed way off to me.
The breading ingredients can be halved or less and same with the butter.  It's worth making the change, though - these are good!

Very good chops!  I did cut the mix in half and followed another reviewer's advice for thin chops (10 minutes at 425 then 5 minutes at broil) to make sure the coating stayed crunchy.  My husband has asked for them on a regular basis.

These were really easy to fix & my guys really liked them.  Next time I'll use a rack or something to keep them from getting too greasy.

My 12 yr. old son absolutely LOVED this recipe - he said it's a keeper.  Now that's a compliment!  He was tired of chicken, so when I saw this, I just had to try it.  I did cut the crumb mixture in half and still have plenty leftover.  I used thin boneless chops and they stayed very moist.  I will be making this again.  Thanks Marilyn!

Wow, these were some awesome chops.  Half the butter and half the topping were plenty for the 7 good-sized chops I used.  Took another reviewer's suggestion of letting the butter cool a bit before dipping the chops and that seemed to work well.  Did have a little topping left over and put a little underneath each chop (as also suggested) to soak up any juice and sprinkled the rest on top.  I eyeballed the seasonings and garlic for the chops and probably used a little more than was called for.  Used a stoneware 9x13 and a flat stoneware sheet; both came out great, no soggies (yay, Pamp. Chef!)!  Served with alfredo noodles and broccoli, and used a little steak sauce with the chops.  We cleaned our plates!  I can't wait to serve the leftovers!

We are not pork chop eaters, but this recipe tasted excellent. My picky children loved it as well.  No revisions, cooked it exactly like the recipe calls for.

I cut breading in half -- there was still a lot left over!  Cut butter in half - still a lot left over!  Chops were soggy, not browned.  Make sure to use a flat cookie sheet, not a 13x9 pan which causes them to not brown.  Not impressed.  Will not make again.

A terrific way to dress up plain pork chops.  A great tasting recipe that is easy to make and easy to clean up afterwards. I agree with other reviewers that the breading mixture can be cut in half.  Thanks Marilyn

This was really good! I also used less breading then what it called for. It was so simple to prepare also.

These were okay. I did use Ritz crackers. I think it wouldnt have been as good if i'd have used regular saltines. They got too crunchy though i even flipped them half way through. I might make these again with more seasonings. Thanks!!

These were excellent.  I had previously used a similar recipe for chicken so I was curious how it work work with pork.  I used 1 cup saltines/parmesan mix and 2 cups crushed cheese crackers (what I had on hand).  I put all of the extra breading on top of the 6 chops.  I also cooked for a lit longer.  It was not too soggy - just right!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The family seemed to like them. The coating was soggy though toward the end of cooking, so I followed the advise of others and put the broiler on when they were almost finished, kept a close eye on them until they were browned just right. Then they turned out very good. I used plain bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, and reduced the amount of bread crumbs to 2 cups, and the cheese to 1 cup.

I have made these pork chops a number of times since getting them off the web and they are the BEST! Easy and tasty - the coating also works with chicken. This is a kid pleaser as well!

This one was not very good.  My family found it MUCH too rich. I also had too 
much batter left over.  I think alot less butter and batter could make it successful.
