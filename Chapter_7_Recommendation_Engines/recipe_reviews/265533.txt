These turned out great and were super simple! Forgot the parsley for the photo but don't skip it. It really compliments the rest of the flavors. The one thing I will say is that at 15 minutes the potatoes do not get done enough. If you want to eat the packets straight off the grill you'll need to leave them on for 20 minutes. If you do pull them off after 15 minutes you'll need to let them rest for 5 minutes while they are still sealed.

Pretty much made the receipe the way it was written. Just two minor differences I mixed the ingredients in a bowl minus the shrimp just to coat everything a little more then added the shrimp and butter on top. My cooking time was a little longer then the 15mins but that I think was only because my grill was off temp wise. Thanks for the share loved it! Kids said better then Joes Crab Shack!

We made this at camp last summer and it was so easy to make and a huge hit. We personalized to each person's liking (some don't like shrimp so we just added more sausage and left out the shrimp, less seasoning for some etc) and then labelled them with permanent marker. We also cut the potatoes bit size. Definitely doing again sometime

This was delicious, everyone loved it! So simple to put together, can do a head of time. Only thing I did differently was added about 2 Tbsp of butter to each one and a hard boiled egg. Cooked it for 20 minutes as recommended buy another review and didn't rush to get it off the grill once turned off. Will make this often!!
