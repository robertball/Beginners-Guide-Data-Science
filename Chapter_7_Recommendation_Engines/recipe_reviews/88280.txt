Wow, so easy and yet so tasty and fun! I made these exactly to recipe except placed them in the oven for approximately 30 minutes with baking potatoes and then placed them on the grill beside our steaks for another 15 minutes. They were done to perfection! See submitted photo. Thank you.

Very good flavor, but the onions were nowhere near ready in 15 minutes.  I had to put them back in for another 15 minutes, so, for me, it was 30 minutes.  Worth the effort though.

Wow, these definitely do taste just like french onion soup!  I didn't use any butter and added a little garlic powder.  We did these on the grill and they ended up a bit mushy.  One word of advice if you're doing them on the grill - poke a few holes for the moisture to escape!

for an added treat, place a slice of swiss cheese on each onion before you remove it from the oven.  wait until it has started to melt before removing from the oven.

Definately add some crushed garlic, but go easy on the salt as the boullion cube is very salty....Sprinkle with a little fresh grated parmesean cheese and a little paprika at the end.

We love this recipe!  My husband uses a large walla walla sweet onion, with a flat bottom if you can find it. Core the onion (be careful not to cut through the bottom or all the juices run out), put in a spoonful of bouillon, press a clove of garlic, then fill it with butter.  Wrap in foil, and cook on the BBQ for about 45 minutes.  We eat them over a steak, and oh my heaven!!

I’ve wanted to try this for a long time, but never got around to it until now.  I will say, the flavor is very good, however that’s where my praise for this recipe ends.  I had to roast mine way, way longer than 15 minutes, more like an hour.  Even after an hour the very middle of the onion wasn’t done.  These were also very messy to serve, at least for me.  I ended up putting them in a shallow bowl on top of the dinner plate to help contain the juices.  I doubt that I’ll be making this again, but I’m glad I finally tried it.

Ohmygosh!  These are so good!  I've made them a few times and they always taste great!  Just like french onion soup but without the hassle.  I've even used yellow onions and they're okay, but I prefer using the vidalia.  I added some crushed fresh garlic for added flavour.  Yummy!

Great side dish.  Try wrapping the onions in bacon and sprinkling a small amount brown sugar on top.  And if you cut cross slices 3/4 way through the onions they cook faster.

This is easy and delicious.  We grilled the onions on the grill for 30 minutes (as mentioned before) and they were melt in your mouth.  Thanks Lotusflower for a new family tradition.

I add a bit of garlic powder or minced garlic.  We cook these on the grill for 30-45 minutes depending upon how big the onions are.

Easy, simple and delicious. I use chicken boullion just because I prefer that flavor to the beef, but this is truly a perfect, low cal side to any piece of meat. Thanks for sharing!

Yep, it does taste a little like french onion soup. I give it five stars 'cause I really like baked onions and the beef bouillon cube gives it a real favor kick!

I think the boullion cube was too much and they needed to be cooked for another 10 minutes or so.  They were decent & I was hoping for more.

My husband who rarely likes onions when they're cooked, loved these. I only put in 3/4 T of butter, but I added a few shakes of tabasco sauce as another reviewer suggested. We loved it. Medium sized onions cooked 40 minutes perfectly (not the 15 minutes although I didn't even check at 15 due to so many others suggesting a longer cook time). Thanks so much. Next time we'll cut the beef bouillon to 75% each and maybe up the other stuff to compensate a bit. Perfect as is though.

Tastes almost like French onion soup. I used one yellow onion, EVOO, chicken bouillon cube and the seasonings. Bakes in foil at 375 for 30-40 minutes.

This was absolutely delicious!!!  I didn't think they were to salty but I guess it just depends on the size of your onion too.  I roasted for about 40 minutes to make sure it was soft and yummy!  Thanks!

I love Vidalia Onions and this recipe did them justice.  Instead of cubes of beef broth I used Savory Choice Liquid Broth concentrat. Oven time was perfect. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe.

This has got to be one of my most favorite summer foods. I made this several years back for the first time when I saw Paula Deen make it on her show. After I tried it myself, it was over. I was hooked. Absolutely delicious. NOTE: I don't use extra salt because the bouillon is pretty salty on it's own and I also don't use the paprika.

Wish I would have made this recipe sooner.  We love Vidalia onions.  I used some of the suggestions offered by other cooks and did a couple things my way. After I peeled and cored the onions I sliced the onion starting in the center and going through almost to the outside, not going to the bottom of the onion.  Next I put the other ingredients in the center in the following order:  1/4 teaspoon each pepper & paprika, 1 teaspoon granulated beef bouillon, 1/2 teaspoon each soy sauce & Worcestershire Sauce and then 1 tablespoon butter.  Put each onion in an oven proof bowl and covered the bowl with foil.  Check the onions after 15 minutes, still not tender, cooked them another 15 minutes.  They were soft enough so I covered each  onion with a generous amount of shredded Swiss Cheese, put them back in the oven uncovered, turn the oven off and took them out when the cheese was melted.

Love, Love, Love Vidalia onions cooked this way! Especially on the grill :o) It does take much longer than 15 minutes though, more like 30 or 40 minutes. I have never tried it with paprika, but that does sound good. I usually top the butter with minced garlic. Yum!

I really did not enjoy this recipe.  I tried it once and the 15 minutes barely cooked the onion and the butter and bouillon cube did not melt.  I decided to give it a second try, this time cooking for 45 minutes and the onion still could have used more time in the oven and the bouillon cube still did not dissolve all the way... Over all not impressed and I would avoid this recipe.

Divine!  Skipped the salt since the bouillon is salty and didn't wrap in foil...just placed all my onions in a 9x13 baking dish.  About 30 minutes in I sliced the onions into fourths and mixed well before popping back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  Definite keeper.

For me, you can't cook onions too much, so I like mine after about 40 minutes at 425.  I don't use any salt cause the boullion cube provides just the right amount and pour on the Worchestershire instead of paprika.  In the summer months, this is practically a daily side dish!!!

These are excellent! The best is when you go to a farmers market and get the great big ones! I follow this recipe, but I also add soy and Worcestershire sauce on the top with fresh ground pepper and some kosher salt. Another way my mom used to do it was to add a little brown sugar if you want more sweetness.

Tasted great although watch putting in a whole cube I thought the first time I made it, it was a little salty but of course it would depend on the size of onion.  The next time I used a sprinkle of the granules and smeared it with the butter.  This way seemed to spread the flavor throughout the onion.

These were SO good!  I put mine in foil on the grill and roasted them for 45 minutes - that was just right.  I also added minced garlic to each one and put some Baby Swiss cheese on after they were grilled.  A perfect side dish to the country style pork ribs we had!

This was pretty good...I wish that I had some cheese to put over the top of it b/c it really did taste like french onion soup.  I think that I cooked mine a bit too long though. I will try it again and not cook it so long!

This can also be done in the microwave.  Cross hatch the onion, and place in a bowl, then microwave for about 5 minutes

I adjusted my recipe by using 1 pkt of Herb-ox Beef Boullion and a small amount of AuJus mix instead of the boullion cubes.  Over 2 onions, I split the seasoning packet and topped it off with  some AuJus sprinkled on.  It cuts most of the sodium, and gives a great carmelized flavor.  Grill for 45 minutes.  Heavenly!

Very good.  They needed 35-40 min to cook and I opened them and put under broiler for last 5 min. to brown the tops. No added salt because of bullion (better than broth beef paste, about 1/2 teaspoon).  Maybe some cheese on top at the end next time?  Will try again.

I didn't have paprika so I used cayenne pepper and sugar.  Outstanding!  I also put it in a baking dish because liquid leaked out while baking.

This has potential, but it needs a whole lot of work. I had to roast them for about 45 minutes, and they were still a bit crunchier than we would've liked. The bouillon cube barely gave off any flavour, and was still sitting there whole when I opened the onion. Really the only flavour other than on the innermost layer was butter, salt and pepper. Next time I'll either grind the cubes to powder or use powdered bouillon, and instead of coring the onions I'll just halve them and sprinkle with seasonings (adding some garlic) before adding the butter and putting them back together. This is a good starting point, but it tastes nothing like French onion soup, and doesn't really work as written.

I don't know what I did wrong, but my butter all melted and the boullion cube was still almost completely intact inside the onion.  I cooked 7mins longer than the instructions said because they still didn't seem done, but even then the inner layers were like eating raw onion.  A great idea, but it definitely didn't work for me.

We really enjoyed this recipe, although the grill time was 30 mins (we like the onions soft). We also used one onion and cut it in half instead of using one onion each. We also put shredded cheddar cheese on them after we took them off the grill. Very good recipe!

I had onions that tasted like this years ago but could never duplicate the taste until now. Fabulous!
