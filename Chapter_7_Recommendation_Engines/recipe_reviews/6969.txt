This is great!!!  I used fresh peaches right off the tree, only used 1 tsp cinnamon and it still turned out wonderful.  Will use this again and again.  Thanks Janie!  Maryann

What a wonderful recipe!  I did use mashed fresh peaches and the rest of the recipe I followed exactly as stated.  The texture of this bread is excellent.  This bread is not too sweet or too spicy.  It is perfect.  Other then using fresh peaches I would not change a thing.

I used peaches that had been frozen, so the bread had a little too much liquid.  It still tasted very good, though.  Next time, if I use frozen peaches I will make sure I drain them well first.

I love this recipe.  I did change it a little.  I did not add quite as much sugar or oil.  It still is the best bread recipe for canned or fresh peaches.

Absolutely delicious..moist, flavorful, freezes nicely and very easy to assemble.  Try adding a little coconut and yellow raisins for a really nice variation.  This is always a big hit with my family...LOVE it!

This was great - the texture and cinnamon make it more like a coffeecake.  I made it with fresh peaches - everyone loved it.

I really liked this bread.  I used fresh peaches that had been pitted, peeled and mashed with a potato masher not drained.  My 6 year-old that doesn't eat fruit loved it and called it cake.

This recipe was really quick and easy. I used 1/4 cup less sugar per loaf than it called for.  I also used fresh peaches and it turned out wonderfully.  A great way to use your fresh summer peaches.  A+ from a Georgia Peach herself!

I love anything peaches and this bread was wonderful. I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce.  I used canned halved peaches, drained and reserved the syrup.  I pulsed the halves in the food processor until diced, almost mush.  Only used 2 tsps. cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg (didn't measure).  I also added about 2 Tbsp of the peach syrup which I think helped in "lacking peach flavor" problem.  For those who said theirs turned out dry, you may have over beaten your batter. When making Quick breads/muffins the dry ingredients just need to be combined, the less you stir the better they turn out. Will be making this again and again.

I thought this was good, but I should have diced the peaches a little smaller; my family liked it but it was too chunky. Will try again, tho.

My husband, who never eats, "fruit breads", thought it was outstanding and requested I make some for him to take to an office brunch. I used fresh peaches the first time and used the given amount of sugar. After reading a review about its sweetness, when I made it with canned peaches, I used 1/2 cups less sugar. It worked.  I give it 5 stars!

This was a great tasting, sweet, moist bread! Just make sure that if you are using mini loaf pans that you only fill them 2/3 full beacause it rises.

I liked the bread but wished it had a bit more peach taste. Cinnamon was a bit over powering. I did use half the oil and applesauce worked well. Next time I will chunk the peaches and use more. I also covered it for the tail end of baking as suggested. Over all this is a keeper!!

Very yummy. I replaced 1/2 cup of white sugar with natural sugar and everyone was pleased. I cut the peaches into chunks and ended up having to cover the bread with tin foil between the 50th and 58th minute of baking - it browns very quickly but needs the full hour to be cooked. Save some of the syrup to spoon on top of the peach bread (for me, it was a combo of lite and natural syrup).

Oh, so good!  I, also used fresh peaches, and some almond flavoring.  I sprinkled a streusel topping over the loaves, before baking. That seemed to be a nice touch!

This bread is delicious! I used light canned peaches instead of the heavy-syrup variety, and added about 2-3 tablespoons of the juice to the batter. It came out moist and sweet; a hit with my friends. I will definately be making this EASY recipe again!

I just made this w/peaches we picked (2 cups). SOOOO good, I did 1/2 C. Applesauce and 1/2C. oil and 1 3/4 C. sugar. I had to drain the peaches because they were so juicy. I have never seen a recipe for peach bread before, this is a keeper, fresh peaches dont last long, so it's nice to find a good recipe.

Fabulous!  I only used 1 t cinnamon, 1 cup sugar (Splenda), 1/2 cup oil (canola), and I used diced fresh peaches.  The Peach Bread was absolutely delicious - flavorful, moist, and relatively healthy.  My wife, 13-yr-old, and I have already finished 3/4 of it, and I only made it 12 hours ago!

I made this bread for a party and it turned out quite successfully.  I was looking for a recipe that would take canned peaches, so this one seemed perfect.  Mixing didn't take long, but baking took much longer than the recipe said since I was using a glass pan and reduced the temperature.  I think this one would also be great with blueberries added.

My suggestion would be to omit the oil if you are using fresh peaches and two halve the cinnamon.  It still comes out moist and the peach flavor is stronger.

Very good!  I used fresh peaches as I needed to use them up.  The only other change I made is I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and that was all I had, so I added 1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I used the clay Pampered Chef loaf pans, sprayed with cooking spray and a small sheet of parchment just on the bottom so it wouldn't stick when I took them out of the pans.

Great recipe!!  I adjusted it a bit - used only 1 1/2 cups sugar and unsweetened applesauce for half the oil.  Used fresh peaches (added about 3 cups) and used whole wheat flour.  I only gave it 4 stars because the batter seemed too thick and I had to add quite a bit of water (maybe the canned peaches would have added enough moisture?)  I will definitely make again, especially when I have peaches that need to be eaten!

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  I used fresh peaches instead of canned and only put 2 tsp of cinnamon, but left everything else the same.  It was sooooo good, shared a loaf with my neighbors and they loved it as well.  Will definitely keep this recipe !

This was a very good basic bread, very moist.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used fresh instead of canned peaches.  I think in the future I will add another peach or two since we tend to lean toward a more powerful flavor punch.

Made recipe using this as base, came out quite well, but rather low in peach flavor. I guess add more peach! The best part, though, was one loaf where I added a large chopped jalapeno pepper. Sweet and hot always go together, and this is no exception. I'll use more jalapeno next time, just recommend separating batter and trying with one loaf first!

The first time I made this I used fresh peaches and it was delicious!  The second time I used home canned peaches and 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil.  It was even better than the original!!

Very good - my husband loves it! I did make a few changes ... making it a little more healthy. For the oil, I used 3/4c olive oil and 1/4 flax seed oil, I used 3c. of fresh peaches, added a hand full of raisins and 2 sm. jars of baby prunes. I know it all sounds strange but it turned out great. Make sure you cook it for the full amount of time.

I changed the bread to muffins, but they were probably better that way.  My whole family loved them!  They were so moist and delicious!  Better than any other rhubard, banana, cornbread, strawberry, or blueberry muffin!

This recipe works REALLY well.  My concern was that for the amount of fruit,  it did not need that much sugar, so I cut the sugar by 3/4's of a cup and used organic turbinado type sugar.  I also cut the oil to 2/3 cup.  I quasi pureed 3 peaches that were overripe and 3 small nectarines with the sugar using my mixer.  The result was a tender flaky, moist quick bread that tastes like a coffee cake but has a muffin like texture.  YUM!!!!!

This has been a favorite in this house for two years now.  My family loves it when I follow the recipe straight, as well as when I make slight variations.  I've used nectarines instead of peaches.  I've used blackberries.  I've substituted 1-for-1 coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and put in coconut flakes instead of nuts.  I've yet to try anything where this doesn't come out fantastic!

I know, I know...don't make changes but I did anyway.  :-)

I used all brown sugar, added a can of pears (drained) that I needed to get rid of, 2t of cinnamon and replaced half the oil with applesauce.  Excellent bread!

This was decent quick bread, just slightly on the dry side, but that may be because I used frozen peaches instead of canned? Also, the cinnamon kind of masked the peach flavor to me. One thing I noted, my family did not eat all of the bread, which is very unusual. Most quick breads disappear rapidly in our house, lol. I probably won't make this one again.

Yummy! Moist! Absolutely loved it! I did the exact recipe despite some user alterations-I did use fresh peaches that were puried.  I wasnt sure if it was going to be sweet enough so I melted a couple tb of butter and brown sugar and spooned three tb on each loaf. My husband and I loved it!

Really good bread. I used half whole wheat and half white flour and half apple sauce half oil to try and cut some calories and fat. Overall great taste. Not too sweet and the peach flavor is good. I would probably cut the amount of cinnamon next time I make it since they may be masking some of the peach flavor

This recipe is great.  I used canned peaches once and fresh and both work great.  Next time I will try suggestions I have read here to cut back oil.. use applesauce or peach juice as the oil adds lots of calories.  Thanks!!

This recipe was really yummy.  I decided to change a few things to make it a little healthier.  I used 3 med fresh peaches.  With the sugar, I used 1c white sugar and 3/4c brown sugar, then substituted oil for 1/2c olive oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Then with the flour I chose to put 2 cups all-purpose and 1 cup of wheat flour.  This recipe turned out wonderful.  Very tasty and a little healthier for my family to enjoy.

Pretty good...a different way to use up all the fresh peaches off the tree!  Not great though.  I also added more peaches and not so much cinnamon.  Peach flavor does not permeate the bread like others said, but the chunks of peach make it moist and quite tasty.

I used this as a basic recipe, but changed things to lower the fat, calories, and make it heart-healthy. I used whole wheat flour, substituted the oil with 3/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup fat free sour cream, added a banana,and put in 2 1/3 fresh white peaches. It turned out wonderfully. I think next time I will try putting in a little more sour cream, and maybe some other spices.

This was very good, but a bit heavy on the oil.  The only changes I made were to use chopped spiced peaches instead of plain, and a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and ginger instead of just cinnamon.  The batter was very thick, like cookie dough, so I added a little of the peach juice.  I wasn't too impressed right after I baked this, but after it sat for a day it became very moist and flavorful.  It didn't taste oily, but after I ate it, I could feel it sitting heavy in my stomach almost like fried food does.  This was a big hit at church, so I'll make it again, though I'll definitely cut the oil in half and use applesauce or baby food instead.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I made a couple of adjustments though. I used fresh peaches, and 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. Only 2 tbsp of cinnamon. I will probably use a little less oil next time, because I think it would be just as good and moist with a little less.

I halved this recipe and it worked fine. Make sure your peaches are chopped well. I didn't and the bigger pieces created uncooked bread around them. My fault though.

Very impressed! I used fresh (over ripe) peaches from my yard and was worried it would be smushy so adjusted oil to 3/4 c. and added an extra egg since the ones I had on hand were small, sprinkled some cinnamon sugar just down the middle, baked 48 minz came out GREAT! gonna try recipe as muffins! Thanks!

I wanted this done sooner for my husband on his way home so I made it in a 9x13 pan. Used thawed and drained frozen peaches. I don't know why everyone didn't like it but after two days it was still sitting around. In our family of 7 that's virtually unheard of. I kept offering it to people but no one seemed to want it. I ended up throwing a good portion away. I thought it tasted good. :)

This peach bread is very good. I made it with fresh peaches as well. Only disappointment was that it didn't raise as high as I would have liked, but that didn't effect the taste. Will definitely make again.

I made this with fresh peaches.  The loaves are still cooling on the rack, but I couldn't wait any longer.  Delicious!  Very moist.  I will save this recipe and make this again!

I only substituted the cinnamon for cardamon and added an extra cup of peaches and it turned out more moist than the original recipe.  Best when eaten hot with a dab of butter.

Quite tasty. Alterations I made: 1. Halved recipe 2. Reduced sugar by quarter cup 3. Reduced oil to 1/3 c and added 1/4 c yoghurt 4. Omitted cinnamon 5. Increased peaches (x2 cans) and mashed them, and added a little lemon peel and lemon juice 6. Subbed almond essence for vanilla because peach & almond go well together 7. Baked at a lower temp for longer

I was wondering what to do with some peaches that were a bit past their prime so I made this.  It was a huge hit!  And very easy.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Hubby Loved it!  I made the changes per other reviewers. 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I was lucky to have some homemade, yum. I also did the 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar. I upped my count of peaches and added a mango. He loves it!

Unbelievably good! I made a few changes: used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, used 1 1/2 cups of maple syrup instead of sugar, used 3 1/2 fresh peaches. The bread was tender, moist, and very flavorful. Thank you for this great recipe!

This bread is delicious.  The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I also added a tsp of nutmeg.   It won't last long around the house so you better hide some for yourself.

Using some other reviewers suggestions, I used fresh peaches (I had just picked a lot of them) and this recipe was great!  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup peach puree instead of the 1 cup of oil to cut down on calories/fat, cut the sugar down to 1 cup (my peaches were very ripe and sweet) and subbed one tsp of allspice for one of the tsps of cinnamon.  Great texture and taste.  Super easy!  Will make again and again.

I found this bread recipe when I had an abundance of peaches, and it has been a life saver.  It tastes so fresh.  The other flavors do not over power the clean, crisp flavor of the peaches.  I did change a few things: ~~ i used fresh peaches (since that is what I had on hand), replaced 1 tsp cinnamon with 1 tsp nutmeg, and next time I would use 1 cup nuts instead of 1/2 cup.  I must of done something right.  My family likes it so much I can't keep a loaf on my counter.

I forgot to put in the cinnamon the first time I made this using fresh white peaches, the next time I forgot the baking powder, and the last time I did it exactly like the recipe said, only I baked it in 7 tiny loaf pans instead of 2 8x4 loaf pans, so I decreaed the banking time to 45 minutes. My family liked it every time, so to me this is a fool-proof recipe.

This is one of the best quick breads I've ever eaten!  I didn't add the nuts and used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of half the oil.  Also added a little bit of the peach juice.  Thanks much for a wonderful recipe that I hope to use often!!!!!

I just made 2 loaves of this bread and it was delicious. The only changes that I made was that I added an extra 1/4 cup of peaches to the batter. The 3 tsp of cinnamon was perfect. The only way you can tell that it was peach bread was by the chunks of peaches in it and not really by the taste. Maybe next time I will buy some peach extract (if there is such a thing) and add some of that for a more peachy taste.The 2 cups of sugar was good and maybe a 1/4 cup more would be better. Other than that it was perfect. Moist and not dry. I will definetly add this to my Top 10 Bread Recipe collection.

This bread is very good, but too sweet and oily.
I ommited the cinnamon and added lemon peel instead.
It is very tender and moist, but the flavor reminded me of the fruit fritters we make in my country, not the flavor I was hopping to get on a bread.
Next time I'll experiment with less oil or maybe I'll substitute part of the oil for applesauce.

This recipe I wasn't going to try just because I've never heard of peach bread but i had all the ingrediants on hand so thought why not. I did take some suggestions and lessened the sugar by   1\4 cup and only put in 1 and1\2 tsp cinnamon also I added 1\3 cup of the peach juice it came out to be wonderful!!! I will be making this again

I always change a recipe up a little based on reviews and hunches. This is what I suggest. Add a tsp of lemon or butter extract. Sprinkle a pinch or two of cloves. And use 5 ounces of canola oil and 3 ounces of peach syrup from drained peaches. I used baker's grease to get out of pan (equal amounts oil, flour, and shortening).

This bread was wonderful!  Everyone who tasted it loved it.  I used canned peaches, doubled the recipe and added a package of Hershey's Cinammon Chips.  I loved the addition of the cinnamon chips, although it did make it more like coffee cake.  I'll definitely make it again when fresh peaches come into season.  Can't wait!

I used fresh peaches instead of canned and made 6 small loaves and they were delicious!

I think I would cut down the cinnamon a bit because it overpowered the peach flavor.

May have done something wrong but the peach flavor was non-existent.  Tasted like a very bland carrot cake. I had to use a larger loaf pan and added another 10 mins to the bake time and it still seemed undercooked.  Next time I would add more peaches and  cinnamon.

Delicious.  Only change I made was to substitute applesauce for the oil.  Yum.  Next time I'll also add blueberries.

This is a great recipe, I used pears in place of peaches and they worked very well.

These were great! I made them into muffins instead of bread and my girls kept calling them cupcakes! Hubby loved them and keeps asking when I will make them again!

This bread is incredible.  I used half whole wheat flour and cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup.  Used only 1 tsp of cinnamon because I'm not a huge fan and that was a perfect amount.   I only had canola oil instead of vegetable.  My son wants this every day for snack at school.  Better than chips or cookies any day!

Very good bread.  Used fresh peaches.  Followed recipe exact.  Think the cinnamon really is what makes it special.  Did dust pan with cin/sugar mixture-forgot, only adjust.  Lasted several days and still tasted great.  Highly recommend.  Cross between amish friendship/peaches added.

YUMMMMM....my 1st peach bread...and it was amazing!  my toddler and husband loved it.  I did replace 1 egg w. applesauce and used butter instead of oil.  It was PERFECT...I only had 1 loaf pan so I made muffins w. the remaining batter and they were soo good!  Im now a peach muffin lover too!

I altered the recipe a bit, adding more of this and that. I rounded up to the nearest 1/2 cup, tsp or tbs and added more milk to the final dough product as my dough was too dry. The bread turned out great! I also used fresh peaches, poured a butter and cinnamon sugar mix on top, added diced peaches on the side and then heated it up the next day at 400 F for 20 minutes. It was wonderful.

This is fantastic!  Would definitely make again.   The only changes I made was the sugar amount.  I used 1 cup sucralose (generic Splenda) and 3/4 cup white sugar and used 3 cups fresh peaches slightly mashed instead of canned peaches.  Oh and I forgot the walnuts!  My family loves this!

I used fresh peaches from my backyard, as well as less sugar and oil since they were sweet and very wet on their own.  Awesome!  Every my picky youngest who hates trying new things gobbled down a muffin like there was no tomorrow (I only had one loaf pan so baked one loaf and did the rest in muffin cups).  I know I'll be doing this again because my tree has lots more peaches!

I would've liked a more dense and juicy peach pie, but unfortunately this one was dry and bland. Maybe next time I'd try adding more vegetable oil & some of the canned peach juice in addition.

This is a good, moist bread. It didn't have intense peach flavor, but over all, it's a yummy breakfast bread. Will be making it again and tweaking it to intensify peach flavor.

As others have suggested I halved the oil for applesauce and one banana, also add a little mango a few blueberries. I used one can of peaches and microwaved the juice for 5min to reduce and used a little in the mixture and the rest as a glaze on top therefore needed sugar in the bread.  Result is more cake like which I wanted.

I never heard of Peach Bread.  It was delicious.  I believe it turned out so good because I used Fresh Michigan Freestone Peaches.  They were delicious and in the bread fabulous.  I was worried about so much cinnamon but it was just right. Thank you for this great recipe.

This recipe is amazing!  I cut it in half and made three mini loaves and baked them for about 30 min. Like many others, I used fresh peaches and also subsituted apple sauce for oil.  I was so impressed with the results.  Great summertime quick bread!

Very tasty.  I used fresh peaches and only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and may back that down to just 1 cup the next time provided the peaches are ripe and sweet.  I also only used 2/3 cup of oil and 1/3 peach puree to give the bread more of a peachy flavor and cut down on some of the oil.  I made do a 50/50 oil/peach puree blend the next time.  Anyway, dh and our 2 year old son loved it.  So did I.  Thanks.

I was happy with the way the bread turned out as it is very versatile. It was moist and had good firm texture. I made numerous modifications: I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil, I added 1/2 cup sour milk, decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used 1 cup frozen sliced peaches and 1 cup frozen blueberries, substituted 1 cup flour with 1 cup ground almond meal, added 1/4 tsp almond extract, added about 2 tsp orange rind, decreased cinnamon to 1 tsp,  used 1 cup walnuts, and added a pinch of ground spices (nutmeg, ginger, cloves) into the bread. Following these modifications, I found the bread nutty and flavourful.

I made this bread for a large gathering this week.  I took the suggestions of others and cut the oil by 1/2 and substituted homemade applesauce.  I also cut the cinammon to 2 tsp and added 1 tsp nutmeg.  I used a 29 oz can of diced peaches and about a 1/2 tsp or so of orange extract.  The result was a delicious bread which sort of reminded me of spice bread w/ fruit(peaches).  It was LOVED by the people that tried it and I've gotten requests for the recipe w/ the tweaks I made of course thanks to the rest of you.  I was a bit nervous to try it, but am glad I did.  Thanks!

this was good, not great, and nothing overly special...used peach puree for half the vegetable oil...also made a peach glaze, as we thought this wasn't very sweet.

Excellent. I chopped up some fresh peaches and plums I had to get rid of instead of using canned. Used less cinnamon, and added about 3/4 tsp ginger powder. Also substituted the oil for coconut milk to reduce calories, came out aromatic and delicious. Rave reviews.

This recipe was quite tasty and a big hit with my friends.  However, the peachy flavor did not come out very strongly.  My recommendation: more peaches!

This is a good bread, I made it awhile back to try and get my picky eater 8 year old to eat some fruit. I used peaches in the can that were already flavored with cinnamon, so that added to the cinnamon flavor. A good bread, we ate it with whipped cream! I haven't made it since the posted pic, but next time I might try to puree the peaches, as my son did not like the big peach chunks in it.

This bread is tasty but lacking any real peachy flavor. I even replaced half of the oil with pureed baby peaches. I'll probably make it again,and add even more peaches.

I used delicious home-grown peaches, which were full of flavor, but was disappointed at the lack of peachy flavor in this bread.

I give this recipe four stars, although I did change it up a bit. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour along with the two cups of white flour, 1/2 cup of applesauce in place of one 1/2 cup of oil, only 1 cup of sugar (partly because the applesauce I used was sweetened), and only 2 tsp of cinnamon. I also used fresh diced peaches, and because I didn't have quite two cups, I added about a 1/2 cup of blueberries. It may very well have been because of my changes, but I found that one hour was too long. I took it out after about 55 minutes and it was quite brown. I think it tastes great, though, and the next time I have peaches to use up, I'll definitely make it again. Oh, and I did put in the 1/2 cup of walnuts, but I don't think it needs them. Next time I'll leave them out.

This was a really good bread.  I love cinnamon, and this had a lot of that, so yum!  And the bread was really moist...so that was good.  I made a 9x5 loaf and then 5 muffins.  Didn't have any 8x4 pans.  O wells, try this recipe!

This bread turned out great and got rave reviews from all coworkers who gobbled up a whole loaf one afternoon.  Here are the changes I made to the recipie: Used 1/2 wheat flour instead of white; only about 1 cup of sugar; 1 cup or so chopped pecans instead of walnuts; added about 1/3 cup of water and baked it for only about 40-45 minutes (this is a change for high altitude locations).  Making another batch this weekend!

Very Very good bread, I got compliments all around! The batter was really thick and I added a small amount of water to it. I baked mine in four small loaf pans for about 40 min. I turned up the temp. to 375 for the last 10 min. because they were so wet in the center. They didn't rise very much but the bread had a nice consistency and great flavor. Thanks for the tasty recipe.

This bread turned out great!  I made a few changes -- I used fresh peaches instead of canned, lowered the sugar to 3/4 cup (and I think next time I will use even less!), and I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour.  Oh, and I skipped the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand.  Great recipe -- I will definitely make again!  Thanks, Janie!

For being such a simple bread it was pretty tasty. I used canned peaches which I diced in my food processor. I also covered the tops with foil as they seemed to be browning faster than the bread cooked.  Next time I'll try adding a banana - per the recommendation of another poster.

I made half the recipe, one loaf. I was told it was terrific, so will make again. I put peaches through a mini chopper for just few pulses to distribute fruit better and it did the trick. Thank you!

This turned out fantastic!  I did use fresh peaches but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it great.  The flavor is outstanding and the bread is very moist.  I was concerned that it might be dry based on other reviews and because the batter was so stiff.  No worries!  I'll keep this recipe on hand for future fruit breads.

My husband loved it and so did I.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had all the wet ingredients mixed and started the dry ones when I realized I didn’t have enough flour so I used half white and half wheat..  it turned out very well anyway.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts and fresh peaches.

I thought this bread was excellent the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was kind of difficult to get out of the pan.  Even after greasing and flouring the pan I had to use a knife around the edges and part of the bottom still stuck.  Maybe I'll try using wax paper next time.  I also used fresh peaches.

I used fresh peaches that were frozen so I drained them. My problem came when the bread was cooled and ready to slice, it fell into pieces.  Any suggestions as to why ? The flavor was delicious and if I can solve the falling apart, I would make again.

So good! I should have drained the peaches more,  but--lazy! The bread was slightly soggy around the peach chunks, but still great and hey, I learned my lesson for next time.

New 'go to' dessert!  Only alteration was 1 tsp molasses and fresh nutmeg.  Baked this up and poured homemade warm liquid custard over a thick slice.  Making another loaf this AM.  Wowza!

This is the best base recipe for fruit bread that I've tried! It works great with gluten free flour and you can use a variety of different fruits. I add a teaspoon of cloves to give it a little extra holiday flavor, and over ripe fruit instead of canned because it tastes better (in my opinion) and I don't have to throw it away. It's hard to find a compatible recipe for gluten free baking, but this always comes out moist and has a great shelf life! My family always devours it so the longest I've had any around is a week and a half. This recipe is great for muffins, but I cut the baking time down to 20ish-25ish minutes depending on the oven I'm using.

This turned out well and the family liked it. I also used smashed fresh peaches as I had extras to use. I used 1-1/2 c sugar and went a tiny bit lighter on the oil. The only other thing I might do differently is to mix the dry ingredients first and then add them vs adding all together.   But we'll definitely have this again.

Great moist bread. Decreased cinnamon. Added a bit of nutmeg and used coconut oil as  I ran out of oil. Also used 3 large fresh peaches that were very juicy. I made this in large muffin pans as the loaf pans were used for the banana bread. It is important to mix to just combined then add peaches. If to dry, add juice from the peaches.

This is over-the-top delicious! I also used fresh peaches. So moist and tasty.  I have a peach tree, so I'll be making extra to freeze.

Very good recipe. I used frozen peaches that were fresh from our tree. Added a tsp. of nutmeg too. Sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top of the bread before baking which gave it a nicely textured top.

Tried this bread to use up some of the peaches that I froze last year.  Read the ratings below and opted to drain my peaches really well.  I added banana to one loaf and blueberries to another & also made 2 plain.  Bread turned out SUPER bland!  Even added some nutmeg.  Won't make this again!

I made this tonight and it was DELICIOUS. Admittedly, I had to use a mug to measure everything cup related, and a 1/2 tbsp measuring spoon to measure everything else. I also added a banana, but it worked out great! Super moist, and has a wonderful taste!

This was great!  I followed the recipe except I used 2 C (2 LG) fresh peaches and only 2 t cinnamon, made one loaf of bread and 24 mini muffins (I baked them for 15 mins).  The family loved it all and begged for more.  It also froze really well.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I had a bunch of peaches & didn't know what to do with them & came across this recipe.  I would like to say I followed the recipe as is, however, I lost count of how many scoops of flour I had added when my son started talking to me.  I think I added too much flour because the directions said to pour the batter into pan & it was too thick to pour.  I then added another egg & some more oil & more cinnamon.  I also made 4 small loaves instead of 2 big loaves.  With all that said, it turned out great.  I froze a couple loaves & they seem to freeze well.  They were delicious.  Even my son & husband, who don't like peaches, liked it.  I would definately make again.

Very delicious and so moist. It was a huge success at our house.  I made muffins and omitted the oil and replaced it with unsweetened applesauce.  This reduced the fat and no one knew but me. Great recipe!

Thanks for this recipe! Made it with my 4-year-old today to use up some peaches we picked together. I did adjust a bit - replaced half the oil with applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, added some nutmeg just because. It baked up beautifully with a nice crusty outside and soft inside, not too sweet (which is how we like it) and just delicious!

These are wonderful.  I don't make it in loaves - always make them as muffins.  Just cut the baking time down to 25 minutes from regular sized muffins.  My father, the pickiest eater you'll ever meet, raves about them.  My sister-in-law wants me to bring them every time I visit.  I follow the recipe (except for using canola oil, not vegetable).  It is a thick batter until I add the canned peach pieces. Moistens the batter up significantly.  I use this recipe all the time!

I appreciated the ease of the recipe and the taste wasn't bad, but I would suggest a few things.  Less oil and sugar somehow... real peaches... and one hour at 350 did not come anywhere near this bread being cooked through.  An OK recipe, but I won't be making it again.

This is a great recipe!  I made it on a whim one afternoon and omg, it was such a big hit!  I will definitely make it again.  I used fresh peaches that were not 100% ripe (all I had) and I'm sure it will be even better with the right peaches.

Had some home-canned peaches and was looking for a way to use them....This bread was different, but very tasty and moist....A few changes I made were using whole wheat flour, scaled the oil back to 1/2 cup and 1/2 c non fat yogurt, and changed the spices to 1 tsp cinnomon, 1 tsp of ginger  and 1/4 tsp of cardamom instead

I don't often give 5 stars, but for my taste it deserves it.

I liked the reviewers suggestion about replacing 1 cup white flour with wheat flour so I tried it and it worked perfectly.
Also, I had half a banana left over and threw that in and it worked well.

This bread was a good beginning: it needs more peaches in my opinion... mine got lost in the bread.  I used all brown sugar and it was nice and rich.  A dash of orange extract really gave this a beautiful fragrance!

Be very careful not to leave it in longer than stated... I was 5 minutes late checking on mine (different clocks in different parts of the house...grrr...) and it was definitely very overcooked.  

This actually improves with age.  Ours lasted a good 4-5 days and was lovely on the last day too.

Bread turned out a little dry and not too 'Peachy' tasting as other reviewers have noted.  I left Cinnamon out completely and still the peach taste was only noticeable when you ate a chunk of peach.

Don't think I'll be making this again.

I have made this recipe multiple times now, and it is great!  As another reviewer said, it is very moist and almost like coffee-cake.  In fact, I put one batch into a cake-pan and added a crumb topping- delicious!

Like other reviews were suggesting, I reduced the amount of cinnamon quite a bit.  I also added about half a cup more peaches, and a pinch of nutmeg.  That did the trick!  Amazing bread.

Very tasty and moist. I only used 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, as other reviews stated that 3 was way to much. I think it could maybe use more peaches, but other than that I liked it and will make it again!

Great bread!  I used 1 large can of peaches and cut them a bit larger than the pre-cut canned peaches and used a little fresh nutmeg, it tasted really nice, especially after sitting overnight in the fridge!

The bread tastes VERY good, but it's just not peachy (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).  I even substitued pureed peaches for half of the oil.  The cinnamon is the dominant flavor.  I will make this again, but I think I'll try two things - first make it with much less cinnamon, maybe 1 teaspoon.  Second, leave the cinnamon as is, but make it with apples or even shredded carrots instead of peaches - that will be absolutely amazing and a better fit for the amount of spice as those won't be dominated as easily by the cinnamon.

I was not a fan of this, although it could be my modifications: I cut back the oil to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. It came out a little dry and not as peachy as I'd like! Maybe next time I'll add more peaches and use the full cup of oil?

I took this bread to a state fair (for Georgia) and it was a hit!  Everybody wanted the recipe.  It was very moist.  I eliminated the nuts because of allergy precautions.

I have made this bread several times and it comes out perfectly every time.  I cut back on the oil a little bit and use fresh peaches (about 4) and add the juice to the batter as I slice them.

It made the whole house smell so yummy!  I love cinnamon and peaches.  I didn't have canned peaches so I also used fresh--which have more flavor anyway!  The bread is wonderful warm from the oven.  I might try mashing the peaches a little more next time.

This bread is SOOO yummy!  I baked and took it to work and it was gone before I knew it.  I think one lady ate half the loaf!  Extremely moist and so flavorful.  I didn't have canned peaches, so I cut up 2 1/2 fresh peaches to make up the 2 cups it called for.  I am already handing out the recipe to people.

This bread smelled better baking than it tasted, I'm afraid.  I baked the loaves an extra 5 minutes than the recipe indicated, but the inside still seemed gooey.  Unlike some other posters, I loved the cinnamon, but overall, I doubt I will make this again.

i read through the many positive reviews about this bread however felt compelled to switch the flour to half all purpose & whole. i also added a cup of mashed ripe bananas & used 5 beautiful south carolina peaches instead of the canned variety, (blanch them for 1 minute, cool then peel & coarsely mash). being a nut lover i rounded the chopped walnuts up to a heaping half cup. this recipe is very delicious & reminicent of amish sweet bread. thank you janie!

I love this bread.  I took some other reviewers advice and halved the cinnamon, and I substituted pecans for walnuts since I prefer them.  The loaves don't rise a whole lot, but the taste is great.  This is definitely going into my personal recipe file.

I used canned peaches that are already spiced with cinnamon and substituded macadamia nuts for the suggested walnuts.  The result is a tropical delight.  It is requested at every party that I attend.

This bread was okay.  I used one can of spiced peaches & thought the bread would be more spicy than it was.  Also, it seemed a bit dry so I added a few tablespoons of the syrup from the peaches.  I need to experiment with this recipe & add more peaches & spices to make it really good.
