I couldn't help but feel something was amiss when I saw one tablespoon of cumin. I think that the rave reviews are coming from people who hate the taste of venison. I followed the recipe exactly and thought the cumin overwhelmed any other flavor.

This slow cooker sloppy joe recipe is a definite keeper!!  I was looking for something different to do with all the deer meat in our freezer and was not disappointed with this.  A bonus is that it's done in the slow cooker!  Everyone loved this and even looked forward to leftovers the day after!

My fiance is a huge hunter and I always have a freezer full of venison to cook with. This is deff. one of his favorites and it is so easy.I also love this recipe because I make a big bake with the leftovers the next day so its 2 dinners in 1. Just take a 9x13 pan. Spread 2 cans of crecent rolls across the bottom then put the meat and cover with cheddar cheese. Last step is to cover top with 1 more can of crecent rolls ( I make it a lattice top) bake at 375 for 20-30 min. or till browned and warmed through. So Good!

Yummm, this was delicious.  My husband does not like ketchup or mustard, so I replaced with bbq sauce.  Final result tasted more like a pulled-pork style sandwich as opposed to a sloppy joe.  I put this in the crockpot during hunting season, and it was ready to go when the hungry boys came out of the woods.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is so good!  This was awesome made with steaks and cutlets.  I pulled it apart at 7 hours and let it simmer another hour.  Tonight I used ground venison and it was a hit at our potluck.  I used 4 lbs of meat and 2 1/2 times the other ingredients.  Delicious!!

Awesome!  I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  I used ground venison instead of stew meat and it turned out great.  I browned the meat and then cooked it in the slow cooker for 4 hours instead of 8.  I served them with potato slider rolls instead of full sized hamburger buns.  Next time, I think I will try adding diced green peppers.

I've never had Venison before trying this recipe.  My husband's friend gave us some and we didn't know what to do with it.  It was a fabulous recipe and I would try it again in a hearbeat.  No additions or substitutes needed.  Thank You.

This is my new favorite food. There are NEVER leftovers and the meat is incredibly tender! I even added a shredded carrot to increase our veggie intake and it was still delicious!

Good stuff.  I couldn't even tell this was venison.  The only change I made was halve the amount of cumin called for.  Served this on Honey Wheat Rolls from this site.

Not too bad. I didn't have cumin and therefor didn't use it. The major complaint I got from everyone was that it was way too sweet. Having said that, they did ask me to try making it again another time with perhaps less, or no, brown sugar.

I wouldn't eat it.  I couldn't stand the smell.  My husband said it was good and ate it non-shredded, like a stew.    I would not use the cumin, that was what I didn't like about the smell.

YUMMY!  My husband is not a big eater and he ate 2 of these and said he was tempted to have a third.  I am gluten intolerant so I had it over rice...excellent!! I did substitute our favorite bbq sauce for the ketchup/mustard and used ground venison just because I was looking for a recipe to use that.  Looking forward to making it again using the venison stew meat which I think will be very good.

My husband really liked this and it is a good way to use the venison.  I didn't use the cumin because I didn't think he would like it, but the rest of the ingredients made for a pretty easy meal.

A pretty good recipe... definately a different take on venison... a friend of mine that doesn't care for venison actually loved this recipe... me personally growing up on venison felt it had a little too much cumin and chili powder... kinda took over... also it was a little sweet for some people's likings... I will cut back on the cumin and the sugar and maybe try real maple syrup next time I make it... prep time also took a little time but it was nice to come home and have it ready to eat... thanks for the recipe

I enjoyed this recipe and I am usually do not like recipes from venison, but my husband is a hunter.  Next time I make I will cut down on the cumin, since that was a bit overpowering for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

Im not big on venison but this was really good. I am also a beginner in regards to cooking and I was able to make this. The only thing I really did different was add a bottle of beer in the slow cooker.

This was very good, but didn't quite have the "barbeque" taste I expected... hubby liked it as is, but I preferred to add a little bottled BBQ sauce to mine on the bun, and loved it that way.  Served with cole slaw and sweet potato fries dipped in BBQ sauce, YUM!  Another great new way to serve venison!

I tried this recipe a month ago it was amazing. I used half ketchup and half bbq sauce. My guests had no idea they were eating venison. Very yummy even the kids ate it.  I am making again tomorrow for some other dinner guests.

This is such a awesome recipe. I was looking for something different to do with all the venison we had. It was a hit for the entire family. I pulled the meat apart after 7 1/2 hours and then let it cook for the last half hour. It turned out amazing.

My family says it's the best venison recipe I've ever tried.  It's really terrific.  It's also the first time I've used a crockpot.  I will definitely be making this again.  I might try using other meats too!  I chopped the meat with a knife at the end, that made it pull apart very easily.  It looks saucy while it's cooking, but in the end the pulled meat absorbs the sauce and it's perfect.  I did put the cooker on high last two hours to be sure it got done on time because I have a tough deer.  Thanks very much for posting this recipe.

Was excited to try this.  Unfortunately at 8 hours on low most of the end product was burnt.

Made with soy crumbles and soy bacon.  Served with broccoli slaw.  It was delicious.  Needed extra water throughout the cooking time.

I'm not a Venison or Wild Boar fan, but this recipe is AWESOME.  I've tried it twice using Wild Boar (because that's what we had in the freezer), and it is soooooo YUMMY...

I'm not a fan of venison, but I get it from family, so I cook with it. I thought this was tasty, since the dish doesn't taste much like venison at all. The sauce has a very strong flavor. I used a hot chile-infused vinegar, which made the sauce spicy. Otherwise, made as written. Tender, delicious sandwiches!

followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone liked it.  Served it on split hamburger buns.  Stewing beef could easily be used instead of venison.  I used moose and it tasted exactly like beef. Yummy.  Will be a keeper.  Thanks, Michele, Cambridge Ontario

MY COMPANY HAS "POTLUCKS" ON OCCAISION TO ALLOW THE EMPLOYEES TO NETWORK WITH STAFF.  THERE ARE USUALLY 30 PEOPLE OR SO.  I MADE THIS BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  IT WAS VERY EASY, WENT OVER QUITE WELL AND NO-ONE BELIEVED IT WAS VENISON.  ONE COMMENT WAS, "I NEVER EAT VENISON", WHILE THEY WENT FOR A SECOND HELPING.  AND AT LAST COUNT, I GAVE OUT 12 COPIES OF THE RECIPE(ONE TO THE PERSON WHO WON'T EAT VENISON).

My family loved this! I do not eat venison but I made it for my husband and kids when I went out of town. They thought it was amazing and have asked for it many times over. Some day I will try it with beef.

I have a very picky family - especially when it comes to bbq sauces so I was a little worried but it turned out great!  Not too sweet or strong.  I did cut the cumin by 1/2 b/c I just don't like the taste and while I could still pick it out (b/c I was looking for it!) the flavor was really quite good.  This is a great way to cook some of the tougher cuts of venison.

I am not a venison fan but this didn't taste bad at all. I do think the time in the slow cooker was too long. Or maybe it was the seasonings but mine was a bit too savory for my tastes. Next time I won't cook it quite as long and will use plain tomato sauce instead of ketchup. I am not a fan of cumin myself so maybe I might omit it next time as well. Definitely didn't taste like venison, though.

Delicious! Always looking for great ways to cook venison.  This is now one of our favorites!  Only used 1/2 cup of ketchup, and added some water.  Added more garlic.

Love this! Great new way to use the venison in the freezer this winter. I didn't have enough ketchup on hand so I used a can of tomato soup and added 3 tbl cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also added Worcestershire sauce because I put it in everything. Totally keeping this recipient and using again!

If you're looking to swap out the brown sugar in this for something healthier, I used molasses instead and it turned out great! This didn't take as long to cook for me...may just be the way my venison was cut. Great recipe...didn't even notice it was deer meat!

My husband and kids loved this recipe!!  I used my pressure cooker instead and cooked it for 10 minutes at 15 lbs of pressure.  Took about 25 minutes from start to finish.  I used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have white vinegar and added a little worscestshire sauce. Delicious!  Next time I might decrease the sugar a little.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe did not turn out well for me and I ended up throwing it out. Venison is a difficult meat to cook because it is so lean, I think using the crock pot caused the meat to have a strange texture and consistency.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be really sweet. I would suggest maybe cooking the venison in a skillet and reducing the brown sugar.

Tastes outstanding, only recommendation i had was to remove or lessen the 'cumin' ingredients.  Other than that outstanding, had great compliments from seasoned hunters.

I made some changes to this recipe. I only added one tablespoon of garlic, one teaspoon of cumin.  Also, I added some of the bacon grease used to brown the venison into the slow cooker, maybe three tablespoons or so. Other than theses small changes I kept the recipe as is.

Caution: 8 hours on low might be too long. I did this before bed and when I woke up the next morning it was burnt. Maybe because I used turkey bacon and there wasn't enough fat? I also used ground venison. So, I did deviate from the recipe but just know going in that the recipe may not be that 'forgiving'. I liked the flavor, but if I try again will cut the sugar in half.

Not bad flavor,Just feel I could have gotten the same result by putting the meat in the crock pot with a store bought bbq sauce and gotten the same thing without the trouble of frying bacon and mixing a bunch of ingredients. Anyone who has ever fried bacon knows the 5 min prep time is very unrealistic!

Made this for my husband and his deer lease buddies.  They all asked for the recipe to take home - 5 STARS!!!!!
Only changes I made were that I used Red Wine Vinegar and added some 'Better than Bouillion'.  I cooked it overnight on Low in the crockpot.

Making this again to cook overnight, but this batch, I am trying ground Venison.

This dish was a great way to use a tough venison roast we had in the oven.  It does not highlight the gamey flavor of venison- one user complained about that... but Sloppy Joes aren't a dish I would choose to bring out the flavor of meat.  My 2 year old helped me pull it apart after 8 hours of cooking (he ate most of what he got his hands on),  Made some homemade buns, and enjoyed this thoroughly.  Mega yummy.

This is a good recipe and a different way to use venison.  The meat is tender and has a unique flavor. I got everything ready the night before and in the morning put it all together in the crock pot. I would probably make this dish again, but not for awhile.

This is an excellent, flavorful recipe.  I fixed it for my hunter son-in-law and he took some to work.  Two weeks later he asked me to double the recipe so he could take it to a pot-luck at his work.  All those big he-men loved it!  grunt grunt

This venison recipe was outstanding.  My whole family loved it.  The kids didn't even
know they were eating deer! The flavor was delicious.  This recipe will be passed on to family
members.
