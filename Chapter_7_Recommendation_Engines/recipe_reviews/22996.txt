I haven't made this one specifically but make something similar for my dairy-allergic son and wanted to offer a tip for those looking for something creamier:  add a little coconut oil.  It does *NOT* taste like coconut, so no worries there.  Ice cream needs fat to get that creamy texture (notice how most ice cream recipes call for heavy cream?), and the coconut oil can bring it without affecting flavor or lactose/dairy content.

These were just okay. I think the blueberries made them kind of bitter; however my 1 year old loved them. I think next time I will just us strawberries.

my youngest liked these but everyone else in the house did not. I think they were not sweet enough for them plus I would have liked them to be a little more creamy

These are tasty treats... my soy milk did not add a sweetness to my pops, so I had to counter that by adding honey and lemon juice, until I had achieved the desired taste. They honey and lemon really made these pops for me. Had the leftovers as a delicious smoothie for lunch!!

I really didn't care for these. Not enough flavor and not sweet enough for me. The mixture tasted good before I made the pops. But not so after freezing them.
