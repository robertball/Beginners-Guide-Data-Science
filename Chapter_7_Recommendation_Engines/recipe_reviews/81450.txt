I never in a million years thouht this would have been good much less great.  I had a few bananas that would have gone bad if I didn't find a recipe quick.  Perfect for breakfast or a quick snack.

A quick and easy delicious snack. I used fat-free cottage cheese. I am now addicted to this. :)

This is a fulfilling snack.  I did a few sessions with a trainer at the gym and she said that cottage cheese was high on her list of good foods to eat.  The honey and bananas made this delish.  I'm gonna make it again for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks!

It's also good if you cream the cottage cheese and honey first and then add the sliced bananas... tastes like banana pudding!

I made this with lowfat cottage cheese and maple syrup instead of the honey and then topped it with homemade grape nuts.  
It was fabulous.  I will definitely make this again.  Just a note: this would probably not work too well with very strong/tart cottage cheeses.

Since I'm not a cottage cheese lover, I was skeptical of this recipe. But like DIXIE CHIKIN, I had some cottage cheese, from another recipe, that I needed to use. Imagine my surprise when I enjoyed it! This makes a healthy lunch or a great snack...I won't have any problems finishing off that cottage cheese....thanks!

If you hate cottage cheese, you MUST give this a try! I used Kraft Simply FF Cottage Cheese and only 1 1/2 tsp. of honey, and it was delicious! Makes a great breakfast or snack.

I love, love, love cottage cheese! So, I am always looking for new recipes to try. This one just did not hit the spot for me. I like these three ingredients alone, but I did not care for them together.

This is one of my comfort foods.

It really depends on what time of the month it is wether I use honey or not.
It's good either way.

Sometimes, I'll eat it on toast for a quick breakfast.

OK.... I AM NOT ... and have never been a cottage cheese eater.. I have always thought it was yucky.. But since I am on low fat diet & need high protein to help w/ my body building. I did enhance it more to be on the safe side. I added slice fresh strawberrys and walnuts to the mix.... it was great... I now can eat cottage cheese & enjoy it.

While forcing myself to eat the cottage cheese my boyfriend left me with when he went on a 2-week trip for work, I am trying to find recipes to use up the stuff. I like it enough, but there's just so much of it... I prefer my yogurt! I found myself looking at this recipe while eating cottage cheese with a sliced banana of a small spoonful of strawberry jam. I think I prefer the sweetness and flavor of the jam to the honey, but the combo is a nice idea...perhaps I'll try it with toast, as someone suggested!

My husband and I thought this was very good.  We love the taste of honey as a sweetner, so I knew we would like this and we really loved how the flavors blended, while still being able to taste each individual ingredient.  I saw that a few people mentioned they didn't like the honey or didnt think it went well together.  I think if you don't like honey, this will not be a recipe for you.  For those that don't like honey, maybe try a little splenda?    Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will be making again this evening for a snack!

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I don't really cook at all and have never been comfortable working with food.  I'm taking baby steps and this is the best first step I've found.  Just had this for breakfast and it was perfect.

I enjoyed this but I didn't get any wow factor.  If you're looking for something quick and a little sweet for breakfast or a snack, it's an not a bad way to go.  I much prefer cottage cheese with kiwi or other tart fruits.  It's also really good with tomatoes, but a little less breakfasty that way.  Might try this recipe again, but with greek yogurt instead of cottage cheese - for experimental purposes!

I planned to make a smoothie for breakfast but there was no yogurt, then I remembered I had saved this recipe a while ago.  What a tasty surprise.  I will definitely have this for breakfast on a regular basis.

I didn't think this would be good, but I had some cottage cheese I needed to use up, so I gave it a whirl!  It was delicious!  I read the other reviews and thought that I'd need to use some splenda with it, but after adding the honey to the cottage cheese, it was sweet enough!  Thanks for this idea!

Good.  I use a little sprinkle of cinnamon in it, too.  It tastes best with riper bananas.

I love cottage cheese with sliced bananas - adding the honey made it very dessert like for me. While it makes a nice sweet treat I'll probably stick to eating this without the honey :)

I'm not a cottage cheese fan, but was hoping I would like it when mixed with honey and banana's. The only bites I did "enjoy" was when the cheese has a banana in the bite. It was def worth a try. I guess I'm a loss cause when it comes to like cottage cheese.

I had some leftover cottage cheese from a casserole and decided to try this since we always have bananas and honey on-hand.  OHMYGOODNESS.  my three sons and i all loved it!  this is our after-school snack from now on.  cottage cheese is going to be a regular staple on our grocery list.  i wonder what other wonderful treats are out there that i've never even thought of trying???

i was pretty excited to try this because i love cottage cheese, honey and bananas but there was something about it being mixed together that didn't sit right with my taste buds. it wasn't gross but not good.

I LOVED this! I diced up the banana for easier eating and instead of mixing the honey in, I just drizzled it on top. This made a wonderful, light breakfast. I will definately be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought this would be a sure fire hit,  but it struck out here. No one liked the honey with the cottage cheese... I'm not sure why not. I was asked by family next time to leave the cottage cheese alone and no fruit either. bah... party poopers. Oh well, thanks for the idea even if my guys didn't like it.

As another reviewer pointed out - this is not my fav with a salty/tart cottage cheese. It is a very easy, healthy, tasty little breakfast.

I thought I was the only one who knew about this...

This is a great breakfast or snack. I use non-fat cottage cheese to make it super healthy -- plenty of protein and potassium without too many calories or fat. 

I also like to add sliced almonds for some extra protein and a yummy crunch. Try it!

Very quick and easy snack.  Tasty too.  I'm always trying to find ways to get my toddler twins to eat more fruits and veggies.  This recipe worked for sneaking in bananas!

Sweetened cottage cheese with fruit or just cinnamon is amazingly good & easy. Since I'm diabetic, I sweeten with Splenda and use blueberries or strawberries which have less sugar. You can vary this in many different ways. Give it a try!

I'm sorry, but my son and I couldn't even eat this.  And cottage cheese and bananas are among his favorite foods!  I couldn't understand why he wouldn't eat it until I tried it.  I was surprised after all the good reviews.

Although I'm not much for cottage cheese and bananas are not my favorite fruit, this is awesome!!!' Simple, quick and the combined flavor is great. Also good with apples.

I'm not a fan of cottage cheese but I really liked this. I creamed the cottage cheese in a mini food processor with coconut sugar and cinnamon (consistency was more like ricotta that way) and then put that over the bananas. It was delicious! Next time I will add some pecans or walnuts. Great breakfast or snack. Thank you!

I creamed the cottage cheese and banana and honey together with a drop of vanilla extract. It turned into a banana pudding concoction. I dont know how I feel about it. The taste is great but I have a hard time with the consistency. I love cottage cheese but usually only use it with savory dishes so Im having a hard time getting over the fact that I am putting sugar on top of cheese (eventhough I would live off of cannoli if I could). I will try this again but maybe without creaming it all together.

I was reading some reviews for crepes that I wanted to make and someone commented something about eating it with sweetened cottage cheese. I've never heard of that before so I looked it up and came upon this. I'm eating it this very second and I have to say I have never eaten cottage cheese unless it was on a salad. This is amazing and delicious! I look forward to trying this with different fruits. Thank you very much!

Tried it this morning with no honey and slightly salty cottage cheese (the liquid was salty, anyways) and it still turned out really good! Would recommend draining your cottage cheese first, if you haven't eaten it before. Looks a little weird, but tastes and makes you feel healthy =) Thanks!

This is an ingenious little snack!  I was wanting something sweet and this fit the bill.  I could only eat half of it.  I like cottage cheese and I like fruit with cottage cheese- peaches and pineapple are a favorite, but this was a nice change.  Thanks for sharing.

This was the first time I've eaten cottage cheese as breakfast (I'm lactose intolerant and have to be careful) so I'm not sure about this one.  I think I'd have preferred more bananas in it.  Bf said he just doesn't like cottage cheese sweetened and with fruit, so I guess it's just not for us.  Thanks, though.  I'm glad the recipe was here so I could try.

Wasn't a big fan. Love all items in it. Just didn't care for the honey with cottage cheese taste. Banana's with it was good. So was the apples. Next time I'll go without the honey.

I just made this for breakfast.  I had some cottage cheese I had to use before it went bad.  I eas skeptical but this was so delicious and healthy.  I used a little more honey than called for but I like things really sweet.  I will eat this a lot!  I love finding healthy but tasty dishes Thanks a million for the recipe.

I've never had cottage cheese before and a lot of my friends always ate it with fruit, so I decided to find a recipe I could try. This was great. I will for sure eat more of it. Thanks.
