I made this and couldn't even tell it was cottage cheese.  I used the lowfat kind, didn't put the milk in and used 1/3 cup honey in place of the sugar.  It was amazing.  We ate the whole thing and didn't feel guilty about it.  Next time I'll try doubling the recipe for an even thicker cake.

My husband couldn't tell this cheesecake was low-fat, and he though it tasted like store-bought.  (That's a compliment!) I adapted this recipe slightly, in the following respects: I pureed the cottage cheese first in the blender, in small batches.  Then I used an electric mixer to combine the pureed cottage cheese with the other ingredients, adding one ingredient at a time and mixing very well.  I omitted the milk and lemon juice, and increased the vanilla to two teaspoons. I had more than enough filling for the prepared graham crust I used, so I baked the extra in a ramekin.

I've made this cheesecake several times.   It is delicious and also cost a lot less than one using cream cheese.  I like adding some ground up/small pieces of macadamia nuts once in a while.   To the person who thought it lumpy ---if you blend all the ingredients long enough it will be very smooth.

Great recipe!  Because I like denser cheesecakes, I strained the cheese for about an hour and omitted the milk and lemon juice.  Also, to try and imitate my favourite cappuccino cheesecake, I added 2 tsp. of coffee granules and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the mix.  I then topped with light whipped topping and sprinkled with more cinnamon.  Delicious!

this really surprised me with it's excellence. it has the texture of cheescake, the look of cheesecake, and the flavour of cheesecake but a fraction of the fat. you could eat the whole thing yourself and not be sick! lol. served with reduced-sugar cherry pie filling this is nearly indistinguishable from the "real" thing. I mean, there's nothing like real thick creamy cheesecake, but this is a very good craving-filler. I used 1% cottage cheese.

lovely recipe.  I didn't think guilt free cheese cake existed!  I made it even lower in fat by mixing corn syrup with the graham craker crumbs and pressing that into the lightly greased pie plate.  The cottage cheese mixture is so wet when it gets poured in, that it soaks into the crust and keeps it together, so really, the butter is not needed.  Thanks for this recipe, I love it.

This was ok, but this "cheesecake" has an identity crisis. it should not be called a cheesecake. more like a vanilla custard pie, or something along those lines. it tasted like vanilla pudding to me. though to be fair, i'll give some suggestions that would definitely have made my pie better: 

-don't use lemon juice unless you like the citrus flavor
-get a very smooth cottage cheese so its not grainy
-less sugar

or you could just embrace the whole vanilla pudding pie thing and throw some bananas in the bottom. (i used an already made nilla wafer pie crust)

This recipe is lighter in texture than regular cheesecake.  You can use the low or no-fat cottage cheese.  The crust might have been better without the cinnamon.  I liked it more than my husband and boys who like the "heavy" feel and taste of cream cheese.

So easy.  Nice and light.  I used a ready made pie crust and served it with cherry pie filling.

This has become a staple in my house! If we have cottage cheese we need to use up, I make this cheesecake. 

I omit the milk. I make this cake many different flavors - I have made it with a chocoalte crust and then added peanut butter to the batter. I have also done a chocolate crust and then replaced the lemon juice with instant coffee for a mocha cake. I have also done a vanilla bottom with toasted coconut, omitted the lemon juice, and added 1 tsp of coconut extract to the batter. The possabilities with this recipe are endless! Thank-you Sheryl K for a great recipe!

Wow, this is so good! Per other reviewers suggestions, I left out the milk, and pureed the filling thoroughly in the blender. I used about 1/2 cup of sugar, and added 1/4 cup cocoa powder. The result was a super rich and creamy - but much healthier than usual - chocolate cheesecake! I will absolutely make this when I want a healthy treat.

Yes, 5 stars. This is with some modifications I made, but you'll see they still stay somewhat true to the recipe. **Omitted lemon because I wanted to be able to add chocolate to some (made cupcake-size mini-cakes). Used light sour cream in place of milk (hoping to avoid "cream pie" taste some mentioned). Added 2T clear vanilla. And just realized I forgot the salt. **Used food processor and it worked well. Just takes a few minutes to reach the creamy consistency.  **As mentioned, I added some melted chocolate. 1/2 cup, some swirled, some all mixed. The result: awesome! Really, I'll be surprised if anyone knew it was made with cottage cheese. If you do mini-cakes, I baked for about 18minutes, then turned off the oven and cracked open the door. Left them in there until I was able to take the pans out bare-handed. So creamy and delish! I'm impressed!!

Easy to make.  Surprisingly similar to cheesecake. The bar size is pretty small, nothing like a typical cheesecake pie-sliced wedge you would get from making a springform pan.  If you used low-fat or fat-free cream cheese, would it be better? My husband didn't care for it, but he is a picky eater. People said the milk should be ommitted, but mine turned out fine and it still had the right consistency.  I like vanilla, so I added 1 Tbl - turned out good.  I used low-fat cottage cheese to reduce the calories and baked mine in a 9 x 9 glass pan and turned off the oven at 50 minutes, then opened the oven door at the 60-minute mark, and then just took out and placed on the counter - - no need for the normal water bath stuff. BOTTOM LINE:  If you really want true cheesecake, don't make this recipe.  If you are looking for a way to use up your cottage cheese or to be surprised by what you can make with these ingredients, go for it!! If you are looking for lower calories, I'd probably go the route of fat-free or low-fat cream cheese instead of this. *** Update the day after:  The taste really improved drastically about 15-20 hours later...it tasted more like cheesecake.  I think I would cut down just a tiny, tiny, tiny bit on the lemon juice because that was more pronounced the next day.  I served with Smuckers sugar-free blueberry syrup--yum!  Day after deserved a bump from 3 stars to 4.  I wouldn't make it for guests and hubby still doesn't like it, but I was happy I tried it!

Wow~ this could easily be a 5 star recipe for me with minor changes. I made the cheesecake as written, but skipped the crust (not a fan or them!). It was really good. A little heavy on the flour for me though. It's soooo much cheaper to make than a real cheesecake! Next time I will double the recipe, but keep the flour & milk at these measurements and bake in a 9 springform pan. As written the texture is a little too airy, but I think reducing the milk & flour will fix that.

so proud of myself for making this (at least the version i made)!  it's delicious!  however, i modified it b/c i only had pineapple cottage cheese in the house, and no graham crackers.  i didn't use the milk and didn't make the crust (feeding diabetics, so cutting calories is a plus).  i used 1 1/2 tbsps grapefruit juice instead of the lemon juice, and 1/3 cup brown sugar plus one large spoonful of apricot-pineapple jam for the white sugar.  i also added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger, but it doesn't seem to have made any difference.  the result is more like a tort-thing than a cheesecake (esp. without the crust) but it's still really good.  thank you sheryl k for such a delicious starter recipe!  i'm also looking forward to trying your actual recipe at some point!

We love this! I'm trying to find some treats that my diabetic husband can eat. I did cheat with a premade crust. I used lowfat cottage cheese, ww flour & splenda. He loves it! Put a bit of sugar free strawberry jelly on top.

This is a very very good recipe.    I didn't even know you could make a cheesecake-type dessert with cottage cheese!  I bought pineapple cottage cheese by accident (which I hate), so i feverishly searched the internet for cottage cheese recipes and decided to use this.    Once the cheesecake started to set, i topped it with drained pineapple slices and sprinkled with brown sugar to intensify the pineapple flavor already present in the cheesecake.    The only reason to give it 4 stars is this - the milk is absolutely not necessary - gives it too much of a pudding texture.  To make it more cheesecake-like, definitely omit the milk.

I was really surprised by how well this came out.  I put some apple chunks in mine (mistake!) and they weren't all the way cooked when the cake was done, but I will definitely make again without them.  I also made a pretzel crust because I didn't have graham crackers.  That worked out well.  Thanks for the sinful taste without the calories!

Absolutely amazing!  Everyone loved it!  I followed the suggestions and omitted the milk.  It still took longer than 60 minutes to bake but it was so very worth it!  Much cheaper to make and packed with protein.  Next time I think I will make this crustless just to cut the calories and fat even more.  THANK YOU so much for this recipe!!!

I used some suggestions and left the milk out, sub the sugar for 1/3C of honey, and I probably triple the lemon juice and no vanilla since I did not have any on hand. Used the blender and did not have any lump issues at all. I used a store bought graham crust.  I really like it. Served with blueberry syrup and blueberries, yummy. Great way to get some healthier cheescake and use that cottage cheese in the back of your fridge.

This is one of the best recipes I've come across. It's just wonderful! I sometimes replace the lemon juice with orange juice and zest, strawberry juice or pineapple juice, you name it. Have also added coconut. Don't think you can go wrong this recipe. It's delicious, easy and everyone loves it.

LOVED this recipe!  Shared it with a baker friend who couldn't tell it was cottage cheese.  It probably won't "fool" die-hard cheesecake lovers since it's not as dense, but I found the taste and texture excellent and so easy to make.  I had to leave out the vanilla the first time since I had none, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Made a second attempt, and tried to do it gluten-free for a friend.  I left out the flour altogether and used less milk, hoping it would even out, and I used (too much) almond extract instead of the vanilla, and it wasn't as good.  The taste wasn't bad, but somehow the GF grahama crackers got really sticky and almost burned, and the cake part was flatter and not as tasty.  I'll stick with the original from now on!

This is a great cheesecake. Being a diabetic I have to watch the sugar and this is a good alternative to the real thing. I drain the cottage cheese through a cheesecloth.

I really like this, it'll never replace a cream cheese cheesecake but what a great alternative to a really high fat cheesecake! I didn't have graham cracker crumbs so I substituted Trader Joe's LOWFAT CATS COOKIES FOR PEOPLE which are a cinnamon flavored animal cracker (so I omitted the cinnamon called for in the recipe). I just threw them in the blender. I also substituted lemon extract for the vanilla (just to try it).  I then baked the cheesecake in a pie plate rather than the 8-inch pan.  Thanks for a great recipe, a definite keeper!!

I was really suprised. This is a great cheesecake. Next time I will add a little more sugar but otherwise tasted great! No one even knew it was cottage cheese.

DIETERS REVIEW!!

Holy  this cake was better than expected. I am a huge fan of cheesecake and it tasted almost exactly like cheesecake made with cream cheese. I omitted the milk and lemon like everyone else, and drained and puréed the low fat cottage cheese beforehand. Also, for people on a diet you don't need anymore than 1/3 cup of sugar. I used maple syrup

The only problem I had was that there wasn't as much filling as a classic cheesecake recipe would have, but their perfect for cheesecake squares! 

To make it even healthier, I used a healthy crust with 1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup yogurt, and 1 tbsp brown sugar. I put it in the oven for 8 minutes at 325. This would make each "slice" of cheesecake ONLY 175 CALORIES (8 slices for an 8x8 square pan). Believe me, the size for that one slice is pretty  good!!

In the future, I will replace the milk with Greek yogurt instead. If I were to serve this to guests, I would double the filling. If you want to get a little naughty, you can swirl caramel, fruit spread, or Nutella on top of the cheesecake filling before baking (-;

I have made this recipes dozens of times. It tastes great. I use an Oreo cookie crumb base instead. I also find that I end up baking it for 1.5h instead

I never had cottage cheesecake before, but I had cottage cheese so I tried it based on all the good reviews.  My family didn't like it as much as regular cheesecake, but it was very good for what it is.

If I could give this recipe more stars, I certainly would!  The simplicity is appreciated, due to my family's swing shift work schedules.  The taste is a knockout, and I always pull this one out for special occasions.

I omitted the milk and cut down the sugar to about a half cup.  I also did not have graham crackers or butter so I used 3/4 cup of ground almonds and just enough canola oil to make the crust the consistency of damp sand.  I also used brown sugar in the crust.  Lastly, I used fat free cottage cheese and it turned out great. I have to thank the creator for such a better alternative to full-fat cheesecake!

This is an awesome recipe.  I used pie crust instead of graham cracker crumbs as I am diabetic.  I also used 1 brick of fat free cream cheese, used fat free half and half instead of the milk and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  Came out delicious!  I then made sugar free blueberry topping with blueberries, water, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 2 TBS cornstarch and 3TBS Splenda - boiled together until thick - cooled and seerved

I'm home alone this Mother's Day and felt like baking something yummy for myself without having to go shopping for the ingredients.  This recipe was perfect – very simple and so scrumptious.  Cooks, may I advise not to make the mistake of thinking this will taste just like a classic cheesecake.  After all, the recipe doesn’t call for cream cheese!  This “cheesecake” has a distinctive flavor and texture all its own, and is very good, not to mention low fat.  Didn’t change much, but I did use 24 oz. of low-fat cottage cheese and skipped the milk.   I added no fat to the ingredients.  Blended everything in a heavy duty blender until very smooth and used a regular pie shell, which turned out great.  Watch your baking time, though.  I lost track of time, but I don't think it took an hour!   Didn’t even use a topping -- love the simplicity of this pie, and it’s delightful with a good cup of tea or coffee.   I may cut back on the sugar to one-half cup and perhaps add another T. of lemon juice next time I make this.

My whole family LOVED this recipe!  I only used 1 tsp of sugar in the graham cracker crust since my graham crackers were honey-flavored.  Also, I only used 1/3 cup sugar in the cake, since I like my cheesecakes sweet but not too sweet.  Absolutely love the recipe - easy, super healthy and very tasty!

Here is the deal. Omit the milk and lemon juice. Use one TBS of vanilla. Decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup + 2 tbs. ( Use brown sugar). I used 1% whipped cottage cheese and it was great. I didn't have graham crackers so I used corn flakes and added cinnamon and nutmeg I pre-baked the crust at 350 degrees for 8 minutes as well.  I started off baking the cake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and decreased the temperature to 325 degrees for 20 minutes. Next time I will double the filling to make a taller cake.Definitely kicks a cheesecake craving to the curb for a fraction of the calories and fat. Must try it this way! Hope my modifications helped.

It's a wonderful recipe!  After following it to the letter the first time, I tried to make it in different flavors by adding other ingredients like cocoa, almond extract, pumpkin puree etc... So far I made it chocolate, chocolate-cinnamon, orange-almond and pumpkin pie, and I tried making the crust with shredded Kashi cereal or dried coconut flakes.

I've made this three times - all three times I left out the milk.  The first cheesecake was perfect (I had to cook it probably 1 hr 15 min). So the second time I cooked it 1hr15min and it was too long because the cake was too dry.  The third time I went back to 1 hr, took it out when it was firm but still a little moist-looking in the center.  It was the best so far! Perfectly delicious - and my guests loved it!

I only used half the milk the recipe calls for. Next time I won't use any. This has a really good taste, but the consistency isn't like your standard cheese cake, it's too fluffy. I definitely prefer my cheese cakes more dense, so next time I'm not adding the milk at all. I didn't put in any lemon juice, either.  It does have a really nice taste. My dad, who doesn't even like cheesecake normally had two slices!

I cant believe how good this cheesecake was!! I didnt add the milk or lemon juice and doubled the vanilla. Put small batches in the food processor until it was very smooth and creamy. Baked in a spring form pan. This was absolutely delicious!!!! You cant even tell its cottage cheese!! (I did use non fat and it didnt make a difference!) I didnt even tell my husband it was made out of cottage cheese until he was done eating it and he couldnt even tell the difference! I did top with blueberry sauce from this site and some fresh whipped cream. Everyone thought it was from a bakery! Thanks for the great recipe!

Not the best, if you are seriously trying to lose weight and must have cheesecake then go ahead and make it. Don't make it for friends or family though, they will think you are a bad cook. I used lite cottage cheese but I don't think that was the problem.

This turned out excellent. Used 3 eggs (egg whites only) and fat free cottage cheese and made sure to blend everything really well (at least 2 minutes). Turned out smooth and delicious. Covered it with blueberry sauce from this site. AMazing!

Fabulous!  I love traditional cheesecake but need to watch the calories.  This is perfect.  Followed other reviews and omitted milk and lemon juice, added coffee grounds and cinnamon.  Once it's blended the texture is smooth and can't tell the difference from cream cheese.

This is a really light and healthy cheesecake that I keep on making. No one knew it was made of cottage cheese unless I tell them. It's also extremely easy to make. I just put everything in a blender and press the button. You can add some berry sauce to the mix. The best way for it not to crack is to bake in a water bath and let it cool in the oven with the oven turned off for an hour.

So easy! I was looking for a recipe to make a local favorite "smearcase" and thought this might be a good substitute. It was. Lots of things you could do to make it light, I used the original - full fat cottage cheese and milk. Yummy.

This was SO easy and extremely yummy.  If you have been avoiding cheesecake because of the high calories, this is a fantastic substitution.  Use Splenda for an even greater calorie difference.

I thought this recipe was great.  It was light and fluffy.  The only thing I would change would be to use more lemon juice next time (maybe 1 to 2 tablespoons).  Other than that I liked it better than your traditional cheesecake.  I'm sure the calorie count is a lot lower too.

This was delicious and quick to make. Very easy.  I used a store-bought prepared graham pie crust.  I would make this again when time is limited. I would probably add a fruit topping next time.

First of all, I just want to say that I've always HATED cottage cheese!!!  But I was really craving some cheesecake, and didn't have any cream cheese,... so I decided to give it a try.  Because it is blended up, it looks the same as regular cheesecake.  I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   My dad, who also hates cheesecake, and would not have even tried it if I would have told him there was any in it, said it tasted as good as Applebee's cheesecake! VERY GOOD!

Terrific recipe. Easy too and I'm no baker. I was prompted to try it because I had a container of unopened 1% cottage cheese in the refrigerator and needed a quick company dessert. I served it with a drizzle of lucious honey which one person said distracted her from the cheesecake. The recipe is a keeper which I will make again.

Made this to use cottage cheese that I had in the fridge. Used a 9 inch pie plate instead of a square pan. Looked perfect, but not too crazy about the texture of the cheese mixture, a little grainy for my taste. My husband wasn't crazy about it for the same reason. I served it with a homemade blueberry sauce. I am glad I tried it, but prefer cheesecake made with cream cheese as it has a more distinct flavor. Not a bad recipe, just personal preference.

I loved this.  I read lots of reviews and skipped the milk and crust entirely.  I used 4 whole eggs and doubled the c.cheese (2%) baked for about 50 minutes in a 9×13 (because that's all I could find that wasn't busy holding other food) and it came out wonderfully.   The taste isn't quite as dessert-y as I'd like but I dressed it up with fresh whipped cream and candied orange peel, which was soooooo good.  For the versatility,  protein punch, low calorie impact this is a definite keeper.

No, this is not a New York-style cheesecake, but for the fraction of the fuss and calories, well worth making!  I decided just to try a half-batch, baked it in a 7" round pan, and in less than 2 days, I predict it will be gone.  Just a warning: it's so light and delicious, you may find yourself eating an entire cheesecake....

The cheesecake part of the title is a total misnomer . . .but seriously, it doesn't have any cream cheese or even low fat cheese that can be used in cheesecakes, so not sure why you'd expect it to taste like cheesecake.  Admittedly, I hacked this recipe because I thought I had enough cottage cheese but I didn't so I used half Greek yogurt instead.  It's more of a custard, which is what I thought it would be.  It's not a bad custard, but it's not the greatest either.  Hubs was not all that impressed, but he's eating it.  He does not, however, want me to make it again.  It didn't set while baking but firmed up as it cooled.  this, however, is possibly because of my sub but it's all good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Brilliant recipe that I will use again and again. I don't like adding a base as it adds extra calories. I used 1 x 500g of 2% fat cottage cheese, 2 eggs, half cup of honey, 3 tbsp plain flour, pinch of salt and 2 tsp vanilla extract - I didn't  bother with the milk as I like a dense, creamy texture. I blended all these ingredients together until smooth and baked in individual ramekins in a roasting dish half filled with water. I baked them at 160c for 25 minutes and they are divine. Rich, smooth, creamy and I challenge anyone to guess these are low fat. The second time I made these, I added half a cup of crunchy peanut butter to the mixture before blending. Just gorgeous.

I have made this cheesecake twice recently.  The first time I didn't change anything, except omit the cinnamon, and we loved it.  The next time I made it with my homemade Greek yogurt instead of cottage cheese and added the zest of 1/2 lemon.  It was delicious this time also.  Both times I topped it with cherry pie filling. Thank you Sheryl K. for the recipe.

I made this with my mom and sister and it is very good. I couldn't tell if it was cottage cheese or cream cheese. I saved a lot of money by not going out and buying a $30 cheesecake at a bakery. I like how there is enough time for it to bake. I love it !!!!!

I agree with another review, it's just not cheesecake as cheesecake is thought to be... it was ok for a diet desert.  I would not make it again.  It did go together easy.

It seems most reviewers have tweaked this recipe a little.  I made it exactly as written, and I think it's a nice recipe to begin with, but will also tweak it a little myself next time.  I prefer a more obvious base flavor, so will add more lemon juice for a bit of acidity in what is otherwise just a 'sweet dairy' sort of flavour (a matter of taste!).  I'd also consider doubling the filling quantity.  As is, it's abut an inch high in a 9'' pan - which is fine, but I think I'd like more filling!  Thanks for posting an interesting recipe to work with, though :)

Love this recipe!  I used half Splenda and half sugar in the filling, left out the milk and used a container of fat free greek yogurt as part of the 2 cups of cottage cheese. Next time I will double the filling as another reviewer suggested. Cheesecake without the guilt!

This cheesecake is a bit dry but still a "cheesecake" a little extra lemon gives it a bit more cheesecake taste. If you wanted you could double this recipe and put it in a springform pan that works too! I did not use the crust recipe given.

I made this cheesecake. It was terrific for me, but texture was not so good as a real cream cheesecake. Next time, I will make this again by cut amount of sugar and put more sour cream.

Okay I drained, mixed and beat the cottage cheese.  Sorry too many lumps, there were not a lot it just wasn't smooth enough for my taste.  For me nothing takes the place of a cheesecake made with cream cheese. Maybe it's me, but somehow I doubt it,  No one else liked it either!!

This is not a good tasting cheesecake.  You will be not be pleased.  One reviewer was on to something when she said that this recipe is better used for making a banana pie.  It is just too dense. I made a feta and cream cheese pie not too long ago, and that tasted better than this pie, and feta is really dense cheese!!!  The ricotta cheese is too dense by itself. Cream cheese, and sour cream are ingredients that would help this recipe.  If you still want to try this pie, we added bananas and chocolate chips to make it more edible.   Hey you live and your learn!!!! No harm done!!!

I made 1 1/2 recipes since I had 3 cups of cottage cheese to use up. I cut the sugar in half since the crusts tend to be sweet. I bought 2 graham cracker crusts and baked the cheesecakes for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Made a bumbleberry sauce to serve with it, a big hit!

Tried this recipe after reading the reviews, today.  Substituted Splenda for sugar (used 1 T sugar only), Smart Balance for Butter, one egg plus egg beaters for second egg, low fat cottage cheese.  Be sure to blend well in the blender, on high speed.     When cake was fully cooled, I loaded the surface with "frozen fresh" blueberries, covered with 1/3 Cup grape preserves (TMartha Stewart recommends blueberry preserves but I didn't have any), which had been heated, sprinkled with one T sugar and refrigerated for several hours.  I used a springback pan.  To serve, remove side of pan, place on china dish.  This looks like an expensive, bakery tart.  We didn't have any, however, I'm sure some cool whip or whipped cream would have been a nice touch.  This recipe was superb for guest who is diabetic and one who has recently had open heart bypass.  Tastes like the real thing!!!

I love this recipe and I'm not that fond of cottage cheese. I served it to my entire family who loved it and had no idea it was cottage cheese. I used a prepared graham cracker crust and used splenda/sugar blend 1/3 cup instead of sugar. Top with cherries.

This is a nice, light pie. It could use a little more flavor, but still a nice treat. I used Splenda instead of sugar and baked it in a pie pan.

Having never made a cheesecake in my life I was surprised to see that this worked really well. I didn't find it grany or anything because I blended it for quite a while and it worked. The texture is very light and it's hard to get enough of the cake :-) I've topped it with jam and next time I am thinking of adding some raisins to add a bit of excitement. But it's an excellent cake nonetheless and I will surely make this again!

I was looking for a way to use my cottage cheese up, and this is now my "go-to" recipe for doing so when I have a craving for cheesecake.  I used fresh lime juice instead of lemon juice.  Since I had only extra large eggs in the refrigerator, I decreased the amount of milk to 1/4 cup and added in one extra tablespoon of flour.  I topped the slices of cheesecake with whipped cream that I had whisked myself.  Each slice was "crowned" with some fresh blueberries that I had picked.   Yummmmmm!!!

I used a pre-made crust but made the filling as written.  Was delicious!  Light and flavorful. Got rave reviews at a work event.

This gave me something to do with the extra cottage cheese I had on hand. While it's not New York style cheesecake, I didn't expect it to be, it's very tasty. Being allergic to any citrus, I left out the lemon and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. Other than not waiting for it to chill overnight, it set up well, tasted great. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I doubled the vanilla, and omitted the lemon completely. I used 2 Tbs. cornstarch instead of flour, and I did not omit the milk. The crust was very tasty with the cinnamon, and the texture of the cake was like a custard. I served this with fresh strawberries tonight and it was pretty good.

Let's be honest.  YES you CAN definitely tell this is NOT made with regular cream cheese.  If you are a cheesecake lover, this might not just cut it.  BUT, it still states pretty good and the best part for me is, it's totally guilt-free and suga-free since I made with Splenda.  Definitely a keeper for people who wants to enjoy cheesecakes without feeling guilty.

Delicious- creamy and light, great with a fruit topping. My boyfriend didn't even realise it was diet! I puréed the cottage cheese first to avoid the grainy/lumpy texture others complained about. It was perfect! While not a classic New York cheesecake it's delicious and lower in fat!

I used Splenda instead of sugar which was fine but mine tasted a little salty so I would cut back on the salt.  It tasted OK but was just OK as a substitute for high calorie delicious real cheesecake.  Don't think I'll make it again.

This was almost identical to the first cheesecake I ever had, with the exception of the lack of cream cheese, which I added to a 3-c. container of large-curd to make it up the additional 8 oz. for a double recipe (one graham and the other Nilla).  In the 50s, when I tasted this, I hated cottage cheese, even with apple butter or peaches, but the cream cheese made it seem worth trying.  Amazingly, I preferred the texture of the cottage cheese to the smoothness I've come to associate with so-called "gourmet" cheesecakes!

I loved this recipe!  The most affordable "cheesecake" around.  Being a sugar addict, I added a bit more sugar and now realize I didn't need to.  The cake would have been perfectly fine as written.  I did not have lemon juice, so skipped it.  I had some difficulty getting the top of the pie to brown, but maybe it was my oven.  All in all, a fabulous "Google search" discovery.

Tried this recipe when I came into a full box (12)of 16 oz cottage cheese containers and I'm so glad I did!!! My family LOVED IT!!! And loved that its healthier than creamcheese cheesecake. Tastes GREAT. I too strained the cottage cheese for smoothness but thats all! I had to promise to make it again and again. Its so easy, I will!

OMG. I had no idea cottage cheese could taste so heavenly. I used a store-bought crust. I would probably double up the mixture next time but as is, it was amazing

Of course this isn't like real cheesecake but it is a nice, easy substitute. I don't think I will add the milk next time and I will try and strain the cheese a little more. There seem to be endless variations so it will be good to experiment.

I followed the recipe with a few changes- no cinnamon in the crust, half the lemon juice, and added about 1/4 c. Cocoa powder as another reviewer did and half a block of no fat cream cheese I had leftover. If you omit all the lemon juice you lose the "cheesecakey" flavor and get a more puddingy result. The lemon gives it that tang and helps firm the cheesecake. My blender couldn't handle it so I used a bowl and an immersion hand blender. easy! It took about an hour and then I turned the oven off and left it cracked for about 15 minutes. It was firm, rich, and delicious- even my husband was amazed that cottage cheese could be so yummy! Thanks for sharing Oma's recipe!

I used a store bought deep dish pie crust instead of the graham cracker base.  The texture of the cheese turned out great and the filling amount was perfect!  I used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup honey as I wanted to keep it low on sweetness.  Also threw in half of a banana into the mix and skipped the milk and lemon juice.  Put in some lemon grinds for flavor.  Used a hand blender for the mixing.  Had some Kiwi lying around, so decorated with sliced Kiwi and orange grinds, it turned out great!  Thank you for this easy recipe :)

This is a great recipe!! I tried making it and just loved it! Yes it's a bit lighter of a cheesecake, but still very good! I fed it to several people without telling them it was a diet cheesecake and they all loved it! I think the key to making it really good is to make sure and blend the living day lights out of it. I blended the mixture until it was absolutely silky smooth and it baked up super smooth and creamy. The other change I made was to add 1 tbsp more lemon juice AND the zest of a large lemon. This really punched the lemon flavor up and made it taste deliciously lemony. I also only baked it for 50 minutes. This is best cold the next day - being overnight in the freezer firms it up a good deal. I will be making this over and over again!

Delicious! Very light and airy.  I omitted the milk as several reviewers suggested. Excellent flavor, will make again however will try it with the milk. Next time I will try using crushed ginger snaps in place of graham crackers as a nice contract to the lemon. Also might try with a mix of flour, ground almonds and butter. Husband loved it as well!

Excellent recipe.  I substituted the graham crackers and sugar with shortbread biscuits.  I also added grated lemon rind to the filling, and substituted vanilla yoghurt for the milk.

I love cottage cheesecake. I am glad to find this recipe. I can't believed it's so easy to make, and surprisingly it really taste good.  It's so yummy that my husband thought it's the usual cheesecake I buy from the bakeshop.   I used low fat cottage cheese and milk to make it less fattening.  Great recipe!

This is a wonderful substitute for real cheesecake - so much cheaper and healthier.  If you like incredibly dense and thick cheesecake, I wouldn't get your hopes up as the texture is lighter, but it's still delicious.  The key is to blend it very well, at least 2 minutes.  I have made this several times using non-fat cottage cheese and leaving out the milk, and this last time modified it for a pumpkin cheesecake: 1 cup non-fat cottage cheese, 1 cup pumpkin puree, and substituted cinnamon and nutmeg to taste for the lemon and vanilla, and used ginger snap crumbs for the crust.  It was tasty - great for the holidays!

I have made this twice and look forward to making it again. I made it once with 2% and once with 1% cottage cheese and really it made no difference. A very nice recipe enjoyed by all who tried it. Thanks for the recipe!

I used just the filling to make cheese muffins for passover! I substituted 3 tbsp. of matzo meal for the flour and added 1 tsp. baking powder to the mixture. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the mixture and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar. It was delicious - and healthy too!

This was surprisingly good as an alternative to a traditional cheesecake.  I only added 1 T of lemon juice.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

NOt bad...next time I'm going to puree the cottage cheese like another reviewer and add use the lemon juice, i doubled th vanilla and no lemon, it was too vanilla, i think the lemon would have gave it the cheesecake tanginess I like. I did not use the milk, and the conistancy was great. Dont recommend using the milk. Next time I will make these changes and it should be perfect. However it did dissapear quite fast!! Nice and light, and with less calories and fat..its a bonus!!

It was really easy and quick to make.  I got rave reviews from friends and thought that it just about tastes as good as regular cheesecake!

With a good blender, this recipe comes out very smooth. Not the same as cheesecake but c great low-fat alternative when made with non-fat cottage cheese and other substitutes.
