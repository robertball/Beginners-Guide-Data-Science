Made this for a family get together recently and it was a big hit.  I made a couple of small revisions.  Sauteed the cabbage in olive oil instead of boiling it, adding onion as the cabbage started to get tender and the mushrooms once the onions started getting translucent.  Also added a head of roasted garlic at the end.

Was uncertain of the combination of the 2 veggies together but it turned out really good.  Didn't take long to throw together and went great with the rest of the meal.

This was a good recipe. I sauteed two leeks and a small onion for a couple of minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.

This was DELICIOUS!  I was a little skeptical at first about combining the two, but it was great.  It was also very quick & easy.  I used "baby portabella" mushrooms and they were really flavorful and complimented the cabbage.  I can't wait to use this recipe again.

My husband doesn't like cabbage at all, but he loved this dish!  I was hoping to have some leftovers, but there was none left.  It is super easy to make and very tasty.  Minimal effort, maximum reward.

Made this last night for supper with wife,  It helped to cover the Iron skillet/Pot to steam to softness we liked.  Salt to your taste while cooking on medium heat.

We paired this with a Chateau Greysac Medoc Bordeaux and a Louis Bernard CDR Villages that we did a tasting of. Both wines matched very well with the earthy, peppery character of the cabbage & mushrooms. Will definitely make this again!

Very good! I also liked a bit of dill weed in this dish. I served with fresh steamed green beans and rice for a lovely light meal.

LOVE this recipe! There were no leftovers although it was only my sister and I that ate the dish.  I made it last week and will be making it again this week. Might just have to double the portions to make sure I have leftovers! Thank you for this recipe!

Not bad at all!  I had some pre-cooked cabbage so just threw it all in the pan at once.  For my taste, I would have had to cook that cabbage longer than a total of 10 minutes.  I had some leftover diced onion so threw that in there too.  It went very well with italian sausage.

Very simple and tasty! It took me less than 25 minutes since I bought sliced portobellas on sale. I used red cabbage which added a colorful flair. I have never cooked portobella mushrooms before and this turned out perfect.

I made it with kale instead of cabbage and it was delish!  Can't wait to try it with cabbage.

This actually suprised me.  I didnt think it was going to be that great but even my seven year old ate it.  Not very appealing on the plate but definitely in the tummy.

This was one of the easiest dishes and most rewarding I've made in a while.  Very yummy side dish.  I made mine with some Kielbasa - the vegetarian kind... No modifications needed for our tastes!

I liked this recipe for its simplicity. I followed the directions exactly as written and mine didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped; I found the cabbage had a (very slight) bitter taste. Next time I might add a touch more sugar, and I might let the cabbage cook a bit longer. I think I may add more ingredients next time as well - maybe some onion or other things. Despite this, as the recipe stands it's good, maybe do a bit of tweaking if you find it isn't quite to your taste.  I'll definitely make it again.

I just happened to have half a head of cabbage and twin portobello mushroom caps in the fridge which were leftovers for from other recipes so I thought this was a perfect way to use them up.  I added half a chopped onion after the cabbage was half done before the mushrooms went in.  I lowered the heat, added a little water and put a ham slice across the top before covering it and steaming a bit to soften everything up. With the the ham it wasn’t a perfect dish for two.  There were no leftovers.   I’ve made friends made fried cabbage before but the portobellos gave  it a completely different flavor and I’ll make it again.

Quick and easy, I added some spiced up rice on the side and is a quick solution for a work lunch that i didn't have time to prepare for.

This dish was very easy to make.  I added a green bell pepper and half a white onion.  Covering creates some juice too.

Enjoyed this very much. Only gave it 4 stars because I thought it would be better with caramelized onions! Served it with buttered noodles! DH loved it as well. Always on the prowl for good vegetarian recipes. We try to only eat meat once a week.

Better than I expected from its simplicity - great for when you are in a hurry. I served it with rice for a vegetarian main dish.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I added minced garlic and finely chopped onion along with the cabbage.  I also used a bit more olive oil than called for.  Even the kids ate it and rated it a strong B+.

Delicious!!  I added some cajun to go with our cajun burgers and it was amazing!  My whole family loved it and we will definitely make it again.
