5.29.19  What a nice way to style up an ordinary scrambled egg breakfast.  I mixed the diced ham into the eggs when scrambling, and definitely can see adding some chopped jalapeño, onions, bell pepper, and serving with sour cream and salsa.  Giving the tortilla a thin coating of butter yielded a crispy tortilla with good eye appeal.

I used Smithfield sausage instead of the ham. Delicious and so easy to make. I actually added the cooked sausage to the eggs and then topped with the cheese. Will make this again. Thank you.

I made it once following the recipe but using ham left over from Christmas and regular tortillas. That was good. This time I didn't have any ham, so I used bacon and bacon grease instead of butter (I know so healthy). I also made tater tots as hash browns and some of my fam added those into the quesadilla too.

I have been making this recipe for years. I have a pizza cutter, so I warm the 2 tortillas on both sides and then fill with scrambled eggs, grated cheddar, ham and black olives, and top with the second tortilla. I cut each 'sandwich' into 6 pieces. A great breakfast or lunch. They can be made ahead and refrigerated, then rewarmed in a saute pan.

Delicious and easy!  This is definitely a great base recipe and could easily be dressed up with additional mix-ins (sautéed veggies, bacon, different kinds of cheese, etc) or served with sour cream, guac, or salsa just like regular quesadillas.  Yummy!

Great recipe! Perfect for breakfast, lunch or even brunch! I made no changes, but next time I may try it with sausage and pepper jack. My kids loved it too!

This was so easy to make and a great on the go breakfast!  For us it was a little plain, so, next time I would add some sauteed onions and peppers to taste more like a Denver omelette.   I think it is a great starter recipe though and would be easy to change up  to your favorite fillings.

We really liked these. My only change was accidentally using 1/2 cup of cheese on each. For the tortillas I used Trader Joes Homemade brand tortillas. These were very simple and quick to make. I will make them again. Ty!

Simple recipe and very tasty! This is easy to customize with sausage or bacon instead of ham, or by adding different seasonings or salsa. Spreading butter on the tortilla really adds a nice flavor too.

Perfect as is or as a base for Mexican inspiration, either way this is a hit with our family.

My boys loved these quesadillas! Plus they were a super easy breakfast for dinner. I added the ham on top of the cheese first instead of the egg and it seemed to help things stick better.

These were quite delicious. I had to use gluten free flour tortillas, but they were delicious too. I chose to add the ham to the scrambled eggs. It just seemed easier to help keep the whole thing together. Thank you for the recipe.

Very quick and easy recipe. I used the Smithville Sausage links instead of the ham and it was delicious. Next time I am going to top it with a pico de Gallo and avocado for more flavor. Overall, an excellent recipe!

Such an easy breakfast (or dinner) to make. It takes the egg sandwich to a whole different level. I especially like the crunch of the tortilla shell.

I had leftover Tortillas that always land in the garbage,  then I saw this, well let me tell ya I made these this morning, did not change anything. Obviously people say they made it BUT changed the whole recipe lol, I find that funny and frustrating at the same time, I rate as is, no changes, don't rate if it wasn't the same, do your own changes after trying this one. :)

I really like this recipe only I would use American cheese instead of cheddar because it gives it a creaminess and also doesn’t take away from the flavor of the eggs. As a rule I never use cheddar cheese with eggs. I also added onions when I was cooking the eggs and used farm fresh eggs. As always, I love the Smithfield hams.

An easy and convenient breakfast enjoyed by all. I can see experimenting with additional veggies and breakfast meats. Great with salsa and sour cream as well.

The teenager I made this for said it was "amazing." He said all it needed was a little more cheese to make it even more amazing! I used Smithfield sliced honey ham, which I chopped up and was great in this recipe. I scaled this down to 2 servings. My cooking method was a little different so I could cook 2 tortillas at once. I folded the tortillas in half and put both halves in a large skillet. In each tortilla I put cheese, added the eggs (which I cooked with the ham) then more cheese, closed each tortilla and cooked, flipped and cooked until browned and melted. This was a great idea and a nice alternative to breakfast burritos.

Kids loved it, but it definitely needed more filling. These nice photos with lots of filling aren't really the truth of the recipe, which needs a lot more filling. Or smaller tortillas. Followed instructions exactly except for using whole wheat tortillas. I'd make it again :)

I'm rating this a 4 because I believe it's a great starting point.  We are used to a little more flavor in anything that has a tortilla attached to it.  I would have liked a little salsa or perhaps just a jalapeno or onion with this.  I would go heavy on the cheese, too (maybe pepper jack?).  We liked the ham with this and will absolutely buy this product again!   I will definitely make this soon with a few changes.  I do think my granddaughters would scarf this down!  Thanks for the recipe!
