One word - AWESOME!  The flavors are simply superb!  Hubby and I made this while baking herbed Focaccia bread today.  The aroma in the kitchen was heavenly!  We would make the suggestion that if you do not have a food processor or manual chopper, then allow yourself at least an hour of prep time for hand chopping everything.  The sun dried tomatoes, if not purchased already sliced/diced, will take a long time to cut.  We used shears to cut them into strips, then cut them again crosswise into diced-size pieces.  We found this to be easier than using a knife.  Also, remove the outer layer or two of leaves on the artichokes; even the canned/jarred hearts can have tough leaves still attached.  We changed the recipe slightly by using only the green portion of 5 green onions and left out the chives (they weren't available) and it was devine. We made additional tubs of spread to give out tomorrow with the Focaccia bread as Christmas gifts for visiting relatives.  Can't wait to see their smiles!  Merry Christmas everyone!

Exceptional.  Mouthwatering good and all flavors I love that blended together SO well.  I prepared this following the recipe closely, tho' I did mince, rather than chop, the garlic, reduced the salt by half and added fresh ground pepper.  I made this as part of an array of bagel spreads, but I will absolutely remember this recipe the next time I need a spread for crackers or crostini - it will be a real pleaser, I'm sure.

I started out looking for a recipe for tortillas roll-ups using sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. I came across this recipe and thought it might work. Turned out GREAT! I modified somewhat...first I halved the recipes, used 3/4 cup cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp garlic salt (instead of garlic and salt), 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and a splash of lemon juice. I then spread the mixture on a tortilla wrap, rolled it, wrapped it in plastic wrap, refrigerate overnight and cut into 1 inches pieces the next day. They were delicious!!

I've served this spread at everything from baby showers in Indiana to diplomatic receptions in Kathmandu, and it's been consistently highly praised.  Incredibly easy to make, it never fails to draw a crowd of people with crakers -- and it usually draws several requests for the recipe as well.

Also a bonus:  because I've made this in so many varied locations, I haven't always been able to find fresh parsely or chives.  Rather then throwing in dry, I usually either just left the herbs out, or added something of a similar flavor/texture.  This recipe is balanced enough not to suffer from the changes.

YUM.  This recipe is a delicious change from spinach dip, and all of the vegetables look like bright confetti in the cream cheese--very festive looking!  Use artichoke bottoms if you don't like the sometimes tough leaves from artichoke hearts, and use top quality black olives.  Definitely make the night before to allow flavors to meld.  An alternative to serving with crackers would be to use the spread with hothouse (English) cucumber slices for a light snack (great for those on a low carb diet or for those who can't tolerate gluten from the crackers).

Fabulous! Very simple to make....Just put everything in a food processor and let it do the work. Love the flavors. Will be serving this tomorrow for friends who are coming over for a Northern Italian feast. Very simple and tasty. Don't be put off by the negative feedback left by some.

I substituted regular tomato for the sundried tomato cause it was just too expensive, but it still turned out great.  I also left out the olives and added bacon.

I prepared this dip for an office party and for my-inlaws.  Everyone raved!  I omitted the salt the second time because the artichoke hearts seemed to add plenty.  A very tasty appetizer.

I used reduced fat cream cheese. I made no other changes. This is CRAZY good. No, really. The longer it sits, the better it gets. I had this today schmeared on one half of a Bagel Thin--it took everything I had to hold myself back to go make another. EXCELLENT.

AAAAA+++++! Just got back from a party where I took this dip. Not only did it receive rave reviews, at least one person left with a big glob of it on a paper plate to eat at home and I must forward this recipe to the rest of them. It was a big HIT!  My family likes it, too, including the 65 yr. old hubby and the 17 yr old son. These flavors are classic and span the age gap!  I made it as directed but did add about 1 tablespoon of minced roasted red peppers. I pulsed the artichokes, olives, onions, tomatoes in the blender and then added the cream cheese. I wish I had removed the pulsed items and finished it in my mixer as mine had all the flavor but not the texture I wanted. That was my fault, I was being lazy and the ingredients got pulverized.  SALT: I made this as directed and - at first - it seemed salty. I was worried big time! BUT - it married together overnight and the flavors were perfect the next day. If you're worried about salt, you might want to rinse the olives or use 1/2 tea. salt in the recipe.  Would love to try this with green olives in lieu of the black ones. And I do recommend at least a little roasted red pepper. You MUST make this a day ahead, it tastes entirely different the next day.  Thanks, Hoffius, for sharing this FANTASTIC recipe!

This recipe is great!  If you have a food processor it's really quick.  I left out the olives, and I still liked it.

Great mix of flavors!  I had to omit the green onions, but added a little onion powder and a few shakes of seasoned salt.  We had this with "Hint of Salt" Wheat Thins crackers.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is good and I will definitely make again.  I think the number of servings is way off as I made 1/2 the recipe and it was more than enough for 6-8 people as an appetizer.

This is spread is amazing.  I used a food processor to speed up the chopping stage but other than that it was a very simple recipe.  Every day that it sits in the refrigerator, the better it gets, gently blending all of those bold spices together.  This is a must try!!!

Using the food processor as recomended by other reviewers, made this extremely easy to make. Different, but tasty. Would probably be good as a dip with vegetables.

Excellent dip.  Leftovers are perfect for stuffed mushrooms.  I just added a little parmesean, panko, and chopped sweet roasted peppers.  Stuff mushrooms and bake.  Yummy!

This reminded me of a tastier version of Philadelphia Cream Cheese's Vegetable Garden Spread.  Very oniony, very savory.  I served it with bagel crisps and french baguette slices.  I even had it the next morning on a bagel.  Thanks for a great recipe, Hoffius.

I made this to bring to work for Valentine's Day. Everyone love it! I had made yogurt cheese, using a combination of non-fat Greek, and full fat Greek yogurts, that I had already added minced garlic, salt, pepper, and dried chives to. I found this recipe, and added the rest of the ingredients. It was very popular with my co-workers!

Absolutely delish and different than anything I have ever had and I make Artichoke Dip all the time. Nothing much to add to other reviews other than yes it does make a large quantity! Great tailgate item or to bring to a large party.

Fantastic!  I made this along with several other recipes from allrecipes.com for a Baby Shower I hosted recently.  This was GONE fast!  People loved it!  I made a second batch and the leftover from that I have used in scramble eggs ...so it's not just for crackers and bread.  It is fantastic!  I will make this over and over.  Good Job Hoffius, thank you for sharing!

I made this for our annual New Year's Eve party.  Everyone that tried it loved it.  Definitely does need time in the refrigerator  to marinate.  The taste is excellent.  Be sure to make this as written.  I used the dried sundried tomatoes.  It only takes a short time to soften them.  Just put them in a small bowl in warm water, then start preparing the rest of the ingredients.  They will be ready when you need them.  And they are less expensive than the ones packed in oil.

This recipe is a keeper.  As a traditionalist, I chopped everything by hand and it took me about 25 minutes start to finish.  I found that salt is not necessary if you use fresh garlic and do not rinse the olives or artichoke hearts, the little bit of brine that is one the veggies leaves the dip well-salted.  I may try using basil, green or Kalamata olives, and roasted red peppers like others have suggested, all sound like great options.  Diced bacon or prosciutto may also be winners in this one.  Leftovers are indeed great in mushrooms or as fried wonton stuffing.

This is awesome!  I puree the artichokes (after removing any tough leaves) in my mini-processor.  It is great with beer bread!

This had really great flavor. I added 6-7 oz of sour cream and omitted the black olives. Everyone liked it, but I'm not sure I'll make it again. Quite a few ingredients for a dip, I might rather spend my prep time on something more substantial. But I did really like it.

I made this as written.  I left out the parsley and chives because I didn't have either on hand.  I took it to an office pot luck and gave the recipe out several times.  This makes alot.  Served with the flatbread crackers.

I made this for a family get together and since we are all trying to watch the caloric intake, I adjusted it a little. Instead of 2-8oz blocks of cream cheese, I used 8oz of cream cheese and 8oz of Non-fat greek yogurt (I used Chobani). It was extremely creamy and thick with half of the fat. I think I could even use 4oz cream cheese and the rest yogurt. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and everyone LOVED it. We toasted some french bread to go with it and preferred that over crackers.

I had some leftover artichokes that needed to be used, so I decided to make this.  I made a mini version, about 1/4 of this recipe.  I put it together in the afternoon and we decided to give it a try as a little appy before dinner.  Neither one of us was terribly impressed, but I thought it would improve if the flavors melded overnight.  Well, it did improve some, but not as much as I had hoped.  We love all the ingredients, but combined altogether, we thought it was just ok.

This recipe has been a hit several times, and I am always asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  Goes well with bruschetta for an Italian themed night.  Recommend serving on garlic toast.

This had incredible flavor and was the perfect appetizer for a dinner party I had this weekend. It made a lot, so I had plenty left over for a football game the next day. Making it the night before is key so all the flavors blend together. Wonderful recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This was tastey! My local grocery store sells a dip very similar to this with gorgonzola, so I added probably 3 oz to the dip and I'm glad I did, it took the flavor to a whole nother level.  Delish!

Huge hit at an Italian themed party.  I made the recipe as stated but did make the day before.  This does make a large quantity of spread.  Served with toasted packaged garlic bread toasts.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This spread was just ok and not worth the cost of all the ingredients.  This was served at a holiday open house and judging by the amount lef, was the least favorite appetizer served.  I also made a baked crab spread which everyone raved about.  No one asked for this recipe and I will not make this again.

This is so good...with a few changes...I used fresh basil instead of parsley, but only a few Tbs, chopped.  I also added a little mayo, some freshly grated pecorino romano cheese and cut back on the salt since the cheese is already salty.  I used garlic powder, as I don't like raw garlic, and last, a splash of fresh lemon juice.  I tasted it before I added the pec romano, and I must say, the addition of that took it over the top!

Loved this dip. I added more black olives and used my mini chopper. Very easy to put together. Hubby said it was like his Mom used to make. Soften the cream cheese in the microwave for 30-40 seconds then stir in all chopped ingredients. Line a bowl with plastic wrap, scoop the dip in and put in fridge for 2-3 hours. Flip the bowl out on a plate, remove the plastic wrap and serve with crackers around the dip.

Really good!  Like others have done, I put all of the ingredients on the food processor.  I did only a couple of pulses so it was still chunky.  It does make a lot of spread!

This is a fabulous appetizer!  I have made it several times and each time there have been numerous requests for the recipe.  I use drained, sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil rather than plumping the regular ones in hot water.  I guarantee the bowl will be empty if you make this yummy spread.

Well......I just made this in anticipation of tomorrow's lasagna dinner for the in-laws.  It is wonderful even before sitting overnight to meld the flavors!!  Mine does not look quite as chunky as the picture, probably because I used the food processor like other reviewers.  I only used 4 green onions (seemed like plenty) and I used kalamata olives which made the whole dip really flavorful......it needed the salt.  Great recipe, thanks

this cheese spread was the HIT of my new years eve party last night. Great flavor!!! I am thinking for the left overs (i doubled the batch) I want to throw some bacon in it and heat it up in the oven. I think it would be just as good!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!! Its a keeper for sure!

this is very good, quick to prepare, and goes nice with toasted baguette slices. I didn't have any fresh basil but would like to sub out the parsley for the basil next time. thanks for this easy recipe that can be used with a variety of crackers, breads, etc.

I've made this at least 6 times now and it is always delicious. Crackers will do but it's so much better on bread, like the French Baguettes recipe from this site. Yum. Only problem with the recipe is that chilling it several hours (depending on your definition of several) is not going to be enough. This should really be made a day ahead if possible you can really tell the difference.

this was very good. I flaked and only added one package of cream cheese, diced everything in the food processor and it was still amazing. I may add less garlic next time, but that may have been different had I had all the cream cheese in there.

This is a very flavorful spread.  I made it a little easier by using my food processor to chop up the artichokes and then added the other ingredients (except olives and cream cheese).  I pulsed together till chopped finely then mixed in the cream cheese and olives with a spoon.  I omitted the parsley.  It makes a lot so it's a good choice if you've got a large group.  I served with crackers but think I'll serve with slices of baguette next time.  Great with wine!  I don't think it would be very well received by kids but the adults loved it.

Excellent!  I made for a wine tasting/food pairing party.  Used roasted red peppers for sun dried tomato and left out chives.  Also removed outer leaves on artichoke hearts as another mentioned. Added some fresh grated Parm cheese, too.  Better if left to marry overnight.

Excellent! Very yummy... next time I will try it with basil instead of parsley.  I tried to save a little $ so I bought dried tomatoes from the bulk bin and rehydrated them in hot water, but I don't recommend it. They tasted a little sour and a little soggy.  Next time I'm going to try fresh tomatoes. Still very delicious - I served it with toasted sesame water crackers. :)

I have made this recipe several times and love it! I use just 4 green onions, and like to smoosh the garlic into a paste with my knife. I don't always have chives, but they do add a layer of flavor that's delicious. And don't skip the parsley! It really helps balance out the saltiness. Depending on your palate, you may not need the full teaspoon of salt. Making it a day ahead marries the flavors the best! So yummy on all sorts of breads and crackers, and really satisfies that Tuscan/olive craving :)

Fantastic flavor!  Here's what I did.  Process fresh garlic cloves in food processor until finely chopped.  Add drained tomatoes, artichoke hearts (with tough outer leaves removed) olives, and parsley.  Since I used marinated artichoke hearts I omitted the salt.   Pulse until coarsely chopped.  The first time I made it I added the cream cheese at this point and processed all together.  This resulted in more of a fine puree, which tasted fabulous but wasn't as pretty as when I combined the cream cheese to chopped ingredients with a mixer.    I used some of the green onion tops in place of the chives. Either way it's all my favorite flavors in one place.  Definitely a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Added roasted red peppers, used roasted garlic,  substituted shallots & more parsley for chives, stick blended about a cup of the chunky stuff into a paste, added it back in for extra creaminess/ spread ability.  Big hit at late night fire pit party served with grainy bread toast triangles and bites of hot Italian sausage.

My mom made this spread as a pre-Christmas dinner appetizer. It was fantastic, couldn't stop eating it! I immediately asked for the recipe so I can make it for a New Year's Eve party we'll be attending. Can't wait for the reactions! My husband doesn't like any type of onion or tomatoes and he ate a bunch of it & thought it was great too.

I have made this recipe many times and never tire of it. It's always a hit. People always want the recipe. I have had people tell me they love it even though they hate everything that's in it. You can't go wrong with this one!  If you aren't fond of chopping, don't be afraid to use a food processor.

This was delicious. Mine turned out pink from the sun dried tomatoes. Maybe it was because I rehydrated the kind that come in a bag. Next time I will chop them up dry and see how it turns out.

I made this for New Year's Eve. My guests and I loved it. I left out the black olives because my husband doesn't like them. I also left out the chives because I thought that might be too much onion. Next time I will try it as the recipe is written.

This has become my most requested, 'signature' appetizer. Honestly, so many people have asked me for this recipe. 
I made it exactly as written the first few times because it is that good, but we have since modified it slightly for our preference. ( we go a bit lighter on the dried tomatoes, more black olives- yum!)  
Just a note, using scissors for the tomatoes has truly made this easier, great suggestion from a previous commenter.
Thank you for this recipe!

Prepared this just as written, served on New Year's Eve.  No one enjoyed it at all.  Tasted like cream cheese - very little flavor other than a hint of garlic - the cream cheese is just overpowering. Perhaps 1/2 the amount of cream cheese, and some mayo or sour cream?  Along with adding a healthy dose of fresh herbs (basil, oregano - something!) to enhance the flavor of the sun-dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts.

This was really good! I made it ahead of time as suggested. At first I only  put in 1 and 1/2 blocks of cream cheese since some reviewers stated it tasted like cream cheese. It was really tangy! So I added in the full amount and it was great. I hand chopped everything and followed the directions exactly. It was pretty and tasty.

I made this for a Christmas tree hopping party, and what a hit it was!  I had to print the recipe for several people.  I used fresh tomato instead of sundried, and added extra garlic.  This was nothing short of delicious!

I halved the recipe since I was serving a small group (measurements as listed would be perfect for a big crowd). I have made quite a few different artichoke or artichoke spinach dips over the years and this one sounded intriguing. However, as I began prepping and mixing the dip I began to question the ratio of ingredients and it's final outcome, but I continued the directions as is only cutting each ingredient measure in half. When completed it looked like a whole lot of cream cheese (I used 8 oz crm cheese, 1/2 of 14 oz can artichokes, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, etc.) compared to everything else, and it tasted just liked it looked (which is NOT like the dip on the crackers pictured with this recipe). To try and save it I ended up chopping the remaining 1/2 can artichokes and using the full amount of chopped blk olives, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic to up the taste and texture. It still was missing something so I added about 1/4 cup crumbled feta. Even with these additions I was disappointed in the final product. Letting flavors marry or heating did nothing for it. Will not be making again.

I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I used roasted red bell peppers instead. I chopped everything up with my food processor. I also let the cream cheese warm to room temperature and then whipped it with my mixer to make sure it was smooth. Then I added the cream cheese to the rest and mixed it together w/ my electric mixer. The flavors were wonderful. Everyone raved about it. We had an Italian/pasta night and it went well with everything. Yum yum!

Incredible as is!  I followed this recipe as is (the only change was I used sun dried tomotates in a jar so they were in an oil base). I increased (tripled or so) the recipe and everyone LOVED it and I keep getting requests for it.  It was fairly quick and easy to make and sooo delicious!!!

This was pretty good...think I will omit the green onion, though.  Did add a couple of tablespoons of milk to make it creamier and took other's suggestions to make it the day before.

I took this to an Italian food themed Book Club. I served it with Crostini crackers.
I didn't have Parsley or Chives so I added some jarred pesto. I wasn't too excited about it till the next day.  It really needs to be made ahead to let the flavors blend.  I later used the leftovers in a Chicken and Sundried Tomato Bruschetta.  It was really good.

Very Good recipe. The ingredients definitely need time to marinate, so I usually make the spread the night before I serve it. I also usually leave out black olives and artichokes. If I didn't have fresh parsley,garlic, and chives then I just used seasoning instead and it still came out good.

We love this recipe, but I just can't resist making substitutions or addtions. I added a little pesto and a little less garlic as there is garlic in the pesto and it was just yummy. However, I am sure it is terrific just the way it is.

My cousin served this at our New Year's Eve get-together, and it was fantastic!  Looking forward to making it myself at home.  The only thing she changed is that she left out the olives, which was OK because most people in our family don't like them.

I really liked the combination of ingredients here.  They work well.  Only problem is that I really wanted a dip, not a spread, so I could have added more mayo to thin it out.  Also, everyone thought it was a seafood spread (I guess because of the sun-dried tomatoes in it... must have looked like crab or shrimp or something).  Next time I'll put up a little sign.  But this was good.  Would make it again.

This Cheese Spread is amazing!  I have served it at numerous parties and its usually gone within the first hour.  The funny part is to watch everyone stand around and debate what is all in it!

I've made this a few times but left out the olives and sun dried tomatoes (used sliced up fresh ones instead) and it has been great! We always put it on bread and it tastes terrific!

I made several modifications to the recipe...no black olives (personal taste), less parsley (dried), lots o garlic, and no chives (didn't have them).  I used the spread to make tortilla roll-ups as suggested by a previous reviewer.  I then took the left over spread, added a little milk and softened it in the microwave and used it as a dip with blue corn chips.  The chip dip version was a HUGE hit with the party goers.

I did all the chopping in the food processor, removed to a bowl, and then mixed cream cheese and garlic in the food processor. I added the chopped ingredients, pulsed a few times and was done.  I did cut back on the green onions and skipped the chives.  We really enjoyed this the next day, and it took very little time or clean up.

This dip received rave reviews all around at an event this week.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of swapping out roasted red peppers that had been drained and patted dry for the sun-dried tomato due to my personal preferences.

I followed the recipe to the letter and made it for a gaming night with friends.  First off it made a lot even for five people, so I would cut the recipe in half if you are planning on making it.  It's kind of bland  so I would suggest adding extra garlic (probably double) and a bold herb like basil.  I don't plan on making this again simply because it was so bland and lacked a punch of flavor.

This was a tasty dip, although I might rename it Green Onion Dip with Artichokes, as the onions were quite prevalent. And I only used three! I also skipped the tomatoes, and I used 1 c Greek yogurt in place of half of the cream cheese (which made it creamier; all cream cheese would have had the consistency of a cheese ball vs a dip).  It definitely is better after a few hours to let the flavors meld.

I've been looking for a go-to recipe to bring to get-togethers, and now I've found it. I didn't have fresh parsley or chives, used dry. Also didn't have time to let it sit...I made it about an hour before I had to leave for a party. Still, it was awesome! Even the kids at the party ate it which I wasn't expecting. Everyone wanted the recipe, but this one's going to be my (ok, our) little secret!

I used my food processor which turned this into a hummus-like consistency.  Everyone enjoyed it, agreed it is a good party dip, and were surprised when they saw the ingredient list.  They said they would not have eaten it chunky and if they had known what was in it.  So, a good party dip if made into hummus.

This is a great recipe. I reduced the salt to 3/4tsp. With all the other tasty ingredients, I just didn't think it was necessary. I also added only 6 green onions, fearing the onion flavor would be too strong. In the end, I wished I had used all 8 after all. I also used kalamata olives. The spread turned out to be delicious, and I'll definitely make it again.

It was ok. I felt like I wanted to heat it up and cook it. I did happen to make bruschetta as well and half way through the night tossed the bruschetta as a layer on top and then people chowed down. I might try this heated somehow...

Really good and easy to make.  My version was a little runny (I soaked the tomatoes too long and didn't let them drain enough b/f adding) but still wonderful.  Everyone is right about it being even better the second day.

Excellent! Definitely different than anything I have made before. I used 4 cloves of garlic and it was overwhelming, and I love my garlic. I didn't have the chives or basil and it was still fantastic. Served with a sliced baguette.

When I made it I used 2 roma tomatoes instead of the sundried tomatoes, 1/4 cup of minced white onion omitted the green onions, used a whole can of olives, added 3/4 cup of sour cream, 3 tbsp milk (to thin it) and 3/4 package of pepperoni minced and 1tbsp fresh basil and some black pepper - came out deliciously awesome

I made this recipe and based on the reviews limited the garlic and the scallion to one each. The flavor was there but not overpowering.  When it comes these ingredients I always start out on the low side because you can always add more.  I added the rest of the ingredients according to the recipe.  Everyone liked it.

This was the worst dip I have ever made.  The garlic and onion over whelmed the entire dip, you couldn't taste anything else.  Most people only took one taste of it and didn't go back for seconds, I came home from a party with a bowl full of this dip and tossed it.

I made this this past weekend when we had guests over for dinner.  They absolutely loved it and asked for the recipe. I omitted the onions and chives (because I didn't have any on hand) but it still turned out delicious!  A great recipe!

I like this recipe a lot.  I was wondering if anyone has used the artichoke hearts in oil?  I used the ones in  water and the recipe seemed to lack something.  It did taste better the second day though.

Somehow I printed this recipe for 20 servings and it made 2 HUGE "logs". I shaped them in a 3 lb. box from the cream cheese I bought. Brother in-law threatened to call his lawyer on me for the crime of feeding him so well! Everybody raved! Will make again but scale down to make one "log". Served it with garlic flavored bagel crisps. Yummy! I can tell you it gets more oniony the more days you have leftovers.

Hmmm..... left out the fresh chives and substituted green olives for the black ones. I'm giving this 3* just because my mom loved it, oh well... though she added tons of ketchup to each portion she had. In my opinion the onion and garlic flavor was overpowering, i couldn't taste the other ingredients. My mom said it just lacked something (i guess that's why she added such a huge amount of ketchup). I think i'm going to give this another chance but tweaking it a little bit!!! thanx for the recipe anyway

This is wonderful. I'm alleric to cheese and the tofu cream cheese worked wonderfully and no one new it wasn't cream cheese. I also subsituted the roasted red peppers for the sun dried tomatos and whipped it all up in a food prosser making that much faster.  Will do this again. It's a keeper. 5 star winner...

Interesting flavors.  I made this based on what I had on hand:  garlic powder; white onion; oil packed tomatoes; dried parsley; not quite enough artichoke.  Thanks for the recipe. The serving size on this recipe for the cream cheese is 2.7 ounces; the serving size on the cream cheese package is one ounce.

OH MY GOSH, this was soooo good!  I made some changes but anyone can customize this to their own preferences.  I halved the recipe since it was just for my family.  I added 4 tablespoons softened butter, a pinch of crushed red pepper and crushed rosemary, skipped the artichokes and green onions, and subbed chopped roasted red pepper for the sun-dried tomatoes and basil for the parsley.  This was so delicious and easy, we'll be having this often!!!!

My husband and I loved this-I added 1/2 the amount of tomatoes though.  However, I found that this is not ideal for a potluck--too many "different ingredents". Oh well, more for me!  Next time I will half the recipe, just for the two of us.

This was pretty good.  The only change I made was to leave out the olives since I don't like them and I didn't have any chives.  I'll probably make it again.

This sounded like it should be good.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it at a party and no one touched it.  I covered it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge, but every time I opend the fridge the smell of garlic was overwhelming and we wound up not eating it.  Maybe my guest's were full of chicken wings and meatballs but I would not make this again.
