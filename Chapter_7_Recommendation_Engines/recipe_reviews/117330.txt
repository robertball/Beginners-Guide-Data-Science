Great Recipe, but I did not cook my dough first.  Just make sure you preheat your oven to 450-475 before you bake it and you will have a perfect crust.  Just like they do in the pizza shops...

I have never made dough before in my whole entire life...and when my friend came over (who is a chef) she said that the dough was so perfect! And it tasted so good! To whoever wrote this recipe you rock! And my kids want me to make it all the time...Also I wanted to say use a little bit of corn meal on the pizza stone (or pan) so the pizza won't stick to the bottom.

We weren't happy with the bake then top then bake some more results, it was too crunchy for our liking.  We top the raw dough then bake at 350 for 30 mins now.

My hubby really enjoyed this pie tonight. As your recipe states, the only way I make pizza is to bake it first and then add the toppings as we like the underside of our pizza nice and browned. Used fresh mozarella which made a world of difference. Thanks Gaylene!

This was great.  The dough is great.  I used rapid rise yeast and just added it in with the dry ingredients.  It skips the step of dissolving in warm water.

Pizza tasted pretty good...the most like a pizzaria that I've tried.  The only complaint I have is that the crust didn't really get brown.  Any suggestions?

I have looked and looked for a pizza recipe that not only had a great crust, but great sauce as well.  This is it!  And my kids love to make it instead of ordering out.  Woo-hoo!!!

This had to be the best pizza recipe we have tried yet.  I ended up halving the recipe because we only wanted one pizza and it turned out super.  I had to add a little extra flour while kneading, but that was about it.  Super recipe.

We did a family pizza night - it was messy but a lot of fun.  Everyone picked out all of the toppings they wanted and made their own pizza.  They tasted great - at least as good, if not better than, our favorite pizzaria.

Amazing pizza!!
My son and husband both loved this recipe. Best of all my 8 yr. old son did every step himself, I just stayed close by for supervision.
Heloved watching the dough rise and watching it bake in the oven.... and loved it even more after taking the first bite of his own creation.

Recommend it to all, especially moms that love to have their children involved in the kitchen.

Thanks for this great recipe. I will use it over and over again! :)

DOUGH REVIEW ONLY!!

Ok, I hate it when people say,"Well I did this differently..." and then alter it so it barely resembles the original recipe.  I just used the dough recipe, my family LOVED the dough recipe.  I doubled it so I could make four pizzas.  We then used what we had to make pizza ignoring the rest of the recipe.  We did not bake it (forgot all about that), but it was amazing.  I got tons of compliments and this is now my go-to recipe for pizza dough!  THANK YOU!

This pizza was AWESOME!!  I had never made homemade pizza before, and was a little intimidated at the idea, but this recipe had such great reviews that I had to try it.  It turned out so well.  After reading the reviews, I added one additional cup of flour to the dough mixture.  There was just no way that the dough could've been rolled out without that extra flour, in my judgment - way too liquidy.  It was perfect with the extra cup.  The dough was quite thick and not really capable of being rolled out.  I just kind of shaped it into circles (we made 5 individual circles - one for each person), and that worked fine.  The crust was quite thick, but we like it that way.  The sauce was incredible, too.  There was way more sauce than you need, but you can use the extra to dip crusts in if you desire, or just freeze it for next time.  This was a fun, economical, healthier way to have pizza.  Thank you for this great recipe!

Simple recipe. Glad I practiced how to make bread first. My boyfriend loves thick crust and lots of sauce so I added diced tomatoes to the sauce. The only thing about that is you just need to really drain and strain the tomatoes so it's not soupy when you cut into the pizza. Besides omitting some toppings to suit taste, this recipe is so good. Even after wrapping slices up and keeping them in the freezer for a couple of days, it's still good!

This was a really delicious recipe.  I didn't use all the toppings but the crust and the sauce tasted great.  I baked the crust before adding the cheese and sauce and it turned out just right.  Thanks!

Very good although the dough was not easy to work with.  I had to add more flour a little at a time until the dough was workable, and it ended up being probably about 1 to 1 1/2 cups extra.  I also had to poke the dough with a fork about halfway through the first baking time because it was bubbling up, and I brushed the outer crust with olive oil after putting the toppings on.  The sauce was good, I like it much better than the kind made with tomato puree...I added 2 cloves pressed garlic and italian seasoning and basil, omitted the pepper.  All in all, very good!

I LUV LUV LUV this recipe..initially I was skeptical but it turned out wonderfully. I did not split the dough in half.. I used all the dough from the recipe and it came out nice and thick, like a deep dish..you guys should try it this way. You won't regret it!!!

This was just ok.  I used mushrooms instead of bell pepper and added chopped jalapenos.  The sauce was a little bland even though I added oregano and basil.  It needs something more.

This is a crust review only...Great tasting..Not yeasty like some recipes for crust.  I bake first, then topped and baked again just like recipe says to.  I did add an additional cup of flour to the dough before kneading.
I will use this again.

For Pizza Dough Only: my kids wanted pizza for lunch and I didn't have a boxed mix on hand, so I tried this recipe based on the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a tablespoon of dried Italian Seasoning and a tablespoon of Splenda to the dry ingredients...It came out fantastic!! I also did not pre-bake the crust and just cooked it at 450 for about 30 minutes. I will be trying the sauce the next time we plan to make pizza (I didn't have tomato sauce) but if its as good as the crust I will never buy jarred pizza sauce again. This recipe is a keeper and boxed pizza mixes will not be found in my pantry anymore!!

This was the first pizza I've ever made from scratch and I'll probably never buy a DiGiorno again.  It's easy for first-timers and has a great flavor.  I added about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to my sauce- really tasty for those who like a bit of spice.  My pizza sauce was a tiny bit runny, though, so I'm going to try a different brand of tomato sauce next time.

The crust was fantastic! I added a some garlic powder to the mix. For the sauce I sauteed mushrooms in olive oil and butter. Added in 6oz can of organic tomato paste with 6oz water and 1/2 fresh tomato along with the onions the recipe called for. Unfortunately I didn't read the instructions for my pizza brick and forgot to put cornmeal to prevent sticking. I managed to pry the pieces off though.

Hands down the best homemade pizza crust I've ever made, and that includes the times I've done it in the breadmaker. The sauce is simple and tasty. Pre-cooking the crust is also a brilliant idea. Homemade pizza can be a bit time consuming, but this particular recipe is worth it. Thank you!!

This pizza tastes awesome.  I did alter it a little: I used a frozen pepper and onion stir-fry mix instead of the fresh onion and peppers, and baked on a pizza stone at 450 degrees for 10 minutes and didn't pre-bake the crust.  I also used dried chopped onions and a little bit of onion powder in the sauce instead of fresh grated onions, and I halved the recipe (I made both crusts and froze one).  As far as I'm concerned it was perfect.  The pizzas I've baked in the past didn't taste anything like real pizza (they were gross: ).  This tasted as good or better than anything I've got from a restraunt or store.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I had been using the recipe from my kitchen aid book, but wasn't really happy with it.  This dough was super silky and easy to work with.  I didn't prebake the dough, though, I let it rise, then shaped it and let it sit again for a little while and added toppings and baked.  turned out great!

my first ever pizza from scratch and i LOVE it! i thought it was great, easy, and the crust was perfect for dipping in some seasoned olive oil. also, i had some space on top of the pie after putting the cheese on, and i'm a firm believer in a pizza dripping with cheese. so the second time i made it i went ahead and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top to fill in the gaps. i think it helped the taste a lot!

Very good pizza! This was my first attempt at making a completely homemade pizza and it turned out perfectly:) Much better than Pizza Hut and so easy. The only thing I changed-I didn't have an onion, so I used onion powder, and I added a little sugar, garlic salt to the sauce. I also did not bake the crust before, as I like it a little soft. Thank you for such an easy recipe!

I made exactly as recipe says.  Mainly talking about the crust!  It was terrible and hard with no flavor.  I have made pizza many times and never had such horrid crust and I figured out the problem.  All other recipes of crust usually have you letting it rise for at least an hour.  Also, almost all recipes I've ever seen has either tiny bit of honey or sugar in it.  It's 1/2 to 1 tsp. and I think it helps the consistency or texture.  I won't use this one again and stick to my tried and true on Foodnetwork.com.

Beautiful recipe for a homemade pizza! The sauce is great, the crust is hand tossed style and perfect, and the toppings just set it all off. If you add a can of drained diced tomatoes to the sauce recipe on here then you have an excellent marinara sauce! Goes great with Paula's Bread stick recipe on this site. Definitely will make again, thank you!

This pizza was delicious!  My only suggestion would be to bake it less time without the toppings and a little more time with the toppings.  A really great dough.

I have 3 teenage boys and they all loved this pizza and asked me to make it again!  You can change up the toppings as well, we used what was on hand, hamburger, onions, red pepper, broccoli and cheese.  Will get the ingredients the recipe calls for to make next week.  Will be a weekly meal in our house for sure, oh ya and the crust is excellent!

I make pizza for dinner once a week, but I always forget how much of each ingredient to add. I decided to use this recipe because it looked easy to memorize - 1,2,3,4 - 1x yeast packet, 2x cup water, 3x tbsp. oil, 4x cup flour (and then some salt...)! The dough was too sticky - I ended up needing to add 1 1/2 to 2 more cups of flour until it was sticky, but manageable. The end result was that it tasted good... I used only the crust recipe - I topped the pizza with Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe from this website. I made one plain pizza with just sauce and cheese and one veggi pizza topped that with spinach, sliced onions and olives. I baked at 475 - for 15 minutes and then topped it with shredded mozzerella cheese and put it back into the oven until the cheese was melted and bubbly. This ensured a crunchy-crisp crust with cheese that is not burnt. The end result was very good!

The sauce is great, I found that it made a lot more than I needed so I'm only going to make 1/2 the sauce next time. I used the pizza dough I from this site instead.  The topping section is a good combination.

The dough was very heavy and tasteless.

Great dough that's easy to work with.  I added more seasonings to the dough to suit our taste.  I made pizza and pepperoni rolls.  thanks

This is a great recipe! I tried my own vegetarian toppings, but the dough was perfect!

Very good.  The dough was rather wet, but that's easily addressed with more flour.  I didn't prebake the crust but wish I had--I get better crust if I do.  The dough was decent but nothing special.  At any rate, I didn't change this too much--had spaghetti sauce to use up but added the flavoring anyway.  We don't like onions plain so I left those off the pizza and I only had 1 bell pepper (red), so that's what I used.  I also didn't have canadian bacon so I left that off as well.  I debated on making both pizzas (it's only the two of us) v.  making one and freezing half the dough, but bf suggested that I make both since we're snowed in this weekend.  So I made a round pizza and a rectangle pizza.  We'll definitely have enough pizza to keep us satisfied during this snow!  Thanks for the recipe!

This made for a great pizza crust. I used olive oil and whole wheat flour in place of the vegetable oil and all-purpose flour. I also baked the pizza on a cookie sheet and we added our own toppings (spinach, tomato, mushrooms and fresh mozzarella). Great crust recipe. Thanks!

We followed the recipe for the pizza crust but were unable to find standard yeast, only fast action yeast....Being unfamiliar with yeast all together, i wasn't sure the recipe would work.
However, i was extremely impressed with the outcome.
It actually is like pizza base from a shop.
Lovely. Probably the best pizza crust in the world.

My first time making a pizza from scratch, and it turned out really well! I cooked up some italian sausage (instead of canadian bacon) and added that to the pizza along with all the other ingredients listed. I also added fresh mushrooms. I cooked the crust first and it turned out great! My bf loved the crust. Next time we will add a little more seasoning to the sauce, and try it with canadian bacon and pineapple. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good. I used different crust. I omitted the bacon, olives, green pepper (didnt have on hand), and used green fresh spinach instead of basil. Next time want to make this crust.

The toppings were great but I had a hard time making the crust-too sticky and I added too much flour. Next time I will just use store bought crust.

The recipe is great. My pizza came out bad because I have no experience using yeast or flour whatsoever, the pizza actually tasted great but the dough was really hard. Again, this was my fault, not the recipe's.

Perfect Homemade pizza and for someone who has never made pizza at home before! Its way better than delivery and its fun for the whole family! The crust was yummy- I followed the directions exactly and it turned out really good. I added more spices to my sauce (garlic, italian seasoning, crushed red pepper etc.) I used tomato sauce that was already flavored with basil and it was excellent. Baked on a square cookie sheet with edges..you don't need a pizza stone! Enjoy!

Good pizza. The sauce is a little salty, and I don't like that I had to pull out the mixer to make the dough.

We only used the crust part of the recipe and it was super sticky! We had to thicken it up with Bisquick cuz we ran out of flour!  It did, however, turn out delicious!
