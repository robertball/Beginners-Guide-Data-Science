I have a recipe for tapenade which I've been using for years but decided to try this one. It is not bad but it's got way too much vinegar.  Among other things, my recipe calls for just the olive oil and some anchovy filets to give it a certain "umph" lacking in this recipe.

Outstanding!  I opted not to use the food processor as I cut the recipe in half and didn't want to pull it out for that small amount.  I think I'd do this by hand again as it was really easy to put this together.  Forgot the red pepper, but next time I'll be sure to add.  This is similar to one I make with rosemary.  Wonderful flavor - thank you for posting this recipe!

I made this receipe for a large group and it was definitely a hit!  I have been buying my olive tapenade from a restaurant and this was just as good if not better.  I did leave out the red pepper since I did not have any on hand and it was perfect.

The best tapenade recipe I've ever had. It is always a hit. I do not include the red pepper and usually use a mix of kalamata and green olives. I also add a little more olive oil once I spoon it into the serving dish. Great with thin crackers.

Great! I used 1 can of black olives and one can of burgundy black olives. It makes a nice big batch so we were able to have it with french bread yesterday, I stuffed pork tenderloins with it tonight - and still have a little left. Thanks!

Awesome! I used half black/ half green olives. It was the perfect flavor I was looking for. As good as the jarred kind in the supermarket.

Not a bad appetizer, but since you'll likely have to go to the grocery store for some of the ingredients anyway I'm not sure that it's worth the time and energy rather than just picking up a container of pre-made tapenade.

Excellent party dip with toasted baguette rounds.  I used kalamata olives instead of black, and added a few greens ones too.  The only change I would make next time would be to cut back a bit on the capers to reduce the saltiness.

I thought this was fantastic! I omitted the capers (didn't have any) but I don't think they were missed, really. I will make this again, thanks for the great recipe.

This is really pretty good tapenade. But I have to say, with the olives, capers and parmesan cheese in this recipe, I did not and would not add any extra salt. There is plenty of sodium in this dish already, so I'd suggest skipping adding the extra salt called for in the ingredients list.
Also, and this is purely a personal choice, I can't stand kalamata olives. Way too salty and strong flavored for me. I used regular, pitted black olives and this dish was quite fresh and inviting.

I love different types of tapenade but never tried olive tapenade.  I had spanish olives to use up (not that I dislike black olives, I think they are equally good) and other ingredients on hand.  This spread went well with my veggie sandwich w/ feta cheese...yum!

This tapenade is excellent.  My first attempt at making it myself and everyone loved it.  I chose to omit the onion and red pepper to keep it simple.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Really tasty as is, even better with a few minor tweaks. 
1) Suggest substituting red onion for white, for a bit tangier flavor. 
2) Dried parsley substituted for fresh (1 tsp dried for 1 tbsp), and it worked very well, couldn't notice a difference and much cheaper.  
3) Also added some kalamata olives to the mix, which upped the flavor.  Finally, make at least one day before and let the flavors blend in the fridge -- really takes it over the top!

My talapia recipe called for 1/4 cup tapenade. I couldn't find any in the grocery store and found this recipe. I had a small can of sliced olives and thought that would be enough, but it was only for 1/6 of the recipe, which was two servings. After adjusting all the ingredients, it turned out to be almost 1/2 cup, so we ended up with some to put on crackers for an appetizer. It was really good, and I plan to make it again.

Delicious! Can't wait to have the pork loin tomorrow with the tapenade in it.  The only thing I did differently is left out the salt, and used half black olives and half kalmata olives.

I'm 67 years old and had never even heard of tapenade, but this looked intriguing so I gave it a shot. Wow! I'm not even going to bother looking at any other recipes because I can't imagine there's anything out there that's better than this, especially with red onion. Yum! I can't stop eating it! It's so good on olive oil/black pepper Triscuits.

Since a had a left over deli assortment of several different kinds of olives, that’s what I used. Some with pimentos, black olives, etc. really made it more colorful and a mix of flavors.

This was a hit at a vegetarian baby shower I attended! I used a mix of Kalamata, green and black olives. Following other reviewers' suggestion, I omitted the 1/2 tsp salt. The olives and capers added enough, and the salt listed would've been too much.

Well this is delicious. Better the next day after resting in the fridge overnight. The onion I think may be a little to much for me, so I will make again using maybe half the amount. Thanks for the great recipe. This was the first time I have ever made a Tapenade, glad I choose this one.

I really liked this recipe; put it all in the food processor, so it was quick and easy, as well as tasty.
