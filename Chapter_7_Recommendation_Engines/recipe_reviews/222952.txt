wonderful...bursting with flavor.  DH needed to have it "thinned" out more though.  Kind of thick but otherwise...perfect.  Had to add more.  I just did this with chicken breasts tonight and it was even more wonderful.

I tried this recipe, it was delicious! My husband raved about it and he doesnt like shrimp too much. I served the shrimp over vermicelli noodles and it was spicy. If you dont want it too spicy, only do half of the can of peppers and keep the cream cheese and milk as is.

The. Best. Spicy. Sauce. Ever.  If you like spicy, you will love this.  Like others suggested, I added fresh, pressed garlic and many veggies in different variations.  All work well.   Over noodles or over rice, with chicken or with shrimp...delicious!

My fiancé and I loved this dish!!  It was super quick and easy to make!  We love spicy, so it was perfect for us!!  The recipe is great as is. I wanted to sneak in some vegies, so I used 2 pounds of shrimp and 1 pound of steamed broccoli. Next time I think we may add in a can of drained, diced tomatoes or chopped fresh tomatoes just to see....  Thank you for sharing!!  Yum!

Made this before as a dip and everyone loved it. Made it tonight as a meal and my husband’s reaction was “Wow! This is good!!” I did add a bit of onion and garlic to the pepper/cream cheese mixture, also used coconut milk instead of regular milk.

I thought this was absolutely wonderful.  I added a bit of parmesean and green onion for presentation and served over white rice.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again!!!

Delicious!  We like things spicy, but since I only had 1/3 can chipotles in adobo sauce, that's what I used.  I'm glad I did!  It was still plenty spicy.  I sauteed garlic, sliced onions and sliced mushrooms in a little coconut oil before adding & simmering the sauce.  After adding the shrimp, and cooking it, I stirred in cooked penne pasta, and tossed to coat it.  We'll definitely be making this again, and as another reviewer suggested, try it with chicken.

I knew  it would be hot,  so I started out using  one ounce of the  pureed chili and adobo.   Still too hot,  and  I like hot.   Ended up  throwing it out.  Good thing I didn't  put  the shrimp  in,  saved them.

Very good but spicy (almost went to 4 stars for being too spicy.  My wife loved it & we will certainly make it again.  I halved the recipe for two servings & used 1 lb shrimp.  I cut the heat by using 2 oz (1/4 can) of the chipotle adobo sauce & it was still plenty spicy.   Also added a small clove of garlic, minced.   Recipe said 3# shrimp for 4 servings... 2 lbs would be plenty for 4, especially if shrimp are peeled & deveined.   Will try this sauce recipe with chicken as many suggested.

Wow, super simple but looks fancy.  We like spicy but I still reduced the chipotle with adobe,.  Probably about 5 oz. Used a stick blender. I used half and half and used one full cup, Next time I'll use milk to make it a little thinner.  Served over angel hair pasta.
A saver.  Never tell anyone how easy it is.

Great recipe ! My only complaint was the sauce was a little on the thick side but the taste was superb ! I plan to use one cup of milk instead of half a cup next time

this recipe as writen is very SPICY . I needed to triple the recipe to feed a large group. To do that the recipe called for THREE cans of peppers. One can was.plenty SPICY.  Other reviewers said they added garlic and vegetables and I agree. Might I also suggest using a little less cream cheese. Everyone liked how it turned out.

I followed other reviews and used about 2/3 of the can of peppers.  I added garlic and about 2/3 cup of milk.  My kids 11 and 13 loved it!   And wasn't too hot.

I made it with half a can of chipotle peppers and it turned out very delicious and still pretty spicy. The best part of this recipe is the creaminess of the sauce and how easy it is to make. I served it over pasta and loved it.

Okay, seriously, too spicy.  I knew the chipotles in Adobe sauce would be hot, but I felt with addition of cream cheese and milk, the heat level would be lowered.  Wrong.  The flavor is good, but even with extra cup of milk and 1/2 sour cream, it was just tolerable.  Next time I will use 1/3 can of the chilies.

Excellent!!  So simple, but delicious.  I may throw some garlic into the equation next time.  And there will most definitely be a next time.
