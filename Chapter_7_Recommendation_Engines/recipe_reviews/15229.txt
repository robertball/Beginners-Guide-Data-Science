This is an easy way to cook thighs.  It is the kind of recipe you can adjust easily to your own taste, so I like it.  I'm going to say what I did to put out a few more ideas to people who might try this recipe.

I used 2 1/2 cups water, brown rice, 2 cloves minced garlic, olive oil instead of butter since I didn't have much butter around, and I skipped the step with bouillion and 1 tbsp. water.  

The extra water is for the brown rice, which needs more water  I ended up with a little extra liquid, but it was absorbed when my food cooled off.  Next time I will use 2 1/4 cups water.  I parboiled the rice for 20 minutes with the bouilion, water, onion, oil, and 2 cloves minced garlic so I wouldn't have to bake it longer, as brown rice takes two to three times longer to cook than white rice.

I removed the skins to cut the fat content and shook lemon pepper on top of the thighs before baking.  I also added some sliced chile peppers and fresh parsley before baking because I like heat.  If you add fresh parsley, you will get more taste if you add it toward the end of baking, which I forgot to do.

I ended up baking it 45 minutes to make sure the rice cooked through.  You won't need to cook it as long if you use small thighs and white rice, though.

I gave it a four after doing a few things other reviewers posted.  I heated the butter, buillion, water, onion, and minced garlic just until butter melts, then poured this over the rice.  I didn't have italian seasonings so I used seasoned salt and rubbed into chicken thighs (skin off).  Once the chicken & rice was completed I added a handful of shredded cheese onto the rice.  Turned out great!

I took advantage of some previous suggestions and used skinless thighes, only ONE bouillon cube, cut back on the butter and increased the cooking time to 55 minutes.  Then I added 1/2 cup white wine (since some reviews indicated more liquid AND more flavor is needed), black pepper, 2 cloves crushed garlic and a nice amount of fresh parsley.  With these modifications, I give this recipe a 4 and a half.  I like that the rice goes in the mix too -- it's one less pot to clean! I used Carolina white rice since the cooking time is a bit longer than some other white rice brands.

5 stars with these changes... Here are some Cooking 101 tips. Heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a dutch oven over medium high heat. Season chicken (thighs OR drumsticks) with S&P and brown for 4-5 minutes per side. Remove from pot. Saute the onion (and celery, carrots, mushrooms) for 2-3 minutes in the same pot. Then add rice, broth, melted butter, and Italian seasoning (only 1/2 tsp.) and stir together. Put browned chicken on top of rice and cover with a tight fitting lid. Bake for 35-45 minutes. Cooks perfectly every time!

great recipe. I mixed in a can of cream of mushrooms, sliced carrots, sliced celery,minced garlic cloves, substituted about 1/3 cup of barley for 1/3 cup of rice. and preseasoned the rice mixture. Topped with 8 bone in thighs rubbed in season baked covered at 350 for 1 hour then kicked temp to 475 for 30 min then pulled out and topped with shredded cheddar tossed back into oven for 5 minutes. turned out a little greasy but I left my chix skins on ( Best part )  Yum

This was a defintie '5' fpr my husband and I liked it ok too. I used skinless thighs, added garlic and cut up fresh mushrooms. I did have to cook for an extra 20 mins, but it came out perfect. Next time I will use less margarine, I would also add some peas or corn for a little extra vegetable. My husband asked if I wanted leftovers for my lunch because he wanted to eat it all, plus he kept going, "this one's a keeper"
Very easy.

I read through many of the reviews and decided to make this last night with a few modifications.  Instead of butter, I used olive oil, and I added a half cup more water.  I also chopped a clove of garlic with the chopped onion.  I didn't use bouillon cubes and instead used chicken broth, and I threw in some frozen vegetables (peas and carrots) with the rice, and a few cherry tomatoes from the garden.  I added some garlic powder to the spices as well.  To ensure everything cooked evenly, I stirred the rice a couple times during cooking and turned the chicken over as well.    This was really easy to make and the whole thing was ready in about an hour (prep and cooking), so it was a great meal to make after a long day at work.  My boyfriend raved about it and had seconds, and continued raving about it long after we'd finished eating.  It's definitely something I'll make again.

We enjoyed this recipe.  Think of it as a base to which you can personalize for your family.  I added carrots, mushrooms, garlic, Mrs. Dash, and exra Italian seasoning.  I halved the onion amount, and didn't add the butter, but added a splash of olive oil.  Next time, I don't think I will add any fat, the thighs don't need it.  I also covered it.  This it not fancy, but an easy dinner that you can throw together and stick in the oven 1-1.5 hours before dinner.  Definatly a keeper!

This was very easy to prepare. I added some hot pepper sauce to the rice mixture as well as a blend of spices, I reduced the butter by half. I removed the skin from the chicken and added some cajun seasoning, garlic salt and cayenne pepper. 
Lots of possibilities!

This was so easy and so good.  Don't leave out the onions.  We should have baked this for 60 minutes.  We took the skin off the chicken.  I think this would be to greasy leaving it on.  Added some garlic powder and used greek seasoning.  You could really add any veg. you wanted to this.

This was a great and easy supper.  I sauteed the onion and 1/2 lb of chopped mushrooms in 2 tbs. of butter.  (I did not use the Italian seasoning) When they were soft I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup chicken broth and poured it over 1 cup of uncooked rice. I cut 4 boneless, skinless thighs in half and seasoned them with Goya adobo (it's a salt, pepper and garlic seasoning) placed them on top of the rice mixture.  The only problem was the rice on top did not cook.  I removed the chicken after 45 minutes, added another 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the rice, mixed it well and baked it for another 15 minutes.  It was delicious and the chicken was very tender. I'll definitely make this version again.

This is a great one dish meal.  I love the orginla recipe, but I've tried some variations, too.  I doubled the rice to 2 cups and used long grain/wild rice.  I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of doubling the water and decreased the water to 1 1/2 cups.  Works just as well with chicken breast, too!  Delicious!!

This is probably a decent recipe.  Just don't do what I did.  I didn't have thighs so I used drumsticks - not right for this dish.  I used asian sticky rice which is a no no - takes way too long to cook and comes out too gooey.  I still gave it a 4 star because it does have good flavor and very quick to make.

This is a simple starter recipe that you can customize easily!  I used brown rice, olive oil instead of the white rice and butter, added a cup and a half of sliced mushrooms, and added a tsp of curry powder, smoked paprika and onion powder.  The brown rice takes longer... give it about 1.5 hours.  At an hour, we turned the chicken to make sure it didn't dry out, and that really ensured a juicy chicken.  Fall apart tender!  I'll be making this again for sure.

I used turkey thighs and legs for this recipe as I already had them thawed out. Plus I revised the recipe by adding 3 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic, some Creole seasoning along with the Italian seasoning and a can of corn, drained. Absolutely wonderful per my family. Will definitely make this many times.

Very greasy and fatty.  If the butter in the rice was eliminated, the fat from the chicken thighs would have been enough.  Cooking time was right.  I sprinkled some dried oregano over top just for some extra flavor and looks.

This was a great dish. I did what one of the other reviewers did - subbed out some barley for part of the rice, added garlic, peas, mushroom soup, and topped with a little cheese for the final minutes of cooking. I've made it twice and it came out great both times. Yummy!

I wasn't sure about trying this, the reviews are all so mixed it made me nervous. However, I'm always on the look out for dairy free recipes since dairy makes my husband sick. I made a few changes based on the reviews I read. I started by seasoning the chicken with some Lawry's seasoned salt and then browning them in a skillet with a bit of margarine, setting them aside when golden brown. Before making the rice mix I sautéed the onions in the same skillet and added 6 cloves minced garlic and about 1 ½ cups of chopped fresh portobello mushrooms. I added 1 TBS of original flavor Mrs. Dash to the rice mix and sprinkled some dried parsley over the chicken after it was all put together. I cooked it uncovered and after 45 minutes the chicken was cooked perfectly. The rice cooked, but didn't seem to cook evenly. It was a bit overcooked and mushy in places. That might've been because I doubled the recipe and used a bigger baking dish. Anyway, it got mixed reviews from my family when I served it last night. One of my kids loved the chicken but hated the rice, my husband thought it was all just okay, my 3 other kids liked it but didn't love it, and I didn't care for the chicken but I really liked the flavor of the rice. I think I will try this again, maybe tweak it a bit more. I think I will add more Mrs. Dash, 2 or even 3 TBS instead of just one, and maybe some other spices. I thought the rice was good but would be even better with more spice.

Very good - I liberally sprinkled Italian seasoning on each thigh (didn't measure) and I used large thighs so I cooked it for 45 minutes covered then about 20 minutes uncovered. Next time I will brown the chicken thighs in butter first, place on top of rice, and bake covered.

This was an awesome dish!!!  I did make a couple of changes though: I added one more boullion cube, about 1/4 cup more water and took another reviewers advice and added some garlic and onion salt.  It turned out really good!!!

For the most part, my family enjoyed this, especially the thighs. I actually seasoned them with poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. (Seems like a lot, but it was not overpowering and provided really good flavor.) My gripe was with the cooking time and the rice. Like almost everyone else here, I found that 45 minutes was not sufficient to cook the chicken. And even after the chicken was done, the rice was still hard! I would DEFINITELY suggest covering this with foil while it cooks; my rice absorbed NONE of the water. But as another reviewer stated, this is a good "starting point".

Wonderful!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked with parboiled brown rice.  Sprinkled lots of lemon pepper and parsley on top before putting in the oven.  Hubby was the first to try it and raved over how good it tasted.  When I finally got around to eating dinner, I was very pleased with how it turned out.  Even my niece and her new boyfriend, who were visiting, complimented me on this dish!

This recipe was great and easy to make!  I added more seasonings such as the original Mrs. Dash, garlic powder, salt and pepper to my family's taste.  Even my picky son ate everything on his plate!  Thanks so much for giving us this recipe!  We'll have this dish often!

This was very good but I admit I changed it up quite a bit. I used thyme instead of italian seasoning, olive oil instead of butter, chicken stock instead of bouillon, and brown rice instead of white, and added peas and carrots to the rice.  I also used two cups of rice to five cups of half stock half water (brown rice calls for more water). It took quite a while to cook, about 1.5 hours. and I parboiled the rice first. As suggested by another reviewer, I turned the chicken over halfway through to keep it from drying out. At the very end, I put it under the broiler for 5-6 minutes to crisp up the skin. There was still water when I took it out, but it quickly soaked into the rice after I took it out. The end result was delicious, and the rice had an almost risotto-like texture. My only complaint is that it was pretty greasy. I would definitely not used a 1/4 cup of butter as is suggested. Next time I'd like to try skinless thighs to help keep the grease-factor down. Overall, I think I have a new one-pot dish to add to the rotation!

Good flavor, next time I will cook uncovered at first and then cover for the remainder.  Also, needed to cook longer than called for.

Before cooking the chicken with the rice, I half-baked the thighs first so I can drain the grease.  I added sauteed onions, mushrooms and peas to the rice.  It turned out delicious and it was very easy.

I tweaked this recipe by adding onion, carrots and celery that I had sweated in olive oil, but it still didn't have much flavor.  It also took a lot longer to cook than the recipe states.

I cut the recipe down for 1. Though, after the chicken and rice were finished cooking I did mix the rice in with some plain rice because it was rather greasy and needed to be mellowed some. Perhaps i ought to have used defrosted chicken and not used the rock hard ice chicken because then I could have taken off the skin and fat. But I think as a recipe goes, this was fine. Worth 5 stars because if you use chicken without all that fat on it, it'll be awesome!

I had been wanting to try this recipe for some time and had some thighs I needed to do something with.  I took the butter, water, lemon peppper seasoning, boullion and onion and heated it up on the stove, poured it over the rice, sprinkled the chicken with lemon pepper seasoning and baked at 350 for one hour.  It was perfect!

I always double the rice and use 2 packs of Italian seasoning (for salads) - one in the rice, the other on the thighs.  My family LOVES it!

This was super and easy and soooo good! 
I did cook it a little different. 
I followed the directions given as far as ingriedients. but i mixed everything with the rice (both cubes, water, butter, seasoning). i took the skin off & seasoned my chicken & then browned over the stove. Then i added rice combo in pan added a little more season and then i placed the chicken in and baked on 390 for 40 minutes. CAME OUT DELICIOUS !

My family loved this recipe! I cooked onion and celery in the oil on the stovetop, and added a little garlic salt. Then mixed this in with 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup water plus the other ingredients, and skinned the thighs. I also added petit carrots. Baked at 350 covered for 35 min, then uncovered it, stirred, added cheese, and baked uncovered for another 20-25 min until the rice was done. I have a 3-1/2 and 1-1/2 year old. We all loved it! Will make again.

This is a nice, hot, comforty type meal that can be approved upon to make even better with just a little tweaking. First, caramelize your onion before adding. Otherwise it's just way too onion-y. Second, before serving top with cheese and put under the broiler for a minute. Actually, I added cheese at the end, let it melt, stirred it into the rice, then topped with a little more cheese. We like spicy, so I added a half teaspoon of red chili flakes to the rice/water, and sprinkled a little more on top. 

Cook a little longer than stated time. I cooked in a covered glass casserole dish and after removing it from the oven, it stayed hot for an hour, and the rice got softer and fluffier.

I used this as a base tonight, and it worked out really well.  I ended up adding chopped garlic along with the onion, and I also added rings of red pepper on top of the rice for the chicken to lay on.  I didn't have thighs, but did end up using bone-in breasts and the 40 minute mark was PERFECT.  Thanks for this recipe, I'll definitely be using it again!

This was delicious. My boyfriend thought so too. I followed the recipe but added the following: instead of 2 cups of water I put one can of golden mushroom soup into a 2-cup measuring cup. Added 1/4 cup water and filled the remaining part of the measuring cup with heavy cream. Instead of using Italian Seasoning, I seasoned both sides of the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and sprinkled both sides with Italian bread crumbs. It was delicious. The rice had a wonderful flavor even by itself.

This is not bad as written. It could use a few more spices, and the rice was a little greasy from the chicken, so I am not sure the addition of butter is necessary. But, this was an easy recipe using ingredients I already had on hand, so am satisfied. Thanks.

Cooked according to the recipe......almost.  Used chicken granules instead of bouillon cubes and was happy with the results.  This week I'm taking a bigger batch to a relative's home but will add mushrooms and carrots.  This is a great "make ahead dish" and I never have enough of those.

I had taken chicken thighs out to cook tonight.  My husband seen them and asked me to cook the chicken and rice dish that I cooked a few weeks ago.  He is not one to request I cook something.  He commented that the rice was very good and he liked it better than the ones with cream of something soup. I will be keeping this one.

This was really good, however, I did do things a little differently as did the other reviewers.  First I used instant brown rice and I cooked it in my Rice Cooker Plus (pampered chef) according to pack directions.  In the meantime I chopped up a very little bit of onion and pressed about 3-4 small garlic cloves and mixed in one can of chicken broth and 1/4 cup butter.  Then I spread the rice in the bottom of a 9x13 and mixed in the broth mixture.  I placed about 8 small boneless/skinless chicken thighs on top and seasoned them with poultry seasoning, Italian seasoning, parsley flakes, and celery salt (yum!) Then I baked for 1 hour at 350.  I poured a jar of chicken gravy over the top during the last 15 minutes and I just couldn't stop eating it!  Also my very picky 4 year old ate all his so I know it's a winner!

My husband loves chicken thighs too, however, I made a few mods: (1) used quarter pieces, (2) added 1/2 t. garlic, (3) covered and cooked the dish for an hour and until done, and (4) liberally sprinkled italian seasoning on it.  What I SHOULD've done--but didn't--was take the skins off the pieces.  All other mods made the dish very good.

My husband, step son and I really loved this recipe! Of course, due to not having the bullion,I omitted it and no onion so used garlic instead. 

It will be a weekly meal for us from now on and it was SO easy to make! Thank you soooo much! I did use the amount of butter stated and don't think it would taste as good reducing it as others have done, just my opinion.

Gotta run, having it for lunch, YUMMMMMY!

This was a very easy and tasty meal. I actually made it at the last minute. I didn't have any uncooked white rice so I used instatnt rice instead and it turned out just great. Even my husband enjoyed it and he is not a big fan of any chicken recipes!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I made several changes, starting with using boneless skinless thighs.  Used chicken stock instead of bouillon and water, left out the onion and seasonings.  Used about 1 tsp. Mrs. Dash, a little garlic powder, and s&p.  Covered with foil for first 45 minutes, then uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.  This way, it was very good.  I think there were some fundamental problems with the original recipe, so play with it a little to suit your own tastes and expectations.

Very easy and very tasty.  For those of you who thought this was too bland, add some white wine (to your taste) and some poultry seasoning.  My family enjoyed this dish.

Awesome!  Whole family loved it(only complaint was from the kids about the onions).  I added sauteed mushrooms, green onions, and minced garlic to the rice mixture.  To season the chicken, I used poultry seasoning.  Will definitely make again.  I agree about adding a bit more liquid...may try adding a little white wine next time.

This is good for those who don't like overpowering, spicy flavors. If you add the right boullion (I use Knorr brand) and lots of garlic, the dish has a nice taste. I didn't think it was bland. Mine had a rich chicken-onion flavor.

used bouillon powder instead of cube (negligible change)...skipped butter but will increase water by ¼c. nxt time...added salt and used original blend Mrs Dash instead of ital. seasoning...used 3 thighs instead due to smaller baking dish...baked covered for one hr. instead of 45min due to smaller baking dish...enjoyable meal, may add peas to rice nxt time rather than cook separate side of veg...thank you for posting this recipe!

Made this tonight, following the recipe but making some changes per reviews and preferences. Instead of white rice, I used a box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice original recipe. I used 1 cup chicken stock (what I had) and 1 cup water, about 2 Tbsp butter and added some dried minced onion and garlic powder. For the chicken I used 2 skin on, boned thighs and 3 (smaller) boneless, skinless thighs. Added the Italian seasoning and fresh ground pepper.  Covered for first 30 minutes and then uncovered for about another 30 minutes. Took the chicken out (reached 165 degrees) and placed rice back in while I heated a sweet corn in the microwave. Rice was done, delicious but had a lot of extra liquid (contrary to others' complaints!) Winner for my family! Yum!

The water to rice ratio was spot on and the rice came out perfect. I have cooked dishes like these before and either the rice wasn't done enough or it was over done. 
I mostly look at recipes to get ideas and for cooking times and temps so for this one, I did lightly brown the chicken thighs on each side for a couple of minutes in olive oil and salt and pepper. 
To my rice/liquid mixture, I added some crush garlic and sprinkled some dried parsley (mainly to add a little color) and a little greek seasoning. After I poured the mixture into the dish I put some carrots on one side (hubby and son do not like them but sister and I do!). 
After putting chicken thighs (boneless/skinless) onto of rice, I sprinkled some Lawry's season salt over the chicken. 
I baked for 49 minutes and everything was perfect and delicious. My husband does not usually like "one-dish meals" and neither one of us are big on chicken but this was really really good. 
I will definitely make this again, everyone enjoyed it. :-)

Very good and simple. The previous reviews helped me doctor things up.  I used boneless thighs and legs, cut into large chunks and pre- cooked on the stove, adding small amount of hot sauce and a variety of dry spices to the chicken. For the liquid I used one bullion and chicken broth in place of the water.  I also added chopped frozen broccoli (pre steamed) and garlic to the rice mixture and ended-up cooking for an additional 15 mins. (Total of 1 hr. Cooking time). It's a keeper.

Super easy, and tasty!  I had no onions (very unlike me!), so I used lots of garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Also, I used a blend of quinoa, brown rice, and wild rice. I pre-cooked the rice blend covered in the oven for 12-15 minutes, while defrosting my boneless, skinless thighs, and then stirred the rice mixture, and added thighs on top, S&P, and resumed cooking, covered, for 35-40 minutes. By then, the chicken and the rice blend were cooked through.  I removed from oven, added a splash of milk, and a sprinkle of Parmesan and mozzarella. Delish!  Can't wait to try it again with my beloved onions!

Nice easy recipe, but it could use a little more oomph. I think next time I'll try a spice rub on the chicken, and maybe add a few cloves of minced garlic, diced tomatoes or something to the rice mix.

I made this for dinner last night and we thought it was very good. I made a couple with the skin off for me and a couple with the skin on for him. I took Cassie's advice and cooked mine using her suggestions. I only added mushrooms though. I used 14oz of chicken broth and the rest white wine to make two cups. On the advice of another, I also stirred it after a while. I actually suck at making rice and this turned out beautifully! Thank you Carol and Cassie.

I followed the directions but added chopped celery. Flavour was good but far too greasy.  I would not put the butter in next time.  I think the grease from the chicken will give enough grease in it. It also needed more time to cook than the recipe says.

As another reviewer stated, this is a good base recipe and it can be made into many variations as desired.  For a quick meal, I added frozen diced mixed vegetables, sautéed fresh mushrooms, dry white wine, can of cream of chicken to give it a creamy texture and my own chicken stock which I make ahead and keep in the freezer.  Added parsley, thyme & basil. It made a hearty meal and was so easy to prepare.  Family really liked it.

I cut out the butter and got fluffy rice. Even with white meat chicken, the rice doesn't get too dry. 
I used: 
1c Jasmine Rice (rinsed)
2c Water
3 tsp Orrington Farms Chicken Broth Base
1 tsp Curry Powder
1 tsp Turmeric 
1 Lb dark or white meat chicken -boneless 
1c Broccoli or Mixed Veg (we used frozen but I imagine you can use fresh)

I loved this for several reasons...ease of preparation once in the oven you can relax or prepare your sides.It's versatile you can lower the salt and fat.You can make the chicken with different flavors and spices.My husband loves casseroles and I love this one because it's not the mushroom soup type loaded with salt and msg.

This was really good, nothing super spectacular but I would make it again as it was tasty and my family liked it.  I used chicken broth instead of buillion, used skinless thighs, added spices to our liking and I cut out the butter!

Easy, good, yes I will make again. I did add a can of mushroom soup. Otherwise made as directed. We liked it. Only 4 stars because as it is good it's not great but will work for quick easy recipe during the week.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Didnt have shredded cheese so we added a bit of parmesan Inc it was on the plate.  MUST COVER!!! ! It would not enough up the same! Flavor chicken a little more than usual since the water will wash it away or season once in the pan. Added a bit of white wine too. Entire pan is gone! Kids absolutely loved it!!

Very good chicken recipe. Did as another reviewer did and cooked it on the BBQ wrapped in foil, to hot to cook inside. I used chicken broth in place of the water(personal preference )and i used very low sodium soy sauce. I also took them out of the liquid and put them on the grill just to get grill marks. The chicken turns out nice and juicy.This is a keeper, thank you moaa for this wonderful recipe...

I've used this recipe several times now.  I like it and my wife likes it also which is surprising because she normally will not eat rice.  The first time I tried it, I had to increase the cooking time from 45 minutes to an hour to get the chicken cooked.  I think it is because of our altitude of 5000 feet above sea level.  For seasoning I add a chopped/minced up a clove of garlic to the mix and than sprinkle a teaspoon of pepper, a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of smoked perika on top with 6 sprigs of fresh rosemary right before I put it in the oven.  I also skin the thighs like some others do.  I melted the butter prior to mixing it in.
The rice comes out very tasty and the chicken is moist and tasty.

Great base recipe. Used 4 skin on chicken thighs, and 2 cups of rice in a 9x13. Mixed chopped garlic, onion, can of cream of chicken, 1 cup of chicken stock, and Mrs. Dash. Before pouring it over the rice and chicken I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika, and some Goya Adobo. Covered it and threw it in the oven for 45 mins. Came out great! Will definitely make again, but experiment with different veggies, and/or seasonings.

I like this recipe but it needs more seasoning. I've made it twice so far and finally figured out the right ratios. If you use white rice, reduce the amount of liquid by the amount of butter you use. White rice needs 2:1 ratio and that extra 1/4 c butter makes a difference in absorption. For brown rice, use 2 1/4 c stock. I prepared mine by sautéing the onions and a small can of mushrooms until translucent, about 3 minutes, then added the rice, garlic powder, salt and my favorite poultry seasoning. Added the rice and cooked it all another minute or two. I then added 1 3/4 c chicken stock, stirred it all together and tasted. Adjust your seasoning here by adding more salt, garlic powder or other seasoning of your choice. Pour everything into your casserole dish, add the chicken on top, season the top of the chicken and bake 45 min. Uncovered. If necessary, cover and cook another 10-15 minutes. You'll only need to do this if you added too much liquid or if the chicken isn't cooked through.

This recipe is a keeper and sooo easy to make! Next time, I may add some thawed frozen veggies, or perhaps corn, or peas, or.. well, the best thing about this recipe is it's so easy to change up. Hmmm, maybe curry, or saffron, or curry and saffron. The possibilities are endless.

Quick and easy!!  I seasoned my chicken with Badilla all purpose seasoning instead of the Italian dressing and left in fridge for about 5 hours.  I increased my servings to 8 and it called for 2 3/4 cubes of broth but I only used 2 cubes. Glad I didn't increase it as it would have been too salty. I don't ever use salt so even the 2 cubes was almost a little salty for my tastes but my friends thought it was perfect. They really liked it & I was so happy as it was my first time making it!!   I definitely will make this again and again and most likely will use 1 cub of broth but surely no more than 2.  This will be one of my go to meals!

My husband wants this meal again.  I sauteed onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Along with spices and a couple dashes of hot sauce, I tossed in a can of diced tomatoes and enough water to measure 2-1/4 cups. 
Used extra b/s thighs (9 althogether), which really filled up the dish. Took quite a bit longer to cook, but it was a great weeknight meal!

This meal tasted like your typical chicken and rice casserole. I also used chicken broth and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown rice. Once the casserole was done I sprinkled Mozarella cheese on top of the chicken and broiled for a min or so..added alot of flavor. I would make again..and the family loved it. Good weeknight meal with a salad...but not a recipe I would share.

My boyfriend loved this recipe!  Said he could eat it everyday!
I also made a few changes - added garlic and chopped spinach to the rice mixture for one.
And two - Instead of chicken bouillon cube I just used 2 cups of chicken broth in place of the water.  
Lots of seasoning on the chicken and let it bake for 45-50min and it was so so so good!!

This recipe works, but could use more seasoning.  I also doubled the amount of rice because 1 cup of rice didn't seem like enough for 4 servings.

This was fabulous and a hit with my husband, toddler and baby. I only used 1 cube of bouillon, 2 tbs of butter and brown rice. Had to bake for 1 hr 15 minutes, covered the last 15 minutes. I used basil, garlic, onion powder, oregeno, thyme and adobo seasoning. Yum.

One of the very first times that I really didn't alter a recipe. I have to say, simple and delicious. The only changes I made was to use margarine instead of butter, and a garlic blend seasoning. I also threw in some frozen lima beans which were fantastic.

Five stars, except for user/cook error on my part.  Make sure you use the correct cooking vessel - a round, deep pyrex dish will not work.  Transferred to a different dish and results were fine.  Instead of water/boullion, I used chicken stock.   Also, I'm in Australia, and I recommend a 200C temp, with a cooking time of at least 40 minutes in correct vessel.  Great dish once I got the cooking done! Will definitely make again, very tasty!

This was wonderful!  Based upon others' reviews, I did make the following modifications:  I used boneless, skinless thighs, and sprinkled them with Adobo seasoning instead of Italian seasoning; I used two tablespoons of olive oil instead of the butter; and I made a batch of the Knorr chicken stock and used two cups of it in place of the bouillon + water.  This was total comfort food, and my husband scarfed down two generous helpings.  I definitely see this becoming a go-to recipe for boneless, skinless thighs!

Bummer!  I wasted 2 lbs of chicken on this dish.  I'm thinking it calls for "minute rice," but I used regular rice, and I also maybe used to much chicken (I had 8 pieces of thighs and 2 breast of white meat).  After almost an hour, the rice was still hard, the chicken was like rubber and I'm about to make it into soup.  Hopefully, things don't go to complete waste.  I was really looking forward to a dish that didn't use that midwestern (cream of mushroom soup).  Ug!

A delicious, comforting meal. I used 2 T. olive oil instead of the butter. To get this really soft and fully-cooked I needed to bake it for almost an hour and a half; 45 minutes seems far too short. We weren't crazy over the flavor the Italian seasoning gave to the dish. Next time I'll use seasoned salt and paprika.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and thought this was good.  I used jasmine rice because it is my favorite and I always have it on hand but had to bake it at least an hour and 15 minutes until the rice was tender.  The quoted time is absolutely not enough time for rice to cook.  My thighs were a bit thick so they needed the extra time as well.  Next time I will add some other veggies such as carrots as others have suggested.

I did not care for this. The chicken wasn't bad, but the rice was undercooked.  I ended up baking the rice for an additional 45 minutes.  So needless to say, all we had to eat was the chicken for dinner.

This is a great and easy recipe. I made this last night for my fam. and they loved it. I tweaked it a little though. Instead of the bullion cubes, I replaced the 2c of water with chicken broth and added a package of onion soup mix to the rice and broth. It was delicious!!!

I searched for a recipe to using the ingredients box because I really needed to go to the grocery store and I found this. I was totally satisfied with how this turned out! I never had a baked dish that I didn't have to precook the rice so I was skeptical about the fluffiness of the rice but it was delicious. Even the kids loved it and they hate baked chicken. I know it was better than good because my mother'n'law enjoyed it and she doesn't eat rice. This will definitely be a keeper in this house!

This is going to be a regular menu item for my family.  I used 1 cube chicken and 1 cube of chipolte bouilon to give the rice a little spicey flavor.   I used Basmati Rice as that is all I had.  As always, I added garlic salt to rice and on top of chicken.  After 30 minutes I stirred the rice and did so every 15 minutes until the chicken was done.

This is a good starter recipe. I used 2 cups of heated fat free/low sodium chicken broth for the water and bullion. To that I added 1 tablespoon dried onion, 3/4 teaspoon sage, 1 tablespoon celery flakes. I also lightly floured, salted and heavily peppered the chicken and browned in canola oil first. Baked for 45 minutes.

It was OK, nothing to rave about, but was easy and used things I had on hand without having to run to the store.  I should've sauteed the onions first before mixing with everything.

I've made this recipe twice this month...the first time I made it as written and it was great - goes together quick,  and both my hubby and I enjoyed it.    I did need to cook it for about an hour though to get the rice to absorb all of the water.   The second time I used more chicken (so we could could have more leftovers) and switched the onions with celery and I liked it even more...reminded me of the taste of stuffing which was wonderful since I don't eat wheat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good and very simple recipe that my whole family enjoyed.  Nice simple ingredients and the chicken adds loads of flavor to the rice as it cooks over it! I had to use brown rice and cooked it almost all the way first with the butter and boullion cubes.  I also only had bone in thighs and it took a bit longer to cook! Well done, thanks.

This recipe is a keeper.  My husband loves chicken thighs, so I'm also on the look out for something different.  This was easy and had a wonderfull flavor.  I followed the recipe as written, but did not serve it on rice ( trying to watch the calories).  I just put some of the mushroom gravy over the thighs and served it with a large salad.  I will be making this again soon.

flavorful rice!  The chicken definitely needed to cook longer than suggested by about 15-25 minutes longer.  It is an easy recipe.

Wow, we loved this!  I normally make a recipe as suggested but this time I skipped the boulion and just added about a tbs of soysauce to the water instead Substituted Traderr Joes 21 spice blend instead of the italian.  Used full amt of white sticky rice with 4 large thighs in smaller glass dish and baked at 375 for 40 min.  Delish!!

I think 2 bouillon cubes was too much, and as others said, it took much longer than 45 minutes. The water didn't even boil by 35, but the chicken looked ready. I left it it maybe a total of 50 to 60 minutes, and some of the rice was still hard, fortunately, the chicken remained moist. The only stray I made was to add one minced garlic clove.

This was not good and took much longer than 45 minutes to cook six thighs. I doctored this up quite a bit and nothing helped. My husband would hardly eat it and the rice came out dry. You might want to monitor the moisture level during cooking.

I parboiled as suggested and added a clove of garlic to the water along with a bit of olive oil. I used this as my water/broth for the rice. I also added diced carrots to the rice mixture and used brown rice. It was quite good, smelled great, and was very easy. Great one for a busy night.

This recipe has become one of my classics. Easy to make, not that much ingredients and easy to modify depending on your tastes!

I omit the onion since my girlfriends doesn't like them and put some greek spices on top of rice and chicken. I also reduce the amount of butter since the chicken fat tends to go in the rice. 

Very tasty, rice is always perfect and chicken is fully cooked.

My suggestion: when making this for the first time follow the recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, except I added some mushrooms and garlid to the rice. I cooked it for about 1 hour. The rice was not cooked enough. there are some problems with the recipe, too. It says to dissolve the boullion in 1 tbsn of water. It does not say the water has to be hot. It will not dissolve in cold water. Then it does not say what to do with this. It also says to put butter in with the rice. Butter does not mix well unless it is melted. the skin of the chicken was like rubber, so I tried broiling it a little bit, but it didn't help. I won't try this again.

Soooo easy and economical!  I added 1/2 cup liquid (used chicken broth), mushrooms and poultry seasoning.  I put the chicken right on top of the rice and it worked perfectly.  I cooked the chicken (boneless thighs) for 45 minutes while covered and another 15 uncovered (but I do have to cook things a bit longer in my oven). My husband loved it and he hates anything that remotely looks like a casserole.

We like this recipe. But I found I had to add more water than was called for, and that I had to stir the rice a few times or it comes out quite dry. Also, the second time I made this, I put the chicken on a small cooling rack on top of the baking dish, rather than right on top of the rice.

Well I tried this tonight, using other reviewer's changes.  The only reason I gave this two stars (as opposed to only one)is that I think that if I had made the recipe as written, it would have turned out better.  What I did was add more water, add spices, only use 1.5 tbs of butter, add frozen  veggies, cook with foil over for 45 mins and then take foil off for 15 mins.  What I got was undercooked (after 45 mins) soggy chicken/rice.  Then 15 mins later the rice was overcooked (but chix still slightly undercooked)!  The frozen veggies were, of course, overcooked.  The rice was overcooked and tasteless.  The chicken was okay, but it would have been better had I just baked it regularly with olive oil and spices on it.  If I were to make this again (which I won't!) I'd completely skip the frozen veggies (have a side of veggies or salad instead), use maybe just a quarter cup extra water, use the recommended amount of butter (for you people who complain of it being greasy... TAKE THE SKIN OFF YOUR THIGHS!), add some garlic, seasoned salt, cook recommended time (maybe more) UNCOVERED.  Good luck.

Even though I browned the thighs before adding to the cooking dish this recipe came out very greasy. I didn't even add the butter. A 1/2 cube of butter would have made this even more greasy. I won't be making this again.

The BEST recipe by far for rice I've ever eaten.  I often make just the rice and double or triple the recipe.  Always requested and ALWAYS eaten!!!

this recipe came out good, but i think it could have been a little tastier with potatos or mushrooms. it was a little plain for a meal.

This is a super easy and good basic recipe. I did what others suggested and added 1/2 cup of water. I warmed up water (just the 1/2) with butter and minced onions, then added to rice and rest of water. I browned the thighs as suggested, and added frozen mixed veggies to mixture. Baked covered 45 min, then 15 uncovered. Came out really good, and as long as you are using enough seasoning, it's not bland. This recipe is easy to do and alter to preference. Thanks!!

I thought this recipe was bland even though I added garlic.  It also took a lot more water than the recipe called for.  I won't make this one again.

I am cooking this and so far it is really good, except that it defintely takes longer than 35 to 45 mins. I've already had it in there for 55mins and the chicken is still bloody in the middle. A great taste though. I will defintely make this again.

My husband can be a really picky eater, but he absolutely raved about this dish. Usually he doesn't say anything, but he complimented me three times on this. It's also very easy to prepare and simple enough that even my four year old cleaned his plate.

Great recipe. I've made this many times and its just as great each time. The rice is a little crunchy on top but thats my favorite part about it.I did have to cook it for 60 min. to make sure the chicken was done. Will definately keep this recipe around. Thanks!!!

Season the chicken under the skin (or remove the skin if that's your preference), either with Adobo, season salt or Mrs. Dash. Add fresh or frozen mixed veggies to the rice and increase the water by 1/2 to 1 cup. Cover tightly with foil and stir the rice halfway through cooking.

This was just okay. Luckily, I used instant rice, so that part was tasty we thought. I cooked it at 375 for 55 minutes and it got to temp. But the recipe itself was vague and frustrating to follow.

Very good! I made some of the same changes that other posters mentioned. I added carrots and a splash of wine.  Husband loves chicken and rice bake, but I find it rather bland. This was not. I browned 4 chicken thighs in olive oil  with garlic salt for - 3 to 4 minutes.  Removed from pan, cooked the carrots and onions. I followed the original recipe with the rice, water, bouillon and butter in the mix.   Topped the rice mixture with the thighs and baked in 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. Delicious!

I used chicken broth , low salt, instead of bouillon and put lemon pepper spice on the chicken. Cooked it at 400 as it wasn’t even cooking the rice after 45 minutes at 350 in a convection oven. A big hit!

I found that my rice didn’t soak up the water even after baking for over an hour. I added some steamed broccoli for color and some seasoned salt on the chicken as another reviewer suggested.  I will try baking at a higher temperature next time.

Simply chicken and rice. I substituted brown rice for white rice. I sautéed  onion, celery,  carrot and mushrooms with a little garlic. Then I added the rice and cooked it about  20 minutes before adding chicken.  You can use any seasoning you like on the chicken. Lovely simple, but  yummy recipe.

I love this recipe. So easy to make and my family loved it. I also added a can of mushroom soup to the recipe which made it all the more flavorful. I served mine with buttermilk bisquits. A quick but hearty meal that will surely please every appetite.

We quite enjoyed this and with some tweaks the rice was very tasty. Tweaks- used a small onion, a shallot and 2 tsps. of minced garlic. Cooked these together before adding rice and chicken broth.  I used half olive oil and half butter. The next time I will half the oil/butter combo. With the skin left on the chicken there was too much fat. The chicken was tasty but a bit chewy. I may try it without skin next time.

My husband and toddler and I loved this meal! I added a foil packet of green beans to the oven in the last 15 min to complete the dish. I also used wild rice which I think made the cooking time longer-almost an hour. But that wasn’t a problem, the thighs weren’t ovecooked and stayed very juicy. Next time I’ll just use boiling water to cook the rice faster.

This recipe was very frustrating.  After 45 minutes in the oven, the thighs were still really raw.  I left them in another 25 minutes and pulled them out.  The thighs were done but the rice was still crunchy.  I had to pull the rice out and cook it on the stove.  This recipe did not work for me at all.

This was a delicious dish and pretty easy to make. I did a few things differently but basically stuck to the original recipe. I skipped the bouillon cubes and water but used chicken broth instead, I added a couple minced garlic cloves in with the chopped onion, I used some garlic powder, lemon pepper, and seasoned salt on the chicken thighs. And lastly, I baked the chicken an additional 15 minutes and then put it under the broiler for about 10 minutes. I also made some additional rice in my microwave to add to the rice baked with the chicken. I made mixed veggies for our side dish. Delicious

I love chicken with rice so I thought, great, everything in one pan - it couldn't get any easier but I found it to be quite heavy and too fatty. With the chicken resting on top of the rice, all that fat gets mixed with the rice after already adding a substantial amount of butter. I intend to give the recipe one more chance though. Next time I will eliminate the butter entirely. That might make a very big difference. One note too: the rice at 45 minutes is still very soggy. I had to add 15 minutes and probably could have gone another 10.

I thought this was a pretty easy recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I did add additional seasonings to taste (Mrs Dash products, basal and thyme). I think the two bouillon cubes gave the Uncle Bens rice good flavor. I also cooked  it covered about 45 minutes and uncovered 20 minutes to make sure the rice was cooked. The family really enjoyed.

This was so easy & so good! Really a simple, fast recipe that also has endless possibilities to change up the ingredients in the rice for different taste. I only had one thigh on hand, boo! So I used a 7.5" air fryer round deep handled pan, 1/2 cup rice & 1 cup homemade chicken broth, left out the butter. Browned thigh in pat of clarified butter, removed, then carmelized onion & garlic. Added broth & rice, fast simmered a couple of minutes, added Worcestershire & Kitchen Bouquet, Tony Chacerie's. Added to bake pan with chicken on top, covered with aluminum foil & it was PERFECT in 30 min. Love this recipe, thanks for sharing!

I rated it 4 stars because I did make some changes to the original recipe. I lightly breaded and browned the chicken with a bunch of spices (garlic salt, garlic pepper, onion powder, smoked paprika, Ms. Dish no-salt seasoning, rosemary, oregano... basically a mix and match of my fav spices) before adding it to the rice mixture. Made a big difference with the flavor!! Everything was flavorful and moist. A new go-to easy weekday recipe for the family!

This is a pretty basic recipe, but it's not bad. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe's "method", choosing to saute my onions in butter first and then brown my seasoned chicken thighs in the same pan to get the skin crispy and give them a little head start in cooking, since mine were pretty large and also still slightly frozen. If I make it again, I will do all of that, plus add some veggies. I think this could be a great "clean out the crisper" meal.

I made this with a few changes: I used chicken broth instead of water to cook my rice and added pepper and seasoning salt and brought it to a boil and cooked it for a while before adding chicken. I used chicken thighs with skin, which ended up being bland so next time I will use chicken breast. I recommend baking the chicken a while before putting it with the rice. It turned out great tho!

It tasted good, but I made it by itself and it needed something. I would change the recipe to make it with peppers n give it a hint of sweetness for depth and add some type of biscuit or something. I'm glad that it was easy and basic as far as recipes. My family didn't really care for it but it's out of our norm to eat something like this. Glad I made it.

Execellent! I didn't use ITalian seasoning. Instead I used a bit of seasoning salt, and then some Mrs. Dash Table Blend. Also used a little more hot water than usual for the bouillon cubes! Definitely will make again!

I really liked the idea of this dish. Simple,  flavourful and everyday ingredients. Almost like a "paella ". I added some cilantro, frozen carrots and peas to the rice. I used both thighs and drumsticks to make it more for a bigger family. I lightly fried the chicken prior to putting them.on top of the bed of rice. Great recipe !! ??

I made it...I enjoyed it...made a few tweaks:
Add some chorizo cut up in chunks
Add celery
Add fresh chopped tomato
Add garlic
Add mushrooms
Use already seasoned rice like Uncle Ben's wild rice
Use chicken broth instead of water
Add some white wine
Don't add butter
Cook for 55 minutes...
Presto! Yumminess in a bowl - like an updated version of chicken soup for the soul!

Quick and easy! The whole family enjoyed it. I sautéed zucchini and tossed it on top after I baked it for 50 minutes. 
I used earth balance vegan margarine spread instead of butter because of food allergies.  I will make this again.

While I really like the recipe, I have made changes. I use chicken stock or broth instead of bullion. I like adding other veggies in - some favorites are zucchini, peas, carrots, tomatoes. I can change the seasonings up if I want to (which is fantastic, because I can buy the base ingredients and make different versions); lemon and lime, fajita seasoning, basic salt and pepper and paprika, etc. This time I stuffed sliced garlic under the chicken skin. Yum. If I use oil instead of butter, I only use a tablespoon or two otherwise it's too greasy.

I love this recipe and have come back to it time and time again. I'm one of those people who look at a recipe as a starting point and then add to it, though, so I always change things up. In this case, I saute chopped celery, carrots, onions, and garlic (LOTS of garlic) first (otherwise the veggies aren't soft enough) and then add it to the rice mixture, which I stir well. I also throw in whatever spices float my boat that day...generally Italian seasoning, sometimes a little curry, garlic salt, pepper, etc. The last time I made this, I took another reviewer's suggestion and combined barley with the rice. That was fantastic! I also season the chicken with more spices...again, whatever strikes my fancy ...and then bake it for a little longer: usually about an hour and fifteen...simply because the rice needs a little more cooking time as far as I'm concerned. This  is my go-to dish for chicken thighs!

Doubled the recipe and came out great; paired it with a homemade wild rice side.  Tasty and will make again.

It was so easy to make but we found it a bit bland. Seasoned the chicken with roasted red pepper and garlic seasoning and we were digging for the rice under the chicken to get more flavor. Will make again but will add more seasoning.

This was a real ''man pleaser''!!  I had a friend over for dinner using him as my guinea pig... He LOVED it and had ''3'' servings..I didn't have thighs so I used 8 chicken legs ....I took some advise from others and sauteed ''onion, carrots & celery'' & added it to the rice mixture... Everything else was the same... The ''rice'' was so well seasoned with the extra ''veggies'' flavors... My friend could not stop Raving!!   Will make this again!  

UPDATE:  I didn't have Italian Seasoning in my cupboard this time, so I made my own: 1/4 tsp. EACH  of dried Rosemary, Thyme , Oregano & Basil leaves... That really makes the Rice even more flavorful & DELICIOUS.

Followed Cassie Walker's advice.  Bland even with additional salt. Did not add any butter/additional oils after initial olive oil to brown and sauté.  Cooked in dutch oven but took longer than 45 minutes, upped oven to 375 for additional 25 minutes. Will make again but add more seasoning.  Rice mixture very good, added green onion to onion, celery, and carrot.

My family LOVED this! My only issue was that it needed much longer cooking time than posted. My oven is brand new and runs hot so not a problem with my oven and the thighs were not huge either. I did not have any plain rice on hand so I did use a box of Rice-Roni Long Grain & Wild Rice (yes the season packet too.) Then I used I think Kraft brand italian seasoning packet. It was delish!!!! no additional spices were needed and it was anything but bland. I do think that you could reduce the butter and have the same result. I will definitely be making this again.

Been a member for years but my first review. I took this and sort of ran with it. Basic recipe was great, but I added diced fresh carrots, diced red and green peppers and mushrooms to the rice mixture. I used garlic powder, salt, pepper, ground Italian seasoning and paprika on the chicken. Baked it a lot longer because I had big chicken pieces. It's a great recipe you can make your own depending on personal preference. Will definitely make this again!

I thought is was a very simple and delicious recipe. It doesn't take a lot of work or effort. The only thing I would do differently is not put oil since the chicken already has its own oil so it would be less greasy without the oil.

I lined my glass 13x9 pan with foil and covered with foil for the first 30 minutes. It took an additional 45 minutes for the chicken to reach 165 degrees internally. I would leave it uncovered next time to reduce cooking time and crisp up the skin, and add more seasoning to the rice beforehand to increase flavor.

This is a simple way to make a quick delicious meal using whatever you have in your frig. I added fresh mushrooms, julienned carrots, sweet peppers and parsley to the rice in addition to some black pepper, 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a pinch of thyme. About halfway thru the baking I added paprika to the top for color . The result was flavorful and we went back for seconds.

Great! But it does need extra seasoning. I followed others suggestions and mixed the rice with the butter, garlic and onions, pinch of season salt and garlic powder. Added 1/2 cup of white wine. And seasoned the thighs with salt, garlic powder, dashes of dried oregano and basil. All around, a keeper!

I found this recipe easy and pretty good, stress free.  I used jasmine riceI cooked it at 355 degrees and for 55 mins.   The wording of  it can be more clear eg, what to do with the spices.

I must use big thighs because this took an hour and 15 minutes. The rice wasn't ready within the 45 minutes mentioned.  Rice was greasy and not very flavorful, although my adult daughter liked it. I wasn't impressed. I won't make it again.

Sorry. I somehow posted my last review before I was finished. Here are my substitutions (I failed to take inventory of the ingredients needed for the recipe):  3 tbsp. of canola oil instead of the butter; my homemade seasoning mix (another recipe I found on this site) instead of Italian seasoning and; leftover chicken stock (was on its way to being thrown out and wasted) instead of water. Like I tried to express in my last post, I've been making this recipe as published for years and we never have leftovers! This is NOT an attempt to re-write the recipe, but rather, be helpful to others who may be short on or out of some items.

I tweaked it a little to add more flavor and veggies; also added a pack of Italian dressing seasoning mix, garlic and onion powder, a can of low fat broccoli and cheese soup, fresh broccoli florets and shredded fresh carrot pieces. 

This was after browning the thighs on the stove and then adding them and the rendered juices to the casserole before baking. Not bad at all!

Love this! I had 9 thighs to did time and a half on qty. However, I used 4 pkts of Herb Ox Chicken bouillon & melted the butter.  I used a lot of the Italian Seasoning & sprinkled minced garlic over the top. My family loved it! Oh, I cooked it for 50 min. It was full of flavor.

This was very tasty. I did modify the recipe a little. I have a big family and we like leftovers so I doubled it. I used 3 cups Jasmine rice (really can't go wrong with it), four cloves of fresh garlic minced finely, omitted the onions and used an extra bullion cube for a total of five. Plus, I added a bag of frozen Pigeon Peas. The thighs had bones and skin, which I seasoned myself (no Italian seasoning) with Tony's  Creole seasoning salt, dried thyme, dried rosemary, and black pepper. Cooked it in a roasting pan with lid on 350 for approximately 75 min. The whole family loved it.  Definitely making this a regular.

Boys in the house so I doubled everything (minus the bullion) added 2 cans of green beans, cream of mushroom soup, season salt, and garlic. Cooked for 40 min @ 350 covered, then added shredded cheese and baked uncovered for 10 min. LET REST for at least 10 min before serving. Not only is it too hot right away, but the rice mix sets and thighs hold juice better :-)

Mine didn't turn out great. But after reading some other reviews and suggestions I will try it again. I used brown short grain rice, it's what I had.  I didn't add extra time but did leave it in the oven a while after the 45 minutes. I used boneless, skinless thighs, which were on the small side. The chicken was a little over done and the rice was crunchy. I guess I'll try boiling the rice a bit first next time.

This tasted really good but was greasy, and I will make additional changes next time I cook it. I did make some changes this first time as well. I browned the onions first in olive oil and then browned the chicken on both sides. I drained the grease (next time should make sure ALL grease is out of pan), and put the rice on bottom like recipe states. Then I added the chicken and put the onions on top. Next time I will also cut the butter (it's definitely not necessary). If it comes out greasy again I will make sure to omit the skin on the next go round.

I took the suggestions from other reviews and it turned out great! I switched it up a little, though...I added 1/2 cup of white wine, decreased butter, eliminated the bouillon all together, added minced fresh garlic, and used a parsley, sage, rosemary, & thyme rub on the chicken before placing in the pan! So good!!

This recipe was awesome.  I just have one complaint:  the recipe itself wasn't too clear.  I felt like I was making things up as I went along (not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but when you're in a hurry, you don't have time to second guess yourself or try to figure things out on your own that should be well-recorded for you).  For example:  do you dissolve the bullion separately?  If so, at what point do you add it back to the rice mixture?  It's not clear.  I think it would be helpful if this was corrected.

Other than that, the recipe was great!  The meat was tender and juicy, and the butter & bullion with the rice was amazing!  Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow night!

My family loved this recipe. I was hard on time and my daughter was having a sleepover so it was quick and easy. I did use chicken breast one time when I didn't have any chicken thighs on hand. For me I made it Spicer. I added one teaspoon of cayenne pepper and curry powder. I also added some garlic like two cloves. Sometimes I add cream of mushroom soup and sometimes I use beef bouillon instead of the chicken one. I also use canned or fresh veggies when they need some veggies. All in all an great recipe

Good recipe.  We substituted butter for olive oil and used boneless skinless thighs. Then we mixed the oil and rice in the dish, sprinkling onions on top to bake at 450 for 15 minutes.  We then followed the recipe adding a splash of tomatoes sauce to the liquid mixture.  We give it four stars for easiness and great taste.

I'd suggest adding garlic, basil, and parsley. Brown the thighs first and increase cook time by 10 mins. Also, try cutting the butter; it comes out a bit greasy.

This is a delicious, quick, one-pan meal.  I used saffron rice, which I really think made all the difference.  I also added chopped garlic to the rice mixture.  Seriously good.

SO easy and I cooked it in my mini convection oven. Made some adjustments...used 6 small frozen boneless, skinless thighs. Par boiled in chicken bouillon until no longer pink then used 1 cup of boiled broth to melt second bouillon. Mixed 1 cup boiled chicken water and 1 cup bouillon with basmati rice. Used half of the  butter and approx 1 tbsp olive oil in the rice mixture.  Added minced onion, garlic powder and a small amount of cayenne pepper. Mixed in one can of corn, drained. Topped with salt, pepper and italian seasoning. Baked 350 in mini convection oven in a 8x8 dish. Stirred rice every 10 minutes or so. Cooked 45 minutes and was perfect!!
Loved that I had all ingredients on hand, very quick easy and budget friendly!
Was extremely flavorful. My husband raved over it! Asked me to make it once a week...

It was ok. The grease from the chicken really soaked into the rice though. Wasn't really fan of the rice.

we enjoyed this recipe very much, tonight is my 4th time making it, and as many of the others stated, I also added our own touches to it.  I diced up carrots, and minced fresh mushrooms.  I also added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup instead of butter I used minced garlic in olive oil. My kids love it and my husband who is a super picky eater actually requests this meal.

This was delicious, however my rice was not cooked enough. Could be because the chicken thighs were small and were done in 35 mins.  Next time I will partial cook my rice first. I didn't have bouillon so I used chicken broth. I seasoned the thighs with garlic powder, oregano and thyme and I left out the italian seasoning.

I forgot to read reviews prior to cooking.  More seasoning and less butter were needed.  Vegetables would be a plus.

We loved this!
I added frozen peas, fresh sliced mushrooms, a dash of pepper, garlic powder, and mrs dash (italian blend).  But found it needed an additional 20 minutes in the oven. Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe! I only changed one or two things..I used chicken broth instead of water and omitted the bullion. I also used curry seasoning instead of the italian seasoning...It gives it an interesting spin...I also added corn on top, so I didn't need to cook veggies seperate! but as is, it was pretty awesome!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! You can do so much with it and it still tastes great. I made a few changes that really gave it great flavor. I did not have bouillon, so I substituted a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, a small can of mushrooms, and slightly less butter (to keep the fat down). I followed another posters suggestion and parboiled my boneless, skinless thighs in water for 10 minutes then used the water for my 2 cups. I mixed the water, rice, mushroom soup and mushrooms first in my Pampered Chef Deep Dish Baker. I dotted the top of that with the butter then put the chicken on top and finished with a combination of italian seasoning and a garlic seasoning from Tastefully Simple. Cooked it in the microwave for 20 minutes and let sit for another 10 covered to just finish the chicken. OMGosh! It was very tasty!!

Very good!  Had to cook longer than recipe stated.  The rice had such a nice flavor and the chicken was so moist.  This dish heats up well, which is good for this family working different shifts!

Not a bad recipe for a mom of 3 little ones to prepare while keeping one eye on the kids. Some of the rice was a little crunchy, most was sticky, which I love. I used a large onion as and it was very flavorful, also I am always very liberal with the Italian herb blend. Overall, a great recipe for a weeknight!

This is a great, easy dinner when you're short on time.  Added some green chiles and cayenne pepper for some kick.  Will definitely keep this one in my back pocket for when I'm in a crunch.

This was a great recipe for last minute!  I had chicken thighs and searched this site to find this recipe.  Everyone loved it, I did add carrots b/c we all love them.  Next time I will remove the skin as it does produce alot of grease...but it was soooo yummy!  Thanks for posting this recipe!!  It's a keeper for us.

The chicken is awesome in this recipe...the rice is better than plain rice, which is why it gets four stars instead of five.  My only changes were to use olive oil in place of butter as many suggested, to season the chicken with seasoning salt, and sprinkle garlic powder over the entire thing.  I cooked it 55 minutes to get the rice cooked, and let it sit for 5 more.  Nice on pot meal.  Thanks!

Very good base recipe but needs a little more oomph, added reconstituted dried mushrooms to the rice mixture, as well as onion and garlic powder. Also, seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder and a little of the italian seasoning. I like my rice to have a crunch to the surface so cooked until the top layer looked crispy and a little dried out.

This was pretty good, but next time I'll use half as much butter - even though I skinned my thighs it was greasy.  I used poultry seasoning and a little celery salt instead of Italian seasoning, and I used 1/4 cup of cooking sherry for some of the water.  I had a jar of cute little Japanese mushrooms that I tossed in there, but I should have used fresh ones to absorb some of that excess butter.  My husband really liked it.

This was so simple and delicious. I cut down on salt by not using a boulion cube. I also added julienned baby carrots, sliced mushrooms and herbs (sage, thyme, garlic powder) to the chicken. This was the perfect comfort food on a cold evening.

I just made this, pretty much exactly as explained (though I used 1/2 an onion, it was very large). It was ok, but the rice came out pretty overcooked for some reason. It did have a pretty good flavor though, and it's a very inexpensive dish. I would make this again, but not often.

This is a yummy recipe!!  Used 1 can of chicken broth and 1/4 cup water.  No chicken bouillon. I took the the skin off the thighs.  I sauteed onion and mushroom in part of the butter and mixed the rest of the butter melted into the rice.  My only difficulty was the rice took about 90 mins. to cook.  I took the chicken out after about 50 mins., covered the dish and let the rice cook more.  It turned out delicious, but I think next time I will cook the rice before putting in the oven.

This is one of the easiest simpliest recipes. I thought it would be plain but i made some modifications that made it so full of flavor that my husband wanted me to make it two nights in a row. I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies with the rice and also 1/2 a turkey kelbasa sausage. It was awesome.

Good receipe.  Made some changes though... I took other folks advice and added garlic, onion, bell pepper and spices of my choice (red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper & bay leaf).  I also used brown rice and added a can of cream of chicken (try mushroom maybe next time) to the fluid mixture for rice.  Also browned the chicken before placing in the casserole dish.

This recipe could lend itself to any change I believe, so change I did. Need to get those down before I forget, lol. I diced a small onion, and 3 stalks of celery, sauteed in 3 TB of butter, then added 2-3 inch cuts of fresh asparagus, let it sautee a bit, then deglazed pan with 2 cups of "Kitchen Basics" chicken stock. Added 1 tsp. Italian Seasoning, salt and pepper. Stirred in 1 cup of long grain white rice, and poured all into a greased 13x9 in. pan.  I topped the rice/veggie mixture with 6 bone-in chicken thighs and sprinkled those with some Paprika (I just felt with the lovely greens a touch of red would be nice visually, if I hadn't been lazy I think some diced pimento or better still roasted red peppers would be lovely.) Well I was very disappointed so changed from an anticipatory rating of 4 down to a 2 star. If I hadn't added the asparagus this would have had no taste whatsoever. Definitely a workable idea. I would add 3 cloves of minced garlic, thinking about diced tomato...or the roasted red peppers I had thought about, possibly some red  pepper flakes, just a few to zip this up a bit.  I used Kitchen Basics Stock which is very good, very flavorful...even with that this was so bland it was just sad. As I say, don't discount the concept...but trust me, doctor this up!

Yummy! I didn't change a thing, and my husband loved this! My recommendation is to make it "as is" for your first time around so you have an idea of how it tastes before you experiment.

Yummy. Grated parmesan puts this dish over the edge!! Sprinkle it on liberally right before serving. Almost tastes like risotto. Make sure you cook it long enough so the rice isn't crunchy. For me it took about 50 minutes. I also used olive oil and garlic instead of butter and onion. I'm actually eating it right now!!

A delicious recipe that is light and quick to make! It refreshing to eat a chicken/rice dish that is not cream base. I sauteed onions in butter for a few minutes before mixing it in with everything else. I seared chicken thighs on both sides before laying it on top bed of rice. Other than that I followed the recipe and ingredients to a T. yummie! my hubbie asked for seconds!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I think it would have been better had I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  It just came out really greasy using the chicken thighs.

I made a few changes such as cutting back to one cube of bouillon and using 2 cups of chicken broth in place of the water. I also omitted the Italian seasoning and used poultry seasoning both in the rice as well as on the chicken. It turned out great and was definitely a change from the ordinary.

This recipe was simple and quick to make.  The chicken came out nice and juicey and tender.  The rice came out ok but it seemed that the recipe should of had more water.  Also the chicken flavor didn't stay that well in the rice, maybe four cubes of boullion would have been better.  But overall I would make this recipe again and just make adjustments.  Definately a recipe that you can reuse by adding different things to it.  The kids can even help stir things together.

I'm not a big chicken thigh person, but we had some that needed to be cooked and this recipe seemed very simple.  I didn't have boullion, so I used chicken broth instead of water to flavor the rice.  I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, and Nature's Seasoning.  It came out very tasty and the chicken was very moist.  A very simple meal that was very easy to put together!

Made this for dinner last night, but I reduced the recipe to only 1 chicken thigh and 3/4 cup of uncooked rice. That alone took about 35 minutes to cook, so I would imagine that 6 thighs would take much longer. The chicken came out perfectly! It was so delicious and moist. The first layer of rice was hard at the top, but after I stirred it around with the moist rice from the bottom it didn't bother me. Also, didn't use the butter (for health reasons) and cut down the amount of boullion. Also, I used red onions and the colour looked great mixed in with white rice. I would make this again using the same technique and different kinds of marinades and veggies in the rice.

This recipe was a little bland and I followed it precisely.  No one at my dinner table complained however and it was definitely edible.  I gave it 3 stars because if I do make it again I will definitely need to alter it- the consistency of the rice was not right, it lacked flavor, the chicken itself was bland.  Might be a good starting place though.

Just wanted to say my boyfriend, who is very picky loved this recipe.  I used chicken broth and not the cubes and melted the butter as suggested and added the extra 1/2 cup of broth.  I did add a small amount of mushrooms.  The taste of the rice was really good.  Although I used a pyrex dish and had 2 thighs and 4 drumsticks and it took about 1.5 hours to cook.  It's easy to make and I will definitely make this again.

This recipe will be a keeper.  One of my kids liked everything, the other two liked the either the chicken or the rice but not both.  The only things I did different as some of the other review suggested was I parboiled the chicken first and used the water from the boiling. I only used 1/2 onion.  Will reduce the margarine the next time.  Thanks for all the ideas.

The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly, and it was just OK. The next time, I decided to make some changes: I used only 1 bouillon cube, 1-1/2 cups brown rice, only 1 Tbsp butter, extra onion and fresh garlic, 1 cup frozen peas and canned mushrooms. It came out much better! It wasn't too greasy once I cut the butter down. I'll make this one again (with my changes)!

This dish was pretty good. I used low sodium chicken broth and added a little bit of additional seasoning (1 t. Mrs. Dash) to the rice for flavor.

Awesome! Kids loved it, they didn't even mind the onions. I did increase the rice serving.
