So good! Used all fat free/low sodium chix broth instead of adding water. Added sauteed onion and garlic to the meatballs as well as a pinch of nutmeg which I love in ground chicken. I also added sliced zucchini and 1 can of small white beans to the soup. Instead of baking the meatballs, I dropped them into the soup and let them cook in the broth. I also omitted the egg in the meatball mixture, didnt think it needed it. Loved this soup, reminded me of Italian Wedding soup. I'm always looking for ways to use ground chicken or turkey, and this is a great recipe. Thanks!

A tasty soup-- good over rice or noodles.  I omitted the parsnips because I don't care for them much, and I increased garlic.

We really enjoyed this, and the smell while it was cooking was unbelievable!  This is a great summer soup, because it feels light while still filling you up.  We followed the recipe exactly, which by the way, doesn't mention noodles in the ingredients list, so make sure you have some cooking while the soup's simmering.  It also doesn't mention to remove the bay leaves before serving, which being in a hurry, I also forgot to do :P  If you have any leftovers, they reheat VERY well, my husband says even better than the first time around.

Perfect for on a cold day! I omitted the parsnips (didn’t have any) and added small pasta shells and fresh thyme sprigs. The meatballs were a nice change from the usual chicken soup. I’ll definitely make it again, though I’ll tweak the meatballs a bit for a little more flavor. Thanks, Betty!

Cooked this for my boyfriend when he was sick. Wonderful recipe! I left out the parsnips, and added egg noodles to bulk up the soup. 

Tastes good with 1/4th the sauteed onions mixed into the meatballs before cooking.

This is a great base recipe.  I use ground chicken a lot and this a good use for it.  When I first read the recipe, I thought, "why do I need running water while making meatballs?"  That seemed odd to put in a recipe, but I guess it would help a beginner.

I added garlic powder & white pepper to the meatballs.  Browned them with the convection oven.  Substituted parsely and summer savory for the parsnips.  Added a few chopped jalapenos, red pepper, and some edamame.  Also added white pepper and garlic powder to the broth to get the taste to our liking. Used low-sodium chicken broth and no added salt to the meat or the broth. Added Amish garlic egg noodles directly to the broth.  A great soup to have when getting over the cold/flu...I made this in December, not summer.

I made this soup for supper tonight, with a few changes, and it was very good.  I did not have parsnips, but I did have a zucchini, so I quartered and sliced it and substituted it for the parsnip.  Also, did not have egg noodles, so I added some rice (a little less than one cup) right to the soup.  My kids loved the meatballs!  I will use a little less pepper next time in the meat mixture.  And I'll try it with the noodles and parsnips, too!  Seems pretty versatile.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe! 

I vary a bit from the directions as written, though, and have found it results in a more flavorful soup. I begin the whole process by cooking onion and garlic in olive oil until soft. I add half of this to my ground chicken for my meatballs. For the meatballs, I omit the egg but add  salt, pepper, herbs (i usually use thyme and rosemary) and NUTMEG (!!!). I form the meatballs and cover them with a wet paper towel and put them in the fridge for later. 

Meanwhile back in the pot, I add the chopped carrots and celery (I also omit the parsnip) to the onion and garlic and season with a pinch (just a pinch!) of turmeric. I let the veggies cook for a few minutes before adding the broth and bay leaves. Once this mixture comes to a boil, I add the 4 c water and allow it to boil again. (*** You can let it cook like this, covered, pretty much as long as you want! Longer = more flavor! It will reduce some, though, so be prepared for that or add more water, 1c at a time! ***) When its getting close to eatin' time, I carefully drop the meatballs into the soup mixture 1 at a time and let them cook in the broth rather than baking them. I also boil some egg noodles separately for adding to the soup (I do this so everyone can add as many or as few noodles as they want, also so they don't turn to mush sitting in the hot soup!). 

The result is OUTSTANDING! A cold winter night go-to in our house! It also freezes beautifully, sometimes we make a double batch for later!

I made some modifications to this one as well. 

To the meatballs I added fresh Parmesan cheese , grated fresh garlic and fresh chopped parsley in conjunction with the bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Chicken is really a flavorless meat until you add the seasonings to it. Salt and pepper are not enough in my opinion. 

For the broth I used chicken stock instead of broth and used 5 chicken bouillon cubes after I added the water to the stock. I also added an array of fresh herbs from my garden like fresh basil, thyme and parsley. 
My family liked it a lot.

I loved this soup! I used ground turkey rather than chicken for an even lighter meal and skipped the baking of the meatballs. It's unnecessary. You can just drop the meatballs into the boiling soup. I served it over egg noodles. Delicious, flavorful, and comforting.

I used 1 lb. of organic ground chicken for this recipe. To the meat mixture I added chopped garlic, fresh parsley, basil and fresh grated parmesan cheese for more flavor along with other ingredients called for. The preparation time is not correct because it took 30 minutes for prep time including forming 18 small meatballs. The meatballs took 15 minutes to bake but I flipped them over halfway through baking to ensure even browning. I used 4 cups of low-sodium chicken broth in place of water. I did not have any parsnips on hand so I just used 2 large carrots, 2 stalks of celery plus I added chopped garlic, chopped red onions and fresh parsley. When the soup came to a good boil I slowly added the cooked chicken meatballs. I served the soup over some cooked egg noodles, which I prepare earlier, and I garnished with more minced parsley. This was a fresh, delicious and hearty take on classic chicken noodle soup. I served this over a bed of egg noodles. The chicken meatballs were scrumptious and flavorful.

Excellent soup.  Did not use parsnips.  I mixed half of the sauteed onion and garlic into the meatballs; made the meatballs the size of walnuts; cooked no yoke egg noodles in broth before added baked meatballs. Did not use water; instead used 64 ounces of organic chicken broth. Very tasty!

AMAZING MEATBALLS!! The only thing I added was a little bit of minced garlic and a tiny bit of sliced zucchini (which REALLY adds moisture to ground chicken or turkey.)

Afterward, I tossed fresh spinach into the soup as well.. DELICIOUS! I will definitely save this one!!

This recipe is all about those little meatballs, which were very flavorful and made this soup fun, delicious and different. I would say the prep time is a bit off. Forming the meatballs is quite time consuming, and I actually made mine bigger than I think the recipe intends just to make it go faster. It makes a LOT of them. I adjusted the vegetables  to allow for what my family likes, and added in a cup of orzo to cook in the broth near the end, as I had no egg noodles. This recipe goes in our 'favorite soups' file. Thank you!

Only thing I did different was use ground turkey breast instead of chicken and added about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese & about 1 tsp of garlic powder to the meatball mixture.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and my family said it was pretty good.  This was something new for us because we've never had parsnips before but bowls went to the sink clean so that means.... Two thumbs up! Great soup to eat with a cold... I'm tempted to make it again and freeze it, and be able to pull it out when/if we get the sniffles.  Thanks!

I added fresh green beans and yellow squash (I didn't have parsnips) along with the other veggies. Before serving I added a can of petit diced tomatoes then topped each bowl with parmesan cheese.

This is one of those good, clean tasting soups, that taste like Grandma made it.  I didnt have parsnips, in fact I've never had parsnips, but I bet it would add something good.  The meatballs didnt taste too chickeny either, which was nice, I added some extra spices in the meatballs, such as ground mustard, paprika, the broth is simple so it can stand up to that.

I pretty much followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious! I followed other's suggestions and added some sauteed onion and garlic to the meatballs, along with some poultry seasoning and garlic powder. I liked the meatballs baked- nice color and flavor. I also skipped the parsnips and added zucchini and white beans with the meatballs. The beans sank to the bottom, of course- but it was so delicious!

my family liked this very much (baby, 8 year old, husband, and me).  i used low sodium broth, and it still ended up having an excellent flavor; my husband went so far as to say the broth was perfect.  i think the meatballs could use a little less pepper, but otherwise were very good.  i would have liked to use parsnips, but i didn't have any; i did have sliced fresh mushrooms so i used those.  i also added a little chopped spinach at the end to give it a little more color and to get some more veggies in.  very good.

This was a good soup. I did think the meatballs needed salt and other spices added to them because they were very bland. I used light chix stock instead of water, alot of more parsnip (BIG fan!) and added some sriracha sauce. At the end of cooking I also threw in some fresh spinach.

I love this soup. The meatballs are delicious. My husband doesn't eat beef, so I am always looking for ways to use ground chicken. This is a great recipe. I like to add more veggies and basil to add more body to the soup. I don't think noodles are necessary. Very filling and wonderful!

This soup is delicious.  Second time I made it I added frozen dumpling noodles with the broth and all other veggies (omitting the parsnips)to boil and simmer for 30 minutes.  Five minutes before serving I added fresh spinach and a tablespoon of lemon juice for a nice alternative.

I made as stated basically. WAY too much parsnips. I like parsnips but thought the taste in this recipe was way overwhelming.

Wonderful, we love soup and I am always looking for something that can be low fat, low salt.  I did not add any additional salt and used low salt broth.  Ground chicken breast fit the bill and I like the meatballs so much I was eating them right of the oven.  Added pearl noodles like in a wedding soup.  Great way to use use more chicken!!

This is my fifth time making this soup and every time I love love love it! I follow the recipe exact except that I might not measure (just eye ball) and I use all chicken stock instead of water. This time I made it for my bible study group and everyone just went crazy over it...no one realizes how awesome parsnips are and this soup gives them a chance to show off :) Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

This soup was a hit last night. Had some ground turkey that I needed to use, and this fit the bill. Didn't have parsnips and added more spices and bowtie pasta. A keeper!

If you are a Costco Member, you must try their frozen chicken meatballs with sundried tomatoes, basil & provalone!  This eliminates a big step if you are making this soup after a long day at work. Bake the meatballs while you are prepping the soup & throw them in. Wonderful flavor.

This was a good recipe. The flavor was very delicate, some may say bland. The meatballs, however, were definitely bland. I think using leftover roasted chicken would be better. I also increased the salt added to the broth to 1t. I would try this again but with roasted chicken and I may add more herbs and spices.

YUM! I cooked this for my boyfriend when he wasn't feeling well and we both loved it! I didn't have any celery or parsnip in the house, so I substituted peas and collard greens. The soup was still fantastic! Next time, I will use the celery and parsnip.

Delicious! This is some of the best soup I have ever made. I worried about the parsnips but needn't have. It was delicious! I'm making it again tonight for dinner.

Delicious!  I sautéed the onion and garlic in butter, added half to the meatball mixture, then the other half to the broth.  I also added a bit of chopped up kale just because I had it on hand and love it in soups.  Used up leftover cooked vegetables. so I didn't have to cut up any fresh.  Added a package of egg noodles and let them cook in the broth.  I will be making this again and again.

I made just the meatballs in order to serve them in teriyaki sauce. They came out terrifically! I used fresh whole wheat bread, which I ground in my food processor, for the breadcrumbs.  The meatballs didn't fall apart when baked, and they were moist with a good consistency. This is a great base-meatball recipe.

This soup deserves a 5 star rating made exactly the way it reads. However, my family eats low carb and therefore I replaced the parsnips with diced zucchini. The taste is not changed at all and the texture ends up the same.  There is not much seasoning in this soup and, as stated, it tastes great anyway, but next time I added a little Italian seasoning for my husband, who prefers things heavily seasoned, and it made it even better. Of course, we sprinkle parmesan on top of all our soups as a given. Just a matter of preference on seasoning...but a wonderful soup that I will make regularly.

I cut the recipes in half for the amount of servings I needed.  I did not use parsnips but I did add a few mushrooms.  I also gave it a little color by adding some corn.  I loved it and am about to make it again.

This soup was great. I did make a few changes though. For the meatballs: 2T bread crumbs, 2T parmesan cheese, 1t each of oregano, garlic and onion powder, 1/4t each of salt and pepper.  I just dropped them in the soup and let them simmer for 20 minutes. The only other change is I subbed spinach for the parsnips and served over cous cous. Definitely a keeper!

I was looking for a soup recipe with parsnips (because I like parsnips) that my kids might like, and I found it.  I used ground beef instead of chicken, but thought the meatballs were a bit lacking in taste.  Next time I will add parmesan cheese to the meatballs.

I made this almost as written. Instead of the 4 cups water, I added 8 cups chicken broth. I like my soup a little thinner. Plus I separately cooked alphabet pasta and added as much as each of us wanted per bowl. Made a sick little girl happy!

I changed a few things to match what is ready in my garden and what was in my cupboards, but it was DELICIOUS.  Parsnips aren't ready so I used potato.  I used a larger quantity of homemade sourdough breadcrumbs mixed with lots of fresh basil and oregano, along with salt and pepper in ground dark chicken and turned the meatballs during baking to brown evenly.  I used homemade canned chicken broth with chicken breast chunks in it mixed with some frozen homemade turkey broth and I added a bit more salt and pepper to the broth along with three-four TBSP fresh lemon juice.  I give it a 4.5 and I will definitely make it again.  Tomorrow night I'm going to shred some gorgeous cabbage and just barely wilt it in the soup for seconds.  Thank you for the recipe.

I mixed a little green onion into the meat mix.  Other than that,  the recipe works.  I have made it  a few times, and I'm not a great cook, and it gets rave reviews.  I do like to add a squirt of sriracha into a cup.  Brings it alive!

This was very good...  I served mine over egg noodles.  Next time I will make my meatballs a little smaller though--I guess I got lazy as I was rolling them because they got bigger and bigger!

This was a really yummy recipe.  I followed the recipe except I did add some small egg noodles.  I don't usually eat parsnips but its always good to try new things and they tasted fine in this soup.  I would make this again for sure.

I did not like this as much as other meatball soups that I have found on this site.
