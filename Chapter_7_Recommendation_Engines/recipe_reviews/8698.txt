We really liked this dish (even my 13 month old!) I modified this recipe a bit.  Instead of veg. oil, I used peanut oil (it's all about flavor!) I started by stir-frying garlic (I think stir-frying ginger with the garlic would be a good idea too). As everything was stir-frying together, I added 2 TBS rice vinegar, 4 TBS Curry powder,and 1 tsp. of sugar.  I also used brocolli, carrots, and water chestnuts.

I thought this was pretty tasty-except for the amount of oil used-10 tablespoons! I cut it down to about 3-1 tbsp canola oil to cook the chicken, then 1 tbsp to stir fry the veggies. I didn't add a full tbsp of the sesame oil-I feel it's not really needed since it's pretty flavorful. I also would have added a clove or two of garlic and another tsp or so of curry.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and it was a hit. I found it to be a little oily for me, but I would make it again. Nice soft flavor.

This was very tasty but a bit too oily for my liking. I would definately make this again as it was a hit, but would probably cut down on the amount of butter and oil used. A bit more curry powder wouldn't hurt either. But on the whole, very good.

Pretty good! Used just enough canola oil to saute chicken and onions/peppers and at the end I added only 2 tablespoons of sesame oil. Didnt have any green onion so I only used red. Pleasantly surprised by how tasty and easy it was to make.

My boyfriend loved this but I didn't care for it.  I thought the peanut oil was too overpowering.  It wasn't anything like cashew chicken at a chinese restaurant and he agreed that he likes that kind better.  But he ate all of it!

I agree with the other reviews, it was tasty but too greasy.  My husband thought it was good, but didn't think it tasted like cashew chicken should.

This was ok at best. It would be good for older children - a little spice but not a lot. I doctored this up with soy and siracha. I served with sweet and sour cucumbers. I also found it too oily for my liking even reduced in amount....

Loving what I've had at restaurants, I was excited to try my hand at making at home.  Although it was good - it didn't quite fit the bill.  I felt that it was spicy for the sake of being spicy - not for the fullness of flavor.  I'm not sure what it was lacking - but I even added a bit of soy sauce - and still it seemed to be missing something.

It was really good and simple (which I love), but we had to modify it to give it some flavour.  I added snow peas and bok choy.  I didn't have cashews so added sesame seeds.  It was tasty, but still needed some flavour so we doubled the curry powder and added a tablespoon of almond butter and after that, it was perfect!

I have made this dish twice.  It is so good.  I added extra vegetables, whatever I have in the house.  First time added broccoli, coli-flower and water chestnuts.  This time I only did broccoli, yellow peppers and red onion.  Over white jasmine rice it is delicious. My 13 year old said it is the best dish she has ever had.

Reduced total oil to 2 tbsp sesame oil, added one can coconut milk and green peas.  Will definitely add this to our repertoire.

This was too bland made as described, but we added some red pepper flakes and soy sauce, right on our plates, and that improved it.

Love this recipe...sooo good.  I added the curry earlier than directed and also added some tumeric while the chicken was cooking.  I also added a tablespoon of peanut butter towards the end when chicken and cashews were added back in.

I like the chicken with cashews, however, since I'm not able to eat red or green peppers I use celery which comes out very good

Very good, and simple.  It's not quite the same as the Cashew Chicken we've had in restaurants, but it's good.  I used a table spoon of curry.  I just read that it's to be a teaspoon, I thought it was a bit strong on the curry. :P  Opps.

This is an easy and fabulous dish.  My whole family loved it.  I did eliminate the oil at the end, as others said it was too oily.  I only used three tablespoons for sauteeing the chicken.  It was perfect.  I served it with couscous.

Very good!!!  I didn't have cashews, so I used almonds and used 2 cloves of garlic (just because I am a garlic junkie!)...EXCELLENT! Definitely will make again...somehow between me, my boyfriend, and my daughter we wiped out the entire meal...my son was at band practice and had to heat up spaghetti-o's! His loss!

Tried Oct 12/08...too much fat,not very flavourful
