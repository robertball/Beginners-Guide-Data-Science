So so good! I've made a few different turmeric milk recipes and this is my favorite! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. Love the little kick from the black pepper. I used cow's milk and opted to use the ghee. Instead of grating the ginger, I just finely minced it since it gets strained out anyway. A winner!

I made this with the following changes. 
No glee (or any oil), ginger from the squeeze bottle. (I didn't need to strain it.)
Stevia instead of honey..
I really liked it!
