When I make this, I use homemade irish cream. Try this with Whipped Vodka--it's sweet but totally the best martini you'll ever have. Trust me.

I had two friends over for a "martini sampling night." My husband mis-read this and first made it with kahula instead of the shot of espresso and we all loved it like that. Then he made it with the espresso and we all thought it was way too overpowering.

Was fairly good, but for the calories I think I had too high expectations.
