Nice take on grilled cheese! Not sure if I'd call it "gourmet", but it definitely takes regular grilled cheese to a new level. I used reduced fat cream cheese and Hellman's light mayo along with just a bit of garlic vs. garlic salt. I added a couple of slices of tomato which took it over the top! Perfect with a bowl of hot soup!

I just got finished eating this sandwhich.  I followed the recipe to the T.  It was fabulous!  I make all the recipes just like they are written the first time.  This way I can say if it's a good recipe or not.  

If I start changing it won't even be the same recipe.  So...I thought it was excellent just how it was.  Salty but not as bad as other reviewers make it seem.  Rich but not too rich. 

 After I made it the recipe way the first time, I added fresh sliced tomatoes the second.  It was just wonderful!  I don't think I can go back to eating regular grilled cheese sandwhiches after this!

I just made this again.  I used garlic powder instead of salt and that made all the difference in the world.  The sandwich doesn't need the extra salt.  I also skipped the mayo like I did the first time.  
I've been making this with plain white bread and it works fine although I'm sure french bread or some other bread like foccacia would be awesome.
A tip I have when making grilled cheese sandwiches of any kind is to use partially or completely frozen bread.  The bread will hold together better and you won't break it when you slather on the margarine or butter.  It doesn't add to the cooking time and you end up with a nicer looking sandwich!

When I put these on the table for lunch my husband looked at me like I was insane.  He then took a bit and loved it.  The cheese is gooey and a little tangy.  I forgot to buy the colby-jack so I used shredded cheddar and they were great.  Also, because my husband is convince a meal without meat is only a snack I added some sliced deli ham.  The ham makes it a little more difficult to eat the sandwiches as they tend to slide apart.  I also added a little fresh cracked pepper and dried dill weed to mine.  I will make these again for sure.  They are very filling, fast and easy to make.  Thanks Sarah for a great weekend lunch recipe that is not boring.

Delicious starting point!  I had a bunch of french sub rolls to use, so I made the cheese spread and put it inside my split roll.  Then I baked at 375 for 10 minutes (until the cheese was melted).  Didn't use the butter.  I didn't measure anything, but I used a lot less mayo (light mayo), light cream cheese, and Tillamook sharp cheddar.  I also used two whole garlic cloves, and mixed up everything in my food processor.  It was so yummy!

This was a good change from a normal grilled cheese. However, it calls for WAY TOO MUCH mayo! Next time I would use half or maybe even a quarter of the amount and add more cheese. Aside from that, the flavor is yummy!

I followed the advice of the other posters and cut the mayo. I too added mozzarella instaed of the colby/jack combo I believe this recipe called for. Everyone in the house LOVED this recipe. All the kids raved and so did my husband. A rare accomplishment here at my house of seven.

TASTY!  I put some thinly sliced tomatoes on the cheese mixture, and I cut the mayo to 1/4 cup.  I had to use taco seasoned colby-jack cheese because that's all I had (which I thought would make it taste gross, but it didn't) YUM, I will make this again & maybe add some salami.  Thanks Sarah!

I'm sorry, but we didn't like this one. I cut down on the mayo to 1/2 c. and the garlic salt to 1/4 tsp. and it was still WAY too rich and way to salty! After a couple of bites it went in the garbage can.

Wow!  This was really rich!  I think it was maybe a bit much mayo and salt.  Maybe if I used less of the mixture on the bread it would not have been so rich.  The bread browned too quickly even on low not giving the cheese time to melt.  I think it would have been good if I just adjusted it more to our taste.  My hubby had the same review..neither of us could finish the sandwich!  I'll try again once more..with the adjustments!

My husband loved, loved, loved this sandwich.  I too added garlic powder instead of salt and also included some bacon. I really didn't measure out any ingredients just eyeballed it. I definatley didn't use a whole package of cream cheese but used equal amts of cream cheese and cheddar cheese. Was waaaay yummy! Thanks for making the ordinary EXTRAordinary.

Just tried this tonight after someone recommended it. It was way too cheesy and garlicky.  No one liked it.  That is myself- my 9 yr old daughter and 7 yr old son.  We will be going back to regular grilled cheese next time.

We all liked these a lot and they're a nice change from regular grilled cheese.  If you don't like the taste of garlic go easy on the garlic salt.  We like garlic and really enjoyed the extra tang.  Will definitely make again.  I had to make a change with the cheese just because I didn't have Colby Jack.  I used 2/3 c cheddar and 1/3 c montery jack.

I made this as a hot appetizer at my last party - a big hit, very rich but so good!  I added bacon to some of the appetizers - even better!

I love a nice grilled cheese sandwich with some tomato soup for lunch during the colder months, but wanted something more than the same old tired slice of cheese between bread slices. This is a pretty good sandwich. While I wouldn't say it's really gourmet (which I am actually glad for as some of the gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches I've seen don't sound very good), it is pretty tasty. I reconfigured the serving size to one as I was just making it for myself. Then I made it once as written-it was good but I thought needed some tweaking. So the next time I switched it up to my own preferences. I used the amount of mayo and cream cheese called for, but doubled the shredded cheese as I thought it needed less sauce and more cheese. It made enough of the mix for 3 sandwiches even though I had reduced the servings to one, which meant I had grilled cheese three days in a row-not a problem for me. I also used a little less than the recipe called for of plain garlic powder as there is plenty of salt already in the other ingredients. I
chopped up some tomatoes and added them, I used several of my favorite cheeses instead of just the colby and I used a really nice sliced sourdough sandwich bread, then cooked it on my cuisinart griddler so it would cook on both sides at once. I think using a griddle of that type makes a much nicer sandwich. Overall, it's a nice change from plain grilled cheese.

I gave this a 3 because there is WAY to much mayo. This is a 5 if you use about 1/4 cup mayo, 4oz cream cheese and granulated garlic. I used chedder cheese because that is all I had also I used fresh baked italian bread. Yummy! Left overs are great is you mound spread on some party rye and toast in the oven until the cheese is melted.

I thought this was an awesome grilled cheese sandwich. I loved the garlic salt that was added. I will admit I made one sandwich and just estimated the ingredients. I also added sliced tomato from my garden. Two Thumbs Up!

This is my new favorite sandwich! I am a teacher and have been off for summer break and have eaten this just about everyday for lunch! It makes a lot, so I cut the recipe in half. You don't need to spread tons of the mixture on your bread because it is rich, but sooooo good! I also don't use as much mayo as the recipe calls for. I only use about 4 to 5 tablespoons. Other than the mayo I follow the recipe exactly. Wonderful sandwich! Thanks so much for sharing!

Following the recommendations of other reviewers, I modified this recipe as follows: reduced mayo to 1/2 cup and swapped 1 tsp garlic powder for the garlic salt.  I did away with the butter and replaced the sliced bread with what our deli calls a "mini loaf" of French or whole grain Italian bread.  Just slathered everything on the open loaf along with sliced tomatoes and sliced ham, closed the loaf and baked for 10 minutes at 350-degrees.  The bread came out wonderfully crusty and sliced nicely to make individual sandwiches without the mess of grilling.

Outstanding recipe. Would also work as a "cheesebread" appetizer or side dish if you used a small loaf of French bread. Delicious overall.

Good, but so rich it's almost too much. To cut calories, I used lite mayo and Neufchâtel cheese - and WAY less than the recipe calls for - and I used a squirt of butter-flavored Pam to grease the skillet. I liked this much more with some sliced tomato. Thanks.

I had a similar sandwich at a bed & breakfast but could never find the recipe. This is soo good! One hint: Let your cream cheese sit out to soften.

I was planning to make grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch and I looked on this website to see if I could find something a little more exciting and found this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half for only two sandwiches and used neufchatel cheese for less fat along with LF mayo (only 1 T for both) and 2% cheddar.  We enjoyed the richness added by the cream cheese but did not care for the mayo.  Next time, I will leave that out completely.

This is a very rich sandwich, but very good.  I made minor adjustments to the amounts of the ingredients.  (Honestly, I didn't measure...just added until it looked right to me.)  Due to the richness, my husband and I cut one sandwich in half and shared it with our soup.  We discussed the addition of finely diced ham, tomato, onion, even roast beef.  I think that it is too heavy for most of our simple meals, but may make an excellent addition to my appetizer list for parties.

Meh, not impressed. I thought it was too mushy in the middle. I tried two bites to give this a fair chance, but I didn't like it. Sorry it just isn't my thing.

I left out th mayo (kids don't really care for it). I took the crust off my bread and flattened the bread slices out... spread the cream cheese mixture on the flattened bread slice and rolled them up. I toasted them sead side down.

It was good, but I made a few variations.  I used tomato and basil and mozzarella cheese.  I kept the garlic salt and the mayo, but I'll definitely try it next time with very little if any mayo- I don't think it really adds too much, other than calories.

This recipe is really good, but mixed as called for - which I did for only 1 serving - produces a mix that is excessive in mayo taste, is too salty for my palate and not super easy to combine the ingredients.  I then reviewed other comments and made a note of their suggestions noted by (+) and added my own perspective noted by {^} and redid it. I reduced the mayo by half (+), heated up the cheese mixture a bit for ease of mixing (+), swapped out garlic salt for garlic powder (+), reduced the garlic powder by 1/3 {^}, and finally added 1 & 1/2 Tbsp of ranch dressing {^}.  The end result worked for us and was a definite keeper. I am very glad the original recipe was here to allow me something to make and feed my family that they could enjoy so easily. My wife and two sons (who all only tolerate grilled cheese) actually had no problem eating this item.  Happy cooking.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut the mayo down to 1/2 c and it worked just fine.  We also didn't have any garlic salt on hand, so I used some Mrs Dash and a bit of garlic powder -- gave it just the right flavor.  We'll definitely be making this again.

Today is the second time I've made this, and the second time we've loved it. I doubled the recipe and I'm leaving the cheese mix in the fridge so that this week, which is so busy for my family, we can quick throw together a sandwich and put it on the griddle. Delicious and easy... thanks!

[[UPDATE - May 08 - Ha, I am so obsessed with this recipe. Listen, you DON'T have to follow this recipe to a T. I left out the mayo, smell/tasted the garlic powder in the cream cheese, and used as much of the cheese that I wanted. That's what's great about this. You can make this sandwich just as quickly as you can make a regular grilled cheese but it's way better!]]
[[Update - Jan 08 - I've been messing around w/ the cream cheese spread from this recipe. I added about a Tspoon of the spread to a personal pesto bowl I was making myself for dinner. The pesto w/the garlicy, creamy, spread created an entirely new pasta sauce altogether. I also use this spread in wraps now, with grilled chicken AND the pesto.]]
im never going back to regular grilled cheese!
i kinda eyed the measurments but the sandwich still came out great! i made a bowl of tomato soup instead of adding tomatoes and lets just say i've discovered my new favorite lunch menu.
very tasty, love it.

Had to tweak this quite a bit, per other reviews, but the overall idea is good and the sandwich was really yummy.  To make this for myself I used 1 T fat free mayo, 1/2 oz fat free sharp cheddar cheese, and 1 oz fat free cream cheese, and it made a generous amount of filling for regular bread slices.  The recipe calls for way to much of everything.  I did use the garlic salt and my husband liked it that way.  Thanks for the "fancy" idea!

This was so yummy.  I did change a bit though.  I followed the advice of others, and cut back on the mayo.  Also, I used marble cheese and parmesan cheese, because that's what I had on hand.  I also omitted the garlic salt as I don't like to add extra salt to food, but that's just my personal taste.  This is a great recipe that you can alter to your personal taste.  Fancy it up for company or have it as a family lunch.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this tonight with Tim Perry’s soup from here.  I used sourdough bread, half the amount of mayo and added 1/4 tsp of rouge pimento to the cheese blend. I had some provolone and American to use up so I added a slice of each too.   I though the cheese-mayo mixture was great.  It made for a super gooey sandwich.   I we liked it for a fancy change.

Followed reviewers suggestions to reduce the mayonnaise to 1/4 cup, but used the full 3 oz of cream cheese.   Darn, I really regret that.  I didn't care for the mushy taste of cream cheese.  On the plus side the leftovers can be salvaged as a cold cheese spread for crackers. Wouldn't make again.

Oh my, this was so good! I made them twice. I did not have shredded Colby-Monterey Jack but I did have slices, so I used a slice per sandwich and used shredded Mozzarella in the mixture. Came out fine. The first time I made this, I used thick cut day old french bread. The second time, I had left over french bread cut for french toast. Both times it was fabulous! Oh and if u like tomatoes, add a thin slice or dice some and throw them on top of the cheese. Mmmm...

Great sandwich all in all, just finished eating. Only thing I would tweak is to cut down on the mayo, seemed too heavy. I did use Miracle Whip however instead of Hellmans so that might have affected it.

Great recipe and "Ohhhh-so-yummy". I cut back on the mayo and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (as other suggested). Everyone loved it! Only thing was we had lots of extra cheese spread leftover. I believe this recipe yields more servings than suggested. But that's ok, because it went great on toast tossed in toaster oven and/or as a cold cracker spread. Thanks for sharing this one!

I thought these were really great. I would reduce the mayo and garlic salt just a bit, but that's just my opinion. I added a few slices of turkey breast right before the sandwiches were done. Yummy!

Great sandwich.  A twist from the traditional grilled cheese.  Wouldn't make it a constant menu item though for health reasons.  Only do for a speacial indulgence.  Also great if you add shaved ham and grill as normal.  I like to fry my ham up first before I put it on the sandwich to grill.  Thanks for the recipe.  Lots of ways to enjoy this one.

I appologize but I have to say I'm not a big fan of this one.  I think maybe the reviewer who said more cheese half everything else has hit the nail on the head.  I'm not a big fan of mayonase though, it was just too overwhelming for me.  However, my boyfriend (who loves mayo) thought this was amazing!  I do like the idea of grilled cheese on French bread though.  Thank you for sharing.

It was OK.  Probably a bit more cream cheese and garlic salt for my liking. I'll try it again and reduce those ingredients and add a sharper cheese other than Colby.

If I try this again, I'll use less filling for each sandwich.  It was very, very rich and I even used FF mayo and lite cream cheese.

Not a good sandwich. I cut the mayo more than in half like other reviewers suggested. It was just WAAAAYYY to rich for a sandwich. 

I have a suggestion though. Because the recipe sounded so good for the sandwiches, I mixed up extra thinking that this would be something yummy for lunches during the week. When none of us liked it I was upset about the wasted ingredients. I decided to add a little chopped green onion to it and it's a delicious cracker spread!! Try it for a cracker spread...skip the sandwiches!

I love this recipe. However, I did not use the mayo either. My girls and husband loved it. Definitely rich, so I made it again using just the Jack cheese, no Colby and it was even better that way. I highly recommend this one though! Excellent flavor.

Absolutely delicious but so rich need only half with maybe some fruit or tomato soup to cut it. (Reminds me of a delicious pimento cheese sandwich I had at a Texas swap meet called Warington days or something)Anyways I used extra sharp cheddar cuz it’s all I had, garlic powder and cayenne powder. No extra salt needed at all. I used salted butter to fry it though cuz all I had.

I made this as the recipe called for, and it was delicious.  The cheese mixture reminded me of pimento in a way.  I made one addition...once I had spread the cheese mixture on the slice of bread I added 1 Tbsp of blueberry preserves, swirling it into the cheese mixture (all I had in the fridge, am going to try it with apricot preserves next).  I made one change...I used sliced Italian bread instead of French bread.  This is a wonderful delectable grilled cheese!

I misread the recipe and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I’m glad I did though, as I think it would have been too salty with garlic salt.   This sandwich was rich, decadent, ooey-gooey, melty comfort food.   It’s fantastic when made with sourdough bread.  And turns out absolutely amazing in the panini press!   I can think of many additions to add variety from time to time:  adding jalapeños...or sautéed mushrooms... adding bacon... or maybe a slice of pastrami... I think I’ll be enjoying this recipe - or variations of it - on a regular basis!

Like most other folks here we cut down on the mayonnaise. We also added some fresh tomatoes and sweet onions to the mixture and used some fresh bakery French bread loaf sliced thick (like Texas toast slices. Turned out great. Lots of possibilities for adding other ingredients as well so we will continue to experiment with this recipe.

This was wonderful the only issue i had was too salty. Next time i think i will use garlic powder, 1/4 of the garlic salt or just a clove of minced garlic.  Otherwise i added tomato slices and it was very good.  Bring a napkin

I have warmed cream cheese for bagels and loved the creaminess of eating it warm versus cold, but  I would probably skip the mayo mix to blend the cheese together.

I made it with sour dough bread with whipped cream cheese without maynaise, sprinkled garlic powder on cream cheese then put sliced black olives over the cream cheese.  I put butter on the outside of the sandwich slices and grilled... YUMMO!!  I ate it with tomatoe soup.  I guess I didn't really make it at all?? haha

Delicious. The only change I made was I had no garlic salt and I used minced garlic to taste. I had enough filling left over to make an extra sandwich. For some reason, this is the first time I have made a grilled cheese sandwich that was cooked to perfection. The bread was not soggy, it didn't burn. I found that this sandwich makes a perfectly cooked sandwich and I will use this from now on.

This was pretty good, but there was way too much filling, which could be  remedied by cutting the mayo in half and the cream cheese inhalf also. This would make it cheesier and also easier to eat and cut.It was nice to try something different with our tomato soup, though. Thanks!

Had to up with something quick, since the weather kept us from going to a super bowl party. Made this, but added some imitation crab meat. Awesome!!

I was looking for a grilled cheese sandwich to go with the tomato/basil soup I was making. This sounded good.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used less mayo as others suggested, but ended up putting mayo on my sandwich before I grillled it.  It wasn't to die for, but it certainly was better than a gooey, cheesy typical grilled cheese sandwich.

This really does mix up a usual plain grilled cheese. I just made a 'single' serve version. Spread the cream cheese on honey white bread, then some mayo, sprinkled on the garlic powder (not salt, knew I wouldn't want it that salty) then shredded sharp cheddar, then I had some Munster cheese I added to hold the shredded cheese and everything together. Out of ham unfortunately. But it was pretty good! Next time I may try adding some herbs.

YUM! I only made one sandwich and just eyeballed everything, replacing the garlic salt for garilc powder. I only had italian-style sliced bread on hand, so I just used that. Also, I used whipped cream cheese for easier spreading. This was super tasty! My little guy loved it as well. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

wow, Wow, WOW.....these were amazing!! i don't measure anything, i just use what i think looks good and i don't use the mayo. i heat up the cream cheese and shredded cheese and it spreads much easier. i did add a little romano cheese to the mix and also sprinkled some on the butter on the outside. i love cheese so i even a slice of colby cheese on top of the mix. sooo yummy!! i have made these twice this week.

This recipe helped inspire another sandwich idea using ciabatta rolls, no mayo, more cheeses (of various types), and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, baked at 375 for approximately 10 minutes (as someone else suggested). Came out very good last time this way and tonight I intend to try a ham and Swiss variation on ciabatta.

This is a very unique grilled cheese recipe and very tasty! I would adjust the proportions slightly by adding a little less mayo and salt with a little more cheese. Next time I might add some deli turkey as well. Otherwise, it's perfect!

I'm sorry, we did not like this.  I felt like I was eating a hot mayo sandwich.  I got no other flavor except garlic and mayo.  My boyfriend and I took 2 bites, couldn't finish them and ordered a pizza last night.

Good.  Different twist on a grilled cheese.  Made with ham and tomatoes and cut back on the mayo.  Whole family liked, very rich, don't need to spread a lot on the bread!

Wow, these rocked. I didnt measure anything but just went by my gut as far as the amounts as I was only making two sandwiches. I put garlic powder in the mix as well as on the outside of the bread and also sprinkled some oregeno on the outside of the bread too to give it a bit of an Italian kick. Was so great!

This was tasty. I actually used some extra filling from the "mouth-watering stuffed mushrooms" (which is cream cheese, parmesan, garlic, and onion) for the cream cheese. Added the cheddar and just spread the mayo on the bread. It was pretty rich, but good.

This recipe is a great change from traditional grilled cheese.  I did take the advice of some reviews.  I only used 1/4 c. of mayo and  used garlic powder instad of garlic salt.  What's great about this recipe is that you can refrigerate the rest and have the next day.

This is super!  I ended up making two for myself. Much more flavorful than plain grilled cheese.  A side of sliced dill pickles and I was in Heaven.  Thanks!

Thought these were really good.  A nice creamy rich filling was a nice change for a grilled cheese.  Even the kids liked it.  I did cut back on the mayo as others suggested and I used cheddar cheese because that's what I had.   Thanks for a new twist on an old favorite!

These are so good!  Definitely rich, but well worth the calories if you're willing to spring for it.  I add in a little extra cheese on the sandwich when grilling and save the leftovers in a little container for instant sandwiches through the week.

This was much better than I expected. I enjoyed it. I only made one sandwich and because of other reviews I cut the amount of mayo in half. I didn't have garlic salt so I left that out. Also I used a mix of shredded Jack cheese and shredded cheddar cheese. It came out good. You can really taste the cream cheese and mayonnaise. I liked this one.

We found this recipe to be too rich. Even w/o the mayo, I don’t think I’ll be cooking it again. All of the ingredients are things I like, but apparently not all of them together. 

However, it was easy to make, and w/a few modifications would be a favorite!
