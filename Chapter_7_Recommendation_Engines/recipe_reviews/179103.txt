I really enjoyed this dish.  I think that the only thing I would have done different would be to add a little more sauce.  I seasoned my beef with oregano, basil and onion.  It was wonderful!!!!  I loved the zucchini. It was a great touch.

Wow. This is a really good pasta dish that seems to be an in between of lasagna and spaghetti. The cheese tomato sauce tastes great. I have made this a few times and I always double the amount of vegetable. You can add mushrooms, olives, squash if you like. Just saute them in with the meat. Great as a company dish and easy to make.

a great starting recipe.  I figured on it being a bit bland from the reviews so I added some basil, oregano, black pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper, and 2 more cloves garlic.  Used a lb of hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  It turned out excellent.  The cheeses really balanced the spices very well.  My husband actually said I could have added more cayenne pepper (he likes spicy food).  I thought it was great as is and mild enough for our kids to eat it without a struggle.

This recipe just didn't live up to it's rating. I added some chopped onion to the skillet when cooking the meat & garlic & added a little Italian spice mix, but other than that made it as written. There was just something missing in this recipe, but I couldn't figure out what it needed. We probably won't have this one again.

I thought this recipe was easy and delicious! I cut the zucchini in half, sliced, and cut again in half. I preferred the bite sized pieces.

I only had a few of the ingredients on hand so i went with what I had and it turned out pretty good. i did the ground beef with sauted onions and garlic then added plain tomato sauce, penne, ricotta cheese and seasoned it up with sugar, basil, salt and Tony's. Kid's ate it up! I didn't even bake it!

This is good if you skip the prego and make a good tomato sauce. Ground turkey works well with this.

SO easy! Hubby LOVED it. I added chopped onion to the minced garlic. I upped the garlic and the cheese (after all, is there such a thing as too much cheese?). Didn't have a casserole this size so I used a 9x13" baking pan.

I made this casserole for my cooking 4-H project and i got a top blue at the county fair! I did add some Italian seasoning and some onions though. Also, I used Kroger marinara sauce and it still tasted great.

Wonderful!!  I do add more sauce but that is the only change I make.  I usally double the recipe (using 3 jars of sauce--1 1/2 per pan) and make one for my family and one for a neighbor.  Get dish when you need to take a meal to a friend.

OMG! This is awesome. I followed the recipe to a T, but did add a bit more cheese than recommended (parmesan, mozzarella, cheddar, and jack) and this pasta was wonderful. Next time I make it I will add some italian sausage mixed in with the ground beef.

This was really good! Thanks for sharing. I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand. Used a minced onion instead of zucchini and sauteed with garlic and olive oil. Browned beef and added a large can of whole tomatoes (roughly chopped). Drained off excess liquid from pan. Then I added ricotta and half of mozzarella. Added 32 oz. of my favorite sauce and mixed in cooked pasta. I added a bit of dried oregano, parsley, basil, garlic salt and onion powder to give it some color and flavor. Lastly I topped with remaining cheese and parmesan. Made a HUGE batch! YUM!!!

I don't know where I went wrong with this recipe.  It didn't look like it had enough sauce, so I added more (2 times as much as needed).  However after baking it didn't matter.  It was VERY dry.  I did add the onion for more flavor.  I may try it again, but add my even MORE sauce.  Although I had a TON of leftovers.  And the flavor was good.

I'm going to give it a 3. I thought that it was good. I liked all the different cheese's. But next time I make it, it definitely needs MORE pasta sauce. Other than that it was good.

This is a must have for any family recipe box!  Super yummy, my whole family loved it.  I used 1/2 lb beef & 1/2 lb italian sausage.  I also served the parmesan knots (from this site) with dinner and it couldn't have been any better!  Oh yeah, I also used a 9 X 13 inch pan and it fit perfectly.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

We made this tonight for dinner and all loved it. My husband, 3.5 and 1.5 year old. I added Italian Seasonings and an extra cup of sauce before baking and then my husband and I added hot peppers and a garlic/pepper seasoning to our serving This tastes like lasagna but it is much faster to make!

Great casserole-- Alterations- I layered it like lasagna instead of mixing together.  Split meat as 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 sliced sweet Italian sausage.  Layered in dish as some sauce, meats, 1/2 pasta, ricotta, parm, more sauce, 1/2 pasta, zucchini spears, more sauce, and top with parm.  LOVED IT!!

For the first time making this, I was going to stick pretty much to the recipe, but then the hubby (who works the stove because I have trouble doing so while pregnant) started throwing spices in and we kind of drifted off the tracks.  But!  It's a good recipe, although it was even better tweaked.

In case anyone is interested.  We added some marjoram leaves to the ground beef while it was browning, seasoned the zucchini with lemon juice, salt, and pepper, used Prego's garlic and seasoning sauce, and changed up the cheese quite a bit.  For the standard six serving recipe, we used an entire cup of freshly grated parmesean cheese, with half being used for topping.  We doubled the mozzarella and the ricotta, with the latter giving it a really creamy taste that made up for any lack of sauce.

Hubby wants to try mushrooms in it, and I want to try Italian sausage instead of ground beef, so it's definitely a keeper recipe.  I only gave it four stars because we did tweak it, so we didn't actually have the true recipe.

I added 1 lb hot sausage, also with both sauces. You might want to add garlic powder and Italian seasonings. Possibly some fresh sliced mushrooms.

My family now says this is on their favorites list. That means a lot from the 6 & 8 yr old. I used an extra 1/2 can of ragu, added a chopped onion when browning the meat & did 1/2 beef and 1/2 sausage due to different recommendations & it was perfect!

this was a huge hit! i made a few revisions based on the other feedback. I added mushrooms and wayyyyy more shredded cheese to suit our taste. My brother hates zucchini and mushrooms and still loves this the kids loved it too. Best part we had leftovers for a couple days ( i used a full lb of each of the meats) and it was even better reheated.

Great recipe.  Made my zucchini larger slices since my kids don't like zucchini and it was easy to pick out.  Also added more sauce so it wasn't so dry.
