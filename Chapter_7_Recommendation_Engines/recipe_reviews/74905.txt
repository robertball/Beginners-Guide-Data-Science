I made this in the crock pot and it was great!  I used the exact measurements in the recipe and it was really good, but you could cut the bacon by half and it would still be fine I think.

I made this for Thanksgiving, with about two pounds of green beans and a half pound of bacon, a little heavy on fresh pepper and the onion and garlic it called for.  The best compliment I can give it -- and got -- was that a fellow-guest, whom I didn't realize was from Louisiana, took a bite before I'd told her what, exactly I'd made, closed her eyes, sat back in her chair and then looked straight at me.

"You got this EXACTLY right," she said.

I'd taken her home and neither of us had thought of it before that first bite.

Definitely a keeper -- thank you!

This is something similiar to a recipe I use but I add some diced stewed tomatoes to give it a bit of a tang.

I grew up eating this in the summer. It's so fun to sit out on the porch snapping beans. Anyway, you don't have to measure with this-just add to your liking. It's trial and error to figure out how much your family will like but you really can't go wrong with these ingredients. We never make that many beans but just a good sized pot with a whole onion, a couple garlic cloves and about 1/2 pack of sliced bacon and lots of s&p. Even if you forget the garlic it's always a great summer dish! (You may find yourself eating it out of the pot when finished.)

used a half a pound of bacon instead of the full 2 and added 3 Tb of olive oil. Cooked on low for 6 hours in the crock pot. Very good!

These are amazing! I did make a smaller batch for a family of four and they didn't take so long, maybe 45 min. This is the only way my husband and two sons will eat green beens. Great recipe! Thanks!

Thank you for showing this MN girl how to cook green beans Southern-style for her TN husband!  I've always wondered exactly how it was done, and this is the recipe for which I was looking.  I used 2 lb. of whole frozen green beans instead of fresh (since I made it in the winter and fresh weren't easily available).  I also followed previous reviewer's advice and cut the amount of bacon in half (used 12 oz. for my 2 lb. of beans) and cooked it in the crock pot once all the ingredients were together.  Yum!

This recipe is delicious and will be gobbled up before you can blink an eye.  I have made it three times.  Two of the times I have used turkey bacon to but the fat and added 2 tbls olive oil to keep it cooking. It turned out delicious.

I learned this way to cook fresh green beans from my mother, who learned it from her mother and now my grandkids are watching me make green beans this way.  We simmer them on the stovetop; have never tried the crock pot method.  (Gramma didn't have a crock pot.)  This recipe has apparently been enjoyed by many for at least a century.   I love tradition!

I have to say I was horrible at making green beans and I came across this recipe and oh my gosh.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I love them, love them, love them.  Only change was I cut down the bacon about half.

I needed to bring a side dish to Thanksgiving dinner but was tired of the same old Green Bean Casserole. This recipe inspired me! I used canned green beans since I'm not too fond of fresh, but next time I will try frozen since mine turned a bit mushy. I also added a can of golden mushroom soup (which is so much better than cream of mushroom) and I only used half a pound of bacon since I already had it left over. It tasted great, although it didn't look too appealing. I invited some friends over the next day and we served left overs and one of the husbands said, "You know, I only took a little bit to be polite because it looked kind of gross, but it is actually really good!" Next time I will try to stick closer to the original recipe, but overall the idea was great!

This is a Southern dish...never heard of it called Blackened Green Beans, though.  I make it for my husband whenever we have fresh green beans (which will be today).  We usually add new potatoes to the beans while cooking and have a terrific side dish.  It could almost be a meal it is so filling. We LOVE it!!!

I used canned green beans for this recipe.  I made this on Christmas Eve.  Put them in fairly early so they would slowly cook all day.  Turned out good!  Still missing a little something though.

My husband's very Southern Grandmother made the best green beans I ever tasted, but I never learned how she made them.  This is it!  I used 4 pounds of frozen beans (couldn't find fresh), all the bacon, and twice the onion.  I was short on time, so I didn't brown the bacon and onions and cooked it for about 3 hours.  It was wonderful--will probably be even better next time I make it exactly as written.  My three men, who usually only tolerate green beans, loved this.  Thank you, tinyant1!

I add a can of chicken broth as well for the extra flavor and it turned out great. By the way, stick to a white or yellow onion, first time I tried this was with a red onion and it was way too over powering.

Excellent recipe. I did use the crock pot. The flavor is amazing. I used 1.5 lbs bacon that I had the butcher chop for me and it was perfect.

This reminds me of my mothers green beans, you can also add potatoes (quartered or diced) to give it a different flavor. And use ham hocks instead of bacon (cook ham hocks until tender) then add the other ingredients (ham hocks, green beans & potatoes)great with roast, baked chicken, or pork chops.

This is one of the all time great southern side dishes.  I can't think of any meat it wouldn't be good with, and I have even eatten all by myself.  When I do this I cheat (cooking for one) and use a can of green beans with the amount of bacon, onion and garlic you want, oh, don't forget the pepper.

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving and it was a complete hit - none were left! I'm making it again this year.  I used half the bacon and slightly more black pepper.  I made it on the stove.

This was excellent.  Now I use all different vegetables to "blacken" them.  My husband really enjoys this!

A Thanksgiving hit all around. The kids loved making it, it looked great on the table, and everyone seemed to like it. Several second helpings, including me.
