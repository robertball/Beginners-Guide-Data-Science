Good. Add basil instead of italian seasoning as a change.

Very good.  I didn't have all the veggies so I improvised, and I totally forgot to add the cheese.  Still pretty tasty, and I had leftover filling even though I didn't have all the veggies (not sure how that happened) so I topped a regular pizza with the rest.  Yum!  thanks for the recipe!
