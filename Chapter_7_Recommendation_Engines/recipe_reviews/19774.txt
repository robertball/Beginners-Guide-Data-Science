I already make a gorgonzola salad that I prefer.  Try a spring mix or red leaf lettuce with red onion, gogonzola cheese, walnuts, balsamic vinegrate dressing and cherry tomatoes (optional).  We usually make this when we have guests because it's easy and we always get rave reviews.

This was an excellent salad.  The changes I made:  used approximately 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, increased garlic to 5 cloves (our family loves garlic), and chose to use romaine lettuce.  This was a huge hit at the dinner table.  Usually my family is not asking for seconds on salad.

When I first mixed the ingrediants, I was not impressed with the flavor.  But after adding it to the salad greens and topping it with the gorgonzola cheese.. umm.  It taste very similiar to the salad served by an upscale italian restaurant my husband and I frequently visit.  I, like others, added more garlic and extra vinegar and  reduced the salt to 3/4 teaspoon.  The only change I would have made is to maybe throw a few black olives on top.  Maybe I will try that next time.  Note:  I have made this many times so for a variation, I used the Balsamic Vinegar dressing as someone else suggested.  I like it much better with the dressing the recipe calls for.  The Gorgonzola cheese does not taste as good with the Balsamic Vinegar.

This was good.  made the dressing ahead of time, it's very similar to the dressing I usually make.  I used canola oil rather than olive oil, doubled the red wine vinegar and added about a tsp of minced onion and a tsp of sugar and used just a pinch of salt.  This was a perfect pairing with filet mignon and roasted baby red potatoes.

This is only really good if you like gorgonzola and don't mind the smell.  I added more veggies to mine, it looked bland with just lettuce.

Holy cow is this good.  I let the dressing sit in the fridge overnight.  I also put a few sundried tomatoes on top (not packed in oil... these were from a farmers market).  This has a wonderful flavor!

I made a variation of this salad, using balsamic vinegar, garlic, olive oil, no salt, and mixed greens.  It is wonderful!  The leftover dressing (either in your salad bowl, or reserved from the recipe) makes good dipping for a firm bread such as sourdough or chewey "artisan" breads you see in stores these days.

This salad is so easy and delicious! It has become one of my go-to recipes for a quick salad. I definitely use more gorgonzola than called for (cuz it's my fave!!), and throw in sun dried tomatoes (non oil packed), pine nuts and artichoke hearts. Yum!!

This was really a good quick salad. I did change things a little. I think it needed a tiny bit more vinegar, I  don't like a strong vinegar taste but this needed a little more. I also used sea salt with lavender, it really gave it a great flavor and aroma! I added pears and lavender candied pecans. Super good!
