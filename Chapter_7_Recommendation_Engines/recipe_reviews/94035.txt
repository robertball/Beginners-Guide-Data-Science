Excellent.  I followed the recipe very closely.  I only made 2 substitutions - instead of 3/4 c vegetable oil, I used 1 stick of 'i can't believe it's not butter' and 1/2 stick of real butter; and instead of walnuts I used pecans.  I had to "crush" my own pineapple, b/c I only had cans of tidbits, but the result was a similar output.  I still measured everything out to the correct proportions.  Made two very nice sized loaves.  Great sweet flavor, but not too sweet.  Feels heavy and dense, but bread is relatively light and fluffy for something of it's kind.  Brought 1 loaf to work at 8am, and by 11 it was nearly gone!  No complaints or changes!  (I'm going to have to make more of this to use up my zucchini!

This is very tasty. Both times I've baked this, I used brown sugar instead of white and left out the raisins. I also shred the zucchini instead of chopping it and squeeze the excess liquid out. The first time I used pecans instead of walnuts. I also make one loaf and the rest as muffins. I think I actually liked the muffins better. I really like the taste and texture of the pineapple mixed in.

I can only give this 4 stars because I changed it so much--it was still wonderful.  My changes--substituted applesauce for half the oil; reduced sugar by 1/2 cup; omitted nuts and nutmeg and upped the cinnamon; used half KA white whole wheat flour.  Still very moist and flavorful and plenty sweet.  Great with cream cheese.  Thanks Christine.

The bread was moist, delicious full of flavor and would make a great addition to the Yule recipes. Next time you could replace the raisins with dates, dried cranberries, or apricots.

I decided to give this quick bread a try because it calls for carrots, zucchini and pineapple! What a great combination! The bread is very moist and tasty. The only change I made was to use unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. That way I can tell myself this bread is healthy and the three slices I just inhaled count towards my daily veggie intake. Thanks for a great recipe! I will try this again only next time I want to try to make them into muffins. A keeper for sure!

My family loved this bread. I made it exactly as the recipe states. It was so moist and stayed moist. I even froze the second loaf and when I took it out it was still delicious. A definite keeper!

This was so yummy!!  I made it for some guests and they all raved about it.  It really is moist.  One suggestion - it makes a great cake if you bake it in a 9 X 13 pan.

Very tasty, but mine turned out more like carrot cake, very moist and crumbly. I left out the raisins.

This bread is delicious!!! I made it and everyone was asking for more.  I'm going to make mini's and give them as gifts.  It's a great replacement for fruitcake.

Deliciouse.  I never had buttermilk so I used a milk & vinegar substitute.  I used a bunt pan because I didn't have 2 loaf pans. (I don't remember who long I baked it for).  I was also short 1 egg and it worked fine. The kids loved it.

I just love this bread (or cake).  My family often makes it in a 9 X 13 baking pan and it makes a great, moist cake!  Sometimes I use a tad less sugar and oil and it is still really delicious.  My family and I highly recommend it!

Taste was bland, I thought it would be close to a carrot cake flavor.

I loved this recipe.  It is a little sweet so if you don't want a sweet bread cut back the sugar a little bit.  I made one loaf and the rest muffins.  The muffins are perfect.  I will do all muffins next time.  Thanks for this recipe!

I was so hopeful for this bread since it has both zuke and carrots - and pineapple too!  We've got a picky eater and I was hoping this would be one more tool in my arsenal.  The flavor is just off in these loaves though (and we followed the directions to a T).  I think to save them (I knew I should have halved the recipe the first time!) I will just brush some simple syrup on the tops and call it good.  Oh well, ya win some, ya lose some.  Thanks for the recipe!
