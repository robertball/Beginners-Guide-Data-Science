I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy and simple.  I noticed some said it was plain and others used flour instead of coconut flour. Well, it's a paleo recipe so it's designed to be made without grains. This was my 1st opportunity to use my coconut flour. I thought it was the ingredient that made the dish. It just had such a nice texture & taste. I added cayenne, as suggested by another, but didn't taste much difference. I think users could experiment with spices they think goes with coconut. My son also enjoyed the dish.

Easy to make and quick, I'd add some sort of spice to liven it up a little as the coconut flour makes it dry and bland. Of note, the amount of coconut flakes needed is really half cup not 3/4, thats just a waste. Also, you need about 2-3 heaping tablespoons of coconut oil to fry fillets to a crisp coating.

Very good!  I used more coconut oil, as needed, and a bit less coconut than the recipe calls for.  I added a heaping tablespoon of honey to the egg mixture and used salmon filets.  We all loved the dish.  Thank you for a good recipe!

Made for a paleo food swap at my gym and it got rave reviews - I'm not even a big fan of fish and I liked it quite a bit.  Added a bit of extre salt and some pepper to the batter, and definitely used more oil than noted, adding more to the pan every time I added a new piece.

Really good recipe. I ended up baking these in the oven for 25 minutes. I used rockfish fillets sprayed with coconut oil first, dipped in egg whites (cholesterol healthy), and added some home made garam masala to the coconut flour mixture to spice it up a bit. Family loved it! I served curry potatoes on the side with some mango dip and cilantro yogurt dip.

Oh dear, what a sad way to waste ingredients. Followed recipe, and struggled with coating that wouldn't stick and almost burned, even though I kept a medium heat and watched the skillet like a hawk, tucking more oil under the fish as it cooked.  I'm a good cook, and was embarrassed to serve it to my husband.  (He liked it better than me.)

Made this tonight and was not a fan. There's not much flavor to it at all. The only way I could eat this was with tartar sauce all over it. I doubt I will make this again.

Did this with both chicken and tilapia. Added a dash of cayenne to the chicken strips. We love it!

A quick, simple dish for everyday. I used white bass fillets, and I added about a teaspoon of cajun seasoning to this (per another review) to liven it up. Next time I'll use a larger coconut shred; I used the fine shred, which  soaked up the oil and disappeared into the skillet. (Make sure your oil is fairly hot.)

I loved it! Only thing is I only used 1/2 the amount of the recommended ingredients to coat it. I used the left over on salmon and though that tasted ok it was far better on the tilapia.
