The family loved this! I changed it a bit. I cooked 2 cups of pasta until firm. I mixed a 1/2 cup mayo and mixed in about 1 -1 1/2 tsp Sriracha hot sauce, 1 tsp dijon mustard, and garlic salt. When the pasta was done I poured in the mayo sauce along with 2 cups of Cheddar Cheese and montrey Jack cheese but that didn't look like enough so I added a half can of cheddar cheese soup. Then I mixed in 2  cups of ham. I carmalized 1/2 onion, 1 tsp garlic, and pepper and mixed that in with the cheese, mayo and macaroni mixture. Topped with more shredded cheese.  Then I sprinkled on the lightly browned Italian bread crumbs. It was amazing and the family loved it!!

I purchased a pile of cheese on sale that needed to get cooked up. I also had left over frozen ham from a family event – so I was looking for a ham and cheese macaroni dish. This was the simplest. I boiled the left over ham – got all useable meat off of it then boiled the noodles in the ‘ham’ water (we had rotini). Added picked off bone bits of lean ham to the rotini and mixed. Instead of using mayonnaise (didn’t have any) I heated about 2/3 cup milk – melted the cubed cheese  - used a whip utensil to blend– then added cornstarch mixed in water first I used 1 teaspoon, thickened a little more  – it seemed to need more so added another teaspoon –  it was thick and saucy. Mixed all ingredients in big bowl – put in a casserole dish – then it seemed the sauce was too thick, it looked a little dry. I did maybe a third to a half cup of milk – maybe 1 ½ oz. more cheese and a little more of the cornstarch and water – made a little more sauce a little wetter than the first batch – poured it over the casserole – had left over small amount of Monterey jack (no bread crumbson hand) – sprinkled it intermittently on the casserole – covered lightly with aluminum - baked at 325 about 30 minutes -  turned out good! I baked at 325 as I also baked a cake that was needing 325 temp - both worked out fine.

Quick and easy. You may want to lightly toast the breadcrumbs on the stove first then sprinkle over top and then bake......tastes so yummy!

We all eat with our eyes, and I was concerned that this was going to have zero eye appeal, so I added a little bit of color.  I added some peas, chopped red bell pepper, some chopped green onions, and I think in the future a few sliced olives might add not only color but flavor.  Our consensus was too much pasta, and not enough ham, but that could be a personal taste preference.  I cooked the full amount of pasta, but once I started to mix this up, I didn't use all  of it.  This rating is based on the changes that I made.

A simple mac and cheese recipe.  I added peas to the casserole for some added flavor and color.  I did not use anything even close to one cup of bread crumbs.  I just sprinkled some on top.  I think one cup would have been rather excessive.

One of my kids LOVED this!  The other didn't, but they have very different taste in foods.  It's a keeper!

Very filling and the whole family liked it!  This is a parent win.  I would not recommend eating as a left over, it is very dry the next day.

Wow!  This was sooo easy and both of my boys (9 and 13) LOVED it!  Next time I will add more ham, a couple more types of cheese and probably top with some chives and parm.  Note:I didn't measure anything except the mayo, I just eyeballed the rest.  Oh, and we really like a lot of cheese.

I thought this recipe lacked something to bind it together, like a cream of something soup.  Also, the cubed cheddar cheese melts unevenly and because there are bread crumbs on top you are unable to stir it to redistribute.  The package of macaroni I used was just over 12 oz...any more than that would've been too much.  I added some Knorr Garlic Pasta mix (if I had Ranch dressing mix I would've used that) to give it some flavor.  My husband originally thought the bread crumbs on top was Parmesan cheese, which I thought was a good idea.  My picky 15 year old son liked it and everyone said it was good and ate it, but it just wasn't great.  I would try it again with some tweaking.

It tasted okay but it was too dry.  I probably will not make it again.  I added twice the amount of ham called for and chopped broccoli.  Instead of bread crumbs on top, I put cracker crumbs.

Looking at the other reviews, I added more ham, some milk, helluva good dip (French onion) and mozzarella. Turned out creamy and delicious! Next time I think I would get smaller bread crumbs.

One cup of ham was hardly enough for that amount of servings.  I added more ham, and also added some thawed 'mixed vegetables', & increased the other ingredients so that the casserole wouldn't be dry.  It's a great idea, but I plan to keep working on it.

I used this recipe as a base with some substitutions. Instead of using mayonnaise, I brought milk to a near boil and melted shredded Colby Jack cheese into it. I did toss in a handful of flour to help the process along.  I poured the drained macaroni into the melted cheese stirred it up then poured it into the greased casserole dish. I topped it with Parmesan cheese. I appreciate the original recipe provider and those that made recommendations from their experiences. When it finished cooking, I loved it but my friend said it was "all right" but needed something.  Okay, more for me. :)

I believe this recipe could be great and has a lot of potential! I did add broccoli and that was the only change I made. But I feel like it should definitely be Saucier or cheesier!  Will make it again.
