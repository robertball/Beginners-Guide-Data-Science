Outstanding! My boyfriend LOVED this recipe. I left out the thyme and added 2 large potatoes, diced.

I had never made Beef Stew before, but I will make it now after trying this recipe. I used this recipe as a guide because my husband is picky and won't eat onions or carrots in anything.  After all the meat was browned, I used beef broth instead of the wine to deglaze and then added the rest of the broth, beans and a package of beef stew seasoning.  When it was time to add the veggies, I used mushrooms and potatoes. I did need to add more liquid after adding the potatoes, but the beans thickened the stew nicely. I served this along with homemade dinner rolls.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it last night for friends and everyone loved it!  My husband said it was definitely a "keeper".  The aroma while cooking is wonderful.  Not difficult to make, but tastes as though you slaved all day.
