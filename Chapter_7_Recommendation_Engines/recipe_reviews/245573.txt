I wasn't sure what to think about this recipe, with all of the ingredients listed, but I cut the ingredients in half & made it anyway. This recipe was not for me :( I didn't like the texture, the strawberries couldn't be quite pur√©ed so there were chunks of them throughout; which was fine with me, but I just didn't like all of the flavours together. I don't think this will be eaten, I will not make it again.
