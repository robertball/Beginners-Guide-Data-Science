Great recipe! If desired, you can reduce the amount of butter used if you're watching your diet.  I prefer to use a little more garlic, but only because I'm a garlic lover :) I usually make this on the grill, too, and I usually slice the potatoes instead of chopping them.  You can use any kind of potato, not only red potatoes.

These were wonderful! I did them up on the bbq and put about 2 Tbsp. of butter into the package with the potates. I'll make them all summer long next year, my whole family loved them!

...Could not make ANOTHER baked potato in the micro or mashed potato on the stove (can't wait for it to cool down so I can use my oven again!) so decided to try these.  They were ok..next time I will add more seasoning and fresh garlic.  Also turned out a little dry so will add a splash of evoo as well...

This was so delicious! My husband and I aren't big potato eaters but this was so good that I've made it multiple times already! I had to keep the potato sack in the oven a little bit longer than the suggested time but that could be my old oven and not so much the recipe.

These are good.  I added a few extra seasonings, garlic salt, onion salt..  I cooked them in the oven in foil and had to add about 25 minutes to the cooking time.

I used EVOO instead of the butter, and no salt. Used some sliced green onions.

I’ve made these for years I do this recipe without the oregano we love these on the grill or in the oven. I also sometimes mix it up adding red , yellow and/or green peppers for another great taste. I’ve actually also made each person individual foil packets on the grill if that’s all I have to cook in oven that way no need to heat the house up I just add them to the grill we’re already doing the meat on!

These potatoes were delicious! I made them in the oven, they came out perfect except not crispy. They were steamed which was yummy, but I think next time I'll try doing them directly on the cookie sheet so they crisp up a little.

First time to review.  We have been making these while camping, forever! I have made these packs in the oven,  it works well also, it's just a bit harder to get a few crispy potatoes without that fire.  Our family calls them "bum packs," and my granddaughters are always up to help with the slicing of veggies for them.  And we still anxiously await these getting done, oven OR campfire.

Try boiling the potatoes in some chicken stock to get them semi-soft before putting the in the foil.  They come out FANTASTC!

Did about a half batch in the oven tonight. I used some small white potatoes from the garden.  Not bad, but it needs more salt than I put on them (about the same as the pepper and oregano).  And maybe the seasoning would have stuck better if the butter were melted?
