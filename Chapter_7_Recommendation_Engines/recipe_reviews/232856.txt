I followed directions with no changes. The pineapple flavor was nice however I think Id use less vinegar next time. It was pretty good, my picky daughter liked it.

Super easy and delicious. I had all the ingredients on hand. I changed it up a little by leaving the pineapple in chunks, restaurant style,  and added thinly sliced tomatoes one minute before removing from heat. Served over saut√©ed veggies and shrimp. It was a hit! Will definitely make this again.

My blender is broken so left the pineapple as pieces- just perfect for my Chinese sweet and sour pork and dip for Spring Rolls! A definite keeper :0)

This was okay. It was a bit on the sweet side so added 2 gloves of minced garlic and some that chili paste. I used an immersion blender and left a few smaller chunks of pineapple. After my additions it turned out to our liking. If you like a sweeter sauce this is it... But can easily be adjusted according to your taste.

I added a table spoon of fresh lime juice.  The pineapple was over powering.   I also used sweet red chili sauce instead of ketchup.  I also used arrowroot flour to thicken it...why not add an ingredient with nutritional value?  3-4 tbsp.   I chose  this recipe because it used a lot less sugar than the others.

Very easy to make as I had everything already in my pantry except pineapple. So I substituted orange juice to add the fruity sweetness. So good.  I will try it again when I do have a can of pineapples.  Served it with Aidells chicken pineapple meatballs and rice.
