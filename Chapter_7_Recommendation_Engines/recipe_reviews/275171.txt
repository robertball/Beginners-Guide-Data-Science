My family loved this! I made everything as written except I couldnâ€™t find the Udon noodles frozen so I had to settle for the dry udon noodles. I also increased the soy sauce just a bit. Perfect amount of heat if you like it spicy!

Lot of prep work, yeah, but well worth it. I doubled the recipe and did 4 times the onions. Massive hit. The skillet was so cleaned out it almost did not need to be washed.

Not our favorite but not bad, we didn't care for the sauce.
