Don't really like Kale but this recipe made it taste pretty darn good.  Used some cut up oranges in it which tasted really good.  I'm going to add some seeds or nuts next time.  Maybe some craisins but it was good as written.  I didn't use all the dressing though.

I used powdered ginger. My husband and I liked it. I think the other reviewer's idea of the adding mandarin oranges and seeds/sliced almonds would make it even better. If I make this again, I will try those. I think my kids would like it better with those changes too. As is, it was not a hit with the kiddos.

Good flavor profile, maybe sesame oil next time instead of vegetable oil. Used sliced almonds and mandarin oranges.

It was great! My husband hates kale, but after the dressing, he really liked the citrus taste. I’m going to add sunflower seeds, golden raisins, and cranberries. So good!

I wasn’t sure how I’d like this salad being all kale but it was fantastic.  I used ginger paste that I make in my Vitamix which I freeze instead of powdered ginger.  I also added raisins, roasted, chopped walnuts and mandarin orange slices.  And, lastly, I add more dressing.

We'll definitely be having this again!  Lots of good ingredients, and the dressing isn't too sharp.  Well done.

My daughter and I enjoyed this salad.  The main reason that it is not 5 stars is because it is pretty basic with just dressing and kale.  However, it is definitely a solid base to build off.  We really liked the dressing.  I did have to alter it because my daughter is allergic to soy.  The internet recommended substituting the soy sauce for balsamic vinegar and some salt, which worked well.  Next time I will definitely experiment with added items, such as apple, goat cheese, nuts, berries (craisins, etc.).  My husband who hates kale, did not like this salad, but that was no surprise.

Loved the recipe I had some mandarin oranges so made the dressing with that ... added some roasted sesame seeds .... big hit.
