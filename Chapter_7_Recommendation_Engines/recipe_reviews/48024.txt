This is probably one of the top 5 baked chicken recipes I have come across.  It would work well on chicken breasts also.  If you have leftovers, they work well cut up on a salad or on a sandwich.  Highly recommended.

Whether kids are four or fourteen, they all love finger food. My two loved these, however, I fried instead of baked.

This crispy chicken dipper recipe was okay, but I didn't feel that it was very crispy.  I liked the taste, but next time, I might try frying it instead.

These were good. I couldn't get the batter to stick very well, so there wasn't much breading. Probably my mistake. They were very tasty, though. We enjoyed them.

These were really good!  Like another reviewer, I had a small problem with the cracker crumb mixture not wanting to stick very well, so I think next time I will dip the chicken in egg instead of oil and maybe that will work better.  I also had to broil the chicken at the end to get it to crisp up, but the end result was good!
