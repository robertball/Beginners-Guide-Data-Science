We have been making this for years, well half of it.  I have never been good at making meatballs so we by the frozen ones and make the sauce.  We serve this as an appatizer.  I dont know that I would like it for a meal but to snack on durring a football game it is great.  The sauce is so easy to make but you have to crush the gingersnaps til they are like power, put them in a blender or food processor.  They will desolve in seconds.  Keep in a crock pot and serve with toothpicks.

I subscribe to Taste of Home and have been making this recipe for years.  They are a hit with my family.  The gingersnaps are a good and unique addition to the recipe.  Try it.  I do not think you will be sorry!

I wish I could give this one more stars! I have been making it since I first found it in 03' and it instantly became a family favorite! If you saw my stained recipe card you would know it's no lie! I always make the Sunday Dinner Mashed Potatoes to go with it. My praises to you in the kitchen!

I made this to take to a family dinner.  My 9X13 pan was full and it was all gone within 15 minutes.  Everyone loved it!  I also made just the sauce and poured it over those little cocktail sausages.  Wonderful!

I was in a hurry and made the SAUCE ONLY to pour over a bag of frozen meatballs.  Yummy!  The gingersnaps really give it a distinctive taste. You won't be disappointed.

This tasted good but it didn't taste like sweet and sour meat balls, it was actually home made ketchup and meatballs,(all of the ingredients for the sauce are the same as ketchup) but it was still good.

We love this recipe.  I don't care for meatballs, but I really like these.  I've made them for parties, and I always get asked for the recipe.  Even the kids love them. (Sometimes, we know THAT is saying a lot!)  I usually add a little more gingersnaps in the sauce and a little less breadcrumbs in the meatballs.

Very good sauce.  I didn't make the meatballs, so I can't speak to those, but the sauce was good and very easy.  I didn't have gingersnaps so I just used all the spices and flavorings from gingersnaps and added corn starch to thicken them up.  I used turkey sausage and turkey meatballs and it was good.  Thanks for the recipe!

The meatballs are great! I was a little nervous about the sauce with the gingersnaps at first, but they really do add a different taste. I do add a little worchestire sauce and a little sweet babys bbq sauce. Delish!!!

This is not my favorite meatball recipe, but it is certainly always a crowd favorite at our church potlucks. From the first time I made it, the dish gets wiped clean, and I get multiple requests for the recipe....so I keep making it!

I tried this today and found it....okay.
Even with taking out one egg, the meat mixture was WAY too wet and the meatballs took forever to cook. The sauce
was really sweet. I added some soy sauce and minced garlic and it was good, but REALLY sweet. Plus, the gingersnaps never
did dissolve, which my husband and I found weird. Not my kids. They inhaled them. I plan on eating the leftovers cold tomorrow, to see if they are better that way. Maybe it would be good on a hoagie roll?

If I make this again, I might just use the spices and molasses that make it gingersnap-like, and use a ketchup/honey based sauce, and see if that works a little better than this one.

This was a bummer. I was really looking 
forward to this one, too.

Very yummy.  I did not change a thing and I loved them....and I don't even like meatballs I never have.  I made this with the intention of giving hubby and kids something different to eat...thinking I wouldn't like it...well I loved them and ate most of them.

I did not care for this sauce.The cookies are too overwhelming in taste and the sauce becomes way too thick after it heats.But, my husband said he liked it and our little chipooh ate a few!(dog)May try it one more time without the cookies and maybe add some soy sauce or honey garlic sauce.

Needed an appetizer to bring to a party. Used Trader Joe's frozen meatballs and cooked in the sauce. The sauce is awesome, but it is sweet. Definitely would use this recipe again.

My kids are both picky eaters.  I've made this many times, someties I'll use ground chicken instead of beef.  My kids love them!  My husband often requests them.  Its one of our favorites.
