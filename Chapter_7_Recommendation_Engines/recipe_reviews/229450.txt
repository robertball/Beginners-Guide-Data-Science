I was true to the recipe, with the exception of using raisins instead of currants. The recipe is superb -- with a Moroccan or North African twist. Its blend of lamb, spices, almonds and currants (raisins) give it a mellow, sweet, crunchy and heady flavor. This is all offset by the juiciness of the cabbage roll, braised slowly in a hint of tomato puree and silky chicken broth. It was a breeze to make, using Chef John's tips for steaming the cabbage to remove the leaves, plus his directions for shaping the meat into tiny loaves before stuffing and rolling the cabbage like a burrito. This recipe was unlike any other recipe on this site for stuffed cabbage and it was a joy!

Loved the flavor and texture of the rolls. Did a double batch and froze half. I did use a mix of ½ white rice and ½ wild rice.  Made Baked Acorn Squash by Corwynn Darkholm (from this site) as a side. Will definitely make again.

Awesome.  There are only two of us and we ate these for three days in a row.  Few modifications I made.  First, I used red rice.  Second, I had some Campbell's tomato juice cans and it worked out fine.  Third, I added in a dew additional spices I thought would go well into the mix ( personal preference ). Finally, the review that suggested the microwave for the cabbage leaves was awesome.  Put the cabbage in a small casserole and added enough water to cover the bottom with about a quarter inch of water.  Scored and stabbed into the core of the cabbage.  2 minutes at a time and the leaves came of intact.  I didn't burn off my fingers as happens when I boil the cabbage and water gets trapped between the leaves.  Nothing like unexpected scalding to put you off enjoying dinner.   Finally, used the cooking liquid to create a thicker sauce to drizzle.

Could if I could give this recipe a full 10 stars!  It was just the best stuffed cabbage rolls we have eaten - my only change was to use diced tomatoes instead of sauce.  I have it on the menu now for a once a month rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe, Chef John.

Incredible. Love lamb. What is not to love with a $1 cabbage and oooops $6.99/lb ground lamb. Absolutely delicious and the aroma from the spices in the warm pan.... lovely. Yes, chef, to put the spice in the oil is correct!!! Fat does distribute that through the meat more than actually putting it on the meat. I used 'Jasmine' rice, the only ingredient I changed. Absolute nirvanna with a stuffed cabbage. Thank you for sharing this.

Flavor is soooo good, even without the currants (couldn't find them at the store). Careful not to overcrowd the pan! The rice was still firm-to-crunchy cause there wasn't enough room for the liquid to circulate. We still ate them up! Will be making again very soon.

Terrific recipe!!! Love Chef John!!!  I never heard of the way he gets leaves off the cabbage, but it worked as easily as it did on his video .  I followed the  recipe exactly and it was terrific!   Never really used currents, but the combination of his recipe was delicious!

This was a really fun and tasty recipe as Chef Jon's recipes usually are. Next time I make it I would probably increase the seasonings and currant amount to make the flavours punch a bit more. Was good but a touch bland. Feta was really good on top, as well as sour creme, depending on your personal preference. Will definitely be making this one again.

Wow never thought I'd love cabbage.  Had a great deal on the ingredients so thought I'd try it out.  Smelled great from the start.  Made it pretty close to the recipe..though my tomatoe puree was a mix of veggies and tomatoes I had canned previously.  Tomorrow I'll be prepping several for the freezer.

I had a half a head of cabbage so layered half in a pan, put in the filling and cooked rice. Topped with more cabbage. Used a can of diced tomatoes. It was delicious.

I'm a stickler for following the recipe exactly so that it turns out right.  I made this recipe and baked it at the recommended temperature and for the recommended time and the rice was NOT cooked through.  The meat tasted fabulous but it was not edible because of the rice.  In the past, I have always precooked rice before adding it to cabbage rolls and I will do it that way if I ever make this recipe again.

What a hit with the family!  Absolutely love this recipe.  I put basil in instead of oregano and used one 8 oz can of tomato sauce not puree.  Also omitted the almonds and currants....but no matter if you follow it perfectly or make a few changes...it is delish!  Put it in the oven and went on my merry way for an hour and a half...carb, protein and veggie all in one:)  Served with green beans and rosemary garlic fresh baked bread.

I did a change with the rice; did a wild rice blend and it was great.. I over cooked the cabbage and the outer leaves fell apart; but it was still very good!! Definitely one I will do again!

Phenomenal-I am obsessed! These are definitely getting added to the rotation. I used purple cabbage cause that's all I had, and my rice to meat ratio was too low, so I will adjust that next time. I topped it with garlic infused crushed tomatoes from a can cause I'm a working parent. Very impressed, I can eat these everyday!

It was okay. Did not really think the sauce added to the dish. Did like the lamb and seasoning though. Think next time I would add more tomato purée or sauce and more currants.

THIS WAS REALLY GOOD.  NO CHANGES NEEDED.  I HAD A VERY LARGE HEAD OF CABBAGE, SO I CUT IT IN THIRDS TO GET THE RIGHT SIZE LEAVES.  THEN I WAS ABLE TO PULL THE LEAVES OFF & THEN BLANCH  WITHOUT COOKING THE REST OF THE CABBAGE.

We NEEDED to cater my brother’s wife’s grandparent’s 70th wedding anniversary party!! They were traveling all the way from Hungary just to dine with our extended family! I chose this recipe for the lamb and the spice arrangement (oooo Nagymama )! We octupled the recipe to feed 40 people! I *soft* cooked the rice before mixing the meat! The dish was a hit and our meat guy was pleased! Never underestimate the power of traditional dishes with a twist! If only all families could experience the joy our’s shared this weekend!

I wouldn't rate the recipe as easy...but it was easier than I thought it would be...and soo tasty!  It reminded my wife of the grape leaf wraps she would get in her native Albania.  Another SUPERB recipe from Chef John!  Thanks for making the difficult recipes easy for all of the rest of us.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I followed the recipe and really liked the outcome.  My personal preference is a little more puréed tomatoes and a little less broth.  I think the broth I used made it a little too salty.  I will definitely make this again.  It’s the best recipe I’ve found for lamb stuffed cabbage rolls.

I love this recipe and make it frequently. It's a weekend meal, because it takes a while to make, but it's worth it. I am heavy handed on the spices and add tumeric. I also cook the rice by itself first and then add it to the meat mixture. if you put it in uncooked it comes out crunchy. You end up not using as much rice that way because cooked rice takes up more room, but that's ok with me.  I also mix the tomato sauce and chicken broth together before pouring it over the rolls. My husband doesn't like cabbage, but he loves this dish. My boys are 6 and 8 and they eat the meat mixture out of it and don't eat the cabbage, which means more cabbage for me. I highly recommend watching the video on how to cook the cabbage and cut it to make the rolls the first time you make it.

Fantastic!  VERY TASTY!
I reduced the cayenne in 1/2 because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food.  And substituted dried cranberries because I couldn't find currants.  Otherwise followed the directions precisely.  Our dinner guests asked for the recipe. 
 Will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe. Very flavourful as the Dutch oven does an excellent job of locking in flavours, however be mindful of the size and type of cabbage you use. I used a cabbage on the larger side and found that although it was easy to wrap, it was not easy to eat as it was on the thicker and more fibrous side. So make sure you use a smaller cabbage! That’s my only recommendation! Otherwise very tasty

Very good. I substituted coconut oil for butter, and left out the feta cheese, to make a Kosher dish. Also, used brown rice instead of white, and cooked the rice (with a bit less water and for less time) before I added it to the recipe. Everyone loved it; thirds and fourths, lol. Good thing I doubled the recipe!

Chef John does it again!    The spice combinations are reminiscent of north African food. If you like Moroccan food you’ll love these. I had extra stuffing left over so I use them for making stuffed grape leaves and those were even better than the cabbage! They didn’t even make it to the table!

I did not have lamb so I made the recipe entirely with ground beef.  It was delicious.  The cinnamon was a pleasant surprise.  The video showing how to wrap the leaves was a great help.  I always thought stuffed cabbages would be too much work, but it wasn't.  I look forward to making them again!

Followed the recipe exactly and loved the results! I have never made cabbage rolls with lamb before and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious they were with the cumin and cinnamon. The rice was done - whew. Preparation was easy, and since today is a Sunday, baking the dish for an hour and a half was fine. The only change I'll make the next time will be to thicken the pan juices  after the dish comes out of the oven.  Thank you!

I am a huge fan of stuffed cabbage rolls, but not particularly this recipe.  I must tell you I was surprised just what little flavor it had.  The rice was not cooked throughly, but had I cooked longer, perhaps it would have had less flavor?  Parboil? If I attempt this again, I will most likely do a combination meat, such as a small amount of pork and beef, and possibly a bit of fennel, extra currants and cinnamon and possibly a can of tomato soup. Maybe even a couple of tablespoons of the tomato soup in the meat mixture?  I am a huge lamb fan, but I intend to tweak this one.  I’ll report back after another attempt. It was beautiful on the plate! Chef John, I try most of your recipes and rate them very high.  I wanted bolder on this one.

The rice was only partially cooked when I made it, which really distracted from how tender and flavorful the lamb was. I'm not sure if this was because my pan was too small or if it just needed a longer amount of time to cook, but if I make these again I think I'll par boil the rice beforehand.

We'd give this more stars if we could. A couple days after i made it I went back to the store to get another couple packages of frozen ground lamb to have on hand. 
The flavors of this dish blended beautifully, and the tip for how to roll the cabbage really helped (I've always had problems with the thick part of the spine but never thought to cut it off.  I was only able to fit a little over half of the juice in the pan so the sauce it made was a bit limited, next time I'll use a deeper dish because the sauce is so important and flavorful. The wife fell in love with me all over again, but I think she's  thinking of moving in with chef John... I wouldn't blame her since we haven't had a bad dish created by him yet

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe!  Our eyes rolled back in our heads with every bite.  No exaggeration: this is my number one favorite recipe now. I told a friend about it the week before Thanksgiving, and she ended up making it for her family instead of turkey...and everyone raved about it!  My absolute favorite, end without end, amen.

4 *s for taste.  3*s for convenience.  To my surprise, we loved the extra cabbage on bottom and top.  Delicious with the sauce.  The taste was good but definitely not much lamb flavor.  Could have had more spices for our preference and only mildly aware of the currants and almonds.  I would not bother with the almonds again and try raisins.  One issue was the meat rolls were so packed that it made eating with just a fork or spoon difficult.  Perhaps I rolled them too firmly.  Would be happy to hear others suggestions.  The rice, for me, was well cooked so not the problem others had.

I made this for dinner tonight. I didn't realize how much work it was. By the time we served dinner it was 8:30pm. But that was my fault not reading the whole recipe ahead of time. Peeling the cabbage leaves was a pain (taking a long time to peel one by one). The rest wasn't too bad. Next time I'll prepare part of the work ahead of time. I used days old cooked rice. Since it was kept in the fridge and the rice was quite dry. I think that was perfect to use in this recipe in place of uncooked rice which I read reviews about under cooked rice. The head of cabbage I bought wasn't really big. I only got 8 large leaves, which was just enough to make 8 rolls. I lined the small leaves on the bottom of the pan and wrapped tin foil on top to keep the rolls moist. The house smelled and is still smelling divine with cumin. I held back on amount of salt since we're on low sodium diet. The rolls turned out very good. They're light and delicious.

I didn't add the almonds or the currants (my grocery store does not sell them  and we are not fans of raisins) but other than that I stayed true to the recipe. It was wonderful... beautiful flavors. I had a friend over who makes stuffed cabbages and she said they were better than what she made! Super yummy! The only thing I would change next time is reducing the amount of rice. Waay too much rice.

We used chopped up chicken instead of ground lamb. Also made some substitutions with the spices due to availability. Also used boiled down spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste due to availability. Used craisins instead of currents. Was a little dry but still very good.
Is the broth supposed to submerge the cabbage rolls? Maybe the pan we used was too big. The extra cabbage leaves covering the cabbage rolls was starting to burn. We covered it with tin foil after that.

May be my new Christmas Dinner tradition. Used left over lamb from December 21st birthday dinner so since the lamb was cooked I pre cooked the rice too and mixed all together with the cooked onions letting it sit for an hour for flavors to mix. Then just baked the stuffed cabbages for 30 minutes since everything was cooked already. I topped with a mixture of tomato sauce and 1 can of tomato paste then sauerkraut on top of that. Will make it again for sure.

I made it just like the recipe said.  I didn't like it because it calls for uncooked rice to be mixed into the meat mixture,  It didn't cook it was hard.  The flavor was ok but overall I was disappointed, for all that work and to have the rice hard.  I always wanted to make stuffed cabbage rolls, this turned out to be a big waste of time.

i changed this as my husband hates cabbage with a passion...i have been craving cabbage rolls so i thought---he loves lamb (what's not to love) so i'll try this recipe with grape leaves, he loves dolmades & see if that satisfies both of us.  & a major yes.  it was delicious, & i have to say having made traditional CRs in the past, grape leaves a way easier, way less work. 

thanks chef john, always a treat to try your recipes, & apologies to all those who hate when a reviewer rates & reviews without having made the recipe EXACTLY.

I used lean ground beef instead of lamb and these were still delicious.  My prep time was quite a bit longer than the 30 minutes given in the recipe - plan on spending at least an hour pulling this together.  Time well spent!

Perfect with just enough "zing" due to tomato.  Some people wanted more of a tartness on their rolls so I gave them a little dash of Balsamic Vinegar.  Especially liked John's descriptive instruction....."and roll it like a big fat party, burrito" ....is it me or did another thought come to mind just then?

1/2 large white cabbage made 16 rolls. Next time I will make the rolls much smaller, max 1/4 c filling each. I think 1/2 cabbage leaves will be suitable for this, although I had problems getting the leaves to fold so might use savoy next time. The spices should be increased by 1.5 or 2. The almonds and fruit should be doubled. I might make this again as meatballs braised in the tomato sauce.

The flavors were excellent, however, we made this an unrolled lamb and cabbage roll.   We mixed the cabbage, rice, meat, onion, garlic and spices.  Then we formed them into meat logs and covered that with the tomatoes and broth and cooked in the oven at 350 for just over an hour.  My kids who don't like cabbage or tomatoes even loved this dish and said "give it 5 stars!"

Fabulous flavor, fabulous texture! No problems with getting the rice done for us (cooked covered for 1 1/2 hours, let sit covered for 1/2 hour). Hubby and I are not small eaters, and one roll is PLENTY for a serving. And with the video, I can now make the rolls right! Thanks, chef!!

I made with raisins.  This was great.  I went by recipe except I had fresh Greek oregano from my garden.  I loved putting the whole cabbage in the water.  This is a great way to keep leaves from tearing.  My rice along with rest of dish was cooked perfect.

Chef John, every recipe of your is amazing.  I'd love to be a dinner guest at your home sometime!!   
I'm not a big fan of lamb, and hubby does not care for currants or almonds. Having said that, I stuck 100% to your recipe and it was nothing short of delicious heaven.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again; the feta cheese garnish gave it a little punch that was fantastic.   Neither of us picked anything out of our dinner dish, and some warm, buttered rustic bread helped to sop up those juices.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were absolutely delicious!   I used raisins instead of currants because I couldn't find any in the store.  Also, I cut the cabbage in fourths and cooked it.  Then, I ended up with about 15-20 small cabbage rolls.  The directions are a little confusing and it is somewhat more time intensive than I realized.  I wonder if I could precook the meat and rice to cut down on some of the cooking time.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!  However, next time I would flash the rice with the onions and garlic...it didn't cook all the way through.  Also, doubled batched it too and used 2 cups less broth (and less butter) and set the oven at 400...350 wasn't enough.  First attempt was tasty but would make those changes next time.

Oh man…this is so delicious. I made it exactly as written, with the optionals, and the exception that I had to use tomato sauce instead of purée because there was none in the pantry. This may have affected the consistency of the sauce, but it was acceptable to me. I served it with potato pancakes and applesauce. It is going into my do-over file.

I loved this recipe.  So did my son and a guest.  It is even better the next day.  I am certainly going to make this again, now that I know how to make it.  It is certainly a very versitile recipe.  I think this recipe might work well using my large slow cooker (a Nesco) so I can leave during the cooking time.  It really smells good while cooking.  I love the spices!

I had gone to our local Farmer's market the day before and had brought home some fresh ground lamb, a red cabbage, a fennel bulb, and some hickory nuts.  I searched for a recipe with the first two ingredients and found this one.  I had Jasmine rice on hand.

It worked well with red cabbage leaves, and the hickory nuts instead of almonds.  I substituted golden raisins for the currants.  I used organic crushed tomatoes from a can and this worked out well.  I used a 1/3 cup of the brine from the canned green olives I had served earlier instead of prepared chicken broth.  (I hate boxed chicken broth, it tastes terrible to me.)  I didn't have any parsley, so I used some of the fennel, and I also added a finely diced stalk of celery to the lamb mixture.  I used a really good parmesan cheese on top at the end of the cooking time and cooked it a little longer to brown the top.  

Also, I made it with cooked rice by mistake, and it was great, but I will try using uncooked rice for the next time.

I tried this and the flavor was good but the rice was not properly cooked.  It was still hard and crunchy.  Maybe it's because I didn't notice I should let it rest for 30 minutes after cooking.
