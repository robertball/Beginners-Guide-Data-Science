25 years ago, in Moscow, Georgian restaurant in Russia, first tasted khachapuri with a glass of white wine.... 
I was in love with the first taste. After that, I always have wanted to make it  by myself.
Today my dream of baking Khachapuri came true, I could make it by myself with the recipe of Chef John. Fantastic taste!  It is really delicious. 

I strongly recommend it to every body.
I have nothing to talk about this recipe...... except I added some shredded cheddar cheese.  I also ate this bread with some fresh tomatoes and Arugula, This fresh vegetables increase the greatest taste matching with Khachapuri. 
Thanks John.

I divided mine into two and made it a little flatter, but it turned out great!  This is truly delicious and one that my kids couldnâ€™t stop eating.  It will definitely be made again!

What a fun and different way to serve a soft egg.  It was a great hit in my family.  It is a bit big for one person.  Next time I would try to make room for 2 yolks and 1 egg white for two people to share.  Made this at the lake in the earthen/Cob Oven - perfect!

I think the feta was a bit too much and made it too salty. I'll make it again but I'll use 4 oz. of feta and 6 oz each of mozzarella and Monterey jack cheese. Thanks Chef John.

We tried different cheese blends with one boat eggless with a bit of margarine and the other with two eggs and butter.  The consensus was skip the egg and try a different combination of cheeses.

Very delicious! It's definitely a shareable food, though my wife and I realized that after we were halfway through our own. Check the filling before sprinkling with salt because ours was pretty salty.
