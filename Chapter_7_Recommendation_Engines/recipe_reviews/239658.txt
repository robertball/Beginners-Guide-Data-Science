I recently went on a search for more recipes to add to my collection. After several disappointing tries, I stumbled across this one. I tried it with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised! My family gave it a thumbs up and it was very easy to make. I made it exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.

Pretty tasty! I wondered if the pasta would cook in the skillet without boiling it first and it did! I loved the subtle taste of bacon in every bite and the spinach made me feel like I was being sort of healthy. I'd recommend this easy dish!

I am so loving this recipe. The first time I tried it, I added pieces of pork chops ( four center cut) instead of bacon. The second time (tonight), I added Turkey sausage instead. My favorite thing about this recipe (besides the taste), is that everything really does go into one pot!! No frying or saut√©ing in one pot, whilst boiling pasta in another. I love it!!
