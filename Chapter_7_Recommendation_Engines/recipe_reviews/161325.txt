This is a good smoothie but I also add grapes and fresh ginger. The ginger gives it that extra zing. You can also substitute soy yogurt for the milk.

This was good. I doubled the recipe, but felt it could use something more... for more sweetness. Maybe I'll try peanut butter next time.

I don't drink soy milk so I used fat free milk and a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. Next time, I'll use the whole banana.

This was okay, but there wasn't that much flavor. I think I might try it again, substituting fruit yogurt for the soy milk and/or fresh bananas for frozen.

I do this every morning, I also add oatmeal to it, It keeps satisfied all day much like the strawberry oatmeal smoothie. I love it, very full filling, and healthy.

7.22.18  I used non-dairy coconut milk, otherwise, followed the recipe.  This was V-E-R-Y thick, really challenged even my Vitamix®.  I had to add some additional milk and water to reach a thick, but at least drinkable consistency.  Pretty good, but there definitely was an aftertaste of the flax seed meal.

Here in the Caribbean, we use more fresh fruits. I used papaya instead of strawberries and it was delicious! Will definitely make this more often. Used it mostly as a Breakfast Smoothie.
