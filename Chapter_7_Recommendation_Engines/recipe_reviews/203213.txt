I did alter the recipe as follows:  I added chopped cilantro (fresh), chopped onion, 4 smashed garlic, Two big cans of different kinds of Mexican beans drained,  Red pepper flakes, oregano, salt/pepper,wee bit of sugar and juice of 1/4 fresh lime.  Let it simmer most of the day.  Added 1 handful of rice too.  Yummy.  So. Your recipe was my base and I thank you very much. Aso browned all the meat and added one quart of vegetable stock in place of wine and left out cloves.  Beverly

I really liked this recipe very much. The suggestion to drop the cloves and use 1/4 lime and more garlic instead and add some onion worked great -- I wish I had thought to get some cilantro instead of parsley, which would have been even better. I served it with jalapeno/cheese cornbread (and the rest of the red wine!).

This is a great basic recipe but it's missing a few ingredients that would make it traditional, "New Mexican Green Chili Stew." I say, "New Mexican," since few Mexicans cook soley with fresh green chili's. [they wait for them to ripen for preservation purposes & use primarily red] But after they migrated to the US, this Green Chili Stew became more of a necessary adaptation due to income restrictions. This stew was actually created when Hispanics with large families &  limited incomes worked in the Hatch, NM chili fields. Instead of pork or prime cuts of beef, they used hamburger meat though pork shoulder was definitely preferred. [trust me when I say ground cumin & pork go together like helpless women and railroad tracks] Anyway, the more traditional version presents 2 + lbs Hatch Green Chili's, chopped jalapeños, potatoes, hearty amounts of white onions & celery stalks with leaves, loads of cilantro & cumin, (2 + tbs cumin) parsley, generous amounts of garlic, green/red tomatoes, cayenne and black pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, Mexican Oregeno, bay leaves, Italian seasoning & beef/chicken/vegetable/or pork broth & was always served with warm tortillas. Notice that all ingredients were very easy to come by & cheap for Hispanic workers. If pork was used, they would season flour the meat & brown with garden vegetables then place in pot & simmer until the pork fell apart. This method also made for a thicker stew. Either way, it's a delicious stew & great recipe Michelle!

We loved this recipe! I am making it again this weekend after we just had it last weekend. My son loved it. It would make a hearty winter dish and could be served over rice.

I have been making something like this since I was 12.  I use stew meat, diced canned tomatoes (fire roasted with garlic works great) and cilantro.  I omit the wine.  If you like a little heat, add some chili powder or jalapeños.  When it's done, we fold a flour tortilla in thirds and use it almost like a spoon.  Scoop a spoon full on the end and take a bite.  I have also torn a flour tortilla over the top of a bowl of this for a less messy way of eating it.    Works GREAT in the crockpot if you drain the tomatoes first.
