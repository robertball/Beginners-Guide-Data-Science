So I made this today and the sauce was absolutely delicious. I didn't use as much cream cheese as the recipe called for (I used about 5oz) but still had a really nice consistency to the sauce. My beef did get a little tough. Not sure why I asked the butcher for stew beef. I might have left the crockpot on high a little too long. It's def something my partner wants me to make again! And it was quick and easy. I paired it with some egg noodles and a salad.

I used this as a template to do a stove top version, and it was delicious! I got the sauce going as directed (in a pot), but I added more water and continued adding water as necessary so it could cook together nicely without getting too thick or burning. We were low on money so I used ground chuck, browned it, and then added it to the sauce as instructed. I let that cook for a couple if minutes as I boiled the noodles, and then as my noodles were finishing I melted the cream cheese into the sauce. This is a delicious, very easy dinner! It also re-heated very well.

My husband and I had this tonight, and we both loved it. It was very filling; and it was the perfect meal for a chilly winter night in New England. Quick, simple and delicious.

I loved how easy this was to cook in the slow cooker. I have a slow cooker that browns, so I browned the meat and sauteed some onions and mushrooms then followed the rest of the instructions to the letter. Super simple and really delicious.

I loved this considering I used ground beef and I did not have sour cream on hand so I was hoping it would still taste good and good enough it turned out yummy!!!

We just tried this recipe for the first time tonight... it was a hit!  I am not the most kitchen-savy wife but I felt confident enough to give the crock pot a go.  I took another reviewer's advise and only used half of the onion soup powder.  It turned out great!  Husband loved it and has requested we add this to our rotation.  I used about 1.3 pounds of stew cubes from the store and I think if I had cut them smaller I could easily doube the rest of the recipe and have more than enough for guests.  I am anxious to see how it fairs as a reheated leftover.

The only change I made was cooking on low over 6-7 hours :) beef was super tender and everything tasted amazing! I added too much water but just added a little flour before serving to thicken :) thanks for sharing!!

This was pretty good.  I used chive & onion cream cheese for an extra boost.  I still prefer the real beef stroganoff, but for a weeknight or potluck, this is a quick, satisfying meal, though obviously loaded with sodium from all the processed products so expect your pants to be a bit snug the next day!

I made this recipe with cooked ground beef and added mushrooms, garlic, sour cream, and Worcestershire sauce. I also used just half of the onion soup mix and cooked this on  the stove top.  It was easy and quick, but most of all it was delicious! My husband is a bit picky about his food, but he said he loved it, and he came back for more!!! Can't wait to make it with stew meat in the  pot!!!

Gravy was good but I have never had good luck with stew beef. Too chewy. Better to use ground beef. Good luck.

So simple, yet so yummy and satisfying! Will be adding this to our dinner rotation per hubby's request. I love that it doesn't take all day to cook since I usually forget to start slow cooker meals in the morning!

This recipe is great! It is extremely simple to make but still tastes very good! My boyfriend hates mushrooms and this recipe doesn't contain them but still has the same taste as a stroganoff recipe that does. Overall, I am very pleased!

I had 2 lbs of beef so I used 3 cans of the cream of mushroom soup, but only 1 packet of onion soup mix. I added steak seasoning, Worcestershire sauce & steak sauce (And the water), cooked on high for one hour, then added fresh sliced mushrooms and cooked for 2 more hours, then added 8oz. Cream cheese and some leftover sour cream that I had. Came out great over egg noodles! Served with a side of green beans.

This recipe is simple and good. I doubled the recipe because I was having several people over and didn't want to end up short. I did use just half the recommended dry onion soup mix, partly because some reviewers suggested it and partly because my bro-in-law has a sodium problem. It turned out very well, but it's important to make sure you do a couple things to make it turns out as best it can. I didn't cube the prime top round roast I used (2 lbs), I just cut it in half so it wouldn't cook too fast. I recommend this. I poked it with a fork after the first three hours and then again about a half hour later until I could tell it was tender. Then I pulled the meat out and cut it into smaller pieces and returned it to the crock pot along with the cream cheese. The meat was pretty much perfect at the time, so I wish I'd pulled it out a bit sooner. The cream cheese should be allowed an hour or more with the crock pot on low to fully mix with the rest of the ingredients. So, next time I'm pulling the meat at the 3-hour mark, cutting and returning it to the pan with the cream cheese, and letting it go at least another hour before serving. Again, great, incredibly easy recipe that I will definitely make again. Cheers!

It was pretty good actually, I was impressed, as I haven't had luck with beef stroganoff in the past. I will make it again, especially how easy it was to put together, could even do for a weeknight meal with prep in the morning. The meat was tender as I left it in the crockpot for about 6 1/2 hours on low. I added chunked fresh mushrooms and sliced onions, and only used 1/4 of a block of cream cheese which it may not have even needed as the flavor was already quite strong, but it added a creamy texture to it. I used bow tie pasta instead as I didn't have any egg noodles.

This was so simple and so fabulous!   I have to eat Gluten Free, so I used Progresso brand Cream of Mushroom soup.  It's not condensed, so I skipped the extra water.  I also substituted beef flavored Better Than Bouillon for the onion soup mix because of gluten content.  Oh, and I added a can of mushroom pieces, too.  My sauce was a little thin, but tightened up a bit with the addition of the cream cheese.   In the end, I ended up with a super fabulous gluten free meal with minimal effort.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe. My girlfriend and I love it. I cook it as the recipe says but I use ground chuck instead. I also add a can of mushroom stems & pieces, one beef bouillon cube and red onion chopped. I don't always add the red onion. Just when the moods right! It does add a good flavor and texture to the recipe when you add the onion and mushroom.

Omg - so good!  I used a second can of Cream of Mushroom soup and put in a bunch of onion powder since I did not have another Lipton packet.  I also added mushrooms and used about 6-7 oz of cream cheese.  Definitely going to make this one again and again and again!

Yummy!  Didn't add the soup mix or the other enhancements except green onions because I marinated a cubed blade roast over night in red wine and zesty Italian dressing.  The result was flavourful and hubby went for another plate!  I'll be making this again with a better cut of meat.

Good, easy recipe.  I used leftover pot roast from Sunday dinner and cooked on stove top.  Turned out well!  Family enjoyed it. 
Next time, I'll try the slow cooker.

This tasted really good! I used milk instead of water and added mushrooms and I also stirred in some sour cream at the end when adding the cream cheese. My sauce came out a little thin (I may have added too much liquid) so I thickened it up with a little flour, but the flavor was very, very good! I will be making this again!

I sautéed onions and thinly sliced red peppers in butter, then added sliced roast beef, (cut into strips.) I used 1/2 cup of milk instead of water. I ended up putting in an extra cup of milk cause I found it tasted too strong of onion soup mix. It was delicious. Will definitely make it again. My son asked for the recipe as well.

I doubled the ingredients and used 2 lbs. of top sirloin cut in to 1 inch pieces. I also added 2 tbsp. of Worcester sauce, 8oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and 2 tsp. of garlic powder, or to taste. I will definitely use this recipe as my go to.

So easy, and so delicious. It was the easiest to throw together while doing household chores. I would recommend for sure! I added a little beef broth to mine, and milk. That’s just me, but it made it so good!

Rather bland flavor. Had to add more garlic and some butter to make it taste better. Maybe the mushrooms "watered" the flavor down some. The next time I try this I will sample while cooking.

I did not use a slow cooker but cooked it on the stove and simmered for about 1/2 hours.  I used a can of water to get the mushroom soup out of the can and also used enough milk to find my desired consistency.  Didn't use cream cheese, but sour cream.  Just goes to show this is a versatile recipe.!  Everyone liked it!

This has become my family's favourite stroganoff recipe. It is now the only 1 we use. Due to allergies, I omit the pepper. I usually use the firm Bergeron cheese in place of the parmesan, because that's what I keep on-hand.

This is very good and I make it as-is on a regular basis (as 5 star as-is).  However, I also goofed once and thought I would share in case it helps anyone.  Realizing I didn't have cream of mushroom soup - I used Cream of Chicken.  To help solve problem, I used beef broth instead of the water and added a splash of red wine.  Was still great :)   Hope it helps anyone that didn't have the cream of mushroom or just flat out messed up like I did!

This was a very simple and easy recipe, not to many ingredients needed, however it was very flavorful! Love the sour creme addition.  I did add a spoonful of chopped
  jalapenos,for that little kick I prefer. Will add this to the family's rotation of meals.

This was very good and easy to make. I used leftover grilled sirloin. I sliced it thin and added it to the sauce after it was done. Would be good with any leftover beef. It was a little salty so next time I will use low sodium cream of mushroom. I added sour cream but that is just because I really like it. I served it with egg noodles but the sauce was so good that my son was sopping it up with sourdough bread. Far easier to make than standard stroganoff. It's a keeper!

Excellent Recipe! Extremely easy and very flavorful! I was a little skeptical at first, but as soon as I took the first taste I knew it would be a hit with my husband and sister in law. We added lots of mushrooms and used hamburger meat instead, but will try it again using bits of steak as well.

This was fantastic !! I made small variations like subbing the water for beef stock, adding mushrooms and some flour to thicken the gravy. Over all amazing ! I let it cook on low for an extra hour and the beef literally fell apart off the fork. Fantastic !

A very good and easy recipe. The only things I did differently was: I used steak pre-cut for stir fry. It worked great and came out tender. I also added mushrooms.

I added some chopped onions and a little cut up bacon pieces. When I added the cream cheese, I jazzed it up with a small can of mushroom pieces. Yum!

I did not have stew beef on hand and used meatballs instead. This was absolutely delicious! I will make it again! The sauce was very tasty, although I found it a little salty, probably due to the fact that  we have tried to cut down on sodium. My husband, who is not a fan of Stroganoff, also enjoyed it very much!

This is a good base recipe to get the gist of how to make stroganoff with the least possible level of intimidation. I changed a few things around however. I used a slightly larger can of con. COM soup, a slightly larger packet of onion soup/dip mix, instead of water I used beef broth (about 1C), instead of cubed beef I used a pound of ground beef, instead of 4oz of cream cheese I used 6oz and 2T of sour cream, 1t of white vinegar. I used an entire bag of egg noodles and still had some sauce left over. Came out great. I cooked my version for 1.5hr in the slow cooker on high, stirred briskly with a whisk to break up the meat a little further and then another 1.5hr on high to finish it off.

Excellent recipe! Cheap, easy, and delicious. It's a good thing I made a double batch. The family went back for thirds! I did use slightly less cream cheese but it would have been fabulous with all of it

I had to make this on the stove top for I was short on time. I use a whole can of milk instead of water along with 8 oz of creem cheese. This made the sauce thick and rich. I will try to make it  in the crockpot next time.

This is a delicious recipe + easy - 2 winners in my book! I browned the meat with some sliced onions and added fresh mushrooms when added the soup/water.  I did not have cream cheese and used sour cream in its place.  Will definitely make again.

Will have to double the recipe to feed a family of three boys next time around. Sauce was delicious. All of the ingredients for traditional beef stroganoff tend to be pricey, but this was simple and much more affordable.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe. I used ground beef instead and added more water and cream cheese.  The onion pack made it too salty without the added water. The extra cream cheese keep it creamy. Will make again.

So easy! I used venison burger instead of beef tips and I added fresh mushrooms and onions to ingredients. I also cooked it stove top in 20 minutes instead of 3hour crock pot. (Cooked mushrooms, onions and meat  together and the soup mixture separate. then once meat was finished I combined everything together and added the cream cheese and stirred until smooth. Served over noodles, yum!

I really liked this recipe. It was a bit strong though so next time I plan on using two cans of soup for it. I don't like stroganoff but I wanted to make something different and this looked good. It is something I will make again and again. Super simple and tasted good.

My husband and I loved this!! I used the recipe as a base and made a few changes. I used sour cream instead of cream cheese and added fresh mushrooms. I also added garlic salt and a cup of red wine. Beef broth instead of water and cornstarch at the end to thicken. Cooked on high for 2 hours and then on low for 6 hours. The extra cook time made a huge difference. Super tender and tasty!

Not bad for a meal that only takes 3-4 hours, realistically. I added onion and mushrooms to mine, that's the only change. I've made it a few times and no complaints :)

Very nice flavor and simple to make.  I used stew beef and tasted the meat about 2 hours in and it was very tender and medium rare. I had left the slow cooker on high that entire time. I should have stopped there, but left it on high another hour (as I misread the recipe) and the meat turned out a bit too well done for us and a bit tough.  My kiddos liked the flavor and I will definitely make again....making sure I don't cook too high and too long the next time!

So delicious for as easy as it was to make! I used sirloin steak on sale rather than stew steak cause I don't like how tough it is. Even my husband who claims he does not like stroganoff said he loved it!

I used hamburger meat instead of the tips. Didn't have any onion mix, so I just seasoned the beef with garlic and onion powder. Turned out awesome! Better than the store bought hamburger helper. Quick and easy!! Defintely will have again! Thanks for sharing

I was looking for an easy, slow cooker recipe.  I expected to like it, I was surprised I loved it. I made two slight changes. I browned the beef before I added it to the crockpot.  I only used half a packet of onion soup mix because I find they are usually too salty for us, and it turned out perfect.
