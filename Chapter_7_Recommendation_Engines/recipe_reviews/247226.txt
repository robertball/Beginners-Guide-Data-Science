This is one of those recipes that after you read it you say, "this sounds so crazy, it just might work."  And it does. It is hard to justify nutritionally, but definitely a bucket list contender. At least once you've got to try it. I only used about a half cup of syrup.  The bread doesn't really toast, but the bacon gets crunchy so the soft bread is nice. I doubt I will ever make this again, but will suggest it to others. The genius who thought up bacon cooked in maple syrup deserves a Nobel prize. Thank you for the recipe.
