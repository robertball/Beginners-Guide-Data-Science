I made this dish But I made a few changes. One, I did not use canned beef broth. I made my own the day before using beef marrow bones some vegetables and prepared it in my Dutch Oven at 200 f in my gas oven for 12 hours.

I cut back on the diced tomatoes. It's beef vegetable soup. It should taste like beef and not tomato.  I also skipped the cut green beans and the chilli. 

I prefer the focus to be on the beef flavour. I would make that culinary decision even if I hadn't made the beef broth myself. As you can see from the accompanying photo it was a big hit.

If you have the time, use your dutch oven to make your own broths and stocks. The slow cooking in your oven makes for a more effective extraction of nutrients and flavour. Plus, you won't have all those additives of questionable value.

Oh my goodness this is delicious!!  I tweaked the recipe ever so slightly because of the items I had already and personal preference.  I used reduced sodium beef broth and no salt added tomatoes and instead of the second can of tomatoes, I used a 12oz. bottle of V8 juice and it was perfect!!!  It made the perfect amount for leftovers for lunch or dinner again another night.  Love, love, loved it and so did my husband.  We can't wait to make it again!

This is pretty much the way my family has always made vegetable soup.  Growing up fairly poor and having to feed a large family, we did make this a little more economical.  Rather than using steak for the meat base, we'd get a chuck roast or other less expensive cut to use. We also save the liquid from cooking vegetables by pouring cooled liquid in a jar and freezing it.  Come soup time, you pull out that liquid, now containing any left over dabs of veggies, and throw that into the soup too!  Waste not, want not!  No hot sauce for our soup!  Is almost soup time again!  Enjoy!

It tastes better each time it's warmed up again.  I make it, then place the soup into mason jars.  Put them in the  refrigerator and when we want soup it's there for the warming.  It is gone before a week is up for tossing.  Love this recipe.

I used venison tenderloin for this recipie.  I followed everything else exactly.  Very good, hearty cold weather soup!   The whole family loved it and you have to love cooking in a cast iron Dutch oven.

I made this soup yesterday. It turned out very tasty. I did change a few things to make it Keto. I left out the potatoes and added diced Italian squash and broccoli. My company over to eat dinner and they loved it!

This is one of few recipes I have not had to tweak much, a great comfort food recipe. I do leave out the hot sauce for my wife's taste.

This recipe is a great starter.  It is simple, the ingredients are very normal, things you can put your hands on quickly, etc.  Number one most important thing is that it tastes good.  With that said, I played with the recipe.  I used boneless beef short ribs rather than sirloin.  A cost difference of $4.00 /lb.  I use more meat than the recipe calls for - double.  I want homemade soup, not Campbells.  I added baby lima beans to the vegetable mix, added two tablespoons of Better than Boullion (it is and it was) and I used little white potatoes that only had to be sliced in half.  It served two adults for dinner, one adult for lunch and one adult with leftovers he second day.  It was good.  What can I say?  We pigged out.  My mother taught me the benefits of a Dutch Oven over 60 years ago.  Stove top or in the oven.

Boom, added vegetable broth instead of beef, and no meat. The flavor is still amazing, and very tasty!!

Love this recipe!  Very hearty and I can eat it all week for lunch.  Instead of water I used beef broth for more flavor.  I also used only one bay leaf the second time I made it because I thought the flavor was a little much and overbearing,  but that's just my personal preference.

It's a very cold day in February but that doesn't matter because I have this soup simmering on the stove. I started it at 4:00p and it will be ready to eat by 6:30p.  This soup is so easy! It's my family's favorite.

Excellent soup. I love the full flavor with just a little kick. The only thing I did different was use a 32oz can of beef stock instead of water. Turned out great.
