WARNING: I DID MAKE A FEW CHANGES! SLIGHT CHANGES!

I am doing the Whole 30 and I loved this, although I did cheat a bit.  I ordered some Coconut Aminos, a substitute for Worcestershire sauce, but they won't be in for a week.  So I cut the Worcestershire sauce in half.  I also used beef instead of bison because I'm on a budget.  So to reduce the fat, I simmered my sausage and beef in a separate pan!

We don't have to watch our sodium so the last change I made was I salted as I went.  I salted the vegetables, salted the meat, salted the spices, salted after I added the tomatoes. 

Lastly, I doubled this recipe and it was PERFECT.  SO DELICIOUS.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  The spice mix is so perfect.  I have made this twice in the last two days for Christmas parties and have had numerous recipe requests.  Paleo purists would not approve of Worcestershire sauce, but there are plenty of recipes out there to make your own.  Or live it up and just use it.  This is GREAT!  The only addition I made was to add about 1/2 cup of tomato juice and 1/2 cup of beef broth to make it a little more soupy (and to make it go a little further).  I also used just ground beef because that is what I had on hand.  Amazing recipe, you won't be disappointed!  Thanks for sharing with us!!

I am doing a Whole Life Challenge and was craving some chili, but I needed a quick recipe, not a crock pot one. I didn't have chipotle and I can't have Worchestershire, but I substituted coconut aminos for it. I also doubled the recipe, and I am SO glad I did, this chili is FANTASTIC!!!! I feel like I am cheating, it's that good. I topped it with chopped avocado. PERFECTION.

I used this recipe because the spices that I normally use was gone. I wanted to try something a bit different and I had all the ingredients. I used canned chipotle peppers instead of dried. I also made the chili like I normally do by adding beans. I used venison for the meat. Oh, and I also used my own canned salsa. It was a bit more spicy then I'm used to but it was good. I added Greek yogurt to the top to help curb the heat. My boys had seconds.

Could not be a better seasoning combination !! The only thing I added was a can of organic black beans /kidney beans. Also a 1/2 cup beef broth. Then the smallest bit of cinnamon. Honestly we will make this again and again

I hate to be one of those reviewers who make a bunch of changes to a recipe BUT I think it would only be more delicious made as written! I had beef on hand so that's what I used and I omitted the pork sausage (made up the difference with beef) and used only 2/3 of the chipotle pepper in order to keep the heat down for my 3 year old. Also, red and yellow pepper is what I had on hand. It's amazingly flavorful even without the omitted ingredients. I'd love to make a batch for just myself and my husband with all the spicy goodness but don't hesitate to make this for a family of all ages with some slight tweaks. This is going in our regular rotation!!!

This turned out to be one of my best and favorite dishes. But i kind of cheated.

I could not get ahold of a dried chipotle pepper so i just left it out; basically, skipping the first step all together.  When the dish was all done it, whether because i did not add that one cup of water in there or because i'm not a very good cook, it was way too much like a tomato meat sauce.  So all i did was add two cups of brown rice and effectively made jambalaya!  It turned out fantastic and the ratio was just about right.  

Although it was no longer strictly paleo it was still a very healthy dish, especially if you want to load up on some carbs!

I have tried dozens of chili recipes and this is the only one I have returned back to (I love to try new recipes for common dishes) time and time again: it's just that good! All my non paleo friends and family love it and use the recipe too. Since there are no beans I add a large carton of sliced mushrooms to add some texture and variation. I also enjoy spicy so I dice up a jalapeno and sautee it with the onion and bell peppers. I use either ground pork or turkey, and swap different kinds of sausage each time (chorizo is my fave). Contrary to recipe directions, I cook meat separately and drain off fat as I dislike the look and taste of an oily soup. Top with full fat greek yogurt to help with the spice! This is in our rotation for easy Paleo lunches and we make it at least twice a month. 5 stars all the way!

I made this recipe last night for our family and company.  It was so delish! Our 7 year old even loved it, too!  I give it 5 stars for being super quick to make and the perfect warmth and flavor to please the entire family.
(I tossed all the onion and bells (quartered) and whole garlic cloves in the food processor and pulsed 2-3 times-just enough to chop, then added to the browned meat.) I also added 1 can of Chili Beans (making recipe non-paleo)because they've been in my pantry long enough.  Can't wait to make again!!!

Made this for my husband who is keto dieting and he loved it. The only change was beef for bison, and canned chipolte, but other than that followed it to a T. He gave some to friends at work and brought home several recipe requests.

Really good! Different spicing than my usual chili but a nice change!  I used a whole green, red, and orange pepper and omitted the chipotle chili and used ground dried chipotle chili powder instead.  I also used a pound of chicken sausage to cut down on fat and the flavor was still fantastic!

Wow!  Great recipe.  Love the chipotle pepper and Worcesterchire in it!  I used the canned chipotle in adobo sauce, and put in the whole can.  Made it too spicy for the kids to eat, but my wife and I love it!!  Will certainly be making this again.

I made this recipe non-paleo using chipotle Tabasco sauce, added one can of pinto beans and a chopped celery stalk, used grass fed ground beef and pork sausage meat, substituted the green pepper for a cubanelle pepper and to top it off, eight strips of chopped bacon. The cocoa powder is a great flavor addition to this recipe. This is to die for! Definitely serving this with crusty garlic bread and top with green onions, cubed avocado and sour cream. :)

VERY good! The spices are delicious and not just your average chili powder. It was great as is, But I also made some with diced zucchini to ramp up the veggie content and that was great!

Delicious!
I made a few tweaks to allow for GAPS diet, such as omitting the Worcestershire sauce (which there is so little in there for the amount of other ingredients, can't imagine it makes that much difference).  I had planned on using coconut aminos instead and just forgot.  I also used just ground beef, and less chipotle to account for an 8 year old not being able to handle the heat level of the peppers.  Used a variety of yellow, orange, and red pepper (no green pepper).  Recipe turned out great.  Still wound up too spicy for my 8 year old.  Will have to perhaps separate out a portion of everything else for her and cook it separately so my husband and I can still have the wonderful chipotle flavor.  Will be putting this recipe into our regular meal rotation.  Thanks!

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I couldn't find a dried chipotle pepper so I used half a can of the canned ones. I also replaced the Bison with lean ground beef.  The flavor of this dish was amazing and a bit spicy, just the way I like it.  I also added a can of black beans just because I had them.  My husband raved about this, and I have made it twice since I found it a few weeks ago.

Really good. Bison's not in my budget, but otherwise I followed the recipe using lean ground beef. Very good served with some pico and diced avocado.

Very good flavor and easy to make. We don't like a lot of green or red peppers in our chili but I felt I should use one for flavor so I used a small green one. I served over rice even though this is not part of the Paleo concept.

LOVED THIS! I'm doing Paleo for the first time and have never had Chili without beans.. Wow.. still good! :-) I was "cheap" so I did sub the meats for beef and regular sausage... and cheated by putting all in a crockpot to blend and heat after doing the entry browning etc.. YUM! will make again!

Great recipe! Definitely a keeper. Enjoyed the spice mixture with the spicy sausage.
 I added a can of Chili beans and omitted the chipotle pepper

It had a very loose texture and it was definitely lacking with no beans or sour cream. Guess it's just not my cup of tea? Also- what are tomatoes doing in a paleo recipe?

UPDATE:  I made this recipe the second time with 85% fat ground beef and hot Italian sausage.  The cost of the ground Bison is high.  Although the chili was still yummy, the added fat made it a bit too rich.  I'll splurge next time and use bison again.

Great recipe! So easy to make without too many ingredients. I used ground beef instead of the pork and it came out incredible. Both my husband and kids loved it. Served with a little bit of sour cream on top and some tortilla chips on the side. Definitely will be making this on a regular basis.

I added black beans, because chili to me has to have some beans.  Good source of fiber.  I also added sound ground turkey.

Yummmmy!! I used ground turkey instead of bison and regular sausage links. Also used Italian Seasoning instead of Oregano (I was out). Oh, and stewed tomatoes... DELISH!

Y'all, this is a great chili recipe!  As with all recipes, use your judgment about seasoning level.  We found the heat level just right--there, but not too hot.  We did a few changes--all ground beef, subbed out some of the tomatoes for Rotel, since we weren't using sausage; used 1 1/2 tsp. ground chipotle pepper instead of soaked dried peppers;  also subbed in 1/2 the amount of Worcestershire for coconut aminos and 1/2 the amount for fish sauce, due to the soy in Worcestershire and the sugar.  Making these few changes also makes this Whole30 friendly, in case you are looking.  Overall, it was a pretty good bowl of red!

Fantastic chili. I only change a few things, but the seasoning is the key to this chili. I can’t stop eating it, even my hubby loved it. Here are the minor changes I made. I don’t like green peppers, so I used one yellow, one red & one orange. For the chili I used chipotle peppers in a can. I used one without seeds. I used coconut aminos instead of Worcester sauce keeping it paleo friendly. I used grass fed beef & turkey sausage. I only added a can of diced tomatoes, which was the only thing I added. You will love the Smokey chili flavors. I will make this one again.

Worcestershire sauce is not Paleo and most often contains soy and sometimes molasses.  I used Coconut aminos instead with good results.

Delicious and satisfying. I doubled it, used canned chipotle peppers (rinsed them off before cutting), used half crushed tomatoes and half petite cut to make the texture even more interesting. This is one of our favorite meals now.  It freezes well.

I started eating Paleo a couple of months ago, but husband has not. I have made this chili for us twice and his direct quote is "This is the best chili EVER!". We don't miss the beans at all! The second time I made it I didn't have the dried chipotle pepper so I used a few canned chilies in adobo sauce, and it added an extra dimension and spiciness so I'll keep that. I also used hot or mild italian pork sausage.

No joke, I entered this into my office chili cook-off today and won first prize! I do not eat bison, so I replaced it with ground turkey breast. I also did not include dried chipotle pepper because I am a complete wuss with spice! Even without the dried chipotle pepper it had a little spice to it. Definitely going into my permanent rotation!

Wow! I was nervous to try this departure from my normal chili recipe (which includes beans), but it was delicious. I used ground bison in place of the beef, and couldn't find a dried chipotle pepper so I used a canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce instead. The flavors are really wonderful and I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious!  I had trouble finding the chipotle peppers so I used ground ones instead.  Used ground turkey instead of beef (thawed the wrong packages) and it was still yummy.  My new favourite chili recipe.  thank goodness I doubled it. :)

1.27.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235014/paleo-chili/ ... 'Changed, but the same base flavor.  Don't judge.  ;)  Regular oil, a canned chipotle, no meat subbed with one can drained refried beans & one can refried beans.  Ohhh, I added a cup of frozen corn.  Good as is, but could use some diced tomatoes & a jalapeno or two.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Pretty easy to make, I think preparing the Chipotle chili is the toughest part and that's not bad.  How recommend!

I made it... kinda. Used high quality ground beef instead of bison, and skipped on the sausage. (one pound of meat was enough.) Used 3/4 cup of  Bulgur to add a little substance in place of the missing sausage. Subbed in chopped up chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, which I mince in a food processor, instead of dried pepper. In spite of all the changes, was delicious! 

 - update: I now make this recipe a couple times a month, randomly subbing in bulgur or making the recipe as-is. You kinda can't go wrong here. It is so delicious.

This is now a staple in my meal rotations!  I usually use a mix of ground beef and bison, but also venison as well.

Perfect taste! I browned the meat, then put everything into the crock pot on high for 4 hours.  I also added zucchini.  My kids missed the celery that I usually put into my chili.

The absolute best chili I have ever had! People rave about this every time I make it. The flavors are out of this world.  I use grass fed beef instead of bison since I can’t get that in my grocery store and I use regular pork sausage vs the spicy one so the whole family can eat.  You will not be disappointed this recipe, I promise!!

This is an excellent paleo chili recipe!  I don’t like to be the person to change the recipe, but I had to work with what I had in hand.  I didn’t have a chipotle pepper, so I chopped up a jalapeño pepper to give it some heat.  I didn’t have sausage or bison, so I just used one pound of beef and also added a can of diced tomatoes to give it a bit more tomato.  I plan to serve with sliced avocado.

I’ve made many recipes from this site. This is the first one I feel compelled to write about. This Chile ROCKS. I did make two substitutions out of necessity. Couldn’t find a dried chipotle chili so I used a chipotle powder, about 2 Tbsp. Then a splash of soy sauce for the wirechester sauce.

I made this with a couple minor substitutions - things I had in the pantry/fridge vs. having to go shopping.  I used coarsely-ground beef by itself and canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (four with the sauce - I like spicy); otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It may be the best chili ever ate and my husband agrees.  It’s full-bodied and full of flavor. I highly recommend it.

Loved this recipe!  We are on low carb diet & it was perfect.  Only thing I did different was I cooked the ground beef in the microwave instead of on the stove.  I didn't have sausage so I just used beef.  May try a mix of ground beef & turkey another time.  I also used the canned chipotle peppers and they were just fine.  I topped it off with shredded cheese in my bowl and this made it even better!   Thx for sharing.

Followed the recipe exactly, other than I used a canned chipotle pepper - not only THE best chili we ever tasted, but one of the best things I've ever made.  My husband and I hadn't even finished dinner before trying to decide how long to wait till we make it again.

This was really good!! I will definitely make it again! I used beef instead of bison and hot Italian sausage instead of the pork sausage. I cooked the meat separately and drained before adding it to the mixture.  I also used canned chipotle peppers which was so easy and I added a can of kidney beans. I served it with a dollop of sour cream and corn bread. The chili had a kick which we loved, but you can tone it down with mild sausage and a bigger dollop of sour cream. The leftovers today were just as delicious. We made yellow rice and served it over the rice today. Yum!

NOTE! I did make a few minor changes but nothing to take away from the recipe. I could not find chipotle peppers so I used McCormick chipotle/garlic seasoning. I opted out of using the sausage and used 1 1/2 pounds of burger. I also added a can of tomato sauce because I like my chili to be more like soup but other then that followed the recipe. I was very surprised with the outcome not to mention this recipe was so good it compelled me to write my first ever review on a recipe. Will definitely be making again.

I always add 2 tablespoons of good quality Smoked Paprika to any chili recipe, and that takes my chili way yonder over the top!  Simply Organic Smoked Paprika is available at Amazon for the very reasonable price of $5.36 for 2.75oz.  Don't waste your money on any grocery store brand like McCormick, because you will only get "smoke scented" paprika!  It  literally took 1/2 bottle of another brand to achieve the results I get with just 2 tablespoons of Simply Organic Smoked Paprka.  No, I don't have stock in that company, but I am a major fan.  Try it and watch the eyes of your diners open wide as you hear the "mmmmm" sound spread around your dining table!  Oh, sooo good!

By the way, without the quality smoked paprika, this recipe is only 4 stars good.

This was surprisingly delicious! I traded out beef for the bison, and a Chile pepper instead, but other than that, followed exactly! We even waited a day to eat it, and everyone loved it! I did put some sour cream on mine, and I loved the flavors. Will make again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious ... it is still simmering on the stove. You better like chipotle flavor, although I used a pretty large pepper so it is "present" for sure. I also used ancho chili powder - yum! I might add a small can of tomato sauce next time ... or probably just use fresh tomatoes and blanch, peel, and crush them myself. I think it will taste even better that way. Thank you ... :)

I made several changes to this recipe. I substituted chipotle chili powder for the chipotle chili in adobo. I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. Also used canned   tomatoes with garlic. I used Worcestershire pepper in place of the sauce. It turned out fine. I will make this chili again.

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it as written and adjusted it too. It is always good and one of my go to dinner night options because my 5 year old and 3 year old love it too. I have taken this to many parties and even froze it to be reheated for our beach vacation over the summer. Yum. Because my kids like this soo much I adjust some of the ingredients. I will usually add less Chipotle pepper if it is particarily spicy and I don't add the black pepper at the end. I have added many different veggies in this chili and tried different types of sausage (non-spicy versions) and the kiddos gobble them right up each time. We find this even more yummy with sour cream and cheese.

I have made this for a few years but use the canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce and sometimes split it half bison, half ground beef.  I use the slow cooker for 4-5 hours and it's so good.  I won a chili cook-off with this recipe with tons of fans.  I love it!

Delicious.   You would never know it had this many vegetables in it!   This is a great chili recipe for diabetics too, which my dad appreciated.  It does not have much liquid in it, so if you want your chili more like a thick soup, you'll need to add beef bullion and/or tomato sauce (but this will make it "tomatoey").    The only substitutions I made wasI used 1 tsp ground chipotle chili pepper, instead of a re-hydrated dried pepper, and 1 lb of chili meat instead of bison or beef.

Absolutely delicious. Followed the seasonings exactly liked the recipe called for. Spice level was prefect and I do not eat spicy.  I first sautéed everything and then threw it in the slow cooker on high for 2-3 hours to let it simmer and allowed the flavors to meld. Served with cheese and frito chips for other party goers. Hugh hit. Will make again.

This was an ok chili.  The taste of the pork was off putting to me.  I subbed beef for buffalo.  I also first browned and drained the meat, poured the grease out, wiped the pot with paper towels to get the grease out, then cooked the veggies, then combined the meat and veggies. I will cook this again, but will leave the pork out, and probably add more chili powder.  My infant and husband liked the chili, and I thought it was very good with rice, chopped onions, and cheese.

I made this the way it was written with one exception. I used 1 chipotle pepper from the can. It was the perfect temperature for me, although my husband would've preferred it a little spicier. Enjoyed this chili on top of spaghetti squash:)  delicious!

4 stars because this isn't truly Paleo but it is easy to convert by using coconut aminos. First time I followed the recipe with only replacement aminos and I found it a little bland. Next time threw in what I had on hand so added a few diced carrots and an 8oz container of sliced mushrooms. Also used the fire roasted tomatoes and instead of pork sausage bought one of the mild chicken Italian sausages from whole foods fresh section and just opened it up and cooked off the ground meat.  Great staple for Paleo or whole30 program.

Really yummy!!! And easy. I didn't use the dried chili but used some adobe chilis and it worked fine. Also I ran out of cumin so I bet the extra cumin would have added more flavor. All in all - easy and a success and it made a ton! Served with some baked sweet potato fries which were perfect!

This is delicious!  I added beans for the family that was not doing paleo/whole 30.  One big change I would do - drain the meat!  It was way too greasy with the sausage.  Used 90/10 burger instead of bison for cost.

One thing you have to have is the chipotle pepper.  I think that gives the whole dish depth and incredible flavor.  I made this while on a diet and my husband (not on the diet) ate most of it!!

Really good!  Couldn't find dried chipotle pepper so used some canned in adobo sauce....also doubled the recipe and it made a nice batch.  Switched meat choices based on what my local market had and used 1# grass fed beef, 1# organic ground chicken & 16 oz hot pork sausage.  Really great flavor and texture.  Didn't miss the beans and it was very satisfying!  Even my non paleo guests raved!

Loved this!!! So much better than regular chili. Only substitute I did was sun dried tomatoes for dried chipotle pepper. My grocery store didn't have the pepper. My insanely picky six year old like it too and she hates chili?!

Excellent. We don't do tomatoes so I just used V8 juice and tomato paste but it was still delicious. I also used ground pork, ground chicken and ground turkey to give it more paleo cred. :-)

OMG tastes amazing!! I only deviated slightly by adding some white kidney beans (it was all I had), because I'm not on a paleo diet and I love beans in my chili, and I used a small can of chipotle chilis (about 8 small chilis inside), because we love it spicy...it turned out perfect. My Hubbie kept commenting on how well seasoned it was. This recipe was super easy, I'll definitely add this to my regular rotation of dishes.

First off, this chili was delicious. I didn't have a chance to get the bison meat so  I used grass-fed ground beef. The spiciness of the chili was just right and the sausage was a nice addition that gave it more body. I was pleasantly surprised by the cocoa powder in the recipe,and it gave the chili a nice flavor.  I made a double batch and froze up the remaining chili to be reheated another day. I follow a strict paleo diet and can appreciate a great recipe like this one. Thanks again for the great recipe. Paleo for Life!!!!
