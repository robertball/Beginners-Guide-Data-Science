This is the Poppy Seed Dressing that I had on a Fruit Salad in a little bistro in Arkansas. I have been looking for it for a LONG TIME! The fruit Salad had mandarin oranges, pineapple, coconut, and apples in it. This is just the right combination of vinegar, sugar, and poppy seeds to compliment the dressing. Se Monifique!

This is excellent.  I used on a salad of spring greens with maderin oranges and roasted almonds.  I did add some lime juice and cut down a bit on the poppy seeds.  The second time I made it I doubled the recipe so I would have some for later.  Really good, especially if you're on a diet.

This recipe was awsome. My mom loved the lightness of it. I used a little bit of real mayo instead of salad dressing mayo.

Since moving to deep south Texas, I cannot even find poppy seed dressing the super market so I tried this recipe.  It is superb and better than almost all of the commercial versions I have tried.  Thank you so much!

Loved this dressing and used spenda in place of sugar.  Makes for a lower calorie dressing than the others that have oil in them.

This recipe is definitely easy.  I used the regular Miracle Whip.  I tasted too much Miracle Whip.  I'm going to try it again with fat-free.

This is the panera bread fat free/sugar free salad dressing i've been searching for. They stopped selling it two years ago and only offer the salad seasonally. I go through withdrawl over the winter...but not anymore. I use splenda instead of white sugar. Thank you thank you thank you!!

Yum! Great flavor over fresh fruit salad. A tiny bit goes a long way. Kids loved it too, so may use it as a "fruit dip" for snacking.

This is a great dressing for a salad that has fruit and nuts in it.  I substituted orange champagne vinegar for the white and it was a creamy orange dressing.  YUM!

Very similiar to a recipe that I already use: 1/2 C. Miracle Whip (Doesn't have to be Fat-Free) 2 Tbs White Vinegar 1/4 C. Sugar 1/4 C. Milk 1 Tbs Poppy Seeds  Salad: 1 Head of green leaf lettuce, washed & cut 1 Container Strawberries, washed & Hulled OR Raspberries OR Mixed Berries (My favourite is Strawberries) 1 Red Onion, cut into "O"s (Optional: Mandarin Oranges, drained) Mix together.  Add dressing right before serving, otherwise it will be soggy.  SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!

If you like the taste of Miracle Whip (which I do), you'll think this dressing is okay.  I used Miracle Whip Lite.  I think Miracle Whip thinned with milk would have tasted just the same as this dressing. The poppyseeds added visual interest, but no flavor. The sugar and vinegar just counteracted one another. There are more interesting dressing recipes out there, I'm sure.

Good dressing. I'm usually a Hellmann's fan, but I thought this dressing would be good with the tangy zip of Miracle Whip, and it was. I did find that I liked the dressing even better when I doubled the vinegar. This was great on the "Outrageously Good Holiday Salad" recipe from this site.

I love this recipe.  I was out of milk, but had buttermilk, so I used it.  Also, used red wine vinegar.  Delicious!!!  I have been searching for a dressing similar to my favorite salad at Panera, Strawberry Chicken Poppy Seed Salad.  I have finally found it.  I might experiment with adding orange, lemon or lime zest.  I can't wait to have it again.  It will be a new staple for me in the frig.  Thanks!!

This is a great creamy dressing that I've used often to add to cucumbers for cucumber salad. I did use reg. Miracle Whip though and skipped the poppy seeds.

I love this dressing.  Very easy.  I was making a Carribean Jerk salad and needed a dressing.  I did add about 1 TBS of lemon and Lime juices to make it a bit more citrus tasting to compliment my chicken spice.  But it was wonderful the way it was.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

Wow! I was trying to duplicate a recipe I had a a catered event. Lucky me found a winner on the first try. I did use regular Mayo, and half balsamic vinegar/half distilled. I put this on a salad of fresh spinach, red leaf lettuce, fresh strawberries, and sliced honey roasted almonds. Delicious, and yhe whole family liked it!!

You might as well throw some poppyseeds in Miracle Whip. The results would be the same.

I made a salad with this dressing and took it to a family gathering. Everyone loved it, I added a little dijon mustard to the recipe as well but it was good with out it too. My salad consisted of romaine lettuce, spinach, toasted walnuts, craisins, jicima(sp), pears and sharp provolon. I tried the salad the next day without the dressing and it just did not taste nearly as good.

Not bad. It does taste best with fruit in your salad and I used strawberries, mandarin, apple. Too many poppy seeds and needed a squirt of lemon.

This was a good dressing that I will most likely make again.  I omitted the milk (allergies) and used honey instead of sugar.

This dressing is super yummy and a snap to make. I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip (only because I don't like Miracle Whip) and it was delish. Works great with a strawberry, walnut and spinach salad. I always have EVERYONE asking me for the recipe!

I needed poppy seed dressing for this site's Apple Chicken Slaw, so I made this.  I used Hellman's Light Mayo and subbed Splenda for the sugar.   It was a delicious dressing for the salad.

I love it. I attempted to add equal parts green and yellow food coloring, but it turned out too green. I'll use more yellow next time. GREAT stuff.

Very good dressing.  I used splenda instead of sugar.  As others suggested, I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and it was very tasty, low in fat and sugars.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I used apple cider vinegar, rather than white distilled, light mayonnaise added about 1/2 a tsp of onion powder, one teaspoon of Dijon mustard, and left out the milk... it tastes just like what I could buy at the grocery store!!!

I made this dressing to use on a salad made with romaine lettuce, strawberries and vidalia onions. It was perfect! My company raved about the salad. It was so easy to prepare, and will be a standard in my recipe "regulars!"

Used with a spinach, feta, toasted almond salad.  Was GREAT!  But I did feel that next time I would add a little less sugar and I did add about 1t ground mustard which was a very nice addition!  Will be making again!

This dressing tasted great!  I used it on a salad that included chicken, onions, strawberries, and "Sugar Coated Pecans" from this site. My carnivore, meat & potatoes loving husband raved about the salad--which means that it must have been very good! I am trying to find a dressing that tastes like the one they serve at Egg Harbor Cafe, and while this is close, it's not spot on.

Delicious! FUN COMBINATION OF RECIPES HERE: I decided to combine the Poppy Seed Dressing I and II recipes, one being more traditionally vinegrette, and the other more contemporary milky/creamy dressing. Here's what I did: I substituted honey instead of sugar. Then I did the oil and cider vinegar and I used wholegrain dijon mustard and then added the lowfat mayo and milk (but less than the recipe calls for) and blended it together. Then added the poppyseeds later. Delicious mix, making a creamier version of the vinegrette! Great with spinach or other green mix with mandarin oranges, nuts, or other berries, and chicken!

Not bad for such a quick and easy recipe. I only let mine sit about 15 min in the fridge. This was fabulous with strawberries, but lacked when used as a regular dressing as the Miracle Whip taste was strong. Definitely you could cut back on the poppyseeds adn still have plenty, a little goes a long way. Our son used this as a sauce for grilled spicy chicken and loved it. Not bad, but I prefer something that doesn't taste as Miracle Whip-y. Thanks, we still have plenty for another meal.

FAN-TASTIC!!  
This is so tasty on spinach with apples, walnuts and dried cranberries.

After making the recipe exactly as stated, the next time I subbed plain light soy milk for the milk and it came out just like the original.  Also, I used olive oil mayonnaise.

Thanks for a great recipe that is now a staple in my cookbook.  Anything that helps us get all those veggies in is much appreciated!

I made this with Splenda and light mayo, and served it with a really simple salad: baby spinach, strawberries, oranges, and sunflower seeds. It was a HUGE hit at the potluck I took it to. As one person said, "This is the first time I've actually wanted more salad."

Excellent, restaurant quality.  Have passed it along to some of my customers and they love it as well.  Have made it many many times and will continue to do so.  I mixed balsamic vinegar with the white vinegar for a nice flavor.

This is a great, quick, healthy alternative to fattening store-bought dressing.  To further reduce calories, I used a mix of Splenda and sugar.  Also, I substituted apple cider vinegar for the distilled white and cut down a bit on the poppy seeds.  Very nice over spinach with grilled shrimp, sliced strawberries, and purple onion. Add a baked sweet potato on the side, and you've got dinner!

I thought this was terrific, with a few changes. The thought of fat free Miracle Whip did not appeal to me. For full flavor, use the real stuff. Hellmann's Real Mayo is the best! I also used less sugar and less poppy seeds. Turned out great! Much better than store bought.

I wasn't very impressed.  The mayonaise flavor prevailed, and there were too many poppy seeds.  Also, the dressing was way too thin compared to any other poppy seed dressing you would buy at the store.

I did reduce the milk to make it more creamy and I might add a teaspoon of lemon juice after it chills.  I won't have to worry about not finding my favorite at the grocery anymore.  Thank you for a great recipe.

We have a local restaurant that has a blueberry poppy seed dressing which I have always really liked.  So I I added a cup of blueberries to this recipe and it was awesome.

FOR A HEALTHIER VERSION, I USED PLAIN FAT FREE YOGURT INSTEAD OF SALAD DRESSING WITH 1 HEAPING TBSP OF MAYO. SWEETENED WITH 4 PKS SPLENDA. REALLY GOOD.

I made this with Hellman's mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip. I added a large dollop more because it was somewhat runny with the milk. Also used Splenda in lieu of sugar. It was wonderful.

I agree that it tasted too much like mayo and it didn't have enough zing. Maybe it was because I used generic brand mayo instead of one of the name brands?

I love this dressing on salads that have fruit in them. It's quick and easy to make. As long as you have poppy seeds on hand everything else is a staple. I always sub splenda for sugar with no problem.

This was okay served with Parrothead Salad on here.  I'm not the best to review this bc I'm not a big fan of creamy salad dressings, but bf, who likes them, was indifferent too.  Not sure if it's just not flavorful enough for us, or if it was too mayonaise-y, but I think we'll keep searching.  It was a good recipe to try, though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This seems like a good alternative to store-bought low-calorie dressings, but if you're not skimping on calories, you can skip the milk and Miracle whip. I tried processing the sugar and white vinegar (with a bit of Dijon mustard and salt), slowly adding in olive oil, and whisking in poppy seeds last. Wow was it good. I was even able to make small batches in a bowl, whisking the oil in with a fork. I did find it helpful to microwave the vinegar and sugar a bit; it helped dissolve the sugar. Oh, I also noticed that poppy seeds don't keep all that long in the cupboard. I stock up on bulk seeds at the health food store (they're cheaper), and store them in my fridge (or even freezer, for longer).

IMHO this is a mock poppyseed dressing recipe in that it is not made in the traditional method... but that said, it is a great option for when you need a fast fix substitute.  Pleasantly surprised!

Tastes great, the only thing is that the dressing is quite thin. Next time I will try reducing the amount of milk.

I used ingredients as called for, but tested as I went. After 1/2 the sugar was added, it was plenty sweet for me! I used Miracle Whip, which I grew up on (must've been cheap!), but thought this tasted real "Miracle Whip-y". I think next time, I 'll use light mayo-the vinegar & sugar should give it that "tangy zip" and definitely stick with 1/2 the sugar. These suggestions are both personal preferences & I'm sure others would be happy with recipe as written. Thanks for posting!

This dressing was really good.  I used  Splenda instead of sugar and regular mayo.  I might cut back on the poppy seeds a bit, but otherwise, won't change a thing when I make this again and again!

This is TERRIFIC!  I did use regular Miracle Whip, and will every time.  How good is this on fresh fruit!  Amazing, that's how good!  I used it on several things, so far; a tossed salad featuring orange and grapefruit sections, poured over both watermelon and cantaloupe, and as a dip for grapes.  WOW!!

Good dressing.  We used it on a strawberry and nut salad.  I used half mayo and half Miracle Whip because of some reviews I read.  Even with that it tasted strongly of Miracle Whip.  I put a bit of lemon juice in it, and that helped.  Next time I'll use straight mayo.  My family liked it too.  Thanks for sharing!

I found it really good.  I added 1/4 teaspoon salt & another tablespoon of white vinegar because I like it a bit more tangy.  I also omitted the poppy seeds because I was dressing a kale salad & it turned out perfect!

This was good.  It was good as written, but I will make it next time with a little less sugar and less poppy seeds.   Just my preference.

This recipe is extremely heavy on the sugar. I had to add extra vinegar to balance it out - and I even used real mayo instead of Miracle Whip (main difference between that and real mayo: less fat, MORE SUGAR). You could make it with about half the sugar and it would still taste excellent. Overall, it's pretty good, though. Thank you for sharing!
