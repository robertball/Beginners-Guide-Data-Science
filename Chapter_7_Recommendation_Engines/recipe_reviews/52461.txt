This recipe was very good. I've learned from past experiences that Sazon and Adobo seasoning are basically seasoning salts.  So using tomato sauce w/o salt is good, and/or omitting the extra salt "to taste" or even cutting the adobo seasoning in 1/4-1/2 the amount helps out. As a shortcut I boiled the meat for 30 min, then added the potatoes and cooked until tender; it turned out wonderful and saved me 30 min. This is definitely a keeper for the family.

I made this in a slow cooker using the sofrito (also by fivebrig's), and  homemade adobo seasoning. I let this cook about 6-7 hours, adding the potatoes the last hour. I used a chuck roast. This was wonderful with habichuelas guisadas and steamed calrose rice. Leftovers are going to be wonderful with some flour tortillas! I can't say thank you enough for sharing this! :)

I had never had Puerto Rican food before, and this was a perfect experience for me. I do, however, agree that it was salty. My Puerto Rican mother-in-law raved over it. 

I made it in my crock pot, as she suggested and the meat was simply falling apart tender. Will make it again and again.

I has 3 lbs of beef cubes that I had to use up and I wanted to make a delicious prican meal....FOUND IT! First thing I did was sear my adobo seasoned cubes in olive oil to brown all sides (about 15 min total stirring once they were browned). In the same pot I added about 1 cup of water and boiled the cubes for 45 min (kept adding water) and then turn down the heat and simmered for another 45 minutes. Doing that really tenderized my meat. Then I followed the directions exactly. Really flavorful!!! Just like my Mama used to make!!! BUEN PROVECHO!

Very good! I use a 12 oz. can of Coors Light in my carne guisada. It adds alot of flavor and tenderizes the meat.

Wow, I can't believe how close to my mom's beef stew this came!  Very fast to put together. My husband complemented how flavorful it was.  Only changes I made were that I first seared the beef on the stove (lightly seasoning the beef and coating with flour first--which helps to thinken the gravy), and I used low sodium beef broth in place of the water.  My 6 year old is already requesting me to make it again soon.

Great Recipe!  I dredged the meat before cooking, in flour.  That made the sauce a little thicker towards the end so it wasn't so soupy.  I didn't have some of the seasonings so I substituted and it still came out great.  For the sofrito sauce I added 3 TB chopped onion, 1/3 tsp ground corriander, dash oregano and pepper, 2 cloves minced garlic, 2 TB chopped green peppers, 3 TB chopped tomato.  I didn't have any Adobo seasoning, so I just left it out.  I also, by accident, added about 3/4 cup of frozen peas. (I dumped them in thinking I grabbed the frozen chopped onions).  It tasted great and still added some extra veggies to the pot.  I also added 1 cup of chopped carrots about 1 hr before it was done.  The carrots were still firm in the middle and not mushy at all.  I will definetly use this recipe again. I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good :)  I added a carrot for some extra flavor and color.  Easy on the salt, if you're not into saltiness. The seasonings already have salt.

Excellent dish!  This was my first taste of Puerto Rican cooking and I'm hooked.  Very easy to follow recipe and I let it cook in the crock pot (after browning the beef) for 7 hours on low and the meat was so tender and fell apart.  Yum!

I'm Puerto Rican and grew up with this dish. Every family has it's own interpretation on it. Instead of using the Adobo, I add chopped up onions, a few garlic cloves, and Chopped up Green Peppers.  This gives it another level of flavor without having to add any extra salt.  I have also used Beef stock or Beef bouillon when I made a bigger portion for some added flavoring.

A pot of this is simmering as I type.  While living in NYC back in 2000, I had this dish for the first time and instantly fell in love.  After moving back to AZ I couldnt for the life of me remember the name of it, but I did remember it was a Latin stew.  As always, I rearranged the recipe to fit what types of ingredients I have on hand.  Didnt have the sofrito sauce or the adobo and sazon seasonings.  Since these are extremely high in sodium, I figured no harm/no foul.  For the seasonings..I added minced garlic, ground cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, mrs dash, and fresh cracked sea salt and pepper.  For the tomato base...2 cans of tomato sauce, 1 can tomato paste, 1 can diced green chile peppers, and 1 can rotel tomatoes.  I added my seasoning mixture to this tomato base and let it simmer in a large pot for 10 minutes. In saute pan, I browned 2 lbs of stew meat seasoned with flour, mrs dash, cumin, and chili powder.  I added the meat to the tomato mixture and I'm gonna let it simmer for about a few hours and the last hour add some cubed red potato and some sliced carrots..cooking until the potatoes are tender.  Serving with Habichuelas Guisadas and rice.  I will update with the taste results once dinner is served!  Update - Turned out fantastic!! The fam gobbled it up! :)

I absolutely love this recipe!! I found it bored one day taking care of my grandmother with brain cancer who is a very picky eater. She turned her nose up to it when I was explaining what it was to her, but once it started cooking and was done that all changed!! She has requested it several times in the past few months. Only changes i made was I buy the tom thumb premarinated packaged carne asada and cook it in a slow cooker on high for 2hours and low for 2 more hours. Thanks for sharing!!

to make this real puerto rican  carne guisada you have to add a hand full or more (depending on how much you like olives they taste slightly different when cooked) of stuffed olives or green olives with the seeds still in them in the first five minutes while your cooking the sofrito.  other then that this is exactly how my PR native MIL taught me how to make this i add alot more sofrito to the mix *wink cant ever get enough of that Puerto Rican lovin

Love this. It was so good. I omitted the salt as others suggested and it came out perfect thanks for a great recipe. You can also make this same recipe with chicken drummetts. Put them in frozen and you wont have to add hardly any water. Thanks again.

Every loved this meal.  I made some minor changes.  I cooked it in the crockpot and I omitted the oregano and extra salt.  If you're doing it in the crockpot just put the meat and potatoes in the crockpot, stir all the other ingredients together and pour over the meat and potatoes.  I cooked on low for 8 hours.  I also added a chopped onion.  This one is definitely a keeper, and so easy.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I followed it to the letter and dinner was AMAZING.  My mom was super impressed and she is a Puerto Rican cooking QUEEN.  Even she thought the taste was great.  I got rave reviews from EVERYONE.  Thanks for posting.

OK...I just needed to add an update.  I loved the flavor so much I thought to try it again, this time with Chicken.  The only thing I did differently was add a bunch of Cilantro 1/2-1cup and 5 Garlic Cloved (minced). OMG.  it tasted just like my Mom use to make when I was a Kid.

This recipe is absolutely the best.  I have had people asking me for this recipe on several occasions.  Try it.  It super easy and extremely yummy.

The longer you cook the more tender your meat chunks become.  I make a guisada similar to this.  My PR relative adds Goya capers and olivers and a cup of red wine> delicioso!

I tried this about a month ago. It was fantastic and I will be making it again this week. My bf is P.Rican- he also loved it. The meat is very tender and the spices make it very appetizing. It isn't very expensive to make, assuming you already have most of the spices. My bf's mom makes sofrito on a regular basis and always gives me a big container of it. I put about 1/3 cup into individual plastic bags, refreeze, and use whenever I need it.

Very good. I added 2 cans of tomato sauce, 2 cups of water and baby carrots. I put frozen beef cubes in the crock pot and added all the ingredients(did not add salt) and cooked on high for 3 hrs, turned to low and cooked for 6 hours. The meat was so tender. Reminded me of beef stew.

My family enjoys this meal often. I add a dash more oregano, some corn, carrots and peas to give it an even heartier taste. I sprinkle some fresh chopped cilantro on top of each serving. WONDERFUL TASTE AND SMELL THROUGHOUT HOUSE!

Everyone in the family loved this. I made my own adobo and sazon powders because the versions I found in the store all had MSG and lots of other weird chemicals. Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as directed and it was perfect!

This was delicious.  I've been trying to cook more Puerto Rican meals for my husband since that is what he grew up with as a child.  I used homemade sofrito sauce that I already had made.  I didn't have potatoes so I could not add those, but it still turned out great.  I browned the meat before adding it to the sauce mixture.  The meat turned out so tender.  I saved some for lunch tomorrow.

SOOO GOOD!!I added a bit of cilantro at the end and it came out great. I didn't have any homeade sofrito but the frozen GOYA brand worked out just fine. I added some carrots along with the potatoes. Everyone loved it.

This is just as good with chicken!  I sauteed chicken strips in a large pan using this recipe.  I taste as I cook and realized that the sauce was a bit salty so I added more water to my liking.  The chicken was tender and very flavorful!  I made it with Puerto Rican Steamed Rice from this site.  Great meal!

My boyfriend is Puerto Rican and he misses tasting food from home. I have been trying different recipes to help him get over his cravings. He loved this one. The only thing he said was missing is some caramelized onions. So next time I will add onions. Thank you for posting the recipe.

I have used this recipe multiple times, such great puertorican flavor!  I have cooked it with beef stew and pork chops too, works well with either, I also throw in a chopped onion for more flavor, thanks for sharing this recipe.

I don't understand how I would brown the meat in the sauce, so will sear the meat first, remove it from the pan, and then cook the sauce and proceed. I can't wait to try it.

I'm from PR and this was very close to my mom's recipe; except for the saltiness.  Next time I'm going to use low salt options, if available, i.e., tomato sauce.  I'm hoping to find low salt versions of the Goya Sazon packets and the Adobo seasoning.

There was not enough sauce to go with the meat and potatoes. I had to double all the ingredients except the meat. It was also way to salty. This is not a true puerto rician dish. This tasted horrible and I didn't even add the salt when it said salt to taste.

Thank you Fivebrigs for this recipe.  It is definitely in my top ten recipes from allrecipes.  My family loved it.  The meat was flavorful and tender, the potatoes as well, and the sauce was nice and thick.  We're I'm from, there's a strong influence of Puerto Rican culture and the food is incredible.  This might be the best Puerto Rican dish I've tasted to date though. Again, big hit in my house.  Thanks!  I did add 2 garlic cloves 1 tbsp garlic powder to this dish.  I also added red pepper flakes for some heat.  Perfection.

This was good, not great.  Very good flavor but needed more sauce.  I will try it one more time, possibly in the slow cooker.

Delicious!  I added a touch of cumin, garlic, diced bell pepper, and onion.  Reminded me of food I used to buy in NY. It's very hard to find authentic Puerto Rican food in Georgia.

After our family vacation to Puerto Rico, we all came back craving the food.  I found this recipe and with one small change (I add carrots) it has worked it's way into our slowcooker meal rotation and we have this at least once a month.  Excellent the first time around as well as left overs.  Thank you for the helpful tips for the sofrito and adobo.

My hub gives this a 5; I'd give it 4.5-ish.  It was really good, and reminded me of my Spanish missionary days.  I used it as a way to use up some leftover roasted chicken, so really it was Pollo Guisado. :) I let the chicken "cook" for 30 min, and then added the potatoes for an additional 15-20 min on low.  I added cilantro as a garnish, and I thought it really added to the dish, but my husband preferred it without.  
Overall, this was great!

Soooo good. I've made this on the stove and in the crockpot and it tastes great both ways. I added some green pepper, onions, and fresh parsley. This recipe is definitely a regular in my house.

Great recipe! Simple to make, did take others advice and reduced the salt (adobo & sazon) by half. Cooked in the slow cooker on high for six hours, added potatoes last hour of cooking.

Made my own sofrito sauce from recipe on this site and used my own versions of sazon seasoning and adobo. Other than that, followed the directions as written and it turned out great. We enjoyed it as a stew, shredding the meat to soak up more of the sauce. Then I used the leftover meat later in flour tortillas, topping with a homemade green chili pork sauce to change the entire meal into one with more of a Mexican flavor. It was delicious this way, too. Great recipe.

I found this recipe to be perfect.  The key is to follow the recipe directions and not deviate from the ingredients list.  As someone of Puerto Rican descent that has recently begun to bring back some of the traditional meals I remember as a kid, this recipe is a keeper.

I followed the directions to a tee except I used canned potatoes because I hate peeling them.  This was easy and it is so tasty.  I found a new dish that even I can cook!

This was easy and good though a little too salty (and I didn't add any salt).  Maybe I did something wrong but it was good enough to make again.

This recipe is nothing short of amazing!!! I added some carrots to the recipe (just because I love carrots in everything), but this recipe is perfect. It reminds me of the carne guisada they make at "Caridad" Restaurant in New York. I will follow this recipe for many years to come. Oh, and my boyfriend loved it!  Thanks!!!

I’ve made this dish many times and even my Puerto Rican mother in law loved it! Sometimes I’ll add different veggies if I have it on hand. I usually add fresh garlic since everything is better with garlic. I use the instant pot and sauté the meat first then add the rest of the ingredients and set it for about 30-45 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent!  I read several of the reviews before starting out to avoid any missteps.  Followed the ingredients but switched up the cooking order a bit. Seasoned and floured the beef and browned it. Took the beef out and sweated 1/2 onion and two cloves garlic.  Then I added the rest for the sauce. I put the meat back in and continued on. I added a bay leaf. To finish, added 1/2 c green olives. This was an excellent meal.

Oh man. This was a perfect dish and anything that pleases the Hubby is great! I cooked it a little quicker by slightly cooking the meat and boiling a pot of potatoes at the same time.  In the end, everything was mixed together and poured over white rice. Thank you!

My boyfriend said it's one of the best meals he's ever had! However, I felt that a tablespoon of adobo seemed like too much, so thankfully I checked out the reviews and many people said it was salty, so I used a teaspoon of Adobo instead, and it was perfect! Very very flavorful!

This was a very good recipe, but I did make a few changes. Since we have a family of eight I had to double the ingredients. I also added one can of El Pato tomato sauce, which gave it a little heat, and used boneless round steak. Next time I will add carrots and celery. As a previous reviewer said, DO NOT add salt. It is very salty on it's own with the sazon seasoning.

This is a really great recipe the best way to prepare it is a slow cooker. The beef if very tender and the flavor is just like what I have had in San Antonio Texas.

This recipe was a simple and delicious stew! The meat was full of flavor and very tender. I used red potatoes because they hold their shape nicely. The sauce was a little salty, so next time I will cut back on the Adobo seasoning by by 25%-50%. This will definitely become a regular dish in my household. Goes well with arroz con gondules, too!

I live in Puerto Rico and I make my own sofrito, add this, also I add carrots and calabaza aka pumpkin.  The local kind, not the big round orange ones like in the states.  Other than that I pretty much make it just like this in my pressure cooker and yum!!

The proportions and basic recipe were good. I had to reduce the salt. Commercial sazon and sofrito usually have added MSG, so I replaced sofrito with homemade sofrito (basically chopped onion, garlic, pepper and cilantro, available on this site) and sazon with a combination of cumin, turmeric and  coriander.

This is one of my favorite go-to dinners, especially in the winter.  My family loves it served with yellow rice.  I put all the ingredients in a slow cooker and let simmer all day.  I also substitute the beef cubed for pork cubed.  Both ways are great.

A wonderful recipe. The only thing is it was a tad too salty but i think that was my fault and not the recipe. I made a minor modification to the recipe in that i salted and peppered the steak and browned it in the pot before i did anything else (in batches) and i think this is where the majority of the salt came from. I also added a touch to much water and during the last 30 minutes (when you put in the potatoes) i left the lid partially uncovered. I guess it depends if you want more of a soup or a gravy. I wanted a gravy. My  wife absolutely loved this dish. I made it with Arroz con gandules. This recipe will for sure be added to my repertoire.

Like everyone else says, don't add the extra salt. You don't really need it. Also I added a can of dark beer when the meat was cooking to tenderize it a little. Overall, my friends think I'm a genius at cooking because of this recipe!

I am Puerto Rican and let me tell you this recipe is GREAT! The only adjustments I made were that I doubled the tomato sauce, I browned the meat as suggested and then lowered the heat to simmer for 2-3 hours so the meat comes out tender. Also, I added all veggies as I was browning the meat so they could soak up the flavors and my veggies never come out mushy. I make some white rice on the side and you can also make some plantains as a side dish either sweet or not. For those saying it is too salty well Latin food is very flavorful, this dish doesn't really require you to use salt if you opt not to or taste the sauce as it cooks (once you meat is cooked) and add as you go along. A BIG BIG BIG thank you to FIVEBRIGS for posting this, it has become a family favorite!! I wish I could post a pic, but I made 3 pounds of stew last night and there are no leftovers ;-)

Well, this recipe managed to impress our most picky eater in the family, although I had to make several alterations to the recipe to fit our dietary requirements.  I left out the potatoes because we have to watch our carbs, and I also substituted venison for the beef for cholesterol purposes.  I added a chopped onion and jalapeno just for texture, and I also put in a few tsps of adobo sauce for extra heat.  It seems like a lot of changes, but I'm sure they did minimal to the overall taste of the recipe as written.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again and soon!

I added Adobo to the meat and let it sit overnight. I seared the meat after sprinkling with flour.  I then added the rest of the ingredients and also added beef bullion and diced tomatoes.   My family would like for me to make it again!

Great recipe! I omitted the salt and added Carrots, chopped onions, one cup of water and cooked it on low heat for 5 hours in my Dutch oven.  Meat was very tender and good. I would like to see a recipe for arroz con gandules.

Oh my...this is delicious!  Delicious isn't even the word!  The meat is fantastic, very tender, the sauce is yummy.  The only changes I made were omitting the salt and increasing the sofrito by a little bit (personal taste).  The smell was amazing in my house while this was cooking, my mouth was watering.  My kids gobbled it up.  Boyfriend hasn't tried it yet but I don't care, it gets 5 stars from me and I'm sure he's going to LOVE it.  Thanks for sharing.

I used cubed pork tenderloin (because that is what I had) dredged in flour before browning,and cooked it in the sauce in a slow cooker on low for 6 hours. I also added sliced carrots and potatoes during the last hour. Delicious! Thanks for the post.

1-1-2016 - This recipe is very good and has always been a go to recipe especially during fall/winter months. The only thing I would change is reducing the amount of sazon and adobo to 1/2 of what the recipe states for those who find it too salty. Personally, I make my my own sazon dry mix sometimes to reduce the salt. You can also use low-sodium/no sodium tomatoes. UPDATE: 3-6-18 - I have been making this recipe for a while, but make my own sazon and the Sofrito by Fivebrigs. Tonight, I made this in the instant pot and it was excellent! The overall flavor infused more and even into the potatoes. So easy to make and delicious as always!

Great recipe. I've made the recipe many times now and my family really enjoys it. It reminds me of a dish my mother-in-law (who's no longer with us) used to make. Sometimes I add carrots to the dish as well.

This dish competes with the "Mom and Pop" Puerto Rican joints in the area. My father was Puerto Rican so I grew up on this stuff...tastes just like my father used to make!  Please post more recipes. :)

I tried this recipe in the crock pot, and followed directions to the letter. I think my crock pot is on the large side, and I added water to cover the meat. I think it turned out a bit watery. I had never had "carne guisada" and wanted to try a new recipe for my Puerto Rican husband. It tastes like the good ol American version of beef stew, in my opinion.

This was not like the Carne Guisada I am used to but it was really good!!!

My kids even ate it and loved it.  It was not even too spicy with the jalapenos.

Perfect!!  I made this recently for my Puerto Rican husband and he said it was beyond good and very authentic..very similar to what he raised on.  It's really good with the steamed rice (also on this site!).

This was superb.  I also omitted the salt, and since my husband has high blood pressure and needs to reduce sodium, in future I'll reduce the adobo also.  It was a big hit in our house.  I used my Puerto Rican neighbour's home made sofrito that she kindly gave me.

Just like I have had in the past!  I cooked without salt but ended up sprinkling it on because I like this dish a bit salty and it has always been that way when I have eaten it before.  Meat was so tender and and I added 1 cup of carrots as well.  Next time I'll add more potatoes and carrots because there seemed to be a lot of meat.  I ate this over the steamed rice, delicious!

This is my favorite beef stew recipe with the addition of 1/2 cup white wine with the other liquids. I serve it over rice cooked with red beans.

This was just what I was looking for! A friend of mine recently made this for me and I loved it so much but she did not want to reveal the recipe when I asked for it! I knew I could count on allrecipes to find something. I made this as written but also added about 4oz. manzanilla olives and 7oz. pigeon peas, which my friend also included in her guisada - sounds like an odd combination (which I also thought at first) but it tastes great. Although I don't mind salty dishes, this was a little too much on the salty side so next time will use tomato sauce without salt added, as someone else suggested. Thanks!

I have had this dish with Spanish friends. I followed this recipe and it was outstanding. I cooked it in the slow cooker like other reviewers - also used Crockpot Liners from Reynolds - easy clean up.  I accidentally bought Recaito Seasoning from Goya (thinking it was Sazon). But it worked just as well. I also pureed some Italian pepper, green pepper & red pepper to kick up the heat a little. Fivebrigs, please add more recipes!

i love carne guisada and this is the best i've ever tasted. i live in brownsville, texas - very close to the mexican border and so there's many authentic mexican restaurants around here. to be honest with ya'll this recipe is more delicious than the carne guisada here in town. i took the advise of the other reviewers - i didn't use salt at all since the other ingredients have plenty of salt in it. Also I boiled the meat for 30-45 min and it came out great and tender. my hubby and friend really really love this recipe. i served it with spanish rice, re-fried beans, and guacamole. it was GREAT!!

I have been making carne guisada forever but it is never consistent. This recipe uses the same ingredients that I use except that now I know how much or how little or something I need to put. As for the other ratings I agree that salt is not neccessary. I am originally puerto rican and cook puerto rican food almost everyday and I never use salt. This is a great recipe and I hope to see more like this on allrecipes.com.

This was a great recipe - my husband considers himself an expert on Carne Guisada.  He did suggest the next time I make it to add some jalapeno, onion and a small amount of bell pepper.  Overall, this is a great dish, but I have to agree with him, it does need just a little "boost" in the flavor department.  This was very simple to throw together the night before ( I put everything in a ziplock bag so that the flavors could blend overnight).

Omitted the salt as suggested by most and used only one pound of meat because i like the extra sauce. Served with white rice and tostones. Otherwise followed recipe as written. It was very good, very authentic, not salty at all.

Very Good!!  Like other reviewers said, it's a little on the salty side so DON'T add extra salt.  You might also want to cut the adobo seasoning in half.  I love salty food and it was just a touch too salty for me even.  I will cut back on the adobo next time.  It was SO delicious though.

This recipe is easy to follow and the taste was fantastic!  I do however agree with the other reviewers to eliminate the extra salt.    Having lived in Puerto Rico, it's nice to find recipes that are authentic and not too "touched" up---which changes to dish entirely!  Thanks for sharing!  :o)
