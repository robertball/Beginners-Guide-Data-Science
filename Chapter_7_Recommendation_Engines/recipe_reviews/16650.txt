My thanks to the writer of this recipe. If I could re-write this I would call it "Stuffed Cajun Sea Chicken" but I want to give credit where credit is due and that is to the idea itself, as with many recipes that are like an artist's canvas. I did make numerous changes. I used fresh crab instead of canned. I added garlic to both sauce and stuffing. I used seasoned bread crumbs. I added minced onion and fresh minced mushrooms to sauce and fresh sliced mushrooms in stuffing which i sauted with the onions and butter. I used Wondra instead of flour. I used Old bay instead of paprika and I used creole seaoning in sauce as well as sprinkled on top before serving. I cut split in side of breast and stuffed instead of pounding and rolling and I cooked for 45 minutes and then an additional 10 uncovered with cheese on top.

Very good! I made several alterations however....I used clam juice leftover from another recipe instead of chicken broth, seasoned bread crumbs for the saltines, I slit pockets instead of pounding & rolling, used half & half for milk, used Old Bay seasoning instead of salt & upped it to a full tsp., & increased the baking time to 50 minutes  since the breast were so much thicker. They looked good enough for company & tasted even more impressive. I served them w/ boiled baby yukon potatoes & a fresh salad.

This review will be a great example of how it's all about taste buds. I thought this a very average dish, and would rate it three stars. Hubs, on the other hand, said it was darn near a five star dish. The chicken breasts I used were small, so I just pounded them out a bit, spread a double amount of the crab mixture over them and didn't bother to roll them up. I seasoned the chicken first with salt and pepper. I added some extra melted butter and shredded Swiss to the crab mixture, as well as a few tablespoons of finely chopped green and orange bell pepper. I also used fresh mushrooms, chopped, rather than the canned. I skipped the step of heating the mixture through--its stint in the oven takes care of that. To the white sauce I added some white wine, then followed the baking directions as written and came up with beautifully cooked, moist and tender chicken--didn't even need a knife.  While I found this short on flavor, hubs said he appreciated the subtleness of flavor. Very reminiscent of Chicken a la King. With our different taste buds and assessments, I arrived at a compromise of four stars.

Great recipe!  I also added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onion and used bread crumbs instead of saltines.  I added some spice to the white sauce but didn't notice a huge difference.  I substituted Old Bay for paprika and used a different white cheese.  My husband said to make it anytime.  We loved it!  Thanks for posting.

YUM! This recipe is awesome. It tastes so good and is easy to prepare. I am going to make this a meal that I make often. I used the imitation crab that is frozen and is a great price rather then spending a lot of money since crab has a mellow taste.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted the mushrooms for red and green bell peppers that I sauted with the onions.  It was a nice touch.  I also added a little Old Bay seasoning to the  crab mixture; it tasted like a crab cake stuffed chicken breast.  Thanks for sharing.  I'll be making this again.

This made me a star for the night! It was wonderful and will definitely make this again in the future. 
Timesaving hint: use one can of cream of chicken soup for the sauce and add milk to thin it since it thickens while baking.

Followed the recipe exactly, WONDERFUL!  5 STAR!  It's a keeper, whole family loved it, my husband thought is was fabulous, and my 8 year old and 3 year old enjoyed as well.  Has some stuffing left over, sprinkled a little swiss cheese in it and served it with crackers as an appetizer!

this was fantastic!!  i altered mine a bit from the recipe however.  i chopped shrimp instead of crabmeat along with parsley, mushrooms, and green and red peppers in a processor, and i stuffed the mixture along with the onions, and breadcrumbs into slits in the tops of the breasts.  i also smeared the rest of the breast with the mixture, and covered with parmesean cheese, instead of swiss - i highly recommend it!!

Very delicious... Made just as listed except had to leave out the mushrooms cuz I didn't have any.  Next time I may substitute the "white sauce" for cream of chicken soup dilluted with a bit of milk or water, just to save myself some time.  5 Stars all the way!!

I have to start this review saying I'm only giving the chicken 3 stars it was a little bland a bit heavy for me with the cheese, but I had so much stuffing left over I added an egg, panko crumbs, and old bay seasoning and fried these into crab cakes in some olive oil. Served up with a basic remoulade sauce (ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce, few tblsp mayo, lemon juice), and oh my, they were some tasty crab cakes!!

Love the recipes.  I was wondering about those toothpicks but that held the inside ingredients together once cooked.  I was thinking I just had to slice and add crab meat until I saw all those ingredients to mix together and sauce. I had to double my sauce because i had two cans of crab meat.  I will be using one can next time.  My son was like mom we never had this before and he hate two of them.  Thanks for delicious recipe.

I was really looking forward to making this chicken recipe as I love a rich, flavorful stuffed chicken. I made this per the recipe, with the exception of pocketing the chicken breasts instead of pounding and rolling them, but the effect is still the same. Unfortunately, I could only give this recipe 3 stars because the stuffing just didn't have the rich flavor I was hoping for. It was in fact, a bit bland, with most of the flavor coming from the swiss cheese and paprika topping. I may still make this again, but with some tweaking to the original recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  

The crab mixture was wonderful (I did use fresh mushrooms and fresh crab instead of canned) and the sauce was great - make sure you boil it so it starts to thicken or use half and half, instead of milk if you like a thicker sauce.  

I had halibut on hand so I used that instead of chicken but I'm sure it would have turned out the same (great).  I will be making it again, probably it try with chicken or even with salmon!   

Two thumbs UP!!

Delicious!  I will certainly use the crab stuffing in many other recipes.  It's simple and oh so delicious!  I baked this in the toaster oven, simply because it's too hot this summer to turn on the oven.  Set it at 350, cover and bake chicken as directed for 30 minutes.  Remove cover and set oven to the broil setting for 10 minutes.  A very easy, very delicious dinner, that turns plain, old chicken into a new delight!

Very good and easy!  Definitely use fresh mushrooms, sauteing them w/ the onions. I will add garlic and a little bit of Old Bay next time. Everyone loved this!

These are delicious! I sauteed the onions and also sauteed some mushrooms. Added swiss cheese and a couple of crushed townhouse crackers to bind the whole cream cheese/crab mixture together. I also used Panko bread crumbs for extra crispness.  This is even better with a white wine cream sauce served over the top. Thanks for the recipe. It gives me even more ideas of different cheeses and maybe even bacon inside next time :0 Yum.

This dish is delicious and makes a beautiful presentation. Another way to present is to cut a rather deep slit in the top of the breast and spoon the stuffing mix inside. No saltines in the house, so I used bread crumbs. Yummy! A touch of Old Bay in the mix is very good, too. A white sauce with a hint of dijon tops it off perfectly.Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was only ok.  My husband said he liked it, but didn't eat all of his chicken, so maybe he was only being nice.  I think the key to making this better may be to get a good quality crab meat.  I got the best canned crab I could find, but this would likely be much tastier with the crab you get from the meat/seafood counter.

We enjoyed these, but felt the white cream sauce was really lacking in flavor.  The stuffing was fantastic!!  I used Old Bay, as others suggested to give it more of a crab cake flavor, also.  I'll give this recipe another try, using clam broth as another suggested.

I was really surprised at how good this was! It does taste like a crab cake stuffed chicken breast. Chicken was juicy but a little bland, maybe marinate before? or poke holes in so sauce can run through? Either way I highly recommend!

Very tasty! Took reviewers advice added Old Bay seasoning instead of salt and pepper, used Cheezit crumbs instead of saltines, and added mushrooms to sauteed onions.   Slit and stuffed breasts rather than pounded and rolled then bake for 50 minutes before topping with cheese.  Only suggestion from my family was another can of crab!  Will definitely make again!!

This was one of the best dinners ever.  I did use a pound of fresh crab so I needed to use more of the cream sauce to hold the mix together.  I added shrimp & asparagus to the top before sprinkling with the cheese & everyone was extremely impressed with the meal.  I will make this many more times.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe...as is...accept I salted and peppered the pounded chicken breasts before stuffing...maybe everyone just knew to do that, but I've made recipes similar before and the chicken was always pretty blah without seasoning the meat inside and out.....anyway...we liked it so much that I made it with haddock and stuffed it with ground up lobster dainties (I didn't have any more crab meat)...everything else the same.....It was the best stuffed haddock ever....thank you so much for this keeper recipe...

awesome recipe! i used fresh crabmeat instead of canned (backfin). i just made sure i picked out all of the shell fragments. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of saltine crackers, and i omitted the parsley only because it doesn't suit my palate. i substituted the fresh parsley for dill. instead of swiss cheese, i used shredded parmesan, and did use paprika, but also added old bay seasoning. the old bay is a maryland thing. i plated the final dish with linguine tossed with spinach and homemade alfredo sauce and basil.

This was good but not as great as I thought it would be the stuffing could have used a bit more flavor. But it wasn't bad!

These were great!  I needed six chicken breasts so I doubled the filling amount and used a whole container of fresh mushrooms.  I sauteed the mushrooms with the filling until they softened a bit and then spooned six large mounds of the filling in my casserole dish.  Then instead of rolling the chicken, I laid each pounded breast over the filling mound and tucked the edges under.  I baked it halfway and then put the white sauce over the chicken because I didn't want the sauce to break down.  With these slight changes I thought it turned out great.  The only thing that I will add next time is to season the chicken before I bake it and add a little salt to the white sauce.

Not bad, took the idea of adding the cajun seasoning which helped both the white sauce and stuffing.  Kind of tasted like a crab cake stuffed inside a chicken breast.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!  This tasted heavenly.  I made only one chanage, that of fresh mushrooms.  Everything else was done according to the recipe.  There are few dishes that I really enjoy after doing all the cooking but this one was a delight to my taste buds.  I had homemade coleslaw on the side and made pineapple sour cream pie for dessert.  My guests were very appreciative of my efforts.  Kudos to my friends at Allrecipes.

wonderful dish and my family enjoyed every bite. Instead of paprika I used Old Bay and I couldn't find shredded cheese so I used sliced and in the white sauce I added fresh onions and mushrooms and and extra tablespoon of the white sauce to the stuff. Truly a delicious and easy to make meal

Great recipe. I did make a couple of alterations though. I like very creamy sauce, so I used Cream of chicken Soup instead of making the white sauce. I also used imitation crab meat and fresh mushrooms. Even my picky little three year old son loved it!

I loved this recipe, especially since I cook for a man eats only meat, bread, and dairy. I did make quite a few alterations though. I used imataion lobster meat that I think tastes quite good. I left out the mushrooms. No veggies allowed. I used green onions sauted with fresh garlic and squirted in a little lemon juice. I left out the cracker crumbs because I find they end up sougy and bland. I also lighty breaded the outside of the chicken with the bread crumb, flour, and lemon pepper and fried the breast before a quick bake.  The white sauce essentialy turned out to be butter for me. The man loved it and it was quick and easy to make. It was very rich with all the butter though. I would make it again, maybe with less butter.

This was delicious!  I used some heavy cream instead of milk, added about 1 TB of fresh dill and used fresh mushrooms.  Instead of pounding out the chicken, I left them thick and cut a slit and put the stuffing inside the breasts.  I added the cheese and paprika and baked, covered for about 45 minutes.  This was quite rich using the heavy cream.  Next time I think I will just use whole milk.

This was quite good.  I used an eight ounce plastic container of crab because the canned crab taste like just what it is, canned.  I did add minced garlic and a bit of Blackening Seasoning to the stuffing for just a slight kick and used fresh portabellini mushrooms.

I thought these were good, although the taste of the canned crab was a little metallic.  Next time I would use lump crabmeat.  My family liked it okay, but we did think it was a little heavy.  Instead of rolling, I sliced a core in the middle of the chicken breast and stuffed it with the filling.  I also doubled the stuffing and baked it for about 45 minutes.

This was a wonderful recipe!!  I substituted a few items including fresh mushroom instead of canned mushrooms and I also added 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  I put the onion, mushrooms, garlic, and parsley into my food processor until the ingredients became a fine mixture.  This was so easy to make and I enjoyed every bite.

This recipe was elegant but fairly simple. I prepared a day ahead and baked before our dinner. I also used cheddar instead of swiss and added some cheese to the white sauce as well. It was a hit with my guests.

I just made this for our 7th anniversary dinner and it was incredible! My husband raved that it was the best chicken he'd ever eaten. I know it's true because he actually brought leftovers to work the following day -- a first! I substituted the saltine crackers with Italian breadcrumbs, and I also used half Swiss and half Fontina cheese instead of all Swiss. I can't imagine it being any better! I made this after work on a weeknight -- it takes a little more time than I typically spend during the week, but is fairly simple to prepare. If you have friends over for dinner, you won't be chained to the kitchen if you serve this.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I read a few of the reviews before preparing my meal and learned that others felt it was a bit bland. I used seasoning salt and garlic pepper on the chicken; Old Bay, crushed red pepper, a pinch of salt, and lemon pepper on the crab meat.  I didn't add any seasoning to the white sauce-and am glad that I didn't-nor did I use the Swiss cheese.  I opted for Parmesan cheese instead.  I served this with green beans and flavored rice.  It was really good!  My boyfriend wants me to make more.  Thanks for posting this recipe for us!!!!

This was good. It wasn't to die for, but it was good. I am going to suggest more crab in the filling and more cream sauce because mine was dry till I added more of the sauce. I would also suggest some garlic. It's rather plain and bland, but still good. I'm thinking maybe some cream cheese, crab, garlic and..something else but I don't know what. It's a good base for something else.

This was kind of boring.  I would have liked this in an alfredo sauce or something.  More crab needed.  On the positive the chicken was tender and moist.

This was really, really good.  I did make some changes, though.  To start - I sauteed finely chopped onion and celery in butter with a little white wine.  Once tender I added the crab, ritz cracker crumbs, fresh parsley, s&p, old bay and some finely chopped fresh mushrooms.  Set aside.  Used the same pan to make the sauce - I did use chicken stock, but also white wine and half and half.  Added old bay, red pepper flakes.  Split the chicken breasts, stuffed and then used the remaining stuffing to make stuffed mushrooms - AMAZING.  Thanks for the great inspiration!

Awesome! I threw in some garlic lemon, and some thyme as well.  Used imitation crab instead of 25 dollar a pound flaked crab that probably should only be used in a dish by itself! Great recipie.

I'm not the one who usually cooks in the house and my wife said she was "impressed" by this meal.  Once my kids tried it, they loved it too. The sauce was a difficult to make for a first-timer like me, as there seemed to be more flour than could be absorbed by the butter. I used too much butter and it could be tasted in the sauce.  Because I have problems with high blood pressure, and the crab has plenty of salt already, I substituted crackers with lower salt content (OTC crackers and wheat thins) for the saltines that were recommended in the recipe. Actually, I'd suggest removing as much salt from the recipe as possible, otherwise you'll be able to taste it slightly in your meal.
Overall, this was a great recipe. The meal was delicious and my family was pleasantly surprised. I'd make it again... and again!

Crab and fish good... Crab and chicken bad.  In theory this sounds good, but getting down to the eating- I don't like it.  But KUDOS to the first person that melted swiss cheese on the top of chicken.  That's tasty.  Trust me on this- there is nothing wrong with the recipe, it just doesn't taste good!

I substituded 1/2 cup of white wine for the chicken stock,  and used 1 cup of milk. This also makes a great stuffing for fillet of sole or other white fish!

I was really looking forward to this meal, but was quite disappointed with the outcome. The combination just didn't work well--maybe it was the type of fresh crab that I used? Easy recipe to follow, just nothing I will attempt again.

I made this for my parents' anniversary - they went to Williamsburg, Virginia for their honeymoon and this recipe captured that happy time.  I made it again a week later for dinner guests - a true keeper.

I loved loved loved this recipe. There is one suggestion I will make though. I substituted the crackers with bread crumbs as someone else had recommended. I would not recommend this. It causes the crab to taste more like stuffing but otherwise...great!!

This recipe was just DELICIOUS. I did a couple of changes however. I used Old Bay in place of Paprika, and we used much more crab meat than specified. With the extra crab meat/onions/etc, we mixed it in with the sauce and topped the chicken breasts with it. It was excellent.

we liked it pretty well. I did add some onion and garlic powder to the sauce and stuffing. You couldn't taste the crab that much. I might try using something else in the stuffing next time.

I made this recipe, but I made one major change.  I used a white wine sauce instead of the white sauce and cheese.  I also did as another user suggested and just cut a slit in the chicken breast to stuff the crab mixture into instead of rolling it up.  It turned out delicious.  By using the white wine sauce and using all fresh ingredients instead of canned it really gave it the extra flavor that many of the reviewers said it was missing.  I am going to use this recipe at my next dinner party.

This dish was good, but I decided it is more of a start point for experimentation. It is moist and tasty, however, for the cost of the crab, I couldn't really taste it. Other fillings come to mind such as ham, chopped broccoli, or spinach. I think I would change the filling and add seasoning to the sauce. Everyone enjoyed it. We served it with a wild rice mix.

Not bad!!!  I changed this recipe around a little.  Used green onions, buttered crackers, garlic chicken broth, a dash of cayenne pepper and provolone/monterey cheese.  I also didn't pound and roll the chicken - I just cut a "pouch" in it, stuffed it and topped with sauce and cheese.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes!  I was surprised we could actually tast the crab - as canned is not nearly as flavorful as fresh!  Thanks!

We really liked this!  However, I did make some changes.  I added 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning to the white sauce and extra soup base to the chicken broth.  Also, I used fresh mushrooms plus added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and cajun seasoning (omitting the salt)to the stuffing mix and slit the chicken breasts, breaded, and fried them 5 minutes a side.  I also used mozzerella cheese instead of swiss.  We are adding this to our list of favorite recipes!

I served this meal for my family and everyone agreed that it was delicious. I made some changes though. Real crab was $15.99 for 8oz..Considering I can get a crab leg dinner at Red Lobster for that price, I refused to pay that much for crab and substituted Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage instead. It was still very good. The white sauce was a little bland, I would add a little more salt to zest it up. Have fun cooking.

This was an okay recipe. It tasted good, but it didn't look too good. The sauce was very thick and rich. I'd suggest to use packaged artificial crab instead of the canned, it would taste much better.

This was FANTASTIC. I followed the recipe exactly aside from adding some Old Bay and skipping the Swiss Cheese. Served over brown rice, but think this would also be good over egg noodles or quinoa. My dad practically licked the plate. Will DEFINITELY be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing!

I took  into consideration some of the reviews and added white wine and thyme to the white sauce.  Sautéed shallots , mushrooms and red pepper with Old Bay spice then added the crab, fresh bread crumbs with a few drops of hot sauce.  I just made pockets in the chicken instead of flattening and rolling.  After baking for 30 minutes, added Parmesan cheese ( less rich but tasty) for the final 10 minutes.  This is a five star recipe worthy of a high end restaurant but can be made in stages so easy for a mid week meal.  Hubby loved it.

This was very good, nice and creamy. I added 1/4 c green onion, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp mustard powder to the crab mix, and used Old Bay in place of salt. The flavors weren't knockouts, but they were nowhere near bland like some reviewers have said. I enjoyed this dish and will definitely make it again.

This is a keeper! I did tweak it.  I sauteed lots of garlic and shallot, used bread crumbs and seasoned the white sauce and  chicken breasts with a garlic herb seasoning. I used Old Bay in the crab mixture.  When the Swiss cheese melts over the white sauce and oozes all over...Mmmm!  This is a very nice recipe.

Fairly easy to make and all the guests really loved it.  It tasted great as a leftover as well.  Will become one of my signature meals.

Followed the recipe as written - not good. It also did not cook in time, added 8 mins to oven time.

My children, husband, and I loved this recipe. We substituted the crab meat for imitation, used Italian blend shredded cheese, and chicken bullion cubes with water for the sauce. Substitution was solely because I used what I had on hand. Next time, I will use real crab meat. Imitation was still delicious! We had a ton of leftovers so this meal made for a couple nights lunch and dinner.

This is a much easier and just as tasty version. I made the white sauce as directed, added salt and pepper to it , then instead of rolling the chicken I cut them into portions, added salt, pepper,galic powder and a little thyme to the pieces on both sides. Put the mushrooms and I used green onions on top of the chicken and poured the sauce over top. Baked for 20-25 minutes,then  stirred in the crab, and put the cheese on top, and baked until cheese melted.  Much easier and even less calories without the  crackers. Served over rice.We all thought it was excellent. Next time I may even brown the chicken first to add some color.

The white sauce in this recipe is great!  I am going to use it as my new base sauce for gravies and such! This sauce is perfect because you can adjust the spices and try new flavors with it.  I added minced garlic, and various other spices. It is delicious with the crab-stuffed chicken, and I am excited to try it with several different dishes! Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was ok. I will definitely make it again with some of the following changes: fresh mushrooms, herbs that will make it memorable, and cheese inside and on top of the chicken (I’m a cheese lover). It is fast, easy, and fun to make! Thank you for the recipe Christy.

This is pretty good however, a little rich. I used real crab not the fake stuff cause its kinda rubbery. But overall, a good combination.

The sauce was way to think and even adding lots of herbs very bland. It was my mistake using too much flour I am sure. I think I will save my crab dishes and chicken dishes separate.

I did not care for this recipe. What a waste of money. The sauce was bland, and the combo of crab and chicken was not good. I will NEVER make this again.

We loved this!  I wanted fresh crab meat and found 2-3oz prepared crab cakes that worked perfectly!  Used Wondra instead of flour (never fails).  Rather than putting the crab mixture at one end of the pounded chicken breast, I spread it all over and then rolled.  Served with "Easy Mushroom Rice" also on this site.  Will make again.

I can only give this 4 stars because I used leftover mix from "Gary's Stuffed Mushrooms" (which were AWESOME and also has "Stuffing" in them, and actually MANY of the ingredients listed for the stuffing in this recipe) from this site for the stuffed part of the chicken. I pounded the chicken breasts flat and I used FRESH mushrooms (obviously), and did make the sauce from this recipe, and I MUST SAY, these were AWESOME and thank you for the idea.  I was looking for SOMEWAY to use the leftover "Stuffed Mushroom" mixture from the above mentioned recipe, so thank you for the IDEA even though I didn't follow the exact stuffing recipe, they were GREAT and very pretty :)  Thanks again.

This was pretty good.  I didn't tell my husband what the stuffing was until he finished eating.  His reaction was, "Crab?  Really?  I didn't taste any crab."  That was kinda discouraging.  We liked it, but would have liked a more crab taste.  I cut a slit in the chicken and stuffed it that way.  While baking much of the stuffing came out.  I might try this again, but I don't think it will make it into the regular rotation.

I always take a recipe as an outline/idea and tend to make it my own as I go along.  

This recipe is very easy to make and being from Maryland, I'm always looking for new ways to prepare crab.  

The only thing I really changed was, I used Old Bay in place of the salt, pepper and paprika.  Old Bay is always used around here, so it would seem like something was missing if I neglected that.

Five Stars! This is a perfect recipe if you want something that is a little different and special but not a huge effort in the kitchen.  My DH and DD both loved it.  I followed the recipe except for using Ritz crachers instead of saltines.  I thought the white sauce was a little bland so I seasoned it with a salt, pepper, & garlic powder.  Mine needed to cook for a few minutes longer than called for.  I will definitely make this for company sometime!

I made this for my mother(who is the hardest to please) and she loved it!  She thought that it was from a restaurant!  I did change the saltines to bread crumbs (gave it more flavor) and I topped it with montery jack cheese.  I will use the stuffing mixture for future recipes. Thanks!

I made this recipe according to the directions, and found that the taste of the fresh crabmeat overwhelmed the dish and resulted in an overall fishy taste.  Presentation was beautiful but taste may have been improved with the usage of a more light ingredient in the center like  immitation crab meat or shrimp.

This recipe is great and so fast and easy to make!  My 4 year old AND my 2 year old love it not to mention my husband who hates crab.  It has now become a tradition to make this at least every 2wks.  Some hints however to make the white sauce taste less bland is add some chicken broth base in along with the broth.  It works wonders!  I also made this in a different way as well just for a  change by using about 1 - 1 1/2 cups of broccoli in place of the crab and about 3/4 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms (portobello are great in this recipe too!)  The rest of the ingredients are the same.  I also like to top it off with mozzeralla or marble cheese and parmesan.  WONDERFUL!!!

This is what I was looking for.  I did change to canned crab and also omitted the mushrooms.  Will make again.

This recipe was a hit. My boyfriend said it was a 10! I made some minor changes such as using immitation crab meat and ritz crackers rather than the saltines. I served it with some wild rice and a nice green salad. The dish is rich so the wild rice and salad are a nice companion. EXCELLENT!

I added 2 cans of crab instead of just one. I also used 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of white wine.  It was a big hit.

The adults loved it.  The crab stuffing was a little too rich for the kids but they went crazy for the white sauce poured over rice.  It's a keeper.

This was a very good recipe. I received rave reviews for this recipe. I made a few modifications to the recipe. Instead of crushed crackers I used seasoned breadcrumbs. I used a combination of Swiss and feta cheese. It was excellent.

Pounding the chicken proved futile, even though they were large breasts.  There was no way I could have rolled them with the stuffing.  Next time I will definitely cut pockets instead.

Wonderful rich stuffing.  Easy to make but it takes a while.  I also tried substituting cooked italian sausage for the crab meat. Also very good!

This recipe was very very good. Such a wonderful mild flavor but VERY rich.  My 3 and 5 yr olds ate it up!  I used a bit more butter and chopped the mushrooms into smaller bits so that I could stuff more in each roll. Definitely a dinner for company.

I loved this dish and so did the family.  I substituted some of the ingredients though.  I used ritz crackers instead of the saltines, I used fresh crabmeat, and I used more butter when frying the onions, crabmeat ect.  It was really rich.  Again the recipe was great and I will be making this again.

Maybe I didn't do something right, but we didn't enjoy this at all. Although the white sauce was good! I may try it again and make a few alterations, it has potential.

MMMMM great tasting dish and a welcome change from the "just chicken".  My husband enjoyed the crab and mushroom taste -- I received a two thumbs up!
