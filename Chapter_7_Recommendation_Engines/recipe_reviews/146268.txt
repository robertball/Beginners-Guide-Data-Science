Fantastic!  I give out very few 5 star ratings, but this one deserves it.  I usually don't tinker with recipes the first time I make them, but the directions seemed rather redundant with too many separate steps.  So here's what I did: I marinated the shrimp for about two hours (it was the fully cooked, peeled, deveined, frozen kind that I thawed under cold water), sauteed the garlic and onion in a bit of oil, added the beans after a couple minutes, than added the shrimp when the beans started to be crisp-tender.  After about five minutes in the skillet, I transferred all to a bowl which I placed in the freezer to cool quickly.  At first bite, I thought it might be better warm, but I had forgotten the feta.  With the feta added, this was a wonderful cold salad!  The garlic was not overpowering and the rosemary was a really nice subtle flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent combination of ingredients. Like some others I saut√©ed the shrimp (I like to play with my food when cooking) and steamed the beans. I splashed in 3 or 4 tablespoons of stock after combining all of the ingredients. We were too impatient to wait for it to chill so had it warm. It was delicious and since there was a little leftover we'll get to try it the way it was meant to be eaten too. I can hardly wait to try it with beans fresh from the garden.

Loved it! I added thin sliced red onion and some large cherry tomatoes cut in half. Only used 2tblspns of evoo and the juice of a whole lime, salt and fresh cracked pepper and a garlic clove crushed for the dressing. I really liked the feta with the beans which I steamed. Very healthy and will make again! Thanks!

My boyfriend and I just made this dish last night.  It was great!  We decided to saute the green beans instead of boiling them because we like our veggies to have a crunch to them.  :) We also sauteed the shrimp instead of baking them.  Then we combined the cooked shrimp and green beans and sauteed them together for a few minutes.

I made this recently for lunch with a friend and we loved it served with a green salad and hummus with pita bread.

This was very good - make sure you don't forget the cheese.  I forgot to add the feta the first day so I thought it was missing salt.  Also, it tasted better the next day so it is a great dish to make ahead.

I've made this several times now and every time it is all eaten and people ask for the recipe.  Great--but don't over cook the beans.

Thanks for posting the recipe
Made the recipe the day before 
Flavor was great - eye appeal was terrible - onions looked stringy and green beans were covererd with white specks. Very unappealing. I would not serve this to guests but would adjust for appearances and cook again because the flavors were so good. I bought an herb and garlic Feta that was creamy - and had a very difficult time turning it crumbly.

This was refreshing and an instant hit. I cut some of the steps down. Didn't cool the shrimp. Tossed it with the beans and onions when they were done then cooled it all together. We added more feta then it required because feta is a family favorite. Follow the steps when cooking the shrimp and they will come out perfectly and aren't overlooked. This is great as a main dish or side. One of our new favorites.

this was absolutely amazing! didn't want to dirty all those pans so i cooked the onion first then added the shrimp mixture.. i used a combo of frozen green beans and fresh zucchini.. it was a birdseye steamers package so i microwaved them as directed and added that at the end.. didn't use all the garlic salt and pepper at the end bc it was already that tasty.. subbed bottled lemon juice and dried rosemary for the fresh.. about 3/4 tsp.. i also halved the oil.. i could have enjoyed this even without the feta (used plain) and still would have given it five stars.. ty so much for an awesome recipe

It may not be fair for me to rate this since I didn't follow the instructions exactly. As per other reviewers, I sauteed the shrimp and green beans separately, then sauteed them for several minutes together to combine the sauce. Broiling just seemed like it would dry up the marinade too much. It's pretty good but doesn't have a whole lot of flavor.
