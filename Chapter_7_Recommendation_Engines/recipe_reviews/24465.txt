This has to be the quickest and easiest recipe for a delicious crunchy cookie I've ever made--and I bake a lot of cookies.  Absolutely wonderful.  Reminds me of the Italian meringues, but with the added almonds they have more flavor and body.  I roughly ground the nuts instead of using sliced. I also added a splash of almond extract at the very end of beating. Very good.

I have to rate four stars due to the sugar factor. Wow they're extremely sweet! I made this as written the first time and then cut the sugar and added cornstarch the next time. Toasting the nuts added a lot of flavor. That made for a very good cookie. I baked mine the second time on a lower heat because the cookies were browning a bit too much in my oven. I also added some almond extract. You may like them that sweet, seems others do.

So light and delicate! What a winner. I'm making these for my cookie table. I'm getting married in August, and these are going to be a great addition.
