I think this was a good idea but there was too much chia seeds. I followed the instructions and the french toast mix had been absorbed by the chia seeds. Half of the bread slices didn't have enough batter to coat.

I liked the coconut. It added a nice flavor. If I were to adjust this recipe and make it again, I would suggest using almond milk, coconut milk, or soymilk. I would use half of a cup instead of a quarter cup. I would use 2-3 eggs or 2-4 egg whites, and maybe 3tbs of chia sprinkled on the toast sticks after they are in the pan.
