I like bitter chocolate a lot so I liked this, though my sister tried it and didn't. I found it a little too thick to use as a sauce but I ate it with some fruit. It makes a good truffle filling if you refridgerate it.

I'm a big fan of things that are on the bitter side - coffee and chocolate. This recipie was rather thick, and just a bit bitter - it tasted like cocoa powder. However, this is just what I love! I literally sat and ate the whole thing with a spoon, who needs ice cream? If you've ever had decadence (sp?) this is kind of what it's like. I loved it!

Awesome! It's not a thick drizzle but definitely love how it's not sweet! Made as written, make sure to stir often to make sure all the clumps stir out. I could eat this with a spoon... All by itself! For those of you who don't enjoy the bitterness of the cocoa you could add more sugar, or honey. But drizzled on something sweet it's the perfect garnish.

This was sort of clumpy and not sweet. Added a little more sugar and some milk - still not really what I was looking for.

When I started this recipe, I questioned the amount of sugar. After making it, the drizzle was not sweet at all and was too thick, nowhere like a drizzle should be. I had to add more sugar and more milk.
