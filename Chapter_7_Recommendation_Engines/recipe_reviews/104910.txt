Excellent!  I love the mix of spices.  I made two batches of these. One with regular paprika and added a little grated parmesan cheese (1/4 to 1/2 tsp - I really didn't measure). The other I used smoked paprika and added 1/8 tsp. of chili powder.  Both were fabulous! I partially microwaved the potatoes vs. boiling which is much easier and a lot faster.  I used Olive Oil Pam to make the seasoning stick. When I cut the potatoes into wedges I very lightly scored them. They came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, perfectly seasoned and great with a side of sour cream! Great recipe!

I used two large baking potatoes and doubled the amounts of spices. Instead of vegetable cooking spray, I used EVOO. I liked the idea of this recipe, I loved the spice mix but the cooking method just wasn't a win for me. I think next time, I'll just cut the potatoes into wedges, coat the wedges with oil and toss with the spices, then bake.

I was looking for a way to cook potatoes on the grill that did not involve a foil packet and this fit the bill.  My husband and I were pleased with this recipe and the mix of spices.  I did not boil to potatoes first and instead microwaved them (I wanted to keep the kitchen cool).  They turned out perfect.  We ate ours with ranch dressing.

I made a batch of these last night, and must admit that I doubled the amount of spices used.  I planned to use twice the number of potatoes, but decided instead to use the doubled mix on just the four.  I'm glad I did, as the flavor was just right!
I also mixed up some Buffalo Ranch salad dressing with some plain sour cream to make a tasty dip that went well with the spice of the potatoes.

I used unpeeled red potatoes cut into bite sized pieces. I omitted the cumin and added sage. Next time I will add just a bit of salt.

I was making this for 20 people, so I cooked them two ways to save time.  Sprayed cookie sheets with olive oil pam, added a single layer of potatoes and sprayed those with pam and sprinkled the seasonings on top. Baked in the oven at 400 for about an hour.  They were a little dry so I put them in a covered casserole dish with about a Tbsp of water and microwaved on high for 2 minutes. The water steamed the already cooked potatoes and made them moist.

The second way I cooked the potatoes was to just spray a casserole dish with olive oil pam, spray the potatoes [while on a cookie sheet] and season and add to the casserole dish. I cooked them in the microwave for about 20 minutes on high, stirring halfway through.  

Put the potatoes in a foil pan on the grill to keep hot while burgers were cooking.  Kids and adults loved them.

Excellent! Dump the spices into two TBSP of olive oil, toss the potato in it, tip the bowl to pour the excess oil onto the sheet, smear it around and drop the potatoes--abracadabra: oiled cookie sheet and potatoes ready to go! Mix the sour cream with Heinz 57 and crushed pineapple for a different dipping sauce.

I used a different method for cooking the potatoes... I peel, slice and lightly coat in EVOO then essentially cook in the microwave for 6 minutes, removing and shaking the loosely covered container the fries are in. Once done with the microwave, toss with seasonings and bake for about 30-45 minutes, once they get crispy. This way they are tender on the inside but crisp on the inside. You can also add some cornstarch to the mix (roughly 1 tablespoon) to ensure crispiness. I doubled the seasonings for roughly 8 really small potatoes. I used a hot chili powder instead of cayenne, celery seed instead of the celery salt and added a half teaspoon of salt. It could have used a wee bit more spice and salt, but it was mild enough for my toddler to enjoy too. We didn't serve it with sour cream... Ketchup and mayo is the way we flow. Served this as a side to "Bayou Samburgers" from AR.

I baked these instead of grilled them, so I put the potato wedges into a gallon bag, added 1 T oil and the seasonings.  When the potatoes were coated, I baked them on parchment paper for 30 minutes at 400.  My family loves these! We served them with yogurt instead of sour cream.

We thought these were very good. I nuked mine,[I don't think that matters]because of the heat. I used oil with the spices and brushed these on the wedges, in my grill pan. Will make again.

I used red potatoes, added a little salt and doubled the spices for 6 med red potatoes. I couldn't find my cayenne so I used chipotle and smoked paprika. I still sprinkled mine with more salt after they were cooked.

I liked the cooking method here as it ensured the wedges were beautifully crisp/chewy on the outside while the insides were very tender. I would probably add some salt other than just the celery salt to the seasoning blend next time and maybe finish them with a sprinkle of cheese as they come off the grill. The spice blend was nice enough but was missing something for me. The kids liked them though, and the (tastebud wimpy) hubs did too. I guess it's all a matter of personal taste. Thanks for the overall great recipe! Would definitely make these again.

Love potatoes done like this! Excellent flavor. For those who use a microwave, you really should try boiling instead - boiling removes a thin layer of starch on the outside of the potato, which promotes browning and crisping of the surface of the potato when grilling or roasting. You won't get this with a microwave!

I used 5 large red potatoes and 1 sweet potato instead of baking potatoes. Doubled the seasonings. Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

these were not good.  they were extremely dry and had no flavor.  sour cream or catchup didn't help.  if i were to try these again, i would probably coat them in butter or oil, spraying "pam" on them doesn't work at all.

I used french fry size potatoes and they came out great; tender inside and crunchy of the outside.  Even my husband, the french fry eater, liked them.  Will make again and again.

I Baked mine at 425 for 50-60 minutes. (no boiling) They turned out well being baked. It was a tad spicy for my taste but I used extra sour cream to cut the heat in my mouth. I am whimpy when it comes to heat though.

It was good, I had to make the seasoning 3 times because it wasn't enough.  Maybe also think of a better way to put the seasoning on the potatos.  Overall the taste/flavor was good.  They were also really good with the sour cream.

The potatoes were a bit of a disappointment. The spice blend was a perfect mixture  but not enough for 4 large potatoes. To save time you can microwave the potatoes until just about cooked. Then slice them into fries and grill them. My family did not care for these at all. I love the idea and liked something other than a baked potato on the grill.

This is a really good recipe.  I only added some Dry Grated Parmesan Cheese to the spice mix.  I don't know the exact amount as I just shook it in.  The one thing which didn't come out as planned was it was too salty, but that was my own fault.  I smothered the wedges into the spice mix, so it was covered w/ a layer.  This made the wedge way too salty.  You really do have to follow the instructions and just sprinkle the wedge - DON'T SMOTHER or you'll be drinking water for the next 24 hours!  I didn't grill the wedges, I baked them in the oven for 25 minutes @ 400F (after boiling them per the instructions).  Will definitely make again!

I used sweet potato wedges (nuked instead of boiled) & honey nustard sauce to dip in. Don't think I'll use sweet potatos again ..not sure this particular spice combo was suitable for them (Bobby Flay has a seasoned fry recipe that works great w/ sweet potatos) but I'll try it again using regular potatoes w/ ranch dip like LAFLRA.

These were pretty good.  I thought the prep process was pretty lengthy and the outcome was a bit spicy for my tastes.  Will make again and try some other spice combos.
