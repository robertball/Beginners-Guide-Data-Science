With a 1/4 cup of reduced fat mayonnaise and a touch dijon mustard, this makes a quick and tasty egg salad sandwich!

I've enjoyed this on buttered toast, in a sandwich, and also as a side with a salad. I much prefer it with regular bacon though - not quite as healthy, but much tastier, in my opinion. Thanks!

Yum! I will definately make this again. I served it in between toasted bread with a light layer of mayo and a leafy piece of romaine as a twist on the BLT. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I added Canola Mayo to this recipe and put it on a piece of whole grain toast and it was amazing.  Very simple and quick to make.

Well this Monday Morning Breakfast tastes delicious on a Saturday, too!  I made as directed and added it to whole grain wheat toast with a little Veganaise (Mayo substitute.  It was a delicious fulfilling meal and a healthy one, too!  I will definitely make this again.

What a great, simple idea!  I thought this would be very bland, but it wasn't; it didn't even need salt and pepper.  I made it just as written, although I doubled the turkey bacon.

I put this in a bowl and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa.  Mmmmm good!!!  Thanks for sharing it.  I'll make it again, maybe as a breakfast burrito.

Made this for hubby to take with him on the way to work.  Omitted the tomatoes because he doesn't like them and put them on toast, english muffin, and biscuits.  He thanked me and got a few requests from co-workers who saw him eating these.  Thanks for an easy breakfast.

Easy to put together. Nothing very special. I used real bacon instead.

added quite a bit of extra spices and more tomato.  Its more like a lunch entree than a breakfast in my opinion.  Overall okay though

Monday Morning Breakfast was very good as a Tuesday Afternoon Lunch.  I love eggs of any kind - and this made for something new for lunch.  Thanks Varucadarling for sharing your recipe.

Made this the other day and it was great. I didn't have any bacon so I chopped up some pre-sliced turkey instead. It still turned out great! My picky aunt even liked it. I will definitely make it again.

I made this exactly the way it was written and my husband and overnight guests loved it!  It's simple and light but very filling.  5 stars!

Loved the simplicity. Used real bacon and added a pinch of thyme. Made a sandwich with toasted ciabatta roll. Wonderful brunch!

Wonderful. I put the egg, tomato and bacon (pork) in a lettuce wrap. Very Good. Thank You
