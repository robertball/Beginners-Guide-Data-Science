10.13.16  Can’t tell you exactly what it is, but I thought the sauce was lacking something.  I did add more low-sodium soy sauce, but I’m thinking maybe more peanut butter as that flavor is totally missing.  Didn’t add the veggies on the skewers based on the side dishes I was serving with it, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  It was good, but I had high hopes for this, and was just a little bit of a let down.

I made this as written and it was okay, but I don't think I'd make it again.  It tasted a little flat, like something was missing for a pop of flavor.

I made this as an appetizer for Super Bowl and everyone raved about it!  I did swap out MCT Oil for the vegetable oil and I didn't use any of the veggies.  Cut chunks a little small, about 1" and cut about 10 min off the cook time.  They were so easy.  I will definitely make these again!

I didn't have the skewers, so instead i made it in a frying pan and served it over rice. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed it.

Goood starter recipe! I added 1tbl spoon gochujang, sesame oil and added more ginger and garlic. The hole thing marinated overnight and got grilled on the grill. I suggest taking the remainder marinade and add to meat after rotating it on the grill. Delicious!

I stuck to the recipe and it was okay. The meat was a little dry (despite not cooking the full 30 minutes) so I made another batch of marinade to use as a sauce. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce was okay but a bit bland, no zing factor. I think ginger & sesame oil would definitely help.

Tried this recipe for supper tonight.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I doubled the amount of peanut butter (Kirkland brand: only peanuts).  I also added a teaspoon of sesame oil.  Not a fan of zucchini, so used only red pepper, onion and mushrooms for veggies.  Hubby BBQ'd the kebabs.  We enjoyed them with a nice bottle of Niagara riesling gewurztraminer.  Will definitely make these again.

I used roasted peanut oil and doubled the peanut butter to up the peanut flavor factor as well as give the marinade more body.  We marinaded cubed chicken in this for 1 hour the first night and 8 hours the second and basted the kabobs while they were on the grill.  Nice balance of flavors, but not as bold as I would have prefered.

Great pork tenderloin!  Didn't have enough soy sauce so used 1/3 of Worcester sauce. It made it awesome!
