I really loved the flavors in the chile-ginger sauce...such a fresh and creative way to prepare chicken breast. The fresh vegetables on the top added a nice crunch too!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this dish!  It's so flavorful and delicious, it's been added to our go-to dinner list and we make it probably every month.  I don't think the recipe needs any changes, we always make it as written and it comes out amazing.  I highly recommend it!

Totally loved it! Picky teenagers loved it too. Imagine that! I omitted the tamarind paste because I don't really prefer that spice. And it came out fantastic without it. The rice was delicious and the cucumber matchsticks were delicious with it and very unique! It was SO flavorful. Absolutely a keeper.

Jackie, this is a FANTASTIC dish!  Loved everything about it so I don't even know where to begin. The rice is lovely...the flavor is subtle against your chicken and the sauce, but is definitely the base of the dish from which all the other flavors build. The chicken is marinated perfectly, and I love that you don't need to marinate it longer than this recipe takes to make up until you cook it. The cucumbers offer a great fresh addition to the dish, as does the cilantro. I am so impressed with the homemade sauce as well...it's AWESOME. Had a viewing party of the show and served both this dish and Troys, and had the guests choose which dish one, and yours was the overwhelming winner, just as the judges decided. NICE JOB, CooksInHeels, looking forward to more amazing and great things from you in the food industry!

We liked this! The flavors were nice and fresh and this had a great texture. When I went to get my cilantro from the fridge, it was bad, so I had to toss it and use dried :( I can't wait to try this again with the fresh, as I know it will be even better! Thanks for sharing. :)
