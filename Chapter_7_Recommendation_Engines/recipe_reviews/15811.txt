For a few basic staple ingredients, this was pretty darn good comfort food! Like most reviewers, I used two cans of condensed soup as well (celery & chicken). I spruced up the soup mixture by adding a generous amount of garlic/onion powders, an eyeballed amount of pepper and paprika, 1/2 c shredded cheddar cheese, 1/4 c shredded parmesan cheese and a 1/2 c french fried onions. Before I added the french fried onions, I spread a very thin layer of the soup mixture on the bottom of the baking dish before placing the chicken breasts over it. Finally, I covered with foil and baked 45 minutes (I used the thin-cut breasts). The last two minutes, I uncovered and topped with a few more french fried onions and broiled to get a nice crunchy top. Delish! Served with some frozen corn and garlic mashed potatoes. Husband already asked me to make this again, so it's a keeper for that reason alone. Endless possibilities on this recipe with cheeses, toppings, and veggies...love recipes like this! Thanks for the submission.--------UPDATE 1/14/12......made this again tonight, this time using 1 can cheddar cheese soup & 1 can cream of chicken. Even better!!!!!!

This was a great recipe!  I will make it again.  I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of Celery, and also used sliced Cheddar Cheese- worked great!  I would recommend loosely covering the dish so the croutons don't get too dry.  I used a garlic-cheese flavored crouton, and WOW, was it great.  We didn't have any leftovers.

This was simple and tasty.  I had all the ingredients so I threw it together.  You want to use two cans of cream of celery soup, a little more shredded cheddar with a little more croutons on top.  I didn't really measure; I just threw all the ingredients on top of the chicken and covered it with foil.  It came out pretty tender.

This was so quick and easy to make.. and delicious!  My roomates loved it.  I crushed the croutons and also covered the dish with foil while cooking which made the sauce creamy and delicious. The chicken was very moist!  ;)  I will make this again.

Very tasty. I used a family size can of cream of chicken soup because I wanted extra sauce. I served the chicken and the sauce over egg noodles. Yummy!

I love this recipe!!  I changed it a bit - used cream of mushroom soup, swiss cheese and stuffing mix rather than croutons and it was delicious.  My only warning is that if your kids are picky about the way food looks they won't like this because it honestly doesn't look very apppealing.

This is a very good recipe. I slightly seasoned the chicken with garlic and made it in the crock pot. I just threw all the ingredients in, and set it on high for 4 hours. I served the chicken over egg noodles.

This recipe is awesome. Moist chicken with a creamy cheesy sauce. Goes great with rice and whichever veggie you decide on the side. Super easy to throw together, not a lot of ingredients and super tasty..don't forget to spray yor baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Wouldn't change a thing.

My husband and 18 year old son loved this! I layered 10 chicken breasts (salt & peppered), 2 cans of cream of chicken soup,  8oz shredded Mozzarella and 8 oz. shredded cheddar, and topped with 1 pkg of Stove Top stuffing seasoned croutons.  Cook as instructed on recipe.

My husband loved this recipe. Could have used a bit more cheese.  I sprinkled poultry seasoning on it first, it didn't need it.  I substituted cream of chicken soup instead of celery.  Very easy to prepare!

It was excellent. With the help of others, I added some of their ideas and it tasted great.  However, I think I'm going to try a 8oz can of diced green chilli peppers.  I think it would add to the flavor nicely.  Thanx for the supper!!

Great easy recipe!! My husband loved it and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen. I used a can of Cream of Celery and a can of Cream of Chicken, I used a combination of mozzarella cheese and sharp cheese and instead of croutons, (because I was out) I used stuffing and it was delicious!

This or a variable of this is a family favorite in our home. In our version we place the chicken breast on the bottom of a baking dish, cover the chicken with Velveeta Cheese, cover the cheese with Prepared seasoned chicken stuffing, then cover the stuffing with cream of celery soup and crushed croutons.

This is very easy.  My husband loves it, (he thinks I cooked this all day).  I haven't tried covering the dish while cooking to prevent dryness, but I will try that today, I am making this for like the 50th time.

Great recipe, I like the fact that you most likely already have the ingredients in your kitchen. I did make a few changes. I used already seasoned Italian chicken breast, quickly browned them in EVOO, and then placed them in oven to finish. I used a mixture of Italian cheeses + a bit of sharp cheddar. I took the suggestions and added garlic  powder plus I added some roasted onion flakes. I served it with rice and a salad. My family loved it! I will make again for sure!

I'm giving this one 5 stars based on simplicity and taste.  I wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised--the hubby loved it.  Next time I think I will use two cans of cream of celery and a dd a few more croutons!

Very tasty, especially with how easy it was.  I will definitely use two cans of soup next time, though.  We like to have a little gravy to spoon on top of the meat and potatoes.  This didn't leave much for that!  Overall, EASY and YUMMY!

Very good, but I changed it slightly.  I browned my chicken in a bit of EVOO, seasoned with garlic & onion powder.  Followed recipe from there except instead of croutons, I sprinkled in about 2-3 Tblsp of Hormel Bacon bits.  Baked covered in foil for about 45 minutes & served over egg noodles.  Pickiest child on earth loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

We didn't care for this. The taste of the celery soup was very salty and strange, and we didn't care for the texture of the croutons.

Very good, simple supper. I added a can of cream of chicken as well, because I thought I needed it for the amount of chicken I was using, but it would have been fine without it. Also, I was out of croutons so I used stuffing mix. My hubby and three year old really enjoyed it. Will definetly make this again.

I loved this easy recipe.  I did however marinate my chicken in some italian dressing before hand.  I also used cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Quite good! I altered the recipe a bit, using Cream of Mushroom soup, increased the cheese and added some green chilis. It took the chicken about an hour to cook at such a low temperature that the cheese went from the gooey to cooked stage, which was a bit disappointing. Next time I think I will boil and shred the chicken and layer it with the croutons on the bottom so they get soft instead of browning. But it was a good flavor combo and very easy. Four stars!

Everyone enjoyed this.  My son gave it 5 stars but I baked his without the soup since he doesn't like cream sauces.

Loved it!  So simple.  The one can of celery wasn't enough so I also added a can of cream chicken.  Otherwise, just two extra cloves of garlic (but that's a personal preference on almost everything).  Great recipe as-is :)

My family loves this recipe. I am so glad because it's so simple. I use a bit more cheese and I used cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks for this recipes!

Definitely a keeper for an easy weekday dinner!  I pared the recipe down for two and because the fresh chicken breast was so big, added 15 minutes to get he cook time and covered with foil during that extra time.  I'll be adding seasonings in the future to suit our tastes and this recipe is a great base to start with.

This was a really good PANTRY DINNER....I sliced chicken breast in half...put garlic/herb on both sides...put a can of cream of chix on them...and covered with crushed potato chips and corn flakes--mixed with sharp cheddar cheese....so, yeah a little off the original..but, ..this is good...chicken really moist and a nice tasting gravy...good reviews from my family...

Great just like recipe is written. However, if you like extra cheese sauce, just add an extra can of cream of celery, chicken, or mushroom soup.

Very simple to make, I changed it a bit, by chopping up the chicken and making it more like a casserole.

I made some modifications to make this a bit more homemade. Instead of a can of soup I made a roux with 1/4c butter, 1/4c flour, 1c milk and 1c chicken broth. I poured that over the chicken, added the cheese and then made some homemade croutons with some leftover crossants that were going stale (cut and baked at 400 for 10 mins with olive oil and garlic powder). I added a little italian seasoning to the roux and salted the chix. It was very tasty like this but I think maybe some minced garlic and/or onion in the roux would make it even better. I love the creaminess of using a can of soup but I'm wary of the BPA in the liners of cans so I'm always trying to substitute. This worked well.

I don't often make casseroles and I wanted something easy.  I figured my kids would like it.  It was running and the croutons never softened.  I will not try this again.

I used 2 cans of soup and doubled the cheese, only because I like more sauce.  Excellent, easy and fast recipe.  You can play with the different soups to suit your taste...it's all yummy.  Thanks for sharing. =]

This was so easy to make. It didn't call for salt, so I didn't even season the chicken, but I found I really didn't need to. My 14 month daughter loved it so much she even licked her plate! I didn't have croutons, so I just crunched up some crackers on top. Very good!

Great recipe!!! I can't believe it tastes so good, however, I made it with Cream of Mushroom and I had the Cheddar and Mozzarella Cheese in it, as well as the stuffing that I used was the Turkey taste, and it just was sooooo good, my husband hates cream of mushroom and he just counld not stop complimenting this dish...thank you for this awesome recipe.

My mom used to make this for me when I was a kid - now I make this for my boys. We love this and it's very easy to make.   cover the food with foil while it's cooking - otherwise the bread crumbs tend to burn

This recipe was the easiest and most flavorful I have ever made. You would think since there are only 3 other ingredients it would be bland but nope!! The croutons set it off and the crispy cheese ontop made it incredible!! Everyone should try this!! This will stay in my reciepe box for a long time.

This was quick and easy and very good.  I added some fresh celery to it. Served it with noodles.  (and the microwaved leftovers are really good!)
