Great recipe, although the sauce is a little sweet.

Delicious!  I used a whole wheat sandwich roll for me and whole grain sandwich bread for the kids.  We all loved it!

The only change I made was small, I combined both the ham and turkey, otherwise I kept it the same, it was excellent.

I made this vegan by using vegan mayo & Daiya-brand provolone & Tofurkey-brand cheese & meat. The bread I used was La Brea “French dinner rolls” found in our grocery bakery. I set the sandwiches in a large cast iron skillet  heated to medium & placed a second (slightly smaller) cast iron skillet in top of them. They got 3 1/2 minutes each side. Even tho the tops of the rolls were round, this worked well & they were delicious.

This went over well with everyone.  I switched the bread to French Baguettes, delicious canvas for the mayo!  I added garlic salt and Cavenders no salt to the mayo mix, and combined with everything else it rocked.  I give it 4 stars because standing alone I don't think it would have been as good.

Loved this sandwich, quick and easy to make. I used whole grain ciabatta bread, Colby and Monterey Jack cheese, ham, turkey and spinach leaves. I didn't try the sun dried tomato mayonnaise but I will on my next shot. My eleven year old said this is a keeper and told me to save it to the favorites.
