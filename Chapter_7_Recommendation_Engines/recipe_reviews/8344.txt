I used a 9x13 pan, sliced the cake long ways. returned 1/2 slice to the pan. Placed the pudding mixture on the top added bananas little more mix on top of bananas. Replaced the next slice added more bananas spread the cool whip with chopped cherries, drained and squeezed pineapple and 1/2 the nuts together and spread on top. Sprinkle with rest of nuts I added a few 1/4 cherries on top. Leaving it in the pan made it easy to transfer.

made this for my daughters birthday. Everyone said too much cake. Mom and mother in law said they have this recipe and it calls for 1 jiffy yellow cake mix...which is much smaller. Will try that the next time as I agreed with all too much cake. Will use banana pudding instead as well and cut whipped topping in 1/2 since this seemed like overkill on the cake. Used the juice from the crushed pineapple to mix with pudding which helped with flavor and topped with sliced strawberries and drizzled with chocolate sundae syrup and chopped pecans. Still good flavor all in all...but how can you go wrong with bananas, pineapple, strawberries and whipped cream!?

I made this and served it on the 4th of July but it was MUCH better the next day, after my guests had all gone! So you might want to make this a day ahead. The first day it wasn't so sweet and the flavors had not mixed as well. I made mine with one vanilla pudding and one banana creme pudding. Used fat free whipped topping and also added chocolate shavings as an extra garnish. Looks great and tastes great!

This is fantastic! I followed everyone's advice and used a bigger pan (a must!). I had forgot to put the chocolate syrup and caramel syrup on until after I had put on the whipped topping, so I just drizzeled it on top of the whipped topping and it looked great! Everyone loved this!!! Will definately do again

This is the best! I have made this cake
many times over the years and still get
rave reviews.  I suggest baking the cake
in a larger pan.  Also, I add sliced
strawberries (fresh or frozen) and I
drizzle chocolate syrup over the
bananas.

Very good recipe. Some changes I made.. Made the cake batter in a 9x13 pan. After it cooled I took it out of the pan and sliced it horizontally. Put bottom piece back in the pan. Added ingredients plus I added thin sliced strawberries- put saran wrap over ingredients to push down, put second layer of cake on top. Than I topped it with whip cream made from fresh heavy cream (instead of cool whip.) I did not top it with nuts and cherries- I thought that would be way too much. I did save a piece of the inside of the cake that I crumbled up and scattered on top of the whip cream. My family loved it- adults and kids alike. I will definately make this again!

This is a really good recipe. I only added a couple/changed  things. I added Strawberry, Pineapple Ice Cream Topping over the Banana layer. I also added Cream Marshmellow in the jar, NOT the Kraft. This is over in the Ice Cream Topping section in the stores. It is made thinner than the other. I also froze my Banana Split Cake. It does not freeze solid and it is SOOO good this way. I received SO many compliments on this.

We loved the taste of this cake!  Delicious!  I would recommend using a smaller amount of cake batter than what is in a regular yellow cake mix though.  When I put all of the ingredients on top of the cooled cake, it was so high that it spilled over the cake pan making it hard to cover.  This cake also tates best when it has been refrigerated.

This was a great recipe.  If you use a 9 x 13, I suggest you substitute Jiffy yellow cake mix box to get a smaller amount or use a 10 x 15 inch pan.  I used a trifle bowl and it was awesome.  Made a great presentation.

First of all, let me tell you this is the very first review I have ever made...so this has to be the best!! Years ago an older employee would give us a cake similar for Christmas. It has been years since I have been without this cake. Not anymore!! This cake is to die for! The only difference is I LAYER the cake, the same way our old friend did. Two of everything. First the yellow cake, then the bananas and pineapples, then filling then the next yellow cake. Finally more of the filling all over the cake, and topped off with the cherries and walnuts. This is a must have at any party. I took this to a labor day celebration yesterday, and EVERYONE went back for seconds! This makes so much it will easily serve 20 people when it is layered. Thank you so much for sharing a fond memory of a friend from years back. This one has been added to my "The Best Of The Best File!"

If I were rating this on taste, it would be a five star recipe. However, there is one major flaw in the directions: this recipe doesn't say what size cake to bake anywhere in the directions. It simply says to bake according to package directions. (It mentions that the original recipe yields one 9x13 cake).  After reading others' reviews, I realized that even a 9x13 cake would not work, since the toppings would quickly tower over the baking dish. I baked the mix in a half-sheet pan for 25 minutes. After cooling, I cut it and put it into one 9x13 and one 8x8 pan (I had some cake left over). I followed the topping directions, but used one box of vanilla and one box of cheesecake pudding. I used pecans for the top of the cake and added shaved milk chocolate (candy bar). I did cut the cherries in half before adding them to the cake. I found that I needed to use four bananas instead of three, probably because I was making two cakes. Made this way, the cake had a good amount of topping on a good amount of cake, and I was still able to cover it for travel. If I had baked a 9x13 cake and put all that topping on just that cake, it would have been impossible to take it anywhere. My coworkers devoured this and were asking for the recipe.

Excellent!!

My changes - instead of 2 vanilla puddings, I used one chocolate (you have to add chocolate somewhere in this recipe!) and one cheesecake, which was scrumptious in itself!  Then, used strawberry cool whip for topping, followed by the nuts and strawberries, instead of cherries.  Tasted amazing, and held together so much better than I thought it would!  BIG hit with everyone at party!

I made this cake for a birthday, and it came out sooo good!  Light, cool, delicious, simple and fun to make, and very pretty!  I found a very similar recipe on the Kraft site, and I used a couple of their suggestions: I used the juice drained from the pineapple as part of the liquid in the cake mix, and I mashed an extra banana and added that to the mix, too.  I baked the cake in a greased 13"x9" pan at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used banana pudding mix instead of vanilla in the cream cheese layer.  I used a 20-ounce can of crushed pineapple on top of the sliced bananas.  I found that an 8-ounce container of whipped topping was adequate for covering the top of the cake; I think 16 ounces would be a bit much.  To decorate the top of the cake, I used a large 10-ounce jar of whole maraschino cherries (which I found for an inexpensive price at Walmart), and I used closer to 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.

Very tastey. BUT, people should note that you need to cream the cream cheese first than add the pudding mix & milk. I didn't do that and I ended up with cottage cheese looking pudding spread, lol. It was still yummy though.

This cake got more "I want the recipes" than anything else I have taken to work. The birthday girl was very pleased. The only thing I did different was drizzle some choc. syrup over the pinapple and put some sliced strawberries on top with the cherries.

I made this cake for my family reunion. It was a hit. I baked two layers in seperate 9 by 13 inch pans. Then I transferred it to a deep dish 9 by 13 inch lasagnaa pan. I seperated the toppigs between the 2 layers. However, I added strawberries to inner layer and chocolate syrup on top.

Very good! Made it for my wifes birthday and everyone liked it. I followed other people's directions and only used 3/4 of the batter. I used a box of cheesecake flavored pudding mix and a box of vanilla, great combo! I would recommend getting the cream cheese out at least an hour or so before so it isn't so cold and difficult to spread. I had to use extra milk because of this. Also one thing we all wished we had was some chocolate syrup to put on the top. 
More walnuts would have been good too.

I also used 3 ripe organic bananas which makes that much more flavorful. This would be a great cake for potlucks and BBQ's.

Good cake! Don't use all the cake mix if your using a 9x13 pan. Next time I'll probably only use 2/3 of the cake batter. My toppings were flowing over the pan! I added strawberries & omitted the nuts.

I just thought this was OK...the pudding/crm cheese mixture didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I used 1 box vanilla, 1 box banana puddings.  However, I took this to a Labor Day BBQ and it was completely gone, so I guess maybe my opinion was wrong!  I DID skip the maraschino cherries and topped it with sliced strawberries and nuts and a drizzle of Hershey's syrup.  Next time, I might try doctoring up the pudding layer, maybe that would help.

I have decided to use an organic yellow cake mix with less calories/fat, and baked the banana's into the cake mix. I creamed the lower fat cream cheese, and pudding mixes together, and topped it with the pineapple. I arranged the marshino cherries according to each serving. Very, very, tasty and moist!

This is so very good, I love this cake and it's easy to put together too. It's especially great during the summer months. I also drizzled with chocolate sundae sauce to really carry out the banana split flavor, everyone loved this.  I will make this again, Thanks!

YUMMY!! This is such a fabulous dessert! It was our 4th of July dessert and our guests ended up taking the recipe (and a plate full) home with them. I used 2/3 of the cake batter and one box of banana cream pudding and one box of vanilla w/ chocolate chips pudding in place of 2 vanilla's. I added slices of strawberries on top of the bananas. It was delicious the next day too, if not even better! Remember to refrigerate any leftovers!

Try using a cheese cake pan and a cake pan of same diameter. Use 1 and freeze one for future use. You must readjust the cream cheese mixture and pudding mix but not the milk. I also added a layer of strawberry slices. If you press down with a sheet of plastic wrap after you finish layering the cake it will absorb the favor and cut more easily.

This cake was wonderful! I used a chocolate chip cake the second time I made it, and that added the one thing I thought was missing the first time. Yum! I normally don't like cake icing, but have used this icing recipe on other cakes and it works great for all flavors of pudding

This was excellent!  I added a little extra milk to the cream cheese and pudding to make it a little smoother.  Once the cake was done a drizzled chocolate syrup and caramel syrup all over the top.  Everyone raved over it.  Delicious!!!!  Thank you for this keeper.

I made this for my daughter's birthday and it was a huge hit.  I'm not big on bananas, never have been, but I certainly ate my share.

This was a very good cake.  I would suggest using all vanilla pudding because the banana pudding gave it that artifical banana flavor.  I may leave out the cream cheese because when I mixed it with the pudding it gave it a gacky consistency which made it hard to spread.  I am not a big cherry fan, so I sliced fresh strawberries on the top to garnish and drizzled it with Hershey's chocolate syrup.

I used the cherries & my pineapple was in it's own juice. I think the pudding mixture was too thick. If I made this again I would add more milk to the pudding mixture & use strawberries instead of cherries.

This is the best cake I've made all Summer.  I divide the batter between 2-9 X 13 pans and use fat free cream cheese, fat free sugar free pudding and lite topping.  I place each portion on a dish and swirl chocolate syrup over the top and plate.  What a beautiful Sundae!!!

I took this to a housewarming party and it was a crowd pleaser. I did make some changes, for personal taste, suggested by other reviewers. I used one package of cheesecake instant pudding and one package of french vanilla instant pudding. I also used strawberries instead of cherries. I drizzled chocolate syrup on top right before serving. I will definately make this recipe again.

I took this wonderful cake to a Good Friday crawfish boil.  I made the following changes (thank you to all previous reviewers!)  I made six cupcakes to use some of the batter - and my 13 X 9 pan was still full (after all the layers)  I used one pckg of french vanilla and one cheesecake pudding instead of the two vanilla puddings.  On top of the cool whip layer I used sweet Louisiana strawberries instead of cherries.  On top of this I drizzled caramel topping and chocolate topping (the kind you put on ice cream). I made it the day before I served it. This cake was a huge hit at the party.  I highly recommend this cake!  (several people requested the recipe!)

My cousin made this as one of her desserts for Thanksgiving.  It was AWESOME!!  I will definitely make this.  I will probably use something else instead of cherries, only because I don't like cherries, however, this recipe is a KEEPER!!!

Best cake I've made in years!  I used French Vanilla and cheesecake flavors instant pudding, poured chocolate syrup over bananas and pineapple, topped with French Vanilla Cool Whip and quarted strawberries and mini-oreo cookies.  This is an A+ keeper :)

My 10 yr old asked for this as a birthday cake.  I baked the cake from scratch.  I used a mixer to beat the pudding layer and had to add a few extra Tbsp. of milk to make it really smooth.  Rather than decorate the whole cake w/cherries I put a few on each piece and drizzled w/chocolate and caramel sauces as I served.  Really popular with the children!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I'm not really a dessert person, but I loved it.  It's a perfect summer treat, but don't let the "summer treat" description prevent you from making this any time of the year.  Your guests will enjoy it not matter their sweetness preference.

After reading reviews I did the cake mix but put it in a sheet cake pan made two witch made a much thinner cake. with one cake I took a wooden handle end rounded part once the cake was done and cooled and punch hole's into the cake all and inch apart. then poured the pudding mix over the cake making sure to fill the hole's up sliced bananas, drained the crushed pineapple really good then added to top of bananas then topped with whip cream. chocolate syrup. cherries. sliced almonds and chocolate shavings it looked as though a bakery had made it and put it in the freezer. the other half of the cake in the other sheet I took wax paper and sprinkled powdered sugar on it turned the sheet cake out on to wax paper. then did the pudding mix on top and sliced banana and small chunks of pineapple 1/2c. Rolled the cake into a log  putting the seam on the bottom then topped with whip cream and chopped sliced almonds and chocolate shavings with chopped cherries and a few more chopped up chunks of pineapple and it was beautiful took them to the out door picnic party and no left overs everyone raved and love this thanks so much for sharing...

Thanks alot, now I'm in charge of bringing the cake every time the family gets together!  This cake is fabulous.  I did add some strawberries, and then I forgot the nuts.  Just about everyone said "You know what would go good on this?  Nuts!" so don't forget the walnuts.  Also, I drizzled Hershey's chocolate syrup, but I think I'll try that chocolate sauce that hardens on your ice cream the next time.

Everyone loves this cake.  I omit the cream cheese and make the pudding as directed.  I poke holes in the cake with the end of a wooden spoon so the pudding flows through the cake.  I also add strawberries over bananas and pineapple and drizzle chocolate sauce and or butterscotch topping on top cake!!!  YUMMY

I took other reviewers' advice and used a larger pan and added more milk to cream cheese/pudding mixture. I also added strawberries and drizzled chocolate syrup (over the bananas)and drizzled a little more chocolate over the whipped topping just before serving. Delicious and easy to make.

Had a different version of this recipe, but this one was easier to make and turned out better. Made it to sell at our local Fire Company's Bingo and was a big hit, it is something different.  I used a lasagna pan and only 3/4 of the cake batter and the pan was full to the top when completed.

I have this cake several times. I was given this recipe from my X sister in law. I lost it, and remembered to search for it on allrecipes.com. To my surprise I found it! I have made it a traditional cake in our family and friends. You can also add coconut on top, I usually make it half and half with coconut. Some people don't like coconut. Anyway this is an awesome cake and is always a hit at parties. Hope you enjoy as much as our family and friends do. Happy Labor Day Weekend!

we have made this recipe for many, many years.  we've always made it in a jellyroll pan also known as a cookie sheet with sides).  this makes a thinner cake and serves a lot more people.  we also only use 1 pkg. of pudding, not 2.

YUM!  This was awesome and my family loved it.  I dribbled chocolate sauce over the top and it made it so pretty too!

This was a BIG hit! Everyone that had some raved. I have already been asked to bring it at the next family gathering. Easy to make and no baking is a plus! Look forward to sharing it with others.
