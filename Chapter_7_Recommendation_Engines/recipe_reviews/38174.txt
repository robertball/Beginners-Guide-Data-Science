We loved them tonight.  Really added to a nice touch after grilling all day.  An added note of my own is that you want to make sure your grill isn't too hot, they're not steaks after all.  We ended up adding chocolate to add a little better taste.

My vote would have been a 4-star, but my husband didn't like it. So, three it is. Taste is good and interesting, and I like the hot + cold. I'll make again.

The idea behind it sounded great. But I think it would taste better with just slicing regular bananas over the ice cream and turning it into a sundae. I didn't care for the bbq banana taste but that was just me. Kids might enjoy this.

Try slicing the banana in half lengthwise then grill it flesh side down. Peel after, top on vanilla ice cream or vanilla frozen yogurt, drizzle with honey and sprinkle with granola. YUM!

I stumbled on this by boredom while grilling.  I prefer a greener banana when grilling and to cut off the ends before putting them on the grill. Afterwards I cut the peel and sprinkled with sugar and cinamon.

Use a super underripe banana or you run the risk of banana jelly when you are done.  These were ok....I prefer mine fried.
