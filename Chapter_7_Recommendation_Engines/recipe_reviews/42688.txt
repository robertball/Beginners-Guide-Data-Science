I started reading the reviews while beating the egg whites, and I nearly decided to throw the batter out.  Sure glad I didn't! I added a tablespoon of sugar to the white's and a dash of salt, and the whole family loved them! And they DID turn out nice and fluffy. Those whose didn't, must have been an operator error? Ain't always the recipe, sometimes it's the cook! Amen?

The best pancakes I have ever tasted.  Seriously.  I have eaten a lot of pancakes at home and at the best diners but never so light and delicious.  Plus you don't get the after-brunch-stomach-blues because they're not heavy at all.  I agree with other reviewers about adding a tablespoon of sugar, but with a sweet topping adding more is unecessary. About the "too much egg" issue,  I assume that some other reviewers didn't beat the egg whites enough. You will know when they are stiff enough when you can turn the bowl upside down and they don't fall down. One really needs an electric beater to make the egg whites stiff or else you'll lose your arm.  It is, of course, easy to remove one egg yolk if it floats your boat better.  They even taste good after a few hours, while most pancakes turn inedible.

I enjoyed making this recipe.  The pancakes were extremly fluffy and had great colour.  The only problem is that, using 3 egg yolks made the recipe quite "eggy."  I could taste the egg yolks in the pancakes.  I would suggest reducing the number of egg yolks to 1 or 2 and using 3 egg whites to maintain the fluffiness of the pancakes.

Although these are very light and fluffy, as other reviews have said, they are very, very eggy!!  If I were to re-name this, I would call it French Toast Pancakes, because that is exactly what it tastes like!!  I added 3 tspn. white sugar and 1 tspn. of vanilla.  I also added fresh blueberries to half the batter and no matter what, they still tastes too eggy--but I am sure my husband will eat them, he is like Mikey and will eat anything!!

I thought this recipe was delightful.  I made into more of a dessert than breakfast.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/8 cup sugar to the batter.  I also added 1/8 cup sugar to the egg whites while beating.  They really cooked up light and fluffy.  I then topped off the pancakes with blueberry syrup and RediWhip whipped cream.  Yummy!!!  Thanks very much for this recipe.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  It is true that the recipe does have a slightly 'eggy' taste, but it is very tasty.  The results are light and fluffy... and very yummy.  I tried saving some batter to use a little later, but the whites seperated.  I mixed it up again, but the pancakes were very thin, and not as tasty as the fresh batch.

This is a wonderful recipe!! I use it all of the time now! Very fluffy as long as you are careful to follow the directions, and fold the batter. I've often added chocolate chips or apple to the batter and it always turns out yummy!

I took the advice from the other reviewers and cut back to one egg yolk. I also decided to use my regular boxed all purpose mix. The pancakes came out very fluffy and the end result was yummy. Thanks!

The recipes is superb as is if you are using a sweet topping, but if not, follow what other reviewers have said and add the bit of sugar and pinch of salt. These are the lightest, fluffiest pancakes EVER!I make these pancakes ALL the time. They've  actually become a signature menu item of mine. The key is in sufficiently whipping the whites to a meringue...no meringue, no fluffy! Oh, and BTW, I don't use an electric mixer. It's great exercise for the forearm! :-)

These were ok for me.  My favorite still is the Fluffy Pancake recipe on here.  My mom makes a pancake similar to this one and I love them when she makes them but I just don't make them the same way.  Could just be because I love my mom's and so my own making of this type will not compare!  All said, this is a good recipe so do give it a try!

I hate pancakes.  Despise them.  Yuck.  I only make them for my family.  The first time I made these I did what I always do -- take one forkful and then I've at least "tried" them.  OH MY GOODNESS! I could eat these all day long.  As well, they KEEP!  Even eating them hours later,  when the older ones crawl out of bed, they are STILL DELICIOUS!  (once I made so many we had some leftover the next morning and they were awesome!)  THIS IS THE RECIPE TO MAKE!  Thank you for posting this.  :)

We have these pancakes regularly in our household, it is the best pancake recipe I have used.  I love that it is so basic and easy and yet they turn out great every time - I think that beating the egg whites makes all the difference.  Unlike the other reviews, we have never found them to be too eggy (and I do use 3 eggs).

This is the best pancake recipe I have found.  My husband is very picky about his pancakes and every time I've tried to use a recipe it doesn't turn out the way he likes it.  Until now.  I'm not sure what every one else is talking about but these pancakes are fluffy and delicious.  The only change I made was adding 1/3 cup of sugar with the flour.  PERFECT!

The texture in these was very good, but I found there to be a noticeable baking powder flavor.  I will cut back on this next time.  I also found the addition of a little sugar and salt to be a great benefit to the flavor of the dish.

I found these pancakes rather ordinary.  I wouldn't classify them as "fluffy", probably because my family is use to fluffy so I expected more since they were actually called "fluffy".  They tasted okay but not anything I would be over the moon for.

Added a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract while whipping the egg whites, but otherwise a great recipe! Mine were extremely fluffy. Be sure not to miss the step of folding in the egg whites, as this is more gentle on the mixture than stirring and will keep it from going flat.

This is the best pancake recipe I've ever found!  Since I like my pancakes sweet I added: 2 tbl sugar, and 2 tsp. vanilla.  I haven't tried them without the added ingredients.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe! Blessed be!

These egg-focused pancakes seem like almost a fusion of crepe and pancake recipe. Being from Louisiana, I couldn't resist adding some extras. I used a TBSP sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1TBSP melted butter, and a bit of homemade vanilla extract. The batter came out a bit thin probably because of the butter, but it made for yummy, light, thin little flapjacks. I love the separated, whipped egg technique and will definitely use it again.

These are great! I did not find them to be eggy. I did make sure to get the whites nice and stiff ("Aha! So THAT'S what stiff egg whites really look like") For electric stoves I would recommend not cooking at medium high, more like just below medium. I added a bit of salt and a bit of sugar and served with farm butter, which was just right for us. Thanks for the recipe!

These came out very light and fluffy. I've been searching every where for the perfect pancake recipe. Although this isn't the most perfect I would definitely make these anytime for anyone. My 1 year old loved them as well. I tweaked the recipe a little by following another user and added 1/8 c. Of sugar to the batter and egg whites. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg whites with a dash of salt. They came out delicious. Would definitely recommend these to everyone.

On the downside they were a little eggy. Instead of 3 egg yolks I will probably use 1 or 2 next time but I wouldn't change the egg whites because they give them they're fluffy consistency.  But all in all this is a terrific recipe thanks for sharing.

These pancakes turned out extremely light and fluffy, but they had a baking powder after taste, that I didn't really care for. If I were to make them again, I would definitely add less baking powder.

Best pancake that I have ever had! Why go out when it's so easy to make these at home! It does make a lot of batter, more than 2 people could eat and the batter does not sit well in the fridge.

They turned out great!
I only had two eggs, but it was not a problem at all. I could still taste the egg a bit and I can see how three might be too eggy for some people, but I hand-beat mine so I'm actually kind of glad I could taste the extra work I put into it.
It's also nice that the batter went very far. I didn't exactly need it this time but I'm used to other recipes under-yielding (which is probably entirely due to my skill level and not the actual recipe).

I really loved this recipe because it doesnt taste like cotton in my mouth! This is a great basic recipe that can handle alterations well :)
Today I added cinnamon and vanilla then threw the batter in my waffle iron. My 18 month old ate 2 whole belgian waffles to himself!
The only alteration I made to the recipe was from other reviewers comments. I added a bit of sugar to the egg whites to help fluffen them.
Wonderfull recipes! :D

These pancakes were easy to make and came out looking really nice but had no taste.  I was disappointed as I really wanted to like them but they were the most tasteless pancakes I have ever made.

I used Whole Wheat flour and did not separate the eggs, just mixed it all up.  Loved it! The best and easiest pancakes I've ever had. Thanks.

Wonderful fluffy pancakes!  They need a bit of sugar in the batter because they are not sweet at all...but overall a GREAT breakfast for my six kiddos!

Great! Nice easy recipe using simple ingredients. And they are fluffy, just as my boyfriend requested!

Next time I will add a little bit of vanilla to give them a little extra flavour.

Thanks!

These Pancakes were fluffy, but rather tasteless. They were very easy and actually pretty fun to make. They cooked to a perfect golden brown too. I added  only 1 egg yolk, like some other reviewers suggested. I could just get a tiny hint of the egg so I think 1 yolk is about right. I might try this recipe again but with butter milk instead of the whole milk I used. Instead of 4 large pancakes I made about 15 "dollar" sized ones about 2-3 inches across. Thanks for sharing.

A great recipe if you love nice fluffy pancakes.  The next time I make them though, I am going to add a couple of tablespoons of sugar.  I found no sugar made them kind of bland.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

These pancakes were great! They seemed to melt in your mouth.  They were quite simple to make too.  The only problem I had with them was that they're not very sweet, though with some sort of topping (like maple syrup) that problem was easily solved!! They were by far the best pancakes I have ever tasted!!

I was a little hesitant at first to make these because there were no reviews (yet).  I was also a little wary of using 3 eggs and just 1 cup of flour.  I thought they might taste too "eggy". However, I decided to try them and I must say they're terrific!  A little "eggy" but in a good way.  Granted, there's a little "extra" work in beating the egg whites but it's worth it.  If I have a little time to cook, this will be the pancake recipe I will use - it's worth having to use the extra bowl and digging out the mixer.  :-)  If I'm really really pressed for time, I'll use my regular 'one bowl' recipe.

The texture of this pancake was amazing. It was super fluffy, but it was lacking in flavor. I will try a little salt, vanilla, cinnamon and perhaps some fruit next time.

I agree with others it would've been too eggy adding 3 yolks, I added one and the three whites, still found it a little "eggy". I added blueberries to mine, they were all right but they were fluffy!

This recipe is very special to me because I'm an egg lover. The pancakes do have the faint taste of eggs, following a fluffy interior and a crunch on the exterior. I whipped the whites and added them last, folding them for 1-2 minutes (slowly). Butter was my choice of fat, which makes them very rich and inevitably optional to add butter afterwards. In the dry ingredients, I did add a Tablespoon of sugar and used nonbleached bread flour. They were absolutely deish!!

I added 1 tbsp sugar to egg whites, whipped to peaks, added about 1 tsp vanilla to pancake mix. Asked family to tell truth in comparison to my regular bisquick pancakes. Hubby said it was missing something, maybe some nutmeg or cinnamon, otherwise pretty tasteless (he ate two pancakes and was done). 8yr old son said they were really good and ate 5 pancakes. I didn't think they were bad, but overall, didn't beat Bisquick. Still worth a try though.

These were fluffy, but definitely needed some flavor. Additionally, the fluffiness came off as almost spongey. Still, a decent pancake recipe.

These were beautiful and fluffy.  However, they did taste a little too much like egg for my preferences.  I used 2 egg yolks, like recommended, but probably should have only used one.

These pancakes were delicious.  I added vanilla and sugar because I like the taste.  These were very simple to make and my family loved them.  Thanks for sharing.  Don't do egg whites without a beater.....that would be to much work.

After seeing many mixed reviews on this recipe, I decided to go ahead with the original recipe to give it a chance and then add other things if it didn't work out.  Well.....it didn't work out.  As many others said, it was WAY to eggy.  I did whip the egg whites to a stiff peak, and regardless it was eggy.  I added another (approx) 3/4C flour, 1/2t B. Powder, a couple pinches of salt, as well as sugar & 3/4C milk.  With these alterations they were beautiful pancakes!!!  But unfortunately I cannot give this a good review based on the original recipe.

they were light and fluffy but were quite bland. i even added sugar and a little vanilla...it was still missing something. ( I always top my pancakes with butter and syrup) this was ok.

My husband is the one who found this recipe. He has been trying to cut back on sugar in his diet and this recipe didn't have any in it, so he tried it out, with great results. The whole family loved these pan cakes. They were light and fluffy with no baking powder bitterness. He did add a little vanilla to the mix. We have also tried them with rice milk instead of the milk as a non-dairy alternative. We have yet to be disappointed.  After you pour the batter into the pan add some berries, or apple or banana slices before you flip them. Yummy. Of course, the kids also eat them plain, topped with maple or fruit syrup, peanut butter, or Nutella.  I haven't tried this yet, but because they have no sugar you can also top them with savory foods. No we're getting creative!

GREAT recipe!  Fluffy, easy and wonderful tasting!  I added 1/8 cup of sugar to the flour mixture along with butter extract and vanilla as the other reviewer suggested.  I also added 1/8 cup of sugar to the beaten egg whites.  Im a Southerner and can't imagine pancakes that aren't a little sweet.

I added 2 tbsps of splenda, one of vanilla, and sliced a very ripe banana and folded it in and these pancakes were amazing.  They didn't look great- I gotta tweak that a bit but wow, easily the best and easiest pancakes ever.  Thanks so much!

I finished making these pancakes two minutes ago and I just had to write this review right now.  They are great!  I was never able to make truely "fluffy" pancakes until I came across this recipe.  I had tried another pancake recipe on this site (the one with the most rav reviews) but they turned out doughy & very rubbery.  However, I did add some sugar to the batter & used only one egg yolk & two egg white.  I might consider adding some melted butter next time too.  But overall, the best pancake recipe I have ever tried!

Straightforward recipe, but you may have to add more milk to get the right consistency. Also remember to sift the flower. Other than that, once cooked you just pile them up and pour the maple syrup and enjoy.

Thius was the best pancake recipe I have found on the net. My partner and I will no longer look for or try another recipe. The quantity of eggs give them a nice taste. The recipe can easily be doubled. They stay nice when you keep them warm in the oven while waiting for everyone to get home.

These were very good and fluffy...my boyfriend must. Have told me a bazillion times how good the cakes were while we were eating.  I did add a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of salt to the egg whites...but that is the only changes i made to the recipe.

I am usually very positive about recipies from this site; however, I did not care for these pancakes.  They were fluffy, but I felt, tasteless.  I believe salt would help.  Sorry but these are not a keeper for me.

As everyone stated on their review, it did come out very fluffy. However, I tasted something very bitter in the after taste. I put in a tablespoon of baking powder. Was it meant to be a teaspoon?

Very very good. Light, and fairly fluffy. I did find it missed a little something in flavor, but I am not sure what. I do not even mind the slight egg taste. Maybe next time I will try to add a tiny bit of cinnamon or sugar. But I will definitely use this again.

Exceptional pancakes! I was looking for a recipe with more eggs per cup of flour- as my kids won't eat eggs directly and I have to make indirect efforts :) Beating the egg whites separately made all the difference I think , the result was a fluffy pancake with beautiful glazed sides! Also for the first time ever my pancakes had little bubbles on the top while cooking! Great recipe- Thanks ! ps. I did add some vanilla and salt and topped with chocolate.

Yummers! These were great, they do have a bit of a French Toast taste but I think they are even better than French Toast. For newbie cooks, make sure your griddle isn't too hot or you'll cook the outsides before you cook the insides - requiring a 20 second spin in the microwave. Not that I'd know anything about that...

Based on others suggestions, used 3 egg whites & only 1 yolk. Not alot of flavor.  I suggest using Fluffy Pancakes by kris from this website.

I was thrilled with how fluffy these were!  I made them as written, but will add a Tbsp. sugar and a little vanilla next time, as some suggested, for a little more flavor.  This is my new pancake recipe!

Definitely to eggy.  Nice and fluffy. I haven't tried this yet, but a recipe that I have for waffles separate the 3 eggs also.  Maybe adding 2 tbls sugar and 1 tbls of grated lemon rind would help.

I was planning on adding egg whites to my pancakes and found this recipe - a perfect base recipe!! I used buttermilk instead of milk, only 2 yolks and 3 whites, and added 1 tsp sugar and vanilla. I folded in a few fresh blueberries from our farmer's market, then served it with store bought syrup doctored up with vanilla and butter then heated. Decadent and delicious! Stir the least bit you can to keep  the air pockets!!

Loved these!  I'd forgotten about this technique (which I'd learned from a Canadian friend over 30 years ago).  Added blueberries.  It was a wonderful 'breakfast for dinner' meal.

These were incredible! I was lucky when
I made these because it was cool and 
moist outside when I whipped the whites.
The only thing I changed was add 1/4
tsp. of salt and a tsp. of vanilla. They were really light and fluffy. Really good. My family inhaled them and asked for seconds.

If you don't like an eggy pancake, don't
make these.

I paired them with the Heart Attack
Eggs from this site. We had a GOOD
breakfast.

Very fluffy! Perhaps a bit of vanilla/sugar for a sweeter taste, but we loved these and will use the recipe, amended, as 'ours'!

I was excited to try this recipe because of the majority of good reviews but was sadly disappointed. We followed the recipe exactly other than adding 1 TB of sugar as advised by one reviewer. The pancakes were bland and more on the flat side. They were not fluffy. Thanks for the recipe anyhow.

Excellent and simple recipe.  The pancakes turn out nice and fluffy.  I have made this several times and have not been dissppointed.  I have also tried adding grated apple, cinnamon and sugar....so delicious!

These were not good.  I took other people's suggestions and cut the egg to 1 yolk, added sugar and vanilla and salt.  They still tasted like eggy french toast.  I like french toast, but not when I want pancakes.

These pancakes were really fluffy and delicious.  I did add some vanilla and sugar like the other reviews suggested.  I made them for my fiance and myself because we had a snow day and had no pancake mix.  I will never use bisquick again.  They were really easy to make and we ate all of them.  They go best with REAL maple syrup

This is a great basic recipe! My kids ate them up. They were light , fluffy & just sweet enough. I did follow the suggestions of the other reviews. I added 1 TLBS sugar & vanilla ,1 tsp salt and used only 2 egg yokes. It seemed that they took just a minute longer to cook than a regular pancake recipe. Give them a try!

Great pancake recipe! So easy, the whipping of the whites takes about 3 minutes, but is worth it! I added extra flavor by putting sliced bananas & peanut butter chips! YUMMY

I simply LOVED this recipe! I've tried others but this one really makes deliciously delicious pancakes. I tried scattering a lot of sugar and pounded groundnuts (roasted) on top of the pancake, let it brown at the bottom on a low flame and fold it once. They really make great snacks. My neighbours loved them and their children can't get enuf !!!

Way, way too eggy in flavour. I am sensitive to egg taste, so I couldn't eat any - my boyfriend choked a few down, though. If you don't like eggy things, do not eat these pancakes.

These were a bit of work, but everyone was pleased with the texture and with maple, or honey and cinnamon, they were quite tasty.  I think next time I might add some cinnamon and spices to the pancakes themselves, though, because as others have noted, they are quite plain.

These are super fluffy pancakes! I followed the recipe exactly except I added a few blueberries to the pancakes right before flipping. I did not add them to the batter because I did not want to deflate the fluffiness! My griddle fits 8 medium pancakes (each pancake is a 1/4 cup of batter) and I got exactly 18 fluffy gems of goodness. If you have a small pan and can't do large batches at once your batter will probably start deflating after it sits awhile, so the fluffiness is determined by how long your batter sits for! I didn't find them eggy at all, if you want them a little sweeter you could add a little sugar to the egg whites and some vanilla to the yolk/milk mixture (as I did) If you love fluffy pancakes, you'll really love these!

Somehow in 14 years of being together, I had never made pancakes for my husband. So on a Sunday night, we decided to have the best comfort food - pancakes & bacon. I chose this recipe because it is similar to one I used to make for my kids. The added whipped egg whites give the batter a nice light texture. The only changes I made: use 2 eggs instead of 3 (based on other reviews) and I added 1 tbsp. of sugar and 1 tsp. of salt. One thing to pay attention to...be sure to chill the glass bowl and the beaters for at least 20 minutes. The egg whites won't fluff up if it's in a plastic bowl, or if the bowl is warm. Great recipe!

I tried this recipe.  There must be a misprint.  One Tablespoon of baking powder?  I did not get the eggy taste, with two egg yolks, I was overwhelmed with the baking powder taste.  My pancakes were so tall, I had trouble cooking them until they were not runny in the middle.  Still searching for that light and tasty recipe.

Very fluffy!  But the 3 eggs / beating the whites  makes it very "eggy" tasting.  It was like eating scrambbled egggs - pancakes.  I think I'll add sugar next time.

Finally! The answer to the fluffiness and lightest homemade pancakes EVER made! i had tried another recipe for Fluffy Pancakes which was rated 5stars found in this website, I thought that was good but this one is Even better. The whisking of the egg whites was all worth it.I took out my electric mixer instead. I substituted the flour using half cup whole wheat n half cup all purpose floor n added baking powder. I also used buttermilk instead of milk. No eggy taste. My pancakes came out so fluffy and melt in the mouth!! Really! and its lower calories! Next time, I will add some sugar though. Or maybe  some fruits to make it even healthier. Rating this a 5 stars cos even though I made this with whole wheat, they are still fluffy and light! Thank you for sharing :D

great-similar to Kaiserschmaren (sp) I grew up with, where you add raisins and tear up the pancakes in the pan and serve with powdered sugar

I've been on this site a while and no matter how good the recipe was, I wouldn't review it. But I just had to speak up about this one. The only way these pancakes are any good is with some butter and syrup, otherwise they are laughably tasteless. Granted, I don't eat pancakes without butter and syrup and don't expect anyone else to, but good pancakes should at least have a taste by themselves and not solely rely on what you put on them. In short, they're terrible and I'll be looking for a better recipe.

These were very good.  4 stars because I altered it some.  I used 2 eggs rather than 3.  I used 2 tbs of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  They were not as fluffy as i expected but I will make this again.

I followed everything exactly, and while the batter certainly was fluffy, it took forever for the middle of the pancakes to cook. I'm sure it must have been an error on my part, since no one else seems to have made this mistake, over beat the eggs? I tried different heat levels once I saw what was happening... I don't know, but they definitely did not turn out.

Pretty Good, just different from what I expected. I would recommend adding 1-2 tbsp sugar in the batter, gives a better flavor, and topping the pancakes with fruit and syrup after wards.

I think these are the best pancakes I have ever made! I love the eggy flavor, and the fluffiness is overwhelmingly nostalgic for me of diners back home. I have never understood how pancakes are made fluffy, until now. The beaten egg whites really do the trick, and add great flavor! I always add blueberries to the pancakes while they are cooking in the pan, as per Alton Brown. yum ^_^

This was a light, fluffy pancake, but I thought it lacked something. Salt? Sugar? It needed a little something, but overall was pretty good.

Very easy. Foolproof & delicious. Kids loved it...especially with mini chocolate chips. I did not add sugar as I was sure syrup would provide enough sweetness. It did!

I tried the Fluffy Canadian Pancakes with only two egg yolks and an added tablespoon of sugar. Very fluffy - probably the fluffiest I've ever made, but not very flavorful at all. My husband actually used the term "cardboard." Keeping that extra yolk might help, but...  I'm just going to go back to using the "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe (the one by Eugene Presley, there's two), modified to beat the egg white for the only egg in the recipe. It's similar to this one, but it has 1/4 c shortening (I use unsalted butter) and I think that makes a lot of difference.   Just remember you can beat the egg whites separately in any pancake recipe. You don't have to sacrifice flavor like this recipe seems to do.

I enjoyed these. They were very fluffy, although like many reviewers said before me, they are a bit eggy. I doubled the recipe but kept it at 3 eggs, and while they were not completely eggy, I could taste the egg more so than the pancake. Still very delightful, next time if I decide to make these, I'll add cinnamon and vanilla so it would be more like french toast.

These were great! My kids loved them! I did taste the "egginess" but that was only towards the last pancake. So I could either omit 1 yolk or try blending better. I will try the latter as I want my kids to have the benefit of the protein from yolk.

A fantastic base recipe to make your own creations. I halved the recipe and use one egg and add about 1/2 tsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to the egg when I hand whisked it. I also add 1/4-1/3 cup oats to the mixture and sometimes add fruit to it for some more oomph....

I left out two of the egg yolks, but it still tasted like eggs.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it was just different than what I expected.  Also, I think I beat the egg whites a little too long because I had a hard time incorporating them into the batter.  It was a little lumpy.  But over all, not bad but I'm not sure I'll try them again.

Fantabulous pancakes - omitted 2 eggs and only used one , added 3 tbs of sugar just because i like my pancakes sweet and added 1 tbs of sugar to the egg whites . I would suggest some vanilla or cinnamon whatever works for you . The key is to beat the whites till they are stiff with an electric mixer adding sugar in gradually then fold it into the batter . These are so fluffy and tasty definite keeper !

These were pretty good. If I am making pancakes, I prefer to use a more traditional pancake recipe. The stiff egg whites give the airy batter (the same technique used to make crispy on the outside, soft on the inside waffles).

These weren't the greatest. Too much milk or too little flour, the batter was very thin, even with the thick whites. Kids thought it was cook how they puffed up so much while cooking, but were disappointed with how much they fill after cooling just a bit. Hubby thinks they'd be better deep-fat-fried - like a doughnut or funnel cake. I just wasn't thrilled. Will try them again, but will change up the recipe & how we cook them a bit.

I really, I mean really liked this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and was using XL eggs, so I did use one less.  I had no problem with an eggy flavour.  However I did add a bit of sugar, vanilla, and nutmeg per the other reviews.  But the consistency was wonderful and they cook up great.  You seem to have more wiggle room with the cooking time.  I made quite a few and some I cooked quickly and were still done, others sat in the skillet a bit longer and none of them burned.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Love this! At first I mess up and confuse baking powder with soda. Once I got that figure out, everything was great! I use two eggs as everyone suggested. I also add in vanilla. I eat two of them at once, and freeze the rest for later. They are still good the next day! So far I have tried it with adding in chocolate, mixed with with a banana, and switched 3/4 flour with wheat flour. All of them have come out delicious - soft and tasteful. It doesn't fluff up as much if I use wheat though, and adding in banana means I have to cook longer and lower the heat a bit. Other wise, terrific!

This has become my go-to pancake recipe!  Somehow fluffy and delicate at the same time, easy to prepare, and always impresses breakfast guests! I add a little vanilla and a little sugar also.   Make sure you really beat the eggwhites to stiff peaks before incorporating the flour.

These are AWESOME! I was looking for a fluffy recipe for pancakes as my 2 year old loves them. These were delicious!  I did add some vanilla and sugar to the egg white mix like others suggested. My family ate them all! Thanks!!!!

New family favorite!  I use this word sparingly, but these were the "best" pancakes I have ever had! I knew from the batter that they were going to have great consistency. With this recipe there is no need to put the batter in the fridge before using it. I used two jumbo eggs instead of three eggs. I sprinkled brown sugar over the top of the first side for added flavor. There were just enough, that we didn't have leftovers and everyone was full. This recipe is "print worthy".

Delicious! I've made this recipe several times and my family loves it. We've topped with blueberries, sliced bananas and pecans - lovely! My only complaint is that the batter loses its airiness if it sits for a while, which makes for less fluffy pancakes at the end of the batter. That said, I do double the recipe so that's probably why. Thanks for the recipe!

for the first time in my life...i made fluffy pancakes!  my arm hurt from whipping the egg whites to a point where i got peaks...but the end result was fluffy pancakes.  the only thing is that the pancakes tasted more egg-y than i was expecting...but overall a great recipe!

I followed the directions exactly except that I used finely ground whole wheat flour.  I beat the egg whites until they resembled meringue - whoever gave that tip THANKS!  These were AWESOME!

Never again will I use pancake mix! These pancakes were better than any box mix you'll ever find. Definitely not "eggy" and very fluffy indeed. Not difficult to prepare either. You Canadians are doing something great with your pancakes!

quite yummy pancakes, I added one packet of vanilla sugar to the pancakes and they were quite scrumptious! 
I did think however, they had a bit of a dough like aftertaste, however this may have been caused by the way i cooked them.

I'll give these two stars because they are light and fluffy as described, but they are also tasteless and really "eggy" as others have mentioned.  I added just a bit of vanilla and sugar, which were no help at all in overcoming the overwhemling tase of egg.

One of the reviews had additions for vanilla and sugar, so I used that and they turned out great!  You have to be fast with your pancake cooking, though.  By the time I got to the last few they weren't so fluffy.

I guess I just prefer have some substance to my pancakes - they reminded me of eating angel cake. I omitted one egg yolk based on other's reviews and added sugar and vanilla. Still not a crowd pleaser though...

They were nice and fluffy.  I added cinnamon and a dash of fresh nutmeg.  Didn't find them too eggy.  This is a nice recipe for when you have time to beat the egg white.  Only thing was that the finished pancakes went a bit flat after cooking, but this didn't affect the taste.

This was a great recipe.  I did double it and after I tasted one cooked, I added about a 1/4 cup of sugar and a couple teaspoons of vanilla and they were PERFECT!  I didn't think they tasted overly eggy but without the sugar and vanilla they weren't sweet enough for me. I like my pancakes to be a little sweet on their own because I don't eat them with syrup. Enjoy!

This is way too eggy. They also did fluff up quite nicely while they were cooking, but the second you took them off the heat, they fell terribly, not making these fluffy at all.  And 3 eggs for 1 cup of flour and milk seems excessive.  I will not make these again.

These did turn out really fluffy but tasted too much like egg for my tastes. next time i would use maybe one less egg to see if that makes any difference.

We made these one Sunday morning after browsing recipes and were very pleased with the outcome. Although it is not the most simple of pancake recipes, they do come out very light and fluffy and still have the normal pancake taste you would expect. Good enough to even eat on their own.

These were fantastic! So light and fluffy I didn't notice an overly eggy taste I thought they were by far the best pancakes I have ever had and I hate pancakes. In face I am off to make some now!

I made these exactly as directed and they were awesome! I didn't add any vanilla or sugar as other reviewers suggested, simply because we topped them with butter and maple syrup ~ plenty of sweetness there. This is the recipe I'll use for pancakes from now on. Thanks W King!

Very good! I made them for my husband for our anneversary and we both ate way too many because they were so good.  I did leave out one yolk for fear they would be too eggy and they came out nice and fluffy.  I will definately make these again.

Very easy to put together, but lacking flavor.  The pancakes came out to be very thin and had an overwhelming taste of egg.  I almost wish I used the 3 eggs it called for to make a nice omelette :)

These pancakes came out pretty good, though I would say they're more of an "Egg Pancake", definately a different flavor than your average pancake.  They came out pretty fluffy, more so than regular light fluffy pancakes, and slightly thicker as well.  I did add a bit of salt/sugar to the recipe, they came out very tasteful, again a nice change from the usual pancake.  They do require more effort to make, but will still be a special treat in our household.

I followed the recipe exactly and sort of wish I hadn't; they came out very fluffy but tasted very much like eggs.  I should have followed the advice of other reviewers and left out a few of the egg yolks, and it could've used some sugar and salt.

This is the only pancake recipe I've found on this site (and I've tried a bunch) that claim to be fluffy and actually are fluffy! Beating the egg whites requires some patience but the taste it produces is worth it. Family members told me these were the best pancakes they ever tasted. I will definitely make these again.

These pancakes tasted good (I used one less egg yolk) but were no fluffier than any other pancakes I've made. Yummy with Cinnabutter and butter pecan syrup.

I made these this morning and I thought they were good.  I could taste the egg but it wasn't too eggy but when I make them for other people I will definately use less yolks.  Also I never ever make good pancakes but these browned perfectly and evenly and while they were not fluffy enough I will try them again and beat my egg whites longer.  All in all I cannot see myself ever buying box mix again.  This is just too easy.

Mmm, yummy! I made these with a friend for breakfast on my birthday. We didn't have an electric beater, so we ended up using her cappucino frother and then a fork. Still very good and true to its name--fluffy! We served it with blueberry sauce (made from frozen blueberries) and it was a real treat.

The easy-to-make batter produces very tender pancakes.The recipe would benefit with either cinnamon, nutmeg, or lemon etc. to give it some added flavor.  But otherwise , this recipe is excellent.

Wonderful pancakes!  I love the taste and easy to prepare!  My hubby isn't crazy for pancakes all that much, but when he tried these he loved them and now he even asks me to make them for him!  This is a keeper and I make it quite a bit.  Will never buy pancake mix again!

Blech.  This was like eating congealed scrambled eggs.  I won't make this again, but if I had to, I'd definitely cut out most of the egg yolk and add some sugar.

In the pancakes' defense, my husband said they were "not all that bad" - not exactly a resounding endorsement.

I have never found a more simple or delicious, light and fluffy pancake. Even the big manly men commented that they had never had better. We were concerned at the lack of sugar but with syrup, we didn't miss it for a moment.

Wonderful recipe. Only, I too got the eggy taste but maybe I did it wrong, what with forgetting to foldin 1/3 of the egg whites in the batter and instead doing all at once. Really I just think that made my pancakes not so fluffy. In fact, they were rather thin. I was hoping for a thicker pancake. Either way, to offset the eggy taste I DID, add some vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and I put butter in the pan.

These are the best! I  add a smidgin of stevia and sometimes I substitute 1/2 of the flower quarter each coconut  and almond flower.  I always top with fresh strawberries! 
Also great with matcha powder added.

Very nice looking.

I made it without the baking powder and it still came out light and fluffy!  Fluffiest pancakes ever, just from the whipped egg whites.   Gotta whip them to hard peaks and I had added 1T sugar to the whites before whipping .  I only used two yolks but added 1t vanilla to the batter.  Come to think of it, it's enough of a departure that maybe it should have its own recipe.   But baking powder is no longer necessary in pancakes!

Delicious. Love the higher protein, egg to flour ratio. Beating the egg whites keeps the batter light and fluffy. I always add a tbsp of bacon fat or butter to the mix for a nice golden brown, slightly crispy exterior.

As other reviewers state, it's eggy. Other than that, there was not much flavor. Very bland. Nice texture though.

light and fluffy-yes. but completely lacking in flavor. After the first one was done & didn't pass the flavor test, I added 1/4c sugar & 2tsp vanilla. much better!

I love it! I did not alter recipe I unfortunately only had two eggs in my fridge but I followed it just using 2 instead of 3 and I fell in love. Very fluffy and perfect with butter n syrup. Thank you for this recipe!

As fluffy as it's called,and yummy too! i didn't even notice the 'egginess' mention in most of the reviews, or maybe it's just me. The recipe is simple and minimal ingredients needed is a plus for me. Definitely will be using this recipe from now on.

I love this recipe, and i use it whenever I feel like eating pancakes. These pancakes are super light and fluffy, and taste good even when they're cold or slightly burnt. Even though it uses three eggs, I don't think it is eggy at all. Rather, really make sure that your egg whites are beaten to stiff peaks. 
I add 1/8 sugar, a dash of salt, and some vanilla to the batter, and 1/8 sugar to the egg whites.
Optional, but you can add chopped up chocolate to the batter, and they leave melted pockets of gooey chocolatey-ness. Yum.

I honestly chose recipe because it had the fewest ingredients. My 5 year old keeps bugging me for pancakes and doesn't care if I don't know how to make them. So I  did my best Swedish Chef impersonation, while she looked at me like I am crazy,  and set out to  learn the art of Pancake.  Wow they actually turned out and my daughter is happy.  Now that Daddy has made pancakes once I see a lot of pancakes in my future. This recipe bailed me out. Thanks.

I loved these!  Yes, they were very egg-y, so don't make them if you like egg-y pancakes.  I like them because they are low on flour but still fluffy.  I used orange juice instead of milk and added apricots and quick oats.

W King thank you so much for sharing this wonderful, delicious and perfect recipe. This recipe is perfect just as it is. I have made it many times and did not find it to be "eggy."  Nor, were there any other problems. The leftover batter is even perfect the next day. I will definitely keep making these. In fact, I am making some tonight for dinner. Will serve them with balsamic strawberries. I purchased balsamic vinegar that was aged 10 years and it is fantastic. This recipe deserves them!

Love these pancakes! I didn't have milk on hand so I replaced with soy milk and it's still delicious! Added 1/8 of sugar to the egg whites and about a tsp of vanilla & pinch of salt to the wet ingredients.

To make sure the pancakes didn't get soggy I placed them on a cooling rack. They came out perfectly! I will definitely be making this recipe again in the future :)

This recipe was awful. I can honestly say these were the worst pancakes I have ever had in my life.  They did come out somewhat fluffy, but rubbery at the same time.

These were pretty good.  I only used 1 egg yolk like some people recommended, and they didn't taste like egg at all.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar.  Next time I will add some vanilla extract. I made them for my bf for breakfast this morning, and he had 2 helpings, so they have to be pretty good! LOL  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

It was delicious but I added 1/4 cup of sugar, dash of nutmeg, and a bit of vanilla extract. It got more flavor and a distinctive sweetness. I also used 2 yolks and 3 whites instead of 3 yolks so it wouldn't be too eggy

While these are very fluffy, the flavor is really lacking. I think this could be a 5 star recipe with a few changes. I did add some vanilla to the egg whites, only used 2 yolks, and added a TBSP of sugar to the dry mix. Even still, like other reviewers, I tasted nothing but egg. However, it wasn't from the yolk, but rather the whites. I would try this recipe again, but instead of 3 whites, only use 1 and substitute the milk for buttermilk...keep the vanilla & sugar, and work from there. I like the idea of incorporating the egg whites, but 3 is just too many for this recipe.

Not sure what I did wrong.  They had a great texture, but they tasted kinda funky.  Next time I'll try leaving out two of the egg yolks and adding a tablespoon of sugar.

This recipe was great for its fluffy-ness but definitely lacked in flavour even after i added 1 tblsp of vanilla and 2 tblsp of sugar (to a double recipe). So I think maybe I might play around with this a bit more and see, maybe add some buttermilk? It was good though doused in maple syrup!

I seem to be having trouble getting my pancakes to rise. Does anyone have any suggestions? I am using new baking powder and my pan is usually at 350. I saw that the pictures pancakes for this recipe where big and fluffy but mine where very flat and this seems to be common thing for me latly, even with other recipes. These pancakes where very tender and yummy despite being vertically challanged.

Being the pancake Connoisseur that I am..I am still trying to figure out what went wrong. I tried this recipe and they were far from fluffy. I contemplated throwing the recipe out, but tried them again. The same thing happened. I would love to know what I keep doing wrong? I have made many pancakes in my time and this has never happened, let alone twice. HELP!!!!

Although the pancakes did turn out very fluffy, they had absolutely no taste!  I took the advise from others and only used 2 egg yokes and added white sugar and vanilly, but found them bland anyway.  I will try to use the technique of separating the whites with another recipe, but will not use this one again!

They tasted like eggs. I added cinnamon, and they still tasted like eggs. The egg whites were stiff enough, but they still tasted like eggs, not pancakes. Well, floury eggs. They might be better if you took out an egg. Otherwise, choose something else.

WOW!! These are amazing. They're so light, they melt in your mouth. I didn't get that eggy flavor some reviewers complained about and I like the fact that they are bland because the topping possibilities are endless.Thanks for a great recipe. I will never make pancakes any other way.

THESE PANCAKES WERE LIGHT AND FLUFFY AND THEY MELTED IN THE MOUTH. I ADDED SOME VANILLA EXTRACT FOR A LITTLE EXTRA KICK BUT OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE TO THE RECIPE. THESE ARE GOOD WITH SOME MAPLE SYRUP OR TOPPED WITH FRUIT AND WHIPPED CREAM. I WOULD MAKE THESE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

I really liked the consistency of the pancake.  I paired it up with the Coconut Syrup recipe from this site and it made up for the lack of sugar in the pancake.

I was disappointed to find that this pancake turned out very bland and tasteless, even after I added cinnamon and vanilla.  The texture and fluffiness was perfect, it just had no flavor.  For the second batch, I added blueberries to the mix and that helped.  Maybe sugar would have helped.  I probably won't make this again.

These are GREAT!!! They do tend to be a little eggy, but they remind me of French Toast without all the weight in your tummy. If they are too eggy for you use Medium eggs. I also added sugar to the egg whites and vanilla to the wet mixture and they were perfect! My husband who isn't a big breakfast food person(especially pancakes) absolutely LOVED them.

YUM!!  I'm going to delete the other pancake recipe that I saved to my recipe box after tasting these! The batter seemed very thin so I did add 1/4 c. more flour and added a little sugar. Other than that no real changes were made. My kids loved them as well.

Excellent recipe! I used a level-ish tablespoon of caster sugar as well, but I could have added more. I found the recipe produced 12 pancakes, each made from a quarter-cup of the batter. 

Vanilla essence and more sugar will be in the mixture next time. 

I used an electric whisk beater thing to beat the egg whites, and it took long enough with that. You'd be an idiot to try to do it by hand. 

W King is a pancake genius!

I added the sugar and half a tablespoon of cinnamon to the dry mix, did not add anything to the egg whites. They turned out okay, Definently better than a Bisquick mix would have. Half a tablespoon if cinnamoin was a bit much next time I think I would only add a full teaspoon. I also dont think I whipped the egg whites enough, they were still a bit runny. I will definently make these again just I will play around with the recipie a bit more.

I saw this recipe and thought to myself "seperating the eggs, of course" and was eager to try. The result was that it's a good idea but my family found them dry and bland. I'll try them again and add sugar and reduce egg.

Wonderful!  I added just a little sugar (Splenda actually) but otherwise did it exactly as written.  I didn't think it was too eggy at all.  My husband and kids LOVED it too, even the 18 month-old!  I won't be buying pancake mix anymore!

Very good pancakes.  Compared to my normal bisquick version pancakes, these ones were lighter and spongier, though not really thicker.  You could almost call these "angel food pancakes" because of the texture.  My mother decided it would be okay to deviate from her diet just for today so she could eat one, and she enjoyed it.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I threw out one egg yolk as suggested by others.

These were just ok. I followed everything the recipe said. I thought they were really rather bland despite adding more sugar & vanilla. Texture definitlely didn't "melt in my mouth"! I will continue to look for "The perfect pancake recipe..."
