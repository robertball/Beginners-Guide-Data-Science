This is a very good recipe, but the cooking time is a little off. The peppers don't need to cook for 20 minutes, and in that amount of time the garlic gets very dark. I agree with vegascook - too much flour. 1/4 cup would probably be enough to dust the shrimp. The next time, though, I may skip the dusting and just sprinkle some flour into the skillet to thicken the sauce.

I made this an my whole family loved it.  Regarding comments from other reviewers, I cooked the garlic and peppers for 20 minutes, as I thought this would infuse the flavor into the oil more, which it did.  I just had to adjust the temperature to ensure the oil did not boil and burn the peppers.  Also regarding the flour.  Next time I plan to sift the flour and use less, but I save the cooking liquid from the pasta and added about a cup back to the sauce to loosen it, I also added the pasta back to the sauce to finish cooking.  Next time I will add more olive oil and garlic but less lemon.  I may even experiment with finishing it with a tablespoon or two of cream.  All in all this recipe is a winner because the base recipe works and there are infinite modifications you can make to suit your taste that work as well.

I made this for my wife because she loves shrimp scampi. This is now her preferred recipe. She has already asked me to make it again.

This was ultimately very good (five stars), but not without a good deal of tinkering, not least of which reducing the cooking time drastically- this should come together in less time than it takes to cook the pasta!  I used a combination of butter and olive oil to cook the bell pepper and garlic - for a few minutes, not 20.  Added a glug of white wine, no lemon juice and let that cook off a little and reduce before adding the tomatoes.  Cooked that for a few minutes, then added the shrimp, cooking them just a few minutes, NOT the total of 8-10 minutes the recipe directs you to.  Oh my, these would be some really overcooked, tough shrimp if cooked that long.  And don't bother to dust the shrimp in flour - there's just no reason to.  So, using a combination of butter and olive oil, omitting the flour and lemon juice, letting the wine reduce and cook off awhile  and only cooking the shrimp a few minutes  - quite simply stunningly delicious.

A very good and different scampi recipe! I did not use the flour on the shrimp, but did add a little cornstarch at the end to thicken, otherwise made it as directed and it was great!

This recipe was great!  My family all liked it, and had seconds.  The sauce turns out thick and almost creamy, not too spicy at all.  I had to use dried minced garlic instead of fresh, and all I had was frozen cooked shrimp.  Since the shrimp was already cooked, I eliminated the step where you cook the shrimp, and it worked perfectly.  I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because with proper ingredients (fresh shrimp anyone?) it would easily blow other scampis out of the water.

Very enjoyable.  Looks like it takes longer than it really does.  Nice light and flavorful sauce that can easily be adjusted to suit your likes.  This recipe is a keeper and will be replacing my usual scampi dish.

Very good!  I used some of the garlic oil to saute peppers and zucchini, steamed some snap peas, and added it all to the sauce in the end, topped with chopped turkey bacon.  YUM!

This was yummy.  I would however, agree with other reviewers, the amount of flour was way too much.  Also the cooking time for the pepper, garlic, etc., mixture was too long.  I served this over basmati rice and we really enjoyed it, but did follow other reviewers suggestions.  Thanks so much for posting your recipe.

Absolutely delicious!! I add a couple handfuls of fresh spinach 5 minutes before it's done and cut down the butter to 1.5 T. Serve over whole wheat pasta with garlic bread and this recipe is to die for!

Excellent recipe!  One cup of flour was too much - a light dusting works great to thicken the sauce.  Would also cut the amount lemon juice down - just alittle too tart.  This is a definate keeper!

Mmmmmm! I volunteer as a cook at a local hospice. Today I asked one resident what he'd like and he was unsure. As soon as I suggested shrimp with garlic and butter, he was sure that's what he wanted. I gave this a try and it was fabulous! I omitted the red bell pepper and added some butter with the olive oil in the first step (fat and calories are not an issue with people in their final days!). Of course when they could smell the garlic and then the shrimp the employees and the other volunteer were drawn to the kitchen for a sample! It was unanimous - this recipe is a winner. Thank you, Laura, for bringing some enjoyment to dear Vincent. He won't be with us much longer but today he's eating well!

Wonderful!!. I did not dredge the shrimp in flour, just cooked it in the wonderful sauce.  I did add to the pan right before serving some cooked small penne pasta that absorbed all that wonderful flavors and sauce. I will cook it again and again for sure.

This is an excellent recipe!! I have also been trying different scampi recipes in search of the perfect one... without going to a restaurant, and this is it! The length of cooking time in the beginning can be reduced, especially if you tend to burn garlic easily. The amount of flour is not really critical either. It depends on your shrimp and the leftover is discarded anyhow. I added a touch of honey too after reading the reviews, but don't know if it was even necessary. It was delicious!

My boyfriend and I were unimpressed as it was very bland in our opinion.  I even added extra red bell pepper, garlic and butter to try to make it taste better plus some Italian Seasoning as one reviewer recommended.  The recipe doesn't call for salt and pepper, however, I finally started adding some to try to make it tastier.  My boyfriend said it could still stand more salt.  Not sure why there is no salt and pepper in the recipe?  It definitely has room for improvement.  Pretty sure I won't try it again and will move on to another recipe.

This was excellent.  Easy & Simple.  I did take the advice of some previous reviewers & 1) heated the bell pepper/red pepper prior to adding the garlic - 20 mins you'd end up w/ burned, bitter garlic 2) used less lemon juice (about 1 Tbsp) and 3) dusting the mixture w/ flour instead of dredging the shrimp & it was delicious. Just added salt & pepper upon finishing & served over penne pasta. Tangy, flavorful Perfection!

I decided to try this even though I didn't have red peppers, lemon juice, or tomatoes. I did everything else as described and the result was delicious! The flour from the dredging makes the sauce thicken nicely. I probably added extra wine and/or butter to make up for the missing lemon juice (not sure how much I added by the end), but the sauce consistency was just fine. Nice and garlicky... not exactly low-fat, though.

This dish was amazing. I used a half a cup of flour instead of a cup and used a bell pepper instead of a red one and it still turned out fantastic. also added more garlic. Will definitely make again.

Very good. Only thing i did differently was use more like 6 or 7 cloves of garlic since i like garlic, and i only had an orange pepper, so used it instead of orange.  Left out the red pepper flakes and added salt and pepper to taste.  My 6 year old said when i told him what we were having "i'm only going to eat the shrimp" but then he gobbled up the pasta too in the sauce and like 10 shrimp!  So 2 thumbs up for kids - as long as it's not spicy.

My husband and I did not prefer the shrimp dusted with flour - though the idea sounded good.  In our dinner, the flour stuck to the shrimp but the flour seemed to make the shrimp mushy.   We did like the addition of the bell pepper- we also added broccoli which went well and heated up some crusty bread.

I cooked the initial ingredients for 20 minutes. That turned out quite fine on low heat. What I learned was that for half my party, they would like their own version. One wanted more garlic,  while I actually found 2/3 cup of wine to be just a little too much. The texture was great, just perfect... the taste was excellent, although like I said, I'll use a little less wine next time, perhaps 1/2 cup. This is a pretty heavy meal although it doesn't seem it at the time you are eating. Overall, this is a really easy recipe that can be fit to taste over time. This was my first time making it, but definitely not my last. Having read the previous notes, I used about 1/2-3/4 cup flour and about 1.5 TBS of lemon juice...

This smells fabulous and tasted so great.  I didn't have a red pepper so I used two large Roma tomatoes.  The shrimp soaks up the garlic and red pepper and even my 6 year old ate several.  The sauce was a little thicker than regular scampi and we loved that!  My husband:  "I would eat this again!"  That's high praise!    It didn't take as long as the time estimates given, but I had help peeling the shrimp.  I started the oil and garlic in the pan and then started the pasta and by the time the pasta was done, I was removing the shrimp from the pan so I could crank up the heat to thicken it faster.   It was done and on the table in about 30 minutes.

This was delicious! Not bland at all like a few other reviewers wrote. My garlic cloves were the equal to 6 small ones. This needed a lot of garlic. Made a big difference. Luckily my tomatoes, red pepper & parsley came from my garden so everything was super fresh. I used penne pasta instead of rice. The sauce was so yummy. I may make this with chicken eventually. My shrimp were 16/20 & were fresh from the gulf coast. Made all the difference! Some people mentioned there was too much lemon juice! That was the key to the freshness of this dish. I would even use 3tb the next time. If the pasta absorbs the sauce, keep a 1/2 c of pasta water on hand to loosen it up.

I hate to start my review on a bad foot, but.... This did not suit my hubs or I at all (sorry!). Not only was this nothing like any scampi we've ever had, it was overwhelmingly lemony and just plain odd tasting. I must admit, I had high hopes initially. The combination of ingredients sounded intriguing to me. The preparation method also appealed to me and despite others warnings, I went ahead and sauteed my garlic / bell peppers for 20 minutes as directed (gasp!). If you keep your heat source on the lowest setting possible, your garlic will NOT burn. Had I not sauteed my garlic for as long as I did, I wouldn't have even noticed it was a component of this dish (sautéing low and slow helps to infuse a nice, subtle garlic flavor). For those of you wanting to give this a try, I have two suggestions to offer. First, cut the amount of lemon juice in HALF (or at least to 1.5 T)! Lastly, start with 1/4 c. flour and increase if necessary. The key is to LIGHTLY dredge your shrimp. A quarter cup of flour was spot on - my sauce was slightly thickened as it  should be, not pasty as it could have been. Served over jasmine rice with a side of garlic herb pasta (found in my grocer's frozen foods section) and garlic breadsticks, this was an "OK" meal. Although I won't be making this again, I'm glad to have given your recipe a try. Thanks anyways, NORELLAURA. :-)

This was super delicious!  I do agree a cup is WAY to much flour so I used a good quarter cup which worked great.  No parsley here but still very yummy!

The shrimp tasted good, but the sauce came out way to running and almost clumpy. It was too much work for what it was worth. I am sure that I will not make this again, there are easier and much quicker shrimp scampi recipes out there.

I just wanted a good traditional scampi recipe and this one looked good, so I made this recipe last night.  However, I altered it using 1.5 lbs of Tiger Prawns (cause that's what I had) and the juice of about 1 1/2 lemons (because I LOVE lemon on my seafood), 4 Tbsp butter, and did not do the peppers...  I added some fresh ground peppper and some dry italian herb seasoning instead. I also added probably a full cup of wine.  It turned out AWESOME!  The only thing that went wrong was there may have been a little too much flour which made the sauce a little pastier than I would have liked.  I just quickly dipped them in flour too, I didn't cake them in it.  I did not know what "drudge" meant... still after having looked it up, I do not understand the context in the recipe.  I ASSUMED it meant LIGHTLY FLOUR...  LOL   Still my light flouring was too much.  Again, be careful too just dust them or skip the flour all together.  In the end, my wife LOVED IT, and so did I!!!!

I made a few changes to avoid going to the store, I used frozen pepper strips, and a can of diced tomatoes, oh and I used pre cooked shrimp. I was not too thrilled with the results. Maybe next time I will follow the recipe exactly, that is if there is a next time.

Easy and delicious!  I had never cooked shrimp before, but these came out cooked "to perfection."  I used jarred roasted red peppers rather than raw because of their texture and flavor of the oil.

This came out pretty good but the recipe's instructions needed several adjustments.  The first  mistake I saw in the instructions  was frying the garlic and pepper flakes for 20 minutes on medium heat.  That would have become terribly bitter.  Also you should have your shrimp prepared before you turn on the heat.  Fry the garlic, red bell pepper, and pepper flakes about 3 minutes or just until the garlic starts to become golden.  Then add butter to pan (about  another 3 - 4 Tablespoons additional than recipe asks for)  and add floured shrimp.  Once shrimp becomes golden brown make a well in the center of the pan add 2 T more of Olive oil in well and add in tomatoes. Let tomatoes cook down a bit in the well while frequently turning the shrimp.  Once the tomatoes start to cook down add the wine and lemon juice.   2 Tablespoons of lemon seems like a lot.  I added only 2 tsp of lemon juice.

I too have been tinkering with a recipe similar to this. I remembered how much I love Olive Gardens' chicken scampi.
I included julienned red pepper and red onions. I really enjoyed all the flavors that developed!

Very good, I was going to try without the flour but went ahead and followed everything, it was different than what I am used to but a very good and easy recipe to make, oh and I used a yellow pepper instead of red because I had a half of a large one on hand.  I had to go lite on red pepper due to 99 yo mother in law but added extra to my plate.

Made this for our anniversary dinner and pretty much stuck to the recipe word for word.  Found like others that the peppers and garlic didn't need a full 20 mins.  More like 12 mins.  Flour didn't need as much just enough to coat.  I used a little less butter too.  Poured the scampi out into a bowl then added two portions of linguini to the pan to get any juices and bits.  Then added spooned out shrimp, peppers, tomatoes and sauce.   Made presentation beautiful.  I added a tiny bit of fresh grated Parmigiana along with the parsley.  

Wife loved it said it was one of the best dinners I've ever made & way better than her scampi!  #winning

Love this! I followed the recipe as far as ingredients, but the peppers only needed to cook for about 8 minutes and it's perfect. I added cooked angel hair pasta to the dish and tossed. All the flavors blend so nicely. Absolutely my favorite scampi recipe so far!

This was my first attempt at a scampi and I must say, it was perfect. I added a lil extra red peppers as I like the kick. Followed others advice and did not cook the peppers as long and added the garlic when the peppers were half done. My momma loved it to!!

Great tasting light dish.
I added tomatoes with about 2 minutes left, so they weren't soft and without flavor. Don't be afraid to use recommended amount or more of garlic.  And the 20 minutes cook time is perfect - it infuses all the flavors together.

The whole Fam liked this. My snobby seafood husband, 10 yr old and myself. Next time I'd add more red pepper flakes and I threw in yellow and orange pepper in addition to the red. It made it sweet, hence maybe why I could have used more pepper flakes. I also crack blk pepper into the flour before dredging. I will def make this for company. With noodles and fresh bread and some asparagus you can't go wrong.

Just made it tonite and had to give it 5 stars, I read the other reviews and cut down on the lemon and cooked the bell peppers half the time, dipped the shrimp in the flour, then cooked it. The sauce thickens real nice and very nice flavor sauce. Served it over angel hair pasta, sprinkled a little fresh parm. cheese, my husband loved it! Will make this again,Mahalo.

This is an excellent scampi recipe, adding the chopped pepper and tomato gives it an extra kick, I also added a teaspoon of honey to cut back on the acid. I just sprinkled a little flour over the shrimp before cooking. I've never done this when making scampi before but it does help thicken the sauce, I served over spaghetti yummy! Thanks for a great dish.

This was delicious!  My four year old loves the sauce but not seafood, so I threw some edamame in his pasta instead.  So simple and wonderful.  I did not use the flour step beause I used precooked shrimp and didn't want them chewy.
