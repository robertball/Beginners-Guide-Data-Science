The white beans are delicious in this.  Yummy flavor with the butternut squash. Great combination!

This is a delicious soup.  The only change that I made was use 1 quart chicken stock, and 1 quart water.  We ate it the first night and the second night we topped it with spinach, and let it cook until the spinach was soft.  Would definitely make it again.

Two great tasting ingredients in one fantastic soup. I made the recipe exact and it was very good. Next time I will add some bacon to zip it up a little. Will make again!

This is a fabulous soup. Followed directions as given but used vegetable broth instead of chicken bullion. Velvety smooth, more body than butternut soup without the beans. Very flavorful with the chicken sausage. LOVED IT!

Really good soup. Not actually a huge fan of squash soup in general but had something like this at a friends and loved it and have been looking for a recipe. It does not have that "baby food" consistency some puréed soups have. ! I added an apple minced with the carrots and squash, upped the spices a bit and added maybe 1/8 tsp cloves. Also used 2 cans beans because found the recipe last minute and didn't have time to soak dry ones.

I used salt-free chicken broth instead of bullion cubes and used half the salt. I also added a lot more water and it was still a thick soup - didn't look like the picture. It was tasty and had interesting flavors. My family didn't like it as much as I did, so it is not a soup for everyone.

This soup was delicious! I used black eyed peas because I didn't have northern beans. I used 1 quart chicken broth + 1 quart water instead of bouillon. I simmered the carrots, celery and squash with the beans for the last 20 minutes, then pulled out all of the celery (hubby and I aren't fond of the texture of celery) and about half of the rest of the vegetables and beans, and pureed them in the blender with broth and returned the puree to the pot. I didn't have chicken sausage, so I cooked ground pork with the garlic, onions, and Italian sausage seasoning, and added it to the soup after the puree step. Served with fresh flax and quinoa bread.

This is a unique, tasty soup! I used butter instead of vegetable oil due to preference and canned beans that didn't have to soak. Next time I'll tone down the allspice, it was an interesting flavor but a bit too prevalent in my opinion.

My husband and I really like this soup.  I used 2 bags of frozen cubed butternut squash, and added some turmeric, poultry seasoning, and used Everglades Seasoning instead of the salt.  I didn’t have White beans, but used a can of garbanzo beans instead .... I will be making this again.

Loved it!! I cut the recipe in half but doubled spices because preference .... I used leftover roasted squash and veg broth ( just vegetarians tonight ) and canned white beans for ease.  I also sautéed the carrot and onion in EVOO till tinder, added the fresh ginger and garlic.... 2 min.....then the broth.... Simmer it all for over an hour before hitting it with the stick blender (your life is not whole without one) then let it simmer to thickened a little. I didn't add chicken (veggie night) but all was well! Thank you for sharing!!!!

the recipe was simple and turned out really good. I used frozen organic butternut squash packages, instead of fresh squash, and it work just the same as fresh, just made it a little easier and more convenient for me.

Very simple and versatile soup.  I used canned beans and grilled the squash and onions before adding to the broth.  Excellent!!
