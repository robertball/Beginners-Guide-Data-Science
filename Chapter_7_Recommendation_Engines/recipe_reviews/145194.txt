I just tried this a few weeks ago for the first time. Very good and very easy. I didn't peel the yams, scrubbed them good instead. I drizzeled with olive oil and then the salt and pepper.

Loved them!  I too put the sweet potatoes in the microwave for just 4 minutes to start the cooking process, then put them on the grill.  Brushed with butter, then added a little Splenda brown sugar on top at the end to carmelize.  Yum!!

We're trying to be heart healthy, so instead of the salt, I added Garlic Powder, Paprika, Cayenne Pepper, and Chili Pepper to try to zest them up a bit. We skipped the butter. Tasted delicious (even without the butter and salt!)

I liked it, except I cut the slices crosswise and dipped them in olive oil.

Also since I like brown sugared sweet potatoes, I took about 6 or so of slices,  put wrapped them in foil with some butter, brown sugar and ice  cubes.  I put the package on the grill until the sweet potato slices were soft.  Yum!

I modified this recipe by first steaming the yam slices for about 5 minutes and substituted the olive oil with a butter honey mixture and then sprinkled with cinnamon & sugar.  Everyone loved them!

Yum! I did burn about half of them because I wasn't paying close enough attention, so make sure you keep an eye on them! Super tasty. Thanks :)

This was great.  I only added butter for my guests.  I try to watch added fat and just plain it was absolutely delicious.  I did this in a grill pan and it worked perfectly on medium high heat.  I will  make these often!

I took the other reviewers advice and pre-cooked these for a couple mins. in the microwave. I also added a little brown sugar to the oil olive to add some sweetness. All in all these were good... my husband loved them.

Brown sugar is the key to this recipe.  You can definitely be heart healthy and cook per the recipe, but to achieve the best taste, add a little brown sugar and cinnamon.  Great way to serve a different version of yams.  Thank you Foxy!

10-12 minutes per side? Only if your fire is not hot. Pretty tasty, but as others have written, you better pay close attention or they will be burned.

Need to try again. Be sure to watch added salt! It can completely ruin them.

Ehh.  I guess you really have to like yams to like these.  I would have much preferred a mashed version with a little bit of brown sugar.  But my fiance liked them.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were very good - and a nice change from mashed yams.  I agree with another reviewer that the high heat is a little much - the yams charred VERY quickly and we had to move them to a higher level on the grill.  Maybe medium-high heat? Great recipe!

I put my yams in the microwave for about 6 mins before putting them on the grill. I put them into a tin (throw-away) roaster pan. They did burn a little, but I liked the burnt pieces best.

Guess I should have kept a closer eye on the yams because they burnt to a crisp! One minute they were fine and the next they were totally black. A few pieces managed to be saved, but they were a bit dry and didn't have much flavor. Don't think I'll be grilling yams again.

I saw these in the magazine and thought it would be a nice change of pace. It was good, but a very basic recipe. Next time I would spice it up, thanks for the idea!
