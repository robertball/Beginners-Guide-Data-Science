I'm rating this a 5 because the consistency is perfect; thick enough but not too much so that if one wanted to make a meatsauce out of it, the spoon would not stand up straight in the middle of the pot. Also a 5 star for ease of preparation and ingredients one tends to have on hand.  I did have to add 2 more cloves of garlic but I am a garlic lover.  1 clove just did not seem to do it justice.  I followed exactly and used a 'Mier's Winecellar white table wine'.  I added the 1/2 cup and it was not overpowering.  I love to cook w/wines but don't drink it and although I could taste it, it wasn't overpowering.  It seemed to enhance the flavor and didn't hinder it.  It also is a sweeter sort of wine so thought it would help with that sauce tartness thing we all try to fix.  I did have to add 1 Tbsp. of BROWN sugar and that took care of it.  **I recently saw on Food Network that if you use BROWN sugar in any redsauce, it helps with that tartness fix better than white.** Thanks for the great recipe.  I'm going to let it sit in fridge overnight and make eggplant parm. tomorrow.

Incredible sauce!!!  Instead of stewed tomatoes I used crushed tomatoes so there was no need for the food processor.  I fried the onions in 3 cloves of minced garlic and added 1 tsp. of dried basil, used 1 Tbsp. of dried parsley instead of fresh, and added 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Other than those additions this was perfect over angel hair pasta and chicken parmesan!

I have made this so, so many times -- and it is phenomenal.  I typically make 3x this much (as long as I'm going to all the work!) and then freeze it in family dinner-size portions.  I make the following changes (these amounts are for the regular-size recipe, without doing the 3x): add almost 1 tsp. dried basil; use only 1/4 cup white wine; add 1 T. sugar; use canned, diced tomatoes instead of stewed; use only 2 T. olive oil.  Although I made it once as just a marinara sauce (and it was excellent as such), I typically make this with meatballs; after forming the meatballs and browning them on all sides in a pan with about 1/2 inch of hot vegetable oil, I drain them and then throw them right into the sauce, where they finish cooking through while the sauce is simmering.  Definitely adds a lot of flavor to the sauce.  Yummy.

Very nice sauce.
Some tips: For those who enjoy garlic, use 1 1/2 to 2 cloves. I used 3 and that was a bit much!
I added 1/4 tsp of medium-heat red pepper flakes for some heat. Yummy! Use 1/3 less oil. If you cook this in a large sauce pan, skillet or fryer, you'll only need to cook it for 15 minutes, not 30. I added a little extra seasoning - as the other reviewers recommended. I also added 1/2 can of tomato sauce because I wanted more sauce for dipping garlic bread into and for the 1/2 pound of meatballs I made.
Refridgerates/reheats very well. Will make again.

I substituted chicken broth for the white wine. It was quick, easy and very good the first day.  But absolutely wonderful if the ingredients get a chance to "marry" in the fridge for a few days.  I'm going to make this in bulk, let it "age" then freeze it so I always have some on hand.  Delicious!

I usually buy a certain brand of marinara sauce and then freeze it, but I wanted to see if I was getting my money's worth. And now I know that I wasn't!  I followed recipe exactly except I added a clove of garlic, a good handful of Italian seasoning, 2 onions that I *accidentally* cooked to almost caramelized.  I'll never buy it again!
**On a second note, I've now used the frozen batch, and it freezes great!  Now it's five stars.
**On a third note, if you don't know what to do with the leftover wine and you don't drink it, you can freeze it in ice cube trays for the next time you make this.
**My favorite wine with this so far is a Canadian Riesling.  I do NOT like it with red, it has a funny flavor.

GREAT SAUCE. If you try no other try this one. Added fresh basil as well as a bit of sugar to counter the acidity of the tomatoes. Simmering too long degrades the flavor.

Awesome easy sauce, easy enough that I don't ever use a sauce from a jar anymore, I always keep all ingredients, in the pantry for a double batch, to go with homemade meatballs.  This always gets rave reviews when I serve it.  Make sure to use stewed tomatoes, since they have the cooked flavor and the onion and peppers cooked in, just regular canned tomatoes will not have this cooked flavor, which is the key to this having that long cooked flavor, without cooking it all day.

Wow. Great recipe. I used canned crushed tomato's and eliminated the entire food processor step. Added a bay leaf and simmered for half hour and added a tsp of butter at the end to smooth out the acidity. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  I made this sauce at a food demo for a grocery store and it was a big hit.  I changed recipe though--used crushed tomates; no parsley; 4 cloves garlic; no oregano or salt; added 2 tsp. Italian seasoning; 1 T sugar; cut back a bit on the olive oil.  Made this with chicken floured and seasoned with Italian seasoning.  Will definitely make again!

I've made this dozens of times, and have made a couple of changes along the way: First, I use canned whole tomatoes (the closest thing you can get to fresh tom's, imo) that I split with my fingers, remove the seeds (which only make the sauce bitter), then roughly chop. Second, I use tomato sauce instead of paste because it is not so acidic (I simmer the sauce a little longer so that it reduces to the desired consistency). Finally, I use a hand blender to puree the entire sauce until it is as smooth/chunky as we need it (smooth for marinara dipping sauce, chunky for pizza sauce, chunkier for pasta sauce etc). Oh, and it doesn't really matter if you use red or white wine, or omit it altogether (admittedly, the wine adds depth, but it's still great even without it). This is a simple and delicious marinara recipe that I use for pretty much everything! Thanks, Jackie!

Great marinara!  I halved the recipe since I didnt need as much.  Instead of pureeing, I just added the stewed tomatoes whole since I wanted it chunky.  After the sauce simmers a bit the tomatoes tend to break down anyways.  I also added more garlic, a little basil, and red wine instead of white.  This was great over top of some chicken parm that I was making!  It would be great over lots of other recipes as well.  Thanks so much for the great and easy recipe!  I will make many times more!

Wonderful Marinara sauce base!  As with all recipes, each cook 'tweaks' a recipe to his/her personal taste.  I found the sauce base to be very flavorable and easy to assemble.   I alway double my sauce  recipe so I can freeze any "left-overs". As we LOVE garlic, onion and bell peppers, I finely chop one large onion, finely mince and crush six of the largest garlic cloves I have, and chop one bell pepper.  I add the veggies to a large pot with 2 to 3 TBS of EVOO; saute all of them until soft, about 5 minutes. Then, I add to the pot: two 28-ounce cans of whatever type of canned tomatoes I have on hand, one 12-ounce can tomato paste, 1 cup white or red wine, 1 cup of grated Mozzarella, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan, 4 TBS of fresh (or 2 TBS dried) parsley, 4 TBS fresh (or 2 TBS dried) Oregano, 2 TBS fresh (or 1 TBS dried) Basil, 1/2 tsp dried Marjoram, 1/2 dried Rosemary,  1/2 tsp dried Thyme, 1 large dried Bay leaf, 1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes, 2 TBS brown sugar, salt and black pepper to taste. REMEMBER: WHEN USING DRIED HERBS (except the Bay Leaf), ALWAYS RUB THEM BETWEEN PALMS OF HANDS WHILE ADDING TO POT, AS THIS "WAKES" THE HERBS UP AGAIN. Bring sauce to boil over medium heat: turn down to low and continue simmering for at least 30 minutes, stirring occassionally. However, simmering longer lets all the flavors "meld" more. Remove Bay Leaf before serving sauce as Bay Leaf is very bitter.

I have cooked this dish a lot of times already. The first attempt, following the recipe to the dot was just ok. But then when I scanned most of the reviews I followed some and it became an instant hit to my family and friends. Friends were asking for the recipe. Here are the few changes I made: I just add another clove of minced garlic, a tablespoon of brown sugar since this is a red sauce, cut down the olive oil into 3, red pepper flakes, white wine and a bay leaf. Thank you so much Jackie for the best Marinara Sauce yet ...

This was a decent marinara, but it had a bitter taste and the wine flavor was too strong.  I felt like I was drinking a glass of wine while eating marinara sauce.  Next time, I'll use less wine and a little sugar.

THE BEST Sauce Yet is right!!! This one is off the charts in my opinion! One thing I highly recommend, though, is omitting the salt. Most canned tomato products have a high sodium content already(check the nutrition labels), so extra salt is not needed. This was the tastiest sauce I have ever served. I am so glad to have discovered this recipe. There is NO other option but to make my own sauce from now on, forget Ragu! Thanks for sharing....

Mmmm...delicious recipe. The best way to take the tartness/bitterness out of a tomato sauce is to add a tsp. of baking soda and stir for several minutes. It cuts the acidity of the tomatoes and creates a sweet, smooth sauce.

I was sitting here wondering what I was going to make for dinner. I ruffled through the pantry and found a few ingredients and came on here looking for a recipe to meet my needs. This was by far the best marinara sauce recipe I've ever had. I loved it. Didn't change a thing. YUMMY! Thanks. :o)

Absolutely delicious. I used petite-cut diced tomatoes  (didn't have stewed), 2 more cloves of garlic and simmered mine for about 1 hour. Added fresh basil (alot) and fresh oregano (a little) towards the end. The wine really makes this sauce outstanding. Thanks, Jackie.

This sauce is AWESOME! I doubled the garlic, added a tsp of dried basil and pureed muchrooms to put in too. It goes great with "Florentine Stuffed Chicken" (on allrecipes). I cooked the sauce in the crockpot from around lunch until dinnertime and it was super tasty (I am also a big crokpot fan). Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is one terrific sauce.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so had to use dried (halved the amount), and it still turned out super!  I did double (ok, almost triple) the amount of garlic, doubled the onion, and added sweet basil and a bit of sugar.  But don't leave out the wine...it's part of what makes this sauce taste so great!  And even with the paste, it's still not what I would consider a thick sauce (if you want thicker I would drain the tomatoes).  I can't wait to try this on lasagna!  And as for kid-friendly...my 2-year-old son ate TWO helpings of this over penne =).  Definitely a new staple for us!

I am making lasagna from a recipe I found on here but it called for jar sauce and I did not want to use sauce from a jar. Found this recipe and not only did it sound good but also easy. I decided to add more garlic as we love garlic and 1 clove just did not sound like enough, I added 4 cloves (did I mention we love garlic). I am also cooking for a crowd and several of them do not like onions so I put the onion & olive oil in the blender with the other ingredients so no one would know they were in there (I use this trick a lot). The last thing I did different was add fresh basil in with the parsley because I couldn't imagine marinara sauce without basil plus I have tons since I grow it. This sauce turned out wonderful and I will make it again and again!

This is a simple yet wonderful sauce anyone can make.  Using quality stewed tomato products is the key to get rid of the acidic flavor you usually find with the cheaper brands of canned tomatoes.  The longer you cook it, the better it tastes.  HINT: This sauce is absolutely amazing and company-worthy if you use merlot instead of wine.  Thanks for sharing!

My favorite marinara sauce yet!  I definitely increased the garlic to about 6 cloves for a double batch.  I used italian seasoning and some garli garni seasoning as well.  I used crushed tomatoes rather than stewed and sautee'd the garlic with the onion while adding some crushed red peppers.  My go to marinara for sure!

It was ok the first time I made this recipe, but it lacked something-I cut back to 3 tbls of Olive Oil, added 3 more cloves of garlic (we like garlic), 1 1/2 tsp of fresh Basil and 1 1/2 tsp of sugar (to cut the acidity). That improved the taste dramatically.

I made this ahead of time to let it sit for a few days and it was so good. My husband will not let me buy another premade marinara sauce again. It was a big hit for the whole family.

This was delicious. I had tomatoes from the garden so I made the following changes:
- cut an x on the bottom of the tomatoes - boiled and seeded them (although the seeds should disintegrate if you leave them in)
- used less oil to make it healthier
- added 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- added mushrooms and a yellow pepper that were about to go bad.  This ended up being delicious!
- added 1/2 tb brown sugar (the Splenda blend just because that's what I had) to balance the acidity
- added some garlic powder and dried basil at the end just for more flavor.

I served with turkey meatballs and whole wheat pasta.

This really is the best!  I use it for everything: chicken and eggplant parmesan, various pastas, and marinara dipping sauces.  Here are my changes: increase garlic to 3 cloves, cut the olive oil by half (to 3 TBS) and always use pinot grigio for the white wine.  I always have good results.  Yummy!

This is a good sauce.  I too made this to go along with the toasted ravioli on this site.  I added a teaspoon of sugar to counteract the "tartness" from the tomatoes and toward the end of cooking time threw in about 3/4 of a cup of Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce (similar to an alfredo sauce made by Ragu) and it really added to the flavor.  For those of you who really like this sauce try the Exquisite Pizza Sauce by Angie Zayac on this site...it's absolutely delicious!!

Doubled recipe.  Turned out beautifully. Used 2 28oz. can of diced tomatoes, 4 cloves of garlic, 2T dried parsley, 1t dried oregano, 1t Italian seasoning, replaced wine with 1 cup chicken stock. Didn't need brown sugar. Sauteed onion first, added rest of ingredients, pureed a bit with hand blender, simmered for about an hour to reduce it slightly. Lovely and smooth tasting.

If taste is too sharp I will add a knob or two of butter to knock down the acidity.

This really was a great basic recipe. I gave it 4 stars only because you have to make adjustments to make it great. I sauteed 4 garlic cloves, 1 C. onion, and ground turkey in oil and then added the pureed (28 oz) canned tomatoes, paste and 1 extra small can tomato sauce. I also added 1 tsp. basil, 1 tsp. sugar and 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes to the tomato mixture to kick it up a bit.
With these few changes it was really a wonderful sauce. No need to use jarred sauce again!

This is awesome!  I have been looking for a "tastes like it's been simmering all day" marinara sauce for so long, and this is as close as it gets.  I didn't have any white wine, but I did have a good bottle of red opened so I used that instead.  I added it to the olive oil & onion mixture and let it reduce prior to adding the tomato ingredients.  I also saw that there wasn't any basil in the recipe, so I added a tsp. The sauce is still simmering, but even after just a few minutes on the stove it is fantastic. Thank you so much Jackie for this recipe!

This IS the perfect marinara sauce.  I used petite diced tomatoes instead of the stewed, decreased the olive oil to 2 T. and added 1 T. of brown sugar.  I blended this with an immersion blender because I hate cleaning my regular blender and it worked just fine.  I simmered with cooked Meatball Nirvana meatballs for 1.5 hours and served over hot capellini.  I ended up freezing some of this for a quick weekday meal also.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was really good for the amount of work it took (hardly any at all). I used diced tomatoes because that's what I had, and let it simmer longer. This recipe didn't really make that much sauce - I had just enough to cover 16 meatballs and have them be nice and saucy, but wouldn't have had enough if I wanted to make spaghetti to go along with it. If you want extra to freeze for another time, double the recipe!

Fantastic marinara sauce!  very flavorful.....I used my crock pot & let it cook for a long time.  I used fresh tomatoes and didn't have a thick tomato paste, so I had to reduce the liquid quite a bit.

This is a very good base sauce. I have to add extra spices to get what I want from it, but I feel like this is a great starting point. The texture is fantastic and it's a very simple recipe. A tip on wine: use something you like to drink, as the flavor will be somewhat present in the sauce. It isn't overpowering, but it's there. If you don't like wine, I suggest something light and sweet, as it may be a little more subtle than a dry wine.

This is the best marinara sauce and its quick and easy.  I did put in 4 cloves of garlic and fresh basil too.  The flavour was phenominal, my 16 y/o son and wife loved it.  I sprinkled granulated garlic over boneless chicken breasts, grilled it for 5 mins. each side, sliced it in strips and put on top of whole wheat Penne.  Then added the marinara sauce and lightly tossed to cover everything with the sauce.  To die for....will use over and over again!

This is the perfect marinara sauce. I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this until now. I make this in triple batches with no tweaking. This is without a doubt better the day after making and I freeze the extra sauce. The wine I use is Woodbridge Sweet White by Robert Mondavi . The Sweet White helps to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.

WONDERFUL SAUCE! I couldn't believe how good it tasted - much, much better than jarred stuff. I used Italian flavored stewed tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes, and red wine instead of white (I always a glug or two of red wine to my red sauces) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. I'll make this one for years to come!

Super quick, easy and delicious! You could also use crushed tomatoes and skip the food processor. I use this recipe for simple pasta dishes like spaghetti or in lasagna. This recipe is great as is, but is also very versatile so add whatever you want to it! The sauce is really good with lot's of veggies added to it. The one change I would recommend is adding a teaspoon of brown sugar to reduce tartness.

Great, basic sauce, very quick and simple to put together.  It takes as much effort to make a little as to make a lot, so make a lot and freeze what you don't use straight away.  The only modifications I've made to this recipe is using more garlic (partly because there's never too much garlic, and partly because authentic marinara sauce uses lots), and omitting the tomato paste.  Tomato paste is only for long-simmered, sturdy winter sauces, and without it, this sauce is light and lively, which is how I like my sauce most of the time.

My wife says it tastes better than the store brands.  Costco has #10 cans of peeled tomatoes for $2.69.  That's 6 and a half pounds.  I just made another 8 containers of 16 oz each for the freezer.  They will be gone in a month or less.  This sauce I make "plain" and jazz it up to suit what I am fixing.  Really a good recipe, really good flavor and really easy to change and adapt.  Try it!  You will like it!

Absolutely one of the tastiest and easiest marinara recipes that I have found.  My two boys(6 and 2) will only eat "mommies yummy sauce".  I saute the garlic and onion first, and then add it to the food processor and process it with the tomato mixture so it is all the same consistency.  I also add about 1TBSP of brown sugar to take the acidity of the tomatoes away.  Great Recipe, never would have thought of using stewed tomatoes before this.

This was excellent sauce.  I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes and a teaspoon of sugar but followed the rest of the recipe.  I served it with minced fresh basil generously sprinkled over the sauced pasta.  Everyone loved it.  Will make this again.

This sauce is right on the money!!! I was skeptical at first, but I will be saving this recipe for sure!!!

A bit of an oversight on my part, but the 6 tablespoons of olive oil are meant to sautee the onions. Not knowing any better I added them to the sauce, which did not ruin the taste or consistency. 6 tablespoons of olive oil seems excessive to sautee onions, which I accomplished with just ONE tablespoon. For added flavor, sautee the garlic as well.

this is a WINNER.

I've gotten compliments on this EVERY time I've made it. Great flavor, very easy to make. Someone said it's got an "old world taste" -- not that plastic, tasteless, commercial jarred sauce.

Fabulous base recipe. I wish I would have made a double batch! The only thing I did different from the recipe was used canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had. If I had another can of tomato paste handy, I would have definitely done a double batch the first time. **Update - for some reason this sauce made me feel borderline heartburn so I tried a 2nd recipe which was even more flavorful but no heartburn-ish feeling. The only big difference in the recipes was the tomato paste to diced tomatoes (what I used for both versions) ratio.**

This was okay. A little bland and watery. Not much depth of flavor. I'm sure it will be better tomorrow, as all italian food is, so I'm giving it 4* instead of 3*.

Very nice. I didn't have parsley, so substituted dried herbs. It was a bit bitter, so might try again with a tiny bit of sugar in the mix.

Absolutely the best pasta / marinara sauce I've ever had.  I used only 2 T of dried parsley and doubled the garlic to 2 cloves.  I forgot to saute the onion and mistakenly blended with the rest of the ingredients.  I substituted 1/2 c of apple juice and 1 t of fresh squeezed lemon juice for the white wine because I don't drink or buy alcohol (I know about it burning off while cooking).  I let it simmer for 1 hour or so then let it cool and sit overnight.  WOW! What a terrific sauce.  My wife and I ate it over pasta topped with breaded chicken and melted swiss cheese.  Thank you Jackie for this great recipe.

To be fair, I believe you should follow a recipe in order to rate it honestly.  That being said, I must say that I was skeptical about this recipe.  I make homemade sauce all the time, but had never used stewed tomatoes.  This was really good!  The flavors all came together nicely.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with grilled Italian sausage.  It was also very quick and easy.

Wow, wow, wow!  This is my first attempt at making any type of pasta sauce and I will not buy jarred any more!  The only addition I made was the tablespoon of brown sugar as others suggested.  I used a pino grigio wine.  I doubled so I could freeze it for another time and I'm glad I did!  This will be my "go to" sauce recipe from now on.  Thanks!

This was quick, easy and delicious! I have another pasta sauce recipe from this site that I love, however, it is a meat sauce and requires more cooking time. I wanted a meatless sauce to use for chicken parmesan and for the pasta I serve along side. I made some changes based on personal taste and what I had on hand. I used 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (did not have stewed) and italian style tomato paste. 1T dried parsley, 1t dried basil, 2 t dried italian seasoning, 1 T brown sugar to cut the acidity, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 bay leaf, water rather than wine ( did not have any wine) and cut the olive oil in half as 6 T seemed excessive to me. Using the crushed tomatoes eliminated the need for a food processor and worked out fine. I made my sauce the night before, which allowed the spices to really set in. My chicken parmesan was wonderful! I will be using this recipe again for ease of preperation as well as taste. I have grandchildren who love pasta, but prefer a meatless sauce, so this is definitely a keeper. Thanks Jackie...a real winner!

This has become the staple marinara/spaghetti sauce in our household.  Use canned or fresh tomatoes - either work.  We make it with fresh in the summer - and canned in the winter.  We leave out the white wine and the extra salt as there is plenty of sodium in the canned tomatoes.  Freezes well so you can always have some on hand! :)

Quite good. And really only took me five minutes to get the onions and garlic hummin' in the skillet before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I didn't use the full amount of EVOO, just two tbsp. I also took other reviewers suggestions and used a couple tsp. of italian seasoning along with the oregano and a tsp. of brown sugar. I also used no salt tomatoes. Along with Lovestohost's Meatball Nirvana and a few slices of mozzerella cheese, this made a great meatball sandwich. I'd use this sauce again and again. (And let me be honest. I was a little skeptical about the white wine but it was great.)

Excellent recipe basic but flavorful.  I am trying to simplify my cooking and this fit the bill,  Clear fresh flavors,  I did use delmonte stewed tomatoes with Italian seasoning (oregano and basil) so did not add oregano and it tasted great. Also used chicken stock in place of wine as I must avoid alcohol  I look forward to making this this summer when I harvest my Roma tomatoes

This recipe is great!  So easy and way, way better than any jarred sauce.  I made just a couple tiny tweaks.  I added 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes and 2 tsp brown sugar. I did skip the white wine because I didn't have any on hand, and it still turned out awesome.  Great recipe!

This has become my stadard marinara sauce- the flavour is excellent and it is an excellent base to add to (roasted vegetables, grilled Italian sausages, sauteed beef, cream etc.). It is much lighter than many marinara sauces, probably because of the white wine, but the lightness does not compromise any of the flavour.  It's not our Italian grandmother's marinara sauce but is a more modern, fresh and versatile interpretation.

WOW, this was so flavorful!!  I have a standby sauce I use for most pasta recipes BUT this may have to replace it!  My only change was using red wine in place of the white (was out).  I did use FRESH parsley and oregano which really makes this taste so great.  I used this sauce on the "Lasagna Roll Ups" recipe from this site.

Ok seriosuly I don't understand how this recipe got such great reviews. I wanted to make a quick marinara so I tried this. I would have been much better off using jarred sauce. This was barely edible on meatball subs & I can't imagine putting it on pasta. I don't know if it was the stewed tomatoes or the wine, or the combo of the two...but I will deffinately be sticking with my regular marinara that simmers for hours. The extra time is worth it.

Wonderful sauce!  My fiance gave it a 5, which he rarely gives (usually 4 or 4.5).  I had it with meatballs, added a little basil, and didn't have any wine so had to use chicken broth.  Next time I will try the wine.  Thank you for the recipe!

Not impressed with this whatsoever, extremely bland sauce. There is something missing from this maybe because I like more garlic in my italian food. People have modified it and I can see why, I would not do this again. It was a waste of good tomatoes and good wine. I think a load of fresh basil in this would have given it more taste.

30 minutes of cooking isn't enough for a deep, mellow sauce yet is too long for a more "raw" sauce. The tomatoes remain very acidic. I prefer a sauce cooked for several hours. A pinch (tiny!) of baking soda can mellow the acid as well.

The only complaint I have about this recipe is that I didn't make enough.  I noticed that a lot of people complain about acidity, and I just wanted to point out that some white wines are very high in acid.  Taste the wine before using it.  If it does not taste good, don't use it.  I would suggest using a chardonnay, viognier or rhone type wine.  Remember, if you won't drink it, don't cook with it.  (And remember that you get what you pay for.)

It's a keeper.  So easy too.  Just ad a bay leaf or two to cut down on acidity - at least thats what mom claims they do.

Very easy to make. We needed to add just a few more italian spices, but it turned out very well. No food processor, but the blender worked just fine.

This recipe boasts the 'best marinara sauce yet",...  and it has lived up to its name.  I know we always want to boost the flavour by making little changes. Please resist this temptation.  Before making any change, make this recipe as is first.  It is worth the taste.  Later, if you want, make some changes.  According to me no changes are warranted!

We make this sauce all of the time! A great variation of this sauce is to combine all the ingredients for the sauce as per the recipe but instead of putting the sauce on the stove we put the sauce in the crockpot with some meatballs.  We lightly browned the meatball before putting them in the crockpot and cooked everything on high for 4 hours.  It turned out great!!

Quick, easy, and delicious.  I 4X the recipe and freeze it for future use.  I use Italian style stewed tomatoes with basil and garlic.  I also add the garlic in with the onions and saute them together.  I use fresh cracked pepper and I throw in a bay leaf as well.  It rivals any "homemade" sauce.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for as my husband does not like "chunky" tomato sauces. It smells SO GOOD while simmering and tastes SO GOOD. I added some salt and pepper to season to our taste. Have used it on pasta, pizza and as a bread dipping sauce. It does taste better the next day (if there is any left). It keeps for about 2 days in the fridge.

I made this sauce for my wife and kids they ate it up and asked for more.  This just made the have to make again and again list.  We used it to top meatball and as dipping sauce for cheese sticks and bread sticks tasted great with all.  ENJOY!

This was really good. I would recommend leaving some of the onions chunky, and maybe adding some green peppers and mushrooms. Recommended!

Recipe as given is delicious!!! I can't believe I've never thought of blending my sauces in a blender, I like the consistency. I add fresh basil, extra garlic, italian seasoning, and a tablespoon of brown sugar. For a heavier meaty sauce I cooked lean ground beef and sweet Italian sausage with the onions, drained, then poured in the marinara. Served with fresh parmesan on top.

This recipe is awesome!! You will never buy sauce in a jar again. It use to take me all day to make my own sauce and a huge time consuming process. Never again!! Jarred sauce Never Again!!!
My partner is extremely picky and prefers jarred and never again. I make this with all organic ingredients. I use fire roasted crushed tomatoes 3 to 4 cloves of garlic and I also throw in about a quarter of a red pepper. Also I highly recommend using fresh herbs. I throw in fresh oregano, basil, sage, thyme and rosemary. You would not believe how much of a huge difference it makes when you use a generous amount of fresh herbs. I do not always have fresh parsley but the other fresh herbs totally makes up for it plus. So much flavor. I use Niagara white wine, which is extremely sweet, and this just takes this sauce over the top with flavor. Everyone that has tried this has raved about it. And it literally takes 20 minutes to make. Don't waste time, money and flavor buying sauce from a jar. And go organic and your body will thank you.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time as a marinara using 2 cans of crushed tomatoes. I did not use (because I did not have) paste, however, the tomatoes were not watery so the paste wasn't missed as the sauce was nice and thick without it.  I did take the advice of other reviews and added 1 tbsp of brown sugar to cut the bitterness (remember to always taste your tomatoes before adding sugar as sometimes you they are already sweet enough and unless you like a sweet sauce the sugar can make it too much so - also brown sugar does work better than white) and added 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. This was a very tasty sauce. The second time I decided to try this recipe as a meat sauce. I used 4 cans of tomato (2 crushed / 2 puree) and this time I did use paste. I used 1.25 lbs of 80% fat chop meat and browned that right in the pot - because of this, I only sauteed the onion and garlic (4 large cloves as we love garlic) in 2 tbsp of Olive Oil. Once these were sauteed to translucent, I added the chop meat which extracted more (and flavor)and satueed this for a bit before adding my paste. Once that was all incorporated I added the tomatoes, and in place of wine (not having it on hand) the 1c (don't forget I am using 4 cans of tomato)of chicken broth (as suggested by another reviewer). I put this over low heat and after it warmed I added the dry ingredients. This is a flavorful and hearty thick sauce. Great for the lasagna and the jumbo stuffed shells I will be using it for.

Best Marinara Sauce Yet Haiku: "Gee, it was 'the best!' With a boastful name like that, I just had to make!" I followed the recipe, only adding an extra garlic clove along w/ 1 TB sugar, and wow, this was a great sauce! Nice texture to cling to noodles; not too runny, not too thick. I froze half, and actually just thawed and ate that, and found that the frozen sauce was better than the 1st time around batch, so next time, I'll make double to have even more to freeze. Thanks Jackie for a splendicious sauce!

This recipe was wonderful. I had fresh tomatoes and herbs from my garden that I had to use or lose, so I substituted fresh tomatoes for the can of stewed and used all fresh herbs (oregano, basil, rosemary, parsley). At the suggestion of other reviewers, I upped the spices to my family's taste. I recommend starting with this recipe and then tasting as you go - very easy to make adjustments as you go along. 
However, I would DEFINITELY take the advice of others and cut the oil in half. I did not cut the oil and my sauce had too much.

Found this recipe years ago and have used it summers when the homegrown tomatoes are abundant and you're wondering what you're going to do with them all!  Substitute 2lbs fresh tomatoes for the canned tomatoes.  Quarter and simmer 1-1/2 hrs.  Proceed as if using canned tomatoes.

Made this tonight to serve with chicken parmesan - we loved it!  I wanted a chunky sauce, so I used stewed tomatoes but skipped the food processor and instead just broke up the tomatoes with my hands.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I have made this twice. The first time, exactly as written and it was great!
The second time, I only had 1 can of sauce and to make up for the 2nd can, I took a can of diced, fire roasted tomatoes & pureed them. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 2T of dried, only have the can of tomato paste and 1 cup of white wine and it was even better.
I paired it up with homemade meatballs and a green salad.
Both times I added about 3-4 T of brown sugar.
Quick, easy and very forgiving recipe.
Thank you!!!

This is a good basic recipe. I add a touch of sugar to my sauce to tone down the acidity from the tomatoes. I also added more garlic, used red wine instead of white and a touch of garlic salt. Left out the onions because my husband isnt a big fan of them. It was tasty. Next time when I have more time I will add fresh basil, and maybe top it off with meatballs.

I love this basic Marinara Sauce.  The only thing I do differently is I simmer whole garlic cloves in some olive oil until nicely browned.  I then add the simmered garlic to the tomatoes as I blend them.  I love the flavor of nice roasted garlic in my sauce and this sauce is probably the best marinara I ever had.  Fantastic recipe!

This is a really good, easy homemade marinara sauce.  I added fresh basil from my garden and used fresh oregano from my garden instead of dried.  My family loved it!

A very good marinara sauce. This was easy for me to make and came out tasting fresh and delicious! Last night I roasted some roma tomatoes using, "Roasted Roma Tomatoes with Garlic," from this website. I also saved the natural sweet juices from the tomatoes to use in place of the canned stewed tomatoes called for in this recipe. This morning I smashed and crushed the tomatoes with my hands instead of using a blender. In the large skillet I add some olive oil, sauteed finely diced white onions. I added one garlic and let it cook. I then added the all of the tomatoes including its juices to the skillet. I added one (6 ounce) can tomato paste and the white wine with a handful of fresh chopped parsely and a little oregano. I sitrred to combine and let it simmer on low. I seasoned with a pinch of rock salt and some fresh ground black pepper. I also threw in some fresh chopped basil then a smidgen of brown sugar. I let the marinara sauce simmer for a while longer, stirring occasionally, then turned it off to cool. I like the consistency of the sauce, which is not too thick and not too thin. The taste of this homemade marina sauce was wonderful and full of fresh flavor. It was the fresh roasted tomatoes that put it over the top for me along with the fresh herbs and wine. I ended up with about 3 cups of marinara sauce. This recipe was perfect and I had enough sauce to layer in the, "Simple Spinach Lasagna," also from this website. easy and nice recipe, thank you for sharing.

Really good sauce.  I made this just because I  didn't feel like going out to the store to buy a jar of sauce for some eggplant I was making.  It was a snap to make.  I didn't have any tomato paste, so I just cooked the sauce down for about  90 minutes, and the consistency was perfect.  I added about a half teaspoon of brown sugar and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Delicious.

Great stuff.  I used diced tomatoes b/c that is what I had. I used 1 can and then 2 cans of sauce and 1 can tomato paste.  Eyeballed the other ingredients.  Used water with chicken bouillon b/c I'm not a fan of wine.  Added about a tblspn of brown sugar also and omitted the oil except what I sauteed the onion in.. don't think it needs it.

We love this sauce!  The only thing I change is to add another clove or two of garlic.  I usually make a double batch to have plenty to freeze.  I make this in one big pot and then use my immersion blender on it after it has cooked for about 20 minutes.  This is much easier than putting it all in the blender.  The parsley and the wine really give it an excellent flavor.

For a quick sauce this was OK.  It was too light in seasoning for my family's taste.  I make a really great sauce, but it is an all day event.  I think with a lot of doctoring up, this would be easy to put together for a last minute meal.

This was excellent!  I put it over ratatouille.  I did end up using more garlic (because I LOVE garlic), adding a little brown sugar as well as extra salt and some onion powder and garlic powder at the end.  That brought it from very good to perfect!

Yum. Didn't use "stewed" tomatoes but regular peeled and cubed ones. But since someone mentioned it, I looked up a recipe for stewed tomatoes. Seems that the major additions call for green pepper and sugar. So I added 1/2 green pepper finely chopped (sauteed with the onions, though added after they'd cooked for a couple of minutes)  and about 3-4 tsps of sugar. Yum!

This is awesome!  I used two cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed and I left them chunky. I like my marinara sauce with small chunks of tomatoes. I also added a little more garlic and some basil.  It is easy to season this the way you like.  I used this one time on parmesan chicken and another time on homemade meatballs.  I like this so much more than the jar sauces.  I think I will try making up a big batch of this and see how well it freezes.

Delicous and simple to make.  Tastes better than the store bought sauces in jars.  Followed the recipe exactly as stated.

I have made this sauce 2-3 times now and we love it.  No more from the store jar sauce.  Simple ingredients.  I do prefer to let mine simmer for 2-3 hours when I can, but it tastes great either way.  Thanks for the recipe!

This sauce was excellent!  I added some fresh basil, a little brown sugar, mushrooms and hamburger to the sauce and it was a huge hit.  Definitely keeping this recipe for future use!

I made this almost exactly as written...the one exception I made was adding a couple of table spoons of brown sugar to cut through the acidity. Excellent recipe, very easy and quick to throw together!

This is such a great, easy recipe. I no longer buy jarred pasta sauce. The only thing I do differently is add a teaspoon of white sugar. I've made it many times now. I've used it for pasta, as a pizza sauce and as a dipping sauce for calzones. Thanks for the great recipe. Tonight I switched it up and decided to turn this into a tomato cream sauce. Made as directed, added 1/2 cup of cream. It seemed like it was missing something, so I added a good glug of balsamic vinegar to deepen the flavor. Still not quite right so I added some parmesan cheese. Yum. Then stirred in some frozen lima beans and frozen peas. Used it as a sauce for fettucini and served with steamed broccoli. Great healthy vegetarian meal! Thanks so much for the excellent recipe.

Hmmm. While I like this, I feel something is missing.... I've been craving a homey meal for a while, but haven't had much free time to spend in the kitchen lately. 2day was the exception. I decided to go all out - homemade pasta sauce, meatballs & garlic bread (mangia!). Since I made 14 decent sized MB's, I wanted to ensure there was enuf sauce to cover them entirely (I simmered them in this sauce). For that reason, I chose to double everything. I ended up using plain 'ol Dei Fratelli stewed tomatoes, but later when reading Jackie's instructions, I noticed that she referred to Italian seasoned ones (?). I decided to add 2 t Italian seasoning b/c of this. My choice of wine was Pinot Grigio (well, actually my fiance's choice - I sent him to the wine section while I finished the rest of our grocery shopping!). The thing I really don't like about this sauce is how runny it is. It literally slid right off my spaghetti noodles lol, but that could have been my fault (I may have pureed too long...)??? One other note: DO NOT USE 6 (or in my case, 12) T EVOO!!! You absolutely DO NOT need that much oil to saute a small onion!!! I ended up skimming a TON of oil off of my sauce (it reminded me of the horrible Gulf oil spill for lack of a more fitting analogy...). Having said that, I think this would be an easy fix, or as is, a perfect dipping sauce for fried mozza sticks or calzones. I will definitely keep this recipe handy for that! Thanks for sharing, Jackie! :-)

My son made this for the Three Cheese Manicotti II from this website.  He sauted 1 clove garlic with the onion, then crushed another into the sauce when he added the white wine.  This was very good, and is a keeper for all my recipes calling for a marinara.  PS (He used crushed tomatoes, therefore did not have to use the blender...quicker cleanup).

Well, I never had made this recipe before and took a HUGE risk with it.  I made it x 15 in two roasters and served it along with pasta and homemade meatball along with other items for our All Church Night!.....It was a huge success and I had a ton of compliments and people kept asking me for the recipe!!!  Anyhow, I am going to try to can this recipe so I have it at my ready right out of the jar!  Hopefully I can grow some tomatoes and use them in this awesome recipe!

What a GREAT recipe! EASY and delicious. I sauteed the onions in the pot and then added all the ingredients and used my immersion blender....1 pot sauce, no extra cleaning the blender! I added red wine cause that's what I had open and a few fresh mushrooms,Italian seasoning, a TBSP brown sugar and topped it off with freshly chopped basil and lots of parmesean cheese. I see all kinds of possibilities with this recipe. I will never buy Marinara sauce again!

I made this last night, and it was great! The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of white wine. I've tried several different sauce recipes, but haven't found a really good one until now. My husband said this one was the best I've made!

This was a very simple,easy, flavorful sauce. I didn't have the tomato paste and it tasted fine without it. I used petite chopped tomatoes and didn't have to get out the food processor. Will definitely make again!

This sauce was okay but no one really cared for it.  It smelled great and tasted great before the wine was added.  If I make this sauce again I won't be adding the wine.

I loved this super easy and tasty sauce.  I of course made some minor adjustments, they were as follows: Used 2 cans Diced Tomatoes (1 regular, 1 w/basil, oregano & garlic), only used 2 Tbs. olive oil, added a little extra salt, added a little dried basil & some red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper instead of regular black pepper, added 2 garlic cloves and 1 Tb brown sugar. Did not put in the food processor. Simmered for 30 minutes, adjusted seasoning and simmered a few hours more.  I then put about 3/4 of the sauce in the blender, pureed and mixed in with the 1/4 of the chunky sauce.  It really tasted so fresh, was easy easy easy and soooo much better then store bought.  Thanks for a great recipe :-)

This is a really good all purpose sauce. Thick and tangy like you expect from Marinara. I doubled it expecting it would be good (used a commerical size can of tomatos which was only 2.79) used half for a large lasagana and froze the rest. This would stand up to meatballs, pizza or just about any pasta dish. I have a VERY picky daughter and have problems finding sauces she will eat (no chunks) and she loved it. I will do this one again over and over.

Yum-yum.  I threw the tomatoes, tomatoe sauce and parsley in the blender to puree.  After I combined all the ingredients I put in my crock pot on low for about 2 hours until it was time to serve.  Everyone loved the taste -I loved that it could go together easily and was ready to go when it was time to eat.

This was my first time to make a real marinara sauce.  It's perfect for my spaghetti, Ziti and pizza dishes.  I triple the recipe and freeze the rest.  Also, I make it the day before and let it set over night in the refrigerator.  So easy to make!!!  Thanks for sharing.

Thanks for this awesome recipe! No more sauce from a jar!  There are a couple of things that you can do to take this sauce from great to spectacular.  First, double the garlic.  My family is very garlic-phobic, but they love this sauce with the extra cloves.  Add a tsp. of dried basil as well for extra flavor.  Second, add 2 tbsp. of honey AND 1 or two crumbled chicken boullion cubes as the sauce simmers.  It balances the flavors perfectly.

This was very easy, yummy, and tasted quite healthy.  Of course you can make all of your own additions to it, such as sauteed onions, celery, mushrooms, etc, as well as customize your spices.  I like crushed red pepper in my sauces.  I'm a huge fan of Paul Newman's marinara and sauces, so I'd love to try to copy Sockarooni!

I made it with white wine this time, but will do red wine next time, which just seems to make more sense with a red sauce.

I also used fire roasted crushed tomatoes as my local health food store didn't have stewed!?

Mmmmmm, I could eat this everyday. As recommended by one reviewer I added fresh basil (about 4 large leaves),I added a little extra pepper and red pepper flakes for more spice, a couple of tablespoons of sugar, and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I used this marinara for another recipe on this site called "Baked Ziti I". This sauce is smooth and delectable, I think the wine really makes it a winner but I couldn't have imagined not adding the sugar!

This is really good and easy. I love the thickness of it. I like to add meat and mushrooms and crushed red pepper flakes.

Over all, very tasty. This sauce was a little too sweet for me. I personally prefer marinara not sweet tasting. Next time I will use canned plum tomatoes to avoid that (I didn't realize stewed tomatoes had sugar in them).

This was very good. In place of white wine, I used red. Also, I used a pot in place of skillet. I made it come to a boil at first. As it boiled I put in a little bit of baking soda to get rid of the acid.(you can also use sugar in place of baking soda). Then I let it simmer for 2 hrs, stirring occasionally. This is gonna be a keeper.

This is a very yummy recipe. I have used it alot. Instead of white wine l use red. It gives it a richer taste. Great for vegetarians.

I added 1 Tbsp sugar and 12 oz tomato sauce (I like it a little thinner to dip my garlic bread in), simmered for only 15 minutes and the sauce was absolutely perfect!!! I made the tomato chicken parm and some angel hair spaghetti. I am making it again this Friday for some guests. Thanks so much!!

Definitely 5 stars.  I used a blender to process the ingredients to a smooth sauce and I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted 1 teaspoon dried parsley.  Served over fettuccine with grilled shrimp.  Also served over Zucchini Cakes from this site.  Very versatile sauce with a great taste!

This recipe truly is the "best yet"!!  I would say that it is one of the few recipes that deserves 6 stars.  So after making it a number of times, here's what I'd suggest.  First, I would not recommend making it with fresh tomatoes.  You have to add a ton of sugar, and even then it tasted acidic.  I'd rather keep the fresh ones for salads.  Using canned tomatoes tastes much better.  Second, although I like it as a marinara sauce, in my house we prefer it as meat sauce.  So, I usually brown and drain ground beef, then add the blended sauce to the frying pan and let it simmer the 30 minutes.

4 stars, as is, but I made a several requested changes and it was definitely one of the biggest 5 stars ever!  I've found that this is awesome for meatless dishes, but also great if you add some ground beef or turkey.  I recommend reading a few of the other reviews to get some ideas on what to change, because I don't feel that I need to repost what many have already posted!  However, if you don't like cooking with wine (I don't use it), I can tell you that beef broth in place of the wine gives the sauce a nice, rich flavor...it may also cut the bitterness, because I didn't have any complaints about that.  Great recipe!

Fabulous!!! 2 small changes...used 4 cloves of garlic and red wine instead of white. I make huge batches and freeze. I will never use store bought again. It's so versatile, pizza, pasta, dipping sauce..even little triscuit pizza appetizers.

4 stars as written. 5 stars with these hints:  triple the garlic & use large cloves, use only 3 T olive oil, add two bay leaves, and start with the most delicious jarred tomatoes - Del Monte Garden Select Petite Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic & Oregano. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE MARINARA WITH MY CHANGES! We mmm and ooh throughout each bite, every time we make it. Fresh parsley is a must. Double the recipe when you make it!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I did make several changes though.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I dipped them in boiling water, peeled off their skins, and put them in my blender.  I omitted the tomato paste and added extra garlic along with the spices.  Meanwhile, I sauteed a diced green pepper with the onion and then added that to the blender too.  What a fabulous puree!!  While that was simmering, I added 1/2 tsp. of thyme,  a shake of rosemary and a bunch of sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  I omitted the wine, since I didn't have any.  I served it over whole wheat pasta, and it was scrumptious!

Amazing! I HATE wine, so the first time I made the recipe I halved the amount of wine called for. However, I didn't find it strong, so the second time I used the full amount. It was amazing! Definitely use the wine. I've been eating this sauce a couple times a week for the past 3 weeks. It is definitely the best I've ever had. And I'm picky with sauces (I hadn't made pasta at home in forever because I hadn't found a sauce I've liked outside of a restaurant!)

This can also be a good base: I like it as-is, and haven't altered the recipe (except for using less parsley), but my husband has experimented. He's added green peppers and mushrooms to his half of the sauce, or ground beef, or alfredo sauce (or even all of the above, combined) and said that all versions were equally delicious. But I prefer it as-is.

Great stuff it was the only sauce that tastes nice with pasta that has no meat with it. All those pasta sauces in the jars are no comparison to this. Truly it is very tasty. Goes well with any type of pasta. I highly recommend this If you are looking for a good homemade pasta sauce

Mmmmmm!  Not having any Italians in my family, marinara sauce wasn't an easy recipe to come up with.  But, after making this & serving it several times, I've impressed a lot of people!  It's SO flavorful & easy to make, too!  I double it & freeze it.  Still tastes delicious after being frozen.  Thanks!  (Also DELICIOUS w/ St. Louis toasted ravioli from this site)

this was my first attempt at making sauce, although i studied various types and recipes beforehand.  i changed it a bit, on recommendation of other reviews and to suit my own preference.  i added fresh basil (a few leaves chopped), dried rosemary (maybe a tablespoon), and some red pepper flakes (1/2 teaspoon or so) to the mixture before blending.  while simmering i added about a tablespoon of sugar.  i hear baking soda works, too, but i havent had a chance to try it.  oh, i would use more onion next time as well, but i really like onion.  impressive sauce.

This was a very easy and quick sauce to make, it helped that I had everything on hand as well.  It's a basic marinara with a light tangy tast and just the right amount of spices.  For you meat eaters you can add italian sausage to spice it up or for vegetarians like me we can add veggie meat like Gimme Lean to the sauce, but it tasts just as good by itself. A+

Great marinara recipe. I've made it many times now with great success.

For the person who substituted apple juice in place of wine and gave only 3 stars maybe you should look up what an appropriate substitute for wine in tomato sauces would be. I would not suggest apple juice. Better to skip that part than to use juice.

Yes, I would say it's the best! This came together very quickly and with simple ingredients. Instead of stewed tomatoes, I used a large can of crushed tomatoes, so there was no need to process. I sauteed the onion and added 3 cloves of garlic for the last few minutes. Made some other minor changes: 1 tblsp of dried parsley, 1 tsp dried basil, a bay leaf and 2 tblsp of brown sugar. Better than anything you'd find at the grocery store or a fine restaurant! Thanks Jackie for this keeper of a recipe!

The is the best marinara sauce ever! I used canned roasted tomatoes and I added a can of tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar (it cuts down the acidity very well), 2 bay leaves, dried basil, heavy cream (in place of the milk), some crushed red pepper and I was very generous on the salt & black pepper. I used a tasty pinot grigio and used closer to half a cup. This is seriously SO good.  The fresh parsley is a MUST and it's super easy if you have a food processor.  You won't regret trying this recipe!

An essential recipe in my household! It freezes well, so we make a quadruple batch. We throw in maybe 3 or 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1. Sauvignon Blanc is our favorite wine to use - just sweet enough (the wine here is replacing table sugar after all), not woody like chardonnays tend to be, and with a bright crisp citrus-like quality that works really well with the tomatoes. Right now I have a pot on the stove so I can use up a bottle of Chenin Blanc, and that seems to be working well too. This is a much fresher, more acidic taste than you get with prepared tomato sauces on the supermarket shelves, so you really only want to cook it 30 minutes or until the flavors blend. If you want something that tastes more like jarred sauce, I would look for a different recipe that has a 2-3 hour cook time and uses sugar instead of wine... though once you try this recipe, you may never want the other kind again. :)

I've been looking for a marinara sauce recipe that tastes close to my favorite Italian restaurant, and this is it!!!  Yum! I didn't have white wine, so used a little bit of red and it was yummy.  Also added little bit of sugar for some sweetness.  Very easy to make and will definitely make again!! Should have made double!

I had tried Giada's marinara and it was way too acidic, so I came across this recipe and was excited that it had so many great reviews.
During cooking, it did seem a bit acidic to me, so I used a bit of brown sugar. But other than that, I followed the recipe using a dry pinot grigio. I've read that dry white wine is very common in red sauces in Italy and adds a lovely, bright flavor. Be sure to reduce. I used San Marzano whole tomatoes & store brand paste. I hand crushed the tomatoes before whizzing everything in the blender for a bit.
My roomie and I, since we usually use jarred sauce, were honestly confused as to how it was supposed to taste, but we both loved it. It tasted light & fresh, if a bit liquid-y for my preference. Next time I might try chicken broth instead of wine to cut down on cost, add a bit more garlic and reduce longer for a thicker sauce. Great recipe, will use again! *Update* Making it now, used chicken broth, 1T brown sugar, 2t dried parsley, 1T dried Italian herbs - my herbs are always on the aged side and less potent, so I use a bit more. I sauteed the herbs with the onion & garlic for a good 15 minutes to "open" them up a bit and allow all those flavors to emerge. Simmered sauce one hour. Still unbelievably delicious! Don't be afraid to sub broth for the wine. And for the simplicity of the recipe, it smells incredible. So try it as written first, taste as you go along and tweak to your personal preference. Fantastic recipe ~ a keeper, for sure!

We really enjoyed this with Chef John's Italian meatballs and spaghetti. I sauteed the onions in just 2 T olive oil (I didn't think it needed 6) for a couple of mins, added the garlic (3 cloves instead of 1), then added about 1/4 teaspoon crushed chili peppers just for a few seconds. Stirred in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and about 1/2 cup tomato sauce. Used about 1 Tablespoon dried parsley and didn't have white wine so I used dry sherry instead. Simmered for about 40 mins. Everything else I kept as written. Thanks for a great recipe!

I make this in a quadruple batch using 4 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with basil, 1/4 c red, 1/4 c white, & 1/2 c Marsala wines. I sautée the garlic & onions in the oil, whisk in the tomato paste & let cook for a few minutes, then whisk in the wine & again simmer a bit. Then I add the crushed tomatoes & seasonings, including a small handful of brown sugar, maybe 2-3 T.   The texture is perfect & it freezes wonderfully.

Oh WOW. So easy and so delicious!!! I doubled the batch but will triple or quadruple it for freezing next time.  I sautéed the onion in garlic flavored olive oil, used Italian style stewed tomatoes and Italian style tomato paste.  I didn't taste any bitterness but added a tad of sugar just in case. I am going to make Chef John's meatless meatballs tomorrow for a vegetarian friend and put them in her fridge with this lovely sauce so she will have something to eat when she comes home from visiting her family out of state. Thanks so much for sharing this, Jackie!

I've probably tried 100 or more variations of marinara.  I now have a new favorite!  Only helpful comment I can make is to simmer for closer to an hour in order to thicken and bring out all of the wonderful flavors.

I will NEVER go back to bottled marinara sauce!  I used a combination of canned and fresh from my garden tomatoes (frozen from this summers batch)  I didn't have the wine so omitted it and it turned out perfect without it!  It simmered for about 30 minutes and the consistency was perfect!
I am putting it in my daughter's recipe album - a collection of favorite recipes for her to use when she moves into her own place.

So I live in Toronto (Canada) and my husband and I love going to this Italian place in Buffalo called Frank's Sunny Italy. They have an awesome veal parm dish and the sauce is what makes it great. I decided to make "pork parm" on rigatoni noodles and I used this sauce. OMG - it tasted VERY CLOSE to Frank's in Buffalo!! The only thing I did differently was add a tbsp brown sugar. This is going to be my go-to sauce from now on. Thank you so much!!!!!

Love this quick, easy recipe. I usually double the recipe and freeze leftovers for another day. I have made several times with different kinds of wines, even used red once. The flavor of the wine makes a big difference in the taste, so make sure you use a wine you like!

Delicious! I gave it 4 stars only because I had to modify it to get it just right, but otherwise it was great. I added 4 tbsp fresh basil, an extra clove of garlic, and 1 tbsp of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also replaced the stewed tomatoes with a combination of crushed tomatoes and canned tomato sauce (didn't measure, just sort of proportioned it out 2 parts crushed to 1 part sauce), and I reduced the wine by about 25% (just eyeballed it), and added 1 tbsp of brown sugar per some other recommendations... 2 days after I made this, my husband asked me to make more, so I quadrupled the recipe to freeze some also.

I was too lazy to get out my own recipe.  We accidentally bought too many tomatoes, so I pureed them and simmered them down, then added the seasonings as here.  I doubled the garlic and added some basil, and it's great.  If it's too acidic for you, simply add 1 tsp. sugar.  I think it's funny that people change every ingredient and add another half dozen and then say the recipe is great!  (I mean it is, but they are making something totally different!)

Great flavor and my new go-to recipe for spaghetti sauce. I used tomato sauce instead of blending the stewed tomatoes and I added 1 lb ground turkey, 1 lb Italian sausage (browned first), some red bell pepper and mushrooms. Delicious!

Would have given this 5 stars; I always under salt in recipes (unless baking) and did so here but still found it salty. I omitted it next batch and added garden fresh oregano and basil for flavor.  
Fantastic base; I was taste testing with shotglasses nevermind a spoon ....

round three - less salt, a pinch of sugar and blamo this is a 5 star keeper

WOW - I wanted a nice, robust marinara sauce in my collection and found this recipe.  We added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of basil and cut the white wine in half - it is unbelievable how good this recipe is!!

I did this almost exactly as prescribed!

I used 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and 1/4 cup water in place of the white wine. I'm not a huge fan of white wine and hate to open a whole bottle just for this. The vinegar made it just as amazing, I think! (I made it both ways.)

I also sauteed some diced onion, zucchini, mushroom, and green pepper for a spaghetti sauce. I got rave reviews!!

I have used this recipe numerous times and always with great results. I follow the recipe exactly, except I always add 1T brown sugar per another reviewer, to help decrease the "tanginess" from the canned tomatoes. I am finally getting around to writting a review because last night I made baked ziti (another great recipe from this site) and used one jar of sauce that I got free at the store and one serving of this recipe (I ran out of ingredients at home to double this great sauce.) Well the store bought sauce RUINED my dinner!!! It was tastless and disgusting!! Next time I will run to the store and get the ingredients I need to double this sauce or I will find something else for dinner.....Thanks Jackie for this submission.

My absolute favorite go to marinara. Everyone who tries it loves it. I double or triple the ingredients, put them in the slow cooker and cook on low for 6 hours or high for 3-4. I freeze leftovers for the next time we need sauce.

The first day, this was good. The second day, it was much, much better. I used crushed tomatoes, and the texture was just thick enough. Next time I will add another clove of garlic, and perhaps reduce the amount of olive oil.  For my taste, this didn't need any sugar. Maybe it depends on the type of wine you use - mine was an inexpensive Chardonnay.

This was good, but it was great when I cooked the garlic and the onions first.  I also blended only some of the tomatoes and smashed up the others with my hands.  This helped the sauce be a little more chunky instead of a puree all of the way through.  YUM

This was my first attempt at making my own sauce, and it was great. Everything tasted so fresh, it really made the spaghetti meal I made much better than it had been with canned stuff. It only takes about 5-10 minutes to make, don't see myself not making this every time.

Quick and perfect! I eyeballed all the quantities because I was in a hurry. Used dried parsley. Sauteed green onions in butter instead of Olive oil since I had some left over from another recipe I wanted to use up. Used a hand immersion blender instead of a food processor and that made it all the easier. Finally, added about 1 TBS of brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers to balance the tartness. Didn't let it simmer the full 3O minutes, only as long as my other recipe was cooking. Still turned out fantastic. A very forgiving recipe and definitely a "Go-To" for a quick red sauce!

Easy to make! Very good! (I did not add salt because I think the canned tomatoes have more than enough.)

LOVE LOVE LOVE!
This sauce is awesome! I make it in large batches and freeze for later use because it's so good. I saute the onions and garlic rather than throwing in food processor in about 1/2 the olive oil listed. Definitely use the stewed tomatoes. I use Moscato wine bc its the only wine I drink and ever have on-hand. I add at least 2 more garlic cloves, too.

Delicious! I followed the recipe for the most part except I didn't have fresh parsley and added the following dried spices: parsley, thyme, oregano, basil. I happen to like that combo. I also used extra garlic, as suggested by a fellow garlic lover. For the wine I used Pinot Grigio by Barefoot. It was super cheap and is pretty tasty (and I'm a fan of red wine, myself). I will definitely be saving this recipe and using it in the future! It was super easy! If you're using a MINI food processor, please do half of a batch at a time... I learned this the hard way... Oops!

This sauce is absolutely amazing! The kids devoured every morsel of their pasta. I halved the recipe for the kids and I (hubby is away on business), with the exception that I only used 1 tsp of tomato paste instead of the whole can (I didn't want the sauce to be so acidic). I was a little skeptical about using parsley in the sauce, because I always use basil, but it tasted wonderful in the sauce and the taste wasn't overpowering. I also thought that 6 tbsp (but I used 3 for 1/2 the recipe) of olive oil seemed a lot, but when the sauce was cooked, their was no oil 'swimming' at the top. It blended perfectly into the sauce. The other thing worth mentioning, is that you can save yourself some time from mincing the garlic, since it will be pureed. I ended up using a hand held immersion blender (see video that Allrecipes put together) and it made it easier to puree and the cleanup afterwards was also a breeze. I will definitely make this again. Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jackie! Will definitely be making again for a quick weeknight dinner. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I didn't  add the wine to the sauce and it still tasted delicious!

This sauce recipe is outstanding.  We used another recipe from Allrecipes for meatballs and combined the meatballs with this sauce and angel hair pasta.  It was a fantastic dinner.  The sauce is not too sweet and not too bitter.  You can taste just a hint of the wine.  This will be our go to marinara sauce from now on.

This was a good base recipe but it needed more garlic and spices. I also added a tablespoon of sugar to cut through the bitterness of the wine.

Great sauce. The only thing I would change is to simmer for much longer than 30 minutes, and maybe add some crushed red pepper. Thanks for sharing.

If I could give this an extra star I would. Best sauce I've made yet. I change nothing. Honestly, the stewed tomatoes make it. Crushed does not have the richness and flavor of stewed. It's taste like some other sauce so PLEASE, honor this delicious, simple, recipe and use the stewed. I've made this three times in the past two months. I love it, I love it, I love it! Thank you so much. This is my go to now instead of the jar.

This is so easy, everyone should try it at least once!!

One piece of advice, buy good quality canned tomatoes! I made the mistake of buying store brand tomatoes the first time I made this, let me tell you, such a difference in taste and quality when comparing the two!

I'm not a big fan of cooking with wine (ok fine, I just never have before, jeez!) so I omitted that from the recipe. 

I made this following the recipe (but without wine) and it came out great. The second time I made this I used the following:

2cans Stewed Tomatoes 
1can Tomato Paste
1tbsp Dried Parsley
1tsp Dried Oregano
1/3c Diced Onion
4 Cloves Garlic
I also melted a bullion cube in a cup boiling water (can use chicken broth/stock instead) and added it until I got the consistency I wanted.

Everyone loved the sauce and it is now a staple in my home! Goodbye jarred sauce, I have wasted my money on you long enough!

This is my first time making sauce from scratch (I'm wary of all the store-bought marinara sauces because of the amount of preservatives in them) and I'm so happy with the results! I substituted champagne for white wine since that's all I had in the pantry, and I reduced the salt to my taste. It's perfect!

This is such a great and forgiving recipe b/c it still comes out amazing even if you don't follow it 100%. I modified it based on what I had at home. I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed and used 3 gloves of garlic. I didn't have fresh parsley so added about 1 tsp of italian seasoning and then more dried oregano, basil and thyme. I also don't use wine so just replaced it w/ water. Was a bit acidic so added at least one Tbsp brown sugar  as others suggested and toward the end, I added some shredded parmesan and mozarella. Whole thing took about 45 min and YES, it does get better the next day. My brother said it was the best pasta sauce he'd ever had. Definitely not using store bought anymore. Thank you Jackie!

This was a wonderful sauce. I did add additional garlic and used fresh herbs. Per other reviewer's added a touch of brown sugar. My whole family loved, loved, loved it! Thanks Jackie for a great marinara.

Great sauce. I used tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes (that's what I had on hand) and dried parsley instead of fresh. I had my reservations about using the wine, but I'm glad that I did.

I did not like this marinara sauce. I was very excited to try because of so many wonderful reviews. I followed the recipe to a T until I had to try everything to fix it. The 1/2 cup of wine was too much and it would not cook off. It definitely needed some more herbs, maybe try basil and a bay leaf if I ever decide to make it again. I also added about 2 T of brown sugar and that did work at reducing the acidity.

An ok sauce. Nothing special and a little too salty.

Wow! Making it now... just took a little taste while it's simmering. Best sauce I've ever tasted, or is it gravy? Whatever you call it, this recipe is perfection!

This sauce was very good, but it was very acidic once it was finished so I ended up needing to add a little sugar and I thought it definitely needed more garlic.  However, this sauce is a great base and I can't wait to use it again, but make my own changes for my family's tastes.

Somewhat pleasing but not remarkable or particularly satisfying.  I didn't bother to keep it in my recipe book but I can't quite say what it was that left me wanting.  Consistency is nice, and it's easy to prepare.

A little too much wine for me.  I cut it in half and it was the best marinara I have ever eaten.  I usually don't like marinara but this one is great.  Next time I will tweek it with a little basil.  Basil seems to make anything Italian better.  Overall, a great sauce.

This was super easy and tasted nice but it was too tomato-paste-y for me.  Next time, I'll omit the paste completely.

My 5 yr old said the sauce tasted like ice cream, licked the bowl clean, and asked for more. WOW!!!!

Very easy to put together. I followed others' suggestions and made a few changes:
-Used canned crushed tomatoes
-Sub'd dried parsley
-2 cloves garlic
-1/4 cup white wine (I used chardonnay)
-Added 1 Tbsp brown sugar

Thanks for the wonderful recipe. A definite keeper!!!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  It was the best marinara sauce I have ever tried.  Great flavor and texture.  My husband loved this!  The only thing I changed was to add 1 tsp dry basil.  Thank you!!!!

This is delicious!  I made a slightly healthier version by using 'no salt added' tomatoes and paste, then added just a little sea salt.  Really lets the flavors of the herbs come through.  So easy to make -- dinner was one the table in 30 minutes.  How cool is that??

I'm always looking for a good sauce recipe and this is it.  I was making raviloi and didn't want to have meat in my sauce.  This was quick and easy.  I did add an extra clove of garlic and alittle basil not realizing it wasn't called for.  Excellent and I will put this on my keeper list!

Excellent sauce.  I made the following modifications:  1) increased the garlic to 2 cloves, 2) increased the onion to 1/2 C, 3) omitted the salt since the canned tomato was already salty, and 4) reduced the olive oil to 3 T.

Super! Made 100% like recipe. Freezes well. I like to put sauces like this in freezer bags, let all the air out, then freeze flat. Easy  and short time to thaw. I used this on the Eggplant Parmesan recipe by Doery instead of the storebought stuff. very yummy!

This was a wonderful sauce and only took a few seconds, I misread the directions and just dumped everything directly into the blender so I simmered it for a bit longer and it was still great!!)

My family really enjoyed this. My husband ranted about how flavorful the sacue was. It was super easy and inexpensive to make. I made exactly with the exception for the suggestion for a tablespoon of brown sugar. Trying to eat healthier so served over whole wheat pasta with steamed turkey italian sausages. Very tasty. This is a great weeknight meal when you are busy! Thanks so much!

The title ofor this recipe does not make it justice.  I am extremely persnickity about tomato sauces in pasta (tobe honest I almost don't like them) but since I've found this recipe all pasta dishes that have tomato sauce (including pizza) have this sauce in my house.   One thing is it IS rather acidic so I added to the recipe 1 tbsp of brown sugar while simmering & it resolved that problem.

This was quite a good sauce.  I didn't measure the spices - just threw them in.  Also added mushrooms.  If you let it cook per the directions the parsley won't be so overpowering.

I enjoyed this sauce and will be making it again. I used italian seasoned stewed tomatoes. I also added two additional cloves of garlic. Great flavor and simple to make.

Delicious!  I love a smooth marinara sauce that is thick enough to cling to the pasta.   Here is what I did: I added fresh oregano and basil to the food processor.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil before adding them to the processor.  I bumped up the garlic to 3 cloves and added just a shake of crushed red pepper.  I made a meat sauce out of this, and it's out of this world!  I will use this recipe from now on when I want a good sauce.

I like how simple and easy this recipe is but, like other reviewers, find it a bit too acidic.  I even let it sit overnight to see if it mellowed any and it didn't.  Not sure that I'll make it again.

I love this sauce! This is the only marinara sauce I use now and I freeze extra for later. I make a few small changes. I use 2 cans of Hunts chopped tomatoes and not stewed, because that is what I buy in bulk, sub. 4tsp dried parsley for 4 Tblsp. of fresh, and I don't use any black pepper, as I don't care for it. The sauce tastes very good before even adding it to the onions and oil. The wine, garlic, and tomato combination is wonderful! I also use a hand emulsier blender instead of a food processor, which is much quicker and a lot less clean-up (a must have in the kitchen). I have been looking for some time for a fresh tasting & quick marinara sauce, and one that is not spicy, thick, and sweet like a lot of recipes out there, especially the jarred sauces. This tastes very authentic, and great in any recipe calling for marinara or spaghetti sauce. Thank you so much submitter!

Very delicious! We wanted to make spaghetti for dinner and we had no marinara sauce, this recipe I found went the best with what ingredients I had. I changed around some things..  Instead of 2 14.5oz cans of stewed tomatos, I used 1 28oz can of diced tomatos, and I used 1 8oz can of tomato sauce instead of the 6oz. It's all I had in the pantry.  I didn't have any garlic cloves so I used 2 tbsp of Fresh Finds chopped dried garlic.  Used 1 1/2 tsp of oregano, instead of iodized salt I used sea salt. And instead of olive oil for the onions I used vegetable oil, I used 4 tbsp, definitley could've used less.. maybe 2-3?  And for my wine I used Fair Banks California White Port.. And I used a little under 1/2 Cup.  Everyone one loved it! Definitely the BEST yet.  Oh and it for sure needs 1 tbsp of brown sugar.. I tasted it without the sugar and I could feel the tart on my tongue..

Tried this tonight and it was a hit.  The stewed tomatoes are what makes this sauce different than the norm.  I have a terrible time getting my 16 month old to eat her veggies and I thought that the method of pureeing used in this recipe would be a great way to sneak in some veggies without her knowing it...and it worked!  First, I doubled the recipe.  I sauteed half a yellow bell pepper, a couple handfuls of baby spinach, and 4 oz. of fresh mushrooms (all coarsely chopped) along with the onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  Once tender, I blended the veggies with the remaining ingredients.  Instead of doubling the oregano, I used 1 t. of dried oregano and 1 t. of italian herb seasoning (remember - I doubled the recipe).  Following the recommendation of another reviewer, I added 2 T. of brown sugar.  The result was perfect - it wasn't sweet, but the addition balanced out the acidity.  I served over whole wheat spaghetti with my homemade meatballs.  This sauce would be absolutely perfect with sausage, onions & peppers on a hoagie with melted provolone cheese.  It would be fantastic with a trio of meatballs, spicy italian sausage and thick cut pepperoni over pasta.  Thanks for this recipe...I am ecstatic that my daughter ate some veggies tonight and I love that it's so versatile.  I'll be using it for many different things.  P.S. I cut way back on the olive oil...used just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.

I've been making this sauce for years now.  We love it.  However, I've made a few changes.  I add an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, 2 cloves of garlic, I cut the pepper in half to 1/4 tsp. but add 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper and I only use 3 Tbsp olive oil.  Lastly, I add 1 heaping tsp. sugar.  This is definitely a keeper.

Very easy! Nice tangy sauce! I also eliminated the food processor, used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and combined all ingredients in the pan.  Added a few red pepper flakes.  Yum!

will never buy another  jar of pasta again.  definitely use fresh parsley--it gave it such a great  earthy taste.  also don't like too strong of a garlic taste so I minced and sauteed it with the onions.

This sauce is so good!  I love how simple it is to make.  I added some extra garlic and hot pepper flakes to help add to the flavor, but the consistency is on point and it ages really well!

It is the best marinara yet. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden, and because of this I added more sugar to taste. Do not simmer too long, as you will only cook out the flavor!

This is a wonderful, easy, basic Marinara Sauce! It was flavorful and the choice of spices and herbs complimented the sauce nicely. It was easy and fairly quick. I used it for a pasta bake and it really made a difference. If you're looking for an easy and tasty pasta sauce, look no further.

Not bad, but not the best I've had by far. Cut the oil in half, at least; I ended up removing oil slicks off the top with a spoon as it cooked.

Good Marinara sauce. But i added 2 cloves of garlic, 1 stalk of celery & saute the onions, garlic & celery with olive oil in pot first to bring out the flavors. I also added sugar, bay leaves & Italian Seasoning after the tomatoes. And i substituted red wine instead of white (U usually use red wine for red sauce). Cooked it for an hour. It turned out great!

This is now the sauce that I will be making permanently.  I did not have any stewed tomatoes - only diced...so I boiled the 2 cans of diced tomatoes with a tsp of sugar.  I used a tablespoon of dried parsley (I rarely have fresh)  I used chicken broth instead of wine (I don't cook with wine)  I also added the sauteed onions, oil and chicken broth to the food processor after cooking, to puree the onions with the sauce. (Son doesn't like anything noticeable in his sauce) Then added back to the saucepan. Left on the stove for several hours and the flavors just keep getting better. Awesome recipe!!

Great Recipe!!!!  On the first go around I substituted White Grape Juice in place of wine and it was a hit.  This time I am using white wine vinegar instead to add a little edge . . . will let you know how it goes.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Added note: I was out of white grape juice and fresh oregano.  Substituted equal part chicken stock and 1 teaspoon of dried oregano versus the 1 tablespoon of fresh.  This recipe is full proof!!!!  Excellent result again.

This recipe was fantastic!  I've never made pasta sauce before, but it was really easy.  I only used a 1/4 cup of wine (honestly, you could probably skip the wine completely if you wanted), and I added 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 3 tsp Italian seasoning in addition to the other seasonings.  It turned out fantastic, with a bit of a kick to it from the red pepper flakes.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Instead of the stewed tomatoes and tomato paste I used a big can of crushed tomatoes-it's what I had.  Other than that, I did everything else exactly the same. It just wasn't what I was looking for.  It had a "fake" taste to it and I just can't figure out why. I'll keep searching for one I like.

I've made this so many times, each time I use a different wine and love how it changes the flavor.  I do have to say that switching to red wine instead of white is the way to go.

This sauce was fantastic and freezes well!  I added a little bit of fresh basil and a touch of brown sugar, but wouldn't change anything else.  I tried it with red wine and it was not so good.

Great flavour and texture! I read the reviews and made the following changes: 1. I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar 2. I didn't have any white wine on hand so I used chicken stock 3. I added and extra clove of garlic 4. I used half the amount of olive oil to saute the onions. Since everything was going into the food processor, I didn't bother mincing the garlic or chopping the parsley. Finally, I used a half recipe of Italian Stewed Tomatoes (from this site) instead of canned tomates. Very yummy!

I must agree with the person who said this was bland.  I had to add lots of sugar, lots of italian seasoning, garlic powder, more salt and more pepper.

very yummy! I added fresh basil since I have it growing and some brown sugar as I do to any tomato sauces and I actually used RED WINE instead of white because red is all I ever have on hand. I think I put more onion than the recipe calls for and minced garlic too. (I didnt have parsley so that was skipped as well) 

It was so good, I cant wait to make this again. The left overs were even great spooned over toast and eaten up with a knife and fork! The flavours go through even more the next day. I can't tell you how good this is... I hope someone reading this tries it!!

This sauce is easy and so great. My mother would spend all day making sauce when I was growing up and I never thought I could be satisfied by anything this quick and convenient.  I've used both white and red wine and although I prefer white, it doesn't make much difference.  The only thing that I think can really be altered is the amount of oil, as others have said. All you need is just enough  to cook the onion, maybe 2 or 3 tbsp at most. I also add a little brown sugar and double or triple the garlic, but these are just preferences.  The recipe is great as is!  I use it with Angela's Easy  Breaded Chicken for a great, light chicken parm.

I doubled this recipe and I didn't realize until I started cooking that I only had 2 cans of stewed tomatoes. I added a can of diced tomatoes and I threw a fresh jersey tomato in the processer and added it. I followed the rest of the recipe except I simmered it about an hour because of the fresh tomato that I added. omg this is the best sauce I have ever had. My family said that they only want this sauce for now on!!! Next time I will try with just the stewed tomatoes as the recipe states and see if it tastes any different.

I substituted four fresh roma tomatoes instead of two cans of stewed tomatoes. I boiled the fresh roma tomatoes in kosher salted water for five minutes before peeling the skins. In a seperate skillet, I fryed Tofurky's Italian sausage with a little garlic salt and coarse ground black pepper until brown. I added this to the marinara pot and then served over angel hair pasta.

A really good, basic sauce. All my friends liked it a lot, but I did make the following changes:

Use:
4 cloves garlic, and saute them first
only 2 Tbs. olive oil
chicken broth if you don't have wine

Add:
dried basil
red pepper flakes
1 tsp. brown sugar

cook for one hour total

It definately would have been too acidic without the sugar, so add that if nothing else!

Squisito!!! Really good as is but I played with it this time and I had to tweek and also put my foot in it as always.  I used paper carton boxed crushed tomatoes (1) and sauce (1) and one can italian style diced tomatoes (au revoir cans and your tinny taste and your unhealthy extra soduim). No paste. These boxed toms taste fresher and greatly reduce sodium content.  I used 2 t. oregano and basil and 1 t. majoram, skipped the salt and added 1 T. sugar and  1 t. red pepper flakes. Probably half a head of minced garlic and one med red onion.   I only blended one cup of the sauce  with the parsley so I had a slightly chunky sauce. Also skipped the wine right into my glass ;).  I guess I ended up with a more traditional red sauce than a marinara  this go round. Try this trick....slightly undercook your pasta, one minute shy of al dente,  then add it to the sauce and cover.  The pasta finishes cooking in the hot sauce and  really takes on the flavor of the sauce.  Oh, yeah, I added the other half of the garlic into my pasta water.  Delish.

This sauce is delicious and just the right consistency. I sauteed fresh peppers, finely chopped, (the last from our garden!)  along with the onions. I chopped fresh basil and added it to the food processor for extra flavor.   I also used red wine rather than white because that is what I always use in tomato based sauces.  I served the sauce over pesto filled gnocchi.  What a wonderful meal!

This sauce is reminiscent of our time spent in Italy…ah! I used 4 cups fresh tomatoes instead of the canned (didn’t peel or seed, just cored), doubled the garlic and added 1 tsp of brown sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes. I’ve canned over 50 quarts of this so far!!! Thanx Jackie. * I make so much of this sauce that I bought a food mill, just wash the tomatoes and throw 'em in = instant tomato sauce, no peels or seeds to worry about. Still wonderful!

Fantastic recipe!  I make this quite often and have made only one consistent change....I always add fresh basil.  It adds so much more.  I sometimes add more garlic or substitute chicken broth (as someone suggested) when I don't have any white wine.  All in all this is just a great sauce and very flexible.  The only one my whole family loves!  thank you!

Absolutely LOVED it!!!  I made it on a Monday and let it sit in the frig until Wednesday when we had it with pasta.  It was devine.  We tried different types of pasta with the leftover sauce.  The sauce froze well and is great for a quick meal.  We even put it in individual containers to grab for a light snack or for a couple of people.  Definitely a keeper!

I loved it.  I also like to add 2 T of simple syrup (to cut the acid) and 2 T of balsamic vinegar to add a little more depth of flavor.  For additional taste and vitamins, I add a small can of carrots (drained) when blending up the tomatos.  Excellent!

I'll probably never buy canned sauce again after how good and easy this was.  All I did extra was put in some minced garlic, and some garlic salt at the end (just to taste) and it is divine!  It just tastes so fresh!

I made this tonight and it was awesome! I took some of the suggestions from other reviewers like adding red pepper flakes, brown sugar, fresh basil, and a bay leaf. Also, I wanted to use fresh tomatoes as I have a bumper crop from my garden, so I used that instead of the canned tomatoes. Finally, I sautéed some mushrooms and added them. For the wine I used a nice Cabernet. Delicious! I don't know how much my changes affected the original recipe, but I will be making this over and over again! My husband (my culinary critic) was totally wowed. Hope you guys have as good luck with this recipe as I did!

I made this last night  with some ravioli for my husband and he said it was the best thing he has ever tasted! Changes I made: used crushed tomates, 4 garlic cloves, no parsley, fresh oregano and basil, 1 T sugar, I also added 4 kalamata olives and 4 green olives and pulsed that all in the food processor. That in itself was good but if you like creamier sauces I would suggest adding 1/2 cup part skim ricotta cheese to it - that's what I did and it was amazing!

This is the best marinara recipe I have found yet. My favorite restaruant in Cincinnati has a marinara sauce that no other sauce can be compared to. It also is hard to copy. This is getting me closer though. I left half a can of tomatoes until I combined everything and then added them to the sauce with the wine. I like it better that way.

Something this delicious shouldn't be so ridiculously easy.  This sauce is light, yet has a lot of flavor.  It's perfect as is, but is a great starter sauce if you want to add meat or whatever.  I never cared for the heavy, pasty sauces at the grocery store and now that I've found this, I hope to never have to buy the jar stuff again!

This sauce is AMAZING!!! We love garlic, so I made it with a head of roasted garlic instead of the plain garlic.(Place a head of garlic in foil, drizzle w/ a tsp of olive oil, salt and pepper, wrap and bake @ 400 F for 30 min). It's fantastic this way if ur a garlic lover!

This was DELICIOUS! I added about 3 more cloves of garlic than called for and I minced and sauteed them in a little olive oil in a hot pan before putting it in the food processor....cooking garlic really brings out the flavor.

The first time I made this I messed up (as usual) and added my onions to the ingredients in the food processor.  The second time, I did it just as the recipe says.  Both times it was DELICIOUS! But amazingly, I liked it better when I added the onion to the food processor.  Go figure.  And don't leave out the wine--it adds incredible depth.  I added extra garlic both times.  Both times I had to stop myself from eating it like soup from my spoon :-).  Gonna make pizza and I had to search this site until I found this sauce again--don't worry, I've added to my recipe box!

I cooked up some sausage with onion and garlic then added all the ingredients (added Italian Seasoning v. just oregano and used Italian-style stewed tomatoes). Did not add the olive oil (why so much?) - did not run thru the food processor either (too busy or too lazy...hmmm)- simmered and then set on the stove during baseball practice and wahlaaa - came out great - my husband loved it! Also added fresh basil and served over penne. Thanks! Easy!!

This is a great recipe! I made a few changes, which is why I'm only giving it four stars. First, I only use 3-4 TBSP of olive oil, six makes the sauce a little too oily. I also add red pepper flakes to make the sauce a little spicier (I don't measure this, I just throw them in) and around 1 TSP of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. As for the wine, I throw in 1/2 cup of whatever I have open; I've found that my favorite to use is Cabernet Sauvignon (but maybe because that's my favorite to drink). This can also turn into a fabulous bolognese simply by adding 1 lb of browned ground beef and doubling the recipe. This is truly a great sauce that I make at least twice a month. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST YET! I added some basil and cut back on the parsley. Also added some sugar cause it was alittle tart and some extra tomoatoes (not stewed, just crushed). I hand mashed the stewed tomatoes and really broke up the pieces.  Served it with Campanelle, and was heaped with praise. Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe.  I've always wanted to make my own spagetti sauce but always assumed it would be too  much trouble.  Recently I've been buying organic spagetti sauce and I love it, but this was even better!  I made the marinara to accompany another recipe from this site, baked ziti, and my son could not get enough.  The only alteration to ingredients I used was a little brown sugar added to the sauce during simmer time.  I also simmered for a bit longer and it turned out so yummy!  I'm sure I won't go back to store-bought marinara with this recipe in my book!  Thanks Jackie, for a wonderful sauce!

Excellent sauce!  Like others, I did alter slightly.  Used 2 cans of petite-cut tomatoes, 1/2 tsp basil, no salt, 1/4 cup wine, and 1/2 tsp sugar.  I also tripled the garlic, used 3/4 cup onion, and 8 oz. mushrooms. I will never purchase pasta sauce again.  Thank you for an outstanding recipe!

I tried this recipe last night for a dinner party and it was the BEST sauce I've ever had.  I'll never have sauce from a jar again!  I doubled the recipe and put what was left in the freezer.  I added more garlic and onions because I love them so much and I only used about a 1/4 cup of wine.  I also decided that it had a little too much "zip" to it and added a little more than a tablespoon of sugar.  I also suggest adding about 3 or 4 tablespoons of basil to the recipe.  Don't forget to SAUTE the onions because I believe it makes a difference!  Let it simmer for about an hour and I guarantee you'll love it and will never go back to the store for another jar of anything else!

Excellent marinara.  And don't you believe it----the wine doesn't make the sauce "sour".  Think the last reviewer doesn't like the acidity of tomatoes.  So add 1/4 teaspoon of sugar already!  This is a terrific red gravy---and so quick and easy.  I added another clove of garlic because we love the stuff; other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Great!

very good. I added one portabella mushroom, 8 oz sliced button mushrooms, more minced garlic, 1/2 c sliced kalamata olives and 4 pieces cooked, crumbled bacon. My husband and I like our marinaras a little salty (I save the sweet stuff for dessert)and this was great. Eating the stuff from the jar will be very difficult now! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent.  I omitted wine, as I didn't have any - used water instead. Added 1 teas. basil, 3 cloves garlic and more salt, more onion, minced and some black pepper.  Prepared in the moring, refrigerated and served in evening.  Thanks for submitting.

My family and I really enjoyed this sauce.  We like marinara sauce on the chunkier side, so I used a can of crushed tomatoes and didn't bother running the ingredients through a food processor.  My only complaint was that a 1/2 cup of white wine made the sauce a little too tangy.  It may have been the wine I used (sauvignon blanc), but I felt the need to dilute the tanginess a bit by adding some plain tomato sauce.  Next time I'll use 1/3 cup of white wine and all should be fine.

This has to be the best marinara i have tried as of yet. A lot of marinara's are heavy and don't taste that good to me (taste more store bought sauces) and have to much seasoning in them. This was perfect. Only change i woudl probably add more garlic..not because i don't think 1 clove is sufficient but because im a garlic lover :)

My only change to this recipe was that I sauteed the onions, then added them with the rest of the ingredients in the food processor.

I've tried a number of other marinara recipes since I tried this one. This one is the best!

An easy and delicious sauce.  My toddler and my picky husband both loved it.  I took a chance and doubled the recipe and I am so glad I did!  We enjoyed with The Best Meatball recipe (on allrecipes.com) tonight and have lots leftover in the freezer for future meals.  I will not buy jarred sauce again!

Every time I approach an Italian red sauce recipe, I expect to encounter a lot of work, a lot of ingredients, and a lot of time stirring and simmering. This recipe can be summed up in two simple words: 1)easy, and 2)delicious. Good job, Jackie.

This was so easy and so good! I made this in a lasagna. I used merlot and diced canned tomatoes because that's all I had. I don't have a food processor so I used my blender and it worked great. The only change I might make next time is using less olive oil; I love cooking with olive oil, but 6 tbs is a lot. This recipe is a keeper and would taste great on pizza and so many other Italian dishes. Why use yucky jar sauce when you can make this? Thanks Jackie!

This tasted great, and smelled so good while cooking, and was very very smooth. I made this with the Hearty Vegetable Lasagna, and got great reviews. The only thing I would say about this sauce is that it looks a little bland, since it's so smooth, and if I was using just that over pasta, I would definately add some vegetables. But in lasagna, wow, it was perfect!! =)

We were disappointed that this turned out very bland.  We followed the directions exactly, but were not thrilled with the outcome as other reviewers were.  It has a nice consistency, but there's just not much flavor.

Just by virtue of its simplicity and versatility this is by far the best marinara sauce I have ever made.  I used it first with a low-fat lasagne recipe using ricotta cheese and spinach and was quite impressed.  Tonight I'm making chicken ravioli - and using this sauce!  Whether you choose to doctor it up a bit or not you can't beat this if you're looking for just a basic sauce.  Superb!

Great!  I like to add some basil.  I've found it turns out a little watery if I leave some tomato chunks in the sauce, but its fine if I blend it completely.

Excellent sauce.  Used in eggplant recipe. At first I worried that wine taste was too strong...not good considering I was also serving a Marsala dish. However, after simmering, cooling, reheating later, then simmering some more, the wine melded nicely with the other flavors for a smooth, wonderful sauce. Thanks!

Pretty good sauce, especially after a few days in the fridge.  I made it as is, although I can see why a few suggested adding sugar - it all depends on your taste, however.  While not the very best sauce I've ever had, it's worth making, even if you're short of time - it's pretty quick, which is always nice!

The name says it all!  Really!  It is the best marinara sauce and it's so easy to make.  My mom cooks hers all day and it doesn't compare (sorry mom!)  I think the white wine is what makes this recipe and i add alittle bit more than it calls for.  Delicious and healthy!

I was in a bind and made this in a jiff.  It tasted great and even better the next day!  I didn't use any oil and it came out just fine.  I used canned diced tomatoes, dried garlic and parsley becasuse that's what I had on hand, everthing else as stated.     This is better than most brands of sauce at the store.

I loved this recipe as is!I think it's kind of funny when people post how they loved a recipe, when they completely changed it. I guess that is part of personal style. Anyway, this is a great sauce that is so easy to make! Wonderful!

The sauce is really good, but I find 30 minutes is too long to simmer.  I liked the taste and consistency best at 15 minutes.  Is there a reason I should keep it simmering for the additional 15 minutes?

I was hesitant to make this recipe because it uses the food processor which I had to drag out of the basement.  But it was worth it.  The consistency and flavor of the sauce it is wonderful.  I cut the olive oil and wine in half and still loved it.  Thanks.

great for spaghetti - but nothing else. And one tip - red wine is also really good instead of white wine and  I boiled it a bit and it was best sauce for spaghetti i have ever made!

I made this for an Italian themed dinner/potluck this weekend. Everyone loved it. I made a couple changes based on past reviews.

I used my Vitamix in place of a food processor and it turned out great. Used only 1/4 cup of white wine (some reviews stated 1/2 cup was too much). Added 1 tsp of basil and 1 TBSP of brown sugar (to counteract the tartness of the tomatoes). 

I also added the sautéed onions into the Vitamix with the rest of the ingredients to make sure they were more finely chopped and blended with the sauce. I then added it all back to the same skillet and simmered for about 25 mins.

I really don't like it when a recipe gets a 5 star rating and has a bunch of changes on it.  Sometimes to the point where the recipe is nowhere close to what it was.  I made it exactly as it is stated on the recipe and that it what I am rating.  I loved it so if you want a plain marinara sauce, this is it.  Very easy, quick and tasty. Plain enough where the grandkids would eat it.  I do like to kick things up a notch with mushrooms, green pepper more garlic, spices etc and this is the prefect base to play around with other ideas. But the 5 star is based on the recipe.

This turned out GREAT! My new go-to recipe for quick pasta and meatball dish. 1-I omitted the wine 2-I used Italian stewed tomatoes 3-I threw everything in the pot & with a wireless hand-held immersion blender, blended until I got the consistency I wanted.  YUM!

I was not very precise with my measurements and ended up using red wine, because it is what I had in hand. But this made an excellent sauce for my lasagna. I thought it would separate too much and make the lasagna watery but it really did not. Quite easy and tasty.

I feel like the white wine finishes the sauce and is the missing component I've been looking for when I make my own sauce. I did knock it down to 1/4 cup and used a Pinot Grigio I had in the fridge. I can see how this is easy to tailor based on what's in the pantry and individual taste and I love recipes like that since I'm loosey goose you when I cook.

However, I was out of stewed tomatoes so I used a can of one each, tomato sauce and tomato puree. That was the only change I made. Also simmered with italian sausage which of coarse changes the flavor as well. I rated a four because 3 out of 4 people in my household liked it. The one that didn't brought it down to 4 stars.

This recipe was so easy and absolutely delicious!  Few modifications:  added 5-6 cloves of garlic and sautéed with the onions for the last minute or so; used two large cans (24.5 oz) of peeled tomatoes and only one 6 oz can of paste; added two tablespoons of basil, one tablespoon of brown sugar, and about 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Yummy!!!  Will def be making again!

Very easy to make. I used canned diced tomatoes, as I didn't have "stewed" on hand, and upped the spices a bit. Be sure not to over cook the onions in the beginning, they just need to be sweated, not caramalized. Be sure the wine you use is one you like to drink... If it isn't nice to drink, it won't be nice to eat... Great sauce for pizza, pasta and dipping mozza sticks.

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars vs 5 is because I followed other reviewers suggestions for changes. I added a heaping teaspoon of sugar, doubled the garlic, used 1 can fire roasted tomatoes (delicious ) and added a tsp of dried basil. I also let it simmer with the rind of the Parmesan I used to make parm crisps. the sauce came together quickly and we all really enjoyed this sauce.

Love Love LOVE this recipe. Great consistency, I use it as a base for many things... add meat and it's great also. Make lasagna, dipping sauce, pizza sauce, spaghetti sauce and more with only minor additions. I did use extra garlic powder and a bay leaf (as well as only dried spices, since it's what I had on hand), but otherwise no changes. Canned stewed tomatoes really do make a difference - don't use regular canned tomatoes!

I've made this twice, first time as stated. I love my wine, but not here, I too found it bitter.  I used chicken broth the second time and used strained tomatoes, to lessen the blending (2-21oz jars) and stuck with the 1 tomato paste.  I added Italian seasoning, a pinch of dried red pepper, oregano and basil while I sauteed the onion and garlic: herbs only for a minute to get the heat and marry the flaours.  I only added about 1/8 tsp of sugar.  Now it is the best sauce ever.  Used it in for both Lasagna and Cannelloni. Not a bite left at my dinner party.

I just made this sauce and it is good but I made a few changes like other reviewers.  I doubled the garlic and only used 4 tablespoons of oil ( next time I'll probably only use 3) it was a bit oily. I only had a 1/3 cup of wine so I added chicken stock to make up for the missing amount. I simmered it for almost an hour to get the raw wine taste to cook out.  You could omit the wine and substitute beef stock or vegetable stock if you want it vegetarian. I may try that next time.  It was a quick and easy sauce to make. It is easily customizable to anyone's taste.

I turned this into a meat sauce, but didn't change the rest of the recipe much.  I read reviewers' suggestions & followed a few: added about 1/4 green bell pepper, about a Tbsp. of brown sugar, and more garlic.  I browned some ground beef, tossed in the finely minced onion & minced bell pepper & sauteed that. I then poured in the puree & cooked for a 1/2 hr.  I almost forgot--I used 2 Tbsp dried parsley since I didn't have any fresh. As a marinara, this is very good.  It needs some tweeking to turn into an awesome meat sauce.  I'll work on that next time around.

This recipe was okay, but only after quite a bit of altering. To start, the amount of oil seems excessive. I doubled the garlic, and I would add more onion next time.  I added about a half a teaspoon of garlic salt, 1 tablespoons of brown sugar to even out the super tart taste, and 1 teaspoon of dried basil.

Same as my recipe only I also use 1 tsp of basil as well. This recipe has served me well for years. It will be a fine addition to anyone's box, the secret is the stewed tomatoes. I've made it countless different ways substituting various things in, but I always go back to this. Pinot Grigio seems to taste the best in my version of this. I often cook 1 lb of sweet Italian sausage in the sauce, drop them right in raw and let it simmer for 3 hours to blend the flavors. Give it a try, it's excellent

Perfection! Lovely texture.  I did add two extra cloves garlic and one tablespoon brown sugar.  Easy as pie to make and endless ideas for serving,  such as using half the sauce and break 4 eggs into sauce, bake until eggs are just set,  then serve on toast as a warm winter breakfast or brunch.  Goes very well as a sauce for baked lamb chops, but add 1 cup water to maintain sauce consistancy. Also as a flavourful sauce over chicken or a thick portion of white fish (cod). Yum yum

Awesome recipe. 
I added 3 cloves of Garlic. 
I also finely diced a WHOLE sweet onion. 
I used about 3 tablespoons of fresh parsley ...fresh taste, not too strong. 
I read in one of the reviews to use crushed tomatoes.  I don't have a good processor, so this was a great option!!

I used this with Chicken Parmesan. It worked perfectly alongside it.

I absolutely love the idea of using a food processor (I used a blender) because my kids freak out if they see tomato pieces. I fried the onions first so I could blend them up too. Because I used a blender they couldn't even see the fresh herbs. My flavor didn't come out very well but I can certainly tweak some things to tailor it. The base is solid and this is easy to remember.

Made this recipe over the weekend and loved it.  I did have to substitute on can of diced tomatoes for the stewed because I only had one but I really don't think it made much of a difference.  
I have issues with cooking with wine because the receipes rarely tell you a type to use.  I googled it and kept coming up with don't use a wine you wouldn't drink, well I wouldn't drink any dry white wine so I went with a sweet.  It turned out great.  I didn't need the sugar I've seen in a lot of reviews so I guess I did an okay job.  Overall I'd recommend this recipe and I loved that I could use my own organic ingredients, made be feel better about eating it.

Excellent sauce.  I did not use the stewed tomatoes and cooked the garlic with the onion but those are the only changes.  My husband does not usually care for red sauce on his pasta but loved this one.

So good and quick and simple!  Who needs store-bought?  I added extra garlic, itslian seadonings, brown sugar and pinch of baking soda.  A touch sweet.  next time skip the sugar but do add the baking soda.  A keeper.

This sauce is super easy and versatile. The texture is perfect, too. I added an extra clove of garlic, brown sugar and red pepper flakes. Next time I'd probably cut the oregano in half because I'm not a big fan of oregano. Will definitely make this again.

Made this tonight. The guys LOVED it (I don't like anything with tomatos). The prep time took me more like 30 minutes. But that is because (gasp) I have never minced garlic before. I usually use the powder/salt. Decided to take a chance. It took me a while. 

I did make adjustments from other reviewers. Did 2 cloves garlic. Added basil, brown sugar and a tad of Italian seasoning. Also, made sure I got the salt free stewed tomatos. Reduced the olive oil (I don't measure, just eye it). Also did not use the wine. My husband does not like wine based sauces. Instead, I used 1/2 cup of the pasta water (A tip I learned from Alton Brown).

The guys said it tasted like they were at a restaurant! Yay me!

This really is lovely! Nice consistency but I did make a few changes. I used vegetable stock rather than white wine; I used shallots rather than onions; I used fresh oregano rather than dried and I didn't put any of it in a processor. 

I placed the tinned tomatoes, tomato paste, chopped parsley, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper into the skillet, heated it up and then added the veg stock. I also added a chopped up vine tomato. 

I simmered it for 30 mins and so it kept a bit of chunkiness which we like. 

It was a lovely sauce great for minced beef, seafood or by itself. I would highly recommend giving it a go!

Great recipe and super easy. 

In addition, I added:
3 anchovies (canned in oil, about 1 tablespoon mashed)
1 red pepper (needed to use it, and it added some sweetness)
1/2 cup chicken broth instead of wine
Used 1 whole onion because I love onions
Used a bit more garlic, probably 2-3 cloves, because garlic is delicious
Also used dried parsley instead of fresh as it is all I had
Added about 10 small fresh basil leaves at the end just before serving. 

Note: If you can use good quality San Marzano tomatoes for this, I highly suggest it! 


AMAZING. Simmered on low for about 50 minutes because it's so thick that it splatters a lot. Make sure you have a lid and are wearing long sleeves!

Perfect marinara I've ever had. Read a few reviews and made the following changes. Added 2 more cloves of garlic because I'm a garlic lover and I didn't have white wine on hand so I substituted apple cider vinegar! It was perfect! The bf absolutely loves it!

This really is the best marinara sauce yet. I use whole italian tomatoes and added fresh basil towards the end of cooking. Just the right consistancy and flavor was spot on! You do need to add a pinch of sugar as you would with most tomato sauce recipes. This was perfect on my chicken parmesan and spaghetti.

I made this to serve on mini meatball sandwiches. I was in hurry to get it assembled so I pureed all the ingredients, including the onion and oil prior to cooking in a saucepan for 30 minutes with the meatballs. I used two tablespoons of oil. I omitted the wine. This was delicious! Great flavor and so easy to make!

I have MY marinara sauce recipe but sometimes you just want a meatless version for a dipping sauce or for a small pasta side dish without all the fuss going into it.  This is the one for that!  It doesn't replace my main one, just an addition to my recipe file for different purposes.  It has great flavor and is quick and easy.  I doubled the garlic, added a teaspoon of basil, cut the oil in 1/2, added a tablespoon of brown sugar and cut the white wine down to 1/3 of a cup.  Very good!

Delicious. And I messed a lot of things up and got away with it: I forgot to buy an onion and used/burnt a shallot instead; I added onion powder because of the onion incident; and, I also used unmeasured fresh basil, oregano, and parsley. I think the key is the white wine --- it makes it delicious. I used cheap pino Grigio and it worked well

This is a great recipe. I swapped the parsley for fresh thyme and added about 5 sun dried tomatoes and it was amazing.

EXCELLENT!  I am always skeptical of recipes that have so few ingredients.  But this sauce was phenomenal in taste!  It is so easy to prepare that I will NEVER use store bought again!  I followed the recipe exactly except adding 1 tsp. of brown sugar.  I always believed that the sugar takes some of the tartness out of the tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing!

I will buy jarred sauce so much less now that I found this recipe.  It is just too easy to make.  But ease of reputation is not why I gave this recipe five stars.  The sauce is absolutely divine.  For my personal tastes, I agree with the notion of adding basil and white sugar to give it sweet tones.  I use two tsp basil, one tbsp sugar, and one more tsp of oregano.

Excellent sauce!!! It's the only one I make now and it's so easy. I add sugar and fresh basil and saute the onions in olive oil first. It's great with all kinds of pasta and on top of chicken parm. By adding extra spices you can use it for pizza sauce too. I love it!

Excellent sauce. No changes made and none needed. Would like to make again with all fresh herbs. Used in conjunction w/ “Little Lamb Meatballs in a Spicy Eggplant Tomato Sauce” on this site.

So I tired this recipe today and I doubled it as is... I found that the amount of wine that was used was way too much and over powering. For my taste the amount of parsley was a little too much too. I ended up having to add a 3rd can of tomato puree and I simmered the sauce with a cut in half potato, to help get rid off the over powering wine flavor. I would try this recipe, but half or less of the wine and parsley.

Not that this recipe needs another 5 star rating but this was super easy and tasted great!  I totally recommend this!  I would suggest using a blender or immersion blender to puree this completely.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a great quick and easy marinara sauce.  Instead of the stewed tomatoes I used fresh, peeled tomatoes as my garden went crazy and I had to do something with all those tomatoes. I would saute the garlic with the onions next time

DON'T ADD BROWN SUGAR, PEOPLE! I added this as some reviewers said to do. BAD IDEA! Now, my 10 servings of sauce is ruined because I hate sweet sauce. Ugh. I'm 0 for 2 tonight on all recipes.

Great recipe! Very easy to make. I made some adjustments to suit my taste and what I had on hand. I used about 10 medium sized garden tomatoes. I only used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and I used dried parsley rather than fresh. I also added 2 tablespoons of sugar. I let it simmer for about 4 hours and then blended the whole mixture to make it smooth. I then added some cooked ground turkey to the mix to make a meat sauce. It is way better than the canned stuff! Will continue to make again and again!

We loved this recipe! It was simple and delicious. Quite the departure from our usual meat sauce, but I think it's going to become more like the norm. I made this to go over meatball subs and am now looking for a killer fried or baked cheese recipe to go with the leftovers. Yum!

This sauce is like Baby Bear, it's "just right"! I've made many, and most are too thin or too chunky. This sauce's combination of canned tomatoes and tomato paste yields the perfect consistency. I have to admit, I changed the recipe to use ingredients I had on hand. I used a 28oz can of San Marzano whole tomatoes, the tomato paste, about 1 tablespoon homemade Italian seasoning in place of the parsley/oregano, 3 cloves of garlic (because if some garlic is good, a lot is better), about 2 tablespoons dried minced onions, salt, black pepper, olive oil, and whoops!, didn't even realize it was supposed to have wine. I blended it all in my food processor and cooked it as directed. It was a bit too acidic for my taste, so I added about 1 teaspoon brown sugar. So let's say this recipe was my inspiration. The Dude said it was the best marinara he's ever had, and I have to agree. We like it better than Chef John's tomato sauce! Served over spicy beef & sausage ravioli, it was pasta perfection.

I've made this three times and have stopped buying store marinara. I double the recipe, use whatever tomatoes I have on hand and add extra garlic and two teaspoons or so of brown sugar. Also I use my immersion blender rather than hauling out the food processor. Simmer time for me is about an hour. This freezes great. I put two cups into a freezer ziploc then stack them, so I always can have this yummy sauce on hand.

This recipe is fabulous!  I used crushed canned tomatoes because my food processor is broken. (Less cleanup as well.) Also added more garlic because we love garlic. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and my guests loved it!  Served over the Oven Fried Parmesan Chicken Recipe on this site (baked in the oven topped with mozzarella cheese), pasta, side salad, and garlic bread. So easy!  I brought out more bread so we could dunk the remainder in the sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

This is great. It is now my go to pasta sauce, so easy to make. I use red wine instead of white, and I add basil and a pinch of sugar to offset the sometimes bitter taste of the canned tomatoes. We like chunky marinara, so I dont usually run this through the food processor. I also add a couple of extra cans of either diced tomatoes or crushed tomatoes, sometimes one of each.

Loved this easy recipe! Very easy to freeze and use later. I used 4 tablespoons of olive oil rather than 6 and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar instead of 1/2 white wine. Tasted great! I would suggest starting with 1/8 cup of apple cider vinegar and tasting first before you add the remaining 1/8th cup as this flavor is very strong.

Although this recipe has been posted for a while, I just discovered and made this today.  It is AMAZING - just delicious!  I made the recipe as listed with just a couple of revisions - I used two cloves of garlic instead of one as I like a bit of extra flavor and I omitted the white wine as I am not a big drinker or user of alcohol.  Came out great!  Made just enough for a nice batch of manicotti.  Thanks for the share!

This sauce is delicious and so easy to make! I've put it in my Recipe Box and copied by hand into a book of favorite recipes. The only changes I made was to add 1 t. of dried basil and 1 TB brown sugar. I can stop looking for marinara recipes! Thank you, Jackie!

I made a few changes: no parsley (I didn't have any, so the sauce probably would have been even better with it); subbed 1 tsp. garlic powder for the clove of garlic (I didn't have any fresh garlic); added 1 tbsp. sugar. I sauteed the onions in a stock pot, then added all the ingredients right into the pot and used an immersion blender. It could not have been easier, and the sauce was delicious!

I did not have any cooking wine, but didn't need any extra liquid. In the future I will cut the pepper for my sensitive toddler, but otherwise won't change a thing!

Skipped the tomato paste (didn't have it) and replaced with Hunt's Tomato Sauce.  I also didn't add the wine, but this was still really delicious.  Let simmer for 1 and 1/2 hours.  Really nice with Meatball Nirvana recipe and Olive Garden's recipe for Bruschetta Pomodoro.

This sauce is great! It's easy to prepare and holds well when kept in the fridge or freezer to be used at a later date. I substitued Marsala wine for the white wine, which gave the sauce a bit of a sweeter tang so I would recomend using that instead. Either way, a great sauce!

My go to recipe for a basic red sauce. However, I amp up the garlic.  It freezes well and is quick, easy and versatile. This sauce is great on its own or added with meat.

I love this recipe because it's so easy and so delicious. I did have to make some substitutes though. I used crushed tomatoes, not stewed. I also add 1 tsp basil, 1/2 Tbsp salt, 1 Tbsp sugar, and usually use less olive oil than it calls for because I don't like it too oily. It is a good base to add onto with good proportions, which is why I gave it 4 stars. But honestly, who doesn't tweak pasta sauce to suit their own tastes??

I make this all the time, and it is great!  I do make a few changes, but nothing that changes the nature of the recipe.  I don't use the parsley because I never have fresh parsley.  Instead of just oregano I do 1/2 tsp oregano and a 1/2 tsp basil.  I also add about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  I use about 1/2 the olive oil and 1/2 the amount of wine as well.  We use this as is, or sometimes we add meat to it.  Either way, it is delicious.  No jarred sauce for us ever again!

Not the best marinara sauce, but it was pretty good.  Would have given in 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It wasn't too flavorful, so I added some oregano, basil & garlic salt.

Pretty tasty. I did use Moscato because it was the only kind of wine I had. Also, I added about 2 T of sugar to make it sweeter after making/tasting as is.

Substituted Ginger Ale for the white wine, but don't use too much otherwise it turns out too runny.  Easy, fast, and delicious sauce to make.  Plus I've found it's cheaper than the jar stuff.

I chose this recipe for marinara sauce because I wanted to use my new food processor.  It was amazing!  I ended up adding italian seasoning because I was out of oregano.  The wine I used was a cheap Reisling I had on hand.  I served the Marinara over Turkey Meatballs.

I made this last night and it was very good, and very easy for someone who has never made tomato sauce before! I did do as some reviewers suggested and added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I also added more garlic, a few bay leaves, and 1/4 tsp red chili flakes for a tiny amount of heat.  This recipe is great and I can see it being SO flexible! Add whatever you want once you have created the base recipe - it will turn out amazing!

Excellent with the addition of some basil!

EDIT: I made this again as a red clam sauce and it was FANTASTIC.  I added the liquid from 1 can of clams as well as some more juice from a bottle and let the sauce simmer.  Added the baby clams a few minutes before serving so they could heat through but wouldn't over-cook.

This sauce is amazing on texture, easy and delicious! I tried it in the middle of the night and had no white wine or chicken stock, so I used water with a splash of balsamic. I used only about 1/4 cup of oil for 2 times the original recipe. Also, I added a couple of leaves basil to the blender, and a pinch of brown sugar and red pepper flake to the onions, which I crystallized a bit more time. Yum!!! :o)

Excellent sauce and so easy to put together.  I think the white wine does make a difference so I recommend it.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced, and I added about 1 tsp. of brown sugar to cut the acidity. Next time I'll increase the oregano and add some basil, but other than that I think this recipe is very good as written.  Thanks for sharing!

The best sauce we have ever had! I will never buy sauce in a jar again. My 13 year old son raved about it. he is the spaghetti expert in the house. Of course I know a good sauce. Will use it for Lasagna, my eggplant, Ravioli , everything. Only think I added was a bay leaf , a pinch or two of chili flakes, dried Basil, and a few extra cloves of garlic. Simmered for 30 min.

I enjoy this recipe, but I change it up a lot every time I make it, mostly using other peoples advice as well!:
I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, much better consistency!
I used dried parsley instead of fresh
I always use pinot grigio for the wine, gives a slightly sweet, but bitter taste all at the same time.
I add 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper to give it a SLIGHT bite of heat
I add 1 tblspn brown sugar
1 tblspn italian seasoning
I also make meatballs, and let the sauce cook for a hours with meatballs and pepperoni slices. The longer the better!

My grandmother is a little Italian lady so I have a lot to live up to! This recipe fits the bill with some small changes, so thanks!

A very good sauce. I didn't have any white wine, so omitted that. Added extra seasoning and included thyme, a bay leaf, and some red chili flakes. Turned out very good with enough to freeze and share.

Can't pinpoint what, but it was missing something.  Was still very tasty though.  Would make again, possibly adding more seasonings.

This is very tasty sauce but I can't give it 5 stars because I believe the amount of olive oil is just way too much! I usually read the reviews prior to making a recipe but didn't have time. After making this and realizing how much oil it called for, I went back and looked and read about 12 reviews before anyone even mentioned it. I know it's only for sautéing the onion, but 6 tbs for 1/3 cup onion? Ridiculous! I should have drained it but instead, I followed the recipe and added the  sauce and wine. It tasted good, but you could see it was oily. 2 tbsp would be plenty! I don't know if that was a typo or if someone just really likes olive oil, but that is my only complaint with this recipe. I used chardonnay for the wine because that was all we had. It was really very good, despite the oil issue.

I'm making this gravy for the first time as we speak. I followed most of the recipe. Unfortunately, I don't have a food processor.  I used just tomato sauce and elminated the wine. I did add sugar to cut down on the acid. This gravy reminds me of my Mother's and it smells amazing in my house right now. Thanks for the great recipe!

The name of this sauce is so fitting.  My family LOVED it. I used with Parmesan Chicken. I did omit the wine and added some sugar and ketchup to cut the tartness and some Italian Seasoning.*I made a large batch to freeze for convenience. Will be sharing this recipe with my friends.

Outstanding is all I can say! I was looking for a marinara sauce to use for dipping garlic bread sticks in. This seemed easy enough and with so many reviews I thought I'd give it a try. Again... OUTSTANDING! This will definitely be in the favorites and will become our special sauce for homemade pizza as well! Thanks for sharing

Made this with the Meatball Nirvana (this website...sub 1/2 C ricotta cheese for skim milk if you try it) and the combination was excellent.  For this marinara, I did used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed and increased the herbs listed in recipe to suit our taste.   The only other addition was a little cayene pepper to give it a little more kick but it complimented the sweet taste of the sauce.   Excellent!

This sauce is perfect for any Italian dish. I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used some dried other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making this again. Love it!

I made this for company. Everyone liked it. I did saute the onion and garlic on olive oil. I used italian stewed tomatoes. I also added a bit of brown sugar. I added meatballs and sausage and served with spaghetti. I deglazed may pans with the wine. WONDERFUL. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great, kid-friendly sauce. I did feel like one clove of garlic was not quite enough so I added a few extra and used less olive oil as well.  The next time I make this I may try to use red wine instead, as the white wine gives the sauce a really sweet flavor.

Delicious and easy! I chopped up half a green pepper and added it to the mix. This marinara tastes very fresh, and waaaaaay better than jarred sauce. Next time I will double it and freeze some. Yum!

This was super good. I didn't have stewed tomatoes but used canned whole tomatoes and omitted the onions & olive oil. I added some cayenne and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Simmed for about an hour and added a bay leaf. I also added a can of mushrooms to the plan before simmering.

So DELICIOUS! I did make a few changes but other than that I followed the recipe. I made meat balls for the sauce, so I first browned the meatballs on a skillet then I added diced onion & garlic until almost translucent, then added diced carrots. After adding the tomato sauce I added a pinch of sugar and instead of white whine (didn't have any) I added a 1/2 cup of warm water with about a tablespoon of chicken bouillon. While tomato sauce was warming up I added 1 bay leaf. Other than that I followed the recipe and it really was the best Marinara sauce I have ever tasted!

Just made this sauce for dinner, YUMMY! I didn't have fresh parsley so i just used dry italian sesonings and for some kick red pepper flakes. I also sauted the garlic and the onions first, then just used my hand held blender to get the consistancy I wanted. I will never buy store bought marinara again. Next time will add bell pepper and maybe mushrooms when simmering.

Perfect! I loved it, if you wanted you could add some other spices according to your own preferences. But just following these measurements it made the PERFECT dipping sauce to go with parmesan pull apart bread, and would go equally well with spaghetti!

NOMG so good.  i halved it, then added reconstituted textured vegetable protein to the sauce, then mixed whole wheat pasta into the sauce.  i didn't have parsley or tomato paste so I used some medium salsa, added 2x the amount of oregano and garlic.  i added a couple of splashes of white wine vinegar--didn't have the white wine.  I added some chile powder and cumin to give it a slight kick.

The sauce was very delicious. Though, i didn't read correctly at first;
I used a blender. Worked excellent.
I put 1 can of tomato's in there on accident. I didn't see i need 2, so after i had it on the stove simmering 15 minutes in i notices i needed another can. i added one and it still turned out awesome. 

i made it for meatball sub. both me and my husband enjoyed it.

Literally the best homemade marinara sauce I've tried! I had to add just a little more salt and garlic but other than that,the best! Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic!  Plenty of flavour and so easy.  I did use 3 cloves of garlic (we LOVE garlic in this house) and didn't have oregano so had to use a big pinch of thyme and a big pinch of marjoram.  The white wine really brings out the flavour of the tomatoes.  This is going to be my go to pasta sauce recipe from now on.

I started off making this to the recipe apart from doubling the garlic. But after tasting I added 2t of sugar and some chopped fresh basil. I probably let this simmer for longer too, maybe 45 minutes to an hour. My daughters loved it. I will definitely be doubling this recipe in future, it's going to be very handy to have in the freezer. Thankyou Jackie.

I only changed a few things.  I also thought the tomatoes were too acidic, as other reviewers noted, so I added the 1 Tbl of brown sugar as someone suggested to balance things out.  Worked splendidly!  I didn't have fresh parsley or fresh garlic, but the dried and powdered alternatives in proper substitute measurements worked just fine.  I only used 1/4 C white wine.  Soooo good!  AND easy and fast!  I don't think I'll go back to jars again!!  Thank you for posting this recipe, Jackie!!

This sauce takes some time to make but it is worth it.  Next time, I will add a little sugar.  I did not add any salt.  Will keep this one around for sure. Made this to go with "chicken parmesan casserole" from this site.

This was perfect.  I put it over some chicken for chicken parmesan and my very picky husband LOVED it.  I don't usually like plain marinara sauce (I gotta have the meat), but even we put this on spaghetti the next day it was amazing!!  I also added just a tiny bit of fresh basil (it was our anniversary and basil is an aphrodisiac)...yummy!!

This is delicious! The last marinara sauce I made from scratch was so bad it almost turned me off homemade ones for good, but this one saved it for me. I think it's the white wine that really makes the difference, and the flavour is definitely better the longer it sits. The only thing I changed was to cut back on the amount of oil (to about 2-3 Tbsp), and salt (to 1/2-3/4 tsp) a little bit, just to suit my family's tastes. Yummy! This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe from now on. Thank you!

LOVE this.  It is a staple in our house.  I double the recipe and freeze it in two cup containers.  I substitute red wine for white and I add 3 medium cans of drained sliced olives to it.

This was super easy and cheap compared to buying a quality marinara. I added some Italian sausage by cooking it separately then adding it to the sauce half way through. Really great recipe. Will definitely make this again.

This is a great basic marinara sauce recipe but I had to tweak it just a bit.  I did add about a teaspoon or so of dried basil and about 1 1/2 tsp. Italian seasonings.  I also had to add some brown sugar to counter the tartness/acidity of the whole thing.  In the future I think I will use fresh basil instead of the fresh parsley and add dried parsley in its stead.  In the end I was left with a very flavorful sauce that went very well with meatballs that I had made from a recipe found on this site.

Very good and versatile.  I substituted veggie broth for the wine, as I didn't have any open.  I think next time I'll either cut the salt down or omit it entirely as I felt the paste and canned tomatoes and broth had more than enough in them.

Trusted the other reviews and made a triple batch of this  to freeze.  It is AMAZING!!  I'm so glad to have this recipe.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh (cut the amount in half) and diced the onion in the food processor so i didn't have to chop.  Massive 5 stars!!

I could drink this sauce!  I added a splash of hot sauce and about a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I also used fresh oregano and garlic, and used chicken broth instead of wine.  It turned out perfectly! So delicious!

I should probably rate this with 4 stars but because I made alterations I can't fault the recipe.  I used italian seasoning instead of dried oregano and crushed tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  I also added a splash of pinot grigio and about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.

Delicious and authentic!  I added 2 tsp. dried basil and a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  I used this with the "Best Meatballs" recipe.  Even my son who is quite a gourmet cook (never follows recipes) loved this sauce!

Increase onion, garlic and spices, add fresh basil, and add 1 Tbl brown sugar.  Excellent!  Will make again and again.

Yummy, Yummy - I made a couple of changes due to other reviews and what I had on hand. I used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, didn't use parsley, added a bay leaf, 1 TBS brown sugar, and fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the onion and garlic. This sauce was amazing. I agree with others who said the sauce was even better the next day. Next time I make this I am going to AT LEAST double. Thanks so much for sharing Jackie!!

My first time making marinara and it really was the easiest recipe ever. It was pretty tasty only I probably should have added a bit of sugar as recommended by another member to help the acidity but it still have a great flavor. Will make again!

This turned out super great! I made this in conjunction with "Three Animal Italian Meatballs" by Steve. GREAT COMBINATION!!  Fresh herbs used of course.  I froze the 2nd half of the batch and it reheated wonderfully!  Great for more than one meal... getting inspired to make it again just by typing this...lol

I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and added extra garlic... and it was delicious! This recipe gets 5 stars because of the simplicity of the sauce. The basic ingredients really allow the tomato flavor to shine.

Excellent. Puts jarred sauces to shame. I decreased the oil to 4 tablespoons, and after reading other reviews, used an additional clove of garlic and used italian seasoning liberally. I used sweet Reisling wine and a touch of brown sugar to decrease the acidity. It was excellent fresh made, but when I tried it again, I let sit overnight as other reviewers suggested, and I concur. It is superb the next day.

I used Fresh Herbs and this tasted great.  I did feel like the parsley was on the heavy side and had to make sure I really blended it up well.

I tried this to use in dipping with toasted ravioli (a St. Louis thing).  I would recommend cutting the olive oil to about 1/3 of what the recipe calls for and use more garlic and spices.  It was very good and easy to make.  My family really liked it.

Absolutely delicious.  I had stopped buying jarred marinara sauce due to the risk of BPA, but now I can make my own and it's even better than the jarred stuff.  Super easy, too!

5 stars for how easy this was to make and the taste is great!! I added about a tablespoon of salt and one clove of garlic. I used Pinot Gregio wine. I thought is was perfect buy my roommate thinks I should use a different wine next time or less of it. I think this is my staple marinara recipe from now on.

This was excellent! My only problem was that I had a hard time getting the parsley to soften up. I made it on a lazy afternoon and let it simmer along for a couple of hours. I served it the next day as the sauce for chicken parm! Very, very yummy!

I used canned fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic. but I think i should have added another clove. I did not have wine so i omitted that when I made this. But I must say this was fantastic!! I made home made pizza with this sauce. and also boiled up a bit of pasta since i didnt want pizza. It was so good. and so so so simple!!  No more jars for me :)

I really like this marinara sauce, usually I don't like too much marinara sauce with things like bread sticks but I made this one (cut in half) to go over my "Zucchini Patties" found on this recipe and it worked great and I loved the flavor. The wine brings something special to it. I will definately use it anytime I am looking for a Marinara Sauce.

This truly is "The Best Marinara Sauce Yet"!!!  My search is over!! I love this recipe, it's easy, fast and fantastic tasting.  I try to not change too much when I try new recipes, because then the review wouldn't be accurate and I just don't think that's fair to do. So, I followed the recipe exactly, only adding fesh basil and oregano instead of dried (because I love fresh herbs!) and 1 tsp. brown sugar and "Presto"!  It's delicious!  Thank you so much for this great recipe, it's a definite keeper!

I made this with fresh tomatoes since I didn't have canned. I blend the tomatoes and added it to a pan with some garlic and olive oil. I added the dried oregano, paste, parsley and wine but didn't have onions. I added some sugar and pepper flakes and it was good! I like the wine flavor. I'm going to try with the canned crushed tomatoes sometime soon.

This was definitely easy to make and went over well with the family.  BUT I was sort of disappointed with the acid taste. I used organic canned tomatoes and organic canned paste. Added a heaping tablsp of brown sugar as other recommended, but still not quite right.

I was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  It was so easy, simple, and really good.  It had a much fresher taste than a jarred sauce.  I served it with chicken parm and angel hair pasta.  Next time - I will double the recipe though.

I made this last night to go with my breaded shrimp. I tastes exactly like store-bought varities. I may try this again with fresh tomatoes, because the flavors of the stewed, canned tomatoes was somewhat flat.

This was very easy to make and sooo yummy!  I had to find a recipe that had very simple tastes because my picky, 8 year old niece was visiting.  This was just perfect. I will definitely make enough of this to can so that we never have to purchase canned sauce again.

I didn't think that this was going to turn out that great, but it was really good! I was really surprised since while cooking it, I didn't think it smelled that great. I omitted the 1/2 cup white wine and instead used a 1/2 cup white grape juice. The initial recipe didn't make up that much, so next time I'll double the recipe. Tastes even better the second day!

I wish I had found this recipe sooner! I was skeptical at first but it's so easy to make and it tastes like it came out of a jar.  I used extra garlic and sautéed sliced mushrooms with the onion.  I definitely will be making this more often!

Great marinara sauce!  Exactly what I was looking for to use on my meatball subs.  I used 1 - 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and skipped the step of blending it all together.  I also substituted chicken broth for the wine because I didn't have any.  Thanks!

This was a hit in my house! My husband said this was the best Marinare sauce he has ever had. I added one more garlic glove and used chicken broth instead of the wine and i also tossed in black olives. My husband says he cant wait for me to make it again.

Very good and very easy to make.  Excellent flavor using minimal ingredients.  I took off a star only because of too much olive oil; I ended up dipping off the excess before serving.

Reminds me of the marinara from my favorite Italian restaurant!  I didn't have time to go to the store, so I had to use diced tomatoes, but it still turned out great.  Like some others suggested, I added to red pepper flakes for heat.

My family absolutely loved this sauce. I am only giving it 4 stars because I modified it a bit: 1 large clove garlic, only 2 tbs olive oil, 1 medium chopped onion, and probably doubled the spices. Thanks alot for an easy recipe for my Italian family:)

I really liked this sauce until I added the wine. I don't drink but I've started experimenting with cooking wine. When I first added the wine, the alcohol smell was overwhelming. After 30 minutes of simmering, the alcohol smell was less but I could still taste it. When I tasted the recipe before adding the recipe, it was really good. Maybe I'll just make the recipe and leave out the wine next time...

First time to make homemade marinara sauce and this recipe is the best. I will never buy again. I didn't have white wine so I used red one. I don't like tomato paste so I used fresh tomato, tomato sauce and I put one table spoon of ketchup. It is just lovely. By the way I made as a pizza sauce.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and I always get so many compliments on it. I add way more garlic(4 cloves) and make sure I use a nice Chardonnay. Everything else I do exactly as the recipe says.  I cook it for an hour and constantly stir it. Then I refigerate. I make it a day in advance or early in the morning of the day I am serving it. It tastes so much better over time. I think the key ingredients that really make this recipe so out of this world is choosing an nice White wine and the fresh parsley makes it a stand out. Thank You so much for this recipe.

Once I discovered this recipe I stopped buying jar sauce.   It is so easy to make and tastes great.  I decrease the olive oil to approx. 3 tbsp. and use Italian style stewed tomatoes and paste as well as  the seasonings as called for in the recipe.  I also add a tablespoon or so of sugar.   Sooo good!

Wow, this was really good, and ridiculously easy.  I'm not sure exactly how much garlic I put, but it was probably more than one clove, because I'm a garlic fan.  Same with the black pepper.  I served it with linguine and would certainly make it again.

This recipe produces a very flavorful marinara sauce with a nice consistency. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1 TBSP of brown sugar to the food processor mixture.

This was the easiest sauce I've ever made!  I loved that it contained most things that people already have on hand.  I did up the garlic too, to two cloves.  I added dried basil (1 tsp) as well.  I also added white sugar (1 tsp).  It does freeze well.  For wine, I used Chardonnay.

I honestly did not like this very much. I tought it tasted too much like pizza sauce.  After the 1/2 hr of cooking I ended up adding about a 1/2 cup of tomatoes and some basil to it and I still didn't like the taste.. Sorry!

I've made this recipe a few times now, and it's ALWAYS a hit! The second time, I drained the stewed tomatoes and it was PERFECTION! It gave me a bit thicker consistancy, which I prefer. I do up the garlic content quite a bit, and took a tip from a previous reviewer adding brown sugar. Those are the only changes I make, and this is now my staple recipe for sauce. Yesterday, I made and froze about 16 quarts!!!! Yes, it's THAT good!

Very good! The only change I made was to use one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of diced, just because that's what I had on hand. I used this is place of the jarred sauce called for in AR's Simply Traditional Lasagna and it worked very well. Thanks! :)

Thanks so much for this recipe. This is my base gravy recipe that I always use (I'm using it tonight). I don't put anything in the food processor, though. I also add some water in my sauce, and add a cup of lacatelli (sp?) grated romano cheese. I also add chopped fresh basil, and usually turn this into some sort of meat sauce (meatballs, etc). This is a GREAT recipe to use if you need a good basic sauce.

This is fabulous. I only used 3 tbsp olive oil, and added 1 tbsp brown sugar.  I let it simmer for three hours, threw in some turkey meatballs with 30 minutes to go, and it was perfect.  My husband's new favorite!

This was okay.  I didn't really care for the olive oil flavor though.

Incredible recipe! I don't have a food processor (RIP time to buy a new one)so I used one of those handheld processors. I saute'd the onions and garlic then added in all the rest of the ingredients as well as a tsp. brown sugar. Made the sauce with meatballs for a sandwich, it was great!! Thanks Jackie!

I doubled this recpe but made the following changes.  I added 20 oz Turkey Italian Sausage and used 3 cloves of garlic.  I also just used 1 chopped large onion and only 6 oz of Pinot Grigio.  This is a great sauce!  I am glad I doubled it because no I have some to freeze :-)

This sauce was really yummy!  I find at restaurants marinaras seem too runny and watery...this was perfect!  I used it for a meatball sandwich recipe and it went perfectly!  Nice and thick, I may end up using this sauce on pasta when I go meatless!  Thanks!  8D

Amazing sauce. Tastes great with a meatball lasagna I found on this web site. I make double the batch and freeze it in small containers.

This was really easy and really good.  I sauted the onion and garlic in a little olive oil then put in the blender with the stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce.  I also added a pinch of basil and parsley.  The consistency of the sauce was perfect!

This is a great marinara sauce.  Even my 5 year old who is extremely picky loves this sauce.  I only put in half of the wine, however.  I love to serve it with homemade meatballs.

This was an amazingly simple and delicious sauce.  I left out the onions, b/c I have people who don't like "chunks".  I also did the substitution with the chicken broth.  This was awesome with bread sticks, and amazing on our stuffed crust pizza.  I will be making spaghetti with it next week.  So easy to make, and DELICIOUS!!

I'll confess, I made changes.  It was great though!  I used only 1 can of dice tomatoes (Italian style) and 1 can of tomato sauce instead of 2 cans of stewed tomatoes.  I also skipped on the food processor.  Everything else was according to recipe, however.  It was still wonderful!  The wine I used in the sauce, I served with dinner and what a wonderful complement!

I would definitely make this one again.  It is a great sauce, but I would doctor it up a little bit.  I would probably add some veggies to it.

I normally make meat sauces because thats want DH likes but wanted to try something different. I love marinara but never made it before. This recipes was wonderful and very easy to prepare. The texture, the consistency, the flavor, everything was perfect. DH ever loved it. Next time I think I'll double the recipes to have some for the freezer.

Delicious!  This sauce is perfect as written.  I cut the recipe in half and used it on stuffed bell peppers.  Yummy.  I did not need to add any sugar, but if I put it over pasta, it may have needed it.  As others have mentioned, I recommend brown sugar for sweetening pasta sauce.  Just 1T will counter the acidic flavor of the tomatoes.

I've made this sauce several times.  It is quick and easy.  I use less oil, add a little more garlic and use a chardonnay for the wine.  It is thick and delicious.  No more buying marinara again.

As a beginner in the kitchen, this was my first attempt at homemade marinara sauce and it was fantastic! It was sweeter than I expected it to be but still great...maybe the sweetness was b/c I didn't have any white wine on hand. I love garlic so I added 3 cloves rather than 2...the next time I make this I'll probably add 4. And, yes there will be a next time - loved it!

This was a good recipe.  I did take the advice of some other reviewers and used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed.  Instead of fresh parsley, I used 1 tablespoon of dried parsley and added 2 tablespoons of dried basil. Since I didn't have any white wine on hand, I used chicken broth instead.  I also let this simmer for 3 hours, which I think really enhanced the flavor.  My husband said its taste was restaraunt quality.

Good sauce. I added more garlic because I am me but to each their own. It will be fun to try different wines with it too. I used white but a merlot might be fun too.  Great place to start and easy to make.

This was great sauce. I like adding wine to the recipe. I also added mushrooms sauted with the onions. It was great. I have made this a few times now. Combined it yesterday for Christmas with the "Baked Ziti I" and everyone loved it.

Wow, really disappointing. While the sauce was very edible, I'd have to say that it wasn't even as good as most store bought jars.

I made 2 changes, however, I don't believe they would change this from a 3 star to a 5 star recipe. The changes I made were to use 1 Tbsp of dried parsely instead of fresh and to use 5 Tbsp of olive oil instead of 6.

I've made a better sauce and will post the recipe at a later date. I personally like more garlic, a little basil and usually add a little brown sugar.

This sauce is delicious.  I did make one change - I substituted 1/2 Cup Beef Stock for the white wine.  My 4-year old won't eat anything with wine in it and the beef stock added a rich, meaty flavor to the sauce.

I made a test batch of this and found it too sweet with an off taste. I let it meld overnight and it didn't help. I think it's the sugar in the stewed tomatoes. I won't be making this again

Definitely a good everyday marinara. My family has an old Sicilian recipe that we make for special occasions, but this one will do for quick pasta bakes and meatball subs.

This sauce is awesome.  I did make the changes suggested by others.  But I used it for a pasta dish and it was delish.  I am using the rest tonight for my breadsticks.

Oustanding.  I followed the recipe to the tee the first time and it was delicious.  The second time I used half the olive oil (or it's too oily), crushed tomatoes (organic) and added 2 fresh basil leaves.  I'll never buy spaghetti sauce in the store again!  And it's so easy to make!

I used basil instead of parsley, more garlic and pinot grigio.  We thought this was good, but I won't switch from my current recipe.  Nice change though.

This was good but I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I sauted mushrooms along with onion and also added sugar. I will make this again but not without some changes.

Pretty darn good, basic marinara sauce.  I added a cup of (rehydrated) dried TVP (textured vegetable protein) to make a meatless "meat' sauce.  I love how easy this is to make!

This is a great sauce!  Not only is it delicious, it is super easy and fast to make.  I made this for my daughter's birthday, then again to top eggplant parmesan, and both times got good reviews.  So no matter what you use the sauce for, it works great!  Like others, I added some brown sugar to neutralize the acidity of all the tomato products, which I think is important.  And I upped the amount of garlic to 2 cloves the second time because the first time it seemed just a hair bland.  I will say though, this is the first, and only, sauce recipe I have ever made twice -- no others quite compare.  Very yummy and worth making over and over again!

I have never reviewed a recipe before but felt that I must review this one.  Really great recipe - was a hit with the whole family.  I made this in the morning before leaving for work and put it all in the crock pot to cook on low all day.  Delicious and perfect consistency.  I doubled the recipe and there was plenty left over for another recipe.  I had been looking for a good marinara recipe and am so glad I tried this one.  this is a real keeper.

This sauce is absolutely fantastic!  The white wine threw me a bit at first since I've always used cianti in marinara, but I gave it a go with Pinot Grigio and it was worth it.  Didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I estimated an equivalent with dried.  Also, didn't measure my garlic, just tossed in a few heaping tablespoons.  Midway through simmering, I added meatballs for flavor (Best Meatballs You'll Ever Have - from this site) and that enhanced this sauce even more.  Oh, and I threw in a bay leaf, too.

Not bad but not great. I didn't have tomato paste, so I substitued some cornstarch to thicken things up. I think I would have liked this better with more garlic, a can of petite diced tomatoes added, and red wine instead of white.

Not bad. Its tasty. And easy to make which is a bonus...The only thing is that I did not use stewed tomatoes. That might be the issues.

Best  Marinara i have ever had, Period. I added 1T of sugar and i need to play with that a bit because it was a tad to sweet but i felt it was necessary to counter the acidity. I also used 2 more cloves of garlic which i found to be perfect. The consistency, smell, taste and amazingly quick preparation time makes it difficult to even buy jarred sauce anymore. We all owe whom ever posted this recipe a huge hug.

My search has ended for the perfect Marinara sauce!  It is soooo good and soooo easy to prepare.  I added a tbs. of brown sugar.
Next time I will double in order to have a spare batch in the freezer.

my husband really liked the sweet taste of this marinara when i used it to make eggplant parmesan. i made modifications based on other reviews: added more garlic and 1 tbsp of brown sugar. i also substituted shallot for onion, and after sauteing blended the shallots with the tomatoes for a smoother consistency. this sauce was quick and easy and i will definitely use it again.

This is a lovely (and fast) sauce, Jackie. I made a few changes though. I used diced tomatoes, upped the garlic, added about a teaspoon of basil, and used a can of tomato sauce so I could simmer a little longer.  Oh, I also threw in a bay leaf and a smidge of brown sugar.  With your basic recipe and the kind suggestions of other reviewers, I ended up with a lovely sauce.  This definitely goes in the "keeper" file.  Thanks again!

Very good for lasagna and other baked dishes.

I omitted the salt, used 2 cloves of garlic, and added a tbsp of sugar at the end as others have suggested.  I also like to blend or process tomato sauces after they're done (and cooled) and refrigerate overnight.  They always seem to taste better the next day.

Really yummy.  Thick and chunky yet enough liquid to eat over pasta. My changes when tried, based on what I had at home:

2 TBSP dried parsley, not 4 TBSP fresh 
4 cloves garlic not 1
1 medium finely diced onion not 1/3
ADD 6 tsp fresh chopped basil
NO oregano
3 TBSP olive oil not 6
1/2 cup chicken broth, instead of white wine (didn't have, but next time will try with Pinot Grigio)
ADD 1 bell pepper, chopped
ADD sliced mushrooms- 8 oz of baby bella 
Brown meat with onion, 3 bay leaves, and 1 TBSP ital seasoning then cook in crockpot on high 3 hrs and serve.

This is a very simple recipe for a delicious marinara sauce. I am a big fan of cream based sauces, but I am trying to get into a healthy lifestyle. I made the marinara sauce last night and it came out good. I took a reviewer's suggestion and added half can of tomato paste. I won't do that again. But, I am glad I cut back on olive oil and added another clove of garlic as other reviewers suggested. I definitely feel I could get used to healthy sauces with such great recipes. Thank you very much.

Made this sauce last night to add to the Artichoke Lasagna recipe and it was fantastic.  The only change was I used the italian style stewed tomatoes and added a tablespoon of italian spices I recently purchased from the famous spice man in Rome at Campo di Fiore market. Sure wish I could get more of his spices, but a little too far to travel to Rome from California.  A GREAT RECIPE.  No more jar marinara sauce for our family - so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

With a few simple adjustments this recipe can easily improve any simple pasta dish into something special. I think this recipe is delicious, and so simple.

I love this sauce.  Is very good as is, but I have experimented as well with adding more garlic, a bit of sugar, and a little less olive oil as it tends to be a bit much and I love olive oil!  I keep getting requests for this and will continue to make it again and again.  Thanks so much!

Quick, easy and so delicious.  I substituted crushed tomatoes for the stewed because that is all I had on hand.  Sauce was so tasty.  My husband has already requested that I make this again.

Do NOT use cooking wine in this recipe.  The sauce is way too salty and not very good if you do.  I'm going to go ahead and give it four stars, as I think it probably would have been good if I'd used real wine.

One of the best marinara sauces I've had-- and I used to live in Italy!  I followed other's suggestions and added 1 tbsp of brown sugar and some red pepper flakes.  Next time I might add a few drops of Worchestershire sauce just because of personal taste, but this recipe is amazing as it is!  It isn't too often you find Italian food in the US that compares to the original.

Save yourself the trouble - just double the recipe and freeze the leftovers!  Tastes just as good thawed and reheated.   The only alteration I made to this recipe was using dry parsley instead of fresh.  

My husband loved this sauce.  I thought it was on the sweet side (I prefer a tarter red sauce), but hubby said this was just the way he liked his marinara.   Definitely a keeper recipe for us!

Simply amazing. Everyone who has tried this recipe LOVES it! I made some slight modifications: I do not add wine, and added 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, and 2 tsp. Italian herb seasoning. I make it at least once a week!

Just what I was looking for! I have now made this countless times. I let my kids choose their birthday dinner menus and they always choose this sauce.  We add meatballs to it and it's so simple.  If it tastes a bit bitter, I jsut add a little sugar.

This marinara sauce is absolutely delicious.  My husband, and I, as well as my two-year old daughter loved it!  My 4-year old son wasn't a fan, but he doesn't like anything!  The only thing we did different was omit the white wine, and it turned out superb.  This was so easy and just blows away the jar sauces!  Next time I'm going to double the recipe, so I can have some to freeze.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I doubled the recipe and forgot to add the tomato paste, so it was a bit watery - but that was my fault. I added italian sausage and red pepper flakes for spice and some bay leaves to remove some of the bitterness(as suggested). Will definitely make again.

This was a good quick sauce, but it wasn't the best.  Personally I thought it tasted too tomato-ey.  I added brown sugar, fresh parsley, basil, italian seasoning and a bay leaf but nothing helped.  Maybe it was the brand tomatoes I used, but I will most likely not try this again.  Thank you for sharing, I did receive rave reviews on my stuffed shells, I was just personally disappointed in the sauce.

Fantastic! Used dried parsley, sauteed chopped green onion and minced garlic in the olive oil - pulsed everything in blender & cooked in oil-sprayed crockpot on low for 3 hours before serving w/pasta and chicken parm - SO delicious!

I LOVE this recipe!  Thick but not too thick with a fabulous flavor.  I used 1 1/2 tsp. dried parsley, omitted the salt since I was serving it with manicotti (all that cheese has a lot of salt!) added 1 tsp. dried basil based on TNFRENCH's recommendation and about 2 tsp. brown sugar based on TUNISIANSWIFE review.  I used red onion and reduced the olive oil to 3 tbsp (will most likely use even less next time).  Thanks Jackie for a great marinara sauce.

I love this recipes with garlic breadsticks. I am not a fan of spaghetti-like sauces, but this marinara sauce taste excellent, I think the white wine gives it a nice flavor. This recipe is very easy to make and not time consuming at all. Wonderful!!!

I make it in large batches then freeze it so if I'm in a pinch I just have to thaw it in microwave simmer and done. Just as fast as ragu.

I needed a quick red sauce for a pasta side, but didn't have time to make my 'usual' and the thought of using a jarred sauce... well, ick.  As simple as this is, this marinara is quite good, plus I liked whirling everything in the food processor -- great way to sneak in veggies for those who 'pick out the chunks'.  To spice it up, I added a few goodly shakes of red pepper flakes.  Will make again when short on time or when it's too hot to have a sauce on the stove for hours.  Thanks!

When you consider the ease and time of putting this sauce together and the end result, this is an exceptional recipe. Very simple....very flavorful. It will be hard, in the future, to simmer a homemade sauce all day, when you can have something this good in relatively no time at all.

I just stepped away from the dinner table,and, knew I had to comment about this wonderful recipe.  I'm ashamed to admit that I was very skeptical, even after reading some of the reviews, because I have this strange belief that something this easy to make couldn't be "fabulous".  I was wrong!  This is THE recipe I will be using from now on!  Thank you!

1st time attempting homemade sause and it came out great. Like everyone else I added my own touched. Added some hot sausage, used organic crushed tomatoes as opposed to stewed. Halfed the paprike and added an equal amount of basil. No oregano on hand :( so I used italian seasoning. And I added a bit of hot cracked pepper plus doubled up on the garlic. Came out great!  Will make this Sunday for sure.

This recipe was the best.  I used another user's advice and used this recipe for baked ziti 1 and also used it in place of the alfredo sauce in the artichoke and spinach dip restaurant style. oh my what a great combination.  I've made this sauce twice this week. Thanks Jackie

Absolutely delicious! Tastes just like something you'd be served at a restaurant. It has a very sophisticated taste. I used red wine instead of white, and it turned out lovely.

This was tasty, although I made a few modifications...

I added ground beef, red & green peppers ,celery (veggies added within the last 10 min so they stayed crunchy)& I tripled the garlic!  So good!!  

I can't go back to store bought sauce again!

A very nice red sauce. Like most sauces I am sure there are an infinite number of variations that may be made, however I have found the recipe as written is excellent. It also scales very nicely; I have used it for manicotti for as few as 4 people and for chicken parmigiana for as many as 60. This has become my standard red sauce recipe ... thanks!

The recipe itself is delicious, however it is very important to use a high quality stewed tomato.  The first time I made it I used a cheaper brand, and compared with the second time I made it there was a huge difference.  I like my sauce with a bit more garlic so i added a few extra cloves.  Great recipe!

Very good sauce.  I added some brown sugar to counter the tang from the tomatoes & wine.  It did seem like it was missing something, though.  I may add a touch of chili powder or some fresh herbs next time to adjust the flavor.  But it was still very good.

I've tried many other recipes for red sauce and this was by far rhe easiest and most tasty. I loved it. Also, I didn not add any sugar as some previous reviewers cited an acidic taste. If you saute and follow the recipe, you too will love it!

I made this marinara when I recently cooked for a wedding reception of 450. They loved it. Even my husband who usually says a new recipe is "ok", He loved it also and told me that I could make it any time.

A nice tasting sauce.  My kids (who were picky eaters) wouldn't eat it though.  The wine was a nice touch but I'd add a little more sugar to sweeten it the next time.  It looked wonderful and very appealing to the eye.  I'd make it again for myself and freeze the sauce.

I found the amount of wine called for made the sauce quite sour.  The second time I made this I cut the wine down to 1/4 cup and it was somewhat better.  If I make this again I will lessen the wine even more.

Easy and delicious - this is now one of my staple recipes!  I substitute Italian seasoning for the oregano and I dump in more garlic to suit my personal taste.  Red wine is also good in this recipe, and I usually decrease the olive oil to about 4 Tbsp.  I also add about a tablespoon of chili powder for some heat.  I use this recipe about once every two weeks, and everyone loves it!  It also freezes well.  Thank you, Jackie!

Jackie, thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe! I doubled the garlic (love it) added 1 TBS sugar (like it a little sweet). So easy and as good as any Marinara sauce from the finest restaurants. "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" is absolutely appropriate... Many  thanks...

The sauce had a good taste, but was a little thick for me. I didn't add the white wine because we're non drinkers and it seemed like a pain to buy for only a half cup. I cut the recipe in half and still had leftovers after a dinner for 4. But everyone loved how the sauce wasn't chunky, its hard to find a good marinara sauce without huge tomato or onion chunks. I'll make again, with some minor adjustments.

I found this to be only so-so. The taste was extremely tomato-y, didn't give me that Italian marinara flavor I was looking for. However, I didn't have the wine, and I think possibly adding a bit more Italian seasoning, the wine, and letting it refrigerate overnight might make the difference. Will try again.

This was truly the best marinara sauce that I've ever tasted!  I was surprised that the recipe called for white wine (I used a Pinot Grigio) but it was excellent.  The only thing that I changed in the recipe was to add a bit of fresh chopped basil.  I, too, refrigerated it overnight.

Very good! Tastes really authentic. I put the mixture into my blender (don't have a food processor). It worked great as a dip to my toated ravioli and later for cheese sandwiches! You won't be disappointed.

Wonderful, thank you!  I didn't think that the addition of the tomato paste made the final product heavy, just gave it a more complex flavor.  My 3 year old little girl is in a light eating phase, but she chowed down on this.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Jackie's recipe is very aptly named as "Best" Marinara recipe. It's good not just for the fact that it's delicious, but also for the simplicity in preparation and the availability of the ingredients. 

I do think though that adding some seafood flavour will further enhance the recipe. Get a kilogram of raw mussels (still in shell). Scrub and clean them. Put them in a pot and pour the white wine (from the original recipe) into the pot and steam them until shells open.

Remove the mussel meat from the shell and set aside. Strain the cooking liquor (to remove the gritty bits at the bottom). At the end of cooking the tomato sauce, add the cooking liqour and the mussel meat.

Might take a little more time to shell the mussels, but well-worth the extra flavour.

Yummeeee.

This is really good and quick. I added more garlic, but that is a personal preference. A keeper.

I find this to be a nice smooth sauce.  It is my husband's favorite and he's very picky with his pasta sauces.

What a wonderful homemade sauce that takes so little effort to prepare! My food processor is too small, so I just throw everything into the blender and it works great.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I have a friend who used to buy her sauce from a local restaurant until I made this sauce and gave her the recipie.  Wonderfully simple and VERY tastey. The only thing I changed was I added a pinch of sugar. To the previous reviewer though, there is a big difference between cooking with red wine and white.  Stick to the recipe and you can't go wrong!

this sauce is good! I have been searching for a very long time for an easy and tasty sauce and I finally found it. A couple of changes: I added extra garlic and I blended everything--including the minced onion ( I didnt sautee it). I sauteed ground sirloin and then I added the blended sauce with the white wine and let it simmer. It came out so good! From now on this is my standard pasta sauce. Next time I'll try adding basil and bell pepper. I cant wait!

I thought it was just okay.  I guess I am not a huge fan of stewed tomatoes.

i made this a second time with crushed tomatoes.  just tasted like tomato paste.  even worse!

This smelled wonderful while cooking but I could have done without the addition of wine, and I'm a wine lover! Maybe a cabernet would've been better suited for this...I don't know, the chardonnay I used was just a little too overpowering. Otherwise great! I served this over baked ravioli.

I also was very surprised by how much I liked this recipe.  I was a little suspicious of marinara sauce requiring so little time and so few ingredients, but it was very good.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe to use again!

Very good recipe! The hardest part about it was trying to get the cork out of the wine bottle! At another reviewer's suggestion I also used canned crushed tomatoes and I added a small can of no-salt tomato sauce. I used it as a sauce for eggplant parmesan (the recipe is also somewhere on this site) for myself and I reheated it as a dipping sauce for an Italian sausage sandwich with peppers for my boyfriend. I had leftovers, so I made a Bolognese-type sauce out of it for him and added some ground sirloin and more sausage. We both decided that it would be an excellent dipping sauce for mozzarella sticks too. Can't wait to make it again! (and will be researching mozzarella sticks on this site...) Thanks for sharing, Jackie!

I made the sauce to go with the St. Louis Toasted Ravioli and my hubby and I weren't too impressed with it.  I have refrigerated the leftover sauce and plan to use it again with Baked Ravioli (leftover ravioli) to see how it tastes.  Several other reviewers commented that it gets better with age, so we will give it another try.  Thanks for sharing Jackie!

Yum! Very good marinara sauce recipe.  I halved the recipe to make only two cups, and I used one can crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed. I also added fresh basil. It came out great. This is way better than any store bought variety.

This was a good recipe, however not as good as the reviews had stated.  I will make this again, but it wasnt wow.  I added a little more garlic, i like garlic, and a little more onion.  I also added a pinch of sugar.  It tasted a lot better over pasta than by itself.

My family liked this alot.  I added extra garlic.  Next time I may try a dash of red pepper to spice it up.  I served it over penne with fresh grated parmesan on top. Very good, but not something I would make if I wanted to impress someone.

This was quick, easy and delicious.  But it was also very sweet, next time I may try adding a grated carrot to absorb some of the sugars from the tomtatoes.

This was a good recipe.  I didn't have any white wine, so I used red.  As with most sauces, this tastes better the next day.  A nice flavor and it is a thick sauce.  I used this with the chicken parmigiana recipe and it turned out great!!

Great! Made for a fun night of cooking with my boyfriend. We made this sauce with extra portions of garlic, parsley and oregano and used red wine instead of white. Next time I will add in some mushrooms and other veggies. My first successful cooking venture! I normally end up burning the food, myself or anything else within 10 feet of the stove. =) Thanks!

I really enjoyed this sauce, it was fun to make and not difficult like I thought making my own sauce would be. I did vary the recipe a little - more garlic, red pepper flakes, extra pepper, chilli powder and some sugar. Thanks alot for the great recipe, I am making it today for my inlaws 30th anniversay dinner

This was quick and easy, but only needed to simmer about half the time given. Also, I added more garlic and more oregano to pop the flavor.

Had to laugh at the review about people changing the recipe because I thought the same thing.  I followed the recipe as is but......did increase the garlic (my family loves garlic). The recipe was delicious and my family loved it.  My daughter loves to mix alfredo and marina and I found a great recipe for alfredo that I'll post.

I goofed this recipe because I added all ingredients to the food processor. I did not saute the onions so they were a bit "crunchy" Also, I added red wine since I had that on hand.
With these mistakes, it was still great and my two year old and 6 year old had seconds! I will make this again and again. Better than any jar that's for sure and easy too.

This is a delicious sauce, I varied it a bit by adding chopped green bell peppers, mushrooms, asian chili-garlic sauce (adds a little fire to it), and also basil...and it was incredible!

This is the best recipe for marinara yet!  With all of the different seasonings, it had wonderful flavor.  The longer you can cook it, the better!

A great sauce.  It is very easy to make and hardly takes up any time at all.  The only problem, in my opinion, is that it needs a little more taste.  A bite.  Maybe at some cilantro or something to give it a little kick.  Just as Emerial say......we have to KICK IT UP A NOTCH!!!!

Opt for crushed tomatoes, up the garlic to two cloves and add a little more oregano and a little basil. Mix ingredients instead of dirtying the food processor. Very easy, very tasty sauce!

Easy fix when I was out of sauce for lasagna. I left out the wine because I am using it for lasagna and doubt it's needed so can't speak to that part. But even without the wine, it's pretty darn good.

I've only made it once, but it turned out really well! I used a pinot grigio, but I'm sure you could probably use a moscato or something for a sweeter sauce. I am curious if anyone has tried canning it though.

I used what I had on hand (1 can stewed & 1 can diced tomatoes). I cut the wine in half based on other reviews. The flavor was very good but my sauce was a little too thick (I assume because I cut the wine & didn’t replace it with anything). For me this is a “keeper”.

Excellent! Great not only for pasta, but this makes a great dip for breadsticks too. I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed since I don’t have a food processor, and it still have a wonderful consistency. Added about a tsp of brown sugar to cut the tartness. Will definitely make this again!

This is an awesome and very quick and easy recipe that is now my go to and I am chef trained in Italian cooking. The first time I made it I followed it to a T using Hunts tomato paste and got rave reviews from the family when using it in a one pan chicken Parmesan recipe from Food.com. It has a fresh and not over cooked taste. I made it a second time using Cento paste and it was bitter so I'm back to Hunts, using the stewed tomatoes and little more garlic than called for but otherwise no changes.  Dry white wine is the key as red wine tends to make sauce bitter as well.  This recipe is a  keeper and I have given it to several friends who also rave about it too,     thanks!!

I used fire roasted crushed tomatoes in a 28 oz can, 4 cloves of garlic and added a dash of each: marjoram, basil, sage and summer savory. I then added a pound of browned mild Italian sausage and let it simmer for a few hours. This was so incredibly yummy!!! Definitely my new baked ziti sauce from now on! Thank you for an awesome guide to a phenomenal sauce!

Used this recipe  bc I had the pasta all made and realized I had no sauce.  I didn't have the wine or tomato paste so left those out.  Added a jar of roasted red peppers.  Next time would use less salt.  Will use this recipe again and maybe try some other variations.

This is delicious!   No added sugar at all.  The second time I made it I didn't have stewed tomatoes, I had crushed tomatoes so I used those and it was equally delicious.

Great marinara sauce.  Very tasty.  I used it as a pizza sauce for my homemade pizza.   Was perfect.

I used a half can of Rotele (spicy) tomatoes just because I needed to use them up. At the end I added a good teaspoon of Garlic salt.  Also instead of parsley I used Cilantro because its what I had.  This sauce had amazing flavor.  Served it over Steamed broccoli and Cauliflower and also spiral pasta as sides with pork .      So delicious !

Hubby loved it, even though he’s not a canned tomato fan! I did add fresh oregano and topped it with fresh basil. The only real change I made was using red wine instead of white.

Oh my! I love this recipe! I teach foods and this recipe is on of my kids favorites! Super simple and freezes well! I don’t use very much oil, just enough to sauté the onions in and substitute chicken stock for the wine.

This sauce is terrific. I have made it several times since I first discovered it. The only thing I changed was chicken broth instead of white wine since I don't cook with alcohol.

Delicious! I tweak it to suit my tastes a little differently every time (adding red chili flakes for heat, red vs white wine, no wine, different combinations of herbs, adding cooked mushrooms, adding basil leaves, adding meat) Whatever I add or don't add its still great! As per an earlier comment I tend to use crushed tomatoes and skip the food processor. Less dishes amirite? :D

Amazing & so super easy!!!  I follow the directions & put all of the ingredients in my pot after I’ve sautéed onions and use a hand blender-thingy to emulsify everything. Make sure to leave it a little chunky!  No need to wash a food processor if you don’t have to. One important addition is the 1 tbsp of brown sugar as others have recommended & it’s wonderfully delicious!!  I double recipe because it’s that good!

Awesome! I used a can of crushed tomatoes & skipped the food processor but followed exactly otherwise. Hands down my favorite sauce that I’ve ever had (and I got to be the one to make it!!). My family loved it & this is the recipe that will be used from now on. Thank you!!

I LOVED this!! Did up the garlic a bit (just a taste preference) and used dried parsley instead of fresh (all I had on hand) but it was phenomenal! Doubled the recipe, made a day ahead and used with meatballs and pasta one night and zucchini ravioli the next AND wad able to freeze two large jars!! This is a keeper!

Yes only change is I buy overripe tomatoes cheap at local produce market....added rest of stuff as usual but would never use cans of tomatoes as fresh tomatoes are the only way to go. No acid taste. I just put tomatoes in my Ninja along with the basil & oregano blend it all up...I also add lots more garlic, fresh cloves only. The sauce freezes very well as I make a big batch to freeze some for later

I’ve made this a bunch and the family loves it. I generally quadruple the recipe and also add 2 Tbs basil and a couple pinches of sugar. I’ve used it for spaghetti sauce and added vegetables and meat, and as a base for chicken Parmesan and lasagna. It is easy and always turns out fantastic. I do tend to simmer it longer.

I loved this recipe, I did make a few changes though , only because I just wanted to use what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe because I had a 12 oz. can of tomatoes paste, 2  14.5  cans diced tomatoes with basil , oregano and garlic, 1  14.5 oz. Can Italian stewed tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic and 1. 14.5  oz. Can diced tomatoes. I don't have a blender so I sauted the onion in olive oil, used a garlic press  and added that with the tomatoes and spices. I had to eliminate the black pepper because my husband can't have black pepper, so I added dried basil, then used an immersion blender to mix everything , then added the wine and let it simmer for about an hour. Meanwhile I breaded chicken breast in Italian bread crumbs, quick browned it in olive oil, put some of the sauce in the bottom of a casserole dish , put the browned chicken in a single layer , more sauce then fresh mozzarella on top and some shredded parmesan, and baked it till bubbly. Since I had extra sauce I also made angle hair pasta on the side. My husband went back for seconds . I will make this again !

Excellent sauce! I like that it's easy, but it seems like it would be forgiving  if your ingredients aren't exactly the same.

The oil called for is entirely too much, making this recipe one great glob of olive oil. Adding white wine - an acidic liquid - to the acid of tomatoes, makes this recipe altogether too biting. No amount of sugar can counter this. I will search for any other recipe which doesn't call for 1/3 cup of olive oil plus 1/2 cup of white wine with a mere 29 oz of stewed tomatoes. Wretched, unctuous, acidic taste.

Just made this tonight and it is fantastic. We made some alterations though. instead of plain stewed tomatoes we got the Italian stewed tomatoes and didn't add the oregano since it was already in there. We also didn't add salt and pepper because it also was in the stewed tomatoes. We took one of the suggestions of one reviewer and added one to of brown sugar to cut the bitterness. Hands down this will be a regular recipe and may end up becoming our go-to red sauce for spaghetti, pizza, lasagna and marinara. This is a perfect base for all of the previous mentioned dishes.

Thank you for this extremely quick, cheater way to get the flavor of an all-day simmer in no time!   As another reviewer put it, the stewed tomatos are key because they have already been simmering.   I threw some turkey meatballs in and let them heat up while the sauce was cooking.  My kids loved this!  The consistency was perfect also.

Loved it!  First time made as stated.  Last time used what I had on hand.  Used crushed tomatoes, chicken broth in place of the wine , more garlic & onions & added a little basil at the end for sweetness.  Didn’t have fresh parsley so used jarred.  Great every time!

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I used San Marzano crushed tomatoes and blended those with some fresh herbs- parsley, oregano and basil.  I doubled all ingredients for a large party.  I sautéed the onion, then added some minced garlic.  Once I had all ingredients in the pot, I added a tsp of brown sugar to reduce the acidity from the wine.  I simmered for 30 min and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The next day, I put the sauce in the crockpot and warmed it up that way.  It was a hit at my dinner party.  I think it would be good with maybe some fresh mushrooms added too.

Just made it for the first time and it turned out really good. Few Changes I made are: I added 1 tbsp brown Sugar, didn’t add any additional salt and used chicken broth instead of wine. Tastes awesome and even my picky kids loved it

Very good. Much better than any of the recipes I've tried that were "written" by famous chefs.    Flavor is excellent, spice levels are spot on,  consistency is  perfect.  Will make it again.  I used it for an eggplant lasagna...but that's another review  :-) 
ETA: Use the best olive oil you can find.

Very good!  I used less olive oil because six tablespoons was too much and  I substituted chicken broth for the white wine Also next time I'll add a bit of sugar to cut the acidity.

This is the BEST marinara ever!  I don't like the store-bought versions because they are just too sweet, or bland, or tomato-ey (is that a word?  lol).  Anyway, I cooked this as written except I used chicken broth instead of wine, and  doubled it.  I am SO glad I did!  I froze it in 3+-cup portions to be almost equivalent to a jar in the store.  I LOVE this!  Thank you so much for sharing.  It is not too sweet or bland or tomato-ey at all!  It put my chicken parm over the top!

Did hot have a food processor or blender on hand (post-college life), but it still managed to turn out really good! I used an electric hand mixer to mix it up the best I could.

I whip this together for making pizzas.  Absolutely delicious.  I do add another T chopped garlic, turmeric (since I already have the required pepper and oil that it needs to be effective) and I just cut the onions to put on the pizza. I use about 3 T brown sugar to cut the acidity.

I needed a fast sauce for a recipe that called for marinara and found this. I used chunky tomates with oregano, basil and garlic (but added more of each), and Orvieto white wine. It was exactly what I needed and super fast; by the time it was done, everything was prepped for the rest of my recipe!

This sauce is excellent for pizza.  It has a depth to it that is reminiscent of my favorite Italian restaurants (thanks to the wine and spices).  I was able to make a Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza with this.  The first time I did the sauce as is - and it was perfect.  However, after I baked it on the pizza, it tasted different.  The second time, I decided to add a teaspoon of sugar and simmer only 10 min; then I baked it on the pizza in oven.  It was great and definitely a keeper.

Thought I would try this recipe against my better judgement. It was, as expected, awful!!! What about using fresh tomatoes, they aren't rare or cost prohibitive.

This is excellent! The only changes are using diced tomatoes instead of stewed and adding 1T of maple syrup. If you own a high speed blender use the soup setting and you're done.

THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!! I read the reviews and the only thing i did different is add 2 garlic cloves instead of one and only used 1/3 cup white wine. And I didn't have a food processor so i just used my nutrabullet.  It was easy, quick to make and i had some leftover so i'm freezing it for next time. Soooo much better than the store bought ones! Thank You

Modified the recipe a bit.  Used crushed tomatoes and added italian hot sausage cooked with garlic, onions and bell peppers, added a splash of white wine.  Hubby says it was better than Costco's and only took 20 min to make

It’s great - but I’m really leaving this review bc I do not understand why people write reviews that include their ten modifications they made.  That’s not reviewing the recipe - that’s reviewing your own recipe.

I was very excited to make this and was expecting something amazing. I don’t understand the hype. It had a bit of a sour aftertaste, maybe from the tomatoes although I bought the kind specified. It was just ok. I’ll keep looking for a better recipe.

This has been my go to Marinara sauce recipe for a while now, pretty easy to put together for a fresh pasta dinner. Will never buy the jar stuff again! I have made a few adjustments along the way to account for kids taste buds, we love garlic so I added a few cloves and brown sugar as others have mentioned. I make this as a meat sauce or with meatballs as well. I usually make double the recipe and freeze it for next weeks pasta night and the flavor is still really good, Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious and very easy and quick. I did not use
the food processor.   I started with the onion in the olive oil, add the garlic and spices and then stirred in the paste, crushed tomatoes and wine.  I like only one pot.  I was a little hesitant about the white wine but it adds a nice rich flavor to the sauce.  Definitely my go-to instead of a jar.

Great sauce as written. Omitted onion as wife doesn't like them but I'm sure it would've added some depth to the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm giving this a 4 star because I didn't actually follow the recipe exactly. I followed a reviewers suggestion of using crushed tomatoes instead of diced and then pureeing. Also substituted chicken broth for the wine.  The sauce turned out really thick and I had to dilute it several times while simmering with more chicken stock. I really didn't care for it at all.  So not wanting to punish to the recipe writer for my not sticking to the directions as written. I will try this again at some point without changing anything and update my review.

This was my first attempt at making homemade marinara sauce and it turned out great! Even the kids loved it. :)

I'm not sure how to add notes that I can see next time so I'm putting them here.  I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth and used 3 T of olive oil instead of 6.      

I blended the stewed tomatoes in my small ninja blender and added the parsley and chopped onion right to the blender.  I didn't bother sauteing the onion, next time I'll try that. 

I made this early in the day for supper so after I mixed everything together I put it in my small crockpot on low.   Later I made the Meatball Nirvana recipe and added half of those to this marinara sauce for meatball subs.

This recipe was a 3-4-star rating as written; however, the following changes upgrades recipe to 5-star. In addition to the ingredients already stated use:  (1) in lieu of Stewed Tomatoes, use Hunts(R) Oregano & Basil Diced Tomatoes, undrained (2) Add 1 tsp dried Basil, (3) Add 1 tsp Brown Sugar, (4) Add 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, (5) Add 1 Bay Leaf, (6) Add 1 tsp Morton(R) Garlic Sea Salt.  Directions:  Simmer onions in olive oil until softened.  Add all ingredients, bring to a boil, and then simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove Bay Leaf and then use Immersion Blender to blend all ingredients for a lovely smooth, thickened texture.  Immersion blender is a must.  Very versatile recipe.  For a cream sauce, add 1/4 cup Half and Half(R) before using Immersion Blender.  There are better recipes, but this one is easy and will do well in a pinch.

This is fantastic!! I'm on a sodium restricted diet and I used no-salt stewed tomatoes and added just 1/2 tsp of salt to the sauce.

My family liked this but I wasn't sold on it as written.  I felt the amount of olive oil was way too high and the amount of onion and garlic seemed too low.  This recipe is very much designed for kids, the flavor is very mild.  I will definitely make this again but tweak to my taste (which I guess makes it a different recipe).  I will cut the olive oil in half, increase the onion, garlic, and seasonings, and I think I will try to adjust the wine, try different kinds of wine, or replace it with something else.  I agreed with some others that the wine taste was too strong.  I simmered for quite a while to cook off the wine, but that concentrated the sauce a little too much.  I also used my immersion blender rather than blending in a food processor to save cleaning the processor.

I made this in the Instapot. Modified 3-4 cloves garlic, added 1 tps of brown sugar as recommended by other posts, reduced wine to only 1/3 cup. I also added a bay leaf. I set it on the Manual Setting 10 min, but it was a little bit burnt on the bottom, so I would say 8 min would have been enough. Added a dash of cayenne pepper at the end. Gives it kick without changing the flavor. Great recipe!

I made this just as the recipe stated  I fed this to 4 boys, none of them thought it was great and I didn't care for it either....definitely missing something, I just don't know what and if I figured it out it would then not be this recipe and I couldn't rate it as this recipe. Moving on to another marinara that will hopefully be better.

This was my first attempt at homemade marinara sauce, and it turned out great. I didn't have any white wine, so I left that out, then added twice the recommended garlic and a pound of sauteed seasoned ground beef. Best spaghetti we've had so far.  The only problem was the quoted serving size. I halved it, thinking 8 servings would be plenty for my small family, but it only made 4 servings at best. Be sure to make the whole batch for a decent sized meal. Thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent recipe! Absolutely delicious, my whole family loves it. I usually make this twice a month. I substitute with crushed tomatoes so that I don’t need to blend it. Moscato wine is best!

I had homegrown tomatoes so subbed for stewed, added a heaping tsp of ground fennel, "stumped my toe" on the oregano, added about 1 1/2c of frozen spinach, placed in slow cooker for 6 hours on low. I used this as my marinara base for Chef John's Eggplant Parm and OHHH MMMM GEEEE!!!! This was the MOST authentic Italian style dish I've ever made!! Awesome and will be using over and over and over!

Delicious!  I used sangria wine and added fresh basil after taking off the heat.  I removed the basil about 10 minutes later so it wouldn't overpower the sauce.  I made this in the morning and let it set in the refrigerator until dinner so the flavors would set in.  I was very impressed with this sauce.  I have never made a marinara before.

I've made this marinara sauce twice now, and each time it's been delicious. I made it first to go with meatballs, and then used it as the tomato base on homemade pizzas. I added a few touches of my own - balsamic vinegar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and some basil leaves, as I always add these when making a tomato pasta sauce to boost the flavour. I've now added this to my own recipe book at home so I can fall back on it again and again.

This sauce has so much flavor.  The wine just added more great flavors & the aromas were just  divine.   I tweeked  it by sautéing the mushrooms with the onions, and  added Italian sausage to the sauce.  Lastly, I added 2 teaspoons of coconut sugar.   This marinara is a hit every time., and it is easy too.  I have made it many times.  Definitely a keeper.

Very Good! I will double it next time. I did  just 3 T of oil, used 1 heaping T dried parsley because I forgot to get fresh, added around a Tablespoon of white sugar and I few shakes of Italian seasoning. I didn't think there was a strong wine taste. I used Barefoot Pinot Grigio.  The stewed tomatoes give it a great flavor and sauciness.

Perfect consistency and really raises any Italian dinner to a superior level. I use chicken stock rather than wine and am very heavy handed with fresh herbs when I make it (basil, cilantro and Italian parsley). It also freezes well. This has been my go to marinara for many years now. I have a big family so I double it.

I tasted this after it was done and it is very good. I might want to add red pepper flakes to give it a bit more zing. I made a double batch. Half will be used with meatballs. The other half will be used later for a baked pasta casserole.

I've made this recipe several times already.  I added a little crushed red pepper to the cheese filling to give it a little additional flavor.  Otherwise, my family loved them.

This sauce is the bomb.  I use it on homemade ravioli and it is incredible.  Quick note, do not simmer more than 30 minutes.  Uses a little of the wine bite.  30 is perfect!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Nice sauce - used a tbsp of brown sugar as one reviewer suggested and also added a bay leaf.  Also didn't have fresh parsley so used a heaping tbsp of dried parsley - worked fine.   My husband loved this sauce!

WOW! This so good and so very simple. I rarely use pasta sauce in a jar, after finding this recipe I doubt I will ever buy it in the jar again. I made 2 minor changes, I added 1 TBSP of brown sugar, like others suggested and I used chicken broth instead of wine.

We absolutely love this sauce!  We use it for pizza and for pasta.  Ours varies with the ingredients we have in the house.  We use dried parsley, less oil, either onion soup mix or onion powder as we don't normally have fresh onion, and haven't used wine yet (simply because we don't have any in the house) and it turns out great!  It's the first marinara that the whole family loves!

Delicious and so easy! I did add some brown sugar per the recommendation of other reviewers. I like the flavor of the wine in there, but it wasn't too much for the kids. I served it over spaghetti with meatballs.  I think I might make it in a double batch next time and freeze half because it is so much etter than store bought!

Really great sauce- stuck at home during a snowstorm craving pasta and this wonderful sauce filled the bill! I improvised a few items I didn't have- used Italian seasoning instead of parsley, red wine vs white, extra garlic and some sugar to sweeten a tad. So good!

Love this sauce!  Tastes homemade.  Serve with Chef John's meatballs regularly.  Hubby tells everyone the sauce is his aunts' recipe -- which he says is the only sauce he'll eat.  Glad he doesn't read these reviews...

I give this 3 stars because the directions are different than the ingredients, i.e. Italian tomatoes instead of Stewed, and Tomato sauce instead of paste.  There's a huge different between sauce and paste, especially.  I used paste and the pasta sauce was too acidic.   When using paste there should be some addition of water, and I didn't put enough water in the recipe.

I have never been a spaghetti fan, but when making it with this sauce, it transforms it into a dish that I look forward to.  It's quite simple to make, too.  My husband is also a fan.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, only scaled it down because I didn't need that much.  I don't measure anything but pretty sure I used extra garlic.  I'll definitely make this again!

Super flavorful sauce, no crazy ingredients or complicated instructions. I skipped saute onion step and grated them into the sauce. I added 2 tbsp. Brown sugar as suggested and simmered in the crock pot. Everybody loved it. Thanks!

Amazing sauce. I added an extra 2 cloves of garlic. One to the initial purée and one to the veggie sauté. I also included a green bell pepper with the onion and garlic. I incorporated ground beef cooked with salt pepper and red pepper flake to make a delicious meat sauce. I feel like the red pepper flake was a great choice as it leaves just the slightest bit of spice on your tongue as you eat. Served it with spaghetti and garnished with fresh grated parmesan and  a leaf of fresh parsley.

Delicious!! Changes I made (I reduced the count to 4 servings): 1) Used canned, diced tomatoes; 2) Didn't use a food processor, I like it chunky; 3) Added 1 tbsp fresh chopped basil; 4) Added 2 tsp sugar; 5) Added 2-3 tbsp chopped fresh mushrooms (that I sautéed with the onions). Superb.

Super yummy!! I have bought many brands of marinara sauce and have not found a single one that I overly like so I decided to try making my own and I absolutely loved this recipe. I did add some basil, crushed red pepper and 1/4 cup of white grape juice (instead of white wine) to make it more to my liking. I will never buy another jar of marinara sauce again.

Really good easy recipe. I did use a can of San Marzano tomatoes instead of stewed. I use them for all of my red sauces. And I put a bunch of parmesan cheese in at the end. It makes the perfect amount for 1 meal and the consistency is perfect. Thank you!

This is sooo good! I made a couple modifications.!I doubled the garlic and added a tbsp of brown sugar. I used canned diced tomatoes (organic ones from Costco) and didn't use the blender. I just squished the tomatoes with my hand as I poured them out of the can. Sooo good! I made a quadruple batch last time and froze the extra in gallon freezer bags (portioned so I could defrost for two dinners). Oh, and I also sautéed the chopped garlic with the onions and olive oil. I waited till the onions were almost done cooking before I added the garlic. That way the garlic didn't burn.

This was my first time making sauce and I have to say this was a good one to start with. Everyone enjoyed it just as the recipe says with no changes made.  This is a new go to for sure. No more jars of sauce for my family.

Delicious!!  I used home grown tomatoes (vac packed, frozen), added 1 Tablespoon fresh Basil, used Italian seasoning without oregano (instead of oregano, wife is allergic), and didn't add the wine (forgot, I blame the red wine I was drinking while cooking).  Additionally,  I added  3 links of Italian sausage (cooked, sliced thin) to the sauted onions and then added a little bit of garlic and onion powder while it was simmering.  I won't be buying marinara from the store anymore.

Really easy to make.  I substituted chicken broth for the white wine and crushed tomatoes (didn't have to puree) per another reviewer.  I didn't have any fresh parsley so I substituted 2 TBSP dried parsley.  I also added 1 tsp white sugar.  It was delicious.

In terms of ease this certainly met the objective.  It's great how it does not require a tremendous amount of ingredients.  We also added some fresh basil and Sweet Italian sausage during the simmering phase.  The sausage seemed to complement well the sauce consistency.  All in all this is a solid sauce.

This is without a doubt the most delicious  marinara sauce ever.  It makes a lot and can either be used right away or frozen. I love that it is easy to have all ingredients on hand so it can be whipped up in a moments notice. We have had it several times now and always amazed at how delicious it makes everything! Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and tasty.  My new favorite way to make marinara.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so used a 28oz can of whole peeled plum tomatoes.  Still delicious!

Loved this sauce!  A few notes:  I used diced tomatoes and my Braun hand blender so no food processor needed. I also used a white Marsala cooking wine and 3 garlic cloves (I halfed the recipe in case it was a no go) and I thought the amount of garlic was perfect.  I also added fresh AND dried basil. I may add fresh bell pepper and mushrooms next  time. My husband asked me to make it from now on!

Amazingly good!  I doubled it and am very glad I did.  I sautéed the onions then added all the other ingredients to the pot and just used a hand mixer to blend.  I did add some red pepper flakes and 1 T brown sugar and cut the olive oil down a lot.  Found myself eating it out of the pot!  Great on pasta too!  So glad to have a healthier alternative to jarred sauces!

I made this as directed but left out the wine, oil, and tomato paste (didn't have any)- I used 1 quart of my stewed tomatoes, chopped up. I skipped the food processer step and my sauce was a bit chunkier rather than smooth.  I added some red pepper flakes for zing.  I also added 1 heaping teaspoon of horseradish when it was cooled. I would cut back on the salt next time to half. I served it as a dipping sauce with breaded calamari and it was perfect! My quart of tomatoes after being cooked for about 30 minutes with the other ingredients was reduced to a pint of sauce.

I left out the wine and just drank a red wine instead. This was an excellent marinara and  definitely will be my go to recipe from now on.  We served this over steamed cauliflower - suprised me how increadibly tasty this was.  I used one can of No Salt tomatos and one regular can to reduce the sodium.  My husband added salt to his serving, but it was perfect for me.

This sauce is great! I made my own turkey meatballs the first time. The second time I added browned ground turkey. I added an extra can of stewed tomatoes. It is important the type of wine you choose because it definitely makes the flavor. I used a nice white Pinot Gris and my family loved it both times! I have saved this recipe and passed it on to my daughter.

I made this last night, and I have to say it was one of the best sauces that I have made in years.  No more store bought sauces for us. This was very easy and you can double or triple and freeze.  I followed this recipe exact and it came out excellent.  My hubby loved it.

A good starting place. Probably a three star, but   I like vegies and added  what I had.   I sauted onion, garlic, green pepper, and mushrooms. Lots of mushrooms.  Then I chopped and added six  leftover slices of cooked bacon, a can of diced tomatoes as I had no fresh, and a generous amount of basil, oregano, and paprika.  Mixed in  into some hot rotini and enjoyed  the result along with a salad.  It was a light and tasty dish. Great for summer fare.  Tonight  being the third night,  I will dice and saute some cherry tomatoes and more onion to moisten the left overs up.

I added dried basil and did 2 large cloves of garlic cause I like a lot of garlic. Also felt like it need a tiny bit more salt. But over all I loved the thickness of the sauce and the  wine was a perfect add except I used red wine and it was delicious.

Instead of stewed tomatoes  used CRUSHED tomatoes... no need for the food processor. I sauteed the onions w/4 large cloves of minced garlic & added 1 Tbsp. of fresh chopped basil "in the tube", used 1 Tbsp. of dried parsley instead of fresh, added 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoe, a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper( @1/4 to 1/2 tsp). Omitted the wine. Usually make this w/meatballs; after forming the & browning the meatballs on all sides in a saute pan w/vegetable oil, Take them out out using a slotted spoon &  throw them into the sauce, where they finish cooking while the sauce is simmering. Adds a lot of flavor to the sauce. This is great over angel hair pasta & chicken Parmesan!  - FAMILY FAVORITE!

It was very good, everyone liked it. I made a couple small changes due to some reviews that said it was too bitter: added 1 tsp sugar, decreased the white wine to 1/4 cup. I will definitely make this again!

This sauce is very good and easy. I've made it 3 times.  The first time I only had 1/2 the tomato paste and thought it was better than exactly as written.  Third time I used whole Italian tomatoes and just barely pulsed in blender so it would be more chunky. Perfect for dipping cheese sticks or calzone.

I love this sauce.  I made a few modifications. I added a tablespoon of coconut sugar, half of a carrot, half of a Zucchini, 2 cloves of garlic and a small piece of green bell pepper.  I also put  a splash of the  white wine . 
I put everything in the slow cooker and the following day I  blended it and poured it over cooked ground beef.
Delicious!

I agree with another reviewer about using brown sugar to cut the acid. Also, making this in a large batch and letting the flavors meld together is a great idea. Simple ingredients that most of us have on hand. I did use crushed tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. Wonderful sauce!!

I didn't like that I was supposed to simmer this for so long. I multiplied the recipe by four, but I did not have a good pot to fit it all in. So, the pot I used was overflowing. Once the simmering got going, it looked like a homicide crime scene in my kitchen.

I would recommend changing the recipe to putting a lid on the marinara while it simmers. And, you can throw some zucchini, broccoli, and spinach in there.

This was my first ever time making homemade pasta sauce, and I have to say I'm hooked!  I did like the simplicity of this recipe, but I felt it was missing something.  I will say that I didn't have fresh parsley, so I had to sub parsley flakes.  I also didn't have white wine on hand, so I subbed chicken broth.  I found the sauce to be a bit acidic, so I added a few teaspoons of brown sugar, which really seemed to help.  Overall, it's a very good recipe, and I think tweaking the spices a little will make it even better!

I added a T of brown sugar as some suggested to offset the acidity but it still was a little bitter to me so maybe I would add a little more sugar next time. Worth repeating.

The finished product was a five, but I had to make a few changes to get it that way.  I used red instead of white win (that's what I had and I didn't factor that into my rating).  For my taste it needed more garlic, I used three cloves.  It had too much salt, I needed to add more tomatoes to fix that.  And it did need about a tablespoon of brown sugar.

Otherwise it is amazing and I will be making this again!

I added additional garlic. A second clove and then a teaspoon of powder. Also had to add additional salt. With those additions this was very, very good. I had never made marinara before, but I will probably be making more!

I grew up with my Italian mother making everything from scratch, that said, I was looking for a quick pasta sauce as a base sauce (or gravy as my mom called it).    I wanted a vegetarian version.  I used organic crushed and whole tomatoes.  In place of wine I used vegetable stock, added a tbl sugar and 1 tbl of pesto sauce stirring in at the end.  Use jar or homemade, it really bumps up the flavor!

This is my "Go To" marinara sauce!  I have made it several times.  I usually add mushrooms too.  I'll sometimes spice it up with chili flakes and/or paprika but it does not need anything else.  Great recipe!!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best sauce I've made! I've already made it twice. I let the sauce boil for about an hour so it's nice and reduced. I did add 1 tsp of brown sugar to reduce the acidic bite of the sauce.

This marinara is very good.. I do tweak it a bit though. I usually add a pinch of red pepper flakes or chopped green olives, and nearly double the garlic... we like garlic. Also, I tend to use dried parsley as I rarely have fresh basil on hand. I typically brown a package of ground turkey, and the sauce volume is perfect to throw them together. I simmer on low for an hour or so, and it turns out great! Makes yummy left-overs too.

Over the top, delicious and easy to make!  I might cut back just a bit on the 6 tablespoons of olive oil, but still a great recipe!  I added about 1/2 of a Serrano pepper to give it just a bit of added spice.  I will most definitely be using this recipe again.

I'm Italian but I've never mastered the perfect marinara sauce. THIS IS IT. Bottom line - hands down - the best I've ever made. I used FRESH tomatoes though; dried oregano and parsley (4 tsps of each) and 2.5 tsps of fresh minced garlic from a jar; and white wine for cooking (not drinking). It simmered for less 10 minutes in a cast iron skillet before sampling it and it WAS OFF THE CHART delicious. I'm stuck and will never make any other....!

This is a great base for anything that needs a tomato base.  I tweek it and always add more olive oil to make it rich and delish.

My wife and I love this sauce.  I have found that we prefer to use red wines instead of White. A pinot noir when in the mood for a slightly sweet sauce, or a bold Cabernet sauvignon when in the mood for spicy.  This sauce also makes a great pizza sauce.

delicious! I totally loved it. I used it in chicken parm and it was perfect. I added a few more cloves of garlic (4 cloves) and I reduced the wine by 1/4 cup. I also sautéed the garlic together with the onion. towards the end, I added about 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar to counteract the slight acidity of the tomatoes. I'm thinking I'll be using this again for my meatball recipe.

I don't rate many recipes but this one I had to!  Great sauce, great flavor, color etc.  The only thing I did differently was add another clove of garlic and a few shakes of garlic powder onion powder.

Perfect! I used for a catering gig. I did some things out of order. I sautéed onion, carrots, and celery, then added Campari tomatoes till soft, then tomato paste, then the wine. I then followed every step, except I added more garlic and some basil. Slow simmered for an hour or so.

INCREDIBLE! I pretty much followed the recipe to a t, but I threw in extra garlic because that's always a good idea. I've always kind of made up my own recipe for marinara before, and it was as good or better than anything I'd had before so I figured I'd done a pretty good job. But THIS recipe... my husband and I couldn't stop eating this out of the pan. It will definitely replace my old recipe.

First time making Marinara Sauce. This Recipe was very easy. I do not use wine, so I used Apple Juice as a substitute. It was better than store bought Marinara. I liked it, but it wasn't over the Top. Would I make it again? Not sure.

Here goes peeps, This is the best Marinara Sauce on this site. The only thing I did not put in was the Wine. I didn't have any and so many others said it was great without it, so I trusted them and made it. I also will never eat store bought again. I might even try with Wine the next time. Thank you for the recipe Sweetie.

This sauce turned out really yummy!  I am going to double the recipe next time though, because there wasn't much left for left-overs.  I added a tablespoon of sugar, and used a good red wine instead of white.  I also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1.  I will definitely make this again!

Love this recipe. I tripled the amount of garlic (3 cloves), substituted 3 tbsp. of Mirin (sweet rice cooking wine), and added 1 tsp of oregano and 2 tbsp of turbinado sugar. 

I also reduced the heat to low after adding the sauce and Mirin, and cooked it for 1 hour uncovered, and added 1/2 pound browned hamburger during the last 15 minutes. This came out pretty awesome.

First time I made home-made sauce and will never go back to the jar!
Stuck with the recipe EXACTLY.  Was very easy and very tasty.  Whole family loved it. Shoot, I did get nervous and added 1 tbl of brown sugar since 90% of reviewers did.  Sorry!

Great sauce. Husband loved it and he hates every jarred sauce I've tried. Will only be able to use this sauce now for any pasta dishes. I did use diced tomatoes and added extra garlic. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar as recommended by other reviewers and omitted the white wine. Fresh parsley makes a big difference. Used my bullet to blend everything after it cooked. Fantastic!

Great sauce base!! I read some of the other reviews and added more garlic (3 cloves total but 4 would be even better) sautéing it with the onion. I deglazed the onion garlic mixture with 1/2 cup sweet vermouth instead of white wine - this is a trick my mother in law taught me to remove some of the acidity of the tomatoes. I cooked the vermouth down a bit to remove some of alcohol and added dried oregano and basil to the sauce simmering it covered for 2 hours. We used Nikki Dinki's YouTube fresh pasta recipe and it turned out great! I added some heavy cream to a smaller pan of the sauce and cooked it a bit longer and my husband had the straight up sauce on his. We'lol definitely make this again,,

This is the closest red sauce I have found that matches an amazing red sauce I had in Florence Italy a few months ago. I think the next time I make it I will use fresh tomatoes. Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing!

It is a perfect sauce to tweak to your own liking, but it stands by itself. Very fresh tasting sauce. I added several large leaves of fresh basil into the blender the second.time I made it. I'm also going to try roasting the garlic and perhas some roasted red peppers would be nice. Very good sauce!

Amazing that this sauce tastes so good and is so easy to make!  I added brown sugar because we prefer our sauce a little sweeter, but besides that I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Definitely a keeper!

Made this with tomatoes from my garden, so first I made them into stewed tomatoes using "Italian Stewed Tomatoes" recipe from this site.  It's WONDERFUL!  Then I ran out and made some with store bought stewed tomatoes and it was icky comparatively speaking.

I love this recipe. I used extra garlic and freeze dried parsley because that's all I had in the house.  I browned ground beef mixed with onion and garlic and added the sauce to simmer for 45 mins.  I added some extra water at the end be usage it was a bit thick for us.  I've made it without meat too but my hubby loves meat sauce.  This is a great sauce to make on a weekend.  It's fast and easy!  I highly recommend for everyone.  In the photo attached I'm still cooking but it already tasted delicious!!!

I'm never buying jarred sauce again!!!  I prepared the recipe just as stated except I added some sugar since the cheap white cooking wine I used made it slightly on the tart side.  It balanced the flavor perfectly.  This sauce is d-licious!  I'm definitely doubling or tripling the recipe next time and will freeze it.

Super!  Making with fresh herbs and tomatoes out of the garden I have peeled, chopped, and boiled down.  Plan on canning this over and over with a few changes.  I added 1 T worshishire sauce and omitted wine (I live in a dry county) and onion.  Smells and tastes yummy.

Delicioso! I made this for an eggplant parm recipe and it turned out PERFECT. I made the recipe as directed, except I added some fresh basil instead of the parsley. The consistency is excellent, not too thin or thick. This made enough for probably three batches of eggplant so I now have leftover for spaghetti!

Great recipe, thanks!

No. I should have turned away when I saw stewed tomatoes and tomato paste, white wine, black pepper, onion and only 1 glove of garlic. This recipe was just a mess!

Used this for cauliflower pizza crust and it was amazing!!! I didn't used the whole 6 tablespoons for sautéing the onion; I only used 3 and it was fine. Next time I make this I'll add some brown sugar to take down the acidity and maybe add a little basil :-) It's perfect

Very good, but I used red instead of white wine, added basil and a wee bit of red pepper flakes to spice it up a little.

This was spot on! I used crushed tomatoes instead an the consistency was perfect. I used abt 3 cloves of garlic as I love the flavor and I didnt have any white wine on hand, so i used chicken broth. I also used abt 2 tbsp of brown sugar to help with the acidity. This was perfect for my chicken parmigiana and as a dipping sauce for my fried mac and cheese and fried mozzarella sticks. Will definitely make this again. Thank you!!

I love this sauce- even my meat eating friends say it is superior to theirs! I use crushed tomatoes instead of stewed as those have corn syrup in them. This eliminates the need to bust out the food processor as well. I use vermouth as I never have white wine around and add a shredded carrot to help with acidity.

I also jack up the garlic and cut the oil in half.

This is my new go-to marinara sauce! So much tastier than the jarred stuff, and I know what is in it. Used it last week in my zucchini lasagna and will be using it tomorrow for eggplant florentini. I did substitute chicken broth for the wine and added a few extra cloves of garlic (we love garlic). I'm gonna make a triple batch tomorrow and freeze some for those busy nights. Thanks for such a simple, tasty recipe!

This was the BEST and easiest sauce I have ever made. I added some pesto and used flat gingerale instead of white wine and was super impressed. Thank you for this awesome recipe! I will use it forever.

This is really good! We used it on a Beef "Wellington" recipe I found on All Recipes. It was a great compliment. Then the next day we used it on our homemade pizza. I pretty much followed the recipe as is.

Absolutely fabulous!!! And so easy to make. Try it and you will never buy store bought sauce again and it freezes well for a quick easy meal. A few changes I made was using dice tomatoes because I had them on hand, added more garlic and some basil. Thank you Jackie for an awesome recipe!!!

OMG!!!  I am new to making homemade sauce, but love to cook so I listened
To other reviewers and tried this....I stuck to the recipe adding only some
Crushed red pepper...a pinch for our preference....This is the best sauce I 
Have ever tasted!!!...and I've been eating for 60+ years!  I followed someone 
Else's review who said it was better the next day so I made it yesterday and
Ate it today...my husband and I both LOVED it!!!

This was a really simple and easy sauce to make. I let mine simmer for a few hours and it wasn't bitter at all. I also used peeled plum tomatoes instead of stewed because that's all i had.

This sauce was amazing, but it did need some adjustments. Tbls sugar to help with the acidity and a bay leaf to give it depth and earthiness. Total keeper!

I enjoyed the taste of this sauce and didn't add any sugar, as recommended by other reviewers, simply because I love the acidic tomato flavor and don't really care for a sweeter sauce.  I only added 1/4 cup of the white wine and that seemed to be plenty.  I don't think I'll go with 6 Tbsp. of olive oil next time.  Too much!  I will try 3 Tbsp. next time.  Very good sauce, though, and I intend to make it again and again!

So simple and So Good - perfect.  I used Red Wine instead of White and for those who say they can taste the wine - either did not simmer it for the 30 min or more or it's in your head.

This is a great base recipe that produces a perfect consistency--no watery puddle under the pasta!
My wife is Italian (I'm German), and she said she liked this recipe more than her grandma's!
I agree with most of the reviewers that suggest 1) less olive oil, as 6 tablespoons is too much. I'd go with 4; 2) Add 1 tablespoon of sugar to help cut down the acidity; and 3) More garlic. I went with 3 grated cloves.
Beyond that, I'd add more salt (maybe double?). But you can judge that by tasting the sauce as it simmers.

My husband loves this sauce.  Like so many other reviewers, I will never buy prepared sauce again.  It was great using in my favorite lasagne recipe.  The only revision was that I added 1 tsp of dried basil and 1 Tbsp of brown sugar.

I've made this a few times now and every time it's great! I will usually make it the day before so that the flavors have time to blend and settle. It's so easy that I'll usually just whip it together while I'm making that night's dinner. Tasty too!

We made this to go on a meatball sandwich, and it was pretty darn good. The white wine taste was a bit strong to me, so next time I'll use chicken stock instead. It was also too acidic, so I added a teaspoon or so of sugar to mellow things out. That made a huge difference. Overall, though, it was a quick and delicious recipe! I'll be making it again.

Amazingly easy and good! My husband hates onions, so I left those out. I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, so that I could avoid the processor, and added a Tbsp. of brown sugar to counteract the acidity. (Stewed tomatoes include more sugar.) I am at a high altitude, so I cooked it all about 10 minutes longer. Just wonderful ... I'm happy to have this recipe!

Very delicious! This was my first try at from-scratch marinara sauce, and we love it. I've made it twice now and both times I've been surprised at how easy it is. The consistency is perfect. I think the only modification I may make next time is adding a tad more pepper or maybe some red pepper flakes, I think it could be a little spicier and be even better.

I made this tonight with tomatoes from the garden it was a huge batch so I added what I thought would be about the same amounts of ingredients. I had heard from my sister that she made a marinara with butter so instead of oil I used butter to sauté my onions and garlic in before adding the tomatoes. I didn't have white wine so I didn't use any and it was still great. It was VERY delicious! We will defiantly be making this again.

Lovely. I wanted to make my own pasta sauce since we use it a lot, and store-bought has waaaay more sodium than I want, especially for my toddler. This is so good. I used a rather sweet German white wine. I might try changing up the herbs or adding chili peppers for some more spice, or even adding red peppers.

I really liked this! I skipped the blending, used diced tomatoes instead and added a lot of fresh basil. I also upped the garlic as suggested in reviews. Because I follow a Paleo lifestyle I left out the wine. The other reviewers recommend adding sugar to account for the acidity, but I added real, natural, unsweetened, not from concentrate apple juice (Ocean Spray etc is NOT real juice!! 1/3 cup) and it worked really well to tone down the acidity without adding the processed sugar.

This sauce was excellent. I don't cook with wine so like another review I used chicken broth in place of the wine. This was great with the chicken Parmesan by Chef John. This will be a regular dish.

This sauce was good, but I felt it needed a little sugar, which I added.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes as that is what I had.  Next time I will try it with stewed tomatoes.  This is a keeper recipe that I will use again.

Just made this for a lasagna. forgot all about the wine, but as is, the sauce is great, full of flavor and love the fresh parsley.Next time I'll experiment a little with this recipe, just to make it my own, and give it a little heat. Thanks so much for sharing! =)

As is we like this recipe a lot. The thing is it is very versatile. During winter months when I had no basil I substitute pesto and it is very good. Tonight we had no wine so I used fruit juice :::shrugging shoulders::: it still tastes good but it is slightly watery and I do prefer the kick that wine gives.

This was DELICIOUS! I didn't have a food processor or blender so I followed the advice of another poster and used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed. It was a bit chunkier, but honestly I like sauce like that! I was so surprised at how delicious this was.

There was no depth of flavor just the acidity of the tomatoes, saltiness and garlic taste. Not worth the effort.

Made this tonight for the first time and really enjoyed it. I used crushed tomatoes and skipped the blender plus added a can of diced tomatoes and dried basil, while cutting back the salt. It is a good tasting and easy to make sauce, definitely nice to skip the store bought sauce as I can better control the salt content and it is very budget friendly as well!

I LOVE this recipe with the following changes (and yes, it freezes really well!):

-After sautéing the onions, put the wine in your saucepan and cook it down
-Add a dash of crushed red pepper, fresh basil, mint, and extra garlic to the tomato mixture
-Once you've let the sauce fully simmer, add a pat of butter at the end to smooth out the acidity of the sauce

Delicious - thank you for the recipe, Jackie!

An easy sauce to make with ingredients I already have on hand.  Needs a little kick - I had to add a little sugar.

I have made this many times. The flavor is delicious and fresh tasting. I double the amount of garlic and add fresh basil. I saute the garlic with the onion and then pour all other ingredients in the pan. Then I use an immersion blender to blend all together. I have a double batch simmering right now and my house smells incredible! Thank you for a great recipe!

Oh, I liked this recipe.  I made changes based on what I had on hand.  I used italian seasoning in place of all the herbs listed and garlic powder in place of minced garlic.  (Basically the same, right?)  I also did not use white wine, but a half cup of pasta water blended with the tomato mixture instead.  Finally, I added about a cup of chopped yellow squash for an added health kick.  This was a tasty sauce and I didn't have to add sugar at all.  I let it simmer for a short time, and then served with chicken parm.  Very good!

I would suggest after the onion has been sauteed, add the wine and let it reduce to cook off the alcohol. Then add the sauce ingredients and simmer.
Also, I would use good canned Italian tomatoes in puree.

Absolutely the best. The only changes I made was that I use crushed tomatoes to save the blender step, and I add a teaspoon of sugar.
  We make double batches and freeze it. I can then use it for so many things. We love it!

One of the best Marinara sauces I've ever tried. I used about half the recommended oil and I doubled up the garlic. I've used it with cannelloni and grilled mozzarella sandwiches. Yummy!!

I have tweaked it a little bit by using the crushed tomatoes and I only use 1/8 if not less of the wine.  My picky kids really like it as a lasagna.

Love this recipe! Fast and easy. Only change I made was I used 1/4 cup of wine and 1/4 cup of chicken broth so my kids wouldn't get even a hint of the wine. I too used crushed tomatoes but still put it through the food processor. Made a double batch so I will have some on hand in the freezer.

I loved this recipe, made it for work with a meatball recipe i got from on here and they both were a big hit.  I made a double batch and added 1/2 cup of red wine and 1/2 cup of water cause i didn't have any white wine.  Turned out awesome..  I have some leftover sauce so going to make speghetti for dinner tonight..  Wonderful recipe..

My Italian husband was skeptical with this recipe since it did not contain basil and used stewed tomatoes and wine.  Needless to say it was loved by everyone in the family and will be made again!

This was a terrific base sauce and very easy to make. Very flavorful despite very minor changes. I didn't have wine on hand :( but I love garlic so I added 3 cloves and a dash of sugar and it was delish! Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

Quick, easy and delicious! This is a very versatile sauce. The stewed tomatoes give it a nice flavor and it has a thick, slightly chunky consistency. I have used it for chicken parmesean, eggplant parmesean and served over plain pasta. It works well with just about everything.  I've had to make it several times since finding the recipe 1 month ago because of family requests.  The only changes I made to the recipe are: substitute basil for the oregano and chicken stock for the wine.  I also added a little sugar to cut the acidity. Also, I removed Italian sausage from the casing, browned the meat in a separate pan to add to the sauce.  I used the dripping from the sausage in place of the olive oil and sauteed the onions in that.  I also eliminated the salt since there was plenty in the sausage.   

I found that I needed to double the recipe if I was using it for chicken or eggplant parmesean.  Now, I just double the recipe all the time and freeze what I don't use.  It freezes and reheats very well.

Made this tonight to go with my chicken parmesan and WOW! I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, the only minor changes I made was I only had 18 oz cans of stewed tomatoes and I added a few leaves of fresh basil, Even with too having too many tomatoes it still had an amazing flavour, Plus this was my first time cooking with wine and I was very pleasantly surprised, Thank You very much for such a great recipe, This is going to be printed and put into my recipe binder for sure :)

Very good sauce. I did make a couple changes to suit our taste and I think I've perfected it, after making it several times. I use 3 cloves garlic, a dash of Italion seasoning, a tsp white sugar, add about 1/4 cup of good quality grated parmesan and 1/2 tsp anchovy paste. I know the anchovy paste sounds gross, but it doesn't taste "fishy" at all and I think it really adds something to the sauce . My friend who is a chef said it is often a "secret ingredient" to a lot of marinara sauces.

Oct 12  2012  My girlfriend pointed out this receipie to me and we made it up last saturday night. she was so impressed that she calls it gold.
we used san marzano tomatoes from italy, and added 1/2 teaspoons of sugar to balance to bitter taste of something..(maybe too much oregano cause i like it so much) I also upped the garlic to 3 cloves (from my garden) and 2 sweet red peppers from a jar.  Spun everythig out in the food processor.. i did not add the tomatoe paste as i did not want to mix up san marzano's with who knows what. have since gone out and purchased 1 case of the tomotoes and will be having a marinara making day..  I will do up a big pot and can the sauce in my pressure canner.  excellant sauce..

This was fantastic. I made a few changes: 2 cans of diced tomatoes (instead of stewed), 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 2 cloves of garlic, and 1lb of chopped chicken. I cooked the chopped chicken on the stove with oo, salt, pepper & dried basil. I let the sauce simmer for a total of 45min (30 of that with the chicken).

Delicious! Upon another reviewer's recommendation, I decreased pasley to 1 TB and added 1 tsp basi. The sauce tasted great. Then I added ground turkey. Still good but the extra meat required more seasoning. Very good though!

Excellent. Used brown sugar, chopped fresh basil, oregano, thyme. Otherwise followed recipe. It was very sweet but I think that was from the fresh tomatoes I used. I skinned tomatoes and boiled them down. Will use this recipe again. Very versatile.

After reading reviews I went out on a limb and decided to make a double batch and I am glad I did! I used more fresh parsley than called for as I wanted to use the balance of what I had on hand.   I added crushed red pepper for a kick and a tsp and a half of basil.  No more jar pizza/spaghetti sauce for me!  Thanks ever so much for sharing!

very good I do think it needs a bit of sugar at the end though to cut the sharpness of the tomatoes.  will add that next time.

This is a fantastic Marina Sauce. I have made it exactly as the recipe states and I have modified it. Adding ground beef to this recipe is a good idea but if you do what I did and add 2 lbs of meat you end up with more of a sloppy job then a sauce. Either way original recipe or modified this is a keeper in my book!

is very good.  i spare the food processor and add everything to the pot after cooking the onions then use a hand blender after simmering for 30 mins. salt and pepper before and after simmering. a teaspoon at a time of brown sugar until it suits what your serving it with.

This was my very first time making pasta sauce. It turned out so well, I had alot of compliments! The only thing I did different was add 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar to cut the tartiness, and chopped up some fresh basil because I love it! I omitted the wine since I didnt have any on hand. Wonderful recipe!

Very nice sauce! I found 1/2 cup of wine to be too strong the first time I made it, so the second time I used 1/3 cup and it was much nicer. I add probably 1/3 cup brown sugar to this as well, as we prefer a sweet sauce.

This sauce lived up to its name!  I made this recipe like it was written except only used about 2 tbsp oil and omitted the white wine.  My girls, who are 3 and 6, absolutely loved it!  My husband and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  I will make this over and over.  Thanks so much!

I added finely diced carrots and bell peppers, a bit more garlic, basil and some brown sugar. I used diced tomatoes AND crushed tomatoes (1 can of each) instead of stewed. The consistency came out perfect and the flavor was excellent. I'll use this one again.

There were some mixed reviews with this one - my husband didn't like it all that much, I thought it was pretty good, and my three year old LOVED it. So I decided to average it and go with 4 stars. The taste was a little bland so next time I will probably add more garlic and other spices. I did really like the consistancy of the sauce though, thick without much liquid, which is exactly how I like my marinara. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Jackie!

I was looking for a marinara to slow cook with meatballs for subs. This was a PERFECT starting point! It is so easy, with common ingredients, of course I tweaked it a little bit for my taste... a bit more garlic, a bit more onion and oregano, and used chicken broth instead of wine (its what I had in the pantry :) Excellent recipe!

This was perfect for the lasagna I was making.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes so used whole tomatoes.  Followed directions except for these things; 1) listened to others and used 3 cloves of garlic 2) used 2 tblsp dried parsley because didn't have fresh 3) snuck in 2 grated carrots and half of a diced green bell pepper.  This was very tasty.  I'll use again for lasagna, spaghetti and who knows what else.

I have made this on several occasions now, mainly as a base for pizza. I cannot say enough wonderful things about it- especially as someone who has never been fond of canned tomatoes, preferring fresh instead. I did not used stewed tomatoes though- I just used regular diced canned tomatoes but it works equally well in my opinion. 
I always let it cook till a rolling boil and then lower the heat and let it simmer gently for at least 25 minutes until it thickens and the oil seperates. Simply divine!!

I've made this a few times now and some experimenting has made it much more to my liking. I found that stewed tomatoes were too sweet so I use strained crushed tomatoes that you can usually find in the Italian section of the ethnic foods aisle or near the pasta sauces. I use a little brown sugar to balance out the tartness. I use about 4 or 5 times the amount of dried oregano and 3 or 4 dried bay leaves. I also use about 5 or 6 cloves of garlic and half of a large onion that I finely dice in the food processor. Finally, instead of regular salt I use a combination of celery salt and soy sauce. The soy sauce is a trick from a food network show, and I find that celery salt always goes well with tomato sauces.

This is an okay recipe if you like a strong tomato flavor and no spice. I added more oregano and 1 tsp. Basil, some sugar, and more salt. I excluded the wine but I would have used it if I wasn't out of it. I don't like trying to modify recipes on my own so I am going this 4 stars.

This really is the best marinara sauce.  I added 4 cloves of garlic and sauteed it with the onion.  Also, I wanted a little heat but didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I added a few dashes of tabasco and more pepper.  Finally, I made it for Sunday dinner, so I had all day to let it simmer.  By the 3rd hour, it was awesome.  Used it for Braciole and spaghetti.  PERFECT!

This is the first time I've been able to make a red sauce that I liked! Personally I had to add more spice because the initial recipe was too sweet for my personal taste, but that is more personal preference than anything. I added more garlic, bay leaf, and a little more oregano and cooked it a little longer.

Note to those out there, if substituting red for the white wine, use less than what is called for.  We are red wine drinkers and don't keep white in the house so I used what I had, a merlot...and while the sauce was good, it had a STRONG taste of red wine! Otherwise pretty yum, I made a lasagna with the sauce and it was good!

Nice and thick. It was sweet but yet a little bitter, i guess that's the wine flavor. I did add basil and brown sugar.

This is a great basic recipe. I'm rating it 4 out of 5 because it was bland. I added more oregano, basil, then bay leaves and thyme. Next time I plan on adding more onion and garlic. Definitely add a tablespoon of brown sugar to cut the tartness! **Update: 5 stars based on the changes listed above. I omit the wine all together. I've made this many times and it doesn't disappoint.

Very good!  I wouldn't say the best, but it was certainly easy to make and tasty.  I added a little sugar to sweeten it up a bit (because I like my marinara sweet) and I cut the oil in half.  Oh and I forgot the wine altogether!  I added 2 cloves of garlic, like other reviewers, and just a tad more onion as well.  Would probably make this recipe again, as it's easy and I have most of the ingredients on hand at any given time!

I was making eggplant parmesan and I ran out of the store-bought marinara sauce so I turned to this recipe to get me out of my pinch.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes, which I had on hand.  Other than that, followed the directions to a T, and the sauce came out beautifully.  I think I will start making my own sauce more often!

Loved this recipe!  I took some of the other reviewers advice and used chicken stock instead of wine and I also added a few tablespoons of brown sugar to cut the acidity.  Cooked up some meatballs on the side and plopped them right into the finished sauce.  Love it!

This is a simple flavorful sauce. We made this in a foods class I teach; most of the students liked it. We cut the olive oil in half otherwise when the sauce sits the oil will float to the top after a while. Will make this again.

Best spaghetti sauce ever! I used 1 quart of canned home grown tomatoes, 1 cup of onion, 4 cloves of garlic, and 1/2 tsp of oregano. Nice consistency, not runny. Quick & easy to make. Great stuff!

Wow, this recipe was amazingly good!Everything about it was perfect. There were a few changes I made: I added 2 more cloves of garlic,(I'm a garlic lover),lots of fresh basil about 3 tablespoons,it adds a lot of flavor, and 1 hot red chili.With the changes I made it makes it a 10 or more! It's DELISH!

Surely the BEST MARINARA ! I used San Marzano canned tomatoes, jaggery instead of white / brown sugar and 'cooking wine' (which I will substitute with good drinkable white wine next time). No more store bought marinara !

We have been using this recipe for over a year for all our pasta and pizza sauce. We have never used store bought sauce since. I tried it once with dried parsley....no good. Definitely go with fresh. It turned out the best when I used mothers canned tomatoes.

Wonderful! I used chicken broth instead of white wine because i am not yet at the legal age where i can buy wine and also the stewed tomatoes i got the italian type. Also the store had no parsley but since use the italian blend it made up for that. I will make this again

loved it a great base to build on.  i liked the wine in it.  brightens it up a bit.  WAY better than from a jar.  served with homemade vegetarian meatballs and spaghetti for family from out of town and it was a hit.  i had doubled the recipes and had some of the sauce left over so i froze it.  we ate it the other night and it was also really good.  good with some red pepper flakes added for a kick.

Love this sauce. The only thing I changed is to add 4 tablespoons of fresh basil, and leave out the onions. What a great consistency. My Italian Grandmother liked it also. She is very picky about her sauce.

This is sooooo delicious!  I use whole canned tomatoes.  I squeeze out the excess juice and seeds before putting them in the food processor.  I also add red pepper flakes in the food processor to give the sauce a kick.  I don't add quite as much olive oil to the pan when cooking the onions.  I use about 4 tablespoons.  It's so yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

This is only way I make Marinara sauce now.  It is so less acidic that I don't get heart burn.

Very good!!  I had to use crushed tomatoes because I didn't have stewed on hand - but will try it with stewed tomatoes next time.  And I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar to even it out, and threw a few leaves of fresh basil into the food processor with everything else.  The fresh parsley makes such a difference - grab some at the store instead of using dried.  You'll be glad you did!  This was really good.  I'll be using it inside calzones tonight, and for dipping.  I will definitely be making it again...!!

Very good.  Next time I'm going to seed the tomatoes, but it was still excellent.  I added a finely chopped green pepper, as well as a little extra garlic.

This sauce is so simple to make and yet so delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  The ravioli that I usually have leftovers after serving were completly gone!  I will keep making this in the future.

I'll use less onions next time (I used dried onion flakes), make sure to use the fresh parsley (a new ingredient for me to use) AND I used about 1/8-1/4 cup of White Grape Juice instead of the alcohol - it was great!!

I followed these instructions to the letter but found that the final product needed sugar. So I did add 2 tbsp of sugar. I'll make it again.

Awesome. I used marsala wine rather than regular white (our favorite place uses marsala in their sauce so I figured I would give it a try) and it was a little over a half cup. Also added probably a teaspoon of white sugar. When sauteing the onions I let them sit for a bit, they were just about caramelized; I didn't use 6 tbsp of oil either, it was probably 2 or 3. I made the sauce, simmered for at least 30 min., cooled it down then heated it back up at dinner time. I think it really gave the flavors time to meld. Next time I will blend the tomatoes a little better, I like a thinner sauce. I made chicken parm to go with the sauce & my father in law said it was the best he ever had.

i cannot even count how many times i have made this sauce! amazing! before i found this recipe i was using a different recipe for pasta sauce, and i don't even think i have to tell you that i threw the previous one out. the only change i made was adding a tsp of brown sugar and i use 2 tbs of dried parsley.   this works well as a meat sauce, too.

This was pretty good! Wasn't hard at all and had a really nice flavor. I put 1 extra clove of garlic and some extra seasonings, added some ground turkey and had spaghetti with it and it was good. Will be making again, thanks!

Best sauce!!! I love it! My BF is very picky and won't eat most marinara sauces but he loves this one! It's great for pizza, spaghetti, manicotti or anything else.... I don't put wine because i don't keep it on hand and it still comes out great.

What a great starter sauce. I do cook it longer that suggested at 30 minutes. Since making it the first time I now double the recipe and freeze half for the next time I am making a pasta dish. It is at that time I add some Italian sausage or meatballs.

This sauce was excellent and EASY! I used crushed tomato so I wouldn't have to wash the blender - no problem.  I doubled the wine.  Prefect marinara flavor.  I always make this with meatball and simmer the meatballs in the sauce for 30 minutes.

This sauce was just "okay" to me. I didn't think it had that great of flavor, and would probably just buy jarred sauce rather than make this again.

Absolutely the best sauce I have ever made and I have been working at the perfect sauce for years now.  Prepared exactly by the recipe and the family loved it.

Wow... This is good. I used a very cheap chardonnay, but it still is fantastic. I definitely would only use 3 TBSP of oil, as I was scooping it off the top while it was simmering.  Other than that... This is without a doubt the best marinara I have ever had, and it is way better the next day! In fact, if I were to make this for company, I would make it the day before.

Truly the best marinara sauce I have ever used.  I make this at least once a month since I found it.  I use red wine instead of white, since I never have white in the house, and it tastes amazing!

Good sauce, very easy to make. I did think there was too much wine which is why I did not give it five stars. Will be making again but with less wine.

If you are looking for superb marinara sauce, this is it.  You don't need to look any further.  Great recipe!  I only used one can of stewed tomatoes and had plenty for 4+ people.

My kids love this, no more jarred sauce for us.  They were ready to eat it cold!  I used chicken stock, no wine on hand, and I also used a stick blender to mix it all up.  No need for the food processor, sauted onions, add everything else and pulse a few times and sauce is on!  Excellent.

This is a fantastic marinara which I now make about once a week.  I changed it a bit by cutting down to 2 tbsl parsley and adding 1 tbls of basil.  I leave out the onion since my wife hates them but I do add 1 tsp of onion powder.  I also add 1/8 tsp of Cayenne pepper and 1 more clove of garlic.  Great!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I've tried dozens of marinara recipes over the years, and this is definitely the best.  I substituted italian seasoning for the oregano, used 2 cloves of garlic, added 1.5 tb of brown sugar, and added 2 tb of butter at the end.  For those wondering about the white wine, I used a low priced sauvignon blanc, which was perfect.

I use this recipe every time I make pasta. I prefer to forgo the food processor and use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes just because I like a chunky sauce. I add a pinch of red pepper flakes when sauteing the onions for a little heat. The white wine makes such a difference! If you prepare the sauce first, then while it is simmering start heating the pasta water and by the time you finish cooking the pasta according to directions, it is done. This recipe is very easy to follow. The taste and cost effectiveness will get you off jarred sauce for good.

I wish I had found this recipe earlier in the tomato season!  At the end we had so many romas that I was desperate for something way to cook and freeze them and this is perfect!  I added sweet Italian sasauge to the recipe and there were no leftovers for the lunch the next day.  Definitely a great recipe!!

This was the best marinara sauce ever.  I just used diced tomatoes and added a little more garlic.  It had a great taste.  My husband said it was a nice change from the meat and sausage I usually make.

Really good recipe, especially because it uses stuff I usually had on hand.  I used canned italian tomatoes with basil, oregano & garlic already in it but still added fresh.  It's so much better and almost as easy as the stuff in a jar  :)

It's a great base recipe. I love to use it for a baked goat cheese appetizer. Fill a ramekin halfway with marinara, settle a disc of goat cheese on top and bake for 20-30 minutes at 350. Serve with bagel chips. The only change I've made is occasionally adding a few Tbs of brown sugar to offset the acidity and perhaps a pinch of red pepper flakes for the spicy crowd. Love this recipe!

This sauce was so good. We loved it. The only thing I did a little different is I added 18 oz of tomato paste, because I was making this for pizza and I wanted it a little thicker. So good.

I am embarassed to admit I didn't actually READ the directions, I just threw all of the ingredients into a pot on the stove.  I did roughly chop the stewed tomatoes, but even so, my sauce turned out more chunky than it was supposed to.  It was still excellent!  I made recipe as is, but it would be easy to adjust to your personal tastes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this exactly as the recipe instructed and it was incredible!  Never made marinara sauce before and my friends were impressed.  And they're old school Italians.

fantastic sauce! i love the consistency. i sweated (sweat? whatever the past tense of that is) the onions and garlic and then added them to the blender... i also threw in some sauteed cremini mushrooms. tossed in a bay leaf and some basil as well as the oregano, and as someone else suggested, added 1T of brown sugar as the tomatoes on their own are a bit tart. delicious!

I made a 1/2 batch because I needed Marinara Sauce for the Cheesy Italian Tortellini recipe.  When I tasted it by itself, it seemed a little lacking.  When I used it in the other recipe, it ended up working wonderful and the tortellini came out great.

As if this needed another review!  I liked it a lot.  Subbed out diced tomatoes for stewed and dried parsley for fresh.  I skipped the food processor step for a little bit chunkier result.  I used some leftover Pinot Grigio.  It was delish!

I had to find a recipe for spaghetti sauce because I wasn't sure if Ragu and Prego were kosher, besides the fact that I love cooking from scratch. I knew this recipe was worth trying because I love cooking with white wine, and it was so good and simple too. Throw everything in the blender, saute your onion and then add everything in the pot and simmer!! I used the 1 clove of garlic to blend in with the tomatoes, but I felt like that wasn't going to be enough for me, so I saute another clove with the onions, and it came out great!!! Not going back to the jar stuff!

I rarely keep to the recipe thinking I can always make it better but put my ego aside and followed the directions just as they were. Wow! What a good sauce. I used it with the "Baked Ziti I" from this site and I am ready to make some more.

Wow - I didn't know it was that easy to make a great marinara!  I tried this a couple of different times with different wines - make sure you like the wine before you use it - the flavors will come out!  I liked it best with Rosenblum's Kathey's Cuvee viognier.

this was super-easy and great tasting.  your backsplash and washcloth will thank you, however, if you remember to put a lid on the pot... mine are still a little grouchy with me.  I did add a little brown sugar, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  can't wait to make this with my own tomatoes this summer!

Great marinara sauce!  I didn't make any changes to this and I was thrilled with it- it is the perfect consistency (thick but not gloppy)!  I made it to use on stuffed riggies on Friday (couldn't eat meat), and then I used some more of it on pizza tonight, and was very happy with the recipe both times.  In fact, I think I liked this so much, it will replace my old pizza sauce!

This is absolutely delicious. I made it as stated with a few little changes. Also, it came to the perfect consistency in the blender. I added in some brown sugar, a ton of fresh oregano (my aerogarden makes it grow like crazy) a little extra pepper and garlic. Also I substituted chicken broth for the wine. so so good!

This was delicious! I didn't blend everything together because I like a chunky sauce, but the recipe is very very good, I only made a few changes, I used some basil and other seasonings and some tomato sauce because I didn't blend everything. It turned out nicely.

Followed the original recipe except that we did NOT run it through a food processor or strainer.  We also cooked it for a few hours while we got ready to make the pasta.  Yum Yum!

I liked this sauce, but I would probably omit the wine or use a dryer wine next time.  I used a Finger Lakes Riesling, it added an odd flavor for some reason.  My boyfriend really liked it, though, so maybe it's just my taste.

I made this for dinner last night and hubby and I both loved it!  The only changes I made was I forgot to add the white wine (oops) and I forgot to saute the onions first so I did that in a different pan and then threw them into the mix which was already simmering on the stove (oops) - still turned out delicious!!!  Next time I will try it with the wine if I can remember :-)

I made this sauce exactly as is except I used canned diced tomatoes instead of stewed and I added an extra can. I also added a TBSP of brown sugar and used red wine instead of white. Fantastic!!!

Made this tonight for dinner.  Really good fresh tasting sauce.  I found the olive oil to be a bit excessive.  I cut back and still ended up taking a paper towel to the top of the sauce to soak up some excess oil.  Like some others, I added some basil to taste.  Also used chicken broth instead of wine.

The title of this recipe says it all.  My Italian husband who is hard to impress, especially with Italian dishes, LOVED this sauce!!!  He now makes it quite often!  FYI- we use 2 cans of Aylmer Accents Original for the stewed tomatoes.

This sauce is absolutely delicious!!  I am never buying jarred sauce again after making this.  I added a little crushed red pepper because I like sauce a little on the spicier side but would be delicious without this as it has so much flavor.  I followed recipe exactly (except I simmered sauce longer, maybe 1.5 hours only because I made it early).  Does not need any changes except cutting olive oil in half, a little too much is called for in my opinion.  Wonderful!

Great Recipe!  I follwed the recipe exact, except for another garlic clove and it was very easy and very good.  I made chicken parmigiana with the sauce.  My family really enjoyed this.  I will be making this again.  Thank you.

A lovely sauce. Great consistency, pretty to look at, hearty, and simple to make. Many variations in flavour are possible - mare garlicky, red instead of white wine, additional herbs, etc. Thanks so much!

Super simple to make and so tasty.  I used Chardonnay for the white wine.  I took the advice and used crushed tomatoes so no food processor was needed.  Delish!

This was awesome! My whole family loved it.

I used what I had in the pantry, so I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, white zinfandel instead of white wine (made it sweeter but still great), and dried parsley.

I pulsed it all in the blender so it would be slightly chunky.

I also didn't use as much oil in the pan.

I don't cook often. And by "often" I mean "ever." When my mom asked me to make chicken parmesan tonight, my first thought was "Wha?" But then I figured I could use this opportunity to demonstrate my culinary prowess (it's never exercised but I'm convinced it exists). So I did the whole thing from scratch, using this recipe for the sauce. The only difference was that I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 2 tbsp (all I had) of the dried stuff. It was easy and fantastic! My mom asked for the recipe, but I'm pretty sure she still doesn't believe that I made it from scratch. Thank you to whoever posted this recipe! I'll definitely use it again.

Very good base recipe. Good consistancy. I doubled the garlic and replaced the parsley with basil. I also added a little sugar to cut down on the acidity.

I am not much of a cook and I would never consider making my own sauce.  But this was so easy and quick and the flavor beats any jar sauce you can buy.  I will keep these ingredients on hand at all times and I will never buy jar sauce again

This is an amazing recipe...I added an extra 8 oz can of crushed tomatoes to have a little extra sauce.  I also added, about a spoonful of sugar, a tablespoon of butter, crushed red peppers to give it a bit of a kick....This was FANTASTIC!

I followed the directions exactly and LOVED this marinara sauce.  I made this to put over plain spaghetti.  For people who like meat in their sauces, this would be a great base marinara sauce for Chicken Parmeasen or such.  I only eat marinara sauce and this by far beat anything out of the jar!!  If you can use fresh garlic and fresh parsley, it will make this much more flavorful.

Finally, a good marinara recipe, I will never go back to the others. I also added 1 tsp of brown sugar and some extra garlic, and I used freeze-dried parsley and it turned out fine.  Yummy!

I was feeling lazy, and just dumped all of these ingredients in my crockpot and let cook on low for 5 or 6 hours.  I don't mind a chunky sauce so I skipped all the pureeing and saute-ing.  It was good- I don't know about the "best" but that could be due to my unorthodox cooking method.  Still, it the flavor was good and it all disappeared.

my first ever time trying a marinara sauce! I love it! A few changes. I used pasta sauce instead of stewed tomatoes and didn't use the food processor at all though I used an electric mixer to blend everything together in the pot. Also used dried pasley.

I've been making a veggie marinara sauce but my grandson was here and I didn't have sauce in the freezer and wasn't sure he'd like the veggie sauce.  Planned to use my last jarred sauce...halfway thru discovered I didn't have any.  I'm glad I tried this recipe and will use it again.  Very good.  The only change I would make next time (personal preference) is to use tomatoes without added high fructose corn syrup or added sugar; maybe use crushed tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.  Quick, easy, and very tasty.

I used fresh tomatoes and roasted them with onions and garlic before pureeing and putting them in instead of the canned tomatoes.  ITs very delicious!  I also added a bit of sugar.

The great thing about this recipe is how versatile it is. I've been using it for a long time and the variations I've made are endless. However, if you have fresh herbs use those. And, if you have basil then add it. Overall, a good recipe.

Thank you Jackie! Great sauce and so easy.  I couldn't believe that such a simple sauce could be so good.  I used 3 roasted garlic cloves, a 1/4 teaspoon of fennel seed, and a tablespoon of brown sugar.  It's the best.  No more jarred stuff for me. I forgot to say I also add 2 leaves of fresh basil.  Update:  the 1st time I made this I did not measure parsley and it was delicious.  I find measuring amount to too much parsley and the sauce is bitter.

Great basic, easy-to-make sauce.  I put in two HUGE cloves of garlic - probably the equivalent of four cloves - and as another reviewer said, I think it was a bit much, even for a garlic-lover like me.  I didn't read the directions all the way through and ended up pureeing the onions with the rest of the ingredients; also, I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used 4 tsp. dried and it still turned out great...a nice smooth sauce.

I stuck to the recipe - only substituting 4 tsp of dried parsley for the 4 tbsp of fresh parsley. The is a great marinara! Next time I may add a little brown sugar and use a little less olive oil but it was great as is. I will be making this again!

I used the canned san marzano tomatoes the second time I made this and it made it even BETTER, if that is possible.  this is an excellent recipe and if you want to kick it up, spend a little more on the san marzano and it will make a difference.  thanks, I will never use another marinara recipe again, this is MINE!!!!

Followed directions to the tee, except I added a little too much parsley to my sauce.  I was really scared at first, but I guess I worried for nothing!!  It was mouthwatering.  I read a review from someone for this recipe stating that after making this sauce they would no longer buy jarred sauce...I AGREE!!!

I wonder what I did wrong- I followed the recipe except i only had red wine, so i used that in place of white.  It just didn't tast right, can't put my finger on it.  I used this to top my stuffed shells from this site.  My company seemed to enjoy the meal, but to me the sauce wasn't very good.  Maybe I will try this again and tweak it a bit.

A great sauce but I have never made one without the fresh basil, it makes it perfect. THEN it gets my 5 stars! And be careful with the wine, I've spilled a bit too much in and it ruins it.

I have 2 words per-fect!!! 
I was about to skip it and buy marinara sauce, but luckily I didn't!!!
I did as other users suggested and added another 1/2 garlic clove, and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. next time i will buy diced tomatoes to cut out the processing part.

Just made this and it tastes awesome straight out of the pan.  I can't wait to put it on my meatballs.  I will be making again.  Much better than store bought sauce and so quick and easy to make.  I would make again in a large batch and freeze some for later use.

I've now made this a few times.  It's absolutely wonderful!!  Quick, easy to prepare, and just let it simmer for 30 minutes, and you have a great sauce.  I used it as a pizza sauce, and it was wonderful.  Used the leftovers for spaghetti, and it was great there, too.

Excellent basic recipe.  I used fire-roasted tomatoes and added some basil and about 2 tsp. sugar for my taste.  Used a mild pinot grigio and it was perfect!  Husband tried to eat it all out of the pot on some bread, so I had to make another batch :-)

This was very good and easy.  I added more garlic and onion just b/c I'm a huge fan of the two.  I threw it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for about 6 hours.  I added cooked ground beef the last hour.  Turned out very tasty.  I will try a few other things next time to bring it up to 5 star quality!

I omitted the parsley and added basil...also I only used one can of stewed tomatoes and replaced the second can with diced tomatoes.  I made it for friends who just LOVED it!  This will be the sauce I make always...it was perfect!

This was the first Maranara I'd ever made and it was AMAZING.  I altered it a bit by adding the garlic to the onions and for the saute and I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one.  I also substituted red wine for the white wine.  MMMMM it was so good.  I will make it again..

Since I'm not a fan of jarred spaghetti sauce, I thought I'd give this a try. It was very good! I only added half of the white wine because I ran out and it was still tasty! I added some italian seasoning and ground beef and that was all I did differently. I can't wait to try this again when I have the full amount of white wine! I definitely recommend!

This was good both times we had it, but I highly recommend using fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  First time I made this we had fresh tomatoes from our garden, and it was amazing!  When I made it the second time with canned tomatoes we didn't enjoy it as much.

Perfect... very basic and easy.  The longer you let it simmer, the better.  I added a little basil and also used a little red wine when I ran out of white.  I also used slightly less oil than called for.  Yummy!

It IS the best marinara sauce like the name says!  Only thing I changed was add basil.
UPDATE:  I made this again tonight and my husband kept on raving and raving about it!  I didn't even use fresh parsley this time and I also used 1 can of stewed tomatoes along with 1 can of crushed tomatoes.  BOY, it's delicious!  I would NEVER buy spaghetti sauce again!  Thank you!

This was very good. I didn't use the full amount of olive oil- just enough to be tasted, about 3 T. I think this would be a really versatile recipe. I just used it on spaghetti, but it could be good in lasagna, in calzones, or with meatballs. I didn't give it 5 stars because although we really liked it, it wasn't anything that I feel like I have to make again.

I loved how it was easy to make. My husband and son are VERY picky on pasta sauce and they just LOVED it. I had added ground beef cooked with salt and 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning. I thought it was good but not "out of this world". I did add an extra clove of garlic like other reviewers suggested.  I may add some Italian Seasoning to the sauce next time. I'd say I will definitely make this again. It's wasn't the best I've had but as easy as it is to make it's a keeper!

Tasty and easy. I just dumped stuff in based on the recipe, used red wine, added more garlic of course, and some basil. I really liked the smooth consistency and was great to sop up with bread.

Great sauce....made a few changes.  Added 2-3 garlic cloves and extra red pepper flakes (probably about 1/2 tsp.).  Also added a bay leaf and then if bitter added a titch of salt.  Just made it again and this time made four times the amount.  Still turned out great.

I've made this a couple of times now.  I use fresh herbs - oregano and thyme.  Once I made it with white wine, the other time with red, and they were both good.  And like another reviewer said, if it's bitter add a bit of sugar (not much).

I make this sauce every 2 weeks, although if I didn't double the recipe, I'd do it every week. A few modifications though. I use a whole vidalia onion, and add in some fresh basil.

Great recipe!

Nothing in particular stood out but it was still delicious and easy to make.  Just make a batch and refridgerate.  Heat up whenever you have spaghetti for dinner. 100 times better then the jar stuff.

This was really delicious.  We added squash, broccoli, mushrooms and zucchini to it for a healthy thick sauce.  We forgot the parsley and we added about 1 tsp of dried basil.  I highly recommend this sauce.

Good but needed more flavor.  I added extra basil, oregano, and garlic.    I cooked everything in a crock pot and it was extremely easy.

Great sauce! a lot of flavor, although I say this having made it with a few additions: 2 cloves garlic instead of one, shake of rosemary,
1/2 tsp thyme, 
several shakes of italian seasoning, 1/2 finely diced large onion 
1 green pepper, chopped fine.

This is a great sauce.  This was my first time making it so I followed the recipe with the exception of diced tomatoes instead of stewed, but next time I'll try adding mushrooms and more garlic.

This was my first attempt at making marinara sauce, and it turned out really good! I didn't have parsley on hand. I added basil leaves and a pinch of red pepper flakes since I like my sauce spicy. It was a little acidic, I think I might use some bay leaves next time per a reviewer's suggestion to cut that. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Of course I had to add more garlic, just because I love it, but very very good recipe. When you see how easy it is you'll never buy the jarred stuff again.

I love this recipe. Simple but tasty. I make Meditteranean Lemon Chicken from this site & top with this sauce (I use chicken breasts). I then top with shredded mozza, which melts nicely. This comes close to one of my favorite restaurant dishes. Sooo good!

The sauce was good, not the best.  I will definitely make again, possibly adding a bit more onion and garlic, to my taste.  I made it with lean ground beef and I expect that tomorrow it will taste better, as with most sauces.

To say this is the best red sauce ever is just plain silly. BUT it is good. BUT not better, or certainly easier, than the better jarred brands.

Easy and delicious. I put in a bit more garlic and was glad I did. If you're a garlic person, definitely go with 3 cloves instead of 1.

Yum!! This was great!  I sauteed the garlic and onions in olive oil, and then put them in the blender with the other ingredients.  I added some brown sugar for the tartness(probably due to the "No Name" tomatoes I used which were diced, not stewed) and I added some fresh basil.  I simmered for 1.5 hrs and skimmed the foam off the top.

Yum!  I made this sauce for eggplant parmigiana and we enjoyed it on our side of angel hair pasta too.  Delicious!

This just isn't quite what I expected, but I can see where others may like it.  The consistency was great, and the sauce has potential, but to me the stewed tomatoes add way too much sweetness, so I may consider trying again with just plain whole tomatoes.  I was able to salvage by adding lots of other spices, but I will not make this again without a serious overhaul of the ingredients.

Excellent!  Like others, I also added extra garlic and basil, and let it simmer for about an hour.  I made chicken parmesan using it and it was unbelievable.  Thanks so much, I will never buy sauce again!

Best sauce I have ever made - hands down.  I did add more than twice the amount of garlic as well as fresh basil and fresh oregano (per the advice of ~TNT~ - thanks!) however I would add even more of the fresh herbs next time.  Can't wait to make a large batch and freeze it.  Thanks much for the recipe - outstanding!

This sauce was so quick and delicious.  I added twice the minced garlic, and sauteed another clove with the onion.  I took the advice of other members and let it all simmer for about 45 minutes.  My husband and I love it!  Tomorrow we are going to try making a pizza with the leftovers.

The name says it all!  I was skeptical because it called for white wine (I've always used red) and has no basil, but I followed the directions (adding more garlic because I love it!) and it was incredible.  This will be the only recipe I use for marinara.  Thanks Jackie.

This sauce was fabulous! It makes a very tasty base. It tastes great as it is made. I added a second garlic clove and i sauteed a few crimini mushrooms to throw into the sauce. I also did not use any of the parsley as i did not have any so i doubles the oregano. It was awesome!

This really was the best marinara ever!  So easy and quick to make.  This recipe is a great base as is but next time I'll experiment a little and add mushrooms to my onions.  This one is going in the recipe drawer and I'll never buy store sauce again.

This is wonderful!  I have been searching for a recipe like this!  I added just a bit more garlic, but otherwise made as written.  I put the sauce in a crockpot and let it cook on low all day while I was busy, made the noodles at dinner time, and felt like I was eating out, right at home!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!  Wish I could give more than five stars, it rates a 10!!!!!

This is a great sauce.  I took others opinions and simmered for alittle over an hour.  It allows all the flavor to blend more.  My only suggestion is alittle less oil.  I don't like to have an oily sauce.  You can try to skim it off the top but that's tetious and alittle difficult.  I used it on a pizza I made and save the left overs for some spinach manicotti. This is a wonderful recipe if you're looking for something quick!

Love this recipe.  Possibilities are endless for your own personal taste preferences -- this sounds weird, but I like to sometimes substitute chervil leaves (hojas de perifollo) for the parsley.  And I'll also add I'm a sea salt snob; try using it instead!

Pretty good, fresh tasting sauce, however I think it would have benefited by simmering for much longer.

Too salty.  Other than that, though, really good!  I liked the texture.  I only had one can of tomatoes and no paste, so I put in a diced fresh tomato and a small can of tomato sauce.  I also used way less oil than recommended.  It worked pretty well.

If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!!  This is my new recipe for a quick marinara sauce.  I used it on chicken parm and it was spectacular.  The stewed tomatoes gave such a wonderful flavor.  I used the original recipe tomatoes but I also saw Italian recipe.  I was afraid the Italian migh have competing flavors.  The only change I made was to use more garlic- 2 large cloves.  I am eating the leftovers today and it is even better. Cant wait to use it on eggplant parm.  Thanks a bunch!!

Goodbye jared sauces!! Easy because you don't need of ingrediants and quick because you don't have to simmer this sauce for hours before hand, although you could if you wanted to.

My family really loved this sauce, and I was surprised at how easy it is to make. I did mix it with cooked ground beef for a dinner series I'm catering, and it went very well as a meat sauce. My daughter and I love it the way the recipe is written, though. We'll probably be doing this instead of bottled sauce from now on!

The title says it all.  Excellent flavor!  I used a sweet onion for a sweeter flavor.  Also I did not have white wine, so I used grape juice instead, still came out delicious.  I have served it with bread sticks and pasta.

This was a very good sauce. I am very picky about them and this really is almost 5 star worthy. It is missing something but still tastes great.

This is a really good marinara, and easy too!  I've made it just like the recipe and it's fantastic.  I've also made it with red wine instead of white (someone in the house must have sipped all the white. Ahem) and it came out great.  I am probably more generous with the garlic than indicated :)

Made this last night with spaghetti squash.  It was fabulous.  The only things I did differently were added fresh basil and a bit of brown sugar.  This sauce is definitely a keeper.

By far the best and easiest Marinara out there.  The only thing I add is more garlic...but I always add more garlic.  A huge crowd favorite and easy to double also.

Fantasitc recipe. I made a few changes (basically added a few more ingredients) and several people at the party I made if for said it was the best red sauce they had ever had. I couldn't disagree - I loved it as well.

Absolutely amazing!  The name does not lie!  I will never buy jarred sauce again, this was just WAY too easy and much too good!

We used it last night to make a Baked Ziti recipe from this site and it was perfect!

This is awesome! I omitted the salt (as always) and didn't hand chop the Italian parsley or mince the garlic (used 3 cloves instead of 1). I put both in the food processor and let it do the work then added the other ingredients as directed.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Fantastic!!!

This was a great basic recipe to work with.  I added more garlic and basil to the recipe.  I also added about half the amount of white wine called for and found that it was more than sufficient.

I like this recipe however I did leave out the wine. It worked very nicely with three cheese spinach stuffed shells, and I liked that this sauce had a smooth consistency you usually don't find with marinara (no one in the family likes the chunky version!). Nice overall, I gave it 4 stars because it did need a bit of tweaking.

This is definately a recipe that you won't be dissapointed in.  My adult son (world's biggest critic) said this is the best sauce he has ever tasted!  I simmered the sauce a little longer than called for and added italian sausage.

I've made this several times and have given the recipe to the cooks in my family.  The only modification that I made was leaving out the parsley. Other than that, a 10 star sauce -- I've never had a better marinara!

Excellent. I tweaked it a bit for my tastes, adding a bit more garlic, some chopped fresh basil (about the same amount as the parsley), and a diced yellow bell pepper, along with almost a tablespoon of sugar. By far the best marinara sauce I've made. I loved it!

This was great.  Much thicker sauce than I thought it would be.  I used crushed tomatoes, 2T dried parsley, about 3 cloves garlic, omitted white wine, added 1T sugar, and 1/2t sweet basil.  My husband thought it needed to be a little more sweet so next time I will add 1.5 to 2T sugar.  I threw all this in a crock pot on low for 5 hours.  Easy, simple, and delicious.  This served only 4 servings in my family.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very good.  I did add fresh basil to give more flavor.  I also used crushed tomatoes in lieu of the stewed tomatoes to eliminate the blender step.

Very good!  I used whole tomatoes, fresh herbs * unfiltered olive oil. Definitely use the wine!! It is a great, versatile recipe.

This marinara sauce was pretty good and very easy to make. I added an extra clove of garlic and a little sugar.  While I did use dry basil, as called for, I think that the sauce would have been better with fresh sweet basil.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't care for it and was disappointed, however I did have two of my dinner guests think it was the best they had ever tasted.

This was a great basic marinara sauce recipe.  My husband, who normally doesn't like marinara sauce loved it.  I did make a few changes, but still stuck to the basic recipe.  I added another clove of minced garlic and some fresh basil to the tomatoes.  Then, when I put the sauce in the pan to simmer it, I added some more, chopped resh basil.  It turned out great!!!

Excellent sauce!  Very little effort goes into this great recipe that tastes like it comes from a fine Italian restaurant.  I have made countless batches since I first tried this, and everyone always wants the recipe.  I usually make multiple batches at once, then divide and freeze in plastic storage containers.  Thanks so very much for this great recipe!  PS- We love it with "The Best Meatballs" from this site too!

I've made this recipe a few times, tastes great.  I changed a few things up; I also added more onion, less wine, basil and more garlic.  Biggest change though is I use chunky style crushed tomatoes (pastene makes a great one) instead of the stewed tomatoes.  You get a much heartier sauce and the entire italian family loves it!

Good!  I also used two cloves of garlic.  Used fresh oregano, and added fresh basil as well.  Cut the oil in half.  The white wine gave it an interesting flavor.  Will probably make again.

Yum!  Really liked this recipe, and so did everyone in my family.  Added lots more garlic than what it called for.  Will probably add more onion next time, too.  I also used diced tomatoes with garlic, onion, and basil, as well as Italian flavored tomato paste.

We really liked the ease to make and taste of this sauce.  The only change I really made was two cloves garlic instead of one.  Next time I will make with red wine instead of white for bit of a different taste.

I have found the PERFECT marinara recipe...and I messed it up the first time!! I didn't have any paste, but made the sauce anyway...a little liquidy, so it's good that way on a heavy pasta....
Now I'll make it the right way and it will be even better!! Thanks so much!!

This recipe was all right but it didn't really impress me or my wife.  It was nice because it did taste a lot fresher than the normal jarred sauce but it just didn't have enough flavor for us to make this too often.  We used it over ravioli so maybe we'll try it on regular pasta next time.

I love this recipe!  I was looking to impress my boyfriend buy making my own spaghetti sauce so I tried this one.  I don't like to cook, and this recipe is so simple it has become a recipe I turn to weekly.  The only problem I have is that the oil and the tomato sauce don't completely combine.

I have never made good spaghetti sauce in my life but this recipe was amazing! It was really easy and came out perfect. I hate chunks in sauce so using the food processor was a great way to eliminate them! I put the onions right in the food processor (since I hate lumps) and it comes out fine.  I also cooked ground beef in the pan before adding the tomato mixture and wine, and used the sauce in the 'Baked Ziti I' recipe from this site. This recipe is awesome, thanks so much!

Seemed simple, and after reading the other reviews, I decided to double the recipe for a party.  Delicious!!  I added extra garlic but otherwise followed to a T.  Very flavorful...  I guess it's true, simple recipes can be even better than more complicated ones sometimes!  :)  THanks for sharing, is a keeper!

This is very good, added a tablespoon of fresh basil(remember to cut it in half is using dried), you can leave out the pepper too,, i did with and without,  liked it both ways. One time I added peporoni, hambuger, black olives italian sausage, and used shell noodles, placed in pan covered with parmasian, and motz cheeze and baked, we called it pasta pizza.

This truly is the best marinara sauce yet!  I did make a few changes though.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, omitted the oil, pepper, onion and wine.  I added 1 t basil, 1 T sugar and a small can of mushrooms.  Delicious!

This was my first attempt at homemade sauce.  It turned out well, of course I tweaked it a little to my liking.  I omitted the wine (dry county), and placed all the spices (w/a little extra e.v.o.o. to help the spices blend better) and tomatoes into a crock pot on high.  Sauted onion, fresh sliced mushrooms, thinly sliced zucchini w/e.v.o.o. & large crushed clove of garlic, transferred (with a pinch of sugar) into crock pot and continued to cook on high for one hour (1.5 hrs total).  Served with penne pasta, topped it with a little grated mozzerella, breadsticks, and a salad.  My finicky husband picked out the zucchini, but nonetheless, this a good meatless sauce!!  It was very easy, the prep time took a little longer b/c I used fresh veggies.  (I may add some shredded carrots next time to appease my husband.)
I did double the batch because I didn't know how many were coming over, and it made PLENTY!!!  I had enough to feed 10 people.  I can see freezing the sauce in small batches for quick during the week dinners.  It turned out great, and I got good reviews from my friends I served it to.

We really liked this. Made a nice, smooth sauce. Could easily add peppers, mushrooms, or whatever if you prefer for a chunkier sauce. It makes quite a bit - I saved a Prego jar to save it in (while it sat overnight to blend the flavors)and the recipe filled that plus a small Tupperware bowl. At the store I accidentally grabbed cilantro instead of parsley. Figured what the heck? and just used it anyway! Still tasted great. - The tupperware bowl went to my grandparents and they even asked for the recipe. Who would've thought? I served it over the Artichoke and Tomato Chicken on this site and it was very good!

Yummy! Poured this over cheese ravioli in a 9x13, sprinkled some mozzarella on top, baked it, and had a delicious dinner.  Hubby and 3 young kids loved it.  I omitted the wine, and added an extra clove of garlic and it was just marvelous.

So good!  I added more garlic and a shallot but that was the only changes I made.  A wonderful starting point for whatever else you want to add.  I will use this from now on.
UPDATE:  I added 1 whole small onion and about a cup of white wine as well as a tbsp each of oregano and basil...slowly cooking on stove for about 3 hours! Used my stick blender right in the pot to make everything smooth!

EXCELLENT!!  I made this and the only change I made was to use Port Wine since it was the only kind I had handy.  I used in the Baked Ziti 1 from this site!  GREAT combination of recipes!

I'm not sure how to rate a spaghetti sauce recipe because spaghetti sauce is pretty hard to screw up.  I gave this four stars because it was good, but not as fantastic as I'd hoped.  This might be due to some of the changes I made:  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed because that's all I had, I unfortunately had to replace garlic with garlic powder, I was also out of oregano and used Italian seasoning instead, and I only had dried parsley.  I used more onion (put the onion in the food processor before the sauce ingredients go in and chop them like that, then saute them!) and I added mushrooms because I love them.  I also added a bit of sugar to cut back on the tart taste and used 1/3 the olive oil (could have done with even less).  Also, how does this recipe make 32 servings?  Maybe 32 rabbit sized servings (my rabbit loves spaghetti)!  I got eight half cup servings out of it.  This was good, but I'll keep looking!  Thanks for the recipe, Jackie!

The title of this recipe doesn't lie.  Truely a great marinara sauce.  I serve it straight, not adding anything extra.

Well, I have always wanted to be from an Italian family so I would learn the art of making a fine Marinara sauce.  Finally I am excited because this recipe was simple and delicious.  I felt like an Italian pro chef!  Will make again...hard to eat the jar stuff since I have found this recipe!  Awesome!  Try it with Baked Parmesan Chicken from Allrecipes!!

My 11-year old daughter made this recipe, following the directions exactly, except using red instead of white wine. I thought it was good, but prefer a spicier sauce.  Most of the family thought it was too sweet and had too much of a wine taste (although perhaps using white wine would have improved that).

Excellent tasting, and does not get much easier than this. Used this for baked ravioli parm, came out wonderfully. Varied slightly from the recipe though. Did not have fresh parsley, used dried. Also made the sauce the day before. I think many sauces (or soups and stews) have better flavor the next day. No more jar sauce here.

This sauce is amazing!  I could drink this stuff.  The only change that we made was using 4 tsp of dried parsley instead of the fresh parsley.  I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was kind of bland and a little bitter while it was cooking.  However I made it to use with Baked Ziti 1 from this site and it was so so good.  I will never buy jar sauce again.  While this is not the best marinara sauce out there it is much better than any jar sauce.  I did add another clove of garlic and italian seasoning instead of oregano and a few shakes of McCormicks Salad Supreme Seasoning.

My family really liked this sauce, I used it in meatball subs.  Next time I will add more garlic, mine came out a little tomatoey tangy.  The sauce is truly versatile, would be great for pasta and pizza.  I will definitely make this again.

This is my first time making a sauce from scratch and was very pleased with the results.  This will definitely be a staple in my home.  I added just a touch of sugar to it, but that's just a personal preference.  Very delicious.

Super recipe.  Using it and variations to bottle gravy with the many, many tomatoes from Dad's garden.  Try adding ground beef and replacing oregano with dried crushed rosemary and basil for a tangy meat sauce.

I made this sauce on 11 May 02. The only thing I added was a tsp. of basil..it needed the extra spice. It was really good and tasted very rustic. I am not going to buy jar sauce ever again. I can't believe how easy it was to make sauce from scratch.

Good sauce-made some variations though.  Added crushed red peppers, a thai chili, and dried basil to the food processor.  My husband likes chunky sauces, so cut the onions larger, added variety of mushrooms, as well as bell pepper and fresh tomato to the sautee.  Turned out great.

Loved the recipe.  My son, the picky eater, even ate it.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes in the house so I used two cans of diced tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion.  I also cut down the amount of olive oil and added a little sugar.  Will recommend this to everyone!
