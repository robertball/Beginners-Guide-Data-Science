I think the problem with this resipe is in the term  "chili sauce." If you make it with the cousin of cocktail sauce as people have been, I imagine it would be terrible. However, if you use more of a chili PASTE or a SAUCE MADE ONLY OF CHILIS, you get a very different result, spicy and delicious. I used a Vietnamese chili and garlic paste/sauce, and it was excellent. NOTE: DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF CHILI PASTE IF YOU WANT TO EAT IT!! A couple of tablespoons is plenty, even for us fire-mouthed southerners.

This was delicious! I tried it on a fluke because I had fish that I needed to use, and I am so glad that I did!  This is a regular favorite at my house now. You could use less rice and donâ€™t be surprised if you need to bake it longer. Also, I don't usually keep chili sauce on hand, so I made my own with tomato puree, chili powder, cumin, and a small amount of vegetable oil. Add Creole seasoning for extra flavor! Enjoy!

I liked this recipe, but I changed it a lot. I'll give you the details because my photo is currently the one up there.   I didnt have hot pepper sauce or chili sauce, so at that point in the recipe I added 1/4 cup tomato paste and about 4 tablespoon creole seasoning. I also used Whiting filets instead of cod and broiled the fish instead of baking, combining all three parts at the end. This is how I would make it again.

This recipe was really gross.  My husband says he can make anything taste good with hot sauce.  Well, I just found the first recipe that he couldn't!  We threw it out & had sandwiches.

well...I never had chili sauce before and I didn't know it was so much like cocktail sauce, which I can't stand. My boyfriend (who does like chili and cocktail sauces) didn't like this too much either. the sauce is really overpowering.

This went over well with my family for different reasons......my son enjoyed the rice, my husband liked the fish, I liked both the fish and the rice! I used swai, and I also used homemade chili sauce. I added tons of creole seasonings - Slap Yo Mama, Emerils, Old Bay, and extra Frank's hot sauce to make it nice and spicy. I think this would make a great rice sidedish too by leaving out the fish. We liked it well enough that I'll save the recipe and make it again.

Tried this on my crew and they loved it. Had to make recipe larger and hotter. Used rotel instead of chili sauce and tomatoes. Still very good.

Hmmm, it looks like chili sauce is a controversial ingredient. I happen to like it, and I used the plain old store brand, not an exotic import.
This was the first time I'd ever cooked fresh fish of any kind, I think, let alone cod, and I think it was a pretty tasty dish. I liked the sauce and light vegetables too. Two minor personal quibbles: I thought there was a little too much rice in proportion to the rest of the dish, so maybe I'll try it with 2 cups instead of 3 next time. And I still don't like tomato slices much, but I did eat the whole thing.

This is a wonderful recipe. The first time I made it I used 1/2 cup thai chili sauce and it was almost too spicey to eat. Since then I've experimented with 2 teaspoons thai chili sauce, hot sauce, and a ketchup/spice mix. I like it best with the spicey thai chili sauce but be careful how much you use.

this recipe would probably be better suited for chicken. I hated it, but my man liked it. the rice was super bland, and the fish didn't go w/ the sauce.  the sauce was really good, but i had to double the hot sauce to even taste it (guess it depends on the type of hot sauce). i won't make this again, but if i did i would reduce the amount of rice to 1 cup, increase the hot sauce and add about a tblsp of tony chachere's spice.

this was great! Thank you Wilma!  the fam doesn't get creative. we had fish and I wanted a bake so this was the outcome and they loved it.  I had no clue what chili sauce was but we always keep chili powder around a tsp of that and some extra hot sauce gave it a pretty good bite!

A good meal and satisfying, but just a tad bland for our tastes, even though I used a heavy hand on the spices.

This dish was pretty good.  I left out the hot sauces and just added chili powder to the white sauce instead.

My husband and I really enjoyed the dish as a whole. Next time I make it, I will make less rice, season the fish before cooking, and make more sauce.  Very delicious!

As previous raters have said, it's pretty bland.  I will give it another shot and use half the rice, an extra pepper, onion & celery.  Will make my own chili sauce also & add some saracha sauce.  We'll see what happens.

Not a flour fan and I think that was too much but following all the good reviews follow the recipe exactly as it is. Like other reviewer said, no matter what you put in it, still no flavor. No one like it. I won't make it again.

Had to make substitutions based on what we had available: a yellow pepper instead of green, made own chili sauce (4oz. tomato sauce, 1T brown sugar, 1T lemon juice, 1/8t dry mustard, chili powder & cajun seasoning).  Also sprinkled the fish lightly with cajun seasoning before putting in pan.  Really great meal and easy to make.

I was hungry for fish, so I found this recipe & was planning it for the next day's dinner.  But we went out that evening & I had fish.  Decided to try this with chicken instead, as one reviewer mentioned.  I have some harissa herb & spice mix, so am planning to use some as the chili sauce.
