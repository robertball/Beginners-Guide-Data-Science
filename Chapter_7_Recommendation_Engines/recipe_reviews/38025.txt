Thanks Kel! This is my family's favorite fish marinade. We use it for tilapia a lot as well as big sea scallops. We usually grill the fish after marinating. There isn't a thing I would change. The cumin and the cinnamon really make this awesome. I normally save the marinade and then boil it. I serve it with the fish. Goes great on basmati rice, particularly with all the chunks of roasted red pepper! I have serve this to guests and all have loved it.

Fantastic!  Skipped the traditional salad and served w/a fall salad of butternut squash (cubbed and grilled w/cumin, oo, salt, & pepper), black beans, corn, and diced red bell pepper and a side of rice..... absolutely wonderful.  Don't be afraid of the cinnamon and allspice. They add just the right touch of flavor.  This is going to be a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I left out the cinnamon and doubled the cumin.  It was great served over a mixed salad.  I topped mine with avocado, tomato and queso fresco.  I know they say fish and cheese dont mix, but it was wonderful in this salad!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

I agree with most of the above reviews.  I followed the recipe with the only exception being that I barbecued  the salmon instead of broiling it.  The salmon was nicely seasoned and moist and was delicious on top of the bed of lettuce, tomato and green onions.  I served the dish with Mexican white rice and homemade refried black beans.  Muy sabroso!

Followed the marinade ingredients to a 'T' and marinated the salmon filet for 2 hours before broiling as instructed...the flavors just didn't pop...guess I thought it would be more dramatic than it was based on the other reviewers comments and ratings.  Would not make again.

This recipe was excellent! I added a little chipotle to the marinade to make it a little more mexican.

Hmmm...We love salmon and eat alot of it since my heart attack a few years ago. I think I might pass on this recipe, maybe I didnt allow it to marinate long enough, needs longer than an hour. The flavors of the cinnamon, allspice and peppers didnt come through for us. I served it over Lime Rice and sauteed a few vegies as well. It dosen't sound or taste too mexican for this mexican. I will look for another Mexican Salmon or come up with my own. Thanks for the recipe though.

Incredibly good!  Made the recipe "as is" and grilled outside.  I admit to marinading for half the suggested time; I am not a big fan of a marinade taking over the food.  I served it without the tomatoes, onions and lettuce and found it could stand on its own!

Mexican salmon and avocado stuffed sweet potatoes and a pomegranate Margarita, round out a perfect meal. I make the salmon as directed, but marinate it for a few hours.

This is, by far, my favorite salmon recipe from this site. I went very heavy on the spices, left out the red peppers and marinated the salmon in the rub over night. Instead of broiling this, I baked it for about 20 minutes. I served this with a Calabacitas recipe from another site. I can't wait to try this spice mixture with other fish. Thanks

5 Star !!! I was looking for something different for salmon. This is it!! I prepared it for one person, me, so I put extra garlic in.  My grandson stopped by and had the last bite. He enjoyed the different flavors that are there. I have had this several times now and thoroughly LOVE it..

This was a lot better the day after it had been cooked. I felt that it allowed the flavors to come together well.

Thanks Kel for a great marinade recipe.  Will be making again and trying this on chicken (maybe even add to cooked rice) as well.  The adjusments I made for my family was to add a handful of chopped fresh cilantro, and double the spices. Also cut the oil to 2 tsp since salmon has plenty of natural fat. Baked it in the oven with the marinade still in the baking dish.

We'd give this 4.5 stars if we could. I made the full amount of topping/marinate (as directed)for use on two pieces of salmon. Unfortunately I marinated too long (about 5 hours so the fish was tough on the thinner ends, but the flavor was fantastic in the thicker parts of the filet). I used half to marinate the salmon in and half to top after flipping on the grill. I paired it with Mexican Orzo Salad and a nice Mexican beer.  Definitely a different recipe and one we'll have again.

Really good all the way around! I left out the allspice since I just don't much care for it but thats all I changed. Nice change of pace from our normal salmon!

A keeper!  I used the marinade to poach the salmon (added 1/2 c wine) and it was so delicious.  My husband said this was a restaurant quality dish.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this tonight and we loved it!  My husband said it was a "keeper".  I would like to have grilled it outside but it's @ 10 degrees in Michigan now.  I used some roasted red peppers that I made myself and I added a little red pepper flakes to the marinade.  I used another reviewers advice and reduced the marinade in a pan with a little white wine added.  The marinade was so good that I didn't add any lettuce, tomatoes or green onions at the end.  My husband suggested adding capers next time which I'll try.  Thanks Kel!!

This was surprisingly tasty. I ended up marinating it for 24 hours and found this unique blend of spices to be amazing. I am not the best cook and was confused by the direction of the red peppers. I wasn't too sure about what to do so I just sliced them up and used half the liquid in the jar. I also was confused about what to do with them after marinating them. It didn't seem right to have them sitting with raw fish and then eat them so I tossed the marinade and just served the fish with a nice blueberry salad. The dinner looked beautiful and tasted fabulous. Will absolutely make this again. I only gave it 4 stars because I was confused about the directions.

A good salmon recipe!  Flavor is not as strong as I would have liked.  But is very nice on salad, juice of salmon works as a dressing.

Easy, tasty and healthy. Used hot iron grill on skillet top and came out crunchy on outside moist inside.  Kitchen was pretty rank for a day.  But after airing out for a day was ok.  Worth it

My family wanted to try something different with salmon, so I opted for this. The flavor of the marinade wasn't too overpowering after marinating for an hour, and I thought that it really complemented the salmon. The only changes I made were to add a bit of cilantro and 1/4 tsp of chipotle powder to the marinade. I served it with some Puerto Rican rice and black beans, and it turned out really nice! Will be making again, thank you for the recipe!

I found the spices odd and more than a little off putting. Just thought the cinnamon and salmon was not a good combination. I won't be making this again.

This marinade is way good. I didn't use the peppers or the garlic. I used powder for both instead. I highly recommend making salmon tacos with this, topped with the mango salsa from this site. Way good!

Very good but I agree that the flavor was just a bit weak even though I ended up marinating it longer than it said to.  Maybe it lost some flavor because I grilled it instead of broiling? I will definitely try this recipe again, though, and try adding white wine or more spices.  It really is a very nice way to prepare salmon.

Excellent! Best Salmon recipe thus far!  Family wants me to make it at least once a week. I followed the recipe exactly but marinated fish for 2 hours.   I used a fork to pierce the salmon and the marinade flavors came through so well!

I roasted the peppers hours in advance. Baked at 250 for almost 2 hours. Cut them in half, sprayed baking dish with olive oil and turned them upside down every half hour until charred. Then cut into pieces, added 2 tablespoons of olive oil and let them marinade in a bowl.

Served on top of a spring mix with green onions, cherry tomatoes and avocados.

I dont like fish but this was fantastic. I baked it in the oven for around 15/20 min at around 175C and it was fantastic.

Absolutely delicious. I made a few tweaks but it was delic! I don't like roasted red peppers so I omitted that and because the liquid  was used for this recipe I just added an extra half of lime juice and about 2 1/2 tbsp water. Also I didn't have any allspice (darnit) I just added a sprinkle more cumin and cinnamon. The hubby LOVED this dish, raved about it all night, he even cleaned the kitchen after dinner. I did like another poster said and boiled the marinade, after adding a little onion and cilantro, drizzled just a little on top, perfection. I didn't make the salad thing either, but I found another recipe on here for a bean corn and rice concoction and it was a smashing meal.
