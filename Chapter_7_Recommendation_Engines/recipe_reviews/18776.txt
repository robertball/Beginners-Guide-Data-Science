This was very good, although I was expecting it to taste more authentic, tasted jult like a roast to me. It was very good in a burrito with beans and all the fixins, this helped a lot with the taste better than on its own.

I really thought this recipe would be hotter than it is, but my husband and I both thought it was great.  We used the meat to make soft tacos, but I am already looking to try new recipes with it.  The meat has a mild smoky flavor.

I added some cayenne pepper and cumin to the mix and marinated stew beef overnight.  The meat was delicious and I used it as a base for making burritos verde.  I think the meat could be a great base for lots of recipes from tamales to chili.  Thanks for the guide!!!!

I have never had carne adovada with lemon juice in it.  Although purists out here insist on just the red chilis and water to make "red sauce", I usually add onion, garlic, cumin and a dash of salt, and use chicken bouillion cubes to flavor the water.  Some people add tomato sauce - I recommend against it.  Use a fatty roast if you are going to slow cook it, like a picnic, so that it stays juicy.  This is definitely not a good recipe for a pork loin.  Adovada is good on sandwiches, tacos, burritos, for making tamales, and by itself.  You don't really need to dress it with lettuce, tomato, cheese etc.

I tried it with a pork loin roast and marinated it for about 12-13 hours. I also added onions and green chilis to it. It wasn't spicy to my husband or me, but we really enjoyed it.

I added some fresh, minced garlic to the marinade, yet the meat still tasted like a regular roast.  I didn't cook the meat in the marinade, but was wondering was I supposed too?  I did add some extra chili powder and garlic to the crock pot...  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste very latin.  Probably will make this again, except with some extreme doctoring.

The marinade benefits from adding cumin and garlic (fresh or powdered).

Considering this recipe calls for 3/4 chile powder, it is amazingly tasteless.  It needs severe doctoring.  The only good thing about this recipe is the ease of preparation.

Not bad at all, but I'm still searching for the PERFECT adavada.

I have used the recipe repeatedly for karate nights when it is too late to cook.  My whole family loves it, we have had it both with beef or pork and it works just as well,some times I just leave the meat whole, it shreds easily by the time we eat.  I have also shared this one with a number of people.

I am surprised that 3/4 cup of chili powder leaves this recipe so tasteless.  Definitely needed some doctoring.

good recipe! The only thing I did differently was add some canned chipoltles for kick,set some thick slices of onion on the bottom of the slow cooker, used beef broth instead of water and top the meat with some lemon slices for acid. Turned out really great.

Fairly easy to do and a great use for chuck roasts.  Easy to add things and get the flavour you want.

This is a fairly good and easy recipe to make.  I used a whole roast, shredded it, then ended up adding almost a whole pkg of taco seasoning. Just didn't have enough taste without it.  After we added the taco seasoning it was great!!  Makes a lot so plan on freezes some for future use.

My family and I really enjoyed the flavor of the meat. I read a few other reviews and added onions, potatoes and salt. The reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating is because of the affect it had on the bowels. I will not be making this dish again!

I agree with most of the reviewers, not a lot of flavor.  We ended  up adding a packet of taco seasoning to spice it up a bit.  A good base, but it needs some extra flavor.

I lived in southern california most of my life and I had never heard of carne adovada, maybe it's a southwest thing (az, nm, tx) but I have been making this for quite a few years and I have to say to everyone saying it was bland or not spicy enough that the chile powder you buy MATTERS! if you get dollar store chile powder, it won't have the same kick as if you buy the New Mexico powder that is called for in the recipe. I usually buy it in the bag in the Hispanic foods section as I've found that has more kick than the jarred versions.
