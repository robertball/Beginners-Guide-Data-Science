I modify the recipe a bit, by putting the potatoes on a foil lined cookie sheet with a wire rack holding the chicken placed over the top. This allows the drippings to flavor the potatoes and chicken to crisp up on all sides.

I am not a fan of bacon wrapped but these were yummy. The trick is to not wrap the whole chicken pieces(I used thighs only) I cut the bacon in half and draped one or two halves over each thigh, thus allowing the bacon to be crispy, not soggy. I also added carrots. Turned out yummy.

My husband would give this 5 stars the way he ate it but it differed from the original recipe based on the others' comments on here.  I used the frozen chicken breasts from a bag (still frozen).  I covered the chicken with slices of bacon instead of wrapping them.  I used cubed red potatoes and sprayed them and the onions with olive oil before cooking.  I seasoned with dried rosemary, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I baked it at 400 degrees and it only took 40 minutes to cook! At serving time I sprinkled reduced fat Feta cheese on top!  Delicious!!

I love this recipe so much. It is seriously the best tasting recipe for being so easy and simple. I only cook with chicken breasts since my fiancé and I are not big fans of dark meat, so that is what I used. There are so many reasons why I love this recipe so... the first being that I only have to dirty 1 PAN ONLY while cooking!! OMG!! Another reason is that you can toss in whatever spices you feel like. I made my own seasoning mix which included some paprika, garlic powder, thyme, basil, oregano, rosemary, parsley, salt, and a little bit of black pepper. I also drizzled over some olive oil. I popped it in the oven for like an hour or so, and the chicken came out super moist/juicy and the potatoes were fantastic. You can't really go wrong with the seasoning mix, so you could pretty much just use whatever you have on hand. I used a little bit of everything and it seasoned the potatoes and meat perfectly. :) Highly recommend this!

Great basic recipe idea... I made some alterations. Chicken breast cutlets with regular bacon slices layed on top of them, red potatoes(cubed), cover the whole thing with chopped onions and a mixture of granulated garlic, italian seasoning, and adobo. Baked at 375 for about 45 minutes... bacon was nice and crisp, potatoes were soft, Perfect!!!

Excellent.  I used white meat for the chicken it was great.  If corn is in season a little corn on the cob and another veggie and you got your self a nice meal.

I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken drumsticks- and this recipe is a keeper!  I skinned the chicken, used regular peeled potatoes (didn't have yukon gold), and it turned out delicious.  I did toss the potatoes in a little Italian dressing as someone else suggested because I was afraid the potatoes would dry out without any liquid in the dish.  My kids and husband loved it- no leftovers!

First of all, bacon makes almost anything delicious.  I changed it up a bit by using all drumsticks, because this is the easiest to eat for the children, and I also used a different blend of spices including a variety of peppers, garlic, and seasoned salt.  I also used regular baking potatoes cut into large cubes and this seemed to work well.  The end result was fantastic.  I would have never thought to use bacon with chicken on the bone if not for this recipe.  Thanks!

Very good.  My family likes white meat so I used large skinless boneless breasts which I soaked in a brining solution for about 3 hours.  I added carrots and portabello mushrooms.  Gave the potatoes and other vegies a quick toss in italian dressing (just a little).  SO good - the entire family loved it.

Pretty easy.  I just threw this together with what I had lying around.  A couple of chicken breasts, a half pack of regular bacon, and regular russets and an onion.  It still turned out great.  Really easy.

This recipe was awesome.  I can't use pepper, so I just didn't put any and it still tasted great.   BTW, Adobe seasoning can be found in the Goya section of the supermarket.  It is an blend of garlic, oregano peppercorns, paprika and salt.  If you can't find it, here's what to do:    Adobo Seasoning   4 cloves garlic  1 teaspoon dried oregano  1 teaspoon peppercorns  1/2 teaspoon paprika  1 teaspoon salt   Grind all the ingredients together in a mortar and pestle to make a paste.  Hope this helps.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Here's the deal...I didn't really follow the recipe almost at all.  BUT I am a serious beginner when it comes to cooking, especially spontaneously, but tonight was feeling a little risky (haha) and had some chicken breasts, some bacon and potatoes and remembered having once eaten bacon wrapped chicken.  So when searching on allrecipes i stumbled across this and was inspired.  I had three breasts that i halved and wrapped in one piece of bacon and then layed in a baking pan (same one i would use for a cake), then tossed some potatoe slices in a little bit of olive oil and just put some rosemary and garlic powder on them and lined the pan with the potatoes.  I cooked at 400 for an hour (but turned the breasts at 40 minutes).  My boyfriend literally said "This is the best dinner this year."  I know it's only February...but still, he loved it.  It was perfect and so easy and had it not been for this recipe i wouldn't have had the courage to try it.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

Delicious, simple, and a bit elegant. It will impress company, but is easy to make, even for someone who's never worked with chicken legs before (like me!). I left the black pepper out of this dish. The amount called for is way too much, and adobo already has pepper in it. When serving, pull the chicken out first, and then stir the potatoes around in the drippings and seasoning left behind, getting them all nice and coated. Yum!

Only used boneless thighs (what was on sale), totally wrapped each thigh with the bacon, set on a backing rack over pealed cut yukon golds, chunks of leeks, and halved brussel sprouts that had been tossed with a bit of olive oil.  Made a version of Traci’s Adobo seasoning mix which went over both veggies and chicken before wrapped in the bacon.  Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, then turned over chicken bundles to avoid soggy bacon and baked for another  30 minutes.  It came out great, though next time won’t use the rack, will place bundles directly on the veggies and still turn halfway, think it will give veggies even better flavor. Will be using this often, thanks for the quick and easy dinner.

This dish met expectations, but there was no wow factor, hence the 3 star rating.  It is something simple and quick to make.  I made the following modifications:  1) used all drumsticks 2) used red potatoes (marinated them in Italian dressing) 3) layed the bacon on top instead of wrapping the drumsticks to allow for both the bacon and chicken to crisp.  Served with Goya Red Beans & Rice, Corn on the Cob, and String beans.  The children and hubby enjoyed it.  Will keep this in my circulation of meals to cook.

I parboiled the potatoes first and I also put the seasonings on the chicken before the bacon.  Very tasty. THX

To make room for more veggies I used only drumsticks, no thighs.  I cut the seasonings in half and it still seemed like a lot.  I will go with even less next time. I added some brussels sprouts, they came out PERFECT.  After reading the other reviews I decided to try the bacon both ways, wrapped and on top. Will definitely ONLY lay it on top next time.  Wrapping it around the chicken made it so neither of them got crispy, which we prefer.

Incredible Dinner.  I have incredibly picky kids and the surprising thing was that there was not even crumbs left of this.  They raved about it all night!  This is definitely a first for me!  I didn't have some of the spices, so the only thing different I did was add fresh garlic and about a half of stick of butter about an hour into baking and topped with cheese.  Delicious!!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts for this.  I also did not wrap the breasts, but laid the bacon across them.  This was tasty but the potatoes did stick to the pan. I think next time I will spray the dish with cooking spray or try it in my stoneware baking dish.  Not a bad recipe.  I did cook at 375 degrees for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

My family LOVED this.  I wrapped the bacon around the chicken but will lay it on top next time.   I was so scared it wasnt finished on the bottom.  My 8 year old twins really loved this.  Great recipe, thank you!!

I have made this a few times, and I love the concept.  I use a package of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, usually containing eight pieces.  I season these on both sides with garlic salt and cracked pepper, top each with half piece of bacon. Potatos are tossed with the same   seasonings in a sepatate pan, with extra virgin olive oil.
Cook in  preheated 375 degree oven for 45 minutes, then down to 325 for 15  to finish cooking. The color and flavor are amazing.
Terrific recipe!

I just made this tonight. It's delicious but I would suggest making the following changes: after wrapping chicken with bacon, drizzle with olive oil so it won't be too dry. Also, I am going to try broiling it next time for about 10 mins after I bake it because the bottom wasn't very done and the bacon wasn't as crispy as it could be. Overall, it is a delicious and relatively easy recipe. And you can change the seasonings up to bring out different flavors in the dish. It's really really good! I will definitely keep making this!!

Yummy! I didn't have adobo seasoning on hand, so I added dashes of paprika, oregano, garlic, pepper, onion powder, and cumin. My pickiest eater even gobbled it up. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was so so good. I followed some of the other reviews.  I cut up the bacon into small cubes and fried it to get the oil out.  Instead of putting the dish in the oven I did it on the stove top put in the chicken first and sauted it for a couple of mins and then added the seasoning, onions, some of the bacon, potatoes, carrots and the rest of the bacon with more seasoning.  My whole family loved it.

I made this dish with everything except the bacon and it was delicious. I personally don't like bacon. A bit on the spicy side but nothing I couldn't handle. Will make again.

Well I liked it, but my hubby didn't because the skin didn't get crispy under the bacon.  He says it's a texture thing -- doesn't like slimy chicken skin.  So I might try this again with skinless chicken.  I put bacon only on top instead of wrapping it around the chicken to avoid slimy bacon.

Delish! Didn't give it 5 stars because of my tweaks. I divided chicken breast into 4 pieces and wrapped each in a piece of bacon (precooked halfway so bacon would be done with chicken). Also put slit in each piece of chicken and inserted a slice of garlic. Also doused chicken with worcestire sauce before wrapping. Everything else the same without onions and boom amazing! Thanks for the recipe the seasoning was awesome.

I made this dish wth reservations due to chicken fat and I am not really a dark meat fan, but my friend who cannot cook so I do it loves legs and thighs. It was soooo easy, look up a recipe to make your own dry adobo here on allrecipes. it smelled wonderful cooking. When I served dinner, I was expecting grease soaked potatoes and greasy chicken. But the cooking time and temp kind of renders the bacon and chicken fat , not greasy in the slightest. It was wonderful, my friend bought more chicken and bacon and has had me make it again and pachage lil meals for her. When I made it for her I also adapted it to my own dietary needsand cooked it along witth hers, using bonelesss skinlss breasts cut in strips about hot dog size and used turkey bacon. I am diabetic and avoid certain thiings. We both tried the white meat stuff and it was amazing, not dry and tasteless like most chicken breasts but tender and juicy and wonderful. next time i am going to try mine with sweet potatoes as I really should avoid white potatoes. wonderful recipe and very easy to adopt to my condition. would be a great hors douevre in smaller pieces on tooth picks. thanks for the great stuff  fatjulie

This was a really good recipe; a definite keeper. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and cut up russet potatoes (it's what I had in the house) and it turned out pretty good. However, I will make some adjustments next time. 1) I will rub part of the spice mixture on the chicken before laying pieces of bacon over it. 2) I will toss the potatoes and onion with the spice mixture before placing them in the dish around the chicken. 3) I will reduce the amount of spice mixture - this makes too much. A little goes a long way!

We loathe dark meat so I used organic ckn breasts.  I wrapped entire breast in peppered thick-cut bacon.  Sprinkled it tabasco, onion & garlic powder, red HI sea salt and 3 peppercorn fresh cracked pepper.  Didn't like the 'seasoning mix' in recipe, used hubby's favs.  In plastic bag put shot of olive oil, onion & garlic powder, thyme, crushed rosemary and red HI sea salt and 3 peppercorn fresh cracked pepper with small sliced baking taters (only ones I had).  Let them marinate a couple hours.  Baked in 2 separate pans, didn't want bacon fat in potatoes, came out wonderful!

Oh, YUM! Thanks, CFcooks! As recommended below, I laid the bacon over the chicken pieces rather than actually wrap them, and got some good crisping. The spice mixture worked very well with the bacon, chicken and the potatoes (chunks of regular Yukon Gold) as well. Served this to my sister as a Thanksgiving dinner, along with butternut squash, tossed salad and pumpkin cheesecake and she loved it, too - said to put a gold star on the recipe! Thanks again!

Two "yums" up! This recipe is awesome!  Used regular bacon, and there was no problem with the potatoes being dry.  Also covered with foil, to stop splattering in oven. Thought the seasoning mixture would be too spicy, but it was just right.  Highly recommend lining your 9x13 with parchment paper before adding chicken, etc, to make clean-up easier.  Many thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious and the hubby likes it enough that he said I can make it again! Haha! Yay! I used just drumsticks, with skin cut off and wrapped one piece of bacon around each drumstick. I thought the seasoning was a bit on the salty side but other than that was good. I usually taste test to check for saltiness, etc, but this time decided to just follow the recipe. Maybe my adobo seasoning was too salty? Definitely a keeper though!

My family liked it but needs a few tweaks. First the recipe does not say to remove the skin. I did not /the skin does not come out crispy. The bacon on top came out crispy and the bottom did not...should. turn over halfway. Lastly there is too much salt between the seasoning and the bacon.

Yummy!  This recipe is a keeper.  The only change I made was to use red potatoes and cut them in wedges.  Everything was done to perfection in the amount of time specified in the recipe.

Tasted great but bacon didn't crisp on the bottom and was a little too greasy. Would make this again but just place the bacon on top next time.

It was a good dinner. Something tells me this would be a good breakfast dish. I de-boned my chicken thighs and cut them into chunks with chopped bacon and the potatos quartered. It did take more than an hour to cook, even cut up, so after the 1st hour I switched to the broiler. 10 min or so then mix the medley and another 10 min or so. Served with ketchup.

Wow!!! This was incredible. I made it according to the directions using skinless thighs and drumsticks. I used russets because it was all I had. I also used seasoning salt instead of adobo as I did not have any. This was the juiciest chicken I've ever had. I'm not a dark meat fan but this rocked.

So easy to make and good! I didn't wrap the whole thing in bacon, just draped it over so it would not get soggy. I don't have adovo so I have used garlic and onion powder once and dry ranch powder. Great both times. Such a clever recipe because there is basically NO CLEANUP! Boyfriend loved it and it was so easy to make!

I would give 5 stars, but I do agree with other reviewers - the bacon is soggy.  This is what I did, used 4 chicken breast.  Rubbed chicken breast with 1/4 of the season mix.  Then covered with 3 bacon strips a piece.  Sprinkled onions.  Then in a separate bowl - tossed the potatoes with the rest of the seasoning mix.   Baked covered 1/2 hour covered in foil.  Baked another 40 min uncovered.  Then I took off the bacon and broiled it for a few minutes to crisp up the bacon.  The chicken was SO tender.  Very flavorful - I recommend!!!  My son and husband LOVED this!

I found this meal to be too greasy just as directed.  I would recommend removing the chicken skin, just covering the chicken with bacon instead of covering it, and using chicken breasts.

My fiance called this  a mans meal :) He loved it!! I used chicken breasts and drizzled with E.V. olive oil. The second time we boiled the potatoes some first, and they came out very tender. We even make a pan of just potatoes because we run out when trying to feed 5-6 people. I am always looking for interesting chicken recipes for him, and this is one he requests over and over!  Thanks!!

This was great.  Highly recommend it. The entire family loved it - kids included. Not one potato or piece of chicken was left.  I used thighs and legs and swapped fresh chives vs. dried. I also drizzled a little olive oil on the chicken to help it crisp up. Chicken was moist and tender. Potatoes full of flavor.

I made this tonight. I added asparagus seasoned with sea salt, cracked pepper and garlic powder. I laid them over the top of the chicken and potatoes the  last 25 min. It turned out awesome! The whole family loved it. Will defiantly make it again. Maybe with brussel sprouts. Hmm.

This was just okay. I used boneless skinless breast and by the chicken was done, the potatoes were not.  I moved the chicken to another dish and finished the potatoes, but the chicken ended up a little dry.  The onions never cooked through. The seasoning mix wasn't anything special.

This is a great recipe. I have cooked this several times already. I did add carrots,orange bell peppers and sliced up an onion into medium sized pieces.Tuck the onion pieces underneath and in between the chicken so the do not burn. During the last 15-20 minutes of baking I drizzled a little bit of honey over the vegetables. Very tasty!!!!!!!!

Looks good, smells good and the potatoes taste good.  However, this dish has currently been in the oven for an hour and a half and the chicken is still pinkish.

I made this dish last night and WILL AGAIN !!  I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and regular idaho potatoes cut up into chunks and used Zatarain's creole seasoning and garlic salt and black pepper , and i added a little water so it would not burn or dry out . And my bacon came out very crispy !!! The flavors were really good and i didn't have alot of grease. I served it with green salad .Next time i am going to add whole green beans and carrots with some Italian salad dressing .. maybe sprinkle cheese on top ...

Was excellent. The flavour was amazing. Will def be making this. The only difference I would make would be to boil the potatoes for about 10 mins before baking as they were a little undone. I have no idea what adobe seasoning is, so didn't add that, but added a bit of dried oregano also. I drizzled olive oil on top before baking.

Very good recipe.  I used skinless, boneless thighs in one pan, draping the bacon over the top as others suggested, and cubing the potatoes.  In another pan, I used boneless, skinless tenderloins for the white meat lovers.  For this pan, I sliced the potatoes very thin, as the tenderloins cook more quickly.  Loved the potatoes sliced that way. I did not have chives, so subbed onion powder instead.  Went easy on the pepper for the kids.  Love that it is quick, easy, and light on the cleanup end.  Thanks!

Tried this tonight for my boyfriend and myself.  I happened to have both breasts and boneless thighs so I thought I would try them both to see if we preferred one over the other.  Well....they were both delicious!  I used a full piece of bacon on each piece and it turned out crispy on the outside and moist inside....pretty amazing!  The potatoes were some of the best that we have ever had.  I was worried that they would be greasy but much to my suprise they weren't at all.  In fact, they too, were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I used the oregano, paprika, garlic salt, pepper, thyme and parsley mix as the seasoning and it was wonderul.  We will definitely be having this again.

looks and sounds great but don't have adobo seasoning - have never heard of it.  Does anyone know how to make it yourself?  Am going to rate it 4 until I actually make it.  Can never go wrong with chicken

This was a real hit for my family (including 5 & 2yo).  I was a little nervous because the seasoning mix seemed like an odd combination, esp. once the bacon was added.  I am SO glad I tried this though!!  I used bone-in chicken breasts and less cooking time (40ish minutes).  Next time I will put some of the seasoning mix directly onto the chicken and let it sit for a couple hours before cooking--the very top of the chicken had good flavor but it didn't extend very far down.

This turned out really yummy! I used Idaho potatoes and roasted my chicken above them  on a wire rack. Like other reviewers said,  you can really use what ever seasoning you like and not be wrong.  Only problem I encountered was the potatoes were a little burnt,  next time I will toss them with a little oil and stir halfway thru cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was spectacular and easy to cook. My husband really loved it. I used a chicken breast cut in half down the center, which took 2 strips of bacon per half to wrap. For the seasoning, I used salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and dill. Then, I drizzled olive oil over everything. I was only making 2 servings, so baked for 40 minutes at 400.

Cook on drying rack. This recipe sounded great, but I should have elevated the chicken over the pan on a drying rack like some revieweres recommended. Instead the chicken was basically boiled in bacon fat and the result was soggy fatty chicken and bacon. It was pretty disgusting, although the potatoes were delicious.
I will try this recipe again using the baking rack method and provide an updated review.

This dish was so yummy! Even the kids enjoyed it, and that's saying something. Next time, I think I'll cut back on the garlic. Other than that, it was really good. The chicken was moist and the potatoes came out perfectly.

I made the chicken itself exactly as written--I did not make the potatoes.  I agree with a number of other reviewers that putting the bacon only on top might be a better option than wrapping the strips all the way around.  Prepared and baked as the recipe was written, the portion of bacon on the bottom was moderately cooked but not near enough for satisfaction. The spice mix was nice, although I wouldn't say I was ecstatic about it.  I will absolutely season the thighs on both sides with salt & pepper before dressing with bacon and the seasoning mixture the next go-round.

this was absolutely amazing.. i cut the recipe in half b/c we only had 5 drumsticks.. used russet potatoes for the dutch yellow.. i don't carry dried chives or adobo seasoning so i used about 1 tsp of onion powder and regular chili powder.. reduced the pepper to 1 tsp.. added 1 tsp of salt to the seasoning mix and didn't add any on the finished product.. cut up the potatoes and onion and then spritzed them with some veggie oil.. took the skins off the chicken.. threw everything in a large ziplock and shook around.. laid the potatoes/onions on the bottom of the dish.. wrapped the bacon around the drumsticks and placed right on top.. flipped them over after 30 min's.. they were done in about 45.. ty so much for the recipe

This is a good recipe. My son (19) said it was the best chicken he ever ate! I used boneless, skinless breasts. I wrapped the pieces completely in bacon. I didn't use other ingredients, but used some commercial grilling seasoning that I had on hand. I sprinkled the seasoning on top of bacon-wrapped chicken.  After 40 minutes, I drained juices from baking dish and turned the chicken to allow bacon to crisp on both sides.  At that point I also sprinkled seasoning on that side. I also tossed cut, russet potatoes and onions with Italian dressing, covered with aluminum foil and baked  in a separate dish.   The chicken was moist and tender, and the bacon was perfectly done.  It was a bit salty to me, but my other family members didn't agree.  Could have been the commercial blend I used.  Honestly, salt and pepper would probably have sufficed. I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was really delicious! There were no leftovers even though we made too much. The only minor downside was that my guy likes his bacon crispy, and here the bacon was more tender and less crispy. The seasoning tasted spectacular, and overall it was a great meal... will make this again.

This was wonderful. I used all thighs, and wrapped them with smokey bacon. I also patted each thigh with salt and pepper before I wrapped it with bacon. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It was wonderful, even my 7, 5, and 2 year old loved it. I couldn't get enough, and my kids still say that was the best dinner.

dont forget to season....idea...put the potatoes diced in a ziplock with the seasonings, shake and cover all the potatoes with them...dont forget to use the salt. i was worried the bacon being salty itself would be too much so i used less....it still needed it. also sprayed the potatoes with butter flavored spray so they wouldn't burn during cooking. we also broiled the chicken covered bacon by itself because it wasn't  completely crisp...pulled them out and made the bacon beautifully crispy on a cookie sheet until done to perfection.....the potatoes and chicken were perfect together...

I really loved the idea of this, but it did not meet my expectations.  The dish was very dry despite the potatoes not being fully cooked and they were definitely cut small enough.  I think that if I were to do this one again I would cover it to start and add some moisture - then remove the cover and let the bacon crisp up. Again, good idea with a few tweaks.

Absolutely delicious, and the potatoes came out very tender.  I followed the advice by other commenters and covered the tops of the chicken with the bacon rather than wrapping it.

This chicken was awesome and my husband loved it!  I changed a few things based on other reviews and our preferences.  I used chicken breasts and wrapped the bacon completely around them (about 2 strips per breast).  I used just regular baking potatoes cut into chunks.  I first put the chicken in the pan with the potatoes but I noticed that the bacon wasn't crisping like I wanted it to so I took the chicken out and put it on a rack above the potatoes for about the last 10 minutes of cooking.  The potatoes were the best part!!  I thought that they'd be overwhelmingly greasy from the bacon grease but they weren't and ended up perfectly flavored.  Oh, I also used different seasonings, just garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, and paprika.  The only thing I will do differently the next time I make it will be to season the chicken before I wrap it in the bacon.  I got a little excited to wrap the chicken and didn't even think about it.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious. Made with breasts, cooked in 45 minutes at 400. Used the idea to place chicken on a wire rack above potatoes. The bacon drippings made the potatoes extra flavorful and not greasy at all. I placed three thick bacon strips over each breast and served with honey mustard sauce. Killer. Might baste with mustard sauce under the bacon next time. And there will be a next time!

I used regular potatoes and cut them similar to home fries.  They took nearly 2 hrs to cook.  Bacon was still not crispy.  Maybe a larger pan?  I did not have adobo seasoning but went online and it seems it is mostly more of the same seasonings plus some onion powder and oregano so I made my own.  I actually only used 4 legs and left the seasonings the same.  This was not bad but I will not likely make it again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great!  I made a few changes.  The recipe calls for adobo seasoning, which I didn't have so I used Traci's Adobo Seasoning recipe from this sight-leaving out the onion powder because I didn't have any and cutting the salt by 1/2 tbsp.  I used boneless chicken breast and instead of wrapping the bacon around it, I just covered the top of the chicken.  The only part of the seasoning mix I used was adobo seasoning.  Honestly, I forgot about the rest of them.  I sprinkled the adobo over the top, seasoning to taste.  It was fantastic and so easy to make.  The chicken came out moist, the bacon crispy, and the potatoes were perfectly seasoned.  Thank you for a great recipe.

As the only one in our family that doesn't like chicken, I loved this dinner! It was delicious and very easy. This will be a regular.

Like so many people do, I changed a few things. Mine was on a much smaller scale, I used fresh herbs, regular and elephant garlic, and I ran out of room for the potatoes. Possibly because I left the potatoes out, the other veggies came out really greasy. Next time, I'm going to include the potatoes! And if that doesn't work... maybe rice? Either way, the chicken was AMAZING!

Really good. NOT BLAND!!! People commented on grease....I dont eat bacon-bacon, I eat turkey bacon and thats what I used and had no grease.  I also draped the bacon on top of the chicken instead of wrapping all the way around.  I used regular potatos (3 large) and 6 drumsticks total meat ingredient, in a 9x13 pan.  It is better to use 2 potatos, for a good potato to chicken ratio (if you only use 6 drumsticks). Did everything accoring to the directions and it was d-lish :)

tasted awsome.  I made this for my wife and kids.  Everyone enjoyed it, except that it was a little too greasy.  Maybe that was just the type of bacon used.  Definetly enjoyed this recipe.  I altered the recipe and didn't use the spices it called for.  used garlic and onion medley seasoning, brown pepper and salt that was it.

I used skinless chicken thighs for this one.  I had bacon that didn't have alot of fat on it so I basted this with the pan drippings about three times during the cooking process.  Bacon acted as second skin, chicken was tender and flavorful...loved it!

Wonderful. I used Traci's Adobo Seasoning Recipe from this site. It turned out great. Also, I cut the bacon and draped it over the top as some other reviewers suggested. I used thick sliced black pepper bacon and it was amazing. I only had a couple of large baking potatoes on hand so I diced those up and added them. I think you could add just about any vegetable and roast along with the chicken. Yum! Thanks for sharing.

Easy, yummy, quick!  I used all thighs with skins removed, about seven pieces of bacon and red potatoes. Otherwise I followed the recipe.  The seasoning is really good, my salt-loving family was happy with less than half of it on top.  Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good, if you like a dry-rub type seasoning.  My husband ate seconds, my son ate all of his.  We used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs and drumsticks.  I served this with spinach.

YUM!!!  My family loved this....it smelled so good baking.  It was an unusually quite dinner table tonight as they happily ate!  We ALWAYS eat white meat but I'd bought some drumsticks on sale and tried them with this recipe.  My kids LOVED it!!!  I had one piece of bacon left over and so I chopped it up and added it to the potatoes/onion.  It was wonderful.....and sooooo easy to put together.  Thank you!!

This was really good. I just made the chicken without the potatoes this time because I had leftover baked potatoes from the night before. I used all thighs, removed the skin, and layered the bacon on top of the thighs as other reviewers suggested. I sprinkled the seasoning blend over the top, and the chicken was juicy and the bacon crisp after 50 minutes. The juices were delicious with crusty dinner rolls. Can't wait to try it again with the potatoes!

This was unusual, easy and delicious! I made the recipe as written except that (1) I didn't have chives so I left them out (and didn't miss them), and (2) I soaked the chicken parts in brine (1 Tbsp. salt for each cup of cold water) for half an hour before preparing. (That makes a huge difference ... however you're preparing your chicken!) Loved it with the dark meat.  (Note to others who, like I did, may have trouble finding Adobo seasoning: it's in the Spanish section of the grocery! Famous Spanish brand name ... ) Addendum: I found that this is EVEN BETTER when reheated in the juices the next day!

This was pretty good.  The bacon really needs to be ON TOP of chicken or it will be soggy.  Used breasts and legs and both were fine.  Added carrots.  Also added asparagus seasoned with olive oil and seasoning salt on top the last 10 minutes or so.   Total cooking time 45 minutes for me.

I love this recipe.  I forgot the onion and it was still great.  I skinned the chicken before baking and it was incredibly moist and tender.  The potatoes were awesome too.  I normally follow a recipe exactly the first time and if I think it has potential to work for my family I'll make the neccessary adjustments the next time.  Here though I read the reviews and added a little water, because I agreed with some others that it appeared dry before it went into the oven.  It really did not need the extra water and I wish I had just left the recipe alone.  This one needs very little tweeking.  Excellent, will definately make it again.

Easy one dish meal. Used chicken thighs only. Did not have adobo seasoning so I used Lemon Pepper on the chicken prior to wrapping with the bacon and Italian seasonings on the potatoes. Will make this dish again but will remove the chicken skin.

I changed the recipe a little but was still a delight. I only made mine with small pieces of chicken thighs and prepared them with cajun seasoning. I also filled them up with cheddar cheese and wrapped them with bacon and toothpicks. The potatoes were also flavored with cajun seasoning and sprinkled with cheddar cheese. Once the chicken and the potatoes were all set to go into the oven, I sprinkled the batch with italian seasoning to give it an extra touch of flavor. Finally, once they were done, I added mushroom cream into each particular dish before serving. In conclusion, DELICIOUS!!!!

This was very delicious. So glad that I finally made it. I didn't have adobo or the chives. I used chili powder and seasoned salt in place of the adobo seasoning. I also added cayenne powder for a little kick. I thought the bacon was cooked perfect and so were the potatoes. The bacon wasn't crispy but it was very good!! Will make this again thanks. I did have to use two pans a 9X13 and a smaller casserole dish and I only had 4 thighs and 5 drumsticks. Sooo good!

I used frozen chicken breasts and it came out great.  I tossed my cubed potatoes and onions with some fiesta ranch dressing mix (dry).  I also did not "wrap" my bacon, choosing instead to lay slices of bacon on top of the chicken.  I placed the dish under the broiler for a few minutes about 20 minutes before it was done to crisp up the bacon.  I added a mixture of colby and monterey jack cheese since we love cheese; mixed in half with the potatoes and then sprinkled the other half during the last 10 minutes of baking.  I served it with sour cream with green onion mixed in.  YUM!

Very bland. I should have added browning to give the chicken some color. I ended up using Diana sauce to give it some taste, as well as some green, red, and yellow peppers to give it some visual appeal. Disappointing.

I made this using peppered centered cut bacon so I didn't use any other pepper in this recipe . I also made my own adobo seasoning using Traci's Adobo Seasoning Recipe from Allrecipes. I left out the dried chives too(didn't have it) Also just used Russet potatoes and cut them into smaller pieces. Family loved it.. Turned out amazing. Next time I will make some without the peppered Bacon. My kids under five said it was a little too spicy for them. All in all... super easy and tastes great!

Great recipe! I only had 8 drumsticks and 6 slices of bacon on hand. Stretched a couple slices, cut them in half and it was fine. Made home-made abobo minus the cumin and used both fresh and dried oregano and fresh basil.   I used two cans of new potatoes .  I put a little bit of the seasoning on the chicken before wrapping it with bacon.  So good!  Whole family loved it! Thank you!!

This is great stuff as is, but I changed it up a bit, too! I wrapped two slices of bacon around each piece of chicken and cubed three potatoes. I transferred  the chicken and potatoes to another glass pan at forty-five minutes and put it back in the oven for fifteen minutes. The bacon grease was poured in with the fresh green beans that were simmering. As I stated....great stuff!!!

Very good. Used boneless skinless thighs.  Brushed olive oil on potatoes and about halfway through poured a bit of chicken broth over potatoes.  Baked at 350 for one hour.  Didn’t cover.  Just layer bacon on top of chicken.  Didn’t wrap it.

This was super easy and very good. I used chicken breast instead of legs/thighs so  it came out a teeeeeny bit dry. I'm sure if you use the recipe how it is written, it would be perfect. The seasoning was very good.

this was AMAZING!  I didn't have Adobo so I just added paprika and ground oregano to the spice mixture, there was enough black pepper and garlic in it for us already. I used boneless, skinless thighs and 'crisped' them under the broiler for a minute before serving.  Baby red potatoes was all I had, the gold potatoes may have made a prettier presentation but when a dish tastes this good, who cares!!!

I don't understand how so many people rate a recipe after they make changes.  It's so annoying and most changes do not make it better. If you have a recipe that's better then submit it.  I really hate looking at 25 variations. If you have time for this then you have lots of time on your hands. Just rate it and go about your business.  Most of us don't have time to go through 100's of changes. Bravo for you for being chefs.

Good reviews from everyone.  I added crimini mushrooms, smoked paprika, oregano, and salt.   It would be good with green beans.  I put the bacon on top of the chicken, & it came out crispy.  I also sprinkled small bits of raw bacon on top of the potatoes.

My 5 boys ranging in age from 13 - 42 absolutely loved this recipe!! Flavors flowed together nicely. Boiled white potatoes and cubed them before placing them on the chicken. Took awhile to cook but we'll worth the wait!!

Absolutely one of the best receipes that I have made with chicken. Read the review from Scorpio GG and added some cross-cut carrots to the other vegtables and put them in a foil lined granite 13x9x5 pan, sprayed with pam first. Added part of the seasoning mix to the veg's and placed a sprayed grid that fits this pan on top. I also used thick cut bacon to wrap my chicken thighs in, but let some of the chicken be seen. Placed the thighs on the rack and sprinkled with spice mix. It took about 75-80 minutes to get done. But OMG all the juices from the chicken pieces and bacon made the veg's taste absolutely ( TO DIE FOR ). THE BACON WAS CRISPY, BUT NOT OVERDONE. Thank you for this wonderful receipe.Clean up was so delightful, Nothing to clean up.

THE BEST EVER!
Only thing I changed was used chicken 1/4's and left them together, so no room for the potatoes.
No adobo so made my own and used Smoked Paprika which was awesome with the other spices!
After chicken was done I took them out and left the onions, cut the potatoes up and put them in the sauce left over and coated them and every 15 min turned them for an hr and half till roasted nice and brown. :-) OMG the best ever!

Loved this recipe!!  Followed a suggestion made by another reviewer.  Tossed potatoes in a bit of olive oil and the seasoning before putting them in the pan with the chicken.   Awesome - will make it again for sure!!

This was an enjoyable dish that was ideal for having during the week since it didn't take very long to prepare. The potatoes were crispy and the chicken and bacon were cooked nicely, but it seemed to lack flavour (other than bacon). My family enjoyed it, but needed BBQ sauce for added taste. Maybe some brine or dry rub would have helped the taste of the chicken which I found to be a little bland. I will try it again with my own twist. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! Easy! Quick! Modified it using what I had on hand. 2.5 lb boneless breast - cubed, fresh garlic, chive, & basil. Seasoning salt (no adobo),  just a sprinkle of cayenne, and 1/2 pound diced bacon warmed up in pan to break apart . Only sprayed pan with a little olive on - figuringnthe bacon would take care of that. Tossed all together in baking pan and sprinkled top with black pepper and tumeric. Tossed again around 1/2 through baking to break apart chicken. My bunch devoured it!

Outstanding!! Hubby, son and daughter loved it! We didn't have the chives, and since we're not big fans anyway, don't think they were missed. The blend of spices were on point, and the potatoes were delicious. This has made the family top ten list! Try it you won't regret it!

Pretty good, and easy to make. The only issue I found was it is hard to get the bacon to crisp before overcooking the chicken and potatoes. I might try partial pre-cooking the bacon next time.

My husband loved this recipe.  He said it was something you would get in a restaurant.  The kids didn't care for it so much.  I think next time I make it I will leave the seasoning off of their portion.  I did put Italian dressing on the potatoes.  We will be making again.

I usually add onions and carrots and leave out the adobo seasoning.  Also I use skinless boneless chicken thighs.  Sometimes I use beef bacon.  I find that it helps to cook the bacon a little before wrapping the chicken in it.

Excellent!  This was so easy to prepare - I put the potatoes and onions in the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking dish, and put the bacon wrapped chicken on a baking rack on top of the dish.  All of the wonderful juices dripped down on to the potatoes and onion, giving them a amazing flavor (I took the potatoes and onions out of the pan after cooking, and drained them on paper towels).  This dish gets more than 5 stars in my opinion!  It is an easy and elegant dinner to serve to company!

I love this dish! I used to do ir more often when I was slimmer, now is more a confort food for special days. Trust in the adobo it makes all the season in the potatoes, even if you cook them separately remember the adobo. 
I love bacon!

Great flavor but I would prefer to cut up the bacon, sear it a bit first in the pan then add the chicken, onions, and potatos as suggested as opposed to wrapping each piece with a strip.  The bacon is too undercooked for my liking this way.  Again, great flavor but I found myself tossing the bacon away.  And I agree - can be elaborated on in many ways.

When I read the reviews for a recipe, I usually go to the "most helpful". but the recipe didn't say to remove the skin from the chicken, so the potatoes, etc. were so greasy, I couldn't eat them. I wrapped the bacon instead of draping over the meat...ugh.  What a waste of bacon.  Sorry.  I had to mix the veggies in with my 4 dogs' dry food...they thought it was a preview of what heaven must be like. Perhaps using chicken breasts would be the only way to use this recipe, and maybe put the potatoes on a rack to keep them out of the bacon fat.

I like the idea of this recipe but it didn't have much flavor and the grease from the bacon made the veggies all greasy(I added carrots along with potatoes)  I might try this again and add a little more seasoning.

for extra flavor shake on some ranch dressing or italian dressing powdered mix before wrapping chicken or soak in some buttermilk with some dijon mustard mixed in it before wrapping.

This recipe was great! I just placed the bacon on top of the chicken and drizzled the potatoes and chicken with a little evoo then added the seasoning.

The family thought this was a solid recipe, but nothing super special. The bacon on the underside of the chicken didn't cook entirely.

I used bone-in thighs, but removed skin.  For potatoes I threw in some canned new potatoes, and I also stuck in several peeled garlic cloves.  I basted a couple of times, but I am not sure that was necessary.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe didn't say to remove the skin and that is a definite must! I thought it was good but i liked the potatoes way more than I did the chicken. I love both bacon and chicken but after eating the bacon the chicken didn't really have a whole lot of flavor. Easy to make but I don't think i'll be making this one again without tweeking the recipe.

This recipe was an easy one dish meal.  The ingredient list is very simple, which is a plus.  My chicken came out with crisp bacon, and I'm thinking that this is because I didn't overload my pan with a LOT of veggies, and had plenty of room around the bacon-wrapped chicken to cook correctly.  Only one problem: the chicken was a little under-seasoned.  Next time I am going to season the chicken with a little salt/pepper before I wrap it in the bacon.  This is a keeper!

This dish seemed to be missing something.  After the first 60 mins I ended up splashing some sherry on it and baking for another 15 mins.  It didn't really help too much.  Everything was too dry but a shortened cooking time would not have allowed the potatoes to finish off.  I actually think regular cut bacon and not just the center cut would have been better, due to the extra fat rendering out into the dish as the bacon cooked.  Will not be making this one again.

Everything about this dish was great.  We would have given it five stars but the bacon never crisped really.  Next time I might crisp the bacon first or as others suggested just use the bacon on top.  WE also didn't have abodo seasoning.  Didn't matter.  We both cleaned our plates.  Suggested green side:  Cajun Asparagus.

This was a good recipe.  However, I took some of the advice from other reviewers, & it took MUCH longer than 40 minutes @ 400 degrees.  I think I ended up cooking it over an hour -- the potatoes weren't soft enough.  I didn't have any adobo, so I added 1 Tbl. of Italian Seasoning.  Served with a side salad and fruit.  Super easy!

I made this last night and my family loved it. I did make a few modifications.  I seasoned flour with Emirals Essence and floured chicken thighs then browned them in some olive oil (this helped to keep the skin criap).  I used red potatoes quartered.  I coated them with some olive oil and Essence.  As another reviewer suggested I used a raised grill and put the potatoes on the bottom half of a foil lined baking sheet with the grill over them with the chicken on top. On each Chicken thigh I brushed on a generous amount of Trader Joes BBQ sauce then placed a 1/2 slice of thick cut pepper bacon on each thigh.  The drippings from the chicken added a great flavor to the potatoes and the combination of the bacon and, chicken and BBQ sauce was fab.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great meal!  Next time I make it I will reduce spices by 25% as they were a bit overwhelming and  increase sauce by 50% for more of a gravy.

cooking this for an hour would have been fatal for the meat. 40 minutes was almost too much--took it out just in time which meant the bacon was not quite as crispy as I had hoped.

This just didn't have any zip.  I did have to substitute a different seasoning for the adobo, but it still had little character.  I can understand why people are putting cheese on this.  It did help to par-cook the potatoes in the microwave so the potatoes and chicken would cook in the same amount of time (half an hour or so worked for us.)  Added 2 carrots and used smoky deli bacon.

The skin was like rubber, the under side of the bacon soggy and the potatoes were dry.  The only thing that was good was the top side of the bacon.

Great Dish! Put a serious snarff on this one. However...baked at 400 deg. for 70 min. for a little firmer chicken on middle rack. Hit the taters with garlic salt for a zestier taste. Nixed the adobo and used some celery salt lightly sprinkled instead!

WOW!  This is so easy and yummy!  The whole family devoured it! The only things I did differently was to use boneless thighs.  Also, put some provalone cheese on the last few minutes.  Using liiquid from the pan to make a sauce, 1 cup liquid, 2 tablespoons flour and 1 cup milk.

Mmmmmm...this was good. Served it at a potluck and was thrilled to see folks going back for seconds and even thirds. I used fresh garlic and basil but other than that stuck to the recipe as written.

I make Chicken Adobo and this a wonderful take on my recipe and to serve it with the potatoes and the bacon wrapped chicken is brilliant. This one is very good and all of the seasoning is wonderful - I could not believe someone thought there were to many spices.   You can buy adobo sauce already mixed in a jar at most oriental markets or in the oriental section of your grocery store.

I have made it 2 ways, which both get 5 stars!  1.  I used other's advise and seasoned potatoes in a tablespoon of Italian Dressing (I used Olive Garden's dressing).  I didn't have adobo seasoning, so I put some olive oil onto the chicken and used the chives, basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, and ground mustard to season it. I took others suggestions and used chicken breast, layered it in a roasting pan which allowed the juices to drip onto the potatoes.  This method seemed to dry out the chicken a little bit, so next time I will probably but the chicken into the pan with the potatoes.  The potatoes came out GREAT.  I chopped up Idaho potatoes into cubes and it was perfect.  Ialso only layered 3 strips of bacon over the chicken.  This may be why my dish came out a little dry, but I am not sure.  This dish is a keeper and the entire family LOVED it!

2.  I made the recipe in 2 9x13 dishes.  I put 6 chicken legs with 3 boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  I layered the bacon over and made my own Adobo seasoning (I used Traci's Adobo Seasoning from this website.)  Cooked for 1 hour 10 minutes and it came out AMAZING!  Sheesh, this is a good recipe.  I also added some corn on the cob and carrots along with the potatoes.

MMM this came out delicious! I used chicken breasts and I cut them into thigh-sized pieces then wrapped each with bacon strips (I used turkey bacon.) I didn't have yellow potatoes so I used the white ones. The seasonings on this was delicious and I added a sprinkle of cayenne because I like heat. The potatoes were just the way I like them (melt-in-your-mouth good!) and to get my bacon slightly crisp I turned on the broiler at the end for a while. Only the top side of the bacon got crisp and rest remained a bit soft but I enjoyed it that way. Thanks for sharing!

Really great family meal.  I have made it a couple of times now and everyone really enjoys it.  I haven't been able to find adobo (?) seasoning though.  I have been improvising.  Would be curious to try the recipe with it.

Wonderful recipe easy to prepare.  Of note for those on salt free diet you can substitute Mrs Dash for salt and pepper and you can use canned whole baby potatoes drained in place of Dutch potatoes also you can add other spices to your taste.  If you're kosher you could use pastrami strips or beef strps instead of bacon.  I highly recommend this recipe

Tasted really good except the chicken skin was rubbery under bacon. Next time to be honest I’ll use spices, potatoes and onions and chicken minus bacon. I didn’t have dried chives so I subbed onion powder.

My husband liked it. I only needed to make 1/3 the recipe because I only needed to do 4 drumsticks. I didn't have adobo seasoning but found a recipe online that used spices I have in the pantry, mixed that up and used it. Guess it worked.

Divine! I used chicken thighs and didn't have adobo seasoning but I tossed in some spices that would be in adobo and it was absolutely wonderful. I also turned the chicken once or twice to insure the bacon was well cooked. Super easy, SUPER GOOD! Will make this a part of my repertoire, for sure.

This was very tasty and will be making again. In lieu of the garlic powder I used fresh minced garlic. My bacon was very lean so it did not leave much grease in the pan. If your bacon is lean, you may want to spray the pan or use a wee bit of olive oil so the food does not stick.

I eat according to a ketogenic plan, and was lazy so all I did was wrap the thighs and drumsticks with the bacon, then baked according to the recipe. So dang good, I uses the meat to make lettuce wraps.

I made it with some variations  as I didn't have the adobo spices, so i just blended the ingredients together.  I used skinless/boneless chicken breast.  The chicken was moist and the potatoes were good.  I had hoped the bacon would be a bit crispier, but I was concerned that the chicken would dry out.  My family loved the meal, however, I would have liked it to be a bit spicier.  I will make it again!

I am giving you a 5-Star because I didn't make your recipe. I got home later than expected tonight and worked with what I had. I used 2 big Idaho potatoes, cut them into chunks, added half an onion on top and a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms. Added a cup of mini whole carrots we had in the fridge. Sprayed all of that with Canola Oil and sprinkled McCormick's Herb & Garlic Seasoning over all of it. Enveloped it in tinfoil, baked for an hour at 400 and it was scrumptious. I will try your recipe when I have time. Thank you fr the idea of a quick dinner.

This was an absolute delight for dinner, simple to prepare ahead of time so that all roommate had to do was slip it into the oven at the proper temperature for me. I will be honest and say that I did use only 1/2 to 3/4 of the finally seasoning mix called for but that was because of personal preference... my other roommate and guest actually added more to theirs so that got the correct amount.

This seemed to take longer to make, the bacon never crisped up, and we found that putting the seasoning on after the bacon, didn't do anything. Not an awful meal, but I have feel there are better baked chicken recipes out there.

Delicious! Since I had no onions (no idea how that happened), I used potatoes and carrots, cut into large bite-size pieces. I wrapped the chicken, sprinkled the veggies around them, then sprinkled with garlic and Italian herbs. No leftovers!!!

The bacon was not done enough I didn't like the texture of it at all. Other than that it's my favorite recipe I've made off here so far.

Really enjoyed this!  I used bone-in thighs and legs.  Used the recipe accordingly...only one time I quickly brown the bacon on the chicken in a lil extra light olive oil and then baked on a rack. Gooooood

Really good recipe! Flavour was great and my chicken cane out nice and moist. I made my own adobo seasoning as I didn't have any and I also added purple onions with my yellow onions which gave a nice flavour. I also used applewood smoked bacon instead of centre cut bacon. Like nothing I'm used to making so it's pretty good for my first try! Would definitely make this again!

I made this exactly like the recipe except I used russet potatoes. I was worried that there was too much seasoning. It came out exceptional, everyone loved it. Will definaely make it again.

We used boneless organic chicken thighs from a local butcher.  The thighs are smaller allowing the bacon to completely wrap up the thighs.  They were even better the next day.

This is an easy and good recipe.  However, I recommend using skinless chicken to reduce the amount of fat (a bit overwhelming when the chicken is coated in bacon) and maybe cook the bacon a bit ahead of time so it crisps up a bit.

It was yummy and what I loved about it it is that it was easy to follow.. It took a 1hour 45 minutes  to cook due  to the fact  I used leg quarters (big pieces of chicken ??) and I baked it with foil to savor the juices and for the last 15 minutes take off the foil to finish cooking and I served it with Velveeta shells and cheese

This dish was so delicious.  The only thing I would change next time is to lay the bacon on top so you can flip it and get it nice a crispy.

This is my first recipe review, but thought this one was worthy!  It was so easy! I used frozen chicken breast tenderloins straight out of the freezer.  I cubed small golden potatoes, carrots and onions and placed on the bottom of a foil lined pan.   I seasoned them with garlic powder, salt, pepper and adobo (never used adobo before tonight) and then placed chicken tenderloins on top and draped bacon slices on top of it all.  It took right at an hour in a 400 degree oven.  This saved me tonight!  I had a house full of hungry teens and a late start to dinner.  Nevertheless, I got a round of thank yous for the great meal.  THAT is worth taking a few minutes to thank the other reviewers for these easy adaptations to this great recipe, and to throw in my agreement.  Definitely worth making this one!

I really like the simplicity of this recipe (one pan!).  The seasoning was tasty.  I used chicken breasts, and cut a piece of thick peppered bacon in half, then just laid that on top of the chicken.

Next time I would coat the taters in olive oil and toss with some of the seasoning  before adding to the pan.  I prefer a little crisp to my taters.  I'd also sprinkle the spices on the chicken before layering on the bacon.  Flavor was good, and I'll definitely make this again.

We liked it, but there is no way that 6 thighs & 6 drumsticks could fit in an 8x13 pan along with the potatoes. I used just 6 thighs and 5 small red potatoes, quartered, and that amount was plenty. Next time I will elevate the chicken due to the juices/drippings. Mine did not crisp & look like the picture. The taste was fantastic! Very easy.

I modified by using all drumsticks and each drumstick had 2 slices of bacon. My problem was that the potatoes did not finish in the hour cooking time, even though they were cut in 1/2 inch slices. My 9x13 was stuffed full and may need modifications. I would repeat, the flavor was great, but use ScorpioGG suggestion of potatoes on the bottom and chicken on top. Also you need to increase the cooking time.

This was really good. I used a package of ranch seasoning in place of all the herbs and spices. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts - so the next time I make this, I would cook the (red) potatoes for 20-30 minutes first, and then add the chicken wrapped in bacon. The end result was delicious, but my chicken dried out, which was a bit of a bummer.

At the end of the hour the bacon was still soggy, so I roasted it another 15 minutes. The bacon was still soggy. We didn't care for the combo of seasoning, so we peeled off the bacon, wiped off most of the seasoning, and ate some of the chicken. We didn't care for the potatoes either.

We made this last night and I switched the seasoning to a onion soup packet and some olive oil and just coated the potatoes with it then placed them in the dish with the chicken. I would recommend using a rack also because the bacon gets the dish kinda oily and although it is good there is just allot of it.

Husband was impressed!  Delishious recipe,  easy to make.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder,  add oregano,  also carrots  and zucchini.   Cooked for 1:15 just to let carrots and zucchini burn a little bit, result..  Perfection!!
Will add grapes tomatoes next time,  will be making this dish very often.

Very good, my family loved it. The only change I made was to use Chipotle powder because that is what I had on hand. I also used red potatoes.

So yummy! The only change I would make would be to add a drizzle of olive oil to the potatoes. Helps the seasoning stay on, and crisps them up. I did use breasts instead of thighs. My daughter didn't even use BBQ sauce for dipping!

I loved this recipe! Instead of wrapping the chicken pieces with bacon,I followed the advice of others and laid it on top. Loved the flavor!

Will definately make this again.  I used all chicken breasts  and boiled the potatoes for about 30 minutes in  salted garlic water before baking.  Baked uncovered for 1 hour and all turned out perfect.

Excellent dish!  I used boneless chicken breasts because my family doesn't like dark meat.  The bacon kept the chicken moist and added a nice flavor to the potatoes!!!  Very easy weekday meal and cleanup is easy because I only had to use 1 dish!!

I read all the reviews, and since my kids don't like dark meat. I did use chicken breasts and only put the bacon on top, also sprayed the pan first and did cover for the first 15 minutes. They came out great, the only complaint was use more bacon next time. They were juicy and not one leftover!!

The recipe was very simple to follow and even-though I had to add sazon to the chicken it self. I added a layer of olive oil cooking spray for the seasoning to stick nicely to the outside bacon. very simple, very good seasoning, Thanks!!

Loved it!  I do advised removing the skin from the legs and thighs, it just kind of stays looking like it is raw.  Ugh.  Also I feel that Adobo has a lot of salt so I backed off that by about half.  Will be making again.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and turkey bacon with baby tri-colored potatoes, fresh basil, chives and garlic.  It was delicious and easy.  Paired it with sautéed kale for a well balanced and nutritious dinner.  What a great meal for company too!

REALLY good.  I followed another reviewer's advice of placing the chicken on the rack of my roasting pan, which worked great for crisping the bacon and evenly dripping the bacon grease onto the potatoes which helped them brown and crisp nicely.  I used red potatoes which I diced in about 1/2 inch cubes.  I didn't have adobo or chives.

it's easy, my daughter Rachel made this for us first, so now we call it Rachel's chicken. You could seriously use whatever seasoning you like on this or even skip the bacon and it would still be good. But seriously, who would skip bacon? lol

I made this with thighs and legs, without the potatoes though, but served it with the  Fried Rice Restaurant Style recipe on this site. It was very good, the whole family said it was a keeper. I did skimp on the bacon a bit, using only a half a strip per thigh and leg.

This was pretty good; however I did make a few changes.  Used 4 legs and 3 thighs.  Cut the potatoes in cubes and tossed in olive oil.  Used garlic and herb seasoning (lipton) on potatoes/onions and on chicken.  Laid bacon on top of chicken instead of wrapping.  Everyone enjoyed it so I plan to make again.

I think I followed all directions.  didn't like it at all.  bacon was totally undone except what was exposed on top.  the spice combo was pretty good.  my liked the smell.  maybe if I had microed the bacon a couple of minutes first.  too crowded in the dish to cook through.

Everything is better with bacon except maybe strawberry short cake and I could be wrong about that. When I make this I use all boneless skinless chicken thighs, thighs are my preference when it comes to chicken. I use a slightly larger baking dish so I can add carrots and or Brussels sprouts to make it a one dish meal.

This was superb!! I used partially frozen breasts, with bacon placed on top only. I coated the PO's and some whole mushrooms with olive oil and seasoning. I did not have the adobo . Cooked at 375 for 1 hour and added the whole mushrooms halfway through. I also added the seasoning on the breasts before I topped with the bacon. This was not only delicious looking, but the house smelled awesome and it tasted like heaven!! Thank you for sharing this!!

Made this tonight. I have to say it is one of the best dishes I've cooked. I am trying to broaden my cooking horizon. I am proud of the compliments I received and feel like I have a new found passion for cooking.  I just sauteed some fresh green beans as a quick secondary side with the potatoes.

I would like to try with boneless, skinless chicken breast as it was a bit too fatty for my family's taste.  It was good and even better the next day when I broiled the chicken to crisp up the bacon.

I loved the idea of the recipe... but next time I'll probably make my own mix of spices.  Granted, I seriously messed up by adding the entire seasoning mix to the potatoes, but in the end, the spice mix was not my cup of tea.  The chicken turned out ok.  I used the idea from one of the reviews to place the chicken on a rack on top of the potatoes (which saved it from the seasoning mix overload). Photos added.

Very easy and super delicious!  The bacon helps flavor the potatoes and the chicken.  I used all chicken thighs because I'm not a wing girl unless it's an appetizer!  Keep to the recipe and younshould enjoy it.

Good but too salty. I suggest you not add the additional salt to the spice mix as the bacon adds enough sodium. Other than that, the dish came out very good. I will make it again without the salt.

My husband and I liked this recipe. We used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and did wrap them completely in the bacon. I had reduced the recipe to 2 servings(4 thighs) and adjusted the salt and pepper to our taste. I didn't have adobo so just followed a recipe I found online, again adjusting the spice ratio according to what we liked, a little more paprika and garlic, a little less salt and pepper. I used a pan large enough so nothing was crowded and cooked it for 45 minutes at 400 degrees. The chicken was moist and the potatoes(I used small red bliss cut into quarters) were tender. Nothing seemed dry although I think the potatoes would taste even better if they were tossed in the spices and olive oil. The bacon did crisp on top but was a little soft on the bottom. But I expected that. Next time I may try what another person suggested-putting the chicken on a rack. Overall, we felt this recipe was good, it has plenty of room to tweak to your personal taste, and will make it again.

We loved it.  Even the kids eat it.  I add onion powder, and extra garlic powder and put it up under the the chicken skin and then on top of the skin.  We love any excuse to eat bacon.

Not bad, gave me some good ideas on how to make some great potato's and I thank her for that. One suggestion though, I actually altered the recipe and used boneless, skinless chicken breast. The bacon on the bottom of the chicken breast came out a bit soft (I love crisp bacon myself) so if you do it this way you may want to flip the chicken some ways through. Thanks for the Recipe it was delish!

This was excellent. I actually think the review suggesting cooking the chicken on a wire rack above the roasting potatoes made all the difference. I sprinkled Monterey Steak seasoning on the potatoes and wished I had added a touch to the chicken. I was still very happy with the outcome.

We loved this recipe!! I did as recipe directed, except I didn't have dried chives so I just left those out, and I didn't have garlic powder so I used garlic salt (this made it a little on the salty side so I'd do the garlic powder next time). I only seasoned the potatoes and onions, since I thought the bacon would be enough flavor for the chicken (which it was). The one thing we did that my husband really felt made the dish really good was to pull the skin off the chicken drumsticks and then tightly wrap the bacon around the chicken. This allowed the bacon to actually stick to the chicken. In past attempts to make bacon wrapped chicken, we've left the skin on, and then the bacon slips right off when you try to eat it, and there isn't as much flavor in the chicken. Also, I put the potatoes and onions right under the chicken and there was PLENTY of bacon drippings to keep the potatoes moist...although I do think if I make it again, I will do as others suggested and put the chicken on a rack above the potatoes, so that I can easily pull chicken out for a second and turn the potatoes halfway through cooking to have all the sides get that yummy bacon grease :) Also, I did half the amount of seasoning since I was not seasoning the chicken, and it was a good amount for the potatoes. We will definitely make again! Thank you!

Just recently tried this recipe and I loved it and so did my fam! I only had Idaho baking potatoes in the frig. I also added green peppers, onions, and carrots. I coated the veggie mix with Italian salad dressing( I didn't have parsley and basil). I made my own version of adobo seasoning(didn't have that either). I seasoned and browned the skinless drumsticks in a frying pan along with some bacon pieces. (Ran out of bacon). But all went well. I threw everything in a large casserole dish and into the oven it went. The bacon drippings really make this dish! This recipe is a keeper. Will make again!!!

This was really good. My family loved it.  I used chicken breasts, red potatoes, baby carrots and a white onion.  Like others suggested I tossed the veggies in Italian dressing. It smelled wonderful. I couldn't find any adobo seasoning, so I used chili powder, pepper, season salt and Italian seasoning on the chicken. I will be making this one again.

I put my potatoes and onions on the bottom of a foil lined roasting pan. Then my chicken on the rack above them, as someone else suggested and let the juices drip on the potatoes and onions. Simply, fairly quick, and you can use any combination of spices that sounds good.

Whoa on the pepper!!  Way too much pepper for my taste, even though the rest of it came out really nice.  I'll be trying this again with far less pepper, since it was overwhelming.  But thanks for a recipe that let me use what I had on hand.

I only used a teaspoon of pepper, I just thought a whole tablespoon was a little crazy. We didnt have dried chives so I used onion powder instead. I used all drumsticks and skinned them. I put the potatoes in a big roasting pan, seasoned with a little italian dressing and the seasoning mix, I also seasoned the chicken both before and after I wrapped them with the bacon. If you put the drumsticks on the top part of a broiling pan and put that pan over the potatoes, THEN turn the chicken over at the half hour mark, they will come out crispy and golden. The family thought it was ok, though they didn't rave about it.

This dish was great!  Very easy. Used only thighs.  I added brussel sprouts, carrots, and sweet potatoes. Served it with brown rice. Besides the extra veggies followed the recipe as written. It will definately be a repeat recipe!

This dish is definitely not for the healthy eaters! Very good recipe...didn't change much except for the potatoes, all I had were russets. I followed an advice and put my wrapped thighs on a rack above the potatoes. Turned out delish!! Thank you for a dinner change!

YUM YUM YUM! :) I made a few changes to this recipe and followed the advice of fellow cookers by placing the bacon on top of the chicken instead of wrapping it around. I've tried wrapping it around before with a different recipe and the result was very soggy bacon on the bottom that grossed me out. I also used normal potatoes and sprinkled cheese on them for additional flavor. This was delicious! My only complaint is that it tastes pretty gross as left overs so only make enough for one meal!

Excellent dish.  The only thing I will do different is I will NOT salt and pepper the chicken after wrapping it in bacon.  The bacon and adobo together are salty enough.  No one could eat just one piece.  And the potatoes were amazing!

This dish was SO SO Delicious!! Anything with bacon wrapped around it is a winner in my books! The bacon came out crispy and the potatoes had a slight bacon flavor. The only suggestion I would make is to season the chicken with salt and pepper before it is bacon wrapped (easy on the salt bacon is already salty!). I make this suggestion because I found once I ate the bites with the bacon the remaining chicken nearer to the bones was a bit bland. But SO GOOD!! A definite winner.

Fixed this last nigiht and it is a dish that will be served often.  I used boneless/skinless thighs and small red potatoes that I had on hand.  Like others, I didn't have the adobo seasoning but I didn't miss it.  This dish was scrumptious - and the chicken stayed so moist and juicy and it and the potatoes took on all of the flavor of the herbs and the bacon.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

VERY TASTY! I loved this recipe, the chicken drum sticks were on sale so I made them with the recipe. I took the skin off the chicken, added the seasonings and then cut and draped the bacon over the chicken to have it turn crisp and not be soft or uncooked under the chicken, I also drizzeled some olive oil over potatoes and carrots I added so they wouldn't dry. The fat that melted off the bacon made the veggies delish! I have already made this recipe 2 times! Its a keeper!

Wonderful, fast and easy!!  I did substitute chicken breasts; because they were handy.  Also, did not have adobo seasoning; just went without. It was moist, tender and delicious; and suprisingly not too greasy.  Please note I am NOT easily impressed.  Definite add to your quick and easy reicpe book!

This recipe was excellent.  My oldest son told me that he would pay for this in a restaurant.  Next time we'll cut the potatoes a little smaller so they cook more.  Instead of wrapping the chicken (I used breasts), I just laid the bacon on top so it would cook well.  The spice was just right.  Even my picky daughter liked it.

Very good, smells great cooking. I did change a little, I used chicken breasts and wrapped each with one piece of bacon. I sprinkled garlic salt over chicken, added potatoes and drizzled olive oil over all. I had fresh chives and basil and used season salt on potatoes.

This dish was fantastic! I used chicken breasts instead which worked out just fine. The potatoes soaked up all the flavor from the chicken and bacon and made for a wonderful side dish.

WOW!!!  2nd time I've made this and even my picky toddlers love it!!  I used russet potatoes and coated them in onion soup mix before adding them to the pan.  Since we weren't ready to eat when the dish was done, i just put some foil on top and let it sit in the oven (no heat) until we were ready.  The chicken was so tender it was just falling apart!    Thank you for sharing!!

I love this recipe! At first, I used my oven to do this and the chicken got a little dry but the next time I did it, I used my Nuwave oven and it turned out so much better each time! My family and friends really enjoy it too.

We love drumsticks so that's all I use in this recipe.  I only put salt, pepper and garlic powder on the chicken, then wrap it with the bacon.  I only have red potatoes, so I chopped those up and put the same seasonings on them, then tucked them around the chicken and added some onions.  Very simple and my kids love it!  Home cooking at its best!

Made this for the homeless men that our church hosts once a month.I doubled it and pu the potatoes in the bottom of my Nesco roaster.then I put the chicken on the rack over the potatoes.I put a little chicken broth on the potatoes to keep them from burning to the pan.I took it to the church 2 hrs ago and my house still smells good.I think this would be awesome in a cast iron dutch oven over the campfire.thanks for the recipe.

Amazing recipe. Great flavor and fun usage of bacon. However, it is nearly impossible to get the bacon to stay on the chicken if you use chicken breasts.

the bacon only tasted like basil and not bacon, which was a little disappointing. the potatoes needed butter which i added, and they turned out great. Basically the bacon added nothing to the chicken, but the chicken was still good.

Granted, my husband is a huge fan of bacon anyways, so this went over well. The chicken came out so tender and moist! I've made this three times already! It's SO good! Thank you!

Bacon makes anything good, but I LOVE crispy bacon and I couldn't get the bacon to crisp up, as some have said. Besides that, the dinner was easy to make, healthy, hearty and delicious. I added carrots with dill because my boyfriend doesn't like potatoes and they were delicious.
