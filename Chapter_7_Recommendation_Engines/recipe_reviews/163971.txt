excellent.  try this version when you don't have mango: omit the mango add ground cumin to tast and a little splenda for a hint of sweet. turns out great, i like it better than with the mango.

This was very refreshing but my family found that 1 cup or more of mango was better.  I also added fresh tomatoes & frozen corn (instead of mushy canned corn).  Salt and pepper to taste!  Delicious.

I found my tastebuds were dying for more 'zing' with this one. I would increase the mango to start, maybe add more lime juice, and play around with some spice(y) additions.

Yummy!  I made this for a company picnic and wished I could have kept it to myself!  I made the original recipe, then thought it could use a bit more color so I added kidney beans pineapple chunks too and wow--even better!  Next time I might throw in some strawberries and more cilantro for a bigger kick, but this is a tasty and beautiful salad!

This is pretty good but needs a little more flavor. I added a lot more lime juice, more olive oil and lots more cilantro. The fruit really adds a nice touch. My mango was not ripe enough so I added a fresh peach. If I make again I would use fresh tomatoes.

I have had this before and found the recipe here. It's a nice accompaniment to grilled burgers or as a dip. I added a little extra lime and also some garlic since my family loves garlic.

This is very good.  I omitted the mango, and added tomatoes with green chilies to spice it up.  Family raved about it.

Great fresh salsa.  My mango was overripe, so I substituted pineapple as previously mentioned in other reviews.  Like it hot, so I also used tomatoes w/ jalapenos, and a sprinkle of chili and garlic powders.  Great now, but looking to see how flavors blend overnight...  Hoping it will be a colorful addition to a healthy foods holiday party!!

The mango we bought was not quite ripe enough to include, but it was still very yummy without. We added a little jar salsa with it to add a little spice and garlic salt. Really good with chips or to to put in chicken wraps!

I did this without the mango because I'm not a big fan of the fruit. I used minced serrano peppers to make it spicy. I thought about substituting pineapple for mango, but just ditched the fruit altogether. Delish.

I made this and couldn't stop eating it. Then morning sickness kicked in and now the thought of it makes me sick. Literally. It WAS awesome though.

I use cantaloupe instead of mango (small balls work nice).  Also 1TBS of oil and let it all rest at least a few hours.  Spooned over lettuce makes a great vegetarian meal.

This was very tasty and even my picky husband enjoyed it (he did pick out the tomatoes. Due to the season I was able to use fresh tomatoes and corn off the cob instead of the canned. Thanks for the recipe.

I had actually just gone to the store two days ago and got all the ingredients to make this salad.  I do it a little differently, though.  First, I don't add tomatoes, instead I finely chop one seeded jalepeno.  Secondly, I don't use lime juice and olive oil.  I use a balsamic vinegerette dressing.  Made this way, it is one of the tastiest salads I've ever had!

Even though its still winter where I live, I made this to feel spring/summer in the mind...  Delish!  I used more mango and a tad more lime juice.  I also used canned shoepeg corn - not mushy at all. Can't wait to try this over a grilled burger.

We loved this salsa. Besides serving it with chips and with enchaladas, we also enjoyed it over rice. Fabulous.
