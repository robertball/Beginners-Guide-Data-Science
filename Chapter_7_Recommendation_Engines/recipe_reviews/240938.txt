I have tried this recipe except for the 1/2 cup of butter. Also, I thought the fat in the whipping cream would be enough to give it that depth of flavor and I was pleased that it did.  I thought it was a little bland and next time would add some onion, maybe a little garlic and rosemary. But the tomato and basil flavor was excellent!  I grow herbs and have fresh basil on hand all year round. PS: I grow my own tomatoes.  Instead of the sugar, I add 1/2 tsp of baking soda so I don't get acid reflux.

This soup was ok for me. It is thicker than I am used to but that can be rectified by adding more chicken broth. I also would like some garlic and onion in it, but that can easily be added as well. So for me, this is a good base recipe that I can change any way I want.

Normally, I try to stay close to the regular recipe if my family will eat it. My boyfriend doesn't like "creamy" soups so I personally had to make changes to form a compromise(because I love tomato basil soup). I omitted the butter and cream and used 1 cup of whole milk instead. I added onion powder and garlic powder, salt and pepper. I didn't measure it was probably a teaspoon or two. Also, since he does get heartburn sometimes I took another cooks advice and threw in a half a teaspoon of baking soda before adding my spices(don't be alarmed if it foams up just keep stirring). I added all my spices after the boil during the simmer, then added the milk last. Mine came out more tomatoey (as opposed to creamy) but my family preferred that. Me personally I like the recipe as is with just a little onion and garlic powder. Also I was lazy, I only had dried basil, I used 2 tsp. I served it up with a grilled cheese and my family topped the soup with parm cheese. All and all a very excellent base you can customize to your family, so thank you for posting!

The recipe makes very bland soup as is. I used about 3 tsp dried basil, added another tbsp of sugar, and mixed in some oregano, garlic powder, and onion flakes while it was simmering.

This is some pretty yummy soup! Who would have thought adding butter would change it entirely! I forgot about the butter, and we were tasting it, and when I re-read the recipe, I thought, well, let me add the butter! Wow! We were shocked at the difference it made. 
Not for the health conscious, but surely delicious!

I had to use basil from a squeeze tube because they didnâ€™t have any fresh at my grocery store. I also added a dash of garlic powder and a dash of onion powder and my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it with our gourmet grilled cheeses. Great soup for the start of fall.

We loved it. I substituted heavy cream with an almond milk cream base and the butter for plant based butter. ( we can not tolerate dairy). It came out great!

Tomato bisque is my favorite soup, and this is pretty close to restaurant quality. Unless you have dietary restrictions, I recommend using  the full amount of cream and butter (I actually use a little more cream).

Made it to the recipe. Tasted good, but wanted more flavor. Added a 10oz can of Campbell's condensed tomato soup to it.

I used Hunts Fire roasted garlic tomatoes.  They added extra flavor but they were also extra chewy and a couple were a little burnt.  They also still had their skins on which I didn't like.  The flavor though was excellent.  I would add a tsp or so of sugar because the tomatoes made the soup a little too tangy for my taste. I'm sure I will make it again!
