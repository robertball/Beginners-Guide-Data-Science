We loved this recipe!  It's a Friday night tradition for my husband and I to go to our favorite Greek joint and have gyros, but freezing temps this evening so I decided to make these at home.  Delicious!  The sauce was excellent, I would recommend adding more lemon, greek seasoning, and dill.  I doubled the garlic as well.  I used 2/3 cup balsamic and 1/3 cup olive oil in place of the vinegrette.  No grilling tonight, so I baked the chicken with some marinade for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Perfect!  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent.  I made this in the winter so we didn't use the grill.  I broied the chicken 8 min on each side.  I used light sour cream and nonfat yogurt and the Tzatziki turned out fantastic and healthy.  My husband loved it, I loved it.  Definitely buy thick, quality pita.  My store was limited and the pita fell apart a bit, but it didn't take away from the taste.

This had fantastic flavor and really hit spot.  Reminded me of my husband and I's favorite college Pita haunt.  
As to the people confused by the recipe's chicken marinade make sure you are using a balsamic vinegrette as specified instead of straight balsamic vinegar, 2 TOTALLY different things.  Vinegrette is a salad dressing made with equal parts or slightly more Olive Oil to balsamic in addition to garlic, herbs, etc..  
The recipe is just fine as written!  
Thank you for the walk down memory lane!

This turned out great.  I did tweak a few things- kinda without realizing it.  (I printed the recipe and left it down stairs!) I used 2 good squirts of lemon juice.  And 3 "shakes" of greek seasoning and omited the oregano.  I also used a simpler and AWESOME tzatziki sauce... 1 cup plain yogurt, 2 T olive oil, 1 T lemon juice, 1/2 salt, 1/2 pepper, 1 T chopped fresh dill, 3-4 cloves of freshly grated garlic, 2 T finely shredded cucumber thats been dried with paper towels, 1-2 shakes of greek seasoning.  Mix and sit for an hour to chill in fridge.  The BEST combo around.

FANTASTIC!!! A little time consuming to make, but 100+++% worth the effort involved. If you prep these in stages, they're much more manageable to make.  I quickly threw together my marinade / tzatziki sauce early this afternoon, so all I had to do at dinnertime was grill my chicken (on my indoor reversible grill). To all of you wanting to give this a try, I have a few tips to share. First, you MUST use balsamic vinaigrette (found in the salad dressings aisle of your grocer), DO NOT use straight-up balsamic vinegar! Vinaigrette contains spices & EVOO to help tame the tartness of the vinegar. Second, Greek yogurt is a FAR superior choice for this cucumber sauce.  Tzatziki should be thick, not thin or watery. Unless you strain your yogurt, you will end up w/ runny sauce. Greek yogurt has already been strained. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's also more convenient. Finally, to ensure your cucumbers properly "sweat," toss them w/ salt (salt draws OUT water), & then do what reviewer MOLLE888 did - place in a colander / sieve set over a bowl w/ another bowl on top. Put a heavy can in the bowl to add some pressure & watch the liquid seep to the bottom! You will have PERFECT tzatziki every time (promise!). Served w/ red onion, tomatoes & iceberg lettuce (no pepperoncini or olives for us), these are a spot on copycat of our favorite local chain's Athenian chicken pitas! Seasoned curly fries completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, Chris! :-)

my husband lived in greece for two years and says that this recipe was the closest he's ever tasted to the real thing since he's been back in the usa.  the sauce is the perfect consistency, however, he said he'd use more cucumber, less dill.  i thought it was divine, i wanted to drink it it was so delicious!

This was a really great summer recipe. I warmed the pita bread on the grill slightly (it gets crispy quickly). Spend the extra dollar or two for the good pita bread. It makes ALL the difference. I served the pepperoncini whole, on the side. I have made this several times and have begun to use balsamic vinegrette in place of the dressing, and "Just 2 Good" Italian dressing as a marinade. I also used tin foil to hold the taco-like shape of the pita bread. This keeps it warm too. Perhaps the best tip I have is to use strained yogurt -- I found greek yogurt at the local specialty foods shop, but it might be available at Whole Foods / Wild Oats. Also, I just cubed the cucumbers b/c I like the crunch.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  Way too much oregano for my liking and too much vinegar.  I think I would add oil to the marinade and just a little oregano.  The recipe also needed salt.  I will try again, but will make some changes.

I usually only try recipes that have 4 1/2 or better stars. So I was really surprised when I tried this one. It wasn't at all what I excpected. The marinade was very sour. I felt bad talking my kids into eating it.

This was delicious! I marinated the chicken overnight and the flavors really came through. For those that said it was too sweet, the recipe calls for balsamic VINAIGRETTE not balsamic vinegar. My boyfriend loved the chicken! The tzatziki sauce was delicous as well! I also made this the night before so that the flavors had time to meld. Here's a tip: instead of salting the cucs to dry them out, I placed them in a sieve over a bowl with a bowl on top of them. I put a can of soup in the bowl to give it some pressure, and all the liquid seeped out the bottom. By the morning I had less moist cucs, and then combined them with the sauce I made the night before. I used non fat Greek yogurt (thicker and creamier) and dried dill (just 1 tsp). I also used reduced fat feta cheese, which isn't bad. The only problem I had (no fault of the recipe) was that the pitas ripped. Anyone have a good solution for that? This was such a welcome change from the usual turkey sandwiches!

We made it on a hot day and it was great!  The marinade and cucumber sauce are awesome and I didn't have to heat up the kitchen.  I grilled the chicken outside.  We also enjoyed the chicken cold the next day as leftovers.

Absolutely amazing.  I wanted something that tasted like the souvlaki at "Tom's Home of the Souvlaki" Greek diner in Buffalo, NY.  It was spot on!  The only thing I really did different was that we accidentally bought fat free yogurt, but I had no problems with the Tzatziki running.  I wrung dry the cukes in a cotton towel before salting them.  I also skipped the pepperocinis, not because I don't like them, but that's just not how Tom's did it!  WONDERFUL recipe - thanks so much!

This recipe was not good at all. If you try this recipe I reccomend NOT using a balsamic vinaigrette but instead use olive oil and maybe a little red wine vinegar and garlic.

This was excellent!!!  The chicken was easy to make and it went extremely well inside of a pita with the tzatziki sauce and veggies.  The tzatziki was easy to make as well.  I didn't know what greek seasoning was, nor could I find it, so I threw in basil, oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Paired this with the "Good For You Greek Salad", and this was a great dinner.  All we needed was a rice dish to go with it, and this would had been a perfect dinner.  But, this recipe is a keeper and I will DEFINITELY make it again.

The author of this recipe, however, needs to edit the servings…  This serves WAY more than 4 people, and the nutritional facts are SUPER high because of that.  So, hopefully that will change because it makes it show how healthy this actually could be.

I can't tell you how many times I have made this recipe and everyone in my family (even the kiddos) love it!! Sometimes I do not have sour cream for the cucumber sauce so I'll just use plain yogurt and it still taste great.  I do not make any adjustments on the marinade.  And for the toppings I use what I have on hand.  Great recipe!! Thanks for sharing it!!

Just writing about this recipe is making me hungry again! Both the chicken and the Tzatziki sauce turned out amazing. Followed this recipe to a T, served it with chopped cucumbers along with the other veges. Served with Nann instead of pita bread(Indian Naan II from this site). Naan doesn't break like Pita bread does. I also mixed up some balsamic vinagarette (Mama's balsamic vinegarette from this site) for the chicken marinade. I can't wait to make this again!

Five stars- this was soooo good!  I even had to leave some stuff out, and it was still outstanding.  I didn't realize I was out of garlic (that has never happened before, seriously!) so I had to just use garlic powder.  I'm pregnant and there's conflicting advice about eating feta while pg, so I left that off.  I had to use regular black olives, and didn't have the red onion.  Even with all of that, these still were so good.  Oh, our grill ran out of gas half-way through cooking too, so I had to finish the chicken up on the stove.  Still good!  I used whole wheat pitas, low-fat yogurt and light sour cream.  I love the cucumber sauce.  This recipe is great, thanks so much for sharing!

Made this for the family tonigth, and they loved it! They said, it was better than the local gyro joint, (Which is mighty good!) The only think I did to change the recipe was adding a 1/4c of sugar to the tatziki. We like our a little sweet, and tangy.

This is really good.  The marinade for the chicken is tasty, though could be a bit saltier (but keep in mind that the tzatziki and the feta are both salty too, so use a sparing hand).  The tzatziki sauce recipe is nuanced and delicious - since I didn't have Greek seasoning on hand, I found a great recipe (using LOTS of different spices) at http://www.food.com/recipe/greek-seasoning-mix-61579.  The sauce portion as written is quite large, and could probably feed 6-8 people, so the two of us had a lot of leftovers at the end.  We ended up doing a variation using ground beef seasoned with oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper instead of chicken - WOW!  So good with a side of diced and salted cucumbers and tomatoes and the leftover yogurt sauce, served with white rice or in pita.  Delicious recipe... plan to do tons of variations on this in the future.

Vinaigrette, NOT Vinegar.  This recipe is a family favorite.  We like to serve it with homemade pita bread and a side of hummus.  Those reviews that say the marinade is too sour probably used balsamic vinegar, rather than a vinaigrette salad dressing.  Vinaigrette is 3 parts oil, 1 part vinegar shaken together.

This was absolutely delicious!  I've been using this sight for years and this is the first time that I have rated a recipe.  I prepared the chicken just as instructed and it was soooooo good!  I used a different recipe for my tzatziki sauce, but the chicken was amazing!

10 STARS!!!!!!!! If I could rate it more, I would.  Love the chicken.  Love the tatziki.  My favourite recipe from this site and I love many of them.  I serve with greek potatoes (recipe from this site also) and it tastes like the restaurant.  No more paying so much for something I can make at home.  So good.

Excellent recipe for chicken! I only used the souvlaki marinade part of this recipe. I chopped the breasts into thirds, grilled them and then served them with hummus, pitas and greek salad. The chicken is always very moist and tasty. It has become a recipe we often serve to our guests - resulting in a number of compliments!

This turned out fantastic!!! Loved it. I only had balsamic vinegar on hand so I just added evoo to dilute it. Also, I went light on the olives and pepperoncini knowing there is alot of vinegar in both of them. I coul'd find any pita bread I liked so I used naan bread which knocked it out of the park for me yum!!!

The marinade is pretty good, but it didn't taste particularly "Greek" to us.

Also, the Tzatziki sauce isn't quite right.

Very tasty.  Marinated chicken breast strips for about 6 hours - gave them good flavor.  Cucumber sauce very good as well.  Tastes a bit different than what you get at a restaurant, but still yummy and i'm sure healthier too. :)  Will definitely make again.

Excellent. I used a separate recipe that I prefer for the tzatziki sauce, and I didn't have any pita bread so I substituted tortillas instead. I also cut the chicken into strips before marinading and grilled them on skewers. It was delicious. Thanks to Chris J for upping this awesome recipe.

I love gyros especially with the cucumber sauce! I used a different recipe for the cucumber sauce, becuase I knew I wanted to drain my yogurt and didn't want sour cream in it. The chicken was a little bland and needed the cucumber sauce to make it good, but in my opinion the cucumber sauce is the best part of gyros!!!!

We really liked this recipe.  I used dried oregano from my garden and added garlic to the marinade.  Instead of making the sauce, I used Trader Joe's low fat tzaziki sauce, and it was great.  This recipe is a keeper...thanks@

Awesome, easy marinade. Instead of making gyros, I cut whole wheat pita rounds in wedges after briefly grilling them, and we ate them with the Tzatziki sauce.  My family devoured the sauce, and I will double it next time. I am Greek and love Greek food, so thanks for sharing this one!

Yummy! I used bl/sl thighs and grilled indoors as the weather was bad. The marinade was very good. The tzatziki sauce was very tasty, add a little more garlic next time, had to use dried dill as I did not have fresh. Made Seredipity Bread to have with it and Greek salad.

So good!  This was a huge hit at our house.  I couldn't find Greek Seasoning at the store so I used equal parts basil, oregano and thyme (should have used marjoram too but didn't have any).  The tzatziki sauce definitely makes it.  Like another reviewer said, definitely buy good pitas.  I warm them up in the microwave wrapped in damp paper towels to keep the pliable.

This was awesome! The only thing I did different was use apple cider vinegar in place of the rice vinegar and dried dill weed instead of fresh because that is what I had on hand. Phenomenal recipe - I will make again!!!

Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!  I didn't have Greek seasoning, so I used what others suggested; a mixture of garlic and onion powders, oregano and basil.  Other than that, made recipe as stated.  So good!  Will definitely make again.

We haven't got a grill at the moment so I used my cast iron skillet with some olive oil.  I also boneless skinless chicken thighs as dark meat is a bit more forgiving before it dries out. 8 minutes on a side worked perfectly!

Also, I couldn't find any 'Greek Seasoning' at my local store so I subbed in a mix of garlic powder, cumin, basil, oregano and onion powder in trace amounts.

Everything came out WONDERFULLY. Thanks for the recipe, Chris!

This was delicious!! To make easier I did it in two stages: marinated chicken one night & made/refrigerated the sauce, then made it the following night.  I totally agree about pitas- spend the extra money to get quality pitas or they'll fall apart.  We didn't have pepperoncini but it didn't take anything away.  No need to do as others' said about removing water from cucumber- I added it right to the sauce and after being refigerated overnight the sauce was perfect texture.  Excited to make this again- thank you!!

OMG, this was so good!  I cooked it inside in my grill pan.  I have to admit that I bought the Tzatziki sauce already made because it was one of my crazy days.  I brushed the pita bread with olive oil and threw on the grill pan and the kids and hubby ate it all up before I even got any!  This one is definitely a keeper!  thanks!

This was a delicious dinner for us tonight out on our deck. The prep. was easy and the taste was out of this world. The only tiny complaint I had was that by grilling the pitas they were a bit too tough for me. But I am really looking forward to the leftovers!

Terrific recipe!  I have played with many marinades for the chicken, and this one is the easiest by far!  We loved it!

I like to top the souvlaki with a little more than just the Tzatziki Sauce. I usually chop up red and green peppers and red onions nice and small - it adds so veggies and some flavor to the pita.  We then usually make a nice Greek Salad with the romaine, tomatoes, peppers, feta, kalamata olives,  and grape leaves. Delish!

Thank you for such a simple and tasty recipe!

We thought this was very good. I didn't make the tzatziki sauce because life got in the way, so I served it with more of the bottled balsamic vinaigrette, which I thought it really needed. A lot of the sour-in-your-face-flavor is lost when you grill it, so I might actually try baking or pan-cooking my meat next time (cut into chunks of course) so as to keep more "sauce" glazed onto the meat. I oiled my pitas with olive oil before grilling them, and while they did hold up better this way than without grilling them, for some reason the bread also got sort of tough. That might be just due to a poor brand of pitas, though, so I'm not counting that against the recipe. Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure we'll have this again!

These were so good!  The only thing I changed was regular apple cider vinegar because I didn't have rice vinegar.  Better than the state fair!

5 star.  I made homemade pitas (easy to make!) with Peppy's Pita Bread recipe on allrecipes.  I made my own balsalmic vinaigrette and my own Greek seasoning.  I used 3 full boneless skinless chicken breasts and had more than enough for 4 pitas.  I cut them in thirds to make them grill faster (8 mins each side).  I also used regular black pitted olives (way less expensive).  Next time I will make half the amount of sauce.

Though I did not use the marinade for this recipe (due to time constraints) I did follow the rest of it.  This having been the first time I have ever attempted to make Gyros.  It was delicious!  A winner with the whole family & I will definitely be making this again!

Really great recipe!  The marinade gave the chicken good flavor and the sauce was delicious.  We had to use dried dill as our grocer didn't have any fresh.  We also skipped the olives, pepperoncini and feta in the final product, but will include those next time.

I have never reviewed a recipe and I had to review this one!  Soooo good! I didn't have the money to spend on the dill or the rice vinegar (I just used white), I grilled the chicken on a Foreman grill, oh, and I didn't have Greek Seasoning. But this was STILL delicious! I definitely recommend it!

The chicken was not as flavourful as I thought it would be on it's own.  But it tasted good served in a pita with lots of tzaziki to give it some taste.  I would save my expensive balsamic vinegar for another recipe.

First time ever making a chicken souvlaki & tzatziki sauce recipe and it was FANTASTIC!! We generally only eat Greek food while in Northern Virginia and now we don't even have to do that - restaurant quality right in our own home. I thought for sure it would take several tries or several recipes before finding the perfect fit but not at all. I made minor changes: I do not like dill so I didn't use it. I also didn't use mint. However, I compensated for it by using a lot more of the Greek seasoning. I also did not have Rice Wine Vinegar, so after reading several other recipes for the Tzatziki sauce, I used Red Wine Vinegar. It was amazing sauce, absolutely amazing. I marinated the chicken in my homemade salad dressing (not balsamic but still a viniagrette using apple cider vinegar) and the chicken still rocked. I sauteed it in a non stick pan with all the marinade - oh and I marinated it for 24 hours. I served on Naan bread with a small salad of romaine (thinly sliced), red onions (thinly sliced) and tomatoes and we drizzled the Tzatziki on the top. Thank you so much for osting this recipe.

The BF and I loved this.  He went back for extra helpings.  Truly delish.  I was worried about the amount of oregano in the marinade, but it was fine.  Also, for those earlier reviews saying it's sour, are you sure you used balsamic vinagrette and NOT balsamic vinegar?    Indeed, the meat was not sour nor was it overly oregano-ey.    I paired it with the "greek style potatoes" also from this site.    Delicious!  Thanks for a winner!

I followed the directions almost exactly, and even though at first it looked like there were a ton of ingredients, I had most of them on hand and it was very easy to prepare. The only change I made was to use a combo of dried oregano, basil, and parsley instead of the Greek seasoning (they didn't have any at the store). I marinated the chicken for 8 hours, but I the flavor of the marinade did not really come though on the grill, so next time I think I'll cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and bake it in the marinade to get it juicier and more flavorful. The Tzatziki sauce was very good in flavor but a bit too thick for my preference (probably because I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt) so I thinned it with a couple of splashes of milk. Excellent meal, served along with some baked fries, and I liked it so much I'm thinking about serving it for my next party (but with the chicken baked in the marinade!).

I wasn't crazy about the chicken, but the tzatziki sauce was amazing.  I left out the rice vinegar, and I didn't miss it.  Also, after making the sauce a few times, I cut some of the calories and fat by replacing the yogurt and sour cream with about 1 cup of nonfat greek yogurt and a 1/4 cup of plain yogurt.  The flavor is pretty similar.

Superb marinade ingredients for the chicken!  I let it marinate two days, and baked it in the marinade mix (uncovered) for about 30 minutes at 350 (preheated).  Used a balsamic vinaigrette recipe for the vinaigrette rather than a store-bought brand. The tzataiki sauce was very complex and delicious also.  I used Greek yogurt and strained it for about 3 hours to thicken it, and substituted 1 tsp dried dill for the fresh dill.  Make sure you drain and squeeze out the moisture from the cukes, as the consistency of the sauce will be creamier.   The sauce was good with the chicken, good on Greek pita, and leftoever, was very good on baked potato.

Fantastic is all I can say.  We grilled chicken tenders and then served everything on a platter.  I built my Gyro and took a bite and could not believe we replicated one of our favorite dishes!  Even the recipe for the Tzatziki sauce was perfect.  Thank you, we will make it again!

AMAZING! But I did make some changes, so I'm giving it a 4 star. For the tzatziki sauce I omitted the vinegar, added 2 cloves of garlic, removing the pith, and strained the yogurt. I decided not to use the grill, so instead I browned the chicken breasts stovetop (after marinating for 6 hours) at a high temp (about 4 mins per side). Then I put them into a pan with red onions, poured about 1/2 cup of white wine around them, and placed in a 325F oven for 20 minutes. They came out amazingly juicey- perfect! Also, for the marinade, I decreased the amount of balsamic and added about 1/4 cup of olive oil. DELICIOUS!

Fantastic! We have a Greek restaurant around the corner from us and the kids LOVE the gyro wraps there. This is pretty darn close (except for the pita bread...just can't find the amazing pita bread that they get). Thanks for sharing!  Wonderful!

We ate this for three days straight!  I doubled the recipe for lots of leftovers.  I can't believe how easy it is to make authentic cucumber sauce!  No more running to the sub shop for gyros.

I made this for a bbq get together because we wanted to try something different and healthier than burgers and sausages.  It was a hit!!  I marinated it over night and bbq'd it when the guests arrived.  everyone asked for the recipe.  I think this is my new go to recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used fat free balsamic vinaigrette from Trader Joes in the marinade. I may make just the chicken sometime because I thought it was very flavorful on its own. I used low fat sour cream and fat free yogurt in the tzatziki sauce. I used fresh dill from my garden. I may have put too much in because it was very strong. The sauce still tasted very good, though. I don't like cucumbers, but for some reason I like tzatziki sauce. I didn't use the olives or pepperoncini, but I don't think they were missed. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

chicken was too intense, and the tzatziki was missing that super garlicky kick that Im use to. Probably won't make again

I made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great. Before I marinated the chicken breasts, I cut slits in the tops of the breast so that the marinade would penetrate the meat better. When I cooked them on the grill I laid them with the skin side up (or the side that used to have skin). I grilled the meat almost all the way through before flipping it over. When it was done, the meat was very juicy and tender. 
The cucumber sauce was excellent!! The bread I used was naan which I made last night from a recipe found on this website. 
Great recipe- we are glad we will be eating leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Very, very good.  Only thing I did different and it was only because I did not get the time to marinate the chicken.  So, seasoned the chicken breasts with a garlic seasoning, S&P, and grilled and then sliced and tossed with the marinade.  A great solution should you find that you were not able to marinate the chicken ahead.  Came out great this way too.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I'm not sure how to rate this dish and I'll tell you why. I printed the recipe to make it and it printed weird so I marinated the chicken in the marinade with the garlic, dill, and Greek seasoning added. I have to say it was fantastic and will make it again with my goof up. Everyone loved it. I served it with Yia Yia's Tzatziki from this site because I can't cheat on that recipe.
A good long marinade is the key- I marinated for 8 hours.
Thanks for sharing- great flavor in this recipe.

This was superb! I didn't use the pita step, but followed the grilled chicken and Tzatziki steps to the letter. I could not have been more pleased with the way it turned out -- tender, moist, and delicious. The Tzatziki can be made well ahead of time and the chicken marinated overnight, which leaves only the grilling for the last minute.
This is going to become one of my "go to" recipes for guests.

Love this tzadziki (sp?). Being a NYer living in the South, it's kinda hard to find Greek food but a few weeks ago I had the most amazing chicken gyro and was determined to learn to recreate it at home. This is it! The chicken marinade is fine, but the cucumber sauce is the real winner, I used red wine vinegar and dried dill, still came out wonderful!

Super super good!!!! A little too much oregano in the marinade. I made a couple small changes. I broiled the chicken as some other reviewers did. I didnt have any greek seasoning for the tzatziki but there is a recipe for it on this site and I used everything in that recipe except the mint, thyme and majoram. It came out delicious!! I have been craving gyros from a little place down in Brandon, FL called Romano's. This is not Romano's gyros, but it definitely satisfied my craving.

So simple and delish!  I used baby (seedless) cucumbers and chopped them instead of shredding. I also doubled the amount of cucumbers and garlic for the sauce.  I used Greek Yogurt and had no problem with the sauce being watery. I followed the rest of the recipe to a tee.  This completely satisfied my craving for gyros.  THANK YOU FOR POSTING.

This was SO good! I wanted the chicken to be well marinated, so I cut it up into one inch pieces, marinated the pieces for about three hours, then skewered them and grilled the skewers. I made the sauce two hours in advance so the flavors would have some time to meld and it was perfect! (Note: I couldn’t find fresh dill so I substituted 1 tsp dried dill in place of the fresh). My husband couldn’t get enough of it! Thanks for the great recipe! Well definitely be making it again.

The tzatziki sauce was salty. I'd tone that down. Other then that, pretty good.

Fantastic!  Used garlic flat bread, could not find thick pita. Excellent!  Used about an 8 inch piece of foil to wrap up gyro (check photos),works extremely well.  Place all items in small bowls and let everyone make it to their liking. Rave reviews.  Left over cucumber Tzatziki sauce is great for a light salad dressing.

This recipe is the closest to authentic greek food I've been able to make at home. It tastes soooo good! Rave reviews from everyone who tries it, especially the tzatziki sauce.  The chicken has great flavor and the sauce tastes better than our local greek place's version! I've substituted dried dill in a pinch and it works well.  Also, I make my own balsamic vinaigrette and it is a good sub too.  I've made this recipe five or six times now, paired with Peppy's Pita bread (from allrecipes) and a green salad with feta croutons, radishes, zucchini and a lemon vinaigrette.  YUM!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I skipped the tzatziki and pita due to dietary restrictions. I marinated sliced tomatoes and very thinly sliced red onion in the marinade overnight (I made the balsamic vinaigrette using a recipe from another site, just omitted the brown sugar). The next day, I removed them from the marinade and added the chicken. I left the chicken in for a little over an hour while I was cooking the tomatoes and onions. Since the marinade is pretty acidic, I wouldn't recommend marinating too long - an hour to an hour and a half is probably enough. It turned out well.

This was my first attempt at homemade souvlaki/gyros. This wonderful recipe made me realize how easy it is to make something so delicious! Would definitely recommend for cooks of all levels.

I only made the chicken (I used a different tzatziki recipe). I was a little dubious that something so simple could turn out good, but in fact it was delicious. I added a couple cloves of garlic and an onion; I cooked it in a saucepan and included the marinade which I let cook down to a thick sauce/coating on the chicken.

This was amazing!  The chicken marinated for almost 3 hours - so tender and juicy - and flavorful!  Paired really well with the "buffet style" fixings - peppers, olives, cucumber, etc.  I had store bought tzatziki sauce, but regardless, this is recipe was a keeper (even the 3 coworkers my hubby brought home were impressed!)  Thanks!!

I made this as part of a Greek themed meal - and had another meat for pita  construction.  (I only used the chicken marinade part of this recipe - not anything else.)  This was an absolute hit!  My parties almost always include children.  This recipe (for the marinade) was devoured by children and sophisticated palates alike!  I did the same as reviewer Saveour631 - I used 2/3 cup balsamic and 1/3 olive oil instead of a bottled balsamic vinaigrette.  Delicious!

This was my first taste of Greek food and I loved it.  I can't eat wheat, so I didn't use the pitas.  I made it into a lettuce wrap and it worked out wonderfully.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I didn't have the balsamic vinaigrette, so I substituted Red wine vinaigrette salad dressing, and chose to use pork instead of chicken. The meat was visibly moist as I was slicing through it. I made these gyros for some friends and they were a big hit. I didn't make the tzatziki with this recipe. In my opinion it strays too far from the authentic recipe (I'm Greek), but it might be worth a try as well.

This recipe is the real deal!  We enjoy going eating Greek food a lot, but since we live in a small town it is hard to come by unless we drive an hour out of our way.  The chicken is seasoned great and the tzatziki sauce tastes just like the one at Ali Baba's Gyros.

The chicken marinade is awesome! Leftover chicken is great the next day just by itself or in a sandwich. Tzatziki sauce is pretty good to but it makes a lot. Next time I'll half the recipe for 4 servings. I didn't have rice vinegar, so I substituted it for a mix of 3 parts white vinegar and 1 part water. Cant even notice a difference.

Thought this was really nice and flavorful. Both the Souvlaki marinade and the Tzatziki sauce. I spread the inside of the pita pockets with plain hummus and put Tabbouleh salad in the bottom, then sliced up the chicken and placed on top of the tabbouleh, finished with a dab of the Tzatziki sauce. Delicious!

Not exactly like in a Greek restaurant, but the meat is delicious! I did not want to grill mine outside, so used a heavy cast iron skillet. Drained most of the marinade and cooked, then drained the rest and cooked some more.  Have made tzatziki for years and never used rice vinegar.  I added some Balsamic vinegar instead today as I had it on hand.  It tinges the tzatziki a bit more brown, but it is still delicious.  Did not have Greek seasonings and did not miss them.  Served with Macedonian beans (a roux of oil, flour, seasoned salt, and hot paprika into jalapeno pinto beans, then bake for 15 minutes) and voila! A delicious Mediterranean meal!

Fantastic!  I used 1/2 c balsamic vinegar + 1/2 c olive oil + 1 tsp dried mustard + a little salt for the vinaigrette.  Baked at 350 for about 45 minutes in a glass dish with some marinade for moisture.  Made double the tzatziki b/c it was SO good.  Thanks!

I agree with some others that it is very tart, although make sure you don't do what I did -- balsamic vinigarette, not vinegar!   The Tzatziki sauce was quite good.  I think high quality, fresh pita bread would have made this a homerun.

This has become one of our favorite recipes. To maximize the flavors and contrast in textures, here is what I do.  1) In grilling the chicken (which I do on an indoor grill), I start at a low heat, then when the chicken is pretty much cooked, I fire the heat up to get a nice crunch and some grill marks. This helps caramelize the balsamic vinegar, which is important to me because I don't like things that are doused in balsamic. Also by cooking primarily at low heat the chicken is more moist.  2) For the tzatziki (which to me is the highlight of the dish), I add more garlic, at least doubling it. (This was the recommendation of a few Greek coworkers of mine). I find the tzatziki to be outrageously good, I love it. Also, if you keep a kosher home or are lactose intolerant, use the Tofutti brand sour cream and omit yogurt (this is what I do). You won't be disappointed, but you might be amazed at how good it is!

Excellent!!  I had no yogurt, so used only sour cream, with a bit of extra rice vinegar and a squeeze of lemon juice.  Dry dill and oregano work just as well as fresh, and sauteing the chicken is equally delish as grilling.  Definitely a keeper!

This hit the spot! I love Greek food, but don't always want to have to go out to get it. For the marinade I used the balsamic vinegar instead of the vinaigrette because that's what I had on hand, added minced garlic and I loved it! I also used Greek yogurt over the plain. I made a quick lemon orzo soup to go with it and it was a perfect, quick meal. Thanks for sharing!

This was truly excellent.  I only did the chicken and used store bought tzatziki just because i had it!  The chicken was moist and really delicious.  All four kids (all under the age of 8)plus my husband loved it!  Very tasty, we will make this again for sure.

This was good "all together" - but the chicken surprisingly lacked a bit of flavor despite 3+ hours of marinating.  I ended up having to season the chicken after grilling it because it was a bit bland.  I have my own tzatziki recipe and used that instead of the one listed.  Once assembled into a sandwich with the sauce, tomato, red onion, kalamata olives and feta - it was delicious - but certainly not outstanding.  I used a homemade balsamic dressing made with 1/2 c. balsamic vinegar, 1/2 c. olive oil, thyme,  oregano, and salt/pepper to taste (next time I will add garlic).

Too much vinegar - it was really overpowering. The tzatziki was bland and kind of running. Thank you for contributing though.

The sauce was terrific!  Very authentic.  I will definitely use that again.  As for the chicken and marinade, it wasn't good.  My mother is Sicilian and I grew up eating Gyros, so I get offended very easily. It was way too tangy and just bitter.  I would have preferred it without the marinade.  Oh, and it is pronounced (year-oh)!

This was very authentic tasting. Just enough lemon and herbs to really make it juicy. I think I added a little honey just for contrast. MMmmmmm.

I write reviews when the recipes are good. This chicken gyro was excellent. Very good and not complicated, I could not find greek seasoning at my grocer but it was good anyway. I also broiled my chicken for 8 min. on each side instead of grilling. Excellent recipe. Allrecipe users are sleeping on this recipe.

This souvlaki recipe is very good. The cucumber sauce tasted light and flavorful. I'll be making this again.

I'm  not really sure how chicken souvlaki should taste, but I do know that this recipe does make tasty chicken.

I added some onion slices to the marinade. I was also in a hurry so ended up stir frying the chicken in a wok, and it still came out great. Served this with tzatziki sauce and pita bread. Will definitely make again!

Off Da  Chain!! Savory And Succulent, the sauce is absolutely delicious.  The chicken is very tender a flavorful, the balsamic marinade made it taste totally like it’s souvlaki. love love this dish. Used indoor stove top grill. Tip: If you salt and let cucumbers stand  you don’t need to add more salt at the end of making the sauce. The sauce is so so savory and garlicky in flavor.

This is very good! I used to use a recipe that required me to skewer and broil the chicken and onions. Didn’t like that. Plus it took a ton of time. Now I just cube up the chicken, and roughly chop a red onion, and put it all in a baggie with the marinade for an hour. After the hour I dump it all out onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake at 350° for a 30-40 mins....stirring it up once during cooking. It’s so good! And it’s quite a lot! I could prob get 8-10 pita wraps out of this!

This recipe is exceptional and always a hit! I add much more seasoning to the chicken marinade (which I marinate overnight), and add more seasoning to the tzatziki as needed. It's not necessary, but we like a lot of flavor. Close to an authentic gyro, I was shocked by how delicious it was.

This was the most awesome chicken gyros I have ever eaten and I live on the south side of Chicago, where chicken gyros are of abundance.  Definitely a keeper! I usually have to "doctor" a recipe to my liking, but not this one!  Thank you! Will probably make again in a few days, with all of the tzatziki sauce I have leftover (I doubled batch)

We loved this recipe! Per the suggestions of others, I used plain greek yogurt which gave the sauce a really nice thicker consistency. I  used 1/2 tbsp of dried dill, instead of fresh. I sprinkled the shredded cucumber with salt and let it sit for a few minutes. I then put the cucumber in a sieve with a heavy bowl/object on top, to drain off any excessive liquid. I made the sauce the night before so the flavors had time to meld. I added the chicken to marinade before leaving for work in the morning. Since I knew I would be rushed for dinner, I bought already chopped (bagged) romaine lettuce and jars of sliced pepperoncinis and kalamata olives. The most important thing is to buy a GOOD,  thicker pita/flatbread. We found a brand called "Papa Pita Flat Bread" that was wonderful! The first time I made this it was cold and snowing in our beautiful state of Minnesota, so I cooked the chicken breast on our old George Foreman grill. ;-) Everything turned out wonderful! Definitely will be adding this to our regular rotation.

I made it once as described and had too much chicken. I used the leftover chicken and served it over a bed of rice that I had mixed with greek seasoning. Both ways were very delicious. Will make again for sure!

I've made this recipe so many times.  Easily one of my favorites.  Don't change a thing and it is spot on.  Substitute whatever meat you like and it is equally as good.  Make extra sauce because it is a great veggie dip when left over!

Anyone on this site saying that the marinade had too much vinegar used the wrong thing - there is NO vinegar in the marinade recipe - it's balsamic vinegar DRESSING, and the marinade tastes great!  I let my chicken breasts marinade for seven hours in the refrigerator, and  they came out tasting like those we've had in Greece.  I like Chef John's tzatziki sauce that doesn't include sour cream or olive oil, but did go ahead and add the Greek seasoning that this recipe calls for - made the best tasting sauce, as well!

The best souvlaki and tzatziki I've ever had!  Even better than our local Greek restaurants.  Even my 1 year old devoured it!!  He just LOVED the tzatziki sauce!  The only ingredient I changed was the rice vinegar; substituted for apple cider vinegar with a little sugar added.  It was so good, I'm gonna make it again tonight!!

This is one of my favorite recipes, and one of the go-to meals in our house when we have the time to make it.  It's rather time consuming to put together, but oh-so worth the effort.

Rather than cooking the chicken on the grill, I cook the chicken on the stove (marinade mixture and all) until the marinade mix reduces and leaves a dark, delicious coat on the chicken.

Love this recipe! I think it's even better than our fave Greek place because I can customize it. I like to do a little less cucumber and a lot more dill in the sauce. I also spread the sauce over the pita first instead of using it as a topping. Top it with crunchy Romaine, some fresh tomatoes, and a bit of chopped red onion and you've got yourself a hella good dinner.

One of my favorite recipes Ive found on the web. Ive worked at a Greek restaurant and never thought I could make a dinner as good if not better then those chefs. I drained my yogurt 24 hours and cucumbers about 3 hours, which is overlooked here. Make the sauce as thick as possible. As always i tripled the garlic. The longer the sauce sits in the fridge the better this gets, its quite amazing. Made this for a get together and was asked for the recipe by quite a few of the guests.

I recommend making and using a garlic paste for the sauce. Simply blend peeled garlic and just enough olive oil to create a paste. Very potent and blends well in sauces. I make enough to keep around, stays good for about 4 weeks.

Very good and very easy!  My whole family loved this. My picky 16yo even ate the leftovers on here own.  I love the twang from the olives and pepperoncinis.  you don't even have to put in the pita bread.. When I ate the leftovers for lunch I just put everything on top of the chicken and ate... very low carbs that way.  I will for sure make this again!

I added thin sliced onion, green pepper, and red pepper to chicken once it was cooked, then covered to soften - my family just prefers it this way.  This recipe is AMAZING.  Loved the Tzatziki sauce - was perfect.  The seasoning/marinade for the chicken was incredible.  The entire family loved this and it will be put into our rotation of meals.

Oh my...most yummy stuff ever!  Made it with Naan recipe from this site (per suggestion of another review) and Tzatziki sauce. The only reason I stopped eating was due to the fact that I had to leave some for my family. 
Even after reading the recipe and reviews, crazy me still used balsamic vinegar...sigh!...thankfully I caught my mistake and made another batch of chicken with the VINAIGRETTE dressing. The messed up vinegar chicken was barely touched, vinaigrette chicken was gone in a flash. It's just that good!!

The most delicious, real-tasting souvlaki marinade & tzatziki sauce I've had outside of a Greek festival. Definitely worthy of company!

I fixed this last night as written. My son, who is a chicken souvlaki connoisseur, couldn't lay off it! Dinner last night.  And this morning I found a note from him saying he couldn't resist & had had it for a midnight snack.  While the list of ingredients for the sauce seems long, it takes no time to whip it up. This is most definitely going into our regular dinner rotation.  With winter upon us, we're going to grill a big batch of the chicken & have it ready to go in the freezer.

This recipe is LEGIT!  Turned out much better than expected...as good as any gyro I've had before.

So I didn't have any Balsamic Vinagrette so I used the following for my marinade:  1/4 cup olive oil, 2 tbspns lemon juice, 2 tbspns balsamic vinegar, 1 tspn garlic powder, 1 tspn salt, 1/2 tspn pepper, 1/2 tspn each of dried marjoram, thyme, rosemary and oregano. (per lizzy217's recipe from this site)

Followed the recipe for the tzatziki sauce as written; it's really good!

Lovely!  I used this recipe for the chicken marinade and the toppings, but I used my own Tzatziki sauce recipe (from a friend who's Greek).  This sauce recipe looks quite similar, so I would definitely give it a whirl next time.  I loved the idea to use chicken to enjoy gyros.  Thanks so much!

Super easy, idiot proof recipe! I used a little more oregano than it called for and it was great! I also used about a pound of chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts and cooked them on my George Forman grill - came out PERFECT

Oh my goodness, this is delish!!  I didn't have enough yogurt, so I made up the difference with the sour cream (3/4 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup sour cream) and it was just fine.  I added a little extra dill and Greek seasoning to our taste. It was amazing.  It tasted just like our local restaurant's souvlaki pita, if not better.  This recipe will definitely be a keeper for us.

Delicious.  Everyone loved it.  Used plain Greek yogurt because I happened to have it on hand.  I let my chicken marinate for about 4 hours and it was flavorful and moist.  Thanks for sharing.

Our family and friends loved this recipe.  Chicken Souvlaky Gyro Style is another food I will not be eating out. Fantastic Recipe easy to make, the Tzatziki sauce was creamy just as good or better than the restaurants.

This is outstanding! So packed with flavor!  The chicken was so tender from the marinade. I cooked it on the Foreman grill.  The Tzatziki sauce was spot on. I laid the pita bread over my electric burner to heat it up. My company raved over it.  A regular in our rotation.

I made the tzatziki sauce to accompany another Greek chicken recipe.  I strained the yogurt, and used 1 teasp. dried dill.  My son and I thought it was a little sour (might leave out the sour cream next time) but my husband loved it and declared the meal "the best you've ever cooked!"  He's glad there were leftovers to use as vegetable dip.

This was delicious!  The sauce was so good.  I added a bit more greek seasoning, but that is the only change I made.    I would like to find a recipe for making my own pita bread.  Its hard to find a good soft pita at my local grocer.

I have been making this marinade for years. Everyone who eats this chicken cannot believe how tender it is. The only thing I do differently is to use 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar and 2 Tbsp of olive oil instead of the balsamic dressing/vinagrette. I think it is best marinated overnight. I serve this with dill dip (I like better than tzaziki) and then I serve it with a greek salad made of chunks of cucumber, tomatoes, red onion slices, feta cheese, and kalamata olives. I toss this with the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this website. It is awesome. There are never any leftovers!!

OMG OMG OMG this is SO good! The chicken is flavourful, juicy and tastes amazing on the grill. Just make sure to use vinegarETTE not straight balsamic vinegar and this recipe will knock your socks off!

I have been searching for a good chicken souvlaki recipe forever, and I found my keeper. My husband LOVES greek style food but we can never find a Greek restaurant out where we just moved. Very good recipe... my hubby got his Greek fix for now.

OK the cucumber sauce made it all worth it, but the chicken definitely was not worth the effort. Don't get me wrong, it tasted... nice. but good ol' salt and pepper would have done it better. It didn't reapply taste right for gyros to me. But maybe I just don't know any better. I usually used garam masala, curry, turmeric, cumin rubbed on it and I think I will stick with that next time.

The tzatziki sauce was spot on and if this recipe were based on that alone I'd give it 5 stars.  I put two cloves are garlic rather than one just due to me and my husband being garlic fiends.  The chicken, on the other hand, was not quite what we were expecting.  It may just be because we're used to how souvlaki is make at the restaurant we go to or the local Greek festival, but it was just way too sweet for this type of dish and lacked flavor.  I marinated it for about 8 hours, used balsamic vinaigrette (not vinegar, as others accidentally did), and followed the recipe to a T.  We just weren't pleased at all with the chicken.  I would also take the time to make my own pita next time.  As far as flavor was concerned, the delicious tzatziki made the dish but the chicken was lacking.  I'd use this recipe again for a guideline but would make the chicken differently.  Thank you though for the amazing tzatziki recipe!

Every year during mardi gras there is a booth that sales these... until now I haven't been able to make the chicken or (also used lamb) part of it. The sauce, amazing and yes.... use the salad dressing and not just the vinegar it'll taste horrible that way. The only thing I change is I use a light dressing and dont add oil to the sauce and use light sour cream and ff yogurt that I let sit over night in the fridge in a strainer with paper towels to thicken up a little. That sauce is good on just about anything... this, just pita bread, as a dip for veggies, a car bumper, doesn't matter.

Very good recipe. I only changed a few things from the original recipe. I used balsamic vinegar and olive oil because I didn't want to buy the prepared salad dressing. I omited the Greek seasoning only because I could not find it in any of my local grocery stores (and it still tasted great). Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe as written. My whole family enjoyed the meal. It will become part of our regular recipe rotation.

Awesome recipe!! The tsatziki was amazing and flavorful and the chicken marinade was spot on.  I will try to upload a photo as soon as I figure it out how to show how I plated this.  My bf swears it looked like a restaurant meal.  I will definitely keep this.  As a way of using up the leftover tsatziki, I poured the remainder over chilled red potatoes to creat Greek Potato Salad.  Another gigantic hit!

Better than our local restaurant's chicken gyros according to my father and husband! Used a bit more garlic and a bit less dill. Most importantly, I used fresh, homemade pita bread--makes all the difference in the world and isn't that hard to make. So much softer and tastier than store bought--take the time to make your own!!

I make this at least twice a month - my teenage son, who is a picky eater, requests it!  I use the "Balsamic Vinaigrete" recipe from this site to make the dressing.  It's terrific even if you only marinade the chicken for an hour.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was very good as is but I love to tinker. I added 1/4 tsp of rosemary and 1/4 tsp of thyme. I think the chicken could use a little salt or maybe a little garlic salt which is why im giving it four stars. I used a store bought tzatziki so i cant comment on that, but next time I will make it because of all the rave reviews. The store bought pita bread left a lot to be desired so im gonna try and make peppy's pita bread from this site the next time and will update with the changes. Also left out the olives, peppers and feta because it is good without all of the extras but Im positive they would all be yummy additions.

I absolutely loved this!!!  I didn't have the pita - so I made them. I didn't have the greek seasonings - so I had to look for a recipe from my favorite recipe site (allrecipes).  I didn't have any balsamic vinaigrette, but I did have a a rasberry vinaigrette dressing that I used and added balsamic vinegar.  I don't like olives and I didn't have pepperoncini or feta.  No biggie because it still turned out fabulous!    I had to laugh because as my husband was grilling the chicken he was commenting on how he didn't like the smell (blah, blah) and he didn't think he'd like it.  As we were finishing up dinner he commented on how he really like it.  He, he, he!  We served it with grilled zucchini.  Then had it for lunch the next day and I plopped the zucchini in the pita.  This will definately become a bi-monthly recipe!

Great recipe, especially the sauce... MM...  You definitely want to use greek yogurt though, I can't imagine its the same!  We marinated the chicken for an hour (weeknight dinner, not planned well) but it definitely needed more time marinating.    We made our own vinaigrette using half olive oil and half balsamic vinegar, but I think it was too much vinegar.

I made minimal changes to this recipe, and I think you'll agree that they didn't fundamentally change the recipe. I don't like to review recipes that I change because then it's not really the real recipe, know what I mean?  Changes I made: I cooked the chicken on the stove in the marinade instead of on the grill. It intensified the flavor of the chicken and was VERY good. I chopped the cucumbers instead of shredding, and I used white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar because that's what I had.  This was SOOOO good. My 2 year old daughter gobbled it up. She especially like the "stinky sauce," as she called it. I agree with her. It was so good, I could sit and eat it straight from the bowl with a spoon! Definitely a keeper.

I was very impressed by the tsatziki sauce!  I used fat free yogurt and fat free sour cream, yet it still tasted good.  I also used 2 teaspoons of dry dill weed instead of fresh, and, still, it was great.

I have tried other recipes on this site and the reviews turn out pretty accurate. I was surprised to experience the opposite for this recipe. The marinate was terrible and the meat was barely edible. Similar to other reviews, the combination of balsamic vinegar AND lemon made it too sour. I was hoping that the sourness would dissipate over time by sitting in the fridge and though I was right, the meat turned very sweet instead (I'm guessing from the balsamic vinegar). I will not try this recipe again and in the future I will trust my instinct and question a recipe with vinegar AND lemon combined. Risk this recipe only if you have other food to substitute.

We like these gyros, they are good!  I used an easier recipe for tzatziki sauce, so I can't comment on that.  Instead of pita bread, which I find to be dry, I used naan, an Indian bread I found in our deli section. I warmed it up in the oven for a couple of minutes, it was soft and delicious for the gyros!  I might try to kick up the spice in the chicken marinade next time, and also add some salt to the marinade.  I will make this again, family loved it.

Amazing recipe! My husband's family is Greek, and he couldn't believe how great it was. A decent shortcut is to buy the premade Tzatziki(sp?) sauce, and I agree 100% with the reviewer about buying good quality pitas- this can really make or break this amazing recipe!

You know when you've been craving something for a while, then you make it and you feel like it just didn't hit the spot? This Recipe, DID hit the spot! It was EXACTLY what i was looking for, exactly how i remembered it from working in a Greek diner when i was in high school. I made it for friends last night for dinner and everyone loved it. I didn't change a thing. I even made more of the marinade for today so i could make grilled chicken sandwiches tonight for dinner. I can't wait to make it again! YUM!

Loved this meal.  I marinated the chicken in a ziploc bag with Italian dressing which I added about 1/4 tspn of Greek seasoning to.  I marinated it for about two days.  Hadn't planned on marinating it that long but that's how it worked out.   The yogurt sauce is delicious.  My family loved this one.  We ate until we were almost sick.

I am only rating the sauce, not the chicken.  It was ok but it was a bit bitter.  I added a pinch of sugar but that didnt seem to help.  I am still searching for the perfect tzatziki sauce, this was not it.

This marinade is delicious!  I will be making this often.  FYI: When making the tzatziki use a coffee filter to strain the yogurt sourcream/ yogurt mixture for a few hours and that will eliminate a lot of the excess liquid.

Great recipe, with just one note. It really didn't say how long t marinage the chicken breasts. I let them sit over night, and this was too long! Although I enjoy the flavour of balsamiv vinigar, it was just too much! Will deffinetly make again, just with shorter marinade time. LOVED the tzatziki. For veggies I used green & red peppers as well as tomatoes, lettus, and red onion. Will DEFFINETLY make again :)

This recipe was incredible! I just used the marinade and bought the sauce. I served on grilled flatbread with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions  and feta. I got rave reviews and have already passed this recipe on to a friend. Will be making again and again.

I cooked the chicken on a George Forman grill, so it came out a little on the dry side.  I live in an apartment, so grilling was out of the question.  I also used non-fat Fage Greek yogurt to make the tzazki sauce.  That came out great!!  Overall, this came out well.

Wow!  At last the secret of the great tasting sauce (Tzatziki or cucumber) that is served with Chicken Souvlaki at the best, or even the lowliest, Greek Restaurants (or Diners).  Thanks, Chris

The marinade was just okay and the tzatziki was way too complicated. I guess I'm just a simple cook.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  Needs no adjustments! Only thing is, I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because that’s all I had on hand. This will definitely be a favorite in our house!

sauce was perfect.  Chicken was tender and delicious.  I will probably marinate the chicken longer than an hour though as I feel it could have used more flavor.  I'll try and spice it up a bit more next time

I follow directions and used listed ingredients.  The sauce was good and the marinade gave the chicken a nice flavor...but still, I felt like it was missing something. 
It seemed bland...heaping on a lot of olives and pepperoncinni seemed to help, so maybe it just needed more salt. 
I've only had Greek food a few times so not much to compare this recipe to. It is a light and healthy seeming recipe.

My husband, who doesn't cook often, made these for me for Mother's Day at my request. Absolutely delicious. Kids loved them too! We topped with store bought tzatziki and served on lightly grilled naan bread.

I never add dill to any recipes really, but I did add in order to keep with the recipe. I did like it, but will omit next time. This was a really good recipe to follow and easy to modify to your liking. I will omit dill next time and add a lot more garlic. Also, being a huge mayo fan, I love adding about 1/4c to cucumber sauce.

Loved this!! Followed the recipe exactly except I left out the pepperoncini (just not a fan of them). For those of us who are gluten-free I used gluten-free wraps, and it was still great! Ate leftover chicken and cucumber sauce on a salad the next day. Don't be intimidated by the long list of ingredients. It's pretty easy. I marinated the chicken before I went to work. Then when I came home I made cucumber sauce, then while chicken cooked I cut up the lettuce & tomatoes and cleaned up. From start to table it only took 30 minutes.

Holy  guys!! This recipe is amazing. I followed it almost exactly.. meaning to the best of my ability. I cut up my chicken because I am a college student in an apartment so all I have is a George Foreman grill, it still came out amazing. The tzatiki sauce recipe is awesome too. Like everything is so on point. I had it with a Greek style salad and roasted potatoes! So much leftovers but I'm glad.. now I have healthy meals for a few days.

I don't know how one "shreds" a cucumber, so I "diced" one into the smallest pieces I could manage.  Still, this was delicious,  The vinegar content was too high for my husband, though, and he had to have cold cuts instead.  Poor fellow.

Great marinade. I used waaay more cucumbers to get the sauce to the right taste as well as a TON more seasoning than is recommended. If you nail the tzatziki sauce then you will mostly likely nail the meal so definitely follow your taste buds. 

The plain yogurt you choose can make the sauce turn out differently. Some yogurt has a very bitter aftertaste, like what I used, and you will end up putting crazy amounts of dill, greek seasoning, and salt to try to drown out the bitterness.

I cooked it at the stove because I didn't feel like grilling the chicken. It would have turned out a whole lot better over an open flame but it was great regardless.

Delicious, made with veggies and herbs from the garden. Fresh and light for a summer meal. Followed the recipe as written, with the exception of fresh oregano and added avocado just because I had a ripe one.

This recipe is a keeper! It's very easy, considering how many ingredients are required, and so delicious!! I've actually used this marinade and just eaten the chicken grilled, without completing the recipe, and even that is phenomenal. I wouldn't change a thing!

I've made this a few times, it is fantastic.  Following the advice of others, I increased the lemon, doubled the garlic and put some of the greek seasoning in with the chicken while it marinated.  Added a couple splashes of siracha (just a little) to the tkatziki sauce.

This was awesome! I did everything pretty well exact, but I only had table salt, and bottled lemon juice, and didn't feel like removing cucumber seeds (ninja chopped it), and everything was perfect! I also prepped everything the night before, and cut up the chicken before marinating over night. This is a keeper!

Great sauce.  Does take some prep time, so not a quick meal to throw together during the work week.  My family loves this recipe and we make it several times throughout the year.

yum! I used balsamic vinegar and oil as substitute. I peeled the cucumber, and stuck it in the blender, and just squeezed the water from them. (didn't salt them) and I didn't used the greek seasoning, as I didn't have any. I also precut the chicken, before marinating, and broiled it. Everything was great and everyone ate it! Thanks!

I thought this was just okay.  With all the seasoning, I thought it would be more flavorful.  Family ate it up so I can't complain too much.  Maybe a little more tweaking.

Great recipe with lots of flavor!  For the marinade I just used balsamic vinegar to reduce some calories.  It would be good with a mix of balsamic and italian dressing if you don't have the vinaigrette.  The tzatziki sauce was good but it needed a bit more zip to it and I doubled the garlic.  Maybe next time I will replace the rice vinegar with apple cider or more balsamic.  We layered ours with all the above except the olives.  Great tasting!  Thanks for the recipe!

I just used the marinaded chicken - delicious!  Put it with basmati rice, cooked onions and peppers.  Also delicious dipped in tzatziki sauce.  Would be great in pita bread but seems like too many carbs with the rice.

I thought this recipe was delicious. the vinagrette marinade was just perfect. I made this with chopped lettuce, red opinion, feta cheese, chopped tomatoes, I cheated and bought cucumber dill salad dressing for sauce. Was all very delicious, tasted as good as any restaurant at a fraction of the price. Wasn't difficult to make at all, either.

Great recipe!  I substituted Gorgonzola cheese for the Feta cheese because we are not big Feta fans.  I also used freshly picked Dill from the yard.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great base from which to work. The chicken is tasty. I used my usual tzatziki sauce recipe (I had some leftover from the night before). Thanks for an easy summer meal! The only change I made to the marinade was to use fresh oregano since I have TONS. I think dried might actually have been more flavorful, even though I tripled the amount called for like usual when converting dried to fresh.

This was soooo good!  I was craving our local Greek restaurant's chicken gyros and this definitely hit the spot.  I was a little wary of the balsamic vinaigrette in the marinade, but it turned out fantastic.  I did substitute Greek seasoning for the oregano in the marinade though. The tzatziki sauce is divine!  And it gets better as the flavors mellow together so I would make it a few hours ahead next time.  The grocery store was out of fresh dill so I used about 1 1/2 tsp dried dill, and could have used a little less.   So so so good!  Will definitely make again many times :)

Excellent chicken marinade, though I would have let is sit overnight instead of the hour recommended. The tzatziki sauce came out a little tart by itself, but it was not overwhelming when combined with the pita, chicken, and toppings. I used white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar and 1 tspn dried dill instead of fresh. The whole family, including our picky 5 year old, enjoyed this meal.

This was a hit at my dinner last night. The chicken was juicy and full of Greek goodness. I served it with a side of "Good For You Greek Salad" which I ended up sprinkling inside my gyro--it was awesome. The tzatziki sauce was creamy, cool, and a perfect complement to the grilled chicken. Over all, I highly recommend this recipe if you need to get your Greek fix!

This is a very nice change from regular lamb gyros. It was pretty easy to make. The only thing I didn't care for was the sauce was a bit too sharp from the rice vinegar. I think the lemon juice would have added enough bite by itself. Next time I will not add the rice vinegar. Other then that it was very tasty, the meat was very moist and tender. I served them how we get them at local restaurants, warmed pita filled with meat, fresh tomato wedges/slices and thinly sliced red onions. Sauce is served on the side so every one can add however much they want.

I loved this! Everything was pretty easy. I did grill some yellow squash and zucchini and added that to my gyro. I also served it with steak fries. The greek restaurant that my hubby and I went to when first married had steak fries with the tzatziki. I did omit the vinager in the tzatziki and added no pepprecinis to my gryo. I will make these again..SOON!

We love this! I made my own balsamic as well... served a Greek salad on the side with pitas. Everyone fights for the leftovers!

This was the best Souvlaki ever ! I made my own balsamic vinagrette but other than that I followed the entire recipe. Easy recipe to follow.   A huge hit in my house!

Yummy, I thought it was great, it is winter so I baked the chicken in the oven so it cooked in the marinade, then I cut into strips and grilled for few minutes before serving.  very good, thank you!!!

Yum!  I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, oregano, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper, and cumin, and it was delicious!  I didn't read the directions closely enough and used 1 Tablespoon of dried dill, which is much stronger than fresh.  If using dried again next time I will use 1 teaspoon instead.

I ended up making a different tzatziki sauce, but the souvlaki marinade is delicious!  I don't have a grill so I had to sear the chicken on the stove, and the marinade made this delicious crust.  So so good!

We loved these! No Greek restaurants here and we miss Greek food. We loved the falovr in this dish, we serve a Greek salad with it but sometimes we just make the chicken and put it in the salad.

This is a wonderful recipe. The tzatziki sauce is GREAT! I thought this was an excellent recipe which all blended nicely... light and healthy too! The second time we made I marinated the chicken overnight and it was even better. I recommend that! Thanks so much for sharing!

I only cooked the chicken part of this recipe and it was fabulous!  I let the chicken marinade overnight and then baked for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees (as another poster suggested).  Yummy, easy, and your house smells so good! Served the chicken with baked potatoes.  Can't wait to try the tzatziki sauce!

This is a very tasty recipe; however, it does require a bit of prep time and isn't something you can easily throw together after a long work day.  I also cooked the chicken in a pan on the stove (medium heat 8 minutes each side)  Some day I will have to try to make the pitas from scratch because I agree with other reviewers...the store bought ones just don't cut it.  I will make this recipe again.

We will keep this as a good, easy, fast meal! I had Sandwich Thins by Oroweat on hand so used that instead of the pita and I had the Tzatiki in the fridge. I also did not have the time to marinate the chicken that I cooked on my stove top grill pan. It was delicious without so I can't wait to marinate next time. My 7 yr old even ate it up. Thanks to Chris J.

My family enjoyed this recipe very much and felt like we had ordered greek take out.  The chicken was delicious. I did add 2 cloves of garlic to the marinade. As well, I did not have any whole chicken breasts, so I marinated the chicken pieces, and then placed them on wooden skewers.  I broiled them for about 15 mins. in my convection toaster oven.  Couldn't have tasted any better.  This chicken with the marinade would be great on it's own, in a salad, etc.

chicken was good. i use an easier tzatziki. just greek yogurt, sour cream, cucumber, garlic, and a hint of lemon juice. otherwise, the recipe is wonderful as is, even when cooking in the pan.

This was really delicious! My fiancé, who is really picky, really loved it. I'm trying to eat healthy so I used whole wheat pitas and nonfat yogurt and lite sour cream. It still turned out really wonderful even with these healthy changes. Will definately make this again.

The cucumber sauce was so good; I could probably eat it with a spoon! I would like to try using lamb next time. I used flat bread, and it worked great. I also cubed the cucumber as someone else suggested.

I used my own tzatziki recipe, but the chicken was really tasty. Be careful - balsamic vinaigrette is NOT the same as balsamic vinegar! You can make your own - there are some recipes on this website. I used the Syrian Bread recipe from this site for the bread. Excellent!

This is awesome! I cut my chicken into big chunks, marinated for about 8 hours and skewered them with chunks of vidalia onion for the grill. I used an English cuke with the skin left on grated, fat free Greek yogurt and reduced fat sour cream in the sauce which was excellent! I served these on whole wheat pita and made a tomato and feta salad from Ina Garten on Barefoot Contessa....the perfect side dish....Family loved this meal and will make again. Thanks!

My husband enjoyed the chicken.  We just loved the sauce! I made it almost exactly as written.  I just added a little bit more cucumber (I shredded one small cucumber and used all of it - prob 3/4 cup or so).  I used fat free plain greek yogurt.  It tasted best after sitting in the fridge for a few hours, so make ahead of time if you can.  I ate the tzatziki sauce with falafel (I'm vegetarian) and it was delicious with that as well!

This was fantastic, my friends and I devoured it!   We used rice vinegar since I didn't have what the recipe called for.  Still fab!  Would make again for sure!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I know it's meant to go on pitas but it was just too much bread for us.  Will make again and again but we will sub tortillas for the pitas.  I let the chicken marinate for about 6 hours.

The chicken was great.  I baked just as some other's suggested since it was not grilling weather.  The yogurt sauce was good, but I've had better.  Not sure what to change.  Maybe a little less sour cream.  Instead of pita, I served with a greek salad and some sour dough bread.  I put some raw veggies on the side to dip in the sauce which was a hit also.  It was good for a buffet type party.

Very easy and delicious! I only marinated the chicken for about 20 minutes and grilled it. It still had lots of flavor. The sauce is wonderful - really makes the dish. I found the thick, soft pitas at the regular grocery store and couldn't imagine using the thinner, drier pitas. The soft pitas fold around and hold in the fillings and taste much better.

This recipe was excellent!!!  Super easy and super budget friendly!!  I was able to find already chopped up chicken so it saved me a step..YUMMY!! Now that i'm on a low calorie diet..I used Fat Free sour cream, Fat free yougurt, and put the filling in a low fat wrap....figure friendly...still just as good!!!

just got back from turkey and dreaming of doner kebaps.  This was pretty good but nothing beats the original.  Things I'll change: sauce - I pureed in blender. I will use greek yogurt and omit the 1/2 cucumber with centers in favor of a full cucumber without middles.
I marinated for 40 min and baked for 30 in foil, removed juice and baked for additional 7.  meat was very juicy.  Cut into thin strips and served with pitas or rice. it was all gone!

Really good! Just like the Greek pita place down the street. All I would change next time is to grind the Greek seasoning with a mortar & pestle so its not crunchy/spiny in the tzatziki sauce. I put the chicken on the pita bread, folded it in half & put it on a George Foreman for a few minutes instead of grilling the bread. Added sauce/veggies after so theres a nice mixture of hot and cold. Delicious!

I thought this was fantastic.  Quick tip on using nonfat yogurt - drain with cheese cloth draped over a colander for 4 hours.  This makes a very thick and rich yogurt.

After goin to Greece on vacation, my husband and I craved good Greek food.  This marinade is amazing!  However, I did make some significant changes.  First I cooked my chicken in the crock pot for three hours (started frozen)then shred it and returned it to the marinade juices.  Trust me, this is amazing!  I also prefer the Tzatziki sauce by CAYCE.
Thanks so much for this recipe, we make it whenever we have a craving for Greek!

We use this recipe often. The kids are not as into Greek as we are so we use regular taco shells and regular cheese on theirs. I use the pampered chef greek season and love it. We also add olives and will use the left over meat in salads. Very tasty recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe! We really enjoy a great local greek restaurant, but with 5 mouths to feed, going out gets expensive. This is as close to the real greek restaurant as you can get.
Thanks so much for sharing. Followed exacctly as recipe reads and making tonight for the 3rd time!
Delicious!

This recipe is fabulous! The marinade gives the chicken so much flavor. Only thing I will do next time is cut the Tzatziki Sauce recipe in half. (makes more than you will ever need)
Anyways Great super easy meal, one of my families new favorites.

Probably the best meal I've ever made from allrecipes.  I used balsamic vinegar rather than vinaigrette (read it wrong), and a different tzatziki sauce because I didn't have greek seasoning on hand.  Ate with homemade pita.  Will be making this again and again!

Wow!  This recipe was really good!  My husband couldn't stop raving about how it tastes like it came from a greek restaurant.  

It's health-friendly too.  I strained some fat free plain yogurt all day while I was at work and used that for the yogurt part of the sauce. Also, I added a little more garlic to the sauce.

The chicken itself was very sweet.  The balsamic (which may have just been my specific balsamic) gave it a really sweet flavor.  However, when it was mixed with everything else it got kind of lost in there.  The flavor really didn't stand out in any special way.  I even marinated the chicken for 8 hours! The overall dish was really yummy though but I think I'd marinate the chicken differently next time.

I had a seperate tzatziki recipe, but I used the marinade recipe to make kababs.  It was so easy and so tasty. Cook this on the barbeque- the aroma will make your mouth water!

An awesome recipe, chicken came out very moist and tender, and balsamic vinegar tastes great as it reduces.  Will definitely be making this again.

My husband and I love this sandwich at the local Greek restaurant that we go to. We have always talked about making it at home and now we can. This tasted EXACTLY like the one at the restaurant. I used flatbread because I could not find pitas that were "soft" enough like what we were used to. The sauce is great! We served the sauce as the dressing on our salad as well, AWESOME!

So so so good! The smell of these cooking was unbelievable. They came out moist and juicy and wonderful. I served with pita, feta, lettuce and tzatziki. Thanks!

Well the sauce was not good, but the meat was great. I made the sauce exactly like it said in the recipe and it tasted like yogurt with lemon juice in it. I used all fresh ingredients. But the meat was delicious! Loved the marinade. I will definitely make the chicken this way again and again. I'll just use my own sauce. Thanks!

Such a great recipe. I took it to work for lunch the next day. I chopped the cucumbers; didn't shred. This is an entire meal, don't have to worry about sides or veggies with it. Great for a lunch in the summer, or to pack for a picnic.

Very Easy & very good. I didn't use the yogurt sauce recipe though - I just threw my own together.

I took the souvlaki marinade recipe for chicken breasts. Marinated for several hours..flavourful and fabulous!  Also made Greek style potatoes (from this website) to go with it. For the veggies I steamed fresh green beans in the micro wave for 6 mins then sauteed them in a pan with a little extra virgin olive oil (evoo) garlic, onions and a couple of squeezes of fresh lemon juice.  
REALLY GOOD!!!

These were wonderful!! I'm not the most advanced cook in the world and it was even easy for me! It also had a really authentic Greek taste (and trust me, my grandparents are from Greece!) The only thing I did different was that I let the the tzatziki sauce and the marinated chicked sit overnight. Next time I might use a little less dill just as personal preference, but other than that I thought it was great!!

This was so good.  I made the yogurt sauce a day ahead of time to let the flavors blend and it was terrific.  These gyros are a new part of my line-up!

YUM!!!!!!!!!!!  This is delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly- except the condiments.  I used iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and the sauce and nothing else.  These were SENSATIONAL!  I will make them again and again and again.  Plus, they were soooo easy.  Thanks so much for a delicious and easy dinner!  YUM!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was wonderful. It reminded me of the gyros my mom and I would get a the Wisconsin state fair; except with chicken. For the chicken, I used thin cut boneless skinless chicken breasts. For the balsamic vinegrette, I used Paul Newman's balsamic vinegrette dressing. I topped my gyros up with onion, tomato, and cucumber. Yummy!

My first attempt at cooking for my husband in 3 years... He loved it so much (especially the tzatziki) that he's asked that I make it again 2 days later! 

I even messed up a bit by using too much balsamic vinegar in the marinade and used rice wine instead of rice vinegar in the tzatziki, haha. I also fried the chicken in coconut oil and the dish turned out fantastic! 

Definitely a keeper!

Super easy to make and excellent tasting. My husband (a very picky eater of "new things") and friend raved about it! It tastes just like the local restaurant chicken gyros!

The chicken didn't have the same texture I've had in chicken gyros, so it left me disappointed.

This chicken was wonderful.  We are going to do chicken kabobs with this next time.  You could taste the marinade throughout the chicken & it wasn't overpowering.  I followed a different recipe for the Tzatziki Sauce so I can't rate that but the chicken was wonderful.

My husband and I really thought tbis was great.  It tasted just like our favorite Greek restaurant.  I added everything together at one time for the sauce and it still turned out delicious - not watery at all.  I cooked the chicken on my indoor grill pan and also sauteed the onions and bellpeppers in a little bit of the marinade just to soften them up a bit.  This will definitely become one of our favorite week night meals!
