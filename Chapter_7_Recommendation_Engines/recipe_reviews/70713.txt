My mom is from the Philipines and made this all the time. It's exactly how she made it except no potatoes which you don't really need since it's served over rice. Great recipe!

Very good hash recipe. I suggest cutting up the potatoes into very small cubes though. Mine ended up being too big and so it took quite a bit longer to cook.  Tasted good and the tomatoes added a nice extra flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Updated:  I'm still making this dish after saving it more than two years ago.  Tonight I tried it with a can of New Zealand Corned beef which seemed to be packed oil.  The end result was too liquidy.  I'll stick with the cheap can of corned beef from now (Libby's).  

Inexpensive, satisfying and very easy to make! Good for a quick meal, especially for those who don't have a lot of time to cook during the week. I added soy sauce and red pepper flakes since I like my food a little spicy, and served over steamed rice as suggested. Delicious!

This is great!!! When my mom was away for about a week, the responsibility of cooking fell to me (her 16 year old daughter lol)... I knew everyone in my family loved corned beef so I found your recipe and it was an instant success!!! I cut out the potatoes because I served it with rice. The only problem I had was that the tomatoe juice made the whole thing really runny - but it still tasted delicious!

Very good hash and quick to make.  I did chop the potatoes small so they would cook quickly but the next time I make this I will chop them a little larger and precook a bit before adding.  I also think more sliced onion and garlic would do this dish proud.

This recipe is soooo good. Only thing I changed was instead of vegetable oil I put olive oil. I also found that it was done in much time than the recipe stated. I kept adding water so the potato can cook other. The potato seemed to take longer than the amount of time the recipe stated. Overall it was still excellent. Love it.

Great delicious hash recipe.  We used leftover brisket.  Also added the leftover juice from the brisket which added flavor.

I made this recipe for the two of us, and found that it wasn't quite spicey enough for my husband.  He added some hot pepper seeds to make it a little spicier.  I think maybe a teaspoon of HP sauce or Worcestershire sauce would spice it up. It was a quick and satisfying supper on the whole.

I loved this filipino recipe!  It reminds me of how Mom used to make it when we were kids.  Only thing I changed was to add a little bit of water during the cooking process before adding the corned beef.

Our family loves this version of Corned Beef Hash. We have it at least once a month. The addition of tomatoes makes it fantastic.

This is a simple and wholesome meal... potatoes are the starch so rice is not neccessary or I'd leave the potatoes out of the recipe if one is going to put over rice. Also... I read several people state their potatoes were not cooked through... I always boil my potatoes for about 5 to 10 minutes then I prepare as directed... also I used strained rotel... it adds an awesome flavor! thanks for this recipe!

I used leftover corned beef and cabbage from St. Patrick's Day, and added a little rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sambal olek for flavor.

I grew up with a recipe similar to this.  Instead, I use a can of chopped tomatoes and add one can of drained garbanzo beans.  This is great over rice!

This turned out really good.  We did cook our potatos before adding, after reading other reviews. Went very well with breakfast with over easy eggs and toast.  Yummy

I used tinned corned beef hash (potatoes and onions already in there), as that's all I had.  I made as in recipe, only omitted the potato and it was very tasty.  Just like the stuff my friends used to make!

I only gave this recipe four stars because first of all I don’t like tomatoes in my corned beef hash. I had some grape tomatoes that I was making salsa with and tried the recipe as written only cut in half and used corned beef that I cured and cooked myself. It was good but I truly did not like the tomatoes. Then I made it again still using REAL corned beef and without the tomatoes. It was of course delicious. And yes the over easy egg on top only made it that much better.

I needed a friendly reminded of how my Lola (Grandmother) made it for me as a child. 

One thing to note: I do notice it being better with better corned beef in a can.  I usually go with palm brand vs libbys.   Essentially the corned beef you would get in an asian supermarket vs mainstream USA super market. 

Once with rice, I (personally) added ketchup and soy sauce.

My mom is from the Philippines and makes this all the time. She doesn't use potatoes though, but it's served with white rice so no need for the potato. Quick and easy recipe, I'm eating a bowl right now!

My hubby and I are both Filipino and we love this dish. The only thing I change is the potatoes--I leave them out. Otherwise this is excellent. I serve ours with rice and over medium eggs.

My father brought back from the Panama Canal zone during WWII, a recipe for Bully Beef; Corned beef, onion, garlic, potatoes, in a white grave.  I was looking for a similar recipe and found this one.  I like it.  I made it by the recipe except that I used frozen diced potatoes that I thawed in the nuker.  It made the cooking time way faster.  Oh and my tomato plants have given out, so I used a can of diced tomatoes drained.  It's not the most fragrant dish, but it's good and quick.

I really can't give this recipe more than three stars because the success of the dish is greatly influenced by the quality of the canned corned beef that goes into it.  My wife is from Mindinao in the Philippines, and she is accustomed to brands of corned beef which are readily available in the Philippines and which we can buy at our local Asian market.  Of course, these brands always have added MSG, and that is one of the ingredients that would make the dish seem "authentic" to a Filipino.  Additionally, I have not been happy with a couple of US brands of corned beef due to them having copious amounts of lard, and the resulting dish tends to be too greasy.  Additionally, in the recipe instructions, Ringonian cooks the diced potatoes for 7 to 10 minutes prior to adding the corned beef.  I think this is a mistake.  I always add the potatoes after the corned beef, so that they only cook for about 10 minutes and remain slightly crisp.  We always serve this with rice and eggs over easy.

Way too wet. Like another reviewer said, the flavors didn't go very well together. Used an Australian corned beef and it was just too greasy to eat. Tried putting it over rice, and also like another reviewer said, the 2 starches were redundant and it made the flavor even stranger. Won't try this again.

I thought this was great.  I halved the recipe as there are only 2 of us.  I would definately make this again.

Ahh. Any recipe that begins with olive oil, onion and garlic is bound to great. Delicious! I used half of the suggested garlic and onion and it was great! What I really liked with this recipe is that I could prep as I cooked.  Just kept adding to the pan. It was great to do with leftover corned beef from St Patty's day!

Albeit is not a pretty dish to serve to a bunch of ladies at MOPS...it was pretty tasty :)  I would never make it for a crowd, though cause it does look like typical hash.

I thought it was okay. Husband didn't like it. Sort of dry and it took potatos a long time to cook thru.
