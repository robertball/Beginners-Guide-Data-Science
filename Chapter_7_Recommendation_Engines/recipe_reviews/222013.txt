This is it! This is the recipe I have been looking for. I had wet burritos when I was growing up in West Michigan. Could not find it ever again when I moved from there. Please do not compare with regular burritos that are made in the south. These have their own identity and taste. I made these for my family and got total rave reviews all around the table. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!

Took what I considered to be a chance on this recipe since I had some chopped meat and wanted to try a different recipe form the usual taco meat. Jar gravy ?? I dont even use jar gravy @ Thanksgiving but I tried the recipe as is...and...loved it!   Did NOT like the left overs couple days later but that wont stop me from making again. Thanks W. Michigan

Wet burritos are a favorite here. I ran out of time so didn't bake them, just filled, rolled and then covered with sauce hot from the pan and veggies. Not quite the same but still quite good. I made homemade sauce and used fresh tomatoes rather than canned.

I know I'm going against the pack here but we were really excited to try this recipe and were a bit dissapointed. We thought the sauce was a bit bland and are trying to figure out if it was the jar of gravy that really turned us off. It just wasn't for us.

I, like Jordan, am from Grand Rapids and moved to Atlanta.   When I saw Jordan's last name, I knew I had to try this.  

I made it exactly as designed, hoping to recreate the famous B*ltl*n* B*r wet burrito.  If you've had it you probably know that you can't find this anywhere else but in West Michigan. 

It did not disappoint!  Yes, it's the gravy.  What a surprise.

To be sure, this recipe is not designed to be a Texas burrito, or a California burrito, and we got a kick out of some of the comments that tried to make this something that it wasn't designed for.  This is the West Michigan wet burrito.  It is heavy and delicious!  This is the best attempt I've run across to duplicate it.   Three of us down here in Atlanta, all native West Michigan, gave this 5 stars and two thumbs up.

That being said, we are going to experiment a little going forward.  We don't want to change the flavor, it's excellent and as designed!  We think there might be a little more beef and a little less bean.  This recipe turned out a little less dry than the real thing at B*ltl*n* and so I may try overcooking the beef and leaving the juice out of the diced tomatoes in the beef mixture.  Finally, we are going to try putting the lettuce, tomato, and onion in the burrito, putting all of the cheese outside, and then do a low broil instead of baking.   We will keep all of you West Michiganders posted.

Thanks Jordan!

This got raves from my husband. He even went as far as to say it is better than On The Border's food. While this was good it wasn't the same flavor as OTB. This was mild and more Midwesternized than TexMex. I don't know how this can only yield 4 burritos though as I got 8 and they were stuffed and I still had some filling left. I didn't have refried beans so I took a can of Ranch Style beans non-drained and smashed them up some and went from there. I mixed the bean/comino mix into the meat so all I had to do to build these was a scoop of beef/bean mix and some cheese then roll up and move on to the next one. I only used 2/3 a can of diced tomatoes and did add a pinch of kosher salt to the beef mix. I used medium spice canned enchilada sauce and a jar of brown gravy. I didn't have a lot of just Cheddar so I used a mexican cheese blend mix too. This was a nice mild dish and my husband raved. He is looking forward to taking the leftovers to work for lunch and sharing. We eat a lot of Mexican food and this passed our taste test. This was not my favorite but hubs loved it and had seconds so that makes it a keeper. My biggest complaint? It dirtied a lot of pots! Oh well, the food is good and that is what matters most. Thanks, I really enjoyed trying out this new recipe!

The flavor was amazing, but the steps to make and assemble were trying as I was also trying to calm my 3 month old baby.  I will make again, but when I have someone watching my little one. I put 2 unbaked burritos in the freezer for future meals.

I make alot of traditional mexican food but sometimes you just want sloppy truck stop burritos and this is it.  It goes together fast and it is eaten fast.  Great stuff!

Edit 1-28-17:  This time I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception that I added the beans to the shells before the meat (easier to spread).   As I stated in my initial review, this recipe is perfect as written and needs no improvements, yet it's so versatile.   My family said that this was their favorite burrito yet.   They compared it to a local favorite Mexican restaurant.

Wonderful!   Big hit at our house.   I did deviate in a major way from the recipe, I used left-over turkey instead of ground beef.   I also did add a little chicken broth to make the mixture a little juicier and lacking beef gravy in a jar, I made some from scratch.   The beef gravy/enchilada sauce did not fight with the turkey inside.   Instead it complimented it.   I have ZERO doubt that this recipe would be just as good, and probably better, if I had used ground beef, and I will in the near future.   It was blazing hot today and didn't want to start the oven, so I did this on the grill and that worked wonderfully as well.   This is my go-to recipe from now on.

A popular Mexican restaurant serves a fantastic dish called “Pepe’s Burro”. One main difference is that it has chunks of beef rather than ground beef. The beef gravy flavor from the sauce is much more pronounced in this recipe, and I would tame it down next time these are made. In fact, might eliminate the jar gravy and just go with 2 cans enchilada sauce, beef bouillon flavoring, and a little flour or corn starch if the sauce needs thickening. Otherwise, these burritos are pretty good. A minor detail . . . lightly mist the bottom of baking dish with a cooking spray. Thank you Jordan for sharing this recipe.

Just like West MI! Not authentic Mexican, but who cares?!  I cringed when I saw the jar of gravy in the ingredient list, but it makes the sauce taste just like home (a good thing).  Don't try to make it fancy or authentic, just make it and enjoy!  Better than most restaurants.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family loves Mexican food, but I had never heard of wet burritos before.  Ran across this recipe and decided to try it.  I followed the ingredients list and instructions exactly, did not change one thing.

They are quite huge, so it was more than 4 servings for us.  They were a hit, and I will be adding this recipe to my cookbook.  Thank you!

We made a few changes based on our own preferences. We added a large can of diced chilies, used gr. turkey, didn't layer - why when it just adds to prep time and dirty dishes - and didn't add the cheese until the sauce started to bubble in the center. We were skeptical, but it was GREAT!!!  Thank you!

This is a review of the sauce.  I made the sauce to pour over my bean burritos (Refried Beans Without the Refry ) from this site.  This sauce was fantastic for our bean burritos and I made the recipe as written.

Made the recipe almost exactly the same.  My family loves it!!!  I have 7 people in my family and it is nearly impossible to please everyone but this recipe won everyone over.  It is as close as you can get  to a mid west restaurant style wet Burrito!  The only drawback is the amount of ingredients and the time to make it but don't let that scare you just make it.  Great recipe give it a try.

This was really, really, really good! We live near Grand Rapids, MI, and there are a few restaurants that serve a fantastic beef burrito, and this is very comparable to the best restaurants. LOVE it!!! Thanks for the great recipe! I will make this many more times!

Following the recipe to a "T", the meat is bland. I ended up adding a heavy dose of taco seasoning...at the very least, add salt. I LOVE cumin but it did not go well in the refried beans. The "gravy" was very good on it's own but once it was on the burrito, all of the flavors just fell flat. This won't be a repeat here.

I follow the recipe pretty close as far as ingredients, but since it's just the two of us, I make the burritos individually.  I buy large burritos shells, fill them to our likings, pour the sauce over top, sprinkle with cheese then warm in the microwave. This way we can each choose what we like for fillings & toppings. In my opinion the recipe for the sauce is far far better than the other recipe with over 700 reviews!  I've made these w/ shredded beef, chicken, and ground beef. All great!

I use venison, leave out the onion.  I make a large batch and freeze the leftovers.  They reheat well for Rob's lunch.  We like these a lot!

I've made these three times now and the only thing I've changed is I use pioneer brown gravy mix instead of the jar type,it has a better flavor and it's not as salty. They are always gone with out any leftovers. Can't go wrong with this recipe.

I made this recipe without changes! It was delicious! Next time I will double the sauce because instead of 4 large burritos I made 8. With additional sauce I will have more for serving over the top! I put the bean layer first, as someone mentioned, it was easier to spread that way!

The ingredients were enough for 6 burritos. Make sure to put some sauce in the pan first before placing the burritos in or else they'll stick to the pan and make a mess trying to take them out. The burritos were just as good fresh as what they are for left overs which was a win-win!

This was so good, my kids asked for it again! Went looking for a recipe to use up leftover beef roast gravy. Didn't have tomatoes, so I used salsa. Because salsa has some spice, I only used 1 TSP chili powder and left out the pepper. Couldn't find enchilada sauce, but had a packet of burrito sauce and taco sauce from the old El Paso kits. Tasted great! As another reviewer mentioned, 4 tortillas is too few. I will try 6 next time.

The idea of jar brown gravy was a total turn off for me, so I changed it to a jar of salsa (hot.  family loves spicy).  Major hit with this change.  The other reason I had to make the changes is I don't remember ever buying jar gravy, lol...and I always have salsa in the house.

This is a very authentic, Mexican restaurant tasting recipe!!  My family loves it, and asks for it all the time!!
I add fresh chopped cilantro into the beans when they are simmering on the stove, and I also add it some to the mixture when assembling the burritos.  I also add some fresh dices jalapenos to the burrito mixture, for a little extra heat!  Thanks for this great recipe!!

Ridiculous Good! Tasted better than a restaurant IMO. The ONLY change I made, which isn't really anything, is that I added some chicken stock to the beans to make them "looser" and easier to spread. I also added (with the other stated seasonings)Adobo seasoning to the meat, beans, and sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved it the only thing is that some of them wanted thyme instead of oregano and real pinto beans instead of refried
ones. I did not even get one, I took mind out while I was cooking.

This was a really good recipe.  I did make a few changes to it, one was setting it to 4 servings.  I used turkey instead of ground beef.  I added 1/2 can chopped green peppers to the meat.  I didn't have gravy, so I used dry poultry gravy to make 1.5 c.  Even trying to fill the tortillas, I have enough to make additional so I'm going to freeze the left over meat and sauce.  This really made me think of my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Moving to Family Favorite.

I have to agree with truck stop burrito comment, but not in a good way.  I'm from the Midwest so I can say that while my husband (from Michigan) liked it, it was way too heavy for me... (why I moved to California in the first place, to get away from the heavy food).  I did like that it was really quick, but next time I'll leave the gravy out and just use a mole sauce.  I did though love that the cook actually used real spices.  The flavors were pretty good.

Surprisingly good.  I was kind of skeptical but it turned out well!
