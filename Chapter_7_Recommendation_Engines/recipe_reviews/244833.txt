Except for peeling and cubing the squash, this was an easy dish to throw together.  I was roasting meat, so cooked mine at 325 degrees for about an hour, and it came out perfectly.  Our only complaint was it turned out a little too sweet for our taste.  Next time, I'll cut back on the brown sugar and use a tart apple.  Overall a very good recipe, and could not tell it wasn't "real" butter.

I love butternut squash and I really enjoyed the flavors of this recipe.  I thought it had the perfect amount of spice and wasn't too sweet.  I also thought the addition of the apple and cranberries were the perfect accompaniment.  I did add a touch of salt and pepper.  The cooking method did not work as well for me.   After reading the reviews I decided to cover & cook for 15 minutes and uncover for 15 minutes.  The squash was cooked perfectly, but, would have been way overcooked if I had prepared it according the the recipe instructions.   I think I might even prefer it to be cooked completely uncovered so the squash roasted and caramelized instead of steaming.

The recipe instructs you to cut the squash into 1/2” cubes and to bake at a high temperature  (425ºF) covered for 30 minutes.  At 30 minutes, my butternut squash was overcooked and mushy, so I didn’t bake for an additional 15 mins uncovered.  In the future, I will check at 15-20 minutes, then remove the cover, and bake until tender and a little brown.  The combination of the squash with the apples and cranberries is very flavorful, and this would make a great Holiday side dish to either turkey or ham.

Amazingly Delicious!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this dish but i was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious and I will make it again as a side dish. I doubled the recipe this time by using 2 butternut squashes, 2 apples, 3 tbs of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of I can't believe it's not butter, 1 cup of cranberries, 1/2 cup of walnuts, 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 3/4 teaspoon of nutmug.

Delicious!! Perfect as a Thanksgiving side dish, or along any of your favorite chicken, pork, seafoid, or beef dishes any night!
I used 2 packages of pre-peeled and cubed squash, and fresh cranberries rather than dried; otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I found that the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spread was very easy to work with. 
The dish was quick to put together, it baked up perfectly, and my group of friends really enjoyed it!

This is sooooo good!  I followed the recipe with the exceptions of adding 1/4 cup of walnuts. (would have preferred pecans but used what was on hand) and I had dried cherries, not cranberries.  I only baked for 15 minutes and it was perfect. Threw on some dried parsley for fun, too.  Really nice dish and I will be making this often!

I meant to pick up a spaghetti squash and picked up a butternut by mistake and wanted to do something other than the usual soup I make with butternut squash.  What a winner this one is!!  

When working with squash it's easiest to pierce it a few times then nuke it for a few minutes, just long enough to be able to get a knife through it.  Once it cools down it's easy enough to then scoop out the insides and peel it but that part of the prep takes the longest amount of time (and it's something you could even do a day in advance).  And it's a lot cheaper than buying the ones already cut and peeled at the store.

I'm not a big fan of nutmeg so I didn't use that, and I use real butter instead of imitations, and this was EXCEPTIONAL.  The only thing I'll do different in the future is I'll do the squash prep earlier .

I don't love peeling butternut squash, but is a absolute must with this recipe. Maybe my cubes were big but I did cook the dish for closer to 25 mins and it wasn't mushy. I didn't peel the apples but I don't think you need to. Good flavor and texture and lovely fall or holiday meal. Looking forward to trying with fresh cranberry!

A bit too sweet and too much fat. Next time I'll cut the sugar and fat in half and I think it'll be a winner!

I had some left over home made cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving Holidays  so I just made as recipe called but added the cranberry sauce and some pecans.  I did not add any extra sugar as this had been added when i made the cranberry sauce.  This was very good and would make again.

This will make a addition to the holiday table.  Just a few adjustments, to meet our tastes / needs.  I used fresh cranberries instead of dried, and tossed them with a tablespoon of sugar. 
I baked at 350 for 30 minutes, covered,  because my oven was already set to 350 for other dishes.   The squash was perfectly done.  I took the dish out, let it rest and finished at 425 for about 10 minutes just before serving.  
Note - I think (although I have not tried it) this would could be made in advance and refrigerated, then brought to room temperature and finished in a hot oven.

I had a butternut squash in my kitchen for over 2 weeks and dreaded peeling & then cubing it. The peeling was a breeze- it wasn't tough as I'd presumed. Hubby cut it into cubes for me which helped! I made it exactly as the recipe was written except I added 1 Tbsp more butter (I used butter!) as my squash was  more than 1-3/4lb. Everyone loved it and I am making it again this Thanksgiving. This time I will add pecans just to give it a bit of a twist!

Cubing the squash was the hardest part but when it was done it was perfect. The taste was spot on. I would recommend this recipe for anyone.

Tastes really good! I get frozen pre-cut squash so all I need to do is cut an apple and add the ingredients so it is super easy as well.

I really enjoyed this dish.  The only thing I didn't really like (and maybe it was my misunderstanding) is that next time I will peel the apples.  The skin was rough to eat when the apples and squash were very soft.  Otherwise very good!

I used real butter and 2 honeycrisp apples. I cooked it for 20 minutes covered and 5 minutes uncovered. Squash was definitely done. Turned out tasting great.

I left out the apples and cranberries due to some dietary restrictions and a picky eater.  I used a bag of frozen, precut butternut squash.  I was stunned how this turned out.  The ingredients somewhat remind me of a candied sweet potato recipe I've been making for years, but with butternut squash?  Now, I'm not normally a butternut squash eater.  Boy, was I surprised that I would have never even known I was eating squash if I hadn't made it.  I'm positive the apples would totally make this dish more like a dessert than a side dish.  Give it a try!

I made it with a bit less sugar than the recipe called for but otherwise just as described, and it was great.  I saw the reviews that said to reduce the cooking time, and I did try that at first, but when I checked on it, the squash wasn't done, so I went back to following the original recipe, and it came out cooked perfectly. yum.

I followed the recipe pretty closely.   Butternut squash was perfect, the apple seemed a little overcooked,and the cranberries added a great ‘twang’.   My husband really liked it.
I will make this again

This is a excellent recipe.  Made it as a side dish instead of potatoes.  Has just enough flavor.  Great as a leftover as well.
Will make it again.  Great side dish for Thanksgiving.

I used butter, but just 2 tbsp.and only 1 tbsp. of brown sugar. The butternut squash was tough to cut and peel so I cut it in quarters and baked that at 350 for 30 minutes, then I peeled and cut it.  I added the rest of the ingredients and baked for another 30 minutes.

My family loved it!  The only changes I made were to mix the ingredients with olive oil and lowered the temp to 350 for 15 minutes more after removing the lid.  I'm in the process of making this awesome dish right now.

I love this and regret asking someone else to bring squash for Thanksgiving, as I would prefer to have this.  Out of habit, I roasted the squash ahead of time before reading the recipe (sliced in 1/2 baked at 400 for 50 min).  Therefore I mashed the squashed versus cubed/roasted and we loved it!  The flavor is so rich and delish!

I did make chnges.  Used butter, increased the cinnamon as squash was a bit bigger than recipe recommended, did not have craisins.  Added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  We liked it and I will make it again.

We  absolutely love this dish.   I have made it twice for company dinners and everyone has loved it.  I used real butter (2 Tbsp.)   I didn’t use the apples but instead I threw in a handful of walnuts with the cranberries.  It is a bit of a hassle to prepar the squash but I have learned that I can buy it already peeled and cubed in a bag at the grocery store.  This will make it a regular in my menu rotation.

This dish was enjoyable to eat. it made the house smell good while it cooked. The prep was simple except for cutting off the skin of the butternut squash. I did not use onions. I added honey and a splash of wine. I ate it for breakfast and dinner.

We found this very bland.  I followed the recipe except for adding an additional Granny Smith Apple.  After it was done baking, I added maple syrup in an attempt to make it more interesting which improved the taste, however no one was impressed.  I won't be making this again.

Great dish but I made a few changes.  I used real butter and real cranberries as they add a more authentic taste.  As the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, I used a 1/2 cup fresh ones.  Next time I make it I will use a full cup.  As with other reviewers, I also added salt and pepper as it does need it and heating the dish at 425 is way too high.  All ovens are different so I covered the dish for 20 minutes at 325 and uncovered for 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  I peeled & cubed one honey crisp apple but next time I will add two.  Lastly, I grated the rind of a large naval orange and added that on top.  It was perfect!

Loved this as a side dish.  I didn't have any nutmeg so used 1 teaspoon of allspice in place of nutmeg and cinnamon and tasted great.  Will definitely be making often!

I couldn't believe it wasn't butter!  This is a simple and delicious dish with all the flavors of fall.  It makes a good side dish for the Thanksgiving dinner table.  You should definitely make it.  DOOOOOOOO IT!!  You won't be disappointed (probably).

Oh so good! I took the suggestion of other reviewers and microwaved the whole squash for about 5 min before peeling/cutting. I also baked at 325 for 45 min (covered) and then 350 for 15 min, uncovered. I didn't have crisis so I used raisins. Awesome dish!

I wanted to make this for Thanksgiving; however, i had too many things to go in the oven. I decided to put it in the slow cooker. I cooked it on High for 3 hours. It was wonderful but needed a few changes. I would cook only 2.5 hours and use a much firmer apple. They kind of disintegrated.

I substituded real butter and honey. I also added a mixture of chopped pecans and walnuts. I didn't have nutmeg, so I used pumpkin pie spice. I baked for 15 min covered and 25 minutes uncovered in 425 before  squash was tender. I'm planning serving this for thanksgiving dinner. So good!

I baked according to recipe and for me it was perfect, but I like my squash softer. I think I should have stirred it when taking off the foil just to help evenly cook.  Thanks so much!

Really good! Great fall dish with lots of flavor. I used green apples, added chopped white onions and chopped bacon (of course everything is better with bacon!).

I was really looking forward to this dish, and it left me very disappointed......  The squash cubes on top never really cooked, they just dried out from their time baking without being covered.  At the bottom of the casserole dish, there was just enough moisture that the squash cubes there did cook, but they didn't taste very good..... none of the sugar and cinnamon seemed to have come through in the baking, despite the fact that I layered it in the dish.  The apples and craisins baked well, but everything else went straight into the trash.  It was just that awful!

I roasted the squash before hand, and next time I would not cook it quite as long. Husband thought it was delicious and went back for seconds and asked if we could have the leftovers the next night!

Microwaving the butternut squash for 2 1/2-3 minutes made peeling it a lot easier. Followed the recipe exactly. We both loved it. The next day it was even better after the flavors had married together.

I made this and it tasted really good.  I did read many of the reviews and took their advice on less sugar, cook uncover and season with a bit of salt and pepper.

We absolutely loved this squash dish just the way the recipe was written. The flavors compliment each other and it was a perfect side for a Pork Tenderloin dish. I will definitely use this recipe many times.

I used coconut oil instead of butter, added one cup of pecans and doubled the cinnamon. That  was a side dish at dinner. My son suggested it as a fruit crisp, so after dinner we had this topped with 'oatmeal crisp' (oats, flour, brown sugar and butter). I added the topping and baked until top was crisp, about 25 min. I'm a picky eater, don't like flavors and textures mixed, I am not big on squash and don't like coconut or cranberries and I ate a whole piece!

I used fresh cranberries, which added tart bursts and less sugar.  I also added chopped walnuts and topped it with rolled oats and more cinnamon, which filled out the recipe to make it a great breakfast!

Needed some new recipes for using up the abundant harvest of butternut squash currently filling my freezer.  This will become a favorite!  Baked it for 30 mins only, the apple was still a bit crunchy but that only enhanced the texture.

Simple to make and delicious. Could easily cut the amount of sugar and fat to half the amount recommended without sacrificing flavor. Could also reduce the amount of cranberries to reduce the sweetness. Still a great dish for the holidays.

It was good, but very sweet for my taste and I only used half the sugar.  I think you could make it with no sugar and would still be sweet enough from the apples and squash alone.  Possibly add some potatoes to mellow it out and would make more servings to take for a holiday get together.

Did not make changes.  Will definitely make again.  Nice complement to our cod dinner.  Our guests loved it!  Down side was peeling the squash (even after microwaving), but the final result was worth it.  Might be good with some walnuts tossed in, but loved the original recipe.

Yummy but I  agree with others who said it was too sweet. Next time I'll halve the sugar. Leftovers will be great cold with some vanilla yogurt. Will also use pre cut squash.

Eating it right now and going for seconds. 
Based on reviews I shortened covered cooking time to 15 minutes and uncovered for 10. This wasn't enough by far so I added 10 more uncovered. Still not done so put cover back on and did another 5-10.  I've overcooked squash in the past so I was aware of this and glad to see those reviews. Not sure why mine needed longer. I used precut 32oz of butternut squash, added some pecans and only 3 tbsps of butter. 
Long or short this made for a satisfying breakfast on a -15 degree morning. Will make again as this squash is part of my breakfast rotation. Makes up for dismal school lunches ;)

Great recipe.  I actually over cooked it with the instructions provided so the squash was mushy but the flavor was still delicious.  I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Even the picky children tried it.  A keeper.

I must have gotten a huge butternut squash, because I only used half of it and the proportions looked right.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The cook time seemed to work well for me, too. I gave my husband a small bowl to sample and he was drooling for more. Good both warm and cold. I think I will double the other ingredients next time and use the whole squash, now that I now it will be devoured!

I used fresh cranberries and real butter and added about 1/2 cup of walnuts and carrots.  Very good.  I will be using the leftovers minus the carrots in my yogurt.

I really, really liked this! I didn't have nutmeg so I added some additional cinnamon. I also added salt and pepper. This needs the salt and pepper addition in my opinion. I love the salty sweet combination that gives it. I cooked mine a little longer too since I wasn't done cooking my other dinner components yet. I would probably do that again because it turned out perfect!

I made exactly like the recipe specified except I added sliced almonds.  It was great!  My family asked me to be sure and make again!  My husband said it tasted healthier with the I can't Believe it's not Butter.
