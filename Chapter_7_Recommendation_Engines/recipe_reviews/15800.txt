Easy and soooo good.  I always get rave reviews when I make this dish.  Don't slice the apples too thin though or they end up too mushy.

super delicious. This tastes mighty fine.  And so easy to make too.  (ps substitute some brown sugar for the white and it will taste even better.) Still the best recipie around!

I have fixed this recipe a couple of times and everyone loves it.  The only thing different I used 1/4 C.less sugar and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.Also added 15 min. baking time.

EXCELLENT!!! i used a Cuisinart to slice those apples simply, uniform, and thin... it also whips up the crumbly topping nicely.  
I used 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/4 white. I added 1/2 t vanilla to the oj before pouring it over apples  SO EASY, SO GOOD!!!  I'll make it again...

This recipe was a last minute find and what a find!  I made it for my church choir's annual "Welcome Back From Summer Break" picnic and it received many, many compliments.  To those of you who advised doing the sugar as 1/2 white and 1/2 brown, thanks!  The advise was well taken.  Like many here, I also doubled the recipe and added a cup of raisins to the apple mixture (I like raisins!).  The addition made for a very flavorful touch.  Thanks for the recipe, Barbara!  It is definetly going into the Recipe Box!  -MEB

AMAZING! I peeled the apples first, doubled the recipe to make two, and used half white and half brown sugar. My husband could not get enough, it was great and really easy.

I wanted to try a recipe for an antique "brown betty" baking dish I got for a gift. This is quite good. I made it twice. Both times using half brown sugar. The second time I added 1/8 tsp. clove as I like the spice. A hit both times. I like serving it with half and half. It adds the dairy element without the extra sugar. Thanks for this!

I'm not giving this recipe a terrible rating because I'm sure I must've done something wrong to get the results I did.  Okay flavor, really BAD presentation.  I tried to about double everything - put the apples in the orange juice as I was slicing them so they wouldn't brown.  Either I used too much orange juice (I only used a little over 1/3 cup) or having the apples in it caused them to release water while cooking because when I pulled this out of the oven it was SWIMMING in buttery water.  I kid you not - rocking the pan from side to side make it look like the apples were floating on top of water.  The topping had all melted and pretty much disintegrated in the water and it was just . . . ugly.  And REALLY REALLY sweet.  I even drained the watery part and just gave husband the apples and ice cream and he only ate about three bites.

I'll probably try a different recipe next time since I couldn't make this one work.  Sorry. :(

The topping couldn't have turned out better. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I used cold butter -- no need to wait for it to soften. For the person who had soupy pie, maybe the wrong type of apples were used? I used Granny Smith, and they maintained their firmness. Another person commented not to slice the apples to thin, so I left mine a bit thick and cooked an extra 15 minutes as suggested, and they turned out a bit too mushy for my taste. Next time I will only cook for 45 minutes and leave the slices as is (I used an apple corer, which produced 6 slices, then I sliced those in half.) A little too much nutmeg. I would decrease to 1/4 teaspoon next time because it overpowered the cinnamon. Reheat from room temperature at 200 degrees for a 10 minutes and serve with vanilla bean ice cream!

YUM!  I love this recipe, it was so easy!  I made a couple changes.  I did as people suggested and did half brown sugar half white sugar.  I also put half of the cinnamon in with the sugar mixture and then the other half I added to the diced apples and tossed them around to mix it in to give the apples a bit more seasoning.  Thanks for the recipe--it was a hit at my house!

This was absolutely wonderful!!  The topping looked a little dry so I drizzled some butter on top before baking it.  Thank you so much for this recipe, my whole family loved it.

This was a very easy, quick recipe.  If you want something that tastes similar to apple pie but don't want all the work, this is your recipe.  Topped with some vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup for a tasty treat!

So simple a college student can make this - and it comes out great.  I use the precut apples from trader joes and pumpkin pie spice to speed up the prep time.

This was very easy and tasty. I didn't even peel the apples, was feeling lazy. (But I think I will next time, the skins in the dish are kind of unexpected texture that one doesn't think of in an apple dish.) I did do half brown sugar and half white sugar just because brown sugar just seems to go naturally with apples. And this seemed to make some of the topping crispy (the white sugar) and some of it gooey (the brown sugar). The time and temp were just perfect for me, and it had that very nice dual texture for the topping. The cinnamon and nutmeg were very subtle I might increase that a little for my taste. I will make this again and again.

This was delicious and so much easier than a standard apple pie!  (Less calories, too!  : )  I think the watery and mushy apple problems are the fault of the kinds of apples used, not the recipe.  Make sure you use a baking apple- we used half Granny Smiths and half golden delicious.  Wonderful!  Red delicious won't bake well, so don't use them!  Google search to find out what are good baking apples, if you don't already know, but don't blame it on the recipe!

I did as what everyone suggested with the brown sugar and it turned out fantastic. I left it in the oven for a bit too long and everything got crispy, but we still loved it. Will definitely try to make it again.

This recipe is exactly the same as my mom's tried and true - and it was fabulous!  Moreover, it had exactly the crunchy caramelized topping that my husband was hoping for.  One change - I added about 1 more cup of apples - so 5 cups instead of 4.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe - highly recommend!

This is not a recipe for you if you are hoping for apples with the consistency of apple pie.  Like a few others, I would say that my apples were too mushy for my preference.  I think the orange juice tends to boil the apples rather than bake them.  If I were to make this again, I would avoid adding the orange juice or add a little flour to the apple mixture.  While I did not like the texture as an apple dessert, I did blend the final product and called it, "baked applesauce. As a unique and creative baked applesauce, it was good.

I've made this more times than I can count.  I love it more everytime.  I've made a couple changes though.  First I cube a couple slices of bread usually the heal no one eats.  I spead them in between the apples and the topping.  Last I drizzle honey lightly ontop. One of hubby's favorites!!!

Delicious! I followed the advice everyone gave about using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the 1 cup white sugar, and then also changed the 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to 1/4 tsp fine orange grind. Yumm! Everyone loved it :)

Another reviewer was right...presentation is lacking for this recipe.  The topping disappears into the apples and actually gets soggy if you don't serve it while warm from the oven.  It tastes good with vanilla ice cream but is too "gooey" for my tastes if it sits at all.  Sorry, but I've made this twice...so I think I've given it a good try.

apples came out nice, however the flour/sugar mixture became hard and clumpy.  I did do the 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white so that may have been the problem.  Also, making it uncovered may have helped.

This is a very good base for Apple Betty, and with some minor adjustments it is a winner. First thing is I cook the apples (granny smith) on med high heat with a little orange juice, 2tblspoons of water, cinnamon, organic evaporated cane sugar (1/8 cup) and vanilla extract (1/2 tsp) for about 10 minutes (less time if you like your apples firm). Then I add the apples into the baking dish and spread the flour mix crumble over the top if it. I melt about 1/4 cup of butter and pour over the top and then bake...when there is about 10-12 minutes left I add crushed pecans over the top then finish baking. Talk about delicious....

After making this for dessert for a double date, my good friend called me a week later asking for the recipe because her boyfriend had a dream about "that apple stuff." LOL Definitely use some brown sugar to caramelize the streusel topping.

Simple, Easy and Yummy!  My fiance ate half of it in one sitting, and was devestated when he came home and found the dog had knocked it off the counter and ate the rest.  I served it with vanilla bean ice cream with a little carmel sauce.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use brown sugar instead of white.

So very good! I used 1/2 Splenda & 1/2 Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.  I also used 1/2 white flour & 1/2 wheat flour.  My husband was crazy about it & it has moved to the top of our favorite dessert list. Served with vanilla ice cream = YUM BEYOND BELIEF!

Easy as pie! (pun) It's actually simpler and better than pie.  Variation: 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Bake for 60 minutes vs 45 minutes.   This is my new favorite dessert.

Fantastic! I left the skin on,used the food processer to blend the topping and then the slicer attachment to slice the apples. I added dried cranberries to the oj. Also used 1/2 the butter and cut the sugar in 1/2 too and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  The reviews that say it is not a nice presentation.....I disagree, mine came out like a perfect crumb topping~beautiful!

A wonderful recipe! Everyone loved it. I used 1/2c. brown and 1/2c. white sugar... then used about 5 cups of sliced Cortland apples, since I had so many of them. I threw in a pinch of cloves along with the other spices and baked for 45 min. at 375F, just as the recipe states. It came out perfect, brown and beautiful :) Thanks so much, Barbara!

Wow, this was so delicious! I used fuji apples and put them in a large ceramic pie pan that I sprayed well with PAM to avoid sticking. I followed the recipe exactly except I used whipped butter instead of stick butter to lower the sat. fat a little, but still used the 1/2 cup amount. The recipe said to cut the apples thin and I sliced them about 1/4 inch and they were perfectly cooked. I loved the added orange juice idea. Will make this again. Thank you submitter!

This recipe is amazing and so easy. I sprinkled a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg over the apples and added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar (the first time I made it, it was too sweet) and it was absolutely perfect.  This is a great way to impress guests with things that most people have around all the time!

~excellent!~ easy, fast (both very important in my life). I added fresh raspberries and used lemon juice (didn't have the orange juice) and only sprinkled the lemon throughout the apples. So tangy w/ that super sweetness from the crumble. I added cardamon as well to the dry mix (I adore it). This is excellent on a cool autumn day or anytime! Thank you so much for this recipe. I'll be using it for a long, long time to come.

Absolutely incredible! My family and I loved this delicious dessert. I followed other reviewers and used brown sugar for half of the white, plus I added a dash each of cloves and allspice. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Can I give it 10 stars? Please!?!  Wonderful!!! 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, about 7 small granny smith apples, added 1 tsp vanilla to orange juice.  Turned out wonderful.  The crumb topping was nice and crisp and the apples were in a nice thick goo. Will make again and again!

I've tried various apple betty and apple pie recipes over the years, and this is my favorite apple dessert dish. Everyone always loves this when I prepare it in the fall and winter. Some changes I make:

I substitute half brown sugar, and I use a few pinches of cloves along with the spices. Wonderful!

I made this with my two daughters and it is/was sooooooooo good.  We took the advice of others and sprinkled a little cinnamon and nutmeg over the apples after we drizzled them with the maple syrup.  We also had to add a little more flour (about 1/8 cup) to get the topping to a crumbly consistency. It took us all of ten minutes to throw the whole thing together including peeling and slicing apples. Thanks so much for the recipe. I would give it more stars if I could.

This really is as simple and wonderful as it claims to be. Since it was a bit sweet the first time around I cut the sugat to 3/4 cup (which helped alot since I like to add all of the topping). I also added the orange juice little by little as I put the apples into the tin, this kept them fresh looking and was nicer when presented. EVERYONE loves this and always wants me to bring it to an event. Great recipe!!

Very easy to make-hardest part is peeling the apples! I cut back on the sugar and only use 3/4 cup. Can any of us just leave the recipes alone????
I had cinnamon ice cream which really tasted great.

My husband loved this, but my daughter and I thought it was too sweet.  Next time I make it, I would cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup and put in 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead.  I also found that it needed to bake for longer than the 45 minutes called for by the recipe.  I had it go an hour, then broiled it for a couple of minutes to get it a little browner.  Definitely more appealing that way.  Otherwise, not too bad and very easy to make.

A great recipe for non-bakers! Came out fabulous, everybody loved it when I served it at Thanksgiving. However, I halved the sugar called for, and it was plenty sweet enough.

This was very easy to make.  I have never cooked with apples before and I did not peel them, would definitely peel them first next time.  Will make again.

Very delicious and so very easy. Been looking for a good, simple Apple Brown Betty recipe (as I remember it called as a child)for many years. This is it. Maybe next time I will add less sugar too. I only wish it was a little browner on top when it comes out of the oven. Maybe more butter might do the trick next time.

Very easy recipe to make. Even for beginner bakers! I would use a bit more "crumble" mixture on the top, for personal taste, but otherwise this was excellent.  Just a hint of cloves can intensify the taste as well.

Awesome! I love apple pie, but don't always want the hassle-- this is so much easier. Great a la mode, in fact ice cream is a must. Have made it twice now, and probably won't make any crusted apple pies again anytime soon-- the fruit is the best part anyway! I used granny smith apples, made all the streusel called for, and baked for about 50 minutes to get browned and bubbly on top. I also used allspice instead of nutmeg, because I was out-- would recommend using whatever spice you prefer in your apple pie. Bravo!

After watching that episode of King of the Hill where the family is at the state fair and Louanne is running around with an "Apple Brown Betty" I always thought that it was a type of cake.  It didn't really look like a pie on she show but hey, what do I know about apple betty's anyways.  This is a very tasty desert.  I'm not sure I liked the orange juice, next time I will probably use lemon juice instead or just less OJ. It looked very nice in the pan, but when I sliced it up it just fell apart and was very runny.  You definately want to wait at least an hour after taking it out of the oven to slice it up. The thing that I loved about this recipe was the easiness of it.  I whipped it up when dinner was cooking, then 15 minutes after we were finished eating dinner the pie was done.  Perfect timing.  Overall pretty good recipe.  Oh and thanks for the tip to use half white sugar and half brown! It added a very nice flavor.

Wow...  the whole family loved this... and my daughter helped to make it.  Even my hubby, who is definitely not an APPLE fan, loved it!  Thanks for a great, quick and easy dessert!  The only thing we changed was to make it in a 8X8" square pan instead of a pie pan... it worked just fine!

Winner! Went with 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar as suggested. Also added 1/8 tsp ground cloves and threw in some cranberries. Used about 10 small red apples. Placed them in a bowl of orange juice while cutting and then drained (drank actually) the juice before baking since the apples were on the mushy side.

Very easy recipe and quite healthy too!  Could use a little more spicing and maybe a dash of liquor, but it went awesomely with a dollop of vanilla ice cream!

So easy - smells great! This is really a winner. My only change is I used Simply Apple juice instead of orange juice. :-( Thanks for sharing.

What a great easy alternative to making a full pie! Would probably use less sugar next time as we found it a bit too sweet. Thanks for the other recommendations for using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar...I will try 1/2 cup white and 1/3 cup brown next time. Maybe a bit more cinnamon as well. Two thumbs up!!!

I had some Fugi apples that had sat around too long and were getting soft.  I knew I had to do something with them soon, so I grabbed this recipe off the internet.

I used both brown sugar and white sugar...1/2 cup each.  I also added 1 cup of dry oatmeal to the dry mix to make it more like an an Apple Crisp.

It turned out delicious! The oatmeal gave it a more crispy texture, which my family prefers.  

I also cooked for only 35 minutes, because the apples were already soft, and didn't want to end up with mushy apples.

PERFECT!  I will make this again and again.  Thank you

This was just okay for me. I'm not sure if I would make it again. I thought there was too much sugar and way too much butter. The apples shouldn't be too thinly sliced or they get mushy, and this needs to be eaten right away. Leftovers did not taste good at all.

Very good.  MY only complaint was that it said thinly sliced apples, and my thinly sliced apples did not hold up, so I'll do a thicker slice next time.  The topping had great flavor!

Very good but a bit too sweet - perfect with vanilla ice cream on top. I used half/half brown and white sugar (might cut down the white next time to a  1/4 cup) and added 1/4 cup quick oats for texture. I also baked in a square 8x8 stoneware pan and the consistency was perfect - it lifted right out of the pan without falling apart. Will definitely be making this again.

This dish turned out so yummy! I substituted half of the sugar for dark brown sugar and increased the baking time by 10 minutes. I also used an 8x8 square baking dish instead of the pie plate. Thanks for the recipe and all the helpful tips!

Delish!  I didn't have any brown sugar and I was so glad to find this recipe that didn't call for any...and it was sooooo good!  I halved the recipe and baked in in a banana bread pan and it was great...there was too much topping for it though.  SO GOOD!  Will make again.

Absolutely the best Apple Betty I've ever had! I don't know how anyone's could have come out runny. Certainly wasn't from following this recipe. My Apple Betty came out thick, rich and DELISH! And I was not so careful to measure exactly either. Used more fresh OJ, less white sugar, more brown sugar, more cinnamon, lighter flour and it still came out perfect. And yes, my husband and I also finished it all in one night. Something we never do! This recipe is a keeper.

I took this to a potluck and it was a huge hit. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. I should have doubled it - there wasn't any left to take home! I did make two changes based on the reviews: I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla over the apples and did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar for the topping. Excellent and easy dish, and will definitely make it again.

This was REALLY good!  Just like apple pie without the crust. Served warm with ice cream, it's awesome (and makes the house smell great too!) The only problem I had was that there was a watery liquid throughout the apples that was kind of weird.  I'm thinking it was from the orange juice so next time I will leave that out.  Also, I used 3.5 apples (4 cups worth) and next time I'll use more.  I baked mine for 45 minutes and that was too long as the apples were a bit mushy.  Overall, we really liked these and will definitely make again!!

This dessert was soooo good, I made it twice in two days.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The second time, I made a healthier version by 1. cutting down the butter by 2 tbs, 2. using half whole wheat, half white flour, and 3. leaving the skin on half the apples.  It was just as delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

A Quick and Easy recipe. The orange juice made the apples a little to mushy, so I will omit it the next time. I would like to play around with some spices to sprinkle directly on the apples for more flavor [APPLE PIE SPICE]. The crumbled topping was very delicious and held the pie together very nicely after it cooled for about 1 hr. I love the idea of the pie plate, looks so much nicer setting on the table than a 9x13 baking dish. Gives your table a nice warm, comforting feeling while you eat. Presentation say's alot along with the wonderful smell. ENJOY.

This is a family favorite. I can make it very quickly using the apple peeler/corer/slicer that I have. My whole family thinks it's an extra special treat. And it's sooooo easy to make, and makes the house smell delicious. I generally use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, but last time I made it with just white sugar and it was still fantastic. I never measure the cinnamon or nutmeg, I just sprinkle it in until it seems right. But this is WONDERFUL!!! I haven't met anyone who doesn't like it! Great a-la-mode, too!

Fast and super *easy* to make!!!!  Also really delicious.  I used a loaf pan and cut up more apples than the recipe calls for, and used slightly less sugar and it was still delicious. Guests loved it too. I will definitely make this again!!

YUMMY! I changed it a little bit because I don't like too many apples. I sliced up 3 large granny smiths and kept the rest of the recipe the same so I had lots of crumbly topping. Also I sprinkled some cinnamon on the apples before putting the topping over them. I served it warm out of the oven with some low fat whipped cream on top. My boyfriend and I finished it off in about 5 minutes.

This is a wonderful recipe! I doubled the recipe and placed the apples in a cake pan and then added the topping! It was simple delicious.  Even my brother who hates desserts had two helpings! Thanks for such a great recipe!  My kids loved helping me make it! My son even asked if we could make "Betty" again because she was so good!  Thanks!

I have been using this same recipe for over60 years. Sometimes I make larger amounts sometimes just the smaller 8"-9" size. I always peel the apples and instead of measuring the apples I just fill the baking dish or pan nice and full and sprinkle with some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.. No more than 1/4 cup Orange juice.No need to soak the apples first in orange juice. They are supposed to turn brownish when they absorb the juices. I usually double the topping and just pack it on. You can refrigerate or freeze any unbaked topping for later use. I cook at the same temperature and when I see the juices bubbling up in spots through the topping I know it is done but test with a paring knife to be sure. Sometimes takes longer than 45 minutes. Oh and be sure to put a tray underneath in case it bubbles over a little too much. I got the recipe from my Mom in 1950's and use it often especially in fall and winter.

I used golden delicious and Granny Smith apples but the thin-slicing made them a little soggy.  Or maybe it was because I doubled the recipe and the orange juice didn't need to be doubled?  Simple and good but, this round, not sensational.

Excellent recipe.  I have been making this same Apply Betty recipe for years.  Got it out of an old Betty Crocker Cookbook.  It is a no-fail recipe.  I use tart apples because of the amount of sugar and butter in this recipe.  Pippin or Granny Smith apples are best.  I usually don't have orange juice in my fridge so I often just use 2 Tablespoons of a sweet lemon like a Myers lemon instead.  It adds the right amount of sour to the tartness of the apples and sweetness of the topping.  I cut the apples about 1/4 inch thick.  Yummy! Great with vanilla ice cream.

This was okay. If you're looking for a very simple apple crumble recipe, this is one but it isn't anything outstanding in my opinion. There are better ones.

Wow! This is a great alternative to a pie and ridiculously easy to make. I was worried about how it would taste since its so simple, but it was great. I made it the day before and reheated it in the oven for a Thanksgiving desert. I used granny smith apples. As others have noted, I thought the crumble was a tad sweet and will use less sugar the next time I make it, but won't change a thing otherwise.

Its a good alternative, but I found that topping a bit too sweet.  I used a combo of apple types and will try only green next time to see if I get a better consistency.

This was good, but......I do like apple crisp better as it has a "crustier" top.
I made both this and the crisp for a gathering and the apple crisp seemed to get the more raves.  As others have said this is a fast, easy recipe if you don't want to fuss with pies.

Very easy recipe to use up apples before they go bad! Just make sure to use baking apples, otherwise it will get mushy. I used half brown sugar because my husband LOVES his brown sugar, and added in a few rolled oats for a crunchier texture. The recipe was very tasty and much easier than an apple pie!

I also changed the sugar content to 1/2 c granulated and 1/2 c brown sugar and baked it 55 minutes. It was delicious. Would like to add something crunchy (nuts, toffee) - am not sure what.

I made this for a family get together and everyone raved about it. I served it with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream, and the creaminess of the ice cream with the sweet, crumbly topping was out of this world. It was easy as pie to make, too. Thank you so much!

It doesn't get better, or easier, than this!  The perfect ending to a Fall feast!  This is so quick to prep and can bake while you dine so as to be served warm.  My husband just loves apple desserts and this was so effortless, yet would hold its own against a truly "classy" dessert.  Comforting and festive.  All ingredients are kitchen staples, so it can be thrown together on a whim, which is what I did!

Last night other half comments that an Apple Betty sounded good.  I took that as a challenge, and made the first one of my life using this recipe. It came out great.  The aroma was wonderful. My apples were some Red Delicious, so not the best cooking apple, but what I had on hand.  I baked for 50 minutes with the top of the pie plate at the center of the oven.  The apples were done perfectly and the crumb crust was perfectly browned.  The only thing I would possibly change is the amount of topping.  It seemed to be a little too much for the amount of apple.  I think 3/4 of the amount would be more to my taste.  The texture was great, and the flavor was very true to an old fashioned Betty. DP

A very easy and tasty recipe. It hardly takes any time or effort to put together and the end result is extremely tasty. I was out of orange juice, so substituted with a little lime juice. Didn't make a difference. I also used half brown sugar and half white.

YUM!!  This is absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with only one change: using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, as suggested by other reviewers.  That was a good call.  The brown sugar gives the dish wonderful flavor.  I used Red Delicious apples, only because I happened to have them laying around.  They worked fine- definitely a little sweeter than the dish would have been with green apples, but not overpoweringly so.  The Apple Betty smells amazing while baking and tastes even better once it's finished.  My husband and I polished off the whole thing between the two of us, I'm a little embarassed to say.  I might not make this again soon just to spare our waistlines, but that would be the only reason.  Great recipe!

Excellent! I made this for Thanksgiving, as a last minute dish, and there wasn't a single bit left. I was surprised that the recipe called for orange juice, but you can't even tell.  I also mixed half brown sugar and half white sugar. It was DIVINE!

I don't know why people are complaining about the way this thing looks! You're just serving it up and putting whipped cream or ice cream with it! I used Braeburn apples, which were WONDERFUL! I have a NON-Pumpkin eater in my home, so she LOVED this! It was delicious, I must admit! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious.  Made it last night.  My husband and I had to get seconds!  I didn't have nutmeg, so used "allspice" instead.  I didn't have orange juice either, so used some juicy juice berry.  The top crust was absolutely addictive!  Easy and delicious recipe.

This was sooooooo good and soooo easy! I usually shy away from any recipe calling for O.J. because I'm not a fan of orange-flavored desserts, but it is not noticeable at all. I didn't have any nutmeg, but it still tasted fabulous.

Easy to make! I sliced the apples, added the OJ.. then mixed flour ingredients.. the butter had been sitting out while I cut apples, so it was soft when I was ready to use it, making it easier. I also forgot to grease the pan.. but it wasn't an issue. You want an extra-ordinary desert, but don't have alot of time. This is perfect. Serve with vanilla ice-cream or cool whip!

I have been making this recipe for at least for probably 2-3 years and it is always popular. I have many been asked for the recipe several times. I think the orange mixed with the apples makes a big difference. I try use the juice right from the orange when I have oranges around. I serve just out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream. Yum!

This is amazing...  The best apple dish i've ever made.  My parents brought me a ton of apples from BC and I have been trying to find something different to make!

Fantastic recipe.  I didn't have orange juice the first time I made it and substituted fresh lemon.  Was still great.  Love the use of the nutmeg.  Tried it a second time with the orange juice and was just as wonderful.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much for the contribution.

A very good and easy substitute for apple pie.  I used apple pie spice in mine and it turned out great.  The OJ tastes great with the apples!  I may try a little less sugar next time, but that's just personal taste.

I made this for my husband's birthday, instead of cake, and he gave it a thumbs up. I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 Splenda instead of the white sugar.

I've made this many times - easy and very good. Try with a sweet white dessert wine, ie late harvest riesling - divine. Could also make a larger amount in a 9 x 13 baking dish.

The 3 star rating may be because I altered the recipe.  I mixed melted butter instead of cutting in the butter so I guess I changed the consistency of the topping.  My husband liked the crispier oatmeal toppings used in some of the apple crisp recipes better though.  I also used Splenda instead of white sugar & it came out fine.

This was good, though it's really nothing more than an apple crisp with a lot of topping. Very simple to make. I added oatmeal to the topping, served warm with vanilla ice cream

The recipe is awesome. Very easy to fix and great with some vanilla ice cream. I suggest peeling to apples before putting them in and also reducing the amount of sugar for a healthier dessert. It's VERY YUMMY without all the fuss.

Wonderful desert. Can't imagine any better.
Yes, I made changes.
Substitute I/2 c. butter for 1/4 c. butter melted with1 /4 c. olive oil.  Increased cinnamon to 3/4 teaspoons.  Didn't have orange juice, used lemon juice.  
I will definitely make this time and time again. I imagine it will be good with the orange juice and will try that.  Might try increasing flour to I cup. Going to serve it for Thanksgiving.  Very good with French Vanilla Ice Cream.  My husband and I preferred it to an apple pie with crust.

Delicious!! I made this today and after reading some of the reviews, I did used the 1/2 white/brown sugar ratio.  It came out so good. I also cooked for and extra 15 minutes and peeled my apples.  My husband is very, very happy!!  Thank you!

WOW!! So good. I didn't have oranges to make juice but added fresh lemon juice instead and did what most folks mentioned did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugars. It was really yummy. I'll be making it again now that apple season is here ripe and ready. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Easy and delicious. Followed suggestion of 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Would cover it at the end next time to prevent from over browning. Very, very good.

This recipe is from a 1960s era Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook and I think it's true that when you use an older recipe it just tastes better. This is definitely a "comfort" dessert and tastes great. It has just the right amount of sweetness and the crumbly topping is soooo good, crunchy yet chewy, really yummy. It's best to use a flavorful apple such as Granny Smith or Macintosh but I'm sure any variety will work fine. I've been making this for years (since the 60's) and it's amazing every time.

Better than apple pie (in my humble opinion).  So easy and quick to make.  No pie crust to mess with, but so amazingly delicious.  Serve it warm with vanilla ice cream (just like pie ala mode).  This is my "go to" quick to make dessert whether having company over or going to a friend's house for dinner and bringing the dessert.  Never anything left over!

A little tartness from the OJ but a very easy recipe. Might use a little less OJ next time cause it was a little watery.

I tried this recipe today.  I'd seen some of the comments about it being runny.  I used gala apples.  Mine turned out delicious, but a little runny.   I think the problem is how much liquid is released by your apples.  Different apples can produce different amount of "juice" when cooked.  In a traditional apple pie this is addressed by tossing a bit of cornstarch with the apples when you prepare them.  I'm going to try that next time.  I'm confident that will make this recipe perfect.

This is the best and one of the easiest apple desserts ever.  The only change was I used brown suger (3/4  cup) because apples and  brown sugar just go together.  Otherwise everything was the same.  Really couldn't understand some other reviews about it being to watery etc.  I do believe it has to do with the apples and my favorite is the Granny Smith.  I used 3 1/2 lbs of apples.  Great, Great, Great!!!  Sharyn from Maui

Great easy desert!!!   The only thing I did differently was used a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg.  1/4 did not look like enough for the flour mixture.  I will cut the apple slices a little bigger next time and may add another apple.  Can use half brown sugar in place of white

I used only 3 apples and kept the topping the same.  It was excellent and just enough for 4 people.

This was SO good! I have never made an apple dessert in my life, but I was adventurous enough to make it yesterday for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it. It was all gone in minutes! I took some reviewers' advice and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, used half brown and half white, and baked it for an hour. For those who have complained about it being too soggy, they should check the kind of apples that they have used. I used Golden Delicious, but I think Granny Smith or Cortland or Empire would have been good too. And I didn't slice them too thin. Thanks so much for this recipe!
Tried again - used maple syrup instead of orange juice, and reduced sugar to half cup. Will stick to maple syrup version going forward,

The entire family loved this! To make it a bit healthier I used half whole wheat flour, oil instead of butter, and cut the sugar from 1 c. to 1/2 c. brown, 1/4 c. white. This is winner!

Like kathyd, I added more apples - just used 5 granny smiths and ended up with a little over 5 cups.  Did not peel the apples, for nutrition - how healthy can it be with a stick of butter, tho!!  My sis was here and, after everyone was done, grabbed a spoon to scrape the last remnants from the dish.  I added more cinnamon and a little oatmeal to the topping.  Yummy!

I tried this recipe and doubled it and ended up using half white and half brown sugar and instead of just plain orange juice, I used Orange peach mango juice. It turned out AMAZING. My boyfriend ate a whole one to himself.

I had very high hopes for this recipe. Although I liked it, my family thought it was way too sweet. If I make it again, I will use half as much sugar. Also, the apples were very soft (I used Granny Smith). I think that I will cut them thicker next time.

Soooo excellent! I used pineapple juice instead of orange and that worked also!  Served hot with 2 scoops of walnut ice cream on top, and a dusting of cinnamon sugar, I got ooo's and aaah's!

A bit too sweet.  I baked it in a pie crust which was good.  Next time I'll decrease the sugar.

The recipe is quite tasty, however, I would also use less orange juice and less sugar. I used a pie crust on the bottom and I think that made it even more tastier!

This dessert is so easy and really delicious. My husband thought it was one of the best desserts he'd ever tasted. It's good served warm with a little whipped cream on top. Without the crust, it's much healthier than regular apple pie, too.

This was a spur of the moment recipe as I had a bag of red delicious apples that were going to go bad if I didn't do something with them.  I followed this recipe to the letter and it was delicious. I served it with vanilla ice cream on top.  It has a nice buttery flavor. I think next time I will do what others are suggesting and add some brown sugar and raisins. I highly recommed this dish! YUMMY! :-)

Delicious but I would have used ONLY brown sugar, no white sugar. And I wish I had known that you let it sit for a bit and the streusel congeals and holds the dish together.

I've made this twice in 1 week.  My husband and kids really liked it.  The 1st time I made it according to the recipe, and found it a bit too sweet (although family liked it that way).  The 2nd time I halved the struesel topping, and to me it was just right (family still enjoyed it).  This recipe is definitely a keeper since it's so easy!

Mmm!  Mmm!  Good!  The crunchy-sweet topping was the best I've ever had, and the orange juice isn't as prominent as I thought it would be.  I thought 5 apples was a bit too many, so 4 would probably be good.

This is absolutely delicious!  I happily fool myself that it doesn't have as many calories as an apple pie...  I have made it several times and always get raves.  I serve it with French Vanilla ice cream.  What a treat!

Absolutely delicious  and easy to prepare.   I  substituted the cup of white sugar for a  1/2 cup white sugar and  half cup brown sugar.  Also,  I added a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts on top of the apples before adding  the  crumble mixture.    Served  with vanilla ice cream.   Thank you for the recipe.

My husband and I loved this! I used all Cortland apples, (about 5 apples) , used 1/2 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar.  Kept everything else the same but baked for 1 hour.  Was really delicious! Will definitely be making this again.  Super easy recipe!!

I’ve used this recipe for over forty years. I first found it in a USDA cookbook published in the 50s.
It always turns out great.
Since kids are grown and I live alone now I found a great way to continue enjoying this dish. 
Mix the dry ingredients and store.
Then when I want this, peel and slice apple and place in a small baking dish.
Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of orange juice.
In another dish measure 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon of mixed dry ingredients.
Cut 2 tablespoons of butter into dry ingredients. 
Scatter over apples then bake.
Amazing with a scoop of ice cream!

delicious recipe, but I changed a few things, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cups white sugar.  to the crumble I added 1/3 cup of old fashioned oats and 1/4 cup each of chopped pecans and  walnuts.  I also sprinkled cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg on apples before adding crumble. I also mixed dried cranberries to the apples.

This is delicious! Made it with old, wrinkly apples I’d had way too long. Peeled & cored them, then cooked in my cast iron pan. Used a little lemon juice & water in place of orange juice, and half brown sugar; half white. So glad I didn’t throw out those old apples. They worked just fine.

I used Granny Smiths with a few Bosc pears. As well, I seasoned the fruit with cinnamon and cardamom before putting on the topping. Also added cardamom to the topping and some good vanilla extract. It was a hit with my family and at a potluck.

We loved this dessert! I used apple cider instead of OJ and brown sugar instead of white. We served it warm with vanilla ice cream and our 4 boys had it gone in one sitting!! I will definitely make this again.

I will definitely make this again. I doubled the recipe for 11 people and it was just the right amount. No changes in the recipe at all. Very easy ~ only time consuming peeling, coring and slicing the apples.

I have been making this recipe for nearly 30 years!! I love it just the way it is, and never deviate!! I get so many compliments every single time, which is why I keep making it.  Keep the apples just at 4 cups, otherwise, you may need to make more topping. 
Serve it up hot, with a scoop of caramel ice cream! Enjoy!!

Just made this Apple Betty! Oh, my! Delightful. Trader Joe’s has 5 #’s of Organic Gala Apples for $5.99. The only change I made to the recipe was to use fresh squeezed organic orange juice. What s delightful dessert. I’ll be making this dessert frequently during the fall apple season.. 5 stars

I looked for an Apple Betty Recipe for National Apple Betty Day. 
I found this was a great recipe.  The recipe was easy to follow.  
I made no changes.  It turned out great.  I never had Apple Betty before, and I will definitely make this again.

I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I didn’t try it right out of the oven, but later that night. I heated a piece in the microwave and topped with vanilla ice cream. It was still good, but now I’m curious how good it would have been directly from the oven after a little cooling. I used honey crisp apples- they held their shape. For orange juice- I used maybe a tablespoonful just sprinkled on the top. For anyone wondering like me, I was trying to cut in the butter using a fork- it was much easier to slice the stick of butter into tablespoons and then quarters. I added the cubes of butter to the dry ingredient bow and dug in with my hands to crumble the butter in. Worked so much faster. I’m sure my kids would enjoy that step, the next time we make it.

I don’t make many desserts but gave this one a try because I had a bunch of small apples. They were hard to peel so I just left the skin on. Barring that one thing, it is outstanding and I will put it into my normal offerings. Next time I’ll peel them for sure.

This was not good. Taste was bland even though I added the OJ, some zest and vanilla to the apples. My apples were swimming in water and the top was like mush. The taste was there but it was wet; sopping might be a better word.

I make Apple crisp frequently. But this was the best I ever made. So very, very simple. I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/2 brown and white sugar. I left out the nutmeg, personal preference. I will make it again and again.

Easy and quick. I've made it twice and loved it both times. The 2nd time I used early season Honey Crisps...tarter at this stage....and cut the sugar by half. Turned out great! Was fantastic with vanilla ice cream.

This is so good! I've made this twice in a week, it's just that good. I might make it again tonight! It's a pain to peel the apples, other than that it's super easy. I also use half white and half brown sugar.

This recipe is from a BH&G cookbook I've had since I got married in 1971.  Hands down my husband's favorite dessert ever.  I have substituted other fruits:  frozen peaches (with and without blueberries), pears,  and dark cherries.  Just make sure any fruit you use is well drained and dry.  Too much juice will make the topping somewhat gooey.  Easy, easy, easy and always delicious.

I loved this recipe. Easy and fast the only possible change I would make is either a tarter apple, I used gala, or less sugar. It's the best deconstructed apple pie ever.

Nice recipe! I did make some changes since I only had two apples. I used the apples I had and added frozen mixed berries. I used all brown sugar but a bit less than the recipe called for, and doubled the cinnamon. My husband loved this dessert and he isn't a dessert lover usually. I will use this recipe again!

I've made it many times and always like the flavor and ease in putting together. I have two in the oven right now, but they will probably not be as good as all I had was gala apples. Really should use green cooking apples. Don't slice the apples too thin (too late), as it will be mushy. Because of the gala, I cut the temp and baking time down some. Love this website! Gail

This was so easy and fast to make. I used Ida Red apples (my favorites) and I paid attention to everyone's comments.  I used 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar instead of all white and I also added just a touch of ground cloves and a pinch of allspice.  DELICIOUS!!!

Rally good and so easy to make! One thing I recommend that's not on the directions is that you should peel your apples prior to cooking! The skins didn't taste right but the inside of the apples were amazing. I used 1c sugar but split it between white and brown sugars and that seem to add a lot of extra flavor. Top with vanilla ice cream and it's a huge hit!

We've always skipped the prange juice so our apples aren't too soggy. Substituting brown sugar makes a more toffee like consistency, we stick with the white.

We really liked this, I used lemon juice instead of orange because that's what I had and it's really just to keep the apples from turning brown - that said I would use a bit less next time even if I had oj.  I will make this again trying 1/2 brown sugar and a dash of cloves and/or allspice. It was good as written but I think those changes would make it great.  Next time I will put foil under the pie plate to catch the drips too.

Very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar, and otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I will make it a bit less sweet by cutting the topping ingredients down by a third or half.

The finished product was too watery. I did cut the sugar by about a quarter but the topping was still too sugary. Also the family wasn't a fan of the apples themselves as there was no flavor. So next time I reduce the oj by at least a third, the sugar by half, and add additional seasoning to the apples before adding the topping. I was thinking that replacing half the flour with oats might be a good change to make it a little more hearty. Still, I am glad I tried this recipe out as it showed me how easy it can be to throw a quick but comforting dessert together.

Made recipe exactly as stated and it came out delish and perfect. I used freshly ground nutmeg and fresh ground cinnamon and that made a big difference. Recipe is a keeper.

This is an excellent recipe. If you like it sweeter use Rome or Delicious apples. I like it with Jonathan, Granny Smith or Gala which are a little more tart. I think that balances the sweetness of the topping. And I usually double the topping because everybody loves that part:)

I was looking for a quick, easy dessert to make a few nights ago and came across this Apple Betty. Since I had all the ingredients on hand, I thought I'd give it a try. I took the suggestion of many others and mixed white and brown sugar. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! It was such a hit that I made it again the following evening. Now I'll have to be sure we don't always have apples available to prevent making it over and over:) Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been making this for years, it is my favorite apple pie because it is fast and easy and GOOD. A friend calls it old lazy pie because I was "too lazy to make pie crust" when in a creative mood try orange peel and or a pinch of ground clove in the topping.

This is a five for sure!  I use about 6 gala apples and I don't peel them, which I thought would be bad at first but it's not at all (I didn't have a good peeler but I bought one so I'll try it now) I use brown and white sugar like the reviews say and make sure you use REAL butter!  I mix the topping together so it will carmalize and put the rest on top so it will make the crust hard.  It's a huge hit and I serve it will Blue Bell Homeade Vanilla ice cream on top! Bon appetit!

Just tasted the pie.  Its really really delicious yet so simple to make. Copied the recipe but did leave it in the oven for 1 hr 15 min cuz i like the apple mushy.  The crunch on top goes so well with the mushy apples.

Simple and delish!  We topped French Vanilla Ice Cream with this and it was awesome!  Just tossed the ingredients together and popped it in the oven as we were sitting down for dinner.  It was out of the oven by the time we were done eating and cooled by the time we were done cleaning up.  Perfect!

I don't think I used enough apples as there was too much streusel on top. Also, I used about half the amount of orange juice as it looked like it was getting too soupy. It ended up with the right texture but just not enough apples.

Quick and easy and so yummy.  I probably cut the apples a little thin because the apples were very mushy but the taste was still very good.  Will definitely make again.

absolutely wonderful! my husband raved about it. we had grapefruit juice on hand so i used it instead of orange juice. we left the peels on the apples for a little extra tartness and because i was short on time! we will definitely have this again.

im giving a 3 because it must have been my fault somehow, but when i was cutting the powder ingredients with the butter, it never got to a crumb like state, it was all powdery, then before i knew it it was a big blob of paste.  i used it anyways thinking it would melt in the oven and still be good but it wasnt.  it had good flavor but was hard to eat.

This recipe is so delicious!  I made it for the first time over the winter, I've made it at least once a month ever since.  It's a very easy recipe, just make sure to peel the apples, I didn't the first time and the peels were very tough. Definitely make this!!!

I made the crumb topping in my food processor, but found there was too much butter, so it amalgamated into a kind of gloop!  I added another 1/2 cup of flour and gave it another burst - fab crumbs! The topping ended up rather too crunchy, but I guess this is due to my extra flour.  Next time I will just reduce the butter in the first place.  The taste is great - I used English Bramley apples and didn't need any extra sugar.

Most Excellent Dessert.  Or breakfast depending on your inclinations.  I added a handful of chopped pecans to the apples, because I like pecans.  Easy and fast when you need to make something quick and easy for company.

I've made this recipe twice and both times I thought to myself "this needs less flour". I like my crust to have a little more crunch. Also I suggest two green apples and one red apple to cut the tartness a bit.

This should be called an Apple Crisp, not an Apple Betty which should be made with bread cubes.  Th was very good.

Very good! I think I may have overbaked it a bit because the apples were too soft but it was still great...just not perfect. We ate it a la mode with some carmel sauce on top. Yum!

Yum Yum Yum!  This was a quick and delicious way to use up some apples I had from an orchard.  I used apple pie spice and half brown sugar/half white.  Delicious!

This recipe is fantastic!! I have made it twice so far this week and everyone who had tried it has loved it!  I substituted the OJ this time around with apple cider and it is delish!  We serve it over Edys icecream with carmel swirl and carmel cups and ites to die for! Drizzle a little bit of caremel on top if you really have a sweet tooth!

I did not use the salt - as I never do. This was so good! It had all the right amounts of spices (I added a pinch more cinnamon) and was scrumptious with fat free vanilla frozen yogurt.

Not a fan of pie crust so this was perfect!  Easy to make and tastes great.  I served warm over vanilla ice cream.

This was SO easy to make, and so delicious. Why buy store bought desserts when you can make this in a snap?

I definitely wouldn't call this a pie, more of an apple dessert, but it is delicious and really easy to make. The whole family enjoyed it, even my very picky 3 year old.
