YUM!!!! I had some extra blackberries that needed to be used up and as soon as I saw this recipe, I knew I had to make it!  I'm pretty picky about my BBQ sauce, and I have 2-3 different recipes on rotation that I make from scratch.  That said, I love trying new, interesting recipes and this fit the bill. Not only did I have all the ingredients, I try to follow a low-carb diet, so this was a win-win!  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I was tempted to add in a few drops of liquid smoke (like I do with my other fave BBQ sauce recipes), but I resisted and thought the flavor was fabulous. I grilled up some chicken breasts and brushed this on in the last few minutes of grilling. This would also be excellent on grilled shrimp! Looking forward to experimenting with different meats. Love the bright color too! Thank you Nicole for this fabulous recipe!

Made it as directed here. It's got a kick to it, but it's good on the meat. If I make it again I may use a sieve to remove the seeds from the blackberries.

Good stuff! I made a double batch and basted chicken skewers and tri-tip skewers on the BBQ, then added sauce after cooking. Sauce was really good. Kind of reminded me of the food fair at Knottâ€™s Berry Farm, but with blackberries instead of boysenberries. The cayenne pepper added just the right amount of kick.
