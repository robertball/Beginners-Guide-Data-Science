I made several changes to this recipe to make it a 5 star recipe. For that reason I give it 4 stars. The changes I made were: I pre-baked the crust for 8 minutes, I cooked the filling on the stove top and added 1 tsp. almond extract, 2 TBS water and 2 TBS flour to thicken. 2 cups of filling was clearly not going to be enough, so I tossed in 1 cup of blueberries just before pouring into the pie shell. I also made extra crust and crumbled it over top of the pie before baking for about 12 minutes. I would suggest greasing the pie plate or using cooking oil spray, as the pie was difficult to remove from the plate.

I loved this recipe! My husband and I try to eat healthy foods all the time, and this is our new favorite. I doubled the crust recipe to make a top crust as well. I also heated the cherries with 3/4 cup of Splenda (sugar substitute) and 4 Tbl. of organic flour to a boil in a pot to thicken up a bit before cooking. We made an apple pie in addition to the cherry, which worked just as well. The cooking time was a bit more than 12 minutes,  but worth it. 5 stars....

Delicious! I used instant steel cut oats, and let them soak in 4 tbls. water while I pitted the cherries. Added 2 tbls. flour to the sugar that I put in the cherries. I did add 1/4 c. wheat germ to the crust, added another tsp vanilla, and held out about 1/2 c. to sprinkle on the top. Pre baked the crust while the oven was preheating, and baked it for 13 mins at 425, then lowered the temp to 300 and baked another 10 mins. It's like a cherry crisp.

So here's what I did.  First of all i'm gluten-free so I just substituted GF flour which was the only thing that needed to be changed.  Like others, I pre-baked the crust and cooked the cherries on the stove with the added water and GF flour plus a little vanilla extract and cinnamon.  I admit I used butter instead of margarine but I added flaxseed to the crust :)

I baked little minis in cupcake wrappers with extra dough crumbled on top - they turned out wonderfully!!!

I really enjoyed the flavor of the crust with the cherries. I read the reviews and let the crust bake in the oven while it was pre-heating. By the time the oven was heated the crust was crunchy, then added the cherries and had to cook about 20 minutes. It was very watery/ runny so I suggest pre-thickening the cherries. But all in all, it had a really good flavor.

This pie didn't work for me at all.  After the suggested baking time, the crust wasn't cooked at all, so I continued to bake it little by little, and finally... the sugar and natural juices of the cherries started carmelizing, yet the crust was still uncooked.  I ended up having to throw it out.

if anyone else braves this one, let me know how it turns out.  I had a really hard time finding any pie recipe that called for fresh cherries, so I really wanted this one to work.

Had a fresh healthy taste--not overly sweet or laden with fat.  This is more like an inverted cobbler/crisp.  Definitely pre-cook the crust.  Also, after reading the other reviews I added 2 tbs tapioca to reduce the wateriness.

It’s a very good recipe and just what I needed to use up my cherries before they went bad.  It’s easy to make and has a nice flavor, the hardest part is getting the cherries ready.  Because of the reviews I did precook the crust a little and I also added 2 tablespoons of flour to my cherries and sugar to keep it from being to watery….worked out well.  Thanks Annie!

I don't think I'm going to save this one...I think I'd rather have the calories & fat, etc.  It wasn't terrible, but there are better ways to eat cherries!!!

I enjoyed this recipe, but I would classify it more as a cross between a pie and a cobbler. While the crust makes the pie very healthy, it's not quite the same as a traditional pie crust in taste or texture. I would like to try this next time as small, individual pies.

I love this crust, I use it for more than just cherry pie just by altering a bit (white sugar instead of brown, adding nuts, etc). One thing I did to change this recipe was I cooked the cherries over the stovetop for a few minutes and added some almond extract.

This was a delicious treat. However, after the suggested cooking time, it wasn't done. I ended up cooking it for over an hour. After that, it was delish!

First time I'd ever made any kind of "pie", and I had sacks of fresh cherries that needed to get used up, so I didn't expect perfect results. However what came out of the oven was pretty darn tasty! Like others said, it may be more of a tart or crumble than a "real" pie, but because it was so easy, and tasted fine, I give this 4 stars!

4 stars just because it is very yummy.  The crust is awesome and can be used for so much more.  HOWEVER.... Made as directed, it is very very liquidy... made the crust on the bottom mushy and definitely didn't keep the shape of a pie.  Still tastes great though.

I didn't have the full two cups of cherries, probably only 1 cup and it turned out a little bland, but I wish I had read some of the reviews first to spice it up a little more and still keep it real healthy! I love the simplicity of it though! Will definitely try again!

I've made some changes with some healthier options. I've substituted the margarine with coconut oil which then allowed me to use less sugar (1 teaspoon of brown sugar for the base and 1 teaspoon of honey instead of white sugar for the filling). I've also use besan flour instead of regular white flour. It is sweet, light and tasty

My hubby like the taste of the crust, I like the cherries. Next time I'm going to add the water a little at a time. I feel that the crust needed to be a little crisper so add 1/8 to a 1/4 cup chopped nut may be in order then bake it oven first. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I can not speak for the crust since I only made the filling. However, the filling was absolutely delicious in ordinary pie crust. Everyone who tried the Cherry Pie, loved it. My only regret is not making more.

Pretty good! I added mini chocolate chips and cinnamon. Also, I made extra crust for the top.

When I followed the instructions I ended up with a crust full of cherries just floating in sugar water. (I did use maple syrup instead of sugar but it shouldn't have mattered.) It didn't turn into a cohesive pie at all. Also 12 minutes wasn't long enough to brown the crust. We ended up pouring pie mixture into pot on the stove after the fact and cooking until it jellied, then pouring back into pie crust which worked great. I would recommend pre cooking cherries and sugar on stove top.

The crust was AMAZING!! I kind of cheated and just used store-bought filling though.
