I was not expecting much since this was so simple. WOW was this tasty and quick. Second time I made it the only difference I made was use 1/2 and 1/2  and add some more fresh garlic.  Perfect weeknight sauce if you like lots of fresh basil and chunks of tomato. Only suggestion is to double for family. I made this for 2 people and we used all the sauce.

April K - this rocks!  So easy and even though I used store brand diced Italian style tomatoes it was great.  I started the water for the pasta, started heating the tomatoes & gave them a little smash with my potato masher.  By the time I had snipped the fresh basil the water was boiling as were the tomatoes.   A couple slices of bread to soak up the extra sauce, along with a green salad and a sprinkle of Parmesan.   Fine dining in the time it took to cook pasta.  BTW - I used Penne pasta but any kind would be great.

This recipe was a winner with my toddler! I had a can of regular diced tomatoes only, so first i minced 1/4 of an onion and 2 cloves of garlic and sautéed in some butter, then i followed the recipe as indicated. Topped with fresh shaved Parmesan cheese. It was delicious and is now in the “Winner Dinner” cookbook (aka - stuff my picky kid will actually eat!). Thanks!

Really tasty! I ran the tomatoes quickly through a food processor to chop up the tomatoes a bit. I also make a roux to add to it. It def needs thickening. I also added garlic salt and red pepper flakes to jazz it up a bit. Served over pasta with salmon.
