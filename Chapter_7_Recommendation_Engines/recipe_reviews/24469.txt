I thought these were horrible. No one in my family liked them and no one ate them. They might have been better with milk chocolate chips.

these were...itnteresting!! I can't say I'd make them all the time incredibly rich. Definitely hit the spot for a time but then got to be a little much. Would I make them again? Yeah probably.

The kids and I had a lot of fun making this treat. I used Kettle Chips which I'm sure held up a little better than your average potato chip. Nice combo of salty and sweet and really made my bad day good again.

I melted the chips on the stovetop instead of the microwave. Very good but next time I would use more of the peanut butter chips to give them more p-nut butter flavor.

This is an excellent and easy treat. I did not add the peanuts and used ripple chips instead. I also cut the recipe in half and still ended up with 50 - 60 mini cups. They freeze excellent and had many compliments. Thanks for a great post.

These were great and came together in no time. I halved the recipe using a small ( 0.99) bag of rippled chips. I also realized I only had milk chocolate chips so I used 'em. Very good though not the most visually appealing cookie. THANKS for the recipe EYTAVI!

Best and easiest thing you could make in minutes to satisfy many many people. Have not met a person that did not have to have this recipe after eating one.

Made these for Christmas and then were eaten by my family in a day. I didn't have Peanut Butter Chips so I used white Vanilla Chips. They are delicious and have been asked to make more.
