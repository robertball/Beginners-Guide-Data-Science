I made this for my mother, since I'm underage, and she seemed to like it. For minors such as myself, I suggest substituting butterscotch flavoring for the schnapps and adding a tablespoon of butter.

This recipe was WAY too sweet for my taste.  I made it with ginger beer rather than the cream soda, and LOVED it.
