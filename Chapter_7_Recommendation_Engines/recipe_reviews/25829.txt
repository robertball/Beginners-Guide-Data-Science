Did you ever already know something was going to be good just by mixing up the dough or batter?  This was one of those times for me.  First, you're already a step ahead given the inviting array of ingredients - oatmeal, chocolate chips, pecans, coconut. I figured these were going to be rich and delicious, provided the dough turned out well, and it did.  No wimpy, sissy cookie this!  This is a hearty, chewy, flavorful cookie, with loads of contrasting textures.  This is a perfect, old-fashioned, basic, lunch-box or cookie jar favorite. One worth making whether you're "spring cleaning" or not.  I made no changes other than using half-and half for the evaporated milk- the recipe (and cookie!) is darn good, just as it stands, although there's plenty of room for improvising to include whatever's in your pantry. Just a word of caution - watch baking time carefully!  I made fairly good-sized cookies and they were done in 10 minutes.

This recipe is definately a keeper!  My family really enjoyed eating these cookies.  I did make a few ingredient changes:  Instead of using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, I used 1 cup butter; instead of 2 TBSP evaporated milk, I used 2 TBSP 2% milk; and lastly instead of using 2 cups all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  As another reviewer suggested, I baked for approximately 10 mins.  They were 'too' yummy; it was hard to stop at one cookie.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I just made these after I saw the recipe, because I had a bunch of ingredients that needed to be used too.  I overcooked the first sheet full, but I tasted one of those and they were pretty tasty even over-browned.  A very good balance of flavors, and very easy to make.  It helps to have a stand mixer that you can throw everything into instead of breaking your arm mixing it all yourself.  Great cookies, Lisa!

Haha, I laughed when I saw these were called spring cleaning cookies because this really IS all the ingredients people have left over!! I had everything on the list so I decided to bake them regardless....GOOD DECISION!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they turned out beautifully. Baked one batch at 15 mins, and another at 13 to give a choice between chewy or crispy. Lovely!!!

I never tell anyone where I found this.  As far as they know these are MY cookies.  Keeping this one secret from the family, too good to share with them. Only one that doesn't like them is my mother and thats because she thinks no one can make anything better then her.

I have made a similar recipe, basically without the milk which I think makes them more "cake" like. I would make them again but without the milk.

Fantastic!  Used all butter (not a fan of the artificial ingredients in shortening), one cup white/one cup whole wheat flour, and half & half instead of evaporated milk (just b/c I didn't have any EM). For my add-ins, I used what I had in the pantry - coconut, semi-sweet choc chips, white choc chips, rolled oats, and craisins (soaked in warm water for 15 min to plump them up before draining and adding). Hubs says they are addicting! Thanks for a great recipe to use up all the leftovers in the pantry!

I subsituted maple extract for vanilla, and then used one cup of margarine instead of the butter & shortening. The cookies came out crunchy and delicious! A perfect recipe. You can't taste the coconut at all, it just gives the cookies a terrific texture. Using an electric mixer is recommended, though!

Love these! I'm starting to think I'm eating more dough than cookies, but they're delicious either way! I've been using my small pampered chef cookie scoop and so far have gotten five dozen and have only used about 2/3 of the dough. Lucky for me, cuz these aren't going to last long at my house! Thanks for a keeper!

I used walnuts (because that's what my spring cleaning turned up!) I also used regular milk so I wouldn't have a can of eval milk laying around. The dough is delicious (oops!) I baked these at 350 because I didn't read the recipe.  This may have been why my cookies turned out very crumbly. They fell apart really easily.  It made good ice cream topping though.

I wasn't too crazy about these cookies but everyone else loved them. I have had several request for the recipe. Nice way to use up all the "extras" in the pantry.

Excellent basic recipe that allows you to add whatever you have! I used the coconut and oats, but only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, so I added 1 cup raisins and a 1/2 cup of craisins (dried Cranberries) that I had in the cupboard. More of a oatmeal/raisin feel to them, but I agree, the coconut is a nice, chewy touch. I also took someone's suggestion of substituting whole wheat flour since I'm always trying to bake a little healthier for the kids. Delicious!

These cookies were really good, but they flattened out so so much! We like our cookies to have more substance to them.

These are the best Chocolate Chip cookies I have ever made.  Followed the recipe strictly but did use 50% whole wheat and 50% all purpose flour.  Also used Crisco's butter flavored baking sticks for the shortening.  Got lots of requests for this recipe.

Hubby & i love these!  No matter what you substitute, they're always yummy and a bit different from the last batch.  My recipe is called Emma Byler's 10 Cup Amish Cookies.   Makes a BIG batch, too!

I just happen to have a little of this and a little of that to clean out my pantry and make these. They were a little dry. And done at the 10 min. mark. Probably wont make again. Coming back to edit; they were not too bad after being frozen for 2 wks.

To me this is a glorified chocolate chip cookie.  The texture is great and very tasty.  Not something I would make instead of chocolate chip cookies all of the time, but a nice change.

These cookies are awesome. They look like something you would buy in a bakery & they taste fantastic!  Subbed half and half for the evaporated milk & subbed butter for the shortening (didn't have it). Beautiful, wonderful, tasty cookie that I was proud to share with friends and family!

I made these cookies for a potluck at work and they were a hit.  Several people asked when I would bring them again! The cookies had great texture, nice and chewy.  Substituted butter for shortening and 1% milk for evaporated milk.  13 minutes was perfect and the recipe made 5 dozen.  I may try to decrease the amount of sugar next time.

Nice, hearty cookies.  Very delicious!  I followed the recipe as is, and although I froze most of them for my cookie platters, I thought these were flavorful, very hearty, and not too sweet.  Very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make something very similar.  When a cereal box gets emptied, I save all the "bits" and crumbs that are left and put them in a jar.  Everything gets mixed all together.  At cookie making time these "bits" are used where it calls for oatmeal.  Depending on the type of cereal it sometimes also replaces the coconut.  Anything and everything gets used,  Those are really a "clean out the pantry" type cookie.  I make them alot and never get the same thing twice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  It is always nice when someone works out the "kinks" (quantities)   I guestimate a lot when I am creating.  The kids love it when we make these as they can add the extras that they prefer - the choices are unlimited.   Will have to make them with the grandsons some day.  Their dad has a KitchenAid so we can just dump and create.
Thanks again.

i altered the recipe a bit to use what i had (keeping in the spirit of the recipe).  I used egg beaters and fat free evaporated milk, and white chocolate chips in place of the nuts (honey doesn't like nuts).  Came out pretty darn good!  a little dense, but that could have been because of my alteration.

I 'almost' made them.  I didn't quite have 2 cups of AP flour, so 1 of AP, 1 of whole wheat.  I didn't have chopped nuts.  I had slightly more than 1 1/2 cups of oats..so it all went in.  I didn't have evaporated milk, but I had homemade dulce de leche..yeah, okay, that'll taste good.  I thought it might need a little extra moisture so I threw in an extra small egg.  Why didn't it call for cinnamon...that goes in too.  Yup I had chocolate chips - oops, they were a mix of milk chocolate and semi-sweet...good enough.  HEY I had actual flaked coconut! YAY...I got one ingredient exactly right...but darn it I wasn't going to throw away the last 1/4 cup left in the bag..so that went in too.  I gotta say that dough looked good enough to eat on its own (no, remember those raw eggs...)  375 for 10 minutes, then I turned them 180 and 6 minutes more was perfect.  WOW these are so GOOD!!!

Wow. Very, very good. I followed the recipe exact, except I only had 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 1 1/2, so I added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips. Next time I will try it with all chocolate, but it was still very good.

These cookies are incredible!  Everyone loved them, even the kids who don't like coconut.  I used up all my extra ingredients too.  I'll have to go buy more because I will make these again and again!
