This recipe is also called som tam, a thai dish. Very good for if you are dieting. I gave it 5 stars because it was great tasting(I cut down on  the spice a pinch), easy to make, and my kids love the color in it. Will make again :)

This was so yummy!  We just got back from Thailand and loved all the great food.  I added mango instead of papaya (taste preference) and I also added sweet red peppers and used cashews because that was all I had.  I cannot stop eating this salad!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was soooo good and so easy. It's going to be a staple at home. I left the spicy stuff out and since I don't have papaya I replaced it with a cup of Tropical Fruit Mix from Dole which has some papaya in it. It was delicious.
Don't leave the cilantro out and don't forget to chop the peanuts. It makes a difference.

I make this salad very often these days. Instead of cubing the papayas though, I slice it very thinly. Also, I add chunky peanut butter to the sauce which gives incredible rich peanut flavor!

DELISH! I made this to use up some ingredients I had on hand, so my expectations weren't that high. Wow, was I thrilled with the results. I used mango and pineapple instead of papaya, had cashews instead of peanuts, and didn't have fish sauce so I upped the soy sauce slightly. With the changes, still a winner. I served over Jasmine rice-yum! My husband is always skeptical when I make these healthy, unique, ethnic dishes, and offers some constructive criticism. But this one left him speechless--he LOVED it. I will be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing!!

This salad has beautiful color and presentation.  I blanched my green beans for added color.  Next time I will slightly reduce the fish sauce.

Very nice sauce.  I'm sorry to say it turns out I don't like papaya, but that's not your fault!  I love mango though so will try with that next time.

I make this salad all the time but add more fruit (all of the tropical variety, whatever's at the store, usually pineapple and sometimes some peaches too.  My current roommate is allergic to papaya, so I've been improvising lately).  The longer it sits, the spicier it gets.  Because I can't always get the fish sauce for the dressing, I usually make up my own using the juices from an orange, lemon, & grapefruit with fresh ginger, rice vineager, and a little sugar.

De-lish! I like to add a splash of soy sauce and olive oil to the dressing, and a can of rinsed black beans for a more hearty meal.

This salad was amazing! Very refreshing and light. I made the salad about an hour before serving. This let the dressing be soaked up by the veggies and papaya and blended the flavors very well. Definitely will make again.

Very good. Left the fish sauce off since I am a vegetarian. Did slightly blanch the green beans. Everyone thought it was great!

Light, refreshing and very colorful. I subbed mango for the papaya due to personal preference, and like others, I blanched the green beans. I thought there was a little something missing flavor-wise - maybe some ginger? - but all in all it was pretty good!

Great summer salad! Nice and refreshing on a hot day. I substituted tamari for the fish sauce since I'm vegan and used a combo of pineapple and mango to replace the papaya since it wasn't available at my grocery store. Would definitely make again.

Gorgeous, healthy and delicious! To make this papaya salad more authentic, I found a papaya that was still as green as possible and grated it to make up the bulk of the salad. I love peanuts on this but was disappointed to find last minute that I was out. I subbed toasted sesame seeds instead and it was good. The flavours in this salad are phenomenal. Thank you, I will make this again and again as it felt like I was right there in Thailand!

I have made this twice now and my husband and I both really like it.  I do believe I will blanch the green beans and maybe try it with some peanut butter in the sauce.  I served it with blackened tuna and we both thought it went very well together.

This was good but not great. I've had really fabulous green papaya salads in Thai restaurants, and next time I have green papaya on hand, I will try to replicate those instead!

TRY THIS!!  Not sure what made me since it is so unusual, perhaps that I was making south beach coconut chicken and they seemed to make sense together.  But when it came time to make and eat it we were really nervous.  It was delicious!!  So fresh and flavorful.  Not sure what fish sauce is (I am the sister of a chef, so I get to be all kinds of ignorant when it comes to food since that is her job!), but it is not what I thought it was, i.e. strongly fishy tasting.  Only change I made was to blanch the green beans for a few minutes before putting them in ice water.  Just didn't want raw green beans - call me wimpy if you want.  My papaya seemed to be from Mexico and was pinker than the one in the picture, if that matters.  Luscious, luscious, luscious and ridiculously healthful.  Thanks taddy, will be making again and again. (Oh, and it did actually go great with the SB coconut chicken)
