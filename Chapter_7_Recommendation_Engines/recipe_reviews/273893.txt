The current picture definitely does not do this dish justice. I have never enjoyed a dessert recipe so much! Who knew that blueberries go even better with cinnamon sugar than apples? Thank you so much for posting!

The universe has granted me this most magickally delicious cobbler recipe. I energetically concocted this masterpiece yesterday and my family was over the moon for it. This cobbler is tens of notches more lusciously enchanting than any other recipe known to mankind. My taste buds have been transcended into a frenzied, flavor-filled realm, leaving my palate aching for more. The luxuriously simple ingredients allow for an intensely enjoyable gastronimic experience. Please listen to your spirit guides and allow your inner-chef  to experience this stroke of culinary genious!

The reviews couldn't be more accurate. I've just recently gotten into cooking/baking and this is the best dessert recipe I've made yet! Very easy to follow and serve. If you don't love it, then you must have done something wrong!

This was delicious and easy to make. I didn't have enough blueberries so I added strawberries and raspberries too. It was a hit with others and is good reheated next day in the microwave.
