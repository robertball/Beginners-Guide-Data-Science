I'm giving this soup a 3 only because it inspired me to develop my own recipe for a similar soup.  I’d give it a one making it following the directions exactly as given.  I made the recipe following the recipe and found the package smoked sausage inappropriate for an Italian soup.  It was too salty using the bouillon powder and there wasn’t enough broth.  The soup was also way too meaty and the sausage was very tough.  Here is my variation of this soup.  

Ingredients

1 lb. hot Italian sausage, loose
4 potatoes, cut into ¼ inch slices
1 cup chopped onion
8 slices bacon, crispy
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2½ (packed) cups kale, washed, dried, and shredded
3 (14.5 oz.) cans chicken broth
½ cup heavy whipping cream
fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions

1.  Brown sausage in dutch oven, drain

2.  In a griddle cook bacon until crispy, reserving grease, crumble, and set aside.  In just enough bacon grease, about one tablespoon, sauté onions until almost clear.       

3.  Add garlic to the onions and sauté an additional 1 minute.  Add chicken broth, potatoes, and sausage.  Simmer until potatoes are cooked, about 45 minutes.

4.  Add crumbled bacon, kale, cream, and fresh ground black pepper.  Simmer 5 minutes and serve.

Great flavor. I'm a health nut so I doubled up on the kale and only used half the sausage as some have suggested. I also replaced the full-fat sausage with turkey kielbasa, which still gives great flavor. I used canned white Northern beans instead of potatoes since I was in a hurry. If you want the creaminess in the soup without all the fat, blend a drained can of Northern white beans with chicken broth (to the consistency you want)instead of the cream. I used chicken broth instead of the water(the brand Imagine has a boxed broth that costs the same as a can for the amount -- it's the best broth I've tasted). Also, you can get the same great flavor with only three or four pieces of bacon.

After taking the advice of several other reviewers, I think this is one of the very best soups that I have ever tried!
I substituted chicken broth for the boullion cubes and water, used 5 red potatoes with the skin on, instead of 2, used 1/2 lb. Italian sausage browned instead of baked, and substituted spinach for the kale, as I'm not a huge fan of the kale in Olive Garden's version.  WOW!  Delicious!  I took this to a gathering and everyone wanted the recipe! I definitely recommend giving this one a try!

This was fantastic, and quite possibly better than the original. Instead of smoked sausage, I used bulk Italian sausage and pre browned it in a skillet before adding in. I also upped the water to 1 1/2 Q and found that the sausage added to the flavor just fine. I also dropped the cream to 1/2 C instad of 1/3. Finally, I find using a thick smokehouse bacon to be the best for this recipe.

Good soup.  I do however like it better with ground italian sausage (which I brown, not bake).  when I add the sausage to the soup I also like to give a sprinkle of crushed red pepper for an extra kick.  Thanks Holly :)

My family and I absolutely love this recipe.  It's rich and flavorful and closely matches the soup served at the Olive Garden.  We use only Maggi boullion, which delivers an authentic taste.  Easy to make in a fraction of the time called for, if you prepare.

This recipe is truly wonderful!  I had never had or made Zuppa Toscana before.  My sister said that she always orders this (her favorite) at the Olive Garden and it tasted just like it!  I didn't change a thing and have made it for the second time in 5 days!  I originally tripled this recipe for my mothers' 50th birthday party.  I served it in "Bread Bowls" from this website and got two thumbs up approval from everyone!  Which says a lot...my family is Italian!  Thank you! :o)

Only reason this did not make 5 stars is because it was too salty...I will try again and adjust. But it was sooo yummy other than that.

WOW! This was so good.  I dont really like the soup at the Olive Garden but my boyfriend has been asking me to make it for the longest time.  I found this recipe and thought id try it. I loved it.  It wasnt hard to make and it was delicious.  I didnt change much except i used spicy sausage and spinich, not smoked sausage and kale.  I also added some fresh ground pepper.  Mmm, so good.  Going to make it again very soon!

Everyone including 2-year-old loved this!  We had to make 2 pots because we ate the first one up and didn't have any left overs for lunch.  Our adjustments for the second pot was boiling the kale with the potatoes, reducing the chicken bouillon to 2 tsp, 1 extra cup of water, and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Can't wait until lunch tomorrow!

I enjoyed the flavor combinations in this soup, although it seemed extremely salty to me.  Next time I will forget the bacon and use chicken broth for the liquid instead of the chicken base and water.  I think it would be great with spicy sausage instead of the smoked.

Very good, however i did make some changes but wanted to try kale for the first time and absolutely loved it. I did a lower fat version using Turkey smoked sausage which i sauteed with onion until the onion was soft, then added the potatoes. I added enough chicken broth to cover, added salt, pepper and garlic powder. Boiled for 10-15 min and then lowered heat and added the kale and let it simmer until the kale was soft. My picky nephew even gobbled this up!!!

I followed others reviews and used browned bulk sausage.  I used spicy Italian turkey sausage, an extra teaspoon of garlic and it turned out great.  My husband said that he didn't think he could tell the difference between this one and the restaraunt's soup.

This is my favorite soup at Olive Garden, so I was excited to try this recipe out! I made it for the first time today, with a few personal modifications. I used Italian turkey sausage and ground it up instead of slicing it, and I used red new potatoes because I had some already. I also left the bacon out because I didn't see the point in it.  Overall I love it!! It was very similar, just needed some salt and pepper! My family approved of it and asked for more, which means something because they aren't typically soup eaters. Will definitely be adding this to my frequent dishes!!

We loved the cream with the soup and it was very yummy.  My daughter suggested we put zucchini in it next time and I think that is a good idea.

This was a lot saltier than I expected, probably because of the bacon. DD (12) was coming down with a cold, so I thought some soup with veggies would help. I tried adding 1 cup milk to ease the salt, but next time, I'd leave out the bacon altogether and use a tiny bit of smoke flavoring instead; it would save on fat and salt. This was a great way to use some kale and get the kids to eat it. Thanks for the post.

This was brilliant. I browned and drained the sausage before adding instead of baking, and halved the amount of bacon to reduce the salt. I also used less sausage, because it seemed like a lot for the recipe. Really good comfort food, keeps really, well, and was best with fresh kale. I also used baby gold potatos and kept the skin on, and seasoned the soup with a little black pepper.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I have made this soup so many times but decided to try a new recipe and came upon this one. First off, the sausage was extremely dry and overcooked - 25 minutes was way too long. Also, there was way too much kale and way too much meat. After spending an hour in the kitchen, I really wish this would have come out better.

In the future, I would recommend sticking to cooking sausage in the pan - it may be a little greasier but it comes out less dry and chewy, and you can always drain the fat. Also, the potatoes were way undercooked. 15 minutes was not long enough. With some tweaking this recipe could be awesome!

Very good. I would have to agree with everyone else about the recipe being very salty. I also was not crazy about the bacon in the soup. It was a little soggy afte you put it in the soup. Besides that, very good. I had to you spinach because the store did not have any kale.

I made this last night for dinner with crusty french loaves and it was very tasty. In order to lighten it up I made a few changes: I used hot turkey italian sausage and fat free half and half and they worked perfectly. I also cooked the bacon and onions seperately and added the crumbled bacon at the end as directed. I'm definitely adding this to my collection.

This is just as good as Olive Garden.  I  used fresh Italian Sausage (cooked and crumbled) instead of the smoked sausage.  Also, added about 1 cup of half & half.  Next time I'll use a bit more potato. Delicious!!!

4 Stars as written. I only use 1/2 pound of sausage. Use hot Italian Chicken sausage, and remove the meat from the casing, browning it in large "crumbles". I use low-sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water to cut down on sodium. If I have thick sliced bacon on hand, I only add 3 slices. It is best with heavy cream, but, I don't usually have it on and and use 1/2 & 1/2 (which I always have). It still tastes fantastic. Hubby says it's better than Olive Garden.

used ground italian sausage because its just more appropriate and had chicken broth (i make it homemade) so i used that instead of water and chicken bouillon. Love it and love the leftovers though.

Wow!  The only change I made was using sweet chicken sausage because my daughter doesn't like spicey foods.  It was perfect for a cold autumn night after soccer.  The amount of flavors in the few ingredients were amazing.  BTW, 1 qt of water is four cups.  I just used 2 cans of chicken broth.

Nice, but I prefer to let the bacon, garlic, onion and sausage boil together for awhile before adding the potatoes and cream. This imparts more flavour to the broth.

I live in Erie, PA, and cold is a reality, except for August.  Maybe.  Further I am a great soup lover and this is a great soup and I love it.  It has meat, potatoes and veggies and the broth is to die for.

Had to make a healthy version, but I gave it five stars for being an excellent recipe with which to modify to healthy.   I used 1/2 pound Italian-seasoned ground turkey, 6 slices turkey bacon, nearly tripled the amount of stock, and used skim milk instead of cream. It was really, super good!!!

I have made Zuppa Toscana many times, and this version was my least favorite. It's almost like the 1 quart of water was supposed to be 2 quarts. There was way too much sausage for the amount of liquid. Sorry, this just didn't work for me.

I use bulk Italian Turkey Sausage & saute' it with the onions & bacon, being careful not to let it brown.  Then I added the remaining ingredients except for the cream and let it simmer for 15 minutes...added the cream & served.  Great flavor!  We like it better than OG's! :o)  Thanks for sharing!

This soup is so good.  It tastes exactly like the soup at Olive Garden.  I doubled some things in it, like the water, bouillon, whipping cream, garlic, and bacon.  I didn't use all of my sausage either.  It was perfect!

Olive Garden Zuppa Tuscana lovers, you have to try this! I just made it 2 hrs ago and am really excited about it. My friend says it's really like the one in Olive Garden. I don't know if it's exactly the same, but either it's close enough or just as delicious. I did not use links but used breakfast style sausage roll. I also fried the bacon, removed it, got rid of the oil except for about 1 tablespoon, then cooked the onions, and this still produced a very rich soup.

Not exactly like the soup at Olive Garden, but wonderful none the less.  Little salty though.  Second time I made it I cut back on the chicken base.  Also tried some fresh italian sausage rather than the smoked sausage.  Different flavor, still delicious!

This would have been perfect, if I had added another potato and only used 8 oz mild italian sausage.  I used 16 oz of hot italian sausage and it was much too hot for us.  Great recipe!

loved it, I had been wanting this soup for a while so we made it, friends came over and every bit was eaten.  I had planned on having left overs for lunch.  I personally would recommend open casings on sausage and browning them as I did not like the chunks of meat.   We are already planning to make it again.

This soup was absolutley delicious! Brings back memories of when I used to work for a well known restaurant that made this soup and for lunch/dinner break I used to have 2-3 bowls! Thank You, Holly, for posting this recipe. Will make this soup over and over again. A keeper!

This recipe is fantastic. If you like Olive Gardens Zuppa Toscano, you will love this one. I would recommend using half the amount of smoked sausage to create a less faty soup.

Delicious recipe, but very time consuming.  I used homemade spicy Italian sausage from an Italian deli.  I browned it on the stove top, then cut it in half lengthwise and cut that into bite-sized pieces.  The spices in the homemade sausage really added to the flavor.  Also substituted Swiss chard greens for the kale, and really liked the flavor.

I've made it twice and it really is better than the restaurant version. It is well-suited for substitutions.  I use an Italian sausage so the soup has a reddish tint from the spices.  It's real comfort food.

My husband LOVES the zuppa Tuscani soup at Olive Garden, so I was thrilled when I found this recipe! I must say that I never followed it exactly. Instead, I made mine according to the changes recommended by Jobbly Man (thanks!) It was excellent! The second time I made it, my husband suggested we leave  out the bacon. It wasn't missed. This is a regular for us now!

My family enjoyed this meal. Even my kid who doesn't like soup said he could eat it, just isn't his favorite. However, that is better than refusing to eat it!!! I didn't use heavy cream to save on calories. We added a dollop of sour cream to make it seem creamier. Also used mild Italian sausage with gave it so much flavor. We will be making this again. I also cooked the sausage, onions, bacon ahead of time and added the rest of the ingredients to the slow cooker. Then added the bacon,sausage mix to the slow cooker and cooked on high for 3 hrs. I love my slow cooker for busy days!!

This is a really good soup recipe.  I did change a few things.  I used Trader Joe's organic low sodium chicken broth.  in place of water and bouillon.  for sodium reasons.  also used 1/3 cup bacon bits in place of the 6 slices of bacon.  also used 2 cups diced potatoes.  I used baby spinach in place of Kale since I had spinach on hand.  I changed out the heavy cream for half and half again because I didn't have heavy cream on hand.  It is a Great soup.  I served with a little Pecorino Romano cheese.  I will be making this again, and this time with kale, but will keep all the changes, because I liked it that way. Hubs loves the Olive Garden version , and says that this one is just like it except there is more meat. Thank you for Sharing this soup recipe!

AMAZING!!
I made a few very minor changes to this recipe. The biggest change was I bought ground italian sausage and just browned it myself. I didn't have any kale, so we used baby spinach instead. I will probably just use spinach every time since it turned out so good! i am not a fan of potatoe peelings, so mine were pealed. i also used 2 cubes of chicken bouillon. my husband LOVED this and is extremely excited to have an alternate to going to Olive Garden to get his favorite soup. i am sure this will be a very common request for dinner!

Excellent recipe that works well with your personal adjustments.  I used sweet Italian sausage and added no bacon because of fat and calories and also used fat free half and half instead of creme.  It was WONDERFUL!!  Soup is my favorite thing to make and I can't believe I just discovered this one.

I tried this recipe because my husband loves Zuppa Toscana from Olive Garden. I used Chicken Broth instead of the water/bouillon. The only thing that was a bit difficult was trying to separate the onion from the bacon which I ended out giving up and deciding to leave in. The soup turned out wonderful otherwise.

It was tasty, but in the future, I would cook the bacon separate from the onions.  I'm not a fan of limp bacon.

I love this recipe. Granted, I tend to use it more as a guideline than a rule, but it's a good, solid base. What do I do different? I add some fresh kale, bump the garlic (my family loves it), use homemade chicken stock, and add a little butter (about 3 Tbsp). I never have leftovers.

Yum! Completely agree with the other helpful reviews.  Just needs a little bit of tweaking. It's a bit too much cream (and I love cream) as compared to the restaraunt version so I'll cut it a bit next time.  Definitely use Kale instead of spinach.  The restaurant actually uses escarole so if you can find it then all the better! Fennel if you like it would also make it more authentic...the sausage I used had a little but not enough.  (Since I don't really care for fennel I didn't add any extra.)

Used hot turkey sausage, low sodium bacon, chicken broth instead of water/bouillon and fat-free half/half for cream.   Very good, only I might experiment with roasting the potatoes first before adding them to improve their taste.  Served with homemade focaccia from this site.

A family favorite... have made this many times.  We like our soup a little thicker so, I add a little cornstarch roux and extra potatos.  One time I was out of regular bacon and substituted turkey bacon.  I would not recommend doing this unless you are in a pinch.  The flavor was still there but I did not care for the texture.  The bacon was just too chewy.

I used 1 lb ground Italian sausage (browned), 2 tsp garlic, 5 medium red potatoes, 1 lb of bacon, 6 cups of chicken broth, 1 T. italian seasoning, 1 T. garlic powder, 1 T. onion powder, 2 tsp red pepper flakes, 2 cups of spinach, and 2 cups of half and half. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!

This was awesome!  I used chicken broth (6 cups) and had to substitute spinach for the kale since they were out at the grocery store.  I also used crumbled spicy Italian sausage because we like a little heat.  Yummo!  Now I have to find a recipe for bread sticks & salad from this favorite restaurant.

This recipe was phenomenal! I am a total beginner to cooking and it turned out great. The only change I made to the recipe and will do the next time I make it is to use a 16 oz package of italian sausage. The soup was thicker than the Olive Garden version so next time, I am going to make the following changes:  1. 2/3 the amount of Sausage and Bacon. 2. 3/4 Chicken Boullian 3. 2 times the amount of Kale. 4. Add some spices to get the itallian sausage kick. It needed to be a little bit more spicy and hot to hit the olive garden version in my opinion.   For those of you wanting to emulate Olive Garden, this recipe should definately be your starting point.

My family loves this soup! It is just delicious. To make it a little healthier we use double the kale and omit the bacon. Saute onions and garlic after draining the sausage (the sausage you use makes or breaks the soup - a nice spicy sausage with lots of flavor is good). I use a spicy Italian sausage and just brown in a skillet. If you like the Olive Garden soup, you will enjoy this recipe!

Absolutely yummy! Instead of smoked sausage I use hot italian sausage. Some may find this a bit too spicy for their liking, however, it's just perfect to me!

Amazing soup, and perfect with substitutions when you don't have certain ingredients. I've subbed broccoli and green pepper for kale, used flavored sausages in place of Italian, and added sour cream and milk in place of cream-- and it's always delicious! I always use chicken broth instead of water, and we serve with crusty bread for dipping. Thanks for the perfect winter soup recipe!

My favorite soup. I've made it many times. The only change I made was to use beef bouillon (its all I had). I read the reviews. I like to make my own changes to recipes as much as everyone but please try to make it according to the original recipe.  I don't know if people are buying the wrong sausage or purposely using a different kind. I get the smoked sausage that is in a ring. It is near the bacon in my grocery store. It looks like kielbasa. Hope that helps. Thanks Holly.

YUM YUM YUM!!! Changed the kale to frozen spinach due to avaiability in a rural area. This was a religous experience, truly! I actually felt good after eating which is new for me... must be a low GI dish. Will make again and again and again!!! Thanks!!!

Delish! Definitely needed a bit more garlic and more broth, though. I rinsed the sausage and blotted the bacon (which I microwaved). Also, crushed red pepper makes it legit. Great recipe!

I only gave this a 4 because you need to use italian sausage to get the right taste. I used the smoked and it just wasn't the same. But with the italian sausage it will be perfect!

I made this for my husband last night because he loves the one Olive Garden. Well he thought it tasted the same. I did add extra potatoes and used italian sausage like others suggested. Next time I might just double the recipe since my broth was a little low, but it was creamy, rich and delicious!

This soup was fantastic!  I used sweet Italian-flavored turkey sausage, which I removed from the skins, crumbled and browned in a frying pan, using the fat from the bacon.  And I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. Since the type of potato wasn't mentioned, I used 3 small red potatoes, left the skins on and sliced thinly.  I have been making this recipe almost weekly since I first tried it - I just can't get enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Holly.

Really good, I had been searching for this recipe since the Olive Garden left Canada.  I do cook the bacon separatly and drain well, I also put the Kale in and then simmer the soup without the cream for a much longer time otherwise the Kale is too tough for my liking.  Also buy Hot Italian sausage to give it that spicy taste.

This dish was a great-tasting one that I will serve again.  However, I did not feel that it tasted just like the one from olive garden.  I did change the smoked sausage to italian sausage and I added a lot of half-and-half to make it have a little more liquid.  This soup is very thick and hardy.  It is a meal-not a side dish.  I think you could half the amount of sausage and be just fine.  However, it tasted great and I was asked for the recipe by our guests.  I will definitely serve it again.  Thanks so much!

I was looking for zuppa toscana as prepared at Olive Garden.  This is as every bit as good if not better.  The bacon is the only difference I could tell but the bacon adds great flavor.  I used Emeril's sausage with sundried tomatoes.  Very delicious and flavorable.  Definitely will be a family favorite!

Very easy & great! It was a hit with everyone. After reading reviews on it, I: added more water, reduced bacon, added another potato, and just seasoned to taste. No leftovers here!!

I've made this soup for family and friends and all have enjoyed it. Unlike most reviewers I have stuck to the ingredients listed and prepared it as described. Recently though I noticed that the instructions changed for the bacon and onions. For those of us that follow the recipes faithfully there could be a little trouble. Previous instructions had the bacon cooked separately and some of the grease reserved to saute the onions and garlic. This works better then cooking the onions with the bacon and reduces the amount of grease fat in the soup.

My boyfriend and I loved It!!!!!!!!!!! Couldn't find italian sausage at my supermarket to save my life so after about 15 min of looking I just went ahead and went with an italian styled sausage which wasn't like the normail italian sausage you usually see but It was still amazing! I will definately be making this recipe in the future!

I do add more potatoes and brown the ground chicken sausage first. Rather than the heavy whipping cream the chef told me to add a quart of half and half instead. It's a wonderful filling soup, and so easy!!I make exactly the way the chef said and never tire of it!

First off- double it!!  =yummy so you want leftovers!! 

I like to cook the sausage sans casing in a skillet, it releases more flavor into the soup

I also try to do everything in one pot with the least mess, so this is how I prepare it:

-Remove the sausage from the casing and chop up the bacon raw

-Start at step 3, but cook the sausage with the bacon and onions

-skip step 4

Viola!  

Turns out awesome!

My family loved this recipe . I used bulk hot Italian sausage instead of the smoked sausage and  substituted chicken broth for the water. The end result was spicy (not to much) but I think the next time I will use both hot and mild sausage. Everyone who tried it thought it tasted much better than the local chain restaurant. - Paulie G.

This soup has a wonderful taste, but it's way too much sausage for the broth. I would suggest only using 1/2 or less of the sausage, more water or cream, another potatoe, and more kale. Also, you could do without the bacon or cut that back to 3 strips. I will make it again, but will try to make it less fatening with less meat and more kale and potatoes. Also, I think I would like it better with ground italian turkey sausage. The casing on the smoked sausage was very tough.

I love this recipe...so easy and quick to make.  Husband and son like it well enough, but the daughters can't get enough of it! My youngest daughter askes me to make it for her on a regular basis.  I made it for my eldest daughter when she had her baby,(kale is high in vitamin K which is good for post-partem moms)and she loved it.  She now makes it every few weeks for her family.  The best recipes are the ones that make you think of your Mommy or somebody else who cooked for you as a child.  This has become one of those recipes at our house.  Thank you!

My husband & I are soup-a-holics and loved this recipe.  I get tired of my recipe for Italian Sausage.  This is as easy to prepare and also has the rich flavor of a long cooked soup.  So far I have made it 3 times in past 5 weeks.  Only thing I did a little different was use red potatoes and left the skin on both for looks and added viamins.  Also added more chicken stock and less salt filled boullion.

This is a GREAT recipe! I gave it four stars because it was a bit salty so next time I will use half the amount of sausage. The zuppa Toscana soup at Olive Garden is my favorite and this comes real close! Thanks!

This recipe made enough for about no more than 5 med - large soup bowls.  I would double it for a large family or friends ( men ! ).  Usually it is just my immediate family but we had relatives over and I just barely had enough. It was my own fault I usually use another recipe that always gave me way more than I needed.   I've used many Zuppa recipe variations and this is my favorite.

Excellent!  I did use chicken stock in place of water and base and used spinach instead of kale as I had spinach that needed to be used.  Also used new potatoes instead of regular potatoes andI used 3 mild and 2 hot Italian sausages as that is what I had on hand and added a little bit of red pepper flakes.  This sounds like a lot of changes, but it really wasn't, it was only substitutes!  Oh, and I used a full cup of cream.  This soup was even great as left overs!  Can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe...

This was excellent! I used more bacon (maybe 10 slices to use it up) and 2 boxes of frozen kale. It seemed so thick, probably from the kale likely being more than the 2c so I added another cup of water and a little more bouillon powder. I doubt those changes would have affected the flavor much - we all loved it and we'll have this again!

I love this soup.  Tastes just like olive garden.  I left out the bacon, though (because who really needs bacon and sausage in the same soup) and just cooked the onions with some veg. oil.  I also used ground Italian sausage instead of smoked and cooked it in a skillet and drained.  I like mine with more potatoes.  The bouillon powder (or chicken broth) is so good because it makes the potatoes so flavorful.  Every time my in-laws come over they request that I make this soup!

I did not like this at all. I did not care for the texture of the basically raw kale in the soup. I think it would have been better if the kale was cooked prior to adding to the soup. Also, it was far too salty and there was not enough broth. I had to add double the amount of water and I picked the kale out to make this edible. I will not use this recipe again.

I needed a recipe for kale and being a big fan of soups I chose this one.  I didn't have all the ingredients but this recipe was easy to improvise.  I used a bag of diced potatoes and onions, added a little extra dried minced onion for good measure...used what I had left of chicken and beef broth (roughly 2 cups, didn't really measure), added 1 cup of white wine, and a little all purpose spice (cachere's sp?)...I let those ingredients simmer in the crockpot for 5 hours...when I got home from work I didn't like the brothy look and since I didn't have heavy whipping cream, I added a can of Cream of Celery soup to thicken (i also left out the bacon and water)...THEN, I added the kale and left to simmer for another hour while I made some jalapeno corn bread to go with it.  It was amazing!  Thanks for a great recipe that was easy to work with...next time I will try it as is...although, I do recommend the wine and the cream of celery.

My Cooking group, OurTableTalk dot com chose this recipe as our community cook along recipe for February and I'm glad we did!  I'm a soup lover to begin with and this is one of the best I've found.  Hearty and so many flavors going on.  I didn't change a thing and in my opinion it needs no changes. It was so delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

I've been making this recipe for years and we always enjoy it. I use canned chicken broth rather than the water and bouillon and I find Jimmy Dean's hot sausage adds flavor and a little bite. Served with some fresh baked bread sticks you'll think you are at the Olive Garden.

I didn't care for this at all.  It tasted like greasy meat in a flavorless milk broth.  Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

Very tasty, and yes, very much like the Olive Garden version. I enjoy using hot Italian sausage instead of smoked sausage. Be sure to drain your sausage thoroughly or the grease forms unsightly collections on the surface.

Loved it!  Great winter soup.  Used broth and doubled everything but the sausage.  Managed to sneak kale past one of two children!  Will try italian sausage next time for variation!

Really there's no need to head to Olive Garden every time you're after this soup. I've made this recipe a million times over and you just can't tell the difference in the taste. The great thing about making it at home, is that now that we're eating healthier, it's so easy to modify to fit that. I either leave out the bacon, or just use a few slices, use lo-fat milk instead of cream, and sometimes use 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground turkey. 
And FYI, whether you're making it exactly like the recipe or a lo-cal version, spinach is fabulous in place of kale and much easier to find!

tried this recipe and it worked out great. I found adding some fresh crispy cooked bacon at the time of serving worked really well. It was truly better with age.

Loved it. I added hot pepper flakes. I didn't use any bacon. I also browned the sausage with onion and garlic in a little bit of olive oil. I used a big can of chicken broth. Also used 11/2 cups of half and half.

Love this soup!  I use italian sausage to make it a little faster.  To spice it up a little I also add red pepper flakes to the sausage for a nice kick.  The last little addition I have is adding dryed basil for a little more flavor.  I will make this soup many times in the future.

this was good, but I had to make some revisions.  I had to use smoked turkey sausage as I didn't have raw sausage.  I ended up using more potatoes and I used less sausage than was called for, but that is probably the difference in the cooking down from the raw, and I used spinach.  I served this at an academy meeting.  No one knew me and I heard lots of positive comments on it. "This tastes like an olive garden soup"   It was a tasty soup, and I will make it again this time with raw sausage as the recipe called for, because I think that will make it even better.

For lack of sausage, I added twice the bacon and twice the kale. I also used buttermilk in place of heavy cream. It was Scrumtrulescent!!

Fantastic recipe!  Exactly like Olive Garden.  I didn't have bacon, so I made it without and used fat-free half and half to cut the fat and calories.  It was perfect and absolutely delicious.  I wish I doubled the recipe because it was a hit at the dinner table!!

Perfect version of a great restaurant soup.  I have shared this recipe with some fanatical fans of the version from the Olive Garden, and they rave about it.  This recipe even gets my son to eat some green food.

I tried this at Olive Garden and fell in love with it! I wanted to be able to make the same thing at home for a fraction of the price and found this recipe here. It is perfectly delicious! I didn't want all the fat of heavy whipping cream so I opted for a substitute of half and half. Maybe next time I will try whole milk or something similiar to cut back on the fat b/c you can't eat just one bowl of this soup! I also serve it with light garlic bread b/c my hubby likes to have a biut of a "filler" with it. So, I hope you enjoy this wonderfully simple soup!

Wonderful! I substituted as others suggested. I used smoked turkey, half & half, a pkg of frozen spinach, chicken broth, turkey bacon and doubled the yukon gold potatoes. I actually made it in the crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours (first cook potatoes in microwave so they will be tender)adding the bacon and half & half 30 minutes before it was finished. My husband loves it!!

This was a very good soup...I used ground Italian sausage, but I think next time I'll keep it in the casing and then slice into the soup.  I also used 6 baby red potaoes.  I simmered (without the cream and kale) for a couple of hours and really got the flavors happy and the potaoes nice and soft.  Then about 15 minutes before serving I added cream and kale.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This recipe has quickly become a family favorite!  It makes a delicious, hearty soup.  I substituted chicken broth for the bouillon and added extra potatoes.  The cream doesn't add much to the recipe -- it doesn't thicken the broth that much -- and I think next time I'll omit the cream (to save on calories) and maybe mash a bit of the potato to thicken the broth instead.

This was delicious.  I made it for Valentine's Day (it's my bf's fave from Olive Garden) along with Garlic Parmesan Breadsticks also from this site.  BF said it was "exactly right".  It took a little bit of time, but was fairly straightforward.  I tried to brown the Italian sausage with the bacon and onion, like some reviewers suggested, and had a hard time getting the bacon to crisp up at all (maybe because my pot was too small.)  But I still got the good bacon flavorings and found I didn't need to add any crumbled bacon after that.  Made with 5 skin-on red potatoes, 1 quart chicken broth and about 2 cups water (needed more liquid with some many potatoes).  Delish!

My husband makes a soup similiar to this, he uses mild and hot italian sausage, chicken broth, yukon gold potatoes, and half and half, and instead of Kale (which he used for a long time) he added cilantro one time, and we have had it that way ever since.

I used spinach instead of the kale and chcken stock in place of the soup base. I served this with French Country Bread and garlic butter both from this site. Hubby and daughter both requested this again. Thanks.

My husband enjoyed this recipe a little more than I did.  It was ok, but nothing spectacular that would make me want to make it again.  Just a matter of taste, I think...

Our family liked this recipe very much.  Even my 11 year old who doesn't like much. It would also be good with bratworst or grond breakfast sausage.  We used spinach instead of kale and it was delicious. We used 1 qt, chicken broth instead of water and bouillion.  and then added salt and pepper to taste. Yum!

I found this recipe years ago from a magazine.  It's a copy cat version of Olive Gardens.  Instead of bacon, I like to add proscuitto.  It gives a little different flavor than bacon.

This was so GREAT for a cold winter's night!  I actually made it a little simpler by cooking the sausage along with the onion and bacon and not taking out the bacon.  Plus I added a whole package of bacon too!  It was sooo GREAT!

I served this soup at my weekly "soup night" to family and friends.  It was a big hit.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I decreased the sausage by half and found the soup to be very substantial.  I also used Italian sausage and browned it in a skillet rather than the oven.  If you are serving more than four people, I would suggest doubling the recipe--it tastes great re-heated.

Excellent!!  I always order this when I am eating out at a popular restaurant so I was excited to find this recipe.  It tastes as good or better than the restaurant soup!  Also, it was very simple.  We couldn't find kale at the local supermarket so we substituted thawed spinach and it was still great.

I took this to a potluck dinner. I didn't put near the amount of kale in because I personally don't care much for it, but everyone loved it! Because I prefer a thicker consistency, I think I'll add some potato flakes or potato starch next time. Really a simple, tasty recipe though!

This rating is for the recipe as written. First of all smoked sausage isn’t Italian, use a medium or hot Italian sausage instead. Secondly, there isn’t enough broth so use increase the amount of chicken stock to whatever is enough for your family. The broth amount doesn’t matter a bit since you don’t add seasonings so there are no appropriate ratios necessary. Also, for those of you who don’t like kale, use it anyway, just let it cook down a little more and you won’t  taste the strong flavor. And finally, I used 2% milk the second time I made it and it wasn’t quite as silky BUT it was still very good.

I made this, and my family LOVED it! They said it was very close to Olive Gardens. I will definitely be making it every time it's cold outside.

Everyone loved this soup, including my young kids (although they did pick around the kale).  I used Italian turkey sausage and added some diced carrots and used chicken broth and less cream, but it was SO good!

Great recipe.  To go lighter I use 2% milk.  I added in some red bell pepper and red skin potatoes.  I think everyone likes to do their own thing with soups but of course this recipe with cream is the tastiest.

I used Bob Evans Hot and Spicy sausage instead and browned them on the stove.  I threw the bacon in the oven instead.  I threw the kale in the soup with potatoes since it is a tougher green.  It was delicious!

This soup is so delicious but I do  make a few changes.  I cut up the sausage in rounds (and half again per the receipe) but instead of baking it I fry them in the big pot that I am making the soup in (remove when cooked and put back later), then scrape the pot out to continue with the rest of the recipe.  I also cut the russet potatoes in cubes instead of slices (easier to eat).  I use more garlic probably 1 tablespoon and cook with the onion.  Instead of bouillon powder & water,  I use 2 litres of chicken or veg broth (unsalted).  And to save calories I used 250 ml of half and half cream.  I add the kale with the potatoes as it takes quite some time to cook.  I cut the kale into strips and then cut them a few times as I find the long strands are hard to eat.  The bacon I cook in strips and then cut up (as your garnish).  An excellent soup that we have regularly.  I haven't tried it yet but I bet you could easily substitute spinach for kale but what a great way to use your kale.

I used hot italian sausage removed from casings and fried.  Also used chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water.  It was very yummy and I have had a number of compliments!  Thanks for the recipe.  We love soup and this was not your run of the mill flavour.

GREAT base recipe.  I took the shortcut of subbing a box of dried scalloped potatoes.  Used the sauce mix packet to flavor the soup and add creaminess.  Flavored with white wine to taste at end.

I made this recipe two ways. I substituted chicken broth for the bouillon and substituted Italian sausage links for the smoked sausage, only using 1/2 pound. It tasted exactly like the Olive Garden version.

My favorite soup recipe. I use spinach instead of kale because I don't like kale. And fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. I've also used ham steak when I forgot to thaw out bacon. This is so good and can be adjusted to many preferences.

We loved this recipe.  I used parsley instead of kale.  And added a small can of tomato sauce to give it a a creamy tomato flavor.  Next time I would add more potatoes.

I omitted the bacon and used regular breakfast sausage (not as spicy but still nice smokey flavor). I also changed the liquid to 2c broth and 2c milk, rather than the heavy cream. My husband always orders the zuppa at Olive Garden and he was just as happy to eat this at home :)

Omg! My kid can't get her face out of the pot. I made ours low carb so I skipped the potatoes. Added kale and added fresh roasted broccoli, mushrooms and red bell pepper it came out amazing I planed on boxing it up and taking it to work with me but I'm pretty sure that will  the kid off  since she is homed schooled and will go looking for it herself at lunch time next week. :) guess I will have to make another Pop for my lunches. Thanks for the great recipe.

Change the bouillon to chicken stock, otherwise it is too overpoweringly salty.  I used kielbasa for my sausage because that's what I had on hand.  Turned out good.

This is a great soup and with this recipe I think this is better than all of garden I did change it up a little all the ingredients are the same but I cut the sausage into very small pieces and throw it into the stock pot at the start and bring to a boil. I don't drain or skim, I just leave it all in !

This was great! I substituted ground beef for sausage, no bacon and added spinach for kale and 2% milk at the end after mashing a few potatoes. Served it with Parmesan cheese and garlic bread. Yum!

Inspired by this recipe.  I changed the smoked sausage to Italian Mild, I replaced the Chicken Bouillon and water with Low Sodium Chicken Broth (about 42oz).  I browned the Italian sausage in a dutch oven, removed them, drained the dutch oven, added some saved bacon grease, fried the onions for 3 minutes, and garlic for 60 seconds.  I then added the broth and sausages.  Brought it to a boil then added the potatoes.  Let simmer for 45 minutes until the potatoes were done.  Added the crumpled bacon, kale,and about 1/2 cup cream.  Yum!

I love this soup, one of my favorites, have made it a few times.  Cook time is longer than listed.  Be careful not to cut potato too small as they will fall apart.  Pre time includes cooking bacon.   I prefer a spicy sausage instead of smoked, like andoille.  I found recipe needed much more water and kale.

I liked the Olive Garden version of this so gave it a try.  I cut up and browned my sausage first, cheated and used packaged bacon bits (probably less than 6 slices' worth), and added more kale than actually called for, but it was GREAT!  Even BETTER than OGs!Leftovers didn't last long enough!  I'm thinking of making an extra-large batch next time and freezing some for easy lunches.  Definite keeper, although I may try some of the other suggested tweaks later just for fun.

Absolutely awesome! I added more kale and a tad more cream, making it 1/2 c instead of 1/3. And I used hot italian sausage instead of the smoked type. It is so chock full of protein and fiber! Very filling with loads of flavor!

I have made this soup 4 times! I have it 3 stars because I did not think that smoked sausage was a good fit for this recipe. I replaced the smoked sausage with bulk Italian sausage and once with spicy Italian turkey sausage and they were both delicious !! I also added more kale and broth to mine. It taste so much better.

yes it was very good, except we are big soup eaters.  I added a second quart of water and another bouillion cube, also, next time I would add more potatoes and such, to make it a bit heartier.  We added extra spinach on top for those of us that love spinach because a cup for the whole pot was not enough for my husband and I. The soup had wonderful taste however, and everyone loved.  I added a half teaspoon of garlic and herb seasoning and we used turkey bacon and regular italian turkey sausage not smoked so that was good too as a substitute

I have to say I took this recipe and ran with what I had and it was delicious. I used homemade sweet Italian sausage, browned in a skillet with sweet onion. I used a quart and a half of chicken broth, fresh mushrooms and golden potatoes. I brought it to a boil then reduced heat to low and let it simmer. About half an hour before dinner, I added chopped fresh baby spinach and canned milk. Served with garlic cheddar bassy biscuits. Whole family loved it.

I made this recipe a while ago and loved it. It seem to be close to the large restaurant chain's soup. I only changed one thing and that was the sausage because I know that bulk sausage was used in the original recipe. I used hot Italian sausage and kept everything else the same and my family loved it. Thanks for the keeper.

Good soup and worth trying first following the recipe.  When I made it a second time, I did make some changes.  Instead of the packaged smoked sausage, I used a mild Italian Turkey sausage and removed it from the casing & browned.  I also fried the bacon in the oven, let it cool and then crumbled it into the soup when the potatoes were almost finished cooking.  I also believe I used spinach when I could not find kale that looked good.  The last two editions were to make the soup creamier.  So I increased the heavy cream to 1 c and also used a can of evaporated milk.  Enjoy!

This is a fantastic recipe. Easy to make and so good. I am going to try spinach next time as the kale was not as tender as I would have like it to be.

Very good copy of the Olive Garden favorite.  I definietly would use more kale, or even substitue spinach if you don't want to use kale.  I also used bulk italian sausage browned, which was much quicker.

I added a little more water and cream to make this more soupy and cayenne and black pepper.  It turned out really well and not salty at all.  Also, I cooked Italian sausage on the stove!

My family loves this soup; after having it at The Olive Garden years ago I was excited to find it and make it at home.  I skipped the bacon this time trying to make it healthier and I'm thinking about trying turkey sausage next time.. Really great!

AMAZING recipe!!! Wow, so delicious.  We used sodium FREE chicken bouillon and would have never known.  It seriously did not effect the amazing taste and would highly recommend not consuming all that sodium if you cant even tell.  Sooo good!

I substituted italian bulk sausage for the smoked sausage, because that's what I had.  I used extra garlic, 5 small white potatoes, and a box of swansons chicken broth and substituted evaporated milk for the cream.  I didn't think the bacon really added too much to this so next time I will make it without.  I was very surprised that my 5 year old said the kale was her favorite part of the soup, as she is a very fussy eater.

I loved this soup, but should have read the reviews because there was way too much sausage (would have been a 5* with that adustment) and should have halfed it.  Otherwise it was great and I used mild italian sausage b/c that's what I had on hand and will up the kale to 3 cups next time.

I have never had this at Olive Garden but this was very good! Four stars only because I had to make some changes to make it a little healthier for me... I used Turkey Kielbasa sausage, a 3 bacon slices and no-fat half and half (I will forever be indebted to the reviewer who suggested that -- I had no idea no-fat half and half existed!!). I also threw in 1/2c of orzo when I added the potatoes (I actually used sweet potatoes since I like them better and their nutritional content is higher than normal ones) just because I wanted something a little extra in there. I found it a little bit too salty with the bouillon but I may just have to buy reduced fat bouillon. I also added a little pepper and cayenne pepper before eating, since I like things with a bit of a kick!

This soup is a huge hit with my hubby! He's constantly asking me to make it! Instead of using russet potatoes, i use 5 small red potatoes, skin on. It gives it a smoother consistency i think. I'v made it without bacon, i didn't have any on hand, and it still turned out delicious! Thank you so much for sharing! Awesome comfort food, especially when you're pregnant, like me! :)

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I've cooked this two ways. One, as written, and two, with Italian sausage instead of smoked. The Italian sausage made it WAY better. But other than that, great recipe.

The first time I made this it was good but not great. The second time I used Italian sausage, browned not baked, and added a couple cloves of minced garlic. I also substituted baby spinach for the kale. We like it much better prepared this way.

So delish and so easy to make! I have made this several times and people always ask for the recipe. Perfect for the crock pot. My family and I prefer spinach to kale in this recipe.

This is my absolute favorite soup at Olive Garden, so I was very excited to find this recipe. It did not disappoint. I found it to taste just as good as the original. A friend recommended I leave out the bacon as she has made this recipe as well and found that it was just as flavorful without it and not as greasy so I made it this way. The sausage did gave it enough flavor and I even found breadsticks in the bread aisle just like the ones from Olive Garden! I brushed some melted butter and garlic salt on them and baked them for 5 minutes and they tasted like the real thing. This has been a repeat in our house and tonight I think I'm going to try it with spinach instead of Kale.

Delic! Made with no bacon (I don't taste bacon in the one I like when I eat out) and a little more kale and garlic.  Half the water used.

Wonderful flavor! I used 2 hot italian sausage and 2 sweet italian sausage, I think next time I will use 4 of each as there just didnt seem to be enough meat. However it still came out very tasty and just as good as Olive Gardens. Great Recipe!

Great soup for those cooler winter nights. One of those dishes that the leftovers are even better than the night cooked. I changed a few ingredients to put my own twist on the recipe. I used "hot" ground sausage (cause I like my stuff spicy), and I used evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream for a healthier alternative. Served with buttered roles. DELICIOUS!

I liked the flavor of this recipe, and followed it exactly, but would recommend adding more potato.  I would also save the bacon to sprinkle on top just before serving to keep it from getting soggy.

I changed it up to make it a little lighter after making it according to the recipe the first time.  I used turkey sausage patties (browned), veggie boullion (fat free! but all the taste of chicken boullion), half and half instead of cream. No bacon. Tastes amazing both ways.  Lighter version means I can incorporate it into my week with less guilt.

One of my favorites!  I love the OG version but am not the biggest fan of kale, so I substituted spinach for the Kale.  I might do 1/2 and 1/2 next time.  Also used fat free Half&Half instead of cream and used 1/2 spicy and 1/2 mild sausage with the casings removed and crumbled.  This soup needed additional spices (I love spices) so I added a tbsp of "Italian Seasoning" blend to kick it up a notch.  My zuppa stayed a watery consistency so I added 2 more potatos and it was perfecto!  

I've got my own wine, french bread and salad so I don't need to go to OG anymore to enjoy this delight at half the price!

This was pretty good. I loved it, but my husband wasn't as excited. I used 1 lb ground italian sausage. Also substitued spinach for kale. Used chicken broth instead of boullion and water. Increased cream to 1/2 cup. It just didn't seem like there was much broth, in my opinion.

Very yummy flavor.  We loved this soup, even my six yo daughter who never likes soup.  I didn't have italian saugage so I subbed chicken sausage.  I also didn't have cream so I subbed whole milk and sour cream as per previous poster.  I also added celery and only used 2 slices of bacon.  Very, very good and a definite repeat recipe!!!  I can't wait to try it with the real ingredients.

My husband and I ate lunch at the Olive Garden yesterday.  We had not been there in a long time, and remembered this soup.  It was very good, but I knew allrecipes would have a recipe just as good as their bowl for $5.95!  I followed this recipe except for adding more red pepper.  Hubby ate 2 bowls and said it was "better" than the restaurant!!

THIS RECIPE IS GREAT!  I have actually made it myself.  But for all, (like me), who could not find the sausage links at the store, you can substitue italian sausauge.  Just cook it like normal and add it in when the recipe calls for it.  It makes it a little spicy, but it works.  Its very easy as well.  Everyone should try it.

I made this reipe this weekend thinking I'd be the only one eating it.  My daughter had a sleep over and the girls demololished this soup.  They were even asking for it at breakfeast! My twist were ground itallian sausage, two slices of bacon and new potatoes vs. russet. New potatoes allow for a creamier taste. I also used fresh spinach instead of kale.

I had never had (or knew about) the Olive Garden soup when I found this recipe. I'm curious to try it now because I love this recipe! I add a little more kale and a few spices, but pretty much follow the recipe and everyone I serve it to raves.

I was happy to find this recipe on this site because I love this soup!  I did change a few thing to my taste.  I sliced 5 potatoes instead of two, used 8 cubes of chicken bouillon instead of the soup base and used 2 quarts of water instead of one.  I also browned the bacon separately and only used three slices.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

This recipe is great! I made it for my family and they all loved it. They actually like it better than Olive Garden's version. I used hot Italian sausage and cooked it over the stove instead of baking it. I used lots and lots of kale also. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

made some changes - used Sweet Italian sausage sauteed with the onion in bacon drippings. Used fresh red potatoes -skins and all, mashed lightly after cooking until soft. I added fat free milk instead of cream and used bay leaf while cooking. With these changes it tasted just like the Olive Garden version.

Had a party and made this recipe.  It was a hit!! Doubled the recipe and used Italian sausage instead of the smoked sausage and chicken broth instead of the bouillion.  I cooked the bacon alone and just used enough of the grease to saute the onions. Everyone just loved it!  My husband actually even said he thought it was the best thing I ever made. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I followed other suggestions to reduce the sausage. I did not want to heat the house during the summer so I sauteed the sausage in the pan after the bacon, onion and garlic. I also doubled the kale. Overall an excellent soup. I'll definately make it again!

This recipe was SO GOOD. A little rich and heavy for spring/summer, but deliscious.

I made this with vegetarian Italian sausage and veggie bacon and it was great.
