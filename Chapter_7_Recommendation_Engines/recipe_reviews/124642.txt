This is a delicious recipe and I predict it will become your "go-to" recipe. It's become mine. For those that don't want to read further here are four suggestions: 1) make a day ahead, 2) cook the bacon by itself first 3) reduce sugar; eliminate white sugar entirely and use the suggested amount of brown sugar plus about half as much more, or to taste and 4)use a slow cooker on low for 4 hours. 

That said, I'm a big believer in following a recipe exactly the first time. The recipe says to cook the meat, bacon and onions all together. Doing this resulted in bacon with a texture that wasn't appealing to me. My son thought they were really good in spite of this, though. By the second day, I had to agree. 

Still, even though it's a five-star dish as-written, my preference is for the bacon to be a bit more "crisped." So, my recommendation is that you cook the bacon by itself.  The second time I made this, I cooked the bacon until it started to turn brown and crisp (not super-crispy like you'd put on a salad) and then I removed it to a bowl.  I drained most of the fat and then added the hamburger and onions and cooked those together. I added the bacon back in just as the hamburger and onions were finishing up and sauted another few minutes.

I finished the dish as directed except for reducing the sugar (and using all brown sugar). I served the beans the next day.  I've made this dish for three family bbq's now and it's a smashing success.  Thanks for sharing this one!!!

Good recipe. TWO things: one cook your bacon first. and TWO adding all that sugar will make them too sweet. I added half and it was more than emough. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe with just a couple of modifications.  I used a full pound of ground beef, and carefully trimmed some bacon ends and pieces before frying them to a crisp. Because of the extra meat, I added another can of beans (try butter beans, they add a very nice shape & texture), and some extra BBQ sauce and ketchup. I thought the chili powder was a nice touch.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is a staple in our house, and am finally reviewing it!  Needless to say, it's pretty darn wonderful and very forgiving.  I usually prepare the bacon very crispy and add as the last item.  In place of the 1/3 cup of sugar, I substitute molasses syrup and up the chili powder to 1 tsp.  Absolutely melts in your mouth.  My thanks to Kathy for your submission!

I did not use the bacon or hamburger in this recipe as I simply wanted baked beans.  I did not add the white sugar and thought they were plenty sweet.  Everyone thought they were wonderful.  I think the variety of beans give it a nice presentation.

These are Amazing Beans! And I know a good baked bean recipe when I taste one.
I get rave reviews everywere I take these. Instead of a can of pork and beans I use a 28 oz can of bushs baked beans and I replace the kidney beans with pinto, I also use turkey bacon and extra lean ground turkey. AMAZING I can eat the whole dish by myself!

This is one of the best baked beans recipes I've tried and probably the one I will stick with. If you like a sweet BBQ taste to your baked beans, you'll love this recipe. The only modifications I made were to fry the bacon first for a firmer texture, and to split the meat between ground beef and ground pork sausage. Instead of baking, I let it simmer on the stovetop. Very simple, very good.

I made this whole dish in my cast iron skillet. I browned the ground beef first, then cooked the bacon. I drained most of the fat off of the bacon, leaving a couple tablespoons to saute the onion and a little fresh minced garlic before adding the other ingredients. The boys LOVED these baked beans.

Excellent. These are so good. I was not paying attention to all the ingredients and accidently left out the chili powder and pepper but it didn't matter because it was still great. I will definately make these again.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the past 3 weeks, my 3 teen boys and their friends just rave that these are the best baked beans they've ever had.  I used the exact recipe, but doubled it so we would have leftovers!

Yummy!!  I was looking for something quick to fix for dinner and this was a complete meal.  I did make a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. Instead of barbeque sauce I added more brown sugar, ketchup, mustard and added some redwine vinegar, and 1/2 tsp liquid smoke.  I also added a can of drained niblet corn and instead of kidney beans I added chili beans.  I also left out the white sugar.  I thought it was a terrific variation to everyday baked beans.

This was a nice dish accompanying our cookout and we received compliments.  However, the next time I'm omitting the ground beef from the recipe.  Sweetened beef just didn't taste right.

Very tasty. If you are usuing dried beans, make sure you cook the beans first then season with the sauce or else your beans will continue to be hard even after 4 hours on high. Made in the crockpot.

These beans completely outshine anything that I have had before.  Everyone loved them, especially my kids.  Like others, I precooked the bacon and I left out the ground beef to make it more of a side dish.  I cooked them in a crock pot.  The only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 was that I didn't like the pork and beans.  I first started these cooking without the pork and beans, since I didn't have any.  The flavor was awesome!  But I wanted to follow the recipe, so I got a can and added it.  I think it really took away from the amazing flavor the beans had before, so next time I will leave them out.  But this will be a summertime staple, for sure!  **Update: I tried these in the oven, and they were very dry and hard.  The flavor was good, but texture was chewy.  I will crock pot from now on!

Adding 6/9/16- I make these all the time and is the recipe that everyone asks me to bring to potlucks.  I usually make it the night before in the crock pot and let it sit overnight.  Everyone always loves it and it's super easy.  I also ALWAYS double it.  otherwise there would never be enough.  I also don't put in the sugar and it's always good.  I usually add a bit of Worcestershire too. 




Great recipe.  Will definitely make again.  I used 1lb bacon and no hamburger.  I didn't have great Northern beans so I used 1 can of kidney, 1 can of pork & beans, 1 can of white beans, and 1 can of pinto beans.  I put it in the crock pot on high for a couple hours then low.  Everyone loved it.

I made this for 4th of July celebration and I had one guy come up to me and say "those are the best beans I've ever had."  Later his wife said, "He hates lima beans, but he loved them so much he didn't even pick them out!".  I used frozen baby lima beans and this will definitely be my new go to baked bean recipe from now on.

I've made this with bacon and without; used ground beef and ground turkey. Either way, it's delicious and the whole family loves it.

Wonderful!  These are VERY similar to "mountain man beans"...as we know them here in the rocky mountains. These are traditionally prepared in a cast iron/dutch oven or a kettle over the camp-fire.  To make them taste a bit more like the beans I have eaten at countless mountain man rendezvous I made the following changes:

1. Fry 1/2 lb. bacon alone first set aside. 2. Add garlic to the onions...sweat...then add 1 lb. (not 1/2 lb.) ground beef/bison/sausage (whatever you have or a mixture if you wish).  When ground meat is about 1/2 cooked add bacon (with grease) and add 1+ Tablespoon of a mexican blend or taco mix instead of chili powder & black pepper.  Cook until meat is fully browned (then drain off all grease).  Used 1 (16 oz) can pinto; 1 (16 oz) can butter beans; 1 (16 oz) can great northern beans; 1 (16 oz) can Bush's baked beans...do not drain them!  Use only 1/3 cup of brown sugar (skip the white sugar esp. if you are using a pretty sweet BBQ sauce or unless you prefer sweet to savory beans).I also added a good amount of dried sage (in the old days sage was used in everything because it was so readily available). I also added some left-over corn which  gave it a nice crunch. Once thoroughly mixed and cooking (I simmered on the stove), add a small splash of liquid smoke to give it that cooked on the camp-fire flavor. Fantastic! Will be making this again & again!

This is fantastic once you make three changes. Fry the bacon until crisp before adding the beef and onions. Second, skip the white sugar. You can add it later if you want the beans sweeter. Finally, double the ketchup, bbq sauce, mustard, pepper, and chili powder. You really need to do this for flavor and because once you drain two of the beans, there's not much sauce if you don't. Thank you so much for providing this recipe! I made it on Father's Day and it disappeared.

We've had pretty much this same baked bean recipe in our family for YEARS. The only thing I did differently was to cook my bacon and break on top of beans before baking (cook the hamburger in some of the bacon fat) and I use only pork and beans and pinto beans and omit the white sugar.  Such an outstanding recipe to serve with bbq ribs/bbq chicken or hamburgers.

Made this yesterday.  I would rate it a five, but did change it.  I added two jalapenos, a sprinkling of red pepper flakes instead of black pepper, Left the white sugar out completely and next time will cut down on the brown sugar.  I cooked the bacon, drained the grease, then added the rest of the ingredients.  Very good dish.  My hubby loved it.  I'm sure it is just as good as is, but we like spicy.  Next time I think I will add shredded cheese to it.

Wow, great!  I made it as written, except that I omitted the white sugar based on all the reviews, and it was plenty sweet.  I may even do 1/4 cup of brown sugar next time.  And there will definitely be a next time!  I used a smoked bacon from Trader Joe's, and my husband and I loved it.  The kids... notsomuch.  Oh well!  They'll come around!

My husband really liked this recipe. I followed the suggestion of just using brown sugar and eliminating the white sugar. I also chopped up some leftover hot dogs and sausage meat that I wanted to use up. I used the crock pot for cooking it. This is probably the best baked bean recipe that I have tried.

I have had this recipe forever in an old Taste of Home magazine, but never made it until I saw it here on Allrecipes.  It was a huge hit!  I made it exactly as directed and it was a huge hit at the party we went to.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was ok. I wanted to make it bc it had such good reveiws but I wasn't "wowed". I didn't make it with hamburger meat and I took the suggestion of some other reveiwers and fried the bacon first, took it out, drained off about half off the grease, then cooked the onions in the grease. I also only added the 1/3 cup of brown sugar and the dish was bordering on too sweet so I 'm glad I didn't add the full amount! Overall, it was a good dish but really nothing to rave about.

The best baked beans I have ever eaten!  Unlike many other reviewers, I have never liked beans with shards of crispy bacon hiding in them, so I cooked the bacon with the onion and beef as per the recipe and it turned out just to my liking!  I guess it's a matter of personal preference.  I wanted to eat a huge bowl of it with bread for a whole meal, but hubby thought that was going a little overboard!  I will never make baked beans any other way again!

My family loved this dish! I skipped the pork and beans, subbed in another can of kidney beans. Added some extra bbq sauce. Used 1 tablespoon of molasses instead of white sugar. And used 4 slices of bacon and the onion, with no ground beef. It was delicious! :)

The way to make this a 5 star recipe is to cut back on the sugar.  I used only half of the white sugar and it was still a little too sweet.  Next time I will cut back even more. I also took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the bacon seperately, which turned out to be a great idea.

My regular recipe calls for molasses instead of white sugar and since I was out of molasses I ran to Allrecipes and found this.  This recipe is delicious.  Since I'm used to the sweetness of molasses I added a squirt of honey in addition to the recipe ingredients.

Amazing....had no groud beef so I used a full pound of bacon instead cooked with vidalia onion. (Nothing better then the smell of bacon and onions cooking together!)....Used 3 cans of pork and beans and 1 can of drained rinsed dark red kidney beans. Omitted the regular sugar as I saw no need for it....but kept the brown sugar and all other spices and condiments the same. Fantastic beans! Rich and very flavorful. Got rave reviews on Mother's Day....thanks!

This was my first time ever making beans and they turned out amazing! I ommited the sugar and just used the brown sugar. Also, I refrigerated it over night so the flavors could soak in. And cooked it in the crock pot on low for a couple hours the next morning. Definitely recommend!

Awesome recipe! We did not have ground meat, so used bacon only. Also took advice from other reviewers and used 1/2 cup brown sugar. I had a can of pinto beans on hand and used those instead of kidney beans. After eating these, I don't ever want canned baked beans again! Excellent flavor!

I love these. I'm the only one in my family that like sweet beans and this hit the spot.. I changed some things though. I used ham concentrate instead of bacon and dry kidney beans that I cooked in my crock pot first. I also left out the white sugar. I had to double the chili powder though because I couldn't taste it at all. I then cooked the meat with all the fixings and threw it all in the crock pot with the drained beans. I let it cook for about a half hour then put it in the fridge for the next day.

Yummy, stick to your ribs goodness... a good way to stretch a pound of beef and make a hearty meal or side dish.  I use a full pound of beef and an extra can of kidney beans to make two dinners for my husband with leftovers to freeze.

This is a great recipe, feel free to experiment with different kinds of beans. I use all brown sugar instead of white. I cooked mine in the crockpot, works just as well, for about 4 hours then it minimizes the attention it needs. Enjoy.. Happy July 4th.

I was hesitant about baked beans with ground beef, never had them before but I trusted the ratings (and the suggestions) and I'm glad I did. These were the best, tastiest baked beans. I actually said Wow! after tasting. We left out the white sugar. They were plenty sweet without it. 5 stars

FANTASTIC DISH! I also cooked the bacon firs...gave it better texture. Instead of white sugar, I used 4 T. of molasses. Added  a tablespoon of liquid smoke, too. Now, my family requests this dish for cookouts. Even my youngest daughter who WILL NOT touch beans tried it, and said it was good! We all love it!

i made a number of changes to this recipe, but enjoyed it as somewhere to get me started.  what i wanted was to make homemade baked beans. My husband really liked to flavor so that is my basis for suggesting you try this one.  here's what i did, you can take it or leave it:  1) Soak about 30 oz dried beans overnight according to instructions on package (you can use any kind or kinds that you like; i used about 10 oz. each of great northern beans, pinto beans, and black eyed peas)  2) The next day, cook 1/2 lb of bacon till very crispy and remove from pan.  cook up 1 medium onion in bacon drippings.  3) Put bacon (cut into small bits), onion, rinsed beans, 2/3 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup ketchup, 1 cup barbeque sauce, 1 TB dried mustard, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp chili powder, and 1 cup water into slowcooker.  4) Cook in slowcooker for at least 6 hours, checking halfway through to add additional liquid if desired.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was not what I expected. Very, very sweet! From the description I expected beans that could be a main dish, perhaps with some cornbread - but this is a dish I would serve as a side, just a little as it's just too sweet. I doubt I would make it again, but if I did, I would cut way back on the sugar & BBQ sauce. Disappointing.

Excellent and easy. My friend said it made her nostalgic because it was the same as her grandma's.  Kids ate it, too. Oh, my 11 year old made most of the recipe on his own!

This dish turned out awesome.  I made two changes to the recipe, leaving out the white sugar, but adding another 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and I replaced the ground beef with Jimmy Dean sausage.  I also cooked the bacon until crisp before adding.   I baked the beans 1 hour then let them chill overnight.  The next day I put them in the smoker for about 2 hours.  The flavor really improved in the smoker.

Wow, what a dish! Followed the recipe with following exceptions: followed others' suggestion to cook up the bacon separately. Couldn't find "White Northern" beans so I used "Roma" - they were great. Did it in the Crock Pot over 4hrs on low. Used x2 cans of baked beans with molasas. Used 1 TBSP of molasas instead of white sugar. ALMOST as good as my ol' man's home baked beans from scratch!

First time ever making baked beans and they are YUMMY!!!  Ate it with Amish Bread.  I doubled the meat, left out the white sugar, and doubled the BBQ Sauce.  Instead of Great Northern Beans, I used 32 ounces pinto beans.  I also, cooked the bacon and crumbled it.  Didn't add it to the mix, until last.  I used a crock pot, cooked high for 2 hours, then low for 4 hours.  Wonderful recipe, can't wait for our next potluck at work.  I will serve this with Amish Bread.

I wouldn't call this a spicy dish unless you use spicy BBQ sauce. My kids loved it. We took it camping and found the flavor even better when reheated the second day. If you use a dutch oven, it's a one dish meal! I read somewhere to add a pinch of baking soda to beans to cut down on their side effects so I did this but that's the only change I made.

browned meat/bacon/onion in pan, added all ingredients to slow cooker.  After tasting it I decided to add another 1/4 cup more of ketchup and bbq sauce.  For you canadians, I used President Choice Beer & Chipotole bbq sauce, yummy. The whole family liked it.  Next time I will also try using turkey bacon and ground turkey to really cut down on the fat content.  Thanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

Just made this for a potluck/chili contest at work.  There were seven other "chili's" and this one won hands down in both categories.  DELISH!  It will be my "chill" recipe from now on.

Beyond awesome! Had to quiet the clan as they were squealing and jumping up & down when momentarily not scarfing it down. This recipe is 5* as written but I made a few minor changes: (i) 1/2 lb. ground pork for beef, (ii) omitted white sugar (used 1/3 cup brown but will cut back next go round as Sweet Baby Ray’s Honey Barbeque Sauce is quite sweet), (iii) 1 heaping tablespoon Taco Seasoning (from this site) & 1 teaspoon dried sage instead of pepper & chili powder, and (iv) 5 tiny red peppers, unseeded & thinly sliced (home grown by friend). Fried bacon separately, and then added it back after half-cooking the meat mixture. Home run for Kathy S.

I took these to a cookout where there were four baked beans dishes.  This one was definitely not the best one there but it was the most different.  The best one had a predominant bell pepper flavor.  I left out all of the white sugar and it was plenty sweet enough.  I also left out half of the great northern beans and it was still thicker than I would have liked.  I tried it before baking and ended up adding cayenne, hot sauce, and chipotle sauce.  Not enough, though, because it still lacked any spicy flavor.  I was afraid to add too much but I wish I had added more.  Good but not great.

I used this recipe as a base to make vegetarian baked beans.  I left out the meat and cooked 1.5 pounds of dried navy beans in a pressure cooker.  I doubled the other ingredients and used my large crockpot on low.  I was worried that they wouldn't cook down and be too runny, but they turned out delicious!

Bottom line, strangers from the potluck were seeking me out to compliment my beans!  I am not a baked bean fan myself, but a friend made these beans at a potluck and everyone raved (I didn't try them, I only heard about the raves afterward).  So I got the recipe and made them for a 40-person potluck party.  I fried the hamburger and onion together (less onion than recipe called for).  I fried the bacon separate.  Then I followed the recipe exactly, but put it all together in a crockpot and refrigerated over night.  The next morning, I fired up the crock pot on high for the first three hours, then low, then warm.  I have NEVER had SO MANY people raving about a dish before!!!  For this amount of people, I tripled the ingredients (but the meats I only doubled and only used one whole medium onion).

These beat the average baked beans, though mine came out a little dry, the flavor was wonderful.  I also agree with other recommendations to fry the bacon seperately so it cooks thoroughly.

Though I really enjoy baked beans I have never had the thought to make them myself. I suppose I was skeptical that I would not find a recipe that would be as good as what I get in my fave BBQ restaurant so I never endeavored to make the attempt.  This recipe is in a word, fantastic.  It speaks to everything I would want a baked bean dish to be. I know that this will be something I make time and time again.  Stop reading this and make your beans, seriously - get going!

The best baked beans ever!  The only changes I make are to leave out the ground beef (only because I serve it with brisket), no white sugar and add another can of white beans to replace the ground beef.  Sometimes I add a couple of shakes of Smoked Chipotle Tabasco sauce and a dash or two of chipotle chili powder.  YUM! YUM!

Amazing! My hubby doesn't like kidney beans so when I doubled this recipe for a BBQ I only added half the kidney beans needed.  Everyone loved it!  The hardest part (which was still easy) was cooking the bacon, onions, and beef, which I did separately (not on purpose) and it still turned out wonderful.

I've made a slightly different version of this bean dish for many years.  This recipe is superior and is all I make now.  We do a lot of camping with family and friends and this always dish is always requested.  YUMMY!

It's a delicious sweet chili, basically. I loved it, as did others. Recommendations: only use 2 cans of beans...that's plenty. I prefer pork and beans/kidney beans. Also, omit the white sugar completely. No need to add any more sugar than the brown sugar recommended. Cook the bacon beforehand in a broiler, flipping once to get both sides crispy. Finally, place in oven or slow cooker. I used the slow cooker for about 4 hours and it was perfect!

Loved this recipe, my husband asked if I saved this one.  Made first pot without the meat as didn't have any and it was great then second time made with meat but added 1/2 Chorizo to add a little heat.  It is now in my recipes box.

Totally awesome. Made these for a family reunion and they were completely gone. Next time, I'm adding a green pepper just cause I like it. I saw other reviews that said to cook the bacon separately and that seemed to work well for me. Rave reviews from my family.

I've never made baked beans before, but these turned out fabulous! I made them for my son's grad bbq so adusted amounts to serve 25, and they still turned out great-many compliments! The only adjustment made was substituted brown sugar for white, and made it in a 7 quart crock pot on low all day. I have since prepared as a 'meal', so easy and delicous!

MMMMMMMMMMMMM! These are so nice and thick. Easy to handle on a plate with a hot dog or burger. I had 3/4 pounds of burger so that's what I used. I think it was just about the right amount to be honest. We liked these a lot.

The perfect baked bean recipe! The kids ate seconds and my husband loved it. This will be "the" one from now on. So easy to prepare. Like most, I substituted molasses for the white sugar. I skimped on the bacon (didn't have much on hand) and was also short a can of pork and beans but it was still terrific!

Incredible recipe! I made it as written, except that I cooked the bacon separately and added the beans with everything else. I made 48 servings, which fit perfectly in a large crockpot. The flavor of the beans was incredible, many of my guests said they were the best beans they have ever eaten. I had about one cup left at the end of our party, which my daughter squirreled away.

I suggest cooking your bacon and onions together or your hamburger and onions but not all three at once. Made with pinto and great northern beans.  I only used the brown sugar and added one tbsp. of mollasses like someone else suggested. Leftovers very tasty cold, too!

Oh my gosh, these are SOOOO good!  I made them this weekend, and EVERYONE loved them!  My BF who doesn't even like baked beans even loved them!  They are good hot, or cold!  Just a delish recipe!  You can sub out whatever beans you like, I just used some that I had on hand (pinto, black, and kidney) and really any kind of pork & bean/bbq baked beans will be fine too!

Awesome stuff with some additions. I omitted the 1/3 cup of white sugar and I did not have any chili powder. I also added a drained can of butter beans and green beans to make it more like a 5 bean salad my mom used to make. Got rave reviews at my cookout. Thanks!

Yummy!! I used a whole pound of ground beef, which made it extra hearty! We had these for a one dish supper last night, and got more than enough to eat. My husband was very impressed and wanted me to send the leftovers with him in his lunch.

Just "heat through" and serve. I put it in a slow cooker too long probably, the sugar caramelized and burned a little. My wife liked it, she never eats beans

Just made this for the first time. It is so good we had to force ourselves to stop eating - I was on my 3rd serving. I think this will be a regular dish around here. The flavors mix so well it is tasty & AWESOME!

Great recipe.  I added in Italian sausage - added a little kick. It was even better the second day.

This was fantastic. I used 1 lb 96% ground beef & left out the bacon. Left out the white sugar & used 1/3 C. brown sugar but it came out very sweet so next time I'll lower it to 1/4 C. Used Bush's Baked Beans instead of pork & beans. I meant to add a dash of liquid smoke but forgot so I'll be sure to add it next time. This was a great main course with cornbread on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

This is super sweet!  No heat at all. So disappointing after seeing a five star rating.  If you like sweet meaty beans, then you will love this.  If you like a bean soup or bean stew then this is NOT FOR YOU.  I had to smother with hot sauce just to distract myself from the sweetness.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using all brown sugar because that's all I had on hand, and I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for several hours. I tried it with half the sugar per other reviewers, but did not think it was sweet enough for our taste until I added the amount of sugar specified in the recipe. It's sweet, but oh so good. Fantastic recipe. Hands down the best baked bean recipe I've used. Thanks!!

This was great! Hubby and I went to an out-of-state fishing tournament so I made this a few days before we left, froze it, and thawed it a day before I heated it up in a big pot on a Coleman stove while out fishing.  Since I do not like bacon, I cooked up 1 pound of boneless pork chops and then cut them into bite size pieces with the beans.  We truly had pork and beans for our meal and my hubby's fishing partner loved it too!  Will make again.

These beans are wonderful. They were a little too sweet, so reducing the sugar is possible without compromising taste. I didn't have bacon so I reluctantly used a handful of imitation bacon bits, and it came out very good. I think using real bacon would have been much better, and will do so next time. I used them as a side dish, but I think in a pinch it could serve as a main course.

Great recipe!  I substituted the ground beef with 3 Sweet Italian Sausages.  I cubed them and added them before placing the beans in the oven.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half.  Possibly leave out the white sugar all together.

These recipe is awesome.  I made these for a party and they were a bit hit.  I did make one change and eliminate the 1/3 cup of sugar.  I figured with the  brown sugar that is enough sugar and I didn't want them to be too sweet.  They were perfect.  

The only other change I would recommend is to cook the bacon first than add the beef and onion when the bacon is cooked most of the way through, otherwise you're left with fatty bacon.  I don't like fatty bacon, as I like it crisp.  You can't go wrong with this tasty recipe.

Good recipe, but too sweet. I didn't even use the whole 1/3 cup sugar and it was still too sweet. Next time I will add molasses and no white sugar :)

This has always been a 4+ and a hit at parties. It became a 5 star when I made a double batch for a big party.  I tried to stretch it just a bit more to feed everyone by adding a can of Bush's Grillin' Beans Pit BBQ flavor.  What a great result!  It was even more flavorful.  You could probably get a similar result from increasing the BBQ sauce in the recipe.  I also used Bush's baked beans instead of pork and beans, since it was on a 2 for 1 sale.  Great beans; there literally were only 7 beans left over in the crock pot at the end of the party!

I made this last year for our Easter Dinner and it was such a hit!  I've since made it for potluck dinners at church.  It never fails that people always ask for this recipe.  I often increase the ground beef to 1 pound and add a 4th can of beans (usually pintos).  Once I made this recipe using pork and beans only.  It's hard to mess this one up.  It's great!

DEE-Lish!! Brought it to a BBQ and it was a huge hit. Made it twice, once with ground beef, the other with ground turkey. Preferred the turkey, a little less greasy and there's so much flavor you cant tell the difference! Thank you!

I made these without the ground beef. Everyone LOVED it. My only suggestion is to cook the bacon a little before throwing the onions in there. Some of my onions were a little overcooked...but it still tasted good. I will be making this often!!!!

Being a part of a Southern Family, I was afraid to make this recipe for a large family function.  I was feeding approximately 70 for a family Barbecue. It's not the typical Southern Baked Bean recipe.  However, I took the plunge, being I wanted something different.  Hands down, everyone RAVED over the baked beans.  I couldn't believe the requests for the recipe.

I just realized that I have never reviewed these beans after making them several times. Trust me when I say you need to throw out every other recipe you have for baked beans. These are spectacular. I made these originally for my daughters graduation party and was stunned at the amount of people who asked me for the recipe.  A year later I have talked to many of those same people who asked for the recipe and they told me this recipe also made them the star of whatever event they brought them to. I made the recipe exactly as posted.

This is really good.  I love bake beans.  My husband thought it was a little spicy but it was perfect for me.  Just a difference in taste.  Will definitely be making this again.

Loved these beans!  Made a double batch - omitted the White Sugar entirely.  Thought the beans were still a bit too sweet with just the recipe amount of Brown Sugar, so added a half of a Jalepeno diced.  This helped tame the sweetness and added just a hint of spice.  Needed to add about one cup of water to loosen consistency.  Cooked covered on the stove top for 1 hour and then moved to crockpot and held for 2 hours.  Wonderful beans!

I have made these twice. The first time was for 100 people at a church revival the second for my husband's family 15-20 people.  It was a hit both times.  I had men asking for the recipe.  The first time I included the hamburger and cooked it in a large roaster.  The seconded time in a crock pot without the meat, just bacon.  I preferred the first. This is my go to recipe when making baked beans.

Great recipe!  Only changes I made was to add 1 diced bell pepper with the onion when cooking and instead of the ground beef I used 1 lb mild italian sausage- it added great flavor!

Like many others, I prepare this in a dutch oven.  I cook the bacon until crispy, remove it from the dutch oven and drain the fat.  Then I cook ground beef and onion, and I add a green pepper.

These beans were fabulous!!! I did make a few changes as well as others. I omitted the white sugar and then added a Tablespoon of Molasses and a few drops of liquid smoke. Then put them in the slow cooker for 4 hours. I took them to a bbq where they were having bbq'd pork and everyone wanted the recipe. Thank you for sharing!!!

This was quick and easy and turned out very good after I took others' suggestions of pre-cooking the bacon, omitting the white sugar and adding a tsp or so of molasses. I also stirred in a shot of bourbon for fun.  I was serving this alongside brisket, so I omitted the ground beef and used 12 oz. of bacon.  I'l use this again!  With the changes, it's a 5-star recipe.

These baked beans were quite good.  The only thing holding them off from being 5 stars to me is there was something missing from the sauce.  I think I'll try to add some wortceshire sauce and honey to the sauce next time, but overall they were very good.

This is an EXCELLENT ... QUICK ... and EASY recipe !  It also will be my "go to" recipe !  The only thing different that I did was I used ground pork instead of the beef and I doubled the amount of pork and back ... other than that NO changes were necessary.

I followed this recipe to a t, yet my husband and I just didn't think this dish was worthy of 5 stars.   I may try the recipe once more, just to make sure the fault doesn't lie with the cook.

This has almost been a staple at our house.  Variations are easily made with the meat and beans depending on what we have around the house.  We like sausage and dark beans in ours.

This recipe won raves at our recent 4th of July picnic.  I just had to leave a review so others might benefit.  My version was based on tips from other reviewers:  I made this with ground turkey, I used (gasp!) bacon bits (not the crunchy kind, the soft kind in the jar), I left out white sugar entirely and just used the recommended amount of brown sugar, and I chose to use a combination of light red kidney beans, northern beans, and Bush's original flavor baked beans.  I get it now when one reviewer said she could have eaten the entire dish by herself.  Yum!!!

These beans were such a hit! I used canned beans that I had in the house, replaced the Northern beans with whatever kind I had. Browned the meat and bacon and threw it all into a crockette and let it sit for the rest of the day. Nice and thick, great flavor too! Everyone had seconds and some thirds. They were even better the next day!

I love this recipe as a base, but I definately added more ketchup and barbecue sauce. I would cut back on the brown sugar, and I added some apple cider vinegar to give it acidity I think it needs.

Good flavor but way too sweet. I think leaving out the white sugar will make them perfect!

Not what I thought they would be. To me they didn't taste any different then anybody else's baked beans. One of my friends has an  exceptional baked bean recipe. I thought I would give these a try. These did not come close.

This is an excellent recipe! I made this twice over the past two weeks for a large number of people and now everyone thinks I'm a great cook. I even used the canned baked beans instead of the beans the recipe called for. This is a very good baked bean recipe!

EX-CELL-ENT!  substituted for the white sugar: 1/4 cup white sugar and 2 Tbps black strap molasses. Also had extra hot Indian chili powder- so it was really awake- but EX-CELL-ENT!

Good recipe.  I used half the sugar and it was certainly sweet enough.  Will save this recipe and make again.

OK I have been making this recipe for 35 years. Got it from my wifes aunt in Arkansas. The only thing we do different is add 2 tbsp of molasses and use baby lima beans instead of kidney. Adds some color.

This was brought to a Mother's Day picnic by my nephew and he saved some for me as he thought I would love it.  And I did, it is a go to for potlucks and I make it in the crockpot.  I also use sausage instead of hamburger.  This is a easy and very good side or meal with some cornbread.

Have been making this recipe for years and it is always a favorite. The only additions I make are a jar of picante sauce and 1 t. liquid smoke (my original recipe calls for them both) as it offsets the sweetness of all the sugar.

I made these for a BBQ family gathering for the first time. I did cut the sugar in half, and also replaces the kidney beans with pinto beans because my dad doesn't like kidney beans. These were a huge success. More then one person told me they were the best baked beans they had ever had, and I think my 75 year old Grandpa ate half the pan by himself. He went back at least 4 times for more!

We made this to take to a friends for dinner and it was awesome! It was easy to make, my kids and husband loved it, and our friends did as well. The best part was how great the kitchen smelled while it was baking! Definitely making this one again, it's a keeper.

This was all right, but I still think I like my own better. I omitted the ground beef and used a full pound of bacon. I cooked the onion along with the bacon. Then put that in my crock pot with the rest of the ingredients. I didn't use regular sugar, and really just eyeballed the brown sugar, ketchup, bbq sauce, mustard, pepper, and chili powder. I think I wish I would have left the bbq sauce out. I thought it made the beans just a bit too smokey. I didn't really care for the chili powder in there either. Instead of pork and beans, I used a 28 oz can of Bush's Country Baked Beans. I didn't care for the kidney beans in this. They are usually my favorite, but I thought they were a bit too firm for this. I would have preferred pinto beans. I cooked these on low in my crock pot for 4 hours. They are good, and the leftovers will get finished. But I'll go back to my tried and true recipe. The only reason I tried this recipe is because I was intrigued by the variety of beans used, as well as the chili powder, which I generally love.

I love these beans!!!  I was getting so tired of chilli (which my 8 year old son loves) and decided to try this with all the ground beef I had in my freezer.  It was so delicious!  It was a little sweet, so I think I may eliminate the white sugar or cut it in half.  Enjoy!

Fantastic recipe! I tailored this a bit to fit my family's taste, but I have a feeling it would be tasty as is. I thinly sliced an onion and minced up 5 or 6 cloves of garlic and added that to the meat and bacon as they cooked together in my dutch oven. I also added closer to 2 tsp of ancho chili powder and about 1/2 tsp red pepper. I also used less sugar, about 1/4 cup of each, and added about 2 tbls of mustard instead of the 1 tbls. Then i put the dutch oven in the oven for about 2 hours at 225 (I had ribs in there too). My family loved it! We ended up eating it the next day too with pan bagnats and I think it was even better the second time around!

Really great recipie! My only change was to leave out the white sugar. Was still plenty sweet. Like others would also recommend cooking the bacon seperate for a more crisp texture, otherwise its a little soggy. I will definitely bring this to the next bbq I attend!

I think the name of this recipe should be Man Beans rather than Old Settlers.  The flavor is wonderful. Make sure that your audience likes meat because there is just about every kind in this dish!

These are the best baked beans I have ever made!  This has now become my new go-to recipe.  It was easy to follow and I found all the ingredients without a problem.  I used 12 ounces of bacon and omitted the ground beef and they were excellent!  I may add spicy ground sausage the next time. My family thinks they taste just as good as the baked beans from their favorite BBQ restaurant.  This is a KEEPER!

Delicious!  I substituted Bush's baked beans for the kidney beans, and I couldn't have been happier with how they turned out.  I'm even making enough for 70 people next weekend for my fiance's grandparents 50th wedding anniversary!

Very, very good! We had these beans as a side dish to hamburgers and hot dogs on Labor Day. I am making them again for my daughters Birthday party. I omitted the white sugar and increased the br. sugar to 1/2 cup. Next time I will slow cook them in the crock pot. Deserves the 5 stars!

Great receipe! We needed a more meaty dish for a family reunion so I added 1/2 lb ground beef.  Substituted the white sugar with molasses. Our Dad came over the day after asking for any leftovers!  Will definitely share with friends and family the recipe "as is" as well. Thanks for sharing!

These are great! I changed it just a tad to use things I had on hand. I used one large (28oz) can of Bush's Baked Beans and one can of drained and rinsed black beans. I skipped the regular sugar and added an extra 2 & 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar on top of the 1/3c. I also added a few dashes of onion powder and garlic powder. It was delicious! I will make it again for sure!

I have made these twice now. The first time as written and I found them overly sweet but my family raved. The second time I omitted the white sugar and found them to be perfectly sweet and savory and my family still raved..so this is now our go to recipe for beans. They are so good there is no need to go to the trouble of soaking dry beans and doing all that work. People will think that you did a lot of work to make these beans they are that good.

I did as many others suggested and omitted the white sugar and cooked bacon 1st then the ground beef (I used turkey).  I don't know what I was expecting but this was not it.  I think I would have preferred them to be a bit sweeter and much less on the bacon... although hubs liked all that bacon.  Had these for a Memorial Day cookout and no one really thought they were that great.

I made this for a family gathering Memorial weekend. This dish got so many compliments. Even my dad, who can be a pretty picky eater, wanted my mom to have the recipe. Our 18 month old grandson gobbled them up as well!

Made today for a family gathering.  It was my first time making it this way and it was delish!  Easy dish to make according to one's tastes.  I omitted the cumin and it wasn't missed at all.  Enjoy.

I love this recipe! A few changes... I add stewed tomatoes (drained, sounds weird, tastes great!) and I use black beans and white navy beans along with the 'pork and beans' instead of kidney and northern beans. Better beans, and with the tomatoes, gives it a beautiful pop of color!

Excellent recipe!  I substituted the bacon with 1 TBS bacon bits, omitted the 1/2 cup sugar and instead of using the 1/2 brown sugar- I used 2 TBS brown sugar splenda mix.

Great recipe. I replaced the sugar with molasses 1TBLS. Accidentally bought maple bacon, but it turned out pretty good. Plan to make it again without the maple.

I loved these beans!  I have decided I like the thicker, multiple bean recipes for baked beans!  My husband does not!  We are in a bean war in our house!  I think these are a keeper, he does not.  He wants a runnier/one bean recipe!

I didn't have bacon or any of the types of beans mentioned, but I made this recipe with pinto beans and just the ground beef and it still turned out amazing! Everyone loved them!

Made in slow cooker like another reviewer, substituting garbanzo for the Great Northern beans and adding the crisp bacon on top at the end.  Definitely a keeper!  Great recipe... the taste of the sauce reminded me of the "Family Favorite Meatloaf" from the Best of Bridge series of recipe books, which is my go-to meatloaf recipe.

I made this on Saturday for 60 people at the Moose Lodge and it was a big hit.  I did not use the ground beef or the white sugar and I used pinto beans in place of the pork & beans.  I fried the bacon crispy and the cooked the onion in the grease, then drained it and added all other ingredients and cooked in a crock pot.  I am not a bean eater but these were great.

I've made this recipe twice now. Originally I made it as written and it really does deserve 5 stars "as is". But, like so many of us do, we change things a little as we start making it more- and I'm no exception. These are some things I changed:  I fried up my bacon first.  I omitted the white sugar entirely and doubled the brown sugar. I used a 28 oz. can of Bush's reg. baked beans (undrained) in place of the 16oz. can of pork and beans. I used the kidney and Great Northern Beans but also added a can of pinto beans to the mix. I added 1 tbsp. of molasses and 1 tsp. of liquid smoke to the sauce. After cooking up the bacon, browning the hamburger and onion- I threw everything in a crockpot and cooked on low for 6hrs. I refrigerated it overnight and served it the next day after re-heating up the slow-cooker. Very Very good. I really do think that was a major change. Definitely make the day before. It serves up thicker and the flavors infuse together wonderfully:) Thanks so much for posting Kathy:):)

So Good. Best Baked Beans I have ever had. Eats like a meal so I think the serving size listed is more for a main dish then a side dish. I doubled it before knowing this and had a ton of leftover but they froze great and reheated perfectly.

The ONLY thing I changed on this recipe is that I use all pork and beans instead of the different kinds of beans. The first time I made this I made it with the different kinds of beans and it came out chili-like, and not as many people commented on it as they did with just pork and beans.

Perfect dish. Eliminated the white sugar as suggested by others. Cooked the bacon first, then browned the ground beef in the bacon grease, then browned the onions in the bacon/beef grease. Wonderful flavor, and the hit of our party. Adding to recipe box and will make again!!!

I get nothing but rave reviews and requests for more whenever I make these.  The recipe is excellent just as it stands, however, I do add two or three chipotle peppers (canned in adobo sauce) to give a little extra heat at the end.  They are the perfect combination of sweet and spicy... simply delicious.

i've never made my own beans before and after reading the reviews and using no white sugar just brown they turned out delicious  i also browned all of the meats before adding any ingrediants and then let the mixture set in the fridge overnight to marinate heating them up an hour before i left the house.....i brought them to a bbq and they were a hit who knew beans could be the star of the show! i will be making these again

This was a good hearty recipe however too sweet for my family.  I used a little less sugars but I could have cut both in 1/2 and it would be better.  I also used Splenda verisions for both which there was no taste variations and more healthier!

I took the advice of previous posters and left out the white sugar. They were plenty sweet for with only half the sugar.  I subsituted pork for the beef since that was what was in the freezer...but that won't change the sauce flavor by a lot. Like others, I threw in and extra can of beans to serve a bigger crowd.....but again not a flavor changer.

Great Beans.  I did not add the white sugar.  Afraid they might be too sweet.  Added brown sugar accord to recipe.  Turned out perfect.  Have made them three time since and are always a hit.  This could be the entire meal.

Delicious!  But don't be fooled by the recipe submitter writing that her husband likes "spicy" food.  This is in no way spicy, unless by spicy you mean sweet.

Excellent recipe took this to a church luncheon today and rave reviews. I did not add the white sugar and doubled the size of pork and beans in this dish. It is plenty sweet with the 1/3 cup of brown sugar, I fried bacon first then drained most of the bacon grease and saute the meat and onions together. Be sure and season your ground beef with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder.

I made these for Easter. Doubled the recipe, but left out the white sugar and only used 1 onion. I think it could definitely have used the sugar (or more brown sugar). I used Campbell's pork and beans...not my fav. I was hesitant to give it less than 5 stars because I changed a couple of things, but my biggest complaint was that there was not enough sauce, and I know my changes would not have affected the amount of sauce. Next time I will double the sauce....otherwise they are sorta dry.

I am very impressed. Very tasty. I made it into two portions, 1 with kidney beans and 1 without, only because hubby can't eat kidney beans. I tasted his with out the kidney beans and it was just as good as the one with.All 6 of my family loved it! Ty for a great recipe!

This recipe smells heavenly while cooking and is something I'll make again.  Instead of white sugar, I used molasses.  I also cooked this in my crockpot and made the mistake of adding the ketchup at the beginning (tomatoes make the beans stay hard) so it took a lot longer to cook.  6 hours on low and another 6 hours on high.  It was worth the wait!

Best baked beans ever! Instead of baking mine, I simply combine all the ingredients (after cooking the bacon and ground beef) in a large mixing bowl, refrigerate overnight, and put in the crockpot the next day. I also always use maple bacon and a touch of maple syrup. Absolutely fabulous and easy!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I prepared these the night before and the next day I put them in the crock pot.  YUM!  The only change I made was I didn't have any chili powder on hand, so left it out.  Perfect!  Thanks, Kathy.

I made this recipe last night (2/3/08), and like most of the other reviewers, my husband really liked it! Next time I make it I'll eliminate the white sugar & ketchup, though, because it was way too sweet for us. I'll use just brown sugar and BBQ sauce in place of ketchup. I used ground turkey as well.  Thanks!

Delish!  I used homemade ketchup and BBQ sauce, cooked the white and kidney beans from scratch, used ground turkey instead of beef and cut down the sugar to a total of 1/2 C (instead of 2/3 C).  We loved it and I will probably lower the sugar a bit more next time, it was very sweet.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I follow the recipe pretty closely except I cut back on the bacon a little and skip the white sugar. I throw everything in the crockpot in the morning on low and it's ready at the end of the day. Great in the summer with burgers, hot dogs, etc.

I made this for a graduation party (months ago) and many people wanted the recipe.  It is very filling and a meal in itself.  I followed the reviews about cooking the bacon first, cutting out the white sugar and using just the brown sugar.  I could not find butter beans like a reviewer suggested and my dad even mentioned he was surprised not to see them in the bean mixture.  I can not wait to make this again in a few days with butter beans.

8/2012: Without a shadow of a doubt, hands down the BEST baked beans I ever tasted!!! I made these for a family reunion last weekend and make enough for a serving of 30, which I put in a huge aluminum roaster pan for a turkey. We had a 3 hour drive to get to the reunion and when I got there they were still nice and warm. I came home with about 1 quart. I did take the advice of others and instead of using white sugar I used all brown sugar. I also used a sweet and spicy bbq sauce and as per others recommendations, I fried the bacon first and then put it in the meat/onion mixture. I had so many people ask me for my recipe, I didn't have the heart to tell them where I got it. My job is to now bring the beans next year for the reunion. I just felt sorry for the other gal who brought her baked beans. She went home with almost a whole container. Thank You Kathy for sharing this recipe with the world. I will NEVER buy store bought baked beans again. UPDATE 6/2016: I have made this many more times since my initial review and always get rave reviews. I have made this for work functions too and find that there is hardly anything left to take home. If you want a great baked beans recipe this one is well worth keeping in your recipe file! UPDATE 9/19: Once again this hits the spot. I have now been designated that whenever I bring a dish I have to attach the recipe. I printed off 40 baked beans recipe instructions and they were gone in a matter of hours. (Staff trickling into the break ro

Too sweet as writen, and that's with me eliminating the white sugar, and using 1/2 c of brown sugar. Had to add lots more chili powder to compensate.  Next time I'll try 1-2 T of brown sugar instead.  DO take others' suggestion and fry the bacon alone first (drain most of the fat off before starting on the ground beef). 

Just so you're aware, I think  this is more like a BBQ Chili than it is BBQ "baked beans."

YUM! I noticed my beans looked dry coming out of the  oven even though I had covered it with foil. So I made another batch of the sauce and added some to bring it back to life. LOVE that sauce.

I too cooked the meat seperate and used less sugar. I would suggest adding sugar a little at a time according to your taste. I loved this recipe and will be making it again. For me it tasted like honey mustard baked beans, yummy!

This is REALLY good - even without the beef. Very flavorful.  Everyone at the 4th of July picnic loved it. (But it is not spicy at all.)

I made these for our family 4th of July party. We are big meat-eaters, so I used 3/4 lb beef and 3/4 lb bacon. They were such a hit! They also reheat well if you have leftovers.

This recipe is AMAZING! I made it for a BBQ and it was a big hit. It was the first thing to go and I already had several requests for the recipe! I did put in more bacon than this called for (can never go wrong with more bacon) and cooked the bacon first based on some of the other reviews.  I then threw everything into my crock pot and cooked it on low for 8 hours. It didn't need that long but it just kept getting better. Thanks for the great recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

I am typically not a fan of Baked Beans but my husband loves them.  These are the best Baked Beans I have ever eaten! I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onion.  I will make them over and over again!

I fried the bacon separate from the burger and onion and then mixed everything together in my crock pot for a couple hours. No BBQ sauce in the house so chili sauce was substituted with a few red pepper flakes being added. Finally, the white sugar was omitted. This was a great meal in itself and we'll have it regularly. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Wonderful!  I made them for a birthday party and they got rave reviews.  I did crisp the bacon up by itsself and did a combo between ground beef and sausage.  Since  I doubled the recipe I switched 1 can to butter beans for variety.

Delicious. We loved the 3 different kinds of beans. I cut out the white sugar and it was still a little too sweet. I'll cut down even more next time.

This was a real crowd pleaser at a recent neighborhood picnic.  If you'd rather a less sweet casserole, you might just reduce the amount of sugar... sweet, but not too sweet for me.

For a family that don't eat beans too often this is a yummy and easy way to get those kids to eat beans. Based on many reviewer comments I cut back on the sugar and only used the brown sugar. It came sweet enough for my daughter to love it! She had seconds. I also used pork&beans and white beans. I cooked the bacon seperately first and also saved some (uncut) to layer the top before baking. I grew up eating hotdogs in the p&b so I subbed the hotdogs for the ground beef.

I made this slightly different.  Cooked the bacon first as others suggested, and added bell pepper.  I used the beans I had on hand, which were butter beans (big limas), red beans, and great northern beans.  I also added an extra 2 T ketchup and BBQ sauce and 1/2 T mustard because canned pork and beans would have added some more sauce.  After tasting it I added about a teaspoon of Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce.  The beans turned out really tasty!  They were a bit sweeter than I'd prefer (will cut back to 1/2 C of brown sugar only) but tasted really good other than that.  Next time I'm going to leave out the ground beef and bacon because we didn't feel it added much, and my husband requested that I make it with all red beans instead of a mix.

This was wonderful!  I made it for a cookout and everyone loved it!  I have never made baked beans because I personally do not like them, I always thought they were boring and didn't want to waste time with them, but I was assigned to make the baked beans for this cookout, so I was looking for a recipe that I might like and be proud to take.  This recipe was just that.  Thanks for sharing it with us!

I strayed from the recipe a bit, mainly because I can't stand pork and beans. I 1.5ed the "sauce" ingredients and used a 30 oz can of pinto beans, 15 oz can of light red kidney beans, 15 oz can of red beans, and 15 oz can of butter beans. I drained, but did not rinse the beans (why rinse away that great bean flavor?). I also added several shakes of a basic Louisiana hot sauce. Everyone loved the beans, with several people have third and fourth helpings.   What I like most about this recipe is that the sauce is NOT a thick, syrupy goo that takes over the beans. You can see what you're eating, and also get the great flavor from the spices in the sauce.

Oh my goodness.  These were so good. I have never reviewed anything on here before, but for these, I wish I could give it more stars.  I didn't change a thing.  They weren't too spicy but the bacon and meat in combination with the different beans just worked!

OHSOGOOD! You can change the type of beans you use every time you make it.  Tonight I used dk red kidney beans, pinto beans, large butter beans, and BUSH's homestyle baked beans, vidalia onion, and then followed everything else in the recipe. Fantastic! Thank you! Oh yeah, followed other's advice and omitted the white sugar.

This is absolutely amazing. I don't like beans and I LOVED this. Only change I made as per a suggestion, I left out white sugar completely and used a little more brown sugar. I used Jack Daniel's brand BBQ sauce but I don't think it would really matter what kind you use. AWESOME RECIPE!!

I have made this recipe at least 20 times in the last few years but I use from 1/3 to 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar. It doesn't need the white. It is my all-time favorite bean recipe - goes with every meat in every season even though it has hamburger in it, and it never ceases to bring "please give me that recipe!" comments. It can be made in the crock pot also - but make sure and don't over-cook. If you need to, you can add an additional can of beans - I add butter beans.  Y U M M Y!

I omitted white sugar and only used the recommended amount  of brown sugar.  I used a can of Bush's baked beans instead of  pork and beans.  I also cooked my bacon in a different pan than the ground beef and onion.  I tossed it all in a crock pot and let it simmer for a few hours.  They were very good and plenty sweet.  I will be keeping this one to make again!

An excellent baked bean recipe. I took this to a Memorial Day cookout this weekend and everybody loved it. I made a few minor adjustments: I fried the bacon in the a pan by iteself as opposed to frying it along with the beef and onion. I found that the bacon cooks more crisply with this method. Removed the bacon, and then fried the onion and ground beef in the same pan (also added one clove of chopped garlic). Also, I cooked the beans in a crock pot as opposed to baking them.

A little too sweet for my taste, but really good- a 4.5. Next time I will cut half the sugar, which will probably make it a 5.

I used garbanzo beans, kidney beans, and Bushs original beans-since that is what I had in the house. We sprinkled shredded cheese on top.  Everyone here enjoyed it!  I'll be doing this again-thanks!

This is the recipe I always use for barbecues.  The only minor alteration I make is adding a dash of liquid smoke.  These are always a hit.

These beans had a great flavor. I used 1 lb. bacon instead of using the hamburger. The only problem I had was they seemed like they needed more cooking time. I will try about 2 hours in the oven next time.

I adapted this recipe so that I could use the Van Camp's original baked beans as a base.  It was fantastic!  I got rave reviews from everyone, even my pickiest eaters.  This takes baked beans from standard side dish to main event quality.

This is a good, slightly above average (i.e. not your "basic" pork n' beans) recipe. While I enjoyed this, I still think I am going to continue my search for the perfect recipe, but until I find it, this will do. Took a big batch of this to a BBQ Sunday night. I appreciate Lorna's advice and followed most her suggestions to the letter except for frying my bacon with my beef/onions as directed (I prefer my bacon to be less crisp in this instance) and cooking everything in my well greased (I've had problems with chili burning in it before...) slow cooker on high for the first hour and then for two hours on low (due to time constraints - I only had a few hours to prepare several dishes for a freind's BBQ/cookout). I found that using the full amount of brown sugar called for and subbing half the amount of brown sugar for regular granulated sugar wasn't a good move for me. I like my pork & beans sweet, so I'll use Kathy's suggested amounts next time. My beans had a very nice hickory accent which I enjoyed (I used a generic store brand hickory BBQ sauce that I wanted to clear out of my fridge). Overall, this is a nice recipe. My fiance didn't care for this, but he doesn't like beans anyways (argh!!!). If you like beans, you should definitely give it a try though! Thanks for sharing with us Kathy :)

These are great!! They were the first thing to disappear at our son's 1st birthday party. WOW!! I tweaked it just some - threw in butter beans, black beans (along with the other beans listed) and left out white sugar - went to 3/4 brown sugar. Simmered on the stove then threw it in the crock pot on low for a few hours. (We tripled this recipe.) Yummy!!

We really liked these. I switched out the ketchup for more barbecue sauce, used all brown sugar, and doubled the chili powder and black pepper. I also added an extra can of beans--black beans in this case as I thought it needed some more beans for the amount of sauce it had made. I will definitely make these again!

This dish is scrumptious! It is a little spicy. I tripled all ingredients accept the beans (which I doubled)and used only 1/4 cup of the white sugar. It was plenty sweet with the brown sugar and the barbecue sauce I happened to use- KC Masterpiece Hickory/Honey. A huge hit!

I cooked these in my slow cooker for about 4 hours on low.  The beans melted in your mouth after that!  I used one can of BBQ beans with pork, one can of navy beans, and one can of butter beans.  The ground beef really makes the recipe!

I can't believe how good these beans turned out.  And I don't even really like baked beans, but my husband loves them so I wanted to make something different for him.  I used all ketchup instead of BBQ, and all brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I used a whole pound of ground beef and a whole pound of bacon.  I added a little molasses and worstershire.  Also I used one can of pinto, one can of butter beans and one can of Bush's Baked Beans.  These were the best baked beans ever!

Delicious. I followed the directions exactly, except I scaled it down to 2 servings as all I had was a lonely can of pinto beans...This recipe turned those pintos into beautiful hearty baked beans! Good flavor and I love all the meat.

this is such a good recipe!! They didn't have great northern beans at pricemart, so instead, i got 2 cans of kidney beans and 2 cans of pork and beans, i'm sure it would have been even better if i had the great northern beans instead!  I made bannock with it too, sooo yummy!

I omitted the white sugar, as other reviewers suggested, and it was still a bit sweet for my taste. Overall, though, a great dish.

Yes!  A real husband pleaser!  I used a large can of Bush's Baked Beans in place of the pork & beans and kidney beans; and I adjusted the sugar down a bit accordingly.  This recipe is definitely a "have for lunch the next day" recipe!

This recipe was very good.  I used a hot in spicy barbeque sauce for an extra kick.  It went over very well with my husband and 4 kids.  Will definetly make again.

This is a staple in our home!  My daughter's favorite dish ... we eat it as the main course for dinner and serve with cornbread.  I am requested to bring this dish to every event known to man!  LOL!  Definitely cut back on the sugar ... I'd add a small amount and adjust accordingly.

Have made this recipe for years. Family favorite. It is still, hands down, the BEST recipe. My only alteration, smoked paprika and garlic powder, Sometime I use Sweet Italian Sausage instead of hamburger meat. I cook 15 min with a cover after the 1 hr covered because we like liquid a little tighter. But if you do just as is, it is the best.

My family has always loved bakes beans. I have made these beans four times now and everyone loves them and asks for the recipe! I like a little more sauce so when measuring out the liquid and spices I am a bit more on the heavy side.

This is the base of the recipe I use.  I usually skip the ground beef and bacon and just add in a ham bone.  I also use black beans instead of kidney.  Everyone loves these beans.

These are the most delicious baked beans ever!!!  The bacon and ground beef take this recipe to the next level.  After eating this, I became smarter than everyone else that I know.  People have written books about me and these baked beans!!!

First time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but a little too sweet. Second, time I cut the white sugar completely and it was perfect. Definitely a keeper! I'll try making bacon separately next time, as one of the reviewers suggested

This recipe is fantastic, even if you don't have something like the beef, bacon, or pork and beans. I've made it on many occasions with one or more of these missing and it's still delicious.  I've also tried it with different type of beans, (whatever was in my cabinet) and it works with everything!

This ain't your daddy's baked beans.  This is a meal! If you are a fan of the bean, but would like something a bit more than the standard pinto bean variety, this is the ticket for you.  I cooked it as is, but doubled the recipe for a family get together.  It was a big hit.  OH!  Do cook the bacon first.  It's a much better texture than the wiggly strips.  I cook them right in the pot as opposed to baking them  Just simmer uncovered until thick.  Saves a dirty dish, and I like just as well.  You won't go hungry eating these beans, and you won't want for flavor.  Great for Bar-B-Ques too.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I took the advice of another person and cooked my bacon separately.  I, too, exchanged the white sugar for brown, reducing the amount as well.  Also, I was out of ketchup and had to improvise.  I had some Texas Pete's Buffalo Sauce that I used instead, and it gave the dish a slightly spicy taste...which I loved!  This will be a permanent amendment to the dish for me, and I will make it for many years to come!  Well done!

This was a fabulous recipe!  I left out the bacon and ground beef,  (I'm not vegetarian, but somedays I feel like omitting meat) added extra chili powder, mustard and BBQ sauce.  YUM!  I think this is now my favorite bean recipe.  Thanks for submitting!

Even the picky eaters in my family like this recipe. I took the advice of a few other folks and cooked the bacon and hamburger separatelywhich kept the bacon crispier.  Other than that I kept to the recipe and have to say that this one is a keeper!

I have made a similar baked beans dish for some time now.  The only changes that I make is to not drain any of the beans, add an extra can of pork and beans, and also add a 1/2 cup of sugar (both regular and brown) instead of the 1/3 cup as the recipe indicates!  Very delicious!

I've made these twice so far, and each time they are delicous and everyone loves them!  Reminds me of the way my grandma used to make beans.

Yummy and different.  An option would be to brown the beef, bacon and onion then mix everything together in a crockpot and cook all day on low.

i subbed ground pork for the beef,used extra bacon and omitted the white sugar as i was using a sweet bbq sauce. After taste testing, i felt like this was missing something so i added 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke and baked as directed. Yum!

Cooked bacon and set aside while I cooked the ground beef and onions, then added it all to the crock pot for several hours.  They were good...but the next day, they were wonderful!

I made these for a family party and everyone liked them.  I made them the day before and just rewarmed them in the crockpot.  I had a request to make them again this weekend for another family get together.  I didn't make any changes, but with a recipe like this, you could easily add a little more or less of a listed ingredient.  Thanks for the recipe!  This is a keeper.

How'd my recipe get on here?  This is more or less the exact same recipe I have been making for years (I don't add the chili powder).  Everyone always raves about it and I always get asked to make it for our family's cookouts.  It's the best!

This one is a keeper, my husband likes this one so much I have to make it again, just a week later!  Like others, I ommited the white sugar and instead of ground beef, I used some spicy sausage that I had on hand. Really great if you like spicy.  I think this recipe is perfect as written or you can tweek it a little to suit your taste buds like I did.  Thanks to Kathy for sharing

Our family really enjoys these.  I have made them a couple times and the only change I made was substituting pinto beans for the kidneys beans.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is such a great comfort food recipe. My mom used to make it when I lived at home. It's been at least 6 six years since I've had them and decided to make them myself. My roommmates and I loved them! They are great with cornbread! I made a couple changes the first time, and will make some more the second time. I added extra of the ketchup, bbq and brown sugar by maybe 1/2. I didn't even add white sugar. I also fried the bacon separately. This took longer, but I like the results even though I hadn't done it the other way first. Next time I would not add so much meat. It just felt like tons of meat to me. I'd also like to try it in a crock pot next time like my mom used to do.

Excellent and easy!  The only change we made was to use ground turkey and turkey bacon.  I am not sure why you have to bake it though, I guess to absorb some of the liquid?  We'll definitely make this again.

I followed Lorna's advice which was to make the day before, cook bacon before adding, eliminate white sugar, and increase brown sugar. I also couldn't find Great Northern beans so I used a can of mixed beans. I mixed all this the day before and put it in the fridge then I put it in a slow cooker on low in the morning and cooked it all day. I had a ton of people ask for the recipe!

This was very good but I added more ground meat than it called for.  Next time I will stick to the recipe.  Our family enjoyed it.

I’ve made this recipe a bunch of times, but I have modified it a bit. Instead of cooking bacon I always buy packages of real bacon bits. That cuts my cooking time down quite a lot. I also cut the ketchup and sugar out completely, but I double the bbq sauce. Instead of kidney beans I use pinto beans. And, finally, I cook it early in the day, let it rest in the refrigerator, then warm it up for supper.

Absolutely delicious.  I made this for guests and everyone was raving with second and third helpings.  Could not find Great Northern Beans, so used Butter Beans instead.

Fantastic recipe!  It is a meal within itself.  I adapted a little to my family's taste: I added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 2 tsp worcestershire sauce to the ground beef as it cooked and a tsp of minced garlic.  I also minced 1/2 of an onion (no additional, just what the recipe calls for) into the ground beef as well.
