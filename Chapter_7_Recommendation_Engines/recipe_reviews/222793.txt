Just a couple comments.  Four tsp of seasoning for 1 cup of mushrooms is WAY too much.  And unless you really want oregano-sauteed mushrooms, 2 tsp of oregano IMO is WAY too much.  I used baby portobellas and sliced mine instead of chopping for a better presentation.  I mixed up the seasoning but only added about half of it because the mushrooms were getting really "gummy".  I like oregano, but it just overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the mushrooms.  Mushrooms release a lot of liquid and cook quickly, so I have to wonder if you really even need 3 tbsp of fat.

Easy and tasty.  Not the BEST sauteed mushrooms I"ve ever had, but they were good.  I didn't use any steak seasoning.

I cooked these for my wife and had to get her to rate this for me; I dont eat shrooms.  She said it was a terrific blend of seasoning, perfectly cooked, and went well with pasta last nite, and re-heated on steak this evening.  Also, she said she wouldnt change a thing.  Thanks!

Made these with a little less of each seasoning. Used McCormick's  Montreal Steak Seasoning, and added a little extra butter at the end.  Served over Fillet cooked on the grill. Delicious!  Will definitely use this recipe again. Husband love them.

This recipe was good, but only because I halved the spices entirely and used a Tbsp less of oil.  I agree with other reviewers that this recipe is heavy on spices for only one cup of mushrooms. Less is more!!  I chose to add the recipe's optional ingredient of steak seasoning, but I only "dusted" it over the mushrooms instead of measuring a full tsp!  I also felt they needed a shake or two of salt.  I hate not giving high ratings for recipes, but since I had to completely alter the recipe to avoid wasting perfectly good mushrooms, I think 3 out of 5 for the original recipe is a fair rating.

These were a nice compliment to grilled steaks. I agree that the seasoning/mushroom ratio is a bit overwhelming, but is an easy fix.   These would be great used in a quesadilla!   THANKS for the recipe, NolaBlu!

Used salted butter instead of unsalted, and put in waaay to much garlic powder, but it still came out great! Will use again.

Did a batch of baby bellas with this recipe minus the optional steak seasoning, sooooooooo good, oh man wish I had bought 5 more lbs of mushrooms, they barely made it to the table.  Easy to make too, my young son actually cooked these up.

Simple recipe, but it turned out wonderful. My daughter who claims she hates mushrooms, actually ate the!
The only problem I had was that I didn’t make enough.

I loved them because they were flavourful and also eye pleasing. I'm 14 years old I, didn't ask for help, and I can't cook but these were amazing. I added 1/2 a teaspoon of water in the pan then let is steam, after that, I added spinach and then let that simmer. YUMMY

I just used regular button mushrooms and did not use butter as my daughter can’t have dairy. They were delicious!

Definitely a winner! I usually just use butter, olive oil and garlic and it's good - but the addition of the extra ingredients really spice these up perfectly.

I used less of each seasoning. Just reading it told me that was way too much. We did enjoy them though. In the morning the left overs are going into an omelet.

I liked this recipe, but I did have to cut the oregano to a pinch just because my family is not a fan of a lot of oregano.
