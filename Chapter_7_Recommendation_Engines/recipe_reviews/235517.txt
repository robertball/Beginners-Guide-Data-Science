This cookie tastes just like a blonde brownie. It even has the same dense chewy texture. However, it has the appearance of a chocolate crinkle with the cracked powdered sugar making it attractive enough for a cookie tray. I made 1/2 recipe, and It made 20 cookies using a cookie scoop. I gently shaped them, but left them in a mound shape, and placed on a parchment paper lined sheet. Even though I coated them well with powdered sugar I had about half of it leftover. Mine took 16-17 minutes to bake.

I'm so very very glad that I waited to write my review.  In fact, you'll probably think I'm totally nuts when I tell you my thoughts.  I made these, waited until the next day to taste them because of what the submitter said about the taste getting stronger the next day.  I didn't think they really tasted at all.  I stuck them away in a cupboard and promptly forgot them.  I found them this morning--eleven days later!  And guess what?!?  I LOVE them!  Yes, they are getting old, but the edges are wonderfully crunchy, and the middle is still just creamy soft.  And the taste is very pronounced.  Yummy with my coffee this morning!  Now I'll put them in my freezer to preserve them for the future coffees!  Thanks, Noelle!

They turn out perfect every time. I even replaced the butter with vegetable oil once and they were still great.

Sort of a butterscotch flavor. I agree that they taste like blondies and I prefer them warm out of the oven (the same way I like my blondies). The reason they are getting three stars is because no one I served them to really thought they were very special. When I showed up at a pot luck I was rushed by people who love my baking and are always looking for something new from me...unfortunately everyone seemed very dissapointed. I asked my friend to be brutally honest and she told me not to make them again-that everything else I make is much better. I'm going to take her advice.

yum!  they are so good!  I usually skip the step of rolling them in powdered sugar because I am lazy and it makes my hands sticky.  I've had really good luck replacing half the flour with white whole wheat flour and not noticing a difference in taste.  I like to freeze the dough for about an hour before baking to minimize spreading during baking.

Hubby called these cookie "incredible". Due to other reviewers saying they were a little bland, the salt & vanilla extract were doubled. Everything else stayed the same. Great cookie.

Wonderful, quick, and easy treat!  I did not add salt since I had salted butter on hand.  The texture is certainly for folks who like a semi-chewy center.  Will definitely use this recipe in the future.

I had fun making this recipe with my kids! It's so fun rolling the dough balls in the confectioner sugar. The cookies are rich and sweet but not too heavy. This is an excellent dessert for anyone looking for a simply, quick and easy cookie recipe!

I loved these cookies. They came out very nice and soft and almost like a bread texture. They are my new favorite cookies. The only thing that I did not like was that they didnt shape very well, but that may have been something I did wrong. Anyways, we made these for Santa today (Christmas eve) and they were a hit :D

This recipe is great! I modified it by swapping vanilla extract for rum extract and added 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips. Amazing

Delish! I made these just as written and they are delicious. They absolutely remind you of Blondies. As suggested by another reviewer, I think I will reduce the brown sugar to 1 3/4 c. Thnx for sharing! ??

Too much sugar. I believe 1 3/4 c would have been fine.

I thought these were delightful little treasures.  Even my husband who always wants chocolate cookies thought they were excellent.   If you are looking for a pretty cookie for a cookie swap, you may want to consider this one; and these would be a wonderful addition on any cookie platters.   For now, I’ll just enjoy them with my cup of coffee.  I’ll be making these again soon.

Great recipe!! I added a little vanilla yogurt and cinnamon and left off the confectioner's sugar. They were chewy and crispy outside. This recipe is a favorite of ours!!

This is a great recipe that makes chewy soft cookies that go great with tea, coffee or milk!  I made exactly as the recipe states and rolled then into balls then flattened a bit then coated with powdered sugar. Perfect!

This was yummy. It had a slightly nutty taste that we couldn't figure out how that happened. I was going to wait a few days to see if they got even better but honestly these cookies lasted less than 2 days. Also, I didn't have unsalted butter at the time so I added a little less salt to the recipe than indicated.

I made this recipe on a whim and was trying to avoid making an ENTIRE batch of cookies in fear I'd consume all of them, including indulging in the dough before baking. 

Anyway, these cookies were phenomenal. I reduced the quantity to make 15 cookies which in reality made 7 cookies with my cookie scoop. I believe my scoop holds a 1/4 cup of dough. I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand so I added 1/4 tsp (for the 15 cookie quantity) of ground cinnamon to the dry mixture (flour, baking powder, salt). This amount of cinnamon will need to be upped if you plan to make the full batch.

I tried one cookie hot off the cookie pan and it was amazingly chewy, thick and had just the right amount of sweetness. Love these, cannot wait to have one tomorrow after it's had time to sit and rest.

Took to a church event, received rave reviews. Many had not experienced this recipe before. Have made a few more times since. Chewy, sweet.  If there are ever any left over, I think they will need to be kept in an airtight container.

My daughter and I made these, they were giant cookies! We only did half a batch, so halved all the ingredients except the vanilla flavour, we used a whole teaspoon. And we used self raising flour instead of plain flour and baking powder. They turned out perfectly!!

This recipe used less butter than the one that I had used for years. Therefore the cookie had more of a soft cake like texture. I absolutely loved my new recipe and will use it again. I did make one change. I rolled the dough in brown sugar before baking.

I was curious about these, so decided to make them. The flavor is a little difficult to describe - maybe a bit like caramel? They also have a slightly chewy texture, which I prefer. I will likely make these again.

Used extra creamy butter and a melon scoop.  Had a rich, almost chewy texture.  Were a hit, especially my uncle, who said they were the best cookie he ever tasted. Will make again.

These cookies baked up beautifully but I did not like the taste.  The brown sugar was overpowering,(too much)   I think half brown, half white sugar would have made a better tasting cookie.    Sorry

I like the chewyness of the cookies. I switched to this recipe at the last second because I ran out of white sugar. Cooked for two minutes less than it called for. They look pretty on a tray.

Done this twice, loved it both times, and so did my family. First time I mistakenly used baking soda instead of powder. I actually think they came out a lot better that time. They were much crisper that way.

These are simple and delicious. Easy to pull together and a wonderful yummy treat. Chewy and light - my kind of cookie. I suppose they may not win a baking contest (another reviewer noted people who were used to her baking were disappointed), but, for me, for a home-cooked and sweet moment with my kids and husband, these hit the spot.

It may be because I used Best Brown sugar rather than the lighter Golden type, but these were amazing.  Chewy with a bit of sugar crunch, soft on the inside, with a warm butterscotch flavour.  I used 1 3/4 c. of brown sugar instead and it did well.  A new fave!

I really enjoyed these....I think anyone who likes the flavor of brown sugar would too.  My batch had a very interesting, unique texture - a crisp, crunchy exterior followed by a soft, dense, chewy interior.  I baked them for about 16 minutes.
