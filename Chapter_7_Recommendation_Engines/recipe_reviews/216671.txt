Good balance of flavors. I used half Dijon and half spicy brown mustard. Tasty sauce it made. Keeper.

Decent recipe, but very dijon heavy.  Cut in half unless you like a heavy mustard flavor.

This was really great! I thought the dijon was just the right amount for our taste and the almonds added such a nice extension to the sauce. Thanks for sharing!

This is so good and I don't even like pork. The only change I made was that I very finely minced actual garlic instead of using garlic powder for the meat rub, because I ran out of garlic powder. Other than that, I changed nothing. I bought pork tenderloin that was already sliced into thin medallions. Served with Salade Lyonnaise (from allrecipes) and french bread. easy and so delicious.

My husband and I loved this.  I may have been doing something wrong but I ended up needing a bit more butter than the recipe called for... also, I substituted buttermilk for the cream and used a lot more garlic and tarragon.  Rich and delish!

My kitchen smelled amazing when I was making it, and I knew it was going to be good. My only major change was substituting thyme for the tarragon, as I couldn't find tarragon anywhere. I used a sliver of a no-salt-added buillon cube. Great recipe!

The directions were easy to follow and the whole family loved it!  I will definitely be making this again but will add a bit less tarragon & Dijon (this is just personal preference and no reflection on the recipe).  I served with asparagus spears and used the sauce for both -- delicious. I think the recipe would also work well for salmon and plan to try that in place of the pork next time :)

Great recipe! I found a few things that needed to be slightly modified but over all it was really yummy! First with the pork my cuts were a little thicker than suggested  because I decided to do more of a slow simmered pork. The pork chops did not finish cooking through properly with the given time so my solution was to up the sauce amount. There was not much of a sauce with just the wine and cream so I added 1 cup of chicken stock and added back the seared pork for about 15 more minutes on medium low till the pork was cooked through and the sauce was thickened. I served this with egg noodles and broccoli and it rounded out the meal beautifully! *Note: with the sauce add a little water if the it thickens to much or you want more. With my way, compared to others opinions on the Dijon is mellowed out A LOT with the addition of the liquids and simmering. 1 teaspoon was plenty!

Used English mustard power and yoghurt instead of cream. Added some salt to taste. Easy and tasty recipe thank you!

Very tasty. Don't over-cook tenderloins. 1/2 of mustard is a great recommendation.

We will definitely make this again, though I think we would cut out the bouillon granules and replaces the wine with some reduced broth.  We found it a little more salty than we like.

Fantastic recipe!  Prepping the pork took a bit more time than I anticipated, but it was well worth it in the end.  Absolutely delicious!  The balance of flavors is lovely.  Restaurant quality.

Whole family loved it!  And, since I am always trying to cut fat, I used skim milk instead of whipping cream and inadvertently forgot to add the chicken boullion.  Still turned out great.  Thank you for sharing!

Good recipe. Used chops instead of tenderloin.  Added salt to the chops and also to the sauce.
