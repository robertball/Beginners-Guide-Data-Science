I made this soup this evening.  It was fantastic!  The celery isn't listed above, but it is referenced to in the directions.  I'm not crazy about celery, so I left it out.  I also used fat-free half and half to lower the fat content.  I will defintely make this again!

Tried this recipe as written first and didn't enjoy it.  It didn't taste bad, just very bland.  After seasoning changes it was a solid four, and I think with a couple more changes it could easily be a 5.  Replaced water with chicken broth, changed green bell pepper to red, upped black pepper to a full tsp.  Added 1 tsp curry powder, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp celery seed, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 Tbsp minced garlic.  Next time will omit almonds and add sliced mushrooms and possibly spinach.

I thought this soup was absolutely delicious (and so did my boyfriend!).  I didn't use the almonds, and used dried instead of fresh parsley, and the soup came out great! DEFINITELY a keeper!

Delicious! A really filling, hearty soup. I added an 8 oz. container of sliced mushrooms, and it was very good; this would also be easy to add chicken to. Thanks for the great recipe; I will be making it quite often.

Best soup ever.  Used around half the cream and didn't buy celery as it is not in the ingred list but it is in the directions.

I liked this recipe, but only gave it 4 stars because it was not very flavorful. I added curry, per suggestion from another reviewer, and ditched the celery for Zucchini. Otherwise, this was a very good recipe and a big hit with the family.

This soup was so good! I reduced some almond milk on the stove, in place of the half-and-half, and didn't use slivered almonds or parsley and it was awesome! Rosemary also blends well with this soup.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I liked how I made it.  My husband has a gluten and lactose intolerance and so I left out the flour and cream.  For the liquid I only used chicken broth.  This soup was delicious! My kids even went back for another bowl.

We thought this soup was great.  My husband even said it was good enough to serve guests.  I think I may try cooked turkey in it next time.  Oh, I added a packet of seasoning from one of the wild rice boxes for extra flavor.
