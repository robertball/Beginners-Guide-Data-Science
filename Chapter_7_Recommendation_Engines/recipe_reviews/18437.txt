Very good...the ingredients go really well together.  The only thing I will do different next time is cut down the oil a little....

Mmmmm.  Very good!  The protions were a bit on the large size but that is just an observation, not a complaint.  I recommend you make enough of the dressing that you will have plenty leftover for other uses.  The tarragon really makes the dressing special.

Good Salad.  Next time I'll make the dressing with olive oil to make it healthier and serve the dressing on the side.

The dressing for this salad had way to much oil in it. I cut the oil down to 1 cup and add more mustard and it turned out pretty good.

The ingredients went well together, but the dressing is way too oily. I recommend adding olive oil and balsamic vinegar to taste instead of making the dressing.

Great salad!  Love the combo of flavors.  This can be easily cut in half for a smaller crowd.

I was really looking forward to this recipe; the mixture of ingredients is great but the dressing was a big let-down.  I would like to try this again with a much more flavorful and less greasy dressing.  As other reviewer suggested, I cut the oil in half, and still thought it was too greasy, esp with the avocados.  Also, it did not have much flavor.  Sorry, I really wanted to liek this recipe, but came out feeling let down.

The California Spinach Salad has become my family's favorite salad! I try to make it a bit healthier by using olive oil instead of vegetable oil for the dressing. I also offer the dressing on the side. This salad is so full of wonderful flavors it doesn't need so much added fat.
