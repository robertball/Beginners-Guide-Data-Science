I ALMOST rated this 4 stars! Unfortunately as others have noted - you have to add more water. It's not a big deal, true, but if you follow the recipe as written you have a dough and not a batter. It's more like 2 tablespoons. However,the flavor is wonderful and provided you fry it a slightly deep golden brown, provides a nice crispy crunch. I imagine this batter would be great on a lot of vegetables and will try experimenting!

These turned out excellent. I used white wine because Celeste drank all my red when she was here and didn't tell me. The batter was really too thick as written so I did have to add more wine and water to it, which kinda makes me want to lower the rating here - but since the problem is easily fixed and I don't see anyone else whining about it I'll leave it alone. I left out the parsley cuz I didn't have any. Thanks for the recipe!

I've never had fried mushrooms before but I saw this recipe and had to try it! It was absolutely delicious. Like everyone said, I did have to add a bit more water to the recipe, and i didn't have any red wine on hand so I substituted diluted red wine vinegar and it was yumyumyum!

I used Cab for the wine and swapped garlic powder for the minced because  I figured it would be better distributed in the batter. Had to thin the batter down, used white wine and some water for this because the red was gone. The wine in the batter was divine.  I had giant stuffing mushrooms so I quartered them, not the best of ideas because they started to weep mushroom juice making the batter lose the crisp, but that is my fault.

Very very good. Our Sonny's BBQ used to have fried mushrooms, and they redid their restaurant and took them off the menu. We've been craving a great mushroom recipe and these hit the spot!   I had to add some more water to get the batter just so, but that's of no consequence.   Great receipe!!!

My family loves mushrooms and every time we can we order them at restaurants. This is a restaurant quality recipe. I adjusted the water to 1 1/2 tblsp as suggested and I had a mixed herb seasoning that I used instead of the parsley. This recipe is going down in my family cookbook! I reheated in the oven the next day and they were just as good. We will be sharing this recipe with others. Thanks.

Flavor was good but, as others have noted, liquid measurment was way off.  And because they didn't crisp up as much as I like, I'm wondering if an "egg" was omitted from the ingredient list.  All batters I've ever made for deep frying include egg.  May give it another try with that addition.

I used this recipe with sliced portabello mushrooms.  I could taste some of the seasoning, but I think my choice in mushrooms was too heavy for this batter.  Next time, I think I'll add more garlic and cheese to it.  It was nice and crispy, however.  I did find that the batter retained way too much grease for my liking.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to tweak it a little so it doesn't absorb so much?  Yes, I did put the mushrooms on a wire rack after I took them out of the deep fryer and yes, I did wait until the grease was at 350 degrees.  Thanks so much.

I made these for my book club, our theme for dinner that evening was Southern foods.  I really did not know how these were going to turn out, but we all loved them!  Easy to do, too.  Thank you.

As others mentioned, this needs more water to make a batter.  I used cilantro instead of parsley, and crushed one large clove of garlic.  I was able to do probably 15 or more medium-small mushrooms and we served them with a creamy horseradish sauce.  They were great!

These are really, really good.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 50% more water in the batter.  Divine appetizer!

I added a 1/2 cup water to make this a batter rather then a dough.  I added garlic pepper because I was out of garlic. Oh my goodness no more $8.00 for 8 mushrooms for me.  I'll be making these at home from now on.  Great with Artichoke and spinach dip.   Very very good!

Delicious! I made these for my family after a long day of peeling off wallpaper and they were VERY well-received. The wine adds a really nice complexity and they really do cook through in about 5 minutes. I did end up adding more water to the batter and left out the Parmesan cheese because it didn't fit with the rest of my menu. If you want to take these even further, serve them with a creamy dipping sauce: sour cream, cream cheese (or mascarpone), chopped garlic, chopped parsley, minced shallot, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Heaven!

Didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. But they tasted good. But didn't get very brown.

I used this recipe, fried onions,  fried pickles and fried nushrooms. Had no parsley so I added 21 seasoning salute from Trader Joe's,  added pale ale beer because the batter was too thick and added sherry wine instead of the red wine.  Overall it was awesome.  Trying to post picture....Thx!

This was not a batter for mushrooms. It was too dry, and then with adding in the extra water that others recommended, the batter wouldn't stick to the mushrooms.

I really liked these, they had great flavor and crispiness as well.  I tried to experiment, using both fresh white mushrooms and canned...no contest of course, the fresh were sooo good.  I'll be trying onion rings using this same recipe.  The red wine was great, I added more than called for and that to me is the hero of this dish!  I'm guessing porabellas would taste great with this as well.

This was delicious.  I replaced the red wine and water with white wine.  I used baby bella mushrooms and next time I will use button mushrooms and add a little salt.  This is a keeper.

These were outstanding.  We did have to add more water though.  At first my husband did not want to use the red wine but I convinced him to try it.  Thank goodness because the wine is a really special touch!  I already bought more mushrooms to make this again.

I made these with dinner tonight they tasted great but I had problems with some of the batter coming off, I added extra water as suggested so that might be why. I will make this again

Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  Followed recipe except subbed Old Bay seasoning for the Kosher salt and just gave them a shallow fry, turning once during cooking.  Drained on wire rack.  The wine really gives it nice flavor.  Will make again.

The concept is great!  We love breaded mushrooms and these had great taste and presentation.   I usually just use pancake batter and didn't have red wine, so I used white cooking wine and a little water in my  Member's Mark buttermilk pancake batter.   Sprinkled in some Paula Dean's house seasoning and coated sliced fresh white mushrooms with the batter.   Fried crispy brown and had a really special flavor.  Thanks for sharing  you're flavorful and ultra easy idea!

My daughter and I are eating these as fast as I can make them! We are both big fans of fried morel mushrooms in the springtime,  but since we aren't getting them now, we have to settle for fried button mushrooms. I have never made them before, so this is the first recipe I've tried. I picked a good one! These are so good! The parmesan cheese definitely adds just the right flavor they need. You do need to add more water than the recipe calls for to make a batter, but that's an easy fix.

I made this as directed, but it looked so thick when I was done mixing the batter that I added some more wine, and some beer. I also just used small whole portabella mushrooms, rather than quartering them and they were fabulous- crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside- will definitely make again!! So Good!!
