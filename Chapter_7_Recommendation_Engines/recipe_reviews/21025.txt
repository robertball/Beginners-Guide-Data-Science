So yummy! This is a favorite of ours. I never buy frozen potatoes to make this, though. I always just use my own potatoes peeled, diced, and par-cooked on stove-top before baking. I must have made a hundred times already, and probably will make a few hundred more.

oh my gosh I just had this and it is sooooo good. Comfort food at it's best. I even used all lowfat/nonfat ingredients (fat free sour cream, fat free condensed soup, 1 cup fat free sharp cheddar, 1 cup 2% sharp cheddar, Simply Shredded frozen shredded potatoes, lowfat wheat thins made into crumbs in the food processor,  1/4 cup melted Smart Balance trans fat free margarine) and it was still SUPERB. I divided the mixture into 2 8"x8" pans and topped one with 1/2 the crumbs and 1/2 the melted margarine and baked it. The other pan is in the freezer with a baggy of the crumbs on top, ready to bake for another scrumptious meal. YUM!

This was a really good casserole. The potatoes were very moist and had lots of flavor. As my son puts it “the potatoes had yummy goop.”  I omitted the onion and it was great. I would say next time I am going to mix the butter in though because when you get the potatoes from the oven there is a ½ inch of grease sitting on top that is very unappealing. So, next time I will mix the butter instead of just drizzling it on top. Great recipe though, and I will defiantly make it again!

Very good!  My family puts french fried onions on the top instead of the crushed potato chips.  This adds a great flavor!

Unbelievable!! Delicious!!  I added a can of Campbell's Pepperjack cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken and used cornflakes instead of potato chips.  Have made it twice now and everyone still rants!  Don't forget to top it off with a little garlic salt!  Thank you Bea!!

I prepared this recipe with fat free sour cream, Health Request Chicken soup, and fat free Lays chips. It was delicious and it got rave reviews from my spouse and son. It was great warmed up the second time too.  Will definately make this again.

My aunt makes a casserole similar to this every year... all I can say is YUMMY! The potato chips really add to the whole potato theme and enhance the dish overall. A highly recommended indulgence!

I make a version of this that my husband's side of the family asks me to make EVERY year for Christmas...they call them "those amazing potatoes".  I buy the o'brien style of shredded hashbrowns that have the onion & green pepper in them. If you can't find them, put in your own onion&green pepper...it adds alot of flavor.  I never add butter to this dish, with all the cheese, sour cream & cream soup it's not necessary and you won't miss it, trust me! I also like to add fresh minced garlic to the mix...and I also never bother thawing out the hashbrowns as this recipie implies (with the need to press out the excess water) just mix it all together with the hashbrowns in their frozen state. Other soups work nicely, too. We have a vegetarian in the family so instead of cream of chicken I use cream of onion (great flavor booster!) cream of celery or cream of potato. Since I always double this for a crowd, I use two different types of soup. Cr. of onion is my favorite, though!  If you want crispy browned edges, remove the foil or lid half way through baking. When it's all bubbly & browned around the edges, it's done. It takes a little over an hour and when doubled, takes more like 1 1/2 hrs. or so.  I also think the chips make it too greasy. 2 cups of coursely crushed corn flakes (cereal) mixed with 1/2 c. melted butter is better, I think.  If you use durkee fried onions, put them on the last 10-15 min. or they will burn!  Don't forget to spray baking dish w/nonstick spray!!!!

By adding a jar of diced pimentos and a 2 TBLS of green onions, it really brought some color to this dish. Everyone was pleased with this sidedish and its so easy I would not hestitate to make it again! It's even good w/out the potato chips (and you can avoid addtl calories - if your counting them)!

This is a terrific recipe that is much like Cracker Barrel's Hashbrown Casserole.  I've made it many times (and shared the recipe, too).  
When I make it, I use less butter than called for.  I also use light or ff sour cream, healthy request cream of chicken soup, 2% cheddar cheese, and lowfat or ff cracker crumbs rather than potato chips for the topping.

Oh so rich and delicious!  Definitely not a diet casserole, but great for a pot luck or brunch.  I did not use butter or potato chips - instead I just topped with french fried onion rings as another reviewer suggested.  Made a double batch and a 9x13 pan and they came out great.

This was good and easy, too! I didn't have the cr of chicken soup so used cr of mushroom. And instead of chips, I used my small processor and whirred up some Ritz crackers for the topping.  Really good side dish!!

I've been making something similar to this for years.It's a favorite here. I use cream of mushroom or cream of celery soup,sour cream and I add ham.I put cheese in if I have it but it's good without it too.I have also used condensed cheese soup instead of the cheese.

I made this recipe withouth the crushed chips on top... only because I didn't have chips on hand.  Even without the chips, I rate this 5 stars!  I will try it next time with the chips as I see how they could only make the great recipe better.   Thanks for sharing!

I called my mother-in-law to get this recipe this evening because it's a favorite on that side of the family.  I have to take a potato to a potluck and this is perfect.  We use O'Brien potatoes and I omit the onion.  Also, one year there was nothing for the topping but Cinnamon Toast Crunch, so we used that and it was actually tasty!  We have made it that way ever since! ;-)  Enjoy!

Recipe was super easy to make and was delicious.  I used 1 c mozarella and 1 c sharp cheddar.  It made the potatoes more white with yellow threads running through - very pretty.  Also, I didn't add any butter (already fatty enough!)and I used sweet maui onion potato chips crumbled on top and it was SOOO good.  My boyfriend likes ham so I used two 8X8 dishes, one with added ham and one without.  Great recipe - will use again and again.  I  might try adding broccoli or spinach next time for an easy veggie.

I neglected to use any chips and it was delicious.  I also went a little shy on the sour cream, and used extra cheddar. I used the frozen "O'brien hashbrowns" with bell peppers just like some others recommended and it had terrific flavor.  I also used cream of celery soup---SUPERB. Thank you for such a quick and easy recipe. It was gone in a matter of minutes!

This is one of my favorite recipes. My version is the same except it has a sleeve of townhouse crackers on top instead of the potato chips.

Not sure where I went wrong?  It was not a hit in my house.  My kids said it had too much onion flavor and I thought the chips on top were gross.  I did use fresh potatoes because I had a ton of them in the pantry.  Maybe you have to use frozen for it to taste right?  Oh well...too bad.

OMG!! This is the Bomb. I had to modify for what I had on hand. I used cr-o mushroom, only had 1/2 cup sour cream so I used that and french onion dip. Also, I used a blended colby-mont/jack cheese. Topped it with Sour Cream-Onion chips. Omitted the salt & pepper. Oh, and I used fresh diced potatoes. No Leftovers!! Rave reviews from my guests. Huge Winner!!! Thanks Bea!!!!New tradition for us!!!Love it!!

I made this dish for a cookout over the weekend and everyone commented on how good it was.  My only change was to add french fried onions on top instead of the potato chips.  I think next time I will add some spices to give the dish a little zip, as I thought the dish was good but it did not have alot of flavor.

I love this recipe and I have also used the O'Brian type of hashbrowns and skipped adding onions. Adds a slightly different flavor. Both versions are very good!

We all really liked this casserole, but in the future, I will heat the potatoes on the stove before putting them in the oven.  Even after an hour, the potatoes were a little cold.  I thought they were mostly thawed...but I guess not.

I have been making this potato casserole for a few years now.  I omitted the butter and chips.  I sometimes add small cubes of ham. Delicious. Family loves them. I will be making it with the potato chips for Christmas.

I personally wasn't a big fan of these. The sour cream taste was just too prevalent in the dish for my tastes, so if I made it again I would probably reduce the amount.  I like sour cream, but not THAT much.  I did like the idea of using potato chips to create a crunchy crust on a casserole so I may use that in the future.  My husband liked them a lot (4 1/2 stars, he said) but I guess it depends on your tastes. DON'T make this if you don't like sour cream.

We've made this recipe for years because everyone loves it. I add dried onions, and sometimes diced ham to make a complete meal. Crushed cornflake-type cereal works well as a topping, too. I also leave out the melted butter and haven't noticed that the casserole tastes worse, because the cheese adds the fat. It's called "Funeral Potatoes" here because it's a staple, always served at dinners for families after a funeral.

I love this recipe. It's very close to a recipe my mom has been making for years except she uses plain corn flakes instead of the potato chips. Much better that way.

This was very delish!  I didn't have any hash brown potatoes so I peeled and diced some of my own potatoes then par boiled them.  Mixed everything together and baked as instructed. Very good.

I have been making a similar recipe for years.  This is a favorite of everyone.  I substitute velveeta for the cheddar cheese and crushed cornflakes instead of the potato chips.  Also, no onion is in mine since my husband can't stand it.  A definite keeper.

I didn't thaw the potatoes and it came out just fine. I used potatoes O'Brien and skipped the onion since those already have peppers and onions in them. I've also made without the potato chips and it's still yummy! Just mix the butter in with everything else!

This is the closest recipe I could find here that matches the recipe my mom got at a recipe exchange. Great to see it's so hughly rated!! The only changes were mine called for "one large box of thawed frozen hashbrowns"; prabably just a four ounce box. Also, mine calls for one cup of sour cream. I don't know if a pint would be the same measurement or not..so there you go!! THANKS :]

First attempt - GROSS so I made it again today hoping I'd messed it up the first time.  Unfortunately, I still don't care for it.  It's definitely easy but in this case, a waste of ingredients.

This is pretty much the recipe I use but with a few changes.  First, I don't ever thaw out the hash browns (though it would probably be much easier to mix up if i did), I don't add onion, I add 1 stick of butter, softened and then i use 8 ounces of sour cream AND 8 ounces of french onion dip (which adds a nice little something extra).  With the topping I usually crush enough chips into the melted butted to cover the entire dish (a bit more messy this way but all the chips get coated with butter and I like it that way).  I also a few times have used sour cream & onion chips just for a little more flavor. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I bake at 350 for 1 hour exactly and it comes out perfect every time!

This was really good. I cut back the onions to 1/4 c because my kids don't like it that much and I also omit the melted butter because it is completely unnecessary. It also reheats pretty well in the microwave the next day. After that, the chips get a little soggy. One thing to note is that you can definitely taste the sour cream. Sometimes I can sneak it into recipes and my husband (who hates it) doesn't even notice it's there. I didn't even bother trying to get him to tastes this one because I knew he'd hate it. I love it though and will definitely be making this again. My picky toddlers also liked it.

This was a great dish! I used real potatos and added green bell peppers and corn. Add a little extra cooking time (30 minutes) for the potatos, but well worth the wait.

I'm just now learning too cook, as I am getting married in a few months. This is the perfect dish for those who are learning to cook, and aren't all that great at it (yet)! It's very simple and tastes great. I used tortilla chips because that's all I had, worked great. I also used about 1/2 stick of butter, as one stick seems like a LOT! Fiance loves it as well. I will be making this again.

OH yeah....this is good.  I omitted the butter (couldn't see how it would improve the already fat-laden dish) and I don't think it was missed.  This isn't something I'd make often, but it sure would make a great company dish.

I make this every christmas and it's always loved by all. I use "ore-Ida potatoes O'brien" instead of hash browns,(they give it extra flavor with the red and green peppers and onions) velveeta cheese and cheese potato chips on top. It's a great dish and very easy to prepare ahead of time... top with the melted butter and crushed potato chips just before baking.

Delicious! I live in the Netherlands and can't always get all of the exact ingredients for these recipes but I substituted cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken and it was delicious! I'm sure I didn't even miss the C of Chicken soup! My husband thought it was delicious. I did use corn flakes on the top instead of potato chips (less salt) and this was very good. I made it together with (the absolute best) the Garlic Chicken recipe on this site and added a green salad and it was a great, easy dinner!! I baked them both together and that worked out fine. Thank you!!

This was good, and I will probably make it again.  Wasnt a huge hit with my kids, but my husband loved it.  Next time I think I will cook it just a tiny bit longer or put it under the broiler to add just a little crust.

We didn't put butter over the chips on top.  It turned out great without the added calories.  We are going to try it without the chips next time.

I use less butter, and one can of cream of chicken, one can of cream of celery.  I also sometimes sub out potato chips for French's onions, and sometimes add diced cooked ham.  Anyway you make it is comfort food at it's best.

I made this as directed and it was just ok for us.  I have two teeagers on the thin side so they can afford the extra calories but I didn't care for the potato chips on top... had quite a few leftovers that I had to throw away.

I  make this twice a year; Thanksgiving and Easter.

I make it the full fat way or the reduced fat way and top it with buttered crumbs.It is always a hit.

Amazing casserole!  I made some changes for missing ingredients, but the essence was exactly the same.

Instead of 2 cups sour cream, I used 2 cups low-fat yogurt.  Instead of 2 cups crushed potato chips, I used 1 cup crushed Lays and 1 cup crushed rice Chex, mixed together.  I didn't have enough hash browns, so I used leftover polenta to make up the difference.  I didn't have fresh cheese, so I used an extra macaroni flavoring packet I had saved and 2 slices of American cheese, cut into small pieces and blended in.

I also added diced ham and a sprinkling of garlic salt and onion powder.  I took many reviewers' advice and stirred in the butter to the casserole instead of adding it in later.  I didn't have any grease on top.  Next time, though, I think I will add a little pre-cooked rice to soak up the excess moisture; I found the texture a little too loose.  I like a firm casserole.

All in all, this recipe competes with or tops my family's long-standing cream-cheese based cheesey hash brown casserole.  I am in love!  Will definitely make again!

My mother in law went for seconds! Also, I put half in a Ziploc bag and am freezing it. So I only used 8x8 pan. It was the perfect amount, and now i have this to use for another dinner.

I cut down just a tad on the butter and sour cream and it was still delicious. It's also very important to defrost the potatoes so they don't take longer than the recommended time to cook. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks

This recipe was a big hit at one of my many work potlucks. To this day, they still beg me to make this. I use cream of celery soup instead of the cream of chicken soup since I don't eat meat. This is the bomb!

If you want the kids to eat this one omit the onions and replace 2 cups of crushed cornflakes instead of potato chips (definitely keep the drizzled melted butter on top), without the onions & with the replacement of corn flakes instead of chips, also the kids like it with a much milder cheese (like american or velveeta) with a few adjustments our young ones love this dish!

This was pretty good but I did omit the potato chips on top. Something about potato chips just turned me off. Seemed to be missing a little something but not too sure what it is. (heck, could be the potato chips) I think next time I will try it with Condensed Cheese soup versus the chicken soup.  I had peas as a vegie and ended up just mixing my peas in there....

I think it would also be a good brunch if you mixed in cooked ground sausage. mind you, I would omit the butter if you do that. Would be WAY too greasy. Hope my review helps you

When we had unexpected guest for dinner, I had to find something I could make with ingredients on hand. I had everything to make this except the frozen hashbrowns so I grated fresh potatoes in the food processor and used them. It turned out delicious! In fact, it was so good that our guests took the leftovers home with them!! Thanks Bea, this one's a keeper.

I have made this several times and each time it is a knockout. I have occasionally doubled for large family gatherings and used Cream of Mushroom instead of a second can of Cream of Chicken. I usually don't have any leftovers.

This is every bit as good as everyone said!  I made a few changes - added dried chives, diced ham to mix, then crumbled cheddar cheese potato chips on top.  Very yummy, lots of compliments.

Awesome! I doubled the recipe for my SuperBowl party and it was gone right away. Had tons of people ask for the recipe. Went over very well and soo easy to make. Used baked chips on top and then drizzled butter over it. Definitely make it again!

This was a great side dish to my ham on New Years, but I did use fresh potatoes. I will make again.

Everyone I know just RAVES about this dish,  every time I make it! It’s so flexible too, and this is a good base recipe… Sometimes I add ham & swiss, sometimes I add taco meat and top with Doritos (even substitute some of the soup/sour cream with queso) for a Mexican flair. You can pretty much change it up any way you want and it always turns out super nummy! I do cut way back on the amount of butter, and there are many ways (as mentioned in the other reviews) to make it much more healthy... every variation I’ve tried has turned out great. Try with different meats, cheeses, seasonings, toppings… If you like creamy potatoes, you can turn this recipe into anything you want it to be! I haven’t tried adding cooked chicken yet, but I’m sure that will be delicious too. Add some carrots, peas, celery…Change it up and make it your own! Five stars all the way from my friends and family!

Delicious. Instead of 1/2 cup of melted butter, I just dotted the top with butter and then sprinkled Paramesan Cheese and then added the crushed potato chips on top.

Love this casserole. I change it a bit by using green onions and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Taste like stuffed baked potatoes.

Great potato recipe. Used O'Brian potatoes instead of adding onion, and cream of celery soup. Loved it! I did add the butter over the chips, and the top crisped nicely after I finished the cooking with a few minutes on convection. After reading the other reviews, I think next time I'll try leaving out the butter.

This is a fantastic recipe, and can be varied to taste by switching up the ingredients. Not too expensive to make, and we always have leftovers, so it's good for at least two meals. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good cheesy potatoes.  I used salt and vinegar chips and it gave it some nice flavor.

I've been making a slightly different version of this basic recipe for years. It's always a big hit with both young and old. I use fresh potatoes instead of the frozen hash browns. Then I add red and green bell peppers. The peppers give it good color and flavor. I mix the melted butter in with the soup. I also use cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. I use a very good quality cheddar cheese because if you use a cheaper brand it just gets oily and doesn't melt well. I use slightly crushed corn flakes instead of the potato chips. In my opinion it's too salty with chips. For an even heartier, main course version I add cubed ham to this casserole.

Easy to throw together - I actually mixed up the soup, sour cream, cheese and onion on my lunch break threw it in the refrigerator and when I got home added the potatoes.  Next time I'll experiment with different cheeses and throw in some red pepper flake for a little pizzaz.

I made this as written and thought it was pretty good. My family liked it, too. Only gave it 3 stars because I'm not in a hurry to make it again.

Next time I will substitute lower fat sour cream, cheese and soup, and maybe skip the butter and chips (but having something that 'sinful' was kinda fun, so I make keep them).

A good recipe to take to a covered dish as it is "different" but "basic."
It's not an "outstanding, just love it type-of-dish" but it was completely eaten at my family reunion, so it is a good one to use.  I hope that makes sense!

Very, very good -- would have given it a 5 but my 9 year old daughter just didn't care for these.  Maybe a bit too much "sour cream" taste (which I love).  The onions are WONDERFUL in these -- next time I'll add more and maybe some dried minced onion.  Really good reheated in microwave, too.

I also used cream of mushroom soup instead since I am a vegetarian.  It was amazing!  Brought it to a church potluck and it disappeared next to other potato casseroles. The onions are a necessity.  I think the flavor might be a little bland without them.

Mmmmm, so good and so fattening! I omit the butter. We love this. I bring hash browns to room temperature before mixing and bake for 30 - 45 minutes.

This has been a family favourite, but we have always called it Schwartse.  Its delicious, we have it with ham to replace scalloped potatoes, and its even more delicious warmed up as leftovers.

Very nice side dish.  I substituted green onions for enhanced flavor and added Emeril's seasoning.  Tried crushed cornflakes instead of the potato chips and it turned out great.

This was excellent with healthy modifications.  I substituted fat free sour cream, and fat free cream of chicken soup.  Next time I'll try using lite cheese too.  Also, I only used about a tablespoon of butter and 1/3 of the chips called for. Was excellent!  Everyone loved it and it didn't taste a bit healthier.

I've made this twice now...always good. The potato chips add a lot of salt though...might try crackers instead next time...

I used two similar recipes and tweeked them both a tad so I will review both. We really, really liked these potatoes. I used potatoes O'Brian (frozen with peppers and onion) and didn't add any additional onions. Next time, I will add some more onion or onion powder. Went well with BBQ sandwiches. On top, I did a mixture of potato chips and corn flakes (good color) and think next time, I will also add some of those french fried onions in with the mix. I reduced the butter and also mixed it in. Think this would go well at a brunch as well as on the dinner table. Makes a lot and seems to reheat very well.

This was awesome!!!! My dad is very picky and does not like to try new things and he LOVES it! It even does well when reheated. We had a little left over since it makes so much and we stuck it back in the oven the next night and it was just as good. I will make this again for sure!

Made this dish for Christmas Eve with pork tenderloin roast. Only change I made was to combine monterey jack and cheddar. Outstanding! Everyone loved the potatoes and most had seconds.  Will definitely make again and add to my favorites.

We have used this recipe for years, and it's always a hit. It makes a nice side dish for any meal. The only change is that we use crushed corn flakes in place of chips.

I made this for Christmas as a side dish, everyone seemed to enjoy it. I added a little more sour cream, and as suggested earlier, added the butter in with the mix. Will make this again.

Yummy!!! This was so good. Instead of using potato chips I used Ritz wheat crackers. I also didn't use as much butter as it called for and it turned out amazing. Thanks! I plan to make this for my next family gathering.
