This was a very tasty smoothie. When you freeze the bananas make sure you cut them up first because, as i found out, it is very difficult to peel a frozen banana. I used light yogurt and it turned out very well.

This smoothie is absolutely DELICIOUS!  Since I really got on a "smoothie kick" this year, I decided to fix different ones for my parents while we were visiting.  This recipe was definitely a favorite with everyone.  Even my husband, who would never try any of the different smoothies I fixed, decided to try this one and he even liked it.  Have made it several times.  I used lowfat vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  Thanks for sharing.

This made a great breakfast for me. I used frozen strawberries, one non frozen banana, fat free yogurt a package of sugar free Instant Breakfast instead of the syrup and a splash of milk to thin it a bit. So good and thanks Cindy!

I wanted to just add a quick comment about freezing bananas. I use to make smoothies all the time and if you peel the banana FIRST, then freeze it wrapped in saran wrap it works great!

Easy! 

I've tried about 5 other Strawberry-Banana smoothie combo in Allrecipes, and this by far tops the list. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I use fresh bananas, and low fat vanilla yogurt. The kids love it! They practically beg me to make this every single day.  I can't get them to eat fresh strawberries, but this works much better!
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My daughter loved this. I changed it by using a non-frozen banana, fresh strawberries, non-fat vanilla yogurt, s little skim milk, and a serving of Olvotine instead of the syrup. It was great! Thanks for the base recipe!

My daughter enjoyed, used frozen strawberries and frozen banana. Added more choco. syrup and used 1% milk instead of yogurt since it was all I had. Not too sweet, but yummy.

This smoothie was so good! I did have to add a splash of milk to the blender to get things moving. My husband claims it tastes like a chocolate covered strawberry, which he loves!

Loved this! Just the right hint of chocolate, not too sweet. The banana adds sweetness without being noticeable, tastewise. Perfect.

This is a yummy smoothie.  I halfed the recipe to make one serving and needed to add 1/4 cup of skim milk to get it moving in the blender.  This one is a keeper.

I made this using only 1 banana, 1/2 cup frozen strawberries, 1 tsp. cocoa (instead of the syrup), a packet of Splenda, and 1 cup plain yogurt, and I drank the entire thing! All flavors come through without any one overpowering the other.

Meh. Nothing special. Just a plain 'ol smoothie, nothing more. My blender recently broke. Today, my fiance bought me a new KitchenAid one (whoo hoo!). I just HAD to try it out! I didn't hate this, but I certainly have had better. For one, I couldn't detect the chocolate - at ALL!. I was really hoping for a chocolate-covered strawberry flavor, but all I could taste was banana. Perhaps my banana was too large (in my defense, this recipe doesn't specify whether it should be large, medium or small...)??? I DO like the creaminess the banana and yogurt gave this tho. And, after adding another good squirt more of chocolate syrup (swirled into my smoothie), I got more of the effect I was looking for. If you are wanting the chocolate flavor to come thru, I think you could substitute chocolate yogurt for plain (I used vanilla as it's all I had on hand). From now on, I'm going to stick with strawberry oatmeal breakfast smoothie (ASTROPHE). It fills me up more and is much healthier to boot (it contains oatmeal for nutrition / filler, genius IMHO). I'd rather not waste calories on chocolate that I can't even taste anyways! NOTE: If you freeze your fruit (unpeel your bananas!!!), your smoothie will be extra thick and very cold! Thanks for sharing your idea, AHMOM. :)

This is a very yummy smoothie! I used one fresh bananna, 1/2 cup of strawberries, 1 cup of plain yogurt, two teaspoons of sugar, and I added chocolate to taste. It was quick to make and very enjoyable to devour!

Pretty yummy recipe! I used a lil less banana and vanilla yogurt and that was still good. Very thick! You really need to freeze the strawberries too and freeze them until very frozen to make it colder.

I usually make these for my breakfast.  This really isn't a breakfast smoothie.  Followed recipe, and added cocoa (unsweetened) with 2 splenda packs since I don't have syrup in the house.  Too chocolately.  I added ice and a little oatmeal so I could get something in for breakfast.  If I make this again, I would use half of the cocoa (1/2tsp) and not use it for breakfast.  Otherwise, good for a afternoon treat

This was good to drink on a hot day!!  I used fat free strawberry yogurt instead of plain.  I would recommend adding a little bit of milk if using both frozen strawberries and bananas, or leave one of the fruits fresh so that the blender will blend better.

Mmmmmm!  What a good smoothie!  I had it for breakfast today.  I didn't have a whole cup of yogurt, so I used 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and 1/2 cup of milk.  Even if I did have the full 1 cup of yogurt, I would recommend adding some milk to thin it a bit.  I also peeled my bananas, wrapped them in saran wrap, then froze them overnight.

This is a super recipe, however, I needed to add some milk for my blender to process the mixture. The yogurt did not provide enough liquid.

I used one unfrozen banana, because I think two would have been too much. I have a little "Shake N'Take" blender, so I can't fit much in it. It took a while to blend everything together, and it was very thick, maybe add a bit of milk if you had the same problem I had. But when I tried it: D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! Delicious!

I found that this recipe was a very thick smoothie. Almost like a milkshake. I added about 2 Tbsp of milk to the smoothie and it was a much better consistency! Overall, good recipe.

Sounds awesome,  this is almost my normal smoothie mix. Normally do 1 cup fzn Strawberries with One fresh or frozen banana, never added the chocolate before, is awesome. Peel the bananas before you freeze them and it is simple to break them and throw them in.  I peel and freeze all bananas once they start to get over ripe.

Pretty good; I left out the banana (personal taste). Will use this recipe again.
