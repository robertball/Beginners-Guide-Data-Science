My husband and kids - all VERY picky eaters - LOVED these! The only change I made was I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef... These are a hit, thanks for the recipe! I’ll try adding bacon next time....

They sounded so good but were disappointing.  As some others noted they were very cake like and on the dry side.  Bacon may help but I am not sure.  I may try them again but will need to figure out how not to have them be so dry.  Maybe extra meat or some chopped mushrooms.

Not bad. As other reviewers stated, they are only as big as you fill the mini muffin cup. So, fill them full and rounded over to look like a muffin.  Next time, we'll try adding bacon like others suggested.

I have to agree with lutzflcat on some of the points made. 
These cheeseburgers were okay.  They were too dry and cakey thick, not much flavor and I would have liked the cheese to be more melted. I ended up making 54 of them. Now I did substitute the ground beef with ground turkey and I used mozzarella  cheese instead of cheddar.  Those changes may have caused some of my dislikes.  

Here  are the steps with picturesI followed: http://ibakeandrate.com/easy-cheeseburger-mini-muffins/

12.19.15   I followed this recipe to the letter and, honestly, was a little disappointed.  Just a couple tips:  you don’t get much rise on the muffins, so do fill each mini-muffin cup to the top.  Also, they don’t spread out, so be sure that the top of each muffin is smoothed out for a nicer presentation because it’s going to come out of the oven looking like it did when it went in (hope that makes sense).  I checked these muffins at 13 minutes, and they already were overdone and too brown IMO, so watch your time. I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings, so I should have ended up with 12 mini muffins.  I ended up with 30 which almost makes me wonder if the author meant regular sized muffins??? These aren’t bad, but they just didn’t have as much flavor as I was anticipating.  Missing something, just not sure what else would kick up the flavor.  This is the first review on this recipe, and I don’t want to discourage others from giving it a try.  This simply didn’t live up to my expectations. Lori P, sorry for the somewhat critical comments, but I do want to give an honest review.
