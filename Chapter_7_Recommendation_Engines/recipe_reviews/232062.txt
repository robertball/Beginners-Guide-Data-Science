Wonderful!!  I was really intimidated by the thought of caramelizing sugar but I survived and did it correctly!! The taste and texture of this dessert is amazing. I will definitely make this again!  Thank you for your recipe and the video that showed me exactly how to do it.

Amazing recipe. Simple enough for a thirteen year old girl to make. I just left out the orange cognac. I had to make the caramelized sugar 3 times to get it right, but clean up was really easy. I just soak everything in boiling hot water. The sugar comes right off no scrubbing needed!

Lovely dessert to impress people. I used heavy cream instead of creme fraiche and vanilla and orange extracts instead of orange cognac.

Flavour was fantastic. I might have over-whipped the custard, because it was very airy and full of volume. So it filled 5 ramekins instead of 4. However, they were fully cooked by 35 mins and the top frothy part had gone chewy and looked unappealing. I scraped it off and then the flavour and texture underneath were heavenly. The individual desserts once upended from the small ramekins was only about 1/2 inch thick. I'll try it again with less beating next time. Caramel was easy and perfect.

Amazing and delectable. One of the best desserts I have ever tasted, let alone cooked. I was a bit scared of making the caramel, but it was easier than making a pancake. Really a stunning (and stunningly easy) dessert.

I make this all the time just for myself on the rare instance I want something sweet. It's light, fresh, and just enough (with three left over). You can make your own creme fraiche very easily.  One of my top two fave desserts from chef john.

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup heavy cream for the creme fraiche. When melting sugar for caramel follow the directions and do not stir. I have made this twice and it was set at 40 minutes. My Family loved it.

My 6th grade daughter has to make a dish for her beginning French class at school and she chose this.  I thought it might be a bit too ambitious for her, but she insisted she wanted to try. When I found the Chef John version with video, I knew we'd be ok.  My daughter watched the video a couple of times with me and pretty much (with some supervision and hovering over her shoulder) did the whole thing herself.  I thought the results were great.  She really didn't know what it was supposed to taste like and I think she thought the caramel would be more like the sticky  on the outside of a caramel apple, but the rest of us thought it was amazing.  I only got 1/2 serving b/c my husband had dipped into mine after consuming his serving.  I can't wait for my daughter to make this for her 80 year old grandmother (her favorite dessert to order in restaurants) and see what she thinks.

I was so pleased this came out just right despite me not having any orange cognac for my creme caramels. I first made a batch and my boyfriend and I had them warm, it was good, but I felt like my impatience to not chill it was a mis-step.

 So, I made a second batch, and it was in the ramikens covered in my fridge for about 24 hours. This produced the most delicious result. It is nearly an erotic experience eating this dish. It really is a dish to impress the spouse with. Luckily it is not very complicated to make. 

Tip: To get the caramel sugar off your pan, put your faucet on the hottest setting and let heat melt it away. No need to scrub.

I have a small variation on the ingredients (Brazilian flan), but the making of caramel reminds me of exactly how my Mom used to make it.  It is perfect and the most delicious creme caramel ever.  Congrats, Chef John!

The caramel took much longer than I expected -- about 20 minutes -- but the end product was delicious. A great use for the creme fraiche  I made a few days ago.

I thought I had found my holy grail creme caramel recipe -- until I tried Chef John's! This creme caramel has much more depth and richness than other recipes I have tried in the past. This is a memorable version of such a classic dessert. Love!!

So very tasty and the perfect excuse to always have creme fraiche un the fridge at all times. I've made it twice now. First time with milk as asked and it was great. Second time i was out of milk so i used almond coconut milk. Tasted just as good but didn't hold together as well. Thanks chef John!

This is my favorite dessert!  So good!  Would be an impressive dessert to make for company. Fairly simple, but I would definitely suggest watching the video beforehand. I have been impressed with many of Chef John's recipes.

Absolutely phenomenal! Custard is so velvety & delicious.  Caramel was a bit tricky. I burnt it the first time because I waited for one last chunk of sugar stuck to the side to melt - big mistake.

The first time I tried this recipe, I botched it big time. The caramel burned and you haven't lived until you taste burnt sugar. The custard was wonderful, however, so I tried again and this time it was perfectly amazing. I didn't have whole milk so I mixed a dash of heavy cream with 1% mile and that worked fine. We can thank Chef John once again for a reliable recipe. If there was a slight problem, it was clean-up duty. I think maybe the Chef has minions to clean the dried caramel out of the ramikins.

I chill it before serve, the problem is when it chilled the caramel stick on the bottom of the ramekins, caramel is glass-like, it's a pity not only can't eat the creme with more caramel, but also very hard to wash them down. the taste is Soooo delicious!
