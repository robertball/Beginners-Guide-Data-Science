Good basic lasagna recipe.  Definitely use more sauce than suggested - I usually use at least 2 jars.
A hint when using no-boil noodles to keep them from being crunchy or gummy: coat the bottom of the pan with sauce BEFORE you lay the noodles in the pan.  I also mix the sausage (or beef or turkey) in with the sauce and always place the sauce on the noodle layer.  It's the sauce that gets absorbed by the noodles and cooks them (hence why you need plenty of sauce).

This was simple and very good.  A suggestion for "empty-nesters":  It's just my hubby and I, so when I make lasagne, I use 4 9 x 5 foil loaf pans.  I put some sauce on the bottom, 1 no-boil noodle, and continue layering, using 3 noodles per loaf pan.  Bake one, and freeze the rest.  When you want to fix on of the frozen ones, put in in the fridge the night before.  And for those who had trouble with the no-boil noodles, if you let them soak for a few minutes in hot water it will solve the problem.  Still a lot simpler and faster than boiling.

Ok, you won't want to believe this..i didn't either until I tried it myself. Use any of your fav lasagna noodles. They do NOT have to be labeled no-boil. I use any i want and you don't have to use xtra sauce -- they'll be cooked. Try it!!

I thought this was so close to mine, that I had to try it. It was very good, but for me, I needed more. First of all, I don't understand why people pay that extra price for the "no boil" noodles. Regular lasagna noodles work just fine. I don't even place them in a bowl of hot water. Just place some sauce in the bottom of pan and lay noodles (not touching) to make room for growth. Then I added hamburger, to the sausage, and cottage cheese, black olives and spinach to the cheese mix. I always mix the four cheeses, and an egg or two, with the drained spinach and black olives and cheeses. Then I mix the sauce with the hamburger and sausage. Then I only have one bowl & one pan to clean up. I too needed extra sauce. Sometimes I make my own, (if I have all day, as the sauce does need to simmer for at least 3 or 4 hours) I layer sauce, noodles, cheese mix, more sauce, noodles and keep on going until all is gone. then top with lots of mozzarella. Cover and bake until really bubbly, and remove cover and cook some more for about 15 minutes to get the cheese cooked. I personally like the cheese a bit crunchy. GREAT recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

The directions do not call for enough sauce. You will need to add more. I can't tell you how much more because that is based on personal preference. Overall the recipe came out tasting alright.

My family loved it!  Again added a little something to it!  Cooked the noodles first just because I've had no luck with the no boil type.  Also I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic to the meat as it browned for flavor.  I added 1 box of thawed frozed spinach squeezed dry on top of one layer of ricotta (just to sneak in vitamins).  I ended up using a bottle and a half of marinara sauce and extra mozzarrella.  All in all very yummy and easy.  Made enough for many left overs!

Just like the title states, this lasagna is fabulous and foolproof! I added more cheese, more sauce, and made a layer of fresh spinach in the center. I didn't have any problems with the no-boil noodles... they were perfect! I baked mine a bit longer (45 minutes with foil, 15 without).

Make sure you completely cover the noodles with sauce before baking to will keep them from getting crunchy.  And, I often use more sauce than the recipe calls for.  It just depends on your own taste.

I really liked this recipe.  I thought it was pretty easy, and it's my first lasagna.  I used more sauce, like the other reviewers suggested, and covered the noodles completely, and it came out great!  Thanks for submitting it!

This is my first attempt at Lasagna and I thought it turned out wonderful.  I used a bit more spaghetti sauce because my family likes lots of sauce (I used about 24 oz.)  For those of you that feel the need to give a low rating to a recipe you've never made (special shout out to Paula G and Claylady), I wish folks would just stick to giving feedback on their actual experiences with the recipe as written, not with your disdain for the ingredients.  All of us reject tons of recipes all the time because they don't sound like something we would like - what we don't do is give them a low rating without even trying them.

A rare event was having all the ingredients on hand including the ricotta which hubby mistakenly purchased instead of the "cottage cheese" which was on his grocery list.  Lucky us! Then, something to feed 3 starving kids after an afternoon of swimming lessons and pool cavorting, this was an answer to a prayer.  Enough leftover for a nice serving for Hubby's lunch the next day. Fast, easy, and delicious.  Can't ask for more.  Many thanks!!

Okay, this is a secret, so don't tell anyone: Instead of just mozarella cheese, use a few deli slices of provolone and/or swiss. They add more flavor and stringyness. Also, mix most of the parmesan with the ricotta. It adds the salt it needs. Don't forget parsley. Try sauted onions and mushrooms.

This sounds pretty much like the lasagna I make...I DO have one suggestion....after you take this out of the oven...please WAIT about 15 minutes before you cut it.  It will be difficult to wait....but...the fact that it holds firmly together after you cut it will make the wait worth it.

Really good recipe here. My points: 1)You may use any lasagna noodles--not just the ones labeled "oven ready." 2)You will need more sauce than called for 3) Put sauce on the bottom of the pan first, before the noodles, so they don't burn/crunch up 4) I did half & half ground chuck and sausage in mine. Delicio! Really a very good base recipe for a lasagna!

Yep, it's TRUE.  You can use ANY lasagna noodle, does NOT have to say no-boil. A long time ago I asked a chef friend of mine how the lasagna in restaurants are nice and firm and at home it gets soupy?  He told me not to cook the noodles!  Been doing it for years. Great time saver!

Simple and so delicious. Like many others, I doubled the sauce and the ricotta mixture, and added a layer of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed) to the middle. A keeper for sure!

When I first used this recipe, I danced around my kitchen.  This was the first time I made a lasagna that was awesome!  Like so many others, I doubled the sauce and cheese mixture.  I have made this recipe too many times to count.  I've also added spinach a time or two.  I've shared this with a co-worker who's just learning to cook.  I can hardly wait to hear about her experience.  Hands down, this is the easiest recipe and it's tasty!

This turned out great! We're not meat lovers, so I only used 1/2 lb of Turkey Italian sausage, and added 4 garlic cloves and a small onion while browning. I used a jar and a 1/2 of sauce total, adding one jar to the sausage mixture. I coated the bottom and the final top layer with the remaining sauce. I slightly overlapped the lasagna noodles, using 4 per layer - 16 total. I used regular lasagna noodles! I like a 6-Cheese Italian blend, instead of plain mozzarella. And broiled on high for the last 5 minutes. My husband said it tasted like restaurant quality! Tons of flavor.

I'll give this a 5-star rating, since it was so tasty that I wanted to eat it all in one sitting (it lasted me for three dinners). It might not be the most authentic, complex lasagna around, but the easiness of the recipe, and the yummy results, warrant a high rating from me.
I made it almost exactly as written. For the sausage, I used 1 lb. of bulk mild Italian sausage, instead of buying links and removing their casings. For the ricotta, I could only find 15 oz. containers, just a little bit short of the required "1 pint". Even so, I would have thought 1 pint would be kind of skimpy on the ricotta - fine by me, since I think many lasagnas have too much ricotta for my taste. And I've never seen a 16-ounce jar of spaghetti sauce, so I measured it out from a 24 oz. jar. I think what made this lasagna especially good in my eyes was the generous amount of sausage used. Also, I just used a generic spaghetti sauce and it was still great - how much better would it be if I used a high-quality sauce? In a nutshell, I highly recommend this, and think I might make it again one of these days.

The recipe calls for 16 ounces of sauce? Seriously?  That wouldn't be enough to do a third of it!  I ended up using 2 (26 oz) jars, but you could probably get away with 1 1/2 (26 oz) jars.  I added 1/2 cup of the Parmesan to the ricotta mixture, but otherwise left the proportions the same.  The ratio was appropriate and overall the dish got great reviews from my friends.

The basic ingredients are there, the sauce needs to be increased x2. Beware of the no boil noodles, as they absorb a large amount of sauce. Also with no boil noodles, don't make your lasagna a night before or even hours, as they will absorb even more sauce. Sticking with the boil noodles, really eliminates any possibility for disappointment and  your assured of a moist lasagna with flavor, for the extra step.

This was absolutely foolproof!  made it for New Years Eve and the only addition I made was a half pound of ground pork(to give more flavor to the sausage!)It was even better after it had "sat" a few hours and became more "solid".  Guests raved about it, and made many to-go requests!!!!!

Great Recipe! Thanks to the members for telling us that regular noodles work the same as no bake noodles. It will save me some money.

Good recipe! I will add a little more ricotta next time. I didnt have enough to make a good thick layer. I did add more sauce as other reviews recommended and my noodles turned out good.

If you are going to add more sauce, try using more for layers and adding one jar of alfredo sauce over the top at the end. It makes a nice topping over the mozzarella cheese.

Wow, delis! hubby commented and said best one he ever tasted, the neighbour is pretty fussy, if his wife didnt cook it, he doesn't really like to eat it, but he had some for supper and the next day for his lunch. Making some for Mothers day for mama. just found out lasagna is her favorite food, so I picked this recipe once again. I added ALOT of cheese for the top,, when tinfoil top to bake, make sure there is plenty of foil ballooned up, the cheese stuck to it when baking.

Super easy!.. I ran out of sauce and had to open a jar of tomato sauce; added a little garlic and spices then simmered a few minutes.  Others seemed to have the same problem but then again I did make 3 layers of the lasagna so maybe the sauce just doesn't stretch that far!   Italian sausage tasted a bit too sweet (almost like breakfast sausage), I don't know why but my family said they like it better with ground beef!

I never boil my noodles I soak them in warm water until they bend.  This way they won't soak up all of the sauce.  It even works well for pinwheels.  For those of us who watch portion control pinwheels are a great way to not over do it.  Any lasagna recipe will do, meat sauce or plain sauce on the outside, cheesy goodness on the inside.

A really easy lasagna recipe. I love not having to cook the noodles before hand. I used ground beef and mixed it in with the sauce, added some parmesan cheese, and ended up baking it for one hour and 10 minutes. Yum!!

I used regular lasagna noodles and boiled them first. The dish turned out very good. I liked the sausage flavor and it held together perfectly. The only thing I might change is to increase the mozerella to ricotta ratio. I think the ricotta overpowers the mozerella and you don't get enough gooeyness.

I often mix the ricotta with 4% fat cottage cheese (which is cheaper) and I use spaghetti sauce which is canned because it's 1/3 the price and 1/3 the sugar--and tastes better.

Use 1/2 lb hot Ital sausage & 1/2 lean ground beef. Sautee meats together. Drain then add to sauce. Makes the sauce easier to divide & quicker to assemble. Use regular or no-boil noodles, following directions for the one you boil. After done drain hot water then add cold water to keep them from continuing to cook. Also easier to handle. Herbs & spices can be varied according to taste.

Very easy recipe. I used spinach noodles for a bit of a change and a sweet basil italian sausage. We also like it cheesy so I doubled on the cheese.

AMAZING!!!  This is the easiest and tastiest lasagna I've ever had. It's the first one I've found that wasn't dry.  I added more cottage cheese/mozzarella for the filling because it didn't seem like enough to cover the layers. I also think 1 1/2 lbs of meat is better than 1lb.

A good basic lasagna recipe but, as other readers suggested, it could stand some more sauce.  Also, I find it is better to use fresh lasagna (available in the dairy counter) rather than dry. They cook more quickly and do not soak up as much sauce.   Better tasting too.

Good lasagna - I made it for guests last night to rave reviews.  The only changes I made were to add more sauce, as reviewers suggested, and I used hamburger meat instead of sausage.  I WILL make this again.

I have made this many many times.  Italian sausage is better than ground beef when it comes to lasagna.  Definitely need almost twice the amount of sauce that is recommended.

This is one of my favorite recipes for when company comes over!  So easy and so delicious.  The recipe is great as-is, except you definitely need to double the amount of sauce!!  Also, be sure to layer the top noodles with sauce before adding the cheese, otherwise it'll dry out.  I usually add a 1/2 chopped onion when cooking the sausage, which adds a bit of crunch.  I use 3 fresh garlic cloves in the cheese mix instead of the garlic powder, and add some fresh chopped parsley, and a bit of dried rosemary.  I almost always use just shy of 2 bottles of sauce (preferably with big tomato chucks! Tomato basil sauce is a nice variety too.)  A low fat option includes using cottage cheese in place of the ricotta --  I think that tastes great, too, but my boyfriend still prefers the "real thing".

Tried this recipe today, using 1 package of chopped spinach.  Also added ground fennel to the ground turkey (instead of sausage).  I did not mix the sauce with the meat.  Baked for 50 minutes at 375, then five at 425.  Be sure to tuck the edges into the sauce halfway through the baking process (to keep them from drying out).  I also added two tablespoons of water to the pan of lasagna before I baked it.  Double the mozzarella cheese; asiago is a good substitute for the parmesan.   I used an over-sized, pyrex dish, approx 10" by 15.  The recipe expanded to fit the dish, was easy to serve.  Excellent.

I used Bob Evans brand that comes in a bulk 1 pound roll for the Italian sausage and it was really good.  I used the “cheapo” Hunts Brand Four Cheese spaghetti sauce too.  I also omitted the thyme because my family doesn’t care for that spice.  My stepfather said it was the best Lasagna he ever had and he comes from an Italian family and his mom was a great cook, so I took that as quite a compliment.  I will make this again and again!

I have been making Lasagna this way for 25 years using reg. Lasagna noodles. The recipe I have calls for Cottage Cheese instead of the ricotta cheese, it taste pretty good and so easy! As the other person says you need to cover the noodles with sauce or they will be hard. You can add mushrooms, pepperoni or just have fun with this. what do you like in your Lasagne?

This was a good lasagna recipe and very basic and easy!  However, you will definietly want to use more than one jar of sauce and cook your noodles first.  My noodles were still too chewy after baking in oven.  I also used more cheese on top! :)

Fairly good and easier then regular lasagna but ignore the warnings about it needed extra sauce at your peril. I thought I could avoid having to do that by: 1) presoaking regular lasagna noodles while I cooked the sausage 2) adding some chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture and chopped onion and green bell peppers to the sausage and 3) adding about a half a cup of red wine to the spaghetti sauce. That still wasn't enough and it came out kind of dry. If I do make this again, at a minimum I will add a can of diced tomatoes or very possibly another jar of spaghetti sauce.

This turned out to be a good dinner that's easy to make...I accidently used almost double the sauce, but I'm glad I did because it was still almost on the dry side. I also used a mixture of pork, veal, and sausage (it's called a "meatloaf/meatball" mix that they sell by the hamburger and chicken) and I will do that again next time I make it. Overall we rated it 4.5 stars, but I figured I'd go with 4 since I modified it a bit.

This was the first lasagna I ever made mostly because I felt like it was a difficult thing to make.  This recipe is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except I used home made sauce instead of jar.  This also reheats really well.

This is an excellent and very quick way to make lasagna.  I have very good luck with the no boil noodles.  I would never go back to the old way of boiling them first.  I also agree with the other readers that you definitely need more than 16 oz of sauce. I always use the large jar which I believe is the next size up from the 16 oz jar.  I also mix the sausage and/or hamburg with the sauce and spread that way.  however, I leave enough plain sause out so that I can cover the bottom of the pan and then top off the last layer of noodles with.  I then top with a layer of grated cheese and for the last 5 mintues of cooking then layer with mozarella.

SOO GOOD. Our family has been making the same recipe for lasagna for the past 10 years and I think we may have just found the replacement. Never going back to ground beef again...

I've been making lasagna this way for years. What I do different is: add 1 lb of ground beef along with the sausage, I use the big container (I think 32oz) of ricotta cheese, at least 16 oz of Mozz. cheese and 1 1/2 to 2 (32 oz) jars of sauce. We like it meaty, cheesey and saucy!! Oh and use a deeper pan sprayed real good with non stick cooking spray. Everybody loves it and nobody knows that the noodles where not cooked beforehand!!

I made this for dinner tonight.  I used my homemade spaghetti sauce instead of store bought.  Easy and very tastey.  My daughter even liked it and she is not a lasagna eater.

This was the best lasagna I've ever had.  It was very hearty and stayed together very well.  I assembled it completely then froze it until a later date.  I left it out to defrost a few hours the day I was going to cook it and then baked it as directed.  My kids and hubby loved it!  Will definitely use this recipe for my go-to lasagna recipe!

Thanks for the feedback on the Italian sausage - I have now tested out this recipe and although very different to Lasagne that I am accustomed to it was excllent and a really nice change - I will certainly use this one again.

Like one of the other reviewers, I used 4 noodles per layer as a norm; and did so here.

Typically, I make meatless Lasagna (I sub Portabellas, Eggplants, or Asparagus), however, did grind a Pork Shoulder with herbs and Spices to make an Italian Sausage... it was good.

I did, however, sub a Putanesca for the Spaghetti Sauce in a jar.  I like things fresh, and want to know where they came from.

This was my 1st time using "no boil noodles", a lot less work; not bad.

Just a suggestion for other readers, try experimenting with White Pepper.  In Italian Cooking, depending on the region, Red Pepper has a place to add zest and zip.  Try White Pepper, and notice the Charismatic Charm brought on by the new sensations of where you experience the notes.

I made a few changes...I cooked the italian sausage with a chopped onion and about 2 garlic cloves.  I also used about twice as much sauce as the recipe called for.  I also added 2 layers of mushrooms for my own personal taste.  

It tasted great, perfect amount of cheese and sauce.  The reason I rate this is a 4 is because the "no-boil" noodles didn't taste quite the same as boiled noodles.  The cooked fine but the texture was a little gummy.  Next time I'll boil regular noodles and it will deserve a 5!

This was alright. Needed more flavor-wise, but I'm not sure more what. We used 24 ounces of pasta sauce, and needed more.

Prefer ground beef.  I always cook my pasta first.  The no need to cook noodles tend to make dish taste pasty.  Good right out of oven, but leftovers are dry.

I made this recipe last night but found it difficult to make 4 layers becausde there was not enough ricotta mixture, cheese or sauce.  My husband liked it because he doesn't like a lot of sauce.  If I make it again I will double everything except the noodles.  I'm also not sure if I liked the Tyme in it.

Have to agree with some others that this was way too dry for our taste and I used a 26oz. jar of sauce.  Added onion and a clove of garlic as well as subbed ground beef for sausage as that is our preference.  Good taste overall and very easy.  I will make again, but will use 2 jars of sauce next time.

Delicious! Instead of using sausage I used ground lamb (which I browned with chopped garlic), and I also used a 24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce. I also put it in the oven for 45 minutes covered, and 15 uncovered. This was my first time making lasagna and it was yummy!

I always try to follow a new, rated recipe exactly as written the first time, especially for reviews.  I did exactly that except for using my own sauce for this one.  My opinion?  far too much thyme (may try a little rosemary next time), much too little ricotta mix, too little sauce, and although the sausage, which is what drew me to this recipe in the first place, sounded great, I agree with another reviewer that much of the seasoning needed is in the sausage.  I would suggest getting a good quality Italian sausage, and be very sure to keep it well crumbled while cooking, as it tends to clump with the amount of fat in it.  I would also use a smaller pan and make it into 5 layers instead of 3. (again more ricotta!)  Definitely use a homemade, or favorite locally Italian made sauce.  We have had a very successful and large Italian restaurant for over 50 yrs, all with our Italian family cooks, and I can guarantee a basic homemade sauce would be better than any jar you could buy at the supermarket!  Sorry for the lack of enthusiasm on this one.  I may try my own version sometime in the future, but I'm left still hungry after just finishing my dinner.  Basic idea could be imrpoved upon.

This recipe was way off as far as ingredients.  It needed more of everything...sauce, meat, ricotta mixture, etc.  Luckily I read other reviews and bought 2 16 oz. jars of spaghetti sauce but I didn't buy extra of anything else.  If I make this again, I will use the ingredients as listed but use a smaller casserole dish.    I used whole-wheat lasagna noodles and cooked them first but, other than that, I used the ingredients listed in the recipe.

This was my first lasagna and I was so pleased with the result!  I used regular lasagna noodles (low carb actually), extra cheese, and a combination of mild and hot italian sausage.  It was so good, and the leftovers were great for the few days after.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good and pretty simple to make.  I didn't have enough sauce, so some of the noodles weren't done.  Next time I'll try using a large jar of spaghetti sauce.

I had high hopes for the lasagna... I think that the problem was the sausage was way to overpowering. It was good right out of the oven but later we didn't care for the reheats. Next time I will try a different sauce (I used Ragu marinara) and maybe a different sausage. I used boiled noodles and they were great. The lasagna didn't taste how I had expected.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful!  I omitted the meat and just made a cheese lasagna & it turned out great.  My husband and I loved it!

Like others had suggested, I used 2 jars of tomato sauce and it was JUST enough.

This lasagna turned out so much better than the last recipe I tried.  
It's very easy, and we loved it because it wasn't sloppy.  The layers stayed together when we served it.

Hi Karen1203....here's what the cooks thesaurus ( http://www.foodsubs.com/ ) says about Italian sausages.
"This is a pork sausage that's often added to pasta sauces. Varieties include sweet Italian sausage = mild Italian sausage, which is flavored with garlic and fennel seed, and hot Italian sausage, which also has a shake or two of crushed chile peppers.  It's sold either as links or in bulk.  Cook thoroughly before serving."
I'm from Canada too and it's available in just about any grocery store.My favorite Italian sausage is the mild,the fennel tastes great in it.I'll try your suggestion on the bechamel sauce,sounds like a good idea.

Browned ground beef instead of sausage (our preference) and then cooked with the sauce, which I doubled, and added herbs.  Doubled the ricotta (I actually used cottage cheese to be thrifty).  You need a lot of sauce with no-boil noodles for that size of pan, or they won't cook properly.  The recipe is quick, easy, and very enjoyable. Company asked for seconds anyway!

Excellent lasagna...but needs a little extra kick.  I think next time I will use hot Italian sausage.  After reading the reviews I did add spinach to mine.  Overall it was delicious!

I use a similar recipe... it calls for 3/4 cup water to be added to the sauce. That's just if using 'ready to bake' noodles. If you boil your noodles you shouldn't need to add the extra H2O.

Awesome and so easy!  Only changes I made was using more sauce and I used fresh herbs from my herb garden instead of dried---really makes all the difference in the world!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!! Five Stars-Thumbs up!!! :)

This lasagna was FANTASTIC!!!  I made it for supper and boy was it a hit.  Even my mother-in-law, who rarely gives compliments, said it was good.  I live in Taiwan, and I did not have access to Italian sausage or Ricotta cheese, so I used ground beef and mascarpone cheese instead.  I have baked lasagna once or twice before, but this batch was definitely the tastiest.  Even my two year old cleaned her plate.  Will make again & again with this recipe!!  Thanks Chef!!!

It was just okay but I believe it was the no boil lasagna noodles.  It was my first time to use them and I don't plan on ever using them again, they tasted doughy.  I think the lasagna would have been wonderful if I had used the old fashion noodles, the kind you boil.  I did use 1 1/2 jars of Ragu and I did use a whole 16 oz. bag of mozzarella cheese.  I love cheese.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was quite easy.

I needed waaaay more sauce than specified. I easily doubled the amount. Also, regular lasagna noodles work just fine- just make sure they're adequately covered with sauce. The ricotta mixture nor the amount of meat didn't seem like enough to me when I was putting it together, but it worked out perfectly once cooked. All that said, we all LOVED this, and my husband said that this was way better than his mom's! My mom couldn't believe we didn't buy this from a store. And I couldn't believe that 1- I made lasagna (this was my first time) and 2- I could make it so fast, and so good! I will be making this one on a regular basis. Thanks!

I make a similar recipe, except I use 1 lb of hamburger and I use cottage cheese instead of ricotto.  My four year old eats it for leftovers even. It is always a hit and so simple to make.

This was the best lasagna I have ever had. I doubled the sauce and doubled the cheese. I cooked it for a total of 65 minutes, instead of 45. I wanted to be sure the noodles were extra done.

Definately needs more sauce. I ended up using two and half jars of sauce, which was perfect. I've used the no-boil noodles three times so far and I've never had any problems. I always make sure the noodles are completely covered in cheese/sauce. (I also increased the cook time by 10 mins)

I really wanted to like this recipe because it uses no boil noodles and I'm all for saving time.  However, I just didn't like it.  I put plenty of sauce in but in the end, the noodles are just not the same as if you boil them.  They are almost chewy and not the right texture.  Also, I did not think there was nearly enough Ricotta using 1 pint.  Oh well....back to my old standby recipe.

Found this recipe easy and convenient for a busy day. I used fresh noodles as I find no boil hit and miss. A little more expensive but guaranteed to cook. Taking other suggestions, I added a layer of spinach. My wife is a lasagna connoisseur and she was quite surprised when I told her it was canned sauce, as I usually make my own from scratch which can be very time consuming. I'll definitely make this again.

Italian sausage is italian sausage.  You can find this in the meat section of your supermarket (uncooked) or at a butcher.  I left it out of this recipe when I made it because I am just not into sausage.  It was still good - especially if you are short on time like during the week, after work.  We also used whole wheat lasagna noodles.  BTW - lasagna and italian sausage are italian, not american.  

I would make this again.

This is a good recipe. I agree with the other person who said use more sauce then you would if you boiled the noodles. Cover for almost the entire time. Or you end up with crunchy noodles.. I like this because who wants to go through the hassle of boiling noodles and heating up the kitchen!(especially in the summer!!!)

My family loved the foolproof lasagna.  The only thing I had trouble with was my noodles didn't get done so I had to put it back in the oven for about 20 minutes more, but it was tasted great!

I really liked this recipe, and so did the rest of the family. I used ground beef instead of saugage and I put extra mozzarella cheese in it, extra sauce, plus I cooked my noodles before hand. All in all really easy and tasted great!

This is great.  I ended up using just about 2 jars of sauce. It needs alot of liquid or it is a dry mess. Not cooking the noodles first is a great timesaver. I also used ground beef instead of sausage, but I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the meat when cooking it to give it a unique flavor.  Good stuff.

This was very good and easy to put together.  As others recommended, I added 2 - 8oz cans of tomato sauce (didn't have extra spaghetti sauce) and 1/2 tsp each of basil and oregano.  I combined the meat with the sauce and also some mushrooms.  I added about a 1/4 c of shredded cheddar with the mozzarella cheese on top.  I will make again.

I've made this, using extra sauce, came out great.  I'm wondering if anyone has made this with gluten-free noodles and, if so, how were the results?  What brand of GF noodles did you use?

This was the first time I ever made lasagna, and it was very easy to make and tasted great!  It was for my Italian boyfriend's family, and they loved it.  I didn't know it was tradition to serve  warm marinara sauce on the side to serve over the lasagna, so I wish I had some extra sauce.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was the first time I ever made lasagna and it was very simple. I used the no boil lasagna noodles and it came out fine with the exception that one small corner didn't have as much sauce on it so it was a little crunchy. I also used seasoned ground beef mixed with spicy italian sausage. Overall I am very pleased with this recipe and the helpful reviews. Definitely use more sauce and lots more cheese and for an added bonus use shredded Parmesan instead of grated.

EXCEPTIONAL !!!!!!!  The only thing I differed was exchanged 1.5 lb ground chuck for the sausage.  Salt and peppered while browning and this proved to be OUTSTANDING !!!!!!   Ages 7 to 65 and everyone LOVED !!!!!!!!

I used hamburger instead of sausage.  Boyfriend liked a lot so 4 stars.  I had a lot of noodles leftover so I must have done something not quite right.

This turned out very nice and the kids I was feeding all had seconds.  The only thing I did different was use more sauce (the only sauce I had on hand was a 26 oz. can)and I'm glad I did because I think it would have been too dry otherwise.  The noodles came out great - nice and tender - not cruchy at all.  Oh, and I used 1/2 italian sausage and 1/2 lean ground beef because I think the flavor of italian sausage it too overpowering. It had just the right amount of flavor.  Over all it was a pretty easy recipe to make for a lasagne recipe.  Will probably use it again.

Agree with others, needs WAY more sauce.  It was really easy and could have been yummy but ended up too dry even when I put more sauce than called for.  But worth a second shot for sure.

EASY AND TASTES GREAT!!! My family doesn't like the sausage so I added pepperoni and ground beef to my sauce.  We take salads for lunch everyday to work, so by the end of the week, we add all the left over fresh veggies to the lasagna and end up with a fabulous Friday night dinner.  Spinach, bell peppers, green onions, shredded carrots, anything you want!  Thank you, Chefstacie for sharing your fabulous recipe!!

I followed this exactly but used lightlifes vegetarian sausage instead. I also used noodles I boiled and a jar and half of sauce. I thought it could of used more spices and I might add some spinach ton it next time. Thank you for getting me started.

This is the same way I make my lasagna.  I love this recipe.  Also, for the people who are saying to "do the math" for the noodles and layers, it is a matter of taste how many noodles you use or how high you stack it.  If your family eats a lot of food then stack it higher.  I do not use more than 3 layers (including the bottom) because it is just too much food for us!
Thank you for the great recipe.

I've had better lasagna - but it is very easy.  I also found that if you buy the "no boil" noodles, you have to overlap 4 per layer.  I used twice as much sauce and twice as much mozerella cheese.  Next time, I will put the broiler on for a bit as the cheese was not very brown.

Spices were too funky - hubby didn't like it at all.  Noodles just wouldn't cook even though I used plenty of sauce.

Good, basic lasagna recipe. Will take the time to make regular noodles next time though - no boil noodles tasted gummy. Definately add extra sauce as others suggested.
