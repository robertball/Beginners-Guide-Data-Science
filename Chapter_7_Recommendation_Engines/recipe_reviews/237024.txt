I made no changes.  I follow recipes to the letter on the first time.  I WILL NOT change anything on this one.  It is tied with the best I have ever had!

OK - We had friends over and I followed the recipe exactly BUT did change a little.  After cooking and letting stand - I put the shrimp in a bowl with paper towels.  Then I took the shrimp and put them on ICE.  The warm shrimp is OK, but putting the shrimp on ICE was the best I have ever had...

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars. It was simple and fast. I also thought it was delicious . I paired it with fresh pasta in a garlic parsley butter sauce with lots of fresh lemon.
