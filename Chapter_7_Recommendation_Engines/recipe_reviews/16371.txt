Because of time constraints, I applied the rub to the pork just before cooking.  To ease preparations, I skipped all the steps about sauteing a little at a time - I just put all the veggies into a big roasting pan and sauteed them all at once until the cabbage had wilted,then put the roast (unbrowned) on top of the veggies and slid it into the oven.  It was awesome - I'll definitely make this again.

This was good, and definately worth trying, but when I  make this again I will reduce the amounts black pepper and caraway seeds, it was a bit spicy for my family as is.  I think with those revisions it will be delish!

very good recipe- my family does not like me to cook with beer  so I used apple juice instead (good results). I used beef stock in place of the broth (more flavor, less salt). I cut the cabbage in chunks instead of shredding it (my wife's preference)and I just quartered some potatoes and cooked them with the roast.  I sliced the meat and served it atop the vegetables - pleasing to the eye and delicious

Excellent recipe-the cabbage, carrots, and caraway blend nicely--with the carrots adding a sweetness that complemented the pork.  The pork was very moist and tender, one of the moistest roasts I've cooked.  My brother-in-law said he really liked it, and he doesn't even like cabbage!  Also, I was worried that the caraway would overpower the meat, and it didn't.  I did cook my potatoes separately and just served the carved roast on the bed of vegetables.  Definitely worth trying!

I've made this three times, the first time with cabbage,the last 2 times with sauerkraut. Definitely better with the sauerkraut. I used chicken broth instead of beer. Do crush the caraway seeds.I didn't think it would make a difference, but it was a more mellow flavor when crushed.Tried it once in the crock pot, not very good.

I don't try out new recipes on guests, but this one was 'on deck' to be roasted when unexpected company came by.  Everyone raved over it!  Make some mashed potatoes, crusty bread and serve a green salad with this one.  The aroma alone will bring the neighbors over to see what's cookin!

I was hoping for more flavor then what it ended up with, especially for the amount of time you need to put into making this.  Tasted alright, although somewhat bland, probably won't make this again.

Hard to rate this correctly as I changed the cut of meat and cooking method.  I used a pork roast in the crock pot.  Husband did not like the flavor of caraway on the cabbage, but the meat turned out well.

This was very good! Like most others I made mashed potatoes on the side. Also, I only used 3 teaspoons of caraway thinking it would be too strong but next time I will follow the recipe. The caraway just mellows out and gives everything a wonderful taste.

I made this with sauerkraut. I followed the recipe exactly but potatoes and meat were bland and the meat was also dry.  The vegetables were excellent.  I think the potatoes need butter and seasoning in them to make them flavourful.  If I were to make this again I'd use very lean chops and cut slits in them to rub in the dry mixture before leaving overnight.  I probably won't make the whole dish again but I will make the vegetable part.

WOW!  This was great!  I substituted jarred sauerkraut for the cabbage and followed the rest of the directions EXACTLY.  I was very pleased with it and my husband who HATES sauerkraut even raved about it!  Thanks for a great recipe!  It's a keeper!!

The taste of the pork was absolutely yummy - followed directions exactly.  Not only will I serve this again as is with the cabbage, etc. - but will put in my notes to use this mariande for a  pork roast and use different vegetables.  Like another reviewer, I served the mashed potatos on the side - next time I will follow the submitter's directions and bake it with the roast.  I think that will be better.  Thanks Holly.

I halved the caraway because I don't like it for the meat rub and left it out completely when sautéing the vegetables. I didn't have beer in house so I used a little rice wine vinegar and that seemed to work. I tried to follow the recipe as close as possible otherwise. I put it in the oven, went to a kids sporting event and when I came home the house smelled delicious. The meat and vegetable were very tasty. I used a whole head of cabbage and still would have like more. Even tastier the next day!

This recipe was a hit.  I did not change anything and my husband and adult son ate 2/3 of this in one sitting.  I will decrease the salt/pepper in the rub next time as my husband thought it was a little spicy.

I let my pork roast marinate for two days in the fridge for extra flavor and served boiled potatoes on the side.  My husband loved it.

I used cabbage but I think sauerkraut would taste better.  I'm not sure if it was the caraway or the flavor of the beer that leaves an aftertaste that lingers.

This rating applies to the rub only. I tried this recipe last year and loved the rub. I found the rest of the recipe to be disappointing. I prefer my sauerkraut white and sour. All the beef broth, beer, and molasses made it too brown and sweet. I did like the carrot and onion, but they couldn't make up for the rest of it. The extra caraway in the sauerkraut gave it an oddly spicy taste. Not to mention the house became incredibly smokey when browning the roast. We had to open the house up! Not a good thing on New Years Day in Ohio!!

This recipe was wonderfully different from anything I have ever tried.  I am not a fancy cook, but this dinner looked and tasted like it was served at a fine restaurant.  Of course, I scribbled the recipe down in haste and forgot to turn over the roast and wait for the internal temp to rise (I knew I bought the meat therm for some reason?!), so I just sliced the pork and cooked for another 20 mins. after the initial 45.  My boyfriend and I thank you very much!

Wow, Wow, Wow!  I just can't say enough about this recipe.  It really was pretty involved and took a lot of time and advance preparation, but it was well worth it.  I made it with saurkraut and it was a hit with my German Grandmother.  Make this any time you want to make an impression!

This is a great recipe! I did not marinade my roast as long, but still came out very delicious. I couldn't crush the caraway seeds, so I just used whole. I did put the mashed potatos on top and they were excellent. Don't let the amount of prep scare you away. After everything is combined for the final cooking step, clean up the other pots and pans while it's cooking and serve from the dutch oven when it's done. Thank you, Holly!

The recipe process is  a little involved, but it was really good.  Instead of a separate skillet and roasting pan, we used a cast iron dutch oven to first brown everything, then deglazed with the beer and threw everything back in.  Good dinner.

The roast turned out moist and delicious.  The vegetables had a great flavor.  Unfortunately, the vegetables were a greasy soupy mess when I removed the pan from the oven.  I removed them with a slotted spoon and drained them on paper towels, then proceeded to put the roast back on top and cover with mashed potatoes.  The taste was good, but, all in all, this one isn't worth the trouble to be in a regular rotation.  I'll save the recipe, though, because it is, at least, unusual.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Not only did it not tell me when to add the garlic,  - after an hour, my 2 lb roast wasn't even cooked through, at 350!

I thought this was really good, loved the taste of caraway. The family didn't comment much except my daughter made a stir fry from the leftover veggies the next day so she enjoyed that part. I only had a few hours to marinate, and served the mashed potatoes on the side. Next time I'll put the mashed potatoes on top and roast as the recipe suggests, as the pork was a little rare.

Really enjoyed this meal, made jasmine rice instead of the mashed potatoes. Would be nice if the directions included timing etc. for the potatoes.

This looks great, but I have a question...Do you just mash up plain potatoes and put them on top or do you actually make mashed potatoes with butter, milk, etc. and then put them on top?

This was very good.  I made it for guests who all enjoyed it.  A couple even wanted some leftovers to take home!  I didn't feel four potatoes were nearly enough, and I increased it to six, but I would use even more next time.  I'll just make the mashed potatoes on the side next time, too, since the sliced meat looks so beautiful on top of the carrots and cabbage, and I hate to cover it up at all.  This dish has fantastic flavor and I am already planning a dinner party around it soon.

Wow, this was so good! I followed the recipe exactly. My family loved the vegetable and all. Meat was so moist, I sliced the left over and it made the best sadwich!
