I made these with all whole wheat flour due to a friend's white flour sensitivity. They were a little flat but I think that is due to the flour change I made. Recipe worked well for me in a kitchen I wasn't familiar with. Great flavor!

These were great!  I used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup white whole wheat flour and they turned out fluffy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Definitely fluffy and tasty! The whole batch was gone in an hour. At first I was a little worried when I dumped the dough out to knead it and it was super liquidy....then I realized I forgot the other cup of flour. :/ Whoops. Once I added it in, they turned out great! Ha! Oh, and instead of buying buttermilk, I used the ol' tried and true 1 cup milk, 1 tbsp. white vinegar. Let it set 5 min, and it's ready to go!

This recipe my absolute favorite! It is so versitile and the buiscuts come out flakey and taste just like buttermilk biscuits. I have made these several times and they always turn out wonderful. This is a very wet dough and I usually need to knead some flour into it. An important tip for makeing biscuits: knead the dough as little as possible! These turn out muh better when I knead the dough only a few times and pat the dough out gently with my hands to get the right thickness. They do take about 12 minutes to cook, but it depends on how thick your biscuits are. I have also tried this recipe with all white flour for picky eaters and it turns out just as good! I usually make a double batch (one whole wheat and one regular) and after I cut them out, I place them on a cookie sheet in the freezer for an hour or two, Then move them to a freezer bag. Then when I need biscuits, I just pull out a few whole wheat and a few white flour ones. I cook them as normal and I dont have to add any cooking time. They are so conventient and easy to make!!! I have also replaced the talespoon of sugar with honey and noticed no difference in taste, but though dough was a little bit wetter. These buiscuts are not sweet, so if you like sweet biscuits, add more sugar. This is definately a wonderful recipe I will kep around!!

On a mission to make healthier meals, I decided to try whole wheat biscuits tonight. I was to lazy to roll them out and use a cookie cutter, so I rolled everything into a log and divided into 6 equal pieces. I rolled each piece into a rough circle and baked in a ceramic pie plate. They were fantastic! It takes longer to bake this way... after 12 minutes I reduced the temperature to 350 and checked them every few minutes until they were lightly browned. I think overall they were in the oven about 20 minutes. I will definitely be making these again!

These biscuits are absolutely delicious! I have never made a biscuit that had whole wheat in it. I also liked that these were made with butter over shortening and only 4 tblsp of fat. I made a mock buttermilk with 2% milk and about a 1/2 tsp. of so of vinegar. For the whole wheat I used Gold Medal white whole wheat flour (a lighter tasting whole wheat made with a lighter colored grain). The batter looked a little wet so I stirred in a scoop, maybe a 1/2 cup or so of AP flour extra. I lined my square baking pan with heavy duty foil, sprayed it with Bakers Joy, and patted the dough into a nice even square. I gently cut the square in half, each half in half, then cut across the other way into 3 (to get a total of 12 biscuits). Found square biscuits were so much easier than round ones which are messy and over-work the dough. I think they are softer this way too, because the biscuits are kept together. I believe I got this method from AR Kentucky Biscuits. It worked great with these too. I will definitely make these again, they tasted like a really good thick very soft biscuit. Baking time was 17-18 minutes. Thank you!

I used 100% whole wheat pastry flour (pastry flour is the key ingredient), no white flour at all, barely mixed these together before I patted them into a rectangle and cut them with a knife. They rose beautifully, were tender and delicious. They were pretty bumpy on the top since I barely kneaded them and too sticky to pat down, but they were so good nobody cared. You can get away w/all whole wheat flour, but be sure it's pastry flour or they can get pretty tough.

I used just whole wheat flour, can't stand all purpose flour. When I was reading the recipe and noticed what I thought called for 4 teaspoons of baking soda, I thought it sounded like a little much, but rolled with it. 
Should have went with my instinct, they felt almost fizzy on my tongue. THEN I went back and saw that it said baking POWDER! I felt so stupid. They weren't terrible, just....fizzy and weird. HA! So, don't do what I did. I will have to try this again, and do it correctly.

I make these several times a year.  I have made one major change and that is to the amount of milk used.  I only use 3/4 cup and it works out well each time.  1 cup was way to sticky.  I also do not use buttermilk, I use regular milk and they come out very tasty.

For goodness sake, don't just dump the liquid in while making your biscuits as different humidity levels will effect how your flour absorbs the milk.  I'm assuming the submitter meant the 1/2 cp to be a general guide.  I whipped up half a batch in less than the time needed to gather the ingredients and use 2T less milk than called for.  Just take your time and feel the dough with your hands.  These were lovely and baked up beautifully.  For hubby, I'll probably cut wheat flour to 1/3 cup and use a bit more white flour - but again, personally, I thought they were spectacular.  Only cutters I had were 2 1/4" and 3" so I used the smaller of the two and came out with exactly 6 biscuits.  Will definately make again and tysm for recipe!

I used coconut oil (refined)in place of butter and light agave syrup in place of the white sugar. Also, instead of buttermilk, I used almond milk--no flavoring. These are really great! They have a good texture and taste really wonderful. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The dough was too sticky to work with w/o lots of extra dough working flour. Sub-ed honey for white sugar. Used a smaller cookie cutter and made mini biscuits! Very cute! Think this is a very good basic biscuit recipe! Thanx!

I definitely was not able to knead or cut these out - it was more like a batter until I added an extra 1/2 cup flour, and even then I had to make them as drop biscuits.

I made these with what I had on hand.  Substituted white whole wheat for the white flour and almond/coconut blend milk for milk and I still could not ruin the recipe.  I'm sure the original recipe yields fluffier biscuits, but mine were very good.  I will be making these again.

These biscuits turned out far better than I expected. We were out of all-purpose flour so I only had 3/4 cup. To make it up, I used 1 1/4 c whole wheat flour. I doubled the amount of butter and used a whole stick instead. This was an excellent decision. 
Like many other reviewers stated, this is a wet dough. However, I moved forward, turned it out onto the board, sprinkled it with flour between each knead. It firmed up nicely and made gorgeous biscuits with flaky layers. 
Something is wrong with our oven so the bottoms were a bit dark after 10 minutes. I'd put them on a higher rack next time but I'm sure we're the only people with a 1960-something gas oven that heats 50 degrees higher than the thermostat!

These are really good. I had my doubts because I don't have much luck with whole wheat flour. But we were delighted with the results. Very tasty and surprisingly light. These are going to be my go-to recipe for biscuits. Thanks for a great recipe.  1.5.19 just made these again only I used flour that was already a mix of whole wheat and AP flour and they turned out even fluffier than the last time.  Some were actually nearly 2 inches tall and so yummy.

1) Never ever twist your cutter when cutting the biscuits
2) Amazing biscuits for biscuits and gravy.
I didn't have butter milk so I use plain yogurt as an substitute and it worked. Loved these biscuits

Looking for healthier recipes for my diabetic husband & these hit the spot! Very little sugar & the whole wheat combined with the AP flour kept them pretty light. Didn't alter the recipe. I really like these better the 2nd day- split & toasted!

I'm sure these would be even better as is but I used ALL white whole wheat flour. I also didn't have buttermilk so I added a splash of apple cider vinegar to whole milk and let it curdle white I cut the butter into the flour mix. Instead of kneading, rolling, etc. I dropped them by spoon fulls onto a baking sheet. I took Pam's tip and baked them for 450 at first for 8 mins and then 350 for another 12 mins or so. They were delicious!

The biscuits were tender a nice, great for my morning egg/chesse/bacon biscuit. I used a tad more butter than the recipe calls for, a pinch more baking powder, and definitely a tad more flour as it was very wet using 1 cup of milk (most recipes call for 3/4 cup. The ONLY think I was disappointed with is the biscuits hardly rose at all. But that always happens with me and I can't figure out why!!!! Still....the biscuits were quite good!

I am the cook in our private daycare center in Israel,catering for about 50 toddlers,young schoolchildren and staff.
I have served these biscuits now several times,with soups,or stew,or meatballs and gravy. The kids love them, it's a never fail recipe !
I had just a little dough left over from the last batch,and no room on the baking tray,so I rolled a circle about 6 inch diameter and put it on a hot cast iron skillet,about 4 mins each side.WOW is it tasty !

They were indeed fluffy, but pretty tasteless.  I didn't have buttermilk and had to sub with milk+lemon juice, so maybe they are better with buttermilk.  However, I know I have made tastier biscuits in the past without buttermilk.

These were so good! I did not use the all purpose flour, only white whole wheat. Instead of butter I used coconut oil and used palm sugar for the sugar. I also did the 1 tablespoon of vinegar in 1 cup milk instead of buttermilk. Like the recipe states don't over work dough. Instead of rolling dough out,  I patted the dough into a square and cut bisquits into squares, they don't have to be round to be yummy and yummy they are for being whole grain!

I joined here just so I could rate these. I have used lots of recipes off of here before but I LOVE this SO much. My whole family loves biscuits but I always felt horrible about all the white flour and crisco. I tried a couple others but while I liked them my husband always complained that they tasted a little too healthy. This is perfect. My husband loved it (and so did everyone else). He said he couldn't even tell the difference. The biscuits where light and fluffy and just like we love them. 10 stars in my book!

I kept the biscuits in the oven too long so they were dry when I took them out. Next time I'll keep in the oven for a shorter time.

Excellent!! I was a little apprehensive about trying these with only six reviews, but I'm so glad I did. They were delicate and fluffy, even better than the ones I've made in the past with all white flour. I wish I could find a 10% whole wheat biscuit recipe that produces similar results, sigh!

These turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made the buttermilk with milk and vinegar. I thought the dough seemed too moist and sticky to knead but it worked with enough flour.  Will make these again.

According to Allrecipes.com, I've made these twice. I had to improvise on the buttermilk by using 1 cup heavy cream with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. Worked like a charm.  I did a square cut  as to avoid scraps.  Only ended up 9 biscuits but for the 2 of us that was just fine for a Sunday morning. Husband had at least 2 maybe 3. He buttered the top and did not add his favorite jelly. This will now be a permanent staple in my Sunday morning breakfast rotation.  May try to somehow double the recipe to increase more biscuits.

The biscuit turned out a little heavy.  I may have spent to much time mixing, I don't know.  I cut the biscuits with a heart shaped cookie cutter for Mother's Dat.   They were made into ham biscuits.  The ham was also cut into heart shapes.  One more thing, I split the biscuits with  copping saw.  I bought a new blade, washed it in the dish washer.

Giving this three stars for taste & texture ~ agree with another review that I could not roll out this VERY sticky dough.  Added more flour while attempting to knead & made the last biscuit the size of three due to frustration with the dough.  To my surprise ~ they came out quite nicely...the sticky ones and the drier dough ones.....even the large one.  Perhaps using 1 C. White Whole Wheat Flour (along with the 1 C. All-Purpose Flour) made a difference, so I will attempt another trial using 1 C. Whole Wheat Flour next time.  Good next day as well ~ did not dry out!

Wow! So happy I found this recipe! These are great. I follow the recipe as is, except instead of a pastry blender I use my stand-alone mixer with the paddle attachment. Works like a charm. We've had them for breakfast, but my favorite use so far has been on top of chicken pot pie. So hearty!

I used Pinerygirl's suggestion and substituted honey for sugar. came out tasting kinda bland but still very good. spread honey butter on the tops and that boosted the taste. Biscuits came out fluffy and light.

Great recipe.  Our convection oven was faster and the biscuits were lighter.  I used only whole wheat flour.  They were a hit and got devoured ravenously with soup.

Kind of cool and dreary and I was craving some bread, so I made these. Only change I made was to use 1-1/2c whole wheat flour and 1/2c white flour and they were great! In spite of what others said about the dough being too sticky/wet, I used the entire cup of ‘buttermilk’ and my consistency was spot on. 2 thumbs up!

I used yogurt instead of buttermilk since that is what I had, with some milk to have enough liquid. It turned out really good and will make it again.

Added an egg coating for a crispy crust and soy milk is a decent substitution for the other milk if anyone has allergies. Little dense, but probably due to substitutions, still very yummy!

Great Biscuits! Fast and easy to make, I used 1%  milk instead of the buttermilk because were I live there are no buttermilk. My children and husband love them with jam and bacon.

I love this recipe. The only change I made was opt out the sugar because personally there is no need for it.

I followed the recipe, except for how I formed the biscuits. I left them as small balls, cooked them 9.5 minutes, flipped them upside down, and cooked for about 2.5 minutes. They turn out very fluffy and taste fantastic!

Made these for Christmas dinner.  A big hit.  One guest who was leaving for China the next day wanted to bring some to share with her family there; two guests asked for the recipe.

I thought these turned out great! They baked perfectly in 12 minutes. They turned out deliciously crunchy on the bottom, but were not dark (cooked on parchment on a dark cookie sheet). I cooked them on the center rack in the oven.  I don't keep buttermilk on hand, so I used soured milk (milk with vinegar). This is a repeat recipe!

I usually make canned biscuits with meals calling for them, or at least Bisquick, but that wasn't an option today. this was a simple recipe, and used butter, which are my criteria, and I'm so glad I did it! This is tastier, and a better texture, than any of my usual alternatives! This recipe will be my new go-to for biscuits!

Wonderful texture. That one cup of white flour kept them light while the whole wheat added flavour and nutrition.  Have made this multiple times with honey for sweetener.

Quick, easy & tasty!  I added 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder to the dry ingredients, and it gave them just the nicest flavour!  Made 3 batches in an hour & they were gobbled up in no time. :)

A very forgiving recipe, as I forgot to knead it. I don't do a lot of baking, but it came out extremely soft and tasted much better than any premixed biscuits I've tried. I did end up making these as drop biscuits. A little crumbly if cutting, but I'd much rather it be crumbly compared to too firm. Overall, very good!

Great flavor and moistness. Had to add a little extra flour to get the right consistency as they were initially too sticky to form into biscuits. Dropped them on the pan and smashed with a cup and some parchment paper instead of rolling out.

I took some of the advice in the comments and reduced the milk to 3/4 cup, and that seemed to be the perfect amount. I also only baked them for 8 minutes since my oven always over does it. They turned out great - fluffy and delicious. Definitely a keeper.

Hubby loved these for biscuits and gravy, I didn't think they held together very well. The flavor was a bit lacking but they worked for what we needed.  I might want to change something, not sure what, for next time.

Delicious! Great recipe! I just made my first batch about two hours 
ago. I didn't use the salt and they were very good. I really had a 
burning taste for some homemade biscuits so I went online and found this recipe. I'm glad I did! My Husband loved the taste. I will make more before the week is out. They did come out a little flat, but that was all good.--Butter Pecan

This is a great recipe!  Just made it, and I devoured 3 biscuits with jam myself!  We don't use a lot of dairy, so I used soy milk in place of the buttermilk, and they still came out very tasty.  They were very tender and fluffy, but also a little flat.  I think when I make them again, I will roll them out thicker, maybe double the recipe to make a dozen.  I don't know if they came out flat because of the altitude, we are at 7,000 feet elevation.  I will definitely make these again!

These biscuits are the BEST ever! The texture is perfect and the taste is beyond anything I expected containing whole wheat flour. For those looking to include whole grains, this recipe is a winner.
