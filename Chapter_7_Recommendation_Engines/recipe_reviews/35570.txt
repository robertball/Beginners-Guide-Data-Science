I did not care for the molasses flavor at all! I've made caramelized onions before where the recipe called for a small amount of granulated white sugar and I'll go back to that. The white sugar added as the onions begin to saute helps them get brown and caramelized without adding that molasses flavor.

Not bad. I am going to make it a second time and try it Chebelle's way. Just add white sugar to the pan as they start to brown and that will carmelize. I will let you know which way I like better.
A little bit too molasses"y". But, still good. 
UPDATE: I made them the other way that was suggested by a reviewer-Chebelle-I like her way much better. But, you could probably use less molasses if you want and add some white sugar as they are carmelizing. They should be just as good.
Enjoy!

These were awesome.  I was slightly worried about the reviews talking about them being too molasses-y, but I went for it and followed the recipe as is.  So glad I did because these onions were fantastic.  Put them on homemade chipotle burgers on fresh onion buns with monterey jack cheese, roasted red peppers (also sauteed in the bacon fat), mayo, lettuce, and tomato.  Seriously best homemade burger EVER.

THESE WERE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  I DID CUT DOWN ON THE MOLASSES - ONLY USED 1 T. BECAUSE I THOUGHT 2 MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO MUCH.  THEY WERE PERFECT!!!!!  GOOD TO EAT ALONE OR WITH STEAK, HOT DOG OR HAMBURGER.

I don't eat meat other than fish so I didn't add the bacon. I wasn't too fond of the strong molasses taste but once I added some sugar, it was great on top of salmon! :) I would make again.

As I sat next to the grill listening to the onions sizzle my mouth just watered. It was great! I also added red and green peppers, and zucchini (spelling?) It was great will do again.

I used dark molasses (all I had) & I think it imparted too much molasses flavor. I think next time I'll just add a smidgeon of molasses so that it doesn't overwhelm the natural sweetness of the caramelized onions. I served this on top of Basil Pork Chops (from all recipes)...great combo! Thanks for the recipe, Joann!

I never thought about the bacon before. This was devine and went so well with my rosemary chicken with orange-maple sauce. I added some baked apples too :)

I didn't use the bacon (don't eat pork) and used regular sugar instead of molasses.  They were divine on a burger with blue cheese!

Yummy! The only substitution I used was honey in place of molasses. I prepared these for grilled burgers. I agree that some of the onion flavor is lost with the other ingredients added. It's not bad, just different. I won't use this on burgers again because I like the onion flavor to dominate in caramelized onions. I will, however, add this to baked beans in the future. Thanks!

My boyfriend and I loved these!! I didn't have molasses so I just substituted honey. Also, I used a white onion instead of a sweet one. And real bacon bits from a jar to make it quicker, I browned the onion in a little olive oil. I am going to put them on top of a pork chop or steak next time.

Wish I had used good old sugar rather than molasses. It smothered the onion flavor but the calf liver was still great.

I made this as written the first time around and enjoyed it but thought that maybe it was a tad too sweet. The second time I made it I cut the molasses to 1 Tbsp. and added 1 Tbsp. of good Balsamic vinegar and a pinch of salt. So 4 stars as written but 5 stars to suit my taste with the changes the second time around. Loved the bacon in it! We had it on bleu cheese burgers both times... Yum! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Love this recipe for Carmelized onions! The addition of molasses adds just the right amount of sweetness. I used only 1 tbsp and thought this was enough. Loved it with our t-bones!

I made no changes and they were EXCELLENT! I made them (3 whole onions) as part of a dish I just whipped together with stuff I had here. The molasses is the key, will never again make carmelized onions without it!
I took a Kielbasa (a whole rope/package) cut it into discs about 1/4 inch thick (I brown them (kielbasa discs) in a skillet since i like them almost well done and crunchy), two green bell peppers sliced in strips and roasted in a pan, with salt, until slightly browned, and a can (or 2) of sliced potatoes,  throw in the onions. Salt and pepper to your taste. Stir around all ingedients and heat covered for a few minutes so all the flavors combine nicely. Yummy, yummy a quick and VERY TASTY meal!  :O)

I used maple syrup rather than mol. A delicious compliment to burgers!

Perfect on burgers. I only used 1 tablespoon of Molasses though and sprinkled a little sugar on the onions while cooking.

Delicious!  I did not add the bacon but kept everything else as written.  I used dark molasses and drizzled over the onions.  Made with steaks.  Thanks

I thought that it was going to be difficult to make caramelized onions, that is until I found this recipe. It was easy and the onions were good. I used them in the paninis I made. Thank you for the recipe. Dawn
