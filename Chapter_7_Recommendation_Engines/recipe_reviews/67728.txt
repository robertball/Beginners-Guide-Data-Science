I just made this recipe today for my boyfriend who loves cilantro and he was not that impressed.  The concept is actually really good however in my opinion the recipe needs some tweaking.  The reason for this is that the rice and hominy together in the same pot created a mush that was not at all attractive either tastewise or visually.  My recommendation is either cook the rice separately and leave out the hominy (substitute corn) or make it into a soup.  For the soup, I will only use 2 chicken breasts, half a cup of rice and I will not use hominy since the hominy and rice pretty much have the same consistency.  Next time I plan on using corn and adding some lime juice, a little cayenne powder and also chicken stock instead of water.  Also adding some chopped cilantro that has not been pulverized might be a good idea.

I am an avid lover of garlic and cilantro, so it's no surprise that I thought this was fabulous.  I actually ended up using almost double the amount of cilantro and garlic for the sauce.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and cumin before sauteing.  My chicken was a little over-cooked in the end, so next time I'll be careful to really just lightly brown it before starting the 20-minute cook-time.  Also, I HIGHLY recommend serving this with a squeeze of fresh lime juice. It really brought the flavors together.

A very fresh tasting dish (if you like Cilantro!)  I added a splash of lime juice and I served it over pasta instead of rice. I had a sprig of fresh cilantro and a thin wedge of lime as a garnish. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I used corn instead of hominy (cannot stand hominy) and I cooked the rice separately (way more convenient). It was good but it was even better with the juice of one large lime. Nice recipe. Thanks!

LOVED this recipe! LOVED! So tasty. Very easy. Tried to stretch it once and added extra rice, made it like a casserole. Once added some whole cooked pinto beans, because I love them, and loved that variation too! Big hit with all of the family, from kids to grandpa.

I made exactly as per the recipe, only I added a carrot into the puree mix.  It was really easy and good.  It wasn't mushy at all - be sure not to stir too much once the rice is in.  I also garnished with more cilantro and a few squeezes of lime juice.  Will make again.

I thought this was really yummy.  It would be a great St. Patrick's Day tradition, since it is so very green! The only thing I added was a tsp. of ground cumin- gave it a little more flavor.

I love the flavor of cilantro so this dish was perfect.  In fact, I have been searching for a version of Peruvian "arroz con pollo" and I'd say this would be it.  The hominy adds a nice textural  element.  Next time I'd like to try browning my chicken separately from the onions, and trying thigh pieces instead.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change much.  Thank you!

I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple to make and tasted delicious. I didn't have hominy so I used corn and I thought it worked great. I did, however, want just a little more flavor or spice so I added some chili sauce. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I used chicken broth instead of water in this recipe.  We ate ALL of the leftovers!  I've already told several people about it.  Sooo good.

This was excellent.  The smell in the house was wonderful as I was cooking it.  I actually have chicken breasts that I cook up and freeze with seasoning and onion.  I just defrosted a bag and followed the recipe.  I did add a bit more broth and Lawry's Seasoned Salt.  This is a keeper!  I'm hungry just thinking about it again!

Not bad, but I do think it might be better making the rice separately.  Not sure if I didn't use enough cilantro (I don't really know what a "bunch" means, and I was picking out of my deck garden, so I might not have used enough), but the cilantro taste wasn't really there for me--I think I might add fresh at the end if I made it again.  Hubs liked it, and it's a relatively easy and quick meal, but I think I'd like some tweaks to try it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took the idea of blending cilantro and garlic together and added one Serrano pepper for kick also, I used chicken brother not water. 

Cooked the onion, threw in the chicken (cubed) after being seasoned with cumin, pepper, and salt. Cooked the chicken 3/4 done, added the cilantro puree and then pulled the chicken out and set it aside. 

On another burner, I cooked quinoa, not rice. 

Set the skillet back on medium heat with oil and threw in carrots, onions, and bell peppers- cooked 1/2 done then I threw in the 3/4 cooked quinoa, chicken, and mixed it all up, pulled it off the burner after a few minutes and enjoyed.

I have to give this 4 stars because I altered it quite a bit. My blender is broken so I just added crushed garlic and chopped cilantro after sauteeing the onions and chicken. I also added some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit and then, because I wanted more of a one-pot meal, I added 1/2 c corn, about 1 cup black beans and a can of chopped tomatoes.  I served it over noodles since I was out of rice.  My husband and kids enjoyed it so that confirms that it's a keeper!

Wow, this was SO good! I used a lot more garlic and cilantro because I'm a huge fan of both. I omitted the salt and pepper at the end, and instead stirred in about a teaspoon of chili paste the last five minutes of cooking. I also omitted the hominy, as I didn't have any on hand. I wasn't quite sure if this was supposed to be a soup, or a dry rice-and-chicken combo. Mine was somewhere in the middle, but I thought it was great. With the additions I made, there was a perfect blend of spice and flavor. Hands down, I'll be making this again, thank you so much Ds R!

I used corn (no hominy fans in this house!) and added juice from half a lime and this was a big hit. Also good with roasted garlic and a little half and half.

We made this dish for St. Patrick's Day and enjoyed it very much.  It certainly doesn't look good, but if you like cilantro and garlic, you'll like this.  I used chicken broth in place of the water.

This recipe is MEDIOCRE!! The taste is very bland and it looks almost like a green mush. I wouldn't recommend making this for company - but if you need a quick healthy dish - this isn't so bad.

Fantastic recipe, my hubby and I really enjoyed it! Only changes I made was using fresh corn cut off the cob instead of hominy and Jasmine rice instead of long grain. I will definitely be making this again!!! Thanks for sharing it.

I made this as a casserole instead of a soup. Instead of blending ingredients I just sautéed the onion, garlic, and cilantro in olive oil. Then added chicken, with about 2 cups of chicken broth and a chicken garlic bouillon cube. Simmered and added hominy. Used a 16x9 glass pan, greased, added approx 2 cups of uncooked rice to bottom, then added a can of black beans with jalapeños and lime juice. Covered with simmering chicken mixture. Then added 8oz of fresh shredded Monterey Jack cheese to top. Baked covered at 350 for 30 minutes then uncovered for about 10-15 minutes. It was soooooo delicious with a dollop of sour cream on top. Thank you for a great base recipe. I wanted to make something with chicken and cilantro but my husband just hates soup type dinners. The changes made it perfect for our family.

This was a great base recipe!  I did follow other reviews and added cumin and lime.  I also used corn instead of hominy and I added black beans to make it more of a Mexican soup.  I love cilantro, but I was still a little concerned about the amount used, but it was wonderful!

I just cooked this for dinner and my husband and I loved it. I doubled the chicken and hominy and used chicken stalk instead of plain water, simply delicious. Fresh lime is also a must! I can't wait to make it for the whole family.

This was a great recipe!  The ease of making this dish and the bold flavors is wonderful!  I did make a few slight changes:  I used brown rice and cooked it seperately ahead of time.  I seasoned my chicken with Tony Chacheres, garlic powder and pepper and sauteed it with the onions and olive oil.  I used corn instead of hominy and I also added cayenne pepper to the dish to taste.  Once chicken had simmered in the cilantro sauce, I added the rice and corn and simmered the flavors and then cooked out the additional moisture to give the dish a dirty rice consistency.  Great with lime, but doesn't necessarily need it.  Excellent, excellent, excellent!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because, although delicious the night it was made, the reheated leftovers were, well, gross.

My husband stated "very tasty" surprisingly after taking a bite.  We all liked it.  I substituted 1 can chicken broth instead of the cube chicken bouillon and water, used brown rice,  and corn instead of hominy.  Thought it had good flavor, though would have definitely added some lime juice if I had had some on hand and maybe cayenne pepper next time around.

I made the vegetarian version of this recipe and made some changes overall. I used Quorn brand naked cutlets, lemon-infused olive oil instead of veg oil, and cooked the rice with veg bouillon in a rice cooker (no hominy). Both my husband and I thought this was very tasty.

Can't say I was super impressed.  I don't care about the color of food, and it wasn't mushy or any of that.  I also didn't care about the hominy/rice combo, or some of the other problems other people had.  I just didn't think it was terribly exciting -- yes, there's lot of cilantro, but by itself just didn't really do much for me.  But it also wasn't bad and I had a perfectly fine dinner.  Just don't think I have much incentive to make it again.
