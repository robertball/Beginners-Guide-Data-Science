It turned out really well.  I didn't have the large shells but the small ones so it made more like a casserole than stuffed shells.  The only thing I changed was I added about 1/4 cup of chopped onions to the ground beef while it was browning and then we salt and peppered to our own taste at the table.

I made this tonight and my boyfriend loved it! I did however make some small additions. I used leftover taco meat that I had added black beans to and also added some cooked white rice to the stuffing mixture to make it go a little further. It made two pans full! Other than the additions, I made it as is using canned corn and Mexican blend shredded cheese and it turned out great. I also skipped the olives for taste preference. I will be making this again soon. It's a great recipe if you're looking for something new to try with ground beef.

A few minor changes instead of corn and black olives, I substituted black beans and green chilies and added some taco seasoning to the meat.

I made this for my kids and couldn't get past the texture of the noodles after baking them, my kids ate the filling and left the rest.

Made as written except that I did not garnish with sour cream due to personal preference. These turned out really good. Technically we could have just picked them up and eaten them with our hands which makes me think they would be a great finger food for parties and things of that nature. The shell stayed pretty firm and had a nice snap to it. These were easy to make and easy to stuff which is a plus in my book!
