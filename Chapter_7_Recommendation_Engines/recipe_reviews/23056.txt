I thought this was a 5 star finished product, but it takes way longer than 10 min. prep time, melting the butter/cocoa to a boil takes at least that. Make this your first step, so it can be cooling while you deal with the dry ingredients, etc. Rather than struggling to blend eggs and sour cream into a lot of dry stuff, whisk them together separately, and add gradually while running the mixer on Stir for very short periods of time, then add the lukewarm cocoa mix (too hot and you might curdle the batter). Finish by hand. All told, it took 30 to 40 min. to get it in the oven, which is really where the ease begins. It cooks quickly and you don't have to stay up all night waiting for it to cool so you can ice it. Take the time to scale it if your pan is bigger, it is tricky to do the math but it will make a difference, you won't end up with a big flat chocolate cracker. The pan size in the text is 10X15 but the pan size in the header is different; use the 10X15 size. Multiply pan dimensions to give you sq. in. (150 for this recipe; my pan was 192). Divide your pan area by 150, and multiply the result by 35 servings. This tells you what number to plug into the servings box; hit scale and it will automatically do the conversion for you. Odd stuff like 2 1/2 eggs can be rounded to 3 without catastrophe (I did it). Or just go buy a new 10X15 pan.:)PS-sift the sugar for the icing after measuring and before mixing, for no white lumps.

This cake is delicious and simple to make!  Two tips:#1: Have your frosting ingredients set out and ready to go.  After stirring in the powdered sugar, DO work quickly to spread it on the cake.  It does become like fudge consistency as it cools.  #2 If you have not checked to see how level your oven is, you may want to do that before you start. An unlevel surface does show alot on a sheet cake.  Wonderful recipe!! You won't be disappointed!!  Thanks!!!!!!!

An easy recipe for a good, basic sheet cake. Use a 9x11 pan or double the recipe because 10x13 made for a very thin cake!

Yeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaaaa! My native Texan hubby as well as the rest of our family LOVE this cake! We baked this in a 9 x 13 metal pan for 22 minutes - perfection! This was super easy to make. Make sure that you prepare the icing when you are able to put on the cake while it is still warm, preferably right out of the oven. The icing gets stiff fast so the warm cake helps it spread. My family also loves to pair this up with vanilla ice cream. Being from San Antonio where pecan trees are in the back yard, we only make this with pecans, not walnuts. If you are one to worry about calories and fat content this recipe isn't for you, enjoy!  ;-)

I just got done eating ANOTHER bite of this cake.  Unfortunately, I have been doing that all day long!!!  I made it for company last night and I am being tempted with what is left of this large delicious cake!  This was the first time making this cake...I was pleasantly surprised.  If you like chocolate, I don't see how you wouldn't like this cake.  It is moist and rich, but not too rich where you say you can't eat it(obviously I am not having that problem).  I made it in a 10x15 pan, that I thought was only good for making my cookies.  I used Baker's Joy cooking spray to grease my pan(very easy).  This is a thinner cake, but I liked it the way it was.  You have a better icing to cake ratio this way :) I suggest starting the icing approx. 10 minutes prior to the cake coming out of the oven.  That way the cake is done right when you are done with the icing.

This is my favorite sheet cake recipe.  You can change it...

To make a white sheet cake: delete the cocoa and add 1 tsp almond extract to the cake and 1/2 to 1 tsp almond extract to the frosting.

To make a peanut butter sheet cake: add 2/3 c. peanut butter to the cake batter (cook with the butter) and 2/3 c. creamy peanut butter to the frosting.

You can reduce the amount of powdered sugar.  Today I made the peanut butter sheet cake and only used 2.5 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4.5 cups.

I loved that I had all the ingredients on hand, no rushing to the shops for an obscure ingredient.  It did take longer than the 20 mins. to cook - more like 35 for my oven.  I made this for a dinner appointment, it was great, but as it took longer to cook we were late!  When they saw the cake, all was forgiven, thanks Carolyn.
Please note - the mixture is supposed to be thin, don't be alarmed.

(not that day one is shabby mind you)

I've made this cake twice so far. Really a simple, well tasting cake, and moist. The first time the frosting turned out really well, but that's because I think I followed a reviewer's suggestion to just boil the milk and butter alone without the cocoa powder. Combine the cocoa powder with the powdered sugar and then pour the butter/milk in while mixing and add the vanilla. You have to work fast though.

Last night I made this cake again, and the frosting set up so quickly I couldn't spread it on my cake. I didn't know what I had done wrong, until I realized that this time I had mixed in the cocoa with the butter & milk and it basically congealed.  I had to do another batch of frosting. So my cake had a layer of hard frosting covered up with the nice layer. You couldn't tell at all. 

My tips: You could really make the frosting to whatever consistency you like. To make it more spreadable, add more milk to the frosting as it's mixing to thin it out more. It won't harm the texture of the frosting because the frosting will eventually "set" again once on the cake. My frosting turned into a really soft consistency that was great for spreading. 

Also, sift the cake dry ingredients to get a nice, smooth texture. And also sift the powdered sugar for the frosting so that there are no lumps in your frosting. Enjoy!

I made this in a 9 X 13 pan and it came out great.  Very moist.  Make the icing after the cake is baked or it will get crusty. Next time I'm adding more nuts to the icing. Some thought this tasted like a brownie. Mmm...

I made this for my daughter's preschool valentine lunch.  It was soooo delicious; the teachers and kids loved it.  I especially loved the icing; it is incredibly fudgy and yummy.  I left out the walnuts but am sure they would be great.  Definitely need to spread the icing on right out of the oven while the cake's still hot.

Needs more chocolate flavor. It was ok otherwise.
Will not make as written again. I would start with 7 T of cocoa powder for cake and frosting, use buttermilk in the frosting, and maybe try coffee for replacement of the water.

Delicious.  I melted the butter/chocolate first to let it cool while preparing the other ingredients.  Blended the dry, whisked the eggs and sour cream in a separate bowl, then added them to the dry.  Slowly poured in the warm chocolate while mixing so as not to cook the eggs.  Added the powdered sugar to the frosting as the cake was coming out of the oven and immediately poured on the frosting.  Everyone loved it. Will make it again!

So, I accidentally made this cake for the first time using HALF the butter that is called for (used 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup), and my family tells me it's still the best chocolate cake they've ever eaten.  I agree.  It's moist, flavorful and all-around decadent.  I do use high-quality cocoa, and I probably tossed in a bit more than the recipe calls for (more chocolate is always better, right??) I also used a 10x15" pan, and the results were perfect.  My family especially appreciates being able to cut, grab, and go... no plate or silverware necessary :D

This is better than cake. I love Texa sheet cake. There is a recipe on this site for white texas sheet cake that is just as good as this one. If you have never made Texas sheet cake before you must try it at least once, you will be glad you did. This cake is even better the next day. Make sure you have the frosting ready to go when this comes out of the oven, but do not have your frosting ready to early or it will dry out. I use less powder sugar than what it calls for so it is not so stiff. Enjoy, this recipe is a keeper.

This is def. on point. Here are a few tips from my mom Uno: Use black coffee instead of water in the cake part. Dos: Use 1/2 t. almond extract and 1/4 t. vanilla extract in the frosting part. If I eat any more of these I'm going to give myself diabetes.

This cake is unreal, SO good!  It's moist and chocolatey, just what I wanted.  I don't have anything super helpful to add.  I do think it's a good idea to have all of the ingredients for both the cake and the frosting set out because once you get started it goes fairly quickly.  Pour the hot frosting on the hot cake as soon as it comes out of the oven - it sets up pretty quickly.  Most of all, enjoy!

This recipe is a classic.  The frosting is very sweet and must be spread out quickly for the best appearance.  This is great for potlucks since there is plenty to share.

This is the dessert you want to have in the late night hours after everyone has been tucked in and snoring away soundly, while you secretly and quietly munch on this, with a tall glass of milk, in the kitchen, alone, blissfully happy.  This is the chocolate that will quiet those hunger pangs and cravings of something sweet, and chocolatey for a late night, so please do your self a favor and make this, and then after everyone has had their fill, stick it in the fridge, for it it to get a tad cold then make a late night date with this cake (^_^)v

The sheet pan I make this in is very shallow and I usually end up spilling the fudgey topping over the edge. But this time when I made it I poked holes in my cake when it came out of the oven, like a poke cake. The topping is now IN the cake and OMG! I will never make it the "old" way again! Also, on the advice of others, I increased the cocoa in the cake to 6 Tbs. It was perfect!

After looking at all of the Texas Sheet Cake recipes on this site, I chose this one, and boy, am I glad I did!  This cake is VERY EASY to make!  I made two and had them frosted within an hour.  These were for our Wednesday night youth group at church, and they LOVED it!  I lost count of how many came back for seconds and thirds.  This will be a standard in my recipe file from now on.  Thanks so much for a great one!

Delicous! The calories in this cake are unspeakable. I made a large layered birthday cake(doubled the recipe) for my beautiful grandaughter and everyone loved it. I bet I'll be asked to make this every year here after. Do not forget to add the vanilla which is not mentioned in the list of ingredients but is required in the frosting---I used 1t.

Worst Texas Sheet Cake ever! Fell apart when cut. Too cakey. Poor instructions. Took way longer to prepare than estimated. Great ingredients in cake provided extremely disappointing results. Have made other recipes of same cake - will never make this one again.

I made exactly as directed except used a 9 x 13 pan and let it cook for 5 more minutes.    Then, I started the frosting right before taking the cake out. Don't feel that you have to use all of the powered sugar in the frosting. I didn't measure but just used what I though was enough to make it a perfect texture. Probably about 3 cupts. Then I poured it over the cake and spread it around while it was still warm/hot. Yes, I did include the walnuts in the frosting! Great recipe!! Makes a lot and very rich but honestly didn't take much longer to put together than a box cake and much better flavor!

This is the "real" version of TX sheet cake that we grew up with here in Texas.  If you want to try a treat, this is it!  Enjoy.

Very good. Definitely make the icing after the cake is baked and cool cause it hardens quick! After a few days when the icing is pretty stiff on the cake, don't worry! If you toss a piece in the microeave for about 5-10 seconds it melts it and it seeps into the cake and makes it even MORE awesome.

Wow, this has to be the moistest cake I have ever tasted! I guess with all that butter it must be! Very good recipe. My cookie sheet bent up while this was cooking and all of the batter moved to one side and I STILL got rave reviews on this cake. Highly recommend! Just a personal tip - you have to use a mixer of some kind to combine the dry ingredients and the egg and sour cream together...That would be way to hard to do by hand! After that, I would mix everything else by hand.

I love this cake. Its great for birthday parties.However my cousin is turning 16 christmas eve (what an aweful bday YOU HAVE TO SHARE WIH JESUS he tends to upstage her) SO I want to make her a super special cake this year because her birthday is often lost in the holiday celebrations. I was wondering if I could do this as a round layer cake for a different kind of presentation. She requested a chocolate chocolate cake and this is one of my better recipes but I dont want to mess it all up the night before and start over. so bottom line 2 9" round pans ok?

Try making this with 1 cup of strong coffee instead of the water. It adds a depth of flavor to an otherwise plain chocolate cake. I always add a tablespoon of instant coffee granules to the butter and chocolate for the frosting as well. My very favorite cake. The addition of coffee is what makes it the best.

I love this recipe, my grandma has made it since I was a little girl for family functions since it feeds a lot.  Plain is great my grandma mixes it up by puting half a package of mini marshmallows on top of cake and thining the frosting down with a cup less of powdered sugar and then topping the cake.  The frosting hardens a bit over the marshmallows and its so pretty.  It makes if taste like a rocky road cake.  She also makes if using buttermilk for sour cream, but they are interchangeable I don't notice a difference when I don't have one or the other.

Perfect!  An optional choice and for variation is to add a bit of cinnamon and brewed coffee in place of the water.

Made this using about 2 cups of powdered sugar in the icing (because it was all I had) and it was EXCELLENT!!!  It was so easy to make, perfect for when you are doing a big party because it's quick to make and you can do it well ahead of time.  Next time I will try it with the coffee in place of the water.

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe! It is a winner everytime I serve it.  I make mine in a 13x9 with great results. Being native Texans we grew up on this. I'm proud to have it in my recipe box.

I loved this chocolatey delight!  I had a Tex-Mex party last night (chili) and this was a great cake choice.  I had never made sheet cake before, but followed the recipe exactly, had ALL my ingredients measured and lined out, then went for it.  PERFECT!! As reviewers suggested, I sifted everything.  If there is anything I do differently it would be to cook the frosting just a hint longer.  To avoid having it set up too fast on me, the moment I saw bubbles in the mixture, off it came from the heat and then POURED over the cake.  I was afraid it was too runny, but in a few moments it started to thicken.  *whew*  So maybe remove from heat 30 seconds to a minute after it shows those first few bubbles.  My 10x15 sheet pan was the dark non-stick type, so I lowered my oven temp by 25 degrees and grabbed it out after 20 minutes.  It was PERFECT.  Leftovers today are awesome.  Coworkers get to polish it off tomorrow (Monday).  Yum.  A definite recipe for future chocolatey creations. The 10x15 does make alot (duh?) so will try a smaller size next time.  A tiny piece goes a long way.

Excellent!  I recently made this for my younger sister's 16th birthday and she loved it!  (so did I)  I followed the instructions exactly, except I had a LARGER jelly roll pan 17x11 and decided to go ahead and use it instead of the 9x13.  It was thin, but the frosting to cake ratio made it even better.  I cut up all the leftovers into little squares and froze them in between sheets of wax paper.  I take them out, pop them in the microwave 30 seconds whenever I get a chocolatey craving - delicious!!  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS EASY EASY RECIPE.

This cake is so MOIST!  My husband loved it. Before the cake was gone he asked if I had the ingredients to make another one and my mother-in-law wants the recipe so she can make it for a gathering she is having with her sisters.  I will make this cake again!!

I have made this cake many times. I add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to cake batter before cooking.  Start making icing about 5 minutes before cake is done,add 1 teaspoon cinnamon to icing. Ice cake and cover while hot. Makes cake real moist. Everyone that eat's it,loves it. My grandchildren lrequest it all the time.  It taste like fudge.

My husband and his chocoholic brothers love this cake......although, some of them prefer to leave the icing off.

I follow the recipe exactly except that I bake in a stard 9 x 13 pan for a thicker cake and I add 20 minutes to the bake time.

Delicious chocolate cake. Will definitely make this one again. I did not have the correct size pan, so I just used a regular 9 x 13 cake pan and baked for about 22-24 minutes. Turned out awesome and is an easy crowd pleaser.

Yep! This one's a winner...exactly what I was looking for, not a cake not a brownie! Followed the recipe as written...made the frosting about 10 minutes before the cake was done and it was perfect timing. I thought the frosting was just as heavenly as the cake. We refer to  this as picnic cake...hmmmm

Oh my gosh!!!  I'm supposed to take this to a dinner tonight and I couldn't resist sampling.  Super super delicious.  Very moist, not heavy like brownies, just the right sweetness.  The frosting is terrific.  But definitely have your frosting ingredients ready to go when the cake gets done.  It sets up fast!  Used toasted, chopped almonds sprinkled on top of the icing layer.  Will make again for sure.

Was okay. Unfortunately, I expected something much more impressive based on the ratings. It was a bit too heavy and made like a doughy ball in your mouth when eating it. Some said it was so heavy that it was a bit hard to swallow. Also not chocolatey enough. Not horrible, just not amazing. Thanks!

Water?  How last week!  I substituted a cup of Bailey's Irish Cream, and it's delicious.  Next time I'll try Kahlua or coffee and some vanilla extract.  I did not use the frosting, since I'm using the cake for another purpose.  Very yummy, thanks!

When I crave chocolate...this is what I want.  I make one change to my cake.  I add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the cake for just an extra taste.

My grandmother taught me how to make this cake when I was a child.  It is still my favorite cake today.  Personally, I think it should always be made with walnuts.  Thanks for bringing back great memories!!!

I love this recipe!  I converted it to Gluten Free by substituting the flour for Gluten Free  Mama's Almond Blend flour cup for cup.  If you are gluten free you must get some of this stuff!  This cake is wonderful and I take it to all potlucks or anytime I must bring desert!  I also like to add 1 tsp cinnamon and sub coffee for the water.  I also use pecans instead of walnuts.

Really really good!!!   I upped the recipe to 52 servings so it would fill the half sheet pan I have.  I made this for a smallish graduation party of about 20 people and it was almost totally devoured.  Even my daughter who says she hates cake loved it and said I could make this any time I want. The only things I did different were to increase the cocoa slightly and I added a teaspoon or 2 of good vanilla.  Oh, and I left out the nuts.   I am known as the cake lady by a lot of people and this one is definately going in to my aresenal.

This cake was very good. I made it in a 9x13 as others had suggested and will probably not do that again because I like the thinner cake, you get more icing to go around!! Will make again though in a jelly roll pan!! Enjoy!!

I love this recipe so much. Thanks, Carolyn, for submitting it! I have taken this cake to several parties and it is always a big hit. The last time I made it, I increased the cocoa by a few tablespoons in both the cake batter and the frosting. I didn't have enough sour cream, so I added a splash of milk to the cake batter and everything turned out great.  The next time I make this cake, I'm going to try adding a bit of grated orange zest and some orange extract to it. It's heavenly the way it is, though.

This is the best recipe!  I took it to a pot luck at church and my pastor was licking the frosting that had stuck to the tin foil that I had used to cover it during my trip to church!  It really is that good!  :)  Be careful to really allow the ingredients in the sauce pan to cool enough or you will "cook" the eggs in the bowl when you add them together and you will see little flecks of that in your cake.  I was in a hurry the 1st time I made it and made that mistake.  It was still good, though!  I have rectified that mistake in the MANY subsequent makings of this recipe!

This was pretty good.  The cake itself is not too sweet, but I think the frosting made the cake - it was awesome.  Some of the frosting had soaked into the hole that I had poked in the cake to check if it was done, and that part of the cake was really moist and delicious.  So, I think the next time I make this I will try poking several holes in the cake with a fork, and pouring half of the frosting over it and let it soak in before covering the cake with more frosting.  Still, as written, a good recipe to have.

Absolutely delish!!! However, used 9x13 metal pan, so cake AND frosting were thick and rich. Very nice dense cake with lots of chocolate flavor!!

Perfect Texas sheet cake with one exception.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake.  I think it really made a difference.  Wonderful recipe.

We love this recipe!  I had to modify for altitude and it works beautifully!  I reduced the baking soda to only 1/4 of the recommended amount and added 2 TBSP flour.

I was very pleased! Best cake i've ever made from scratch. I used less sugar (1 2/3 c) in the cake, and used about 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little healthier. The frosting was excellent! It really makes the cake, which was super moist. I would agree the cake could have more chocolate flavor, but I still really liked it as is. I used a 9 x 13 pan to transport it easier and it worked just fine. Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake was so surprisingly moist!  I loved it!  I borrowed a pan and it was too big, and I didn't want my cake to turn out like a cracker, so I used my glass, rectangular Pyrex, baking dish instead, so it came out like a cake.  It wasn't like a brownie at all.  I also had to add 20 minutes more to the cooking time because it was not done after 20 minutes.  I do, however, have to side with another reviewer that it needed more chocolate flavor.  The next time I will put 1/2 a cup of water and 1/2 a cup of coffee to the cocoa mixture instead of 1 cup of water.  I also looked at another reviewer's comment about the frosting being "fudgy" or too thick.  I didn't want that, so I used shellann13's Best Chocolate Frosting on this site, which yielded a very creamy, chocolatey frosting.  Altogether, simply delicious!

This was okay.  I have had Texas sheet cake at various picnics, this wasn't exactly it. Edit: This was better the second time around.  I think cutting the recipe to make a smaller cake is a BAD idea.  The second time I made the sheet cake exactly and it is very, very good!  It was gone in two days!

Delicious.  I used pecans, about 2 cups, in the frosting.  Would be good to use nuts in the cake too.
I also used King arthur baking chocolate (about 6 squares each) both in the batter and in the frosting in addition to the cocoa.

Awesome cake!  This recipe makes a large rectangle cake, big enough to serve a large crowd.  It was also big on flavour.  Super moist and light at the same time.  I did ice this cake with a ganache frosting because I made it for a birthday party.  Everyone loved it!

You just can't go wrong with this recipe. It has been around for a very long time and we all know why. It's pretty simple to prepare and it never fails to please. The only problem I run into when preparing it is, I can't seem to keep out of it!

I didn't change the recipe for the cake at all. However I used pecans instead of walnuts for the icing. This IS a Texas sheet cake, after all. I did not have a 10x15 pan so I used a 13x9 pan and baked it an additional 15 minutes and it came out fine.

Excellent cake!  Revised slightly by reducing sugar to 1 cup and adding 1/2 cup splenda.  Also reduced the icing to 1/2 the amount.

I was expecting great things according to all the rave reviews.  Maybe it will taste better tomorrow, but I find this cake is lacking flavour.  I followed the recipe exactly and made no alterations or substitutions.  It turned out like it should have, directions were easy to follow, but I am not happy with the "bland" flavour of this cake. Unless it is a lot better tasting tomorrow I will not be making this cake again.

I have been making this cake for 25+ years.  Family and friend favorite.  Try using a clay jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper.  The cake will cook more evenly and you can then just lift the cake out of the pan and use a pizza cutter for easy slicing and serving.

I've been making this for years!!!! It's a fabulous cake. It should be made in a jelly roll pan not 9x13 and it is supposed to be frosted right out of the oven. That's what gives the cake such a moist  and fudgey texture.  It should then be chilled and cut I to squares. It freezes very well.

Absolutely delicious!  I read all the comments and decided to double the recipe and made it in a 1/2 sheet cake pan since I was baking for a large group.  It turned out fine, but a little thicker than the typical thin Texas sheet cake. The recipe as is  would work fine with a jelly roll pan.  However, if you prefer a little thicker cake you can make it in a 9x13 pan.  Either way works, you may just have to cook it slightly longer in the smaller pan.  I also like a good Mississippi Mud Cake, so I added one little step.  Immediately after I took the cake out of the oven, I poured marshmallows on top of the cake and then poured the icing on top.  It was wonderful!  The kids I made it for raved about it. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Heavenly, chocolatey, buttery taste!  I have an odd-sized pan, 12.5" x 15.5" so I increased the levels accordingly and it fit the pan perfectly. Here were my totals for a slightly larger quantity:
3 cups flour
3 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
(Mix dry ingredients together)
--3/4 cup sour cream
--3 eggs
(Mix eggs and sour cream together to add later)
1 1/2 cups butter
1 1/2 cups water
6 tablespoons cocoa
(Heat to a boil, then pour over dry ingredients, then add sour cream and egg mixture.)
Bake five minutes longer for larger batch, 25 minutes total at 350.

The frosting doesn't need to be changed since the surface area is similar.   Thank you, Carolyn, for this incredibly delicious recipe.

This cake is fantastic! Every time I make it, I get rave reviews and it's gobbled up. I made it once as listed and it was wonderful; one other time I made it with Hershey's "Special Dark" cocoa powder. It made both the cake and the icing very dark in color (almost black), and tasted delicious! Not that different from the origingal version taste-wise, maybe not quite as rich. Anyway, I LOVE this cake and am making another one today! Thanks for the recipe, Carolyn! P.S. - It also freezes very well. I made a whole cake, let it cool, iced it, let that cool, cut it into squares, placed in a disposable aluminum pan, wrapped in saran wrap and covered in fool, and froze it for 2 weeks before taking it to a family function. It took about a day to thaw out, but then tasted as fresh as if I'd made it that day!

Very good, a classic Texas Sheet Cake recipe. I've made this twice, once in the traditional jelly roll pan and it came out a bit thin, but we liked that you could pick it up and eat it like a brownie. The 2nd time I tried a regular 9x13 and it was more moist and cake-y. I'd say equally good both ways and I'll probably go back and forth on the type of pans I use depending on the occasion. Others mentioned that the icing is finicky and gets hard if made too soon, but I love how it sets up on the cake with its slightly crusty texture around the edges. Mmmmmm

This is a great cake! I have made it twice now, once with a half sheet pan (ingredients calculated for 52 servings) and today in my stoneware jelly roll pan. It was perfect both times but needed about an extra 8 minutes of bake time. The only change I made to the recipe was using coffee instead of water.

made exactly as written - turned out perfectly!  moist, not too rich, served a bunch of people.   beat eggs/sour cream separately so they would mix in well and easily with dry ingredients and then added dry to the wet.  fantastic and pretty.

Growing up in Texas, this cake is a tradition.  Try adding about 1/2 cup drained maraschino cherries to the icing.  May sound weird, but it has always been done in my family.

This is my favorite brownies. I make them for birthday cakes for my son at school. They are finger food. A tip would be to start your icing as soon as you put the cake in the oven.  enjoy.

This was wonderful. The frosting was so fudgy. Next time I would add another tablespoon of cocoa to the cake itself. It could have been a little more chocolate.

Yummmm! I followed the ingredient measurements exactly. I made it in a 9x13 pan because that's what I had, and I had to bake it longer. I did check it every 5 mins after the 20 min mark; the toothpick finally came out clean after 35 minutes. I followed others' suggestions to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture and also to sift the confectioners sugar for the icing, which eliminated any lumpiness. It turned out to be such a moist cake with smooth chocolaty icing...just great!

Always a hit!! I did not change a thing, except I used a 9x13 pan and I cooked it for 27-30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. I prepare the frosting in the last five minutes that the cake is cooking and make sure to pour it over warm cake!

This is an awesome cake!  SO very moist and chocolatey!!  It is simple to make and uses ingredients I typically have on hand.  It comes out perfect every time and always gets rave reviews when I make it for potlucks and such.  TIP: Maybe this goes without saying for some, but I sift the cocoa and the powdered sugar before using to minimize the clumps and lumps.

This cake is really good.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour.  The batter is easy to make.  I used my stand mixer to mix it; I wasn't sure if I should do that or do it by hand.  When 5 minutes were left on the timer (for my cake baking) I started making the frosting.  You have to work really quickly with the frosting because it sets up really fast.  It almost didn't spread to the edges of my cake, and my cake was still pretty warm.  I love the frosting!

Yummy!  I had some cake like this a few days ago at work and went searching for the recipe.  I'm glad I found this one! Very moist, gooey,  and chocolatey.  I left out the nuts because the kids don't care for them,  it was still great.  The cake I had at work just had some nuts sprinkled on top.  I did not have a jelly roll pan,  so I just baked it in a regular cake pan that was a little bigger than a 9x13, still took 20 minutes.  Also,  I used Dutch Process cocoa.  A keeper.

This is a great recipe but I would suggest that you mix all the wet ingredients first then add the dry ingredients for the best results. I added pecans instead of walnuts!

No way to mess this up.  Very good.  I have also made it with buttermilk instead of sour cream.  Just as good!  
I will note one other thing if you are interested in lowering the fat.  I don't usually like to use lite or low fat ingredients when baking.  But, one time I only had lite sour cream in the fridge.  It turned out great and tasted the same as using full fat sour cream.

I made this for a family gathering this weekend--a total hit!  I made one change, which I got from another posted recipe.  Instead of one cup of water, I added one cup of coffee.  A great cake--easy, quick, and delicious.  I started making it at 11:00, and was out the door with it frosted and wrapped at noon.  I love the fact that you don't have to wait for it to cool before you frost it.  How convenient!  Thanks for posting!

This cake is sooooo good! So moist and chocolat-ey! I always have these ingredients on hand and it's so quick to put together that it's perfect when you *have* to have some chocolate. I bake it in my stoneware cookie sheet which never needs greasing. Everyone loves it - thanks!

I made this cake for a staff meeting held today; it was a hit.  I substituted self-rising flour for the flour, soda and salt, it worked just as well.  The biggest complaint I have is the prep time was much longer than 10 minutes for me (having to cook part of the cake ingredients as well as the icing), and the icing was way too thick to spread; I had to add more milk to get a spreading consistency.  I remember this cake having a teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter, which I added; with my little modifications, this was a good cake.  I also lined the jelly roll pan with foil which I find works better than prepping with butter/shortening and flour.  I would make this cake again, especially to serve a crowd of chocolate lovers.

I used to make this cake years ago.  This one is even better.  My old recipe used buttermilk instead of sour cream.  I didn't have the right size jelly roll pan so I used more of a large rectangular cake pan.  I poked small holes in the cake for the frosting to seep into.  This cake is dangerous if you are trying to watch your diet.  It is hard to stay away from!  My family loves it.

I've eaten and made a lot of cakes, and this is by far my favorite chocolate one! It's rich, moist, and chocolatey. It does take a fairly long time to put together, so set aside some time for this one. It'll be worth it! I've made the cake three times so far, and here are my tips:

1) I used a 9x13 pan with no issues. Baking time just increased by about 5 minutes, but this will vary so err on the side of under-baking and check it! Bake longer if needed. I sprayed my pan with cooking/baking spray and sprinkled a fair amount of coco powder on top. The cake won't stick to the bottom as much this way!

2) Do the hot mixture as one of your first steps, and let it cool down completely!! This is a big one. The pot should be cooled down enough where you can touch the bottom comfortably.

3) While the hot mixture is cooling down, pre-heat the oven, measure out the remaining ingredients for the cake, and MIX THEM THOROUGHLY!  Add the hot mixture once it's completely cool.

4) Make the frosting while the cake is in the oven. It'll give you something to do while the cake is baking! Once the cake is out of the oven, plop that frosting on! The hot cake will help it spread easily.

BRAVO! I read 1st 5 reviews & that was very helpful. Especially to  get that frosting timed to the cake being done so it'll all be warm and spread easier. That is spreads thin so don't be alarmed. I personally will make a little more frosting & a pinch thinner next time cuz I added a lot of nuts and didn't spread out well. Followed recipe to the T & it's really just perfect as is.

Great cake, made for my daughter's birthday. It was nicely moist and very chocolate-y.  However I made a number of changes based on past experience with cake making. I made it in a 9X13 glass pan and cooked for  35 minutes.  Also thought it was too much icing for this size cake so I halved the recipe and it was plenty.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted plain unsweetened greek yogurt.  Melting butter was done in the microwave , so I made the cocoa mixture hot but not boiling. I followed the recipe, though next time I may do it the way most cakes are done: mix all dry ingredients, then mix all wet ingredients in separate bowl, then beat the dry into the wet ones.  The chocolate icing was made on the stove as directed, and would be great used in other recipes.  This cake is sooo  good!!

Love it!  So easy.  I did not have sour cream and substituted buttermilk for the water and sour cream using about 1-1/4 cups and everything else the same.  Delicious!  I will make again the way it is supposed to be.  Some of the reviews say it is not chocolatety enough, but I used Penzeys cocoa powder and not Hershey's. It was yummy, moist, sweet, not overly fudgey like a brownie. Also agree work fast with the icing.  It sets up fast and if you keep spreading it, the lovely shiny finish will be lost.  The pan was 9 X 13 and baked a bit longer but was about 1-1/2 inches thick. Soooo good!
Made this again last night ..... Did not have sour cream again...used Greek yogurt.  Oh my goodness this recipe is so forgiving.  Yummy again!  Also realized I forgot to add the vanilla to frosting but it was still yummy.  Used Penzeys cocoa powder and it is so chocolatety and good!

I've been making this sheet cake for probably 30 years. The only difference is that my recipe calls for 1 tsp of cinnamon.  The cinnamon gives the flavor a little more depth. I've forgotten it once, and it definitely tastes better with. Oh, and you can easily substitute milk for the sour cream too. Definitely a family favorite.

I remember having this at picnics while growing up. When searching for a dessert recipe to use for a county western bbq/concert this is what came to mind. It was easy to make. We made 5 of them, they are were devoured and had many recipe requests. That's a great recipe.

I have made this cake many times over the years for various occasions, but lately I have been asked to bring it for bereavement dinners as everyone loves this cake and it goes a long way.  The last time I made it, I did not have any milk, so I used sour cream in the frosting as well as the cake. It is delicious and I think that is the way I will make it from now on.  I also used a 9 X 13 pan instead of a sheet pan, and iced while hot.  Not that it was bad the first day, but I thought it was better the second day.

Yesterday was my husband's birthday and I hadn't been able to prepare in advance for anything because I'd been sick. I wanted to bake him a cake that would be special. Decided to try this recipe and boy was it a hit! This will definitely be on our favorites list from now on! Like other reviewers have said, I used a 9X13 pan because that was all I had. It took a little more than 20 minutes to bake because it was deeper. Also, I wish the recipe said to melt the butter for the icing before you put in the milk and cocoa. I'm not a great cook and didn't think to do that. I just put it all in the saucepan at once and cooked it and the icing curdled a little and separated. But once I put the confectioners sugar in, it all blended ok. I was glad other reviewers had said to spread the icing on the cake quickly as soon as it came out of the oven. My thought was to let the cake cool first. It pays to read the instructions! :)

Simply fantastic. Easy and perfect. I did use canned frosting (gasp!) on the very warm cake for times sake. I thought the canned frosting would ruin the cake (it was for a large group of young adults) but it was very good. This is a cake I will use for the future- for a sheet cake I can't imagine there is a better recipe to be found.

I have made this so many times and it's ALWAYS a hit. I always end up using more confectioner's sugar than the recipe suggests in order to get a firm frosting that doesn't ooze. This recipe rocks.

I hate chocolate cake but I love this cake. It is a mix between chocolate cake and a brownie. People have requested that I make this cake on several occasion.

Excellent cake. The frosting sets up quick so make sure your cake is done and warm or soon to come out of the oven.

I made this for my sweetie's birthday and brought it into the office today for him to share.  EVERYONE raved about it.  I added a tiny bit of cinnamon, but that was my only deviation from the recipe.  It's dense and moist and full of flavor.  It was my first cake from scratch and it couldn't have been easier, thanks!

I liked the cake but the pan size is off a little.  I measured and used my Wilton 10.25 x 15.25" pan.  It came up over the top of the pan which is fine, but the frosting is put on a warm cake so there is no place for it to go but drip down the sides.  I will use a slightly larger sheet cake pan next time.  Also, I didn't add all the confectioner sugar to the frosting.  I probably used about 3 cups and it was then spreading consistency so I didn't want to add more and make it too stiff.  It spread easily and tasted good.

This cake is exceptional; and I am a picky baker. It was fairly simple to make, the texture is superb and the frosting was so good, I was eating it with a spoon. I made it in an 9x11 and it worked out well. My search for a good Texas Sheet Cake is over. Thank you for a recipe worth the time and the calories.

This is very similar to a recipe I've used for years.  Mine uses buttermilk instead of sour cream, and slightly less cocoa.  It's a hit everywhere I take it.  Feeds a crowd.  I prefer to bake it a jellyroll pan rather than regular cake pan.  Seems to make a moister cake with just the right cake to frosting combo.  A good Southern staple cake.

sour cream and cinnamon, to give it some Texas sass!

I doubled this recipe, and I'm pretty sure that I accidentally used 5 teaspoons of cocoa instead of 5 tablespoons, and I still got tons of compliments on this cake! It was excellent, and the frosting was soooo good, too!

You can't go wrong with a basic chocolate cake.  Not quite as good as 20-minute chocolate cake, but definitely satisfies a raging sweet tooth.

I hate chocolate cake, but I liked this.  The people I made it for (the ones who actually like chocolate cake) loved it.  By request, I used Caramel Frosting IV from this site instead of the suggested frosting.

The cake felt like something was missing for some reason (but I don't know what) but the icing was fantastic, and tasted just like hot chocolate.

Made this again as the finish to a BBQ dinner.  I cut back the sugar in the cake to 1 and a half cups and in the icing to 3.  No noticeable difference in taste - just a little easier on the teeth and waistline.  Success and coliments all around.

Love this cake and frosting. Very easy to make and always a crowd pleaser. I usually make two cakes with my 2 - 1/4 sheet pans. That way I can throw one in the freezer. The 1/4 sheet size is plenty unless you're feeding a crowd! I thaw the cake and just pour the hot frosting on it and it's just as good as freshly made!

The frosting didnt set up as well as I would have hoped, I added extra powdered sugar and cocoa powder because I was worried it was too runny and it still was soupy. Put in the fridge for a bit after putting the icing on to help with that, was good but really sweet w/all the powdered sugar

I followed this recipe exactly except I used 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting and I used a 9x13 pan. Very easy recipe and so good. The cake is moist and no changes needed for high altitude. My parents and grandma and I all loved it. Thank you!

I haven't eaten this yet but this was waaaaay more time consuming than it listed.  Maybe it's because I didn't have the jelly roll pan and the cake took a little longer in a 9x13 pan, but trying to time everything perfectly was a little difficult.  The prep time was SO much longer than 10 minutes.  I am hoping the taste makes up for the long prep...

Awesome! I used coffee instead of water for the cake mix and used a 9x13 inch pan. It took 30 minutes to fully bake in my oven. Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts but either would be good. In my opinion, the nuts are a must. My husband loved it! Thanks for a winning recipe! Saved to my recipe box.

My mother used to make something very similar to this- I have to say, though- this recipe is better than my mothers!!  I made this for a coworkers birthday and it was a big hit.  I was in a rush the night before, slapped the icing on and immediately put the lid on the cake pan- the end result was a very rich, very moist cake with icing and a lava-like something or other in between- DELICIOUS!!

I made this cake for my birthday party after discovering that my husband had bought a medium sized cake from our local "cake lady". This cake was way better then the professional cake, everyone said so!

SO Good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out so delicious.   My husband and kids can't stop eating it.  The only thing I might do differently next time is cook it a minute or two longer.

Great recipe! Just like my grandma used to make. That fudge frosting is wonderful. I made this for a friend's birthday once and everyone loved it and went for second helpings. I really recommend this cake.

I first made this for my son's Boy Scout Troop's pot luck.  It was in and out of the oven, frosted and ready to go in less than 45 mins.  I was amazed how simple and quick it took to make.  At the Pot luck it disappeared in minutes.  I never had a chance to try it since it went so quick, but the comments I got were beyond anything I could have imagined from such a simple recipe.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!  Since then it's been a signature dish of mine to make and I've made it  no less than a dozen times for different occasions.  When in doubt of what to bring this is always a crowd pleaser!!

It's awesome--our new family favorite. This cake always turns out moist, with just that perfect bit of fudginess on top underneath the icing (I think it's even better the second and third day, IF and when it ever lasts that long, lol :). Every time I make this for guests or to bring to functions, people ask me for the recipe.

This was an awesome cake! The only thing is that it took more like 30 or 40 minutes to cook, but that was probably because I used a different sized pan. Everyone loved this recipe, and I loved how it was more dense than a normal cake, and the frosting was the perfect topping. Although, I read other comments about how the cake was thinner, and mine was very thick! Again, that was probably because I used a different pan. :)

This cake is most delicious. Absolutely a crowd pleaser.  I have made it for years and it is the best.   I add about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the cake batter (a subtle difference) and it is the bomb!!!
My favorite and none better!!!

Definitely a keeper. The cake is moist, light and easy to make (though it takes more than 10 minutes to prepare). My only criticism: the icing is a little too sweet. Next time, I think I'll use less sugar and more cocoa and replace half of the water with strongly brewed coffee.

Stop at this one!  This was so delicious and easy to make just as written.  Made it for my daughter's 6th bday and it was gone!  Start the frosting a couple of min. before the cake comes out of the oven so you can pour it on when it is done.

The is a 5 star.  I guess I didn't work quickly enough with the frosting as it started to set up on me.  However, I think I will not add the whole 4 cups of confectioners sugar unless I really need it.  It was a bit thick.  Other than that, easy to make and DELICIOUS.  Thanks for the recipe

Excellent cake!  The only thing I would change is to use a larger pan, possibly a 1/2 sheet pan would work better.  This is a very moist, and absolutely delicious cake - husband and son LOVED it!  Will make again!  Thanks!

I made this in a 13x9 pan and took it to a soup supper in which our group had to provide the desserts. I didn't use the frosting recipe as I was in a hurry, but I will make the frosting next time. I recd rave reviews on this dessert.  Especially, from my husband, he wanted to know how come I don't make this at home for him... Go figure...

This cake is Awesome! I made for a dinner on Saturday...it was gone in no time. And the compliments made my day:) I did add 1 1/2 TBSP of instant coffee to the water. I topped the cake with chopped pecans and chopped andes mints. My husband requested I make a cake just for him! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

YUM! This is very moist cake. The flavor developed overnight and was even better the next day. Danger, though, it is hard to stop munching on. I made it without reading the reviews and wish I had read about the frosting. My frosting sat for a while during the baking and cooled, so when I spread it on the warm cake, it was thick and I had to go little by little to cover the cake. Be sure to prep the icing about 10 minutes before you pull the cake out of the oven, it will have a much smoother appearance and presumably be easier!

I have made this for years with one slight difference--add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Delicious either way!

My mom made this for us kids years ago and I loved it then. Maybe its just the difference that comes with age but this time around I thought the frosting was WAY too sweet. Even the texture of it was like biting through solid powdered sugar. Its a shame too, because the cake itself was tasty. I may make the cake again, but I'll use some other frosting recipe next time.

The taste is nice, but not OMG.  The chocolate flavor seems a little "thin" - maybe some chocolate chips would help?  However, the frosting made a very nice, smooth surface, which was great for piping a design on, and it was devoured at a potluck, so it couldn't have been bad.  I did have to start the frosting over though, mine "broke" right as it came to a boil (the oil separated from the solids).  The next batch, I heated it slower and didn't let it get to a full boil.

Just what a sheet cake should be like. I was out of all-purpose flour, so I used self-rising flour. If it rises too much you can slice off the middle, risen part. There is no taste difference when you use the sour cream in this recipe. Still just as yummy though!

This was PERFECT! I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa to the batter, and had to add a little more milk to the frosting (it was too thick to spread). Everyone loved it.

Delicious and moist cake, made exactly as written.  Just like grandma used to make when I was a kid! I tried this recipe the first time for a Memorial Day potluck, and have made it several times since then for gatherings. The only negative is that there are never any leftovers to bring home (much to my husband's disappointment).

I found this exact recipe from a different source years ago and have been making ever since.  I've tried a number of other variations and always come back to this version...my husband requests every year for his birthday.  It's a little extra work, but worth every minute!! YUMMY!!

It was okay, make sure you use the pan size it indicates. The frosting is what makes it 4 stars and not 5! ... it was too rich for my taste! Otherwise, it was an easy recipe to make.

I bake in a 9" springform pan for parties & display on a cake plate. Takes much longer to cook that way, up to an hour. Very rich, chocolate taste & always a big hit! Great with Dreyers 1/2 the fat Vanilla Bean ice cream on the side.

I have made this two times and my son is is a "chocoholic" loves it.  I did add an extra tablespoon of cocoa to the batter and an extra tablespoon of milk to the icing. The icing sets up quickly so be sure you are ready to put it on the warm cake when it comes out of the oven. It is tasty and easy.

So good.  Rich and chocolatey.  I baked mine in a sheet pan and got nice frosting to cake ratio.  Very good the next day as well.  A huge hit in my family and neighborhood (gotta share those calories).

I made this for a friend's birthday- none had ever has texas sheet cake before and we all LOVED it! I omitted the nuts because of allergies and it was still great. We heated up pieces in the microwave and served it with vanilla ice cream... the fudgy warm cake with melting ice cream was amazing! I found it not quite as tasty when at room temperature.

Excellent!  I've tried other sheet cake recipes and they all were dry and plain.  This was was moist, fudgy, and delicious!  Everyone loved it....was very easy and quick to put together.  Definitely make sure you put on the icing while the cake is still warm, as the icing will start hardening before you can finish spreading it!  Superb!

Hi, I made this "cake" today, it did take longer than 30mins to cook for me it took 40 mins. I thought it was good but not a cake will probably make again. My husband and I thought it tasted like brownies.    
Thanks...

Very good chocolate cake.  Very moist.  So easy my 3yr old helped make it (he stirred).  But...it was nothing "spectacular".  Note: it took longer than 30 min to cook through.

To die for!  Easy & delicious w/ ingrediants you already have!  Smooth without being too rich.  I wonder how it would be to add some peanut butter in lieu of some butter in the icing - maybe we'll try that next.  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe.

This is the best chocolate cake ever!  The best thing about it is, you almost always have all of the ingredients on hand.  I added 1/2 t of instant coffee to the icing, delicious.

This cake is exactly the kind that I remember that mother would make.  Very good!  My husband and I love it.  It is very moist and rich and so yummy!  It is hard to resist the icing--it is the best!  It took me a little longer than 10 minutes but it usually takes me longer to make things than it says.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and yummy.  I make this often, the ingredients are most always on hand.  Sometimes with walnuts, sometimes without.  Good both ways.  Frosting sets up quickly, move fast when frosting the hot/warm cake.

If I could give this 10 stars I would. I made this for company on Sunday and it was a huge hit. I tried a cake like this at a bake sale once and immediately came home and looked up the recipe on here. I chose this one out of the lot of them and am so glad I did. This is a definate keeper! I didn't add the nuts and it was still yummy! Thanx!!!!!

The icing was pure decadence.  Which we love in this household.  :)  The cake itself, however, wasn't as spectacular as we had hoped.  I may keep looking for a new cake recipe but go ahead and use this icing.  The only change I made was using pecans (bc of a walnut allergy).  But I'm still looking forward to eating it till it's gone bc it's still chocolate cake!  :)

I played with this recipe a bit -- added some vanilla instant pudding mix (because I didn't have chocolate on hand), made my tablespoons of cocoa heaping, and also added some chocolate chips to the batter -- and the result is very yummy. I had to add a bit of extra milk to the frosting, because it was too dry at first.  I will definitely make this again.

This cake is so rich and yummy!  Reminds me of my mom's cooking (she's from Texas of course).  I followed the recipe exactly except I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Easy to make.  Will definitely make again.  :)

My aunt always made Texas sheet cakes for out family reunions and that was the one time a year that we were able to enjoy them.  After searching for this recipe on this website, I decided to give it a try myself.  I have made it two times in the past month and both times it turned out excellent!!!  Now I don't have to wait a year to taste this delicious and easy dessert!  In fact, I made one today to take into work for the birthday of a coworker! Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was a  good cake.  It actually tasted better after two days but was a hit on the first.  I made two rectangular cakes and layered them.  I made extra frosting and put it between the two layers and then on top of the cake.  The cake tasted super gourmet- much better than a normal birthday cake.  The sour cream gives it an extra kick and the frosting is great, and not too heavy.  It was easy to make, easy to cook and easy to eat.

YUM! this got raves at the 4th of July picnic I brought it to. I love the fudgy frosting. I did thin it eeeever so slightly w/ some more milk and used a hand mixer to mix in the powdered sugar. I used whole milk and regular sour cream (I don't think this cake was meant to ever be lowfat!). The cake had a wonderful chocolate flavor which might be because I used dutch process cocoa instead of plain? I used pecans instead of walnuts which turned out fine. This cake went wonderfully w/ homemade vanilla ice cream.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe. I used the Special Dark cocoa powder as a substitute to the regular cocoa powder and it turned out amazing. I also only had 1/4 cup of sour cream on hand so I added a 1/4 cup of lite vanilla Yoplait yogurt to make the 1/2 cup and it worked like a charm. If you are a chocolate lover, this cake will definitely satisfy your craving!  I made the frosting a little more runny by adding more milk so I could poke holes in the cake and the frosting would sink into the cake. I highly recommend doing this. It’s delicious!!!!

I didn’t make any changes to this recipe, and it turned out perfectly! I made it as a teenager and used the larger sheet pan, but I lost that recipe so decided to try this one. It was so perfect, and everyone loved it so much, that there was nothing leftover...lol. 2 things I want to mention: the batter is runny-you pour not spread. 20 minutes cooking time was perfect.  And, for the icing, once you add the powdered sugar, mix it very quickly and pour over warm cake. You only have seconds before it’s set. In fact, try to let it run on its own, spreading it as little as possible, and you’ll have a smooth top to your cake!

I did add an extra tbsp of cocoa in the frosting for a bit more taste. I also used a metal 9x13 pan for a thicker cake. I extended the cooking time by 5 minutes.

Added espresso powder to ramp up the chocolate flavor, perfectly moist and I can't stop eating it.

This cake is awesome as written in the original recipe. We loved it! I decided to try a few changes of my own. The cake is great so give it a try & mix things up a bit and you'll still have a winner! I doubled this recipe as written in the amounts of all the dry ingredients & added 1 Tblsp of cinnamon. I used 1 C. milk with a Tblsp of lemon juice as a substitute for the sour cream. I substituted 2 cups of butter flavor Crisco for the butter, used  4 eggs, and 2 tsp of vanilla & 2 cups of strong black coffee instead of the water.  I baked it in a huge 12x18 sheet pan. I made the icing as written just increased all the ingredients by half & making the icing thinner. I poked several holes throughout the cake & poured the warm icing over the cake. Totally delicious!

It might be because I'm at high altitude but I had to leave it in the over for 40 minutes.  I thought the 20 minutes sounded too soon and it was.  After 40 minutes I took it out of oven, put the topping on, it looks delicious.  Waiting for it to totally cool down.

I have made this countless times and it's always a hit! I also poke holes with toothpick all over the cake before I pour the frosting on so that it seeps in at the holes. SO GOOD.

This is amazing! Definitely sweet, so a little piece is plenty- with ice cold milk! I had to spindle. It’s on one end instead of mixing icing for my husband who does t like nuts, but it was just as good! Will definitely make for big groups!

This is a great recipe if you need a dessert for a large crowd.  It's a little on the sweet side (I omitted the walnuts) but it still had good flavor and texture.

things that I did differently; I didn’t have an electric beater so I used a spatula to beat it by hand and I used a 9’ by 11’ pan. I had prepared the icing before the cake came out. 
when I went to take out the cake at 20 minutes the middle of it looked soupy so I left it in and checked on it twice about 10 minutes later It was ready.

This was a big hit at our company's end of the season cookout! As suggested by others, I added a cup of coffee in lieu of the water. I also added more vanilla extract. Moist and delicious! This recipe is definitely going in my sweets recipe box.

The cake is good. The cake pan dimensions are not correct for a true sheet cake, so it takes about 30 minutes to bake, it was a "normal" chocolate cake. Also, the instructions need to be read very carefully as the ingredients are jumbled between the cake and frosting, so I rewrote them out so they made a little more sense. Good luck.

I really liked this one. I made it as is always the first time.  It's very rich with butter. It is more like a pudding cake to me. Maybe next time I'll try it with just one stick of butter as well, but overall its very good

I made it vegan. I used two tablespoons of chia seeds  and six tablespoons of water as a substitute for eggs and soy milk for the sour cream and milk and it was excellent! My wife did not notice the difference.

I made this for a large family gathering. Everyone loved it!  Per the suggestions on here, I doubled the cake recipe and cooked it for 40 mins.  The icing, unfortunately, I made while the cake was cooking. So by the time it was done, the icing was stiff and hard.  I put small dollops all over the hot cake and placed it back in the oven for about 5 mins. It spread fine after that. Next time I will wait until there is only 10 mins cooking time left of the cake.

These are so yummy!  I like to turn them into marshmallow brownies by putting on a layer of marshmallows while they are still hot, and putting them back in the oven for 2 min, then drizzle with the frosting!   YUMMY!  I also found that they turned out a little dry the first few times I made them.  I use an 11 x 17 dark pan and cooked them for 20 min at 325.  They were perfect!!

fantastic!  I used 1/2 c less white sugar, and a full cup less of the powdered sugar, it tasted great, you never miss it. I also added coffee - prob 1/2 cup in both the cake and frosting. I also added cola to the cake instead of water

Good, but kinda plain.  SUPER easy though, and if you're looking for something for your first ever baking project (as I was), this is a great choice.

I don't know what I did wrong, it was awful. I baked it for my sons birthday. It come out with texture like fudge, I have replaced my baking soda and baking powder, thinking they were old. There are too many recipes I want to try to worry about this one.

Love this recipe; this cake always goes fast with the family.  I use a 13 x 9 pan, so my baking time is always longer - probably at least 35 minutes. Also, I like to add about a teaspoon of cinnamon when making the cocoa powder mixture - both for the batter and the icing.  Very important to not make the icing until you are sure your cake is only a couple of minutes from coming out of the oven, and work fast to get it on the cake shortly after you mix it with the powdered sugar.  I use a hand mixer to blend in the powdered sugar in 3-4 batches, and the frosting comes out very smooth.

It was a good, moist cake, made as directed. I think it needs some cinnamon, personally.

I have made this many times. Was looking for this recipe for a long time. My best cook aunt used to bring this to all our large family gatherings. This tastes the same!! It is very good and I get compliments every time I take it to any potluck. Good with or without walnuts. You just gotta know your crowd for that!!!! Also, I never have milk in the house and the fact that it uses sour cream is great!! I also use sour cream and a little water for the frosting instead of milk cuz I never have milk in the house!! Easy recipe and rave reviews!!

Oh my! My husband asks for this all the time! The recipe is wonderful. The only thing I do differently, is to heat the butter, water & cocoa mixture before mixing the dry ingredients.  This allows it to cool enough to add to the egg, sour cream, flour & sugar mixture.

this was a hit!   I was a little nervous after first pouring the frosting over as it seemed like it would never firm up.  After a few hours, it firmed up nicely and was so shiny -  gorgeous!
My only changes was I substituted black coffee in place of water (helps bring out the chocolate flavor without tasting like coffee), and I used special dark cocoa powder.

Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup oil instead of the 1 cup butter and it was wonderfully moist.

I love this recipe.  I didn't change anything at all.  Followed instructions to the letter and It turned out perfect.  Prep time actually took me 12 minutes and it was in the oven.  I made mine in a 9 X 13 glass dish so adjusted the time to 32 min.  It is a very good recipe and I will be making this again!

I don't think it mentioned that the sheet cake pan should be DEEP enough.  I used an "old" pan I had, the correct measurements, but it wasn't deep enough, so I had to run to the store and buy a new one and re-pour the batter into it.  ALSO, don't know how this happened but the frosting separated.  When I took it off the heat, after following the directions precisely, the oil (butter) was separated from the cocoa/milk mixture -- in other words it didn't mix well.  I added the confectioner's sugar and vanilla anyway, and no surprise, it came out gloppy -- unusable.  If you experts can tell me what little thing I must have done to mess it up, please enlighten me.  Now I'll probably have to purchase a milk chocolate ready-made frosting to finish it off .  :(

My hubby loved this. He told me to give it a 7 on a 5 point scale.  (Perhaps he's had a bit too much sugar.)  
 I followed the directions (but no nuts).  In the future I will make the icing in the final 5 minutes of the baking process and put the icing on right away because my icing did dry out.  No problem as I just added a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream to the icing and continued mixing until it loosened up enough to spread.  Next time, I may add a couple of tablespoons of bourbon to the icing.  Cause that's how we do things in Kentucky.

For some reason, I did not get enough frosting to cover the entire cake? The frosting was very stiff and did not spread easily like the video. My only complaint. 
I substituted my creamer because I don't keep milk around.
Otherwise the flavor was good.

I followed the suggestion of MAC13 but I put in a 9x13 pan and baked it for 35 minutes. It came out so moist and rich. My family said it was the best I had EVER made.

Made this for the first time & it turned out excellent! No need to make any changes. Previous comments suggested using buttermilk instead of sour cream or coffee instead of milk but there are other recipes on this site with those ingredients if you wish to do that. Also if your frosting congeals or hardens just reheat! If you want to avoid lumps in your frosting make sure your butter is completely melted & stir continuously & sift powdered sugar beforehand..

I have made this twice and it was a hit both at home and at a work potluck.  I subbed dutch process cocoa for the frosting and it came out amazing, like a piece of fudge on a super moist cake.  The frosting could use less sugar I think.

This recipe is super easy to make.  It raised perfectly and tastes great!  My only suggestion would be to ice the cake when it first comes out of the oven rather than when it is "warm" because it is much easier to spread the icing. I used a cookie sheet (with sides) that was slightly larger than what the recipe says, but it turned out great. Definitely keeping this recipe.

I consider myself a pretty good cook and Baker. I do love baking and thought this would be a great recipe to make for my nurses and staff at my cancer clinic to thank them for taking such great care of me. I thought the cake tasted very bland. It seems to be missing something and I did add extra cocoa. I would not make again.  Disappointed.

I made it in a jelly roll pan, which makes a thin cake (like a sheet pan). (Note: The 10" x 15" pan in the recipe is a jelly roll pan.) Texas sheet cake is meant to be a quick cake you can make when company shows up, or you're going to a function.

I added cinnamon to the chocolate, as I always do to boost the chocolatey flavor. I also made it with brown sugar instead of table sugar. I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. I always use butter, no margarine.

Once I spread it out in the pan, I topped it with chocolate chips, then baked it.

While it was still cooling, I quickly made the frosting. I used 3 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 4. I spread it while the cake was still warm, which is important because it's thick frosting. And before the frosting set, I sprinkled toasted coconut and pecans over the top, pressing it in so the topping wouldn't fall off.

I'm very happy with the results.

This is almost just like my grandmas recipe, except: I use 1/2 cup buttermilk instead of sour cream, put 1 tsp cinnamon in cake mix, and I use Coca Cola instead of water, and a 9x13 pan is better than a jelly roll type pan. It’s so moist and delicious, and a family favorite for every holiday and get together.

This is a  very moist and delicious cake.  Very easy to make.  I used pecans (toasted) instead of walnuts,  also used a tablespoon of instant  espresso in both the batter and the frosting.   The raves are still coming in.

I followed other suggestions and added 7T of cocoa in both the icing and the cake, and that helped, but overall, this was ENTIRELY too sweet, it was sickly so. I will be cutting back on the sugar to 1 and 1/2 in the cake, and halving the icing and using even less sugar in that as well if I ever make this again. If you're serving to a big party, it's perfect because one person could each have one bite before they start feeling sick. I'm pretty disappointed.

This cake is phenomenally good.  So moist, and the frosting is very smooth and soft, kind of like Nutella.  It is not a super chocolate-y cake, which is nice.  I do recommend doing the step with the butter, water and cocoa powder first, so you can let that cool while you prepare everything else.  Other than that, I would not change a thing.

There are much better Texas sheet cake recipes out there. The cake was 'ok'. The icing is way off. The icing should pour over the cake and solidify. This icing was so thick (and I thinned it some) that it tore the cake when I tried to spread it. So the cake tasted mediocre and looks horrible. I'm glad I wasn't making it for an event. I'll go back to my old standby recipe.

It's ok and that's it. I have had a lot better Texas Sheet Cake than this. It lacks the unique flavor that makes it a Texas Sheet Cake. Super disappointed. The icing is very good, the cake is mediocre. It's just not a Texas Sheet Cake.

It was great.  I used a cookie sheet 10 x 15 and it was a little small.  The cake was higher than the edge and when I poured the warm frosting on I had quite the mess!   Boy boy did it taste good!  Was a huge hit in the office.

Texas Sheet Cake V, Great Recipe been a Texas Sheet Cake Connoisseur for 50 plus years this one was more like a moist browny. Replaced the Walnuts with a cup of Pecans and used 6 tsp. of  Cocoa powder in the frosting, it was good. This is good stuff just not my favorite TX Sheet Cake Recipe. Takes longer than recipe suggest but not by much. Will make this one again but use a smaller sheet cake pan.

I followed the directions exactly. This is so EASY to make. And I love that you don't have to wait for butter to soften.  This recipe calls for melted butter and uses ingrédients that you probably have at home. Best chocolaté cake ever!!!

This is the chocolate cake recipe I have been looking for! Decadent, rich, moist and delicious. The main problem with most chocolate cake recipes is the moisture, but this one retained it very well. I have celiac disease so I substituted with GF flour and DF yogurt and it turned out great. I will be making this again as my co workers want more!

I made it using Hershey's dark cocoa and it was delicious. Actually made 2--one to take to church dinner and one for us. I will definitely make it again. I also made more frosting because I like thick frosting. Delicious!!!

I just made this cake to take to a church function.  While the frosting is delicious, it is much too thick to spread on the warm cake, and I added the powdered sugar as soon as the cake cake out of the oven.  And I didn't use the full four cups!  I think the ratios are just a tad off...the frosting should be a little looser in order to spread over the warm cake without tearing the cake.  Next time (if the entire cake tastes better than my usual Texas Sheet Cake recipe), I would add another tablespoon of milk to the frosting.

I made the recipe as written (omitting the optional nuts, as I didn't have any).  It was very good and the cake was surprisingly moist and delicious (and I'm not a chocolate cake fan).  

I wasn't as impressed with the frosting, but will definitely try again.    Maybe I spread it while the cake was too warm, as much of the frosting melted and spread down to the bottom of the cake.  This would be fine, except I had put parchment paper on the bottom only, so the frosting went under the parchment and that's just a bummer!  

One thing I'd like to see is this recipe scaled down to fit a 9x13 pan.  I know many of the reviewers said they used a 9x13, but I think that'd throw off the cake:frosting ratio.  A good Texas sheet cake should be thinner than a traditional cake, with a generous layer of frosting, as this is written.

Delish, my sheet pan was actually 12x17. I used the conversion/servings chart under recipe as suggested by the first reviewer (47 servings). I was a bit nervous since the measure of ingredients seemed to increase by quite a bit (butter especially). Forged ahead and so glad I did, it turned out beautifully. I made this for a high school boys lacrosse team with hardly a crumb to show for it. I realize they'd eat almost anything but I can verify, it's good. It'll be a future go-to for sure. Note: if you DO use the conversion chart, keep that in mind when reading the recipe for it reads the same as if you're using the original amounts.

This cake was delicious! I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it, even a few days later (as each couple went home with a few extra pieces)! The recipe is great as is, I made no adjustments. I did heed the advice of other reviews and made sure I was working on the icing and had it ready as soon as the cake itself was done. Excellent cake, so glad I chose this one!

WARNING: If you struggle with self-control when it comes to not eating large amounts of chocolate, do NOT make this recipe unless you are having a very large party! Everything about this recipe is wonderful- the simplicity of making it, the smell of it cooking, the taste of it afterward...it will disappear from the pan, either by you or by your guests!

My entire family loved this. It's easy enough for even a novice baker like myself to make. I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and sifted everything- flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar. I didn't have the size cake pan the recipe called for, so I just used the standard size that I had on hand. I did increase the bake time to 35 minutes and the cake came out perfect. My husband loved the fact that it wasn't too sweet. I think this will be regularly requested dessert.

Made this sheet cake last week. The cake is a rich chocolate and very moist.  The icing is so gooy and delicious. I pre-cut the cake in 2" squares and put them in cupcake liners. Then  put 12 each of them in a box to share with friends and groups that I belong to.  I finished the last 2 last night as a snack with a glass of milk.  If you love chocolate, you will love this!

My Texas/Oklahoma grandmother made this cake for us all the time, but two things. First, it's a SHEATH cake that means same as jelly roll pan, 10 x 15 inch. Second, Nana's recipe called for buttermilk not sour cream. I understand that you may have to substitute but if you can use buttermilk. You can search online to find Texas Sheath Cake for the recipe with buttermilk. This cake has been around for decades! It is a chocolate lovers winner! Cut like brownies, great with vanilla ice cream.

The cake is very delicious, but the frosting is too way sweet.
I would decrease/half the confectionary sugar (like other brownies recipes).

Just made this! It came out perfect. Didn't add nuts as my hubby doesn't like them. I like this recipe because it's things I always have on hand. My other recipe for this cake calls for buttermilk instead of sour cream. I never have buttermilk! lol

Followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out perfect! When I added the cocoa powder mixture to the batter, it was really watery, added some flour and it was great! Also had to bake it 10 minutes longer (so a total of 30 minutes), but still very moist cake. definitely making this again!

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  Great cake and easy to make.  The only thing I changed was I added some pecan pieces to the frosting.  This reminds me of my favorite birthday cake when I was a kid.  Thanks so much for sharing!  :)

I have made this several times it is an excellent base recipe that lends well to ingredient changes. The way it is written is the exact cake I remember growing up and well balanced.  I have tried several variations when out of ingredients, I have used dramatically less sugar in the cake and been fine, yogurt and buttermilk to replace the sour cream with great results,  and coconut oil in place of butter for the frosting.  The only adjustment I make on a regular basis is I add cinnamon to both the cake and the icing.

This was a hit at a recent BBQ party so was really happy to have chosen this among the several similar cakes. I made it the day before and the only change was to replace the water with strong coffee. The frosting would have been tough to handle if I had not spread it immediately on the hot cake.  Next  time will toast the nuts.  There were about 10 cakes on the dessert table and this was by far the most popular.  The rich fudge-like topping kept the cake moist and fresh - the piece I saved was great the day after the party.  It was a really a simple cake to make - rich and chocolaty - though a bit different to heat ingredients before mixing.

Really good, but you must have a sweet tooth. It's almost exactly like the one my Grandma used to make. I really suggest sifting the powdered sugar because the frosting is hard enough to stir as it is. Work quickly! I added 2 more tablespoons of milk to thin out the frosting and immediately poured it over the still hot cake (5 min. from the oven). Out of curiosity I tasted the frosting after each addition of sugar. If I was making it for myself I'd have cut the sugar down to 1-1/2 cups because I like a more semi-sweet chocolate flavor. But I was making it for my mom's birthday so kept it just like the recipe. My mom (who is from Arkansas) loved it. Enjoy!

I substituted buttermilk for milk in the icing.  Then I had to call it "Hoosier Cake", sorry!    :)

Yum!!  I only added 1 of the 2 cups of sugar to the cake and thought it was sweet to my liking with the super sweet frosting. I doubled the cake and put it in a half sheet pan.  Baked for 30 minutes.  Did not double frosting and had plenty.

Wow, beautiful cake, super easy and super fast to make. I used a regular cake pan so next time I will use a sheet pan. I think it will work well for making more servings.

First, I made this 100% diet friendly making it low carb and sugar free.  I used a combination of CarbQuick flour, almond flour and flaxseed meal as the flour and Splenda combined with Sukrin Gold for sugar.  I did increase the chocolate based on other reviews by 2 tblsp and made the chocolate butter mixture first before anything else so it was cooled before using.  The cake itself is delicious although I have to come up with a different frosting.  I used Swerve confectioner's sugar which caused the cooling effect so either less Swerve or another type of sugar substitute with less Erythritol.  I did not frost the cake though and will use a cream cheese frosting I made prior. The 3 stars is because the instructions should be adjusted and definitely need to increase the chocolate. Otherwise this is very good.

I made this for a crowd and they loved it! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out exactly how I was hoping. One tip: Make sure you follow the heating instructions exactly for the frosting because it is a pain to spread when the mixture starts to cool. I will definitely come back to this recipe the next time an occasion calls for a Texas Sheet Cake.

I was a little skeptical at first-this recipe has so many high ratings, I didn't think it could really be that good. I was wrong. It IS that good! The only thing I'll do differently when I make it next time is either use a smaller pan or make 2 cakes and double decker them with frosting in between. I used an 11 x 15 pan and the cake seemed a little bit "thin." I highly recommend this recipe. My family and I loved it.

Delish and easy. I had to cook this at least 30-35 minutes though. I live above 6,000 feet so maybe that was the issue?

The 2nd time I made this I wanted a more chocolate tasting cake, so I added an extra half tablespoon of cocoa powder to the batter, and I reduced the powdered sugar for the icing by one cup. It still set properly and the chocolate flavor was really boosted. I found the original icing to be too sweet and fudge like. Definitely making this one again. And again...

Amazing. I used extra cocoa powder, coffee in place of water, and made the frosting while the cake was in the oven and kept the pan on the stove to keep it warm for a super easy spread. Great to share, and it is delicious right out of the fridge the next day.

We have made this cake dozens of times! It is always a hit.  We usually use pecans instead of walnuts. It is even good without any nuts at all.  If you like chocolate cake, you will love this. Super moist and delicious!

One of my faves! This is a thin rich cake. Recipe looks detailed but is easy to follow and a great "from scratch" piece. My family loves it! 
I like to use it for special occasions- use cookie cutters to cut shapes and add chocolate syrup on the top for a lil pizzaz.

Fantastic Recipe the only changes I di was I did not have 4 cups of confectioners sugar for the icing I only had one cup, so in moderation I added granulated sugar, add tablespoons at a time adjusted to your own taste. With a cup of milk, awesome!

I was worried about having to adjust the ingredients to fit my pan (16x11.5) coupled with the fact I've never made a sheet cake before ... but it worked wonderfully.  I used an adjusted serving size of 40, keeping my 1/2 cups loose...also used half coffee/half water mixture instead of plain water.  I thought I was prepared for the frosting having read it set up quickly, but man, I didn't realize just how quickly it set up and ended up with lumps of powdered sugar.  Will make sure to sift as others suggested next time.  Cake itself was perfect with 6T of cocoa powder ... moist and yet not too dense (I was worried about it being *too* brownie like).  In short, absolutely delicious and will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe and used a mini cupcake pan, made 30 minis, also used sour milk instead of buttermilk, used about 1 Tsp of icing on each mini. Cooked for 10 min. Really good mini bites!

Very easy and yummy. I split the butter with shortening in both the cake and the icing and it was very good. I wasnt paying attention and I added the butter/shortening and eggs to the flour mixture...oops...so I heated only the cocoa with the water but added about 3 tablespoons shortening to the heated mixture so it would be similar to the recipe. So I goofed up but it still came out excellent.

This is the easiest, most delicious chocolate cake recipe ever. I love that you could even make this with just a hand whisk, if that's all you've got. I made it in 2 8x8 pans, which made it the thickness of a regular sheet cake (Texas sheet cake is supposed to be a lot shorter) and baked it a little longer. I also toasted some chopped pecans and sprinkled them densely over the frosting I'd just poured on top, and pressed them in a bit so they stuck. I am horrified to admit that over a few days, I ate the entire cake by myself. It was THAT good. Will definitely be making this again very soon, and will insist that my husband help me finish it this time!

This was one of the blandest, most flavorless chocolate cakes I have ever tasted. Luckily I sampled. the batter and could tell that it needed much more cocoa. I ended up doubling the cocoa in both the cake and frosting, and it still only had a mild hint of chocolate flavor. I should note that I used quality cocoa, so it wasn't due to poor quality ingredients.

I make this in a 9x13 pan and bake for 26 minutes or so.  Super delicious and very moist cake.  I only use 3 cups of sugar in the frosting to cut the sweetness a bit.  This is a big hit!

UPDATE: I tried this in a jelly roll pan with the full amount of sugar in the frosting, baking the cake for 20 minutes.  It turned out just as good as the first time I made it.  I'm having it for a large family gathering and there'll be plenty of cake to go around.

I made this in a shallow 9x13, and I needed a deeper pan. I think it would be fine in a regular 9x13. My jelly roll pan was too big.

I did not read what to do with the cup of water. I made the cake before watching the video that explains to add the water to the butter and cocoa mixture. The cake still turned out fine.

This is now the go-to cake recipe for our family celebrations! Time the frosting to be done just a minute before the cake comes out of the oven, or it will be hard to spread. Enjoy!

I make this delicious cake many many times! For birthdays, church socials, game nights and everybody raves about it! Have been asked several times for the recipe and I gladly give it! I use all the same ingredients except that I use coffee in place of the water and I make it in a 9x13 inch pan! Superb!

This cake is really chocolatey and moist. I followed the recipe exactly. Only issue I had was my 10x15 pan seemed to be just a tad small-I had a frosting waterfall over the sides of the pan (nothing that was a huge problem; but I think a bit bigger pan would give the frosting more room to sit while it cools).  I will definitely make this again.

This is my go-to recipe for this cake with the following adjustments (and I should add that it is completely fine as it is).

A BIG modification that I highly recommend is adding cinnamon to the dry ingredients-- a full 2-3 tablespoons.  It makes the chocolate taste even better- you won't taste the cinnamon at all.  I had another recipe that I've made with cinnamon- I preferred the taste, but this cake has a much better texture.  This texture with the richer flavor is amazing.  

As for making it, and a few people mentioned the prep time is off, I melt/boil the butter/cocoa, etc FIRST.  It saves a few minutes.  By the time I mix the dry ingredients and the egg/sour cream (I usually use greek yogurt since we always have it on hand), the cocoa mixture has cooled enough to mix in.

I also agree about working FAST on the icing-- and make sure the cake is warm.  It creates this mid layer of yummy, melty chocolate goodness!

I sprinkle ground pecans, not walnuts, on half for the anti-nut crowd rather than mixing it in with the icing.  I find walnuts are too acidic and the pecans taste better with the chocolate.

Again, a great base recipe that I modified to give it a warmer, richer flavor.

ENJOY!

The cake itself was a cinch but the frosting, OMG!!!  I couldn't figure out what I did wrong.   It was WAY  too thick.  It was one big ball.  In fact, I made it twice.  The second time was a little better then the first so I followed what a previous reviewer had said and frosted the cake on the oven rack with the warm oven open.  It was a little scary, I thought I'd pull the cake apart.   But, as it warmed, it ended up spreading nicely.  It looks yummy.  We'll see what my party has to say tomorrow!

This cake & frosting combination was delicious and disappeared at my church's Lenten soup supper last night. But, everyone agreed it was the frosting that made the cake. I think the butter/chocolate/water mixture was hotter than specified (what does cool a little bit mean anyway), but using a very slow pour, from about 8 inches above the flour/sugar/egg mixture, the result was fine.  Will make this again.

Follow the recipe, and not the reviews! I made this in a smaller pan after reading reviews and it cooked up over the rim. The idea, as I recall from eating my Texas grandmother's some 40 years ago, it that there should be room in the pan to pour the frosting on, when the cake is still warm and the frosting will kind of melt over the cake in an even layer. The sides contain the frosting. Also, someone said the cake did not taste chocolately enough. I think it is supposed to be a mild chocolate cake enhanced with an intense frosting. I would not skip the nuts, unless you are allergic.

Eating this cake right now! I've been making sheet cake for a lot of years, and this is the third recipe I have tried. They were all good. The thing I like the most is that sheet cake is so easy and can't really be messed up. They always turn out good. And, they are always so moist! Plus, it uses ingredients that I usually always have in the kitchen! I wouldn't say this was the best sheet cake recipe, but it is definitely worth the effort! To the one who said the cake is too thin when using a baking sheet: That's why it is called a "sheet" cake!

This recipe was very easy to make, but it was saccharine sweet. Much too sweet for my tastes. If you've ever said a dessert wasn't "sweet enough," this is the recipe for you. On a technical note, you may wish to use the Wilton bake-even strips on the side of the sheet pan. Since you're pouring icing over a hot cake, if you have a large dome in the middle, some will get less frosting than others.

This is, hands down, the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten! The decadent chocolate frosting is to die for. It reminds me of hot fudge sauce. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! Thank you for sharing. :)

This was easy to make and so good! I used a 9X13" pan as I didn't have a clean jelly-roll pan so the cook time took a bit longer. The cake still turned out dense and moist and delicious! I used a different frosting so I can't comment on that, but I will try it the next time I make this cake!

I needed to find a dessert to present to 60 people. My husband is doing his first catering & asked me to bake something to help him out. I am an avid baker, but have never baked for that quantity. I did a trial run of this recipe & while the taste is ok, I am hard pressed to call this a "cake". I am now in the process of baking 2 half sheet pans of this for the actual catering. It is listed on the menu as a cake brownie. I will dress it up with a piping of whipped cream, with a slight dusting of cocoa powder & cinnamon. Wish me luck!!

The cake was good but i used only 2 cups of pwd sugar for the frosting and i still found it toooo sweet. I accidently waited for the cocoa -butter mixture to cool and then added the confectioners pwd sugar and it all clumped in little balls in the oocoa mix , i spread it like that on the cake, so maybe when i bit into a piece i was getting the little clumps of pwd sugar in the icing that made it was too sweet.

This is just a basic, super yummy, chocolate cake.  My friends always ask me to make it when we have get togethers. It isn't a fluffy cake, its on the dense side.

Very Good recipe. Easy, fast, and yummy. The only thing that I would change is the length of time cooked. I shortened it by about 5 mins. It may be my oven but it started to burn after 15 mins in the oven.

it was a very weird recipe, the icing was too hard in the saucepan and to put 4 cups of confectioners' sugar sounded like too much.
plus after mixing both pans for the cake it turned way too mushy for a cake..
if i was wrong and the recipe is good can someone help me out?

This recipe is awesome just the way it is.  No changes needed.  My oven required 2 extra minutes for baking.  I will definately be making this one for the next family gathering!
P.S.  My husband is very picky and he loved it!

I have had this recipe for years.  I use an 8 by 13 pan, not jeely roll.   One of the best cakes ever!  Try this with homemade ice cream.  Great for any crowd.

Amazing!!  Extremely moist and fluffy cake, excellent frosting, too.  Used 3 cups of conf. sugar b/c I ran out and it was just fine.  Added 1/2C pecan chips to frosting and poured over immediately.  Subbed COFFEE for water.  Great...this is a keeper.  If you don't have 10X15 pan, just buy the disposable kind for $2 like I did.  Worth it :)

This is so good! The only problem I had though was the jelly roll pan wasn't deep enough even though it was the right size, so the chocolate spilled over. I will have to see if I can find a deeper one or use something different.

Wonderfully delicious! One of my daughters is alergic to nuts so I didn't add them to the icing. Instead I toasted some pecan halves and put them on half of the cake. This was a huge hit with my family!

SPECTACULAR!  A+ Cake!  I received So Many Complements.  I increased my serving size to 47 for my 12x17x2-inch pan.  Highly recommend this recipe. Simply Delicious!
*Use Butter, NOT Margarine. Your results in both taste and consistency will be different.

Awesome, recieved many compliments! One even told me it was the best sheet cake she's ever had :) I did have to increase the bake time a bit but I just kept it in the oven till the toothpick came out clean. We paired it with Schwan's pepermint ice cream, delicious!

Very tasty.  Gets better with age.  Definitely plan to ice cake right away, while icing and cake are both warm.  I HIGHLY recommend using chopped pecans instead of walnuts.

I just made this tonight and yes, it does take a little more than 10 min. to prepare.  My husband was the review b/c my stomach was feeling yucky, so I passed on tasting it.  Being a picky person, my husband loved it.  I poked a few holes throughout the cake so the frosting would soak through.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow.

Fantastic! Altered slightly to accommodate an egg allergy. Doubled the sour cream to 1 cup, added 2Tbsp oil and followed recipe. I was careful not to overbake and it came out so moist and rich. I also added 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to the saucepan with the melted butter to make a richer chocolate taste. Usually chocolate cake is rather bland to me, this made the chocolate flavor intense! Highly recommend and are making again next week!

This cake is amazing. I have made it several times for everything from church functions to birthday partys for my kids. The only thing that I occasionally change is I will add chopped Pecans or Walnuts.

This is a great party cake.  I made it for a 4th of July BBQ yesterday (prepared it the day before, and covered with clingfilm and left in a cool room) and it went down a storm.  I did modify the recipe, I used buttermilk with a dash of cream and vinegar instead of soured cream.  I added extra cocoa to the cake (1heaped tb) and added 1tb extra cocoa to the frosting, plus a 1/2 tsp of salt, and a dash of rum and kalhua.  I omitted the nuts.  I also added a couple of squares of very dark chocolate to the frosting and I think this gave a better flavour and consistency.   The cake was deliciously moist, there were one or 2 moist crumbs clinging to the skewer when I tested it so I figured it would be fine.   It cuts really nicely and I think I will try doing it in a shallower, bigger pan next time to give neat little bars.    Great for kids!

This was almost exactly what I was going for. My aunt's used to make the best sheet cake for family reunions and this is very close. The icing could have been a little more chocolaty...it was missing something. I did forget to add the vanilla, so maybe that's all, but I'm not sure. I will probably use this next time I'm craving a sheet cake.

This cake was great! I saw the recipe and was craving chocolate cake the rest of the day. I was going to call my mom and get my great grandmother's sheet cake recipe, because it is the best. But, I decided to try this instead. I was pleasantly surprised!  It was not the same recipe, but was just as great. I will for sure make it again and again!

Okay, but a little more labor intensive than other recipes I've tried.  I think using buttermilk makes the batter smoother.  Using the sour cream left lumps of flour in this batter.  I recommend using the buttermilk, since a liquid is easier to stir in.  Sour cream made the batter more like a dough.  However, this cake was still moist and had a good flavor.

I've made this twice and it is truly awesome.  I used the 10X 15 jelly-roll pan.  I cut the frosting recipe in half because I didn't have that much powdered sugar on hand, and that was a good idea.  The thinner layer of frosting was just fine.

OMG! Wonderful!  However, strangely I was out of sour cream and resorted to AllRecipes substitution list and read that yogurt could be replaced for sour cream. That is what I did and it was still a HUGE hit with my family. They loved this cake. Will make this regularly now.

I bake a lot, but I've never baked a sheet cake so I decided to give this one a try.  It is EXCELLENT.  I didn't make the frosting included in the recipe, however.  Instead, I purchased a small container of Milk Choclate Frosting then melted about 3/4 c. peanut butter and mixed the two together.  It was the perfect amount of frosting and the cake was delicious.  Even 3 days later it was as moist and delicious as can be!

Was a little suspicious about the wetness of batter when putting in the oven but this cake worked perfectly.  Served warm with vanilla icecream it had much praise in our household. This sheet cake is worth it's hi rating for taste, texture and ease.

always a hit; it is minorly labor intensive, but sooo much better than a cake mix! Also, I watched it at around 15 minutes; it was done. I also used dark chocolate cocoa -- we are calling it Texas Tea (oil, get it?) cake.

Delicious Cake!!  VERY CLOSE to my grandma's, dare I say, maybe even better.  I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted buttermilk.  It got rave reviews from all my co-workers.  I agree you have to spread the icing as soon as the cake comes out of the oven.

These were incredible! I added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter for more depth of flavor and used Dutch-processed cocoa. Wonderful! Even though I forgot to bring the butter and cocoa to a boil before adding to the flour they still turned out beautifully. And don't forget to keep scraping down the bowl - it's incredibly thick.

Definately a cake you want to make and give away so you don't eat the whole thing! I've always had trouble with the frosting on this type of cake, but this one turned out perfect!  I didn't add the nuts, but the cake and frosting are so sweet I can see how they would add a nice balance.  I liked the suggestion of sprinkling them on half at the end so people can choose.

I used a tablespoon more of cocoa in each the cake and the icing to add more chocolate.  I needed to leave it in the oven a little longer, but it was a hit of the football party.

This was my first time making a Texas Sheet Cake. I followed the recipe to a "T". I gave it just 3 stars because it was a bit crumbly and, in my opinion, the frosting was way too sweet. But otherwise the overall flavor was good. Some reviewers said that this was an easy recipe to make, but I found it to be complicated, what with having to boil ingredients (2 seperate times)and having to work quickly with the frosting. My family liked it, but I just thought it was O.K.  Then again, I'm not a Texas Sheet Cake connoisseur. I've decided that I prefer a dark chocolate layer cake or chewy brownies. But thanks for a nice recipe, anyways.

My hubby loves this cake!  He was wanting chocolate and I was wanting to bake...and had everything to make this one, so I thought "What the heck?"  I had no problems with the frosting.  Maybe the weather affects it or something?  Also, we have some who like nuts and some who don't, so instead of putting the walnuts in the frosting, I sprinkled them on half of the cake after frosting.  We liked this cake so much...I will definitely be making it regularly!

Awesome! I doubled this & made it for a rib cook-off. This garnered more first place votes than any of the ribs. Definite winner. I'll make this again and again.

WOW!! This is the best.  I have made it a couple of times now and my husband just asked me to make it again! I added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour mix like someone suggested.  When I added the sour cream and eggs to the flour, I mixed it thoroughly to make a wet mix. Then when I added the warm cocoa mix, I just kept mixing until it was well blended.  It has turned out perfect!  My co-workers said to bring it to every pot luck lunch we have!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

A good choice to take to a potluck as it serves a ton!  I used a jelly roll pan as others have suggested and the amount of frosting is perfect.  Don't forget to adjust cooking time accordingly if you use the bigger pan.

This cake was soooo good -- my whole family loved it! I absolutely loved the frosting and plan on using it on other cakes. I halved the recipe and put it in an 8x8 baking dish and found that it had to bake 15 minutes longer than the directed 20 minutes. The only change I made was to omit the walnuts from the frosting. Will make again.

This cake was really moist and flavourful.  Probably needs somewhere close to 30-40 mins rather than the suggested time of 20 mins.  I tweeked the icing recipe a bit by using less cocoa and adding bakers chocolate squares...turned out great!

Made this cake and frosting for my mom's birthday and thought it was just ok or average.  I like the recipe for buttercream frosting on this website much better.  Thank you.  I would make again, but in no rush to do so.

The icing however was VERY good.  I may use that in the future but the cake? Not so much.

Excellent cake! I did add about a teaspoon or so of vanilla to cake batter and also about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (or a little more depending on taste) to the cake batter.

This cake is amazing!!! A coworker made this once at work years ago and I found it here! I made for a dinner party and everyone just raved about it!! The only change I made was using pecans instead of walnuts because my husband loves pecans!!  This will be something I make all of the time.

This was just what I was looking for.  I didn't have a large baking sheet so I just used a 9x13 and increased the baking time a bit.  Turned out thick, of course, but great!

Great I loved it.  Was still good the next day, my 4 year old who is very picky when it comes to a snack loved it too.  Great, Thanks for sharing.

This cake wasn't the easiest to make, even though I used pre-made frosting. It took a pretty long time to make, and after the cake was baked there were little white lumps. I don't know if the lumps were because of me or the recipe though...

This cake is extremely rich!  Too rich really for us.  I guess I should have known when it called for more than 1/2 pound of butter!  Anyway, we prefer our old recipe for chocolate sheet cake that calls for buttermilk.  Lots less fat too!!

Super recipe! I agree with all--just like I remember and ingredients readily on hand. I used chopped almonds in the frosting. Yum!

Everyone raves about this dessert. The prep time says 10 minutes which is not true. It takes around 45-60 minutes unless you are Rachel Ray and have everything all set out and measured before you even start.

I used this recipe because I am visiting my mother for the 4th of July and I always make dessert, and I left my sheetcake recipe at home.  This was OK--I like the recipe I use better.  There was just something missing in the flavor for me.  Plus, I think its better with pecans than walnuts.

Followed the recipe except I left out the nuts.  VERY GOOD!  Even my anti-chocolate husband liked it, and my 2.5 year old couldn't get enough.

This si the best cake I have ever made.  I have been searching for this exact taste for years but never found it until now.  I will continue to use this recipe.  It deserves 5 stars.  I did have to add a little extra cooking time though.  But this is just SUPERB!!!!

I brought this to a church group and it was the best desert there.  It is delicious.  The batter looked a little thin, so expect that.  I changed the nuts to pecans, because we like them.  I will be making this many more times.  Martha

Absolutely fantastic--can't say enough good things about it--I made this twice in a week for two different events.  Everyone loved it.  Including me.  A little too much.

This cake is delicious.  I don't normally like cake but this one is fabulous.  I made it quite a few times.  It gets requested often.  If I don't have sour cream available I have used applesauce in it's place and it tastes just as good.

My kids (and everyone at the office) absolutely love this cake. Easy and homemade -- the frosting is perfect!
