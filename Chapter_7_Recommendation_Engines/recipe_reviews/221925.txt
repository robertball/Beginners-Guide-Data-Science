Be sure you have plenty of time to assemble these little guys...also, I strongly suggest you make them right before serving b/c they don't hold up well over time.  I made them several hours ahead and the water from the cukes drained onto the platter, leaving them somewhat "limp."  Very tasty with the addition of smoked salmon and sesame seeds.

I found this to be very fun to make. And It tastes surprisingly well! I'm not a fan of cucumbers or carrots, but this is definitely something I could eat!


I made this as the directions listed, but I have a few suggestions. Sometimes I used less cream cheese so that when I rolled the cucumber, the end could overlap and I didn't have to worry about anything spilling out. I also added more raisins, since 2-3 didn't really seem like a lot.
I didn't have any large carrots on me, so I shredded 1/2 cup of baby carrots (24 servings = 24 tsp = 8 TBS = 1/2 c).


As for chives breaking, buy fresh as possible and as green as possible. I suppose not too many people made jewelery out of grass as kids, but don't pull the chives too tight or they will break. Also, do not use any wimpy/weak/shriveled chives as those tend to break the most when tugged.


Since you are making each roll by hand, it is a lot of work and time consuming. I also suggest placing finished rolls onto whatever you plan to serve them on, to prevent the chives from untying between finishing and eating.

These taste OK - but boy are they fiddly to make.  My chives were quite long enough and kept breaking so I resorted to thin strips of green onion and finally gave up trying to tie them.  Cute idea but a lot of work.

First, I sliced the cukes with a mandolin and sprinkled salt over them. I let them sit for 30 minutes in a colander and this drastically reduces the amount of water that seeps out while they sit in your fridge, waiting to be served. Just make sure you sprinkle them with salt and don't use too much! You can also use this technique with eggplant and zucchini. I also crushed peanuts and mixed them in with the cream cheese and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Turned out cute and they taste great! The whole process took about 2 hours.
