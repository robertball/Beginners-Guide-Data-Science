I used 2 big green apples.  Used dried cranberries for currents and vanilla brandy
  Canned in the same way I do jams and jellies.
  After 2 weeks, I made the whole batch into a  pie using a deep dish 10 inch pie plate.  Everyone that said they liked mincemeat pie in general loved it.  I got requests to make it again and again.

Just not for us. I used the best ingredients, so it wasn't that. It's an acquired taste. I  was disappointed.
