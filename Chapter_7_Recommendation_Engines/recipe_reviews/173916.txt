I made this with frozen sweet potatoes that I had frozen from our garden and we loved it. Even my 14 year old son loved it. We made chicken as a side to the soup and it paired perfectly with it. It was very filling and the cumin was the perfect touch! My son asked me to sprinkle green onion on top next time and we will. One of our favorite soups!
