It is getting hot in here!  I absolutely loved this recipe.  The bread was moist and delicious, but full of flavour.

This is the type of bread that you can respect - it definitely bites back.

My only complaint: the vanilla is listed under ingredients but is not actually included in the recipe.  If you are a buy-the-book cook like me, don not forget to add that vanilla baby!

This is a nice bread. I only had one jalapeno so I added a habanero pepper. Thank you for the recipe.
