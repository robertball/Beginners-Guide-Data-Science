Oddly enough, it was another Catherine who gave me this recipe more than 30 years ago...she called it "Chop Suey Cake," she guessed because it's so speedy, she said. The recipe is not misprinted--there is no oil or fat in the cake, so do not feel compelled to add it. For those who insist a cake requires fat, think of angel food cakes! This is a delicious cake, very moist, full of pineapple flavor. "My" Catherine's recipe also included a cup of chopped nuts. Thanks, Catherine, for posting this bit of nostalgia.

This cake was AWESOME. Incredibly moist and great flavor. A previous review stated a cake needs oil, which I agree, so I added 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and it turned out great. I reserved a small portion of the crushed pineapples and added it to the frosting along with coconut flakes. Everything was perfect. My family and Fiance loved it. I will make this cake again...

This cake is super-yummy and DOESN'T need oil or butter! It has a great chewy & moist texture and there is plenty of fat in the frosting! I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 of a cup and they did not seem too sweet - just right. These are just like they say...very easy & fast to make -tasted a little like my carrot cake recipe. I sprinkled 1/2 cup chopped pecans on top of the frosting also. Thanks! UPDATE: Do keep this in the fridge if it is not eaten right away. It tastes yummy cold too!

This could be a five with a few changes.  I added 1/2 cup butter and cut the sugar in half and this cake turned out amazing.  You need to have some sort of oil or fat in your cake otherwise it will turn out rubbery and the sugar will burn.  I mixed the sugar with the butter and then added the egg and vanilla.  I mixed the flour and the baking soda in a separate bowl and added a pinch of salt before adding the butter/egg/sugar mixture to it.  I also only cooked it a half hour.  

For the icing i doubled the cream cheese and added 8 oz of crushed pineapple including juice and 1/3 cup shredded coconut.  It turned out great!

This cake is fabulous!!! I can't comment on the cream cheese frosting, as I made my own, but the cake turned out wonderful. All I had was a can of sliced pineapple rings, so I crushed them by hand and drained enough juice so it was the consistancy of a can of crushed. The cake doesn't rise as much as other cakes but it looks and tastes fine, and as for those who said it was hard you must have overcooked it - this recipe yielded a very nice, moist cake that would be fine even without frosting. Thanks!

Fantastic! I used unbleached flour, 20 oz can crushed pineapple w/ juice, and for good measure a stick of mealted butter. It is wonderful. I think the trick is to measure carefully & be sure to use unbleached or all purpose flour. Also watch your oven--my cake was done in 30 minutes.  I'll be making this cake often!

Wonderful! I didn't have crushed pineapples but rings instead.. so I crushed those up myself. I reserved about 1/4 cup of the juice, which I originally planned to add to the frosting but found that the frosting was perfect as is. Instead I brushed it over my cake with a pastry brush after baking. I found that my cake was done sooner than the recipe stated... I took it out as soon as it turned a dark brownish color on top, which scared me at first as I thought it had burned a bit but it was perfect! The cream cheese frosting & texture of the cake reminded us a lot of carrot cake. It was absolutely fabulous & will definitely make this one again!

My mom always made this cake when I was a child.  I didn't appreciate it until I grew a little older, because I hated nuts and cream cheese back then.  This is pretty much the same recipe as she used (for the cake part, not the frosting), except she added one more teaspoon of vanilla & 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.  For this cake to be really moist, the secret is using canned crushed pineapple in heavy syrup.  That probably sounds like sugar overload, but trust me you won't be disappointed (especially if you have just a small piece -- everything in moderation, right?).  The syrup in the pineapple makes this cake dense and delicious.  She used a totally different cream cheese frosting than the one printed.  Your favorite recipe will do.  My 5 star rating is for the memories I had of my mother making this wonderful cake!

VERY easy recipe to follow and make. This would be a good one for the kids to make with mom or dad. 
Two things I would suggest. Depending on your oven start watching the cake at about 30 minutes of baking. Mine was pretty golden on the top but when I inserted a tooth pic it was raw in the middle. I popped it back in for another 10 minutes and it was VERY golden but cooked in the middle. So don't be afraid to keep it in a little longer. 
The other thing is if you plan to frost it the recipe for the frosting does not make that much. So if you like a nice layer of frosting I'd say double it. I used cream cheese, confectioners sugar and coconut flakes and it came out fabulous. You could also try cream cheese, marshmellow fluff and some crushed pinapple as a frosting too. Both are great! 
Oh and I also used 1 and 1/2 cups of white sugar rather than the 2 cups the recipe called for.

Overall....This ones a keeper for sure!

Cake does not bake properly. Does not rise like a regular cake. Stays sticky and glue like. Has an unbaked texture and taste. Frosting is excellent and can be used as a filling as well as a frosting.

What an easy cake to make! I used 1.5 cups of sugar instead of two.
Next time I will add some almonds and I lower the oven temperature. I was worried the cake would burn.

Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe! We are in Alaska in the winter and good produce is scarce, so when a shipment of pineapples came in to the market I have been using as many recipes as I can find, this is the best! I decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup, added a tablespoon of oil, added 1/4 cup of flour with my very ripe and mushy pineapple and a 1/4 cup of almonds. Very yummy but one question.. how on earth is this suppose to serve 24? :)

This cake is delicious as is....no additional fat is needed as others have decided to add.  It's very moist and has plenty of pineapple flavor.  Mine only took about 30 mins. to cook and I opted to wait until it cooled to frost.

^_^ so I added 1/4 cup oil, kept the sugar the same, and cooked the cake in a bigger container, and even though I cooked it about 20 extra minutes, it still turned out delicious and chewy--it's even better than the top on banana bread! It's delicious, and I don't think it's too sweet, personally, but there's no frosting.. Fantastic cake; it's for my boyfriend's birthday, and I'm so glad I picked the pineapple cake. Good luck, and you can't go wrong with this one!

really good.. I was skeptical about using the frosting but it was good.. I just used my own cream cheese frosting recipe though and made it a little less thick and sweet than I usually would.  Cake needs a little cinnamon I think but definitely a keeper.

This cake does have good flavor and if I make again I will add 1/4 c. melted butter. It reminds me of a pineapple upside down cake because of it's stickiness. Even though I had sprayed my pans well the cake stuck and made it so I could not give some of it away as I had planned. I made my in 2  8" rounds with plans of sharing one. The icing is good and over all this is something simple to make.

The taste is fabulous.  The texture is different from most cakes, sort of rubbery.  I didn't take it to a potluck as I'd planned because I was concerned about the texture.  My family (three, including me) ate half of it last night.  Very easy to make.  Frosting is extremely sweet.  May try it with rum extract and a glaze or a light coconut frosting.

Pretty good! I didn't make the frosting...instead I made a glaze out of 3/4 cup of powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a tbsp of skim milk. Spread the glaze on the warm cake and sprinkled 1/3 cup of shredded coconut on top of the glaze. Next time I'll use whole wheat flour, just wasn't sure if it'd be too dense, seems that it'd be fine though.

This recipe has no oil in it, which is the reason for the "tough, chewy, bar-like texture" and the no-rise problems that the other reviewers talk about. A cake usually needs some fat (more than what's just in the eggs) to provide moisture, flavor, and stability to the cake structure. Fat is an essential part of any cake. I wonder if the author simply forgot to add the oil to the recipe?

This cake was delicious!!! Turned out very moist and delicious. After reading other reviews I was worried about it being too sweet so I reduced the sugar as others did to 250g. For extra flavour I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and I really liked the extra flavour. Did not need the full cooking time as my cake was finished and golden brown on top after only 35 minutes. For the icing, the next time I make this I will probably look for another recipe for cream cheese icing. I don't know if I did something wrong as I followed the recipe but my icing was quite runny and I had to keep adding more icing sugar which then made it soooo soo sweet. All in all will definitely make this cake again.

I had this recipe since 1982. Hadn't made it in years, but I do remember how incredible it was. So I made it again yesterday same recipe as the one here..but it was flat and tasted like flour and wasn't the dark brown color I remember. I just cdon't understand. Going to try again today.

Thanks so much for this recipe, Catherine!
I live in Guatemala and sell cakes on the weekend and people just LOVE this cake!
It is so very easy and wonderful because we have fresh pineapple all year round. I never used canned pineapple, just cut the fruit in trunks crush them in a food processor.
In time I did made some minor changes, like reducing the sugar and adding more flour and a little bit of oil.
People don't seem to mind the consistency, my personal taste though prefers it less gooey (adding some oil and more flour will achieve that).
I also use less sugar in the icing, it is way too sweet in my opinion.
Great tasting cake!!

This recipe was in my mom's church cookbook from 25-30 years ago.  I've made it many times, exactly as is and it is great!  It is the favorite of our foreign exchange student from Colombia and it's my favorite to take to potlucks, always gets rave reviews!

Good and easy but not special. The frosting was the best part. I did cut the butter in the frosting down to 1/4 cup and that was fine.  My husband said, and I agree, we couldn't taste the pineapple. I used pineapple packed in juice and it was very moist. It also baked much quicker.  I checked after 35 minutes and it was already quite brown. It might have been ready after 30 minutes.

I liked this recipe, but it needs a little work.  It's done in about 30 minutes or a little after when the top quickly turns a dark golden brown.  Next time I might cut back the sugar to taste the pineapple a little more.  My biggest complaint is that my cake didn't turn out as fluffy as I liked.  I'm not sure why that happened.  Maybe that's because baking soda is used instead of a double acting baking powder or because of the type of flour that is used.  But there is acid in the pineapple juice to activate the baking soda.  It may or may not need the butter.  Mine was moist but a little rubbery.  So I think I'll try the suggestion of 1 stick of butter next time.  I also think the addition of some chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans could help the cake if it is going to be a heavy cake instead of a light fluffy one.  

As for the frosting, it turned out great.  However, it is more like what I'd pair with carrot cake and probably not this one.  It is very creamy without that sugar taste of buttercream frosting.  If you like a creamy frosting try adding dried coconut and an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple.  I'd drain the pineapple good otherwise your frosting will likely end up soupy.

This was a delicious cake and went down a treat. Based on review suggestions and personal preferences I made a few changes. I added about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, about two tablespoons of coconut and (because I was a bit nervous about the consistency after adding additional ingredients) about 1/4 cup of oil. I also made a dairy free icing with walnuts, coconut and almond slivers. It was fabulous!

Loved this cake and the frosting recipe was a good kick-off point. I made the cake recipe as written but used two 8-in round pans. At 30 mins they seemed a little bit overcooked but I added extra pineapple juice over each layer to kick it up a notch. Then for the frosting I added an extra half cup of powdered sugar, and took  out the vanilla extract and added pineapple juice to taste and coconut flakes. My mom loved it for Mother's Day! Definitely will be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)

It was a pretty good cake. A little bit too much sugar and the frosting was a little clumpy. Next time I am going to use a little less sugar. Over all it was a very good recipe and I will Def. try it again.

Delicious cake considering how easy it is to put together.I only used one cup of sugar and it was sweet enough for us.It was ready in about 25 minutes in my oven.I think this is a very versatile recipe in terms of what you can add to it(nuts,coconut,etc.) or how you can present it.This is going to be my go-to recipe when pressed for time.Thank you!

Delicious! This cake was so good! It's really unlike a typical cake because it's a fruitcake. They tend to be a bit heavier than traditional cakes which is what I am used to. This one was a hit! I split the recipe in half and used a 9x9 square pan. I wish I had used the 9x13 and full recipe though. Very good and the frosting was great. Thank you.

This is so delicious. I baked mine only 35 minutes and it was done. I used only 1 1/2 cups sugar and it was sweet enough. This was so good, I can't stop eating it.

This couldn't be any easier!  The only changes I made was to decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the batter.  No one was excited when I said I was going to make a pineapple cake but when they tasted it, it got rave reviews and everyone had seconds.  I love that there is no fat in the mix, now I have to find a fat free frosting!

I thought this was FANTASTIC! i dont like normal cake but i loved this! i made this with only 1 cup of sugar and the sweetness was perfect with the frosting. Just make sure the cake is COMPLETELY cooled before putting the frosting on. It will melt into liquid form :) still tastes good just doens't look as pretty. Very good taste! will definatly make again!

My all-time favorite cake :)  I have to have it every year on my birthday and in fact my husband (NOT a baker!) has even earned how to make it for me.  I suppose the reason why some do not like it is because it is not your typical cake.  It's VERY moist and the bits of pineapple in it make it a different texture to most cakes.  That's just why it's my favorite though!

Sorry, we did not like this cake and ended up throwing most of it out.  As others said, it was more like a bar cake and really lacked something.  Another reviewer suggested adding oil, so maybe that's it.

I've been making this cake since I was a girl.  Everyone always loves it!  It's so moist and chewy.  The cream cheese icing is what makes it "killer".  Beat together 1/2 cup softened butter, 8 ounces softened cream cheese, 1 1/2 cup 10x sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Spread over cooled cake and watch it fly outta the pan!

this has been one of my favorites for almost my entire life.  To add a little something else to the frosting, reserve 1/4 C. of pineapple (draining as much juice as possible into the cake) and mix in before you frost.  This cake never lasts around my house!

I was going to post this recipe myself. It's one of my favorite cakes to make. It literally takes minutes to throw together the ingredients. I use 15 oz of pineapple, though. I also don't add the vanilla extract to the cake itself. It's up to you. Maybe the cake wouldn't be flat if you cut the pineapple amount to 15 oz? I have never used a full 20 oz can. I also use 1 cup of powdered sugar for my icing. Again, it's up to you. It's a dense cake that goes great in the winter months with a cup of coffee.

I did make a change to it I added 1 stick of butter, two teaspoon of vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon salt and about 2 teaspoons cinnamon and I will make it again. Gave some to a few of my friends and they love it and I will be making it again. I put it in a greased and floured 10 x 15 x 2 inch pan and I did baked it for 45  min. 325* oven

Great recipe. But a little to dry.! I used a extra 1/4 cup of pineapple juice for the batter. Also for the frosting 6 ounces of crushed pineapples without liquid and the rest of the ingredients for it!

I made this 40 years ago. We simply called it Pineapple cake with Cream cheese frosting. I used to have the recipe memorized because it was so easy. Almost all ingredients  was 2. This is my youngest sons favorite cake and I found the recipe  here after an Internet search  because he wants it made for his 38th birthday today. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.

Absolutely delicious! It was very quick and easy to make. I cannot believe a cake can be this moist and heavy without any added fat, but it really is. I followed the recipe to the word. I used a greased bundt pan and had to bake the cake for the full 45 minutes. This is now a go-to favourite of ours.

This was a very easy cake but shockingly too sweet even for the cake lovers. My daughter was bouncing off the walls. Definately not something I will make again.

I make this all the time and have passed the recipe on again and again.  I tend to make low fat/low calorie substitions, but be careful doing that with the frosting - you must use either full fat butter or cream cheese for the right consistency. Love this recipe!

This cake is DELICIOUS!  I made it for my baby's 1st birthday and my husband and my other kids LOVED it.  I added a dollop of veg oil and only used 1 3/4c of sugar as suggested.  It tastes good with or without the sweetened coconut I added.

DELICIOUS!!! although i did change a few things it was absolutely perfect!i put in about half the sugar and it was still VERY sweet!i used whole wheat flower, too.i kept it in there for the right time and when i took it out it wasn't quite done but i think it was WAY better that way and so did my family! it was nice and moist and so sweet (and kinda mushy..but it was better that way!) i didn't have any cream cheese so i just glazed cool whip over it and it was so delightful and light at the same time! definately will make it again!!! :)

This cake really lacked any pineapple taste AT ALL. Very chewy texture also,maybe a stick of butter would have helped. My cake came out very dark and very sweet. Its very rare that think of anything being to sweet,this is one of those rare occasions. I followed the recipe exactly. the icing is the only thing that made me not throw it out,plus the kids & husband liked it ok.
I want to try this again with a few adjustments>BUTTER >PINEAPPLE FLAVORING>LESS SUGAR.
IT WAS SO EASY TO MAKE, I WAS REALLY HOPING IT CAME OUT BETTER,

This cake is really good for having no oil or butter.  I put whole wheat pastry flour, half the sugar and topped it with the almond filling custard recipe on this site and some toasted slivered almonds for a delicious and actually good-for-you treat.

Delicious!  Others are right in saying that it's very moist and even 'gooey', but that's what I LIKE in a cake!  It took only a couple of minutes to prepare.
I also just made my own simple white icing instead of the cream cheese stuff (as I find that cream cheese costs an arm and a leg) and it was awesome.

I can literally eat the whole cake in the matter of a couple of days.  If you want to cut back on cholesterol, just use egg whites (I used 3) instead of the 2 eggs.  Fantastic cake...

It may be quick and easy, but not very good.  Everyone found it to be a rather tough chewey texture.  The icing and the moistness were the only things that saved it.  I won't make it again.

Yum!  This cake is delicious!  I had not intended to make a cake tonight.  Fortunately I accidentally opened a can of crushed pineapple (instead of chunk pineapple) for another recipe.  OF COURSE I had  to use up the crushed pineapple.  Mistakes sometimes have great  consequences.

I did as the recipe except I cut sugar to 3/4 cup and that I waited till the cake was cold to add the frosting. Since I had a bit of pineapple left over, I boiled with a bit of 1/4 c sugar and made a kind of jam that I put in the middle of the frosting and added fresh mint leaves that I had in the garden to decorate.....I love the mint taste with the cream cheese frosting...... Love this cake and sooooo easy to do. (Because I had only a 14 ounce can of pineapple I did 1/2 the recipe so 10 ounces went in recipe and 4 ounces for the jam.)

I will make it again. I used pineapple rings that I chopped up. Used Splenda instead of sugar. Added chopped pineapple to the frosting. Using a stand mixer with whisk attachment made  the frosting into an almost whipped like topping.

It tasted great! Cake was darker than I expected, I cut back a little on the vanilla in the frosting since I used real vanilla. Also at first I used defrosted cream cheese without whipping it first. If you are using defrosted bars, smooth it out first with a teaspoon of milk.  My first try making a cake.

Very dense and little pineapple flavour. The only thing we liked was the cream cheese frosting....which would have been much tastier on some carrot cake.

The cake doesnt rise, and is just a gooey mess after baking... perhaps they meant baking POWDER? instead of baking soda?//.

Love it! Hubby said it was a keeper and it was so easy to make it! It was very moist and delicious. I didn't change a thing except bake it in a bundt pan an I did add a 1/4 C of chopped walnuts at the suggestion of another reviewer. For those who have concerns there is no use of oil or fat walnuts have plenty of naturally occurring fat in them.  I can't comment on the icing because instead I just kept it simple an opted for a dollop of homemade whipped cream. All in all for little to no effort it was delish.

I am not much of a baker, unless you count box cake and brownie mixes. So, my sisters and my mother were surprised that I had made something from ‘scratch’. They were even more surprised that it was so very good! So was I, to be honest. Lol. We loved it! Everyone had seconds and since there were just the four of us, they had some to take home, too.

Thank you, Catherine, for a delicious recipe that even a novice baker can make.

Super easy. Used some canned peaches as I didn’t have quite enough pineapple. Hubby loved it. The only thing I might do next time is add a bit of salt  to suit my tastebuds. Baked 33 min.

My husband won first place with this recipe at the men’s cake bake-off at our church.  I call it ‘Hawaiian Delight Cake” cuz it reminds me of the Hawaiian Delight baby dessert Gerber used to make! ??
It’s so moist and gooey and delish!
(I once added roasted, chopped pecans to the cake batter...that was really good too!)

Very easy, I made in one 10” pan, so I had to double time of baking.... it is very dense and moist! I did like the flavor... I just used whipped cream as frosting; I bought the Walmart brand crushed pineapple, I thing that adds to the falling apart problem, it’s too chunky; the Aldi brand of crushed pineapple is better, definitely smaller pieces!!

Added a 1/4 cup of oil & cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and it came out moist & golden.  I also added a pinch of salt because I dislike overly sweet cakes!  I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I just put a 20oz. of pineapple rings in juice in the blender & that worked out perfectly fine.  I just think that it doesn't have enough pineapple flavor for me & maybe it was the blended pineapple?  I will add  a tsp of pineapple extract next time because I have it & ensure I put pineapple in the filling or buttercream.  By the way, I made cupcakes & it took 19.5 minutes at 350 degrees.

Delicious, moist, one change I made is that I used coconut oil instead of butter for the frosting, making a taste sensation of pineapple and coconut.

It was very good considering how very quick and easy it was to make.  I found it a bit chewy and wish I had waited for it to cool before adding the icing. The recipe says to ice it while it is still warm, but I made two layers and the middle layer of icing completely melted. I recommend waiting for it to cool.

Whoever said this recipe needed oil was right. The cake turned out dense and rubbery. I made it for my son's birthday, luckily he's only one and will never remember how horrible it was.

Without butter or oil this cake is sticky and had a strange texture  I would rather cut down on the sugar and add some fat then this would be  much better and tastier.. the precious pineapple cake on this site makes a better cake  although it does use a cake mix   they all can be baked in a 9 x13 pan and served with a sprinkling of powdered sugar if desired

mmm, lovely, moist pineapple cake with others' recommended changes. I added slightly more than 1/4 cup  oil and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. it was mildly sweet to my liking. i'm impressed that a light, moist cake can use so little fat. i'll be happy to add this recipe to my favorites.

Too sweet, even though I used only 1 3/4 cups of sugar. Good flavor, just really sweet. Also, I am going to reduce the cook time some, as leaving it in for a full 45 min leaves the top and sides an unappealing brown color, that cracks when cut, making it hard to have neat pieces.

Made this and served it topped with unsweetened  whipped cream. It was very moist with a wonderful pineapple taste.  It is very easy to throw together too. Thanks.

Easy to make!  I reduced sugar (1 1/2 only) and baked on cupcakes for 25 minutes. Crunchy on top and moist inside.

I had an almost full can of crushed pineapple I wanted to use up and am so glad I found this recipe.  As others have said, it is incredibly moist. Really really moist! I agree it doesn't need any oil, and it is a little too sweet so next time I'll cut down on sugar. I plan to modify this to make a spice cake, with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, etc. I made it in a 9x9 pan and baked for the full time. I opted to ice the top slightly (the recipe makes a lot of icing!), flip it so top was on bottom, then fully ice the top when it was cooled down. That bite from the bottom was crispy and delicious!!!

I made this today - the only fruit I had on hand was a can of crushed pineapple. 

I made it as published but with half the sugar.  I didn't even frost it and it turned out great!  Nice golden brown color and very moist.

I didn't see a pan size mentioned and used a 9" square pan.

I love this cake! It is so easy and has a great chewy texture without a lot of fat in the cake itself. My mother has made a version of this since I was a kid and I was very happy to find this similar recipe online.

 I much prefer this without the vanilla extract. The pineapple flavour is enough on its own and I think the fruit flavour is lost when vanilla is added.

It didn't tell me to bake it in a Pyrex dish or a metal cake pan. Do I flour it or just spray it or not do either?
So after I baked the cake it looked black on top. I guess that's the pineapple   Not sure how this is going to turn out but wish me luck   Oh also I used REAL vanilla in the frosting. Mmmmmmmmmmm and I crushed up the pineapple myself   Not canned

It was a big hit with the who,e family, even my picky ten year old who doesn't eat pineapple!  I did cut the sugar in half and added 1/4 c oil as suggested by other reviews. We also ate the cake with fresh whipped cream instead of the cream cheese icing, which was just perfect.  This recipe will definitely be in my rotation for desserts from now on, and it was so easy to make too!??

This cake is absolutely delicious! After reading all the above reviews I decided to take some of the suggestions on board so I added 1/2 a cup of coconut, 1/4 cup oil, made it with fresh pineapple soaked in rum as previously said, baked in a the oven for 30 minutes and did reduce the temp at the end so it wouldn't burn. We just had with the cream cheese topping and it's just divine! A winner!! Will def make it again for the rest of the family. You won't be disappointed.

Very easy recipe. As others suggested, I only baked for 30-35 min in a 13x9, used 1.5 c sugar, & added a little oil.  Really good, I like the texture & how all the ingredients are items that are likely in my kitchen. Recommend!

Tried this recipe, it was fantastic! I love lots of cream cheese icing but am not a fan of cream cheese icing that is too sweet. Doubled the amount of cream cheese and only added one cup of powdered sugar. Delicious!

I've made this 2 days in a row now, to use up the giant can of Pizza Pineapple I'd bought at Costco, so the pineapple chunks were more noticeable in mine.  Turned out very well.  I halved the icing recipe on today's batch, as I thought the full recipe was a bit overpowering.  It's a keeper.

I followed the recipe to a "T".  Okay a "3/4 T" because I used different sized baking pans.

Clarity is needed on the bake time.  I checked the cakes at 3o minutes and the cakes were still jiggly and my cake pick did not pull clean results so I left the cake in the oven. The top of my cakes were very brown.  

I cut the cakes after they cooled and the inside was just as brown, if not browner than the outside.

I made this exactly as stated and it is AMAZING! It's moist and rose perfectly! There were some reviews saying it was dry and didn't rise, I don't know what they did because this cake is amazing! My husband, who does not like sweets, liked this cake. It is not overly sweet and that's what we love! Definitely making this one again!

Followed recipe exactly.. So easy to make & so good. I read the reviews and maybe next time, will consider adding a little oil to the cake but really, it was great without it.  The only thing was we couldn't wait till the cake was just "warm" to frost! I frosted it as soon as it came out of the oven, made a cup of coffee & dug in. Husband agrees, wonderful cake!

So yummy and easy to make! The whole family loved it.  We added some peanut butter chips and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I also made cupcakes. We got 2 dozen and it took about 18 minutes to make. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very simple recipe but the batter tasted better than the finished product.  I will try it again with a few modifications. Reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cup, put about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of oil ( I put 1/4 cup this time and it was still a bit chewy) I added a tsp of cinnamon powder, next time I'll grate some nutmeg too.

The reason this cake calls for the same amount of sugar as flour is because there is no fat. I used less sugar (1 1/2 cups), but added coconut oil (1/2 cup) and it turned out great!

This cake is VERY moist & out of this world! I did a slight change to the frosting. I added coconut extract instead of vanilla. Oh my land....what a tropical wonderland. This recipe stays in my kitchen library.

this recipe is perfect the way it is.  It does not need oil or butter, why do you want to add fat when it is not necessary?  If you haven't tried it without the extra fat, try it.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  I use a 15 or 15 1/2 oz. can of pineapple (can't remember which) juice and all.  I have had nothing but compliments on this cake.

The recipe needs to state size of pan.  I used an 8X8 loaf pan and fortunately put a safety cookie sheet under it because it flowed over during baking. Also it seems like too much frosting for this sized cake.  I used fresh pineapple so maybe that made a difference?  I needed an extra 15 minutes of baking time also.  I believe the cake should be allowed to cool before frosting because even when just warm the frosting melts too quickly while being applied.  Otherwise the flavor is nice and the sponge texture is ok.

I read many of the reviews before making this cake, and decided to give it a try. While it wasn't bad, we all felt that it was missing just a little 'something'. I loved the ease of making it, and the fact that it was fat free. Perhaps next time I will add a little cinnamon and some salt. I didn't mind that it was dense and moist, and while I did use canned cream cheese frosting, I suspect that it might be even better with just a dusting of powdered sugar.

I made this cake exactly as directed but baked it in a bundt pan for a friend's birthday.  She and her husband said it was the best cake they have ever eaten. The cake is very dense but lovely.  I made my frosting with whipped cream cheese, powdered sugar, pineapple juice, and unsweetened coconut.  Then I sprinkled more coconut on top and placed little pieces of pineapple.  Amazing!!

I like chewy and really soft cakes so I had no problem with the consistency but, I hate cakes that are too sweet.  Recipes are dependent on your taste buds and I did not taste any pineapple flavor in this cake only sugar; it definitely needs other flavors to enhance it. I won’t be making this cake again because I would rather a cake without pineapple as the main ingredient. The only thing I can suggest is to add other things (e.g.coconut,orange rinds) because pineapple is mostly water and does not have a lot of flavor to begin with so when baking it becomes a watery unflavored mush. I still appreciate and respect everyone's recipe contributions. Thanks!

I  made some tweaks that really enhanced the cake- I used fresh cut pineapple, did 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar, and used spiced rum to replace the juice that would have come with the canned pineapple. I also added crushed pineapple and macadamia nuts to the frosting. delliiiicious

This is an excellent cake for potlucks - I add 1 cup chopped walnuts which gives it a unique taste - almost like carrot cake and so moist.  Also, I bake this in a sheet cake pan for 20 minutes which goes further and yet, everyone is still asking for more.  The cream cheese frosting tops it off well and I usually add some sprinkled crushed nuts to the top as well.  YUMMY

I made this to test as a wedding cake option and let some of my friends try it. I agree with other reviewers that it has a very strange texture, quite dense and moist to the point of wetness. However, the taste was very good. I used canned pineapple in pineapple juice rather than syrup, so I didn't find it to be overly sweet. Everyone who tried it enjoyed the taste and liked that it was so moist, so I will probably end up using it for the wedding. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8"x8" square pan, but as it only filled half the pan when baked, I don't feel that this recipe would fill a 9"x13" pan 2" deep. I would double the recipe if I were making it in that size of pan.

Really Good--I needed to find a recipe to accommodate what I needed to use up-cream cheese and a can of crushed pineapple. What a great treat. I think I will offer to bring this to the next family gathering.Thank you for sharing!

Easy, yes. Not bad but not my favorite. I think the frosting is necessary. If you don't care for a wet like taste you won't care for this. The cake wasn't exceptional with pineapple flavor. If I make this again I would add some pineapple extract. And do refrigerate. Probably better in warmer weather. Cooked only 30 min. in my oven. DH did like it.

This cake was not good at all!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out WAY too sweet and there was no pineapple flavor to it whatsoever and it wasn't moist.  I took a bite just to taste it right after it came out of the oven and it tasted so terrible, I had to throw it out.  For readers who'd like to make this, I would recommend using half of the recommended sugar and a lot of fresh pineapples.  But I won't make this again.

Too easy = too good to be true. The cake is SO sticky that you can't get it out of the pan, even if with cooking spray. In spite of the 20 oz can of pineapples, it doesn't taste very fruity. Very mushy cake. No way am I serving this on my mother's birthday! Also, if you leave the cake in for the recommended 45 minutes at 350, it'll burn because of all the sugar in this recipe. I'm going to find a better one.

Agreed, DO NOT bake 45 minutes, 30 is plenty in a 13x9 pan.  I only used 1.5 cups of sugar per others suggestions and this was fine.  The consistency of the cake is a bit spongy, I guess due to the lack of oil/baking soda.  However, we still did enjoy the taste, although not overly pineapply.  I think I will add some pineapple extract next time.  I substituted low fat cream cheese for full fat and next time will only add a 1/4 cup of butter to the frosting.  'Cream cheese frosting 2' from this site uses this ratio and it works fine.  A nice lower fat dessert with these modifications.

Do NOT bake for 45 minutes!  I baked for 30 minutes and it was overdone.  Not the greatest, to me tasted like applesauce cake. I added walnuts and we ate it without any frosting because it was already very sweet. It was just o.k.

An easy, delicious, and quick dessert or treat. I halved the recipe, followed the mixing directions exactly, put it in an eight inch round pan, and baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Next time I would drizzle the icing over the warm cake as opposed to actually icing it.

This was really gooey, more like pineapple bars than cake, but it was very delicious.  The frosting was great!
