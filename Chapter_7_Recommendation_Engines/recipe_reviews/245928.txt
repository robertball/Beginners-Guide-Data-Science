We omit the sausage when making this so I can't give it 5.  But my family loves this one on fondue night! We just keep all the sausages on the side for dipping.  We always accompany with a beer cheddar fondue and a variety of veggies, ham chunks, and this latest edition we also had soft pretzels on the side.  Yummy!
