My husband really enjoy this recipe. We have made it with heavy whipping cream and left out the flour (instead of milk) and it is great that way also.

I thought this recipe was very good. It's like a mushroom gravy. Since a lot of other people said it didn't thicken up well, I only used 1 cup milk and that worked great. I served it over rice and it was excellent and very easy to make.

This was very good but it seemed like it had too much butter, I may have not put enough mushrooms in it but it never really thickened up. Over rice it was really good. I will make this again.

I put in more worcestershire sauce than the recipe called for because it seemed a little bland.  I think it needs something else, I sprinkled some chicken salt on it, but maybe a little garlic might be good.

It was good as a basic sauce, but rather bland for my taste. The second time I added 1/4 C white wine after the mushrooms became tender  (allowing the wine to cook off for 3 minutes), then I added a clove of minced garlic, and sauteed another minute before adding remaining ingredients. For those who said it was too saucy, try sauteing the mushrooms long enough to evaporate all the water out of them first, before adding the remaining ingredients).

so yummy! after reading a few other reviews, I didn't use a full 1/4c butter but I still think it was a bit too much. Also, some people said it was a bit bland, I thought it was awesome.  I used soy milk so maybe that helped a bit, and I used 1 Tbsp flour and 1 Tbsp flax meal.  Oh, and I also threw in some asparagus :O)

I made it as a snack one night over toast (one serving)so I just put a few pinches of  the flour, bit of milk and soy. Just adjust the measurements to suit, turned out great! Simple and yummy.

Yummy, I was suprised because the recipe is so simple. I think I would use more mushrooms next time(at my grocery store they come in a 12oz package and I think that would be perfect). I served it over noodles. My 5 yr old said this was his favorite recipe ever(but he is going through a mushroom phase right now)!

This was a great base recipe, I wanted to make a mushroom cream sauce for some chicken schnitzel but didn’t have any cream on hand. I made the following adjustments: i sautéed half an onion before I added the mushrooms, then added the milk, some cream cheese, parmesan, garlic and pepper and let it simmer before adding some corn starch mixed with water to thicken the mixture instead of flour. Turned out amazing!

We didn't care for this. I served it over pasta and we didn't think the two went well together. It needs garlic.

Nothing special.  I made this for my husband who is a BIG mushroom fan & served this over rice.  He wasn't impressed.  It did not have much flavor.

It was a little bland, but the magic of that is you can spice it up however you’d like.  Ground pepper and garlic salt was perfect to this dish.

I made this with a spot each of tomato and red chilli sauce, instead of soy sauce. I was also pretty generous with the butter. I have to say, the result is amazing.

It was bland so I improved it's flavour by adding a splash of white wine, and about a  teaspoon and half of beef boullion, and instead of soy sauce I substituted with worstershire sauce.  Much much better.

Cooked mushrooms in butter.  When mushrooms were cooked down added a little minced garlic, cooked a little.  Added flour, cooked a little.  Added about 1/4 cup of vermouth, cooked alcohol away.  Added heavy cream instead of milk.  Let it thicken, added 1-2 tbsp of lemon.  Very yummy.

It was easy to make , and good ...I can't say it was great. I had some mushrooms that needed to be used up, and this was a good recipe for that. This can be mixed with plain rice or pasta for a quick meal. This does not have a particular beef or chicken flavor, so it could easily be added to beef or chicken leftovers to jazz them up. Will probably make again.

For a healthier version (not compromising tastiness!) : substitute milk and flour, with rice milk and rye flour. Sprinkle with dill.

This made a very quick and easy side dish.  I'm not a mushroom person but the rest of my family is and they enjoyed this dish very much.  I didn't use the flour or milk...just sauteed the shrooms in butter and added the soy sauce, salt and pepper.  These were very much enjoyed Joan...thanks.
