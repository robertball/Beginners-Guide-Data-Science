I tasted a bit of the slow-cooked pork before I added the store-bought barbeque sauce that we had on hand, and it was delicious!  I loved the coffee flavor, and the red pepper gave it some extra tang while the bourbon gave it a bit of a kick!  Once I added the barbeque sauce at the end and cooked it for another 2 hours, it was magical!  I'd give this recipe a 6 if I could!

This was good barbecued pork! I did everything as stated except I left out the whisky. I used Sweet Baby Rays Original sauce (our favorite) and served this on potato rolls with coleslaw on the bun. I don't think you should dump out all of the cooking liquid, though. My meat was a bit dry upon shredding so I  added some more beef stock with the BBQ Sauce. That seemed to fix the problem.

Rewrote the last step to indicate that the liquid is discarded after cooking the roast.

I am a proficient Cajun cook, but must have misunderstood this recipe.  Even before I began making this recipe, I was wondering why on earth you would need 6 cups of cooking liquid to cook a small roast in a slow cooker.  The recipe never did say what to do with that liquid after the pork roast was cooked - were you supposed to discard it or add it back into the pot?  I discarded most (5 cups) of it, and felt like I wasted good beef stock and coffee, but otherwise we would have had barbecued pulled pork soup.  In the end, the pork tasted fine, like shreddd pork in barbecue sauce, but nothing out of this world.  I'm sure there's another pulled pork recipe out there that will suit my tastes more.  Sorry.

Husband just loved it!!!  I used jarred minced garlic and left it cook on low for 6 and 1/2 hours.  It was very easy to pull apart.  I reserved 1/2 cup of the liquid and added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke before adding the bottle BBQ sauce.  After having it on low for two hours it was very juicy.  Next time I will definitely make homemade BBQ sauce for these!!!

We thought this turned out great!  I was in a hurry so I improvised and instead of dicing the onion I used 1 pkg. of Lipton Onion soup, in addition, I used 1 can of Campbell's French Onion soup with the remaining part of the beef broth.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's.  It was delicious!

This recipe was great!  I made it for the Superbowl.  I didn't have any Worcestershire and I used a 4.5 lb piece of bone-in pork shoulder.  I also reduced the cooking time by putting the cooker on high for about three hours.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  When I served it, I topped the sandwiches with cole slaw to make it Memphis style.  It was just like you would get in a BBQ restaurant.  I will definitely make this again!

In my opinion, I'm not sure the juices gave the pork all that unique or remarkable  flavor.. the final result is probably only as good as the barbeque sauce you use.  However, the remaining liquid, once strained, was actually the best French Onion Soup!  I used it for that!

Read all the reviews on this recipe and my husband was apprehensive about the coffee.  I told him I go by the reviews and to "wait and taste"!  Followed the recipe, SAVING about a cup of the excess broth and adding some in with the bottled BBQ sauce! Huge success for company, absolutely delicious, distinctive taste, alot went back for seconds and  gave the recipe out to several people along with the website!  The next day heated up the leftovers and my picky-eater son asked me to "keep makin' this mom!"  FAST! EASY! DEFINATE PLEASER! Served it with my Scalloped Pineapple side dish which is also a popular recipe requester!  Adding to this site today!

A comment about the leftover broth. I know I wrote "discard" but you really don't have to!  I've used the broth to make beef stew (you'll need to balance it with some red wine), french onion soup, etc.  I simply meant to remove it from the crock pot.

I made this and it was amazing.  I doubled the recipe.  I did make the meat in 2 different crock pots.  When I shredded up up I mixed it all together. I removed all the onions and put the juice to the side while I was shredding the meat.  I then added some juice and bbq sauce mixed it up then mixed it with the meat in the crock pot.  I added a little extra juice to keep it moist and kept it in the crock pot for a few hours till we were ready to eat. I had the bbq sauce on the side so my guests could add as much or as little as they wanted.  It was amazing!  I will be making this again!

Family loved it!  I thought that 2 bottles of BBQ sauce was too much so I only put one,  I think 1 1/2 would have been perfect.

This was so yummy and smelled great while it was cooking. the only thing I changed was I reduced the beef broth because I couldnt see having so much liquid for such a small roast. It was perfectly yummy and my kids and husband love it.

We did not think this was as great as everyone else did. I followed the directions to a "t". Maybe I added to much bbq sauce. I doubt if I make it again.

WOW this was awesome!  Best pulled pork I have ever had.  followed recipe almost exactly, my changes: I left out the water, I had already made strong french vanilla coffee,  my barbecue sauce was sweet baby rays raspberry chipoltle sauce, to which I added half a cup of twisted tea, it was amazing.  Had a bit of a sweeter flavor than was probably intended but still great (and spicy).  Also when the pork was done I actually rinsed about half a cup off because my 4 year old hates bbq sauce and it was perfect for him (still yummy enough for big people to eat if you want less spice).  we paired it with homemade fries and he said it was the best dinner ever, how sweet!  We will DEFINATELY be making this again.

This was great, I've never made barbeque pork before.  I only changed the recipe a little, skipped the whiskey and added 3/4c Coca Cola instead, reduced the coffee to 3/4c.  I also reduced the amount of broth and skipped the water due to the size of my crock pot.  Because of my work schedule, I had to cook the roast on Low for 10 hours, but that didn't seem to cause a problem.  

My husband loved it, so did my kids (all under 9)!  Definitely making this again and again!

Oh My Goodness...This was fantastic!  Everyone in the house nearly fell over at how delicious these BBQ'd Pork Sandwiches tasted!  The meat was so tender, it just fell apart!  The combo of coffee, bourbon, and broth sounded so strange to me, but I decided to go with it.  I'm VERY glad I did!  Five Big Shiny Delicious Stars!!!

This was very good and we certainly did enjoy it.  However, I’m thinking it was because of the excellent barbecue sauce I used at the end, not necessarily because of all the ingredients used to cook the roast in.  Also, careful with all that liquid!  I had a roast just shy of three pounds and used amounts of the ingredients about equivalent to what would be indicated in the recipe scaled to just three servings, not the original twelve.

So full of flavor and tasty!  I didn't have the bourbon and I cut back the broth and coffee just a little, just because it seemed like too much liquid.  I cooked it for a crowd of 35 people and everyone just loved it.

This made some great pork BBQ.  The only change I made was to add a homemade barbeque sauce.  Really great for our tailgate party!

I made this yesterday and it came out fantastic!  I used all the ingredients except for the red pepper flakes as my 7-year-old dislikes all pepper.  I tweaked a few things, most notably:
1) chopped the garlic instead of whole cloves
2) added 2 tbs of Liquid Smoke
3) I pulled the pork, but didn't discard the liquid.  I placed the shredded pork back in the liquid and put the whole pot in the refrigerator over night.  Next day, I put in back in the slow cooker and let it warm up for about 2 hours.  The shredded pork has now absorbed about 80% of the liquid, leaving it much more moist; additionally, all the chopped onions and garlic are now part of the pork.  I then transferred the pork into a large sautee pan, added the BBQ sauce, and put in a covered outdoor grill for about an hour, with the temp fluctuating between 350 and 400 degrees.  That is the key move:  letting the BBQ really cook into the meat.  It was phenomenally delicious and juicy, served in small Hawaiian sweet rolls.

Absolutely FABULOUS!  Followed the exact recipe but added a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon to the cooking liquid.  My 3 adult sons & my husband literally licked the crock pot clean!

Maybe my roast was a little small or I got to big or BBQ sauce bottles but i found this way to saucey.  The second time i made this I followed the meat cooking part but used a clubhouse pulled pork sauce mix and liked it much better. Cheating a little bit but I've made it twice this way and people love it.

Very good but wasteful.  I think you could use 1/2 the liquids.

BIG hit with our family!  We really dug through a lot of recipes for the right one -and this is it. Great with KFC coleslaw (that's the only one we like), maybe we can find a recipe for that next! *Do keep some of the liquid to add later, I ended up using water -it was still great.

excellent!  I followed the recipe just as it was written with the exception of discarding most of the liquid from the roast.  My in-laws really enjoyed this as well as my toddler:)

This recipe kicked!  It tasted delicious with the coffee flavor.  The bourbon and red pepper were just icing on the cake so to speak.  If you have the time while this amazing recipe is slow cooking make some homemade BBQ sauce!!

This fed 3 adults and 3 children with plenty of leftovers. Everyone enjoyed it. I cut down some of the liquid after reading the reviews, but still had a lot of juice left over. I also put mine in the oven for a few minutes after chopping it to brown it and add a little crispness.

The pork was delicious BEFORE adding the sauce! Taste before adding a bottled sauce. You may want to add much less sauce than this recipe calls for!

I love this basic recipes I added to the mix beef stock, 2 bay leaves, some pepper corn and about ¼ cup of beer. I don't really care for off the shelf BBQ sauce. So I made my own

In a sauce pan I add
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
¼ cup white mind vinegar
¼ white distilled vinegar
2 table spoons of malted vinegar
¼ cup beer
3 table spoons Worcestershire  sauce
4 dashes liquid smoke
1 cup catsup
¼ cup cherry juice 
1 table spoon hot sauce
½ table spoon ground mustard
Dash of cayenne
½ cup brown sugar
¼ cup honey 
4 table spoons chopped onions
1 clove garlic
4 slices of diced bacon
And cook it for about an hour on low heat before poring over the BBQ pork
As the mix became thicker I added a bit of the liquid from the slow cooker. 
As a side I made home made coleslaw.

I found this recipe a few years back. This is great! All my people love it (well not the vegans), and I was psyched to find it again! I've got this in my cooker right now for later. The bourbon and coffee are the key (we love them both)and smashing the whole cloves of garlic adds a lot. I tend to add my own version to recipes, just not this one. We have some happy bikers waiting to have this again!

After shredding the pork, I deviated from the recipe.  I used about 1/3 of a bottle of Jack Daniel's bourbon barbecue sauce and mixed it with about 2/3 cup of cooking liquid, 1 Tbs of tomato paste and 2 tbs bourbon.  It came out great!

My first time making barbeque.  We loved it.  I didn't have whiskey so I used some dry white wine and used beef boullion instead of beef broth because that is what I had on hand.   I added more onion and used minced garlic added all the ingredients and let the pork go for 6 hours.  I then took the meat out and used about 1/2 cup of the broth and added sweet baby rays barbeque sauce 2 different bottles.  Let that cook on low for 2 hours and it was delicious.  Thank you for sharing.

This took a long time but was yummy...I would cut down on the amount of BBQ sauce next time, as it drowns the flavor cooked into the pork.

Amazing... I normally don't follow recipes , I've thought of them as mere suggestions ( being the free spirit that I am)?? but I have to say, this one intrigued me. I followed it step by step ingredient by ingredient. So very impressed!!! Two "Yums" up!

This recipe is seriously good. Like others I was hesitant about the coffee. Included it anyway. I followed everything exactly except I used a 4.5 lb bone-in pork roast instead of 2.5 boneless. Cooked on low for 7 hours and the meat literally FELL off the bone. I could've shredded it with just a fork the meat was that tender. As far as taste I only wish I would have added more garlic. Having vacationed often in southern Alabama, we pride ourselves on being pulled pork snobs. This recipe did not disappoint! Thanks!

Awesome! This is the best I ever had. I omitted the water to reduce the liquid as others suggested. There was still too much. I used a half bottle of Open Pit. I will never go out for pulled pork again.

Was okay.  I slow cook pork all the time and I thought this one lacked a little flavor.  I liked the coffee addition, though, and will definitely try to incorporate it in other recipes.

Made this for the Super Bowl and didn't have anything let over!  Great recipe!  I used 17th Street bbq sauce, they are 3 time grand champions for their ribs and pork!  With the bbq sauce it almost tasted just like the real thing, AMAZING!

This was absolutely great and so easy to make.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Also, my husband and I split the recipe and made enough for just 6 people and we still had so much left even after four people ate 2 helpings each!

Great recipe! I had cooked pork in the freezer so I didn't have to cook it as long. I didn't use the water or whiskey from the recipe. Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce makes it delicious!!!

I totally agree with SharmanB review!  In my opinion, this recipe is more for a 7# or more loin.  The 5 cups of liquid was way too much for a 2 1/2#.  My pork loin was literally swimming in liquid.  Half way through I checked it and basically it was just boiling the meat.  I tasted the liquid mixture (ugh!) and the meat was tough as shoe leather.  I almost discarded the whole mess when I decided to drain all the liquid except for about an inch.  Cooked it for an hour longer and when I checked it again, the meat was tender and done.  After shredding and adding the BBQ sauce I didn't cook it any longer.  It turned out in the end pretty good.  Thus the 3 stars instead of the 1 star I was going to rate it.  Like SharmanB said, "Sorry"!

This is an awesome recipe I live on the river and go boating all day I put it in the slow cooker around 6 AM and return at 4 PM 10 hours later and it was cooked to perfection. All my friends loved it!!! Simple, easy and no fussing...put it on low and slow and let it go.

I followed the recipe and it made a great pulled pork, definitely adding a touch extra sauce was helpful. It's important that one knows their own palate and chooses those flavors/seasonings preferred. Of course, having it with coleslaw is a must in our household.
The best hint though was to save the liquid - do NOT discard it! I made theeee best French Onion Soup with it, and felt like I got multiple meals from just one recipe.

Made this for prep for a hurricane and it was a hit.  I accidentally (haha) stubbed my toe when pouring the bourbon so it got more than the recipe called for and when I went to discard the juices, I strained it and added the onions back into the meat for the final cook with the BBQ sauce.  I used the original and the sweet BBQ sauce from Weber.   When the rolls ran out, the corn chips were opened and created nacho's....also a hit. Going to make this for a Cowgirl Baby shower!  Great Recipe!!

I used Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce and southern mustard sauce.  This recipe required a little more attention than I would have liked for a slow cooker recipe.

-- No, seriously, I rarely eat pork but this recipe is out of this world. I never have leftovers when I make it for parties and people demand the recipe.

Used 4 heaping TSP of minced garlic instead of cloves. Great. Agreed, the added BBQ sauce isn't necessary for flavor.

I make this all the time. The only thing I do different is to use minced garlic, saving a step later. After it is done I strain the broth saving a the stuff in the bottom and adding it back to the shredded pork. I also reserve the broth and freeze it in serving sizes to use for gravy with roasted pork or whatever later. It makes awesome gravy.
Thanks for the recipe, we love it.

I have made this twice now the first time I did on the run so I didnt have Worcestershire sauce, or the bourbon so I used soy sauce and a little more broth. Both times it was a hit! The second time, it fed 9 adults and 5 children.

It was wonderful, everyone went home with the recipe. It sounded funny with coffee and wiskey, but it turned out perfect

I made this for our Memorial Day party and it was a hit.  I actually didn't get a chance to have any, but my husband said it was great.

Delicious!!!  I halved the recipe since I was just making this for my husband and I.  I used a 1lb pork tenderloin and even before the bbq sauce was added, it was terrific.  I used about a 1/2 bottle of Jack Daniels Spicy BBQ sauce and a touch of the cooking liquid (maybe 1/4 c if that).  I am going to keep this in mind for football season for tailgating!!!!

This recipe was awesome, i did not have the worcestshire sauce but i used steak marinade instead. I omitted the water. I also took another's advice not to dump all liquid before adding bbq sauce, it came out a little messy like sloppy joes but all was great. Next time i may leave only 1/2 cup of liquid. I will definitely make this again.

This was an excellent recipe.  I used a sirloin roast that was pretty lean & it was very tender and tasty. I started it in the a.m. on New Year's Day & left it on for about 6 hours, then shredded it & left it in the barbeque sauce for about 1 hour.  I put some bannana peppers on my sandwich for some spice & it was really good!
