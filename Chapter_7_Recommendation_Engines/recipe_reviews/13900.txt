This was so fast and delicious.  I substituted honey for the molasses, because I didn't have any molasses.  It didn't seem as delicate as indicated regarding heat.  I halved the recipe, and still had enough left over to keep in the fridge for 3 days, served it with lo mein, carrots, spinach and dry scallops, after doing the initial stir frying in peanut oil.  One of the quickest, most versatile recipies I've ever used.

I've also served it as sauce for salmon:  fabulous!

perfectly easy.  perfectly balanced.  yeah, you could add this, that and the other to taste.  however, it really is perfect as is.  well, i did do something slightly different. i did half molasses, half brown sugar (the splenda brown sugar stuff) and it was juuust right. really, really yummy.

I was looking for a simple peanut sauce for satays - for a wedding we're helping with last weekend.  I found it, and I love it!!!  Thanks.  I generally made as directed, halving the cayenne and adding 2t crushed ginger and 2t crushed garlic.  I used the full amount of vinegar and loved it, as did all the guests.  I love vinegar in general, but I got the impression everyone else did too, so I'm not sure what to say about some of the other reviews.  Maybe know your own vinegar preferences, and start with half and adjust to your personal taste I guess.

I substituted soy sauce for tamari and honey for molasses...man are there some odd ingredients in this - super sweet, super salty, super spicy and super sour but the taste is unbelievably good.  I made the breaded, fried and softly spiced tofu from this site and it needed something just right to go with it and this was it!  Thanks for a super quick, easy and delicious recipe Laura!  Will DEFINATELY make again soon!

Excellent.  After lunch at a Thai cafe, we were craving more peanut sauce!  I used brown sugar, and rice wine vinegar, and black pepper, since I didn't have the exact ingriedients.  We ate it over brown rice, broc, tofu, onions and garlic.  Very good.

Tasty! I resorted to this after the store was out of our favorite peanut sauce mix and now I'll never go back. I followed recommendations to halve the vinegar and use brown sugar instead of molasses. I also added 1/2 cup more peanut butter, some ground ginger, curry powder, cumin and 1/2 can of coconut milk. It passed the wife and kids test and we'll definitely make this one again.

This is a super easy recipe and basically no flaw.  I give it a 5* for that reason alone.  I did use soy sauce instead of tamari, and added 1t ginger paste, 3 finely diced green onions with tops, 1t minced garlic and 1/4 cup finely diced red bell pepper.  You wouldn't have to add it but I always change recipes up. lol  I poured it over bow tie pasta.  Next I will try lightly sauted vegies.

This sauce is perfect!  Even my "picky eater" took his requisite "one bite" and then finished the entire plate of food with this sauce on it.  Very easily made too.  Love it!

I really liked this, however, my stepdaughter would not even touch it and my husband found it too vinegary. Perhaps I will try again and take a note from other reviewers and reduce the vinegar.

Out of all the peanut sauce recipes I have tried, I must admit this one is my favourite.  Like many reviewers, I substituted the molasses with a touch of honey and brown sugar and used a tad bit of rice vinegar instead of distilled vinegar.  I added red pepper flakes which gave it much more of a kick.  Thank you for this amazing recipe.

I've been looking for an easy but flavorful peanut sauce recipe since I've had a peanut dish at a restaurant. I substituted the tamari and molasses  for soy sauce and brown sugar (as other people have used) since I didn't have it on hand, but it turned out PERFECT! My husband was one happy boy. It's a touch spicy for me so next time I won't be adding pepper in my batch. Overall, thanks so much for the recipe!

This was delicious for dipping spring rolls, and so easy to put together. I'll never buy bottled peanut sauce again.

Good, and very easy, plus--which is what made me pick this one--it doesn't have 8,000 ingredients.  Granted, I have most of the ingredients the other recipes call for since I have a VERY well stocked pantry, but I hesitated to open a bunch of things for 1 drop or 1/2 a cup or whatever the other recipes called for.  I just sprinkled in some cayenne, and it is plenty spicy for me, so use what you feel will work for you.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it exactly as stated and the taste of vinegar was so overpowering. I probably should have listened to the other reviews saying to half the vinegar but it was so bad that I will not even attempt to make it again.

Made this as a dipping sauce for rolls and I'll use it again with noodles and veggies. I tried making this with rice wine vinegar because the strong flavor of white vinegar is often too much for my family, and it was still too much vinegar. I used soy sauce instead of tamari, but traded the cayenne for ginger and garlic for a huge improvement.

WOW! I haven't had a good peanut sauce in years! So glad I found this recipe. I used the sauce as a "spread" for a tofu sandwich (for Meatless Mondays). I did use half of the vinegar, may try the full amount next time.

This is a really great recipe... fast and easy to make, and has ingredients most people have on hand. I did substitute honey for molasses as that is all I had. It has a nice spicy kick. However, I agree about the vinegar... I used rice vinegar (milder than white vinegar) and it was still too much. Had to add more peanut butter and a dash of fish sauce to try balance it. Admittedly I am not a vinegar fan, but I still think that halving the vinegar would make this a 5-star recipe. Regardless, I'm sure I will make this again... served as a sauce for chicken breast pieces threaded on skewers (easiest fancy appetizer ever!), and had leftover sauce on pasta with some stir-fried veggies. Thanks for sharing this!!

This sauce definitely has a kick and makes an otherwise plain dish of veggies and rice bursting with flavor. You will be wanting seconds, for sure. It was also very easy to make.

I've been trying to find a reasonable, easy to make Peanut Sauce recipe, because I go through the bottle like nobody's business!  I did what most others recommended: honey, soy sauce and paprika.  I also added some garlic (was going to use ginger, but didn't have any at home).  Word from the semi-wise: Be very careful with the amount of white vinegar you use.  Too much, and that taste can't be masked.  Very tasty, thanks!

Used rice vinegar, soy sauce, and brown sugar/honey as substitutes for some ingredients. Tasted good, but was better after adding a little garlic, onion powder, and ginger.

If you like peanut sauces, try this one. I used it on my Beef Fried Rice recipe. I had to substitute soy sauce for the tamari, as I had none. I also put in about 3/4 of a cup of apricot/pineapple preserves...YUMMM. My husband gave  this a BIG thumbs UP! My daughter went back for seconds and she doesn't like my beef fried rice dishes. That says alot. I'll be using this peanut sauce from now on in my fried rice dishes.

This was really good after a few modifications.  Per previous reviews, I only added half the vinigar, and still found the sauce very runny and had to add more peanut butter.  The sauce also ended up being too salty, will add less Bragg's next time. Added a little garlic powder and ginger to jazz it up a bit. Served with stir-fried sweet potatoes, onions and tofu - delish!  Thanks!

This sauce is great!  I added a tablespoon of ginger paste and omitted the cayenne.  I threw in an extra splash of vinegar, too.  I will make this again and again.

Fantastic. I was scared to use so much vinegar and cayenne so I halved those 2 ingredients - someone suggessted soy sauce instead of tamari so I did that and used splenda instead of molassis. I also added a sprig of minced fresh basil. It was still spicy enough for us and it went perfect with the chicken satay and noodles I cooked. I thought it would be too much sauce but we ate it all. I will definately make again.

This worked well, but next time I will use brown sugar instead of molasses; the flavor was too strong.

I made just a few changes. I used rice wine vinegar instead of plain and in place of tamari I used soy sauce. It was really good. I tossed it with some cold whole wheat rotini and broccoli to make a unique pasta salad. Yum Yum! You can also add some red pepper flakes to give it some heat if you like.

This is the best, fool-proof peanut sauce I've ever made!  I agree--the heating is not picky.  If the sauce is too thin, you can bring it to a simmer, and it will thicken up immediately.  (be careful though, it does thicken quickly) I served this over stir-fried veggies and tofu.  It was SOOOOO yummy!! This is now my go-to peanut sauce recipe, for everything from stir-fry to noodles to satay sauce!!

I used crunchy peanut butter and soy sauce instead of the tamari.  It turned out delicious!  I used it as a dressing for an Asian salad with chicken and cabbage.

Fantastic!  I wouldn't do anything to change this recipe.  It turned out exactly like I was hoping: a simple base of peanut butter, with noticeable sweetness and a hint of spicy.

Yum! This was so good and so easy...even my boyfriend could make it. I've made it for both chicken and asian noodles and it was tasty with both. The first time I made it I didn't have enough PB so I just tossed some peanuts in the food processor to make up for it. Tasty!

Made this using soy instead of tamari.. again, because it's hard to find. Also, I upped the amount of peanut butter to a cup and a half, and used Chuncky style instead. Adds a GREAT texture. This was simple and Very yummy!

sauce was good but next time I'm going to add less water me by half.  seemed like it was more of a peanut butter gravy instead of a sauce.

This is the second peanut sauce I've tried on AllRecipes, and it is pretty good.  Seemed a little weird that it would curdle if cooked too high.  But I followed the instructions and it tasted good over the leftover beef.  Added mushrooms to the beef and served with brown rice and salad.

Delicious!  Did honey instead, because that's what I had, but only one large spoonful. Also did white wine vinegar, because again, that's what I had.  Husband and kids loved it.

This was pretty good. 
I read some of the other reviews and made a few changes.
I didn't add any cayene as my kids are picky about the hot stuff, I also substituted brown sugar for the molasses and soy sauce for the tamari although just under a 1/4 cup.
I also omitted the vinegar as I realised after beginning to cook that I didn't actually have any, it tasted pretty good without so i probably won't bother to add it next time i make it either.
Anyways kids and hubby loved it :) happy mealtime = happy mom!!

Very good and easy! Subbed soy sauce and honey, and used 1/2 tsp cayenne since we have a little one. Started out with less vinegar just to be safe but it's definitely best with full amount. Might try with a bit less peanut butter next time...

Excellent, I made this ahead of time for a dish with vermicelli, very good.  Another reviewer noted the different ingredients, I believe this recipe is vegan.  I had to substitute soy sauce for the tamari but had molasses.  Omitted hot pepper due to preference, and kept vinegar the same.  Tasted as good as any Thai peanut sauce I've gotten in a restaurant.

Delicious!  This was my first attempt at peanut sauce and I think it was a success.  I'm not a huge fan of the molasses flavor so next time I will try brown sugar instead.  I did use soy sauce instead of tamari and I halved the vinegar due to other reviews.  Next time I will also add a bit of ginger.

This one is not for me. I admit I didn't have the molasses, but used honey instead, so that may have been it. It was a bit too vinegary and heavy for my taste.

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't care for this sauce.  The vinegar flavor was too strong (and I love vinegar).  The sauce was also much thinner then I anticipated and it didn't have enough spice.  I would recommend less vinegar, more cayenne, maybe some fresh ginger and a little extra tamari.

This was okay.  I only used half of the (rice) vinegar - it still seemed too much. And maybe too much soy?  Something was missing - maybe coconut milk?

I would not say this was delicious. I should have listened to other reviews and cut the vinegar in half. I did use rice vinegar. I needed to add 1/2 cup of peanut butter to enhance the flavor. I think, next time, I will add some ginger and garlic and a little more cayenne.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe.  I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and used soy sauce and honey since I already had them on hand.  The second time I made it, I also added 2 TBSP of hoisin sauce which my husband and I both really liked.  Thanks for such an easy delicious sauce recipe.

If I made this again, I would halve the amount of vinegar.
