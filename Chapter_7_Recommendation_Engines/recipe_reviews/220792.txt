We didn't have any cream cheese on hand and only cheddar was available. But they look and smell delicious as well as being tasty. I was sure to check the filling taste before filling them to make sure the seasonings and cheese amount was enough for our tastes. What a great way to use up phyllo.

when life gives you lemons and you make lemon aid is exactly how I felt about this recipe. I have never used phyllo sheets before so to me the instructions were not clear at all. How much mixture do we put in the squares and how do you seal the edges they don't just stick together.. and then there was no picture to show me what the final product should look like. I did not add the jalapeno I used green chilies instead. the filling was good.

I altered it slightly because I'm not a fan of peppers but it was still pretty darn good. Definitely keep a small bowl of water nearby as you're filling the pockets to seal the edges. (Sent my boyfriend to the store for egg roll and wonton wrappers for Chinese food night and he brought back four boxes of phyllo sheets so I've been trying to find ways to use them.)
