I'm rating this on only the filling. I was in a rush and wanted to try this, but didn't have time to make the bread, instead I used refrigerated biscuit dough and stuffed those with the yummy filling. These were great. The kids ate them! Will make these again and again! Finally got the kids to have some veggies. Thanks Larkspur!

I made these exactly as written, and they were worth the effort! So good! This is one of those recipes that has you saying "why didn't I think of that?" Very original and very, very tasty. These are kid friendly and freeze well. I make them in batches for the freezer. Perfect for a quick and easy 'good for you' addition to lunch boxes.

This was a simple and great recipe! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I think the recipe could have just called for biscuit dough instead of going through all those steps.   My hubby always says that there is no way I can get him to eat veggies. Well I did last night! It was fantastic! I was so surprised! Even my picky 2 yr old loved them!   I created exactly minus the dough. I used Grands Biscuits. Turned out awesome! My hubby took ALL the leftovers to work!

I tried these the other day... what a hit they were, the kids loved them.  They even were delicious cold.  I didn't make the bread though, I instead used Won Ton wraps and they were delicious.  Next time though I will brush them with the butter before putting them in the oven.

I made these just as instructed, but really did care for them. The recipe is a good recipe, but the taste didnt suit me.  Probably just my taste buds this time...

These were very tasty, just difficult to work the dough. I had a tough day for getting dough to rise - and the squares barely closed for me. I had a little of the groudn pork mixture left over, just couldn't get it all to fit in the dough - however the flavor was so good and everyone enjoyed these - and I followed the recipe exactly (except for using half ww flour & half bread flour - 1c each)

I made it into a pie with refrigerated dough to save time and used a homemade ranch mix (though it didn't taste ranch-y at all!). We thought it was just okay, and did make the recipe as-is.

Yum! These are beyond delicious. I really wanted to make these tonight, but I didn't have time after work to make the dough so I did use refrigerated biscuits. That worked quite well, but I will definitely make the dough next time to get the full effect. Awesome flavors and textures. Thanks so much, larkspur! :)

I have not made this yet, but I need something new to take to work.  Think I'll use turkey and spinach tortillas.

Used Grands biscuits, no zucchini, no red bell pepper and garlic powder....this changes due to not having the other ingredients and I didn't have time to go to the store. I used extra carrot and cabbage to compensate. My 5 children, ages 8-17, LOVED this recipe. The 10-year-old said we should have this every week. Was super easy with the biscuits, and because the grands are so good, I decided not to use butter, which was fine. I look forward to adding the zucchini and pepper next time. I think the pepper will be a yummy addition. Have printed out the recipe for my cookbook and a friend...it was that popular with my kiddos.

I only used the bread, but it was wonderful! I stuffed mine with lunch meats and cheese.

I too used refrigerated biscuit dough instead of using the recipe's. It was super simple this way to stuff them. I used an onion, 1/2 bellpepper, and a small bag of rainbow slaw mix for the cabbage/carrot (no zucchini on hand). We really liked the flavor that the ranch mix gave to the filling. These are the perfect size for a grab and go breakfast, and the possibilities for the fillings are endless!

These were very tasty. I used my bread machine to make the dough which made it easier. I used ground beef instead of pork. And I mistakenly  chopped my carrots finely instead of shredding them, I also used extra carrot. I made sure there was enough seasoning before filling the dough and I did add more ranch mix.

I used a biscuit dough for the crust. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I did skip the ground pork and added more vegetables to the filling. This came out great and I will definitely make it again.
