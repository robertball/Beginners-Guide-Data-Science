If this doesn't taste like your grandma's, then your grandma must've been a lousy cook. This is amazingly buttery shortbread, and was easy to make. My only change would be to cook it a little longer (maybe 5-7 minutes), and cut it into bars with a pizza wheel before it sets. Mine turned out fantastic, and I commend the submitter for an outstanding recipe.

This is truly wonderful and easy! I have also added some almond flavoring, which was very good. I used a cookie scoop and made individual cookies, which I found to be easier to handle.

This is the easiest and most tender shortbread I have ever made! It turns out everytime and my Grandaughters Autumn 4 yrs,and Tehya 1 3/4 yrs old love it! Thanks for posting this,I will use it often!  I do add 2 tsp of vanilla.  I throw everything into my big Kitchenaid stand mixer, and let it mix until I have a soft dough, and then I press the dough into a jelly roll pan that I have put parchment paper in and sprayed w/ cooking spray.  I also spray my hands and then I just press it  into the pan to fit. I have used either butter or margarine, and it always turns out great with either one! Sassycook

recipe is okay, wasn't like the shortbread from Scotland that I'm used to.  Seem to be a little to moist for that.  Taste good though and very easy to make

Was looking for a Key Lime Shortbread recipe, this was a good basic recipe to start with I added 2 T of powdered sugar to the dry  and 4 T of fresh squeezed Key Lime juice to the creamed butter and sugar. It could of used some zest, but I was afraid to slice my fingers on the itty bitty key limes!!! I used a cookie press to create bite sized cookies and baked for 13 mins @ 350! Every loved them.

Finally...an awesome shortbread recipe!  I'd about given up trying, I've been so disappointed with others I've tried, including "Martha's"...those were so bad I threw them out.  This cookie lives up to it's name...tender, buttery, melt-in-your mouth delicious.  I am a cookie diva...cookies are as essential to my existence as air!!  I do English-style tea luncheons and everything I make must be top quality and a bit different from the norm; I had a store-bought Earl Grey shortbread cookie and have wanted to make my own; now I can!  I used this recipe, using extra fine sugar (which I use for all the delicate cookies), adding Darjeeling tea leaves to the dough, along with Bergamot extract.  I rolled them in small balls and flattened with the bottom of a glass dusted with powdered sugar to keep from sticking.  Baked them on a parchment covered, air bake sheet for 16 min. (set but not browned).  I frosted them with powdered sugar mixed with a little more extract and some water.  They are outstanding!!

I tried this recipe with the intention of making cookies for church, and made a tester batch first, halving the recipe. The dough was thick and rich, and, after chilling it for a couple hours, the cookies came out perfect. Excited and eager to make more for my church, I whole heartedly mixed up the whole recipe. Immediately, I noticed that the batter was not as thick as the first batch, but attributed it to the fact that the butter was warmer this time that the first time. After chilling it in the freezer and putting them into the oven,  I pulled them out of the oven, and all of the cookies had connected and the dough was all spread out over the parchment paper! I was very upset. I mixed up another half batch because I only had one cup of butter left, and this time the dough came out thick again, like the first time. I baked them the next afternoon, letting it chill until then. They came out perfectly again! My advice is to halve the recipe first, making the cookies in small batches. I still turned out with thirty cookies.

I had never made shortbread before and spent well over an hour researching recipes.  I decided on this one and WOW!  Came out MORE than delicious, disappeared before bedtime (!!), and were easy to get together.  Thank you for the recipe!  Like others I will caution bakers to keep a good eye on these...once they start to brown they burn rather quickly.

this recipe is awesome.  Actually messed up, would have been great the way it is written, but I downsized the pan, and shouldnt have.  They took way to long to bake then came out partially raw near the middle.  So, I cut it and re-baked for 10 minutes at 325,  kind of like biscotti, and it turned out FANTASTIC!!!  The regular recipe is 5 star, double baked it is 10 star!

I was a little nervous with trying this one but after reading the reviews I jumped with both feet in and I am glad I did.  I did use butter as the recipe called for and can taste the lovely rich flavor of the butter.  I did also add a tsp of vanilla just because.  These cookies melt in your mouth.  I used a cookie scoop and the bottom of a glass to flatten them out.  I did adjust the oven temp to 350 and checked after 12 mins. I enhanced some with a dip in cinnamon sugar, some I pressed mini chocolate chips into and some I added an orange flavored icing.  I am so glad I tried this recipe, thanks so much for sharing it.

I love shortbread with a cup of coffee. This recipe is melt in your mouth. I made cookies. I rolled the dough into a 12-14 inch log and rolled the log in chocolate sprinkles. Wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerated for a couple hours so it would slice easily. Cut the log into 1/4 rounds. I did use parchment. Bake the cookies between 9-10 mins watching them carefully. They don't spread or puff. I took them out as soon as they no longer looked "wet" on top. Try not to over bake as the bottoms brown quickly. I let them cool on the baking sheet.

Just OK.  Definitely not phenomenal.  I normally use a tried and true family recipe that calls for icing sugar instead of white sugar.  The consistency of this shortbread is not what I was looking for - it is crispy rather than "short".  If you are considering trying this instead of a recipe that you already know is great - DON'T DO IT!  It does not have a the traditional shortbread consistency.  It really is not bad, but I'm just a little disappointed because i dont have time to make my other recipe before christmas.  I rolled it out and used cookie cutters - so maybe that somehow got rid of the smooth consistency i was looking for.

I am giving this a 5 star rating because it is a simple, tasty recipe. I halved the recipe and rolled out the dough, cut out 2 dozen cookies and baked on parchment paper. These are great with a cup of tea. My husband said to make them again and add some chopped pecans; his thinking is they will resemble a famous pecan cookie by a well known company. I also think this would be good baked on a pizza pan and used as the "crust" for fruit pizza. Thanks for submitting this recipe! It's a keeper.

This is a great recipe, possibly the best shortbread since it´s not just delicious but also very easy to make. I only had two sticks of butter, so I halved the recipe and rolled the dough into little balls. They baked in about 11 minutes. They are fantastic by themselves, but I also brushed some with lemon glaze. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a very good shortbread recipe. Quick and easy. It is very much like the shortbread in Scotland and Ireland. My son says it is his new favourite snack. Perfect with tea or coffee. I will be making this for Christmas to give as gifts for sure!

A hit every time with dinner guests - I have never received so many compliments on a desert!!
I usually bake this in 2 pie plates instead of a jelly-roll pan, then cut pie shaped wedges.  I use 2 bags of frozen berries (blackberry seems to be the favorite), heat them 'til bubbling and spoon over each wedge of shortbread.  I use all organic ingredients so everyone feels a wee bit better about consuming such a decadent treat  :)

My husband isn't a sweets guy, so for xmas cookies he requested shortbread.  He ate the entire batch within two days, and I had to start again (this time waiting till the 23rd) so we could have some for Christmas.  This is absolutely the BEST shortbread recipe.  It tastes as good or better than the best storebought I've ever had.

Followed this to the letter except for adding 2 tsp good vanilla, turned out perfect, well baked with the edges browner for those that like it this way.  I did cream the butter and sugar until fluffy,  beat all in my mixmaster until soft dough formed and came away from edges of bowl. Cut 1/2 way through dough after presssing in pan to make 48 squares, pricked them with a fork prior to baking.  Cut all the way through after 5 minutes cooling.  Taste just like yours Mom, miss you.

This is a good, solid shortbread recipe. I wasn’t blown away by it, but it turned out exactly the way shortbread should. If you want your basic can't-go-wrong shortbread, definitely use this recipe.

I had a "dora the explorer" cookie stamp and my little boy loves that show, so I rolled the cookie dough into balls and then stamped each ball w/ the cookie stamp.  I then baked them at 350 for 10 minutes,  They turned out really cute and really good and my son definitely loved them.

My DD has *nine* allergies to foods.  This is the ONLY cookie that she can eat.  She thinks it is heaven!!  I use white and brown rice flour, potato starch, nucoa margarine and organic evaporated cane sugar.  To change it up I also will sometimes add pumpkin pie spice.

I drop them on a cookie sheet until slightly brown and voila... my girl gets to enjoy the wonders of a cookie!

This recipe tasted nothing like heaven. I was expecting a very sweet and buttery taste, but after following the recipe exactly, the end result tasted like a variation of pancakes. Thanks anyways.

I made these cut-out cookies a few weeks ago with sugar cook dough, but they were too cake-like. I thought I'd try shortbread, and this recipe sounded like the easiest one. They came out great!

Very good cookies! So delicate, light and delicious! Good with a bit of homemade jam on top or some icing :) I rolled mine out onto a floured surface and used cookie cutters. Baked on greased cookie sheets at 350 for 12 minutes.

made these in a heart shape for valentines day for my husband but split into 4 and did almond with almonds and extract, and cherry, plain and raisin using vanilla big hit my husband did not eat them all so took to friends and now I have orders for them.  However be carefull with the raisin one as I think you need to soad them first as they kind of exploded in the oven but still tasted great

Great recipe.  Did not find them grainy.  Was very quick and we even took the time to roll them.  Was concerned for taste as I used unsalted butter but were still very good.

This recipe was really yummy (I'm eating a cookie right now)... I cut it in half, and did not have a jelly roll pan so I just sprayed a baking pan and rolled them into balls and then squished them down... it made ~ 2 dozen cookies and I cooked it for 17 minutes (tried 12 at first, had to cook longer)... It was easy and I was glad I didn't totally mess it up by changing it, I'm a pretty amateur baker.

These are amazing.  My butter was nearly melted by the time I creamed it with the sugar and the sugar completely dissolved-- no sandy texture like I read on other reviews.  They are light and almost crispy but seem to hold together very well.  I just can't get over how many calories are in them!!  I'll have to give some away or I'll be in real trouble!

This dough handled nicely without having to be chilled. It made a crisp tender cookie. I did only bake for about 24 minutes to prevent over browning them.

Excellent! Easy to make. I rolled it up into a log, then rolled in a course Demerara sugar. Cut them into 1/4 inch thick slices, cooked for 9 minutes. The whole family loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried many different shortbread recipes, some from this site, and some that were suggested by friends - none turned out quite as well as this one! This was so so SO easy to make - I rolled out the dough and used cookie cutters and they turned out perfectly! I did add a touch of vanilla, and baked them for 8-10 minutes depending on how thick the cut outs were, and they were by far the best shortbread cookies I've ever made.   Thank you for sharing this really easy, delicious recipe!

Sometimes you just can't beat Walkers Shortbread.  I didn't find this recipe that fantastic.  I added a little almond extract and rolled them out into cookies.  Not sure what went wrong.

This is a tasty recipe in general-buttery and nice texture-but I thought it was a just a little bit "floury". I added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, but I don't think that it contributed much to the taste. Needed about 15 minutes longer to bake than listed, and I halved the recipe and made it in an 8-inch square pan.

Wonderful recipe. I made it earlier this evening and was very pleased. Tastes just like my grandmother's shortbread! I changed it a bit to my taste, using a half cup more of sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla, and had to add about 20 minutes to the baking time. I used a square baking dish instead of a jelly roll pan and then carefully cut into squares when done. Delicious!

Daughter advised of last minute need for cookies; however, I had no eggs. I made 1/2 of this recipe (w/6 drops almond extract). We also scooped them off for circles. They came out beautifully. For her friends, we dusted them with cinnamon sugar and they devoured them! Thank you for this recipe.

Very simple and delicious. I had never made shortbread, and it wasn't something anyone in my family had a recipe for, but my friend begged me to make him some. The only mistake I made was making half a batch, and it disappeared in a flash. I had to hide my friend's share. I had to bake it a little longer than the recipe called for, but it was absolutely scrumptious.

I have been looking for a good recipe that I don't have to add eggs to, and this is it! They are so soft and yummy! I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Next time I might add 1/2 cup more of sugar, just because I love them a tad sweeter. AWESOME recipe! Will be making them again!

Love this recipe. I've made it tons of times, and if you keep the dough chilled it works well for cutout cookies too. These keep well for a long time in a sealed container, and freeze well. Very tender and buttery. Great recipe!

Great tasting cookies. The only thing that worried me after following the directions exactly was that the baked cookies lost some of their shape. I covered them with icing to hide the imperfections, but am hunting for a cookie recipe that maintains exact shape once baked. The taste was divine though.

I've never had better shortbread.  I love this tender, more buttery version, though I think it's even better with almond flavoring, 1/2-1 t., or to taste (the dough tastes great unbaked, so you can add a little to start with to get the amount you like).  A great gift, too.

Everyone always loves it when I make these cookies! they're always a big hit, and they get eaten very quickly. For 4 ingredients, it takes amazing!!!!!!!!! So simple! I baked the cookies in a pan once, but for the most part I just cut squares and put those on a baking sheet. I think they cook faster, and it's easier than scooping the whole pan out and putting them on a plate.

It's like easy "Spritz" if you add vanilla and almond flavoring.  Excellent, quick bake on a sheet cake pan...and you can pull it out half-way through baking and decoratively fork it to make it have the "shortbread holes".  Gets better with storage, like many butter-based cookies.

Turned out as stated. Very good tasting shortbread. I did add 1/2 tsp Vanilla. For a twist, I put raspberry jam in between 2 shortbread cookies to make a special treat. My boss ate them all in one day! Must have been good :)

I actually used 2 sticks of butter and 2 sticks of margarine and the flavor was perfect. I also omitted the cornstarch and added 1 tsp. vanilla. I cut mine into squares and baked on a cookie sheet as well. I didn't have cornstarch on hand and I only had 2 sticks of margarine/butter so I had to compromise but it is sooo dang delicious!

Love this recipe! The only change I made was to add about 1c. bacon crumbles. I drizzled them with maple glaze. They just melt in your mouth! Next time I will add something else like Earl Grey tea or sage. Thanks Mazie!

Outstanding recipe.  These were delicious.  I decided to make some because I was tired of buying cookies for my husband's coffee as he always wants a few shortbread cookies with it.  These are amazing.  I am sending them to work with him in the morning to share.  I did put them on a large cookie sheet and flattened them evenly with a roller then cut them when they came out of the oven.  They were perfect.  This is the very best recipe for both ease and taste!!

Perfect shortbread for my needs.  I was using the shortbread as a base for a homemade Twix experiment and the flavor and texture was just what I needed.  Will use this recipe for future baking experiments.  Thank you Mazie

Very easy and very delicious! I wanted to whip something quick together for dessert tonight.  I made just enough for a small plate of cookies, and they came out great!  Took about 30-40 minutes from start to finish but for a quick homemade treat, you can't beat it!  My husband also enjoyed them, so this is definitely going in my recipe box.

Very good! I'm not a huge fan of shortbread but my boyfriend is, and he loved these! I enjoyed them, too. I added a teaspoon of vanilla when I made it. They turned out crumbly and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

Amazing recipe...I used a cutter to make perfect rounds and when they first came out, I brushed the them with a mixture of light caro syrup 75% and hot water 25% and sprinkled with a little sugar.  I love them plain and sweet...thanks for the great recipe.  My partner is british and said they are the better than any he's ever had...including in England and Scotland

Very delicious and definitely heavenly.  I did do something a little different.  When I took out of the oven, I let it cool for about 5 minutes, then I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  I also used a pizza cutter to cut it in squares, way easier then a knife!

These shortbreads were definitely 'heavenly' but i do think finished cookie was a little tasteless and a bit crumbly. however, the cute yellow icing designs on the cookies lifted everyone's spirit and appetite!

I'd give it 10 stars if I could! Perfect buttery shortbread cookies!! I followed this recipe exactly and these are fantastic!!!! I have never made them before but these are fool proof. I rolled the dough (make sure you use plenty of flour on the rolling pin) and made cut out cookies!! So delicate and yummy!! Thanks for sharing- I will be the coolest mom on the block for making these for the kiddos ;)

The dough was delicious! I couldn't stop eating it, but sadly these didn't turn out for me, the baking time was WAAAY too long, they were dark brown after 20 minutes. I'm mad at myself because I thought the baking time was too long when I first put them in, I would've baked for 10 minutes and then checked them. Good flavor, too long baking time. Maybe I made them too thin. Oh well, maybe I'll try it again another time.

I did not care for this recipe!  The dough turned out too crumbly, more like corn meal in texture, and the cookies were so bland.  I even added some vanilla as other reviewers suggested, but they just taste like barely sweetened butterfat with a poor texture.  What a waste of time and ingredients.  I advise looking for another recipe...I sure am!

Oh wow!!!  I HATE shortbread.  I LOVE these cookies.  I discovered Hershey's Halloween Kisses.  They are candy corn-flavored (vanilla) and are most delicious!  I thought I'd experiment for a party and make kiss cookies.  I needed a plain butter recipe and chose this one due to its simplicity and rave reviews.  Well, add me to the list!  These turned out beautifully and are so yummy!  I need to control myself so there are a few left for Saturday night's event.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These are so easy to make and are really tasty! I thought that they were going to go wrong as I found it very hard to mix everything up evenly because the mixture was so crumbly. But it turned out fine in the end!

They were a great sucess with my family.

The cookies turned out okay but were more on the crispy/flakey side. Not as rich and smooth as I was expecting. Not sure if I would make it again.

I halved the recipe and came out with 30 cookies. Cooking time was around 20-25min. I also added chocolate chips!

Delicious and beautiful! Followed recipe with exception of adding 1/2 tsp of almond. Rolled out to make Thumbprint Cookies. (I used Raspberry jelly). Will definitely make these again.

Great tea/coffee biscuit! I made a batch w/ approx 1 tsp of peppermint extract and another w/ approx 1 tsp strawberry extract. Both flavors turned out delicious. The first batch I split and rolled half into a log, rolled it in colored sugar then put it in the freezer for about 20 min. Once I removed it from the freezer I sliced it  into 1/2" thick pieces to bake. The other half I prepared almost the same way except instead of the sugar  I worked mini colored balls into the dough. The second batch I balled, froze for about 20 min then rolled to 1/4" thickness and cut w/ mini cookie cutters. The cookies held their shape very well. YUM-O!!!

I have made these many times and people love them! I add a little vanilla extract and instead of rolling them in flour I roll them in powered sugar which adds more sweetness!

I roll these out to maybe 1/4" thickness and used cookie cutters. This takes a lot longer, but the result is a very delicate buttery cookie that just about melts in your mouth. They're good as-is, but since I cut them out, I usually frost them some of them and add sprinkles because the kids like them that way. One of my kids has an egg allergy, so this is a great recipe that the whole family can enjoy.

Really good recipe, I had to half it because we didn't have enough butter - but it's better than the shortbread we make at work. If I could give more stars, I would :) thanks!

I like this a lot!  I used the jelly roll pan and pressed sprinkles into the top before baking.  Mine cooked about 5 extra minutes, then I used a pizza cutter to cut it into squares as soon as it was out of the oven. I'm not sure if I was supposed to wait for them to cool before I removed them from the pan, but I took them out immediately.  They're great on their own, but I'm looking forward to trying them with a glaze, lemon zest , etc.

I cut the recipe in 1/2. Added about a tsp of Madagascar Bourbon vanilla. I used wax paper and rolled the dough in jimmies (sprinkles), put in the freezer about 30 mins. I cut 1/2" slices then baked. Came out great.

Added 1.5 tsp. vanilla, 2 Tbl. powdered sugar and 1 cup Heath toffee bits.  Rolled into logs and refrigerated until firm.  Sliced into 1/4 inch cookies and baked at 350* for 13 mins.

LOVED the buttery of the lightly browned edges and the toffee.  A keeper!

this is an easy recipe and has decent taste.  I would add a little vanilla or almond extract to it next time.  I used the jelly-roll pan and scored the cookies when done, but I found this resulted in too thick a cookie.  next time I will try rolling them and using cutters.

Awesome shortbread recipe.  I've made it 3x this week because it keeps being eaten fast and furiously, as soon as it appears.  I took it to work twice and it disappeared just as fast there.  Everyone wants the recipe.

these are amazing! 1 word of caution though; I used a heart-shaped cutout about an inch by 2, and ended up with almost 200 little cookies!

12.20.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10273/heavenly-shortbread/ ... I use 4 1/2c flour instead of adding cornstarch. Prick with a fork all over then bake mine ten minutes at 350, then forty at 300.  Wait two minutes, then score.  Putting a little colored sugar on top before baking is pretty.  I've tried many recipes.  This simple one is the best.  Also good with one half dipped in dark chocolate!

Great recipe!  It comes together - unlike several other shortbread recipes I have tried that just crumble apart.  Yay!

The dough was too runny. I added extra flour and sugar, but it still was the consistency of... well... something runny. I baked it anyway, and the cookies melted into a puddle, but otherwise tasted okay. I put ground cardamon, which helped the flavour. This is for a cookie competition, and the judges would laugh if I submitted these sad cookies, so I think I will need to try again with a better recipe tomorrow. I definitely have made better shortbread with other recipes.

Amazing recipe. Made them with my daughter who is a novice and they were perfect. Put the second batch in the fridge just to firm up a bit before rolling and cutting out shapes.

Made this for a strawberry pizza, everyone loved it! I added a half teaspoon of vanilla and half teaspoon of almond extract. I used the leftover dough to make thumbprint jam cookies. Definitely will make this again!

These are pretty good little cookies, but I'm glad I read the other reviews and added some vanilla - they needed the flavor boost.  I used these with a cheesecake dip, and they were perfect.  They would have been a bit bland on their own, even with the added vanilla.

Absolutely delicious and very easy.  I rolled mine into flattened balls instead of rolling them out which was much faster and they turned out nicely.  I also pushed pecan halves on the top for decoration.

EXCELLENT!!  Was curious about why the recipe called for corn starch. Almost didn't try this recipe.  Glad I did.  It is melt in your mouth good!  I took another reviewers suggestion and added a touch of almond extract and then sprinkled with green and red decorating sugars.  A great additon to the cookie plate this Christmas.  And don't forget the Hot Cocoa.

Great recipe.  I let the Kitchenaide really go to town on all the ingredients and it was very easy to work with the dough afterwards.  I drizzled some melted chocolate over the bars when they cooled down.  This recipe makes a LOT of cookies, but they were gone by the end of the next day - and we aren't a big family!  Thanks for sharing this one!

This is exceptionally buttery and absolutely amazing.  It would be perfect with the addition of large granulated sugar on top for that extra crunch.

This shortbread is great! The only thing wrong with it is that it came out kind of cakey. But the taste was delicious. It goes great with tea. I made it in a 13 x 9 inch pan, but I would reccomend cutting cookies instead. They would be awesome!

This was good.  My first time making shortbread.  I used margarine as I didn't have butter.  I also added about a tsp of vanilla.  They came out pretty good.  Seemed a little thick in a 15 X 11 jelly roll pan.  The middle didn't get as crispy as i'd have liked but the edges did.  May try the cookie scoop and pressing them out with the bottom of a cup next time.  I added colorful sprinkles before I baked them, and drizzled with a little melted dark chocolate after they cooled.  It made them even better!

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time, my husband told me to go back in the kitchen and keep making them. HA!  I did add 1/4 cup sugar to the recipe which suited our sweet tooth a little more, but the cookies themselves are fabulous!

I don't know what these negative reviews are all about. If you made the recipe the correct way, both the flavor and texture should be incredible. I accidentally made bricks (didn't plan on making the bars so thick) but people ate those up before the cut-outs were gone. This is going in my recipe box.

I think next time I make these cookies, I'll try to use just a bit less butter.  Perhaps I could add applesauce to make up the liquid difference to help control those evil calories.  The cookies were delicious though!

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. It was very floury - and tasted nothing like the cookies my grandma made when I was a kid. I'm going to get her recipe and post it - these cookies definately need icing.
