The absolute best scone recipe I have ever used. Only suggestion would be to be sure to combine the yogurt, egg, and vanilla before adding it to the flour/butter mixture. Excellent recipe!

As is, the recipe is good and moist.  Just know that it is a basic scone recipe and can have many things added to it for variety: chocolate chips, cranberries, blueberries, apples, oats, etc.  If you have a sweet tooth, you'll have to add sugar or honey...but know that most scones aren't supposed to be super sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love these scones their nice and moist alot better than other recipes that I have tried that have turned out like rocks.  I have used this recipe for years and have used different things in them to change it up.  My husbands favorite is mini chocolate chips added to the batter.  I also like to use currants or craisins.  The batter is a little sticky but I use a scone pan which really works well just pusing the batter down into the slots.  If you don't have a scone pan just use a simple ice cream scoop and flatten them a bit on some parchment paper quick and easy!

Used a food processor for a cranberry/white choc. chip version, and it saved so much time! Just mix dry ingredients, sugar (1/4 c.) and frozen butter (cut in pieces) in processor, process it a few seconds until well blended, add wet ingredients and pulse it until well blended, add Craisins (1/2 c.) & white choc. chips (1/2 c.), pulse. Take the batter out, pat it flat with some flour and cut your scones. Follow remaining directions as indicated.

This is a good recipe. The scones are indeed light and fluffy, however not enough sugar per my taste. I added 4 table spoons of sugar to the flower mix and they turned out perfect.

My husband and I love this recipe for scones! Every so often, I will jump out of bed on Saturday or Sunday morning and say, ''let's have scones for breakfast'' . . .30 minutes later delicious homemade scones are being served! On those occasions when we have company staying over, I have pre-made the dough for the scones, put it the freezer and then defrosted it in the refrigerator overnight, and lastly put the scones in the oven just after everyone is awake. Delicious, effortless and very popular with our guests!

This has to be the Best Scone recipe ever. I have tried alot through the years but this one was ever so moist and my family couldn't get enough.  I read all the reviews and my thought was you could get a differant flavor by just switching the yogurt flavor, They freeze well also.

These were delish! The only thing I did was add 1/4 cup of sugar to the mix. Also added a drizzle of glaze, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. Yummo! Light, fluffy and they rose very high. Great recipe!

I was not expecting such a soft scone, but it is good. More like a biscuit. I will next time add at least 1/2 cup of sugar, and maybe make a glaze. I was expecting a somewhat sweeter scone than what came out. Just know this is not sweet at all. I'm used to scones bought in coffee shops. This wasn't like that.

I really liked this recipe alot! I've never had scones before so I don't know what they are supposed to taste like, but I expected them to be sweeter, but these were still really good, almost like a light fluffy biscuit! I think that these would be wonderful paired with a glaze and dipped like cinnamon sticks, which is how I will serve them for breakfast, but they would also be really good brushed with butter instead of milk, and sprinkled with some parmasean cheese instead of sugar. All in all these are really good. To make them more fun for the kids, I used cookie cutters dipped in flour instead of cutting them into triangles, the butterflies and stars were fun shapes for the kids, and they baked up just fine.

Delicious!  I added a bit of sugar since we have a serious sweet tooth in this household.   I found that I needed to bake at least 10 minutes longer for these to be baked completely.

I used peach yogurt and added about a quarter cup of craisins.  I thought they were really good.  I did have to cook mine a bit longer since they were pretty thick.

Pretty good, but more cakey than sconey. I added three tblsp sugar.
I also dump all of the dough into a pie plate, shape it into that form and then turn it over onto parchment (less messy)

Really great recipe! For those wanting a sweet breakfast treat, add some brown sugar. The recipe as stated makes a wonderful savory scone that can be served as a side dish for dinner.

These are the BEST scones I have ever tasted and made. Easy recipe! Needs a bit of sugar though if you are going for a sweet scone. I was expecting sweet with this exact recipe but found they were more savory. Still delicious though!!!!

Wonderful recipe, simple and elegant.  I love being able to use yogurt! Genius!    Changes I made for a fruit scone:  +I reconstituted 3/4 dried tart cherries and 1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped the apricots and put the fruit into the dough while I was kneading it.   +Almost (not quite) a 1/4 of sugar to the dry ingredients. +Less than an 1/8 tsp of Almond extract. Because of the changes they needed a bit more flour while kneading and had to cook about 5 min longer.  Then I turned off the oven and left them in to brown just a touch.  I will make these at least once a week.  Lovely!!

This one is definitely going in my recipe box!  It is a great base to go either sweet or savory. The recipe is not too difficult or time consuming. They are wonderfully light and airy. I can't wait to try the savory version!

Wonderful recipe for basic scones.  I used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour and it worked great!  I also added chocolate chips and marshmallows, they were yummy!

Amazing!! Light, fluffy, sweet, and buttery! My co-workers loved them and 3 people asked me for the recipe!!! I've actually never been a fan of scones before, but thanks to this recipe I love them and can't wait to serve them to guests :)

Amazing!  Very easy and quick in the food processor.  Ran out of vanilla yogurt, so used some lemon yogurt to supplement.  Paired very nicely with the cranberries I added.

As described, I think it's 4 stars, but it could easily be 5.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I mixed 1/2 tsp of cinnamon into the dough and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar instead of just sugar.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and just used an ice cream scoop for the dough (I dipped the scoop in sugar) and put the dollops on parchment paper and just patted them down lightly.  Dough was easy to work with.  Consistency of finished scones was fantastic and I loved that they used yogurt instead of cream.  I just didn't think the dough was quite sweet enough so I might add a bit more sugar and/or cinnamon next time.

great texture but i found it needed sugar.  perhaps it was the hippie yogurt i used but i think 1/4c to 1/2c cup sugar would perfect this recipe.  I added 1/4c raspberries and 1/4c blueberries.  good stuff.

Made these early this AM due to insomnia! My husband loves scones and I'm a novice scone-maker, this being my first try; so I don't know if scone dough is always this sticky and difficult to work with.  After working it for awhile, I ended up pulsing it in the food processor to get it to come together. I also added 1c frozen blueberries.  They came out tasting pretty good.  Both DH & I thought they could have a little bit more flavor though, maybe because I used unsalted butter. Thank you for sharing your recipe, Stephanie.

Delicious. I made them once with grated Meyer lemon peel and a little bit of lemon juice and once I used an all-purpose flour-whole wheat flour-wheat bran mix, added currants and also some lemon peel and juice. Both versions were delicious. Both times I used plain whole milk yoghurt and added just a little bit of sugar to it. The bran-version had a bit more texture and was somewhat crunchier, really nice!

I make this all the time - it's the only scone recipe I use. I feel like scones can tend to be heavy and dry but this recipe makes really light, fluffy scones.  I often add a few handfuls of chocolate chips and also make two rounds instead of one, and then make 16 mini scones out of it. GREAT recipe.

These were good but were not like a scone...more cakey but good. Definitely add sugar to the dough.  These are not sweet at all except for the sprinkle of sugar on top. I added orange flavored cranberries.

Great recipe! I like to add some scraped vanilla bean for extra vanilla yumminess! Making it in a pie plate works very well, as another reviewer suggested.

Honestly the best scones I have ever tasted.  We made them with strawberry yogurt.  Delicious.  They are very moist and just sweet enough. I would highly recommend these.  They are easy to make too.  My 5 year old daughter had a blast baking them with me.

True to their name!  Honestly, I added about 500lbs of sugar and an entire bag of mini-chocolate chips (my partner is a sweet tooth if there ever was one!). Also this is only my second time making scones, and I was worried I'd screw it up, but they were feather- light!!!!

Fantastic.  I used a food processor to make mine.  The only trouble I had was I had to bake them for 20 minutes (I covered them with foil after 15).  Will definitely be making these again!

AHHH so amazing!  I have been trying to find a scone recipe that wasn't super dry and viola! Here it is!  I used Greek yogurt and added extra vanilla extract along with almond extract.  The end result is fantastically fluffy and fragrant.

Loved them, although I added some splenda and used blueberry yogurt and added dried blueberries. Also added icing once they were cool. Have a bit of a sweet tooth, but loved the texture. Very light

Buttery and biscuity, these were delicious scones. They are not the cake-like scones you find at most coffee shops, but that's what we liked about them.  With plain yogurt and a little less sugar, these make a great base for both sweet and savory toppings.   We'll definitely make them again.

Oh my!  I just made these for a Breakfast with Santa.  It isa good thing that I am on a strict diet because these look and smell so delicious!  I was worried that they would be hard, but they look and feel so moist!  I stuck straight to the recipe except I added about 1/4 C. mini chocolate chips.  I am going to make another batch tonight with craisins and orange juice with a orange juice/confectioners sugar icing.    I sliced up the butter into the flour and then used a pastry blender to get it to the crumb consistency.  It is a little bit of work, but all worth it.  Can't wait to make these when I can actually eat them!  ;-)  The only reason I didn't give this a 5 stars is because I haven't actually tried them yet.

Turned out more like biscuit in the middle than scone. The dough turned out to be much thicker than I expected, I could have halved the recipe and cut it into 1/8ths and it would have been better. Maybe I kneaded it too much. I'll try again. Next time, I'll add a little more sugar and cinnamon in the batter next time.

Very yummy! I halved the recipe, and just shaped the dough into six balls instead of rolling and cutting. I also used 1/4 cup of sugar and twice the vanilla, as I only had plain yogurt. Very simple and easy recipe, although the dough was quite difficult to work with.

These were great!  I added dried cranberries to half of the batch for my husband and left the plain ones for the kids.  They froze great and, when warmed up, are a perfect treat w/honey or cinnamon sugar as suggested.  Thanks for the recipe.
