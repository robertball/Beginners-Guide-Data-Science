What a great recipe. I use regular bacon because I like it more. I use panko bread crumbs because I don't have to have a loaf of bread hanging around. I dice onions and peppers saute' them with minced garlic. I don't use as much garlic powder maybe half or less than what is called for. For cheese I'll use whatever I have on hand. The sauce is great and I add a squirt of sirracha. I also broil it for the last 5 minutes just to crust it all up. Great flexible recipe. My wife loves it and I do too.

This is the meatloaf for people that usually don't prefer it. My husband and young kids are the pickiest eaters, I am always trying new and different recipes and this was an absolute hit! It tastes just like a cheeseburger, yum. The only thing I changed was using a tsp of onion powder in place of diced onion. I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic recipe! I plan to make this regularly and I will add more turkey bacon because I love what it brings to the dish! Sauce is perfect, and I never eat mustard.

This was delicious. Oddly, I made it again with ground beef, which we love, and it was not as tasty. Something about the ground turkey brings out all the other favors. Try several small meatloaves in a muffin tin for single servings that only take about 20 minutes to cook!

Delicious!  I added crispy onion straws mixed with some cheddar cheese the last 10 minutes! Make sure you let this 'set' for about 10 minutes before slicing.

I've been slim-ifying many of our recipes, but I couldn't think of a clever way to make meatloaf.  This is a very clever way.  The seasonings do help to mask the bland turkey and lack of fat...as does the turkey bacon.  My husband is nuts about it and I think it's alright.  He begs me for it.  So weird.  LOL

I made this for my husband and me last night and while I didn't make it the prettiest in the world, and I left the onions out, he said it was one of the best things I've cooked yet. - we've only been married for 3 months, but that's a feat!  Thanks for the recipe!

This yummy meatloaf is a definite home-run! I used organic ground beef, (because the beastly grocery store was out of ground turkey, yet again), regular ole pork bacon, and It. breadcrumbs. Otherwise, I followed this recipe to the letter. Next time, I think I'll add some more cheese and saute the onions. Very good, very creative recipe. Thanks!

Also, you can make this recipe entirely versatile to what you like on your cheeseburger: Mushroom Swiss burger? Add swiss cheese instead of cheddar, saute mushrooms and either chop them up and put them in the meatloaf, or serve hot on top. My point: use any cheese, any condiments, anything you want. I might swap out the barbecue sauce for ketchup and b. sugar next time, but who knows. :)

I have made this recipe twice and it is a family favorite!  The kids ask for the leftovers for breakfast!  I serve it with sides of potato cakes and green beans. I changed it a bit for my family's taste preferences.  I reduced the amount of Worcestershire to 1 tsp, garlic powder down to 1/2 tsp, a pinch of pepper, and only 1/2 C cheese.  I added 1 T low sodium soy sauce.  For convenience, I cooked the turkey bacon in the microwave on paper towels and omitted the cooking oil.  Next time, I plan to make extra sauce.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! I substituted the French bread for 1 cup of bread crumbs. The first time I made this, I used the amount of garlic powder the recipe calls for & found it had a very strong garlic flavor. Next time I make this, I will only use 1 teaspoon of garlic powder instead of 2. :)

I make an amazing meat loaf but I had some ground turkey and so I decided to give this a try.  Well, it was nowhere near as good as my regular meatloaf but considering this is a turkey meatloaf it is quite good.  I think the cheese and bacon help prevent it from being dry and help with flavor.  The sauce on top is really good.

Really good turkey meatloaf recipe.  I used beef bacon, omitted the bread and used a little coconut flour to make it more "primal" because my husband doesn't eat grains, and omitted the brown sugar from the sauce recipe.  The sauce was really good without the added sugar.  We loved this meatloaf; and I will be making it again!  Thanks so much!

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I have never made meatloaf, but I was really impressed with the outcome of this recipe.  I used panko bread crumbs (as someone else suggested) in lieu of the french bread and regular bacon instead of turkey bacon because that is what I had on hand.

I just made this tonight and it was perfection!  I added petite diced bell pepper and diced onion to the Farmland pork bacon(the one bacon I can eat that doesn't make me ill due to allergies) just before it was done cooking on the stove. After draining, I mixed it all together and baked it without the topping for 30 minutes. After that time, I took it out of the oven, put on the topping and returned it to the oven for 30 more minutes.  I used my NutriBullet to make the topping and added some fresh bell pepper-a 1" long wedge to add flavor to the ketchup, coarse ground brown mustard, brown sugar mixture.  I prefer the taste of brown mustard as opposed the the plain yellow mustard.  My husband ate 2 extra large pieces of this meatloaf and said that this was a "Keeper" recipe.  I also didn't have french bread, so I just used 3 slices of honey wheat bread whirled in the food processor to make the soft bread crumb.  I retyped this recipe with all of my tweeks and made copies for family relatives!  This is my new go to meatloaf recipe.  I give it 6 stars...5 doesn't do it justice!

Pretty tasty indeed!  I did make some substitutions and will be fine tuning it more again:
1. I used the splenda brown sugar mix to reduce calories further (Based on splenda recco for their product I halved how much I added and will reduce more because I thought the topping sauce was still a tad too sweet, maybe add a bit of cider vinegar next time to give a bit more tang to it).
2.  I used Low Calorie Tex Mex cheese.
3.  I used the precooked low sodium bacon.

My partner in crime devoured it in a pinch and insists I make this again in the very near future.

This was a great recipe - I followed exactly, but added extra onion.  I was surprise how simple this recipe was, but how great it tasted.  I think next time I may add a medium white cheese and jalapenos to spice it up.  The sauce was really good also.  My husband, who is not a meatloaf lover said it was okay, which is an improvement from other recipes since he doesn't typically enjoy this type of food.

Excellent, easy to make and tastes great!  I did use an entire package of turkey bacon (because we love it!) and topped individual pieces with extra cheddar.

I want to use more ground turkey, but I struggle to find recipes using turkey that aren't bland and tasteless. This is an exception! Yay! I love meatloaf, I consider it one of the key comfort foods, and was worried for nothing...this is a hearty, tasty, satisfying meatloaf, and this recipe is going in my "keeper" file. Thank you for this recipe!

Awesome smoky flavor and very moist. I used Hormel real bacon bits and Italian breadcrumbs. I will make this again.

Great recipe, and much less grease than a ground beef meatloaf. My extremely picky 4 year old who eats no meat LOVED it, as did my hubs and myself. Will def. keep this in my repertoire for ground turkey meal ideas. Also, I added a bit more brown sugar & a bit more ketchup. Delish!

This was awesome!  Even my 5 year old loved it!  I would make a little more of the sauce that goes on top though.

This was very yummy and easy. I was able to make it with all ingredients I had on hand. The only change I will make next time is possibly going with out the glaze. It was yummy, but very sweet. My hubby is not a fan of sugary meats. All in all, it's still a keeper recipe!

Terrific flavor!  Mixed the ketchup, mustard & brown sugar right into the loaf instead of using as a glaze.   Made it moist & just perfect.   A delicious, healthy twist on meatloaf.

This is our go to turkey meatloaf recipe. Sometimes I soak the bread in a little milk for more moisture. For topping we like 1/2 and 1/2 ketchup and bbq sauce mix. Loaf will be very sloppy and moist to form, but this means it will come out perfect.

This was great! Super moist and delicious. I used the heel of a loaf of wheat bread, and added some bread crumbs to fill in a bit. I also used 1tbsp yellow mustard, as well as 1tbsp spicy brown mustard. I was out of garlic powder so I used 2 cloves of garlic. I also didn't have any turkey bacon so I used about a half cup of Hormel real bacon bits. One thing I want to try for next time is adding a 1/4 cup of chopped dill pickles, just to give it a more hamburger-y flavor.

Loved it. I used regular bacon and a bit less since I only had 4 slices left. I didn't use the glaze and instead used open pit sweet style bbq sauce. It was a hit. Thanks for the recipe! I really think I'll make it this way everytime. That's saying a lot from someone who is always searching for better recipes.

Not bad but not great either.  Tasted nothing like a cheeseburger    Made it with my gf. Her son didn't like it at all but her and I ate ours. I think it was a bit bland once you got past the sauce that was on top. The sauce however was great.  Maybe if you used beef that's lean in place of turkey and add a lit more seasoning

My family, which includes young kids and friends love the flavor of this recipe. However, I use turkey bacon, omit the bread and onions (food intolerances), and the sauce on top to reduce sugar. I do add the mustard into the meat. I appreciate a flexible recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Great! I added extra garlic salt because I used low sodium turkey beacon. Excellent. I will make this again. The house smelt so good cooking the beacon! Update- this is in my regular dinner rotation. I often make with no bacon, no salt (my husband says to salty) and today I used bbq sauce as the topping. It is always so good! Love, love, this recipe!

This was fan-f'in-tastic recipe! I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will try with bbq sauce. I paired this with some simple microwave steamed veggies. Great healthy alternative to my childhood favorite of meatloaf and mashed potatoes and gravy!

I tried this last night! It was soo yummy! I only had whole grain dijon mustard for the sauce but it was amazing. I also didn't have  Worcestershire on hand, so i replaced it with sweet baby rays bbq sauce. I did shred about a 1/4 cup of zuccini in the mix and added fried onions on top for the last 15 minutes. It was so good and i'm looking forward to lunch today to go eat left overs. My husband loved it too!!

Super tasty dish. I was leary about cooking with turkey bacon but have made two dishes in the last week with it and was very pleased. My 5 year old ate every bite. She usually will not eat anything with onions. Enjoy!

Yummy!  I used canned bread crumbs and pre-packaged bacon pieces instead of french bread and turkey bacon because I had them on hand.  I can't imagine my changes made mine too different from the original, and I found it flavorful and tasty.  Thanks for a fun way to make ground turkey!

Hubby and I are divided on this so that is the reason for the 3 star rating. I like this healthier version of meatloaf but he prefers others.

My old turkey meatloaf recipe was OK, but typically was a little on the dry side.  This came out wonderfully moist and full of flavor!  My family devoured this and the leftovers are already gone by lunch the next day.  The basic ketchup/mustard/brown sugar topping was surprisingly good.  Like others, I subbed out about 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs for the bread and it worked just fine.  I will certainly be making this over and over!  Thank you!

I'm usually not a fan of meatloaf, in fact I avoid it, but my incredibly picky husband came home with the recipe one day so I decided to try it. I was surprised that I actually really liked it. Better than any meatloaf that I've had before. I think it tastes best with ground turkey, but I also used ground pork once.

I really didn't know what to expect with this since I have never really cooked with ground turkey, but it was delicious! The addition of the turkey bacon inside was perfect! Only sub I made was adding some chili-garlic sauce to the glaze that coats the top because we like a little heat. 10/10 would make this again! Pairs well with the Daddy's Fried Corn and Onions recipe on this site.

Just made this for tonight and I must say that it tasted better than I thought. Im not a meatloaf eater so for me to say it was good, it was good. Even my boys wanted some (to my surprise) and they said it was really good.

I've make this almost weekly since I ran into this recipe. It's very good as written, the only things I change are to increase the amounts on some ingredients to give it more flavor..add a full onion instead of 1/2, a little bit more cheese, and double the sauce for the top.  This is so yummy!  Try it!

I used Prociutto because I had it on hand, and I sautéed it with onion and garlic before adding to the turkey. I also chopped up fresh spinach to mix in. I used less cheese than it called for, but the whole thing was delicious.

So fun and different! Although I doubled the batch and added an extra egg and 1 cup minute rice for a better binder. Also added finely chopped bell pepper. Either way this is a keeper?

I didn't add the bacon and I used  breads crumbs from a can instead of making them from french bread.  This was spectacular both times I made it.  Moist, flavorful, the cheese adds some great surprise flavor and the ketchup/mustard topping really makes me feel like I'm eating a hamburger.

A favorite recipe.  I have made it 3 times recently. I used gr turkey twice and gr beef once.  I prefer the turkey, my husband prefers beef. This recipe spices up turkey well.  To save time I use packaged bacon in place of turkey bacon.

Top favorite meatloaf in our house!  Also, a favorite "leftover" meal--if there is any left over, that is!  I don't alter this recipe at all.  Make it as written, then decide.  Yum. 
Thanks for posting this one, Laura--it's GREAT!

This was a very tasty way to cut down on beef consumption. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I used pork bacon, not turkey, because that was what was on hand. It was a bit dry, but that is the nature of ground turkey. It got a thumbs up from everyone at the table and I will definitely make it again.

My family normally does not like meatloaf. Seeing the bacon in this recipe, I decided to try it. Everyone thought it was great! I used regular bacon and fresh minced garlic.

My family's new favorite meatloaf! I am always looking for ways to use ground turkey. This meatloaf was fantastic! Only one thing I will change for next time - maybe using a bit less shredded cheese. Thanks for a great recipe!

Super supper menu.I left off the bacon to reduce meat fat but the meal was still extremely flavorful. This is definably a recipe to try. You're family will love it. Mine sure did!

It was a waste of rather expensive ingredients (ground turkey and turkey bacon). It's not good at all. My kids hated it and I had a difficult time eating it myself.  I made it exactly as the recipe said to make it, plus two extra strips of turkey bacon.  The ketchup/mustard mixture is just nasty! What was I thinking making this????

This was super easy and delicious. I actually just realized that I completely forgot the Worcestershire sauce but it still turned out great and really flavorful. A perfect meatloaf for those who don't like the usual kind!

This was AMAZING! Making it again tonight! I added some Frank's RedHot sauce to the sauce that goes on the top to give it just a hint of heat and my husband and I LOVED it SO MUCH that I have sent the recipe to 6 people already including a guy that was a cashier at the grocery store! I HIGHLY recommend this!

This was AWESOME! Followed this pretty closely except I added some sriracha to the sauce and used about 1/3 cup of regular breadcrumbs. My husband said this was the best meatloaf he's ever had. We will be making this again for sure. We served it with baked potatoes and zucchini.

Super good! I did alter a bit.... I used 1b of turkey and lb of pork sausage with bacon (so I could double it), regular pork bacon, and bread crumbs instead of the bread other than that I kept it the same. Smells so great in the oven and the sauce DOES make a difference. We loved it and are glad we have leftovers!!!!!

This is a very tasty meat loaf.  I used maple flavored bacon  because that's what was in the house, and it tasted  great. I also used panko bread crumbs instead of the bread.  The sauce on top was great.

This was okay.  I made as written, using regular bacon as that is what I had on hand.  Although the taste was good I really didn't taste the bacon nor the cheese ... so why add the extra calories if it can't be tasted?  But again, it was good so thats why 4 stars, but I probably won't make again.  Well, except for the topping which was DELICIOUS ... I'll be making that again for sure!

It was okay, nothing too exciting. I had to cook it about an hour and fifteen minutes to get it up to temperature.  Just not a keeper for me.

Sauce is definitely key.  We used Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey with regular bacon.  Also used bread crumbs instead of French Bread.  Great flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

So this is a wonderful recipe but I made a few changes.First,I didnt see the need for french bread so like another reviewer I used plain panko bread crumbs instead.Also used sharp cheddar cheese in it and added a couple pinches of A1 sauce.Instead of plain old ketchup I decided to spice it up a bit and use Heinz jalapeno ketchup and instead of plain old mustard used Hickory farms sweet hot mustard.I also made a whole package of bacon and put the leftover slices across the top,they melted into the sauce perfectly( not literally)Gave it an amazing kick!! not too much just enough.I thought it was amazing,and there wasn't a bite left!

First bite: "this is boring". Sorry.  I'm not really a meatloaf person, but wanted to try something different to change things up a bit for dinner.  This recipe seemed benign, and well, it was.  I don't know what would make this taste better or interesting. But like I said, I'm not a meatloaf person, so there you are.

I used crushed potato chips instead of bread crumbs to make it gluten free. I loved the mustard, but my kids prefer it topped with barbecue sauce. It was a winner!

I added 1/4 cup of Sriracha Ketchup to the meatloaf mixture for moistness, as well as a dash of Adobo and 1/2 tsp Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning to enhance the flavor ...also opted to use equal parts ketchup and sweet mustard with brown sugar for the glaze...no extra brown sugar was needed...It was wonderful

I'm not the greatest cook and it was foolproof for me! I didn't have all the ingredients. And I needed to double the recipe bc I had 2 lbs of meat, not one. I didn't double the worcestershire (sodium) and I didn't have enough ketchup to double the glaze. I added bread crumbs - probably 3/4 c. I added 2 eggs. Sauteed the onions first. and maybe 1 1/2 c. cheese. The rest of the ingredients I followed as per recipe amounts. I glazed the loaf before I laid the bacon on top (instead of frying and adding to meat) bc I had to save time (I take too long to cook!) Kids loved it better than my regular beef/pork meatloaf! Thank you!

Really delicious! I made it for me and my roommate last night. She loved it enough to have a second piece! Next time I will definitely cut down on the amount of onion or increase the amount of ground turkey. A little bit too much onion IMO. But amazing and awesome otherwise! :D

I'm sorry to say this was a bomb in our family. The  meatloaf turned out nice and firm, which was a plus. But the turkey bacon and cheese combination really put us off. My kids turned up their noses at the sauce mixture, so we used our favorite BBQ sauce instead. (We generally use that for our beef meatloaf.) 

We'll likely use the base recipe and play around with it.

Very tasty! And the turkey bacon was not overpowering in the quantities listed in the recipe. The only possible improvement for my own tastes is I would probably partly sauté them before mixing them in to the ground turkey. They had a little firmness in them and I would prefer them a bit softer. Very good flavor though! Definitely going to make it again.

Turned out awesome, the whole family loved it, including our 15 month old! The turkey is very flavorful, it doesn't taste at all like boring ground turkey. I used 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs because I didn't have the bread and it turned out great. It will be added to our regular repertoire.

We cannot stand meatloaf, but this is not your typical meatloaf. Definitely tastes like a bacon cheeseburger. The sauce on top had a little too much mustard for us, but that's just a personal preference. Husband said to add it to the rotation.

This meatloaf was very tasty!! I did substitute ground chicken instead of turkey, didn't bother with the bacon and used bread crumbs instead of the French bread. Also I didn't use 2 tap of garlic powder. I used 1 tsp. Also used steak sauce instead of Worcester sauce. All a matter of personal taste really. Loved the sharp cheddar cheese in it. Will most definitely make again

Loved it very flavorful, I usually mix it up a few hours before baking, so flavors blend well, I also used regular bacon, and plain bread crumbs (2 tbsps full) instead of bread.

My husband and I like really spicy food, so I made a few changes. Instead of the turkey bacon, I sauteed and crumbled spicy Italian sausage; instead of plain mustard, I used dijon mustard and added hot and spicy ketchup instead of regular ketchup. I also added the mustard and ketchup to the mixture instead of spreading it over the top of the meatloaf, thereby omitting the brown sugar. The result was excellent!

Great! Was super easy and definitely a crowd pleaser. Even my picky eater brother said it was great. Will definitely make again.
Only changes I'd make are adding more bacon and cheddar cheese.

This was EXCELLENT! I did saute the onions with some fresh garlic (3 cloves) and then only added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and I added a tbsp of Frank's red hot. I also substituted a little over 1/2 cup panko for the bread...this is my new favorite meatloaf, for sure! Hubby loved it, and toddler ate some (which is good for him ;)

The turkey bacon wasn't a hit in it so maybe trying regular bacon with the ground turkey and adding some seasoning for next time.  I like the idea of the flavors it just didn't come off like we had hoped.

The family loved it. I had to use Italian breadcrumbs and pork bacon because that's what I had. I doubled the recipe and cooked for and a little over an hour in a loaf pan.  It had a lot of flavor and very moist. I'm not crazy about meatloaf but this one is outstanding.   Will make again!

Hi, everyone. I made this recipe last night for dinner and I thought it was ok. When I make it again I will make two small alterations. First, I would cut back a little on the Worcestershire sauce, as I thought it was a little overpowering. Second, I wouldn't add the crumbled bacon to the meatloaf mixture before cooking. It gave the meatloaf a weird texture that I didn't really like and I lost all the flavor of the bacon. I would recommend chopping the bacon and sprinkling it on the top of the meatloaf after it's finished cooking. I think that would give it more of a bacon cheeseburger flavor and texture.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe! I try to stay away from red meat as much as possible, not used to ground turkey (it gets dry quickly after baking/cooking). I add sautéed onions, peppers, and mushrooms to my recipe for added flavor. I also add about a teaspoon of no salt blend seasoning (Mrs Dash) and add a tad more cheese on the top (under the bacon). My boyfriend and family beg me to make this often! Must try!

Let me just start by saying my mother, who has had five strokes, upset me by throwing in the meatloaf, we had began to prep before I had to run some errands during the day, so when I came back to a crumbled, overcooked mess I was angry. However, it still turned out to be an incredible dish!!! Yes, we had it without the Worcester sauce, one of my errands, but it was still  very delicious. That drizzle for the top, we agree is very good we made double because my mom had dried out some of the meat when she overcooked it, but yeah still it was very tasty and the extra sauce restored all the flavors when I heated it up. It's a great dish and I can't wait to try it one day when I'm home and have all the ingredients to finish making it the correct way. I did make one change, I used regular bacon, and we use ready cook bacon so it was easy. I crushed it up really well due to some dental challenges and everyone was happy. Oh and I didn't have french bread so I used 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs.  Honestly, I was fuming that she had touched something I asked her not to touch but after just taking a few minutes to calm down; I came up with a way to save the dish and it was still like i said a very good dish. Ironically, I wanted to try this because my mom hasn't been big on meatloaf since her latest stroke has turned her into a child again and this really brought back her excitement over what she considered a very boring dish again.

My wife and I really liked this a lot. I subbed the bread with 1/3 cup reg bread crumbs, left out the bacon and added some sauteed diced onions, green peppers and carrot. Didn't miss the bacon at all, it still had a ton of great flavor. Will definitely make again!

This was the best meatloaf ever -- even better than meatloaf with gound beef.  I made it basically to the recipe with only a few changes.  I sauteed the onions with some diced green bell pepper and garlic.   And I substituted Italian breadcrumbs for the bread, but everything else was straight by the recipe.  It was really awesome.  I worry that the calorie count may be a little on the low side because of all the cheese.  I might half the cheese next time.

This was so easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. I prefer Dijon mustard so that was the only change I made .

Instead of cheddar cheese like they asked, I used mozzarella cheese. It works the same and it tastes amazing.

Awesome! Moist, delicious and nice change from normal mt loaf! The only thing I did different was use bread crumbs, dbl sauce and saute onions. This recipe is a keeper!

My husband said "yuck" when I told him we were having turkey meatloaf, but he actually loved it and had 2 servings! I modified the recipe to fit what I had on hand.I left out the worcestershire. I used real bacon, American cheese, seasoned breadcrumbs ,and I sauteed the onion with garlic and some mushrooms. It was delicious!! I served it with baked potatoes and salad. My daughter also loved it, and we still have enough for another dinner.

Pretty good, although I thought it was kind of dry. I spiced it up a little by adding red curry powder to both the meat mixture and the sauce.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Used onion powder instead of diced onions, and used Italian style bread crumbs instead of fresh bread.  My wife and I ate half the loaf in one sitting.

I thought it tasted great! I've made a few different meatloafs before and my husband thought this was the best thus far. I followed the recipe pretty closely - I probably put in less onion than requested, I used that "ready to eat" bacon that you just need to heat in the microwave for a minute (7 pieces, 90 seconds, didn't need to use the veg oil). One thing I was thinking of adding in to the loaf was some powdered ranch dressing mix that I thought I had left over from a previous recipe for a little extra flavor (unfortunately I didn't end up having any, but potentially for the future?). I did mix some ranch dressing in with the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar that you paste over the top though, not sure if it really added any extra flavor or not. But didn't ruin it, that's for sure! Lastly was that I made it in a traditional loaf pan, not quite sure why it says to make in a 9x13 pan? I'd recommend it! Very juicy/moist.

Love this recipe!  My husband and I prefer it to ground beef meatloaf. I used a cup of breadcrumbs instead of the bread, and used Splenda Brown Sugar instead of regular brown sugar. A keeper!

We really liked this! I used 3 slices of thick cut applewood bacon, I used seasoned bread crumbs, real minced garlic instead of powder and I added a little milk to the mixture because it seemed dry for meatloaf. I also made 4 individual mini meat loaves in large muffin tins. I baked it for 35 minutes and it turned out perfect! This was a nice change of pace and I had everything on hand so I didn't have to make a special trip to the store. Thanks for the recipe!

This was super delicious *but* the recipe calls for WAY too much onion. I love onions and this was soooooo too many. I used less than half what the recipe called for and it was still a bit much. With what the recipe calls for it would have been an onion loaf. 

Also I used less bacon because it would have been salty for my taste with as much as the recipe called for, but that's a preference. 

The sauce for the top is delicious and the final product tastes similar to a McDonald's cheeseburger (I have Celiac disease so I haven't actually had one in a decade, so I am going off a distant memory lol) 

I added more Black pepper, fresh garlic rather than powder (about 2 cloves), and a tsp of dried basil. 

I will definitely make this again.

This is seriously the best meat loaf ever!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written (except I substituted panko bread crumbs for the bread) and it was wonderful.  I could not believe how moist it was with turkey.  I will use regular bacon next time, though, because it is such a pain to break up the turkey bacon.  This will be a regular meal at my house!

I made this meatloaf exactly as the recipe read.  My husband nor I liked it. It had NO flavor at all; it definitely did not taste like a cheese burger!!  Very bland.  I am trying to convert us over to turkey, and will continue to try recipes, but not this one.  I have found that recipes that are either Mexican or Italian are very good.  In other words, LOTS of spices.  Maybe some sage would have helped in this recipe.

I made this for dinner last night and we loved it. I didn't change the recipe at all and the next time I make it I still will not make any changes. If it isn't broken don't fix it.  FYI it makes 6 nice size slices and each is 6 WW points

Yum! I did add more flavour, otherwise it would have been bland. I added a few squirts of liquid smoke, used panko crumbs instead of bread, also added in some paprika, extra onions (whole med onion) and bacon and cheese.

This is my family's favorite meatloaf!  My husband asks for this all the time.  Thanks to other reviewers, I use a cup of Panko bread crumbs instead of bread (saves time) and just use regular bacon.  I find that I have to bake mine for about an hour, not quite done after only 45 minutes.

I replaced the french bread with bread crumbs and used regular bacon.  I have to say this was amazingly delicious.  I also sliced up the meatloaf and made it like a miny burger on hawaiann rolls.  I have 3 kids that are picky eaters and they ate the entire meatloaf.  Thank you!!

This recipe was deliciousness. I used what I had on hand for the ingredients. I ended up using bacon ends instead of turkey bacon and made the bread crumbs out of Italian baked bread.

We love meatloaf and love to try all takes on meatloaf. My family really enjoyed this but I sub'd the chopped onion for onion flakes because my toddlers just aren't into so much onion. I only used half the amount of bacon it calls for and would never in a million years dream of cooking bacon in oil. I put it in the oven in a foil lined sheet at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes (varies depending on the amount of bacon) and have sub'd a variety of things for the bread... our favorite substitution is Hawaiian Sweet Rolls! I tear them up a little and toss them in the oven for a few minutes to make them easy to crumble into the meat mixture.

It was a spontaneous last moment decision for dinner and also for meal prepping. This was the first time I cooked meatloaf myself and I must say I did very well. My taste buds are thanking me right now!!!!!

Made this for dinner last night. It turned out awesome. I wasn't paying attention and accidentally mixed the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar into it instead of on top and it still turned out awesome!

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was tasty!  My husband told me to save the recipe and make it again!  I have never cooked with ground turkey meat before.  This was easy, and I had all the ingredients.

Made this for my family & they really liked it.  I have to say it went fast.  I followed the directions exactly with extra seasonings.  I'll definitely make again.

Loved the recipe. Instead of onions used an envelope of Lipton soup,Also used seasoned bread crumbs. I have a loaf pan made out of some type of rubber material

This is a big favorite.  I used regular bacon, only 3 pieces and also, used bread crumbs, about 1 C.  And, I used fat free cheddar cheese as we are watching calories.  I wouldn't change anything else.  It was a wonderful meal!
