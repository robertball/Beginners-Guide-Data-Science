This is a great recipe and easy to do. I used my cast iron skillet . Also, if you have genuine Greek spice, I used a couple of pinches in the marinade. I also prepared the day before a Greek jogurt lemon and dill dip and let it sit overnight. Zazicki would also be a nice side, and I saut√©ed mushrooms as a side . Never the less I  stayed true to the recipe.  My wife loved it when I made it for a Sunday dinner. This recipe is great
