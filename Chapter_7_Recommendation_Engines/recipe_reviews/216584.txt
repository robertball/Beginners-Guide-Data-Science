The ground hazelnuts smelled so divine when I opened the package of Hazelnut Flour from Italy. I substituted granulated sugar for confectioners' and added 1 T of corn starch, knowing that it may be gritty in texture. But I could not get the balls to form, nor did I know how to dip the messy balls into the chocolate, my hands were sticky. It was all so messy, I put it aside. I will use the mixture to make a groundnut sponge cake, Nussschnitten. Substituting granulated sugar may have caused the problem in forming balls.

Yes, this recipe was messy, but the results were worth the mess.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except that my coffee was room temperature.  I used a breakfast blend and it gives it just a hint of coffee.  The hardest part of this recipe was coating the nougat- does anyone have any suggestions?  I used toothpicks to dip, but they stuck to the "balls" when I tried to drop them on the cookie sheet.  Would give this five stars if the directions addressed the dipping part.

Use german chocolate for dipping. This is a fantastic recipie, just dip the balls into the chocolate by HAND and let the chocolate drain off before putting them on parchment paper. Very little mess! GREAT RECIPIE!
