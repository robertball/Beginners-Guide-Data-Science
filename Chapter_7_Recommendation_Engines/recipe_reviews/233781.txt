Made this recipe for lunch. Used Homemade Flour Tortillas and served with Apple Butter I as the dipping sauce.

I didn't measure on this, just eyeballed everything, and sprinkled some cinnamon on the top when cooked.  Once heated, the brie oozes with mellow creaminess, the apples stay crisp, and all ingredients partner well. I had Granny Smith apples which worked beautifully. Sliced into smaller wedges this would make a great item for a brunch table, great finger food.   Really yummy!

Tasty and easy (though I use smaller tortillas to make them easier to cook). If you add nuts, it's a great mix of protein, fat, and carbohydrates to keep your energy up after lunch.

I made this with just the tortillas, apples (I used Granny Smith), and the brie.  I also tried it sprinkling cinnamon on the apples.  Really liked it both ways.
