HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: This simple dish always makes people think you've got MAD cooking skills which is great if you're trying to impress the in-laws.  I bake this at 375 for 15 min., check on it with a fork (to see if it flakes easily), and follow it up with a few minutes under the broiler.  Perfect every time and as you can tell from my picture, I had no burning!  Served it with another easy but impressive dish "Colleen's Potato Crescent Rolls."  Many people think Pillsbury crescents are the best and should not be substituted ....until they try these. ;)

Doubled the sauce, baked at 425 for 20 mins.  Used freshed Alaskan Halibut and this was wonderful.  Served over pasta with a salad.  Easy to do on a weeknight.

Excellent base recipe. Here are my modifications:  Added a few shakes of Louisanna hot pepper sauce for kick, omitted the onions, added a bit of dill, celery salt and parsley.  My dish did not work well under the broiler so I baked it at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.  Will be regular at our house.

This recipe makes the best halibut meal I've ever tasted.  This is a five star dinner recipe. My wife and I raved about this and vowed to make at least once a week.  It was so good that we made it two days in a row!!  I didn't change anything and it was perfect. Make sure the halibut is flakey before putting the sause on. Mine took nine minutes the first time and ten the second time.  It depends on how thick the cuts are.  Then return it to the oven for two more minutes.  PERFECT!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I sprinkled a few bread crumbs on top of the cheese mixture.  I will most definitely make this again and again.

Neither my husband or I particularly like fish - but we love this!  I have used tilapia and red snapper - we have enjoyed it all.  I have also served for company who LOVES fish, and the raved about this.  Although I pretty much make it "as is" some of the others reviewers suggestions seem appropriate too!

I do not rate too many recipes. This is by far one of the best recipes on this site. This is beyond resturant quality. Everytime I make this everyone has to have the recipe. I have not used Halibut, what ever kind of fish you are using should be a more firm fish. I use on stripped bass and it comes out wonderful. I have also tried cod and talapia it work really good too. One thing to keerp in mind if it is a thinner fish broil it for a shorter time. Do not over cook. The other thing I use is fresh grated parmesan. The Kraft bottled parmesan will not work. I can not imagine this being anything but 5 stars. Do not try this on salmon. It has to be a firm white fish. Enjoy

I have to agree with everybody. I made no changes and loved this fish. I can't believe the calorie count, it was so rich tasting.

Sorry, but we just didn't find the flavor to be that good.
I will however play with the recipe because it looks pretty good with less mayo and butter.

I couldn't get halibut at the store (either fresh or frozen) so I substituted mahi mahi. I also didn't have quite enough parmesan cheese, so I added some shredded cheddar to the mix. My 13 year old couldn't get enough and thought it was better than a restaurant, but my six year old didn't like it (but she doesn't like too much fish anyway). I enjoyed it, but next time I will use halibut, because I prefer the taste of halibut over mahi mahi. Also, I would like to find other fish recipes that are a little leaner and less fat. I will make again occassionally but am still looking for a favorite healthy fish recipe.

This was fantastic. We did not have a lemon handy (substituted white wine vinegar). An easy 5 stars with the lemon I'm sure. Baked at 350 for 8 minutes, flipped it, put the topping on, and broiled for another 3 minutes (came out perfect). Will definitely be making this again!

I think this recipe was aptly named; it certainly did justice to the fish.  I was fortuntate enough that I had fresh caught and expertly filleted and packaged halibut from Alaska...I watched the expert haul it in (96 lbs) and helped him process it (thank you, Amigo). I did read some reviews ahead of time (which I do with most of the recipe's on this site) and got a few helpful hints...a few of my fillets were thinner than others...so the advice of putting a little sauce at the bottom of the baking pan was helpful. I did bake this at 425 for 20 minutes, adding the sauce on top after 15 minutes...that was perfect. This recipe is in my "box" and will be used again. None of the diner's had a scrap left on their plates and the cook got a hug and a kiss. Now THAT says it all for me.  *smile*

I cooked it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out pretty good.  The only difficulty I had was adding the spread on to the cooked halibut.  By the time I finished it had melted and was running all over the dish.  Next time I will use a smaller dish to keep the melted spead contained to the top of the fish.

This recipe is AMAZING! I did make a few changes beings that I don't keep certain things on hand (or could justify buying them just for one dish).   As MAMASPICE posted substituted the green onions for the dill and parsley; I also didn't have celery salt so I used celery seed instead.   Another substitutions and additions I made:  Reduced fat Miracle Whip for the Mayo (because frankly I don't eat Mayo or Miracle Whip so I only had the reduced fat Miracle Whip my better half prefers.)   1/4 teaspoon of garlic power  1/4 teaspoon of onion salt  (I added these because I think they make EVERYTHING better). And about a handful of shredded Mozzarella cheese  I used a baking + broiling method (350 for 15 mins then broiled it for about 5 mins) I think the cooking time was just a tad too long because the Halibut was really flaky – according to chief Gordon Ramsay that’s over cooked but when it comes to Fish, Chicken, or Pork I would much rather it be a little over cooked than undercooked). Next time (which will be soon) I will probably adjust the cooking time as Bake at 350 for 8 mins Broil for 5.   I served this awesome Halibut over pasta lightly tossed in pesto sauce and it was a REAL hit! THANKS FOR POSTING!

This recipe was really delicious however we found it a little rich/greasy.  I only used 1 TBSP of butter and subbed white wine for the rest and still with the cheese and mayo it was oily.  Mayo, butter and cheese is a little overkill.  I really loved this recipe but next time will cut out butter and use a 1/4 cup of white wine instead. I did not broil but as another reviewer said, cooked everything together at 375 for about 20 minutes and turned out perfect. Great for company!!!

Love this recipe! We live in Alaska and get halibut enough that it is fun to try new recipes with. I love the ease of this recipe and how wonderful the flavors were. I did have to substitute a four cheese blend for the Parmesan since I didn't have that on hand. And I did sprinkle salt and pepper on the raw halibut before I put it in the oven. Great recipe and so easy and wonderful flavor the whole family put it away! It is easily in my favorites from now on.

Wish I would have doubled the sauce, will next time. I baked at 375 for 25 minutes which was too long. Next time I will bake for 15 and then put the sauce on and bake for 5 more.

Soo yummy and easy to make. Only thing I did differently was to season the fish first with garlic powder, onion powder, lemon juice, thyme, S/P. I also added some (buttered and browned) Panko crumbs to the top of the cheese mixture. Definately a keeper!

We really liked this recipe.  The changes that we made were to omit the mayonnaise (not sure what that would add, except to make the butter mixture a little thinner) and we used chives instead of green onions, and we cooked the halibut on the grill. The substitutions were purely out of convenience as we happened to be out of both mayo and green onions, and I already had the grill heated up prior to finding this recipe.  =)  We put a small amount of the butter mixture on the fish while it cooked on the grill (about 10-12 minutes @ 400-500 degrees - but pulled it off before it was completely cooked) and then put the rest of the mixture on the fix and put it under the broiler.  Served it with grilled asparagus  and a Spanish white wine, not too dry, and it was fantastic!

The flavor in this was magnificent.  I did what others did and baked for 15 minutes and then broiled for a few minutes at the end.  My husband who is trying fish now - LOVED THIS!  We will do this again!

I was suprised because this got such great reviews.  Broiling the halibut makes the fish to dry.  I think maybe if you baked this at 350 for 20-25 minutes that it would taste better.  Won't make this again and was asked not to. Better ways to make halibut

OMG.  So good.  It makes the 'but' in 'halibut' stands for 'butter'.  Normally my 6 and 9 year old offspring refuse to try anything new, most certainly not fish, so I bought small piece for just myself and my husband.  Then I made chicken for my picky eaters.  When the halibut was done and I taste tested it, it was like heaven swimming in my mouth.  I promptly told my family that it hadn't turned out and the fish was awful, so to spare them I would eat the fish and they could have chicken.  They caught on and I had to share.  Not a speck of halibut was left, only some whining and crying for more.  I am making this again tonight with a more generous portion of halibut.

This recipe was excellent. I was recently fishing in Alaska and was able to try this recipe with freshly caught Halibut (which in my opinion, made this even better). The recipe makes the fish flake easily and provides a taste that can't be compared to any other way I have had Halibut. With a freezer full of halibut, I will be having this again. One other note though...the addition of a little bit of crumbled cooked bacon on top adds a little bit of pop to this already amazing recipe!

Outstanding recipe lighter than you would expect compliments any mild white fish.  I did tweak this a bit.  Added 1/2 package of zest italian dry salad dressing mix to the topping for some subtle extra flavor.  Also doubled the lemon juice.  Excellent left over as well.

Amazing!  My husband said this was some of the best fish he has ever eaten.  The only thing I changed was to cook @ about 375 for about 20 minutes and then broil for 2-3.  Definitely a keeper!

Have made this several times.  I have varied the fish based on what was on sale...delicious with haddock and tilapia or probably any mild white fish.

Delicious! I bake this at 375 for 15 min., check on it with a fork (to see if it flakes easily), and follow it up with a few minutes under the broiler.   Served with freshly steamed broccoli and crescent rolls.

If you like fish, you will love this. If you don't like fish, you will love this. ADVICE - double the amount of sauce. You will be glad you did. (I used sweet chili sauce instead of hot pepper sauce....and I added more than a dash). I thought it totally made the dish. The sweetness complimented the other ingredients nicely.

I always struggle with what to do with fish. This recipe was really, really good. I followed the recipe as is, but did use 1/2 fat mayonaise. My broiler doesn't work that well, so I just baked in the oven at 400 for about 15 mins. Then broiled the top until it had some brown bits on top.

I would definately make this again for an ocassion where I wasn't watching fat & calories.

I've been making this recipe 3-4 times a month since June with Halibut we caught on vacation.  I tried several modifications but prefer the original recipe.  Try sprinkling Ritz cracker crumbs on top of the cheese mixture for the last minute or two of broiling!  Delicious!

I broiled on a regular broiler pan then when I added the topping I put a sheet of foil down so the cheese wouldn't be lost.  Served fish and saved topping over garlic onion rice.  Delish!

I think this recipe should stress using fresh Parmesan cheese as I always do; I only use the ‘shaker’ Parmesan for pizza.  This turned out OK but did not knock our socks off.  Will try again without the mayo and add some garlic also will season the fish slightly before cooking.  Served with rice cooked in Knorr Vegetable soup mix.

THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! WOW SO FLIPPING GOOD!  Didn't put in the green onion and added two BIG hot sauce shakes.  IT WAS delicious!  Our Halibut was super thick so cooking time was longer but the fish was moist and DELICIOUS.  I even used low fat mayo!  I did not double the topping and thought it to be plenty. MAKE IT- RESTAURANT QUALITY...

Wow, this was an incredibly good dish!!!  Seriously, this was so delicious.  I'd never had halibut before and was trying to branch out from our usual Tilapia and Salmon that we usually have.  Holy cow, this was so delicious.  I can't stop thinking about how good it is.  And so easy too!  I had steaks instead of fillets and cooked them at 375 for 15 minutes until they flaked easily.  Then put the topping on and popped under the broiler for a few minutes.  I loved the taste of the onions and the little bit of hot sauce.  Perfect!  There was plenty of topping for our 4 steaks.  All of my kids (ages 5,3,1) gobbled it up and my husband did too.

Wow, it was really good!
Next time I will 1/2 the butter.
I baked it for 15min @ 375, then put on the cheese mixture baked for 5 more mins & broiled until brown.  
Even my 1 year old ate it!

I would "lightly dust" the fish with this sauce.  It was way too rich when spread over the entire filet.

I also didn't find it that flavourful. Also the topping was so rich, it was hard to eat. The sauce does taste good but just too rich.

Seriously awesome combo of ingredients... made it six times... have had RAVE reviews from friends and family... everyone was asking for the recipe!!  Can substitute natural yogurt or sour cream instead of the mayonnaise and/or butter... oh, red onion finely chopped instead of green onions works wonderfully.  Another suggestion, sprinkling something on the halibut before going into the oven.  Salt/pepper, lemon flakes, hint of paprika and/or garlic powder... to taste... but not necessary!

I really hate to rate this so low since it seems most everyone else loved it. However for me all I could taste was pretty much was mayo and it was just way too rich. Thanks for the idea though!

Very tasty stuff!!  I seasoned the halibut with cracked pepper and dill then baked @ 375 for about 20 min. then added the sauce and broiled till browned and bubbly.  We love halibut and enjoyed it cooked this way.

Thanks for sharing this great restaurant quality recipe.  Other than coming out very oily at the bottom, but well worth it.  I used partially frozen fish pieces, next time I will use fresh.  I am sure the taste will be even better.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  Served this with some Mushroom pilaf.  Great compliment for this fish.  Mmm, I can still taste the goodness.

We followed this recipe minus onions.  It was really, really good.  As per other raters, i felt 1/4 cup butter was too much, which is my reason for four stars.  Besides that, flavor was great and will def make again with less butter.

This was Divine!  I made it as stated except I followed the advice to bake the Halibut at 375 for 15 minutes before putting on the sauce and putting it under the broiler.  I also drained the liquid (fish drippings)  from the pan before putting on the sauce.  Since some of the sauce drips off the fish while under the broiler, I served it already dished up on the plates and drizzled some sauce over the fish.  Heavenly!!!  I don't like spicy so I was questioning the hot pepper sauce, but I added it anyway and it was not spicy, yet still full of flavor!

I halved this recipe, and should have left out the butter as some other reviewers recommended. Under the broiler, the topping sort of ran off the fish leaving a delicious, but very lightly flavored fillet.

Everyone thought this was delicious, even the kids!  But our sauce never browned.  Maybe I'll reduce the butter next time.

This is a fabulous recipe, but you don't need the butter at all.  I omitted it by mistake the first time I made this dish.  The second time I used the butter and preferred it without.  Delicious either way.

My family loved this dish!  I've always got these topping ingredients on hand so it'll become one of my go-to recipes.  I have tilapia in the freezer so that'll be the fish I'll use next time - which will be next week!

I made as stated and it worked perfectly for me.

Too much grease.  Perhaps better with less butter and more parmesan.  Also needs more spices to liven up the flavour.

Added onion powder instead of green onions, and added a few dashes of dill weed for an extra dimension of flavour.  Very good

Great recipe. We eat A LOT of halibut because we live in AK, and this is a good addition to our recipe box. Quick and easy, with ingredients we always have on hand. I did sub regular onions for the green, and it was just fine. I'm sure it's better with the green onions.

I just started liking fish and I did not like this at all.  My husband has always liked fish and he did not really care for it either.  It had too much lemon for me, but I wouldn't make again even with the lemon reduced.

My husband and I really liked this.  THe reason I'm giving it only four stars is because I would have liked a bit bolder flavour.  Next time I think I will add some garlic and maybe some more hot sauce.  I served it with oven roasted potatoes and asparagus.

This was good, but I found that the parmesan cheese made the sauce a little gritty. I probably won't make again. However, the whole family did enjoy it.

This was phenomenal; truly the best Halibut I've ever prepared.  I cooked it for 20 minutes at 375, adding the sauce halfway through.  I put in more than a dash of hot sauce and added some Old Bay Seasoning.  This was so fantastic that I'm thinking about picking up another fillet to repeat this recipe again tomorrow!

This is a perfect recipe for halibut and for those who are just starting to cook or experiment with fish. This recipe will at least make you look like a sous-chef. I was a little worried when I first started it but that all went away when I was told how wonderful and tasteful it was, and presentation was excelent out of the oven ( if it looks good people will atleast try it befor casting judgment).Pefect for people who like fish but not strong fishy taste. My advise to those who are thinking of trying this recipe dont substittute any of the ingredients and use right proportions.

This was amazing!!  My grocery store hardly ever has halibut and this week they had halibut steaks on sale.  I used about a 1.15 lb halibut steak and baked at 375 for 25 minutes.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly and after baking the halibut, spread the sauce on the fish and broiled until bubbly and a little brown.  My husband and I loved it!!

very good, if a little rich... accidentally added too much butter so i compensated with some sharp cheddar cheese. had a lot of the topping/sauce left over so i made some penne pasta with spinach, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, onions and bacon and just mixed the leftover butter/cheese mixture into the cooked pasta and vegetables. kids & hubby loved it! will try next time to make it a little less rich - decrease mayo, butter, cheese? can't believe how little salt and how flavorful!

It is excellent. I make it over and over again and everyone is impressed. Wild rice and steamed veggies on the side are great for a weekday. Orzo pasta with (more) butter, (more) parmesan and parsley and a nice salad are perfect for guests! It works with other white fish and I'm considering trying it on salmon... we'll see how that works :-)

Delicious. I didn't have any lemon so I used lime, and it worked well. Also, I used breadcrumbs as some of the other reviewers suggested. I will definitely make this again. It was easy and my boyfriend loved it.

This was so good! I made it over a month ago and I haven't been able to find halibut in the stores since. If I'd been able to get more halibut, we'd be eating this at least once a week.
I was worried it was going to be like so many recipes I've seen where the mayo makes a weird fluffy layer on top but it wasn't at all.

We fish for salmon and halibut way up north every year and are always looking for new recipes.  This one is similar to our old stand-by for halibut, but it is SO good.  We REALLY loved the GBD (Golden Brown Delicious) that happens when this topping goes under the broiler.  I baked the fish until it was flaky and then broiled it after putting the topping on it.  1 inch filets took about 25 minutes in a 350 oven.  They were so moist and tender, and the topping was delish.  Next time I'll add more than the 3 dashes of hot sauce as I could not really grab that flavor in the sauce, but it was smooth and creamy,  LOVE IT!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars.  It was truly delicious.  My husband said it was the most delicious meal he's ever had (we've been married 25 years).  I don't even care for fish, and I just loved this.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Great!!  I used tipalia because thats all i had, but it still came out delicious.  My daughter even dumped a lot of garlic powder in the cheese mixture.  I thought she had ruined it, but it came out wonderful still.

This one is a keeper...and it couldn't have been easier!

Was good, but I will have to find ways to make this less rich/fatty.  Will also try it with Tilapia as we like that fish, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am inudated with halibut every year after my boyfriend goes on his Alaskan fishing trip and never have any idea as to how to prepare it.  This recipe was not only easy and quick, but a HUGE hit!

Heavenly  and then some! I made this last night with fresh Halibut from Washington! We easily have the BEST fresh fish up here! And the results were superb! This was the best Halibut I have ever had and could easily be a seafood dish that you would find in a top notch restaurant. I did not change a thing! I just wish there was more of the cheesy sauce left to add over the top of the mashed potatoes I made as a side dish for the Halibut! Thank-you for such a great recipe! Definitely a keeper!

It was good, but most of the topping melted immediately and slipped off the fish into the bottom of the pan. Next time I will bake the fish with the topping already on it instead of broiling first then adding the cold topping to the hot fish.

I followed one of the reviews and baked the fish (I used salmon fillets) at 375 for 15 minutes and then added the cheese sauce as is and broiled for 2 minutes. It was very flavourful and I would definitely make it again.

This was very tasty. I didn’t add the green onion because I didn’t have them but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time, I will sprinkle some panko on top for a little added crunch.

Very good, I will definitely be making this again.  The husband even liked it and he's not a big fan of fish.  I ended up having all the ingredients on hand, so I didn't need to buy any odd seasonings etc that I would likely not use up before expiration.

I caught halibut on a recent fishing trip and was really excited to try out some new recipes. I followed this recipe almost exactly and I think it came out a little over cooked. My family thought it was really good but I think they were just being nice. If I try this recipe again I will probably try some other reviewers suggestions and cook at a lower temp.

I made this with frozen cod after previously making it with halibut.  Both times were excellent.  I also baked it at 425 F degrees and checked with thermometer at 15 minutes.  It was wonderful.  And I am not a fish-lover usually.  Came  out perfectly.

Very good recipe but not amazing. Made it as directed. When I'm making a recipe for the first time, I follow the recipe. Maybe with a little tweaking this could be amazing. Overall we felt it lacked something but it's still a very good recipe.

My husband and I thought it was ok, but my son really liked it.  We baked it first and then broiled it after we put the topping on it.  We will probably make it again because my son really, really likes it.

I thought it was too heavy  with the mayonnaise.  I prefer my fish to be lighter with a garlic lemon butter sauce or something similar.. I did like the green onions though.

Excellent recipe!!!  My husband just told me it was the best fish I've ever made!  I cut the topping recipe in half because I was only cooking two servings.   I baked it for 8 minutes at 400 degrees and then added the topping and broiled it for an additional 4 minutes.

This is wonderful!  I made it last week, and my husband is asking for it again already!  I sprinkled a bit of dill on top before I cooked it, but otherwise followed these instructions to the letter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I've prepared this halibut dish twice now with yummy results.  I too baked my wild Alaskan fish first at 350 degrees and then finished it up under the broiler just until it browned.  I use chives and parsley instead of just onions and added a dash of hot wing sauce. Melt in your mouth goodness! My husband normally does not care for fish, but he loves this dish. Will now be served at our home often....it's so easy to make!

Actually it tasted great, but talk about gilding the lily. Why embellish Halibut, a cut of fish so sublime that it needs little more than a squeeze of lemon and S&P?

I made this for dinner last night from some Halibut that was given to us.  OMG!  My husband and I thought this was restaurant quality and want to try this on other seafood = maybe shrimp.  You need something with some substance because the mix is a bit rich, but it was absolutely wonderful!

I think you can't go wrong adding butter, mayo and Parmesan. Super easy recipe to follow - it'd be hard to mess this one up.  I'm living a keto / lchf lifestyle and this recipe fit in perfectly. It was delicious. If you don't like mayo recipes, you prob won't like this one, though, just a warning. Otherwise, make it your own and enjoy!

I bake it at 375 degrees for 15 min like the other review suggested and then I spread on the sauce. I broiled it for 3 min. It was awesome. I had five filets and had to double the sauce recipe. My guests loved it! Had enough to put on the rice. Served with Brown rice and a mix salad. Will make this again.

Followed the mixture of this recipe to a T. It was restaurant stile good.  My halibut was done in 13 minutes.  I put the sauce on and baked for another 1:30. Turned out perfect!

I followed the ingredients as listed, except before I put the mayo mixture on the fish, I sprinkled a little garlic powder and Old Bay on the fish. After I put the mayo mixture I sprinkled fresh cracked black pepper and a little more Old Bay for presentation. I was slightly worried that all the seasoning might affect the delicate flavor of the halibut but it turned out perfect! Habanero Tobasco in the mayo mixture kicked it up a notch. I baked at 375 for 25 minutes and then I browned the top under the broiler. Very little effort for a delicious dish. Thanks for posting!

This turned out great using cod.  I also sprinkled the green onions on raw after baking and it really amped the recipe up to 5 stars.  Will be making again and hopefully with halibut next time!

This is FABULOUS! My bro-in-law, who HATES fish, had a 2nd helping!! The Parmesan topping is by far the best I've ever had - no restaurant has ever come close! We LOVE it and make it frequently.

This recipe is a keeper!  I did change it a bit - only because I was using what I had on hand!  OMG sooooooo good! I changed the green onions to 2TB parsley, used 1/4 tsp scotch bonnet/mango hot pepper sauce (my own), then realized I didn't have any lemons either so I used 20ml white wine vinegar as per the other reviewer and 10 ml lime juice (from concentrate). Preheated oven to 375, then turned it onto broil and broiled for the 8 min flipped it over added the sauce and broiled for additional 3 min - totally awesome!  I served it with Garlic-Dijon mashed potatoes (skins on) and a salad of avocado, tomato, red onions, on a romaine base with aged balsamic vinegar - totally awesome Valentine's Dinner

This is our favorite recipe for white fish.  It's rich, tasty, and super easy.  It's best with halibut, but it's also very good with cod.  I double the sauce and get generous with the hot sauce because we like it spicy.  Broiling it for a minute or two at the end takes it from great to fabulous.

This has become my go to recipe for a quick dinner. I always have the ingredients and it takes only as long as the fish needs to bake. I usually serve steamed broccoli or squash and whole wheat orzo.

Super easy to prepare, but very very rich, even for me, who is a fan of rich and cheesy food.  One tip - no need to keep the extra sauce that is in the pan, the coating that stays on top of the fish is plenty for flavor.

This is indeed heavenly.... It's quite rich but the flavour is to die for.  We also used it on Tenderloin steaks and it was great there as well.

UPDATED POST Sept 2014 - OK my boyfriend has been making this dish for us for a good couple of years now and we NEVER get sick of it. However, at my request he has revised the ingredients to make it a little healthier. We eliminate the butter all together and use 2-3 Tablespoons of plain yogurt instead. Also, our mayo is the light variety. It's still soooo delicious and not greasy as previous posters have mentioned. I definitely would not substitute the lemon juice or the Parmesan for anything else though! Please believe me!
Mmmmmm....just had the leftovers for lunch and had to post :)

ORIGINAL POST:
This dish was INCREDIBLE! We had guests for dinner. They brought the halibut and we never really cook it so we were a little nervous, but this came out soooo good I cannot give it enough praise!
We didn't have any green onions in the the house, so we sub'd red onion diced very small. Delish!

I didn't have lemons or green onion.  I used orange ruffy instead of Halibut.  I pan fried side one on high heat with olive oil for 2 min then turned over and transferred to cookie sheet and spread sauce generously over raw side. Broiled for 2 minutes in the oven and it turned out perfectly moist.

My 3 & 5 year olds loved this and asked for more multiple times.  And, my 3 year old would never eat fish!  My hubby & I thought it was great as well.  We'll make it again.
We baked it at 375 for 20 minutes (fillets were on the thicker side), then broiled for 3 min.

Delishis!!!!! LOL. I seasoned my halibut with lemon pepper first, and topped with a little panko. This will be entering the recipe rotation. I'm about to try it now with Cod. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this 100 times and honestly you will impress family, guests and kids. I have a 5 yr old and 11 yr old that gobble this up every time. My only changes - no butter and instead of hot pepper sauce I use red pepper flakes.

Excellent! Added a bit more hot sauce, but otherwise followed the rules. We couldn't stop eating it until we were downright uncomfortable! Had it with a white cheddar pasta side, which complemented the flavor very well. Quick, easy, yummy.

Very cheesy, the Parmesan really comes through. Surprisingly, our seven year old loved it, possibly because it is a bit like butter and Parmesan noodles. She asked for it for every dinner from now on!

Easy, and very tasty.   Thickness of the steaks greatly affects cooking time FYI.  Ours was 3" at the center, so we baked at 425 for 12 minutes, then broiled the rest of the way, with the topping on for the duration.  

The Parm chees crusted beautifully!  Served with Artichoke hearts, drizzled with the pan drippings

We really liked this recipe.  The only things I did different was skip the butter as recommended by other reviewers, skip the hot sauce, and add parsley and basil.  My husband really liked it, but told me next time to double the sauce.

This recipe deserves 10 stars!  Originally, I used this topping for Sole but it's even better with Halibut.

This is absolutely excellent! Made this for a dinner party and they all raved about it.  Made it few time since and we just love this recipe.  Used it on other fish but our favorite is Halibut and Chilean Sea Bass.  Great flavor and it is so easy.

the cheese topping added the perfect touch to an already amazing piece of halibut my husband bought us! (i omitted only the salt)
we both cleaned our plates and remarked that this fish dish was better than any we could order at local restaurants!
i'll be making halibut this way again at our house...

Excellent! Followed Recipe EXACTLY. Note the "Broiled Grouper Parmesan" recipe is much the same, but the Green Onions added some great texture. I also added a few bread crumbs and garnished with fresh parsley...it was beautiful on the table. Used the "Blue Hake" fish from the Schwan Man... It was a perfect dinner!

It was okay - - but I thought the sauce was a little heavy for such a delicate fish...Not sure how to make it "better", so I'm only giving it 3 stars...

Turned out really good.  I thought it would be a little heavy for the Halibut, but mostly I just got the great lemon taste.  Will definately make this one again.

The flavor of the sauce is nice, however, it is all wrong for halibut. this is more along the lines of something I would expect for oyster motoyaki. Halibut is way to delicate a fish with flavor far too mild for such a flavourful sauce.I will stick to more simplistic flavors like lemon, salt and pepper, cilantro, garlic, etc.. This didnt ruin my meal, but there was dramatic room for improvement. I may try to addapt this recipe for other uses but I will not use it nor recommend for halibut.

This dish is perfect... no changes required.  I have been serving it for several years, and always to rave reviews.   In fact I keep print-outs available for dinner guests, who always ask for it.   I do prefer fresh halibut, not frozen...

my husbanc who doesnt like fish AT ALL rated this an 8 which makes this a keeper.  i found it good but found that the ratio of mayonnaise was a bit too much.  i read a lot of reviews calling this bland so i sprinkled garlic salt on the fillets before cooking and it was anything but bland.  next time i will use less mayo... more hot sauce... more lemon and less onions but overall i was satisfied with the recipe.

TRULY HEAVENLY!!! I'm eating this as I write this.. this is an incredibly delicious recipe. I doubled the sauce per another reviewer's suggestion but don't believe this is necessary as it is such a flavorful dish.  I added a tad more hot sauce, but other than that, followed the instructions. AMAZING!

Incredibly easy, quick, and AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! My 14 month old could not get enough of it, and her father says it's the best fish he's ever had!  Next time I might use half the butter to eliminate some fat, and might just substitute the butter with olive oil all together... Thank you so much for this wonderful contribution!

My fish eating family loved this recipe! I liked the fact that the ingredients were common ones I already had at home...saved me a trip to the grocery store.  The only thing I added were some bits of leftover bacon from breakfast, they complimented the other ingredients very well.

We LOVED this recipe!!  The fish turned out very moist, perfectly cooked... and TASTY!    I kept the recipe as is.. broiled for 9 minutes... then added topping... then broiled for 2-3 minutes.  It was perfect!  Only change we made was to add a TBSP of white wine and a clove of finely diced garlic to the topping mixture.   Definately a keeper!!

I was set to be prepared for incredibly good tasting halibut with all the wonderful reviews, but was a little disappointed to have just mediocre halibut.  It was cooked well, but tasted just 'ok'.  Won't be using this one again...   sorry.

Absolutely fantastic!! I had never cooked with fish before, so this was a huge step for me, and I couldn't have been happier with how it turned out. I followed the recipe exactly, and the fish turned out super moist and the topping was delish. The only thing I disliked was the smell of fish after I cooked that seemed to linger. That's nothing to do with this recipe though, just a side effect of cooking with something kinda smelly.

Fabulous! I loved this recipe! I don't think I changed a thing. I don't care too much for onions, but the green onions really made it. Even my husband who doesn't care for creamy sauces thought it was excellent. I actually found myself eating the leftover sauce by the spoonful before I washed the dish. (I'm sure that was great for the diet!) =o)

The first time I made this, I didn't care for it, but that's because I used the parmesan in a can.  Every time since, I've loved it using freshly grated parmesan and also cutting down on the mayo.  This is a really fantastic recipe that we've been making at least once a week for some time now.  Thanks for the recipe, chellebelle- this is a winner- my whole family adores it!

I scaled this recipe to 4 servings and cut the recipe in half.  The only change I made was to use haddock in place of the halibut.  The end result was just ok....nothing in the least bit special, so I likely will not make it again.

Absolutely delicious. I used the suggestion to double the sauce and bake at 425 for 20 minutes. My guests raved about this one.

Outstanding. I put a few more shakes of hot sauce in and it tastes great every time. Don't even thinkg aout broiling the halibut until you've baked it first. THe broiling should only occur a few mins before the halibut would normally be done. Don't overcook and enjoy.

We like this recipe. I always rinse and dry my fish then put a little lemon on it before I make any recipe. My kids are picky about fish taste and this helps.

Really great flavor...I did have a problem with the sauce running off the fish in the broiler. I ended up with more sauce on the pan than the fish. Next time I'll cut down on the butter because I don't think it needs it. Otherwise, delish! Will definitely make again. Cheers!

This recipe was wonderful. I only gave it 4 stars because it was too bland for my taste. I ended up adding about 6 dashes of chili powder and a good 15 drops of hot sauce. I did bake at 425 degrees for 15 min with a bit of the sauce on top and then added the rest of the sauce and broiled for an additional 3-5 min. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Great,easy dish. Only addition was that I added some panko bread crumbs on top of the butter-cheese topping. Made for a nice crunchy topping. As other reviewers did,  I baked at 375 degrees and finished in the broiler for 2 minutes.

My husband really enjoyed this dish.  I just brushed the butter on the fish, then sprinkled the lemon juice and spices on top.  I baked it in the oven for 20 minutes.  Really good!

My mother-in-law brought us some fresh halibut from Alaska.I knew I would have a hard time getting my husband to eat it, (doesn't like to eat his own kind) but he LOVED this. I had my mom over that night, and she and my girls loved it as well. It's a HUGE hit in the Fish household. Didn't change a thing, and wont. Thank you, thank you!

Fabulous is the only way to describe this dish.  I am not a hot sauce person so I omitted it but followed the rest of the recipe exactly, this is my new favorite way to cook halibut, try it & you won't be disappointed.

I am always very weary when it comes to making fish.  I followed this recipe exactly as stated (except that I eliminated the hot sauce).  The fish turned out wonderful.  It had a crispy texture on top and the halibut was moist and flaky.

This is my first review from the 100's of recipes I have tried from this site. This is by far the most sumptuous halibut recipe. My family of three ate all 8 servings in one sitting. Restaurant quality recipe, simple and perfect.thank you.

Absolutely yummy and easy! I nixed the hot sauce and used finely chopped white onion instead of green, and it turned out great. I also used more parmesan because I am a cheese freak. My tip: don't get gung-ho and try it on swordfish. It is NOT good on swordfish!

This was really good. Halved the butter/mayo to be healthy and it was still excellent. But the cook time seems to be too little. Ours was raw and we had to put it back in to finish.

All I can say is WOW! This fish was the best! The goop you put on top tastes a bit like an Oysters Rockefeller topping. A bit rich, but definetly deeelish.  I agree it is Heavenly....give it a try you wont be disappointed.

The first of this season's halibut is here! The local seafood shop had a halibut "sidewalk sale" and I really wanted something special. This certainly did the trick.

I am an avid fish-hater, my hubby a fish-lover. I tried this because Halibut is easier on my stomach than most other fish. Most fish makes me sick but this recipe was wonderful! I ate an entire steak! I didn't have green onions so I used chives. I have and will make this recipe over and over again.

We love halibut, and this is a good rendition to add to our repertoire.  I think the next time I make it we'll add some capers!  We use about half the recipe for our pound of fish.  I bake it first for 15 minutes with a little of the sauce, then add more sauce and broil it until browned.  It is yummy!

Excellent!  Flavor was just what I was looking for and that fact you can use it on any white fish is great.  The only thing I did different was bake my fish first at 375* for about 20 minutes and then I broiled it for a couple minutes to brown.  My only complaint, the topping ran everywhere once I put it on the fish because it was so hot already so the browning didn't really happen and I ended up with just a bunch of sauce in the bottom of the pan instead of on the fish.  Next time I will use less butter, I think 1/2 cup is too much.  But flavor wise this was excellent!

This recipe was very good.  I used chopped white onion instead of green onion (didn't like it as much as green onion would have been).  This would be great on chicken too.  I'll definetly make this again.

This is our new favorite way to eat baked halibut. I followed the recipe completely with the exception that I sprinkled bread crumbs on top of the parmesan cheese mixture then broiled. Everyone loved it!

I followed another reviewer's advice and baked the halibut at 375 degrees for a little more than 15 minutes, added the cheese mixture, topped with bread crumbs, and broiled until bubbly. I substituted chives for scallions and doubled the recipe for topping. The dish was well-received, though the fish was a bit underdone. Served it with steamed broccolini and penne pasta.

This was a very wonderful dish. I read the reviews before I made it so I changed a few things. I broiled the fish for 8 minutes on each side(I had the oven rack a little lower)and then when I added the sauce I turned the oven down to 350 and baked it for 15 minutes. I also doubled the sauce which I am glad I did.It was just right. My 17 year old who didn't even want to try it really liked it and said she would gladly eat it again if I made it..which I definately will!

We like it on any fish. I bet it would be good on chicken breasts too. I think I can skip adding the butter and make it a little healthier for us.

This was fast, easy and very tasty!  I doubled the recipe and used a bit of the sauce over asparagus as a side dish.  Wonderful!

The only thing I did different was season the  halibut with garlic salt before putting it in the oven. Excellent recipe.  I served it with mushroom risotto and green beans.

This was cheesy and creamy.  I chose to bake instead of broil it.  I baked it for 15 minutes on 375 and it turned out perfect.  I didn't have enough parma cheese so I used some cheddar cheese I had left over.  Served with mash potatoes.

I'm not the biggest fan of Halibut (a bit bland for my tastes) but the recipe itself is fabulous.

HINT: I topped this dish with some French Fried Onion Rings (like the kind you use in Green Bean Casserole) right before putting it in the broiler the second time. Adds a nice flavor and crunch!

We loved this.  I didn't have the green onions but it was still very good.  I think I'll cut the butter in half next time.  I baked in 425 oven for about 15 minutes in order to brown the top. The time depends how thick the fish is of course. I think broiling would dry the fish as someone else said. When halibut is out of season I'll try it with another fish. It's so quick and easy.

My fiance never ate fish before but now requests this weekly!  I use whatever white fish is on sale - flounder, grouper, cod, etc.  Sometimes I use a mixture of Parmesan and Asiago cheese.  Since we're always calorie and fat-conscious, I use margarine and low-fat mayo. I omit the hot pepper sauce.  Instead of broiling I bake the fish for 25 minutes at 400.  It is the most delicious fish I've ever eaten!!!  And so simple!

So easy and SO good!  I am new to cooking fish - have always been so afraid of it for some reason.  I made this twice this weekend!  My 4 year old, who likes fish, didn't like this because of the onions but my husband and I loved it.  We had company over on Sunday night so I made it again, they raved about it and I think I have my friend hooked on allrecipes (pun intended)!  I did add a bit more hot sauce and cooked a little longer than the recipe called to broil - but I think that comes out of my fear that the fish will be undercooked.  Excellent dish, you won't be sorry!

This was delish!!  I used red snapper, cause that is what DH caught. And I didn't have any green onion, so I used garlic.  And also, since my fillets were thin, I coated them and baked them for about 20-30 minutes.  My PICKY 2 year old couldn't get enough of this.  He and Daddy were fighting over the last piece. LOL.  Will make it again for sure!!

I used basa fillets and maybe they were too thin.  I found the cheese sauce overpowering and didn't care much for it, however, I didn't have green onions or hot pepper sauce (otherwise I would have rated it lower).  My teenage son loved it! (that's why I rated a 4).  I would have to try it with thicker halibut and maybe bake it instead of broiling as some people indicated and spreading it a little thinner.

Very tasty and EASY. Was a hit with everyone. Key is not to overcook it. We broiled it for 6 minutes then 2 minutes longer after topping put on.

Halibut is my husband’s most favorite thing in the world.  He’s eaten a ton over the years and none was cooked by me.  I was really intimidated to cook this pricey piece of fresh Alaskan halibut.   Not anymore!!!!!  
This was the greatest recipe to jump in and get my feet wet!  My husband just raved and raved.  He may be disappointed if I ever cook it another way??.  
Great recipe!!!  Thank you so much!!!!!

This ones a keeper! Absolutely fantastic recipe. I added a tablespoon of dill because my hubby LOVES dill. It’s the best halibut recipe I’ve tried so far.

A great recipe that did justice to fresh halibut I caught in Cook Inlet Alaska. I used half the amount of lemon juice(squeezed two small meyer lemons myself), cut back on the green onion a bit, four dashes of Tapati'o hot sauce and added some shredded parm on top. My wife said that she might want that as her last meal if she had the choice. I served it with a tossed caesar salad and my wife's favorite white wine(Gewürztraminer). I highly recommend this recipe and a trip to Alaska for fresh halibut. Call Gary Kernan at Fish On Charters in Soldotna, it's worth the trip and a great experience. Thank you chellebelle for sharing!

Lovely recipe. It provides much needed fat and flavor to a bland fish. I cooked it on the stove top then finished by broiling in the oven.

I found this perfectly easy and delicious. I made the recipe with Haddock as Halibut was not available. My husband, who does not eat fish and decided to be a good sport, actually had two helpings! Great name.

Delicious made exactly to the recipe.  Halibut is horrendously expensive, therefore, its nice to find a recipe that compliments the fish.

Baked at 375 degrees for 20minutes as previously mentioned.  I broiled it for 2-4 minutes because of the thickness of the Halibut.  My wife really enjoyed the meal.

The flavor was good. I overcooked the fish, but that’s just me. I always have a tendency to overcook so I don’t undercook. Hubs wasn’t in the mood for fish, but he did say it was good. I liked the flavor. I used white vinegar instead of lemon juice b/c another reviewer substituted, as I didn’t have lemon juice. I think this recipe is forgiving, like you could use what you have on hand, or tweak it to your liking. I used foil and made a small “pan” with it so the fish could sit closer together and the topping wouldn’t ooze all over the place. Overall, don’t overcook the fish, the flavor was good.

Have made several times. Sometimes the topping can become runny under the broiler.  I added some panko bread crumbs and problem solved. Sooo good.

This is my go to halibut recipe! Few things I do differently. I season the halibut with salt, pepper and smoked paprika! The smoked paprika gives it sooo much flavor! (Regular paprika is also fine.) I also bake it at 350° for about 15 min.

This would taste better on salmon because it’s just a soggy mess. I would skip the sodium because it’s way too salty with the 1/4 tsp. I am not sure how I feel about the mayo maybe add 1 less tbsp and use only one tbsp of lemon. Parmesan amount was fine. Green onions are just there for garnish. It did nothing for the flavour. Overall it was soggy, salty and definitely missing something to compliment the Parmesan. Even cracked black pepper didn’t help. Sorry.

I made this last night with fresh Alaskan halibut. I did the whole “broil for 8 min” thing, but my fish were still raw on the inside. I added 2 min and then added the topping and instead of two min for that it needed 4. No biggie. Everyone’s ovens are a little off. I just highly suggest checking the fish before placing the sauce on top. I think next time I’m going to bake it as another reviewer suggested. This was great though! My husband and I loved it!!

Delicious and Easy. This is a great sauce, you can add anything to. I did make changes, I used Old Bay instead of Gr. Onion, but look forward to trying that way too. Tried eating this before cooking and had a ? in my head, but once this was broiled on the fish, it was really quite good.

This was excellent!  Didn’t really change much except I omitted the hot sauce (we didn’t have any) and I added about a trillion pounds of garlic. Haha  So awesome!  I made extra sauce and my kids loved it so much that they asked me to make more so that we always have it in the fridge.  I will definitely make this again.

Simple and delicious. as another reviewer mentioned, I will check for flakiness at 8 min as my filets were "on the edge" of done. 9 minutes probably would have been perfect. Definitely making again!

Great recipe!  Turned out perfect!.  I halved it since there were only 2 of us & still it made plenty.  I little oily.  Next time I'm only going to use a pat of butter & enough mayo to get the parm to stick together, save on some calories too!  Also, I added more than a dash of hot sauce, yum!  Turned mixture pink tho.

I baked my fish, and though I feel grilled would be even better, it came out great!

This was so dang good! I added some dill weed to the sauce and it was perfect to us. My somewhat picky three year-old loved it too so that’s a plus. And I followed the baking heat and time exactly and it turned out great. I’ll definitely make this again!

Wow!  This recipe is full of delicious flavor.  Tasted like it was made in a restaurant and the whole family loved it.  Served it over a bed of  rice and drizzled it with the melted butter sauce.

Super easy to make and absolutely DELICIOUS! I had a beautiful hunk of halibut that I didn't want to destroy. Had to show off some cooking skills to the family during our 4th of July get-together. I sliced up the halibut in 1/2 inch "filets" like I would slice a flank steak. Then I topped the fish with this mixture. Sprinkled a small amount of panko crumbs on top and around the dish - not too much, just enough for a toasty crunch. Then I broiled it for about 5 minutes. This was the show stopper! We had some leftovers for the next day (it was a huge chunk of halibut) and it was AS GOOD the next day for dinner as the day of. This is now a favorite recipe that I will use often. I wish I'd taken a photo... maybe next time.

I followed the recommendation to bake at 375 for 15 minutes, then broil on high for 5 (with the Parmesan mixture).... It. Was. So. Good. Highly recommend!!!
Will be making again.

I went to the store for  flounder which was not available. I bought halibut and went home to search for a recipe and found this one. It is easy, has ingredients that are on hand at home and is DELICIOUS.  I will put it into our weekend rotation (alternate with steak). Easy and quick enough it for weeknights but halibut is sorta expensive.  A real winner.

I made this recipe exactly as written, down to the timing in the broiler. This was so delicious! Even my husband was raving and he's not a huge fish fan. I served with parmesan couscous and roasted asparagus spears. Wonderful and easy recipe!

Longer bake time was needed for my dish. Flavor was fantastic.  I paired with steamed broccoli,  and the sauce complimented it really well.

We had 2 - 1” filets each 3/4#. Baked @ 375 for 15 minutes then applied the Heaven (also sprinkled with Pablo crumbs) and broiled 6 minutes. Served over rice with roasted asparagus. Fabulous! Can’t wait to serve this for guests!

Wow, I really liked this recipe and it was mild in taste.  To make it heart healthier I omitted the butter and used mayo made with avocado oil.  I cut it down for one serving.  I put a chunk of brown onion through garlic press.  And used tabasco sauce.  It really is an attractive, browned sauce on top.  If I didn't have to watch salt intake I would have added a splash of wooster sauce too.  In general, I'm going to borrow this prep for other fish and toppings too.

This was so delicious!  The only change I made was to add about a 1/4 cup bread crumbs to the mixture. I'll definitely make it again and I'm going to try some of the leftover topping on chicken fillets today.

It was ok. A little too greasy for my husband and I. The ONLY variation I did was I used a chipotle and lime hot sauce. We also thought the sauce was a little too bland. Think I'll keep looking for a recipe we liked better.

Clean plates-better than restaurant good. Fresh fish is key which I lucked out on at my Publix. My policy is to follow the recipe the first time and tweak after that. However, I could not resist a little Pre seasoning of salt, pepper and Greek seasoning as one reviewer said it was bland. Beyond that the ingredients were the same. I am a fan of convection, so I used the medium (500 degrees) convection broil for 6 minutes, turned and topped with the cheese mixture and broiled for another 3 minutes.

Excellent flavor and tender halibut filets. I’ll definitely make this again my husband loved it. The method I used to cook this recipe was by baking the salt & peppered halibut @425 for 10 minutes, then spread a thick layer of the sauce and finished it under the broiler, keeping a watchful eye to not burn the topping. So delicious!

I bake the fish for 15 minutes at 375 then broil for an additional 2-3 minutes per other suggestions and it comes out fantastic!

Prepared as described, I had a little trouble with the sauce staying on top of the halibut for the final 2 minutes. The butter started to melt and it just slid off.

Delish! I didn’t have green onions or Parm. I used red onions and smoked cheddar. Added zucchini to baking dish and followed same directions with 2x amount of sauce to cover all. Broiled on high with dish on rack second from highest placement. Perfect!!! I’m not a great cook but pretty picky. So glad I made this instead of going out! Super fast and easy and delish!

This is my husbands favorite halibut dish. I use ingredients and amounts as written, using Siracha Sauce, for two 6-8 oz fillets. I bake the halibut @350 for 15 min., or until just opaque ( never overlook fish), add the sauce, broil until bubbly and serve over orzo. So delicious!

This dish tasted absolutely fabulous! I followed the directions pretty much to a T, maybe adding a little bit of additional hot sauce. But, my photo is very easy to spot. My Pyrex dish exploded in the oven. And, yes, I ate it anyway because the dish was intact enough I could do that. And if my dish hadn’t exploded it would’ve been rated five stars. Quick, easy, very tasty!

I made it with Halibut and Mahi at the same time.   Gave the mahi an extra 2 minutes.   3rd shelf broiling until sauce on.  But did broil for 10 minutes for flaky.  So yummy.  I will make again.

I would cut the cook time in the oven by a few minutes, because the halibut came out a little dry.  BUT it was great!  Definitely making this again.

The Parmesan Cheese topping was terrific. We had some left over and tried it on another type of fish later. For my tartar sauce only family, this was a very nice addition. They had not had halibut before. This recipe made a great impression! The topping is great with other white fish too!

Yum! This former Catholic is wanting to eat more fish for Lent. I had just 1.35 # of fish rather than the 2 # called for, and was going to keep everything else the same and just eliminate the butter, as butter, mayo, and cheese seemed like overkill. However, before I added the butter the texture didn't seem very spreadable, so I did add 1.5 T melted butter. Like other reviewers, I just spread it all on from the beginning and baked at 350. I did this for 15 minutes, at which point the internal temperature was 113 degrees F, then turned it up to 450 for around 5 min. It was perfect. Served with rice pilaf and green peas. Will make again. Would use a 1.5 sauce recipe for 2 # of fish.

Well!  I hate people that say they make a recipe and they change it!  but we are on Weight Watchers so I needed to lighten it up.  I used 2 tbsps FF nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the butter and mayo.  I have to say it was delicious!  My husband LOVED it too!  Thank you!! I know I changed it but only because I didn't want to use items high in fat.

I gave this 5 stars because it was really delicious.  However, I made a few changes:  Omit the butter (there is plenty of fat in this recipe from the mayonnaise and cheese.  The butter is overkill), sprinkle a little bread crumbs over the topping and bake for 30 minutes at 375 degrees,  It came out nicely browned and cooked to perfection.  I used haddock instead of halibut.  Any firm white fish would work.  I even think it would be great with chicken breasts.  I will definitely make this again!

Super easy and delicious. I made a slightly lower fat version by cutting the butter in half and using low-fat mayo.
This coating will be good on any firm white fish.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe except I put the sauce on the fish (and some large scallops) before cooking and put it all in the oven at 375 for 20 min. It turned out unbelievable, even my kids loved it. So creamy and cheesy. Going in the favorites.

I made it according to the recipe, except for the hot sauce because my husband isn't a fan of spicy.  It was delicious, but I might add some hot sauce next time to take the flavor up a notch.

This is one of the family favorites for sure. I do however make a few adjustments. I leave out the green onions for my husbands sake. We also add in a bit of med cheddar cheese on the top. The hot sauce we use is called El yucateco Chile habanero. It's hot but my goodness it's delicious.

I followed the recipe but it turned out a little bland and sour. It was edible but I wouldn’t make it again. I’m confused about the rave reviews...

I made this per the recipe. My husband liked it but I just didn't see what all the hype was about. I found it to be ok but not anything to rave about as many reviewers have done. I thought it was extremely bland. I may try it again since hubby liked it (he doesn't  like spicy, so this was right up his alley) however I will add more seasoning. Maybe a little cayenne  or spicy mustard spread on the fish prior to the topping, something with a little zing to it(at least on my portion).

This is a really great and easy dish...and it is delicious!!! I made one small adjustment. I sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on top of the Parmesan topping to add just a touch of texture. My dinner guests were delighted. I paired it with a romaine/ tomato/ avacado/ mozzarella salad, a porcini mushroom risotto and a crisp, cool Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay. That will become a go-to menu for me in the future.

WOW. This is absolutely delicious. Best sauce I have ever had for halibut or any white fish.  It was Alaskan Halibut ($26 a pound) so I could not chance broiling. I baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then added sauce and broiled for 5 minutes. Perfect. I recommend this recipe.

Great recipe and very easy.  Added a touch of garlic and kept remaining ingredients the same  Baked for 17 minutes  at 375 degrees, then broiled for 3 minutes.  Hubby hates fish but loved this recipe and was looking for more.  He asked for the recipe for one of his cooking nights.

Next time I will reduce the butter (it was swimming a little) but really great flavor. Will do it again. I also baked it for 12 minutes at 375, then broiled at the end.

Was lovely, baked it and then put under broiler fir last 5 minutes.  Used red onion as it was the only onion I had on hand.  I might have over cooked it though.  Would watch closer next time!

To me the combination was strange (fish and cheese with hotsauce) but it turned out really well.  I used a but of mustard in my buttery paste and it turned out delightful!

I would definitely add bread crumbs to the topping because my topping just melted off the fish.  The addition of breadcrumbs should help keep the topping on the fish.

I didn't add a thing, but the pictures show some used cracked peppercorns and perhaps capers.  I think those would add a little pizzazz, but it was perfect as is.  Next time, I might try to take a little fat off the recipe by mixing some Greek yogurt with the mayo.

DELICIOUS!! And easy. I added some fresh dill from my garden to the sauce. As the comments suggested I baked for 15min at 375 C, then broiled. My boyfriend ate it flake by flake because he wanted to “savour every bite.” LOL Will definitely make this again.

I've made this several times and it's always a big hit.  Even Hubby loves it and he normally won't eat fish.  Tonight I added some rockfish to the broiler with the halibut and topped both with the parm mixture.  Hubby and Grandkids ate it all up and asked for more!

I didn’t change anything except that I
used the lemon zest  before I squeezed the lemon. My husband thought that I bought it already made from a good restaurant. He cant believed that I made it myself . He ate almost the whole serving for 3 adults . That’s how much he loved it .

I followed the recipe.  I took someone's suggestion to cook for 20 mins at 425, which worked out because i was also cooking a side dish.  I used my meat thermometer to check the temp and it came out perfectly!  The sauce is delectable!  Definitely a show stopper impressive dish with not much effort.

Easy and using familiar ingredients, this is an excellent sauce recipe, which can be used for many mild/firm fishes (as well as chicken, tofu and - especially - pasta). 
Cooks can tweak it to suit their tastes. (I used Asiago instead of Parmesan, and chives instead of scallions, simply because that's what was on hand.) I will add more "zingy" stuff next time, but the overall result should be very pleasing to most palates.

We liked this recipe. We made a couple of changes, but nothing drastic. We used some seafood seasonings on the filet instead of salt (still used pepper). The biggest mod was we split the mayo with Dijon mustard (Grey Pupon, Country Dijon). This added a little more "spicey" to the concoction and we liked the way it turned out. We'll definitely be using this one again.... It was a

Delish. Had to make subs for what I had on hand, but you can tell this would be delicious either way. Made with 1 lb. haddock, so I halved the recipe using 1 tbsp margarine and a drizzle of olive oil instead of butter; rice vinegar and lemon pepper seasoning instead of lemon juice. My fish was still a little frozen still so I baked it at 425 for about 10 min. (seasoned with salt/pepper), then broiled it with the sauce. So buttery, savory and yummy. And quick and easy! A keeper for sure.

This was so good!  Both I husband and I loved it.  I didn't change anything except that I baked it at 400 for 15 minutes (my halibut pieces were very thick) , checked with a fork to see if it was nice and flaky, then broiled for a little less than 2 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious... I did everything as instructed, except I baked for about 20 minuets covered with foil then broiled for about 10 minuets with sauce and uncovered. I got lucky and my butcher had fresh halibut so mine was larger and thicker than what is more commonly available.  After eating I must say the green onions were absolutely essential to the sauce... if it’s made with shredded parm, real mayo, and real butter you can’t go wrong... it’s amazing... very good recipe! 

Edit: keep in mind many (most) people aren’t very skilled in the kitchen... sorry but it’s true... don’t pay attention to most of the negative reviews I guarantee most complaints are caused by the chefs lack of ability, not the dish as it is intended.

Wow, really tasty!  Halibut pieces were pretty thick so had to drop the oven track for awhile as the top was getting overdone, so it took a few minutes longer, but topping was enough to really add to the taste of the fish without overpowering it.  New favorite way to cook halibut!

Simple and very tasty. Cheesy but not too cheesy. I think if I make it again I will omit the salt. Baked it at 375 since the broiler on the oven wasn't cooperating.

I made this with smoked halibut otherwise stuck to the original recipe. Dish very tangy and was to die for, I'm still salivating. Can't wait to have the second half tomorrow.

I made it!  My family eats fish for protection-not enjoyment.  They have asked that this be a regular on the menu.  Cooked in AGA stove at 350-375 for 15 minutes - no broiler- the sauce was slightly brown and delicious.  Halibut about 1 1/2 inch thick.  Used Outerbridges rum hot sauce..

Heavenly is definitely how you describe this dish.  This dish has been a staple in our house for years!  Tastes like something you would get in a fancy restaurant.  It's a flavor bomb.

I will absolutely make this again. I followed some of the tips in the comments (cover with foil and bake at 375F for 15 minutes and then broil with topping) and it was amazing. I also used lime juice rather than lemon since that's what I had at the time. Yum!

This was delicious and easy! I probably could have made 3/4 of the recipe and had plenty of sauce. I put a lot more dill in than called for - I just eyeballed it but about 3 tbsp I think. Served with green salad and basmati rice. Yummy!

Friends gave us fresh Halibut from Alaska so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  OMG, it was fantastic!  My husband said it was as good as any restaurant.  After reading all the reviews, I decided to bake mine.  I will definitely lower the oven temp next time and cut bake time by a couple minutes.  I added panko breadcrumbs on top and it gave the fish a nice crunch.  Because I didn't have green onions on hand, I used one shallot minced and it was perfect.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Super easy to make and yummy!  I like the parmesan, lemon flavour.  I would use way less butter next time though, maybe just 2 tablespoons.

This is simple, elegant, and awesome. I recommend following it strictly in terms of content and quantities but you may have to adjust the time under the broiler based on thickness of the fillet. I bought my Alaska fresh halibut at Costco and it is very thick so 8 minutes is about half what it takes. The topping is excellent and even with the thick fillet it was enough. This is fit for company. I served it with the simple orzo recipe from Allrecipes and with garden fresh garlic green beans (another Allrecipes hit). Easily a $40 meal at a fine restaurant (well...before wine anyway!)

UPDATE: We had leftovers so I scraped the topping off and made fish tacos with lime and cilantro over the fish (from another site). It was to die for and you would never have know that they were leftovers or they had been cooked with parm, etc.

Definitely did take the suggestion to bake it instead of just under the broiler.  I did put it under the broiler for only a couple minutes, and after I put the topping on the halibut.  Doubled the sauce too.

Excellent! Big hit with the fam. Recommended adjustments: Use fresh grated Parmesan. Bake at 375 for 15 min, then broil for about 5 min until browning begins. Season before baking. Add dill weed if out of green onion

Yummy!! I grilled the fish on foil - my cut was very thick so I cooked it on indirect heat at 350 for 20 minutes and then direct heat at 400 for 15 minutes. The topping was nice and crispy!

My family really enjoyed this dish which is amazing since they are not big fish fans (other than salmon).  My husband even had seconds which is unheard of when I'm serving fish.  I used fresh Basa instead of Halibut as fresh Halibut is very expensive here.
I followed the recipe except sprinkled salt and breadcrumbs on fish as well as the other ingredients.  I baked at 400 degrees until fish was just flaky, added topping, then broiled.  Delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good when you put the sauce back on the fish when you serve it. Baked rather than broiled, because I have had problems with my ovens broiler.

We didn't have parmesan so we substituted for a sharp cheddar.  We also didn't have any hot sauce, but the sharpness of the cheddar made up for that in flavor.  We also didn't use any salt because the cheddar made up for that too.  All in all, very good, and added a great flavor to an otherwise bland fish.  It turned out a bit too runny, and when I make it again, I'll use less butter.

Made this with a thick piece of fresh halibut and used other reviewers' suggestion to bake at 350 then just brown the top under broiler for last couple minutes. Think this technique works best with thick pieces of halibut. To gauge time watch for fish to lose raw look and take on whiter color then use fork to test for flakiness.  With halibut, more is not better. When over-cooked it has an off taste and gets tough.

I love this recipe!!!
However I changed it a little bit and did it Ryan's way.
I souse vide the halibut for 50min, put on a baking sheet and put that yummy butter mixture on it.  
Broiled it for 3 min

I also souse vide some asparagus with salt, pepper, butter, and parm cheese.
I put that on the baking sheet with the fish when I broiled it.

OMG!!!!!

Yummy! Our family loved this! Used finely diced red onion instead of green (didn't have any green), sriracha for the hot sauce, and vegannaise for the mayonnaise.   Our entire family LOVED it! Me, husband, 9 year old, and 6 year old. All gobbled it up, every last morsel.

Very good, however, it was a tad salty.  Perhaps it was the cheese I used.  Next time I will leave out the salt and try to find a less salty cheese.  Apart from that, the fish was perfect.

I recently purchased Alaskan Halibut from VitalChoice.com (excellent btw) very natural and nutritious and made this recipe.  I made a few changes to the recipe though and it was absolutely delicious!!! I prepared the Parmesan mixture in a separate bowl and  I used all organic ingredients (Kates Butter, 365 Mayo, etc.).  I covered/soaked the fish top and bottom with the Parmesan mixture and let it sit for 10 minutes while the oven was heating up.  I baked the fish in the mixture at 400 degrees for 13 minutes in a glass baking dish and then I broiled it for the last 2 minutes. My fish was about 1" thick. This recipe was absolutely delicious!!! I will make it again and keep it as one of my all time favorites! Please note, No need to add salt with the Parmesan Cheese, otherwise could end up tasting too salty, fyi. I did add a little pepper to the mixture. A definite keeper!!!

I'm definitely making this again.  Simple, easy, quick.  The part that took the most effort was chopping those green onions.  So flavorful, kept the fish super moist.

This is the ONLY way I make halibut! Found this recipe years ago and I save it for when ever we get fresh halibut.  You can add more hot sauce or follow the recipe. Either way this recipe is in my "best way to cook halibut" file

It was good, didn't have any green onions - next time I will double the topping, as we had steamed cauliflower and broccoli with it and everyone loved dipping their veggies in the topping!

Awesome recipe. I made the dish just the way it was instructed.
I've always wondered why people rate these recipes, when they slaughter them with their own renditions. Either" you don't have any taste or you don't have any taste!"
Thx Chellebelle!

I used Red Fish, since that is what I catch and it is a thick white fillet and it came out perfect.  Don't change a thing on the recipe.

You wouldn't think fish and cheese would work, but this recipe is decadent and delicious. I pre-seasoned the halibut, added a little dill to the parmesan topping, and a splash of white wine in the baking dish. My servings were thick so I took the advice from the most helpful positive review and baked at 425 for about 20 mins, and then 5 minutes under the broiler to brown. I always get rave reviews with this dish. My dining guest tonight said it was the best fish she ever had.

I followed another reviewer and baked at 375 until it flaked easily. This is my husbands favorite (and now only) way he'll eat halibut, very tasty

This is an excellent and easy recipe.  I made as written and loved the flavor!  I will make this recipe again although I will add a little more parmesan before the final broiling.  My personal taste....Thank you for the wonderful recipe :)

A new family favorite! Substituted Miracle Whip for the mayo and lime juice instead of lemon. The lime juice gave it that extra little kick! Served over a bed of homemade fresh linguini with  BBQ corn. A truly wonderful dish!

It was flaky, moist delicious dish. I didn't broil the halibut because it's too hot to turn on oven, instead I used my Adventium oven. Takes less time does not heat up the kitchen.  Looking forward to making this again. Thank you for recipe.

Very quick, easy weeknight dinner. I never made halibut before but they had it fresh in the market so I tried it. It was delicious, my husband loved the fish. It was moist and tender. I will make again soon.

The taste of this halibut reminds me of a dish that would be served at a fine seafood restaurant. I added a garlic seasoned salt blend just because I love garlic and finished it with a sprinkling of chopped parsley though the dish out of the broiler was very appealing.  The halibut was caught off of the Oregon coast last week (and frozen). I will make this again! Oh yes - and used finely chopped red onion as I did not have green onion handy.

Yum yum yum! Don't like fish, loved this! Doubled sauce. 375 for 15 & broil 5 minutes.  Sooooooooo good! Highly recommend.  Seasoned fish with s&p&lemon juice,  flipped for broil & added sauce. Did put 3 to 4 generous dollops of tapitillo in sauce. Seriously yum!

I made just two servings of this recipe, subbing tilapia for the halibut, and I did use more green onions than called for and subbed a little white wine for the lemon juice.  My biggest deviation was in the cooking method.  I spread the parmesan mixture on the fish and covered and refrigerated it until dinner.  I baked this uncovered in individual baking dishes that I had placed on a baking sheet in case of splattering.  I baked this for 25 minutes and the fish flaked perfectly.   I also popped it under the broiler to give the top a little more color.  I was glad I had used the individual baking dishes because the topping melted considerably, but was contained.  Just before serving I topped each with some toasted panko crumbs for a little crunch.  This was quite good and we both enjoyed it.  I prefer this baking method to broiling and would do it the same way again.

This recipe was fantastic! My whole family loved it and asked to make a larger amount next time so we could have leftovers. The sauce is the bomb and I have also made it with cod and am trying this recipe tonight with salmon. Yummo

This is one of those recipes that is fast, tasty, and easily modified.   Any white fish that needs something added works here, even those frozen fillet of fish found in all grocery stores.  I now just eyeball the ingredients, always using fresh Parmesan and lemon, and sometimes reducing the mayo or butter to watch the fat content.

Following reviewers advice I followed the recipe for the most part added much more hot sauce and pepper.  Put a think layer of sauce Cooked at 375 for 10 minutes then flipped and put more on top.  Only had three pieces so didn't use all the sauce.  Broiled for 6 minutes until it browned and served with rice and a salad.  Yummmmmm will be making again.

So delicious but I did modify the cooking times a bit. I baked the fish (with the topping on it)  in a dish covered in foil at 375 for 15 minutes. I then uncovered the fish and broiled it for another 10 minutes. It was absurdly delicious. *I also only used one tbsp of mayo rather than three and left out the lemon until it was time to serve- then used a ton of it as we love lemon. I feel there was a LOT of butter for this amt. of fish, so I'll definitely reduce it next time, too. The ingredients were spot on- just needed a bit tweaking. Yummy!

Great Recipe.  I have a food allergy to citrus; removed the lemon juice.  Added garlic powder and dill.  Delicious.  I definitely will make again.

I am lactose intolerant and subsittuted  a dairy free butter, and a vegan mayonaise and a raw organic cheddar instead of parm. cheese.   I can tolerate the organic  raw cheeses! I baked it like another person did on this site and broiled at the end. It was delicious and will make it again!!

I thought it was excellent!  We all loved it.  I did add capers and baked at 375 for 15 minutes rather than boiling.  Will add this to our faves for sure.

YUM!!  My filets came from a fishing excursion in Alaska and were alot thicker, so I had to change it up for them to flake.  The broiler would never cook them through so they were baked at 400 for about 25 min, then added the sauce and baked for about another 10 min.  I was worried that they were still a little soft, so I added some Italian bread crumbs on top, like a casserole, and baked for another 5 min.  My family (total fish haters) LOVED it.  Thank you for the recipe!

1/16 I used 5 tilapia fillets and they tasted fishy, but the topping was out of this world.  I baked the fish for 12 min at 375, topped it,  then broiled for a few minutes.  I left out the hot sauce.
1/19 I topped the fish before baking and broiling  and they still turned out great.

We aren't big on fish, but really loved this. However, watch the broiler once you add mixture, it truly takes only a couple minutes, but it made a mess, smokes out the house

Just made this tonight and thought it was great! I added a few drops of hot sauce after the fact and maybe should have added it the sauce mix before hand. This is a flavorful sauce that can be used on anything, and is non-dairy. I've memorized it for future uses!

My husband, son and I ALL rate this a 5 star yummy halibut recipe. OH but I made some adjustments; 1/2 the butter & cheese and 2 Tbls instead of 3 of the mayo. Full amounts of lemon juice & green onions and an extra shake or two of Trader Joe's Jalapeno hot sauce (our family favorite) Will make again for sure! Especially for company. This was quick, easy & delicious!

I was only making it for me so I halved the recipe and it turned out great! Delicious and easy.  My side dishes were a baked (microwaved) potato with skin on - cut in half and then mashed with fork and then drizzled with butter and spices.  Browned on both sides in a hot iron skillet starting with potato skin side down 1st so the butter and spices soak in, then brown and flip to brown and crisp the "soft" side of potato (if desired).  Sprinkle with grated cheese and broil to melt cheese...and then a side of steamed broccoli.

This was really good.  I used red snapper since that was what I had and it was delicious.  My husband said it was the best fish I've cooked.

This was excellent. I finely grated fresh Parmesan Reggiano, skipped the butter, used Red Hot and added Old Bay. I didn't measure a thing, so I'm sure I used a lot more Parm and pepper sauce. I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes (very thick filets), I put the topping on in the beginning, so it browned nicely when finished. Hubs eats fish but it isn't his fave but he mentioned he enjoyed it! I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

The sauce is good, but it overpowered the flavor of the halibut. If you don't really care for the taste of fish, this is the perfect sauce.

I have made this recipe a few times now, and the results are consistently delicious.  I don't cook, as a general rule- I'm not comfortable with it and don't enjoy it.  This recipe is simple enough not to stress me out, and turns out excellent food.  I use whatever white fish I can find at the supermarket that's relatively inexpensive- cod, the last few times- and I make a simple, neutral spiced rice to go with it.  The sauce out of the bake pan is great over the rice.  This recipe has been extremely helpful to me, because it's a simple, easy meal I can prepare that everyone I am cooking for enjoys.

Yum! I loved all of the flavors, even though I'm not a big fan of green onions or mayo. Super fancy for guests. The only thing was that I had to cook my fish a LOT longer as I had one thick filet fresh from Alaska. I even had to turn the oven on because broil wasn't cutting it. I will definitely make this again - I will probably start in the oven and finish on broil.

The halibut was perfectly cooked, I added panko breadcrumbs to the mayo/cheese mixture and this added a nice crunch to the topping.  Kids liked it a lot too!

I followed mixing exactly and baked it @ 325 for about 15 mins and broiled it another 2-3 minutes until sauce began to brown on top. INCREDIBLE is what I have to say about it! You can't go wrong with this one.

Absolutely delicious! I am normally not a fan of halibut, but my husband loves it. He said it's the best he's had. I put the sauce on it before cooking and baked it at 375 for 15 minutes and another few minutes under the broiler to brown a bit. super moist, flakey and tender! I will definitely be making this again!

Really enjoyed making this. Grocery store only had one filet of halibut so I paired the dish with mahi mahi. As some others suggested, I baked for 15-20 minutes, applied the sauce, then broiled for 3-5 minutes. I highly recommend this recipe!

I'm trying to cook more fish for my family and when I read the recipe and the reviews, I thought I'd try it tonight. Wow!!  Really delicious. I made a couple of changes because of what I had in hand. A couple of days ago, I mixed mayonnaise and a bit of mustard as a vegetable dip and there was some left, so I used it for the mayonnaise. I also added a bit of Old Bay seasoning. Other than that, I made as directed. Very good. I did have to bake the fish a bit longer than the recipe called for, to achieve "flaky". My family is not a fish eating family, but they loved this recipe.

YUMMALIZIOUS! I used mozzarella for the cheese cause I don't have any Parmesan. unfortunately and it was still delicious! Must do! Plus I can see this being paired up with salmon, cod or flounder!

This was delicious!!  My 4 year old daughter couldn't get enough - that says a lot!  I made these exactly as the recipe stated however I preheated my oven to 425 degrees and then baked the halibut at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes (I also used a large filet).  I then broiled it for just a quick bit although it probably didn't really need it.  This was a big hit with my whole family so it's in the recipe box for future use!

Used this for some of the Alaskian Halibut I caught myself. Easy and delisious. Forwarding the recipe to the amazing cook at the Tanaku Lodge in Elfin Cove Alaska. A vacatio experience of a lifetime!

I followed the advise of others and baked at 350 degrees for about 20 mins and than under the broiler for a few. I will add to make sure fish is dry. My only complaint is that the topping had a gritty texture after but it might have been my fault. Have only tried once but will try again. Flavor was great.

I was only making a small portion ( about a pound) so I just used 2 Tbs mayo, 1 Tbs lemon juice, no onions and enough parm to create a slight paste. I sprinkled cayenne pepper on top and baked for 15 min at 450. It was great. My husband loved it and wants me to add it to the rotation.

This works great with any white firm-fleshed fish like amberjack, grouper, halibut, cod (my favorite), flounder, etc.  I also add some hot pepper sauce to the topping.  YUM!  -bamaj1

The key to making this recipe a success is making sure the Parmesan mixture nice and crusty before serving!  I also wondered if a touch of horseradish would add an interesting twist to this delicious recipe?

Love it!  Quick, Easy and Delicious.  I used Cod in place of the Halibut and baked in the oven on 350 for 15 minutes, then added the scrumptious topping (minus the onion, we don't do onion in our house) then Broiled on Hi for a couple of minutes until it got that beautiful bubbly brown color.  Most definitely a keeper recipe!

I’ve done this one half a dozen times.  It is great.  It works best with halibut and not so good with cod, surprise surprise.  I use more like a quarter cup of butter and half a cup or more of parmesan.  One tsp of lemon juice is enough.  A quarter of a cup of bread crumbs as suggested by a reviewer adds to the dish.

Very tasty and simple to make. Even the kids loved it! I served over angel hair pasta tossed with garlic olive oil a tad of butter a pinch of salt and capers. I added dill and minced onion and replaced chives for the chopped green onions because that's what I had in my garden. I cooked on 375 for 15 minutes because my piece of fish was fairly thick.

if you fight to get your kids to eat fish, this recipe is for you! my grandkids loved it as well as the rest of us which just never happens it is fantastic! next time I make it I will double the recipe for the sauce as we were all scrambling to get the last drop out of the pan. the only thing I added was a little salt and pepper to the sauce and it was perfect. this will go on my monthly rotation for sure!

Oh my god this was good, I added extra hot sauce, and I melted the butter before mixing.  Amazingly good! Oh yeah and I sprinkled a few left over crumbs of  red, green and white tortilla chips in the last minute for show. It looks gourmet!

My family loved this dish! I also baked it for 15 minutes at 375.  Perfect and my halibut was about 1" thick.  Then moved to broiler for 2.  I added a few shakes of hot sauce and would recommend doubling the sauce and putting 1/2 in a ramekin and baking it so you could dish more on top of the fish once finished baking!!  Oh, also salt and pepper on fish before baking.  Definitely a keeper!!

So good! Quick, easy and delicious. Easy enough for a weeknight dinner but delicious enough to serve to company...if you're willing to share! I cooked it on the grill just like when I do Blackened Halibut minus the Cajun spices and didn't cook it all of the way so that when I put it under the broiler it still came out moist. I also added a sprinkle if breadcrumbs over the top...near perfection!

Super easy and tastes like a restaurant quality dish. I cooked in a 425 degree oven for 10-15 min. I finished it off under the broiler for another minute. Your time will depend on the thickness of your halibut. I also did a very light sprinkle of Tony Chacheres on the filets.

So good that my one-year-old devoured an adult-size serving -- I literally had to stop her! I am making this again, one week later, because she has been asking for "feesh?' everyday since I served this!  She has eaten fish many times before, but has never gotten so excited about it!  Other than eyeballing the measurements, I followed the recipe exactly.  Wonderful!

Just made it for my 7 year old's birthday dinner.  He said it was the best fish dish I've made yet!  So, if a picky 7 year and his 3 year old brother & sister loved it, it's a winner for me.  Very mellow taste that compliments the halibut.  Very good.

Great base. I put some flavor and a healthier approach. Organic mayo, lemon, and green onion. Bake at 425 for 15 minutes then broil on 500 until cheesy brown. It is awesomely delicious....

Delicious!  Seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, and a splash of lemon juice and baked for 8 minutes at 475 since we had another dish going in the oven at the same temperature.  Then put the topping on, sprinkled with some whole wheat bread crumbs, and put back into the oven for 3 minutes.  Perfection!  Our halibut portions had the skin on, and the fish came right off of the skin once it had been baked.

I added bread crumbs and capers. I cut my halibut into  about 2" x 4" piece  baked in oven for about 10 minutes then spooned the mixture over top and broiled for about 2 minutes. It was wonderful, I couldn't have had a better dish if at a star restaurant. Had my 8 year old nephew and 11 year old son ask for seconds even. Great recipe

FABULOUS.  I had no idea what to do with Halibut and I made this and it is just as good as everyone says.  I did bake it, not broil it, but other than that I followed the recipe and it is perfect.

My boyfriend called it EPIC.  I resurrected some old halibut I had in the freezer for god knows how long.  I used shredded parmesan and white onions because that's what I had on hand.  And did not use hot sauce.  Still it turned out awesome.

I made it as described, but I put it in a 400 degree oven for about 14 minutes because I was roasting carrots alongside it.  It was good, and everyone eating it enjoyed it (except for my 3-year-old, who said, "I don't like these eggs" LOL).  I gave it 4 stars because I found the flavor good, but not amazing.

Very good recipe everyone loves it. 

To add a little flavor I included 3 table spoons of minced garlic.

I broil it on middle rack doing it on top just seems to get things to hot and actually broke a casserole dish doing this.

I have used this recipe as is many times with halibut as well as grouper and snapper. It was delicious on all 3! I put the sauce on at the beginning and broiled it the entire time. I will try it the way the recipe suggests, baking first, turning the fish and broiling it for a few minutes to compare. Yes it is rich, but is so delicious, I think it is worth the calories! Making it with fresh halibut as we speak!

This recipe sounded like it might be too rich, but in fact it was perfectly delicious.  Everyone raved.  I added about 1/4 c. bread crumbs and a dash or two of hot sauce.  Also, I put the topping on the fish at the beginning (rather than baking the fish first).  Served over brown/wild rice, which pairs nicely with the creaminess of the topping.  Excellent dish.

I made this for company last night and we all raved about it. I only had 1/4 cup of Parmesan so added a 1/2 cup of Feta.  This was simple and so delicious.  The sauce is heavenly.  I bought a 1.5 # pound filet at Costco and it was flaky and just perfect.  Made 4 nice servings.  Will repeat this one over and over.

I tried this recipe as-is and it was perfect, save for the omission of hot pepper sauce to cater to my husband.  yummy!  Keep in mind that halibut is a subtle tasting fish and so the flavour profile of the topping is not going to be super strong either.  Quite the contrary, it's got the right amount of tartness/tanginess.

This is just Mmmmmmm!  I used Mahi Mahi as it was on sale and omitted the hot pepper sauce as I didn't have any and this was amazing!  This is my go to recipe when I want a little Mahi Mahi.  I will have to try it with Halibut at some point but can't see how it won't taste yummy!

I've never had a lot of success with fish and I was feeling a little apprehensive because Halibut is so expensive but this dish was easy to prepare and tasted amazing.

This was wonderful! My hubby who dislikes fish, loves this. I was unable to find Halibut and used Mahi-Mahi instead. I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce and did not add the additional salt. I baked at 475 for about 12 minutes and finished cooking on broil. I sprinkled this with Panko once the parmesan mixture was spread. This would go perfect with any white fish but, I will always use Mahi-Mahi. I will make this again. Thank you so much for the recipe and the tips.

How can something so simple be so good?! Amazing! I made this with cod. I used Greek yogurt in place of mayo to lighten it up. Next time I'll use less butter since it really doesn't need much. I baked at 425 and broiled for a few minutes until bubbly and browned.

An extremely delicious topping, probably for most fish.  I found that this recipe tends to make more than I need to cover my fish.  I'd say some may find it slightly salty, so maybe go light with the coating at first.  I used it with Haddock fish, broiled and it was so good.  Definitely watch the fish while broiling. I found that literally an extra minute too long makes the fish slightly tough.

Made this for my family last night and they loved it (the kids are 12, 11 and 9). I had no intention of changing the recipe but realized once it was too late that I was out of green onion and unbelievably, lemon. So I just used a little minced cooking onion and a splash of lime. It was excellent and easy. I look forward to making it again with the correct ingredients. Thanks for giving us another excuse to eat fish!

I made this for my son's birthday and everyone loved it.  I always try to make recipe "as is" first, but in this case I didn't have enough butter and my store didn't have halibut.  Doubled recipe but only used 1/4 cup butter and it was fine.  Used rockfish as substitute and it was fantastic.  And even saved money since rockfish is cheaper!    Served over a bed of fresh angel hair pasta and grilled zuchinni.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a good recipe, we changed the hot sauce to red pepper flakes and we loved to spice. I would cut the butter in half though, 1/4 cup is to much.

I baked this and broiled for 2min...used celery juice to replace lemon and did not use butter at all.  IT was fabulous!  My honey loved it!  I will try it again...soon!

NUMMY!! My daughter made this with my home-made failed mayonnaise [it didn't emulsify]. Still had wonderful flavour. DELICIOUS! And easy to make!

Absolutely Fantastic. My family asked when we could have it again before they finished dinner! This will go into regular rotation. This recipe is quick and easy and tastes better than some I have had dining out. Perfect week night meal.

Fantastic recipe.  I eased back on the mayo and used smart balance butter to reduce calories.  I also added ground almonds on top with the topping for a crunchy topping.  Wow!!

Wow, I really LOVED this one.  I used halibut as described.  I added some dried parsley and a little "Mrs. Dash" Really tasty and great for an easy meal for company.  Easy, tasty, quick!

I love fish and I loved this recipe.  For people that don't like fish, but want to like it, you should try this recipe.  I couldn't even taste the halibut fish flavor when it was coated with this yummy sauce.  I would definately do this recipe again.  And, from prep to eating is literally 15 minutes.

Well I am STUFFED!! I ate a whole huge piece because this sauce was soooo good!!! I didn't measure things out exactly, but I don't think it really changed the taste. I also baked it and then only broiled it at the end. I am going to try this with salmon or steelhead next. yummo!!

Wonderful recipe.  Not fond of fish but my family is.  I soaked a white fish in milk for a few hours first to take away fishiness.  Will definitely make this again.

I have made this 5 times already. It is a big hit in my house. Very easy to put together and makes the Halibut we caught in Alaska extra special when we serve it to out family and friends.

Wow, I'm not a fish person at all, but wanted to try something different.  This recipe was amazing!  I had no idea seafood could taste so good.  It was so tasty I'm thinking about making it again tonight, two days in a row!  Thank you for sharing

I use this website quite often. I only just became a member so I could write a rave review for this recipe. We are not big fish eaters. Halibut is one we eat because it doesn't taste "fishy". This recipe was extraordinary. Definately a keeper.

I made this last night, followed the recipe to a "T" except for adding 1 T of minced garlic, it couldn't have tasted any better.  I doubled everything and there was not a drop left!  Thank you for the great recipe!

It was good and easy to make.  We had to cook the fish a bit longer than the recipe called for (it was a big fillet), and we used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo - but it was too tangy.  I think the Mayo would have been better.

Meant to post a review before this - I've been making this for a few months on a regular basis. We have always grilled our halibut - but no more. My husb only wants it prepared this way. I could feed him this 3 times a week and he would ask for more.  I've made this for company as well..huge success!  I didn't change anything on this recipe - fabulous just as it is!

Wonderful!  I doubled the sauce like some other reviews recommended and added extra green onions because we love them, but it would have been great regardless.  I gave the recipe to my sister, who struggles cooking anything, and even she had success. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Excellent, wonderful, fantastic!  It is hard to get my kids to eat fish.  This recipe added enough "cheesy" flavor for them to really enjoy it and finish it!  My husband is a fish lover and said it was excellent as well.  :)  I didn't change a thing from the original recipe.

Always looking for halibut recipes, as we eat a lot of it in Alaska.  This was wonderful!  Very rich, so we probably won't have it too often, but definately a new favorite!  It was very good with rice to soak up the juices!

Not bad. The parmesan and mayo make for a strong flavor for a delicate fish, some will like it and some won't.

The cheese topping tasted savory and tangy like tartar sauce, a great compliment to a blank canvas like halibut.  I seasoned the halibut with 'Its a dilly' and pepper like someone else mentioned, I think it helped balance the cheese flavor.  Also added some cheddar because I didn't have enough parmesan.

I was really disappointed with this recipe, especially with how many glowing reviews it got.  For me, the flavor just wasn't great.  I thought I'd give it a shot but after making it, I'll never try another recipe for fish that calls for mayo or miracle whip, it ruins a wonderful piece of fish like halibut or salmon.  Thanks for the recipe, but having grown up with good Alaskan seafood, I'll stick with my dad's method.

Very good. Used Alaskian Halibut.  Doubled the sauce, cooked at 350 for 15 min then another 3 min in the broiler. Serve with spinach next time.

Our family loved this recipe.  I replaced the butter for cream cheese and added about 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese.  Very good.  One of my children hates fish, but asked for seconds on this.

I tried the recipe as suggested and  was very disappointed with it. I guess I should have know that with all the "glucky"  mixture of cheese, sour cream and mayo, that this could potentially ruin the clean and healthy choice of cooking fresh halibut. I would choose another halibut recipe the next time.

Didn't have any halibut in the freezer, so I used haddock. Don't think it made any difference. Tasted great. Went well with garlic mashed potatoes.

Delicious recipe! Complemented the fish perfectly and loved how the mixture bubbled up under the broiler. I didn't have any hot sauce, so I used some hot pepper flakes instead and they worked quite well.

Thanks, this recipe is awesome. I'm kind of a noob to the kitchen, and already know of some things I could've done better. But even for a guy like me cooking it, the kids ate it right up. That says a lot with my kids. ;)

My changes:
Less butter, no green onions, extra hot sauce, no salt.  Bake at 400 for 20 minutes, broil at the very end...

I used very thick halibut filets, so next time I make this, I will double the topping and put a layer in the pan underneath the fish as well as on top.


ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!

Really good to me but hubby thought it a little too salty. I doubled the sauce to put over noodles too but it was too much. I may half the butter/mayo next time and see what I get since I have a freezer full of halibut to use up.

Easy recipe with great flavor.  I liked using chives instead of green onions.  I imagine this would be great on any fish - especially white fish.  Easy to scale up and down for servings.

This was really, really good. I've never made fish this way before and we just loved it. My daughter is very particular about fish, and she was very impressed. She asked me to save this recipe so we could make it again. Thanks!!

I've never tasted fish like this. I really enjoyed the flavor combination, but I added way more green onions than what was needed because I only cooked one filet. Next time I'll cut back on the green onions.
