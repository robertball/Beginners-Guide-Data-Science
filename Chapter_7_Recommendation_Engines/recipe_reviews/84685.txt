This made for a delicious and hearty meal. I used canned beans as I wanted to make the recipe the same day. I had some chicken broth I needed to use, so I added that with the water. I have rosemary growing in my kitchen, so fresh for dried was a no-brainer.  I served this with Rosemary Herb Bread (from this site). I'll definitely make this again!

Perhaps I was wanting something different, but this was basically really thick chicken noodle soup sans noodles but with beans instead.  I didn't think the beans went particularly well with this, but if I used chicken stock instead of water and added more salt it would have been a delicious soup.  My husband and children did not like this at all.  Will not make this again!

This has a nice flavor.  I didn't thicken it due to time constraints.  I also forgot to soak the beans so I left them out.  I'll bet some sort of pasta would be good in this, but I didn't think of that until we were eating it.  I put everything in the crockpot and cooked it for 6-7 hrs. on med-hi.  Good recipe.  Thanks Sahara836!

The kids loved it. Had to add some hot sauce to the adults’ servings just to give it a little kick. Put it over elbow macaroni and everyone loved it.

This is a great alternative to a beef stew. I did not have white beans so I cut up a sweet potato and used a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes and lots of fresh rosemary and veggie broth instead of water and cut the onions back to 1 small onion (that is all I had on hand) it was delicious, my husband really liked it as well.  I will definitely make this again!

A good winter stew.  Used canned beans instead of dried to save time.  Also crushed the rosemary and sauteed the vegetables in olive oil before adding the canned tomatoes.  Next time I'll cook the chicken breasts whole and remove them as soon as they are done to avoid overcooking, refrigerating and cubing chicken when cool.  I'll simmer the stew longer to to meld the flavors and add the cut up chicken and drained beans at the end.  Some minced fresh parsley would go well in this dish. Might be interesting to use ground chicken to create a consistency similar to chili.

This worked well for us. I sautéed the onions in a little olive oil before adding the other ingredients. Caramelizes the onions and knocks down their punch a bit. I added a bit more rosemary as the tomatoes tended to over power the flavor all together which wasn't what I was going for. Overall a healthy dish packed with protein and other nutritional value.
