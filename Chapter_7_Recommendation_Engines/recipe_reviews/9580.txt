This recipe needed modifications. After reading the reviews, I altered the recipe to a more standard cookie recipe, and it turned out fine. I substituted 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening, increased the flour to 2 1/4 cups, and baked them for 12 mins. I omitted the peanuts, as the granola I was using contained almonds. We all enjoyed them.

These were some of the worst "cookies" I have ever made.  They spread way too thin when baking and harden to a chewy mess.  Do not bother with these.  I followed the recipe exactly, aside from adding 1 tsp cinnamon.  The dough tasted delicious; the cookies were very promising before they went in the oven.  After about 7 minutes I checked on the first batch because they smelled done.  They were.  Not only were they done and quite dark brown, but the cookies had all spread and made one gigantic, extremely thin cookie conglomerate that covered the baking sheet.  Not impressed.  I put teaspoon fulls of dough on the tray 2 inches apart as indicated in the recipe.  Doing this on two baking trays only used up about half the dough, though, so the yield is off (would be 48 rather than 24 if only teaspoonfuls of dough are used).

These are amazing. I burnt the first batch and my dogs love them too. My daughter eats them for breakfast. Quick and easy to grab on the way out the door.  I omitted the salt but used salted nuts since that was what I had in the cupboard. They are yummy.

I made them as a bar cookie.  The cookies really spread out thin, but if you like a thin crispy cookie you probably would like them that way.  I added a topping of more granola and cut into bars.  They were buttery and moist.

I used Trader Joe brand berry granola and subbed peach schnapps for vanilla (was out). Yum! Yum! Yum! They are so good that it is hard to believe these are actually fairly nutritious!
