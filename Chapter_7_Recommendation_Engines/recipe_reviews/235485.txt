Sweet, spicy and better than I imagined it would taste. I didn't have any chipotle chili powder so I substituted cayenne pepper. Also, I used olive oil instead of butter. My husband loved it and said we should always use this recipe for roasted sweet potatoes. My teen son loved it so much he hugged me after dinner!

Update: 1 July 2016. These are so good when you cut the potatoes in a spiralizer! Very nice change from the usual sweet potatoes. I served these at our Tex Mex Christmas feast and they were a perfect complimet to fajitas and tacos while maintaining a holiday tradition of sweet potatoes on the table. Thanks for sharing the recipe What's For Dinner Mom!

The best baked sweet potato fries I have had!  Like another reviewer,even my husband who isn't keen on s.p. thought they were pretty good. I did decrease salt and pepper a bit but otherwise kept proportions pretty accurate ( used 1/2 recipe for one very large sweet potato).  For Epicure users, I used 2/3  regular chili powder and 1/3 Epicure chipotle chili powder because it is so potent. Good amount of heat for moderate spice people.

Holy moly! I could've just eaten these for dinner!! I used to dislike sweet potatoes, and ONLY eat them when covered in brown sugar, butter & marshmallows. This is my new obsession. I knew they would be great when I swiped a lick of the bowl after I tossed them into the oven.. the seasoning mix alone was yummy. I followed the recipe, but used chili powder (no chipotle powder on hand) and I used foil instead of parchment paper (suggestion: spray the foil! I didn't and they stuck a bit!). I forgot to set the times and took them out when they were tender (no clue how long!). they were firm and nicely roasted on the outside and creamy on the inside. They do have a tiny kick of heat, but it's balanced by the sweet of the brown sugar and potato. These are fantastic!

Made this for recipe group and it is a keeper for sure!!! The description said it all.  Sweet, salty, spicy, and a flash of heat. I had to cut down just a tad on the chipotle as I have a heat wimp in the house. Will be making these again soon! Thanks Wfdm!

I estimated amounts of each spice,as I tested the recipe on a half of a potato for me (single serving), but kept the proportions of the original recipe.  Rather than quartering, I sliced lengthwise into french fry like sizes.  Used olive oil, and forgot I had chipotle powder and subbed chili powder - but the combination of sweet, salty and spicy was amazing. This goes on my repeat list, will definitely impress guests as well.

I took canned adobo (chipotle) peppers and mixed some with the butter when I melted it. Tossed as usual. Fabulous!

We use this for a nice low calorie lunch.  I too used olive oil instead of butter.
Cook's Note:
Use 2 tablespoons chipotle chile powder and 4 tablespoons brown sugar for a spicier version of this dish.

Recipe Group Selection:  04, January 2014 ~ Super yummy and delicious with a touch of heat!  Exactly the way I like baked sweet potatoes.  I made it as written only cutting back for 1 large sweet potato.  My taste buds loved the mixture of the sweet-heat as this potato was going down.  Even my sweet potato disliking hubby tried it as I was raving with each bite.  Guess what?  He liked the skinny pieces.  Said "there is too much sweet potato in the thicker pieces".  Maybe I will be able to convert him yet, if I cut the pieces thin!  Thanks, Jan for sharing your recipe.  I have one more sweet potato to make this again, next week.  Guess I might have to share!

I made these for recipe group and we really enjoyed them. It's a nice flavor blend and I wouldn't want to change the ratio other than maybe a little less sugar. I only used 1/4 of the seasoning and it could take more so I'll try 1/2 the next time. We don't like to hide the natural sweet potato flavor too much so I was being conservative, just knowing our preference. I also think the full amount would not work for us because it would be too hot for me.

I used regular chili powder and these do have a kick, but we loved it. The combination of the sweet brown sugar along with the spicy of the chili powder go great with the sweet potatoes. I used 2 different types of sweet potatoes and 30 minutes were perfect for mine. I did cut them into big fries to go with our sandwiches. Thanks!

The seasoning mix was wonderful, made it exactly as written.  I subbed olive oil for butter.  This was easy and a delicious way to get sweet potatoes on the menu more often!  Thanks for sharing.

Because I was running short on time, I made this recipe exactly as written except for cutting the potatoes into one-inch cubes and roasting at 400 degrees for only 30 minutes.  Oh, my!  A perfect, very tasty, sweet-hot delight!  My husband is begging me to make them again, and again, and again.  The chipotle chili powder offers a unique, smoky flavor that can't be achieved with regular chili powders or cayenne pepper.  Yum!

Way too spicy. We like hot food, but I can't help but think that 1 Tbsp of chipotle pepper is a typo. Also, I took the hint of another reviewer and cut my potatoes into a french fry shape, and they were limp. They never did get crispy. Maybe the key is to leave them in the wedge shape. I have rarely had such a disappointing result from a recipe.

Delish! Butter coats them and add how ever much spice u want, I like lots so they were coated well. After baking they r crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'll be making the spice for my spice rack to always have on hand. Thanks ??

Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS and ADDICTIVE! I did sub olive oil for the butter, only b/c I'm trying to lighten things up here and there, which worked great. I LOVE the flavor of chipotle, but 1 Tbsp. was too much for me (yes, I'm a wimp...the guys loved them as is), though I still couldn't stop eating them, lol. All of the other seasonings were spot on. I served these w/ 2 kinds of dipping sauce, and that was nice, though they really didn't need it. I really cannot wait to get back to the store to get more sweet potatoes...YES, they are that good! Jan, Thanks for another winning recipe that was a huge hit~YUM! :)

This is delicious! The only changes I made are I used regular chili powder and added cayenne for the spice element bc I don't care for chipotle flavor and I used olive oil instead of butter,  otherwise it's perfect.

We were looking for a good chipotle roasted potato recipe.  I found this one, and instead of doing sweet potatoes, I did yukon golds.  We didn't add the brown sugar since we weren't doing sweet potatoes.  The recipe worked perfectly with non sweet potatoes.  The family loved it.

So easy, and so yummy. I used veggie oil instead of butter, and put the cut sweet potatoes directly on the pan and tossed them with the oil. Then I added the spices directly on the pan and tossed to coat; just to save on dishes. Thanks Jan, great recipe!

I reduced the recipe for 2 servings, then followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted olive oil for the butter.  I thought they were delicious, but they were a little too spicy for my husband.  They did not get crispy on the outside, even after being in the oven close to an hour.  I plan to make them again sometime, but will increase the oven temp to 425, hoping for that crispy outside.

Awesome!  This is a keeper. It's a nice change from the cinnamon sugar combo that usually goes with sweet potatoes. I didn't have chipotle chili powder so I just used regular and some cayenne.  It was a little spicy for my husband so I will reduce that a little next time. But otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Great combo of flavors (sweet, salty, spicy)

Cut into fries, and they tasted just like restaurant sweet potato fries!  Used chili powder instead of chipotle, in deference to the kids; left everything else the same.  Baked on convection for about 20 min, tossed with a spatula to avoid sticking, and baked on regular (non-convection) for another 10 min.  Perfect texture, and delicious!

These were definitely a cooked sweet potato side dish rather than baked sweet potato fries.  I wanted to substitute for chipotle chili powder - next time use regular chili powder with just a dash of cayenne (used too much cayenne!).  Would make again but not to go with burgers.

I roasted them at 375°, and the brown sugar burned in the oven. Next time I will try 325° or 350° and cut the wedges thinner to shorten the cooking time.

Sometimes you can eat hot/spicy foods that make you want to go back and  eat more. This is not the case. The spices are  so 
Hot that they overpower the natural sweetness of the potato and the brown sugar  does nothing.
Thank You for sharing your recipe, but this is not for my family.

This was really good, although I did cut the chipotle pepper in half the second time I made it. This is a great way to get my husband to eat sweet potatoes. Suddenly he loves them!

These were just too hot  - not too hot to eat - but the flavors didn't go together for me.  The butter was too rich - maybe baking on a cooling rack placed on top of cookie sheet might help for some.  The brown sugar was just too much sweetness - considering these are "savory" sweet potatoes.  I tried serving them with sour cream to offset the flavor - but that really didn't help.   I do think the idea of combining sweet and hot is a good one - but I will try this again - but with an already blended seasoning mix - like Moroccan, Mexican, Cajun, etc.... with just a tiny bit of white sugar mixed in...and I will use Grapeseed oil instead of butter......So - sorry - I just think the onion, garlic, chipotle, brown sugar, and pepper - were all fighting against each other - instead of combining into a good flavor.

I was afraid of how these would turn out but I must say they were delish!  Quite a bit of heat but my family loved them. I will be cooking them again.

Delicious! I'll probably up the chipotle next time but they were amazing as is. Cut into oven fry shapes instead of rounds. YUM!

What a great mix of sweet and spicy! I cut the sweet potatoes into cubes to get the maximum flavor, and used 3 T. olive oil rather than 5 T. of butter. The whole family enjoyed them.

I followed this recipe to a T accept I did not have the chipotle spice so on went a dash of cayenne and chili powder. Now can someone tell me how to keep them from sticking to the parchment paper??? Otherwise SO good. Definitely saved this recipe!!!

This was very tasty! I didn't have chipotle chili powder, so I just used regular chili powder, and it was great. I imagine it would be even better with chipotle chili powder. I cut the sweet potatoes into chunky fries. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
