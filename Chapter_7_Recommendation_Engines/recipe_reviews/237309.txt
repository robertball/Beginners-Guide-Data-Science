One of the best Italian sauces! So easy to make. I use Peeled San Marzano tomatoes and use my immersion blender to crush them while in the pot.  These tomatoes have the best flavor. I used less water than called for and did not use the baking soda. I added my uncooked Italian meatballs (1 lb each of veal, pork, beef) and cooked for four plus hours.

So easy and so delicious. I was a bit concerned about the amount of water and paste. But I followed the directions and I wouldn't change a thing. I also used San Marzano tomatoes.  This will be a staple in our house for now on.  Thank you. 
*On a side note, passed down by my husbands uncle I put a whole carrot in while it simmers to absorb the acid. Try it.

Delicious.  My first "baking soda" red sauce.  I was careful to add no more than a level teaspoon and it cut the acidity nicely.  My Italian brother in law had seconds!

This recipe was easy to follow! I didn't read correctly to see it was 2 cans of 32 oz so I had 2 cans of 24 oz crushed tomatoes. The sauce still came out really good. I added way too much basil (dry not fresh) and I was a little worried. After simmering for over 2 hours it wasn't overpowering like I thought I would be. I added meatballs to the sauce for the last 20-30 minutes of simmering. This will be my go to for sauce from here on out!!

I have made this for years.  easy to customize if you want.  I usually add some oregano and additional basil.  Sometimes I add crushed red pepper.  Good on its own or fun to switch up. a great all purpose red sauce. Thanks Ignazia Vella

Love this sauce, I make it regularly . I partially pre bake meatballs (so they don’t break up)  ,add them and  add fresh pork ribs and simmer it on the stove for about 6 hours and it is absolutely fantastic. Try it!! You will thank me
