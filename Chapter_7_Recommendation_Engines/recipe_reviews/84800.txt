Fantastico!  A friend served this with ribs at a cookout and I memorized the different tastes and came to this site and did an ingredient search.  Viola... Charro Beans!  The only difference is she used chopped hot dogs in place of the ham and hers had a rough-chopped bell pepper (both of which I prefer and use as well).  DO NOT skip the chipotles - they MAKE this dish with their smokey goodness.  Will be a good side dish for Chilaquilles on this site and of course as a side for ribs!  I LOVE THIS RECIPE.

These beans are excellent, similar to a restaurant favorite.  I used dry beans, used fresh bacon, cut it in small bits and put in the pot with dry beans at start of cooking.  I cooked chorizo just enough to crumble then added to bean pot.  I also add little oregano. I did not have a chipotle, used a jalepeno instead. Takes a little longer to cook but well worth the wait.

I modified this recipe to fit what I had and our taste.  I used 6 strips of bacon 1/2 pound jalepeno sausage cut in 1/4" slices 1 pound of dried pinto beans 1 poblano pepper 1/2 bunch of cilantro 1 teaspoon cumin  I started the beans in a pot of boiling water for 30 minutes and then transfered them to a crock pot and cooked them all day with the garlic, pepper and cilantro. 30 minutes before the beans were finished I reserved 2 cups and mashed them with a potatoe masher returning them to the crock pot, then added all of the other ingredients and cooked it for the final 30 minutes. Of course I put the cooked bacon in the pot as well even though it does not have that in the recipe. I did not remove the garlic or pepper since they cooked in the crock pot all day and pretty much broke into tiny peices.  The pot of beans was devoured and I am going to have to buy another large crock pot so I can double the recipe next time. This is a great recipe since it gives you all kinds of wiggle room to modify it to what you have on hand and your families taste.

I always make refried beans, but this was an awesome recipe.  All I did was in the evening, I used dried beans in a crockpot, added all the ingredients, except the whole garlic cloves (I used minced garlic instead) and I added a can of Rotel, other than that I followed the recipe.  I cooked the meats and added them to the crockpot and let it all cook overnite.  Added some salt & garlic salt the next day and it was ready for lunch.  Ate with cornbread (Golden Sweet Cornbread Recipe) and another day mashed them for some burritos.  WONDERFUL!

FANTASTIC! I used well seasoned ground beef instead of chorizo & I omitted the ham...going w/ a thick cut bacon instead. I added chicken broth when it ran dry, instead of water & let them simmer for about an hour until dinner was ready....adding more broth when necessary.

While I like this recipe, I made a few changes. Starting with fresh pintos, and omitting the bacon. instead I used pork sausage and chorizo for the flavor.  Also added jalapenos, cilantro, and finely chopped garlic and pearl onions.

Nummy!  These turned out just delicious.  The changes I made to the recipe were minor.  After frying the bacon I cooked the onion and sausage in the same pan and then added all the ingredients to a crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours.  I omitted the chili pepper and garlic and added a can of "Fire Roasted Chili Peppers" instead.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added 2 cups of chicken broth to this because I was looking for more of a soup type meal and it turned out really well.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe with exception to adding the ham.  When the beans started to get dry, I added water to the pan where I fried the bacon and sauteed the onion with the chorizo.  It worked great as I was able to get all the flavors from the pan. My husband said these were the best beans he had ever had. My brother was equally impressed and said he could just eat the beans as his meal. Thank you for a great recipe.

Yum! I improvised a bit, and it turned out well. After cooking the chorizo and ontions, I added everything into the crockpot and added water to cover to almost 3/4 the way to the top. I cooked on low for 7 hours on low. We kept sneaking tastes from the crockpot. I did not use a chipolte chili. I used a jalepeno as it was what I had on hand. I did not miss the smokey taste. Add salt while cooking to taste. Enjoy! :-)

Ok I have to give it 4 stars because everyone at my mexican dinner party loved them.  I served with Chicken enchiladas II from this site (amazing by the way).  Personally I was not that crazy about them.  I think it was my mess up though.  I had a friend go to the grocery store for the items and she brought back everything correctly except brown sugar baked ham.  I wanted normal regular ham.  The brown sugar gave it a funky flavor.  The entire batch was gone by the end of the night so I will try to make again.

My whole family said this was the best beans & rice dish I had ever made, and one of them gobbled hers up so quickly she got a belly ache! As an added (healthful) bonus I used a great soy chorizo that I found at my local gourmet market and served the bean/meat mixture on a bed of brown rice. This is something I will make often. Oh, one last bonus- super easy and fairly quick to make.

These were great!  I used dried pintos, soaked overnight, instead of the canned.  Everything fit perfectly into a 4-qt. slow cooker.  It took a little longer to soften than I would've liked (it smelled great, so I was impatient), but the final product was worth the wait.  Fantastic on its own or w/ rice, which made it hearty enough to eat as a meal.  Thanks, P!

I almost followed the recipe! Hard for a chef to follow one completely, right? Instead of chipotle peppers I used seeded jalapeno. I used fresh beans instead of canned and boiled a ham on a bone I had left over from Christmas.  I added about a teaspoon of cumin and two teaspoons of powder. I must say it was wonderful. I then cooked it in a 250 degree oven along with the pork shoulder for about 4 to 5 hours until fork tender. This is going to be wonderful as a burrito from the left overs for this evening.

I made this on 10/19/09 and I followed the instructions except I used a jalapeno pepper instead. Other than that I used all the meats and it was yummy. I think I may skip out on the bacon/bacon drippings next time I make this. I really did enjoy this recipe. Thanks PBothwell

These were great! I topped each bowl with some grated cheddar and a dollop of sour cream. Got lots of compliments at our Mexican-themed annual "Girl's Christmas Night Out". yum, yum! Also, if the beans get dry (which they probably will), I used a can of beef broth instead of water.

A really good easy recipe. I did not add the diced ham or chipotle pepper. I substituted 1 cup Pace Picante sauce. The addition of chorizo was excellent. Great idea. Will definitely make again.

This was super delicious. I tweaked it a little bit I didn't drain the beans which I feel gave the soup more flavor I didn't just use the partial bacon fat for the onions, ham and chorizo I used all the fat left and once everything was cooked a little I pour all the contents into the large pan to make the soup. That was basically the only things I changed but over all this was amazing thank you.

Absolutely love this recipe! I would prefer it not to be as hot as it is but loved eating it in small portions. I will try to take some heat out next time.

My son love the Charros Beans, but I do not use the bacon drippings, the ham, the chipotle peper and the garlic. Instead of that I use dog sausage diced (2 packs of about 8 pieces, medium fried)4 tomatoes diced ( medium heat) and at last add 1 bunch of cilantro chopped when the beans mixture are boil. And enjoy.

I made this as a soup.  My favorite Mexican restaurant has a charro bean soup.  I did  change the recipe because I was unable to find chipotle peppers  without driving across town.  I chopped the garlic and left it in the soup.  Also, I added 2 tablespoons of cilantro, 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon, 1 - 14.5 oz can of diced fire roasted tomatoes salsa style and 5 cups of water.  This was amazing.  My husband and I both had 2nds and took it for lunch the next day.
