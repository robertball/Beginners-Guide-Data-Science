I ate 4 servings even though I think the recipe needs work, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. :)  I used 1/2 cup of cheese instead of 1/3, and fresh garlic because I didn't have garlic salt, and no onion powder because I didn't have that either.  All of that was fine.  I also used two tbsp oil instead of one, that was a mistake, too greasy.  I baked them for 20 minutes at 425 and cranked up the oven to 450 and watched them for another couple minutes - took them out when the edges on two or three started to burn.  Whoever said the cheese was the only thing crispy about these... I had that experience also.  #1 change these need is something to crisp them up on the outside.  I didn't have to turn them, although maybe that would have helped.  Cutting them thinner (more like shoestrings than pub fries) might have helped too - the thinner ones seemed a bit crisper.  The flavor was good though.  They're just a little sweet, which is nice.  No, they don't taste just like potato fries.  Soy milk doesn't taste just like dairy milk, and veggie burgers don't taste just like beef burgers.  I like these things for what they are, not how much they do or don't taste like something else, but to each their own.  If you're looking for potato fries, try potatoes; but if you don't mind something a little different, give these a go.

Would have given it three and a half......but can't. They were good ,I would probably add something else , I just don't know what. I have a feeling these are an acquired taste.

These were pretty good. My teenager had no idea they were made from turnips. I reccomend turning them half way thru the baking process. I am not sure exactly what happened to mine but the only part that was really 'crispy' was the cheese. The cheese started to burn a bit. Also, I grew up with Scotland relatives and to them, a turnip is what we call a rutabaga. I did use turnip but next time I think I might try rutabaga to see how that tastes. I dipped mine in light sour cream with a dash of dill. The spices used in this recipe are really good. Thanks

Me and two kids tried this recipe. We all LOVED it! I cut them thinly to try to get them extra crispy but after cooking them for more than 20 minutes they were still droopy. But still, very very tasty! I didn't use the tablespoon of oil though, instead I sprayed pam into the bag to coat the turnips while going easy on the fat.  This was my first time eating turnips. Even if I can never get these fries crispy- this is still a new favorite. Who knew turnips were tasty!

i thought this was pretty good.  i used a generous amount of melted butter instead of the oil.  i recommend cutting the turnip slices quite thin so they are a bit crispy.

I tried baking these on an elevated rack to see if they would get crunchier. Nope. They got more  chewy rather then crispy.  I did like the flavor quite a bit though... I added chili powder, cumin, garlic powder s&p.  I'll definitely make these again..nice lighter sub for potatoes

I loved these but they need to be turned halfway through cooking to avoid burning.  I'll be experimenting with different spices for some options but I thought they were better than seasoned french fries.

I thought these were great.  A few reviewers mentioned that the "fries" weren't crispy, so I added a shake or two of panko to the bag with the seasonings and cheese.  I cut mine into steak fry shape, and they needed probably twice as long in the oven, but they came out with a nice crunch from the panko, and I enjoyed them very much.  I will definitely make again using smoked paprika next time and perhaps a sharper cheese like romano or asiago.  Thanks IM COOKIN!!

For turnips this is actually good.  I was surprised.  I don't think turnips can get any better.

I wouldn't exactly call these "French Fries" but if you aren't trying to compare them to real potato fries, then they are very good.  The flavor of the spice blend is great, they cook faster than squash or sweet potato "fries," and the crunchy exterior/creamy interior is a nice combination.  I will make these again.  Thanks for another great turnip recipe!

These were really good. I sliced them very thin. They weren't exactly crispy, but they weren't soggy. I used smoked paprika instead of regular. We will definitely make them again when we get turnips in our CSA.

These are a great alternative to french fries FOR SOME MEALS.  I mean, they are missing the right texture for serving with say, corn dogs, hot dogs, or standard styled hamburgers. However, there are other meals which go just right with these fries. For example, hubs likes those bratwurst patties, eaten sort of like hamburgers, or Reuben sandwiches, or similar types of meals, and these 'fries' go very well with them.  With those types of meals, we actually prefer the turnip fries, even though they aren't as crisp as we'd like.  In addition to liking them better for some meals, the lower calorie alternative is a plus that makes it nice to work into an otherwise ***too*** high calorie meal for those of us needing to watch the scale quite carefully.....  Oh, we don't usually use much ketchup on our potato fries, but IMHO, either ketchup, mustard, or a combo of both is necessary with these.  I've been wondering about other dips... perhaps honey mustard or balsamic, pepper and oil, depending on the meal???  I love the idea of cinnamon and sugar, but haven't thought of a good meal to put them with....???

Don't expect these to taste like fries b/c they aren't even close. I really liked this recipe and will make it again. Even my husband thought it was great. All I'm saying is don't expect anything similar to a potato. As long as you remember you are cooking turnips and the flavour will be different, then give these a go.

maybe i missed something but I made these like shoestring size, looking at the #1 review for this recipe, kept everything the same and they still burned on the tips.  Taste may have been better but I didn't use cheese.

Maybe I did something wrong, but these were nothing like fries. They were solid and almost juicy inside, and not crunchy outside. Almost roasted? I won't be repeating the recipe.

These were an exceptional surprise! I have started eating more "root" vegetables like turnips, parsnips, celeriac, beet root, etc... and am looking for more tasty ways to prepare them. We all thought these tasted just great! We followed the recipe and cut them thinner than the picture shows, based on other reviews and they came out el perfecto! Thanks for the idea!!

Turnips are a nice low-carb option vs. the potato so that's awesome.... and I liked the mix of seasonings.  I used grapeseed oil because that's what I had and they turned out soggy even though I cooked them higher and longer.  Would love to know how to make them crispier.

5 stars because of the health factor!  Yummy, would definitely satisfy a french fry craving.  I omitted the paprika, and probably could have decreased the oil (not sure if I really used 3lbs of turnips, though).

These are an absolutely delicious, low carb alternative to potato fries! I used one Rutabaga and I wrapped the cut pieces up in a flour sack towel after cutting them into 1/4"-1/2" strips for around 20-30 minutes before oiling  and seasoning them.  (Don't over oil them, just so the draining sticks) Spread them in a single layer over TWO baking trays! Then I cooked them for 20 mins...took them out and flipped them, then returned them to the oven for another 10 mins. (In an electric oven) They are aren't SUPER crispy, but they are about like sweet potato fries! I will most definitely do these again! My husband ate almost one whole tray before dinner was served!

These were amazing!  No, they aren't crispy like fries but they are a great alternative if you are looking for low carb or for adding more or different veggies into you meal rotation.  I pretty much made exactly using my own purchases spice mix called Nick's Mix which is similar to Lawry's but spicier.  I didn't wait for the oven to pre-heat, just put it all in and set the timer for 30 minutes.  I took one out and tested it and it was super yummy.  I let the rest sit for another 5 or 10 minutes or so.  They are phenomenal!!! (p.s. first time for turnips for me, pleasantly surprised!).

Yep turnips are a taste you either like or don't - no gray area, and they don't taste like potatoes. I grew up eating them raw sprinkled with salt or boiled/mashed with butter, so I happen to like the taste. I also liked the recipe and so did my family, however I cut them thin like chips and swapped the oil/butter with egg whites, tossed them in that then the spice mix. It kinds helps them "crisp" up. (still only barely crispy tho!)...oh but still spray the sheet with olive oil.

Our family really didn't care for these.  They never did get crispy. And when they caramelized,  they became a little bitter.

Substitute the vegetable oil with coconut oil to make it LCHF - coconut oil has a far higher temperature threshold then vegetable oil (which you should avoid whilst on LCHF.

Delicious while they are hot, but not so good when they cool off.  I'd also suggest trying chili powder instead of the paprika.  My entire family loved it!

They didn't come out crispy at all and it could be because I have an electric stove. I even tried one of Tyler Florence's tricks to heat up the pan in the oven so when the "fries" go on it they sear immediately. I added onion powder and salt once they were done cooking and the taste was delicious. I'm going to experiment with more of a chip style fry, as I noticed my thinner pieces had more of a crunch... Either way though they are still tasty little things! :)

I loved it! I'm generally a gluten-free eater and potatoes are kind of off the list as well so this worked really well for me. Raw turnips remind me of carrots (a little bit sweet) so oven frying them like this they reminded me of sweet potato fries. I imagine these would be delicious with cinnamon and sugar on them.

Pleasantly surprised! 
I added cracked pepper & garlic powder, subtracted the garlic salt and replaced it w/ sea salt. Put together a spicy garlic aioli for dipping.
-Very pleased w/ this find!

The spices were good but I didn't like the turnips very much at all. I'll still eat the leftovers. I prefer raw turnips with salt.

I have made these several times and love them... trick to getting them close to crunchy is that they need to be sliced thin..thinner than what is illustrated in the picture.

I'm on a low carb diet & wanted to try these.  I cut them pretty thin like shoestring fries and used what I had in the pantry: olive/grapeseed/canola blend oil, garlic powder, smoked paprika, parm cheese, some garlic herb seasoning salt, and for kicks I tossed in some garlic/parm popcorn seasoning since I had it sitting around.  The smoked paprika gave it a great flavor & aroma combined with all the garlic.  I baked for 15 minutes, turned them (they were still soggy at that point), then baked for another 10 on an insulated cookie sheet.  DELICIOUS!  My husband & 4-yr old son loved them too!  They didn't crisp up much, but very flavorful.  Recommend!

I made these tonight and it came out perfect - seasoning was perfect, the fries were crisp = I didn't have to turn them. but I cut them pretty thin like McDonald's fries and they were crisp all over.

I flipped after 10 minutes to help cook them evenly.  After the 20 minutes total baking time I tossed them in the broiler for 3-4 more minutes a side.  This helped crisp them up a bit.  If you choose this option make sure you watch them closely, depending on your broiler strength they could burn easily.

It was hard to get them crispy with this technique.  I cooked them an extra 10 minutes, and no luck.  Kids ate them very reluctantly, and even then, with lots of ketchup.  Honestly, I think it's not the recipe, it's the turnips.  Adults who can appreciate the peculiar taste of turnips might serve them with a nice steak.

I really wasn't expecting to like these so much! Even my bf was a fan! I didn't really measure anything and I chose olive oil over veg. My turnips were from mom's garden and were much smaller so I just used my noggin to figure out how to cut them and how long to bake them. Great combo of seasonings and easy prep make this a winner in my book!

I LOVED this recipe!!!! I run a child care and it was the end of the day when I asked one of the four year old to help me prepare these. He asked if he could try one. I said sure. Not thinking he would like them. BIG mistake...He loved them and ended up eating half the batch....:)

What a creative idea! Its kind of like doing the same thing with yucca root. I added my own twist to this. 

Instead of putting in the oven I used my Salad Master sauce pan and put a thin layer of safflower oil. I still did the bag mix only I put parmesan cheese with a hint of caribbean fish seasoning. The trick is to fry on medium low temp stove top.

I made yummy a salad with fresh spinach, red leaf lettuce, a little carrot, mushrooms, strawberries, purple cabbage shavings. 

I topped the salad with the fried turnips..yummy!

they were super tasty- though i put WAY more parm cheese, and opted for garlic powder with sea salt.  only problem is i was unable to get the turnips crunchy, and i cooked for about 35 minutes.  still good, just were more like "the mushy fries" you have sometimes.

I love these.  I sub the vegetable oil for olive oil and just use sea salt to taste.  Excellent!!! Just as good as potatoes fries...hubby agrees.  I shouldn't have told the kids they were turnips, but my nine year old tried and didn't like.....next time I won't tell and see what happens.

I'd never had turnips before, but I wanted to try them so I made this recipe. I thought it tasted delicious! The flavor combination was great. These aren't potato fries, of course, and I found that I didn't actually like them with ketchup the way I eat regular or sweet potato fries...but they were great on their own and with the brown gravy I also happened to be serving with the meal. My only issue was that they were pretty mushy. I cut them thin, like shoestring fries, since I had read in other reviews that larger fries didn't crisp, but I still didn't have any luck. They baked into a mushy fry-shape (but they still tasted good!). I ended up leaving half the fries in the oven to keep them warm for my husband's late dinner, and actually they had firmed up a bit more by the time he got to them. Maybe I just need to try baking them for 30-40 minutes instead. Thanks for the recipe; I will definitely make it again!

These were great! I  cut them to look like moderately thick fries. I made about 7 servings & kept them in the zip lock bag in the refrigerator & took out what I wanted when I wanted. They last a week or so in the refrigerator. I made them for someone who hates turnips & told her they were fries. She thought they were really good & about fell over when I told her they were turnips. ALSO--after they cooked finish them off with melted shredded cheddar & bacon on top w/ a side of sour cream.

Love making my homemade French fries much the same way.  I like mine crunchy so I baked them longer than recipe calls for, much longer.  Still not as long as potatoes and a lot more flavorful.

The taste was fine...I prefered the extra crispy fries.  They are definitely not a substitute for french fries, but are a great way to eat a different vegetable!

Flavor was good, but these were squishy not crispy.  I tried a few seconds under the broiler, but that didn’t help.

I usually don’t waste time on recipes with so few reviews....and there is a reason.  This was truly terrible.  I had to toss the whole batch, and yes I followed the recipe.

I liked it, however, I think the recipe needs some tweaking when it comes to seasoning. I feel like it could be better! I may try again with rutabagas and maybe add a ranch packet.

4 1/2 stars actually...they lose  1/2 a star since they don't quite get crispy, and thats what makes a good french fry. That being said though, these were super delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and these came out good.  I did flip them half way through cooking.The parmesan cheese does crisp up a bit which makes the turnip fries tasty ...I couldn't stop eating them.  They don't need any dip.  I might try cooking them a bit longer next time to get the cheese even crispier.  :)

Took nearly 45 minutes for only 2 pounds of turnips, but came out delicious. Added far less oil and no cheese, used a a pre-made rub (Devil's Dust). Amazing.

I made this but did not use any cheese.  I used a little Old Bay seasoning, 2 tablespoons of Corn starch with the garlic and onion powder.   They crisped up nicely and are a pleasant treat.  For those who don’t seem to get them crispy, try the corn starch trick and make sure you let them get completely dry before adding the oil.   We will make these again!!

Really enjoyed this.  Very flavorful.  Do they have the taste & consistency of french fries made with potatoes?  No.  But they are soooooo much better than nothing and really good!  Even if you do eat potatoes, you should give these a try.

Good way to use those extra turnips in the garden.  Definitely  taste different than fries but my hubby and I liked them and I will make them again.   I used a spiralizer to cut them in 3/8 curls.... like small curly fries. I think this was key for us to like them.  Had to bake them longer to get them to be crispy.

I like turnips, so I tried this recipe, it was really good.  They didn't quite get as crispy as I thought they would but they were still great!!  And I'm diabetic so the low carbs were another plus for me.  I used turnips that I got at the farmer's market yesterday, nice and fresh!!

I had left over turnips from another revile I tried. I had no clue what to make. I found this recipe and made it this evening. I used 1/2 tsp of onion salt instead of 1 tsp of onion powder because I didn't have any. Can't stop eating them! They're so good!

This recipe was intriguing to me as a creative alternative to fries. The spices were good, but I have to agree with everyone else that they were not crispy at all. I put them directly under the broiler at  broiling temperature  thinking they might crisp up better, but they did not. I even cooked them longer, as much as I could without burning them. The thing is that turnips have much more moisture in them than potatoes of any kind so I think that no matter what we try to do to crisp them up, that won't happen.

I think this recipe is great! I substitute the olive oil for coconut butter flavour oil, used Garlic powder, salt, thyme and parsley on mine. I also pre-baked the turnip for 20 minutes before putting anything on them. I cut them up small just to get a good coat of oil and spices.

This was a nice change from eating mashed turnips. I made 2 separate pans since there were a lot of fries and one pan was a lot more crowded than the other.  The fries on the less crowded pan were crispier.

I've recently discovered my hand cranked spiralizer. This is a perfect recipe for that.  It takes longer to peel the turnip when you can spiralize it in seconds.  I did peel it, though, first.  I used my smallest blade to make spaghetti noodles.  Big turnips are hard to do so use the smaller ones.  I've also made this with jicama and sweet potatoes.  You can use any combination of spices.  With the jicama I used chili powder and cayenne.  I place the spiralized turnip on the sheet pan, sprinkle with oil and spices and mix with my hands.  This is an easy, versatile recipe.

If you haven't eaten a French fry in 83 days, these are an awesome low carb alternative. Made these today as a test run for tomorrow's July 4th meal. When I make them tomorrow, I plan to bump the temp up to 435° to hopefully crisp them a little more. But still, if you've got the taste buds of a 10 year old and the metabolism of a 40 year old, this is an excellent choice.

I used the basic cooking instructions and used the spices I had on hand: garlic salt, pepper, oregano, and smoked paprika. Cutting it to 1/3 in allows it too cook pretty fast. I did 15 minutes on one side then flipped them and did an additional 10 minutes. For about 2 minutes I broiled to add a little char! yum! Be sure to peel the turnip because the outer layer is very bitter

I modify the recipe a bit, I would never use vegetable oil, and instead opp for grape seed or coconut oil. Also I usually forgo the cheese.  Turnips are a very versatile root and you can make variations by playing with other spices.

I really liked this recipe. It's not really true to the title, as others have stated, they do not get crispy pretty much no matter what you do.  I sliced them very thin, almost paper thin.  I used chili powder instead of paprika.  I also used olive oil.  I turned the broiler on for just the last minute, and they were great.  Very much like American fries, but healthier.

I made this and changed it up a bit. 
slice the turnips into fries add the following into the zip lock bag:
sea salt
fresh pepper
garlic powder
onion powder
2 tbsp of flour
2tbsp of olive oil
FRESH grated cheese (I used Irish white cheese, hard)

bake for 25 min, then broil for 4-5 min. 
EDGES are crispy, the center is still soft but the crust is fantastic.

Mine were not "crispy" but they are tasty. Read through the reviews and tried everything that everyone else had tried to make them crispy, just as unsuccessfully. But they did still taste good!

What a great low-carb alternative to french fries.  I made these with rutabaga instead of turnips, and I think it made them even better (less turnippy bitterness).  The spices are what make these fries great.  They are so flavorful and crispy that I didn't miss conventional fries, which is saying a lot.  Don't skimp on the spices.

low carb 360 network has this similar recipe but...very importantly, what most of the folks are missing in the 'taste' you need peel and rinse them then bring to boil in water with better than bullion or chicken stock for about 15 minute; cool then cut them up and toss in your fav oil, I like xvoo. cook in 400 degree oven, turn in fifteen minutes then cook another 15 or so,  You can  top with your fav topping, mine...parm chz, lowry's seasoning and lite salt and pepper

Yes, you know they are turnips, but you can't stop eating them---and you want more.

It was a tasty snack.  The turnips were an oddly sweet flavor when you're used to a potato, but it was a good substitute.  I just eyeballed olive oil, Parmesan, basil, garlic powder, and salt/pepper.  Tossed in a bowl the baked for 20 minutes.  One side was a little darker, so maybe I'll flip them next time?

Yum! I love to try out new recipes with my family.  I rarely get any complaints. This one is delicious as well.  I do agree with one of the other reviews to turn halfway through the cooking time.

I made this recipe tonight. I have a picture, looks the same only on a white plate, I have no idea how to resize it to post here, though. I used Cajun seasoning. I did not use foil or oil on the baking pan, because I used a pampered chef bar pan and it doesn`t require oiling. I put 1 Tsp. olive oil in with the seasoning and shook after adding the turnips, until evenly coated. All I can say is Yummy !

They are turnips. They were good though I did add red pepper flakes and a bit more parm cheese.

We really enjoyed this, I agree with turning them half way through and maybe cooking 5 min longer. They have a sweet flavor which is surprising.

Not bad, just not anything particularly special. I also recommend turning the fries halfway through, but it`s unlikely you will get them really crispy - just as you wouldn`t with potato oven fries. Might make these again and add some more seasoning.

Turnips had a strong flavor. If they weren't so strong they would have been good.

i had never tried trunips before, but these were actually good :-) But couldnt get them crispy, they were very soft, kind of reminded me more or onion rings versus french fries because of the onion  powder. But I'm glad I can add another veggie in the mix

Followed the recipe exactly but these turned out mushy and watery.  I even cooked them much longer than the recipe called for, hoping they would get crispy but it never happened.

I made this recipe using turnips and parsnips minus the paprika and it still tasted good. The parsnip fries tasted sweet. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and cooked it for a few minutes less time than needed. Make sure you keep an eye on the fries or they will get too crispy.

So good! Even my husband loved them.  I used EVOO instead of veggie oil (since it's all I had on hand) and instead of paprika+onion powder, I added rosemary.

I would have given them 3.5 stars based on my perception of them, but my 1 year old really liked them. :)  Not too bad!

These have potential, but I followed the recipe almost exactly and my fries were no where near crispy.  The only change I made was to use olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  The flavor was a bit mild and seemed to be missing something.  I may fiddle with this again in the future.
