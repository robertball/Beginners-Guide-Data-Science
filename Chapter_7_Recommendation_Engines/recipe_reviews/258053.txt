Super easy! I cook a lot and am always trying new recipes— most much more involved than this one. But because of  the simplicity of this and the flavorful results,  I’ll be making it again. My husband kept saying how good it was. Definitely give it a try.

Super easy week night meal for anyone. Depending on the sauce and raviolis you get will change the flavor, which is fun. You can have the same dish a few times a week and it be different every time :)

I made this for my teenager and it was a hit. I used the pepperoni sparingly, added extra sliced mozzarella & dried basil on top layer. Turned out great!
