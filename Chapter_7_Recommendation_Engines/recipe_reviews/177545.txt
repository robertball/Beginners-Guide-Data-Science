Thought this sounded good, but it tasted strange and was inedible.

Fantastic, I suggest seasoning the pork and slicing it in half and stuffing the fruit in the center. Great recipe, looks fancy too!

This is an awesome and easy recipe and was very delicious.  The only change I made was using red wine instead of port as I didn't have any on hand.  I also used more wine than the recipe called for (about 3/4 cup) as 1/4 cup hardly seemed enough.  My tenderloin was in one piece and fairly thick so I cut lengthwise as I wanted it to be done in 30 minutes when the puff pasty was browned.  One other thing to watch--the puff pastry thaws quickly.  I left it folded too long and then could not unwrap it. But, putting it back in the freezer for a couple of minutes stiffened it just enough so I could unfold it and roll it. We will be definitely making this again.

I found this recipe by accident but I saved it because it was both easy to follow and my family loved it.  The only variation I made was to add Bernaise sauce upon plating the food.  If you are new to puff pastry, I would suggest that when you thaw it out that you unfold it as soon as possible.
