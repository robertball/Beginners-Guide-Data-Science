This was AMAZING! Admittedly, I've never had Mole-Style anything so I didn't know what to expect. I was looking for something new, and this was unlike anything I've ever tasted! I didn't have the campbell's soup, so I substituted it with another simple french onion soup recipe from this website. After pulling the pork apart at the end, I slowly added the leftover liquid to it to get it to my preferred texture. As per another reviewers suggestion, I served this with spanish rice. I also added sour cream and cheese to the tortilla after trying it as stated in the recipe, and I found I liked it better with the added ingredients.

I have to first say that I made this tonight using a much smaller piece of left over pork (about 1lb), so I downsized all the ingredients.  I also just simmered on the stove since I was using leftovers and did not need to actually cook the pork.  I thought the flavors were great.  Moles are usually very complicated and they do vary in taste greatly from recipe to recipe.    This recipe was easy and had a nice result.  I made some spanish rice and corn and we used those items in the burritos too!

Great flavor, but I did forget the chocolate. I didn't use tortillas, instead I served over brown rice with a side of mexican corn. I will make again.

Made this true to recipe portions, but used chipotle powder in place of chili powder.  My pork was closer to 4.5# so I added a little extra spice without measuring.  Cooked the pork on low for 6h and it was so tender i couldn't even take it out it just fell apart.  Before I put the chocolate bits in i tasted the meat and it was spicy but seemed to be missing something and then when i put the chocolate bits in and tasted it -that's what it needed!  Will test out for dinner tonight.  Will serve w/ some sour cream as the chipotle really spicy!

This recipe is amazing! It's very rich - the flavor is quite dark. I doubled all of the spices and the chocolate because I tend to like things very flavorful. In retrospect, I may not have doubled the chocolate. Still an awesome recipe and exactly what I wanted. I served it on kaiser rolls without the tomatoes or cilantro and loved it that way. Enjoy, all!

The recipe as is is woefully underseasoned.  I added TONS of extra cumin.  One guest really liked it and I sent the leftovers home with her b/c I found it to be fairly gross.  I wouldn't say it was a big hit with the rest of the guests.

Really yummy and easy!  It's still good about 4 days later reheated.  A very unique taste- if prepared as top-rated reviews suggest.

Would NOT recommend this receipe. Cinnamon destroyed the flavor Very disappointing and most of all, my family :( Will research a receipe that focuses on a more traditional Mole sauce...

Loved it! Cooked it all day while at work and was a little nervous not being here to check it. Came home to a divine smell as soon as I pulled in the garage. It was delicious with brown rice and carrots. I made the change of a half packet of french onion soup and a cup more water since that is what I had in the pantry. Worked just fine.

If it would let me, I would not give this recipe any stars.  Unfortunately, you have to give it at least 1 star in order to be able to post your rating.  I made this recipe exactly per the directions and we didn't care for it at all!  The cinnamon was way over powering!  I even tried another reviewers suggestion (after I tried it as directed and didn't like it) and added some sour cream and cheese to it after putting it on the tortillas.  Although this did help a little, it was still not good at all.  A total waste of a good pork roast!  There have been times that we were not crazy about a recipe, but even though we may not be big fans, it has always been at least edible.  This however, was NOT!  Save your pork, money, and time by not making this recipe!

This was pretty good and simple.  The cinnamon was pretty strong I would only put a dash next time.

Not bad but not great. Like most Campbell's recipes it really needed salt & pepper. I served it on Day 2 "Memphis Style" with Cole Slaw on top and it was much improved. Will try again and will play with it a bit.

This tasted very traditional, having grown up on Mexican cuisine.  Easy to make and just wonderful. One of the best recipes I have found.

I liked this very much, but I also modified it a great deal. I didn't have french onion soup mix so I used dehydrated onions and vegetables (about 1/2C) and some beef bouillon powder. I Cut the cinnamon down to about 1/4t and added 1/8t of chilpotle powder (I love it, but it's too spicy for my family. Finally I had about 1/2C of barbeque sauce so I threw that in too. I Served the pork without the sauce tonight because I like to let the liquid sit in the fridge over night, then remove the fat from the top, but even with just the spices from the cooking process it was great. Tonight I served it on buns with BBQ sauce, tomorrow I'll remove the fat, reheat the sauce and add some cocoa powder and mix it into the meat. I'm sure it will be wonderful, the flavors are different from tradition BBQ, even from Carolina style BBQ.

Followed the recipe to the letter.  The cinnamon was overwhelming and it was extremely blah otherwise.  It was difficult to even use the leftovers in any way due to the cinnamon.  A big thumbs down from the entire family.   I don't really think there is any way to salvage this recipe.

I found this lacking in flavor - I would increase spices next time.  It just didn't really have that rich mole flavor I was hoping for - also it seemed runny. I would try another recipt before going through the effort to tweek this one.

Tried this recipe in a pressure cooker. Doubled up on cumin, took dried peppers and ground them, as well as the chili powder. Used half the cinnamon, which was still a bit much. Put the tomatoes and cilantro in to cook with the meat, added a whole onion and........... it was awesome!

Loved it! I did end up basically tripling the chili powder in it but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great! Since there's just two of us, I put a lot of it into the freezer to pull out for a quick dinner another night.

So easy, and very good. Had to make my own condensed onion soup and substitute 3T cocoa powder and 3T sugar for the choc chips to use what I had on hand.  Thanks to Google, that was no big deal.  Not sure if that affected the taste.  Makes a big batch, so we will be freezing much of it!  For us, its a bit overly rich to have often... but will be a nice special occasion meal.
