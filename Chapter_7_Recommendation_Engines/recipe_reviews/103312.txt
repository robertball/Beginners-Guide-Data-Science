This was good, but I really felt that it needed some milk added to make it creamier.  I think 1/2 cup would have made this just about perfect, because it does have a great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added a bit of celery seed and garlic powder to this recipe, and I have to say that it turned out to be the best tuna casserole I ever ate, or at least the only one I ever ate enough of to talk about. An easy to prepare, healthy, tasty and economical meal that is on the table in under an hour. Pam Anderson has my seal of approval all the way around here!

This was indeed the perfect tuna casserole!!! I added a couple of stalks of chopped celery & a bit more peas & I also added some chopped roasted garlic...it added great flavor & I highly recommend it. The french fried onions were such a nice change over the usual bread crumbs. Will have again over & over. Forgot to mention that I did not boil the macaroni as long as the recipe says. I left it a little undercooked & it finished in the oven.

This might be the best tuna noodle casserole I have ever eaten....and that is saying a lot!  Based on what I had on hand, I used cream of celery soup instead of COM, and I also added about 3/4C of light sour cream.  I cooked the noodles in chicken broth and then added about 1/2C of the reserved broth to the casserole before baking.  I also had only garlic and herb seasoned tuna, which enhanced the flavor, I am sure.  All in all, I would say this is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great. I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out perfect. Nice quick comfort dinner. The french fried onions definately added a lot to flavor and I also didn't cook the noodles completely, just let it finish in the oven. Turned out so good and cheesy!

This is really good! My old recipe is good but not like this one.  The dill weed and french fried onions give it lots of flavour. I would not change a thing. Thanks Pam

My kids loved this. I thought the dill would be too much but it really wasn't.  I used corkscrew pasta and it was great!

This is EXACTLY what a tuna casserole should be - My husband, who "doesn't like tuna casserole," had seconds AND thirds of this one! An easy, quick meal - I already had all the ingredients, so no quick trip to the store needed - perfect!

Really like this recipie, made just a few tiny changes.  Didn't used french fried onions....instead chopped a medium onion and added to a frying pan with a little butter until translucent and then mixed into the macaroni.  Used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom (my own aversion to mushrooms, but LOVED the cream of celery taste with the dill!), and then held back a little of the cheese to spinkle on top the last few minutes of baking.  A keeper! have made this recipie many times and is now a fmaily fav!!!

I didn't care for this all that much. I actually like tuna casserole, and I like to try different versions. This isn't one of my favorites. It wasn't awful, but I doubt I make it again.
