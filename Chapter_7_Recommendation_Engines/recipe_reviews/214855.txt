This is a very good cheesecake.  The ones that ate couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  It was a very easy recipe to follow.  I would suggest trying it out for yourself.

This tasted delicious, although the three layers didn't seem as "defined" as I thought they would be.  I think that next time, I may double the recipe so that each layer is thicker.  Also...be sure not to make the mistake that I did...I actually ended up throwing away my first attempt of this cake!  When it came to the strawberries, I thought, "I love strawberries....I'll add more."  I added a whole container (1 pound).  Strawberries are mostly water....and this made the mixture pretty runny.  As a result the top layer didn't cook correctly, and after an extra hour in the oven, was burned.  The next time, I followed the recipe and used one cup only of strawberries...and it was perfect!

Really great cheesecake.  The layers are really eye-appealing and they taste good, too.  I didn't have Graham crackers, so I just used a similar cookie for the crust.  I also didn't have frozen strawberries; I had frozen raspberries on hand.  It still came out really tasty!!

My cheesecake certainly did not look like the one in the picture.  I wish the recipe was a bit more thorough.  I couldn't tell if my cheesecake was undercooked because it jiggled and the middle was caved in a little, so I cooked it just 15 minutes longer and totally ruined it.  What does it mean to bake it until "almost set"?  I think the recipe should be more specific concerning the physical properties.  Oh well!

for those of you that had a problem with the layer definition, I have made this cheesecake several times and I have found that if you freeze each of the first 2 layers for 10 to 15 minutes instead of just 5 minutes, it will look very much like the picture.  this one is always a huge hit, even the first 2 I attempted that looked like a blown up tub of neapolitan ice cream.

Had for Easter dinner on Sun.; all agreed best cheesecake ever.  12-yr.-old grandson said not to tell his mother that, though!

A beautiful, delicious cheesecake that is pretty simple to make. It's a little time consuming, but definitely worth the effort! The only thing I did differently was I left off the white chocolate shavings and garnished instead with chocolate dipped strawberries. Fabulous!

Just made this for Christmas Day dinner.  It was a big success and fairly easy to put together.  The only thing I noticed was that my layers were not as prominently chocolate or strawberry in color or as high as in the picture.  The next time I make it, I'm going to put more chocolate pieces in and add 2 squares of semi-sweet and 2 squares of milk chocolate, plus I'm going to make each batch with 2 bricks of cream cheese separately instead of making one bigger batch and trying to divide evenly. I also think I over drained the thawed strawberry mixture, which is why it came out more of a creamy pink color, but all-in-all it was good.  My daughter, who is not a big cheesecake eater, really liked this one.  That was a ringing endorsement.

I made this for the In-Laws, and it was a major hit! However, I had two issues: 1) After 55 minutes, the middle was still completely raw, and ooxed out when we cut it, and 2) The top of the cake turned a brown color, making it look like a 4-layered cake! (But once I decorated it with chocolate shavings, it looked much better.) If you're up for it, it's definitely worth a try!

Well, first attempt. Not fabulous, but I did ok. Didn't use enough chocolate, and I think I overlooked it. But hey, I'm new to this cooking thing, and it was actually pretty tasty. Recipe was easy to follow. So I'd say, for beginners like me, not bad. :)

This cheesecake recipe will not layer out as shown.  I made it as per the recipe with no changes.  You would have to make 2 times as much batter to get 3 large defined layers as shown.  I had no problems with it setting after being baked for 50 minutes.  I also made sure the strawberries were well drained as it could add too much moisture.  I also agree with letting it sit in the freezer for at least 10 minutes before adding the top 2 layers of batter.

At best, you can make a two layer cheese cake with the vanilla and chocolate layer and make a strawberry topping instead.
