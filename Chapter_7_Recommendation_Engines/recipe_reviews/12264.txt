Hello everyone, This recipe was created by my Grandmother Clara Tanner out of Phoenix Az.  She won 3rd place in the Better Homes and Garden contest Nov 1970 issue.  ( I think it was teamed up with Dole Pineapple of Hawaii at the time) It was my Grandfather's favorite  pie.  The contest read Romance of Hawaii teamed up with mainland apples.  We have enjoyed this dessert for many years in our family. Best made with medium green apples, make sure to fan the apples out for a beautiful look. Nana would love for you to make it. :0)

My late mother and I have made this recipe, and LOVED IT, since the Nov. 1970, Better Homes & Gardens magazine featured it. ... We like it a little sweeter than her recipe, so we use 1 cup of sugar rather than 3/4 cup. ..This is the original King Kamehameha pie recipe. I have the ORIGINAL page from the magazine in front of me now(10/28/08).

Not popular at the pot luck.  I thought it would be sweeter.
