This was a healthy and easy recipe, but I won't be adding it to my regular recipes. My husband would not eat it. My friends loved it. I thought it was pretty good, but not good enough to make it on a regular basis. One suggestion I do have is that if you make it, soak the rice for a while in hot water to help soften it up before cooking. Otherwise, the rice takes FOREVER to soften...

This recipe was very easy and (for us) on the bland side.  I might have added some green chile or cayenne pepper for a little bit more zing.

I only thought this 4 stars after the following changes:  used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. used 3 shallots instead of onion.  used fresh carrots, green beans, 1 green pepper and potatoes.  chop potato and carrot small to shorten cooking time.  used two cans of rotel instead of tomato (included juice from the cans).  added garlic powder mix (Johnny's Garlic Spread) and more sea salt & cracked black pepper.  added chicken bouillon (Knorr brand).  used quinoa instead of rice. chop chicken into small, bite-sized pieces.  top w/ shredded cheddar!  it was DELICIOUS! the boyfriend and i really loved it.  we found it to be comforting, warm, hearty, and yummy.  easy recipe for summer or winter time.

Excellent dish... I made the modification of using a chicken flavored "rice side" package instead of plain white rice and italian style canned tomatoes.  This is now in the rotation of meals to make on a continuing basis...

This recipe was actually better than I thought it would be.  I will definatly make it again, but add a few more spices.  My 8 year old liked the chicken, cheese and rice, but didn't care for the tomatoes.

Surprisingly good for how simple it is.  I ended up using sushi rice and frozen carrots because that was all I had on hand but it was still delicious!

We Love AllRecipes Ingredient Search! ... I found this recipe and read all the reviews (1 to 5 stars). I think a "key substitution" is this: Salsa for the Diced tomatoes! It's what I had and used, YUM! Other than that, I used 2c. Cooked Rice (leftovers), Cooked cubed chicken, and fresh carrots. The potatoes and carrots are a little crisp, so if you want to precook them, it might help, but I am liking the crispness. I might serve with tortillas a side of corn (or put it in next time). Enjoy!

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago and I'm about to make it tonight too! This was a great recipe when at 5 pm I still didn't know what to make for dinner and I didn't want to go out to pick anything up to make something. This was so easy! I had everything in my pantry, except the potatoes so I just omitted them. I did have to add some garlic powder and some cayenne pepper for a little more flavor. Usually, I have to ask my husband if he likes the dinner I make... this time, he took one bit and said "what is this?This is really good!"  I think I'll be making this one often. :)

I found this recipe on a night where i emptied my fridge and was like, "what can i make with chicken, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and string beans?"  I was really not expecting much and was just happy to use what I already had on hand.  I was so surprised.  When I dished myself up a plate I did my ususal, "OK, I'm not going to have 2nds." but I totally wanted more (and I did... i have no will power).  I love this recipe because I didn't really have to measure anything - just tossed the ingredients in and simmered.  I did do some things differently (not because I didn't trust the author) - I used sweet potatoes instead if regular (bc it's what I had) pre-marinated chicken breasts (new perdue product), fresh tomato (bc it's what i had), mahatma rice (ditto) and i added some cayenne.  I think the cayenne and pre-marinated chicken added some extra flavor.  I'll totally make it again.  thank you!

This came out fantastic, but only with my changes, which is why I rate it a 4. I added an extra potato and omitted the green beans and carrots. The thought of those vegetables with the rest of the mixture, honestly made my stomach churn, so I didn't dare try it. I used chicken broth in place of water, and added and extra 1/2 cup, totally 1 1/2 cups broth in place of 1 cup water. I did not follow the measurements for salt and pepper, just added to taste. I also added a dash or two of paprika and season all. When I sauteed the onion, I also added 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped. 1/2 cup cheese is definitely not enough. I added in 1/2 cup and mixed together with the rest, then added 1 cup to the top. This still needed salt and pepper to taste with each persons preference, but it came out wonderful. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chile and that gave it a great little kick without overpowering. It all got eaten up, and I will definitely make again. Very easy and quick, but hardy and filling.

This recipe needed a little tweaking for better flavor so I added some lemon juice and ground sage and it was a hit!  My husband wanted the leftovers for lunch.  Also, if you have too much liquid, add some potato pearls to thicken it up and it tasted great!

This was a winner for my family, but I did make a few changes.  I grilled extra chicken breasts yesterday so I just sauted the onions in olive oil, not veg oil.  I added 1 clove of garlic minced.  I sauted the rice with the onion and garlic before I added the vegetables and chopped chicken.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  Because I used broth, I cut out the salt.  I also used instant rice (because I was out of regular rice).  It turned out great!  I might even make it without chicken as a side dish some night.

This dish was pretty good.  I used fresh veggies, whole grain rice, and added kidney beans.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I think the potato and cheese could be left out.

I added Italian seasoning and changed the cheese to Parmesian, and it was pretty good.  Definitely easy, and I will make it again.

I tried this recipe because I had all the ingredients at hand and it was all in one pot. I did some things differently but nothing to really alter the dish. I used fresh carrots, frozen green beans and "italian seasoned" diced tomatoes because that's what I had. I used 10 minute rice instead of regular and added 1 tbsp of minced garlic and some fresh sliced mushrooms. Despite the added seasoning in the tomatoes and the addition of garlic, this dish is PAINFULLY bland! My husband commented that it tasted a bit like chicken vegetable soup without the liquid (which was not a good thing) and I simply thought it was BORING. As another reviewer stated, it's missing something -- I just don't know what it is!

Oh, and I think that a dish with both potatoes AND rice is really strange!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it has a whole lot of potential, just missing something that I can't quite put my finger on.

It's one of those great recipies that you usually have everything in your cupboard to make. I replaced the water with chicken stock and added a few dashes of chili powder. It was good but nothing that I would serve to guests, but could be, if I could just figure out what seems to be missing.

Great recipe. I tweaked it a bit to fit my cooking style and preferences. I tend to like my flavors more robust. Thus, I made the following changes to the recipe:

Subbed olive oil for vegetable oil. Added chopped stalks of green onions. Used walla sweet onions.
Fresh green beans, carrots, and tomatoes, instead of canned. Used chicken broth instead of water. Cooked my rice separately. Added extra cheddar (probably 50-75% more).

Added all of the vegetables with the chicken at the beginning instead of just the onions (except the tomatoes - added them and the chicken broth before covering for 20-30 minutes). Added the freshly cooked rice after the potatoes were mostly finished - mixed well so the rice sopped up most of the remaining juices - then added my shredded cheese and stirred well to melt and distribute throughout the dish.

Added the following spices to the vegetables as they were cooking:
Thyme, Sweet Basil, Mediterranean Oregano, and Parsley.

I served roasted zucchini and onions (lightly salted and peppered, and braised with olive oil) to accompany the "Country Chicken Supper".

My guests were raving. Great recipe. Thanks! :-)

I've been making this dish for about 4 years, maybe longer. I got the recipe from the easy to bake easy to make recipe cards I got through the mail. I use italian style diced tomatos instead of the plain(they add more flavor) and I also use french style green beans. It's very yummy!!

Awesomew recipe.  I cooked the chicken, onion, and potato separetely.  I soaked the rice as was suggested in another review.  When my potatoes were done browning.  I deglazed them with white wine and added some butter.  When this was finished I added everything back to the pot and let simmer for about 20 minutes.    I omitted the carrots.  I added more salt and pepper than suggested, with some chili and cayene pepper for a little more flavor.

Very yummy! and easy but took a lil longer then expected but still very easy to make. I only changed just a few things. First I cooked the potatoes with the chicken onion mixture and added lots of Tastefully Simple garlic garlic and season salt. Then omitted the carrots and used chicken broth instead of water and topped it with shredded swiss and mozzarella. It was far better then I had expected!! great healthy stick to your ribs kinda dinner:)

I wouldn't say I didn't like it. I wouldn't say I loved it either. It was just OK

I listened to some of the other reviews and added green pepper, cajun seasoning, garlic, and a pinch of rosemary. I also added a whole can of Rotel instead of tomatoes. With the rotel and cajun seasoning,  it was a little on the spicy side but far from bland like some of the reviews stated. Will make again with very similar modifications!

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now.  It was bland the first time I made it, so here are the changes I have made over the years.  While cooking chicken, add Cajun seasoning (Tony chacheres) or slap yo mama and add minced garlic.  I also use rotel or diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings, or have even used salsa for a Mexican flavor.  Once everything is added, salt and pepper to add more seasoning.  The cheese adds flavor too, so be sure to use alot!

I used all fresh veggies, omitted the rice, and used chicken stock.  Added thyme, basil and paprika. Thickened with corn starch after cooking 20 minutes and served with a dollop of sour cream.  I only had a bit of Romano and Feta cheese to sprinkle on top. Amazing!

Add chicken bouillon cubes (2 or 3) for some added flavor! Also, I used fresh veggies and that helped the flavor as well! Will definitely make again!

The whole family loved it! We didn't have all the ingredients, so just went with what we had.  Omitted the cheese & carrots, used salsa instead of diced tomatoes, onion powder instead of chopped onion.  We did have to cook it A LOT longer than this recipe said, so maybe it was referring to Minute Rice?  In the future we will cook the rice first.  But, as far as taste and the convenience of whipping something up with the stuff we've got on hand, we loved it!  Even our picky eater ate a full helping.
