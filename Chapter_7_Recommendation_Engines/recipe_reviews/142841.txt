This is actually pretty good, though I used strong coffee (chilled) rather than instant.

Nothing special with this iced coffee.  Will not be making again.

Very good. I used a full tbsp. of coffee granules because I like it STRONG. I buzzed this in the blender for 30 seconds. Just the pick up I needed.
