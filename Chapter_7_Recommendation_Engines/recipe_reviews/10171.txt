In reading the first review of this recipe, I have some suggestions. 
I make a similar cookie: Instead of chopping the cherries, roll one whole cherry in the middle of a ball of dough. Instead of topping with marshmallows, top with a thin frosting: powdered sugar, cherry juice, almond extract and milk.
Not difficult at all!

I used 1/3 of a marshmellow instead of 1/2. I put the cookies with the marshmellow back in the 350 oven for 2 minutes to toast the marshmellows. I also kept the chocolate warm in the double boiler while drizzling it on the cookies. It turned out great! 1st place in the neighborhood christmas cookie competition. I would also suggest replacing some of the milk in the frosting recipe with maraschino juice for extra cherry flavor.

This was the most difficult and frustrating recipe I've ever tried.  Not only were the directions hard to understand..but it didn't work.  The marshmellows did "melt" on the cookies, the sauce did not thicken.  If you attempt this recipe, it is best to have a team of two or three people--then you may have better luck.
