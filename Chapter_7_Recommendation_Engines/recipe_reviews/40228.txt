This dish was just okay. Nothing great.  It is on the bland side. I removed the lemon grass because lemon grass is not supposed to be eaten. You can't digest it, it is just for flavoring. It was fun to learn how to make the egg pancake strips (always wondered how they did that).  Too bland to make again
