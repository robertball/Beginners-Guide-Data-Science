These had a great taste, but I found them very difficult to put together, and very messy for my guests to eat as finger food. Also, they tended to get mushy on the bottom before they broiled up nice on top. My last batch, I baked them for about ten minutes on 375, then broiled them on high for 90 seconds. This helped.
