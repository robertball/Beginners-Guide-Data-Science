***A GREAT stir fry recipe! I did not have mirin (sweetened Asian wine) so I just used some white wine I had in the fridge. It was fine but I imagine the mirin would add a nice flavor to the sauce. I will look for it in the store for next time. I used a few other vegetables also, like carrots, celery and mushrooms...We like lots of veggies. My children loved this meal as well. Thanks Jean!***

Stir-fried chicken is my signature dish -- what I love to cook for family and company.  This week I got a bargain on fresh pineapple so was looking for a recipe to use it, and this was a good one.  In addition to the fresh pineapple instead of canned, I substituted jalapeno peppers for some of the green, since I had a surplus from my garden.  This added a kick to the sweet-sour flavor.  I didn't have mirin, either, so drizzled a little honey into the mix.  I am puzzled by the reviewer who said she substituted honey for corn syrup, as there is no corn syrup in the original recipe.  Perhaps she mis-read cornstarch, which is what thickens the sauce and doesn't add any flavor.  I am used to marinating my chicken for a little while, so I poured the sauce ingredients over the chicken while I chopped the vegetables, then strained it off again before cooking the chicken in a wok.  Remove the chicken and then wok the vegetables, starting with hard ones (I used carrots, too) and adding the tender ones, ending with the pineapple.  Delicious!!

Delicious and easy to make!  I used fresh pineapple, red onions, and red peppers...colorful end result!  I increased the sauce and mixed it all together with asian bean threads.  Also added a little brown sugar in the end to cut the saltiness of the soy and give it a nice mix of flavors.  Excellent!

Best stir-fry I ever made.  The sauce was thick and the veggies stayed crispy when following the instructions.  I did double the recipe and I added a can of stir-fry veggies, fresh green and red pepper strips, the green onions and 2 cans of mushrooms.  I served over rice and no left-overs!

the flavors were very good once the pineapple juice cut the salt of the other sauce down - but i had a hard time with the proportions.  at first it wasn't enough sauce, so i doubled it, but that was a little too much and made my veggies soggy near the end.  i'm not sure what the trick should be here - maybe to thicken/heat the sauce separately so as not to sog-ify the veggies? well, it was pretty good in the end either way and the hubby loved it :)

It was o.k.  I would not make this again.  If I did, I would add onions and carrots.  It was just a little too sweet for us.

This was very easy. Followed directions to a "T" and added brocoli slaw. My family enjoyed it served over brown rice yet I felt it lacked a zip or something, not sure. Maybe some black bean paste/sauce would enhance this dish. I will make it again for the ease of it and the nutrition of getting those veggies in!  Thanks!

Very good.  I doubled the sauce.  I was able to get the mirin at our local grocery store (Publix) in the oriental food isle.

This was delicious!  So good that my picky hubby went back for seconds and we were fighting over the leftovers for lunch the next day! Used the honey idea since I had no mirin.  Added red wine and red wine vinegar instead of the mirin and white wine vinegar.  Also to the sauce, I added some red pepper flakes for a little bit of spice.  Also used frozen pineapple chunks (no juice) and doubled the other sauce to make up for the lack of juice.  Added broccoli and onions to the veggies. 

All in all it came out perfect.  The veggies weren't overcooked using this method and the chicken was very tender.

This was an excellent recipe with a few modifications. The recipe did not say what to do with the pineapple juice so I added it to the sauce ingredients and doubled the amount of cornstarch. Also, I added the sesame oil to the sauce as a seasoning, not as an oil for stir frying. Sesame oil is too delicate and not a suitable oil when using high temperatures. Finally, I cut the chicken in thin slices instead of 1 inch pieces. The slices cooked quickly and provided more surface area for the sauce to coat. The results were delicious! I will be making this again!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! The colors are so vibrant and the flavors are so well balanced. This was a big hit for my family. 
I made it twice so far. The first time the vegetables came out mushy and over cooked, so the second time I made sure to cook the chicken well right from the start, then I made the sauce without any vegetables in it and when it thickened enough I added first the chicken and then the vegetables. I didn't let it cook for that long from here on to keep the vegetables nice and crisp and vibrant in color.  I also used fresh pineapple which made a big difference. It didn't need any of the juice at all. Also I wouldn't recommend substituting ground ginger instead of the fresh one.  I have tried that since the first time I didn't have fresh ginger on hand and the flavor was not quit right. We all really enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

What makes this so fun is the variety of colors. I used about 1/3 each of a fresh green and red pepper.  

The dish was full of flavor--a bite with the pineapple made it sweet, so the rice we served with it really balanced the flavorful dish.  Almonds would have been a great addition to add a little crunch.

My 15 mo. old loved the peppers!  My daughter said the chicken was her favorite.  My husband said it was a good mix of flavors and that we should make it again.

We used wheat free soy sauce/tamari and arrowroot starch to be corn free, due to allergies.

I have been making this recipe for years. One of my family's favorites from the site!  I have never had the mirin to make it. I usually throw in some wine and a little brown sugar. LOVE it. I make twice the amount of sauce because its delicious over the rice.  I always serve with rice pilaf.

I liked it......  but unfortunately I was the only one in my family that did.  Other reviewers reported great success with picky eaters, which is partly why I chose this recipe.....  but no dice with my crew. A few tips for others who want to try it: (1)carrots work well with the pineapple in this stir fry, and add nice color; just slice them fairly thin.  (2)Someone was confused about what to do with the pineapple juice, and got soggy veggies as a result.  I stirred all the juice from the pineapple can into the sauce, therefore adding it in the very last step, separate from the pineapple itself.  This worked very well; the finished sauce was a good thickness.

Very nice, quick and easy. I added mushrooms and broccoli. Next time I'll probably add some chilies as well to give it a bit of a kick. Will definitely make this again.

This creates a nice and tasty stir-fry.  I used fresh pineapple (I don't think canned pineapple tastes nearly as good).  I omitted the corn starch as I don't like the way it tastes and I also added some chopped fresh baby button mushrooms. I think the fresh pineapple is what makes the flavor so refreshing and tangy.

This is a great recipe. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of the breast. The fresh ginger was a really nice touch. I would only suggest you double the recipe for the sauce...not the pineapple, just the ingredients for the sauce.

This is a wonderful sweet sour chicken recipe.  I used leftover baked garlic chicken cut in chunks and just added to the veggies and sauce to heat through.  Delicious!  P.S.  I did have mirin in the refrigerator, but I believe I read somewhere that you could substitute rice vinegar mixed with a little corn syrup to give the stir fry that shiny glazed appearance.

I like this dish very much but hubby felt it tasted a little sour (his words) so I think next time I'll add about a teaspoon of brown sugar to the soy mixture to level things out. I am thinking the pineapple juice might not have been very sweet. I also added mushrooms and snow peas to the dish because I had them and needed to use them up. I recommend this dish.

Excellent! Hard to find asian recipes that aren't too salty. For those of you who don't have mirin use 3T dry sherry to 1T sugar. I also doubled the sauce. Will definitely make again.

I love that this recipe is so cost-effective and delicious! I just used what I had on hand and it worked great. It tastes great even without the wine or special vinegar. I just used plain vinegar and my husband and I loved it.

This was easy and tasty. I didn't have mirin, so like other reviewers, I used sweet red wine with a bit of honey. I subbed a regular onion for the green one and added a handful of mushrooms. Perfect over rice.

I thought it was bland and lacked any distinctive flavor. I was confused about adding the pineapple with or without the juice. I added the juice with the pineapple and perhaps that is what watered down the sauce. Another reviewer said she was also confused and did not add the juice, but we both came to the same conclusion, not enough flavor. Not sure what I did wrong, but would be willing to try again if the instructions were clear on the pineapple juice.

I did enjoy this recipe, however, it didn't quite have the oomph I was hoping for.  It may have been because I didn't use any mirin, which, unfortunately, I didn't have on hand. :(  In the future, I will definitely add the mirin as called for, a half-tablespoon or sriracha (thai hot sauce), 1/3 cup dry roasted cashews, and more garlic, ginger and if I have some on hand, cilantro too!

I like the recipe and it's a keeper!  I modified it to suit my taste and will be making this again.  I used many additional vegetables such as water chestnuts, straw mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower.

This was absolutely fantastic! Even the kids loved it. The only I'll change next time, is to add the pinapple AFTER I've cooked the rest, so they're not heated. This one is a GEM.

I love stir-fry and this recipe is a good start. However, I would not add pineapple as suggested in the recipe. Strain the pineapples and use the juice, but don't add the pineapple until the end. Better yet, use FRESH pineapple. It makes a world of difference. Buit still don't add it until the end. 

I try not to keep a bunch of specialty ingredients for recipes cluttering my cabinets, so I just used white vinegar and white wine instead of the specialty stuff. It worked fine. Also added a bit of red pepper flakes to kick it up a bit.

Didn't like it. And on top of that the directions were not very good- for example do you drain the pineapple or not? I did but then the other flavors over powered the pineapple and you couldn't really taste it.

good for stir fry, but stir fry itself isn't anything special. Used bamboo shoots as well and just regular white wine, but all in all despite this being a good recipe it isn't anything that "popped."

Wonderful! I did add a couple dashes of cayenne pepper to give it a kick as well as additional vegetables such as mushrooms, zucchini from the garden and even celery. Since I added additional veggies I added 1/2 cup of water to give it a bit more sauce. Perfect.. Will be making this over and over and over. Thanks for the recipe!

A decent, healthy stirfry. As-written it produces a tasty enough meal...but certainly no wow factor. I did really enjoy the ginger with this--and fresh pineapple. I will just keep searching for a better recipe...

Great recipe.  I would double the sauce though.  I used white wine and balsamic vinegar as that's what I had on hand.  I skipped the ginger as we don't care much for ginger.  I would definitely make this again.

I had to add a drizzle of honey towards end. Just wasnt sweet enough, that or the vinegar was to strong. Either way, after adding honey it was very tasty. If you like sweet and sour chicken you will enjoy this one.

Really tasty recipe and so modifiable! I like a lot of veggies, so I added snow peas, mixed fancy mushrooms, broccoli and carrots. I cooked the stiffer veggies first, then added in the lighter ones as I went. I also used a bit of honey instead of the sweet wine and fresh pineapple. I'm not huge on sauces, so the regular amount was just right. Hubby loved it and it hit all the right notes as far as nutrition and taste! I'll definitely make it again. Thanks!!

I've made this a couple of times since my initial review and still love the recipe. My hubby, however, thought that the pineapple flavor wasn't strong enough. Yesterday I put the pineapple and juice into a sauce pan and let it cook down a bit while I prepared the rest of the ingredients. At the end, I added a Tablespoon of mango vinegar (Mangue). It was even better than the first times I made it. 

I will DEFINITELY  make this one again. It was so easy and had so much wonderful flavor. I used 1# of chicken tenders which gave a lot of surface area for the sauce to coat. We aren't big fans of a lot of ginger so I cut down the amount but otherwise followed the directions and it was fantastic. The original didn't say whether or not to use the pineapple juice so I decided to pour it into the pot with the pineapple. That was definitely the right choice. Thanks for sharing.

Good mix of ingredients for a stir fry! I added mushrooms too.  I would recommend starting with less sugar in the sauce and slowly adding to taste. I ended up adding extra garlic and ginger to the sauce as well. I put in all the pineapple juice and doubled the amount of sauce. I cut up green onions on top and I think crushed peanuts would have been a nice touch for next time.

The flavors were all great together, it was just very strong.  But I did make a lot of changes.
I doubled the sauce since I served it over brown rice.  I used half braggs amino acids and half tamari soy sauce, added a little cayenne, used rice vinegar instead of white wine vin, used white wine, added honey, minced garlic and freshly grated ginger.  I marinated the cut up chicken for severals hours before cooking, and the chicken was pretty good.  I sauteed the green onions and sliced carrots for a minute, then added the red & yellow peppers, then added the sauce and chicken.  I cut fresh pineapple and threw it in at the last minute.  The proportions of chicken to rice to sauce was perfect, I will just need to play around with the ingredients to adjust the flavor a bit.  But everyone else went back for seconds!

I substituted the mirin with a VQA Pellar Estate (Ontario) riesling/ brown sugar combo and used fresh pineapple.
I made a double batch.
Delicious!

AMAZING! Better than most restaurants! Very picky kids said "awesome" and "I love it". I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used 1 tablespoon sake instead. Served with white rice and not a bite leftover.

This was pretty good, although not as much as I was hoping for. I was hoping it'd have more of a sweet-and-spicy taste to it, but it was really more sweet-and-sour. I think next time I'll add some chili flakes, or something like that, to give it a bit more kick. I also added a tablespoon of sugar (because the sauce tasted very acidic to me) and some more veggies from the fridge, and doubled the sauce--my family loves sauce. The outcome was tasty and enjoyable, but it could've been much better IMO!

Very good, very easy.  I used yellow onion instead of green and honey instead of mirin.  Kids loved it too.

This was really good. I had only ginger in a spice jar and used the same amount as the fresh. I also had only a little left over sauteed peppers & onions (about 1/4 cup) so that's all I used. This was perfect-nothing needs to be changed or enhanced. Even my picky 8 yr. old loved it!

This was great!  We made it on our vacation in Hawaii for our friends and it didn't disappoint!  Just be careful not to over simmer, because it could get mushy.

Defintely needs more sauce!  We also added hot chili sauce which gave it some zip.

Quick & easy. I had everything on hand, so it was a snap. It was a bit sweeter than I expected though. Perhaps more ginger would help with this. All in all a good recipe that I'd make again.

Very easy recipe. I mixed the juice from the pineapple with the sauce ingredients.I also added some sliced zucchini. We ate it with super spicy homemade chili paste-but we put it on all asian-type foods.  My 8 year old ate everything but picked out the pineapple. Wouldn't serve for company, but an easy weeknight dinner with steamed jasmine rice.
