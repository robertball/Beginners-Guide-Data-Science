This was very good and very easy to prepare. I used a bit more garlic than was called for - just my personal preference. I would have preferred this with more of a spicy kick - perhaps some cumin chili powder or a bit of jalapeno but again that's just my preference. This dish was full of flavor and the chicken was tender and delicious.
