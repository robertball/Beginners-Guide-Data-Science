Used a 2 lb pork butt.  Cut into 1/2 in. slices.  Browned meat added onions for a minute or 2.  Put in my electric pressure cooker.  Added remaining ingredients.  Cooked 45 minutes.  Removed from PC Spooned into tortillas. Rolled up.  Placed in baking dish. Sprinkled with cheese.  Put in 350 degree oven til cheese melts or you could also put under broiler.  In a hurry?  Warm tacos & just put in a bowl & let everyone make their own tacos.

This was excellent!  The only thing I did different was add the green chiles in the crock pot a couple of hours before the pork was done cooking.  Great taste!

Why are these cooks rating a recipe they haven't cooked???????  This isn't a "comment" site.. it is for ratings so we can make an informed decision about making it or not.  drives me crazy.....

Anyway -- this is very good as is.  I made one in the slow cooker a few weeks ago with not much seasoning and this was great in comparison.

Terrific!  Very easy & tasty.  Only change I would make for next time would be to use hot Enchilada sauce instead of medium.  We tend to like things a little spicier around here!

This recipe is a favorite in our house. I cook it just as the recipe states but once I shred it I put in a 9" x 13" pan add another can of enchilada sauce (not the sauce from the crock pot because it's greasy), a can of drained black beans, a can of drained corn, and a can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I mix it all together and top it with shredded chedder cheese and cover it with aluminum foil. I bake it at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. When it's done I scoop it onto burritoes. Or serve it with tortilla chips.

I give this 5 stars for flavor and ease of preparation, but I didn't like using the juice from the pot; it was too runny. Next time, I'd try a fresh can of enchilada sauce or maybe try mixing the juice with some tomato paste...something to give it body so there isn't juice running out of the tortilla. I'll make this again though; we loved the flavor!

Not a fan of this recipe.  We thought it was kind of bland and greasy.  As another reviewer recommended, using another can of enchilada sauce instead of the greasy sauce from the slow cooker probably would have improved it.  I used a 3.6 lb. pork shoulder that bone and skin, but still ended up with less meat than the recipe was supposed to make, and as a result, the meat was pretty runny with the sauce added.

Use a pork loin instead of the shoulder to cut down the greasiness. Opened my enchilada sauce to find out it wasn't red. I had accidentally bought the green chili enchilada sauce. I added a can of rotel to the recipe. It was wonderful. Thinking this meat may be good to use in flautas. Never made them but just might try. Have a great day!

Made carnitas for dinner last night.  I added red and yellow peppers along with the onions to the crock pot. I found the sauce a little bland(we like really spicy food) so II added a little anchor chili powder, cayenne , garlic salt and cumin and a dash of Louisiana Hot Sauce.  My family loved it... Made plenty so I will freeze leftover mer for another cold evening.

Because I'm lazy, I just sliced onions and a few small sweet peppers, threw them in the crock pot and put cut up pork roast on top, sprinkled taco seasoning on that and dumped the can of enchilada sauce over that.  Cooked on all day while I was at work (11 hours on low) and it was perfect when I got home!  Dumped in the chiles because I forgot to remove the pork first, but it didn't matter.  I just shredded the pork in the crock pot and it all mixed together just right.  I feel that it just needed a bit more spice after sampling, but it was still really good and not so hot that the kids can't eat it :)

So you understand....I am not a big pork lover...but this dish was fabulous.  I didn't cook it in the crock pot I put it in the oven at 300 for about six hours.  I will definitely make this again and will have guests over to enjoy it.

Saved the day! I got lucky and had all the ingredients. made only a few changes. I had corn tortillas instead and heated them up, filled them up and then poured the enchilada sauce on and sprinkled with more cheese and baked for 15 minutes. I've never had better enchiladas. Thank you!

I liked this recipe but did make a few changes. I added a can of rinsed beans when I added the chilis. I too thought that it lacked some flavor. Surprising with the taco mix and enchilada sauce. I would consider adding canned jalapeños the next time or using spicy enchilada sauce.

This one was a no-brainer, super-tasty, and easy as pie to make. It has gone into my weeknight dinner list...yeah for crock pots! My 9yo said "oh, oh, spicy mom!" and then munched down three tacos like there was no tomorrow. Winner!

I have made this recipe multiple times for my husband and I and we both love it. It always turns out great with tons of flavor. I also add the chiles into the crockpot a couple hours before it is finished.

This was good, but next time I'm going to use fresh green chiles or possibly jalapeno's instead of canned. The canned ones just didn't add enough to the overall flavor.

This is perfect for those busy days.  It takes just minutes to put together and then forget it.   When you're ready, just shred some cheese and add a dollop with sour cream and you have a tasty and filling meal.

I used pork chop loins, generic enchiladas sauce and also McCormick powder version other times and it turned out wonderful both ways but yet to try the actual El Paso sauce. I only have tomatoes with green chili canned were my only changes to this and have even done a healthy stew version of this with carrots and celery and still manage to get the family to eat it with this.

I didn't use any of the sauce from the crockpot because it was so greasy but I used a new can of enchilada sauce. I also added jalapenos and green chili's at the beginning. It was so delicious and even better the second day. Will be making again.

This meat was amazing! I used a recipe for homemade taco seasoning (https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222165/homemade-taco-seasoning-mix/), and did all cooking in my dutch oven (started on the stove top and finished in the oven on low heat for a few hours). Apart, from being slightly greasy (of course, pork shoulders aren't THE most lean selection of meat), I find no fault with this recipe. 

BONUS: I found that the leftover meat can be made to use flautas (filled flour tortillas rolled up and fried). Fixed those for a potluck, and they were gone except for like two because we simply could eat no more. Everyone went back for seconds, some went back for thirds. Can't recommend this recipe enough!

Sadly, with the amount of time and energy put into this recipe, the blandness of this recipe was shocking.   I followed the recipe as written and found it amazingly unsatisfying.

First time making this. Wanted something pretty easy. Used a pork loin instead of the pork shoulder. Turned out great. The flavor was excellent. Look forward to making this again.

I doubled the spices except the cinnamon.  It was very moist and tender.

This  was easy and wonderful. I did not add the green chiles to keep it mild. My family ate so much we did not have left overs. Will definitely make this again.

This is the second time I've made this recipe to the letter, and it's turned out fantastically well both times. You can change the toppings around if you wish, but leave the recipe the way it is!

This is a great recipe and I have made it several times. Include some condiments such as pickled red onion, avocado, cucumber, and jalapenos.

We love Mexican food.  We have family in AZ and that's all we eat when we visit.  My husband's grandmother made their own enchilada sauce with chiles from Hatch, and my in-laws have carried on the tradition.  We grow our own green chiles, jalapenos, and tomatoes.  We grow, dehydrate and crush our own red peppers.  You get the picture.  Having said all that, I do love me some El Paso products, and I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

Very good !  Would be yummy over rice as well...will making this again soon.  Also, this would be good for a large group or party as I thought it was better the next day.
