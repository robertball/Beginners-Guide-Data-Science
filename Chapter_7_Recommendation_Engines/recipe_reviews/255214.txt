Super easy and my kind of breakfast. The only change I made is that I used a shredded mexi cheese blend because I already had it on hand. I cooked my egg until it was set as directed but over-easy would work great for those who like their eggs that way. I think the only thing I would do different next time is heat the beans up before spreading on the toast.

I think I made this thicker than others, and so I had to eat it like an open-faced sandwich rather than a piece of toast.  However, it was delicious! I will make it just as thick the next time! No regrets!

I was looking for something different for lunch so I thought I would give this a try.  I took the advice of soup loving Nicole and warmed up the beans in the microwave. I also cooked the egg over easy. The recipe was easy to make and quite tasty. Thanks for sharing.
