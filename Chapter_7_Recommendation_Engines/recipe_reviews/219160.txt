I made this soup as written and it is delicious! It was a perfect dinner for a chilly night.  I will make it again and add some chopped onion because I love onions, but other than that, it's great just as it is!  Thanks for the great recipe!

As I rate this, I'm snackin' on it for breakfast with some fresh baked bread. I added half a diced onion and a ton of chopped kale. Didn't have chili powder so I used extra cayenne and a bit too much of my favorite hot sauce. The final product was too spicy for my taste but a dollop of sour cream perfected it. This is a great recipe with lots of room to play with the ingredients. Next time I'm thinking of a mushroom medley in there.

Very disappointing. 
I was so excited to try this recipe given the 5 star rating average.  HOWEVER, after the 8 hours of anticipation, I was left very disappointed that the flavor was quite bland.
Not worth the time, $$, or effort. So sad. :(

After reading the other reviews I added kale and onions to this recipe.  We served it over brown rice.  Although everyone in my family ate this, no one asked me to make it again.  It has a lot of flavor, but just seemed like something was missing and I'm not sure what.  I put a splash of balsamic vinegar in my bowl and thought that improved the flavor a bit.  If I ever cook this again I will probably try adding tomatoes to the recipe for a richer, tangier flavor.

I made this for dinner last night.  It smelled so good cooking all day.  I did add some onions, but other than that I fixed it as directed.  My son loved it and took a large container home with him.  I just had a bowl for lunch today and it was so delicious!

I'm trying to stick to the Mediterranean Diet and lower my cholesterol, so this recipe DEFINITELY fits my dietary needs right now.  To my dismay, my husband brought home about 5-6 pounds of turnips when he came home one day from work!  What on EARTH am I supposed to do with turnips?  This was what I thought on Friday.  Well, I looked at your website and knew I'd figure it out.  Thank you SO MUCH for posting this recipe!  It will be used again in my house and I won't shy away from turnips in the future.  I thought that the cinnamon added an interesting flavor and I really didn't even notice the bitterness of the turnips.  I added a little bit of diced onion and also a bay leaf that I shredded up.  My husband suggested that I add chicken to this in the future and we'll see what the leftovers are like tomorrow with the chicken that I added to this soup.  It sounds like this is a vegetarian soup, but I added about one piece of baked chicken to this.  THANKS AGAIN, CINDY!

This was pretty good! I thought it would have a little more flavor. Next time I might use some vegetable stock. I didn't keep it on high for 8 hours- my slow cooker gets really hot. My husband was home all day watching it and I think he turned it to low or warm before the 8 hours were up, and it turned out well. We ate it with some flavored brown rice. Great for a cool fall night!

I did sauté an onion before making this on top of the stove and threw in a tablespoon of chicken broth powder.  I wanted a large pot full so i used a pound of lentils, 2 pounds of frozen spinach and the same amount of veggies.  I did triple the spices due to the larger amount of liquid.  I'm glad I didn't triple the amount of vegetables because the pot was totally full.  It was ready in less than an hour.  I was apprehensive about using all the spices but after reading the reviews, I went ahead and did so.  Glad I did, because the taste is wonderful!  Reminds me of a Moroccan stew!  Will def be making this again!

I added broccoli instead of spinach and added more spices than in the original recipe. My crockpot cooked this in about 4 hours on high instead of 8.

I made this for us while we were on a cleanse, and both my husband and I really liked it. It is a hearty soup that sticks with you. Unfortunately, I forgot to put in the spinach, so we'll have to put it back on the winter menu and remember that step this time!

Doubled all the herbs and spices except for the garlic and still found this quite bland. Added some salt, lemon juice, and a can of diced tomatoes and that helped. A good start that turns out well with a few modifications.

This was ok, not knock your socks off. I added more garlic and an onion. I also used a can of vegetable broth and threw in a ham shank to flavor the broth. It was healthy and easy. I'll probably make it again.

Thanks Cindy!  My newly vegetarian boyfriend raved that it was so much like beef stew.  I added onion and doubled the spices.  It will be a staple at our house.  It's fantastic!

WOW!  I made this soup and the smell of it alone was tantalizing everyone in the house.  I doubled the recipe (mistakenly forgot the garlic) for 4 and it made enough for 6.  My husband and his friends all enjoyed a medium size bowl of it and there was some to spare.   It was quite spicy and everyone LOVED  it.  I highly recommend you make this soup!

This could've been really amazing, but I agree with the post about it being really bland.  I followed the recipe as listed, but should've used recommendations from other users.  Will definitely try again but next time will use broth rather than water, some onion...not sure what else.  Oh, I did add celery though.  Has potential!

One of my favorites. I do lots of variations on the veggies (turnips, parsnips, rutabagas, mixed fingerling potatoes, etc) but the spice mix is a winner, especially if you add some organic veg broth as well as water. One recommendation: throw in the spinach at the very end and it will add texture as well as flavor, instead of turning to mush after a full day's cooking. I also vary the lentils if I have a lot of veg, just to trade bulk for flavor. A fun base to play with, and the house will always smell awesome!

I enjoyed the combination of root vegetables. However, next time I will use less spinach and add more lentils. An onion would be good too.

The flavor  was good. I subbed beef broth for the water. I doubled the recipe and I wished I wouldn't have doubled the lentils. It was too overpowered by lentils. The turnip was delicious.  I doubled all the spices except the cinnamon. 
We put a dollop of sour cream in top and it was very good.

What a GREAT soup! Made it yesterday and we had for dinner tonight. Even my picky 7 yr old cleaned his bowl. After reading other reviews I too modified it to our tastes. Sautéed onions with 5 crushed garlic cloves, then added sliced organic cremini mushrooms. Used 2 Veg broth cubes in about 8 cups of H20, substituted frozen organic Kale for the spinach and doubled the spices (except cayenne as I didn't have any)and put in fresh ginger vs powder. Didn't have turnip either so chopped up some fresh roma tomatoes. Cooked on high in crock pot as directed yesterday, then set to low for 4 hours today. YUM! This soup is very easy, versatile and delicious. Thanks for sharing Cindy!

I made some adjustments to the recipe based on the reviews. I added 1 chopped onion, a full 6oz. bag of fresh chopped spinach, 1 extra carrot and potato. I omitted the turnips(don't like them), and added a tomato, two stalks of celery. I also doubled the spices but omitted the cinnamon (husband not a fan) and covered the mixture with veggie broth. Overall, a great crockpot recipe.

Tried this yesterday and it was a big hit (well, with ME and Jackie, anyway!) And if our friends don't like it...well, tough! All the more for us.) Thanks, Cindy!
I stuck with the recipe except I didn't have the fresh Basil. No biggy...just doubled up on the dried.
BONUS, I DID have fresh ginger, so doubled up on that too, using my cheese grater. Yummmmmmyyyyyy!
Also, you can make this recipe in HALF the time by nuking the turnip, carrots and potatoes till tender first, then chucking them into a big soup pot with the lentils, herbs and spices. Bring everything to a boil then simmer for two or three hours. Leave chunky...or put it through the processor for a creamy bowl of heaven!

This soup was so hearty and yummy!! I'm not a great cook without amazing recipes like this, it made me proud to share it and show it off! And even great as leftovers. The only I will change for next time will be to put a little less cinnamon. It was perfect when fresh, but as my lunch the next day, the cinnamon stood out more to me.

We liked this very much. But the recipe says makes 2 servings. I knew that was wrong. But wondered if something had gone awry with the posting. The spices amounts didn’t seem to jibe with the rest of the ingredients. I did follow the recipe but next time will increase the spices. It’s a keeper!!

This stuff smelled great in the Crock-Pot but when dinnertime arrived, it was a bland, watery mess.  Each time I heated up a bowl for leftovers, I tried to add something (onion flakes, garlic salt, even Worcestershire sauce) to make it taste better, but nothing worked.  Never again!

Very bland and not worth the effort. Disappointing.

After reading the reviews saying it was too bland, I tried to dress it up with beef broth, a can of diced tomatoes and some ginger.

My husband liked it, but I wasn't so sure. I need to try it again with just the base recipe - I think only the tomatoes should have stayed.

Awesome!  I added a can of diced tomatoes and a chopped onion.  Very healthy, filling soup.
