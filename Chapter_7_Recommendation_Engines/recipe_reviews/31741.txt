There's no reason to add so many extra calories and fat to zucchini! The tastiest way to eat my favorite veggie is brush with olive oil, garlic powder, and black pepper and grill until tender. It's superb!

This was pretty good, but the large amounts of cheese was overwhelming and unnecessary.  The second time I made it, I did it by the recipe, but I eliminated the pepper jack and cheddar.  Parmesan only was perfect!  Also, it is unnecessary to microwave it.  Just grill it in an AL foil boat, and then at the end, sprinkle on cheese, and let it continue to cook on the grill for 5 more minutes.

I LOVE zucchini this way, but I made changes: I cut up the zuc and let it sit in the dressing for as long as it takes for the grill to heat up (gas grill) then microwave the zuc in the dressing for a few minutes then throw on the grill for a few min, turn when the zuc gets grill marks, then top w/ grated parm and let cook for a few min longer - I like them when the perimeters become charred :)

This is good, but way too much cheese.  I cut it down a lot.  I also brushed mine with balsamic about one minute before removing them -- personal preference. I also threw a garlic clove in the marinade.  Good, but can be made better.

Zucchini grills well by itself with just butter. All that cheese and Italian dressing is too much , it overpowers the squash.

Excellent and easy.  I used a stove top grill and just grilled, no microwaving.

Not bad.  I did it without the extra cheese.  Just a little Parmesan at the end.  I liked the crispiness of the sticks instead of the coins.

Great recipe, I used a raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing which is awesome... quick change, but the recipe has a solid fondation.

We really didn't like it enough to make a second time. But it was edible.
