I made this with MARSHMALLOW FLUFF!!!! I definitely recommend to do it this way! Based on the previous reviews of saying to wait till the melted marshmallows cooled, I skipped the melting the marshmallows and water step and I placed a whole container of marshmallow fluff into the refrigerator over night. The next morning, I sprayed my kitchen aid very well with PAM, dumped the whole container of Marshmallow fluff into the KA and food coloring and confectioner/powdered sugar as needed. This really was not that difficult or messy at all. When the fondant was at a good consistency, I placed it into plastic wrap and into the freezer for about a 1/2 hour. I then rolled it out and it rolled really nicely. I used this fondant to cover a barbie doll cake than I made for my daughter's birthday! I spread a very thin layer of regular frosting onto the cakes surface to make sure the fondant would stick to the cake. It came out great!

I've used a very similar version of this recipe for years. It is WORLDS better than any prepackaged fondant you can buy, in ease of use, in taste, and especially economically. I've never added the extra vanilla, though I've occasionally added different flavoring oils. I've also never used the butter in this recipe, with no problems. A tip: If you need colored fondant, add the color to the hot marshmallow mixture before you start adding sugar. Otherwise you'll have to knead in the color later, which will result in technicolor hands and a potentially off texture. **Edit: Yesterday I used this recipe to make chocolate fondant. I added Americolor chocolate brown color to the melted marshmallows, and I also kneaded in about 1/2 cup sifted cocoa with the confectioner's sugar. After coating with shortening, wrapping in plastic and allowing to sit overnight, it was a bit dry, but water didn't help; I had to knead in some extra shortening to get it to a good texture (which didn't take long). Instead of dusting the countertop with confectioner's sugar when rolling it out, I just greased it with a little bit of shortening - it prevented sticking and gave the fondant a nice shine.

For all you skeptics/"I'm not good enough"/"I can't do it"/doubters out there, YOU CAN DO THIS!  It is soooooooo easy.  I'm VERY new to cake/cupcake baking/decorating (just started playing around for fun in Oct 08).    I made this last night for a legal pad sheet cake (11X15, my very first sheet cake) and it was super easy.  I melted the marshmallows and added the water and vanilla...then panicked because I couldn't get it smooth.  No prob, just kept nuking at 30 sec intervals.  AT THIS POINT, I ADDED GEL FOOD COLORING to get my desired color (soooo much easier than adding at the kneading stage like I did the other time!).  I added as much 10X sugar as I could w/a spoon, then turned it onto my HEAVILY GREASED (I use Crisco) counter to knead the rest in.    I am impatient, so I attempted to roll it out and use it the same night I made it.  Didn't work (however, it would have worked if I'd been using it for cut outs/decorations, just not for covering an entire cake).   I put it back in a ball, rubbed some more shortening on it, then wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the frig til morning.  After letting it warm, I rolled it on a cutting board sprinkled w/corn starch and had no problem getting it on the cake (I simply inverted the cutting board over the cake!).  I want to also add that it was INCREDIBLY HUMID when I made this and it STILL worked super well.  I'm telling you, give this a try; people will think you are a baking ROCK STAR for very minimal effort!  TY for post

EDIT!!!!!! Don't use butter!  Use Crisco... And yes it is hard to work with until you get the right consistency, just keep adding the powered sugar and it will work.....   I found this recipe on-line last year and have been using it ever since.  I use it on my sugar cookies and everyone always asks me what kind of frosting I used then never believe me when I tell them it is just marshmallows.  Defiantly a keeper for me!

I've been wondering where this recipe was...couldn't believe it wasn't on AR yet.  I have used this a couple times and just love it.  It is so easy and tastes sooo much better than the store bought fondant.  The only thing I do differently is that I use vegetable shortening (Crisco) instead of melted butter to coat my hands and the counter when working with it, works wonders. Also this recipe comes out more ivory than white...so if you want a white fondant you can get the Wilton's Icing Color White-White (comes in a small 2 oz. bottle) to add to your fondant. Works wonders!

This was fun & easy. Adult PLAY-DOUGH! I made this fondant for first time - ever - & it turned out very nicely! Do increase the melting in microwave as much as needed, in 30 second intervals, (remember the water!) stirring in between. Stir in some of powdered sugar, plop the rest of the sugar on top, & then dump it onto a very well-greased surface. Expect to knead in most of the sugar - it's easier than stirring! Give fondant a film of butter/shortening before wrapping it to rest in fridge. To roll out, instead of powdered sugar, I sifted a small amount of cornstarch on counter & then top, rubbing each in. If it cracks, then knead in a 1/2 teaspoon of water. Your environment's humidity & temperature may require incrementally adding 2-3 teaspoons water. I used Wilton's "Icing Colors" which is a gel, and also tried Tree of India's all-natural liquid coloring. (T of I's yellow - from turmeric - is brilliant, their blue -from red cabbage - makes a deep purple, & their red - from beets - makes a flesh color!) This tastes exactly like its ingredients. Do not be intimidated; give your creative being the chance to play!

I'm reviewing the making process only as I have my fondant in the fridge now and I'll update it after I've used it. I found this very easy to make for my first time fondant making! For those who aren't sure how many cups to use: 16oz bag marshmallows =10 cups; 2lb icing sugar =8 cups. I needed smaller amounts of colored fondant and divided this into 5 batches, making each separately. (perfect for accent colors on your cake or cupcakes). Use 2 cups marshmallows, 2.5tsp water, 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1.5cups of icing sugar for each batch. the butter, I just put a little on my fingers when first kneading. I added the color in while mixing, and it worked great! Cant wait to make my jungle cupcakes with this!

Hallelujah, it worked!  This is the 3rd marshmallow fondant recipe I've tried in 3 days.  Both of the others were huge flops.  I'm making a cake for my parent's anniversary party and was desperate to find a good recipe for the fondant and this was it.  It's PERFECT!  Thank you!

I use this recipe for my business. and let me tell you! its idiot proof. i used the metal bowl that comes with all kitchen aid appliance and i melted the marshmallows in that bowl. you place the bowl over a pot of boiling water.....let it steam until all the marshmallow is melted. than place the bowl on your mixer with the dough hook attachment. follow the recipe by adding the powder sugar slowly

To get a TRUE RED colour, use cocoa powder instead of icing sugar when kneading, then use the gel colour red from the little tub that you can only buy at specialty stores (like Michael's) as opposed to the little bottles of liquid that you can purchase at any grocery store. Dying icing or fondant red from a white base will result in pink without the addition of A LOT of dye, and even then I have never been overly pleased with the red I ended up with. Starting from a brown base will take you to a deeper red tone with less colouring.The fondant may be a little more brittle than other colours after refrigeration, but kneading with more butter will bring back the elasticity and prevent it from cracking when working with it. I apply the same technique when going for black as well :)

Well, after reading LTH's review of this fondant, I'll just say - yep. It's that easy. This was also my first attempt at fondant. I only needed cutouts to make pig ears, eyes, and snouts. I kneaded with my KA mixer and took out some white fondant before adding the pink gel coloring. For the ears I cut triangles out with a knife, then curled and formed them on waxed paper. I let them dry and added them to the frosted cookies. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks Kiele!

Great Fondant!!! I have been looking for one that's not so intimidating...and this is great!!! Taste good too! Only thing I did different was after mixing all the ingredients, I wrapped it with the saran wrap then kneaded from there. It did not stick nor was it as messy as I thought! This is a keeper!

**TIP*** Use a stand mixer with a bread hook to do all the kneading for you.  Same result without the sticky mess.  I slowly added the sugar, then let it "knead" in the machine for about 10 minutes, then refrigerated in saran wrap I had sprayed with no stick cooking spray.  When I was ready to use it I did some hand kneading on a counter dusted with cornstarch.  Came out perfect and I had very little mess.  It looked beautiful on the cake and everyone was impressed. Also - this can be stored in the fridge for a LONG time.  Mine was stored about a month before I used it and I still have more.  What can go bad?  It's just sugar and more sugar - that never goes bad, right?

Wow!! This was my first try using fondant. It was so simple and tasted better than expected. A few things I learned:

*Half of this recipe covers a two layer 9" round cake.

*Crisco is your best friend! Use it to grease everything, including the knife you use to cut shapes and the clear wrap you wrap it in. (no butter needed... Crisco is flavorless and leaves a shine)

*Melted the marshmallows in a steel KitchenAid mixing bowl over a pot of bowling water (prevents burning/exploding marshmallows). Move the bowl right to the KA and use the dough hook to knead the dough. Plan on kneading for a while. 

*No need to measure out the powdered sugar. It is ready when you lift the KA top and the dough is stiff. When touched, it will stick to your finger, but barely. I made two batches, both times when it was getting to the right consistency, it tended to occasionally make a snapping/popping noise while being kneaded (like cracking gum).

*Two hours in the fridge was enough for half a batch.

*Colors seemed to brighten after being in the fridge and rekneaded.

*If you mess up on a shape, and the fondant is getting warm, it is best to stick it back in the fridge for a bit. Otherwise it tends to be hard to cut and snags.

*When covering a whole cake, it is SO much easier w/ two people.

Enjoy!!

I love this recipe, but leave out the vanilla, and use additional powdered sugar instead of butter to get a nice cermic type look instead of a shiny greasy one. If it's a dry daY I have to add another tablespoon of water.

This is one of my most valuable and used recipes.  It has done wonders for my cakes and my bottom line! I think it takes color better than traditional fondant, the colors are brighter and more true in shade. I've made it many times now and have learned a few tips.  If you are using gel or paste colors do not add these until after you have finished adding the sugar and are in the final kneading stage, otherwise the texture will be off.  Adding glucose to the fondant (when making decorations or figures) makes it more pliable and it will take an extra day to dry out.  Use shortening when working with the fondant.  I started out using confectioners' sugar to keep it form sticking like I had been with traditional fondant and it totally dries out the marshmallow fondant.  Give it a try, you'll be pleased with the results and the flavor.  I skip the vanilla so my fondant stays white.

After reading many reviews, getting advice on the recipe exchange, and watching you tube videos, I decided to give fondant a try.  Here is what I did to make it work.  1)  I used my KA mixer with the dough hook to knead the fondant.  Before kneading I put a small coat of crisco on the hook and bowl. I didn't use any butter at all. 2)  To roll it out the next morning, I coated the counter with Crisco, didn't work too well, then tried powdered sugar which went much better.  Before handling the fondant I rubbed crisco into my hands to keep it from sticking.  3)  To make the fondant cutouts stick to the fondant covered cake, I placed them on a damp towel for a minute and gently patted them down.  This gave them the right amount of "stickiness" to make them stay on the cake.

This was my first experience with fondant - making it and decorating with it. I was very happy with the taste and the ease of using it for decorating. However, I felt the directions for making it are very difficult, particularly step 2. Since trying this recipe, I found a way I like much better. I pour most of the bag of powdered sugar onto a mat on my table, and make a well in center of it. Then I add the cooled melted marshmallow mixture to the well and begin scooping the powdered sugar up and over the mm mixture with my greased hands. I keep doing this over and over for several minutes until the mm mixture is no longer runny and not as sticky to the touch. Then I begin the kneading process. When I tried adding the powdered sugar as stated in this recipe, it was nearly impossible with the beaters after about one cup of sugar. I've made the fondant now about 6 times with my new approach and LOVE it.

Very good and very easy.  I covered my cake with regular buttercream frosting (crumbs in the frosting are ok).  I rolled out the fondant on a laminated pastry mat covered with a thin film of shortening.  I flipped the mat over and positioned it on the cake, peeled off the fondant, smoothed it down, and trimmed off the excess with a spatula.  To marble your fondant:  divide your dough in half.  Tint the dough balls with different colors of decorator gel (or keep one white).  Roll them out into logs about 10 inches long and twist (or braid if you have 3 logs) them together.  Knead them SLIGHTLY, trying not to overwork them as the color will become more uniform the more you mix it.  Roll it out a bit and knead a little bit more and roll out to your desired diameter.

Love it!! I did not add the butter of the vanilla, I used imitation almond extract instead. If it seems too dry and is cracking, just add shortening!!!

I have been using this recipe for a very long time and it is as easy and tasty as all the earlier reviewers have said.  One note: I add 2 Tbls of glycerin (available at cake decorating stores or use 2 Tbls corn syrup) to the melted marshmallows and 1/2 tsp of popcorn salt (very fine grain salt).  The glycerin (or corn syrup) will make the fondant more pliable and the salt just makes the flavors more intense.  Also, you do not need to refrigerate this at all.  Wrap it in greased plastic wrap and then place into a ziplock bag with all the air squeezed out.  It will keep for a long time at room temp.

Yay for fondant!!!  First time, and I can't wait to try it again!  I used my KitchenAid, and I did 1/2 a recipe at a time, because I was worried about the motor as per other reviews, and I wanted to colour the mix before the sugar went in, and I had several colours to do.  I found the 1/2 recipe very manageable, and no problem whatsoever for the mixer.  I microwaved the marshmellows with 1tbsp water, when they were melted, I dumped into the mixer and added 1 more tbsp water and the vanilla. I mixed that all together with the dough hook, and then started adding the colour and sugar until the desired consistency and colour were reached.  Once it formed a ball, I wrapped and put it in the fridge.  I made one the night before, and one about 2 hours before I used it, and both turned out great.  I kneaded them a couple times before rolling out, but that was it.  It wasn't sticky, and  I was able to roll it out to 1/4" thickness with ease.  I used a silicone mat, which I started out with cornstarch, but switched to butter for greasing.  It was so easy!!!  I kept the mess factor down, by greasing EVERYTHING I used with butter, the microwave bowl for the marshmellows, the mixing bowl, the dough hook, the spatula and spoons I used, the rolling pin...everything.  After a 5 minute soak in hot water, no problem to clean whatsoever.  YAY!!! As I said, can't wait to make more cakes!!

This was my first time making fondant and I did a ton of research on it.   I decided to make this recipe because I didn't need to go purchase a candy thermometer.  I'd definitely do this again.  I followed the suggestion that I use marshmallow fluff (though mine didn't add up to the same volume, so I melted a few ounces of regular - large - marshmallows).  It worked really well.    I also followed the suggested to heavily grease (I used butter) every surface that the stuff touched, particularly my Kitchenaid mixer.    I probably added two times (at least) the amount of confectioners sugar when I was starting to roll it out, but that may be because I live in an extremely humid area.    The toughest part really was transferring the sheet of fondant to the cake.  My husband suggested I roll it out on bakers' paper (the best I've found is called Non-Stick Baking Liner - far superior to any parchment or wax paper that I've found), and then transfer it to the cake that way - peel it off the paper.  That worked really well.  I cut polka dots out to cover the "problem" areas, and it turned out cuter than I'd even thought.  Someone, somewhere, suggested using vodka to adhere the embellishments to the fondant-covered cake and that worked splendidly.    One recipe yielded a whole lot and I had leftovers.  I covered a two-tiered 10" and 6" cake with it and probably have enough to do another of the same size.

I've always liked the look of fondant but it just tastes so awful! Then I found this recipe and thought I'd try it. But before I had time to I came across and signed up to take a fondant class. At the 1st class the instructor said marshmallow fondant is far better taste-wise (and cost-wise) to use on a cake but the store bought stuff is better when making 3-D decorations. (I'll have to test that for myself.) So before the 2nd class I whipped up a batch using this recipe and found it to be very easy to make. I did microwave the marshmallows at 30 sec intervals until melted, then used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix everything together, making sure to grease the bowl and dough hook very well with shortening prior to adding the ingredients. The mixer did the kneading for the most part, then I completed the kneading on a large, greased plastic cutting board. I think you could do it on a greased countertop if need be. It worked great! 2nd class came and the instructor told us if the marshmallow fondant is too hard to knead when you're ready to use it you can zap it in the microwave for just a couple of seconds and it becomes pliable again. Use caution when microwaving it, it only takes a couple of seconds. I haven't tried coloring the fondant yet but I don't see that it would be a problem whether you add the coloring to the melted marshmallows first or knead it into the finished fondant.

This was very easy! And the best advice I've seen by far (not sure if it was on this board or another) was to colour the marshmallow mix after adding the water but BEFORE adding the confectioner's sugar. This helped me avoid getting technicolour hands and ensured a nice even colour from the beginning, reducing the kneading required to work the colour in. In my case, I split my marshmallow, water & vanilla mix 5 ways and added different colours of die to each bowl. Then I added confectioner's sugar to each bowl separately. I also kneaded in a little extra confectioner's sugar, knowing I was making figurines, so they'd harden a bit.

This is a wonderful fondant recipe. Easy to make & it tastes great! I always grease a glass bowl with Crisco & zap a bag of marshmallows for 1 minute in the microwave. Then I add the water, CLEAR vanilla, & sift about 5 cups of powdered sugar. After mixing with a greased spatula (crisco, crisco, crisco) grease up your hands and start mixing it by hand. 

You can portion it out and add your color right away. Roll it in your hands and work the color in. Wrap each individual color in saran wrap and refrigerate. 

When it's had time to rest & cool for a few hours just roll it out with powdered sugar and PRESTO--you're a professional baker :)

Fantastic fondant. Try this no mess version. I grease a large glass bowl with Crisco and melt the marshmallows in that. I then stir in the water. I dump that mixture into my KA mixer that has most of the powdered sugar in it. (reserve some of the powdered sugar for the final kneading.) Greasing the bowl before melting the marshmallows  releases the sticky mix easily. Using the dough hook I mix the sugar/marshmallow until a dough forms. I then knead the rest of the sugar in by hand until the fondant is no longer sticky. No need to butter your hands!

Tasty and relatively simple (for fondant anyways).  Much better than the Wilton premade fondant.  A few tricks I've learned from trial and error:  First, use a stand mixer if you have one.  Grease the bowl well and put your powdered sugar in it, creating a well in the center.  Pour the marshmallow mixture in the center and use the dough hook to incorporate the two together.  Second, add food coloring to the marshmallow mixture BEFORE adding the powdered sugar.  This will save you a lot of extra kneading!

I have been using this recipe for years with Crisco shortening instead of butter. Using Crisco shortening produces nice white fondant and is more stable at room temperature than butter so you can use it right away. It is as easy to roll out for cakes as real fondant but marshmallow fondant tastes yummy unlike real fondant. If you have any left over, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate. To use again, microwave for a few seconds (5-7) to soften it up again. Knead again with a little Crisco and icing sugar. You can also freeze.

This was my first fondant, so I don't have any frame of reference to other recipes.  I made two batches, one as described, and one in the microwave.  Both came out fine.  I did add a bit of glycerine to one of the batches and it was a little more forgiving.  Great texture, no ripping, and firm enough to resist inadvertant dents.  Made enough to cover and decorate a 9" round cake (one package store bought cake mix).  I didn't know how much I needed, so the double batch left me with enough to do a whole other cake!  Tip:  Give the fondant at least 3 hours on the counter after you refrigerate.  I let my fondant warm to room temperature, and I still had to microwave it to soften it up enough to work with.  Good taste.  Make sure your tools and counter are super clean.  The fondant will pick up any little speck of debris.  Melting the marshmallows in a pot will show you how dirty your cookware really is!

I just made this recipe, with a chocolate twist.  I only needed fondant for a small cake so I halved the recipe - I used 8oz marshmallows and 2 tbps magarine and added 2 (1oz) squares unsweetened bakers chocolate. (no water or vanilla) Melted in microwave and stirred smooth.  Then added 1lb powdered sugar, gradually of course.  I found after the first addition of sugar, mixing/kneading by hand was super easy!  It is smooth and flexible!  Even more, it tastes like a tootise roll!  I added too much sugar at one point so I just kneaded a teaspoon more margarine to the mix!  Perfect!

WOW!  How fab and easy!  I have to confess that I followed the review that used marshmallow 'fluff'- and it was AWESOME! I mixed the "fluff" in my kitchen aid- heavily sprayed with PAM and added in the confectioners sugar until it would hold any more.  Then I turned it out onto my heavily Crisco'd counter top and kneaded the color into it.  What FUN!!!!!  Put it in the fridge overnight and rolled it out the next day.  EASY PEASY!  This was my first attempt at fondant- and it was FUN and easy and tasted good too!  I feel like I may never used buttercream again.....lol!  (I did use a thin layer of buttercream to make the fondant stick to the cake)  SOOOO awesome!

Great recipe!  I've never made fondant before but this couldn't have been easier. I followed the suggestion to use Fluff instead of melting the marshmallows and it was perfect. My hand mixer has dough-kneading attachments and I used those to mix the sugar into the Fluff. The regular egg-beater attachments couldn't handle it, but the dough hooks worked perfectly.  It rolled easily. Seriously, I have never made or used fondant before but I had no problem with this recipe.  It covered my 9" layer cake beautifully and I was able to color (with Wilton gel color) the fondant and cut out shapes to decorate my cake. This is a keeper!

I was really excited to try this recipe since so many people gave it 5 stars....it was a total disaster for me. What a disappointment! Horribly sticky and impossible to work with. It was completely unusable no matter how much I tried to fix it with sugar, cornstarch, and crisco...  :(

Excellent recipe.

Advise for first timers.
GREASE the pan you are melting marshmallows in WELL.
Halve the recipe and make it in two batches. Comes out great. EASIER ON MIXING AND KNEADING.

This was super messy; a lot of my marshmallow mixture stuck to the bowl, not sure if I did something wrong?  But the end result is very nice! I appreciate another reviewer's advice to stir in cocoa powder with the powdered sugar if you're trying to make it red. I used some cocoa powder with liquid red food coloring before stirring in all the powdered sugar, and the result was a nice rich red. Thanks for sharing this!

I tried the KA method with marshmallow cream; not successful.  I used my mixer attachment which just clogged and stopped turning.  I ended up having to remove the "batter" by hand, dump onto a powdered work surface and just work it by hand.  Did you use the dough hook attachment??  I would recommend just using a 13 oz jar of marshmallow fluff and plenty of powdered sugar.  Work it by hand until you get the consistently you're after.

I have been using marshmallow fondant for years and it is hands down so much better than the store bought stuff. Cheaper too!! I like to use my kitchenaid fitted with the dough hook to do the kneading for me.I spray the bowl with pam, dust it with powdered sugar and put about a cup in the bottom then add the marshmallow mixture. While mixing on low speed I add the rest of the sugar and let it do it's thing. It is still sticky and you have to work with it a bit but the end result is worth the effort. It keeps for weeks in the fridge too.

I use this recipe but MINUS the butter. No need for it. You can just use marshmallows, water, sugar and any flavoring you desire. It tastes WAY better than a store bought popular brand that is practically unedible! Mini marshmallows are also not required. I have made it with regular ones and it is just fine, just be sure to use the same oz. size. Also, if you omit the butter, no need for refrigeration. Just melt the mallows with the water until smooth then add the sugar and flvoring and work it A LOT until pliable and not sicky. Then it will store fine in a tupperware, airtight container.

This is just fantastic! Thank you so much for sharing it. I made this yesterday. It was my first attempt at any kind of fondant or cake decorating. VERY easy! Of course, I didn't produce the most beautiful cake but the fondant was smooth and gorgeous! I don't have a good mixer, so I did everything by hand. No problems at all. I messed up a little. I had made a few small batches to color and make into circles for decoration. When I put them on the cake there was powdered sugar on them that I wanted to wipe off, and I quickly found out it's not ok to wet your finger and wipe it off like that. To anyone else that's never used fondant and doesn't really know much about it, DON'T do that!! It makes the fondant all sticky. (Duh!I really wasn't thinking.) Also, don't skip letting it sit in the fridge! I was very impatient and wanted to start playing with it right away. It didn't work out well. It was 100% better after being in the fridge for about 6 hours. This was so much fun to do. I hope that everyone else that sits and watches Food Network cake challenges and wishes they could make a gorgeous cake will try this.

USE CLEAR VANILLA EXTRACT and your fondant will not be ivory in color... it will be white : ) My husband and I have been making cakes for almost 2 years now and have been using a recipe similar to this one. We use Crisco instead of butter. The secret to white fondant is simply changing the vanilla extract... no need for the additional step of adding white coloring later. Most cake supply stores will have it. We have found it in Michael's craft stores in their baking section as well.

This recipe tastes much better than Wiltons and half the price. Shortening can be substituted for the butter. I microwave marshmallows with 2T of water for 30 seconds, stir, and repeat. For a total of 2-2.5 minutes. Pour mixture on a marble slab coated with shortening and then dump the confectioners sugar on top. Coat hands with butter or shortening and work together. Takes about 8 minutes. May need remaining water. Make at least 1 day ahead of time. The little beads of sugar will disolve and make for a smoother final product. If using the next day... just leave out on the counter. If using later, up to 2 weeks, store in fridge. Do not freeze. Bring to room temp and knead to body temp before rolling out. If using an older bag of sugar sift it 1st, this will save you tons of time. I make fondant often so I use a 1:1 ratio of confectioners sugar and cornstarch to keep it from sticking when rolling fondant out. Just put it in a shaker and dust when needed.

THRILLED.  This was my first attempt at fondant and it was so easy!!  I've heard that making fondant is very tricky so I've never attempted it until now.  A perfect recipe,  easy to follow, easy to make.  My first fondant cake actually worked!  My design skills may need some improvement but the fondant turned out great.  I forgot to put the shortening on my hands at first,  BIG MESS.  I definitely advocate the use of shortening. Also,  I didn't refrigerate overnight and it came out fine.  I just rolled the fondant into a 2 inch thick slab, put in the freezer for about 30 min followed by the refrigerator for about an hour.  Afterward I brought it back to just under room temp and rolled it out to about 1/6 inch thick.  It was enough to easily cover a 4 layer 9 inch round with butter cream between the slabs.  I made another half recipe to use for decoration.  Very happy.  I will likely never try another fondant recipe,  no need to mess with perfection.

This stuff is fantastic!  I only had one experience many years ago with fondant (the traditional kind) and it was a disaster!!  Since then, I have stayed as far away from the stuff as I could.  Recently people have been talking on the Buzz about how great marshmallow fondant is, so I decided to give it a try.  I had an order for a cake with Tweety Bird on it, so I used this fondant to make the Tweety out of.  The fondant came together beautifully, colored very nicely, and rolled out incredibly easily.  The only problem I had was that it stuck to the waxed paper I rolled it out on, but I'm sure that's just because I didn't dust the surface with enough powdered sugar before rolling it out.  I was able to flip the shape over and carefully peel the waxed paper off.  I've never been so successful making a character cake without using a shaped pan!  This fondant will have a permanent place in my baking repertoire!

I was a little worried about attempting fondant for the first time but read a lot of the reviews and decided this was the one to try.  I was right!  I was amazed at how easy it really was.  I used the mini marshmallows, popped them in my microwave for 1 minute and stirred.  Then I added clear vanilla and water and put it in my Kitchen Aid mixer using the dough hook.  I added the confectioners suger little by little just as the directions said and that was it!  I never even needed any butter.  I don't think I would have wanted to attempt it without the Kitchen Aid mixer.  I also had a countertop silpat and teflon coated rolling pin.  From what I've read, I'm sure these items made it much easier!   I made a three tier cake and made three batches of fondant.  The white layer was a breeze.  For some reason, the batches that had color, were a little more difficult to work with.  Maybe it was me, but I got though it.  I had a little trouble with sticking and tearing when I tried to lift it up, even with the silpat.  I can't imagine what it would be like without one!  I read it was better to use cornstarch and when I tried that, it worked!  I also had a black layer and didn't like the white sugar or cornstarch showing on it and read to go over it with a little crisco and that worked perfectly!  All in all, it was a success and I had tons of compliments!  Would definately do it again.

This is a great recipe. The only change I did was to use shortening instead of butter. It is very similar to the Wilton's rolled marshmallow fondant recipe. I just prefer to use the shortening to forgo the heavy butter taste. I also used my Kitchenaid mixer to do most of the kneading. I used the mixer for about 80% of the mixing, and when it became dough-like, I took it out and hand kneaded it for a few mintues, before storing. The taste is excellent, and I made my first fondant cake with it, which was a great success. I let the fondant sit for about 4 hours prior to using it and it was very workable. It was however, even better, the next day! The key to the successful fondant is making sure your work surface is well greased!!

DO NOT REFRIGERATE!!! All it does is dry it out. Just let it sit at ROOM TEMP overnight. If your house is hot, like in the summer, you can set it my the AC or with a fan... but the fridge will just make it crack when you work with it. Great otherwise!

I followed this to the letter and it was a mess!  It never got completely smooth.  When I kneaded it it would be almost smooth and then turn very sticky again sticking to the countertop and my hands.  I added more sugar and the same thing would happen.  NOt sure what we did wrong with this but will not be using this again!  Rolled buttercream fondant from this site is better, although that one is quite greasy.  Will keep searching for the perfect fondant recipe!!

This was so easy!  To those who struggled with cracking, I wonder if you overcooked your marshmallows?  Just soften them so they can be stirred smooth, don't wait for them to turn liquidy in the microwave.  I added regular food coloring into the marshmallows as recommended.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer as recommended by other reviewers, but found that the sugar tended to collect in the bottom of the bowl and eventually I just dumped it all onto the counter to finish kneading.  I never thought I could make fondant myself, and I never expected it to be fun.  Saves money over expensive bakery cakes and looks just as lovely and professional.  Definitely give this one a shot.  Thanks!!!!

I made this recipe this weekend.  It was my first attempt at fondant. I decided to try this one since I've read that MMF can be more forgiving.  I had a lot of fun making it and rolling it and playing with it.  My husband even got into the action, but did not seem to relish it as much as I.  When I rolled it out, I was very suprised at how easy it was.  I had purchased a silicon rolling pin, so maybe that was some of it.  I had dusted my counter with cornstarch as well, but I really thought that things would stick more.  But, no worries.  Cutting the shapes was good fun.  I really started flashing back to my childhood, playing with play dough and such.  So, fun recipe.  Now to brass tacks.  Although shows on Food Network make it look easy to cover a cake in fondant, it is NOT easy to smoothly cover a round, barrel shape with a flat piece of frosting.  I tried to burnish it and stretch it and make it pretty and flawless but did not do so perfectly.  I can see that a person needs to practice.  So if you are a beginner, do not expect things to go easily and flawlessly the first time.  Also, if you're going to stick on shapes or other decorations, have your water or butter cream on hand so that you can just reach over and get some "glue" when you need it.  As for taste, this is a SWEET frosting.  1 lb of marshmallows and 2 lbs of sugar pretty much means it's going to be SWEET.  It does however not taste as bland as other fondants I have eaten.  I put in some extra vanilla flavori

Had alot of fun with this recipe. The humidity was very high.  I froze the cake  before i covered it. When i brought it out  and put the fondant on it  everything started sweating from the humidity. I was worried it would melt but in the end the sweating gave the fondant a nice shiny look (looked like i meant to do it) It was SUPER easy to work with. took gel food coloring beautifully. I will use this again many many times!! Thank you

Just so you guys know there is 10 cups on a 16 ounce bag of mini marshmallows, and 7 1/2 cups of powdered sugar in 2 pounds. This is such a great recipe, totally using this for grease themed cupcakes

First time i did this recipe it was very sticky because i had no mixer and was doing it by hand. I thought it was never going to come together but then the impossible happened lol after 15-20 mins of kneading it finally became fondant well marshmallow fondant that is :) The real fondant is one of the most nasty things ive ever ate and ruined whatever dessert i was eating its like pure sugar. Thats why i love this recipe its just the right amount of sweetness and the cost to make it is even sweeter lol :) I loved it and everything about it so simple and easy. I suggest as other did to mix in the color before adding the powdered sugar. When i did it the first time i added color after i made it and that took forever to do! Besides adding the color first makes it come out streak free and equal coloring. I would suggest though to make your color slightly darker then you want it because after all the powdered sugar is added it lightens it up a bit. Just test it out as i did and it cost almost nothing for the ingredients. Also suggest to use clean vanilla extract if you want white as the real vanilla will color the fondant almost an off white. ANYONE AND I MEAN ANYONE CAN DO THIS!!!! Also i use crisco instead of the butter so much better. I will always use the recipe for the rest of my life. Made this 8 times already and counting on many more :) Thanks for this amazing delicious recipe.

This is the first time I ever made fondant as well as worked with it. Most people do not care for fondant. They usually say it looks pretty but doesn't taste good. Well I have to say it was easy to work with and tasted good as well. But I did only use it as decoration on frosting, so there wasn't too much fondant being eaten at one time. It tasted like marshmellow, which everyone like so that definitely was a plus. Now about making it.........I really thought at one point that my hands would be forever webbed together by this sticky mess then all of a sudden it just kind of worked itself into a ball. I was really pleasently surprised how easy it was to work with after it chilled overnight. I definitely reccomend making it. With that said make it a couple of days prior to it being needed - so the mess  and stress level is a minium, which definitely enhances the experience of using the fondant.

I'm not sure why the recipe says to place the dough in the fridge overnight. I put it in the fridge for less than an hour and it worked just fine. I also substituted the butter for Crisco and that made it really easy to work with. Awesome recipe!

Wow.  Super super easy and way fun to play with.  I am notoriously known for making ugly b-day cakes, but this one was beautiful.  I made a double layer 9" round and topped it with plain white fondant, then tinted some of the other fondant different colors and used flower cookie cutters to cut shapes out and decorate the cake.  Just needed to wet the back of the cutouts to have them stick. Note: I'm glad I read somewhere that you still have to frost the cake before covering it with fondant.  This may seem obvious to some people, but it wasn't to me- haha). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I wasn't too crazy about the taste- pure sweetness, but I'm pretty sure that's how all fondant tastes.

I made this to make some pink polka dots on my sister in laws birthday cake! It was delicious! It reminded me of circus peanuts though when I ate it! Next cake I make I am attempting to make a bow since I ran out time for the last cake! I also still have plenty left!

i have been so scared of fondant, and finally worked up the nerve to make it this afternoon- WOW! it was so much easier than i expected! i added wilton gel coloring to the melted marshmallow and water mixture which made it so easy to tint. i added as much sugar as possible with a wooden spoon, then dumped the mass on my sugared countertop, greased my hands with crisco, and kneaded in sugar until the dough was stiff and no longer sticky. the only thing i'll do differenly next time is grase my bowl with crisco before melting the marshmallows- i forgot and its a pain to try to clean!! DONT BE AFRAID OF THIS RECIPE- try it and have fun!!

You can't go wrong with this recipe!  It was the first recipe I tried - and it turned out perfectly!  I made four batches of fondant and made three baby shower cakes.  The taste is delicious - everyone ate it (not one person peeled it off!)  Definitely use crisco on your hands instead of butter.  And recommend coloring the fondant before you put it in the fridge (just easier to work with and knead the color into the dough before it is refrigerated.)  Also, don't be afraid to microwave the fondant when working with it and decorating your cake.  Just a few seconds and fondant that might be starting to harden up becomes soft and pliable again so you can continue to decorate with it.  I have recommended this recipe to others - and they also have had success making it.  Thank you, Kiele Briscoe for posting it!  I was afraid to make fondant - but now I can't wait to do it again since it is so easy and tasty!

Awesome recipe! From the words of so many converts...using this recipe is soooo much better than store bought! It tastes good, and very easy to work with (albiet very messy mixing the powdered sugar in!) I used Crisco in place of the butter as so many others mentioned, also greased the counter and rolling pin with crisco - did not use the powdered sugar or cornstarch, made loads of fondant too! Thanks for the great recipe! It's definitley a keeper!

awesome! I have been dabbling in cake-making for a few years now, just for fun, but I usually use the store-bought, which tastes bland, at best. This recipe is SO easy and SO cheap though, it's just fantastic! I make my own vanilla extract (seriously, so easy and cheap, and makes a great gift!) and I was worried that it would tint the fondant, but it honestly looked just as white as the store-bought, and tasted amazing! I sprayed my bowl with pam before nuking the mallows, and then turned the melted mallows out into my sprayed kitchenaid for all of the mixing (saved my arms!). definitely keep a glob of Crisco and a box of powdered sugar nearby when kneading right before use. I also got a small spray bottle and I put a bit of vodka in it to spray the fondant with after it's on the cake. it absorbs the excess powdered sugar and gives it a clean, even, finished look when the alcohol evaporates.

Make sure you grease (Crisco) the bowl and spatula generously before putting in the marshmallows. Even grease the surface before putting the powdered sugar on it to knead. Grease everything.

Good fondant recipe, however I think there is a typo.  The Kraft Jet-Puffed mini marshmallows came only in the 10.5 oz size at my store.  I used only the 10.5 oz of marshmallows and 3T of water the first time I made this, and pretty close to 2 pounds of confectioners' sugar.  It came out great.

If you use 16 oz of marshmallows as written in the recipe (which is the weight of the large sized marshmallows bag), you will probably need more than 2 pounds of confectioners' sugar.  When I tried it I probably used 3-4 cups more.  It still came together fine, just needed a lot more sugar in the kneading phase when using the full 16 oz of marshmallows as called for (and the full 4T of water).

I also used butter as the recipe states, to avoid trans-fats, and had no problems with it.  I wasn't sure if there would be problems since lots of reviewers mentioned using shortening.

This is my 'go to' recipe for fondant!! Super easy to make in my Kitchen-Aid. I just use the bowl as the top pot for a double-boiler, then transfer it to my machine. I add food coloring while the marshmallows are melting. You MUST use lots of conf sugar when rolling out!! But this is SO much cheaper than store bought, and tastes better than anything around. You'll be a hero if you choose to make this!

Very good recipe. Received a lot of compliments on how *~*DELICIOUS *~* it tastes (if you've tried traditional fondant, you'll know why once you taste this). I only used 2 tbsp of water by error and it still came out great.

I was able to use this the same day without overnight refrigeration. However, it must sit out for at least an hour first to cool completely. 

I was pleased that the fondant was VERY easy to work with. I read on another website (cakecentral.com) that you can add food coloring to the melted marshmallows instead of trying to knead it through. Saved me a bunch of time!

Fantastic!  Never sticky for a second as I did the whole thing in my kitchen aid with the dough hook.  I used crisco instead of butter, and I added in gel food coloring as needed to small batches and it was awesome to work with.  Made yo gabba gabba cupcake toppers which were such a hit!  

I highly recommend keeping some crisco and cornstarch handy when rolling and cutting to keep from stickiness and an x-acto knife which made all the difference in making mini shapes!

I had to review this recipe again!  This fondant is so easy to make (a little messy) but a great and cheaper way to make fondant. I used corn starch to roll out the fondant instead of confectioner's sugar.  It's less sticky.  I also kneeded in a small amount of shortening  to reactivate it when it got a little dry.  You can also make GUM PASTE out of this by adding 1/2 tsp of TYLOSE powder to 1/2 pound of the fondant. (tylose is availabe at cake supply stores) This is great when making decorations such as roses and other flowers.  Love this recipe!!  Great bang for your buck!!

I learned to make MM Fondant recently and love using it. How simple and very inexpensive (as well as delicious). So fun to experiment with as a novice; it makes me want to find excuses to make strangers cakes! lol Just want to say that I could look at all the displays for hours - I saw a lot of really amazing and talent-laden designs. I'm hoping to do my own wedding cake so I'll be practicing. Thanks all for sharing your beautiful and yummy labors of love.

This is the first time I'm writing a review on anything found on AR! Like other users I was nervous about making this. This recipe is amazing! My mom DOES NOT like fondant and I asked her to please try this recipe and she will now allow me to use fondant on the family cakes lol. It's so much cheaper than regular boxed fondant! I used the bowl from my Kitchen Aid as a double boiler instead of microwaving because I wanted to save dishes. I started to melt the marshmallows then mixed in the water and vanilla and kept it over the pot of water until smooth. I then used my dough hook and gradually added all but the last cup of confec sugar. I used Crisco instead of butter and kneaded in the last cup. I have used boxed fondant so many times so I'm used to the feel of fondant and this was the same quality but with better taste. I will never waste money on boxed fondant again!

Great easy recipe.  My only suggestions are to use Crisco instead of butter...that way you don't need to refridgerate your cake, and to buy an extra pound of powdered sugar because two doesn't get the recipe to the correct consistency (it's way too sticky with only 2).  I end up using about 2.5 lbs.

This is such a simple recipe and absolutely terrific! I made some of the same changes as everyone else; used crisco and didn't bother with the vanilla - oh my! I've never worked with fondant before this and now that I've found this recipe which is super economical and devine as far as taste goes, I'll be using it from now on! Everyone raved about the taste and the look, and it was so easy to work with. I highly, highly recommend this recipe to anyone who is wanting to get into working with fondant but has been intimidated by it until now. Try this! You will love it!

this was my first crack at a fondant cake and i must say it turned out beautiful and tasted good. i made this cake in memory of my father who passed away this past march..he loved butterflies and daisies and that was my theme i used pastel colors(yellow,pink,blue)im still learning the art of the ribbons and bows.the fondant was extremely sticky but after awhile i was able to get it pliable..i think the next time i make this ill use my stand mixer and lightly grease the bowl and kneading surface and see if that makes it any easier.definetly will make again.thanks for the recipe :)

I followed the directions and used my stand mixer to do the kneading.  For whatever reason, I couldn't get this recipe to work and ended up having to throw out the entire batch.

I used this recipe to make a cake for a birthday party. Having never used fondant of any kind before (I was always afraid of it!) I was very happy with my results!  It is super simple to make and easy to work with.  Two things I would change about the recipe though.  One, it is very helpful if you grease all of your bowls/beaters with shortening before making this.  The bowl you melt the marshmallows in and the mixing bowl and beater.  It will make clean up way easier.  Also, if your frugal like me, you may not want to soften quite so much butter.  I found that I only really needed maybe a shy half of the 1/4 called for.  Butter is pretty expensive and I had all that butter sitting in the bowl that I was unable to use for anything else (since my fingers had been all in it.) These are very minor things though, so the recipe still gets five stars from me!

Maybe it is because I have an ancient sunbeam mixer but this just did not mix well and was a mess.  My mixer could not mix it. Should have tried some of suggestions but doubt it would have helped. We also weren't to crazy about the taste once we did get it mixed up.

This was my very first time at making and working with fondant, except for the time I tried the "buttercream fondant" recipe from this site (which was a huge disapointment). I followed chef4six's advice and used fluff marshmallow instead of melting my own. I mixed everything in my food processor with the regular blade attachment(make sure to butter the blade and bowl well). Made only half a batch, because I did not have enough icing sugar. I also eyeballed the sugar, because I wasn't sure how much a pound would be. It was awesome, easy and absolutely delicious!!! My mom who doesn't even like fondant, thought this one was delicious! I put it over the strawberry cake from scratch from this site, over a thin layer of buttercream icing. I ran out of icing sugar to roll it out with and smooth it, so I rolled it between two sheets of plastic wrap. Perfect!! Thanks sooo mcuh for this awesome and perfect and most delicious recipe for fondant!!

This is an old family recipe, and always works well. A few changes: don't use a mixer!! Mix is by hand all the way. Many of you are complaining about it gumming up your mixer, so just don't use it! When mixing, use shortening instead of butter to coat your hands. Way cheaper, and it won't make your fondant taste like butter.  1/4 of a cup of water is way too much. It would probably make it way too sticky, and if you add more powdered sugar to make it not sticky, then it will be way too stiff. Just use one tablespoon, then, if your fondant is too dry, add shortening. This way, you can get the desired consistency and it will still be workable. Stir the marshmallow every 15 seconds so they melt evenly. The vanilla is optional, plain fondant is still quite good. Or, you can use other flavors. 
 One tip that has nothing to do with the recipe: MAKE SURE you are using a full 16 oz package of marshmallows. A lot of the bags are only 10 oz. and if you use one of those, you end up with way to much powdered sugar, and it's a big mess. Trust me on this one.

I was beginning to think this stuff would never form a ball. I bought a 2kg bag. I had to use the entire thing! I also used 1 tablespoon of margarine instead of butter. If  I would have used 1/4 cup of margarine, I would have needed a lot more confectioner's sugar.
If you plan on using liquid food coloring, be prepared for the fondant to be super sticky again, and need 1-2 cups more of confectioner's sugar. Unfortunately I used all of my confectioner's sugar, and had to use cornstarch. It didn't change the flavor, and worked great.
This recipe made way too much for a one layer 9" cake. I'll be putting the leftovers in the freezer and hoping it'll last until Mother's Day.

I love this recipe!  Since I am a firm believer in "work smarter, not harder" I made this completely with my KitchenAid.  I added only 3 tablespoons of water directly to the marshmallows before microwaving to melt.  Then I poured EVERYTHING in the KitchenAid and let it run until my fondant was ready!  I was able to use it right out of the bowl.  I highly recommend rolling it out on parchment paper...no mess, no stick!

This was really easy to make and tastes delicious. I didn't find it particularly sticky, but then again I have a 5 year old. I added 1 tsp of clear butter flavoring and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. I also used Crisco instead of butter. I added coloring before I added the powdered sugar. I also added Wilton's white-white coloring to one batch to get an actual white. It worked well. This is a great recipe. I'll never buy premade fondant!

I have been decorating cakes for 10 years now and always bought the wilton boxed fondant cause I never tried to make my own. So glad I finally tried it and only regret not doing it 10 years ago! I made this twice in the last 2 weeks. First time I could have used it right after making it cause when I made it I didn't notice that the bags of mini marshmallows I used were 10.5oz but looked great and tasted fine. The second time I used it I used the right amount and I noticed it was to soft to use and had to be chilled, just like the recipe said. This was super easy to make and I will never buy it again. Talk about a money saver. It is also so much easier to add color to than the hard boxed kind. I don't really like the taste of fondant I just like it for covering cakes and decorating but I always put a layer of buttercream underneath the fondant. Thanks for the awesome fondant recipe I will never buy fondant again!   Also if you have problems with it sticking put shortening on your hands and keep using powder sugar on the table when you roll it. I also didnt use butter I only used shortening and didn't use all of it. I roll my fondant on plastic drop cloth sprinkled with powder sugar on both sides and I dust off accessive sugar with a brush. You can also use shortening to help it not to stick and to give it a shine. Wet the drop cloth bottom to the counter to stop it from sliding when you try to roll the fondant. 4 Stars cause I think shortening is better than butter for fondant

My cousin and I are avid bakers.  We made 4 batches of this fondant to cover my son's 3-tier 1st birthday cake.  We followed all the instructions and refrigerated as directed, and this was nothing short of a complete mess.  Not ONE of the batches turned out easy to work with, we needed to make continual repairs to our cake, and work very quickly because this fondant hardened up fast.  Needless to say, I will NOT be using this recipe again.

Who knew it was this easy and tasty to make my own fondant!  I used almond extract instead of vanilla extract since that one I had was clear and I was afraid of it not being as white as possible.  Also, I used my kitchen aid mixer to knead the melted marshmallows with the first 5-6 cups of powdered sugar.  Then, I finished it off by kneading it on my roll/cut mat by hand.  (so much easier this way!)  I buttered everything beforehand that came in contact with the melted marshmallow mixture (ie. bowls, spatula, hands, KA attachment, surface) which saved the day.

This was tasty, but please use a Kitehen Aid or Cuisinart Stand Mixer - my poor little handheld couldn't handle the dough - and it's HARD WORK mixing by hand. I'll use this again when I need fondant, but hopefully I'll have a better mixer next time. :)

Perfection! This was my first time working with fondant and it went very smoothly. The only tricky part I encountered was when I was rolling the fondant out, it would stick in places on the counter although it was very powdered, so it took me a couple of tries, but is no big deal! Thanks!

This was so easy!  I tasted it as I was making it and it tastes pretty good!  Needed to divide it for different colors and it takes the colors very well.  I did use Crisco instead of butter and as long as you keep your hands greased, it handles very nicely.  Thanks!

A keeper! This is the first time I have made and worked with fondant. Using the tips by some of the top reviewers, I managed a pretty cake for my daughter's birthday. The tips from other reviewers that helped: 
1. I used my big Kitchen Aid mixer with dough hook and greased the bowl. I think a smaller mixer might not have been able to handle the load. Definitely use the dough hook attachment.
2. I added the food color to the marshmallow mixture before adding the sugar. 
3. I used clear vanilla flavoring to avoid color issues because I was going for a light aqua blue color. 
4. I used Crisco instead of butter. 

I did have a little trouble with stickiness and had to roll it out a couple of times to get it smooth, adding more powdered sugar each time. Transferring the fondant to the cake itself was a little tricky, but there are YouTube videos that can help. Given the nature of the ingredients, it was way too sweet for me, but the kids loved it. Also, I put a thin layer of frosting on the cake and chilled it prior to placing the fondant to help the fondant stick to the cake. If you get air bubbles in the fondant, use the tip of a sharp knife to break them and smooth down. I think a fondant roller would have been helpful, but a frosting spatula worked okay for me. I will be using this same recipe for my older daughter's birthday next week. Thank you for submitting this recipe!

I am bad.  There I said it.  But I NEVER review anything!  BUT, I just made this for the first time, and it was the easiest thing I've probably attempted.  I used a 10oz bag of marshmallows, and just halved the water and vanilla.  added powdered sugar until it didnt need it anymore, and greased my hands and countertop with shortening.  It probably took 10 min!  Can't wait to roll it out and cut out cute shapes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

"Sticky" would be the understatement of the year!  We finally got it to work using cornstarch and working with it for short time periods (putting it back in the freezer between bouts).  I was very impressed by the taste as I actually enjoyed it unlike professional cake fondant. I would be curious to try other flavors of extract to match the cake flavor.

I have used this recipe recently on several hello kitty face cakes, for friends.   It is always met with "oohs and ahhs" for presentation, and the taste is DEFINITELY better than some store-bought icing or fondant.  I brought one to work and was immediately propositioned to make more.  It's really kind of fun to make too, but I think it would be a disaster with small children.  I made a chocolate version by using some cocoa instead of entirely powdered sugar, and it was pretty good as well.  I should add that I made this in TX, in the middle of the summer, with no problems.  You definitely have to refridgerate it for at LEAST a few hours before using, and then let it thaw to slightly cooler than room temperature.

Just made this for the first time and although it was a lot of work, it came out great. My one suggestion would be to have an extra box of sugar on hand. I had to add more sugar to get it to come together.

Maybe it was me...but I had a really hard time with this fondant.  I've used the store bought one but found it didn't taste that good.  This one tastes okay but it was a pain to work with.  It kept sticking to my mat, cracked, broke and was generally very hard to work with.  I discovered that it worked okay when I kept adding water to make the fondant really soft and then used HUGE amounts of cornstarch to keep it from sticking to the mat and rolling pin.   I won't be making this again.  I think I'll stick to the store bought stuff and use flavouring.

I made this on a humid weekend in July (New Brunswick). I let it sit in the fridge overnight, and used it the next day. 
My cake did sweat a bit because of the humidity, but all in all it worked.

My go-to recipe for tiered cakes.  So simple, very delicious.  It can get dried out, but i think that has more to do with my lack of experience, and not the fondant itself.  A steady constant I'm glad I've added to my arsenal.

This is terrific-I've made it several times and it's the only fondant I use.  I think those having trouble with stickiness could cut back on the water a little (humidity, maybe?).  It's pretty tasty, for fondant, and really easy to work with.  If you don't like the flavor, try adding more vanilla or almond flavoring.  The butter isn't really necessary once you have enough powdered sugar worked in, but it adds a nice shine.  You can add the coloring in with the water or later.  One of my favorite cakes was an "ocean" cake, so adding color later and not working it in completely gave it a nice swirl effect.

This is AMAZING STUFF. I have dreaded the word Fondant when a customer requested it. Now I can't get enough of this stuff. USE YOUR KA MIXER. it makes things sooooo much easier. You can add color and knead it a little at the end to get the consistancy you want. A WINNER TO KEEP!!!!

I have never made fondant before (or wrote a review on a recipe) and I didn't have a problem with this recipe at all.  I made it exactly as written and it turned out beautifully!  It rolled out perfect and I am making some more tonight.  I can't wait to cover my cake with this fondant.  And it tastes good too.  Not sure how regular fondant tastes, but this one is very good.  Even the kids liked it!

Oh my gosh!  This a a fantastic & easy recipe. I was hesitant - and read over all the hints, etc., as it was my first time using fondant.  But, it was so easy (if you have a KitchenAid mixer).  I needed 4 colors for the Toy Story Cake I was making.   So made 4 batches.  Only used half of the water called for in the recipe.   Dumped the hot melted marshmallows into the well-greased KA and gradually added SIFTED powered sugar (with the dough hook) till it turned into a big lump.  (It didn't require the full amount of sugar called for in the recipe).   THen greased my hands and counter and kneeded in more sugar as needed till it didn't stick.   It felt like playdoh. Refrigerated it overnight (but, honestly, don't think I had to).   Next day, let come to room temp., but "softened" some in microwave as I was in a hurry.  Watch carefully -- about 10-20 sec. on very low power.   Then it was perfect to roll out.   Greased my hands and counter (did not need more sugar to roll out) and it rolled beautifully!   Tastes good too!    It has given me inspiration to make lots more cakes with fondant!

This was so easy to make. I don't have a mixer so I had to use my hands and it still came out great! I've made the buttercream fondant recipe on here, and now this one. This holds up fantastic by comparison. It was much easier to work with and it still tasted great. This one is a keeper!

This was my first time making fondant.  Im practicing to possibly  make my daugther in laws baby shower cake in Dec.  This was very hard to work with. It was very sticky and messy. It kept sticking to my hands and my Wilton work mat even though I  greased my hands and the work surface.   I added all 2 lbs of sugar but still needed more.  The taste was ok but I still prefer using just the traditional butter cream icing. I will either hire a bakery to make my design for the cake or just use butter cream icing.  Won't use this again. It isnt worth the effort.

This is my first time with fondant, I wanted to try something simple to use over a rum cake (boyfriend's choice, we'll see how those flavors mix!).  While this was indeed sticky, I found that if I kept my hands greased with crisco it was easy enough.  I do think that I over-did the powdered sugar, when I would try to pull apart the fondant it would tear instead of remain intact....I just added a bit of water and problem solved!  I do have a non-stick rolling pin, which will probably be a life saver when I take it out of the fridge later tonight to roll it out.  Oh - and when you add color....use the professional gel colors if you want bright colors - I'm stuck on an island with no options other than traditional food coloring drops and can't get a nice red (it's more like magenta).....will make for an interesting Little Mermaid  :)

Perfect recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  It rolled out great, no tearing or anything.  My first time with fondant, and now I swear I'm going to open a bakery.  Thanks for the recipe Kiele!!!  Check my picture.

First time out the gate making fondant of any kind. I used the kitchen aid mixer for all but the last cup of powdered sugar, kneaded the rest and it worked perfect. I made it the day I used it and chilled in in the freezer for a couple hours and had no issues working with it after that. The kids loved the flavor and my wife is impressed with the cake I made.

This recipe was really easy.  My first time making fondant and it came out perfectly.  I did cut down the amount of sugar and I didn't refrigerate the icing either.  I'll definitely make this recipe again.

when they suggest using butter/crisco to coat your hands when kneading, do not simply coat. saturate them, use as much as possible or you'll get it all over your hands -- it it's very hard to get off. that was the worst part. rolling it was work but not impossible. in the end it turned out looking very nice, but not as nice a regular fondant. it tasted mostly like marshmallows; i would definitely try using other extracts other than vanilla to enhance the flavor

An absolutely fabulous recipe! I was scared to try fondant for the longest time...not only because it looked so difficult, but also because I'd heard that fondant tasted gross. Well...this recipe proved both of those points to be incorrect! Not only is this astonishingly easy to make and use, it really tastes good! My siblings kept begging me for samples while I was using it, and on the cake, (as long as it was thin enough) this fondant tasted quite good. I've used it twice so far...once for a small test cake, and the second time, to make a graduation hat for a cake I made for my cousin. Both times, it worked fabulously well. As another user suggested, it is best to put the food coloring in before the powdered sugar...I had to dye this black for the graduation hat, and it was a lot less messy and time consuming to do it this way. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...I'll be using it often!!!

I made this last night to cover a friend's bridal shower cake and it's wonderful. I have made MANY fondant recipes but this one is the easiest to make, the easiest to work with, and the tastiest. I made a three-tiered cake in shades of peach - the middle tier is a combination of the shades blended together. It's gorgeous! This is my new go-to fondant recipe. Thanks for posting it.

FANTASTIC recipe for fondant!!  I was very tired of paying so much for the store bought variety and this worked even better.  One thing that I noted (and it was such a small thing) when I stirred the fondant in a large deep bowl, it was a total mess.  When I stirred it in a casserole dish it seemed much easier to work with.  I guess because the powdered sugar had more surface area to sink into before mixing?  Don't know but it was a HUGE difference is ease of prep.  Thank you for posting!

Fantastic! My first attempt at fondant, and this was so easy. I used butter when kneading and also little more later when I added color. The consistency is so smooth and it tastes pretty good too! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Great recipe, worked like a charm!  Kneading in a little butter with the color makes it easy to add it after refrigerating and bringing back to room temp.  I rolled it out on top of buttered wax paper, inverted over the cake, and peeled off the paper, very easy!  Will def make again, my daughter was thrilled with her birthday cake :)

OMG...This recipe was very intimidating but I concured it. It took 2 times but the second time I didnot keep it in the fridge for 8 hours but only 4 it was more workable. My concerned was when to add color the it. so I added it when I was kneading it with a thicker consitancy. I will definatley used this recipe again for birthday cakes for my kids. I doubled on the water and buttered the bowl when I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. It was fun but you really had to work with it. Good stress releaser... Thanks for the recipe. Have fun.

Great!!! I make this in my Kitchen Aid mixer and come out great and because of that I don't have to use the extra butter for kneading. Tremendo!!!! puse todos los ingredientes en mi batidora Kitchen Aid y salio muy bien no tuve que amasarla a mano, por eso tal vez no tuve que usar la mantequilla extra para amasarla.

Another user suggested using marshmallow fluff instead and that is just what I did!!!  It was SO easy!  We used it for a wedding cake and it turned out beautiful!  It honestly took about five minutes a batch and i had to make six batches (for a three tier wedding cake).  I will never make fondant another way!

This is very tasty. I always without fail peel fondant off of cakes. But not this one!! I messed up BIG time by not spraying my beaters and I paid the price (a burnt out mixer), LOL. Thankfully I didn't burn out my stand mixer. Now I know what to do differently next time and I know it will be easier. Make sure you read the comments before trying this recipe, but definitely try this recipe:-) Also, I noticed that Crisco worked better than butter for the stickiness. Thank you so much for a fondant that I enjoy (and is inexpensive, too!). I am gonna WOW my family for my kids' birthday this weekend.

This was the first time I had ever used fondant before and I have to say that it was over a good experience.  I thought that it would never get out of the "sticky" stage, but right when I thought I was just going to give up, that I must have done something wrong, everything started to pull together and I ended up with good results :)

This was so easy! I loved how well it worked for my project.I made several batches before I perfected the art of making it. I did learn that you have to sir it by hand and it was much easier to add small amounts of the sugar to the marshmallows in a bowl with sides that were lightly buttered so the dough would not stick to the sides as I worked with it. Its definitely a great workout for those arms! :)

I have been making this for a couple of years, but I have never used crisco or butter. I turn the marshmallows in a little water before microwaving, stir in as much powdered sugar as possible.  If you put it on the counter to knead it put powdered sugar on top and bottom so it doesn't stick to your hands.  Also I bought some plastic off the roll in the fabric department. (like you would use to upolstered dining chairs) To cover a cake you can roll out on plastic and it is easy to invert it over the cake and peel off. (Put sugar or cornstarch on plastic before rolling)

This was my first time working with fondant. It really was a lot of fun!  This stuff tastes like exactly what you would think it would. Imagine mixing melted marshmallows with a ton of sugar.  It is EXTREMELY sweet.  But it looks beautiful and compared to the fondant I have had this definetly has the best taste.

So much fun!  I used gel food coloring - green and purple.  Avoid the liquid food coloring unless you must - it makes the fondant sticky and harder to work with. If you want to create letters, it is very easy cut if you use a non-serrated knife. I kept it in the fridge and then let it come to room temp to use.

WOW! I have been scared to try fondant but I finally overcame my fear...and this is the recipe to use! I stuck the dough hook on my Kitchenaid and let it do all the work, no mess! I never needed the butter and it was smooth and lovely! I won't be ableto taste it for a few days but that's okay, it is has already earned staying power in my recipe file.

It actually worked!  My sister and I made a cake for our neices wedding shower and came across this recipe for marshmallow fondant.  We followed the recipe and it turned out great.  It was easy to work with and tasted good on the cake.  The taste seemed very "marshmallowy" to me at first, but once on the cake it was fine.  We did make sure to roll the fondant thin about 1/8-1/4" thick.  I will definately use this again.

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!!!! So much easier than traditional fondant and quite a bit less expensive! I made 3 batches. The first 2 I did by hand & it was kinda messy of course. Then I read the reviews & greased my kitchen aid w/ criso & used the dough hook. 2 bowls of dishes no mess at all I added all the sugar in the mixture instead of kneading a cup in by hand, the mixer can handle it. I sprayed my fondant mat w/ pam when I rolled out, it was just perfect, no problem tranferring it to the cake. It did bubble a bit on the cake in the back but it was a humid warm day & we didnt have AC on yet. For my cake decorations I made a batch w/ a bit more sugar & less marshmallow so it would be stiffer. Worked like a charm. Play with your extracts!!! I did 3 tsps lemon into one 2 tsps raspberry into anoter and 3 tsp orange extract into the 3rd. This is one fondant that you can actually eat, though I must say my kids love it way more than the adults who (unlike kids) dont think marshmallows are the best thing since sliced bread.

This is such a great fondant recipe. I also use vegetable shortening instead of the butter. Its great because it can be made a couple days ahead of time and kept sealed in the fridge. I like to put the melted marshmallow in my greased stand mixer bowl, add about half the powdered sugar and blend. Then add the rest of the butter/crisco and powdered sugar a little at a time. Easier on the arms and less mess.

This was fun to work with. Great for topping cupcakes and sculpting (so long as the figures are flat or small - large pieces will start sagging a bit).

Fantastic!!!! I mixed this all up in my kitchen aid w/ excellent results and less mess! I made this a few days before and refrigerated it until I was ready to use it, just bring it to room temp first. I used this to cover cookies and it really worked well...This recipe a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is what happened to me, my first time ever with fondant. I am no expert but I thought that I would give it a try for a baby shower cake.  Microwaving the marshmallows did not work.  I followed the instructions but the marshmallows would not melt; they would puff up in the bowl then deflate. I have a standard over the oven microwave.  I would zap them 30 seconds, stir, zap them some more. They would not melt, instead they started turning brown.  So I threw them out and started over. I melted them in a large pot on low heat; they melted beautifully.  I put the 2 lbs. of powdered sugar into my Kitchenaid with a dough hook. I poured the melted marshmallow mixture over the sugar then turned the mixer on low.  It didn't take long to make a nice paste. I then kneaded the dough by hand and followed Wilton's direction on adding colors with a toothpick.  I needed to make about 5 different shapes, so I would use a little dough, add a little color. I was not impressed with Wilton's colors. No matter how little or how much more I added, it never gave the color that I wanted; it looked nothing like the colors on their box. I would also like to say that if you are using the whole bowl of fondant to cover a cake, it would probably be easier to add the color in the mixer with the hot melted marshmallow & sugar so the color is fully mixed in. It is difficult to knead in color in a large batch of fondant by hand to get the designed color all through.  The fondant does taste great, however.

I just made my first cake using fondant for my daughter's graduation party, and this recipe worked like a dream. I was very nervous to attempt something that has a reputation for being difficult, but the results were amazing! I made the fondant a couple of days ahead and kept it in the fridge. It was quite sticky when I first started to knead it and stuck to the work surface a few times before I figured out a good trick. I greased up my counter with butter, smoothed down a sheet of parchment (which also helped me to judge the correct size for my 9x13 cake) and then I greased the parchment on top, and dusted powdered sugar on it. I rolled out the fondant, and then rolled it all up on my rolling pin (parchment and all) to transfer it to the cake. It turned out great! No tears, no wrinkles...perfection! I got SO many compliments on the appearance and the taste! I'll be using this again!

This was my second recipe to try making, and it worked perfectly!  It even mixed the color in very easily, even if you don't do it at the liquid stage.  Thanks so much!! It was very tasty; I will probably always use this recipe.

This fondant is great tasting and easy to make! Store bought fondant usually tastes terrible but I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. Just a warning, it was messy rolling it out and adding the extra powdered sugar. I had powdered sugar everywhere! In the end, it made a beautifully decorated cake. I'm using this recipe again!

This fondant was absolutely delicious! I had never made fondant before and was initially concerned by how sticky this was. After it completely cooled, it was much easier to work with and was just like a dough. I am very new to cake decorating and am playing around with different recipes, but this will be my go to fondant. I will use this as the base for chocolate fondant as well.

It almost works!  I ended up needing more than the 2 pounds of powdered sugar and the kneading process was much more time consuming than 5-10 minutes.  Although I do not think I will make this recipe again, for others that may wish to try it, I suggest reserving at least 3 or 4 cups of powdered sugar for the kneading process in addition to the 2 pounds that are already used in the recipe.  I prefer the taste of regular frosting, but the fondant is cute for a special event.  Clean up is quite easy if you just boil water and pour it over the sticky spots!

I was a little scared to try this but I read a few reviews, both good and bad, and watched the video and IT TURNED OUT PERFECTLY! I never used a mixer due to some comments about people ruining theirs.  Little elbow grease and it mixed up just fine! My 14 year old daughter makes cakes and she easily managed it.  Not only was it not sticky when done, it was soft, pliable and rolled out beautifully for her and it was the best tasting fondant we've ever had --our 14 guests agreed too! It tastes like marshmallows! It stored in the fridge nicely wrapped in saran and in a ziploc for several weeks.  She was again able to easily manipulate it and it still tasted delicious!  UPDATE: As a side note, we have now made this over 30 times and this recipe works everytime...Please do note that different brands of marshmallows result in a slightly different sheen/texture, but all are still wonderful! If it's sticky just add more powdered sugar! If it gets dry, we add a small bit of water.  Works everytime.

So simple and definitely tastes better than what you can buy in the store.  Super easy to make-I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought about using the marshmallow fluff, the mini marshmallows are cheaper, and I couldn't find a 16 oz. jar of fluff, either.  Used my heavy duty stand mixer with the dough hook, as others suggested, and it wasn't very messy.

I just made my first cake, butter cream and fondant from scratch. I have been skeptical of making a good fondant as I have not enjoyed it from when others make it. Today is my daughters 5th Birthday and I've got to say the fondant (along with the cake) was great. I can't wait to make another cake. The kids at her preschool wanted seconds and this recipe was easy to follow. I have to admit I'm not much of a baker but this fondant turned out great and easy to work with.

AWESOME! I use this all the time! It can be tough to work with just like any fondant. I find microwaving it just a little when it gets tough helps alot! Just be careful not to Mic for so long that it melts. Also I always roll it onto parchment paper as it is very sticky and hard to pull off a countertop. The taste is pretty good. I get mixed reviews. I have also added in a jell-o mix before to turn it pink. It was strawberry flavored and tasted like a candy easter egg. :0)

This is fun to make, but you have to grease the bowl before you melt the marshmallows and grease your hands and counter surface before you begin to work with it.  That makes the whole process much less of a headache.  The kids were jealous because they thought I was playing with playdough!

This recipe worked very well and tasted good too! It took a little practice to get it down just right, but when we did it worked very well. Make sure that you let it set for at least the 8 hours as stated. That is very important. If you cut the time short it will be too sticky to work with.

I chose to make small portions per Littldot's instructions (2 cups marshmallows, 2.5tsp water, 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1.5 cups of icing sugar for each batch adding vegetable shortening on fingers when needed), and it worked perfectly. My first small batch was kneaded in about 10 minutes to get the right consistency! I did add coloring after AND it was a pain - Mix at the beginning!! This was my first time making fondant, and it was very easy, really! It has a great taste, and that is rarely the case with fondant! Try it in small portions if you are skeptical, it will change your mind!

I've never made fondant before, but decided to try this based on reviews.  It turned out great! I made a double recipe because I needed not only to cover a round 4 layer cake, but I needed enough for decorations too.  I ended up with plenty, and some left over.  I made a few changes to the recipe because I was rushed for time: I stuck two large containers of marshmallow fluff in the freezer for about a half hour and then used them instead.  I didn't use any water, but I did add the vanilla to the fluff.  I then added powdered sugar about one cup at a time.  Here's where I had problems:  I dont have a stand mixer, so I tried mixing it with a hand mixer, and it failed miserably, wrapping the dough all up around to the top of the beaters. IT WON'T WORK,  SO SAVE THE TIME AND DON'T TRY IT!  I had to mix this by hand.  Using a spoon wasn't working, so I tried using my hands.  That was even worse. My husband had to scrape all the sticky fluff off me.  Finally I just covered a wooden spoon in butter and stirred it. Much better! It was hard work though, and took forever! This recipe calls for 2 lbs of powdered sugar, but even doubling the recipe I DIDN'T double the sugar and it turned out fine and was plenty sweet!  After making it I wrapped it and stuck it in the freezer for a half hour, and then took it out and let it set for another half hour.  Kneading took about 15 minutes.  Don't roll it too thin, and make sure to chill immediately.  My cake fell apart because I didn't do that!

Pro-tip, use a croc pot of you don't want to microwave or double broil. I simply put the marshmallows in on high, added the water, then let hit melt slowly. Once it started getting to the point were it was about half way there I dropped it to low and stirred every couple of minutes. Add food coloring while it is melted, makes it much cleaner.

Once it was melted, before adding the sugar, I removed the inner dish from the croc pot so it could cool while I worked in the powdered sugar.

Phenomenal!! I too, used my Kitchen Aid with dough hook. I used Crisco to grease bowl and hook, just sat my mixing bowl on top of 5 Q pot with boing water for 5 min or so, then put it straight on the mixing stand. Easy and delicious.

Looks awesome.  I was wondering, can you make this and shape in advance.  I need to shape the fondant like swiss cheese.  Will they stay a few days in advance in an air tight container?

Such an easy and wonderful recipe! I couldn't find marshmallows OR sugar in a the sizes stated for this recipe. so i used 2 small bags of mini marshmallows they had at the grocery store, and a 1kg bag of icing sugar. The proportions worked out to be essentially what the recipe called for, however the fondant was still sticky after using up all the sugar. I had to run back to the store, and ended up adding nearly another cup of sugar until it reached the proper consistency. It was worth the trip, though! This fondant was so easy and delicious. This makes enough to cover at least 2 large cakes, but fondant keeps in the refrigerator for a really long time, so I'll have to bake another cake to use it on. Great recipe, thanks!

Really easy and delicious! I used this recipe for a wedding cake. I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy and tasted really yummy (I hate the taste of store bought fondant). 

However, It wasn't as smooth and pretty as store bought fondant. It had some texture to it that I couldn't get rid of. The vanilla makes it off white, so I added a few drops of Wilton's pure white frosting coloring and it whitened it right up. Also, it dries out eventually, so I learned to wrap it up tightly and use it within a couple of days. Don't freeze it!

beautiful recipe!!! I used marshmallow fluff...I have to say...for those of you who find it to be too greasy...why in the world are you using crisco on your hands?  USE CORNSTARCH!!!! Its the most amazing cake decorating gift!  Use it to roll out the fondant and keep it from sticking...It doesn't change the taste, and its like miracle powder! Loved this recipe!

This was my first time making and using fondant, and it couldn't have been easier! I used the KitchenAide mixer, so no kneading was required, as well as using Crisco for your work surface and hands. Makes clean up a breeze! As long as you use clear vanilla, it stays mostly white, I didn't need the coloring like some suggested. The color gel works great in the mixer, no mess. I wrapped each in plastic wrap until ready to use. Thanks to all the comments here I was able to make my daughters 7th birthday cake aw-worthy.

I used this recipe twice. Once for a cake for my sister, where we used marshmallow fluff, and once for a cake dummy for my son who can't eat cake, just for something to stick candles into. When we used the marshmallow fluff, it took *FOREVER* to knead all the powdered sugar in and my arms, wrists and fingers were so swollen and achey the next day I almost didn't want to touch this recipe ever again. Following the recipe and using just enough powdered sugar to get the desired smoothness made this the easiest and prettiest fondant I've seen. And I am by no means a professional cake decorator. I plan to use this recipe again and again. Thank you so much!

This was my first try ever making fondant. While the flavor was MUCH better than other fondants I've tried in the past, it was super dry when I took it out of the fridge the next morning. This could *absolutely* be due to my lack of experience in making this, but I read and re-read the directions and followed them to a "t".. so not sure what I did wrong. I'm going to try it again soon, hopefully this time it will turn out better.

Very sticky at first but becomes an easy to use fondant. I highly recommend using a durable mixer.  It really makes the job easy.  Excellent recipe!!! :)

great fondant - looks amazing and actually tastes pretty good.  A word of warning - I burned out 2 hand mixers making this. Use a stand-mixer w/ dough hook if you have one, if not be careful w/ your hand mixer and start kneading by hand as soon as starts to get thick.

Loved this--very easy.

Chocolate:  After realizing how easy this was, I modified it --replace one cup of powdered sugar with cocoa, then added only enough powdered sugar to make it work, and used this for a cake filling.  I received rave reviews on it!

I have always bought fondant because I thought it was too hard to make and wouldn't roll well. I will never buy it again. This was so easy to make, It rolled just like the store bought kind and tasted much better.

This was my first try at fondant and it worked great. Instead of vanilla extract I added coconut extract, so it tasted really yummy. My daughters car cake looks really good. I will use this recipe again.

I make this constantly!  Much better than the traditional stuff, in consistency and flavor!  Make sure to color when you're melting the marshmallows.  It's so much harder to work in the color later.

I can't believe how easy and tasty this is!  I didn't have time to refrigerate it overnight, only about 4 hours but it was fine.  I had to add the colors to the fondant after it had been in the frig.  I just popped the fondant in the microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it up then kneaded in the gel food coloring.  My 8 year old daughter was able to easily knead the color in by hand.  I also used my KA for part of it and it was super easy!

I did not realize my fondant was too dry until I tried to put it on the cake and it cracked. Next time I will try to keep it more moist. Cornstarch worked very well for dusting and rolling out to keep it from sticking.

This is a great Fondant recipe and is much easier and easier on the wallet than the recipe that requires glucose and glycerin. I did use shortening instead of butter to keep it dairy-free. When working with the Fondant be sure that your hands and work surfaces are super clean- the Fondant picks up every speck and will end up looking dirty if you're not careful. Also, the Fondant is very tricky to work with on a hot  and humid day, even with the air conditioning running!

I'm reluctantly giving this recipe 5 stars as I didn't find it as easy as others made it out be.

I don't think I came anywhere close to using 2 pounds of confectioners sugar, had to keep adding water until I got the right consistency/texture.  

Instead of using butter or shortening, I sprayed my beater and hands with PAM....worked for me.

I will definitely make again, should the opportunity present itself again.

Grown up playdoh, I love it!!  I have never even eaten fondant before, but wanted to use it for my son's birthday cake this weekend.  I figured that homemade had to be better than boxed, so I looked for this recipe. I made a test batch the other day so I could see what it tasted like, and while I think it's too sweet (I don't really like sweets), my husband thought it was pretty good.  It's easy to work with, super easy to put together, and works great!  Thank you for this recipe!

I love this recipe! It is delicious and perfect for my cakes! I made it the first time and forgot the butter and I am glad I did. I have made it a couple more times without the butter and I don't think it needs butter. After letting it come to room temperature I cut off what I need from it and put the rest back in a plastic bag. I spray my rolling mat and pin with cooking spray and that helps it from not sticking. If the piece you are working with starts to get dry, just add a tiny bit of water and work it in and it's back to normal. I love love love this recipe and get lots of comments from it. Thanks for sharing. Try it without butter, it works great!

I was very happy with this recipe. It is a great basic recipe, no odd ingredients that i had to search all over for, which is what I really liked about it. It was very sticky at times, as the submitter mentioned but I followed suggestions that others had mentioned like using Crisco and it all worked out great. I actually cut some pieces and froze them to stick directly to frosting which i had used in conjunction with the fondant. My son's MarioKart cake was the hit of the party. Thanks Kiele!

Loved it ~ I rarely work with fondant so I was a bit nervous when starting this recipe.  It does seem a mess the first few minutes but I followed it perfectly (maybe adding a bit more Crisco to the mixture and my hands).  
After about 8 minutes, it just became beautiful fondant, hardly sticky at all!  Don't give up, just keep kneading!! 
I let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The next morning I let it sit out room temp for at least an hour.  If you try to knead too early (meaning it's still cold) it's difficult and will tear.  I added quite a bit of Crisco back to the fondant to help knead it out easily....it became very oily and slick and began to tear easily.  I let it sit a few mintues and then poured cornstarch onto my counter and started kneading - - it became beautiful fondant again!  
I pressed it flat with my hands and spread it out first (because this recipe delivers a lot of fondant, it's difficult to work with a rolling pin).  Then I used my fondant rolling pin to make it very thin and I kept moving the fondant around and lifting it while rolling.  This way it was super easy to lift and cover the cake!  
I covered a 2-tier wedding cake to serve 60 with this fondant and had plenty left over!
And if you need to add color or flavor, add it to the hot marshmallow mixture directly out of the microwave.
Excellent!!!!

Thank you SOOO much for this recipe! I spend $17 on 2lbs of fondant last week and it was blah. I have a Baby Shower that I have to bake for and this recipe saved me tons of money and taste great! I added the marshmallows, water and vanilla to my KA and added the sugar, about a cup at a time. My only flaw was that I got scared it wasn't the right consistency and tried to kneed the rest by hand, BIG MISTAKE, it was so sticky and soft. I put it all back in the KA added more sugar and it was perfect.

You need WAY more sugar than what is stated in the recipe. Other than that, it was great. I liked the flavor of this fondant over more traditional fondants and its very easy to use. I was just trying to cover a 9 in cake, and this was WAY too much fondant. I will need to scale it back next time.

I agree with all the other reviewers - this is super easy to do!  It's my first time working with fondant, and it's been very very easy.  To the reviewer who mentioned using the bread hook and the mixer - it worked perfectly!  I highly recommend this...it helps keep the super stickiness off your hands!  Just make sure to use tons of shortening on the bowl and the bread hook.  Great recipe!

This was not as easy as the recipe made it sound, I had to add a LOT of sugar to make mine not a sticky mess. It also cracked, but that might have just been my inexperience.

I SO wanted to LOVE this recipe.  However, my first attempt at fondant - a layered peanut butter and chocolate cake for my best friend's b-day, that was supposed to look like a wrapped Reese's PB cup - was disastrous.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and I was hopeful after kneading all that powdered sugar, rolling it into a smooth, gorgeous orange ball, wrapping it and throwing it into the fridge.  I pulled it out two days later and attempted to roll it out and make my lovely-tasting cake lovelier, but after almost 3 hours - working with it, re-refrigerating it, and working with it some more - I got so frustrated, I gave up on my masterpiece.  I rolled it out to be as smooth as I could get it, transferred it to the cake (tearing it, of course), and tried not to react like a young child (crying and throwing things).  My cake was SO ugly... and the fondant didn't taste good either or enhance the cake in any way...  I guess I'll stick to ganaches, frostings, and glazes.  This just was not worth the ingredients or the effort.  But at least the cake was delicious (albeit sinfully so).  I should say, also, that I absolutely take ownership of my newby-ness, that maybe my inexperience is why it aesthetically didn't work out for me, but, even so, as far as flavor, it wasn't good.  We just peeled it off anyway -- like the cake needed to be any sweeter?!  Well done fondant looks cool, but like so many things in our culture, it's wasteful and excessive.

was totally excellent. Never knew the recipe was soo fast to make. I didn't have any problems with following the directions. Except in the final step.. when I rolled my fondant out. I didn't follow the "traditional"rules with the powdered sugar. I used a tool called "the mat" by Sweet Wise and I put my fondant in between the food grade vinyl and rolled it out with out adding extra sugar. And have to say, for buying the item before attempting to roll out the fondant the traditional way, made my experience with making fondant and working with it a lot easier. And again on the recipe...was excellent. Didn't change anything else. Thanks.

Wow, okay, like most of the other reviewers, this was a first for me.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will tell you this started out so unbelievably sticky that I had a very bad feeling about the outcome of this little experiment.  After a couple of minutes of hopelessly trying to knead this sticky mixture (which by the way, I did everything by hand as I do not have a standing mixer with me right now), I stopped and let it rest and cool down a bit.  After a couple of minutes, I started in again and it was like night and day.  The mixture became able to be kneaded and everything went perfectly after that.  I did have to use 2 more cups of powdered sugar to get it to the right consistency where it was no longer sticky when kneaded.  It tastes really good!  This recipe has inspired me to learn how to decorate cakes!

This was so easy to make and ended up costing me only about $3 total to make. I got about 3 pounds out of each mix and made twice to cover a 12" and a 8" cake plus had lots extra to make decorations. I like the consistency and it taste much better than the $20 Wilton fondant I have been using...thanks for this recipe!

Great recipe that tastes great without paying for overpriced pre made fondant. I didn't have a kitchen aid so I made this by hand. It was a pretty messy situation but worth it. Just make sure to completely grease (I used shortening)  the clean counter and your hands before putting touching the  mixture, otherwise it gets crazy sticky. I colored the fondant right after I melted the marshmallows and before I added the sugar. Make sure you put a pile of the sugar on the counter before putting the mixture on it. It felt like I was kneading forever before it started to harden but after adding more con. sugar it finally got to the right consistency. I made it a few days before topping the cake. It hardens a little in the refrigerator also. I just nuked it for ten seconds. Make sure before you roll the fondant out that the counter is completely clean of all debris and has confectioner sugar on the entire area that you are rolling it out on. I didn't and caused a few tears when trying to get it off the counter. I would suggest watching a You Tube tutorial if you've never made it before!

While I've never attempted to cover a cake, I have used fondant many times to make cake/cupcake toppers and decorations.  I've always used store-bought stuff.  In an effort to save a few bucks, I decided to try out this recipe.

It was perfect!  I have no complaints at all.  Like another reviewer, I just threw it all in my stand mixer with the dough hook and kneaded it that way.  I've been making little dogs for cupcake toppers for my daughter's birthday party this week and they are amazing!  Thanks so much for the great recipe - I'll never buy the pre-made stuff again!

I thought this fondant was very easy to make and to work with.  It did dry out a little while I was working with it, so I just added a little water and VOILA!  Don't forget to add the water!!  I made 2 batches and forgot on the second batch.  Killed my mixer. :(  And I still gave it 5 stars. :)  I left out the vanilla and used butter flavored shortening.  It is very rich so we all had a smaller than normal piece, but my waistline thanks you.

So I guess I'm not the only one who has a ruined mixer now!  I stopped long before it should have been too thick to mix, but it still stripped a gear.  I mixed the rest by hand, and it was like many other reviewers said, that it was too sticky to work with no matter how much sugar etc you add to it.  I got tired of messing with it.  Too much trouble!

I followed the recipe exactly and I added butter extract and almont extract.  I also followed other reviewers advice about spraying the marshmallow bowl and the Kitchenaid bowl.  This fondant was so much easier to work with than the kind you buy in a box... and literally 100 times better tasting!  Your guests WILL NOT be scraping off this fondant!  Thank you for sharing this SPECTACULAR fondant recipe!

this tasted amazing, but it was very difficult to make. needed alot more icing sugar than called for. and cracked fairly easily when putting on the cake. you also need to make sure it is thoroughly warmed to room temperature or it will crumble and not hold together. i kneeded it with corn starch which i find made it less sticky than using just the icing sugar. overall, it turned out pretty good, but you have to be careful and make sure you are not on a time-constraint when making it

I have never used fondant but wanted to make some decorations for cupcakes so I decided to try this. What a MESS!!! It did turn out and I was able to make exactly what I wanted but I had hot marshmallow everywhere! I will probably use this recipe again if I can figure out how to keep it from getting all over everything. Thanks!

I have tried the other recipe using glycerin and glucose.  Three batches were bad and way more involved than this one.  This one is fast and easy to make.  I only waited 1.5 hrs and it was good.  Hint when using a kitchen aide mixer: butter the marshmallow bowl before nuking the mallos and they will slip right out into the metal mixer bowl.  Next time I will try buttering the metal mixer bowl too.  One batch covered an entire topsy turvy cake which was three tiers, each tier was 3 layers.

Great Recipe!  Like other raters, I used marshmellow cream instead of marshmellows and water.  It worked soo well!  I used to use cornstarch based fondant.  It was greasy and cracked easily.  I dealt with that, but after spending 11hrs on my last cake only to have it run into a mess of colors, I decided to get a new recipe.  I have never had such an easy time putting the base fondant on in my entire life!  I got it on the first try with no cracks.  I had no issues with colors running.  I took out the butter and subtracted clear vanilla and almond extract to make a perfect white fondant.  I could only get ivory with cornstarch.  This recipe is amazing!!!!

very easy for the first fondant I've ever used!  I always get compliments on how good it tastes.  make sure you are generous with the crisco on the hands to keep it from sticking and you shouldn't have any problems!  I don't always use the vanilla it's good without it.

I have been doing wedding cakes for over 12 years and have stayed away from fondant due to the horrible flavor.  Recently I had a friend request fondant and i told her that I would only use it if I could find one that tastes good.  THIS IS IT!!!   Sooooo easy, so yummy and it keeps amazingly in the fridge for use again later.   Honestly, this tastes like a cross between a circus peanut and candy corn!  YUMMO!   Dont be afraid to try this. Oh and a regular stand up mixer wont work.  You need to use a Kitchenaid with the paddle or whisk attachment otherwise it will bind up.  I learned the hard way. lol

Wow - this was amazingly easy.  Mine is in the fridge, so I am only reviewing the process of making the fondant.  Will review the process of actually using it next week.  I added the water to the marshmallows and then cooked in 30 second increments in the microwave until they stirred smooth (it took 90 seconds in my oven).  I then threw the marshmallow liquid, the vanilla, gel food coloring, and all the sugar into my Kitchenaid with the dough hook.  It took awhile on the lowest speed (at least 5 minutes) but it came out in a beautiful smooth ball that I then kneaded a few times by hand before wrapping and putting in the fridge.  I did have to scrape the bowl of the processor with a hard spatula once or twice, but other than that, this was very easy!  And, the dough tasted great - very delicious.  Can't wait to use it.

Mine came out too dry but I believe it is my fault I was still able to let the kids roll it out and we still put it on the cake and used the left overs for eatable playdoh. It was very fun and we will try again.

YUM!!  Best tasting fondant!  And if anyone claims its too "sticky" they should use more confectioners' sugar!  I had to work another cup into the dough.  Keep kneading until its not sticky everyone.

This was my first time doing fondant.  I took on the task of making sugar cross cookies for my nephews christening, and decorated with fondant.  Let me start with i thought it would be harder but it was not at all.  I used the best rolled sugar cookie recipe on this site.  The only recommendation when working with the fondant is make sure you put in the refrigerator the fondant you are not using. Because onces it gets to soft it is hard to roll.  I prepared the fondant and left it in the fridge over nite and prepared my cookies the next day.  Everyone raved how good the cookies turned out.  Happy decorating.

Very easy! I didn't add the vanilla - it was not needed. I also used my kitchen aid to kneed the fondant vs doing it by hand and it came out smooth and shiny. Also, use Crisco, not butter. Using the KA is bonus when adding color since it mixes so nicely.

I have used fondant before, and this didn't roll our or feel like normal.  It does taste better.  I tried all of the previous suggestions of refrigeration, veg oil, powdered sugar.  I spent 1 hr trying to get a 11" circle to cover one layer.  It's too sticky, then to hard, then too sticky, repeat.  I finally managed to get a piece up and it cracked.  Please don't make my mistake, look elsewhere.

This did not turn out well for me at all.  I kneaded the dough, adding lots of icing sugar, but it still remained sticky and even did not work after refridgerating.   Maybe I did something wrong - I also found Crisco helped with handling, but overall I could not get it to work unfortunately :( I won't use again, all it made was a mess!

This is the fondant recipe I use everytime I make fondant and it turns out perfect.  Easy to work with!  Like a reviewer suggested, I put in wilton food color gel right after I melt the marshmallows and the color is always fantastic and even.

I made this recipe last night for the first time for a trial cake. Now I can't wait for the next occasion that I will bake a cake for!  I'll wow them!  Here is a fun way to play.  I took a little of the white, and kneaded orange gel coloring into it. Then I went ahead and rolled the white out flat to cover my cake, but not quite all the way.  I then pinched little pieces of orange and rolled them into 1 to 3 inch "snakes" not quite as thin as thread, but thinner than yarn.  I arranged these on the white fondant that I had already started rolling out to fit over my cake, to look like tiger stripes, then finished rolling it to the size of my cake.  The orange stripes pressed into the white, and spread a little, and the finished product looked like they had been painted on, they were so incorporated in! Try this for making it chocolate: Add 1 ounce of quality melted chocolate to the melted marshmallows, and one tablespoon of cocoa powder to the powdered sugar.  (I haven't tried this myself yet, but read this technique on a decorator's website who uses this recipe for fondant.)

I've had this recipe in my box forever and finally got around to trying it. It was *fairly* easy to put together...however, my "dough" ended up being very hard even before I added all the powdered sugar. I used marshmallow creme instead of marshmallows, simply thinking it would save me a step. In the end, though, I had to add more water to get it all to *finally* incorporate. I'd read lots and lots of reviews prior to making and add plenty of Crisco on hand because I read so much about the stickiness, but barely needed any. I also pictured this making a huge mess and driving me nuts, but that didn't happen at all. As far as taste, I personally don't like it any better than store-bought fondant, but I do like that I can make it myself and with so few ingredients. It took gel paste coloring well and so far, as been fairly easy to work with and make cupcake toppers. It's just sitting in my fridge right now, waiting for me to be inspired to create something.

I made this as written the first time...ans it turned out great...though it ruined my hand mixer. (it smoked the little motor right up)  My husband then bought me a KitchenAid...and it did the job.  However, the second time around, I used marshmallow fluff.  The results were nowhere near as nice.  It was way stickier...and I needed a lot more sugar...and the taste wasn't as nice as a result.  I will stick to the heating of mini-marshmallows from now on.  (btw, I was making fondant flowers for a friend's wedding cupcakes with this recipe.)

So this was good stuff, but refrigerating overnight made it turn back into marshmallow fluff.  Was an easy fix--I reheated it and worked in some more powdered sugar, but it would've been better just to make it morning of--it was like doing twice the work for the same result.  At any rate, I was able to make fondant cars for my son's birthday cake, and we were thrilled with the results.  Thanks!  EDIT:  This is the third time I have made this now.  Using it over and over has made me appreciate the ease of this recipe in comparison with regular fondant!  If you like marshmallows, you're going to love this fondant.  Otherwise, if you're like me, you might peel it off and leave it on your plate.  It's still worlds better than regular fondant, though!  Give it a shot.  :)

First time making fondant and making a "fancy" cake.  Was pretty easy, would definatley recommend using a Kitchen Aid mixer.  Made a lady bug for a friends daughter, and still have enough fondant left for probably 2 more lady bugs.  A lot of fun!!!

Hello! I just made this fondant and it was super fabulous!! I've made a few fondant cakes using the Rolled Buttercream Fondant by Kelley, but I am making my 1st wedding cake in a few weeks and I wanted to try out a different recipe.  It tasted pretty good, although I do prefer the flavor of Rolled Buttercream Fondant. I will definitely be using this fondant because it  was super easy and not as sticky as you would think! The best parts are the ease of coloring the fondant and how quick it comes together. **Okay I just changed my rating from a 5 to a 3 and this is why: It truly was easy to make, but when I actually went to use it for my cake it was really hard to roll without sticking to my counter. I had to use LOTS of powdered sugar, which made a huge mess to clean up. Also it was not smooth and I ended up having many cracks all over my cake! Each batch turned out this way and I followed the recipe exactly. Sorry, but I will be switching back to the Rolled Buttercream Fondant!

There is no fault in this recipe. I'm merely an idiot and an amateur chef that needs more practice, to be sure. But the lilies that I made with this fondant were quite pretty though I must confess I am frothing with jealousy while looking at some of the pictures on here from cooks, no artists, much more talented than myself- in particular, the beautiful Easter type egg basket that's on this recipe page- goodness, that's talent.

So glad I found this recipe, wonderful and easy! However, be prepared to put in a bit of muscle power coloring it if you don't have a powerful mixer on hand!

This was my first attempt at fondant.  WOW!!!  So easy & it doesn't taste bad like other fondants I've eaten.  I did sub butter for Crisco as others suggested, it definitely keeps your hands from sticking to the mixture.

Playdough for Mommy!  Super simple to make- I used a double boiler (don't have a microwave).  This will ruin a normal hand mixer, so be careful! I mixed in the first few cups of powdered sugar with my mixer, then beat in the rest by hand. It's stiff, but definitely do-able.  I greased my rolling pin, my hands, and the table with butter when I rolled this out, and it didn't stick to anything.  The taste is just pure sugar- nothing else., It's kind of like eating a giant wad of gum.   It takes a TON of food coloring to get any dark colors in this stuff, so I would stick with using it for pastels, or you will get a strong chemical flavor from the food coloring.  Also- be sure to frost the cake with a layer of plain frosting before you put the fondant onto it.  It cuts down on the crumbs, plus gives people the option of peeling off the fondant layer to eat just plain frosted cake.  Not everyone liked the texture and taste of the fondant.  All in all, a really fun experience, and adds a whole new dimension to cake decorating! I can't wait to try it again!

This tasted good, but would not roll out. It kept sticking to the table and would rip when we tried to pick it up from the table. It probably needs more powdered sugar than it says and needs to stay very cold while rolling.

I made 3 batches of this yesterday. The first one was kinda difficult, but after that it was super easy. I made a ton of flowrs with it for a friends bridal shower cake. Not only do they taste yummy they are also very beautiful. I didnt feel like waiting for the fondant to sit in the fridge overnight so I just put it in the freezer for 45 min and then let it sit out for 30 before I rolled it out. I'm so excited that this was so easy. I think every cake I make will have fondant on it now!!

Tasted great and for it worked well. I think I prefer to roll it out on butter (instead of c.sugar) as it gives the fondant a lovely polished sheen. I also noticed that if you add color towards the end, using some butter when you knead the color in helps avoid a marbled look and gives a smooth spread of the color. I've tried to use this fondant to make figurines with no luck :( It's way too soft and doesn't hold the shape :(

I have made Spongebob's entire body, Ninja Turtles, Littlest Pet Shop, a three tier super hero cake, a Replica of Radiator Springs from "Cars" and lots more, all with great success!

this is an excellent recipe! TIP: i usually don't like fondant that's overbearingly sweet i substitute half the amount of confec. sugar for corn starch. you can barely taste the different in sweetness but it's less unhealthier LOL and still gives you the thick texture (because there's already a little corn starch in confectioner's sugar anyway)  this is a simple and wonderful recipe! i used it to make petits fours! Email me if you want a great petit four recipe!

Can't believe I forgot to review this recipe!  After all the trepidation I felt about trying this recipe, I discovered that it was very easy to manage!  I followed the directions, and everything was true to form.  The only thing I would change would be to add candy flavoring during the initial mixing.  Now if only I could make my cakes look like Kiele's!!!

Wonderful recipe! This is my first time working with fondant and it was such a pleasure. It was easy to work with and, for fondant, doesn't taste bad at all. In about 4 hours, I made a cake that I'm still beaming about. =)  I made the fondant exactly as directed in the recipe, but with almond flavor instead of vanilla. The first color I made was difficult because I didn't add enough sugar before I started kneading it. After I realized my mistake it was a breeze. To roll it out thinly, I put down some syran wrap laid my kneaded "dough" on it, and then layed another layer of syran wrap on top. I used a rolling pin on it and it was incredibly easy to roll out - barely any sticking and I got it really thin. Then I pulled the top layer off and carried it to the cake using the bottom layer.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! I've made several batches since and each one has been wonderful.  I did not have problems rolling the fondant out at all, just used extra sugar or butter when necessary!  This is my go-to recipe for fondant from now on - it even tastes yummy!  Thank you!!

This turned out really great.  I added more icing sugar than the recipe called for. I used butter but next time I will try crisco.  I rolled it out in corn starch and that worked fine.  I added pink colouring to the icing while in the kitchen aid mixer, then I put it in the fridge for 2 days and it rolled out perfectly fine when it was time to make the cake.  I made the cake a daye early then put it in the fridge overnight and it was great.  I will make this recipe again.

After reading all the rave reviews this recipe was a huge disappointment and not near as easy as other reviewers led me to believe. The fondant literally broke my mixer because it was so thick. After adding about a pound more in powdered sugar than this recipe actually called for the dough finally got "less sticky" at least to the point where I could roll it out some. However, it wasn't as easy to work with as store bought fondant. It had a play dough texture only softer so you had to be extremely careful with it. Since it had to be rolled out so thick to avoid tearing the recipe didn't go a very long way and I didn't even have enough for one novelty cake the size of a regular sheet cake. As for the taste, it's better than store bought fondant, but it's not by any means good. It's sugar overkill and you're much better off just making a regular buttercream or cream cheese frosting. I will not make this again.

This is so much cheaper then store bought fondant and tastes much better too. If you want to color the fondant I suggest adding the color to the melted marshmallow before adding the sugar. My fondant cracked, even when kneading in more vegetable shortening. I did not use butter, I used crisco. And used powdered sugar on my counters and crisco on the rolling pin.  I would use this again I just need to figure a way to make it so it doesnt crack so easily.

I have to make a naughty bachelorette cake and needed some fondant so I whipped up a batch of this for a test run.  I kneaded it in my KA mixer & used shortening instead of butter.  It was SUPER QUICK & EASY & only two dirty bowls!  I've found using colored marshmallows makes great flesh color without any extra ingredients.  They say to use mostly peach with some pink thrown in.  Since this was a test run I just used the whole bag (green & yellow included) and I don't think I could have gotten closer to flesh colored if I tried!  Different brands may contain different % of colors but the generic bag I used worked great!  UPDATE: After refrigerating overnight, I  tried to roll it out w/crisco -what a mess!  Then I used powdered sugar -much better!  Then to get the powdered look off, I just sprayed it lightly w/Pam.  The finished product: well, it doesn't taste "good" but it tastes about 10 times better than the store stuff for a fraction of the price.  My dad's words: "that cake was really good but that weird icing was not good at all!"  Given that, I would only use this for presentation in the future & basically expect for it to be peeled off the cake.  Thanks!

Very Easy to make. I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer with the bread hook and let it do the work. I used other reviewers recommendation of spraying butter flavored pam in the bowl the marshmallows were to be melted in, the hook for my mixer and the mixing bowl. Cleanup was less than 5 minutes. It tasted great. We rolled it thin.

This was more difficult to make than expected and it was even more difficult to apply.  But, all in all, for yummy fondant that I can do at home quite easily and cheaply, I thought it worked well! (My mantra was "No such thing as too much shortening on my hands!")  My husband got in on the fun and I made him make me a cupcake.  His was horribly disfigured and I absolutely loved it as my favorite!  I guess cupcakes don't need to be pretty to be lovable! lol

This is a great recipe. The fondant was really easy to work with. My first batch was not so great, but my second batch was a success. I didnt use any of the butter. Instead I used non-stick cooking spray. Will be using this recipe again real soon!

This was my first attempt at fondant, and I really liked the taste and look of this recipe.  I didn't realize quite how messy it was going to be though (I think by the end I had a sticky reside  of confectioner's sugar on the floor, counters, and everything else I managed to touch even if it was just a little bit).  Regardless, I will be making this again and again, and was amazed how professional my cookie look after I put this one them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was nervous to try my first fondant, but this was a pretty easy recipe.  After reading up on fondant I kept hearing how difficult it was!  If you can make cut out cookies, you can do this! I mixed it by hand, as another reviewer sugesting (I didn't want to mess with geting out my big mixer).  Next time I will use the mixer, as it was a very messy job and probably took longer that way.  I also used crisco instead of butter, as I had extra I needed to use.  I mixed in the food coloring after it was finished, and had to constantly put more shortning on my hands to keep it from sticking.  I also sprinkled the table with corn startch when I rolled it out.  All in all, it was very easy.  Had no trouble with it breaking or tearing.  Oh, I also had to add extra powdered sugar. About a handful more.  However, I didn't have the exact amount of marshmellows.  I had two 10 oz bags, so I guessed at what 16 oz was.  It's not too tricky a recipe, as it turned out fine even with my marshmellow problem!  I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

This is so much fun!  I did need butter to keep it from sticking to the counter.  I did some fondant figures and while I was working with different colors of fondant, other pieces would dry out.  I would knead in butter to revive it--worked perfect!

This is my second attempt at making marshmallow fondant. The first batch I tried to make chocolate, which was a big mistake since I'd never made it before and ended up with a lovely batch of fudge...:)  Then I found this recipe...and it came out amazing!!!  The texture was great and I was even able to cut out some immediately...I've refrigerated the rest and can't wait to bake a cake to try it on that.  The flavor was good, but I'm going to try a little less icing sugar and a little more vanilla next time as my fiance thought it was a tad sweet.  I also found that greasing your hands and the surface with vegetable shortening worked better than icing sugar to knead and roll out...I can't thank you enough for this easy, wonderful recipe!!!

This is a fantastic recipe though terribly sweet. The dough is incredibly workable. I did have to roll it out a few times because you need a lot of powder sugar on your rolling surface (or else it will stick like it did for me a few times).  Definitely add the colorant to the melted marshmallows before you add in the powder sugar. It will be a lot easier than kneeding it in. Great recipe!!!

Very easy and tasty too! I have several colors in my fridge right now. It keeps very well if you rub the surface with shortening and wrap in plastic. I have also used it without letting it rest and had great results. I agree with another reviewer...adult play-dough...fun!

Great recipe! I've made this a few times now and made some tweaks each time, but I think I've hit on my personal favorite.

 - I used marshmallow creme instead of mini marshmallows. I put one container (7 oz) in the microwave for 30 sec, then put it in my stand mixer along with about 1/8 cup of water and 1/4 tsp of mint extract. I chose mint rather than vanilla partially because I love mint (as does my whole family) and partially because it helps cut some of the sweetness. I beat those in the stand mixer until smooth, then added the dry ingredients.

 - For the 7 oz of fluff, I used 1 cup each of confectioners' sugar and flour. Using equal parts sugar and flour (instead of all sugar) again helps cut down on the sweetness. I added the mixture 1/2 cup at a time and let the stand mixer blend it until it turned doughy. It was super obvious when everything coagulated into the right consistency, and it really didn't take that long at all. Way faster (and less messy) than kneading everything by hand.

 - I sprinkled a piece of parchment paper with some more of the sugar/flour mixture and covered my hands with it. Then I dumped the dough out and kneaded by hand until it became the consistency of modeling clay. If it started to get sticky, I would just give it (and my hands) a light coating of the sugar/flour mixture and continue kneading. At this point, I added the color, because I needed small amounts of multiple colors and didn't want to spend forever dividing everything up beforeh

This recipe is wonderful, beyond easy to make and works great for covering and decorating cakes.  I make cakes frequently and use fondant frequently. I would not use butter and stick to crisco as that is the normal for when handling fondant. I must  say that the colors are more vibrant and take on prettier with this recipe than the bakery store bought. Another tip is once you are ready to roll out your fondant I would not use more powder sugar as this only fries out your fondant and makes it more difficult to work with and crack/tear easier. I always use corn starch.

Taking a fondant cake class and trying to find a better tasting fondant. I actually  used peppermint marshmallows from Christmas with a pkg. Of white marshmallows.  Made a perfect pink for my heart valentine's cake. The flavor is delicious without being sugary and Overly sweet. Love it so far.

Tastes great and works great so far (still working on cake).

But, it can be really super sticky. I got it stuck all over my hands trying to knead it. So two tips for those wanting to make this (and myself for the future):
1. Use an electric mixer (yes I tried it manual lol)
2. Coat your hands with crisco, the butter doesn't work that well. If you don't you will end up with a sticky mess all over your hands.

Follow those two rules of thumb and you will be good.

I've never really tried to work with fondant before and I wanted to make a cake for a bridal shower so I gave this recipe a try.  It was really easy and turned out great for a first timer.  I did as another reviewer suggested and used marshmallow fluff and used my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook and it came together quickly.  I added the gel color to the marshmallow fluff then added the powdered sugar.  I popped it into the freezer for about an hour then kneaded it on a mat with a little cornstarch and it was pretty smooth sailing.  I did put a crumb coat or "dirty ice" my cake and put the layers in the freezer to set up while I made the fondant so it would have something to adhere to and the cake would be firm enough to play around with.  All-in-all not a bad experience for my first foray with fondant.

Loved it!!!!!  I noticed most people thought one should add the butter to the recipe which is not the case. The butter is to rub on your hands before knead it.  This adds some butter flavor without adding it to your recipe.  turned out beautiful.  I covered a 9 inch cake with half the recipe.

Disgustingly sweet, dead sweet. Taste none of the marshmallows or vanilla-- it's like eating spoonful of powdered sugar. No one at the baby shower could stand it, either. I felt so incompetent after hearing the complaints. Some guests even said why do you not cut the sugar? I said well if I cut it then it becomes too sticky and not workable. But what do they know? They only know it just looks good but taste BAD. 

Hope someone will invent a better version of this recipe...

I used this recipe last year after spending a fortune on very stiff and (honestly, not very tasty) store brand fondant.
It tastes amazing with a little vanilla extract and the kids had a ball coloring it - I used the generic food coloring drops -   just slathered their hands with Crisco and let them go to town with it. Very little stains. The key to the best consistency, in my opinion, is taking the time to knead it thoroughly before rolling or shaping it. Made some very cute butterflies and Hello Kitty faces for cupcake decoration. I let it air dry overnight on some foil to give it the right shape and then popped them on the cupcakes at the last minute. They will stay hard if stored in an airtight container. I made them a week ahead.

I've never made fondant before mostly because just reading the recipes made me sweat!  This is definitely a no-sweat recipe.  The only recommendation I would make is DO NOT USE A HAND MIXER.  I have (had)a fairly heavy-duty one and it's toast now.  At least it's close to Christmas and I can put that stand mixer I've always wanted on my wish list!

Thanks for posting this recipe.  It's definitely a five-star keeper!

This was my first time making fondant and it was not only easy to make, but it tastes great too!  I took the advice of others and added the food coloring into the melted marshmallows and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I used Marshmellow Cream (Jet Puff)  like a previous poster had recommended and used 1/2!tsp of almond extract instead of vanilla and it turned out perfect! This is an amazing and easy fondant recipe! Love it!

I didn't know a thing about fondant until 1 day ago when I decided to use it on a birthday cake. I made this recipe and now I will always use this recipe whenever I need fondant. It turned out great! and was so easy! Just like cutting out cookies.
Note - I used Crisco instead of butter.

During the making process I wasn't sure that I was ever going to make this again, because it was sticky and very messy and everyone pulls the fondant off anyways. I decorated my sons bday cake and let it sit for a day and was amazed at how much better it tasted than store bought fondant. It was soft has a great flavor, even though its pure sugar, and just about everyone ate it!! I have decorated several cake and will continue to use this recipe. It does dry out fast once it's rolled so be sure to get it on your cake quickly, or it starts to crack a little.

This was my first attempt at making fondant. I followed the directions and everything was fine until the cup of powdered sugar I reserved for kneading, seem to run out. The mixture became too sticky to work with and I had to add more powered sugar. Is this normal, or did I do something wrong? After continuously adding powdered sugar (about 1/2 lb) I was able to work it long enough to add in color. Maybe next time I will leave out the butter, and cut back a little on the water. One more question I had is, why even use butter? Couldn't you just use powdered sugar to make it not stick to everything? Thanks!

Tastes amazing. Very simple recipe. Definitely add the food colouring when you are stirring in the water/vanilla. So much easier and no mess on your hands. Also, make sure you coat EVERYTHING with oil/butter/crisco/slippery goo. It will stick to you like the Blob, otherwise. Especially your fingertips when you work the powdered sugar in, between kneading. Maybe I put too much aside when initially mixing it in and that's why? Who knows. Turned out wonderfully though! Will be rolling out tonight over a TARDIS cake for Dr Who. Will post pictures soon, hopefully!

I use almost that recipe except the butter. I put the water and/or vanilla in a bowl microwave the marshmallows. I incorporate the sifted icing sugar. Totally grease your spoon with shortening and your hands and the counter, knead in the rest of the icing sugar. Takes a while but it is worth it. cover it with shortening & wrap in plastic, then a bag & let it sit overnight if possible. If you need to model figurines etc. add a small amount of gumpaste powder. If its too dry add water spoonful at a time, too sticky add sugar. Tastes so much better than bought fondant. Just remember to grease everything that comes in contact. To roll a large piece (10 in cake or larger) I grease the rolling area & use a heavy piece of plastic, rolls out much easier. Remember to move it around as  you roll it.I was totally intimidated but once I did it I have become obsessed with decorating cakes.

Perfect! I used to go through the trouble of making fondant from glycerin and all that other junk, and I can't believe I wasted so much time and energy. This fondant is not only easy to make and easier to work with but it's delicious!

Follow the recipe exactly, let your KitchenAid as much of the work as possible, and be patient.  This is by far the easiest fondant I've ever worked with!

This was easy to make.  Very tasty especially when it sits awhile after being made.  But, I  did not have to use all of the 1 cup of powdered sugar reserved nor all of the 1/4 cup of butter to handle the fondant as it was unnecessary.  Unfortunately, when rolled out after coming to room temp, it did crack and dried very quickly.  Needs tweeking..or find a better recipe..my first attempt on making fondant-overall the taste was superb and birthday girl loved it..just difficult to decorate with..

Great recipe..very simple to make just make sure you have strong arm muscles because the stiring and mixing and rolling this out took allot of strength and time. Otherwise worked perfectly..I just added my coloring to the mixture before adding in all the powdered sugar so the color got really mixed in. Thanks!

I've never made fondant before so I was a little nervous! I took the advice from other reviews and it is very sticky but if you keep at it it turns out beautiful and tasty! I also took the advice of another review on here by adding food coloring to the melted marshmallow first thing! I'm so glad I did that WAY easier! Thanks for the great recipe! I will make this again!

I have a tried a number of different recipes but this is the one I have found to be the easiest to work with.  The only change I made was that instead of 1 tsp of vanilla, I added 1/4 tsp vanilla, lemon, orange & almond extract.  It gives it a very interesting flavor.

I have never made fondant the "old-fashioned" way,so I can't compare the two; but this recipe is easy and it WORKS!  I followed the advice of one reviewer and used marshmallow creme, instead of marshmallows and water.  It turned out beautifully.  In fact, my 9 year old daughter decorated my son's birthday cake with this fondant...and she had never used fondant before!  She did an excellent job with it!  Wonderful recipe.  =0)

A little sticky to work with, the more sugar I added the dryer it got. My cake looked beautiful, however! But, most people peeled it off and ate the delicious buttercream underneath.

This was my first time with fondant, so I am a novice and it worked great for me BUT (this is a big but) mine was ooey-gooey sticky when I tried to knead it to a pliable consistentcy. DO NOT LOSE HEART! Just knead it as much as you can and put it in the fridge. The next day, I took it out of the fridge and worked with it, keeping my hands and all surfaces it touched coated with corn starch. Keep that stuff handy, and the minute it starts getting tacky, do a recoat! I wish this was in the original recipe, I think it would have elimited most of the negative comments. Perhaps I used cheap marshmallows but even with cheap marshmallows, I believe you can make it work. I would also recommend trying your fav extract flavoring as a sub for the vanilla. And don't be shy about it. This stuff is not tasty but that should give it a little personality.

I LOVE this recipe!  It tastes wonderful and colors well.  I'm not very good at using it yet, so I spend a lot of time scraping it off my counter, but the end product is worth the effort!  I don't make any changes, although I would love to know how to make it a little thinner during the mixing process.  It actually ruined my stand mixer because of it's thickness.

I highly reccomend this fondant, I personally found it to be a lot tastier than traditional fondant because of the marshmallows.  If you are hesitant to try a fondant recipe, have no fear! The first time I tried this recipe I was pleasantly surprised at how simple it was.  I will definitely keep using this recipe cake decorating!!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY but it ended up a sticky blob with a rubber like consistency. I then added more powdered sugar to compensate for the stickyness, but it was still sticky after MUCH kneading. The "Rolled Fondant" by Marlene came out better.

This turned out awesome! I made two batches.  The first I added color while mixing and the second batch I added color during kneading.  They both turned out great and it wasn't hard to add color during kneading like some reviews said.  Use clear vanilla extract/flavoring if you want it to turn out white.  Also use the shortening on the countertop and roller as others have said.  I tried just powder sugar and it stuck badly.  The shortening worked and didn't affect the fondant.  This was my first time making fondant and it was so easy and turned out awesome!!  Everyone gushed over how good it looked.

So messy to make!  Use lots of butter when working with it.  It looks great. It was a little too sweet!  The kids loved it, but all the adults put it to the side.

While making this, I was wondering if I would ever get untangled from the sticky mess and if it would come together...but it did, and quite nicely too. I colored it with Wilton frosting coloring and had yummy sweet fondant instead of the yucky other stuff. Love it!

Really easy to make especially it being my first time with fondant! I also used shortening in place of butter, as well as clear vanilla extract to achieve a whiter fondant. If you wanted a crisp white I suggest using a while gel. However, I took off a star for taste. It doesn't taste as great as the reviews say. As all fondants are, its there for looks more than taste. Everyone peeled it off before eating the cake. It's not like candy like some reviews say. It just tastes like a gummy ball of confectioners suger. It held up well in the heat and humidity at the bbq. Would use again.

Better tasting and much cheaper alternative to store bought fondant.  It really does take some work to get it smooth and workable, but it's worth it.  I used non-stick spray on my hands when kneading, reapplying as needed, and it turned out fine.  Make sure it comes to room temp before trying to work with it or it will crack.  The sugars need to be warm and soft or you will get a lumpy and hard to work with mess.  Also, I would bypass the stand mixer for this one unless you really do want to burn out your machine.  The dough is way too thick to knead all the way in the mixer.

When I saw this recipe I was so excited.  I have always preferred to not use fondant because of the taste but this I had a feeling was going to be good.   And it is!  I decided to go on one reviewer’s recommendations and use marshmallow fluff when mixed with only one pound of powder sugar it was crumbly so I melt some marshmallows and added that in and it fixed it.  I would recommend sticking with original recipe.  It works and is just excellent.

This was SUPER easy to make and it tasted GREAT!  I followed others advice and used Crisco instead of butter.  It was VERY sticky work, and took longer than I thought to knead the dough, but it got there.  I left it in the fridge overnight, and started working with it the next morning.  It was pretty stiff, but ripped it apart and got it pliable in smaller sections, as I'm just not used to kneading.  But once it was workable, it became very easy to use.  My biggest problem was I ran out of counter space!  This being my first time using fondant (I don't consider my disaster about 5 years ago with the store-bought stuff!), I wasn't sure about the amount to use on my cake, etc.  But my Hello Kitty cake (made from 2 8in round cake pans stacked) turned out great!  The color of the Marshmallow Fondant here didn't need to be changed at all, and again, the taste was fabulous!  And I had a TON left over!

I am one of those people who HATE the taste of Fondant, and if you are one of them as well, don't let this dissuade you.  This is infinitely better.  For years my personal cake decorating has been limited to my buttercream creations, but I've always wanted to try a hand at Fondant decorating.  But why try something if you don't want to taste it?  Now I have no worries!

Made 2 batches today in advance for my daughter's birthday cake. As far as process goes, it was much easier than anticipated. I used my hand mixer with greased dough hook attachments. One batch I colored, one I left white. Taste is very good. Now, I just hope it holds up until I need it in 5 days. I rubbed the outside with Crisco, wrapped it tight in plastic wrap and put it in a sealed zipper bag with all the air squeezed out. Another website said to leave it in the pantry instead of the fridge, since it contains  nothing that will spoil and that the condensation of the cold fridge to room temp can cause streaks/discoloration.  Fingers crossed!
***UPDATE*** Made the cake for the birthday party and it held up really well. It was slightly dry so I added a few drops of water, kneaded it in and it was good as fresh.

This recipe was really terrific!  I made a tea party scene for the top of a Mother's Day cake, and I think it came out adorable.  I was worried when I first started the kneading process because it was so sticky, but I just kept at it and added extra powdered sugar until I got the right consistency.  Very happy with the final product (and it tastes great, too)!  Thanks for this gem.

This was my first time making fondant and it was a nightmare.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and no matter how much butter and sugar I used I could not get it to stop sticking to me and the board.  I'm glad I didn't use a mixer since apparently from what some of the reviewers said, mine could have also been at risk of breaking.  With the mess that's all over my kitchen, the frustration of not being able to have something work out properly and it not even tasting all that great anyway, I just can't give this recipe another rating.   I'm determined to make my own cakes though, so I will try again someday with another recipe.

Fabulous recipe!! This weekend, I tried two fondant recipes, and this one was the hands down winner!! I only made a quarter of this recipe, as I did not have very much to cover, and I was able to do it without a problem. The problem with the fondant recipe I tried earlier this weekend was that it was too soft, no matter how much icing sugar I added, and was always stretching and ripping. Not this one. It was easy to roll, I was able to get it pretty thin without any tears. It was so easy, and much less sweet that the recipe I tried earlier this weekend! Definitely going to use this recipe for my sister's bridal shower cake!!

Excellent fondant! Was so easy to do and tastes great! One tip: if you have a Kitchen-Aid mixer, USE IT! It saves you a lot of elbow grease kneading the fondant.

This was a fun experiment I did with my kids tonight.  They had a ball cutting out random shapes.  I'm anxious to see how it is to roll it out tomorrow.  I pretty much followed the directions, but I decided I didn't need any butter.

I strongly recommend making this by the recipe, then if you don't like it make modifications. I read the reviews, and modified mine the first 2 times I made it, and it was HORRIBLE!! I made for a 3rd time, and followed the recipe to a tee, and it was wonderful. Easy to work with, didn't make a huge mess, and it even tasted better. My family loves this, and we no longer ice cakes!!

Tastes great! *Beware, it's very sticky to deal with, even with butter on your hands. After it refrigerates it is so much easier to handle.

I used a version of this recipe and it was really good. I would give it 5 stars with the following changes: substitute shortening for butter and eliminate the vanilla. The reason this recipe ends up not pure white is because of the butter and the vanilla. It tastes great without them and then you get a pure white fondant. It is very messy to make, but easy to work with once it's made. I'll definitely use this recipe every time! This was my first time working with fondant and it really wasn't as hard as everyone said it would be. Thanks! (Oh and since I only had a 10 pound bag of confectioners sugar, I used about 6 cups)

Thank you Kiele for taking the time and typing up the recipe. I have been using this recipe for a few years now with CRISCO, to obtain white color, and I add clear vanilla, or almond flavoring (subtract the amount from the water needed while making the fondant!!!) and it has worked magic for me, always. And I absolutely agree, add the coloring while melting the marshmallows.

Quite simple and easy to work with. It didn't make too much of a mess, either. I used the marshmallow fluff like other people suggested and greased the mixing bowl and mixer before mixing. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the taste, it was kind of wierd tasting. I think I would add a bit of almond extract next time.

It is the best tasting fondant I have ever had. It is a bit sticky and I found it difficult to color it unless you put the dye in while you are making it. It also seems to be really sticky and didn't work too well with my rolling pin. I am going to make it again and maybe it will turn out better this time.

I use this all the time when I make cakes. It tastes delicious, and its perfect for molding edible shapes. Make sure you add enough sugar, or it will be messy and hard to handle. Its also important to refridgerate it and let it sit for about an hour before using it, but not for too long or it will become soft and sticky.

Such a great recipe!! I've never used fondant before, this was my first time, I was surprised at how easy this was to make. My fondant was a little dry after I pulled it out of the fridge so I kept it wrapped and let it come to room temp them used crisco all over my hands and kneaded it until it was a moist play-dough consistency. I really recommend crisco rather than the butter. It works perfect and doesn't add any flavor or color.   Also, Mine only refrigerated for about 2 hours and was perfect. No need to cool over night.

I only gave this a low rating because I think I did something wrong, I don't think it was the recipe at all!! I tried making this for the first time, or any cake for that matter, for my husbands b~day. I had a lot of problems with it crumbling. I know it was something I did, I'm just not sure what I did.  For my first ever attempt at making & decorating a cake from scratch I'm pretty proud, even though a 9 year old in 4~H would do a better job. I will try to make this again, I'm determined to learn how to decorate my own cakes, I'll just practice through the year and not wait until I NEED a cake!  I'll try making it with the fluff next time. Any suggestions and help are greatly appreciated. Thank~you so much!

Big tip:  use cornstarch to knead your fondant instead of powdered sugar (or both).  It takes it out of th sticky stage faster.  I also rubbed butter all over my fondant before wrapping it in saran wrap and then a ziploc and stored in the fridge.  The next day, I left it out for awhile because it's more malleable when it's room temperature.   I have never worked with fondant before because I just never knew I could make it.  I tried it for the first time at a wedding in May 2010 and discovered it is not that great tasting... I wish I would have known I was supposed to peel it off of the cake and that it was mostly for decoration purposes.   Anyways, I got in the mood to dare fondant and ran across this recipe and it had rave reviews... and for good reason!!!!  It is so easy!!!! It really is like working with play dough but yummier :)  I made a fully adorned Christmas tree and presents with bows and ribbon :)  It was so easy to do but a bit time consuming.

Very easy!  First time ever making fondant, and I'm still willing to do it again.  Very sweet fondant, but much better tasting than the store-bought.

I liked it. First attempt at fondant.  It was a bit of a sticky mess at first if you do this by hand but it came together in the end and I was happy with the results.

This fondant, while perhaps workable in some applications, was not at all useful in my cakes. It was VERY sticky, and I had to work it a LONG time to get it to the point it could be rolled. Second, it was full of bubbles, which once rolled out, made the fonand rough looking, and with bubbles and holes all through it. Not the crisp, smooth finish I was looking for.

This recipe is so much easier than regular fondant! I took another reviewers advice and made this with marshmallow fluff instead of the marshmallows and butter. This is my making fondant that actually turned out halfway decent. I think it is just one of those things that require practice. Anyway, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the taste. I will definitely add some form of flavoring to it next time. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make again and again!

This is the first time I worked with fondant and it was A LOT easier than I expected.  I found I needed to add about double the amount of icing sugar.  I wish the instructions had mentioned how really to work with the butter...I was a bit confused

I think this recipe needs a little more specific directions. It took me more than one hour just to knead. Im six months pregant, all I had was a whisk and I got it done. So, for the most part, it is very easy and yummy!

The recipe gets five stars even if I only give myself 3 for my fondant skills. I have decorated cakes with buttercream but always thought of fondant as difficult and unforgiving. Not so with this recipe. It was easy to make and with a little practice I'm sure I can churn out something photo worthy.

This recipe is incredibly finicky and not good to attempt if patience level is low. It really is easy & cheap to put the ingredients together, but that's where it stops. You have to seriously butter/grease your hands to keep this from coating your fingers like gloves. The next day, after refridgeration, use lots and lots of powdered sugar when you roll it out or it sticks & tears again. If you can get past all that, you will have a nice fondant to use. The taste is okay, not too sweet, and it holds up really well once decorated. If you're set on using marshmallow fondant this is as good a recipe as any. If not, keep looking

Great taste! This takes a lot of arm strength if you don't have a stand mixer. I used the butter instead of Crisco, for the taste and it made it nice and smooth. I did have to add about a 1/4 cup more of powdered sugar.

Ive used this recipe before. I cut the recipe in half, and used 8 oz. of marshmellow.  (I couldn't find a 16 oz bag, all I found was a 10.5 oz bag.) added 1lb of powder sugar + I put some on the counter so it wouldn't stick. Buttered my hands with spray butter and worked in some more powder sugar until I found the right consistancy. Turned out great. Using a dough cutter, helped to scrape up the fondant from the counter when it got sticky. Will use this recipe again.

Hmm... On the plus side, this fondant is yummier than the fondants that I'm used to. But the dough was super sticky and despite buttering my hands I had to tweak the recipe a whole lot to get it to do anything besides stick to my fingers and my working surface. Even then my cake ended up with a few noticeable imperfections, although it was just a cake I made for fun so I'm not too fussed over it. I can't honestly say I'll use this exact recipe again, but because it tastes great it's a good base to experiment with my own fondants!

This recipe was not to my liking. the making of the fondant was easy and the coloring was easy, but the finished product was not good. the fondant wouldnt roll out at all and when it did it got all sticky again and wouldnt peel off the counter. the recipe also did not yield the amount it said it would it was less than half

I followed the directions and it came out great!!! I added the color to the melted marshmallows like some reviewers suggested and had to use a little more sugar when I was kneading. Other than that great!! I will definitely try again!!!

This was my first time making fondant.  After reading all the reviews, I figured enough people had said that it was easy enough for a first-timer that I couldn't go wrong.  It was SO intimdating at first.  I had to zap it in the microwave more than the directions said. I did about 5-30 second intervals and stirred in between.  I did go with the suggestion of tinting it before adding the sugar and that worked perfectly.  I was having a hard time figuring out how to get a good color when you're using multiple colors, but just making a white bath and then tinting small sections made it easier to knead the color in.  WOW! It's MESSY and STICKY.  My poor kitchen.  When I turned the sticky mess out onto the counter I was VERY nervous, but the crisco (as recommended by others) worked WONDERS.  Just keep adding the powdered sugar and you'll do just fine.  When you think you're adding too much just keep adding, it's not like a pie crust.  The less sticky the easier it will be to work with.  Not sure you could make figurines with it as it tends to melt a little bit, but to ice a cake or make "pictures" with it... it's perfect. All-in-all it's a great recipe and it tastes good too... Oh instead of vanilla I used almond extract.  Yummy!  I made an owl for my daughter's first birthday cake and will be making a front loader for my son's 3rd birthday in two weeks.  What a fun new project!

I was totally worried about making this, but I was reassured by reading the reviews of this recipe. I was confused a bit about the shortening (you just put it on your hands? why does it say 1/4 cup?) but I realized quickly that it would take quite a few repeats at slathering on your palms with crisco to work in all the powdered sugar. I didn't use all of it, but most. I had high aspirations of making a cake in the shape of numbers, but luckily I attempted to do that a few days before I needed the cake. A bit more practice, and I will probably be there, but not yet. So, instead, I opted to make a small cake (for candles) and the rest of my batter for cupcakes. I don't suppose I could be happier with the result. Thanks, Kiele!

I was not sure I was ready to make my own Fondant but it was very easy! I have done it many times now. I use Fluff as many other people did. And I freeze it for a few min while I clean up the mess.. Then its ready to go. I use the mixing blade on my kitchen aid to mix it then use the bread hook to beat it. Make sure you crisco it very well first! And clean up the mess as soon as you take it out of the bowl! It will harden on!!

Excellent fondant!  I made this for my daughter's 4th birthday party cake, and everyone loved it!  It is definitely yummy tasting! I've made this twice now and didnt change the recipe much.  Make sure your hands are covered in butter when kneading the fondant! Very pleased with this fondant and it is a keeper.. my only fondant recipe now!

What a great recipe! It is a little work to roll it out, but not more than any other recipe I have tried. I used another reviewer's suggestion when melting my marshmallows...I just put them in my KA mixing bowl and place them over a pot of boiling water. Then, I just put the bowl on the mixer and mix in the sugar with the dough hook. So easy!

We like this recipe...we use shortening instead of butter...also depending on the humidity in room you might want to use 3 tablespoons instead of 4..it can get really sticky if you us 4.

This is the easiest and fastest way to make great fondant! I've tried to make fondant with lots of recipes and this is the first one that uses the least amount of ingredients but yields the best results! I would recommend this recipe for everyone from beginner to expert!

The consistency was really nice and it looked good on the cake. However, it was super sweet and pretty chewy.

This was my first time using fondant. I used marshmallow cream instead of marshmallows and skipped the water part. I didn't measure the amount of icing sugar. I just kept adding it until I got the right consistency. Tastes great and will definitely experiment with fondant again!

I never attempted making fondant because  of how hard people say it is. This recipe worked beautifully!! I used a small jar of Marshmallow Creme and about a whole bag of powdered sugar. It took less than five minutes to get it to the right consistency. It rolled out really nicely after about 2-3hours in the fridge. Definitely a keeper!

All I can say is, WOW!!!
SO easy and SO good and SO much fun!!
Don't worry if it if hard to work with at first, it will be sticky and difficult to mix at the beginning, but it does get better. I had to use LOTS of icing sugar to keep it from sticking to the counter, but its easy to dust off the fondant after. You have to try it, you CAN do it!!

good basic recipe. i didn't do the butter, i used shortening on my hands instead.  used 1 tsp vanilla but also used 1 tsp butter flavoring and 1/2 tsp lemon extract which is the way i normally make homemade fondant and it really gives this fondant a nice flavor.  didn't refrigerate it.  rolls out nicely and easy to work with.

Yummy!  I definately thought it needed butter to mix in, tasted better that way.  All the kids peeled off the frosting from the cake and only ate that!  Easy and fun messy recipe.  Put the bowl in the sink to do the kneading and kept the mess somewhat at bay.

This worked great for me.  I put it in the freezer for 30 min instead of the overnight thing cause I was in a pinch.  No problems, except that it's way messy to make.  I was happy with the taste, however, my husband didn't seem to care for it as it 'tastes just like a marshmallow.'  But a winner with the kids for sure.

Very good and easy to work with.  Much better than the Rolled Buttercream Fondant on this site (which is greasy and falls apart).  Flavor/texture is like circus peanut candies.

I have NEVER used fondant.  This recipe worked exactly like described and tastes great.  I will note for other novices, that I "over colored" mine.  You might think that you have to go a lot darker to work in the sugar and not be too light, but that isn't necessarily true.  I used gel coloring and ended up with "Smurf" blue instead of swimming pool blue.  Fantastic recipe.

The first time I made this recipe I mixed it in my stand mixer and then kneaded a little by hand... but I mast have not added enought sugar before I decided to try and hand knead it! I felt like one of those old cartoon characters with something stuck to their hand so they use their other hand to get it off... then both hands are stuck, then their feet, then their faces... and so on. Just make sure you add enough sugar before you dig in there with your hands! :) Really yummy and went on the cake smoothy!

The flavor of this is worlds better than any other fondant I have tried to use. It is easy to roll out once you get it to the right consistancy...That was tricky for me. I used three tablespoons water plus some vanilla, but I think next time I will keep the one more tablespoon water. It's dry here, and I had to use a ton of crisco to make this workable the next day.

After swearing off making fondant again ever after a few difficult experiences I decided to give this recipe a chance after reading other reviews.  This was the easiest frosting I've ever made and it turned out WONDERFULLY.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe and I'll use it again and again. I followed other suggestions of using Crisco on my hands and re-warming in the microwave for 12 seconds which both worked like a charm for me.

I loved this fondant!!! I don't think I could ever go back to buttercream after using this recipe. It was yummy and not too hard to make. I ended up kneading it using the kneading attatchment on my KitchenAid mixer. I made 3 batches; the first batch I kneaded the dough by hand and the last 2 I kneaded it using my mixer. Let me tell you...the last 2 were much better!! It's definitely worth it to just get out your KitchenAid and it saves you some hard work!!! It was my first time making and using fondant! It was great; it wasn't as hard as I thought it'd be :-)

I give this recipe 4 stars because it uses butter instead of vegetable shortening. I always add food coloring before the sugar to avoid texture and color issues. I grease my work area with shortening before kneading this as well to avoid sticking and then refrigerate for a few hours for best results later, but I've used it immediately too. If you want this to harden, and I do mean hard, you can also add a couple tablespoons of dried egg white powder. I do this with small amounts when making decorations like flowers and pearls. I make cakes custom ordered for friends and others, everything from birthdays to weddings and I have only once or twice used regular fondant. MMF is so much better tasting and in my opinion, easier to work with.

it was easy UNTIL i had to start using my hands! TAKE OFF RINGS! this is sooooo sticky until you add enough powdered sugar to make it like a dough. i couldnt even get the bag of powdered sugar and had to wait til someone came to the kitchen to help me. KEEP the bag NEXT TO YOU. i needed far more than the recipe said. but in the end, it was worth it. i didnt color it, but i imagine it would be easier to color it in the earlier stages rather than trying to mix it once its made. it covered 2 (side by side) large rectangular cakes. and i have extra. the only other part that was hard was rolling it out. i needed it big, and it was rather stiff. when i got it as big as i wanted it, it was still kinda thick, but thats no big deal. IF YOU ARE MAKING FIGURES, keep the powdered sugar by you. as it gets warmer it gets stickier. so sugar on the table and your hands, makes it much easier!  OH! when the recipe calls for 1/4 cup of butter--IT DID NOT HELP ME. its for buttering up your hands...i would consider trying something else to grease your hands. or just using powdered sugar.  i also wanted to mention that it keeps the cake nice and moist longer than just frosting it. (which makes sense) we didnt eat the cake for quite a few days after i made it, and it tasted fresh and moist! i hope this helps! good luck, and its worth it!

NOTE: vodka is better than water to get the powdered sugar off at the end and to make the cake shine. water just makes it sticky. but be sure to brush it THIN.

I make it in the breadmachine!  It does all of the hard work.  I also add 1tsp of glycerine and extra powdered sugar to get a workable texture.

I used this to make a helicopter-shaped cake for my son's second birthday.  It made a nice, smooth surface, although it was a little more stretchy than I'd like.  I'm sure there is a learning curve to it.  My family loved the taste of it, too.

This fondant tastes good and is fairly easy for a beginner to work with. I added cherry flavoring and rolled it pretty thin (mostly because I didn't make enough). It was a hit. I have used store fondant once and it tasted horrible. So if you are trying to decide between making your own and buying it; it is well worth it to make your own so that you don't have to see your guests faces sour when they bite into the store bought stuff. Also, I rolled it out between parchment paper and it got stuck to the paper. I almost lost the whole project. Rolling it out on powdered sugar works much better. You will get the right consistency as you roll more powdered sugar into the fondant. I also suggest getting a fondant smoother. I was able to remove most of the imperfections from the frosting underneath not being perfectly smooth.

I have come to the conclusion that Fondant does not taste really good like frosting...however it makes one heck of a cool looking cake.  So make sure you use whatever frosting you really like underneath the fondant.  I did the marshmallow fluff...and it worked like a dream.  So much easier than "real" fondant, and just as pretty.

This recipe is very easy to make.  The ingredients are simple and it makes a lot of fondant to work with.  It also tastes great!    I used homemade vanilla extract in one batch and Triple Sec in another for a hint of orange flavor.  I also had no problem substituting some of the confectioner's sugar for cocoa powder in a batch for chocolate MM fondant.  It tasted similar to Tootsie Rolls.

I LOVE THIS STUFF! So easy to make, tastes great, easy to work with. My only change was using shortening instead of butter and no vanilla (I didn't think it was missed at all). I will definately be using this recipe on all my fondant cakes. Thanks!

This was my first time ever using fondant. I will forever use this recipe. I ran out of confectioner's sugar and dusted my counter with cornstarch. Seemed the more cornstarch I used the easier it was to handle and color. I used an iron and steamed the fondant to make it shiny after I was done. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!!

This was the second time I have ever made fondant and I loved it! This is the only fondant I will ever use. It is so easy and the taste is good too! I put a thin layer of frosting under it (thicker than a crumb layer but thinner than regular) and it was great! My only problem now it getting the fondant flat on the edges of a square surface! Any suggestions? :)

I followed the recipe exactly and made this for my daughter's birthday.  It was pretty hard to roll out, even after letting get to room temperature, and the taste was blah.  Every person at the party peeled it off of their piece of cake and left it on their plate.  However, I refrained from giving it one star, as it is edible, just not good tasting.

Used marsh mellow fluff and skipped first couple steps. A little difficult to knead in color, but otherwise fine. I will make it again

Wonderful recipe! It took a lot of work to get it kneaded enough, but definitely worth it. Also, I tried just using the butter and after scraping the fondant off my hands forever I tried the Crisco idea mentioned by a few other reviews... this worked perfectly and I had no other problems with stickiness. Great flavor and was a fun project to do with my daughter. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

This was so much better than the traditional fondant!  It was very sweet, but isn't that what icing is supposed to be anyway?  I added maple flavoring to it and it really perked it up and made it much more interesting!  My advice would be to let the fondant cool before kneading it.  It's VERY sticky otherwise!

This is my first attempt at fondant. All things considered,I think it went very well. I followed the highly rated review using a jar of marshmallow fluff. My fondant covered a Barbie cake for my daughter's birthday. She was tickled pink.

First time ever making fondant, really easy to use and I liked the vanilla taste the marshmallows give. Big hit at my son's party!
I made a half batch for ghost cupcakes, 1 250 g bag mini marshmallows and 6 cups icing sugar needed.

first time making it and I love how easy it is. I haven't used it yet but will have to do an update tomorrow. *update* huge success! sweet but not to sweet like regular fondant.  some advice when rolling it out (which took longer than stated, more like 30 min) sounds crazy but learned it in cake decorating through culinary... get a sock, put conf. sugar in it once done tie close. tap on counter for a thin even layer every time. between rolling it out continue to tap on counter and even on hands and fondant. helps with the sticking and you won't be wasteful. once you do this you will never go back to dusting counter tops by sprinkling flour/ sugar out.

Amazing! This fondant melted in my mouth when I sampled it. I prepared this for my boyfriend's little sister for her 2-year-old birthday and I only wish she had the vocabulary to marvel at this as much as I did. This is very useful for sculpting little figures, as well. I only skipped the butter and just coated my hands with sugar. I probably used about 4 cups of sugar to mix in (plus a bit more while kneading). Thank you so much!

LOVE IT!  I laughed almost the entire time. It got really eewy-gooey and had to return to the mixer for more Confectioners Sugar.  Took me a while to get the consistancy right but once I did, that was it. Great taste and easy to color, roll and cut. Comes back to room temp fairly quickly too.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This is fantastically easy to make! I haven't ready all the reviews but what I do is take the melted mixture and transfer it into a mixing bowl. I use the dough paddle and let the mixer do the kneading while adding the sugar. Once it forms into a ball, I knead by hand for a couple of minutes and then wrap and refrigerate. When rolling the fondant out, I greased my surface with shortening rather than dust with sugar.

This was my first time using fondant and this was FUN!! The only things I did differently were I used cornstarch for rolling it out - the powdered sugar made it stick to the counter. Also, I microwaved for 10 seconds when I took it out and was ready to use it. And I covered the ball of fondant in crisco right out of the microwave when I started using it, to get it soft and slippery. The recipe itself is FIVE stars, but I like my revised directions better! =P And I had no tearing with the Crisco!

I'm a rookie working with fondant, but my first attempt at this recipe was a success! I followed previous recommendations to mix color into melted marshmallows as well as use my KA mixer to do all the hard/dirty work! I only had to do minimal hand kneading to finish it off at the end! Tastes much better than the store-bought stuff I have! Love it!

This was such a wonderful recipe! This was the first time for me to use fondant and I have never made it before. The recipe was very simple and extremely yummy! I just started getting creative with birthday cakes and made this fondant cake for my Mother-in-law's birthday and got soooo many compliments on it.

Wow. If I can make this, I swear anyone can. I used my KA mixer to mix it, then took it out to knead it a couple of times. I covered my hands in crisco and just added the powdered sugar until it quit sticking. Just don't be stupid like me and add food coloring without wearing gloves.. My hands were red for a day or so.. Only I would do something like that. :) I encourage all of you to try this.

This was my first time using fondant and I couldn't believe how easy it was to mold and I thought it tasted pretty good.  It was a little bland/sugary, I think i may try adding flavoring next time.

Turned out better than expected for my 1st time doing it on my own. I'm sure next time it will be better and if you have  a stand mixer you  will be a step ahead...   Thanks for the recipe. I like the face you don't have to cook it an go though all that.

i have made this twice now, and love it! it tastes wonderful and is super easy! the first time around i tried mixing it myself, what was a pain lol but i used my KA mixer the 2nd time and had no problems at all! i used crisco shortening instead of butter, and it makes it shiny and easy to handle... i will use this recipe from now on!

Tried this recipe yesterday and it turned out great! Tastes like bubble gum or chewy cotton candy! I used a 10 oz bag of regular size strawberry marshmallows to make pink fondant. Followed the instructions but eyeballed the ingredients - ended up using a little over a pound of icing sugar. Greased everything it would touch with butter, and had no problems with it being sticky. Used the KitchenAid stand mixer & dough hook, but I had tiny lumps of crystallized sugar in the fondant, so I had to take them out by hand. Think I might have microwaved it too long or added the sugar  before it had cooled, which I also forgot to sift first! Wrapped it up, tossed it in the fridge, & went to the store to get the 16 oz pack of white minis & found that they were easier to melt especially since I put the water into the greased bowl first, then added the MM and microwaved for 30 seconds, then stirred and added the vanilla and butter. Microwaved another 30 secs, then stirred until it was totally melted and smooth. Poured it into the KA bowl, added sifted sugar and used the mixer to mix and knead. When it was done, I scraped the sides of the bowl, greased it again and put the lid on and stored it in the fridge. I'll be adding different colors to small portions of the white fondant for the cake decorations. I'm glad a friend sent me the link to this recipe!

I made this fondant to make cupcake toppers with (in this case, boobies!) I made this recipe without any changes and it turned out awesomely. I haven't tried to use it to cover a cake, but for detail work it's easy to work with and very forgiving! I did add color to the marshmallows when they were warm, but that's just common sense.

This recipe is easy and not too messy. I take away a star because no matter how much confectioners sugar I used - the fondant was just too sticky. I ended up running out to the store to buy fondant, which was much easier to work with, but a lot less tasty...

I felt this was just OK as far as taste and ease! After the fact, I saw reviewers post how to put the dye into the hot marshmallow, which I didn't do.  It doesn't look as pretty as Kiele's does. Either way, I will definitely do it again, but following the recipe to a T didn't produce a great product.  Take the top reviewers suggestions to make it much better!  UPDATE:  Thanks HOLLY but she made beautiful cakes with pictures posted using this fondant.

I made my first fondant this weekend and this recipe was great.  I was terrified I was in way over my head and it came out perfect.  I didn't end up using all of the sugar...I thought it became very dry.    If you are going to make things like flowers, etc. you will want to let the fondant sit a few hours first, then form the shapes and let them harden for a good 2 days before putting them on the cake.    Super easy recipe for a beginner and everyone actually thought it tasted pretty good too!

This is very yummy and neat to work with once you get it stable. I kept thinking I was doing it wrong until it finally stopped sticking! Requires a lot of work if you don't have one of those KA mixers. Will use again when I want to create a masterpiece!

I used shorting instead of butter. Very easy to make and taste better than store bought. I didn't really use up the 2 pounds. Had about box 1/2 left. Fondant worked out great!

I don't know if I had problems with this because I used a mixer or what but it was impossible for me to roll this out to cover the cake... I had to use a lot of extra powdered sugar.  It worked great to make details and mold things with a lot of powdered sugar on the hands and work surface though.  I will try this again, but next time I won't use the mixer and see if that works.

I never made fondant before and this was so easy! The results were great! I took the advice from some other reviewers and use vodka to adhere the stars to the fondant. Worked great. I will use this recipe again, and again.

I am not a baker, but wanted to make a "steak cake" for my bf's 30th surprise party. This recipe was easy to follow and not too intimidating! I just used half the recipe, a hand mixer (with bread dough attachments) and tons of crisco on my hands, the bowl, the counter; basically everything the marshmallow was going to touch. I put it in the fridge overnight and had no trouble rolling it out the next evening. I was just using it as an offwhite, so the slight beige resulting from the vanilla was perfect.

This is fondant is the best thus far.  The only thing I did which was different was that I coated my mixing bowl and the dough hook with shortening and then poured the melted marshmallow in there the added the sugar a cup at a time.  So much less mess. Mixed it for a further 10 min after all sugar was added.  Turned in to a shortening suface and also coated my hands added about a cup of sugar again to make it non sticky remember to continue using the shortening on your hands.  Tasty.  Will do again and again.

AWESOME and affordable!!  Definitly use butter or shortening on your hands.  It was a crazy mess when I missed that step, much better once I applied it!  I mixed the color in the water.  I used it right away and then some more that had been in the frig.  Great stuff!!

This has got to be one of the easiest, and better tasting Fondant recipes I've EVER tried! I absolutely loved it, and so did everyone else who tried it :)   The butter didn't do much for me, as I had to keep putting some on my hands. I might try out the Vegetable shortening that Jen mentioned in her review.   Try it! WAY better than store bought Fondant, and you get alot more for your money :)

I subbed in vegetable shortening instead of butter. I've also made this on the "dough" setting on my breadmaker. I used shortening to grease the pan and paddles but it really does make the process a lot easier.

I need Help with this recipe. I follow the Instructions and when its time to decor the cake, the fondant always brakes. I've done this recipe 3 times and I must be doing something wrong.. And I have a big project for someone's Bday and I don't want to disappoint them or be ridicule.  I love this recipe.

I have been procrastinating for years. Had I known it was this easy to make fondant, we'll, let's just say I'm kicking myself.
     I needed small batches of fondant in 7 different colors, so I had to break down the recipe a little and I shaved off some kneading time, which is nice.
     To get 1 disk of fondant, approximately 1/2 cup in size, I did the following...
     In a microwaveable 1 qt bowl, microwave 1 cup of mini Marshmallows for exactly 30 seconds. Stir until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add 1 1/4 top water, 1/8 top clear vanilla extract, food coloring gel. Stir until it gets difficult to stir, then grease your hands with Crisco and, using hands, scrape out dough onto Powdered sugar-dusted counter. Knead dough about 2-3 minutes until smooth and glossy, reapplying Crisco to hands as needed, and generously  dusting counter with more PS as needed.
      Form into disc and seal in small plastic zip-top bag. Chill in fridge overnight.
     I am giving the recipe, as written, 5 stars. Fabulous. 
     The recipe, with my revisions, is also worth 5 stars! 
      Hope this helps. Happy baking!

What a great recipe. My first attempt was successful. I hate regular fondant but this one is great. If you like marshmallow this is the recipe. It was also fun to work with. Take out some cookie cutters and decorate.

If like me, you take on this recipe to find that it's a dismal failure because it's dry and doesn't take the confectioner's sugar well... don't lose all hope because it can be saved! If you find that you're kneading the fondant and it's completely the opposite of sticky, and it doesn't take the sugar well, don't add more water, or continue kneading in the hope it will take (like I did). Instead, put the whole thing back in the microwave for 30 second increments until the dough is warm to the touch and can be kneaded into a pliable fondant. In the UK, most marshmallow is a mix of white and pink... this makes the fondant pink (the confectioners sugar doesn't 'whiten' it). I added green and blue at the kneading stage and it took the colours beautifully, so using pink marshmallow wasn't an issue. When it works, it's a wonderful fondant. It wasn't as smooth to make (for me) as most of the reviews led me to believe. Having said this, I'll be trying this recipe again. Edit: when it came to using it the next day, the fondant had dried hard and wasn't workable when it was brought back to room temperature. I put the fondant in the microwave at 30 sec intervals to warm it up which worked well.

SOOOOO easy and quick!  If you're new to fondant THIS is your recipe.  Other fondants can be hard and chalky, this tastes like candy!  It's easy to manipulate when it's ready and big enough recipe to break it up for several different colors.

This is VERY easy.  First time I've ever tried Fondant and I was very anxious about it before finally braving it.  This by far was nothing to be anxious over, it was a breeze.

LOVE this stuff!  Super-easy to make, and so easy to work with.
I've purchased fondant once, and rue that day :)
By the time I softened the store fondant, kneaded in the colour, and filled all the horrible cracks - it was an ugly mess and I was a hot mess! 
The marshmallow fondant is easy to colour, easy to roll, and you can get it quite thin in order to cover a cake without having too thick a sugary layer.  All my guests rave about the taste of this, as they usually peel off & throw out the other fondant...this one they eat & love.

I don't have a KA yet and it burned my very good mixer up! So, the last have of mixing was by hand and pretty rough! BUT, the end product looked good and tastes really yummy! I normally use Fondarific, and the flavored is very good along with being easy to work with. This is much more economical and it's nice to say "Yep, I made that!" Thanks for a great recipe and all the comments that allowed me to tweak it! Now, off to buy a KA!.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too sweet and it got all over my kitchen. It even got in my hair. It was way too sticky and I will never try to make my own fondant again. It's a shame too because I was looking forward to decorating my own cakes like the professionals.

This recipe came out great. I melted the marshmallows although I heard of others using marshmallow puff. I wanted to make this recipe as organic, so I used Pete ' s Gourmet Marshmallows.  The melted wonderfully and the the treats were delicious! For those of you that want to try a different kind of marshmallow, here's where I ordered mine. Petesgourmet.com

Easiest fondant recipe ever!  To one batch, I added dark chocolate cocoa.  I also used the powdered cocoa instead of powdered sugar for kneading the dough.  Delicious chocolate fondant. TAT

I love to bake but I have never decorated with fondant or anything other than frosting really!  I decided to try for my kids' birthday cake and tried two other times to make my own with no success. Then I stumbled upon this recipe...what a difference!!  Not only was it easy to make, it didn't stick to the counter and rolling pin, and it didn't dry out or get crumbly like the others did. I was able to easily roll it and transfer to the cake without incident and smoothing it out was a breeze. I will definitely be using this from now on!!

I searched all over the internet to find the easiest fondant recipe. I did not want to pay $2+ a piece for fondant cupcakes for my daughter's first birthday party. This recipe was very easy to make. I used the dough hook on my KitchenAid stand mixer to knead the fondant. It was a very simple process. The only change that I made was using vegetable shortening instead of butter. I recommend adding coloring directly to the melted marshmallow mixture. It was much easier, than trying to knead it in. (I tried it both ways.)My cupcakes came out great for a first timer. Now I'm going to practice more designs. I made my flowers ahead of time, stored them in a plastic container and covered each with wax paper.

This recipe tasted great and worked in the long run, but I'd really suggest having more powdered sugar than what is called for in the recipe on hand. You'll definitely be needing more than 1 cup of powdered sugar to knead the fondant, otherwise it'll be very sticky and messy and take a long time to get to the right consistency.

It tastes amazing, but I kept it in the fridge for 2 nights instead of one and it was okay. I tried rolling it out, but it was rubbery, not hard. We put water on it, then it turned gross. I don't have a stand mixer, but a hand mixer and it still mixed, but not as well because it was so thick, so in the end I used my hands. No matter how much butter on my hands, it would not get off! I am not going to use this recipe again, since it frustrated me so much.

I have always wanted to make and use fondant but until now I had never found a recipe I thought I could handle. I used the fondant to make Snoopy cupcake decorations, this recipe was so quick and easy and really made the cupcake stand out.  Thank you so much I can't wait to make a birthday cake!

This tastes good.  It was a little soft to work with.  It wouldn't be good for sculptures that require more structure.  The fondant you can buy is stiffer and works nice for shaping but it tastes like paper.  I prefer it to taste good if I have to choose between taste and structural quality.

This is the second time I have used this recipe. The first time was for my first time working with fondant and it was easy to work with if you follow the recipe. This time (second) I followed the recipe exactly and it worked out much better than my first time (I added too much powdered sugar). You think it is too sticky but it hardens nicely overnight. I did use Crisco instead of butter and agree it is easier on the cleanup!

I way overdid the powdered sugar because I couldn't get rid of the stickiness. So my fondant was not pliable at all. I let it rest overnight, again, and added some Crisco shortening to make it pliable. Then it was fine! Taste is good but I definitely overdid the powdered sugar and that isn't the recipe's fault.

Amazing! I made this for the first time and followed the recipe to the letter. The one thing I did differently is I used cornstarch to dust my work surface. This was to easy and so much fun to play with. The bonus... This fondant ACTUALLY tastes GOOD unlike the pre-made varieties.

I will never buy pre-made fondant again!!!  I have made this recipe several times since March and it is awesome!  It is not like regular fondant that you use Crisco to roll and that's part of why I like it so much.  I feel its easier to work with and the flavor is way better.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Fantastic Fondant. I make mine using my Kitchenaid, so much easier. Melt the marshmallows and water together, put that into your Kitchenaid bowl with the knead nook, add the vanilla, and then slowly incorporate the powdered sugar. When it is almost fulling incorporated, roll onto a heavy powdered countertop and knead by hand, adding additional sugar until smooth. No Butter Needed! I make at least 1 cake a week using this method and it turns out perfect!

This is a great recipe. I did it yesterday for the first time and it turned out great. I prepared in the morning, put in the fridge and started working with it in the afternoon. First i tried to roll when it was still cold and it didn't work. Then i waited a bit more and it rolled perfectly. Transferring it on a cake worked great even the very first time. This will be my fondant recipe. Thanks a lot.

This is a great recipe, the only thing i was confused about while making it is when do i stop adding sugar because the more i added the more my fondant started to crack. I used only a pound and a half of confectioners sugar because i noticed it started to crack and they say add sugar until its no longer sticky but that is not the case. First time making it and it came out great =]

Awesome recipe! As others have said, easy enough for beginners. Some of the tips that I found helpful are as follows:

Melted my marshmallows over a double boiler in my mixing bowl, added water, but didn't bother with vanilla. Also added my color at this time.

Transferred bowl to stand mixer, added powdered sugar, about 1 pound at a time, and mixed with dough hook, probably a total of 5 minutes.

Turned dough out onto well greased counter, greased my hands, and kneed. This process is very easy, and although it sounds messy, it's actually not because over time most of the crisco gets absorbed into the dough and you just have a film to clean up.....MUCH easier than powdered sugar!!!

I was using this dough for cut outs, I found it easiest to roll onto greased parchment paper and then pull away the extra dough. It is drying now, will probably take a couple of days.....wish me luck that they dry ok and come off of the parchment paper:)

I swapped out the marshmallows for Marshmallow Fluff to make it vegetarian friendly (also left out the water) but it's definitely a good base recipe. Reasonably easy to work with and tastes a LOT better than store bought fondant.

Amazing. No complaints. Easy to work with, colors nicely with gel colors. Paint vodka over top of it once in place and you will get a nice shine.

I have been using a similar recipe, but mine says to crisco the bowl before you place the marshmellows in it...and then microwave.  Also crisco the spoon you will be using.  Dust your surfaces and hands with a 50/50 combination of confectoner's sugar and cornstarch.  And when ever you use this fondant...feel it.  If it feels dry, add a little..and I mean a very tiny amount of crisco.  To handle it use the cornstarch/confectoner's sugar mix...put it in a square of thin linen and gather the edges and tie with a twist tie, use as a dusting bag.

This worked really well for us!  I made two regular size batches.  I cans see how some people had problems with their Kitchen Aid mixers breaking - you have to use the bread kneading hook after you put in a few cups of sugar.  I only kneaded to mix in colors, came out smooth and putty like.

Very easy to work with. Turned out great. I did use my kitchen aid - with the bread hook instead of kneading myself.

I am an experienced cake decorator, but had never used fondant - this is a great recipe after tweaking the directions.  Many thanks to Cassandra for her revised directions for mixing.  I initially tried using my stand mixer and wound up with a sticky mess climbing up the beaters.  Cassandra's instructions to "...pour most of the bag of powdered sugar onto a mat on my table, and make a well in center of it. Then I add the cooled melted marshmallow mixture to the well and begin scooping the powdered sugar up and over the mm mixture with my greased hands. I keep doing this over and over for several minutes until the mm mixture is no longer runny and not as sticky to the touch. Then I begin the kneading process."  This technique was fast and not messy at all.  I did use a very small amount of Crisco on my hands at the beginning.  Thanks for the great recipe - will add almond extract next time.

This was the best recipe! The last time I made fondant, I used someone's suggestion of using marshmallow fluff. It did not work. This time, I followed the recipe. It worked great! I made my son a skylander's cake and he is thrilled with the results. This was easy to make, easy to use. I did use one reviewers suggestion to use cornstarch when rolling it out. That worked great!  For the stone on the portal, I crumpled a brown paper bag and it gave the texture of stone. I will use this again! It was easier than decorating with icing!

What a fabulous recipe.  I love to create, fondant is my new creative for the kids, and I am helping out a family member with making favors that have fondant cut outs.  I thought I would try to make my own... after reading several recipes I almost bailed.  This one seemed great, and the reviews with the tips helped a lot.  I also used FLUFF, 16oz, added food color with the water and clear vanilla, greased the kitchenaid, and all that... it went smoothly.  I will roll out tomorrow and allow the cut outs to sort of dry out. OH YEAH, and it tasted awesome.

This is a great fondant recipe. I used it to make 3 cakes, then I had extra which I used about 2 weeks later, and it was still great. Only problem I ran into was when adding food colour, you need to add a lot more icing sugar. This recipe is easy to make, and holds up well on cakes

so easy!  I was terrified to try making a fondant cake but this was so easy.  I used Crisco and added the food coloring before adding the sugar.  After leaving it in the fridge overnight I did microwave it to get it up to room temperature faster as I was getting impatient.  Now I need to master covering a cake without showing the folds on corners.

I used 1 bag of regular mrshmallows and 2 kg of powdered sugar. I had to grease my hands a lot to knead it, but it worked perfectly after.

This recipe is so easy and super yummy!  I wanted color so I added gel color to the heated marshmallow before adding the sugar.  I will use this recipe forever!

Very easy and turned out amazing!  I used marshmallow creme as suggested by another member and it was so incredible I will be using again.  I would suggest that people use gel food coloring though, as I had a hard time with my liquid food coloring squirting out when I was kneading it in.

Wonderful fondant! Much easier than other recipes I've seen and turned out beautifully. I decorated four mini cakes for a tea party and they were adorable. This fondant really requires a lot of powdered sugar, maybe more than is mentioned. The dough is ready when it it elastic- like and won't stick to your hand.

This recipe tastes amazing, so much better than the store bought stuff. In fact I could have vowed I hated fondant until I made this stuff. I needed a lot more icing sugar than was stated in the recipe. I used full-sized English marhsmallows which are not as flump-like as the American kind so maybe that made a difference.  The great thing is that if you add a bag of pink and white marshmallows it makes a beautiful baby-pink colour fondant and no need for food colouring.

I've never made fondant before. This recipe requires patience and cooking spray! I sprayed my bowl and spoon before melting the marshmallows. Before I kneaded the dough, I added some Wilton's food color and greased my hands with plenty of shortening, and re-greased as needed. This ensured the dough didn't stick to my hands, nor did the food coloring. It took a LOT of kneading. You'll think it's never going to form a dough, but be patient. It will. You may have to adjust the amount of powdered sugar, adding more as necessary. I ended up using a 10.5 oz. bag of marshmallows and almost an entire 2 lb. bag of powdered sugar to get a good doughy consistency. I left the fondant in the fridge overnight and just now rolled out a test strip. It's great! Tastes good and easy to use. My stepdaughter kept telling me fondant is too hard to use and I'd never be able to do it. She felt and tasted this stuff and said it's 100 times better than the fondant her friend's mom used! I plan to use small portions at a time and keep the rest in the fridge until I need it. I think that will make it easier to work with.

Such a pain to make but tastes delicious.  It's not the kind of fondant you immediately peel off your cake because it's tastes bad.  Easy to work with once you get the sugar mixed in.

I made this, but I have a question, I am new to making fondant and this was my first time making any kind whatsoever. I wanted to know if you are supposed to use the whole 2lbs of sugar? It just seemed so hard to keep adding more sugar, and I wasn't sure if you were to just keep mixing it until all the sugar was used. Other than that I think it worked! haha

This was AWFUL! WAAAAAY to sugar-y. I used 2 pounds like the directions said and all it tasted like was powdered sugar, and I didn't taste any marshmallows at all.  I won't be using this again.

So easy to prepare and roll, and much less expensive than traditional fondant. Tastier, too! Will definitely be making again in the very near future.

Read everyone else's comments. They are helpful! 

This was great, pretty easy and turned out great (and I have never done any kind of fondant before). I WILL make it again and send the recipe to friends.

I've been using Marshmallow Fondant for over 5 years. Using the colored marshmallows really adds a great effect with the help of a lil gel food coloring. All my clients and kids Love IT!

I have some lessons-learned.  I am not a baker and my daughter begged for a fondant-covered cake for her birthday so I tried it.  My first batch stuck so bad to the plastic wrap that I had to throw most of it away.  Either spray the plastic with cooking spray, or dump it out of your mixer right onto the kneading surface.  I also sprayed my bowl before I put the marshmallows in it in the microwave, they dumped right into my mixer without sticking at all.  I tried to spray my mixer and beater, but it didn't help.  Also, you can't really make black fondant with the recipe as-is.  After my fondant turned gray with half a container of black color gel, I realized I had to add cocoa powder first to darken it.  I just substituted the cocoa for a cup of the powdered sugar.  It got a bit dry, so I added another tablespoon of water.

This recipe was really easy to work with. Prior to this I had never made/worked with fondat before and I managed to make a really cute cake! It was a little dry and didn't work 100% well for the super details but still easy to work with for a base.

Fool proof. It was perfect! So easy and tastes better than any other fondant out there. I used it to decorate cookies. Doesn't get any easier than this.

I used this recipe for my first shot at fondant. It worked great and even tasted good. I don't normally like the taste of fondant but this recipe produces a much better flavor than I have ever tasted. Thanks for sharing!

First time doing fondant and it was really easy to do!
The only thing I would really advise others is to really have butter or shortening  handy because it is REALLY sticky and you will use it when you are kneading.

This was my first time making fondant and I loved it!  I substituted 1 c. sifted baking cocoa for part of the powdered sugar.  It tasted like a soft tootsie roll.  I made a football cake for my 7 year old son.  I used my meat tenderizer to add some texture to it.  My son loved it!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This worked out beautifully. I found that the four tablespoon was too much water though. Next time I will use 1 1/2 tablespoons water plus the 1 tablespoon vanilla.

I tried this recipe and will make it again. I tried it with the marshmallow fluff. It took some doing but I was finally able to get it on the cake. My customer and her family at the cake. Fondant and all. This one is a keeper. Next time I use my dough hook for my KA.

Tasted just okay. However got dried out extremely quickly and didn't look very good either. If I had to make fondant again I'd use a more traditional recipe.

awesome fondant! extremly easy, and so much better than store bought! will never go back to that now. Even with old stale ones this worked for me. I just used some lard when kneading the fondant and it was no problem.

I love this recipe! I will note that it is not a good idea to use a regular hand mixer for this recipe. As soon as I started to blend the marshmallows and water my hand mixer sucked it right up inside of it. Even at the lowest speed. I opted to grease my hands up with Crisco and mixed the sugar in the marshmallow by hands. It is time consuming but it's way better than the butter-cream recipe and not greasy at all. It tastes much better too! It's a lighter recipe for fondant and pairs better with the cake and frosting. Will definitely use again.

BEST fondant recipe EVER!!!  Easy to work with and tastes great!!!  As other review's have said: Use the vegetable shortening instead of the butter - and Wilton's vanilla flavoring instead of pure extract (if you want to keep it *pure* white).  If you are making this on a humid day, then you can dust your surface (and the fondant) with some corn starch.  Works wonders at keeping the fondant a perfect consistency and not too sticky!

I just made this and found it soooo easy!  It is definitely sticky and you will need more than 2 lbs of powdered sugar.  I think I ended up using 2 1/2 lbs.  But it tastes great!  I've never had fondant before and people have been so negative about the way fondant tastes so I was pleasantly surprised to find out how good this tasted.  Can't wait to apply it to my cake tomorrow!

This is fantastic.  My and my girls, ages 9 and 10, made this tonight. It was our first time trying fondant and we did a pretty good job for beginners.  It looks fantastic, and tastes great.  It is sticky as can be, but that is part of the experience:)

Not sure what I did wrong, but this was not easy for me to do. After much hand kneading- my mixer wanted no parts of this- I got what I thought was a stiff dough with good color. Wrapped it up for a day in the fridge so I could bake the cakes, and let it thaw for 6 hours. I had difficulty rolling it out, and felt it was too thick.  Tried wax paper with confectioners sugar on it and had better luck. Once on the cake, it did look nice, but tasted so sweet I couldn't continue with the amount of work it was taking me.  I had to wipe off the excess sugar too.  Ditched the whole thing, cakes included and started over.  Maybe just my inexperience, or I messed up somewhere, but the taste made me end my journey.  I would have peeled it off and asked for a dollop of regular icing, how could I ask my guests to eat it? Maybe this just wasn't the right recipe for me.  Maybe I just don't like fondant? Not sure, but definitely gave this one an honest effort, and still failed.  Maybe my sweet tooth just isn't sweet enough.  As an aside- the kids did like their sample :)

This recipe is so easy and so good!  I almost gave up at the sticky part but kept kneading and adding sugar until my arms hurt.  It took longer than I thought!  But it will be beautiful and delicious on my cookie favors.  :)

Excellent Recipe! Very easy to make. I opt to use icing sugar rather then butter to prevent sticking. I also used my mixer with the dough hook attachment to knead the fondant. Easy to work with when decorating my cake. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

So simple to make and it turned out great!  The fondant rolled out very smooth and looked fantastic on my cake.  Most fondant recipes I've tried looked pretty, but tasted terrible.  This recipe really surprised me, the marshmallows gave it a very nice flavor.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I made this fondant hopeful that it would be as easy as other said it would, but unfortunately it didn't.  I left it in the fridge over night and when I went to work with it it was just a runny mess.  Perhaps I will try this recipe again sometime, but for now I am going to resort to another recipe and try my luck with that.  I did give it 3 stars because of the wonderful taste!!!

My first experience with fondant. It went surprisingly well, thanks to this recipe. I followed exactly (but halved it). If you are making this and don't have a mixer, no problem. I did it all by hand (in small batches, dyed different colours) and it was fine. I will use this recipe again for my next decorating project.

I have used this many times and it always turns out perfectly! MUCH better than store-bought fondant, also. You will, however, need a bit more than the said amount of powdered sugar .It was overall very pleasing!

I made this yesterday and it came out great, the taste is delicious. I do have to say i had to use more confectioners sugar than what it says in the recipe and also this is not for someone who does not have a mixer (Big dough mixer), mixing this by hand is indeed a work out.

This was my very first attempt at fondant, so I was really pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it was to work with (after the initial blending process).  And in fact, I did not need as much confectioners' sugar as the recipe called for, however, I felt the recipe was very sweet, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I tried it out on a chocolate cake layered with a cherry chip cake.  It was a hit, everyone really enjoyed it!

At the last minute, my sons underwater themed 2nd bithday turned into a Cars themed party. I needed to make the cake in advance and in a rush needed  fondant that was simple, and yummy (I hate the taste of traditional fondant) This was so easy to make, color, roll, and store. Only problems I had was mixing in the food coloring at ne point (my fault, got ahead of myself) and because I stored the cake in the fridge the fondnt was a bit on the chewy side since it hadnt warmed throughly.

I LOVE this recipe. I am an aspiring baker and at first I must say I was a bit intimidated by fondant. But this took a few minutes and *tada* edible playdough! lol I would recommend to anyone. I actually tried the version using marshmallow fluff, for my first try.  I will still try the original as well. Good luck, and happy baking!

Wonderful tastes great made mine with pink strawberry marshmallows (large ones) Very easy and came out great!Did'nt add vanilla because marshmallows were strawberry.I too used my KA stand mixer and sprayed everything with non stick cooking spray very easy cleanup,very easy to use. I will never buy ready made fondant .Didnt refrigerate mine but did let it rest for several hours in plastic wrap.Tooo much fun!

I made this almost to the letter.  I added a little lemon juice to the melted marshmallow mix, and Wilton's White-White.  It came out amazing.  I usually dislike fondant, but I decided to try it because of the reviews.  WE LOVE IT!!!  My husband kept trying to steal the fondant while I was rolling it out for a golden butter cake with raspberry filling.  I used a little lemon icing to make the fondant stick to the cake.  There was plenty left over so I am going to use the rest of it up on my best friend's baby shower cake.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is the baby shower cake I made.  Everyone went nuts eating the fondant "bubbles"

Very good fondant recipe.  Good flavor and less armor-like than other fondants I've had when finished.  As a word of warning, it's very, very sticky until it's been well refrigerated.  I plan to try adding the butter exclusively by buttering my hands repeated next time rather than being in a hurry and trying to knead the butter in quickly but...  No surprise that it's sticky - it is a fondant after all - but make sure you have someone available to answer the phone, hand you tools, etc. as you wouldn't be able to put anything back down if you were interrupted whilst making it!

awesome so much easier than i imagined ! I didnt use butter just the marshmallow creme and sugar, and a pack of jello for color and flavor. I mixed the dye into the marshmallow creme before adding the sugar and it turned out great !

awesome stuff! I made my son's pirate treasure cheat with this. It was easy to work with, a bit messy, but worth the effort! I wanted a brown color so I replaced some powdered sugar with cocoa.

This tasted good.  Tastes like any other fondant I've had.  This was my first time making fondant. Easy ingredients but it was not easy for me to work with.  I kneaded the fondant for like 20 mins and it never became "pliable".  It stayed sticky.  So I added more powdered sugar but couldnt not get it non sticky.  So i just wraped it up and threw it in the fridge thinking that would do the trick.  While it was cold i couldnt work with it.  It became to hard to roll out.  I ended up letting it come to room temp and rolling it out with tons more powdered sugar.  After putting it on my cake I couldnt not dust off the powdered sugar.  Im sure there must be tricks to making this stuff but it didnt work out for me.  I will prolly make it again after more research on how to get it just right.  It was fun to try something new but im definitly no professional ;)

My first time making it - It was very easy (and yes, very sticky - but if you follow the other reviews, use your stand mixer and grease your hands w Crisco - not bad at all) and tasted great.  I got rave reviews for my cake!

Worked great, even for a first-time fondant user. I DID notice I had to use more than 2lbs of powdered sugar-- but I also noticed that a standard size mini-marshmallow bag is only 10.5 ounces, not 16. I used a 16oz bag of larger marshmallows, since I thought I needed the whole 16 ounces; but I added probably 2 to 3 more cups of powdered sugar. Maybe if I went with the standard size mini-marsh bag it would have only taken the 2lbs? Either way, the Nintendo cake (see pic 904, at this point) went over with the boy very well. This will be the fondant I use to delve into the brand new world of cake decorating. Thanks, Kiele!

A lot of powdered sugar will be needed to keep the lump from getting too sticky when you are kneading it...otherwise this is a good recipe.

This recipe was awesome.  I haven't worked with fondant too many times, but this was easy to make, tasted great, and worked well for my cake.  I didn't change anything, but I did find it easier to use the day I made it rather than the next morning.  It also kept well for at least a week.

Awesome - best you are gonna get for home made. Transfer melted marshmallow mix to Kitchen Aid & use dough hook. Start adding icing sugar and you can beat it all in with dough hook. Knead for a few minutes to get proper texture. Very little mess.

This worked out well especially compared to the buttercream fondant that I tried at the same time. I wanted to compare. I will be sticking to this recipe. This has more elasticity that made me feel like I could do more with it. The only advice I would give is not to get too carried away with the powered sugar. I felt that I did a bit and it made it a bit harder to work with.

Awesome!  My first time making fondant, so I did have somewhat of a mess, but I will chalk that up to inexperience. Tasted so good!

Yikes! This took me forever to work with. It was my first time ever using any type of fondant, so I suspect it gets easier with time. Due to others reviews, I tried rolling it out with Crisco and I had a terrible time with it. Others recommended corn starch but I couldn't get it off the fondant. So I ended up using powdered sugar to roll it out, this worked best for me but I don't know how people get all the powdered sugar off. I would recommend this for the taste. Hopefully, it will be a little easier to use next time I make it.

This stuff for my first time was really hard to make. But....compared to other fondants the taste was amazing! Just be prepared to work for it if you aren't use to working with things like this.

I LOVE this recipe! I've tried a more traditional fondant recipe and it was DISASTROUS. This was only my second time making fondant and I finished my first cake with mostly ease. I did have to add additional powdered sugar to get the fondant stiffer but besides that, it worked very well! I'm so happy I found a recipe that was easy to make and work with and didn't make me want to pull out my hair. I did use a lot of crisco on my hands and on my rolling surface in addition to the powdered sugar.

This was really good! It turned out tasty and didn't crack too much! We did have to add nearly a whole bag of confectioners sugar to get the right consistency. We used enough for about 2 dozen cookies and had lots left over. Def make it again!

So easy and tastes so much better than store bought!! I had never made fondant before and a friend who is a professional decorator told me try a marshmallow fondant. It was much easier than I thought it would be. Everyone loved it and said they'd never had a fondant that actually tasted good too.

A bit difficult to make when you don't have a food processor. My electric mixer went into flames making this, so I resorted to using a gallon-size zip-lock bag to finish mixing everything. Overall, this tastes much better than store-bought fondant, though is slightly more difficult to work with.

I will never buy fondant again! Just a tip, if you find your fondant too sticky add more icing sugar, if you find it crack when kneading and a bit of shortening does not help, just melt a few more marshmallows add a little bit icing sugar, then mix it with your original cracked fondant. Add icing sugar as needed to bring it back to a workable consistency.

Awesome recipe. Used it for my daughter's third birthday and unlike my other fondant recipe, people actually ATE this stuff instead of peeling it off and leaving it on the side of the plate! Instead of vanilla I used orange extract and will definitely experiment with other flavours when I make it next. Thank you for the PERFECT fondant recipe!

This was my first time using fondant.  Like others, I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix everything.  The next morning when I was ready to roll it out, I was about ready to throw it in the garbage and scream because it was sticking to everything..wax paper, countertop, rolling pin....once I started using more powdered sugar (and got rid of the waxed paper) everything worked out great.  I was really happy with my overall experience, once I realized to keep using the powdered sugar and I got rave reviews from everybody.

Great recipe, tastes far better than store bought version. Takes some practice (all fondant does though) and I don't recommend trying it without a silicone mat for rolling.

Wow, I have never worked with fondant before, but I have to say this was fairly easy. I decided to melt the marshmallows in a double boiler added the water and  vanilla just as they started to get gooey, and then just added the sugar direct to the hot pan and marshmallows. If you are using food coloring I would suggest making a batch of white first so you can understand the consistency before making food colored batches. The more liquid added the more sugar needed. The hints about adding color to the melted marshmallows rather then kneading it in were great. Also, Crisco THICK on the table with powdered sugar keeps it from sticking when rolling out and lets you get it on the cake very easily.

my first fondant experience was a positive one. I used another lazy persons suggestion and used my metal KA bowl as a double boiler so I wouldn't have to wash two sticky pans. I didn't even need to use crisco or butter just a little powdered sugar to prevent sticking to the counter.

LOVED IT. I used it to cover a cake I made using the Birthday Cake recipe and it was great!!! What I particularly liked about it is that it is not as sweet as original fondant icing and much cheaper. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was grrrreat! I'm supposda say frugal but I'll be the first to say I'm CHEAP! My sister wanted me to help make my niece's birthday cake and wanted me to bring the fondant. Ha! I one upped her. Found this recipe- that used everything that I already had in my kitchen...and better than that I had marshmallow fluff to boot! I did what another user suggested and refrigerated the fluff overnight (2-7oz containers), sprayed the Kitchenaide bowl, used hook attachment, threw in fluff, I wasn't thinking and threw in whole 2 LB bag of powdered sugar instead of adding a bit at a time, not a problem with a lot of pulsing it pulled together nicely, removed from bowl, kneaded a bit, then rolled out! Might even sound worse than it actually was. Everyone loved the taste. I guess I would describe it kinda circus peanut like. Colored well and went on great! We will do this again and we will try on cookies. Also- with fluff we didn't add water and we omitted the vanilla- don't think we needed it. So pretty good for first attempt as we decorated cake pretty simply, will be more detailed and use some creativity next time. You cannot go wrong with this. believe me!

I used this recipe for my son's birthday cake this weekend.  It turned out wonderfully!  I just wish I had read the comments to add coloring BEFORE adding the sugar.  I was kneading the black icing forever, so it got a little dry.  Much to my suprise, I still had no problems with cracking!  Oh, and it also tasted great.  Thanks!

So easy, so much tastier than any other fondant recipe.  I had used the rolled buttercream fondant from allrecipes b/c I preferred the taste to regular fondant.  However, it was so greasy (and tempermental) to work with.  This recipe tastes as good, if not better.  Almost like vanilla-y salt water taffy??  If you like your colors to look less marbeled, add your paste colors before you add the powdered sugar.  Easiest if you are only making 1 color of fondant.  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!!!

This was my first try with fondant. This recipe was easy and worked perfectly.  I refrigerated for 3-4 hours, then let it come back up to room temperature.  It rolled well and didn't stick to my Wilton fondant mat as long as I repositioned it after each roll.    The kids actually ate their fondant.  I thought it was a bit too much to eat it all, but it was easy enough to work around.

The fondant was super easy to make! The only question I have is- Is it suppose to be insanely super sweet or does the sweetness kind of mellow out overnight? Right now the only thing I can taste is confectioner's sugar, like I'm eating it straight off the spoon. :) Other than that, found no problems.

I finally got the courage to try it.  And I was so glad that I did.  It was a lot easier than I could have imagined, especially as I have never done fondant of any kind before.  I followed the advice of others and saturated my hands (including my wrists!) in Crisco before kneading and this worked really well.  My daughter was thrilled and I overheard people saying that I got someone to do the cake for me - no higher compliment than that!!

AWESOME!!  Never thought I would have so much fun making a cake!  It was so easy to make and easy to work with.  I did not use butter, though.  I put the blended marshmallows, water and vanilla (I used clear) on top of 2 lbs of 10x sugar in my kitchenaid, mixed it as well as I could, then covered my kitchen island with seran wrap, grabbed a handfull of shortening and rubbed it all over the counter and hands, dumped the mixture on top of the island and worked it with my hands till completely smooth (it seemed to help letting it sit and dry up a little while i prepped the island).  Was only sticky for a short time.  The shortening left it smooth and moist enough so it didn't crack when rolled out.  I did wet my hands once or twice when I feared it was a little too dry and that seemed to do the trick.  Everyone went CRAZY over the cake...I did Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.  I used styrofoam for the house and head, paper towel rolls cut up for tubing, and rice crispy treats shaped into the slide and the foot.  I'll see if I can post a picture.  I did cheat and used one of my daughters Mickey dress up gloves so I didn't have to shape one out of rice crispy treats (thought it would be too top heavy).

This is great stuff!  I've been using it for a while now, and love it!  It take a bit of work to get to the right consistancy, but you'll have firmer biceps by the end of it which is a bonus!  Make sure you don't use too much icing sugar or it will get too dry.  I also find I prefer to flavour my MMF with a bit of coconut extract.  It tastes delicious!

This came out great, the only thing I'd recommend is to start with 2 TBSP of water and add more if needed.  Mine was quite sticky (probably due to the humidity) and I had to add quite a bit more powdered sugar.  Still came out great, my first time using fondant of any kind and I'll definitely use it again!

I made this in my kitchen aid with the dough hook and it mixed and turned out great. I never used it as I hate fondant and was going to try to get past it but if you enjoy fondant this is the one. Thanx for sharing.

Fantastic for molding characters on birthday cakes and cupcakes.  It's a really easy playdough like dough to use and color and play with that the kids can actually take a bite of.  It is sickeningly sweet and thus wouldn't recommend letting them eat very much.

I used this recipe to cover a 3 tier birthday cake and it worked wonderfully. A warning about mixing though, the fondant gets very thick, it actually burnt out the motor of my mixer even before the last cup of sugar had been added. So unless you have a super powered mixer I would recommend mixing a lot by hand. Also, when rolling it out the dough stuck to the surface when using icing sugar alone, so I greased the surface with butter and then covered with icing sugar and that worked just fine.

Was very nervous about making fondant, as this is my very first time.  It came together so easily and beautifully, tastes great too!  It is now resting in my fridge until tomorrow when I'll cover my first fondant cake.  I am so excited.  Thanks Kiele for a great recipe!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  Just made a turtle cake and it came out amazing.  Crisco and the warmth of your hands are the answer at the end to smooth it out.  Again, Great and easy recipe, you will be amazed at what you can do!!!!

Have used this recipe twice now. Followed the first time and then used cornstarch to dust on the counter the second time and had a lot less sticking. Thanks for the recipe. I love to make cakes for friends and they love the professional look of fondant!

My first  time making fondant so I was quite nervous, I have never even eaten fondant before.  It was a big success.  My creations looked store bought.  I though I messed it up because it was so sticky,soft and floppy, but nothing a little icing sugar couldn't solve.  My go to fondant recipe from now on, thanks!

I looked around to find a recipe without crisco (don't like using such products), this one was it.If you want to add coloring to it.spread butter on a small part of the counter to knead it in (instead of powdered sugar, because it will just dilute your coloring--found out the hard way while coloring it black for my son's batman themed cake).

This is the best recipe, and it works so great.  My husband wanted to know how did I do this, and usually he just eats and don't ask questions.  One thing I would do different is mix the color in the mixer, it didn't work very well trying to mix it my hand.  This is a keeper.. Thank you..

Yes, this was a sticky mess to start with, but once I got kneading, it was easy!  And super fun!  The fondant had a beautiful, soft texture, not stiff like the stuff you can buy.  I only rolled mine out (the next day) to cover the cake, but I'd like to make it again and shape some fun details out of it.  It did taste pretty good too.

I have been decorating cakes for family & friends for 55 years and have always wanted to try fondant. Finally tried & loved this recipe. Very easy. We did leave some of the fondant on our plates as it is very sweet but makes a beautiful cake even on first try. Recipe is in my file for  future use!

I love this recipe, the best fondant I have tasted. It is very easy to make and easy to work with. I find you have to add more confectioner's sugar as it can get a bit soft.

I've made this fondant several times and it is excellent to work with. As long as you make sure to grease your hands properly before working with it, color will work into it easily. I am still getting the hang of covering a cake with fondant. Depending on the thickness of your fondant for a particular decoration and the time you let it "dry", this fondant can become almost candy-like when it is completely dry. I've found people "fighting" over the fondant decorations that I've used, and I've had several people say it is the only fondant they've actually WANTED to eat. You can also easily make this chocolate by simply adding cocoa powder to the powdered sugar as you are adding it to the recipe. Excellent recipe!

Incredibly easy to work with!  Held it's shapes well and tasted great!  I will definitely use this one again.  Also glad to see it took the colors so well.  I separated the main recipe into portions for the colors I needed and then added the colors to it.  I kept it in the fridge for a day and 1/2 and it still worked so nicely.  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making fondant and it turned out really well. The only thing I really suggest is to add your coloring right after you take the marshmallows out of the microwave.

Ok so Im trying out the whole cake making thing. So I tried fondant for the first time. I was pleased with the overall look of the fondant. With practice you could truly make a beautiful cake however I thought it tasted not to my liking. Which the taste might not be the point of fondant im not sure.

Great recipe!  So easy to make (but messy) and looks SO professional.  I made the dough, added the color gel, then wrapped the balls and put them in the freezer for a half hour.  I took them out about a half hour before I used them, and it worked just fine.

I have always wanted to use fondant but have been afraid of it. This is the perfect recipe! Very easy! I followed it exactly & it was wonderful. Keep in mind it takes a little practice getting fondant on a cake perfectly flat. I had a few little tears near the bottom of my round cake so I rolled different colors of fondant into balls & circled the cake with them. It was easy to make cut-outs for the cake too. Thanks!

This was my first time at making fondant and it turned out great! Tasted pretty great too, so much better than the store bought! I did try to add colour to it but it was very wet. I think I used the wrong food colouring, I think I was meant to use a gell (?) colouring not the liquid?!?! Anyhoo, the icing itself was excellent! Will forever use this recipe! You must try!!!!

Perfect! Tastes great, looks great, and wows the crowd! I have used this several times and it always comes out perfectly. I would just make sure you color what you need to be colored while it's still hot and use Crisco to roll out the dough as suggested before. Thanks!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE. I used a container of fluff I placed in the fridge overnight, and omitted any use of butter. Mixed entirely by hand.. was hard but WORTH IT. So tasty! My first fondant experience.. can't wait to do it again!

My first try with fondant... a little tricky but probably easier then other recipes. Definetly put it in the microwave for 5 seconds before rolling or it's almost impossible. I flavoured mine with cocnut extract.

I joined allrecipes just to review this because I was so impressed with the recipe.  I have tried other fondant recipes in the past, but this is by far the best!  I used it for shaping characters for a cake and they were perfect - too beautiful to eat, in my opinion, but the little boys at the birthday party felt differently and they were devoured.  Very sweet, so maybe I should have added a titch more vanilla to offset the sugar, but I loved it and I will definitely use this as my fondant recipe in the future.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was phenomenally easy and tasty.  Didn't make as much as I thought but it was a heck of a lot easier than some of the reviews said it was.  I don't have a microwave and so I used the stovetop (It turns the marshmallows a bit toasty-coloured, but works quite well.  Just make sure you put butter in the bottom of the pot before you start to melt them or they'll burn and stick.)

This tasted really good. I used butter vanilla oil as flavoring. A pain to knead (my mixer is broken so I had to knead) but well worth the effort. Confectioner's sugar also worked better for me (as some other reviewers have mentioned) than butter. Also couldn't find mini mm's so I had to use the big ones ( they took long to melt but I kept at it, checking every 30 secs).  I've had very little experience with cake decorating let alone fondant making but the cake (chocolate which I covered with Creamy Frosting) looked as close to professional-looking than any of the cakes I've decorated.  The Youtube tutorials I watched also helped. Will use this again and again. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!! By the way, I didn't wait overnight to use it, only 2 hours.

This worked perfectly and looked spectacular but IMO it was way too sweet - it is basically pure sugar.  I think I prefer the standard fondant (which I understand is also a bit easier to work with once it's rolled out).

LOVED IT!!!!! its a great, versatile fondant that starts off white so you can color it to be as light or dark as you want. I followed a review and added the color when the marshmallows were melted and it works better to add a small amount of sugar then knead in the rest. It helps a huge amount to put quite a bit of crisco on your counter before you knead it. Thank you so much, my cake wouldnt have been the same!!!

Just made this for the first time. A loyal buyer of commercial fondant, I was skeptical.  Very easy to make. I found that using my stand mixer was made this so easy. I used the paddle attachment and it mixed perfectly. When I kneaded the fondant, I kept my hands greased in crisco and it came out shiny and smooth, just like store bought.  I will definitely make again!

Patience is what you need and it will pay off. It is sticky, but it gets better the more you work with it. My son kept eating it so you know it even tasted good. This was my first attempt at fondant, I will be making it again.

I have to say it is really easy and tastes better than the other Rolled fondant recipe in this site. Both are easy but the marshmallow fondant is quicker and it has the fluffy texture and it tastes like marshmallow. The only twist just bit more vanilla and mixed with wood spoon and then knead for maybe 8 min and ready....

This was my first time making this. I used the fluff to cut some time. I mixed this in my KA mixer and it was struggling a bit! Very sticky! I think I kneaded the fondant to much where it came out a bit transparent. Next time, I won't! I was worried that this will not have much taste, but I kept cutting little slivers off the cake! I made a "Hello Kitty" cake for my daughter 3rd birthday. This recipe is a keeper!

This worked out great for me.  I used only 3 T. of water and Crisco instead of butter.  I made it several days ahead, kept it in the fridge, and despite letting it come to room temp, I did have the most success with microwaving it for a few seconds before rolling it out.  Taste was actually good...and I'm not a fondant fan.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Although this didn't give me a pure white fondant like the rolled fondant recipe (it was a little "off"), it was *so* easy to use that this is now my favorite of the three fondant recipes I've tried.  There was no ripping, no tearing, and the fondant accepted color very easily.  It was easy to roll out with a little cornstarch underneath, and didn't taste overly sweet.  *Excellent* recipe!

This was the first fondant I've ever made and ultimately was successful, but not by following the recipe as written. Initially, I attempted to follow the recipe to the letter (trying to force in nearly all of the confectioner's sugar) but this resulted in such a still ball of fondant that I could barely knead it and gave up trying to soften it up by adding water (Note, I couldn't find a 16 oz bag of mini marshmallows--I think 10.5 oz seems to be the standard size around here), so that's the cause, I'm sure!  My second attempt was much better. I used the 10.5 oz bag of mini marshmallows, heating gradually until smooth, with the water. I began by stirring in confectioner's sugar until the mass in the bowl was too difficult to stir. I then transferred the contents of the bowl to my counter, which was greased with Crisco and covered with powdered sugar. I kneaded more sugar in just until the fondant was no longer sticky, coated with a layer of Crisco, wrapped well. I couldn't wait to try it, so I rolled it out a couple of hours later, using powdered sugar and cornstarch on the counter and corn starch on my (regular) rolling pin. I was very pleased with how easy the fondant was to work with! My little sample cake looked great. Can't wait to use it soon on a birthday cake!   As far as taste, it's far too sweet for me, but a thin layer over frosting isn't too much.

I've tried fondant twice before and decided I would try this one. Finally! Success! This was so easy to put together and to work with. I was amazed! The taste was good too. I will definitely be experimenting with this recipe more in the future. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I used more sugar than the recipe called for. It turned out beautiful. Insanely sweet, but easy to use after refrigerating. I followed another review and omitted the butter, I probably would have needed way more sugar then.

I give this recipe a 5 for flavor, but a 3 for ease... NOT exactly easy for someone with no fondant experience.  I'll probably make it again, but not for awhile!    I had a lot of trouble with the fondant sticking to my counter and should have followed another reader's advice about "greasing" the counter, instead of using powdered sugar.  I'll do that next time!  I would advise anyone who makes this to make sure you have LOTS of counter space!   Oh, and DO NOT roll it too thin!

This was VERY east to make!  But for me, it was just too sweet.  If you're looking for an easy fondant and have a big sweet tooth, then you've found it!  I'll definitely use this recipe in the future to make decorative flowers and such though!

Fondant is expensive and not great tasting all the time.  I was very insterested in all the rave review from this one.  So I tired it.  I was kinda nervous because i had never made this and it seemed almost to easy.  Ok so I am a convert. Never again will I buy store bought fondant.  I made mine for less than 3.00.  I couldnt buy that amount for less than 12.00.  It made a ton. I was afraid I would not have enough. No worries. I'm not sure what is covers for cake size.  But two medium size cake where covered with plenty left over.  I'm so glgad I tried it.  I'm so excited.  This is wonderful stuff

Fondant. I like the look of fondant so i tried making for the first time. It wasn't too complicated but i must say it is tough to work with fondant, the kneading isn't that much fun and it does not taste good.It is like an edible plastic.I believe next time I will use this for ornaments on the cake rather than to cover an entire cake.

This was my first time ever making a fondant. I took someone's advice and used Fluff instead of melting the marshmallows and it came out great! I will be doing more experimenting, but I will suggest to add clear vanilla extract. Some people complained about it looking off white or beige, but I bet they used regular vanilla. And use Crisco! sooo easy!

AMAZING!!  this was my first time ever making and using a fondant and it was wonderful.  I can't believe how simple the fondant was to make, how easy it was to colour and use.  I love it!  This is going to be my new adventure in baking from now on.  Love, Love, Love it.  I mixed the colour in with the warm marshmallow mix and then added the icing sugar.  This made the colour very even.  Then for decorating I added some extra colour and didn't mix much before rolling to create a marbled look.  Very awesome.

I followed others reviews by adding Wilton Gel color into the warm marshmallow and then adding everything into the K.A. mixer, mixing with the dough hook.  This was my first time making fondant, and I was a little nervous, but it turned out so fantastic.  If I can make this, anyone can make this.  I love this recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing Kiele.

Much easier to work with the the typical rolled fondant recipes and it was very easy to work in food coloring to the "dough" phase. However, I needed to add way more powdered sugar than called for to get the stickiness down and have it be roll-able. I have seen other marshmallow fondant recipes call for only 2 tbsp of water, so I might try that next time to see if that helps.

This was my first attempt and I really didn't know what to expect. It was fun to make and looked nice. I didn't have any food coloring on hand so it was just white. The final product did not taste good. It had the consistency of rubber. It looked really nice, but we ended up peeling it off the cake when we ate it. I will only make this if I'm trying to impress someone with decoration. Good recipe, and I do recommend it, but not a good frosting to actually eat.

Super easy!  I have never made a fondant before and this was so easy and came out divine!  I did not use a mixer or have to wait until marshmallows cooled.  I put the marshmallows in microwave for about 45 seconds, then stirred them until smooth.  I added in the water, vanilla, and some food coloring.  I mixed it all together with a spatula, and it was so workable!  Then I gradually added the sugar until it wasn't sticky!  So easy!  I am making cupcakes that look like cheeseburgers - this was a simple (tasty) solution to making cheese slices!

I made my first fondant cake using this recipe, and it turned out really well. It took me forever to mix in all the confectioners sugar and get the right consistency, but that could just be the fault of my ancient mixer. I ended up using a whole bottle of liquid food coloring to make it blue, though it still wasn't as dark as I would have liked. But the fondant tasted great and was easy to work with, and my cake received a lot of positive reviews. Thanks!

Good recipe. This was my first use with fondant. I was nervous at first because I didn't think it was ever going to stop being sticky. However it did and my cake turned out pretty good for a first try. Thanks for the recipe! Will use again.

This was my hopeful recipe for my daughter's fourth birthday cake. It did not pull through for me. The fondant was too sweet, like cotton candy(times 10) and not very pretty. It took us forever to make and was a huge mess. I followed other suggestions for coloring and sticking and those were helpful. The end product was brittle and cracking. we added crisco and it was too wet, no matter what we did it was bad. So much for fondant attempt in this house. For how bad it tasted I would have been better off buying it pre made in the store.

I have used this recipe many times and it always turns out great. If I am coloring the fondant I like to use different extracts for a surprising burst of flavor from a normally bland cake covering. I have used lemon,orange and my fav; butter vanilla nut

I used this to make toppers on cupcakes for my friend's bachelorette party and they were a huge hit! They taste fantastic and you can dye it any colour you want, plus it keeps really well in the fridge. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it's SO sticky when you're making it! I probably lost a lot of it to spoons, my hands and my counter top. Is there any way to keep it from being so sticky? This was my first fondant, so maybe I was doing something wrong - less marshmallow, maybe?

I LOVED this recipe!  I did use a bit more powdered sugar when I rolled this out so make sure you have extra on hand.  This was so easy to work with.  I have passed the recipe on to several friends.  Thanks for submitting it!

I had a similar recipe with out the vanilla and this is actually a lot better.  I felt like I was fighting it a lot less to get it to the less sticky point.  It also tastes a lot better with the vanilla. My grocery store only sells 10.5 oz bags of marshmellow so I use 1.5 bags to the 2lbs of sugar and I have enough sugar every time.  I prefer shortning to butter because It has less taste and it protects my hands better. I can't wait until I have a Kitchen Aid Mixer - seems like it would be a million times easier than doing it by hand...

Let me just say that this recipe is AWESOME!!! I was making a cookie bouquet for a charity chinese auction and always wanted to try fondanr but thought it was too hard. This seems indimidating at first but once you chill it overnight it instantly transforms into wonderful, workable dough! Yummy!!! I used pure almond extract! The cookies were a hit! I will use this again for sure!! This will take a basic beginner to another level of baking!

This is a wonderful recipe. However I always need to used way more sugar than it calls for.  I also mix it in a well greased Mixer, That works great!

I had a very hard time with the stickiness and said I would never make this again... but I will!  It turned out awesome on my daughter 1st birthday caterpillar cake!  I used my KA mixer the second time and it was much better.  I added a lot more confectioners sugar to combat the stickiness.  Next time I will slather more butter instead.

This was my first time using fondant and I have to say I was impressed.  It was a little difficult to work with at first but once I got the hang of it, I had no problems.  It tastes much better than other fondants that I have had in the past and it looks great.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thank you!

I love this stuff! A couple of hints- use a stand mixer (like a KA), and mix this using the paddle on a medium speed. You want to add enough powdered sugar to get the mixture to a taffy like consistency. Spray everything w/ Pam- even the plastic wrap you put the fondant in.  I started to knead it after it's well chilled- this is an important step- don't skip the chilling! I greased my hands very well and worked w/ small amounts of fondant at a time. It tastes awesome- really it does! I had 2 children help me cut out the fondant using cutters- a 3 yr old and a 9 yr old- it was easy for them too! I think the key is patience- if it's not ready to roll out, don't try- you'll just have a mess.

Absolutely fabulous! So much better tasting than any pre-made fondant I have ever tasted. If it were possible to rate over a 5 I would definitely do so! What attracted me to this recipe was the ease in making the fondant. I was a little hesitant as lots of easy things don't taste all that great but, my fears were unfounded. This was absolutely a breeze to put together and so much fun to work with! Thank you so much for this awesome recipe. I'll never use store bought fondant again !!

Made this exactly as recommended. Very easy to make and although my mixer quit working in the middle of making this, I finished it beating the mix by hand. It turned out great!

I had a lot of difficulty making this fondant. I’m a first timer to fondant and really didn’t expect. It was super sticky and hard to remove from any sort of surface even with the use of the butter. It was also really hard to work with if it got too warm. Don’t recommend if your a first timer and don’t really know what your doing!

Only change was one teaspoon vanilla and a half teaspoon salt. Took colors well and the red and black remained vibrant. Easy to work with and will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! It is a bit of a pain in the beginning because it is so sticky. You need to use lots of butter on your hands. I keep the entire stick, cut into pieces, near by.  I grab one as needed. I let if melt in my hand then go back into mixing.  It is very easy to work with after it is chilled. Use powered sugar as needed while rolling and decorating.  Once they sit for a bit I brush the excess powered sugar off.

Tip: if the fondant starts to Dry out, butter your hands a little and knead the dough

This made a surprisingly good amount of fondant I worried I might not have enough it it was perfect. I used it for an improv secret Santa party and everyone said “ wow this it great and I don’t taste the chemical that usually come with it” even nigh have to make it for a friends birthday now she loved it so much.

Will definitely make it again. I did half the recipe ans ended up using more powdered sugar and cornstarch till it was a little softer then play-doh. I greased the counter top with Crisco. The butter didn’t work well and caused the fondant to stick a lot. Once the fondant was on the cake I put a little corn starch and powder sugar mix on my hand and rubbed it on the cake to take away the shine. I used the exact recipe. I also didn’t refrigerate it at all and put it straight on the cake. If the fondant gets dry pop it in the microwave for about 5-8 second and it will soften up. Don’t leave it in there long it will liquify!!!

Tastes great! When halving the recipe, though, use the same amount of confectioners sugar as the original recipe! I love fondant plain on its own! I'm eating some right now!

So easy to do! I will never spend $10 on store fondant again! My daughter and I each made a batch. We kept it in the bowl we used to microwave the marshmallows and tore it into smaller batches to help kneed it all together and them combined the smaller sections to one large one. Crisco for your hands and clean up was sooo easy.

This turned out really well, however I realllly struggled with the stickiness. I also did not use the kitchenaid like the video says. This dough is very versatile however and I was able to make a really detailed brain cake with it! We all agreed that it tastes like circus peanuts :)

Fondant that actually tastes good.  Pretty easy to work with.  Took the gel food color well and kept vibrant colors.  It does take a whole lot of powder sugar to knead it nicely. We worked it in half cup chunks to make it easier.

It is definitely hard to work with, but just keep adding sugar. The recipe says you should put butter on your hands but it works a lot better if you use the powdered sugar like flour and put that on your hands as well as your surface. I got a lot of compliments on this and it is easy!

This is so much better than store bought fondant!  I didn’t use as much butter on my hands because I didn’t want the fondant to look shiny.  Followed the recipe and directions exactly.

This is the second fondant recipe I have ever made and it’s perfect. No cracking or breaking apart nice smooth and great taste and super easy to make. I don’t need another fondant recipe. I have found the one! I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was perfect. I would recommened a nonstick mat because after i allowed it to become room temperature despite applying confectioner sugar to my counter it still stuck like crazy until I added Crisco to the counter.

Perfect recipe! It turned out exactly as I expected. I would definitely recommend adding the dye after the marshmallows have melted. It will make it much easier to achieve the perfect color!

I added a link to your recipe in my blog! I had never made fondant before this, thinking it entailed a crazy ingredient list and a lot of time. Such a great and simple recipe! 

Thank you so much for sharing!

This fondant recipe is completely horrible! It's super sticky, so you get it all over your hands, even with the butter! It also stuck to the tongues on the beater and it took forever to get it off! It is totally not worth the time and effort! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!

This was my first time making fondant and it was super easy!!  I generally don't like the taste of fondant but this is good! Use Wilton gel food coloring to color. I also ended up using about 1/2-1 cup more powdered sugar than the recipe called for...so it wasn't so sticky.

Great recipe!  Super easy to make!  I did make changes just because 1. I had no Crisco and 2. I didn't want to use butter on it.  Instead I used coconut oil.  About a teaspoon spread around on my hands.   Oh and I used large marshmellows because it was what I had.

Recipe behaved exactly as she said it would and turned out fantastic.  Now if I can just turn it into a unicorn horn and ears.

Excellent recipe. Followed it to a T minus the vanilla. I dyed the fondant balls "camouflage" colors for my son's Army cake! Kneaded the color in after separating the white fondant into different balls. Takes awhile but it's worth it!

This is my second time making this fondant. It turned out fine the first time, but I decided to make a couple changes this time: (because I found it frustrating doing them in the microwave) I melted large marshmallows on the stove in a pot with butter (as one would making rice krispy snacks) and just as marshmallows we're almost melted I added the water and vanilla extract, as well as some red food colouring. I used a spatula to mix it, stirring continuously as not to burn it and keeping on very low heat.  And because I'm low on confectioners sugar, I added regular fine granulated sugar to the melted marshmallows and stirred until dissolved. Then I put some sifted confectioners sugar in a mixing bowl and made a well, and poured the melted marshmallows in and stirred until the dough formed. As I began kneading I noticed the colour was becoming more pink, so I needed to add colour but didn't want serial killer hands at my sons bday party tomorrow. So I used. Clean pair of rubber gloves (the kind for washing dishes or cleaning) and greased them with butter then added my red food colouring. I actually found it much less sticky than using my hands! So the tip is: wear buttered rubber gloves while kneading! :)

Wow! I have making fondant and covering cakes for years, and my recipe was good, but wasn't as thick as I'd like when I covered a cake (it showed bumps from the cake).This fondant is nice and thick and goes more smoothly on  a cake. So excited! I did have to microwave the marshmallows for more than a minute, like 90 seconds

My first time making my own fondant. It definitely tasted loads better than the other stuff. I was a little hard to work with though. It was more sticky than I am used to. I had to add more powdered sugar to get it workable.

I made this according to the recipe, no changes (rating and reviewing a recipe you didn't even follow is misleading). I had a few problems, one of which I knew would be an issue before I made it.
1. It doesn't specify that the sugar needs to be sifted. A beginner might not know to sift confectioners sugar for most recipes anyway. As I said, I made this exactly as the recipe says, and it does not say to sift it. This resulted in clumps of confectioners sugar that wouldn't mix with the rest of the fondant. You either have to take ages finding and correcting each individual little clump, or you have to be okay with a bumpy fondant (which defeats the esthetic purpose of fondant).
2. I needed to add way more sugar than was called for in order to get it to the "no longer sticky to the touch." Some of this was due to the little clumps of unsifted sugar, but it took way more than what was lost to clumping.
3. Contrary to the instructions, it took longer than ten minutes to get to the "smooth and no longer sticky to the touch" stage of kneading.
4. It's not until you're three quarters of the way through kneading that having buttered hands helps at all. Until you're almost done anyway, no amount of butter is going to keep your hands from getting EXTREMELY sticky. I don't mind the stickiness, it comes with the territory, I just want to give you a heads up that the instruction given to help the issue is useless. Don't bother with the butter.

Used my mixer for most of it and then kneaded the rest of the powdered sugar in by hand. Used shortening to grease my mixer bowl and dough hook. Didn't use butter or shortening anywhere else.
Turned out nicely. Still has a nice marshmallow flavor. Was easy to roll out. Tinted some of it green and added mint flavoring. Yum!

The butter listed isn't for the actual recipe. Its to keep the mixture from sticking to your hands while transferring and kneading. The mixture cools while you mix so if you're adding the confectioners sugar a cup at a time, it should be cooled by the time you touch it. Awesome recipe. If followed step by step, your fondant will come out wonderfully

Not sure what went wrong. my marshmellows were never stiff. I added 1 c confection sugar and still soupy. I melted more marshmellows those were stiffis - no water no vanilla - I added them to the stuff that looks like potato soup. Just a soupy sticky mess. I thought if I added the other cup that it would stiffen up. nope. The butter did not keep it off my hands at all. It's just a melty, sticky, white mess.  :( I must have done something wrong but not sure what.

This was excellent and easy! It did take longer than a minute to get the marshmallows to melt enough. I put it in as it said and put the water and vanilla, but after stirring it wasn't smooth enough so I put it back again for maybe 20 seconds? Then stirred again and repeated until it wasn't lumpy anymore. I used shortening (generic Crisco) instead of butter as someone mentioned and it turned out great! Everything else I followed the recipe! Once the stickiness went away (the shortening definitely helped with this! Keep recoating your hands with it!) it was very pliable. It made a lot too. I was able to completely cover the cake once with one color (the cake was 9-inch diameter, 2 layers tall) and make several decorations for the top, and I still had a LOT left over. I probably could've covered the cake a few more times with all the fondant it made! Before laying the fondant, I did cut the rounded tops off each layer of cake so it'd be flat. I completely iced the yellow cake in chocolate frosting, and then I laid the fondant. Believe it or not the combination of the traditional yellow/chocolate cake with the marshmallow fondant actually worked really well! Before refrigerating, I divided the fondant and colored each as needed before wrapping up. It didn't take long to bring it back to room temperature (I even warmed it up a bit with my hands right when I took it out, before unwrapping it). I got a lot of compliments on the appearance and the taste of this cake! It was a lot of

First time making and using fondant! I was sooooo surprised at how easy it was.  I covered my first layer using the crisis method on the pastry mat. Worked ok.  So I decided to use the confectionary sugar method.  MUCH ESAIER.  Used it on my hands too. Needless to say the 2nd 2 layers came out better.  But was a learning experience and I will defiantly use fondant again.  I never did bc always tasted sooo bad. But not this one!

What did I do wrong? I kneaded and kneaded and kneaded. It never stopped being sticky :( I followed it exactly. I hope it works when I take it out tomorrow but I'm skeptical.

I made fondant for the first time using this recipe and was surprised how well it turned out.  I added my food coloring after I stired in the water and doubled the vanilla. I lost count of how much powdered sugar I used,  it mm ay have been about a cup more then the recipe, you just keep adding more till its the correct consistancy. After the fondant was no longer sticky, I wrapped it up and put it in the refrigerator for a couple house (I didn't plan ahead to have it sit over night). I warmed up the fondant in the microwave on a low level till it was workable but not warm.  It was easy to roll out and was pleased with the results and it tasted great.

I made this recipe today for my first attempt with fondant.  I made the fondant in my kitchenaid mixer because I didn't want to kneed the dough for 10 minutes.  Kitchenaids have that great attachment just for that!  So, I made the fondant, colored it in 2 different colors, and all went well... until I rolled it out.  I used powdered sugar on a silicone mat, kind of like flour for bread dough.  This stuff stuck like nothing else.  I didn't know anything would stick to silicone mats, but this stuff did.  I added more powdered sugar, and it stuck.  So, I had a mess of a time.  Until I figured out that the author had specified that you use butter to kneed the dough to keep it from sticking to your hands.  I hadn't added any butter, because I wasn't kneeding it by hand.  I added a little butter, and sure enough, the stuff rolled out like a dream.  It didn't stick, it was easy to handle, and everything went smooth from there.  I am so pleased with this recipe!  I will for sure make it again, I had so much fun making this cake!  Next time, I will have the kitchenaid do the kneeding again, but I will add the 1/4 cup butter to the mix.  Thank you, I love it!

If the marshmallows aren't totally melted, just add the water, vanilla and the powered sugar, one cup at a time. After you get more than half the powdered sugar, let a kitchen aid take care of the rest of the kneading. This will also cut down on the butter/crisco. When you roll out the fondant, use extra powdered sugar and keep checking the board for stickiness; especially if you are rolling out large sheets of fondant.

yes, even I made it.  I followed the directions, watched the video twice.  ....DON"T butter your hands until after you have dusted the work surface. (duh).
It worked out for me just following the directions.    this is too cheap and easy to use the packaged stuff again

This was the first time I made my own fondant. It tastes far better than store bought pre-made. I divided it into three parts. One large plain white part and one small orange dyed part and one larger purple part and one good size pink part. I have put it in the frig and will take it out again in a day or two to make the flowers, calla lillies, fantasy flowers, and plumeria flowers for my daughter's 6th birthday cake. It will be gorgeous and this fondant recipe was awesome. It was easy to make too. I do not own a microwave, but I put my marshmallows in my mixer bowl over a pot of boiling water and the marshmallows melted perfectly! I do not recommend kneading this in your mixer if you have a Hamilton Beach stand mixer. It tried to kill it, so I did the rest of the kneading on my counter. It worked fine. Plus my kids got to play with some too, so we all had some fun this morning. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I made this fondant and another from a blog and this one beat the other hands down. It was easy to make and add color to. I'm doing flowers for my daughter's wedding cake and they are beautiful. The other called for oil and all I got was a greasy mess. This fondant was pliable and the texture was much nicer with the butter. Thanks for sharing.

I've never made fondant before but I must say this was way easier than I expected! I'm not actually  sure how much powdered sugar I used because I just added it until I got the right texture, but I tried to use around what the recipe called for. I didn't end up needing the butter either- coating my hands with more powdered sugar worked better. The final product was a bit stickier than the store-bought stuff I'm used to but I probably just needed to add more sugar. I gave this 4 stars because it didn't really taste very good. I know fondant never tastes great but I actually think the Wilton's stuff tastes slightly better.

4 stars only because, as a rule, fondant is a pain to make. I did break my beaters and have to finish off with a fork one of the times I made this. Tastes like sugar. Much better than plastic! If you have/want to make your own fondant, I recommend this recipe.

This recipe is fantastic. So simple to make and easy to work with, much tastier than purchased fondant and much cheaper! Definitely worth making it yourself because it literally takes five minutes or less and it's great every time.
Its a little soft for making figurines and flowers but I made do, just allow a lot of drying time. It doesn't dry too brittle either which is nice

This recipe just did not cut it. I tired it 3 times, got 3 different textures and was not happy with any of them. I like to cover my cakes in fondant and with this recipe I don't see how you could. Every time you touch the fondant it leaves sticky fingerprints, would not smooth out with a fondant smoother and yes, I added more and more confectioners sugar and it still did not help. Yes, I used crisco and yes, I let it sit in the fridge. I think it'll be great to make decorations and it will definitely stick to anything you put it on, but it can't compare to buttercream fondant. I'll try again to learn the error of my ways, only because of the stellar reviews everyone writes. But, for now I've ordered the buttercream fondant and am breathing a sigh of relief I don't need to deal with that sticky and unforgiving mess!

This is the third time that I'm attempting to make fondant and this recipe is very easy. The first and second time i attempted to make fondant, I tried to divide the recipe and make it in a mixer and both times the result was absolutely horrible. Today, I decided to follow this recipe as is and do it with my hands and it came out so perfect. I also coloured my fondant pink! I put in the colouring along with the extract right after i melted my marshmallows. If you are having problems with this recipe then maybe all you need is a little patience, have another try.

I didn't use butter and instead just used lots of  the icing sugar to prevent it from sticking to my hands. This made it smoother and matte as opposed to shiny. It was really easy!

Makes just over 3 lbs. great recipe! Used vegetable shortening instead of butter, and kneaded in my electric mixer with the dough hook.

Been using this receipt minus vanilla for years, great stuff. Use high quality ingredients for best tasting results. I use coconut oil vice butter. Tastes amazing. Usually need more sugar than prescribed.

Super easy to make! And your cake will look professional. I used it to make a dinosaur cake for my sons birthday. I followed the recipe but added food coloring to the melted marshmallows and it turned out great, much easier to color the fondant in the melted marshmallows then after its done and trying to knead it in. It tastes great, way better then store bought! I will never buy store bought  fondant again. It is also about a third of the price. Love love love it!

I only made was halving the recipe, which was more than enough for the cake I did. I also used my Kitchen Aid to mix the initial stages. I also had to periodically stop, empty the mixer bowl and regrease. The taste is great, not plastic like bought fondant. The texture is nice and smooth. The only recommendation that I would suggest is, like others, use Crisco to grease EVERYTHING!

THIS WAS AMAZING. although i tried using colored marshmellows and it didn't make a pretty color. I HIGHLY reccomend using "NON COLORED" Marshmellows.

So easy to make and tastes so much better then store bought and so much cheaper then a bucket.  I don't change a thing about it.  Everyone loves it.  I make it all the time and I have never seen anyone peel it off the cake.

Very easy to make. I used marshmallow cream instead. Turned out fantastic and even tasted good. This was my first time dealing with fondant and I have to say I was a bit intimated. Once I got going with it  I found it to be really easy.

I've never made fondant and I was not  too keen on the traditional version with glycerin and unflavored gelatin - "specialty items".  This one had such simple ingredients!  Couple of tips:  grease your hands frequently (I used Crisco), even if your hands are covered with goo.  It helps it  come off your hands, so don't panic as I nearly did!  I divided it in half to knead and realized that the batch that sat for a while was a lot easier to work with, so next time I'll let it "rest" before kneading.  Last, I used my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook to mix and it worked great.

I love this recipe! I had always refused to use fondant because of it's taste. It is very sweet, but it tastes good. I had some in the fridge for two months, and it was perfect.

Makes OK fondant, but the recipe is way off in how much powdered sugar it takes to get past the "sticky" stage. I've made this twice now with the same results. Both times I used freshly opened, national-brand ingredients. The proportions listed resulted in a sticky, gluey mess no matter how long I kneaded it. Both times I ended up adding a few extra cups of powdered sugar beyond the 2 lbs suggested. As long as you are prepared for this, and get a some extra sugar beforehand, it should work fine.

I love the flavor, but I have no idea how everyone else who's reviewed this recipe, manages to have the proportions of ingredients come out accurately. I've made this 4 times and I always need to add different amounts of powdered sugar---always far and away more than the recipe states. Nuking the fondant back to life does help, but the consistency has varied greatly from one batch to the next for me.

I was scared to try fondant for the first time, but it turned out great! Super easy, and I even won a bake-off at work.

A couple things I learned that other newbies like me might find useful:

As some reviewers have mentioned, this is not a pure white fondant. Using clear vanilla extract will help with the off-white color that traditional brown vanilla will impart. Or, skip the vanilla altogether.

Secondly: Do not refrigerate the cake once the fondant is on. If you do, when you remove it from the fridge, it will sweat as it comes up to room temperature and not look as nice, and it may cause any additional decor you've added to your cake to melt/run.

Was a great recipe and not only performed well but tasted good. I frosted my cake fist with my old faithful cream cheese frosting. 1 stick butter, box of 10x sugar, block cream cheese and 1 tsp vanilla. Went on beautifully after that. Very pleased!!!!!

This fondant worked great! Way better than store bought, east to make and handle! My first attempt at covering a cake with fondant - and it worked! Woohoo! I did add the yellow food coloring to the marshmallow/water pre-powdered sugar, black was kneaded in after.

I love it!!! It was so easy, came out like a playdough. Took me maybe 10 minutes to have the fondant ready. Just folded heated marshmallows into the confectioner sugar and sprayed my hands with Pam before kneading. FUN!!!

Great recipe! I tried dusting the surface with icing sugar but still ended up sticking - greasing the work surface with butter worked much better. My first attempt at ever using fondant went VERY well, all thanks to this recipe.

A friend of mine suggested we make our own fondant for a birthday cake, so we gathered all the ingredients. We actually used the wrong proportions as powdered sugar was 6 dollars a bag. After a tedious process of chopping regular marshmallows into a substitute for minis, we put a metal bowl on top of a boiling pot of water as a microwave. After all of these substitutions, we were actually able to make a fondant like goop. 
It doesn't taste that good. It is time consuming, messy hard..... much easier store bought.

My very first try with this fondant didn't go over great, but it was my fault. I used drop color instead of gel, which I think added too much moisture to it. When I made it the second time, I bought the Wilton brand color and BOOM! This was amazing! It took the color wonderfully, was so very easy to use, and it was very easy to "paste" fondant decorations on the cake I made using just a drop of water. I used powdered sugar instead of cornstarch or flour when rolling. I have a bakery friend who has asked for my recipe because of the ease and the wonderful taste!

I love the flavor of this fondant. Due to weather conditions at times I need more sugar or more liquid.

Excellent!! First time making my own fondant....I always buy the high quality brands for bakery supply store.....however I have to say that this fondant is comparable to the best pre-made fondant out there.......moreover, I didn't add the 1/4 of water and was able to cover an entire cake almost immediately....

This was super sticky. I kept kneading it with a lot of sugar after I let it come to room temperature. It would get stuck to everything!!!! Thank you.

this was my first fondant.  it was super-duper sticky.  definitely keep the jar of crisco ready.  i also laid down a lot of corn starch to help me with kneading. i couldn't figure out how to get the rolled fondant onto my 10" double layer cake, so i ended up having to do two pieces, with a big crack down the middle. that was frustrating.  it definitely tasted pretty good compared to other fondant.  will use it again.

I needed a lot more powdered sugar to knead than what was listed. I used other flavoring besides the vanilla. Turned out great and didn't need the butter at all.

Like some of the other members I used marshmallow fluff instead of melting a bag of marshmallows. It just seems to be more consistent. Very easy to use as a pallet for decorating a cake. will use this recipe again!

Never made Fondant before but have used store bought before, and this is so much better! It took a few trips to the microwave to get all marshmallows melted, but between that and a lot of kneeling, turned out great!

Made for my son's birthday cake and it turned out amazing! Simple ingredients, easy to make and it tastes great.

Note: if you want to make figures using this fondant, it will not harden unless you ad the tylose powder. I wish the recipe had stated that because I had to go to plan D to get the elephants looking OK on the cake.

I made this fondant for my son's 4th Birthday superhero cake and was very happy with the outcome.  I followed the recipe and only needed to add about a 1/2 cup more powdered sugar while kneading the fondant towards the end.  This fondant was easy to work with, looks amazing, tastes wonderful and the kids enjoyed playing/eating it too!

The fondant itself tasted really good, but it was waaay too sticky. I added more powdered sugar than called for and still it was too sticky to even tranfer onto the cake or knead food coloring into.

Tried this recipe for the first time today. I've always been afraid of doing this but decided to just go for it-- and it's perfect! I've never had fondant before, so for me it's really, really sweet, but the texture is amazing... really soft and puffy, not at all sticky, wonderful to work with. I can't wait to use it tomorrow for the cake I'm baking with my friends :).

Turned out great! I also used the KA mixer and let it do all the work. Didn't really need the butter or the shortening for any of it. Will certainly be making this recipe in the future! It makes a great amount, so it goes a long way.

It definitely works and does take quite a while to knead but I have to say I am not a big fan of the taste of this! I put it on top of my cupcakes (an extremely thin layer) and it was still sickly sweet even though I had already reduced the sugar in the cupcakes. Maybe its an acquired taste but I did not care for it at all. All my friends thought it looked beautiful though!

Make sure you have TONS of butter on your hands!  And scoop everything everything everything out of the bowl and into a pile before you start kneeding....or else you'll never be able to get it out.....sticky craziness!  Best fondant I've ever eaten though!

absolutly perfect! I have made marshmellow fondant before but was always chewy and marshmallowy. This recipe with the addition of the water cuts that and made a perfect texture that was easy to roll, cut and form.

It turned out very well. It is very sweet though. I would not recommend using a hand mixer while trying to mix this as it does not work well. I found using the bread hook on my stand mixer worked the best. It was a big hit at the party and people loved the cake. It makes it look like it was done professional. Thanks for the recipe

My son wanted a "Club Penguin" cake for his birthday last year. Thank you so much for this recipe. I had no idea what I was doing but this saved me. I made an igloo, "puffles", penguins, etc. Not professional but he loved it and everyone thought it was so cute!

Bestest recipes EVER!it turned out too good!it tasted awesome too.I covered a cake with it and decided to make some flowers too and amazingly without adding any gem tex it still dried in jus a few hours instead of overnight.I did not use any butter though and i did need an extra cup of icing sugar as well!I wud suggest dusting your surface with a bit of cornstarch for a smooth fondant and no sticking.I did something most ppl wud be so against OR SCARED to do so  ...i kept my fondant covered cake in the fridge (covered)for two nights! IT WAS STILL AWESOME!so overall give it a try it really is worth it :)i wish i could give it more than 5 stars ..thanku kiele and allrecipes!

Worked great!  I did it all by hand because I thought it would be too messy to use the Kitchen Aid... next time I'll break out the KA.  I used it 1/2 hour after making (letting it rest in the frig) because I needed it done right away.  I don't know if it would be better the next day, but it seemed just fine in the time I had.  My 9 year old had a great time using it to make Ninjago decorations for his birthday treat. I don't think I'll use the butter next time, I'll use shortening or coconut oil instead.

This stuff took a little longer than it said to make, and I am sure I need some practice rolling it out and decorating with it, but it came out AWESOME! I had to throw the leftovers away because I was eating it plain it tasted so good!!!

I used this fondant on my daughters birthday cake this year, it was really good. I'm not a big fan of having a thick layer of regular fondant on cake. It looks nice but doesn't taste very good unless it's super thin. I used marshmallow fluff to make this a little easier, the finished product was super sweet (obviously) which worried me that it would make the cake to sweet. Even with the icing and cake underneath everything still tasted wonderful! I won't use regular fondant again.

This was my first time making fondant, and I have to admit- I was scared! But this recipe was so incredibly simple and it came out flawless! I will never buy fondant again- this recipe is wonderful and a money saver!

I am sorry I don't really understand .. is that 1/4c of butter just to rub our hands with? or do we mix it with the dough? I made it yesterday with no butter in the dough and it's kind of dry. I did make 6 butterflies for a test and they came out OK but not shiny, the rest is still in my refrigerator. I read other fondant recipes, they use butter/shortening on the dough. The taste is good though, just dry and not shiny. Maybe if I put the butter in the dough it will be perfect and I will sure increase the star.

Worked out great, just like everyone said it would! Only problem I had was that my low-budget stand mixer didn't want to deal with the thickness of the dough as it came together, so I ended up kneading the whole thing by hand for about 20 minutes. I even discovered (after I totally forgot to add the coloring while it was liquid) that you can melt it back down to semi-liquid form, mix in the food coloring, then let it harden again in the fridge, and it's none the worse for wear. Great that I won't have to waste the whole batch now, just because I forgot one step. This is super easy and tastes better than any real fondant (but it's still not really delicious, it tasted mostly like powdered sugar and not much else). Would be really good on a cake that's not super sweet itself, since this fondant plus a regular boxed cake was far too sweet, and I LOVE sugar!

I've never made or worked with fondant at all. After getting through the initial stickiness of this recipe, it turned out great. I've now made 3 covered cakes and fondant decorations, they all turned out lovely and the marshmallow fondant was delicious.

Turned out great. Just wish I had though to put food coloring in before step 4 the next day. I was able to change the color gradually as I worked it but it would have been much easier if I'd done it in the initial stages when I had it in my kitchen aid (step 2).

Very simple to make and work with. This was my first time working with fondant, so I was hesitant. I still prefer to eat a cake with old fashion buttercream frosting, but I would use this recipe to decorate anytime!

I made this as the recipe is written, to mixed results.  It was my second time working with fondant (the first time I used the "Rolling Fondant" recipe from this site).  This tastes worlds better than the "Rolling Fondant" recipe but for me was MUCH harder to work with.  It stuck to practically everything and required the addition of almost 1/2 a box of cornstarch to get it to a workable state.  The taste warrants a second try though.  Next time, I'm gonna try making it with marshmallow fluff as recommended in another review and maybe adding some cornstarch at the start?

This is an AMAZING recipe, super easy to make and very delicous. I didn't really want to measure out 2 pounds so I just kept adding cups of sugar till it was dough and it worked out beautifully. I defininatly recommend this one!

4 Tbsp water seems to be too much, ~1.5-2 Tbsp water + 1 tsp vanilla-which should be clear, by the way, if you don't want light creamy-golden-brown fondant-works better, as after making several batches I can declare that 4 Tbsp water requires > 2 lbs sugar. Also recommend sifting sugar prior to mixing. Once you get the ratios right this is a good recipe, just wish I hadn't had to spend so much time experimenting/adjusting liquid volumes and running out of sugar.

This recipe does everything it promises... Looks and acts like fondant but tastes better.  I've used it several times with various extracts for different flavor (almond is especially good but so is vanilla as the recipe directs).  Kneading in additional powdered sugar beyond what the recipe directs makes the fondant easier to work with but also eventually makes it tougher so it depends what kind of texture you want.  I've even frozen this fondant after placing it on top of a cake and it has no adverse effect on texture or flavor though the appearance is shinier (this also seems to work better with added powdered sugar).  Great and flexible recipe.

This was great, it was my first time ever making fondant and it was really easy to make. I loved the taste ! Although it sticks to everything, i found that having some confectionery sugar on the counter it seemed to work. I would say to put the food coloring before its done mixing otherwise you stain your hands, and it turns out streaky. I use this recipe all the time now!

Well I have never made fondant nor have I ever felt it other then being on a cake my friend made, she totally rocks at cakes! But I don't particularly like the way her fondant tastes so I told her we should try to make marshmallow fondant because it is way cheaper and is supposed to taste better!! Well I made half this batch and I didn't measure anything lol just kind of eye balled it! and it turned out pretty good as far as mixing it and getting it to the right consistency as far as I know lol!! And it tastes super yummy! She will be over tomorrow to work it with me and see how it does, thanks for the great recipe!!! So easy and very yummy!

I am so confused by this recipe!!

I made it with my KA bread kneading attachment.  

I followed the recipe except used Crisco instead of butter as suggested.  I found my stuff very dry.  I didn't use even close to the 2lbs of icing sugar.  It is currently in my fridge but I am sure it is way too dry.  It seemed like it was at the proper consistency at about 2 cups of icing sugar but I kept adding thinking I must be mistaken.  I don't know if I didn't use enough marshmallow - I used 16 oz (which is 2 cups).

Ok...it only took me 3 tries to figure out that 16 oz of liquid = 2 cups.  Once I tripled my marshmallow, it worked great!

Easy and fun.  My first ever attemp.  I made this for a cake for my childrens birthday party and everyone gasped when they saw how nice it looked.  The only negative was the little kids were in awe and couldnt keep their hands off the cake!  I cant wait to make more cakes.  Thank you for this recipe!

Used crisco, tasted great, it was hard to work with because Im a first timer? I couldn't really cover my cake with it properly, but was able to make really awesome figures and shapes with it. Great recipe will try again.

Was wondering what type of frosting can be used under or over  the marshmallow fondant? Is it only butter cream?

I tried this for the first time and unfortunately i didnt have a microwave to melt my marshmallows. So i did it te old fashion way on the stove top. Took me a while to work in all the powdered sugar but in the end i loved how it came out. Tasted great too! Way cheaper than buying premade.

I have NEVER worked with fondant before, but wanted to try it for my son's birthday cake as I was making a baseball cap.  I too followed the recipe and found that I needed more powdered sugar then what it called for.  I continued to add the sugar until it wasn't sticky.  I agree with the other reviews in saying to USE YOUR KA!!  It worked wonders.  The next day I got it to room temp (about 4 hours) before using it.  Rolling it out was very sticky, so I kept adding sugar but didn't seem to work well.  Then I remembered reading a comment which stated to use crisco on everything.  I rubbed some on my hands and on the rolling pin and WOW it was like magic!  It rolled out very nicely and it was easy to handle.  I put it on my cake and within an hour it was dry and looked like a real baseball hat!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I really liked this recipie. The only problem was that it was really sticky when I rolled it out. I had to keep adding more powdered sugar. Still, I would definitely use this again.

This was SO easy and fun to make. I added my color BEFORE I mixed the ingredients. I was making a cheeseburger birthday cake and needed to make a 9 inch square of "CHEESE".I also heated the water before adding it to the marshmellows. It helped with the mixing. I added some red food color to a small amount of the fondant to make "KETCHUP" for the top of the cheeseburger cake.

So easy! I appreciate that it didn't require and obscure ingredients. As a college kid I don't have much on hand for supplies. So instead of buying food coloring (which I'd probably never use again) I just separated the different colors from a couple bags of
colored mini marshmallows. It worked great.

This recipe is PERFECT! My time ever making fondant, and it was a success. I had to add a little more confectioners sugar since it was semi-humid out, but other than that this recipe was as easy as making yellow cake (if not easier)! I am 13 years old, and proud to say I made my first fondant all by myself--thanks so much! I did it by hand and used two forks throughout this recipe, and my hand didn't hurt much.  Thank you so much! ~Bae

I have never worked with fondant before but decided to give this one a try.  As far as the recipe goes, it is very easy to make and does taste delicious.  The actual working with fondant part was not as easy, it kept ripping apart while I was transferring it to the cake ( I kept my nails short and tried to use my palms instead of fingers, but this didn't seem to matter), so I found the only way to prevent that was to roll it out thicker than I wanted it.  This made my cake very heavy, but luckily I wasn't transporting it anywhere.  I think I just need more experience working with fondant, my criticisms are not exactly about this specific recipe, just fondant itself.  It did look beautiful when I finally got it to work though!

I LOVE this fondant! After buying Wilton brand rolled fondant for $19.99 at the store, then having everyone just peel it off their cake and throw it away, I was so relieved to find a fondant that was tasty and inexpensive to make. I did not use the 1/4 c of butter for the kneading and I increased the vanilla a little. I also added gel food color to the melted marshmallow which was easier than trying to tint the finished fondant. Thanks for this GREAT recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!!!   I had never tasted fondant period, but I've heard stories of people saying it looks pretty but tastes awful, so after reading many reviews, I decided to go with Kiele's recipe for marshmallow fondant, and OMG this fondant is simply delicious, easy to make, yes, a bit sticky, until it gets to the right consistency, and then is just dough. My husband loved it!!!   I made two batches, on the second one (I didn't use my hands to knead, I used a fork, it kept my hands clean, and once it was no longer sticky, I used my hands) I just hate the sticky feeling (that's why I don't eat mangos, unless my husband peels and cuts them for me)   LOL   - Great recipe!!!!!   Thanks Kiele!

This was really great. It worked well for me-no problems. Everyone who has problems with your fondant tearing-rub some butter or Crisco or whatever. Tastes great and is a wonderful alternative to the original fondant which is just yuck.

I used this for my very first time with fondant.  I found it very easy to make.  I have not tried premade fondant before so I have nothing to compare it to but I am not a huge fan of the taste of the marshmallow fondant.  Everyone has said it tasted better than store bought.  If that is the case I have no desire to try store bought.  I give it a 4 star because I am technically not the greatest baker but still found it pretty simple.

Wonderful recipe that I will use again. It's edible and did not dry up and crack immediately. I was able to cover a 9x12x2 and two 6x4 rounds easily. My husband even ate it and he's picky. I ended up using a lot more powdered sugar so I will up the extract next time. I will also try it with almond next time to try to get a marzipan kind of taste.

So easy!  I can't believe I never tried this.  I used marshmallow fluff per another review and it worked great.  I did, however, need more than 2 lbs XXX sugar--about 1 cup more.  Also I recommend more than 1 tsp extract if you are using a flavor.  I used mint extract and I needed much more than 1 tsp.  I ended up using 1 Tbsp and compensated by decreasing the amount of water by 2 tsp.

My first time making fondant and I think it went really well! I didn't want to make lots of mallow-covered dishes, so I put the marshmallows in my Kitchenaid mixer bowl and set it in a pot of water on the stove as a make-shift double boiler, holding a lid over it in between stirs to aid in the melting. Then put the bowl on the mixer, mixed with liquids, put it back in water, and mixed again with the sugar. When I was down to about a cup of sugar left, I dumped the fondant onto waxed paper covered in remaining sugar and kneaded from there. Messy, but looks great, tastes good, and much cheaper than store bought!

I have made this recipe 3 times now. It is worth every penny to purchase a Wilton Fondant Cut & Roll mat. This will make it MUCH easier to roll your fondant without it sticking, and gives you more time to leave it rolled out before moving it to the cake (you still need a healthy bit of powdered sugar on your surface) . Also, I didn't have to use any butter or crisco at all once I purchased the fondant mat.  For beginners, don't try to bake and/or decorate the day of the party. Make the cake 2 days ahead, and cover it with ganache, or some other firm frosting, and refridgerate it overnight. This gives you a smooth, crumb-free surface to work with. Then do most of the decorating the day before the party.   Finally, I'm not a fan of the taste of fondant at all, but this one tastes decent, and it sure is fun to work with, it gives the cake a really nice appearance, and the kids love it!

While this fondant tasted absolutely amazing it was very frustrating to work with.  It's unbelievably sticky and takes forever to clean up.  I also think I had a harder time because I was trying to cover such a large cake (3 layers).  Next time I'll try using the marshmallow fluff as was suggested.

In the past I've tried the store bought fondant, however, I thought the taste left something to be desired.  This recipe was very easy and I am very pleased with the result.   I bough marshmallow fluff, but decided to use regular mini-marshmallows.  After melting them, I put them in the Kitchen Aid and beat them at a medium speed until smooth.  I replaced with the dough hook and added the icing sugar.  I did not find it had a "sticky" consistency as others had mentioned, perhaps because I used the hook as opposed to doing it all by hand.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will use again in the future.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  Not only was it easy to make and use, it also tasted great.  I have tried other fondant recipes and this is hands down the best.  Thank you to the person who suggest adding color to the melted marshmallows because that eliminated all of the kneading to get it blended evenly. One batch yields a good amount too.  Save money and use this recipe!!

This is my first time making fondant...and it was super easy. I melted the marshmallows in the microwave and then I transfered them to the kitchen aid bowl (coated with shortening). I added the water plus vanilla, and the slowly kept on adding the powdered sugar. I used the flat whisk from the kitchen aid. After I integrated all my powdered sugar I covered my hand with the shortening and starting to knead it. It was super easy to make.  It is in the refrigerator in an air tight ziploc bag ( I close the bag leaving 1/4 of an inch open and put a straw inside to get all the air out of the bag). Love this recipe...SUPER HAPPY!!!!

Picked this icing for my MIL's birthday cake. Right before I made the icing, I wondered if I had made a huge error, since I had never attempted fondant before. I'm happy to say, the fondant was very easy to make. I made a 3-tier round cake..the only complaints I had were due to errors on my part:) Everyone at the party went on and on about how pretty the cake was. Several commented on how good the fondant tasted...all the other fondant they had eaten tasted terrible. I must say, I have a new appreciation for those who have cake businesses:)

This is excellent! tastes great! I normally do not like fondant since it tastes gross but this stuff is so good! I thought it sounded a bit intimidating to make but it was so easy. I made 1/4 of a batch as I didn't need much and used others suggestions to add coloring before hand, i just put the water and flavoring and gel coloring in the same measuring cup and poured it all in at once. When I went to roll it out the next morning I took another suggestion to use corn starch for rolling it out, worked great!

I'm giving this four stars mostly because I feel like it didn't yield enough for what  I was making.  Next time I will double the recipe.  And I would avoid using a hand mixer- mine started smoking!!!  Lol luckily I didn't kill it, but I will either use a kitchen aid or my hands next time.

Ok, icing was alright. I definitely would not say simple but I am such a beginner it is not fair for me to judge. I actually did 3 batches because I was going to attempt to do my daughter a tier cake with zebra print. The white turned out great, but the color fondant was too difficult to work with. I made them the exact same less wilton food color gel. If anyone has advice that would be great. I ended up having to use the chocolate ganache and paint the zebra stripes on white layers. But I dont think anyone really liked the icing. They loved the cake just not the fondant. But we know it isnt really used for taste anyhow. Just thought it was a lot of work and waste on the colored. Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this fondant for the first time and I am so excited!  It came out beautifully and was REALLY EASY. It tastes so much better than premade expensive fondant and I plan on making my first cake order from it.  I couldn't be more thrilled.  I also used the Crisco method and it worked perfectly.  I will never go back to buying premade fondant.  A friend of mine is a cake decorator too and turned me onto this fondant.  She only uses MMF.  Now I do too.  Give this a try and thanks for the great post!

I had never made fondant before and could not believe how easy and simple it was to make! This recipe is great and now I am addicted to making fondant. I followed recipe exactly as written and had no problems. Yes it is sticky at first but just keep rubbing butter on your hands periodically and continue adding sugar. Knead it till it has a play-doh consistency. Great recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

Super easy to make.   I made it on the stove (no microwave) with a little extra butter.  I made it 2 hours before the birthday party--so no overnight chilling.  And it was fine.  Rolled out fine, looked great.  I will be making this again for sure!

I must be honest in saying that I was a bit nervous in trying this recipe.  I have never made fondant, but my daughter needed something other than a regular frosting to finish her project for science.  She used this to cover rice krispie treats that were cut and stacked to make a rock layer model.  This recipe worked wonderfully and the fondant was easy enough for her to work with.  I must also say that when mixing in the food coloring, leaving a slight swirled effect made it actually look like a gem pattern when we rolled it out.  Loved it - have lots left over in the fridge for another project - no longer nervous!

This is a great start.  My son is allergic to gelatin, so I am always looking for ways to get around it. (Gelatin is in marshmallows but not in marshmallow creme).  So I followed the review from Chef4Six.  The first time it didn't turn out so well.  I tried again and wanted to post my results here.  I used 16 ounces of marshmallow creme.  Like the other review, I left out the water step.  I too mixed it in the KA.  I also mixed in about 1 Tablespoon of Crisco while it was in the mixer.  While kneading it, I probably used about the full quarter cup of Crisco.  My results were pretty close to Wilton Fondant.  Not nearly as stretchy though.  Will play with this recipea little more!

This turned out awesome! I had never used fondant before, and I was kind of expecting a disaster, but, aside from a very sticky mess, it turned out wonderful! I'm going to use this recipe to make a cake for my friends bridal shower :) Thank you!

This was my first time ever tasting, working or making fondant and I think it was a success!  I used my kitchen aid and used shortening for greasing everything down.  Wasn't sure it was going to come together, but it did.  I colored it while it was still warm and it did beautifully!  not going to cover a whole cake for my first time, just accents, but I am excited to try it!  Will post pics after cakes are done this weekend.

I've always wanted to make fondant, but was intimidated. I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect! I heeded the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and rolled out the fondant on cornstarch and greased up my hands with Crisco! I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I love this recipe! I used marshmallow fluff instead and chilled it in the fridge while I was baking my cakes (about 30 minutes.) I also had to use quite a bit more powdered sugar, especially for dusting and when I was kneading in different colors. I also skipped the buttering of my hands and did it all in my kitchen aid mixer. Talk about skipping a mess! This is fondant made easy!

When I first found this recipe an tried it, the result was really good. Over the past few years I have tweaked it and made it, in my opinion, better. At least for my needs. I use this recipe on wedding cakes all the time. Here is what I do: 
Use a stand mixer with the dough hook!! Spray all your bowls, spatulas ect that you sue with non stick cooking spray. Measure out 10 cups mini marshmallows, 1Tblsp clear vanilla extract, 2 Tblsp water into a large microwave bowl. Stir marshmallows to coat with van/water. Microwave until melted. Stir again, then pour into mixing bowl. Slowly add an entire 32oz. bag powdered sugar. Once incorporated, turn mixer on med and mix til smooth. Scrape out onto your work table that has been greased with white shortening. Need a bit more then put into a gallon size zip top bag. Place in fridge for a few hours til cool. Bring to room temp before rolling. Use corn starch to "flour" your surface when ready to cover your cake. If it seems a bit too soft, need in a bit of corn starch or powdered sugar. This recipe is best if it is used on the cake the same day it is made. It tastes SO much better than store bought fondant!

This recipe ive used for both my very first and my second times making fondant. I found it fairly simple, slightly tedious as far as the powdered sugar process. My best advice: always ALWAYS buy an extra bag of powdered sugar, use shortening, not butter, and smear your hands and counter with shortening; I spent about 20 minutes trying to get it off my hands and back into the bowl!  All in all, great recipe. Just a tip, if you want to color it, and youve already rolled it out, it doesnt work so well, so id suggest coloring it while your stirring the marshmallows that are nice and hot, or make a new batch :-)

I didn't use butter in the recipe, instead I COVERED my hands in shortening.  Worked great, and kept the marshmallow from sticking too much.  I also added vanilla flavoring (changed the color a little, but was dying it anyway), which really helped the flavor!    Once the fondant was cool, rolling and coloring worked great.  It warms in your hands, so you can always re-work pieces you don't like.  Drying time for me was longer for my 3D pieces, just becuase it was winter and we have a humidifier.  Definately things to consider when starting such a project!

WOW!!!!!   EASY!!!!  I tried the buttercream fondant recipe the other day and it just didn't come out right. I know why but I wanted to try this recipe rather then practice again with the other fondant.  I LOVED IT!!  It was so easy and it tastes so much better!!!  I didn't have mini marshmallows so I used the large ones and as long as you keep adding powdered sugar till the sticky is gone it works.  I don't have a mixer so my hands got really tired but it came out so perfect! My cake was beautiful and it tasted wonderful!!  Which says a lot about a recipe if you have never used fondant nor had any previous experience with decorating a cake!

Followed recipe as written.  Much easier than working with store bought fondant.  After having it in the fridge overnight and warming to room temperature, it was still a little hard to work with, so I put it in the mike for about 12 seconds and it become very pliable.  I colored the fondant with gel coloring before refridgerating.  It did end up killing my mixer.  Probably not enough amps, but this was some tough stuff before the kneading.  Rolled it out using shortening the next day and it worked fine.  Flavor obviously much better than fondant.

This made my cake look professional!  I didn't add any food color until after I had refrigerated the fondant, and the fondant was so hard the color turned out marble like.  I think I'll try adding the food coloring next time before refrigerating.

This makes a beautiful smooth fondant. I actually used to dough hook on my mixer and it worked great. I also used the hook to mix in food coloring to make different colored fondant.  I thought it tasted like the marshmallows from lucky charms cereal! :)

My first attempt at fondant and it turned out well.  Although it was hard to combine all the marshmallow, might be easier to do in half batches.  It was giving my kitchen aid a hard time while trying to combine.

I had planned to roll white circles of it around cake balls (to look like snowballs), but I could not get them smooth with just my hands, and little bits of dust and cloth fibres kept getting into it and making it look yucky :( So heads up to anyone thinking of dong that. Otherwise, it rolled out nicely and was very workable.

Easy to use, but i had some difficulty getting the bright colours i was after. Also it gets pretty soft from adding as much colour as i did. But the end result was a lot of fun!

This recipe was so great! My son asked for dynamite for his birthday (which I of course couldn't give him!) so I made a cake with this fondant that looked like a stack of dynamite.  We put sparklers that were left over from the 4th in the ends for the wicks.  It was FABULOUS to work with and so fun!  My friend helped me make this creation and we found ourselves snacking on the remaining fondant because it had a great taste - UNLIKE regular fondant!  Thanks so much for this great recipe.  I will use this for years to come!

This was really exhausting to make.  And you need two people to work on this.  Some people were talking about using their mixer but I did all mine by hand, it wasn't necessary to have a mixer.  With just a wood spoon and a bowl.  If it gets too hard to stir just pop it back in the microwave for 20 seconds.  I made the mistake of making 5 different colors of fondant.  Which looked pretty on my cookies but was way too much work for the outcome.  I would recommend this if you are only doing one color but would not recommend it if you want to make multiple colors.

Don't know what I am doing wrong, but this is the second recipe I have tried for fondant, and I can never get it to roll out.  The taste however was good as was the texture.  Kids had fun trying to decorate with it.

Thank you for helping me conquer my fear of fondant!  IMO this was easier than trying to frost with buttercream and get perfectly smooth.  I read all the reviews, I hemmed, I hawed and I finally took the plunge...all I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you!   I used crisco instead of butter and while it was quite a bit of work to get it to the right consistancy the results were worth it.  I didn't color it in the marshmellow phase because I needed more than one color but I didn't think it was too hard to get it kneaded in...it helped get it to a good rolling consistancy.  I used Whilton gel color.  I can't stress enough that this was a great recipe.

I enjoyed working with this recipe, and it was very tasty.  However, I did have trouble lifting large sheets of it.  It was quite pliable.  Luckily, my project was supposed to look patched together, or else I'd have been crying.  I'm sure more practice will improve my results, though!

I used this to make little colored leaves to top the cupcakes for my wedding.  People actually ate them!  Which is a testament to good fondant.  I also snacked on it as I made the leaves...  This was time-consuming to make, but worth it as it does keep for even a couple months in the fridge.

This was moderately easy for me. I did have trouble with tears and rips whilst draping the cake. I admit, I easily could have done something wrong. I will try it again for the next kid's birthday (next month) and edit this review after another try.

This is my second time making this fondant....well, it's my second time making any fondant at all.  I have always been a little intimidated of this type of icing but when I saw this recipe I thought "this sounds way too easy".  And it is!  I followed the recipe exactly each time and it has come out beautifully.  The only thing I do differently is that I used crisco the first time as I was out of butter and I have stuck with the crisco because it's nice and white.  What a great recipe.  Thanks!

I made this fondant twice in early October (minus the vanilla extract).  The first time I made it was for a practice cake, I kneaded it by hand, and it took forever but it was good and covered the cake well.  The second time I made it was for the 'final' birthday cake and I used my kitchen aide mixer to incorporate the ingredients.  The final result from the KA was a much smoother, more consistant, easier to work with fondant.  The flavor is great!  Others have commented on the end result not being white white but more of an off white color but ours was not, it was very white and worked perfectly for our cake.  I used wilton food colors to color other portions of the fondant and it turned out beautifully!  My daughter LOVED her birthday cake, and so did all of her party guests!!

Definately better thatn regular fondant in regards to taste. I have not ever worked with fondant and have wanted to try tot use it.  This was easy to make.  Followed the recipe and directions, tried to use my kitchen aid.  It was having to work too hard, so I just finished the kneading by hand and it came together nicely.  It was nice and smooth.  Used it for a ghost cake, it looked cute! Definately worth trying again, thanks.

Invest in a Kitchen Aid ... you'll need it!  With that aside, this is an awesome recipe!  Clean-up is a breeze and I should know, since my hand mixer quit working while I made this icing.  So, with 1/2 mixed fondant icing, I dumped the rest on the counter, grabbed my latex-free gloves, slapped on some butter and kneaded away.  I had to add additional food coloring since I was making 3 batches and my mixer burned up midway through the first and it blended in perfectly (yellow to orange).  Will keep this on hand and adding a KA to my Christmas Wish List! :)

This was so easy to use... i had to use a bit more butter to make it workable, but it was fantastic. Very smooth and nice texture. The only thing that concerned me was the oil from the butter and marshmallow. When I painted the fondant with food coloring, it came out really shiny, as if it was lacquered. A nice effect, but not entirely what i was looking for.

My first experience with fondant ever and after a bit of a long process where I was sure it wasn't going to turn out (It seemed like I was adding powdered sugar forever), it did!  I added pink food coloring after having it in the fridge over night and just kneaded it in with my hands sprayed with canola oil.  Worked like a charm.  Sweet, but my kiddos loved it!

The taste was wonderful. It didn't taste like plastic or to sweet. I did have trouble getting it off my counter and ended up rerolling after rubbing crisco on my counter.Next time I think I will try rolling it out on wax paper and flipping it over on to the cake. All in all, it looked great.

This was my first time to make and fondant and all in all I felt it wasn't nearly as scary sticky as some reviewers said. However, it is sweet! Next time I will make cut outs instead of covering all the cake. I also felt it was still sticky even after getting the dough consistancy, maybe needed more sugar? So I say 4 stars, although I recognize some may be due to my own failure. Will try it again!

I have never used Fondant before.  I have been wanting to give it a shot.  It was my brothers birthday and I decided to do it.  It really came great. It was super easy. I kept it white, although next time I will try to add color.  Thanks

Sticky and messy but oh so worth it! This was so easy I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong but no, it's just that simple. This recipe was my first venture into fondant and it was a blast and it tasted great...sugar-tastic but great. With this recipe I can't wait to try my hand at fondant again. Thanks for the recipe :)

Ive always bought the prepackaged fondant from the cake supply store and the guy their gave me this recipe. I used it for my last cake and it tastes sooooo much better than the other stuff. It tastes just like chewy marshmallows. And if you get a good enough crumb coat it becomes one with the buttercream and it tastes really yummy together. You can flavor it however you like. I used a bit of coconut oil and it was great with my straw-banana cake. It takes some kneading to get the sugar in but the prepackaged stuff takes some kneading as well so it evens out in the end. Plus compared to the pricey store bought stuff you simply cant go wrong. It literally costs me 75% less and the ingredients are always available. One thing I did change was I only used half of the water and added it to the marshmallows in the microwave and I used white shortening instead of butter. It was super easy!

This was okay..not to hard to make but the taste was just "okay" not sure what I could have done but it seemed to have a powdery look to it when finished.

I am a complete novice when it comes to baking and cooking. I can bake the usual muffins and cookies, but fondant is something I thought was WAY out of my league until I came across this recipe. This recipe was easy but there were a few things that I will do differently next time. I didn't need all that butter that is listed in the ingredient list. Also, When rolling out the fondant, i found it better to not make it so thin so that it has the smooth look to it when it is on the cake. Other than that, this recipe was great. I will definitely be using this recipe again!!

I've been making cakes for years but didn't like the taste of regular fondant.  This Marshmallow Fondant truly is incredible because it opens up the door to expanding your imagination when working with cakes PLUS you don't need to worry about the guests or customers peeling it off.  My son will eat it out of the bowl!  It can be messy making it but the result is SOO worth it!  Good for young kids to use as a replacement to play-doh too!

I really like this recipe, however, i am not too sure how to get it to become such bright vibrant colors...i tried regular food coloring, but i ended up using ALOT, is there another kind of food coloring out there that makes Bright Vibrant icing?

being that I havent made fondant before, ive learned so much from the internet, the only problem i had with this recipe was the butter. I used crisco instead on my hands and surface where I worked, which was a whole lot better! also a quick tip is to dye the marshmallows with food coloring then add the powdered sugar for colored fondant . but other than that who knew fondant could taste so good!

I didn't get this to work and followed the recipe exactly. It didn't taste bad but I could not get it not to be sticky...very hard to work with.  I will try again in case there's something I overlooked.

This was my first fondant cake and I couldn't believe how easy it was. My daughter wanted a skull cake for her 9th birthday and to buy it would have been an arm and a leg. I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. I can't wait to make another fondant cake now.

This was my first attempt at official cake decorating...ever.  Let alone using fondant, so very scary.  I followed other reviews and greased my KA w/ crisco and it worked perfect.  My assembly of the cake leaves a lot to be desired, however the fondant itself turned out better than expected for a complete rookie and it tasted much better than storebought.  I will definately try this recipe again to see if I can improve my skills.

This turned out very well. My sister makes it as the recipes says and complains of the huge mess left after kneading the dough on the counter. I greased up my stand mixer, threw the remaining butter flavored crisco into the bowl and used the dough hook with great success! I used more powdered sugar than the recipe calls for, but I was going for the right consistency rather than an exact quantity. I will, in the future, try other flavors than vanilla, I think a light maple might be good, or even mint, or almond. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I made this fondant 3 times.  The first time came out the best.  It looked great and tasted better than store bought.  I had to use an additional 2 cups of confectioners sugar to get the right consistency.  The second batch was was ok, but there were pock marks when I rolled it out.   It also didn't hold the color.  I used the Wilton gel color and after I covered the cake the color started to fade.  2 days later it was white again.  Does anyone know why this may have happened?  My cake looked gorgeous despite this snafu, but I was bummed about the color.

This was way to easy for the finished product. I have a KA mixer so it was a breeze. I also loved how forgiving it is unlike regular frosting. Will use this one again and again!!

I wish I had read the reviews about greasing a mixer! Though I did it all by hand, it was very simple and I'm very satisfied with the results! I've only used store-bought fondant before (and that very rarely) and I must say this fondant was waaay better. My neice's spongebob birthday cake is going to look wonderful, thanks!

This was not the first time I have tried to make fondant. But this was the best I have used. The marshmallow flavor is very yummy and it was very easy to work with. I will use this recipe over and over again. The amount of ingredients is very few and the steps very easy to follow, anyone could make this even a beginner.

This was my first experience with fondant. Never have eaten it or made it.I liked it a lot! My kids not so much. They thought it was too sweet. We are used to canned frosting. The recipe was just fine, it's my kids that need fixing! haha. Thank you  for giving me a challenge and going out of my comfort zone!! Will make again.
