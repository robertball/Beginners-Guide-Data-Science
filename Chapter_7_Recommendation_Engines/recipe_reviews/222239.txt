This is an excellent salad dressing.  It is a little tart, not too sweet and is very easy to make.  I used jellied cranberry sauce but I think that a whole berry or better yet homemade cranberry sauce would be even better.  Enjoy!

I made this dressing to go with my Thanksgiving meal. As another reviewer pointed out, it does make a lot (over 2 cups). I blended the ingredients with an immersion blender, and that did a fine job of emulsifying the oil.

One reviewer said the Dijon overwhelmed the cranberry flavor. That was not my experience, but I suspect that might be due to the style/brand of Dijon/cranberry sauce used. I tend to dislike Dijon (too strong), but have found I don't mind the Musette "traditional" Dijon. As for the cranberry sauce, rather than canned or jellied cranberry sauce, I used a Cranberry-Orange Relish that Publix grocery stores sell in their deli around the holidays. The results were a good blend of Dijon and cranberry flavors... but I still felt that this dressing was lacking something in its flavor profile. The recipe, as it stands, is very heavy on the sour end of the flavor spectrum. Tart cranberry relish (using canned or jellied might well sweeten it up some though), tart Dijon, sour vinegars (even rice vinegar is more sour than sweet)... I think this dressing needs something sweet to balance all that sour!

I plan to make this again for Christmas, but I am going to change it up slightly. I'm going to use jellied cranberry sauce, and make it a few days in advance, to allow the flavors to develop. At that point I'll see if I need to add some honey for balance. I already know I need to add more salt/pepper. A similar recipe called for 1/4 teaspoon for each, so I'll try that.

I liked this recipe a lot but next time will use 1/2 the amount of dijon mustard. It overwhelmed the cranberry flavour. Also made quite a bit so unless you have a large crowd--plan on storing at least 1/2 in a jar in refrigerator.

I really liked this dressing. It kind of reminded me of raspberry dressing, but without the pesky seeds. I only made 1/4 of the recipe, because I wanted a little salad dressing just for this evening. I followed the recipe. I then realized I forgot the garlic and it tasted fine. I used grapeseed oil for the walnut oil and safflower oil for the vegetable which was what I had on hand. For the cranberry sauce I used Trader Joes cranberry sauce with orange. Flavor works for me, just wish it was a little lower in calories. A little goes a long way on a salad though. ty

This dressing is pretty darn good! What a nice holiday flavor. The amount of dressing was too much for one or two people. Though, if you are having a small gathering (as we are) it is perfect. I used my fresh, home made cranberry sauce in it. Delish! I did not find the dijon over-powering. I used Maille Original Dijon.

This was pretty good but I wanted more cranberry flavor. I used whole berry cranberry sauce in a can and maybe that was the issue... I added about 2 Tbsp more at the end and didn't seem to affect it much, oh well. I also thought it could use a little sweetness so I added 2 tsp of maple syrup and it balanced it out. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and I would agree with CharlotteMay.  I'll try it with some honey or maple syrup next time. 

In addition, since adding a cup of vegetable oil seemed like a lot of oil (and calories) to me, I left it out.  Worked quite well and tasted great.  I also used Sweet Bavarian Mustard instead of Dijon.

Served it with Raclette and everyone liked it.  Also had it with Steak which was delicious.  Poured some on the plate, fried the steak and put it on the sauce with pears, kiwi and tomatoes on the other half of the plate.  No other spieces necessary.

Enjoyed this over a mixed salad with pomegranites, walnuts and feta.  Great combination and thinking of serving over the holidays when pomegranites are in season. Halving the recipe worked best.

Perfect and didn't change a thing.  Put it on leafy greens and served with pizza.  Would absolutely make this again.
