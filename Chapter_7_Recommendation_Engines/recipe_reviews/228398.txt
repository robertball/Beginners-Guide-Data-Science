What not to do....I did not have english cucumbers so I used normal ones. I also did not seed it. I think there is an error on the number of cups of Yogurt. I only added 2 cups and look how white it is! It is too liquidy. .no where looks like posted photo. They definitely did not use yogurt otherwise they would have lost the green color like I did.

i made this along with the curry chicken salad and it was a perfect way to cool off the heat of the curry. i just loved a bite of salad and a sip of soup. it couldnt have been more perfect.

I made this soup when I had my wisdom teeth taken out a few years ago and lived on a liquid diet for a week. It was a good way to get my veggies in!
