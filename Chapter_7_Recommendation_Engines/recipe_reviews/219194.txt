I haven't made this yet, but I will.  This gives me an idea!  It makes so much that it would be a nice item to send over to neighbors during the holidays.  It sounds yummy, but then again, I love pumpkin.  Thanks to Sasha's Catering!

I made this last night to ACCOMPANY THE PUMPKIN BREAKAST Casserole.  I am obviously a pumpkin nut!  I did not have cloves or cinnamon (I was as shocked as you are reading this) so doubled up on Pumkin Pie Spice and let me tell you...this was LIGHTS OUT!  Like pumpkin french toast and I also heated up the syrup when I served it.  Try This!!!

If you're a pumpkin lover, you'll love this.  I scaled down to 36 servings and put some in the freezer (hope that works?).  I made this to go with some gingerbread pancakes, and although the flavor was very complementary, it didn't present itself well on the pancakes.  This really is more of a "sauce" rather than a syrup IMHO.  A little sweet for us (but that's personal taste), but definitely tasty.   I can see serving this on a breakfast casserole, topping ice cream, etc., or as the recipe submitter mentioned, dipping a hot popover in this would be divine.  It certainly should kick start you into thinking Fall.
