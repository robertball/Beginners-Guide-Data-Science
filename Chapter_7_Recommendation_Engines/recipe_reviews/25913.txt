Yummy!  I changed this up a bit to make it a little more healthy.  I used brown rice, added peas and diced carrots, and I used low sodium soy sauce.  I sauteed the whites from the green onions with the peas and carrots while my rice was cooking.  I then added the rice to the veggies with about 1/4 cup soy sauce.  In a small skillet, I scrambled the 2 eggs and added to the rice with some ground ginger (I didn't have fresh) and the greens from the onions.  Whole thing took about 10 mintues to make and it turned out pretty good.  Brown rice made it a little too nutty, so next time I'll stick with white rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is good...don't really think it tastes too much like the stuff you get in take out....but still good.  You do need to make sure that you add the fresh ginger because without it...it is just too plain.  Thanks for the post.

I stirfried chopped green pepper in the sesame seed oil till tender then added frozen peas and carrots. Once the veggies looked good I added the rice and soy sauce. I scrambled the eggs right in the mix and it turned out delicious! Will make this often.

If your looking for a fried rice recipe as a main dish, keep looking BUT if you want it to accompany a meal (IE: Stir fry or asian beef skewers) this is a decent recipe. Its not too exciting but its a simple side dish. Was okay with our beef stir-fry.

I was impressed by how quick and easy this was... although taste-wise it was missing something. the ginger is the key ingredient. i'd make this again, but i'm still on the search for a better fried rice.

Have made several times... the missing ingredient? GARLIC! I used three cloves to the oil and it made a HUGE difference. If you like spicy, a pinch of chili flakes is really good, too.

I'm sorry but this was just terribly bland, even when I used a lot more soy sauce, there still wasn't much improvement.  I could only manage a couple bites before I gave up on it entirely. I won't be making this again, sorry.

This is a very good starting point for fried rice. I did a few things differently, such as refrigerating the rice after cooking it. I also added in a few more veggies (red peppers, zucchini, broccoli, whatever I had left over.) I also added some crumbled up cooked bacon. The sesame oil was a nice touch!

This was very good and quick, both my husband and I liked it!  It will be a regular staple in our house.  You can add any type of vegetable's you desire.  I didn't have any green onions so I just used regular white onions and green pepper.

This was a good Lenten meal.  I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and added peas and carrots, also sliced celery.  My husband enjoyed it.

Nope, will NEVER make this again.  It was very bland.  I did not use instant rice, but the result should have been the same.  Does not even come close to a fried rice taste.  I have read and heard that you should use day old rice to get that fried rice taste.  Won't ever make again.

I'd give it 4.5 stars. It's not bad for being exactly what I was looking for -- an easy, flavourful fried rice dish that wouldn't take me all night to prepare. I added shrimp, garlic and red peppers and they were all outstanding additions. Agree that it's the ginger that makes this dish.

This was good.  I added a clove of chopped garlic because after working in a Japanese Teppanyaki restaurant, I watched the chefs add plenty of garlic!  You may also want to add dashes of garlic salt and sesame seeds for authentic fried rice.  Overall, not bad and will easily compliment an Asian meal,it will not over power the other foods.  I served this with Peanut-Ginger Marinated Chicken from this website!

Nice easy recipe - one easy way to make it more meal like is to use only one egg and add baby shrimp - they do this in Taiwan and it is delicious.

I really enjoyed this recipe but found it just a bit flat in taste.  I made it exactly as written...not sure what I would do differently next time but will try some extra spices and add a few different veggies too.  Will be reading reviews for ideas.  But I had all the ingredients on hand and it worked out for me in that respect this time.

This is a great basic fried rice. I modify it by adding ginger and garlic paste, mixed with a little green chilly. I also add diced pieces of hot dogs or sausages. I've even tried adding pre-fried bacon bits. It always turns out good.

The addition of ginger root makes this a very unique dish.  This is now in my "favorite" recipe file.
