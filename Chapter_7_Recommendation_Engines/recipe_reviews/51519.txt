As a novice gourmet, I was a bit weary of this recipe because it called for a "double boiler", but I fashioned a makeshift one from a stainless steel bowl over a pot of about 1" of simmering water and this meal came out like I had been cooking for years! I'm proud to be the first to review this unique recipe! Thank you elfindancer!

I wish I could have rated this higher.  The recipe *sounded* yummy, and it was easy to put together.  There were a lot of different flavors, but it still needed - something.  I think that substituting gorgonzola for the provolone would have made this a winner...it needs a stronger cheese to balance out the sweetness of the sauce.  I'd give it another chance, though.

Good, but too sweet as written.  Next time will cut back on the sugar.

I made this dish according to the recipe, and it was awful! Neither my husband nor I could finish it, and I eat just about anything.  The sauce is literally nothing more than a custard, so what you're really making is chicken drenched in vanilla pudding.  Yuck!

This was not a favourite in our house.  It was quite a time consuming dish to prepare - definitely not a 20 minute prep time as indicated in the recipe - double that at least.  As with other reviewers, we found the sauce WAY too sweet - I reduced the amount of sugar and it was still too sweet - more appropriate for a dessert - in fact, we didn't even need dessert when we were done eating!  As well, I don't think provolone is the best cheese to use in this dish, something with a creamier texture - brie perhaps.

I substituted some onion for the shallots and swiss cheese for the provolone (because that's all I had available in the kitchen). After reading other comments, I decided to pull back on the sweetness by reducing the sugar to 2 Tbs and the vanilla to just over 1/4 tsp. I also added a splash of milk to thin the sauce out so that it wasn't too custard-like. The result was phenomenal! I will definitely make this recipe again... what a different way to prepare chicken.

Oh,Wow! Really great recipe.  I was a little skeptical about using such a sweet sauce on chicken, but it was really perfect just as written. My husband loved it.The chicken was very juicy. I did sprinkle sea salt inside the pocket and outside as well before putting the crumbs on. Baked in the tightest dish I could get it in, then poured the broth that cooked out back over the chicken.  I think the saltiness balanced the sweetness nicely.

This dish was good, very different. There are a lot of flavors going on.  I filled the chicken with apples and still only used half the apple. I found the apple to be the best part of the dish though and was sad when they were all gone.  As recommended I scaled back on the sugar, only 2 TBS and the sauce was still very sweet.  The sauce doesn't reheat very well though, the chicken reheats OK.  Thanks for the unique recipe.

This is very different from any chicken dish I ever made, so I tried to not judge it hastily, but instead took a few moments to truly savor it and decide whether or not I liked it.... and I did like it, with some adjustments. I read other reviews and noted that a couple folks thought the sugar amount was too much, so I, too, cut it back to 2 TBSP, but between that and the vanilla, I did still find the flavor a bit too sweet. I ended up putting salt and pepper on my cutlet to cut back the sweetness. I also subsituted almonds for pecans, because that's all I had on hand, and that worked fine. I had neglected to re-read the sauce preparation directions, and so I did not heat over a double boiler, but directly over a flame in a sauce pan, and it did make the egg yolks a little clumpy, not frothy, but taste-wise, it was OK. My husband said he enjoyed it, and that I should make this again. My children found it so-so, but again, I think because it was such an unfamiliar taste for chicken. I am giving this 4 stars, because I think the combination of ingredients was very unique (but taste-wise, I'd rate it a 3).

Super yummy and a repeat in our home. I substitute yellow onion for the shallot and add a bit of crumbled gorgonzola and decrease the sugar...which makes the recipe more sweet and savory, rather then being too sweet and rich.

the chicken was fantastic, but the sauce was a little too much for us.  I saved the sauce however, and it was fabulous on ice cream :>

My company enjoyed this chicken.. I halved the sugar and doubled the wine as otherwise it got too thick!  (different than others have said?)  I used swiss cheese and gala apple and found that combination was yummy!

I really liked this recipe. We didn't have white wine, so I subsituted apple juice, and my husband missed my note to reduce the sugar, so the sauce was definitely sweet, but still quite good. I think with the wine, and a little less sugar this would be great. Too much work to put it in my regular rotation, but a great every-now-and-then, special occasion recipe! Thanks!

Don't get me wrong, this is a good recipe. It's just that the sauce is so powerfully sweet that it overwelms the rest of the flavors. My guests did rave that it was an excellent meal. I used Gouda cheese; which is stronger than provolone, but it still needs something stronger. I'm thinking next time I'll use Blue Cheese and tart apples to try and even out the sweetness of the sauce.

Despite other reviews, I thought this recipe turned out really well. I did lower the sugar content, and although everyone said that it was too sweet, I somewhat expected that to begin with because of the ingredients. I only had cream cheese so I used that instead of provolone and poured the sauce over the chicken for the last 10 minutes of cooking and sprinkled the nuts on top of that. It carmelized nicely and was a great mix of flavors and textures. Thanks for the recipe.

I used sharp cheddar cheese and a McIntosh apple - worked great. I also used a difference sauce - made with white wine, chicken broth, sour cream, Parmesan cheese, cornstarch, lemon pepper and salt boiled down. I served the sauce on mashed potatoes with crunchy fried onions. A great dish - perfect for fall!

This recipe tastes DELICIOUS and it was pretty easy to make.  I still haven't figured out how to successfully make a "pocket" in the chicken breast, so I just kind of butterfly it open and fold closed once it's stuffed.  Toothpicks help to keep it together.  The first few times I made this, I did just the chicken without the sauce.  The sauce was an elegant addition when we had dinner guests.  I took the advice of others and cut the sugar to about 2 or 3 Tbsp, and it came out wonderfully!

The sauce was way way to sweet and the stuffing was lost in all the sweetness. I used this as a valentine dinner so the sweetness played out ok, I will never make this again.

My kids (7 and 11) LOVED this one!  It is really sweet, but delicious.  Its like having dessert for dinner!  If you don't have a sweet tooth like us, I too would suggest cutting back on the sugar.

We made a tailored version for Christmas Eve.  The chicken turned out really great.  We omitted the sauce though because it just seemed like it would be too much.  I also butterflied the chicken, pounded it to make it even, and secured it back together with toothpicks after filling it.  We added dried apricots and dried cherries to the recipe with the apples.  I think if I did it again, I would probably add a bit more flavor to the filling itself, perhaps a little cinnamon or something.  All in all, this was very good though.  We would make it again for sure.

This is a great dish, but I would add less sugar next time - a lot less. By the time I was halfway through the dish, it was too sweet to eat. I had to stop right there. The sauce is a bit rich, too. If you cut down on the sugar, probably by half or more, it would be amazing.

This recipe quickly became a favorite.  My fiance absolutely loves it, and requests it all the time.  It is so quick and easy to make, and it looks so elegant.  The sauce is wonderful, the shallots and the apples blend together in the perfect mix of sweet and sharp.  I just added a bit of salt and pepper to the chicken before I cooked it.  Cutting the pocket in the chicken is easy if you just keep the knife towards the top of the breast where there is a bit of a skin.  It works perfect for me everytime, but even if you get a hole in it, the taste is still excellent.

I made this chicken for the guys/ girls here at the fire house and it was great.  I substatuted white grape juice for the wine since we can't have wine here so the sauce was a little thin, but all in all was a GREAT meal.

This was excellent!  My corkscrew broke when trying to open the wine, so I ended up using apple cider instead.  I didn't decide this until after adding the sugar so it was very sweet, but still delicious!

My husband and I liked this recipe.  My children were iffy.  I made the chicken recipe for four and the sauce recipe for two.  I found that I only needed one apple and less than 1/4 cup milk.
My sauce never really thickened, but it tasted fine. (I guess I expected it to have the consistancy of hollandaise.)  Overall, I enjoyed this dinner and found the recipe easy and quick.
I will make again.

This was very exotic for a home cooked meal!  I loved it, but would cut sugar in half next time.  Delightful flavor.

I'm not a very experienced cook, but I had no trouble at all making this, and I LOVED it!  The sauce is very sweet, but I think the sharpness of the wine complimented the sweetness very well, and the whole combination of the sweet/sharp flavors in the sauce blended well with the apple, and complimented the chicken and cheese.  Very yummy!  I'll be making this again soon!

I made this recipe last noc, and thought it was delightful, especially the sauce. Next time I plan to add a little salt and use sharp cheddar in place of the Provolone.

We liked the combination of cheese, apples and onion stuffed into the chicken but hated the "way to sweet" sauce. I'll look for other sauces to use for this chicken if I decide to make it again

This was a tad sweet for my tastes, even after reducing the sugar to 2 TBS. I would advise reducing the vanilla instead, maybe by as much as half.

Husband loved it, but he did mistake the pecan cream sauce for trash and washed out the bowl before we were able to put it on the chicken. Had to make more; luckily, it doesn't take too long.

This is definitely an interesting dish.  The first bite is shocking, but the more you eat the more you love it!  The apple/shallot (or onion) filling was a bit too crunchy for our liking.  If I make this dish again, I will sautee the apples and shallots before stuffing the breasts.  Also, I agree with other reviewers that less sugar is better in the sauce.  All in all, with a bit of revision, this could could make a very impressive meal for guests!

I thought this would be alot more flavorful than it turned out to be. The sauce belongs on a dessert, not chicken! I only used 2 T. of sugar and it was still too sweet. Vanilla is a mistake too!

This recipes is great!  It seems elegant, yet is so easy and inexpensive!  The only thing that came up was that my chicken breasts were to thin to "stuff" so I would either fold them over the stuffing or use two and sandwich the stuffing.  The flavors are great and compliment each other!  It is so nice to find a great recipe that you can make for just yourself!

The stuffed chicken was really good. It doesn't need the sauce. My sauce was a DISASTER, which I'm sure was mostly my fault and not the fault of the recipe. But the meal was a big hit, and no one even suspected that there was missing sauce, so save yourself the hassle!

The chicken with the apples and cheese was great. The sauce never thickened and was way to sweet for us. We'd cut the sugar by at least half and maybe even more. We're going to experiment with some other sauces but the chicken half of the recipie deserves at least 4 stars.

I used a red Apple and not a Granny Smith and it still turned out delicious. It was sweet but with a side of wild rice it went well together. Also made a spinach salad with strawberries, pomegranate, left over pecans and poppyseed dressing! Delicious!!

The egg yolk sauce belongs on a dessert...not a savory chicken dish.  The cheese got lost in all the shallots and apples.  I only ate a few bites and then I had to stop...way too sweet!  Definitely won't be making this again.

This was excellent!  I used mozzarella instead of provolone as it is what I had on hand.  My son, who is a very picky eater, and does not care for chicken, loved it!  It is his new favorite chicken recipe.  He gobbled it up, as did the rest of the family.  You've got to try it!  Definitely will make for company!

The chicken wasn't that easy to slice and stuff, but the flavor was good.  The apples stayed crisp.  The sauce was WAY too sweet for me. I am more of a salty person.  Taste it before you put it on the chicken.  I served it on the side

It was ok, but not worth the effort it took to make.  Won't bother with it again.
