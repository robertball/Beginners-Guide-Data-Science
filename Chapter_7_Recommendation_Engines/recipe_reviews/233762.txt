Recipe Group Selection:  19, April 2014 ~ I admit to being a little weirded-out about the thought of potatoes in my Mexican food.  I tried it anyways, and we loved the combination.  I halved the recipe and it made more than enough for the 3 meals for my husband and I.  That's a good thing, now he has lunches this week!  We did not find the meat the least bit spicy despite the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce.  When serving, I layered the shells, shredded lettuce, the meat mixture, cheese, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.  A wonderful meal that will be a great summer addition to our menu when feeding a lot of people at the lake.  Thanks, cookingmakesmesmile for sharing your recipe.  This was a very good recipe group pick this week.

I tried this recipe for my family tonight. There are 5 of us so I doubled the recipe to insure left overs.  My husband and I enjoyed the recipe. I'm sorry I can't say the same for my kids. They love tacos so I thought this would be a nice variation. Way too spicy for my kids. I only used 3 chipotle peppers and added a small jar of roasted sweet peppers. Next time I'll substitute all chipotle for roasted sweet red peppers. 4 stars for adults and fail for kids.

Very very tasty! At first I thought it was going to be too spicy for me because I had my husband test the can of chiplotes for me since I'm a spice whimp. But once it was all put together it was perfect. I enjoyed the diced potatoes in it, as did everyone at my table. Topped my lightly toasted tostadas with cheese, lettuce, diced tomatoes, onion, sour cream and avocados. So yummy! Served with Spanish rice!

I made this for Recipe Group and it was a good choice. I thought we would miss the flavor of "taco seasoning" in the beef but we didn't miss it at all!   My fiancé and I thought the flavor from the chipotle peppers and sauce gave the mixture a wonderful, smokey, full flavor. The inclusion of chopped potatoes gave it an additional texture and taste that we both enjoyed. We added cheese, salsa and sour cream on top. I only wish I had avocados to add to the meal. Next time I will! I had a bit left for the next day and served in a warmed, soft flour tortilla. It was good too.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make it again.

Very good. I used Butterball fresh ground turkey instead of the beef. I also added tomatoes to the toppings and a bed of spinach on the tostadas but other then that I made this as written easy and delicious. A keeper in this household.

Made this for Recipe Group...If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would! I accidentally picked up chipotle sauce instead of chipotles in adobo sauce (they are in the same can), so I just omitted the water and used 1/2 can of that, which worked out great! The guys could not get enough of these...they kept saying how delicious they were, and hubby even said it is one of his new favorites (this is HUGE, lol). I served these w/ all the topping that usually serve with our tacos. This is a definite keeper, that I know I will be making often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I liked this, but my husband LOVED it.  It's pretty spicy, so in the future I will cut down the chipotle peppers--but it is good!!!

This. Stuff. ROCKED!  SO good!  At first, I was a little worried about the spiciness of the meat/potato combo, but by the time you assemble the tostado with (in our case refried beans), lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, and sour cream, you don't even notice the heat ... just that lovely lovely chipolte smokiness.  YYUUMMM!  Who would've though potatoes would work SO well on a tostado???? Can't thank you enough for recipe!  Oh - side note  we also cut recipe in half and there was more than enough for 4 people.

I used Johnsonville's Italian sausage instead of the ground beef. I chose this recipe because tostadas are one of my favorite Mexican comfort food and bring me back memories of my childhood in Mexico. Johnsonville's mild Italian sausage was perfect for this.I only used half of a tablespoon of olive oil as the sausage can be oily and sauteed some garlic as well with the onions and potatoes. I didn't need to season the meat because it is spicy enough as it is. I substituted the chipotle peppers for the chipotle sauce that comes in a can which is much milder. I spread some re-fried beans on top of the tostada and used lettuce, red onion, sour cream,  Mexican crumbling fresh cheese, the sausage with potatoes and avocado as toppings. It was really good!!

Awesome recipe.  Perfect as written.  We added a layer of refried beans to the tostada to stretch the meal, but the meat mixture fantastic by itself!

Recipe Group: everyone at the dinner table agreed that this was delicious! I cut the recipe in half, and the portions are very generous; had enough beef for 6 or 7 tostadas, not just 4. I'm not gonna lie, never used chipotle in adobo before, I was nervous because DS and I don't care for hot stuff...however, this dish was not spicy and DBF had to add salsa to his. Served with rice that had corn, tomatoes and cumin stirred in, very good and would make this again!

I thought this was really good and it received great feedback from the rest of my "eaters".  I started out with half the amount of chipotles and after tasting decided to go with the full amount.  It was not too spicy for any of us, but I suppose this could also depend on the size of peppers you use.  I used 96% lean ground beef and my mixture turned out a bit dry.  I think the recipe could use a little more liquid which is a very easy fix.  I topped with tomatoes, sour cream and cheese but was really wishing from some salsa to put on top. Tip:  If you don't want to dirty your blender, put your peppers and water in a large measuring cup and use an immersion blender.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe, cookingmakesmesmile!

11.4.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233762/chipotle-beef-tostadas/ ... I chopped a can of chipotle peppers, mixed with the adobo sauce' used 2T of that.  'Seems one or two more Ts would improve, but still good with 2.  I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of precooking & draining the meat; added after onions & potatoes danced.  Ohhhh, wait!  I did something else.  I added a half can of refried beans to the mixture - as glue.  It was a weak glue, but it helped.  :D

I made this recipe several times and my family really love it. There is a little variation to it, I added refried beans to the tostadas and used queso fresco to top them as well as avocado wedges. Great recipe!

Used ground turkey instead of beef, next time will use beef. Be careful if you buy a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce as there is way more than 2 peppers in the can! Next time will serve as soft shell tacos. Didn't really care for the corn tostadas. Very good!

The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half. We thought it was OK. I didn't care for the potatoes in the meat mixture.

used one lb of ground chuck, 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce,  one medium potato and half of a large onion.  I used the amount of seasoning recommended for 2 lbs of ground beef. Honestly this was so bland, so blah.  Glad I didn't waste 2 lbs of ground chuck on this recipe. Threw the rest out. Sorry but this was just not the flavorful dish I was expecting.

Very good, I would like to tweak some...didn't have garlic salt, so used garlic powder, not sure if that changed the taste much, but I want to ditch the seasoning salt and use taco seasoning instead.

I couldn't really just find two chipolte peppers in adobo sauce, they were chopped up, so I used the whole can, it was pretty small and it was the perfect amount.  Also I only used 1lb of ground beef, I misread the recipe, and I think it was for the better..can't imagine this with 2lbs and it would dilute the flavor

We've been eating these since birth! :)  
These are just chalupas compuesta (with everything) without the beans.  Picadillo con pappas (beef meat with potatoes) is always tasty if seasoned correctly.  also nice and greasy!

This was perfectly delicious. End of story. Made it exactly like the recipe, only I made half as much. Was more than enough for my husband and me, with plenty of leftovers. Spicy, but not too spicy. The potatoes add a nice texture and flavor, and it was easy to make. This is a DEFINITE keeper for us. Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe Group selection for April 19, 2014 – This had a kick!  We thought it was very tasty, with the exception of my husband who thought it was too spicy.  I served the beef on shredded lettuce and topped with the Mexican cheese blend, avocado, sour cream, and salsa.  Yum!

Others have commented on how they weren't so sure about the potatoes in this.  I thought they were a nice addition, some of the fast food places have burritos with potato in them.  I worried about it being too spicy but it was not - it was just right.  I would make again.

I made this for Recipe Group. I really liked this and plan to make it again. I was afraid the sauce would make it too spicy, so I took some of the meat out for my son before adding the sauce. However, I didn't think it was very spicy after cooking and think DS would have been fine with it. My hubby wasn't too excited about the potatoes in it, but I thought they were great. We added our favorite taco toppings on top too, and that made it even better.

Did this for recipe group. We really liked it. It seemed to be crying out for something tomatoey. DS added salsa and hubby and I, chopped tomatoes. I was a bit freaked out by using potatoes but they were a nice addition. I have a heat wimp in the house who did not find this too spicy but I think it was on the border. I like recipes that aren't complicated or take too long. This was a good one. She's a keeper. Thanks cookingmakesmesmile!
