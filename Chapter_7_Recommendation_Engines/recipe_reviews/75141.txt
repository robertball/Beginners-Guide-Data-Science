Very easy recipe and really delicious!  I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used half sesame oil and half olive oil.  Also, I used previously crushed garlic--about 1 tsp. and fresh basil--about 1-2 tbsp.--along with a few squeezes of lemon juice.  We don't have a pan grill, so I just marinated everything together for about 40 min while waiting for my husband to get home, and then sauteed it all on the stovetop in a big skillet with the lid on.  The bell peppers stayed a little crunchy, which was nice, yet the yellow onion was nice and sweet.  We put it on top of linguine with fresh cooked spinach on the side.  Definitely something we'll make again!

Made this yesterday for dinner with a few changes. First I used extra virgin olive oil, but only half as much as called for. For the other half I used Sesame oil. Then I added a half teaspoon of ground Ginger. I also used a Red Onion.Then I marinated all the ingredients for 4 hours in the refrigerator. Didn't have any skewers or grill, so placed the veggies in a 13 x 9 x 2" baking dish with the marinade. Covered with foil and baked on the center level at 350 deg. for 25 minutes. Removed from oven and layered the shrimp on top of the veggies, recovered and baked for an additional 10 minutes. served with mini corn bread loaves and a green salad. Came out great. The wife loved it and so did I. will definately be making this again. It's a keeper for sure.

This was good.  I added garlic cloves to the skewers (right next to the shrimp pieces) my family likes garlic.    It was very flavorful.   Thanks for a great recipe.

Good! I wish I would have marinated longer than 20 minutes, as the shrimp wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping for. I added green bell pepper chunks and halved mushrooms to my skewers and cooked on the grill. Thank you!

This was really good! I did let the shrimp and veggies marinate for about an hour and added mushrooms and zucchini to it. I cooked them outside on the grill as well. I will be making this again. Thanks!

after reading the review that was most helpful to people i found this amazing. absolutley great... i over cooked the shrimp which was a bummer,  I also used yellow peppers and orange peppers in addition to the red.  I bought one of those combo packs of peppers... cut them up, used a little of each and then froze the rest.  The yellow peppers tasted the best to me.  Very happy i found something that worked teh first time! thanks a lot of the recipe

This marinade recipe was very nice.  The taste was subtle but very pleasing.  I marinaded the shrimp for 30 minutes and use pre-minced garlic.  It was really delicious.  My family really enjoyed this.  I made half of my shrimp with this recipe and half with the Mexican Shrimp and Vegetables Kabobs recipe and they liked both.

This is a great marinade recipe!  I did make a couple of changes so I'm only giving the original 4 stars.  First, I added more veggies to the mix (zucchini and mushrooms).  Also, I used skewers and put them on my outside grill-- turned out great!  If you are worried about overcooking the shrimp, put them on a separate skewer, but mine turned out near-perfect (oh, I used key west pink shrimp-- sweet and tender).  Next time I might add a little more pepper or tobasco sauce.  And I am a spice wimp! Anyway, great overall recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as it said and it came out perfect.  I did let it marinate for about 2 hours.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Cool recipe - I tried pretty much the same thing, and found I was able to add a lot of flavor by adding fresh parsley and also, very importantly, tomato paste, schiracha thai hot sauce, and lemon juice to the marinade.  Cooking the vegetables along with the shrimp works great either on the grill, ni a skillet, or under a broiler, as they are all about equally dense and cook perfectly together.  Don't marinade the shrimp longer than ~25 min if you add lemon juice as the shimp will become tough.  Serve on top of vermicelli pasta with parmesan cheeze, olive oil, and fresh cracked pepper.

These are pretty good.  I marinated them for 4 hours and they still weren't very flavorful, I can't imagine only marinating them for 20 minutes.  I love garlic and I love balsamic and I was hoping for something just a little more spectacular I guess.

Great flavor.  We used a grill basket on the barbeque to cook everything.  Since the peppers and onions take way longer than the shrimp, we put them on first to cook for a while, then added the shrimp.

This recipe was OK but seemed to lack flavour.  Perhaps it was the balsamic I used, but I usually love the taste.  We kicked it up with some lemon juice nad pepper to finish off the batch, but I won't be making these again.

Pretty good, but you really have to like balsamic vinegar.  Mine ended up being marinated for a long time as we had company over and then forgot about em.  LOL  I made no changes or additions to this recipe.

I made exactly as written except I cooked in a skillet instead of skewering.  The dish was missing something...I added salt and pepper after it was served and it helped a little.  Will make again but need to add some spices.

I was disappointed with the flavor of these shrimp.  I was looking for something a little more "intense".  The recipe was easy to make but I probably won't make it again.

this came out so delicious! made some minor alterations but stayed true to the recipe.. cut the recipe in half but used 1 lb of large shrimp and left out the veggies.. cut the olive oil to just a drizzle.. upped the garlic to 3 cloves and basil to 3/4 tsp.. threw everything in my ninja to blend and marinated the shrimp for 30 min's.. i sauteed the shrimp in a pan (we weren't grilling today).. took them out.. added the leftover marinade and reduced it a bit.. and threw the shrimp back in to coat..  not the most beautiful thing in the world but wow the flavors were out of this world.. i'm sure the onions and peppers would have gone really well with this as the original recipe intended.. ty for the recipe

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!!! I also marinated broccoli with the rest of everything and then steamed it- amazing! Will definitely make again!
