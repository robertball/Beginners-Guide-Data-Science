I made this for a baby shower, but I revised it a bit, using the technique I saw on a video on this website: I mixed the concentrates, the powdered sugar, 2 cans of water & some (sorry, I'm not much of a measurer), Margarita mix for flavor in a bowl. Then I poured the mixture into a plastic bag that was inside a pitcher for stability (the recipe is best divided into 2 gallon size zip lock bags). Then, I put those in the freezer over night (or however long ahead you want). Then just before serving, I put the frozen mixture in a punch bowl and added two cans of lemon-lime soda and two cans of club soda and mixed it until it was all slushy. Everyone loved it and said it was very refreshing!...and I only now realized I forgot to add the garnish of thinly cut limes!

Really good!  Small recipe so I doubled it, and we still finished it with just a few of us.  Next time I'm spiking it...sounds great with tequila and margarita mix!

This has become my go-to punch for large groups of people. I first tried it for a friends baby shower.  When adults only, I leave the bottle of tequila next to the punch bowl.

This punch is fantastic! I threw in some grapefruit juice because I love grapefruit maragaritas and I added one liter of ginger ale to stretch it a bit without affecting the flavor.
