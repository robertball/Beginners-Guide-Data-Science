A friend's mom had made these cookies years ago and I really liked them. Although there are amny variations of this recipe I like this one the best. I am a fan of the almond flavor and the cream cheese. Plus these look very pretty for the holidays.

These were good right out of the oven...a little too rich for my taste but still good. However they don't keep. I had them sealed airtight at room temp for two days and then they tasted like playdough.

Used Honey bunches of oats instead of corn flakes (only needs about 1 cup) - sweet and simple nothing to write home about.

This was pretty good. I had never had anything like it before but enjoyed it.

For our family Christmas gathering when I was first married my sister-in-law asked me to find and make cornflake cookies like my husband's grandmother had made when they were kids. I had never heard of them but looked on Allrecipes and found these cookies. I continue to make them every Christmas and they continue to be a favorite.

Fast easy delicious! What more can I say? As much as I like trying new things I will likely do this again. The only thing I did different from the recipe was I used Cinnamon Frosted Flakes to roll the cookies in rather than regular corn flakes.
