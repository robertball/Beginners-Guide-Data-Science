I'm only giving this a 2-star rating as the recipe asks for wayyyy to much of the spices (especially salt), so much so, that it becomes nearly unpalatable. At 1500mg of sodium per serving this will send someoneâ€™s blood pressure into overdrive.

I will make this again though, because I think it has promise, but I will cut the salt down to 1/4 tsp, the mustard to 1 tbsp, the pepper to 1/2 tsp and the garlic powder to 1/2 a tsp as well.

Quick and easy!  I like the fact that mayonnaise is not needed for this sandwich filling!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but not too much flavor. I will make a couple changes the next time I make this. I'm going to try chopped onion instead of the chopped celery. Also going to add some lime juice. I might even add a chopped jalapeno or two for a little kick.

This was OK. I liked the idea of using avocado and mustard in place of mayo, but honestly I missed the mayo! The eggs and avocado together were good, but I didn't care for the mustard flavor (even reduced to 1 TBSP, as suggested by another reviewer). Might try it with a TBSP of mayo next time...still less than I would normally use. 1/4 tsp. of salt, 1/8 tsp. of pepper and 1/8 tsp. of garlic powder were quite enough for me.

I really like egg salad. Love that no mayo is needed and the avocado made a very nice touch. Loved it and will make again! Thanks!

Personally, I liked this recipe very much, just one suggestion, if you're going to share it with other people, leave the salt and pepper out and let them add their own. I just did the spices to taste. I also didn't finely chop the celery, i like it in bigger chunks, and added onions, and used a whole avocado instead of just half.

I've converted: I have no desire to ever make egg salad with mayo again. This was surprisingly delicious! I omitted the celery and used just a dash of garlic powder and seasoned salt. I may or may not have eaten the whole batch for dinner.

When I read this recipe, at first I couldn't believe I'd never thought of using avocado in place of mayo!  MIND BLOWN.  Then I made it and put it on some organic multigrain bread and OH MY GAWD it was the best sandwich I've had in a looooong time.  It took no time to make and the texture is amazing with the soft egg and avocado and crunchy celery.  Next time, I might play around with adding some herbs for more nutrients and some onions for some zing. Excellent recipe!

Tried your recipe last night for a quick dinner. My roommates thought it was very good and very tasty. It was gone before I knew it, so next time I will make sure to double the portions.

Delicious!  Like other reviewers, I used 6 eggs & a whole avocado.  I used grainy mustard, a pinch of sea salt, and finely diced red pepper.  I will definitely make this again.

I really rate this more than Five star is actually 8 for the idea
what needs adjusted  1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. pepper change 
dry mustard to 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/3 tsp garlic powder not salt ,1 avocado. Again  add a small amount of mayo or change the name to Avocado salad not egg salad. just avaocado alone is too dulse. Bon appetit. Chef Doug!

Tried this recipe for my daughter-in-law's Vintage Baby Shower and it was a hit!  The cranberry/walnut chicken salad sandwich I also served was made with mayo and I wanted another sandwich without it.  I was not disappointed.  The only change I made was using red pepper in place of the celery, not for taste but for color and I used yellow mustard.  Yummy, yummy, yummy and very tasty indeed!

I didn't use celery because I don't like my egg salad to be that crunchy. This was delicious! I had never thought of using avocado in place of mayo. I'm glad I found this, I'm trying to cut mayo out of mine and my family's diet. Great recipe!

I LOVED this! I used 5 eggs, 1 whole avocado and substituted red bell pepper for the celery. I added the seasonings to taste so I can't say how much I used. Absolutely delicious. Perfect for a sandwich lunch!

This recipe is delicious and healthy.  The fat in the avocado is the "good cholesterol", which certainly beats the "bad cholesterol" in mayonnaise.  Since I changed to olive oil almost exclusively, and I eat at least 4 avocados a week, my cholesterol medication has been a thing of the past.  They really mean it when the commercial says "Eat more avocados".

My husband and I like our foods salted "differently", so I make this spread with no salt and we each salt our sandwiches the way we prefer.  Also, I think the amount of mustard is perfect, but we both really LIKE mustard.  I can imagine those who don't would think the amount of mustard should be adjusted down.

But, I feel that without any changes, this egg salad ROCKS!

Fantastic. I used one whole avocado and some crushed chilis. Also I used Dijon Mustard and because of that it was too strong so I had to correct adding some yoghurt and pickels water. Next time I would add half the amount of Dijon mustard keeping th pickles water and chilis.

I really liked this. Simple, different, and good. I don't like celery, so I subbed red bell pepper instead. Also reduced mustard to 1 tsp. and salt and pepper to taste (less than called for). One tsp. of garlic powder was a bit much; will reduce next time.

I have never had egg salad......until now!! WOW! I am not a fan of mayo.  I use very little or modify to not use it. I saw this in the magazine and had to try it.  I had a sandwich after I made it and one at 9am this morning!! I used 5 eggs and a whole - large avocado, lots of cracked black pepper.  Mustard to taste and just to bind, the avocado does great binding a flavor on its own.  I also had some yellow onion and green pepper - I added to taste, not too much.  I did not add the garlic powder I might later.  This is a for sure go to for me from now on!! Thank you!!

This was very yummy. I did add the full avocado, a little mayo, onions and cayenne pepper. Topped the sandwich with tomato slices and crispy bacon. Perfect way to use up those hard boiled eggs from Easter!

Delicious, makes a nice light lunch. I rolled it up on a ice berg lettuce leaf, no need for bread. For those that  have gluten issues it is great. Thank you for sharing..

The first time I made this it was good. The second time, not so good. I suppose you have to get it just right and not deviate much from the recipe.

This was really tasty, but it called for way too much salt and seasonings. The palate is right, just a large reduction in salt and seasonings. Maybe 1/4tsp to even an 1/8 of a tsp of each of the seasonings.

To make it taste like real egg salad: Add olive oil and vinegar! 

Adds the creaminess and tang that you get with real mayo, and really takes this recipe to the next level.

I probably added about a tablespoon of each. Also definitely added less salt and pepper, and I think it could have even used less.

After reading some of the other reviews about the seasoning being too much I decided to put in half of the salt, garlic and pepper that it called for.  It was still a little too salty.  I would probably use 1/2 tsp of salt, taste it and then add more if needed. My kids and husband won't eat mayonnaise so they normally won't eat egg salad which I love.  They actually enjoyed this and said they want to have it again sometime!

Wonderful but doesn't stay fresh very long. Had to add a little bit of mayo so it stayed together better. Overall a simple and tasty meal that me and boyfriend enjoyed on fresh bread

This was ok. I think I prefer the taste of mayo in my egg salad just because I'm used to it. Also, I made this the night before and didn't think about the avocado browning. IF I make this again, I will use immediately.

Nice twist on the usual egg salad.  I used half the salt and mustard.  I would add some cumin and chopped jalapeno next time for a little kick.  This works fine if you just hard boil eggs like you normally would. Eat it all in one sitting though ... the avocado turns a nasty moss green color the next day, even in an airtight container.

This is a good recipe for a "lighter" avocado egg salad since it omits the mayo. I just put in a couple shakes of salt and a few twists of the pepper grinder, as well and a little onion powder and paprika in addition to the garlic powder. I also used 5 eggs and a whole avocado to make it go a little further. Tasty!

Way too salty! I'll try it again with a tiny amount of salt. Leaving out the mayo is a good thing, but I think I'll add just a little next time.

I love this idea and my husband and I both thought the sandwiches were tasty.  To me, both avocado and egg are ingredients that desperately want salt so I did add a bit more than specified in the recipe.

This was delicious as written! Perfect amount of spices and mustard for me. I had it on Ezekiel bread, and this is the first filling lunch I have had since trying to watch what I eat! Will make this again and again! Thank you!

This is an awesome concept. I tweaked it a little. Mine was 6 eggs, 1 whole avocado, 1 tablespoon mustard and then the pepper and garlic powder. It mixed well and was super great tasting! I would recommend this to anyone!!
