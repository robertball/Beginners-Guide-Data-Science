On the rare occasion I make Nanaimo bars but when I do it is a minty one.  The difference in mine is that I substitute creme de menthe liqueur  for the milk and omit peppermint extract.

These are good, but a little too minty for me and my kids.  The hubster loved them though.  I will make these again, but cut down on the mint flavouring a little.

This was delectable, especially the filling, and a great way to use up some mint chocolate chips that were on sale.  Per another reviewer on this site, I substituted vanilla cook-and-serve (NOT INSTANT) pudding mix for the custard powder.

Did not work at all. Way to minty. Centre was too soft, melted. Chocolate topping was impossible to spread and then hardened into a rock.
