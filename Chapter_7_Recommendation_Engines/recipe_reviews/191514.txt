I have gluten issues and altered this recipe for GF buckwheat pancakes - adding the wild rice to them gave them a whole new and pleasant flavor - thanks for the idea

The nutmeg really makes these good! I made these with whole wheat flour and soy milk for my family's tastes.  This is a recipe I'll be using again!

These were good, but nothing to write home about.  I have had more flavorful pancakes, although the nutmeg was nice.  I followed the recipe exactly. Just a plain kind of pancake, we had them for supper but I love that they have the nutrition from this native grass of our state-WI.  Also, the rice called for is not cooked as mentioned in the previous review.  The ratio for wild rice is usually 4 to one, depending on how much of the hull is removed during processing.  So start with 1 1/4 cups of raw wild rice.

Very good and different.It is 1-1/4 cooked rice. You can't tell the rice is in it if cooked all the way.I used all wheat flour. 3 out of 4 liked it a lot. The other 1 wanted banana pancakes, so I made a couple- After placing pancakes on griddle, add sliced bananas on top so they cook with 2nd side and brown. If you've never had banana pancakes, the bananas taste very different when cooked-way better!

These were just okay.  Not good or bad. The rice just gave the pancakes a bit of an odd texture.  The flavor was good, though.

Good with applesauce. Great with maple syrup. The batter was awfully thin and made dense pancakes. My second try was with with half the water, more eggs and double the wild rice. It makes a hearty nutty pancake.

I doubled the vanilla and didn't have enough nutmeg so I added some cardamon and they were very good.  For half the batch I also added some chopped fresh cranberries  which my husband and I enjoyed but the kids not so much.
