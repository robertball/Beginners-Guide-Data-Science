These turned out great..at first I was worried because it looked like there were too much fruit compared to the dry ingredients..(i cut the recipe down to 6 using the calculator provided bye allrecipes, so maybe that is why)However they turned out nice! Thank you for an easy quick recipe..p.s. so hot here i even cooked them on the bbq outside this morning and they raised nice and were moist :-)
