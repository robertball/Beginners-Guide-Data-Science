These were fun to make and I really enjoyed the addition of cottage cheese. My filling did turn out a little watery so I had to add some breadcrumb to make sure it stayed in the slipper while baking. My slippers were good and drained but maybe I should have drained some of the excess water off of the zucchini flesh too. This is a great way to use up your harvest from the garden!

We love stuffed zucchini so when I saw this recipe I had to try it.  After reading a couple reviews and the recipe I agreed that this would need breadcrumbs so I added 1/4 cup.  Also added 1 minced clove of garlic and 2 tbsp of grated parmesan cheese as the recipe itself looked a little dull in flavour.  I made them ahead of time in the morning (stuffed and all) and put them in the fridge until dinner time.   I added about 10 minutes cooking time.  Next time I think I would do them on 375F instead of 350F

Good side dish addition to our Thanksgiving dinner.  Next time I will steam the zucchini as it came out too soft

I used Parmesan instead of Colby (not a fan of orange cheese) and dried parsley instead of fresh because I didn't have fresh.  This may have been why I didn't have the "slippage" problem others experienced.  I didn't add any bread crumbs but everything stayed in place nicely.  It was kind of bland though.  More spices next time, I think, but there will definitely be a next time!

It was good. 

After reading Soup Loving Nicole I should have added breadcrumbs. I didn't taste the cheese. I didn't add the bell peper.
