this was exactly what i wanted, very tasty...i wanted kind of a simple nicoise salad type tuna salad and this was it. after tasting the initial combination with only 1 tblspn of olive oil, i did add garbanzo beans for fiber. eaten with low-fat triscuits made for a very nutritious, low-cal, low-fat light lunch/snack.

This turned out okay, but I would recommend a bit less garlic and half the lemon juice, or a bit of lime juice for extrea tang.  It tasted good and I woul reccomend it on Saltines.

My advice if you would like to make a sandwich from this (or serve on a bed of lettuce if watching carbs) is to half all of the ingredients, except the tuna and lemon juice, and process all of those together.  Then just add that mixture to the drained tuna and mix it with a fork, then squeeze the lemon on top.  If you process the tuna also, then it just turns into a spread, which may or may not have been the original authors intention.  All in all it is very flavorful.

This was great! I used this as the filling for a lettuce wrap. As a carb alternative, this was great with lettuce and black beans. No salt necessary, served with a side of avocado and tomato wedges. Vwah-lah! Lunch.
