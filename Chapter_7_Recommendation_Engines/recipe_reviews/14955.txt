I prefer either plain baked sweet potatoes or with brown sugar and marshmellow. some folks might enjoy this. I didn't and won't make again even though we love yams and sweet potatoes.

My whole family loved this dish - and they don't normally like sweet potatoes at all. My step dad ate his skin and all!

For me I think there was just too much going on. The sweet of the potatos the savory of the mixture and the citrus of the orange peel was just...overwhelming. Guess I prefer something a little more simple for my beloved sweet taters.

There was not enough of any one seasoning group to be anything but bland

I had to exchange a few ingredients for some others so mine turned out more sweet than anything but we really enjoyed it!
