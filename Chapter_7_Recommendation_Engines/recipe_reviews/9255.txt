THIS IS A SUPERB RECIPE..IF THE INGREDIENTS ARE RIGHT. YOU SHOULD USE 1 CAN OF COCONUT MILK, 1 CAN CONDENSED MILK, 1 CAN EVAPORATED MILK, 3 EGG WHITES. SUGAR TO TASTE, CINNAMUN TO TASTE, AND WHITE BACARDI TO TASTE & IT SHOULD BE A HIT. ALSO, ALL SHOULD FIT IN THE BLENDER

Really good recipe. I use this recipe when I have the time, but I have since found a pre-mixed Coquito called Mi Abuela that is extremely close to homemade. I bought it at Big 3 Wine & Liquor in the Bronx on E. Tremont Ave. If you don't have time to make your own, or want a back up, definitely check it out. I know this may not be useful info to members of a site like "all recipes", but just wanted to share it just in case!

I've made "Coquito" before, and I  recommend for the readers to use a can coconut cream instead of the coconut milk- as the cream is much sweeter.You could also use 6 egg yolks instead, and one quart of half and half.These three basic ingredients- excluding the rum, and nutmeg/cinnamon- is all you really need.Serve over ice.(Double-up recipe if making for a large group.)

i tried this recipe. its not bad, but not great. being from miami i am use to authentic spanish cuisine and what not, but i have always seen my in-laws make this with cinnamon sticks... perhaps that is the difference or why it is not an outstanding recipe. the cinnamon sticks are suppose to kinda marinate and infuse into the coquito, then be strained out after a few days.

I use this eggnog as a substitue for the traditional one made with milk products. I am lactose intollerant. Make sure you use unsweetened coconut milk. A very good eggnog!

I followed the instructions as closely as possible, but mine didn't turn out.  It had a grainy taste (probably from the coconut).  I wouldn't try it again.

make sure you use coconut milk, because if you use shredded coconut, like the review above, it will come out grainy...

This is a very good drink, made it last year and looking forward to it this holiday.  It takes time and cost can add up depending upon how much you make.  I made it for gifts last year and it was a hit.  Enjoy!!

Like another reviewer, I followed the recipe, but it turned out "grainy."  I used this recipe because I mistakenly bought coconut milk instead of coconut cream.  I had added a can of condensed milk instead of the sugar, but I don't think that was what made it grainy.  It seems like it is some of the solids from the coconut milk perhaps?  Maybe I didn't use the right kind of strainer?  Regardless, I wasn't pleased with the recipe unfortunately.

Wonderful New Years eggnog for those with dairy allergies / lactose intolerance or a desire not to have such a HEAVY feeling to their eggnog.  We made this recipe for 6 and it was a hit.

Pretty good for eggnog but a little tricky to make. "Scald" really isn't helpful; the key is to get the milk to JUST the right point, meaning heated up enough so that when you add the 1/2 cup to the eggs, it heats up the temperature of the eggs (so that they will not be shocked and thus cooked when you add them to the pot).  I sprikle the top w/cinnamon after I pour it into my punchbowl.

Waaaay too much egg. I was able to salvage the recipe, sort of, by adding more fluids to balance out the egg a little, adding some egg whites to balance out the absurd yolk flavor and texture that was overpowering, and then after I was finished, adding in yet more just straight milk. It had developed a light meringue, it was so eggy. Also it wasn't sweet enough originally; added a can of cream of conconut when I was adding fluids. 

I would try starting with two whole eggs next time, one cup of cream of cononut to replace one can of coconutmilk, and start there.

This coquito was good but not as sweet as I would have liked.  My extended family makes it and it wasn't the same.  It may have been the kind of coconut milk I used.  I would try it again with a different brand.

Definitely plan on lots of requests for this great recipe!  I couldn't fit all ingredients into a blender, but as long as you blend the The coconut cream thoroughly to remove lumps, the rest can be mixed by hand.  I couldn't find coconut milk so I substituted an additional 1/2 a can of coconut cream and added some water.  It was the hit of the holiday!

It was really good. Instead of using sugar I used sweetened condensed coconut milk, 3 cups of coconut milk, 1 cup of cinnamon water (boiled 3 sticks of cinnamon in a pot of water), and reduced it to 6 egg yolks instead of 8.  Everyone loved it.
