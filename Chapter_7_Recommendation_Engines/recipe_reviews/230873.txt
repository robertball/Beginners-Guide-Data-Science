These wings were a hit. I actually did not pre-marinade and they sat in marinade for only 15 mins. prior to baking. I like a crispier wing and baked them at 450 instead of 375. They were tasty and quick. I  was able to find a last min. sauce and it worked out well.

I was a little scared by the "too mustardy" comment, but these were SOOO GOOD! --just like "honey barbeque" type wings you might get at a restaurant.  Didn't taste mustardy at all. (I used a mix of spicy mustard and dijon mustard...not sure how it would taste with yellow mustard.) I added some onion powder and garlic powder, and cooked some sauce with the wings--the sauce gets super gooey--my daughter said it was the best chicken she's ever had.  This was the first time I have ever made wings from scratch, and I will be making them again!  Thanks for the recipe!  I didn't even marinate and they were still amazing!

Love this!!!  I used half dijon mustard and half yellow.  We grilled the chicken.  Make sure if you grill put it over indirect heat and watch as the sauce can burn easily because of the sugar.  My picky kids liked it and my husband and I can't wait to try it on baby back ribs.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

My family really enjoyed this!  We are not big fans of mustard, so I used 1/2 cup mustard and 1/2 cup barbeque sauce.  They really liked them!  This was my first time cooking chicken wings and it was really easy and yummy!

Thank you Allrecipe cooks. I changed the recipe to 1/2 Dijon and 1/2 yellow mustard and it was perfect.

This is great!  Did half regular/half dijon mustard.  Forgot to reserve marinade so just poured small amount of remaining marinade over wings (cooked on jelly roll pan) and basted with sauce in pan several times while cooking.  Next time will definitely add red pepper flakes for some heat.

These were sooo good!  My company was late, so I lowered the heat and kept them in the oven longer than the recipe called for... I am so glad I did because the wings got even more sticky and golden.  I also topped with sesame seeds and chives once they were done.  Awesome!

This recipe was AMAZING!  My husband loves wings, but doesn't care for spicy ones. These had a sweet BBQ flavor to them. I don't normally rate a recipe that I have altered, because I don't think it's fair, but I will say that I made one small adjustment.  Instead of yellow mustard, I used 1/2 cup honey mustard and 1/2 cup dijon mustard (as some of the other reviewers have stated) Also, if I were to offer an additional tip, I would maybe use a disposable tray when making these.  I used a cookie sheet wrapped in aluminum foil, but the glaze seeped through and made a gooey mess on the sheet.  However, well worth the clean-up! :)

As I was sitting in the living room pondering something different I can do with my chicken wings, I stumbled across this recipe, and was stunned at the simplicity and flavor! 
My method of preparation was a little different, I heated the brown sugar, soy, and Mustard mixture to dissolve the sugar and blend the flavors. I then added 1tsp of melted butter (serving the purpose of a liaison), and deep fried my chicken wings in regular canola oil, then tossed the wings in the glaze. It tuned out wonderful!!!! but different than the usual oriental or buffalo flavors. You can get so creative with this versatile sauce!

These were delicious!! Even my picky 7 year old devoured them! (She hates everything except cereal) I made them exactly as written although I did up the temp to 450 and cut about 20 mins off the cooking time. The chicken was juicy, the skin was crispy, and the sauce was sticky, PERFECTION!!

Given that there are just a few ingredients this recipe was excellent. I went with 1/2 c. of mustard and 1/2 cup of barbeque sauce(original open pit) Thanks Rebecca this one will go into my rotation!

As the name says, it was easy and yes they were delicious! Following the direction of many other reviewers, I did half Dijon and half prepared yellow mustard. I should note I did forget to reserve some of the sauce and actually baked the wings in the sauce. Oops and oh well, it didn't seem to matter :)

These were easy and delicious. I used half yellow mustard, and half spicy brown mustard, added about 1/4 cup of orange juice and some red pepper flakes. I only marinated for about an hour because I lost track of time, but still very yummy! One tip, though, use heavy duty foil or double foil-line your baking sheet. The gooiness that is so delicious, is quite difficult to scrub off. I used one layer of regular foil, and it wasn't enough. Next time, with easier clean up, I'll enjoy these even more!

Amazing! Really simple and fun to make! I used it with just chicken legs (6 to be exact) and I cut the recipe in half.

I marindated it for 1hr in the fridge, cooked it for 30 minutes @ 375 and voila!

LOVE!

I added a little garlic just because garlic is great.  Otherwise followed the recipe. It was a monster hit for dinner.  I found them a little on the sweet side and may up the mustard next time but I had no complaints from the family!!

Enjoyed these very much. I also used 1/2 yellow mustard and 1/2 dijon mustard after reading the reviews prior to making this. I'm not crazy about regular yellow mustard. The mustard taste was very mild. I used heavy duty foil on my cookie sheets to catch all the juice while they cooked, and it made clean up quick and easy.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because my boyfriend enjoyed it but for me there was way too much brown sugar. If you like very sweet chicken, this recipe is for you. If not, i would cut down the amount of brown sugar drastically.

I loved the idea of this mixture BUT I did half spicy mustard and regular yellow. Quick and last minute! I did only a 15 min window to marinate but came out great. Added to my list of recipes. Thanks!

This is a great recipe!! I really liked it!!  Loved that they are baked not fried.  I, also made some for my husband with his hot sauce on them instead of the regular sauce and they came out great, too!!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!! It will save us a lot of money, not ordering wings out!!

It was great! I added cayenne pepper into the seasoning of my chicken and it was the perfect sweet & spice!

Picky eaters approved! Followed 1/2 Dijon, 1/2 yellow mustard suggestion and baked at 400. Broiled wings at the end to slightly char.

Thanks Rebecca from Framingham, MA. My wife and I loved these. We didn't have yellow mustard, so we used dijon and horseradish.

PS Use to live in Newburyport, MA. Great seafood.

WOW! Everyone loved these. I made half a batch and used a glass 9x13 (for easy clean up, soak overnight). I was worried they would be too mustard, but they weren't at all. I will be making these again.

It wasn't that great because the wings were not crispy. I did like the flavor of the sauce.  Maybe it's because my wings were purchased frozen instead of fresh.

These were incredible.   The only thing I'd suggest is to bake them first for an hour to crisp them up.  Then marinate them every 10 to 15 min for the next 45 min to an hour.  They are scrumptious!

These turned out pretty good.  The mustard adds a more complex taste to the teriyaki type flavor.

I made these as the recipe stated.  I DID make a BIT more of the marinade/basting sauce.  Good thing, too...there was NOTHING LEFT.  My husband is currently eating  this and has barely uttered 5 words.  He just grunts and says mmmmm and licks his fingers.  I'd say it's a keeper.

These were delicious!  I'm not a big fan of yellow mustard, so reading other reviews, I used 1/2 c. yellow mustard and 1/2 c. honey mustard.  I marinated overnight and baked for 45 mins, broiling 3 mins per side for crispier skin.  Definitely a keeper!

Thought they were delicious, but I think I'll refrain from the additional basting next time. The bottom of the pan was covered in burnt caramelized marinade....

it was delicious but wondering if all used the dark or light brown sugar? I did use dark brown sugar and everyone seemed to love it..I was thinking of trying with light to see what the difference is....anybody make it with light?

This recipe is delcious!  I followed one of the suggestions in the comments and mixed in some dijon mustard.  I have never made wings before, but I am definitely going to make them more often to use this recipe.  So yummy.

Loved it!  I did add some extra seasoning into the marinade to give it some kick-used barbeque sause as a dipping sauce for the wings. will definately keep this recipe and use again!!

My Husband and his buddies loved this recipe! It was super easy for me and much healthier than fried wings. Definitely will make again!
