With the fact that we were used to have collard greens ALL the time in the southern style (smocked hocks or smocked turkey, etc.), I decided to give a try to this recipe. I read all the reviews and the sugested improvements... so I did my own.  I did add garlic (3 cloves chopped) to the onions. I cooked the greens for 12 min instead and season them at that time. I change the butter for 1 1/2 tbs dark sesame oil and 1 1/2 tbs spicy HOT sesame oil. The result was a FANTASTIC side dish for my pan seared Tuna, and jasmin rice with dry shiitake mooshrooms.

This was my first encounter with collard greens (eating or cooking) and i was thrilled with the results!  First time collard cooks might want to look up preparation instructions.  I found a video on youtube and am glad i looked since i wouldn't have washed and cooked them properly otherwise.  Don't eat the stems :)

Absolutely delicious!! Didn't add butter to sauce, and thought it was much nicer, and lower in calories. Great use of collards.

Delicious and quick. I felt that the flavors were well balanced. I halved the recipe (approximately...) and I didn't think the dressing was too strong, loved the ginger flavor. My mother loved it too and she hates greens, which is saying something.

I had extra collards I needed to use & thought this recipe sounded interesting.  The dressing is superb, though as other reviewers suggested--I think you could omit the butter.  This was a simple, very attractive & delicious recipe--thanks for sharing!!

Tip below.  First let me say, this was really, really great.  It was what I love best - the sweet and the sour - about having my greens with chow chow, but all in one simple dish.  I used pure maple syrup instead of honey, because of taste preference; otherwise, I made this just as it was written.  Tip: salt the greens and let them weep out their bitterness for about 30 min - 1 hour before cooking.  Just be sure to rinse off the salt and then give the them a good squeeze.  This will also help you fit them into the pan without have to wilt them in batches.

Tasty!  I didn't use the butter in the sauce, and I added a little garlic with the onions.    This recipe made me want to go buy more collards!

OMG, I'm a southern girl that doesn't care for traditional collards.  Love these!  Bought a bag of collards and kale for New Year's luck and had planned on making the simmered greens for the hubby.  Found this recipe after finding the kale chips (yummy as well) and thought I'd try it.  Hit with the whole family!  Definitely adding to the recipe box.  THANKS!

These are the most delicious collard greens I've ever eaten. This method allows the greens to retain some texture and crunch (and likely loads more nutrients) than those recipes that "cook the greens to death". I omitted the onion and didn't miss it...just simple, delicious greens. This is a new addition to our Thanksgiving meal.

My husband and I both like the recipe especially the dressing, but I will say that I don't think I cooked the greens enough as they were still hard to chew (be warned).  I also used about 1/2 the butter, just because of the fat involved.

i thought the ginger is too strong for greens that already have a pretty strong flavor.  i liked the honey and vinegar, though.

OMG thank you for a recipe not dripping with animal fat!  I've never had collards before but this recipe will be a regular now.  I made a few modest changes as I didn't have all the ingredients. I sauted the onion with garlic in a dark sesame oil/evoo blend.  Then subbed rice wine vinegar for the basalmic.  Incredible.

My family loved these greens.  They have enjoyed collards sliced thin in green salads and cole slaws, and have enjoyed collards the old southern way, but this is absolutely their favorite recipe for greens to date.  I was late getting to the table the first time I served these, and there were hardly any left for me to even taste them (and yes, I love them too!).

Very good taste!  I made the following changes to the recipe. First, instead of butter, I followed another's suggestion and use 1.5 tablespoons of sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of hot chili oil. I added a lot of ginger since my husband and I are very fond of it. Roughly a talespoon of finely minced fresh ginger root. A lighter balsamic vinegar worked very well. Will definitly make again!

This was so good!  I am definitely going to have to make the balsamic honey dressing again for other foods.  Great combination of flavors.  Also - next time I think I will chop the onion - the sliced onions had an unappealing appearance - almost earthworm-like once the sauce was added.

I am not a fan of collard greens but I received them in my co-op share, so had to find a way to make them edible. I must say, this is a delicious recipe. I omitted the butter. The dressing is delicious. I will try this next time with a less bitter green, like Swiss Chard.

Mixed because I loved the taste of the dressing (just didn't add butter though) but I guess I just don't like the taste of collard greens.  never had them before, but was too bitter tasting for me.

The vinegar/honey flavoring is way too strong, and this recipe calls for a lot of butter. The overall taste is just weird.  I definitely will not make this again.

Made this with mustard greens instead of collards, since that's what I had.  It was fabulous.  Make sure you have rice with this to soak up the sauce!

this was so good!! first time ever having collard greens, and i am glad this was how i chose to try them.  i decided to make a 2 serving batch for my meal, having it like a hot salad with some salmon on top. because it was my meal, i added some shredded carrots half way through the cooking. unfortunetly i didn't have balsamic vinegar, so i used apple cider.  it was so tasty. and so fast. highly recommend this recipe for those new to collard greens.

I absolutely love this recipe! It was light and full of favor! And it did not take for hours to make! The greens texture was very leafy which just means that it was not cooked all day. So the texture was still there. My husband and I love these greens.

Tried this recipe for New Year's day meal today.  I usually cook my collard greens in a pressure cooker but the thought of doing something different appealed to me today so I gave it a shot.  Like some of the other reviewers, I modified the recipe slightly.  I added in 2 cloves of garlic to the onion saute, and also added in about 1/2 tsp of grated fresh ginger.  Other than that, I followed pretty closely.  I cooked these in a large electric wok which provided easy heat control, and I went about 10 mins or so after adding in the water at approx 350f on the temp controller.  I was a bit reluctant to add the sauce because I thought it may be overpowering, but it turned out really well.  My wife (who doesn't normally care much for collards) liked it also and thought it was more like a salad dish than a collard dish.  I definitely left the greens just a TINY BIT al dente because I didn't want that fully soft texture that you get when you boil collards.  That's why I usually use a pressure cooker and these ended up with a very similar texture. 

Will definitely be trying this recipe again soon!

Delicious!  I added a can of rinsed black eyed peas at the end and heated through to make this a vegetarian main dish.  I served it with rice and a corn casserole.

Excellent alternative to the usual ham hock greens recipes!  (I like the ham, but sometimes you want it to be vegetarian.)  And this recipe is very quick and easy.
These are sweet and tangy just like the recipe says, but you still get the flavor of the greens.  I used more onions, I would recommend using a whole onion.  I had about half the amount of greens the recipe stated and didn't realize it, so I had too much dressing.  So make sure you check the package if you're using packaged greens like I did.

The best greens recipe ever.  A great way to add flavor, but keep the salt low

I didn't have enough collards so I also added some chopped fresh broccolini.  Also, I cut back on the water and didn't have to drain the collards after cooking.  I added the dressing to the pan, covered the pan and let it sit until the rest of the meal was ready. I served this with Cheesy Shrimp and Grits.

I threw Kale in there too!  You HAVE to remove the stalks from the collard greens or it is too hard to eat and bitter.

Short on time with hungry mouths to feed, I searched and searched for a recipe that would allow us to eat greens in under an hour. I was skeptcal (being from the South) but they were SO good. My husband and children agreed. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I substituted with apple cidar vinegar and it worked well. I also added chopped garlic cloves as recommended by rodrigouno...and I cooked mine for 12 minutes as well.

This was great. even better when you cook the greens in chicken stock. I got away with simplifying the dressing to equal parts balsamic and sugar

This was such an excellent recipe and I love that it was a little different flavor combination than the traditional collard greens recipes.  It was an ideal compliment to our sweet potato soup and crusty bread.  Thanks so much!

This was wonderful. I added garlic as some suggested and my husband thinks that it should cook longer to soften the greens. I will make this often. Thanks for a great recipe. I like it much better than the traditional way of cooking collard greens.

This came out quite bitter.  The balsamic vinegar seemed to overwhelm the flavour.  My family would not eat it. Maybe it was the greens I had...

yum! I used what I had in the cupboard. Balsamic, olive oil, white sugar, salt, pepper. Had just a single serving of greens in the fridge and calculated out a 1/4 of the dressing. Was AMAZING. first time making greens too.

This was my husband and my first attempt at eating collard greens and I'm sorry to say it was not a good experience. I can see how this recipe would be good if you liked greens already, but didn't make the cut for those of us who aren't such big fans of greens.

Our family had never eaten Collard Greens before, but all of us love spinach. We do not like our vegies sweet and so opted out on the honey. We don't like a lot of fat on them so opted out of the butter. We had a half of a green pepper that needed to be used and added that. They were wonderful and we will surely do them many times again.

Thank you so much for this delicious recipe! As a vegetarian, it's hard to find a good recipe for greens that doesn't include a meat product. I blended the onions with a couple cloves of garlic and sauteed them in evoo in the beginning then cooked the greens for about 45 minutes, adding vegetable stock as the liquid cooked out until they were nice and tender. Definitely not ready in 5 minutes but totally worth the wait! EXCELLENT RECIPE!

SO GOOD. I used Earth Balance vegan butter instead of the milk butter and agave syrup instead of honey, but other than that, I love this recipe!
It's also a plus for me when I meal prep that this keeps well in the fridge for over a week.

Delicious, and nice to have a different flavor for our greens. I didn't have fresh ginger, so substituted ground ginger powder, but I imagine it'd be even better with fresh.

I sauteed some crushed garlic and after cooking salted the greens liberally.  The collard greens in the supermarket were slimy so I used kale.  Came out delicious!

Just went vegan and were told collards have a high fuber and nutrient punch so wanted to try this. It was very good, omitted the butter (kept the honey) and enjoyed them  two days later mixed with white beans for tacos. They are so good. I will cook a bit longer next time though. Thanks for this recipe.

I really loved this!  The only thing I changed is that I did not add the ginger (just not a huge fan).  I followed every other step exactly as written.  I may cook the collards longer next time (perhaps 8-10 minutes?) just to soften them a bit more.     Really enjoyed it though, thank you for sharing the recipe!

We sliced the collard greens very finely which made it look very pretty but I would have preferred somewhat bigger slices in order to get more green and less sauce per bite.  It was definitely a yummy and different way to have one of my favorite leaves.  I might put in some sesame seeds next time.

This was fabulous!  I omitted the ginger and added crushed garlic.  Rather than make a dressing I simply tossed a few tablespoons of butter into the pan after the greens cooked and after it melted I added the balsamic and a splash of agave nectar in lieu of the honey.  Simple and delicious!

This was a test recipe for a Mardi Gras Dinner Party - and it got rave reviews!  I made a few amendments to the cooking method:  I steamed the collards which makes them very tender quickly but retains their color, with a whole chopped onion. I used a dark buckwheat honey and a Sicilian Lemon White Balsamic Vinegar made by Fiore. I would consider spicing it up a bit with a sprinkling of pepper flakes depending on what it would be served with - just to counter the sweetness.

We keep getting Collards in our CSA box, and this is the best recipe I've found for them so far. I really like the slight sweetness from the honey. We'll make this again. Thanks, Lauren!

Wow! Used a bit less butter, added garlic to the onion, and had to use powdered ginger, but LOVED this recipe!  Thanks for the tip on not eating the stems.  I had never been a big fan of collards, but was getting bored with the normal veggie routine and bought some to try- and I'll be doing it again very soon!  Delicious flavor!  And I'll be using the honey/balsamic combo when I make salad dressing too- yum!

This recipe is delicious! I have tried cooking collard greens several times and never liked the way it came out, but I couldn't get enough of this! Thanks to the person who recommended watching how to prepare collard greens on YouTube - I am sure that was a big help to the taste! I added some garlic with the onions and only used 2tbsp of butter (next time I will try omitting it altogether to see if there is much difference and will probably decrease the honey a little).

OK, so if all greens tasted this good, I'd eat them ALL the time.

My daughter ate her greens and liked them!! I had some frozen cooked greens in my freezer that my husband has been wanting me to do something w/ so I used this recipe. Since my greens were previous cooked, I simply thawed, drained, and added them to the sauteed onion with Pam butter spray instead of oil. I omitted the butter and used jarred ginger. This was so good, I can't wait to give this recipe to my sister-in-law. I can't wait for my greens to grow this year b/c of this recipe! Thanks!
