This was a delicious, quick meal! I had left over bacon already cooked, so that made it even easier. I didn't think it tasted too much like beer, but just right. Even my 2 and 4 year olds and even pickier husband liked it! I used 3 cups chicken broth and 1 can beer. next time, I will use both cans of beer. My husband took half of the soup and ran it thru the food processor and added some sour cream because he wanted it smooth and more creamy. Either way tasted pretty good. A quick tasty dinner. Will make this again for sure!

After reading the reviews I made a slight modification since I also like my cheese soup creamy.  I added two cans of Campbell's cheddar cheese coup and simmered for about an hour.  I then added the shredded cheddar in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I thought it turned out fine.

This is really good.  The only reason why I rated it 4 stars is that there is too much beer in this recipe.  I made it with one 12 ounce can of beer and 2 cans of chicken broth and still had a strong beer presence, not too much for my taste though, just about right.  I would definitely make this again with those substitutions.

The flavor of this soup was great, but I expected it to be a little thicker.

This was excellent! I used a light beer and used the full amount and it wasn't overpowering at all. I followed exactly except that I left the carrot out because I didn't have any. Will certainly make again!

We didn't really like this. It was really runny, and I expected a lot thicker. Also, the flavor was off, though that could be partially because of the beer we used. I will be trying out a new recipe next time, however.

I made this last Christmas Eve as I wanted to start a new tradition in our house and our friends are already talking about this year's feast, with the main dish as the soup :) It was excellent. Came out perfectly for me by following directions exactly. Can't wait to make it again this year!!

I only used 1 bottle of beer, and I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I still thought that the flavor of the beer was a tad too strong, but I suggest that you adjust it to your taste. It was a good recipe for a chilly winter night, especially served with a thick crusty bread.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out very bitter and it was not a thick and creamy soup like I had wanted. I would not recommend this to anyone, I am sure that there are better Beer Cheese Soup recipes out there than this one.

Great recipe, four stars only because too much beer. I skipped the bacon because of Friday fast but otherwise prepared as instructed. Recipe is economical to fix feeds 4 hungry kids with leftovers for another lunch! It is easy to add left over veg and ham or bacon for Saturdays lunch.

Maybe I used the wrong kind of beer (I don't drink beer), but the flavor was so strong! I couldn't even finish a bowl, but I'm giving it 3 stars because maybe I just don't like the taste of beer.

Delicious!  Perfect!  (I'm wondering why anyone would say there is too strong a beer flavor when this is beer cheese soup.)  I do add a cubed potato for my husband who likes more veggies to chomp!

I absolutely love this soup. 
I left out the carrots and green onions as im not a big fan of those and it actually makes it a little less carbs.
Easy to make and great for lunches. 
Gets better and better every day.

I followed the recipe but I sautéed the onions,  carrots and celery in bacon grease. Then I added the beer and the broth to the sautéed vegetables and used my hand blender to mince the vegetables. I also added tbsp. of corn starch in addition to the flour. I added 1 cup of heavy cream and different shredded cheeses.  Came out creamy and thick.

Very good! I added potatoes to it. I also did not use processed cheese. I added shredded marbled cheddar instead.

I've been making this soup for a few years now, it's my go to octoberfest soup. It's super easy to make and doesn't take long. Sometimes I leave out the green onions as I don't feel they're necessary, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. I use an emulsifier to smooth out the chunks and get a creamier texture.
