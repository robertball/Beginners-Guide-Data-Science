Frankly, I think this recipe was improved a whole lot by virtue of the fact that I refused to boil the mixture once I added the whiskey - what's the point of adding the alcohol to the glaze if you're just going to cook it off?  In fact, I added extra whiskey, and it made for a very moist, flavorful cake with a little bit of a kick to it.

Really good cake that I made Friday night for Saturday's party so that the cake could really soak up all the flavor from the whiskey. Don't forget to poke some holes with a skewer before you pour on the liquor. While the kids were enjoying the gooey "photo" cake of our daughter I had made up at our local bakery, the big people were enjoying something a little more to their liking! Thanks Jamie!

I used a good pound cake recipe in a Turk's head pan. I put some of the nuts in bottom of the pan, and made sure it was baked long enough!!!  My glaze has 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup butter ...boil a few min. (do not stir) then add 1/4 cup whiskey. I used knitting needles to poke holes in the cake then poured the glaze over it.  Let sit awhile then turn the cake out onto plate.    Been doing this for almost 30 yrs.

Great grown up dessert! Delicious and flavorful, yet simple and not to heavy.  Perfect for a light dessert or even a brunch item.

This cake is very tasty!  Next time, I might poke some holes in the cake so that the whisky runs inside it and not just on top.  I will make it again very soon.

Very yummy. I used a lazy daisy cake recipe and poured the whiskey sauce over top and it turned out wonderfully.

The bottom was moist, the top was not.  Next time I'm going to poke holes in the cake, like the one of the reviewers suggested.

It did taste like butterscotch!  It also smelled and tasted amazing.  My only problem-the texture was a bit weird in places--I'm not sure if this is because of the syrup or because I used a cake from a mix.

Everyone raved about this cake! I made a few changes to the recipe. First, I used a yellow cake instead of a white cake mix. Instead of making the syrup and adding for the last 5 min of baking, I waited until I cooled and flipped the cake over and then drizzled the syrup and some walnuts on top. Also I omitted the butter in the syrup to achieve a more syrup-like consistency. I also had to wait for the syrup to cool completely so it would thicken up enough. Yum!

I made this with Scotch - and it was DELICIOUS!  I poked holes in the cake as suggested which really helped to get that tasty butterscotch flavor into the cake.

Very moist and tasty.  I don't  like whiskey, but this cake made me change my mind.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I  have made it twice and will make it again.

I made this exactly as written except I followed others' suggestion to poke holes in the cake before pouring on the sauce.  It is absolutely delicious. I made it yesterday for tonight's dinner, but my son couldn't wait.  The cake is half gone and it's only lunchtime!

Incredibly moist and very good.  It could use some type of light glaze over top just for appearance.  If not just serve it pre sliced on a nice plate.

This was okay.  Not bad but not great.  Very moist.  Not sure if I would make again.

I don't care for white cakes, but this recipe was good. The cake was light and moist. Everyone at work like it.

This cake was OK. I didn't like it much, but a few of the older gentlemen at the party I served this at went nuts for it. It just tasted like plain white cake with a few nuts in it to me...It was certainly not dry, though!

My husband loved it. Next time I’ll try putting the whiskey into the sugar boiling mix at the very end as others suggested.
