These turned out delicious. I used the dough hook on my KitchenAid and followed directions for rapid rise yeast. I also increased the amounts of sugar/cinnamon and omitted the raisins and nuts. I also added a buttercream frosting. They're moist, chewy and have a nice texture overall. I'll definitely make them again.

I made this recipe on Christmas Eve, put them in the refrigerator.  The next day I took to my daughter's for brunch.  Everyone, including my 2 year old granddaughter, loved them.

I made these for Christmas morning.  They were a big hit and would definitely make them again.  I frosted them with a cream cheese frosting from another recipe.   Very simple to make.

Super easy and very tasty.  I added pecans to make them a little different.

I'v made this many times over the last couple years. omitting nuts and/or rasins depending on who was inattendence. One thing I do that makes them even better is to use a homemade carmel frosting instead on the white gooey one.

This recipe may be a little hard for asome that aren't familiar with working with yeast (like me my first time around).  I have been making it for about 5 years and everyone that tastes them falls in love.  It is a lot of work but the smiles are worth it!

These were not to bad. I doubled the cinnamon and brown sugar because I like mine really gooey. I'm still looking for the perfect cinnamon roll. I'll keep looking.
