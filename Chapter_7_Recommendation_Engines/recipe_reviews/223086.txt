I had to use store bought sauerkraut to try this, otherwise I would have used home made apple ginger sauerkraut.  The mustard really kicks this sandwich up a notch!  What a great combination of tastes!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great healthy easy flavorful meal.  I added just a dash of celery seed for an extra layer of interest.

Great texture. I used a strong dijon and strong sauerkraut, so it was  bit too much. Next time I'll tone it down a little, or maybe add some swiss on top.

This is a great recipe! I was kind of surprised, but very nicely so. I substituted yellow mustard and blue cheese dressing for the Dijon & red wine vinegar. (ingredients on hand) I grilled it. It was great straight out of the bowl, too!

I've been looking for more ways to incorporate fermented foods in my diet (this has 2!). I usually don't like fruit in anything but this is really good! I peeled my apple and sliced it thin on a mandolin then chopped that. Thanks for the great recipe!

This will become a regular in our house, the red wine vinegar paired great with the red wine. I did not have a sweet red apple and instead used a Granny Smith,  with Bubbies kraut- yummy! 

Advice/Suggestion: mix the Dijon mustard and red wine vinegar prior to adding the rest of the ingrediants. (It gives an ideal mix) also, I added a slice of provolone and toasted the sandwich on the stove top. This recipe is such a great test on a boring tuna sammy. Try it!
