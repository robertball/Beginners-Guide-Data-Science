These are okay but I've found other recipes I enjoy more.  Do want to mention after draining you can mash the bones along with the salmon; they contain a lot of calcium and no one even knows they're there.  No reason to throw all that goodness away.

Very good patties! I cut the recipe in 1/2, then mixed as directed. Put mix in fridge for several hours, just to hold till dinnertime. I then made 5 generous patties & skipped the frying. I put canola on the silpat, coated 1 side of the patties, then turned them over so oil was on the top & bottom. Baked at 375* in the toaster oven on convection for 30 minutes. The bottoms were browned as if "fried", and the tops were "toasted" nicely. They are filling - I could only eat 1.5 with rice salad on the side. I was craving Dijon mustard, so used that instead of a cheese sauce (which I'll try on the leftovers). These are easy to make & good for stretching the budget. I will make them again - I bet this would make good tuna patties, too.  Thanks, Tracy Ann!

Absolutely delish!!! I made mini paddies to put in my bento-box and added a squeeze of lemon for a little extra flavor since I didn't have that onion taste. I also put wax paper underneath while baking to make it close to mess-free. These are to DIE for. :-)

The dill weed gives these patties more flavor than the restaurant version. REMEMBER: remove the spines from the canned salmon and throw them away.

Very good, hubby loved it!  Think I'm going to decrease the onion by half next time, and gonna add a little lemon pepper.

At the last minute, I decided to make these. I actually made it with White Alaskan  (Boneless/Skinless) which made it even easier. 
I made it exactly how it is written except I omitted the onion (mainly because I didn't have one). Instead of making 5 LARGE patties, I made 5 large patties. :) One recipe yielded 10 good size patties.  Also, I served these with mashed potatoes and country gravy. YUM!

Large Salmon Patties' Haiku: "Always refridge first. Makes patties hold together. Taste was quite delish." I halved the recipe for one can of salmon and followed everything else in the recipe other than forming the patties in the morning and wrapped each tightly in Saran in the fridge so they'd keep their shape better. My only minor complaint was that a total of 12-16 min. in the skillet followed by 20 min. in the oven resulted in a rather dry patty that we had to liberally lube up in various squirts of condiments, and drag them thru our favorite salmon patty side dish of nuclear orange mac n' cheese. They were still tasty, and the "Largeness", at least for the five that I made, was more of a chubbiness rather than circumference, as I wanted to be able to fit all five in the skillet together.
