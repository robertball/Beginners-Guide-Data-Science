I tweaked it just a smidge: I added 1/2 c of chopped pecans, 6 oz can of mandarin orange segments  (drained), and 3 tbsp of brown sugar.  I have never made cranberry sauce from scratch before and was curious about how it would "gel"- all of those little berries popped and question answered!  I put everything in a saucepan med flame for 10 min., stirred it up and: Fabulous!  This will be my recipe from now on!! It is even better the next day. So this could be a day-before recipe too! Thanks so much for the submission!!!!

This is good stuff! I wasn't able to find unsweetened apple juice concentrate (even at the health food store!), so I just used the kind with sugar. I was actually glad I did, because it is definitely tart! Thanks for a great recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!  I've always been a huge fan of canned cranberry sauce, but in the past few years I haven't bought a single can.  This recipe is amazingly simple and amazingly delicious.  I buy extra cranberries in November and December and freeze them just so I won't have to wait until fall to have more.

I tried this with a little different tack:  I used 7 pared and chopped apples (not peeled), and two bags of cranberries.  Then I crocked it for 12 hours.  It turned out very tart--I added about a 1/4 c. of white sugar--and not quite as 'apple saucy'-as I wanted.  I think next time I'll raise the apple-to-cranberry ratio, maybe with same # of apples but only one bag of cranberries.

This left me with 1 1/2 qt of sauce, plenty for a large dinner party.

Very good! I totally misread the recipe and ended up using regular apple juice....wondered why it was so tart! I ended up adding agave nectar to it and it was very good!

Loved this recipe!  I like my cranberries not to sweet, still on the tart side, so the apple juice concentrate was enough sweetener (didn't add sugar).  Plus, the juice is a healthier natural sweetener instead of refined sugar.  Definitely a keeper!

This is awesome if you don't mind your cranberry sauce on the tart side.  I doubled the amount of apple concentrate and used this with 12 oz of cranberries.  This was the perfect sweetness for me.  No need for extra sugar.

This is exactly what I've been looking for, since canned cranberry sauces are too sweet. This recipe is for those who like the tartness of cranberries, but you can gradually add sugar to your liking.

I am always looking for good recipes that require little to no sugar, and this one worked out great! I made a few modifications- I added the juice and flesh of a sweet orange, and simmered the sauce on low til it broke down further than the berries bursting. No sugar was needed. Delicious.

This recipe has become a fall favorite for our family, including our four-year old son. The tartness  is a matter of taste; we find it just right as we do not use refined sugar in general.

I tried this sauce with turkey tonight.  Hubby normally only wants the canned jelly cranberry and I just can't bring myself to open any more cans of that stuff!  I loved the idea of combining apple juice and cranberries.  Before preparing, I read the reviews and noted that some readers warned it was a little tart and some sugar may need to be added.  They were right.  The sauce definitely would have been too tart for us so I added 1/4 cup white sugar to the mixture when it was cooking on the stove but have noted that it needs more next time.  Great recipe though and definitely my go-to recipe from here on in!!!

This recipe is a great way to make cranberry sauce healthy.  I've added pecans, crushed pineapple and sugar-free jello for a change and liked it really well.

Just made a batch for Thanksgiving. I do not normally like cranberry sauce, but I could eat the entire batch of this. I did add 5 tablespoons of sugar because it seemed too tart for me. Such a simple and delicious recipe. This definetely goes in my "keeper" recipe file!!!!!

I always used cans and focussed on making everything else amazing instead but never again! This was too easy to do a day or two before and so much better very worth a try! I only used 4 oz. (1/2  c.) of apple juice concentrate and it was perfectly thick and beautiful at room temp but if you like it cold from the fridge you'll want the extra 2 oz. or it may be too thick.

Superb cranberry sauce. I added a little Coconut sugar, which is an excellent 1:1 substitute for refined sugar.

Substituted orange juice because it's all I had. I did add sugar, but it would have been ok without it. This was so easy I'll never buy cranberry sauce again!
