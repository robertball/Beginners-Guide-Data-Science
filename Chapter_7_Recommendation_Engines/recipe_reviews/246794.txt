So good. I left out the green onion and quadrupled the garlic. (My whole family LOVES garlic.) No other changes were made. They turned out great. The family particularly liked the teriyaki sauce. I served it with asparagus and creamy garlic shells.

I made this and they were probably some of the best meatballs I've ever had. Everyone in my family loved them! We didn't use onions in the recipe because we aren't big fans of them but other wise followed everything. After making the sauce and baking the meatballs I put them directly in the pot of sauce to fully coat the meatballs and they were delicious! Definitely recommend!

Came out good. Only I didn't bake them I fried them in canola oil didn't heat up the sauce (just topped it over the done meatballs) and didn't add ginger (because some people I know don't like ginger).

Very good! Didn't add onion because I forgot. Used a little oatmeal as the binder. Lots of ginger was the flavor. Used doctored up store by teriyaki sauce. Just ok. Made huge meatballs and cooked for 20 min. Becca loved it.

I doubled the amount of sauce to drizzle over rice. It was delicious!

This was one of the best tasting teriyaki sauce recipes I have made and the meatballs were gobbled up by my family. They stuck to the foil though and fell apart a little like ground turkey tends to do. I served with brown rice and broccoli which made a great meal. Next time I'll grease the pan and double the sauce to have extra to dribble over the rice!

I didn't strictly follow the instructions as I was trying to emulate some teriyaki meatballs we got from Costco. My modifications included adding a little of the glaze/sauce mixture to the meatball mix to make them sweeter inside also added a couple teaspoons of sriracha. These turned out moist and plain yummy (the oposite of many turkey meatball recipes I've made before)! Saving recipe to make again in future.
