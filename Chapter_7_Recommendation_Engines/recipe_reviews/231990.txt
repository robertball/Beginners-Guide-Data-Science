Fantastic! I followed the directions except for switching it up to make a Cherry Lemon Sun Drop pound cake.  I used Cherry Lemon Sun Drop soda and added a dash of maraschino cherry juice with the extracts. Same with the glaze. Perfect!  Sometimes I male a Cherry Lemon buttercream frosting in lieu of the glaze.

Perfect as written!  This is the classic recipe. Been using it for quite a while and everyone loves it! I make mine in a Bundt pan and the results look much more like the second and third photos attached to this recipe. I've never applied that much icing on the finished cake; it's drizzled over the cake to run down the sides. 
Should one WANT to taste more lemon (Notice that this is NOT a recipe for a Lemon Cake; it's for a Sundrop Cake), I have on occasion added just a tiny bit of lemon extract to the icing.

I just took this cake out of the oven and it was perfect!! Moist on the inside with just an ever so slight crust on the outside! I did have to make a couple of substitutes: cake flour instead of all purpose flour, and 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup canola oil instead of 1/2 cup crisco.  It's the best Sundrop cake I've ever made!!

Instead of sundrop soda I used orange cream soda and real orange juice. This recipe is so moist and firm.  My friends and coworkers love when I make it.

This is a simple delicious recipe.  Everyone who tasted it loved it.  I didn't change one thing.....I am however, going to try this same recipe with an orange soda and orange extract.

Fantastic! Turned out great the two times I've made it.
