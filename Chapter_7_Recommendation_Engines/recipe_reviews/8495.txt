I read the reviews and took the suggestion of some others.  First of all, I dipped the chicken in egg wash, then laid the slices of ham and cheese on top.  I got a plate and sprinkled breadcrumbs and placed the chicken on it and rolled it from there.  I also added a pat of butter on top of each.  It came out beautifully and you must use the sauce (which is 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 tbsp of lemon juice).  I put a bed of white rice on the plates, put the chicken cordon blue on top of the rice covered with the cream sauce. A good side dish is buttered rolls, mmm-mhmm! All I can say was that it was such a beautiful presentation and absolutely heavenly!

I can't believe this awesome recipe! My boyfriend cannot stop talking about it. I told him I was making it for dinner, and he came home early from work. Then, when he tasted it......he moaned and groaned through the entire meal. He made a comment between each and every bite. He has thanked me over and over for making this for him. I have to say, this recipe made me 'Queen for a Day.' I also dipped the chicken in egg before sprinkling the bread crumbs, and I, too, added a small pat of butter on top of each of the breasts. I will definetely be making this, at least once a month. I used the 'potatoe rounds' recipe from this site, for the side dish. This entire meal turned out soooooooo good. You are a goddess, Kiersten! Thank you so much.  :)

Fantastic. My variation includes: add some paprika to the breading, and bread the whole chicken roll, not just the top. I also like to cook my chicken hotter and faster to keep it juicy - 20-25 minutes at 400. Final suggestion: add the honey-mustard sauce from this site's Aussie Chicken recipe (inside the roll and/or as a dipping sauce). It really complements this dish!

This recipe was absolutley amazing and very easy. I did follow some of the suggestions from previous raters(Mushroom soup sauce:1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream & 1 tbsp of lemon juice-served on top when finished; coated chicken in egg before adding bread crumbs; cooked at 400 for 25 min and I also added a small pat of butter to each breast before cooking). I would also suggest not to use sandwich ham. Anyway, my boyfriend wants to marry me after tasting this recipe! Thanks!

Very good!  I can NEVER get breasts thin enough to roll so I cut breasts in half almost all the way through and laid a piece of Healthy Choice Ham and provolone in the cut; sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on bottom of dish; laid chicken on top and then sprinkled more bread crumbs on chicken.  Very tasty!

Great recipe to make ahead and freeze too! I dip the rolled up chicken in melted butter before rolling in bread crumbs.

Wow!  These were looked and tasted wonderful and they were super simple to make.  I bought big breasts and pounded them.  They were quite easy to roll.  I dipped them in egg first and then rolled them in the bread crumbs. I used the other reviewers suggestions and used provolone instead of swiss (just my preference), put a pat of butter on top of each and baked for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.  I put a half slice of cheese on top and put it back in for 5 minutes.  I also made the sauce recipe (1 can of cream of celery soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream) and spooned it on top.  Just lovely - thanks so much for a great recipe.

A hit in my family of 5, including a 4 yr old, the pickiest of all...The chicken cooked for 50 minutes..adding to its crispiness..and I didn't use toothpicks to secure them, making them easier to eat. I used sliced cooked ham and processed swiss cheese to cut costs and found it to be a bit salty. I will try this again and again, however, I will cut down the amount of salt.  It was totally simple to prepare!  TY

This recipe is incredible! It's so easy and sure to please any crowd. Provolone makes a great substitution for those who dislike swiss cheese.

I just want to say this is the first thing I have ever truly made with no help from someone in the kitchen.  My boyfriend and I were going to go out to dinner for his birthday and the night before, he decides, he wants a homecooked meal from yours truly instead. I freaked out and googled what to make. He then suggested "steak, lobster or chicken cordon bleu" He knew I was NOT making steak or lobster :) Don't laugh (i've been living under a rock) but I had no idea what chicken cordon bleu even was! I have cooked before but honestly, before I made this, I had NEVER made a meal (from scratch) by myself.  Again, don't laugh!   Basically, all I am saying is:  This recipe was sooooooo easy and it was absolutely delicious and I am now an allrecipes member because of how much fun I had cooking all by myself.   Thank you!

Wonderful! This recipe rocks!, and it's one we've made for years - purely to suit my families tastes we've made these changes/substitutions: you can use chicken thighs with the bone removed - actually makes a nice pocket for the ham and cheese. (baked pocket side up)  We use cheddar mostly I've used shake an bake for chicken to coat and baked, versus the bread crumbs, also used crushed stuffing mix and crushed croutons we've added a bit of flavored cream cheese with the ham, (yum green onion and cream cheese) and we've also done it without a bread coating at all and we've used a parmesan coating -  this recipe is versatile! The sky's the limit here :) thanks Kiersten :)

Hi Ya all, just wanted to share with you how i fixed this, i actually soaked my chicken in buttermilk after i pound them out and let the bathe for about an hour or so, also when you go to bake them, i placed them in aluminum  foil and sprayed it with a little Pam so the Swiss cheese would not ooze out onto the pan while it baking, the buttermilk gives this such a good flavor and makes it so tender and juicy not dry, i just put salt and pepper on the chicken after i soaked it and then rolled both sides in bread crumbs then layered it with my cheese and ham and baked it as according to the directions, your gonna love this, hope someone out there finds this helpful:)   Clayton

Very very good! I was suprised how easy and tasty it was! Here's the trick guys, about flattening the chicken and folding it, you flatten the breast with your fist or a meat mallet. Then the tricky part is fold the breast end over end. I guess the best way to explain is NOT a taco fold, the opposite. Three toothpicks holds it together perfect. I choose provolone over swiss, it's just not my thing. The honey mustard is a MUST, I just couldn't eat this without the it, ever again. It's amazing. My husband HATES honey mustard but was completely sold when paired together. I just used 1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cup prepared mustard, and 1/2 cup mayo. Whisk together, drizzle over chicken and TADA!

There are times when I have problems with chicken drying out so I put a thin layer of mayonnaise on top of the chicken before adding the bread crumbs. I also use this method when I cook fish in the broiler.  Works every time!

This was sensational! And so easy! I also didn't add salt because of the saltiness of the ham, and it was perfect! I rolled everything together, dipped the whole roll into beaten eggs, then into breadcrumbs with some garlic. I then took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the chicken at 400 for 25 minutes instead of 350 to keep the chicken moist-- it worked like a charm! FYI: I ran out of ham, so I used roast beef in one chicken roll. It was awful. Stick with ham or turkey. And mozzerella cheese works well, too! Thanks!

Delicious! I made this for my family tonight and they loved it. I didn't read ahead the end about adding the cheese on top (which I will definitely have to try next time), but it still got rave reviews.

ADD SHERRY FOR PIZAZZ.  My family loves this recipe.  Because I had chicken strips rather than chicken breasts in my freezer, I converted this recipe to a casserole: layer of ham, layer of chicken coated with bread crumbs, layer of swiss cheese chunks, another layer of ham.  Then I poured sherry (maybe 1/3 cup or more) over the top and baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  I also made the cream of chicken soup, sour cream, lemon juice topping, adding milk and seasoning salt to it.  What flavor!  Family went nuts.

I can't even begin to tell you how awesome this recipe is!  I've made it SEVERAL times, and it's always a hit!  You could get creative and mix things up a little by adding different things in place of the ham and swiss cheese. I've made it by stuffing it with Peppered bacon, swiss cheese, and sauteed mushrooms. This is a variation of this recipe that will not disappoint!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I find myself turning my nose up at all other recipes I see telling myself, "I have a better one!" :)

Absolutely DELICIOUS! 4 stars because I believe the awesome flavor came from marinating the chicken overnight in lemon juice, Italian seasoning, garlic salt & pepper. I also breaded the whole thing, rolled it up and served with honey mustard. My husband says this is in his top 10 meals now! :)

Wow.  I pounded chicken thin. Dipped one side in eggbeaters then crumbs.  Placed ham & swiss inside before rolling and securing with toothpicks(2). Instead of pat of butter, use spray butter to cut down on fat (usually spray once during cooking also to keep moist).

This was quite good, but I had to cook for longer than indicated (I started at the 350, and after 30 minutes I had to raise it to 400 and cook for 15 more minutes).  That is the reason for the 4 stars.  I also did as others suggested and coated with egg (I brushed it on then rolled in the crumbs).  And the sauce noted was good, but even better when I added a little white wine to it, which made it smoother and added flavor.  Lastly, I took a number of sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and placed them in the baking pan with the chicken, as well as a leaf of fresh sage on top of each one.  The herbs imparted a wonderful smell and made the chicken very flavorful.  This is definitely an improvement over pan-frying them in ease of cooking and health.

I made this for 5 other people and they all enjoyed it.  My adjustments - I added garlic powder and paprika when seasoning the chicken, put bread crumbs down on the bottom of the pan, added melted butted on top of the bread crumbs before baking, and topped with parsley for the last few mintues of cooking(while the top cheese was melting).  My husband wants it again.

My husband is a Beef and Potatoes man, so putting chicken before him is always a challenge. This chicken recipe, however, went over so well that he not only did not complain when he first saw it, but he actually raved over the taste during the meal and concluded with the exclamation that I could make this dish for him anytime, it was fabulous!

Delicious! I used turkey ham and yarlsburg cheese. I also dipped the wrapped chicken in flour, then an egg/milk bath, then bread crumbs. I topped each roll with a pat of butter as others suggested. I also made the sauce others suggested (1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1 tbs lemon juice, plus some milk to thin it). I heated the sauce on the stove and poured it over the chicken when it came out of the oven.

I have made this many times, I always make the sauce, I used 8 oz sour cream, 1 cream of chicken, a little milk, grated parm cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper. It makes an amazing sauce, and I change up the stuffing too, from hot pepper cheese with mushroom to spinach and cream cheese. Bake for 350 degrees for 40 mins while uncovered in the sauce and then pour over noodles and you will not have any left!

YUM!  I did the pocket thing as others suggested, I placed a slice of provolone (not a swiss fan) on top of a slice of ham, squirted dijon mustard on that & stuffed it in the pocket.  I added paprika to the bread crumbs & skipped the salt (and skipped the cheese on hubbys, for an unknown reason, he doesn't like cheese).  We liked this one, thanks Kiersten!

The recipes was good I took the advice from other reviews and dip the chicken in egg. I also added Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. I seasoned the chicken with supreme chicken seasoning along with the salt and pepper.

Yum, Yum, Yum! This dish was excellent and received rave reviews from all. I will say that I did a few minor alterations, however, I feel confident in saying that this dish would have been excellent as is. The changes I made were to use prosciutto (sp?) instead of ham, to dip the final 'roll-up' of the chicken in melted butter and THEN roll in bread crumbs. Great recipe! Thank you!

This recipe was so easy and simply fantastic. I had never made Cordon Bleu before and couldn't believe how great it turned out. I used Prosciutto instead of regular ham and it infused the chicken with so much flavor. The other thing I did was smear the inside of the chicken with sour cream before layering the swiss and ham and rolling it up. I then also smeared the outside with sour cream before rolling it in the breadcrumbs. I noticed other recipes include sauce, but I think that would detract from the wonderful synergy of the ham, chicken and swiss. This is the kind of recipe that guests will think you spent hours laboring. It presents beautifully and tastes wonderful.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it.  This was very good.  I used provolone cheese instead of swiss cheese and rolled in egg yolks before rolling in bread crumbs.

I rolled each filet in egg before covering it in bread crumbs. I was so scared that this would be undercooked because even after pounding it, the chicken breasts were each about an inch thick; after rolling, they were even bigger. I ended up cooking it for 45 min (I checked at 35 and it was still a little pink on the inside, so I reduced the temp to 320 and cooked it for 10 min longer), and it tasted a tad dry and needed a little more flavor. On the plus size, the portions were HUGE - I prepared six chicken breasts, and we each shared 1/2 each. I think with a little tweaking and listening to some of the comments of other reviews, this would definitely be a 5 star recipe.  Next time, to prevent dryness - Make sure to really follow the directions and pound it to 1/4inch-1 inch thick - Possibly listen to the comments and make a sauce to go with it - Maybe be more careful in cutting it open to check if it's cooked; when I did this, much of the juice spilled out which I think added to the dryness. - Definitely try adding the dab of butter that others suggested to give it a little more flavor. (Make sure to salt/pepper it in the beginning too!)

Excellent!  Surprisingly it was so simple but perhaps that's the way it tastes best.  I've spent years stuffing chicken with various concoctions yet it has never been as tasty.  My daughter who doesn't enjoy chicken and is a small eater, ate almost 2 breasts.  I altered the recipe by using chicken thighs (more cost effective) and used Provolone cheese for inside and mozzarella on top.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

We love this dish.   Looks super fancy considering it's not hard to make.   I also use the sauce (1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 c. sour cream, and 1 Tbsp. Lemon Juice) and it's great.  I just want to say though, that instead of pounding the chicken breast, I have my butcher run it through the tenderizer one time.  (Get friendly with your butcher, he'll do it!) It comes out perfect for this dish and saves you so much prep. time later.  It does take a bit of time for the butcher, though so normally, I go get my chicken breasts first, give them to him, and proceed with the rest of my shopping while he does it.  FYI.  Enjoy!  BV

The chicken was dry despite correct cooking time. Perhaps a light sauce could have been served with it. I would not make this a 2nd time.

Made it for dinner for the wife tonight!!!  After she proceed to lay waste to it and clean her entire plate she remarked that I needed to make this recipe a lot more regularly.  I used the Alfredo sauce from All recipes and tossed with still steaming bow tie pasta and placed the cooked and rested breast on top with a sprig of parsley garnish.  Definitely a keeper in the old recipe box from now on!!!

I am definitely NOT a cook and this is the best and easiest recipe I've ever made form this website. I like to use Boars Head maple ham for a slightly sweet flavor. My boyfriend actually ASKED for this one again! 2 suggestions: using colored toothpicks will color the chicken, and the ham makes the chicken pink but that doesn't mean it isn't cooked enough. Don't make the same mistake I did the first time! I would and have made this recipe again and again!

Lovely recipe! I did customize it by using an egg wash  before breading--and by using crumbled Gorgonzola instead of the Swiss. 
The sauce was onion and mushroom, chopped, in the pan drippings, with a little flour for thickening--some sour cream and !surprise! a little gorgonzola cheese. Take off the heat and add some seedless white grapes, if you don't have white wine in the house. Gorgeous!

New to the site.  I made this just last night, so I was curious as to what the recipe suggestion would be.

Here was my mistake. A 1/4-inch thickness is pretty thin.  You want to really take the time to pound it out.  Mine was probably 1/2-inch thickness and still rolled out, but could have been thinner.

Here are my variations to the recipe. First, lightly dust the logs with seasoned flour, and then into an egg mixture (two eggs and two teaspoons of water).

Lastly, roll the logs in a seasoned cup of bread crumbs (with a couple of teaspoons of olive oil to help brown it).

I may try one of the sauce suggestions, however this is a rich dish and stands alone well here.

This recipe is a real winner.  Easy to prepare, no complicated steps to go through, bakes quickly.  If
you don't have a good, heavy meat pounder use whatever heavy object you have on hand. I used my
marble rolling pin.  With the chicken breast between two sheets of waxed paper there's no problem pounding it thin without breaking it up. If you don't have toothpicks on hand, use shish kabob skewers to "fasten" the package.  Be _sure_ to not
overcook, if you do the chicken will be dry rather
than moist and tasty.

I altered this recipe according to others' sugguestions. I only had sandwich meat ham, so that's what I used and it tasted really good. I also didn't have swiss cheese, so I used pepperjack, and that turned out delicious, as well!  After rollin up each serving, I washed them in egg wash and dipped them in bread crumbs and added a small pat of butter to the tops before baking. I made the cream sauce (1 can cream of chicken, 1/2 cup cream cheese, 1 tbsp lemon juice), but I personally don't think it was necessary...personal choice entire!  Great recipe...my husband said he'd definitely eat it again!

This recipe was great! I went with some of the suggestions that I had found in here and it turned out amazing!! Here's what I did:

I pretty much stuck to the original recipe although I made a few additions. I put the breadcrumbs on a large dinner plate, added the pepper, and used a dash of garlic salt instead. I tried to go lite on the garlic salt after reading reviews that the ham would add quite a bit to the saltiness of the dish. I, too, dipped the chicken in an eggwash before breading the chicken, and breaded both sides. Then, because I didn't have toothpicks, I wrapped the chicken in large thick-cut bacon and flattened it a little in my 9"x13".

I also took the suggestion to make the sauce using a cream of ____ (I've seen several different suggestions i.e. chicken, celery, mushroom, whatever...). I used cream of mushroom because I like it, and it's what I had offhand. I mixed it with what sour cream I had had left - approximately 4oz. I didn't have lemon juice, so I left it out. 

I covered the chicken with the sauce and baked it on 385F for 35 minutes, took it out and added a slice of provolone and swiss cheese to the top, and placed it back in the oven for another 7 minutes.

This dish turned out AMAZING!!!

This was good. It's not the absolute best Chicken Cordon Bleu I've ever had... but it is very good. And VERY easy to make, which is why I'm giving it a 5 instead of 4.

My 11 yr old daughter & I prepared this dish together. The prep was laborious & fun at the same time. The tenderizing portion was challenging as you need to have a relatively consistently flat chicken breast to make the rolling work well. We used deli ham this time but would like to use a thicker cut next time. Otherwise followed the recipe to a t. What we found is that the cooking time in the oven actually took about 10 min longer than the recipe said but it was well worth the wait. When the finished product came out, it was delicious as well as aesthetically pleasing. I felt like a real pro. My mother in law had seconds and my wife raved about it for 2 days. We had red potatoes and broiled asparagus as sides...We'll definitely be doing this again.

Absolutely amazing! I dipped the chicken in egg before coating it in the bread crumbs and used provolone instead of swiss, as well as making the mushroom soup mixture (cream of mushroom, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1 tbsp. lemon juice) to pour over the top. My boyfriend gobbled it up and was still talking about how delicious it was the next morning, needless to say I sent him to work with the leftovers. :)

Wonderful!  I did add one pat of butter to the top of each rolled breast to add moisture, which it seemed to lack the first time, but now it is great.

Great recipe!  I'm a college student who loves this stuff, but never tried to make it myself before.  I am not a skilled cook, but I made this recipe for a great meal without any problems.

This recipe was great!  I'm very new to cooking and am trying to find recipes that are tasty and easy--and that will make my husband think I know what I'm doing in the kitchen.  This was delicious!

Unbelievable recipe!  I took previous reviewers' advice and dragged them through egg before coating with breadcrumbs.  Also I baked at 400 degrees for approximately 30 minutes and these were so juicy and tender.  There were no leftovers! I also left the cheese off the top.

Made this last night for dinner... It was so simple and fun to make... I did line the pan with bread crumbs and and a couple pads of butter so they wouldn't stick and since my boyfriend and I are huge fans of garlic I added garlic powder to the bread crumbs... I also egg washed the chicken and dredged the chicken as well... We absolutely loved this dish... it is definitely going rotation...

First time making this and it was wonderful! I was even told it was better than the gourmet butcher shop's version!    Very easy to make. Some of the cheese came out but that's to be expected. I didn't have time but when I make it again, I'm going to put them in the fridge for a 1/2 hr before breading them (America's Test Kitchen said that'll make the chicken hold together without toothpicks). However, even with breading right away, they were great!   The sauce was also wonderful!! I did cream of mushroom soup with sour cream and a little water. Nice additional flavor. However, the chicken was moist enough without so it's not necessary.    Great recipe!! It's elegant and easy, what could be better?

Great recipe! I make it at least twice a month! You have to make the sauce to go with it though! It is 1 can cream of chicken soup 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 tbspoon lemon juice. Just mix together and cook until hot!

Pretty good - not superb or anything but definately a nice easy, different way to prepare chicken. I used Proschuto ham (don't add salt) and Provolone cheese. I doused the whole thing in butter before baking - helped keep chicken moist. Very filling! Hard to eat a whole chicken breast after this treatment.  Made the sauce to accompany it as well - nice dish overall.

Even my kids loved this one! I did follow the advice of a previous reviewer and cut the chicken almost in half width-wise, placing the ham and cheese inside (like a pocket) instead of rolling it. Very easy and turned out delicious.

This recipe was great.  I used the mushroom sauce (1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tbsp lemon juice), put a little bit of butter on top, and coated the chicken all around with the bread crumbs (I used a tiny bit of canola oil to make them stick). It was a big hit with everyone, and easy to make too! Thank you for this recipe!

I have never made chicken cordon bleu – so it was intimidating to try. Just following the directions, a first-time cook like me was able to make a great meal that the family went nuts over. I am definitely adding this to my list of recipes to use when friends and family come over.

Excellent! My husband told me to make it again. I put the cheese and ham on the chicken and then rolled it up, secured it and then rolled the whole thing around in Italian bread crumbs. I also added a pat of butter to the top of each chicken and another slice of cheese to the top of the chicken a few minutes before removing. I also served with a basic cheese sauce over rice. MMM.

I made this the other night and my family and I LOVED it! The only thing we didn't care for was the sauce so I just made my own. Definitely put pats of butter on them before they go in the oven. My mouth is watering just thinking of them!

I made this last night and thought it was FAB!  I am working Mom so by the time I get home I am always looking for something easy and quick to make.  This was all that and tasty!  Instead of pounding out breasts I did what I saw another reviewer do and I butterflied them; sprinkled a bit of onion and garlic powder and lemon pepper on both sides; added slice of deli ham and provolone; brushed dijon mustard on top outside of each breast and then added panko italian flavored breadcrumbs and placed in baking dish (unrolled).  Also did pat of butter to each as so many recommended.  Only thing different I think I would do is also add some dijon inside to give it some more zip.  Also made sauce recommended w/s. cream/can of cream of chix and lemon and thinned w/milk.  Also added slide of cheese on top last few min of baking.Then placed chix w/sauce over egg noodles.  Can't wait to have it for lunch today.  Have always thought of making this but assumed it would be much harder.  Will def make again and again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was easier to make than I thought it would be.  I added a few of the veiwer's tips, but basically followed this recipe:  After the chicken was rolled and toothpicked, 1) I rolled in an egg wash before rolling in seasoned bread crumbs, 2) added a pat of butter on top of each chicken roll before placing in oven, 3) cooked at 400 degrees for a total of 30 minutes, (adding 1/2 slice of cheese during the last 5 minutes of cooking time), 5) served with sauce made of 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 to 3/4 cup sour cream (mixture of regular and low fat) and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice.  **I began with 3 very large chicken breasts and they made 3 very large rolls. I could only eat one half of one, my boyfriend ate a whole one.  So we had enough for lunch too.  Served with skillet browned potatoes and onions.  Very good dish and my boyfriend can't wait until I cook it again.  Thank you for the recipe Kiersten!

FANTASTIC recipe considering how easy it is to prepare.  Great with the sauce on top (1 C. cream of chicken soup, 1/2 C. sour cream - I used cottage cheese that I blend until smooth for a healthy alternative, and 1 Tlbs lemon juice.)

Just delicious !! Not very time consuming, and makes a wonderful meal. Instead of salt and pepper, I used a cajun seasoning ('cause I'm from Louisiana) and I used provolone, because that's what I had ... great flavor !! Also, I heated a can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, mushrooms, garlic, couple of splashes of white wine and s&p as a dipping sauce (or when dish is done, pour over all). And/or serve as "gravy" over pasta and chicken.  So good !

This is a very easy recipe. I added some cayanne pepper to the seasoning of the chicken and I made a cream sauce (simmer cream of mushroom, sour cream, milk, and a pinch of salt and pepper)to top it off. If you don't pound the chicken thin enough it will be hard to roll. My husband did think that there was too much cheese. I think that the cheese inside the chicken is enough. But other than that it is just delicious!

Moist, delicious, quick and easy. For a fast simple meal during a week night this recipe is the best. Yet it's still fancy enough to impress my boyfriend into thinking I'd been cooking for 2 hours.

This was excellent!!! I dipped the chicken in egg first and then coated it with the bread crumbs.  I followed the advice on the sauce(1 can cream chicken soup, 1/2cup light sourcream, 1 tbls.lemon juice.) the sauce was delicious!!  I will definatly make this again!!!!!!

This was a delicious recipe which turned out to be easy and quick to make (double bonus). My whole family enjoyed this meal. I used leftover ham from Easter dinner and also followed other reviewers suggestions to dip in egg then into the bread crumbs. I have already passed this recipe onto friends. Am wondering if they would freeze well...I am in a Freezer Cooking Exchange and I think this would be a big hit.

This was fantastice.  I slightly altered the recipe per the other reviewers by dipping the chicken in egg then rolling it in the bread crumbs, adding a pat of butter to the top or each roll,and baking at 400 for 20-25 mins.  THis was incredible!!!  I also made the cream of chick soup, sour cream, and lemon juice sauce to serve over the top!  YUMMY. Make this with the Hazelnut Mushroom rice from this site and what a gorgous gormet meal!!  Thanks Kiersten :)

We used this recipe last night for our annual Valentine's Banquet here at our camp. Everyone really seemed to enjoy it.  It probably would have been better with better quality ham and cheese. We just bought packaged lunchmeat ham, and individually wrapped (processed) Swiss cheese.  we used the sauce recipe suggested by another reviewer. Yum! (1 can cr/mushroom soup, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1 T. lemon juice)

This was ok, not as good as I was expecting.  I think I didn't pound the chicken thing enough.  The chicken was also a little dry, next time I'll try a sauce to drizzle over.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Kiersten! The first time I made it according to your instructions. The second time, for variation, I poured a can of mushroom soup mixed with a little sherry over it. Yummy!

This was great! I loved it. I told my husband I was going to make it and couldn't do it on the day I said I would. He bugged me for days until I finally did and everything turned out perfect. I used Italian bread crumbs and provolone instead of swiss (I don't like swiss). My husband loved and I will use this again. I made sure to print it and put it in my recipe box at home.

Very easy and very good. I left out the salt though since I was sure the ham and cheese would provide enough.

This recipe is delicious.  I varied it slightly by egg wash before breading, then I put enough olive oil to coat the bottom of my baking dish.  I also sprinkled a little olive oil on the top of the breaded chicken.  It not only added to the flavor, but the chicken came out really juicy.

This was very easy to make.  Did take others suggestions and made a quick and easy gravy and served over egg noodles. My boyfriend likes lots of flavor and always has to add salt and pepper..he didn't have to do it this time.  Loved it just like it was!  Thanks!

My wife loved it. I loved it. Heck even my picky vegetarian sister (who occasionally eats white meat) loved it. Its awesome. Stop reading reviews and make this. Right now. On a more serious note... I had to use Panko crumbs as I did not have regular bread crumbs and I put more than one stinking slice of ham on it. (one is never enough!!) Thanks for this recipe. I am going to tell everyone about it.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because is so easy to cook ans taste delicious. I always hear about Chicken Cordon Blu and I though it was a difficult to cook. I would think "it sound delicious but it might be hard to make". So one day I decided to look for it and I found this recipe, after reading it I though its not that hard to make, so I sent my husband for the ingredients and boom it was delicious lol and I dont even like to cook. So ladies and gentlemen if you want to win your significant other heart make this recipe and they will fall in love lol. My husband loves this recipe so it deserves 5 stars. Kuddos to the person who wrote this recipe, it is easy and delicious, thank you.

I butterflied the chicken before pounding it.  Since the rolls were quite large as a result, the cooking time had to increase.  I put a shallow layer of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan to prevent burning and covered the dish with tin foil for a half hour.  I removed the tin foil, then baked it for an additional half hour.  The chicken was fork tender and delicious!

I made this last night and it was fantastic. My entire family ate it and loved it. I did make the sauce others have suggested (1 can Cream of Mushroom Soup, 1/2 Cup of Sour Cream, 1 or 2 Tbls. of Lemon Juice) to go on top before serving. I served it with angel hair pasta and green beans and it was a hit!

For those of you complaining that the chicken was too dry, have you checked your oven with an oven thermometer to see if it isn't running too hot? Way too many people complain their recipes are too dry and then, blame the problem on the recipe! When you read a number of positive reviews and you're one of very few who complain that it is too dry, why not have your oven calibrated? 
Tip: Use the egg wash and roll into panko bread crumbs! Wow!

Pretty good, had a few additional ingredients to give it a little extra kick. Added garlic salt to the chicken, used chicken cutlets instead of breasts. The breasts seemed to be too thick and overpowered the ham/cheese. I also added a thin layer of bleu cheese dressing on the chicken before seasoning and rolling up. Came out great, compliments all around! This is my go-to recipe for a quick, but nice dinner.

Fantastic dish you'd never suspect how quick & easy it is to put together - my family loved it - even my two frustratingly picky kids liked it once I finally got them to take a bite (anything that is not mac-n-cheese is a battle). I followed the updates from LLPUTNEY from Oct 3, 2003 exactly n the sauce was awesome. Good with risotto as a side along with a veggie. :-)

This was really good. First I used a food hammer to make the chicken flat. Then I dipped it in egg wash and put it on a plate that I put the bread crumbs on. I put the ham pieces (I used ham strips) and I use mozzarella, not Swiss cheese. I put fresh black pepper and sea salt on it. I rolled it up and use toothpicks to close it.I put about 1/4 teaspoon of unsalted butter on the top of each chicken breast.. I put it in the oven and then made the sauce with a can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup of sour cream and about a tablespoon of lemon pepper seasoning (I did not have any lemon juice at home). I cooked it on the stove until it bubbled and took it off. I served it with mash and steamed green peas. It was delicious!

We served this for a little dinner party and everyone was super happy. We served it with slow roasted vegetables and the presentation was so pleasing. I asked the deli for their saltiest ham in thick slices, and for the cheese to be in super thick slices too... nom nom

2nd time making this, excellent start of a recipe!  The changes I made though were that I made a Honey/Dijon/Tarragon sauce and spread a tsp of the sauce on the INSIDE of the chicken before adding the cheese and ham, then rolled up and secured with toothpicks. I then followed other reviewer's suggestions of dipping in an egg wash before rolling in crumbs.  I used panko crumbs as that was all I had on hand.  Baked for 40 minutes and then topped with the remaining sauce and served.  Hubs raved! DEE-LISH!

Super easy! This recipe was way too easy and even my chicken hating husband liked it enough to want seconds. I did not have the kind of cheese called for so used a combo I keep on hand of grated cheddar,jack and mozzarella. I served with seasoned rice, corn and a cheddar cheese sauce. Thanks for posting this recipe. I never knew chicken cordon bleu was this easy.

Good but hard to pound those puppies! I flattened mine slightly, breaded, fried, then at the end added the ham and cheese, covered and cooked until the cheese melted. Excellent with honey mustard!

The family loved this recipe so much!! They asked if I would make again. When my hubby came home from work he said " that smells so good I know it's gonna be delish! I did use the sauce and followed the "roll in the crumbs" idea.  Great!! Thanks so much!!

I couldn't see how the cheese was going to stay inside without a good sealing of breadcrumbs, but tried the recipe anyway.  Well, the cheese all melted out and stuck to the pan.  I'll stick with Cordon Bleu the traditional way.

Absolutely delicious!  Added the sauce (1 can reduced fat cream of chicken, 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream & 1T lemon juice) prior to baking, served with garlic mashed potatoes & broiled asparagus....YUM!  Looks like a meal that took hours to prepare, but literally only takes minutes!  Just waiting for it to come out of the oven is agony!

I too added the egg wash and butter pads. Made a sauce of chicken stock, chopped leeks, shallots, parsley, rice flour, and salt as well. I should add white wine to the sauce, but it was quite good when the chicken is baked in the sauce. Hold back some sauce/wine/stock at the end to finish.

I can only give 4 stars for this recipe because I made a change to the original recipe. I was worried that the recipe would be dry so I mixed mayo and dijon mustard. I spread a thin layer on the chicken breast, then added the cheese and ham. After I rolled the breast I added a think layer of the mustard/mayo mixture to the top of the breast and then added the bread crumbs. I think the recipe is a five star recipe on its own but the mayo/mustard added a great flavor. For the ham I used deli sliced black forest ham which is generally less salty. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Bigger chicken breasts definately work better. I really wanted to make this verbatim but didn't want to go to the store. I had breast filets, low fat cream cheese and cubed ham... Took a little more tweaking, but I pulled it off. I added a sprinkle of shredded cheddar to the cream cheese. (probably a big tablespoon worth of cheesy mixture to each chicken slice rolled with ham cubes in the middle.  Then I pounded my chickens thinner. Otherwise I followed the recipe and did the salt and pepper thing, and bread crumbs. The sauce the first review listed was AWESOME!!! I can't wait to get normal sized chicken and try this recipe.

I give a 4 as written. I pounded the breasts, filled with fontina cheese and ham then rolled up and put in an eggwash and the breadcrumb. baked at 350. the cheese was closer to the swiss flavor but melts like a dream. the toothpicks were nearly impossible to get out, so make sure you count how many you put in, we had to cut them out.

This was awesome! Changes I made: I used an egg wash, I sprinkled some of the bread crumbs in the bottom of baking dish. Instead of rolling up the chicken, ham, and cheese, I butterflied the breasts and just put the ham and cheese inside. This way I didn't have to thin the chicken or use the toothpicks. I then sprinkled the rest of the crumbs on top of the breasts. I took the advise of others and put some butter on top before baking @400 for 25 min. I also made the sauce that came from the Aussie chicken recipe and used it as a dip. It was great with brown rice. PERFECTION!!

Noone in my family had ever eaten this before. We all though it was delicious! I dredged the breasts in margarine before placing on a layer of breadcrumbs and rolling. I also never use a toothpick when I roll chicken. Works beautifully by just laying the chicken seam side down! I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  I use cubed ham that I keep in little baggies in the freezer for when I make it.  I use Panko bread crumbs with paprika in them.  We mix up the cheeses for variety.  Anything from swiss to pepperjack to provolone.  It's all good!

This is my favorite go-to recipe. I know it will turn out PERFECT every time, and it's always impressive. I do add a spoonful of butter to the top of every piece of chicken in the beginning and then in the last 5 minutes I add the piece of cheese to melt. The chicken turns out so tender and flavorful it's amazing.

So easy!  Took some other tips...dipped rolls in melted butter, then covered in breadcrumbs.  Cooked 20 mins at 400 degrees.  Wont change a thing!  The butter kept it moist enough for my taste, so I opted not to make a sauce.

This recipe is incredible! I was worried it was going to be difficult to make, but I was able to prepare it in no time! I must say, once it was ready, it was so delicious! My boyfriend pretty much licked off his plate and the pan! lol I followed the recipe as is, the only thing I did differently was dip the chicken into a beaten egg and then into the crumbs. I also spread some melted butter on top of the chicken before putting it into the oven. One of the best dishes I've ever made! I was definitely proud of myself. Everyone should make it, it is so simple!

This is a great, easy recipe.  I did change two things.  First, I put at least two slices of swiss cheese in the chicken.  You really couldn't taste the cheese with only one slice.  Secondly, after I rolled up the chicken I dipped it in egg then in bread crumbs.  It came out perfect.

**This is not a dish to make with little kids running around.** Chicken all over my hands and the work area!  However, it is bland in a way that kids like it, but not in the way that husbands like it.   It wasn't really that hard, but it was time consuming for me to assemble without touching raw-chickeny fingers to everything.   One of the reviews had a sauce using cream of chicken, sour cream, and lemon which was a good idea.

I made a couple of changes to this recipe also.  I rolled the rolled breasts in melted butter and then in seasoned bread crumbs.  These will also freeze very well uncooked.  I make a at least a dozen or so at a time, freeze them on a cookie sheet and the next day put them in ziplock bag.  We then can take out one or two and cook them in the toaster oven at 400F for 30 to 40 min.

This was very good, although it needs a sauce to go with it.  I adapted a sauce from another chicken cordon bleu recipe on this site and used 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 tablespoons of milk and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.  Adjust the milk to desired consistency.  With the sauce for added flavor, I would give this 5 stars.

Wow...I have never been a big fan of chicken cordon bleu, but my girlfriend recently told me it was her favorite, so I decided to do a little practice before I made it for her. I volunteered to cook for my family tonight, and this recipe was a hit. I used garlic and herb bread crumbs, and pre-packaged ham slices along with the Swiss cheese. Let's just say I am now a fan of this dish, and I'll definitely be making this for my girlfriend one of these weekends.

MMMM mmm! This is my 1st time ever cooking anything besides mac-n-cheese, and I was so proud! This was extremely easy and it looks wonderful.  The chicken breast came out PERFECT, it was so tender and juicy.  I followed the recipe exactly, too.

YUMM!!  I combined a lot of the other suggestions such as brushed the rolls with egg, put breadcrumbs on the bottom of the pan and all over the outside of the roll, put little pats of butter on the top of each roll, and baked it at 400 for 25 minutes.   They turned out so delicious! It was like we were eating at a restaurant, I will definitely make this again!

Very forgiving. I sliced through the breasts. Barely pounded at all. Brushed with combo of mayo/mustard, added lite swiss and julienned leftover Easter ham. Rolled messily using many toothpicks (keep a count). Sprayed pan and breasts with cooking spray. Rolled in a mix of poultry stuffing and plain bread crumbs (to cut the salt). Topped with cream of mushroom soup + 1/2 can water. Covered with foil. Cooked as recommended. Remove foil last 10 mins. Receive compliments. Thanks.

Yum! I brushed a beaten egg over the chicken before rolling in bread crumbs. Also, I  put a small pat of butter on top of each chicken roll before baking. Came out moist and delicious and I will make these again!

Good recipe, but did come out a little dry for me. Next time, I'll follow some of the other reviewers advice by raising the oven temp to 400° F (200° C) and cooking for only 20-25 min. With that modification, it'll surely earn the 4 stars I rated it. NOTE: I pounded the chicken between 2 pieces of parchment paper - no mess that way. Thanks!

I've made this for guests twice, and both times it's met with hearty approval.  (Which is not to say that it's hard to make; it's really not, and I've actually always found the chicken-smashing-part more than a little therapeutic.)  I brush the inside-side of the chicken with light sour cream or mayonnaise - whatever's in the fridge - and then do the same with the completed rolls.  Generally I use Gruyere cheese; I've used both deli ham and prosciutto.  Both were good the first time around, but my fella said proscuitto was a little dry when the chicken was reheated.  (I'm never fast enough to get to the leftovers.)  The chicken itself is always moist and delicious!

I used Montoray Jack Cheese with this recipe and my family absolutely loved it.  My 6 year old has requested it for dinner every night since I cooked it.  :) Tonight I am trying porvolone cheese!!! Can't wait to see which they like better. Oh and I rolled the chicken in the breading to evenly coat it instead of sprinkling.

Served for friends... very QUICK and easy.  Beautiful presentation and best of all, it tasted great! Not bad on calories, either.  I added a bit of sauted spinach for color.

This was a very simple chicken recipe.  I used a couple of beaten eggs to help the bread crumbs adhere onto the chicken.  I also slightly browned it on a skillet to make it crispy before putting it in the oven.

Very tasty!  Instead of pounding the breast thin, I just cut a pocket (basically butterflied) the chicken breasts, then filled with sliced ham and cheese before closing up.  I also dipped the stuffed chicken in egg before breading it.  Very easy, very quick, and very good.  Thanks!

This was the EASIEST chicken cordon bleu recipe I've tried.  I used extra tender chicken and it stayed moist and tender.  An alternative to using mayonnaise (as some reviewers have) is to roll the chicken in olive oil and then in the bread crumbs.  My husband & kids liked it too.  I'm making it again this weekend when my parents visit!

This was great!  Fast, easy, and flavorful.  I seasoned the chicken to my taste with onion and garlic powder, pepper, and parparika.  Only thing I would suggest is placing more ham and cheese on the chicken before rolling and spreading alittle mayo in chicken before using bread crumbs like another rater suggested.  It helps the bread crumbs stay on.  My household liked this.  Will make again with dijon mustard for a change in flavor.  Thanks submitter.

Simple and delicious.  I made the sauce that everyone was talking about (1 can cream of mushroom/chicken soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream, and 1 tablespoon of lemon/lime juice), and it was delicious.  This dish is probably best with a side dish of baked potatoes.

I loved this recipe - It is so easy and comes out so tasty and elegant.  I solved the dry chicken problem by spreading some mayo  and dijon mustard on the chicken before adding the ham and cheese. The chicken wasn't dry and it tasted great. (I even used light Miracle Whip.) Oh- I used Monteray Jack instead of Swiss, and that also worked well.

I made this recipe for my husband and I for a date night, it is great!  I used provolone for my chicken. I only had Italian seasoned bread crumbs to roll them in, won't do that again...
I will be making this for the whole family soon!

I left the preparation of this dish to my husband, who loves to cook. Instead of pounding the chicken, he simply cut it in half lengthwise, and used the chicken like a pocket to stuff the ham and cheese inside. Simply brush the chicken with egg and coat with breadcrumbs. I recommend a dab of butter to keep the chicken a little more moist. Wonderful with a cheddar cheese sauce poured over the top. Serve with french-fried garlic beans and warm bread and butter. This recipe is so easy, but tastes and looks wonderful!

My husband and children LOVED this recipe.  I also used provolone instead of swiss.  Also instaed of pounding the chicken breast thin, my husband carved them completely in half.  The chicken was then the perfect thickness and doubled the servings.

I love this recipe.  It's easy to make, delicious, and accepts substitues with ease.  When I first made it I used Dijon instead of yellow mustard.  Delicious!  I also didn't have ham on hand so I used roasted turkey.  I've used ham ever since, which is better than turkey because of the saltiness.  I rolled these in the breadcrumbs rather than sprinkling the crumbs over.

This tasted quite good, but was rather difficult to get together in a way that didn't lose half the cheese and make a huge mess.
I definitely still reccomend fixing it, just give yourself a little extra time to mess with getting everything rolled together.

Overall, pretty good.  I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs and had to use regular (with a little garlic salt mixed in).  Turned out quite well and my husband and his friend both loved it.  I too used the sauce in Michelle's recipe.  Yummy!  Will make again.

I use same recipe but roll chicken in panko crumbs that have been moistened with a little olive oil.  I cook my chicken on parchment paper.   No sticking at all.  It's a favorite and so easy.

Everyone in my family loved it. Like others have said, I brushed with egg and then coated entirely with seasoned breadcrumbs and put a little butter on top. For those  who don't like ham, I replaced the ham with  fresh spinach and cheese( mozzarella or Swiss). Turns out great and gives variety.

I made this for the first time tonight for dinner. I did make a couple of changes after reading the reviews. I butterflied the chicken breasts and then pounded them. I seasoned the inside of each breast with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Then added the Swiss cheese and ham. Rolled each breast. Coated each piece of chicken with a dollop of sour cream  and then rolled each in seasoned bread crumbs. Put a pat of unsalted butter on the top of each piece of chicken. 5 minutes before the chicken was done, I basted each with the juice in the pan. Oh my goodness, it was delicious!

Turned out sooooo good:) I marinated the chicken in olive oil and seasonings for 12 hours before hand (made it very tender/juicy). I put shake n' back hot & spicy in place of bread crumbs. We will be making this one again!!

Oh yum! I always read reviews before I cook and between the original recipe and suggestions in the reviews this was wonderful! I used Egg Beaters to wash the chicken after I rolled it up (I butterflied one breast and pounded the other) and used Polish deli ham (I agree that regular ham would taste better) AND made the sauce. With rice and broccoli this was a fabulous meal! Keeping this one in the rotation for sure!

After reading several reviews, I added Paprika and Garlic powder to the breadcrumbs. The store had thin sliced chicken breast and it worked great. I rolled the folded chicken in egg and then in the breadcrumbs. Then I topped the whole thing with a pad of butter. I also made a sauce of Cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and fresh lemon juice. Turned out great.

Overall, very good! Some suggestions:

Replace half of the bread crumbs with panko bread crumbs for extra texture. Salt only one side of the breast to account for the ham. I dipped both sides of the breast in bread crumbs before rolling it up. I used American cheese and deli honey ham since that it what I had on hand. I also added a pat of butter on top. I baked it at 375 F for 30 minutes, which was fine since the temperature of the chicken read correctly (165 F) in several places. I'll make the sauce next time since I didn't have soup on hand.

Absolutely yummy and easy.  I was never big on chicken cordon bleu, but this one is delish.  I also hate when people change the recipe, but I had to based on what I had on hand.  I used muenster cheese and ham.  I also wrapped 2 pieces of bacon around chicken and baked.  I agree with others and made the sauce (can of cream of chicken, 1/2 cup of sour cream, Tbls of lemon juice) to pour over top of chicken after baked.  Do not bake sauce with chicken.  After the 1st bite, my husband moaned, said "I outdid myself this time" and kissed me.  Wow..... now that is good stuff to get all that :)

Awesome recipe. Made as written and turned out perfect! My boyfriend and I fought over the leftovers! Definitely helped having larger chicken breasts and pounding them flat.

Amazing!! We loved it! The only thing is the chicken needs to be dipped in melted butter first then ham and cheese, then the breadcrumbs! So good!

Delicious! We followed the top rated comments re: the egg wash and the sauce (cream of chicken soup, sour cream, lemon juice). We made 16 servings of this for a dinner party and everyone (well, the meat-eaters anyway) enjoyed it - some went back for 2nds.

This is so simple, and tastes amazing. All of my roommates were in love with this. I did use the cream sauce and substituted provolone for swiss. If cooking at higher altitudes you need to bake for 45-50 mins. Quick and simple and everyone will love it!!!

The fiance loved it.  We added a white wine sauce borrowed from another cordon bleu recipe and it made it even more spectacular.  I'm going to continue to tweak this recipe to get a thicker layer of breading.

The reviewers who called this recipe "super easy" obviously like being in the kitchen more than I do. That said, it certainly wasn't difficult and it was quite tasty. I will likely make this recipe again, though I think I will try using kitchen twine rather than toothpicks, as the toothpicks were a bit cumbersome to work with.

excellent and very easy to make. i did use the sauce another review suggested (can of cream of chicken, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 tbsp lemon juice) and that added the perfect finishing touch. if you have a publix grocery store, i used their black forest ham, which is my favorite sliced ham.

The family is raving. They loved the dish. I did change a few things and that is why I gave it the 4 star rating. I went with some of the other reviews and dipped the roll in egg before the breadcrumbs. I also added a pad of butter on top of each roll. Then I also added a cream sauce.

What I did a little differently was that I doubled the cheese and ham, didn't put any cheese on top, seasoned the chicken after rolling with sea salt and lemon pepper. 

It turned out beautifully and there isn't any left, which is always a good sign. Served with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, and stuffing.

I can rarely take a recipe and make it exactly like it reads.  I pounded out my chicken breasts, salt and peppered what would be the inside of the roll.  Then I added one slice of swiss cheese to each, breaking it in half for each slice so it wouldn't hang off the chicken.  Then I folded a slice of ham and placed it on the swiss, again so it was not hanging off.   Then I rolled the chicken up secured it with a toothpick and dipped it into an eggwash and then sprinkled a mixture of crumbled crushed Wheat Thin crackers, dried Thyme and olive oil.  The Thyme really made this dish.  My husband loved it.

I dipped the chicken breast in egg wash and bread crumbs then browned it in a pan with some olive oil. I made a cheese sauce to go on top that was a big hit. I made a simple rue and added milk, american, mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, pepper and garlic powder. I have also made this sauce into Mac & Cheese!

Rolled chicken rolls in melted butter before rolling in breadcrumbs which I mistakenly added chili powder instead of paprika (both bottles have red lids) It was fantastic!! Used Cream of Chicken soup diluted with a little milk and added green peas to make a sauce. Will keep as a favorite recipe. Thank you!

Great dinner! Definately a keeper. I noticed one reviewer said they would coat the whole chicken breast instead of just the top. Gotta say, this recipe does not say to cover just the top. It says to sprinkle evenly...
Love it love it LOVE IT!!!

Tasty but could be a little more inspired. I butterflied the breasts instead of pounding and it seemed to work okay.  I used olive oil to make my bread crumbs stick (and which made the chicken more moist) and didn't change the cook time. Next time I will add more ham. We liked ours with honey mustard on the side.

I made this last night for dinner.  I did make a few changes though.  First, I dipped my chicken in a mixture of melted butter and Djohn Mustard, than I pressed the outside of the chicken into Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.  I also added some extra Swiss Cheese into the middle.  I baked it for 25 min. and added more cheese to the top of the chicken and baked it for 5 more min.  This was perfectly moist and simply delicious!  My family (especially hubby) enjoyed it!  I liked that this recipe gave me a base to start with and be able to play around with a bit.  Thanks...!!

I thought it was good, but, I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used half potato chips and half ritz crackers, rolled the little parcels in melted butter, didn't see the need for the egg dip, that tasted great...until I put the sauce on it!  Now I am  wishing I had left it out or put it on the side, since it soggified the crispy crust I had!! A little voice inside told me not to, but I did it anyway. Why do I do that? I also did the 400 degrees for about 25 mins. Live and learn

Used apple juice instead of wine and I did the egg dip/ roll in bread crumbs to the chicken.  I cooked it at 400 for 25.  (It ended up resting for an extra 10 minutes).
Very yummy! 
Didn't make the gravy, but could have.  The kids loved it too, they hate Swiss cheese but didn't realize that was the cheese in it!  Win!
Served it will Caesar salad and microwave risotto from this site.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was AWESOME!
I was worried because it didn't use egg to
coat the chicken, but the bread crumbs stayed
on just fine. We will definitely make this one
again soon!

This was awesome.  I used garlic & herb bread crumbs, provolone cheese, and I dipped it in the egg wash.  I also made the honey mustard sauce.  I will definately be making this again, my husband loved it!  He's been begging me to make it for a while now, and this was the perfect recipe.  Thanks!

I'm not an expert chef by any means, and I followed this recipe and it turned out great! I didn't salt the chicken at all, however, because I used sliced sandwich ham & swiss cheese which both are fairly salty. I also dipped my chicken in an egg wash and then into italian bread crumbs before rolling the ham and cheese. I didn't have cream of chicken/mushroom soup so I skipped the sauce and it was still delicious by itself. When you cut into the chicken after it is cooked, it comes out in a perfect spiral and presentation is so nice! Thanks for the recipe!

I make the recipe as is on a regular basis, everybody in my family loves them! Super simple and delicious!
I roll mine on a plate of bread crumbs and keep them in place with tooth picks. I think I'm going to go ahead and start making a sauce with cream of chicken soup to put on top so they are a little more moist.
Super delicious! :)

Made with Aussie Chicken Sauce and it was delightful.  My husband scraped the plate and wished for more.  Used Chicken Cutlets from grocery store and deli ham and shredded swiss.  Perfect and easy.

Pretty good. We loved the flavor. I had guests arriving as I was making it and forgot to read The end of step 3 about the bread crumbs and the end of step 4 about adding the cheese. So the chicken was dry on top. Definitely doing those steps next time.

I spread Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb Cheese on each chicken breast and then add the ham slice. SO GOOD that way.

This was good, but I'm not sure it was worth the effort.  Try as I might, I couldn't get the chicken breasts flattened enough to roll them so just sort of folded them over the filling.  But they looked ok, and tasted pretty good.  Everybody seemed to like them.

Very good meal. I did the flour and egg wash before the crumbs too but I suggest tying the chicken together before that so it stays together better.  The chicken soup and sour cream sauce was fabulous as well.  I served with white rice and asparagus-big hit by all 5 of us.

I made this for my parent's 40th anniversary and EVERYONE loved it! I dipped the chicken in melted butter then rolled in bread crumbs before placing in the baking dish. I had a dish of swiss cheese and pepper jack cheese. Both were delicious. The breasts were also very large so I cooked them about 40 minutes. Would definately make again!

This was easy and it turned out to be a wonderful dinner. I complemented it with small red potatoes in butter toped with fresh dill from my window herb garden. French style green beans sautéed in butter with scallions and garlic Topped with a mushroom cream sauce   
Yummy Yummy there was a party in my tummy!

This is among the best recipes I've tried off this site and that says alot! I used crushed croutons (garlic and butter) I followed a reviewers advice and dipped the chicken in egg before laying it on the croutons, topping it with ham and cheese and then rolling.

Hubby loved it. I've been wanting to make this for a long time but thought I'd have to butterfly the chicken and I'm not that handy with knives. This recipe made it easy.

I also tried the sauce another reviewer mentioned. I didn't really like it. It didn't really have flavor at first and then the lemon hit me. I think it's a good base but use less llemon maybe a teaspoon or even 1/2 teaspoon and maybe add some chicken broth or buillion. A chicken ramen flavor packet might work nice for that.

This was so easy! And so good! I used the "carving board" ham that you find in the store in the lunch meat section and Sargento Swiss cheese and Delallo plain bread crumbs. I followed the directions other than cooking it a little longer than said, because I used large chicken breasts. I will be making this again very soon!

4 stars because it just didn't go together as easy as I imagined. but tasted WONDERFUL,Very moist, and did NOT need a sauce, but I made a hollandaise sauce anyways, was a nice addition, I also put bread crumbs on top of them before baking.

Very easy recipe, and my husband like it.  Next time I'll add more cheese, as we couldn't really taste any cheese.  I'll also try baking it a little lower temp for longer, as the chicken was very dry.

Great recipe!! I took the advice of most reviewers and dipped the chicken in egg wash and rolled it on the bread crumbs. I also made a sauce with cream of mush and sour cream. Excellent and a pretty dish to serve. I posted my picture.

This was very very tasty and was a big hit with my guests. I took the advice of some reviewers and dredged the chicken in a seasoned egg wash and then placed it on a plate of breadcrumbs. While getting coated with breadcrumbs on one side, I added the ham and cheese and rolled it from there and sealed it with a toothpick. I liked the light even coating of breadcrumbs rather than having them placed on top. I served it with hollandaise sauce.

When I baked it for the given amount of time, the inside was still very raw, so I had to bake it for an additional 20 minutes (to bring it just to cooked through), which threw off my timing but it was worth it.

When I make this, to give it alittle more zing, I spread Dijon mustard on the chicken first, then place the hand and cheese and then roll it up and roll in bread crumbs.  The mustard gives it alot of flavor.

This was delicious! My son asked to Parmesan cheese instead on his. It was all wonderful. I used the cream of chicken soup and sour cream for the sauce. Combination of \homemade bread crumbs & seasoned breadcrumbs. skipped the egg wash. Moist, tender. & tasty. I will make this again.

It seemed a bit bland to me personally, but it was healthy and would likely be enjoyed by others.

VERY good! :o)  I used leftover ham from Christmas and it was good, but I am betting it will be better with sliced ham. I also used provalone and it was great!  We were not much for the "sauce" with the cream of chix, sour cream etc. That was just ok and really? The chicken was so tender we didnt even need it! :o)

I liked it fine, but my husband is the real judge.  He really liked it and said to give it 5 stars.  I'll definitely be making this again.;

Very good. Used the sauce recipe with it (1 can cream of chix, 1/2 c. sour cream, dash of lemon juice, and a dash of milk. heated in sauce pan) Was awesome!

Although I made mine a little thicker which added some cooking time, an excellent recipe.

SO GOOD!!! first time making Cordon Bleu and this recipe was a great one to start with! It was very easy to make. I took the adivce and rolled the chicken in the eggs to help the bread crumbs stick. Instead of punding the chicken I just cut the breast in half and it made them thinner and it cut down on the cooking time! Can't wait to make it again :)

I thought this was very good!  I also took the advise of others and dipped in egg 1st, then placed the chicken breast on a different plate that I had my bread crumbs on, added shredded swiss and deli sliced ham, rolled them so one entire side had bread crumbs.  The breading that I had was Italian seasoned croutons that I broke up into crumbs... that added a lot of flavor!  I also put a pat of butter on each breast and baked at a higher temp then broiled for a short time to make the breading crispy.  Very good!  For sure a keeper!

This was fantastic.  I didn't have ham, so I cooked up some bacon and used it.  My husband said after the first bite that he had a "party in his mouth" and that it is now his favorite thing I make.  Thanks Kiersten!

This chicken turned out great! I used panko bread crumbs. I dipped the chicken in flour then egg then I added plenty of swiss cheese and ham. The chicken turned out tender and juicy. I served the chicken with buttered egg noodles with fresh parsley and pec romano cheese and with baby carrots. Thank you for a great recipe!

I absolutely LOVED this when I made it for Sunday dinner yesterday.  I am so grateful for those that have tried it before because I was able to combine several ideas to get mine right.  I did not have to go through the trial and error period by reading other reviews.  And the chicken breast that I purchased from Sam's were so huge that even after being cut in half and pounded, my husband had a hard time eating 1.   I incorrectly combined several reviews that were seperate and ended up having a sauce that consisted of sour cream, cream of chicken, white wine, lemon juice & splenda (because I squeezed too much of the lemon juice into the  mixture).  But even my particular Southern mother (who is the epitome of a Soul food mom) liked it which indicated to me that it was great.   I love ths site.  I will never have to purchase another cookbook again.

Made it just like the most helpful review suggested, and it turned out great. I don't think the chicken really needs the sauce. But the sauce is nice to have if you're serving with rice.

Awesome recipe. I made a few minor changes.   1) I purchased thin sliced chicken breasts. It saves you from having to pound the chicken.   2) I dipped the chicken in flour mixed with paprika, then egg, then bread crumbs. Then I placed the cheese rolled inside of the ham (to avoid spilling out) and then rolled it all inside the chicken breast.   ** I use provolone cheese! It is creamier and goes over much better with my family**  3) I placed a dab of butter on each breast.   4) I made the sauce as someone else suggested with cream of chicken soup, sour cream and lemon juice. My mother in law makes a better sauce though. I need to get the receipe for it. It has more of  cheese flavor.

I just finished up the dishes from this fantastic meal! I got big, fat chicken breasts and flattened them between two sheets of cling wrap with the back side of my favorite cast iron skillet. I doubled the recipe, so I used .75 pounds of honey baked ham from the deli, .5 pounds of provolone cheese, and .5 pounds of aged swiss. I also dipped my chicken breasts in egg before coating in Italian seasoned bread crumbs, then layered the swiss cheese and ham onto the chicken before rolling, then placed a pad of butter onto the rolls.  After baking for 25 minutes, I shook more bread crumbs on top of the rolls, then placed a half-slice of thick-sliced provolone on top. I baked for another 15 minutes, just enough for the cheese to start to brown.  Also, for the sauce, I used one can of cream of mushroom, one can of cream of chicken, and a cup of sour cream, plus 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and a pinch of sugar.  I served the rolls on top of mini farfalle pasta, with bacon-roasted red potatoes and crescent rolls. My husband loved it, my almost-4-year old loved it, my 18-month old loved it, and I'm about to pop!  Thanks for the basic part of one of my new favorite recipes, Kiersten!

I followed the other recommendations. Adding an egg before the breadcrumbs, then topping with a slice of butter. I also made the sauce others recommended. Overall this is delicious! My only thought is that next time I make this I want to add a little more swiss cheese and ham. I served this over brown rice with fresh green beans on the side. My husband enjoyed the meal and really liked the sauce!

My family absolutely raved over this dish. I changed the recipe a tad. I rolled two thin slices of black forest ham and a slice of Swiss cheese into each piece of chicken. Instead of breadcrumbs (I had none), I used a mixture of crushed buttery crackers and panko crumbs, mixed with some garlic powder and cayenne pepper. The panko made the coating especially crispy, and I think I prefer that to the usual breadcrumb coating, which I have used before. I will make this recipe again with my alterations! Love it!

If you completely change the ingredients and recipe, then my advice is to write your own. This recipe is good as is. Obviously there are many ways to alter a recipe according to your taste; I did but I don't share because I don't care to hear any of your numerous adjustments.

Our oldest daughter absolutely loves Chicken Cordon Bleu. She was not disappointed with the results from this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I rolled the chicken in melted butter before I dredged them in the bread crumbs. They were impressive enough that I could have served them to company, but easy enough to fix quickly for dinner after I come home from work. I served them with mashed potatoes and fried corn, which was perfect. This is a great recipe.

This was very easy and good. I did the whole egg wash thing and cooked at 400 for 25 min. My suggestion if you like cripy chicken is to put it under the broiler 5 min. Make sure to allow your chx to rest for atleast 5 min after pulling it out of the oven.

If I could give this more stars I would. This was so great and all the kids loved it which makes the recipe great in itself.  I made a honey mustard dipping sauce to go with made with 1/4 cp of mayo, 1 tbl honey, 1 tbl coarse ground mustard, 1/2 tbs of regular mustard, and 1/2 tbs of lemon juice.  The kids were fighting over the extra piece.  I will def make again.

I love Chicken Cordon Bleu and have been making it like this for about 5-6 years.  I always need to bake my chicken for much longer though...about an hour at 350 degrees.  They always come out juicy, never dry.

Wow...my husband and kids have found their new favorite meal.  It is really hard to get my 6 and 3 year old boys to eat meat, but they loved this recipe.  The chicken was so tender and the bread crumbs added a lot.  I added some Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and that added a lot of flavor.

really really good! I place the ham and cheese in the center of the breast and then roll. To get the bread crumbs to stick, I dip the roll into melted butter and then into the crumbs. A honey mustard sauce (half and half, sour cream, mayo, mustard, honey) is great on top. My husband asks for it all of the time now.

Easy and delicious!  I used a mix of shredded Gruyere and mozzarella, as that's what I had on hand, and sprayed the chicken rolls with canola cooking spray before dredging in bread crumbs.  Only change I would have made was to maybe add some paprika to the bread crumbs for more color next time.  I skipped the extra melted cheese on top as my husband's not a big fan - the cheese inside was enough.

Excellent. I kick it up a notch by mixing 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.

THE BEST! I followed the suggestions after reading the reviews from others; 1) I coated the chicken breasts in egg and breaded them, then rolled up the ham and cheese in the chicken. **2) I also served the chicken with the "Aussie Chicken" (honey mustard)sauce recipe...These cutlets were to die for...My whole family loved them, including my 3-year-old son; he ate 2! Thanks for a great recipe

I think this is the best chicken dish I have ever made. My boyfriend wanted to give it a 4 only b/c it wasn't lobster. What does he know? I did use the honey mustard sauce and it was great! I severed it with a side of green beans and wild rice.

I am only giving this 4 because I did add alittle to the recipe as did others. This is a very good basic start to build on. I started off flattening the chicken breasts. I them rolled them with Swiss cheese and thin sliced ham. I rolled them in egg (mixed w/ a little water) and seasoned bread crumbs. I seasoned the chicken breasts with season salt and pepper first. I put the chicken breasts in a pan sprayed with a non-stick spray. I cooked at 400 for about 35 min. until done. In a side pan I mixed 1 can creame chicken soup ( I used low fat) about 1/2 cup white wine, 1 tbsp chopped garlic and a little season salt to taste. I simmered it for a short while and then added about 4 slices of 2% processed swiss cheese. (reg would work also) This sauce made the dish. YUMMY!!

This was an exceptional recipe. Not difficult, yet absolutely delicious. I never do well with rolling chicken breasts, so I too cut them in half and put the cheese and ham on the inside. I did dip the breasts in eggs and then coated them with Italian bread crumbs. Thanks for a super recipe.

This recipe was wonderful!  I did add some Dijon inside the roll and a slice of butter atop AND a slice of cheese on top and I used Provolone instead of Swiss because I dislike Swiss myself. My boyfriend loved this recipe and I would definitely keep this first in mind for guests!  

Also:  If you pound each chicken breast inside a large ziplock, no mess, VERY easy, use the same ziplock for each piece too.  I tried with the parchment paper and saran wrap and it just doesn't work as well as a good ole ziplock.

This is absolutely delicious!  A favorite for my husband when served with mashed potatoes.  I used provolone at first, but for a little extra kick, buy Jalapeno Jack.  It takes a few extra minutes to slice the cheese and the rolls may not come out as flat, but it is well worth it!  I also used crushed Ritz crackers.

This meal was delicious. I made it for my girlfriend after a long day of work. The only change I made was using cream of chicken as a sauce topping. I followed the recipe exactly besides the sauce. She really loved it. Will make again!

I wouldnt say this was 'Quick and Easy' but it was awesome.  I put honey mustard down first, then proscuitto, then shredded swiss, mozz, and cheddar (its what i had).  i rolled it all up and dipped the whole thing in egg then breadcrumbs.  i made the sauce too - cream of celery soup with sour cream.  it was AWESOME!

I am making this right now!  I did listen to one of the reviews and spred a little may and mustard on the chicken breast before layering the ham and cheese.  I used slice ham from the deli (its what I had) and alpine lace (its a light) provolone cheese (again because it is what I had on hand.)  I sprinkled the breadcrumbs on top to keep it lighter and added lowfat cream of mushroom soup and half a can of water to the dish.  I covered it with foil for 20 minutes at 350 and then baked it without foil for another 20 (I like it crispy.)  Served it with french cut green beans with toasted almonds.  

IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

This is always a winner.  Nice way to jazz up some chicken breasts.  I like to leave the crumbs off, though, and perhaps prepare some hollandaise sauce as a topper.

My husband is pretty particular about food and was very skeptical about this dish when he saw it on the meal plan.  But I was undetered in trying it because of the rave reviews.  After one bite, my hubby said, "wow, this is good!"  Now it's one of his favorites.  After reading some reviews, I breaded both sides of the chicken and topped it with a little butter before baking.  I served it with honey mustard drizzled on top.

This is a great recipe. needs to be cooked a little longer. I tried gluten free bread crumbs instead of "normal" bread crumbs and it turned out great.  I like the butter instead of eggs.

Very easy, very good.  Family was impressed even though they looked funny.  Will try other cheeses or mayo in the future.  I think it might be good with ranch dressing - family doesn't care for honey mustard.

Great recipe, my 2yr old to my 10 yr old loved it! I think next time I would add more cheese. The only change I made to the recipe was I dipped the chicken in egg and then coated it in the bread crumbs. Thanks!

This is very easy to make. I place the chiken breasts in ziploc type bags to pound them down, it avoids a mess and the resuts are nicer with the meat being between plastic sheets anyway. I also use oregano instead of salt (plenty of salt in the ham), and brown the rolls in the pan instead of using breading for a lighter results. A success every time, they don't last long.

First time I made it, don't think I got the chicken flattened enough.  I went and bought a good meat mallet and that was helpful.  I thought it was really good and everybody liked it.  Tonight I rolled in a little shake and bake before baking, gave it some extra zip.

Any tips on flattening the chicken?

As is, I gave it a 4, but after taking other's advice, I coated the rolled breasts with a thin layer of mayo and honey dijon to make the  bread crumbs stick and it turned into a really simple and scrumptious 5* plus. Another real keeper from your site.Thanx kiersten.

This was VERY easy to make and my boys had seconds!  Definitely a keeper. Just make sure you pound the chicken very thin to make it easy to roll up.

omg, I made this tonight for dinner and I got a 10 out of 10 from everyone. I did change a few things. I used melted butter to dip the raw chicken in to make sure the bread crumps stay put. And I breaded both sides of chicken with bread crumps. Everything else is the same. Thanks..WOW..will make again.

I have always wanted to make this dish.  This recipe was very easy to prepare.  My entire family gave it a "thumbs up."  Will definately make it again.   Definately need a meat mallet to pound the chicken.  I put a thin layer of mayonnaise on the chicken before adding the bread crumbs as suggested by others--very moist chicken. We loved it!  I also made a cream sauce of cream of chicken soup, sour cream and juice of one lemon. My children liked to dip it in the sauce.  I liked it both ways.

Absolutely yummy!! I made five chicken breasts, and it wasn't enough! My kids even loved this. I did melt butter and drizzled it over chicken before baking, which made the crust crispier, yet moistened the chicken. YUMMY!! Yes, I will make this again.........soon!  Thanks!

Great basic recipe and less prep. time than some other recipes. For those of you who find it a bit bland try  spreading the chicken with dijon mustard before putting on the ham and cheese. Will definatley make again.

I made this for my husband, since he loves cordon bleu. He ranted and raved about how good it was. Best chicken cordon bleu he's ever had!! Made it exactly to rescipe with two changes. Sprinkled the bottom of the pan with breadcrumbs and placed a pat of butter atop the breasts. Came out perfect!!

Excellent, easy, and quick to make.  I made the following slight changes - I pounded the chicken and then sprinkled adobo seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  I then coated the entire chicken breast with seasoned bread crumbs.  In the last 5 minutes in the oven (before adding the cheese), I melted some butter and sprinkled it onto the chicken which was awesome - made it juicy and crunchy at the same time.

This will be another to add in my recipe book. I suggest:
 pounding the chicken in freezer bags to cut down on mess
 I used medium chicken breasts and cut off all remaining fat
 tucking them at the ends and securing with toothpicks because most of the cheese leaked out
 I needed to increase cooking time up to about 1.5 hours because the chicken was still pink, so next time I'll put foil over it for the first half and then take it off to let them brown
 I used Progresso's Italian seasoned bread crumbs and found the overall taste to be good.

I would fix it again, however, like others suggested, I would make some kind of honey mustard sauce to go with it.

I followed other reviewers advice and used the honey-mustard sauce from the aussie chicken recipe on this site. That honey-mustard sauce made the meal. It was sensational. You can't sauce that good in restaurants. Also used leftover honey ham from Christmas ham and provolone cheese. Hubby said it was the best he's ever had. Five stars easy. The next night I chopped up some leftover chicken and put it on top of a baked potato. It was just as good. Make it, eat it, enjoy it.

I tried this chicken mostly because we hadn't been to the grocery for a while and had all necessary ingredients, and because of the great reviews.  It was good, but too dry and rather bland.  It was missing a "kick".  It's basically a chicken and ham sandwich with no bread.

This recipe was the first I have cooked for my family, and they just would not stop complimenting me on it. Not yet being an experienced cook, I didn't add any gimmicks or tricks of my own, and I found that I didn't need to. A great, easy recipe!

My family loved this one. I did make a couple changes though. After rolling up the chicken I covered it with Honey Mustard Lighthouse dressing (with added regular mustard for more taste)and covered that with smashed Ritz crackers, instead of bread crumbs. Also saved some mustard sauce for dipping....AWSOME! Thanks for the great recipe Kiersten!

I seem to be in the minority here, but I found this to be not worth the effort.  It was very dry and the cheese and ham could not even be tasted.  The bread crumbs did not seem to serve any purpose either.  Did I do something wrong?

Excellent.  Easy to prepare.  I used bamboo skewers to hold the chicken together while in the oven rather than toothpicks.  I did the rolling in butter/breadcrumbs and made the soup/sour cream etc. sauce... the sauce really made the dish.  Company-worthy. A definite keeper.

I did not read all of the reviews, but enough of them to get a few helpful hints. I pounded the chicken, placed the ham and swiss cheese on each breast, then rolled them up.  I carefully rolled each breast in melted butter, then in the seasoned bread crumbs.  I then went on to secure with tooth picks and followed the recipe with delicious results.  My husband raved about the meal.  This will definately be a regular at our home!

This was amazing!  Everyone from my husband down to my 3 and 1 year old daughters loved this!  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and dipped the chicken in eggwash and breadcrumbs before rolling the cheese and ham in it.  I used provolone instead of swiss.  And I topped each roll with a pat of real butter.
I also made Honey Mustard Dressing II to go with it -- which went really well.

This is a DEFINITE keeper.  Easy enough to make any night and fancy enough to serve for guests!  :-)

Really, really good.  Some kind of a sauce (for flavor) might be nice to drizzle over the chicken because this recipe by nature is kind of bland.  It really was wonderful and everyone - my husband and four kids (ages 14 down to 1) enjoyed it.  THANKS!

My husband and I both enjoyed this meal.  I took others' tips and dipped chicken in egg yolk and rolled in bread crumbs, also added pat of butter.  Next, time would like to enhance the breading.  Overall, excellent meal and very easy to make.

I also added the pat of butter (just a little).  It is important to pound the chicken well so it cooks evenly.  We enjoyed this meal.

This is a delicious and easy Cordon Bleu.
My oven cooked it in a little less time,
maybe 25 minutes. I also would recommend
adding a pat of butter on top. Enjoy!

I have served this twice, and both times it was a hit!  I have requests to make it!  
It was a lot easier to prepare than I had first expected.  I made a bit of a mess while 
doing it, but it was well worth it!

Exceeded my expectations,  better than restaurant quality, incredibly delicious! Listened to reviews, and dredged in flour, then egg wash then bread crumbs. Used a honey hickory smoked ham(not lunchmeat) sliced 1/4 inch thick. Was careful to pound chicken  to 1/4 inch and it rolled up nicely, just had to secure with a toothpick. The egg wash helps to seal everything. Cooked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, then topped with 1/2 slice Swiss cheese and baked addt'l 5 mins. When serving, Topped with sauce(creme of chicken/mushroom soup, 4 oz. sour creme, tbsp. Lemon juice and tbsp. Fresh chopped parsley heated thru). served with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.

I have found rolling and sticking with a toothpick laborsome and unnecessary.
I spray the bottom of a pan, and then start layering.  First breasts on bottom,  then deli sliced ham, deli sliced imported Swiss,  and then another layer of ham and cheese.  A layer of breasts and then top with corn flake crumbs and bake.  So much easier!

My husband requested chicken cordon bleu for dinner so I googled it! Made it as written but added some panko to the bread crumbs and dipped in egg first. Used provolone because that is what i had on hand.Put a pat  of butter on each one and baked at 400 for 25 min. Put the 1/2 slice of cheese on top and baked 5 min more. Someone mentioned a sauce-cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 T lemon juice; I heated up soup and about 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder and paprika, once it came to a boil stirred in the sour cream and let heat. (wasn't too sure about how this sauce would taste)I served the chicken over rice- My husband toasted me! Thank you Kiersten!

Use the Chicken Kiev recipe technique of chilling it in the freezer after stuffing it, and again after breading it (using Panko instead). This way there are no skewers involved; much better result.

I followed other reviewer's suggestions as well.  I filleted the chicken breast and then pounded it, dipped it in egg and bread crumbs (both sides) and rolled it with the ham and provolone cheese, topped with butter slices. I made the gravy from cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 T lemon juice (which was necessary, definitely, to lighten it up a little.)  I baked it at 400 degrees and added 1/2 slice of cheese to the top for the last 5 minutes.  I ended up baking for 40+ minutes at 400 degrees to get the temp up to 160.  Served it with broccoli.  Was moist and delish!  
Suggestions for next time:  I'll fillet them completely in half, then pound them.  The full breasts were too big, hubby and I split one.  I will add more ham and cheese, maybe 2 slices of each, or 2 of ham and 1 1/2 of cheese.

I love love love making this!!! It's always so juicy and yummy! I've mixed the meets that go on the inside and I know ham is what makes it Cordon Bleu but I don't care for ham so I tried it with bacon and it was good but I liked it better when I put deli roast beef.

I made this last night after reading the great reviews. My husband loved it and I can't wait to make it again! Excellent basic recipe but I heeded the advice of several reviewers by dipping the rolled chicken/ham/cheese in egg before rolling in the breadcrumbs. I also added a dab of butter atop each chicken roll (about 1/4 tsp.) on each to help add a bit of flavor and a more golden color. It was very tasty with just the few ingredients it has and was extremely easy. Just started to preheat the oven and began prepping the chicken at the same time and it was ready to put in by the time the oven was heated up. Winner winner, chicken dinner! :-)

I bought thinly sliced chicken breast from supermarket to save time.  The slices were big so I cut them in half.  After rolling with ham and cheese, it was a pretty good size.  I put in oven 400 degrees for 25 minutes and it was done perfectly.  I made this again a week later.  This time I did not cut the chicken breast slices in half cause I didn't have time.  The rolls, of course, were bigger.  I put in oven 400 degrees for 25 minutes and they were not done.  So I cooked for another 5-7 minutes til it was done.  I made the cream of mushroom sauce with sour cream and lemon juice as suggested.  It was good and easy.  This is such a versatile recipe.  You can use Marsala Wine sauce, add spinach to the rolls, possibilities are endless.  Also very kid friendly and so easy!

I like to experiment with different recipes and add my own twist.   I added prosciutto and ham and fresh figs with walnuts.  I use whatever cheese I have (this time was cheddar with horseradish. I also had some basil mint pesto

We followed the recipe exactly, and these turned out really... bleh. Just not appealing to our tastes. The chicken had no flavor. We made mashed potatoes and gravy on the side, thankfully, because it helped me eat it when it was freshly cooked. There was simply no taste to this recipe, even with the cheese and ham, and nothing appealing about it. We won't be making this one again.

The whole family enjoyed it and there were no leftovers. I used muenster cheese which is what I had on hand. Also, I put the pads of butter on top of the breasts and it either really well. Keeping this on the menu for sure.

I used provolone cheese instead of Swiss. Rolled each one in melted butter instead of egg wash. Subbed crushed corn flakes for bread crumbs. Really really good.

Everything came out pretty dry and the cheese wasn't very melted like I'm used to.

I made this almost exactly according to the recipe (the only difference being that I breaded both sides of the chicken, a very minor change), and it came out very well.

I think the key to moist chicken is to not use too large of a baking dish. Everything was put together very tightly, and this contained the juices which boiled throughout the baking.

My wife loved it - will definitely be making this again.

This was really good.  I cut some bnls chicken breasts in half and then pounded them out even thinner.  I did dip them in some raw scrambled egg and then layed them on the seasoned panko crumbs (I seasoned myself) that were spread out on a plate. Then from there added the cheese and ham and rolled up. I made a honey mustard sauce (3/4 c mayo, 1/4 c honey and a little under 1/4 c dijon) to dip them in.  Next time I will not add as much seasoning as I did cuz they were a bit over seasoned..  but that was my fault, not the recipe!  I also put them in a 13x9 cake pan sprayed with olive oil spray and then sprayed the top of them.  35 mins and then 3 mins with the cheese was enuf for mine! Thanks for the recipe!

I give it 3 stars because in order to get the best taste, you should brown them in butter before putting them in the oven.  Also, I used baby Swiss cheese which tastes so much better and maple, brown sugar ham!  Turned out delicious!

This is a good start but I was after a great dish, so I decided I would make a few changes.  Change #1, i substituted ham with prosciutto.  Change #2, after rolling up the chicken I then place in an egg wash followed by flour, followed by egg wash and then into bread crumbs I had seasoned with my own cajun spices (I know not traditional, but added great flavor).  Change #3, instead of topping with a slice of swiss I baked it without the additional swiss and made a swiss cheese sauce using the extra swiss, a bit of butter, milk and corn starch.  It turned out delicious and my family really loved it.  Thank you for a great base recipe. :)

I've made this quite a few times and its always a hit! This time I did a variation. I used chicken tenderloin strips.I sliced the ham and swiss in strips also-secure with a toothpick. I made a casserole dish full of them.I pounded them out,easy peasy. I spread mayo thinly before bread crumb mixture.I put butter in the bottom of dish also. I mixed parmesean, bread crumb,onion powder,garlic powder,pepper, no salt.I could tell this is also gonna be a winner and I may like it better this way from now on.Alot less pounding for sure! Also next time I may try it with thick bacon! When I pounded lightly the chicken I put 4 at a time in a large baggie.

So simple, and the taste from a master chef. The sauce is a must!! I've tried the creamy chicken soup combo on one occasion, but I prefer the mushroom soup/ 1/2 cup of sour cream and tbsp. of lemon juice combo far better. Serving this over a bed of rice and a fresh vegetable , makes for a wonderful dinner. Thank You for Sharing.

Excellent!  After pounding the chicken, I dipped in egg wash and then in seasoned breadcrumbs. I placed a slice of ham (deli/Virginia baked) and slice of Swiss on top, rolled up then sprinkled with a touch of more crumbs.  Baked at 400 for 25 minutes per other recommendations.  Succulent and juicy!  Served with steamed broccoli sprinkled with lemon pepper seasoning, baked potato and crescent rolls.  Yum!   I also served the sauce that others mentioned:  (1) can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream and (1) tbsp lemon juice. Mix, micro for 2 1/2 minutes on high OR heat in a saucepan. Pour over chicken before serving. Delicious and will definitely make over and over again.  Enjoy and thanks, Kiersten!

Instead of pounding the chicken and rolling it, I slid a pocket in the chicken breast and put one slice of ham and one slice of cheese in it.  Then I rolled it in beaten egg and coated it with bread crumbs all over. It was very yummy, no dry at all. I also followed the advice with the cream of chicken soup and sour cream.  Was a very delicious addition to the chicken.

I loved it! Would definitely make it again but make my chicken a little thinner so it's easier to roll the chicken.My boyfriend suggested provolone cheese next time (he's not a fan of Swiss but still enjoyed it) So I think it's really your preference of what type of cheese you like.

"A way to a mans heart is through his stomach",,,,then this is THE recipe! Unbelievably delicious, especially for the simplicity of it. My boyfriend has always enjoyed my cooking, however when I made this he ranted and raved with each bite. I mean literally,,,,he was in heaven! He made sounds Ive never heard before. I dipped the chicken in egg wash first then coated it with Panko Bread Crumbs before assembling. I was out of Swiss so I used Provolone which makes a nice substitution:) This recipe made the front page of my recipe collection and I can't wait to make it again:)

I liked this recipe but it would have been a little too bland for my household. My husband likes things hearty and not too dry. I used this recipe as more of a reference guide on how to make Chicken Cordon Bleu. I am not much of a numbers girl so I will keep this short. First I pounded each piece and placed it in egg, then in unseasoned breadcrumbs which I mixed with paprika, salt, and pepper, then laid it out flat and put a slice of ham and swiss cheese. Rolled it up with the toothpick as directed. I then cooked them in the oven on 375 for about 30 minutes and then put a 1/4 size piece of swiss on each and placed back in the oven for about 4 minutes. Served with steamed broccoli and SUCCESS! My husband loved them because it was hearty and juicy. I tend to use all of these recipes as more of guides then absolutes soooo thanks for posting this recipe!

Turned out Fantastic .... My only change was to take a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and poured it over as the cheese on top was melting and served Asparagus with it 
It is exceptionally fast and easy and definitely will do again.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly...I didn't change a thing except I only made two servings.  This recipe is delicious as is, no need for an egg wash, a sauce or any of the other changes that many have suggested.

I made this recipe (or a wide variation of it) tonight, and all things considered it turned out alright. 
I decided to make the dish according to several previous comments suggestions, using an egg to batter and bread the chicken as well as a ceram of mushroom sauce. So I gathered my things and went to the grocery store. 
After a woeful shopping trip, I realized after in my haste to make it home before jeopardy, I forgot cream of mushroom soup as well as the pre-cooked ham. 
This is when it turned into chicken-cordon-what-ever-was-in-my-fridge. I pounded the chicken and then folded a variety of things into it, most with swiss cheese, some with lunch ham, one with turkey, one with turkey and grilled pepper, one with grilled pepper, spinach and turkey, and another with mushroom and spinach. Then I dunked in a mixture of 2 eggs and a smash of milk to keep it thin. Baked for roughly 35 minutes at 360. 
For sauce I made a fairly thick pesto sauce, light on the pesto and added garlic as well as fresh chopped basil from the garden to make it flavorful, but not overpowering. 
As it turns out, you can stuff almost anything in cordon-bleus and it will turn out successful!
Best thing to be is flexible.

This is my favorite cordon bleu recipe! It's so easy to make and is a hit with my boyfriend and his roomate! I've made it with swiss cheese and mozzarella cheese as my boyfriend isn't a huge fan of swiss, and both times it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very yummy and the family loved it. As mentioned in an earlier review, I made the honey mustard sauce from the Aussie Chicken recipe. I only rank this a four because the sauce stole the show and made this dish even better!

Good but the seasoning is a little light in the bread crumbs.... so I seasoned to suite. Dredged each breast in egg/milk then wrapped and breaded in 2 quart zip lock containing crumbs and basted lightly with margarine to crisp outside. Looked and tasted very good.............

This wasn't the best chicken cordon bleu I've made, but definitely the quickest and easiest.  I will likely make again with a few modifications to make it more to my liking.

Printed the recipe and handed it my 15 year old. After he pounded the chicken out he added the ham and provolone instead of swiss. Then dredged it in egg and used half italian bread crumbs and half panko. It was delicious!

I used flour and an eggwash to coat one entire side of each breast before covering in the seasoned bread crumbs.  I tried this with the recommended sauce from the most helpful review (cream of chicken soup, sour cream and lemon juice) and didn't care for it.  It was too sour and not a nice compliment to the chicken.  I've had it before with a mustard sauce so I think I'll try that again next time.

1-2-12: Ann said this was good, but, really, it was dry and bland.  Try the modified recipe, Chicken Cordon Bleu II.

I made this today and it was delicious.  I have never made chicken Cordon Bleu before because I though it was soo difficult, this was easy and yummy.  Thanks for helping me make a wonderful dinner for my family.

Next time I make this I have a few adjustments:
(1) I used Sargento baby swiss cheese, should have added 2 slices to inside each chicken breast
(2) Bake @ 375 for 40 mins
(3) Needs a sauce, otherwise a bit plain, like a honey mustard or even Chick Fil A sauce would work.

This really is amazing!  Like most recipes you may want to tweak it to your taste.  I took the advice of others and rolled the entire piece of chicken in bread crumbs.  I also added just a small pat of butter on top of each roll before cooking.  These ended up taking closer to an hour to cook, but worth the extra time.  I recommend making a sauce to go with it.  Use 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 cup sour cream and 1tbsp lemon juice.  A honey mustard sauce would also taste great with these!

This was good. I made a few changes though so I gave it a 4. I followed other reviewers' advice and brushed the chicken with an egg wash (beaten egg and water) then added the bread crumbs. I used panko. I also added cream of chicken soup, about .5 cup sour cream, and lemon juice. It turned out well.

I tried this because I had all the ingrediants on hand. It turned out very YUMMY! I liked that it wasn't completely breaded. I always feel like the bottom gets soggy, and texture is big for me, so this was great! The top was breaded and crispy just the way chicken cordon blue should be in my opinion. Next time I might try it with provavlone as other suggested cause my kids aren't big fans of swiss! Thanks for sharing...this is a keeper!!!!

Amazing! I followed the other reviews and after rolling the chicken, I rolled the chicken in seasoned flour, then dipped it in egg and then in corn flake crumbs. I also added Paprika to the flour and Corn Flakes. I made the sauce that every one else recommended. (one can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, and some lemon Juice) and served it on with rice.  A new favorite in our house.

This recipe was excellent!! Despite what another review said, I used cold cut ham and I also used shredded mozzarella cheese. When I tell you my children LOVED this recipe, that is an understatement!! My daughter kept asking for more! Nevertheless, there were not any leftovers! A very easy, quick recipe to make.

This rocked!   The only alteration I made was added salt to the breadcrumbs.  I will add parmesan nexrt time.  This was easy and delish!   I made this last week and my husband is already begging for me to make this again.  I paired it with Stouffer's potato baked and it was perfect!  Highly recommend!

Delicious. Served on a pool of white wine cream sauce with wild rice and mushrooms and steamed broccoli and peppers.
Only changes I made was to roll in homemade Italian bread crumbs (egg wash not necessary) and sprinkle with freshly grated romano before serving.

My family loved this.  We usually buy the packaged ones.  I decided to have a go at it and it turned out wonderful.  I used shredded Swiss instead of the slices and I had some Black Forest deli ham on hand and used as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. It paired up perfectly with pan-fried asparagus and rolls.

I only had plain breadcrumbs so I added a mixture of oregano, basil, and garlic powder. I followed others' recommendations on here and used an egg wash before dipping the chicken in the crumb mixture. I also made a sauce using the 'Aussie Chicken' recipe on here as another user suggested. It was wonderful!

I didn't have ham or swiss cheese so I used deli hickory turkey slices and pepper jack cheese. Also I coated the chicken in breadcrumbs instead of just sprinkling them on top. 
Everyone loved it!

My husband loves Chicken Cordon Bleu and I normally can't stand it but I made it for him for Valentine's Day. I used this recipe as a starting point.
 I only used 2 breasts, butterfly'd them in 1/2(leaves me 4 pieces) Marinate for a couple hrs in Italian salad dressing. Place swiss or provolone on chicken and deli ham on  open piece of chicken. Fold in 1/2 (hamburger style) and place a toothpick through. Put in oven at 350 for 45 min in casserole dish, take out, put an extra piece of cheese on top, put back in till the cheese melts. Enjoy! Ours was so juicy and flavorful.

Absolutely delicious. :D My husband said it's the best chicken dish I've EVER made. High praise! I did use the biggest chicken breasts I could find. I butterflied them and then pounded them out to 1/4". I did the egg wash like another reviewer suggested, and for bread crumbs, I toasted some bread and added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a dash of cayenne then threw it in the food processor. Perfect bread crumbs. I didn't use toothpicks, just put the open end underneath the wrapped piece. I also baked it in a small cast-iron skillet at 350º for 30 minutes - perfection! Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was excellent.  I opted to dredge the pounded chicken through butter and bread crumbs prior to rolling them up as well and also baked it at 400 for 20 minutes.  PERFECT!!

Very tasty.  I also made the sauce as another review posted.  It was a little hard to roll up, but the toothpicks held it together.

This recipe did not impress me the way I had hoped it would, since it was so highly rated.  It seemed to have about twice as many bread crumbs as it needed.  Without any type of sauce, it did not seem to be as flavorful as I had hoped.  Mine needed to cook longer than directed, larger pieces of chicken.

This was delicious! My husband and I loved it. I follow the suggestions of other raters and dipped the breast first to cover one side in egg and then placed it on top of the breadcrumb mixture (crumbs and paprika). I made the honey mustard sauce that one reviewer suggested but forgot to add the honey! It was good anyway! I spread a little of the mustard sauce on the chicken breast and then put the ham and cheese on top. After rolling and securing I added a little butter on top and baked at 400for 25 mins. as suggested. I put a small slice of cheese on for another 3 minutes and then served with the sauce on the side for dipping. Yum!

Good and easy! I didn't have swiss cheese on hand.. so I cheated and just sprinkled in shredded mozz, worked out good. On the outside of the flatened chicken, before seasoning, I rubbed on some EV olive oil.. then put on the s&p and also garlic powder.

Awesome recipe all I do different is pour a can of cream of chicken, or cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup over it prior to baking. Then use that as a gravy and serve all over brown rice

I've been making this recipe for several years and is always a favorite; great when you have guests.  Only change I make is to roll the breast in Stove Top stuffing  mixed with a little butter; use either chicken or wild rice stuffing when I can find it.  I also buy a small boneless ham or turkey ham and use thicker slices then luncheon meat.  Sometimes if it's not rolling right for me I just lay the chicken breast  flat, put the ham and cheese on, cover with cream of mushroom soup and always have some extra stuffing to sprinkle on the top.

This was so delicious and super easy for a quick weeknight meal. Kids and adults loved it. The only thing i did different was to roll the chicken in egg wash after i rolled it and then in breadcrumbs with a dash of paprika. I wanted to make a sauce with it but didnt have the right ingredients, so i just spooned some jarred alfredo sauce over the breats the last 10  minutes of cooking. Will make often.

My family loved it, even though I used fat free ingridients where possible.  I also used the sauce someone suggested using 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/4 cup sour cream and 1 tbs lemon juice. place the sauce on the plate and place the chicken on top, served it with white rice and salad. Wow wonderful!! Thanks!!

My wife and I made this fantastic dish two weeks in a row.  We tried this excellent recommendation from MOONBEAGLE and it made the dish even better:  Final suggestion: add the honey-mustard sauce from this site's Aussie Chicken recipe (inside the roll and/or as a dipping sauce). It really complements this dish!

Delicious!   My family devoured them.   I stayed true to the recipe, I just added a pat of butter on top of the rolled chicken before baking.  By putting the bread crumbs on top made it very light. Will make again.

I was pretty surprised with my results. This was a very easy recipe to follow & I loved the taste! Used HICKORY-SMOKED PEPPER & HICKORY-SMOKED SALT to sprinkle on the chicken. At 355 degrees for 20 minutes. Thanks for posting!

I wasn't 100% sure how this would be, but for someone who's married to the world's finickiest eater (only meat & cheese, really), I had to try it. He devoured it, then said it was "pretty good." Which, coming from him, means it was a hit! He loves when I make this. I would like it a little better if it had more taste to it, it was a teeny bit bland for me. But since the hubby loves it, it's made at LEAST every 10 days. We love it!

Cooked this for my husband and myself with a creamy dijon sauce.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I noticed that some reviews commented on it being a little dry, but I tried to counteract that by buying really big chicken breasts, and instead of pounding and rolling, I just cut slits and stuck the ham and cheese in there.  It worked perfectly.

I like to dip the chicken breasts in an egg wash and then coat both sides with seasoned bread crumbs (bread crumbs, salt, pepper, paprika). I also like to add some honey mustard (French's yellow mustard and honey) to the top of the ham prior to rolling it up. Cook for ~25 minutes at 400 degrees at high altitude with a small amount (

This recipe was really fantastic.  I also used the advice of others and rolled the chicken in egg before breading and used the delicious sauce.  It was a hit.  I made it with home made mashed potatoes for my boy friend's parents. I have never cooked for them before and they were very impressed!  I will definitly make it again. I gave it 4 stars since i had to slightly alter the recipe.

Really, really good.  Super easy.  I did it with Boar's Head ham and with Provolone with a little Swiss.  I thought the Provolone would take a little of the edge off of the Swiss, and it did work.  I also, for some reason, didn't have any tootpicks.  As long as you put the "rolls" on the edge of the dish and don't allow the rolls' weight to make them unravel, you'll be fine without the toothpicks.

This was the first recipe from this site I was disappointed in. It was just really bland! I am trying to think about how to make it more flavorful... maybe the cheese sauce recommended by others would be a good place to start. Probably won't make again.

Yum!  I just got done making and eating this for dinner and we loved it!!  I forgot to add the cheese to the top but we didn't even miss it.  I used plain bread crumbs because that was what I had and I added some italian seasoning to them.  Excellent tasting recipe and simple to make!

Amazing. Modified this like a previous user by breading the chicken before rolling it in the ham and swiss. Everyone loved it. I'll be using this one again.

Absolutely exceptional. With a few personal tweaks, such as coating the chicken in a ground seasoned croutons and egg wash mixture, my family has not stopped raving about this dish!

Excellent recipe. I took the advice of others and dipped in beaten egg before rolling the whole chickent breat in bread crumbs. Also let it sit for about 1/2 hour to get the bread crumbs to stick well. Served it with the Yummy Honey Mustard from this site. Definitely will make again.

Wonderful recipe!  I made my as described, but for sauce I made the 'Yummy Honey Mustard Sauce' from this site as well.  I served it on the side for dipping, but I think it would have been just as good on the inside of the roll!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time It was a little dry because I left it in too long.  The second time it was absolutely wonderful and it is so simple.  The things I did different the second time is used the butter like others suggested and didn't cook it too long.  I also used Italian bread crumbs because thats what I had.  That didn't make much difference.  Family raved.  Thank You!

This was excellent! My family loves all my cooking but even as the cook I absolutely loved it, as did every eating. I followed all the reviewers tips by slicing my thick breasts with a super sharp knife through the thickest part and made a pocket filled with regular sandwhich ham and mozzarella cheese, didnt need to use toothpicks, just held it together as i dipped in one egg whisked with a little bit of milk, then patted with generic italian breadcrumbs and placed in a baking dish sprayed with pam w/olive oil, then 2squares of margarine on top of each breast and baked at 400 for 25 mins and they were perfectly cooked throughout, juicy, and the breading was crispy! I also served the suggested sauce on the side (1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 can of cream of chicken, & the 1 T of lemon juice) also with leftover green bean casserole and mac& cheese with garlic bread! GREAT RECIPE & SUPER EASY!

Absolutely fabulous! I took the advice of others and dipped the chicken in egg first, then rolled it around in the bread crumbs to coat it completely(added paprika, garlic and some other seasonings, too, because I only had plain bread crumbs on hand). My mallet's head broke off, so I pounded down the chicken breasts with a coffee mug and folded them in half around a thick piece of swiss and 3 pieces of ham (didn't have any toothpicks, but they stayed together quite nicely). Added another piece of cheese at the last 2 minutes of cooking and...perfection! We topped it with BBQ sauce and had cheesy-garlic mashed on the side. Best meal we've had all week!

Absolutely delicious! We made the cream of chicken soup -sour cream-lemon juice sauce and saved the leftovers for rice tonight. I used the egg wash before breading and added a bit of butter to the top as others suggested. I cooked it at 400 for 25 minutes. It is pretty hard to go wrong with this recipe. I would say you can use any kind of ham or cheese you want. Plus you can add some heat or other spices to the chicken. Thank you Kiersten

This was delicious. I don't think I've ever made Cordon Bleu before and glad I tried it!  I made with seasoned bread crumbs and my chicken breasts were so stuffed toothpicks couldn't hold them together!  baked after browning in hot skillet to finish cooking and made the sauce that another recipe had with crm of chicken soup & sour cream in it and it was wonderful with the chicken..loved it for lunch the next day!  will make this again for sure!

Delicious! Easy and enjoyable. I don't think it needs the added sauce that some reviewers have mentioned. Its already good and doesn't need the extra calories. My hubby says thanks for the recipe :).

This was very good! I didn't bother rolling mine up, just placed my thawed chicken breasts in a 9x13 glass baking dish, topped with slices of ham, then of Swiss, then a sprinkling of bread crumbs, then the pat of butter everyone talks about. The result is that the butter melts and keeps your chicken from drying out from the bottom up. It does make a rather revolting looking juice in the bottom of the pan but that can be drained away before anyone notices! I'm sure it's excellent rolled up, I just couldn't find my meat mallet so didn't bother. I did reduce my cooking time to 340 and baked for 40 minutes straight through. We didn't need a side sauce--it was plenty juicy as it was (from the butter)! Thanks for a quick, easy, tasty recipe!

This was so easy and delish! I think it's all about the kind of cheese and ham you use. I used an imported danish ham, not too salty, and provalone. I also dipped the rolled chicken in butter, then breadcrumbs. the breading seemed a little wet, maybe if I sprayed with butter to get a crispier result. I would also use unsalted butter next time too.

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious! I took 2 large chicken breasts, cut them in half lengthwise and pounded out each half to make 4 thin, good-sized pieces. I beat 1 egg in a dish, dipped the chicken in the egg, placed the dipped chicken on a plate of bread crumbs, added the ham & swiss, rolled, inserted a toothpick and placed in baking pan. I also placed a pat of butter on the top of each breast. Done in 30 mins and used the honey mustard sauce from "Aussi Chicken". My husband decided this should become one of our staples. I like the previous reviewer's addition of white wine to the bottom of the pan. I'll try that next time. I also served with roasted asparagus w/thyme which I found on this site.

Awesome!  My husband and I loved these breasts.  I used about and egg and a half to moisten the chicken before dipping it into the breadcrumb mixture.  I didn't use a sauce-I felt that it didn't need one.  I shredded extra swiss cheese and placed it on top of the chicken, and the last ten minutes of baking, I added a tsp. of butter to each breast.  I also used 2 pieces of smoked ham per breast instead of one. The end result was fabulous.

Delicious! I had a request from my boyfriend to try making Chicken Cordon Bleu, so I thought I'd attempt it. I couldn't believe how easy it was, or how great it turned out.  I had some difficulty "stuffing" the chicken, I ended up sort of folding/wrapping it around the ham and cheese. It still tasted excellent!

This recipe was a great base recipe. The only things that I changed were to sprinkle the chicken with Tony's and then dip in egg before filling and rolling. I also used Italian bread crumbs for more flavor. This tastes great with mozzarella cheese as well.

This was great - I dipped the chicken in egg and then added finely chopped pecans to my breadcrumbs and coated one side of the chicken, rolled it with provolone cheese and ham, put in the pan, sprinkled with leftover crumbs, and added the pat of butter on top everyone recommended.  I cooked it at 400 for 20 min. and then 5 min more with the cheese.  Came out yummy.

This was okay....I am sure it was my fault but I found it to be a bit bland.  I didnt follow directions to a t....I rolled the cheese with the ham..mistake! I did add wine and mushrooms to the sauce which was pretty good.  I wonder if seasoning the chicken more would have helped.  I also used deli style smoked ham...  Hmmm....

I found thie dish very yummy but a bit dry for me.  I will use others suggestions next time and roll the chicken in egg and add the celery soup/sour cream topping.

Overall a wonderful tasty dish.

My husband and inlaws loved this!  I forgot to sprinkle it with the salt and pepper (it didn't need it anyway).  I did use store bought ham for sandwhiches and I dipped it in egg and then the breadcrumbs and added the pat of butter on top.  I also forgot to make the sauce, but it was so juicy and flavorful it didn't need it.  I will definately make this again.  It was easy to make and quick to cook.

This was good. I rolled it in melted butter before rolling in bread crumbs. Also added some parmesan cheese to bread crumbs.

Wonderful and rich. I thought this was a pretty easy recipe to follow. I t can get a little messy when you pound-out the chicken breasts, but the end product is really beautiful and delicious!

This was so yummy! And like a lot of you... my boyfriend absolutely loved the dish! Additionally, I used an egg wash to dip my chicken in before coating it in bread crumbs. And instead of swiss cheese (didn't have it on hand) I used pre-shredded white cheese (mixture of 4 white cheeses in a bag). For a side dish I made a scalloped potato recipe I also found on the site... Easy to make but sooo delicious!!!

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out o.k. My husband liked it, but I thought it was missing something. I probably won't be making this again.

So good!! It would be even better with a cream sauce to go on top. The only change I made was to roll the chicken in the bread crumbs and sprinkle them on top! Very easy to make!

This recipe was great.  I put breadcrumbs in the bottom of pan with garlic powder, dehydrated onion flakes and paprika.  Then I placed my chicken rolls on top.  I then sprinkled more breadcrumbs, garlic powder, onion flakes and paprika on top.  I also used the honey mustard sauce from Aussie Chicken.  I put the swiss cheese on when all done and then drizzled the honey mustard sauce on top.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT.  I served it to a bunch of guys and kids and they all loved it.

What an awesome, easy to make, and delicious recipe. I used deli sliced smoked ham, but would have added more cheese since so much leaked out after cutting into it checking to see if it was done. Perfectly cooked after about 40 minutes. I also used other suggestions to brush on egg white; it really helped keep the bread crumbs on. Thanks for a great recipe!

Between simplicity and taste this recipe is fantastic!  I have made it several times and I have not changed one thing. "Basic Mashed Potatoes" recipe from this site compliments it so well.

When I opened my swiss cheese - it was moldy - so I had to sub provolone.  Turned out awesome.  I also drizzled melted butter overtop the rolls before baking.

These were way too hard to roll, so I simply pounded them thin, rolled up a slice of monterey jack cheese in a slice of ham and folded the chicken in half over the ham-wrapped cheese. Then, someone suggested I wrap bacon around each piece of chicken so I did that too. I baked them, because I was scared I wouldn't cook them enough in the pan. I was surprised about the amount of grease in the pan (probably from the bacon) but once I served them for Christmas Dinner my family gave them a rave review. I'll make them the same way again next time, but I'll put a cookie cooling sheet into my pan before I bake it, that way I'm sure the chicken doesn't just sit in the grease.

I thought this was great! I also think that substituting crushed crutons for the bread crumbs is great. It made it so much easier since they were already seasoned!

OMG, this was fabulous. My boyfriend LOVED it and so did I! I used Provolone instead of Swiss. I also melted butter and put it on both sides before putting the salt/pepper & ham/cheese down. Yes, it was more fattening but sooooo delicious. Will definitely make this again!!!!!

I found this recipe really easy! I went to the butcher and had him thinly slice some chicken breast for me, which made it really easy to roll. I took others' advice and dipped in egg before putting the bread crumbs on. Came out great!

My husband and son loved it! I used Monterey Jack cheese and sliced deli ham (it's all I had) instead. I took the advice and cooked it @ 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. Also used 2 cans of cream of chicken whisked with some water and added 3/4 to the pan before I put the chicken in, poured the rest over the top, sprinkled with bread crumbs, then covered with aluminum foil it was very juicy and delicious! Definently a once a week dinner!

I enjoyed this. I took the advice of other reviewers and dipped it in egg and breadcrumb and used a little butter on top. It wasn't super moist, so next time I may not cook it for as long.

Wow! My husband said this dish made me look like a pro! I have to admit, I was pretty proud of it. The taste and the appearance was top notch. I used a maple honey flavored ham sliced from the meat department at my grocers. This is a quick, easy, tasty dish!

I used both provolone and swiss cheese in the middle, and on top... plus i served it on egg noodles with alfredo (bertolli garlic alfredo is the best) and it cuts down time making a cream sauce!

Very easy and very good!  I took another's advice and rather than pound and roll my chicken (I'm lazy) I just cut a slit in the side and stuffed in the ham and cheese.  And guess what?  It turned out WONDERFUL!  A great basic recipe!!!!

This was so good! The only change I made was to use mozzarella instead of swiss cheese. I think next time I may cut the chicken breasts in half to make them thinner before pounding, hopefully to help make them easier to roll. My boyfriend also requested that I add some bacon next time which I thought might be interesting! He's not a big chicken fan and he inhaled it. Very good and very easy!

Well, I thought it was delish. My hubby said it was WAY too salty. 
I was easy to make except for the WRAPPING part, and toothpicks. I had to put a ton of toothpicks in it to make the chicken wrap around the ham/cheese,  at least 8 per wrapped chicken.
I beat the poor breasts to death and still they weren't big enough, Next time I'll get some that are already PRE-CUT AND PRE-Stretched out or something because most of the cheese on the insides melted out before I got to serve the little darlings....
My fault, not the person who submitted the recipe. Thanks again, I'll surly try this one again but with bigger breasts.

parents loved it but it wasn't for me.  I used olive oil to keep the bread crumbs on and tied the rolls up with floss because i didn't have toothpicks.  I also ran out of cheese so I sprinkled paprika, salt, pepper on the other two. Next time i'll make it with a sauce because it was a little dry. Maybe put cream of mushroom half way through baking?

Everyone else is right- it's quick and delicious! Rather than using chicken breast halves, I used whole breasts and added more ham and Swiss before rolling. More bang for your buck, especially when entertaining.

This is one the most memorable recipes I have ever done...but not for the right reasons  I made this for my wife on Valentine's day.  As I was preparing the dish, we found out that the basement had flooded so we had to eat in a rush and try to fix the leak in the basement.  But I made this recipe again afterwards and it is very tasty.  I have been looking for a Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe that was easy to do and this one fits the part!

I found this recipe to be very easy and very yummy.  I love Chicken Cordon Bleu but haven't made it much because I felt it was so hard, but this was great.  The only changes I made were I rolled the chicken in the butter and also covered the dish with foil for the first half.  Great dish.  Thanks.

This was very good and fairly easy to make.  I agree though with a previous reviewer that it could use more cheese inside.  Mine turned out kinda dry.  I didn't have the breadcrumbs, so I used Shake N Bake to sprinkle on top, and it tasted great!

A very nice looking recipe. I got the pre packeged thin chix breasts.  (You know the kind that are already pounded thin) and it saved so much time. They were a big hit and very easy to make. Good enough for guests.

Thank you for this recipe. The suggestions to flatten the chicken in a Ziploc bag worked well. Only two of the six chicken breasts had ham, things disappear in my refrigerator, they were excellant. I used dried tomato, Sonoma brand with olive oil and garlic, about a TBS per breast spread on a slice of Havarti cheese for the ham free ones.  Either way they were a huge success. I did use string to tie them together which worked well but my family complained that it was hard to remove the string...

Really good! I used cooking string to tie it up, I can't see how toothpicks will hold it. It's a pain to cut the string after though. I used procuitto, ham, and monterary jack cheese.

I used seasoned breadcrumbs and provolone cheese, it was pretty good.  Invest in a meat mallot, I didn't have one and ripped the chicken a bit.  Overall it turned out good.

This was ok.  I should have made a few changes, as I will next time.  Provolone instead of swiss a different coating. Didn't care for the bread crumbs.  They family somewhat enjoyed it.

It's a keeper.  I dipped in egg and rolled in breadcrumbs and browned it in a skillet briefly before baking.

Amazing!  I followed other's suggestions to use mayo under bread crumbs and the overall taste of this dish was incredible.  Simple, easy and I impressed myself. ;-)  My husband loved it and rated it a 9 out of 10.  Thanks for a recipe that will play a major role in our dinners to come!

Very easy...my husband loved it!  I accidently bought chicken tenders thinking that it was a package of chicken breasts.  I debated going back to the store but decided against that!  Instead laid down 1/2 of the package of tenders side by side on the bottom of a casserole, topped them with the other ingredients and then put the remaining tenders on top of everything and covered with bread crumbs.  The result was what I like to call a Chicken Cordon Bleu loaf!  The result was the same without the pounding and mess.  I think I will do this every time from now on.

This was ok. I followeed previous readers' advice and dredged the whole chicken breast into the bread crumbs before I rolled it up. Also added some garlic salt and used mozzarella cheese in place of the swiss.  It was definitely edible, but nothing to rave about. Won't be in any hurry to make again soon.

We enjoyed this one. My daughter couldn't believe that I made it -- she thought it was frozen. That is a big compliment coming from her. Added more swiss cheese and ham (Hillshire Farms Brown Sugar Ham) to each bundle. Pounded the chicken breasts thinnly. Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and also sprinkled some garlic powder on top. Right before I took them out of the oven, I poured a few melted tablespoons of butter over each.

This is a very easy and delightful recipe.  I read some of the other reviews and spun off from there.  I used Dutch Country Ham and it gave the chicken a wonderful flavor. After rolling my chicken, I dipped it in an egg wash and then rolled in seasoned bread crumbs and placed in a baking dish sprayed with cooking spray.  I then used a can of cream of chicken soup and added 1/3 cup water to it, mixed and poured over the chicken and I added a few more bread crumbs over the top.  I placed in a 375 degree oven, covered for the first 30 minutes, uncovered and baked for 30-40 mintues longer (as my breasts were quite large), added the chesse to the top, baked for 5 minutes more.  My family and I were very pleased with the taste, they were not bland and they were very moist.  This is a keeper at our house.  Thank you for such an easy and elegant recipe.  :)

We thought this was really good.  I added a touch of butter as people suggested however we did not like that sauce with the sour cream, lemon juice and soup at all.  Next time I will definitely brown the chicken rolls in a touch of olive oil before baking just to give it a bit more flavor.

This was a great recipe, my only complaint is that I used a honey mustard to coat the chicken before stuffing and wrapping it up and it was a bit sweet for my taste. My boyfriend loved it though. I think next time I will use something less sweet like regular mustard or dijon. I also took the advice of others and made the sauce (crm of celery, 1/2 c sour cream, tbsp lemon juice) and that was very good. I used Provolone and honey ham (also could've contributed the sweetness) instead.

This was great. I changed it up a little.  I used the suggestions of others and mixed a can of cream of celery and sour cream.  I spread some of that mixture on the pounded chicken breasts and then but my ham and cheese.  I had a lot of that mixture left and no cheese left so I covered my rolled chicken in the soup mix and then bread crumbs.  It was wonderful.  It made a great sauce for the chicken and rice I served it with.  This is a definate keeper!!!  Thanks so much!!

I made this last night for dinner for my husband and I!  Turned out great!  Instead of pounding the chicken, I just butterfly cut it.  Also I brushed the chicken with egg and coated in bread crumbs.  Will be making again!

Hubby is still talking about how good this was!!  And that was last week!  I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so I mashed some crackers and added some chicken shake and bake.  It gave it a yummy flavor!  I also put a little butter on each piece before baking and it came out very juicy!  Will definately make this again!!

Great, great, great. I used thin chicken cutlets. and used an egg mixture and bread crumbs on one side before adding cheese/ham.  Because of the reviews I read, I made sure to use paper thin cheese/ham and I also used toothpicks not only in the center, but to close up the sides.  Salt was not needed.  I added garlic to the bread crumbs and all I can say is this was GREAT!

This is a great recipe, we all enjoyed it!  I love using frozen, boneless chicken breasts and this recipe is perfect for that.  I don't think that I'll salt the breasts next time, as the ham, or the Canadian bacon that I happened to have on hand, was plenty salty enough. I guess if you didn't use Swiss, it wouldn't be classic Cordon Bleu, but would still be tasty.  Thanks Kiersten!

Fool-proof chicken cordon bleu recipe. Next time, to ease the preparation, I think I will use shredded swiss cheese so that it is easier to roll the chicken breasts (my swiss cheese slices made it difficult to role).

It was very good. I made some with chicken and some with veal. I also made two of the sauces that I saw recipies on and just cooked in the sauce pan and put it over the finished product.
The others said that it was a little dry. I may have cooked it a little bit long. But very good. I would make it again.

When I first served this dish to my mom, she told me she was very impressed and told me she would never have attempted to cook anything this fancy and complicated herself. I was tempted to let her go on thinking that I was a master chef who had slaved in the kitchen all day to make this instead of admitting that it was actually one of the simplest, easiest recipes I've come across.  It's terrific for when you want to impress company with a "fancy" dish, but don't have much cooking expertise or time to spare.

I thought it was pretty good. I added some of my own ideas to perk it up a bit.  Between the swiss cheese and ham I spread on a little bit of honey mustard and a dash of thyme and garlic powder.  Then after I rolled it up I layered some more ham and cheese and then sprinkled some bread crumbs on the top.  The chicken came out surprisly moist since I always used very thin, 98% fat free chicken slices.

This was a very easy recipe and my whole family loved it!  I wouldn't mind adding a sauce of somekind next time.  I ended up serving it with scalloped potatoes which had a little bit of a sauce to help give the chicken that little extra.  Great recipe!!

Loved this recipe. It was very easy! I dipped chicken in egg wash before the bread crumbs too. I'll use thinner sliced ham & cheese next time.
I added a little pat of butter on top of each also.
Good stuff!

I served this recipe as bite-size apetizers, and it turned out pretty good.  After rolling the chicken breast with the ham and cheese, I secured it with several toothpicks and cut the roll between each tootpick.  I also skipped the last step (add cheese and bake for a few more minutes).  It was a little dry, and I'll try cooking it less next time, but I'll definitely try it again!

You can use bacon and cheddar cheese as a substitute. If your chicken breasts are already seasoned, don't add salt. I would pre-thaw the chicken slowly, rather than in the microwave. Chicken tended to break apart when I flattened it.

Chicken Cordon Bleu is my boyfriends favorite dish. I decided to make it for the first time for him.  It was easier to make than I anticipated.  I rolled the breast in egg and then rolled it the bread crumbs.  I also added a slab of butter on top of each of the breasts and then baked it. (thanks for the extra tips in the reviews!!!)I also made the sauce recipe (sour cream, cream of chicken soup and lemon juice) that is called for in the Cordon Bleu Chicken Rolls by Michelle. This was absolutely delicious!!!!

Really good recipe!  I made this and our guests thought that I was a professional chef, they liked it a lot!  I think that it is also a very simple recipe, not too many ingredients.  We made a sauce to go with it that was 1 small can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 T. of lemon juice.  The sauce went really well with it.

This was a very easy recipe. Instead of sprinkling the bread crumbs on top of the chicken after I rolled them up, I rolled them in a seasoned flour then into a egg wash and then I rolled them in the bread crumbs until well coated.
They turned out wonderful!!! My husband loved it!
I'm always trying to find something new to make for dinner!!!

This is a great recipe.  I made it for Sunday dinner and everyone loved it.  I agree with some other reviews that it needs a little pat of butter before baking the first time.

Very good.  My husband loved it.  But I think that I used ham slices that were a little too thick.  Next time I will use thin slices.  But other than that it was very good.  I also topped the chicken with a little butter and they were very moist.

Next time I am going to use a milder cheese.  The swiss was very strong.  Otherwise it was a great recipe.

Loved the video and recipe!  I only had Japanese style bread crumbs so it looks a little lighter but it is amazing! I also used Mozzarella instead of swiss as it was on hand and my younger children prefer that to swiss. My cooking time took a bit longer ( about 10 minutes longer) but that could have been due to my fear of under-cooked chicken!  Thank you for this tasty recipe!

I thought the original recipe was a 4 star recipe but we bumped it up to a 5 star with a couple easy additions: Added 1/2 tsp ground mustard seed and 1 tsp dried Thyme to the seasoning used on the chicken. We also used gluten free breadcrumbs so everyone could eat the meal. I topped it with a beautiful mustard sauce (simple roux using rice flour, then added a splash of dry sherry,  2  cups of chicken broth and 2 Tbsp of grainy dijon mustard). 
Another hint is to pound the chicken, fill and roll then refrigerate a couple hours before cooking then you won't need the toothpicks. Take out of the refrigerator 10 mins before baking. 
The family absolutely loved it!

Used an egg wash & panko bread crumbs with paprika to coat before baking.  No cheese on top, but made a sauce from another cordon blue recipe of butter, chicken bullion, heavy cream & corn starch and drizzled on right before serving. Took longer to bake because thicker chicken breasts.  I need more practice rolling them up (not too pretty), but will keep trying.  My family loved it, and first time I ever made it.

Super easy & super yummy! I cut the recipe to make 2 breasts. I used Krakus low salt ham and swiss cheese both from the deli. I skipped the salt & pepper since the seasoned crumbs are salty enough. I melted 1 T. butter per breast & rolled the pounded breasts up then rolled them in the melted butter before rolling in the crumbs.  I did not need nor use toothpicks or ties; I put the rolls seam side down in the pan & they were fine like that. Drizzled with leftover butter then baked at 375 for 40 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes & oven roasted vegetables. Delicious!

This is a very easy recipe that will impress your family and friends.  The recipe works perfectly as written.  I did, however, add garlic and onion powder to the chicken along with the salt and pepper for added flavor.  This will definitely be one for the recipe box.

This came out so good! I dipped the chicken in an egg wash before coating it with Italian bread crumbs. My husband loved it! I made the "potato rounds" recipe from all recipes. It really went well together.

The classic recipe would use skin-on breasts.  This recipe would be expected to turn out dry, which it does.

This recipe was awesome!  I made a couple of slight changes though: First, I substituted cheddar for swiss.  I never have been a fan.  Then I added butter to the breading and figured, heck, while I'm at it, I'll add some flour and yeast, too.  After that, I made a slight change and used ground beef for the chicken (less pounding that way :) and I didn't cook the breading on the meat, I rolled into little balls and baked it separately.  I used bacon instead of ham.  I cooked the meat on a grill, without rolling, mind you :)  I put the cheese topped meat on top of the freshly baked bread balls (sliced in half), added the bacon and...viola!  Best Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe I've ever tried!

I'm a daring guy, so I used provolone instead of Swiss.  Made this twice now and it's awesome!  I baked at 390 for 40 min because I was too scared to go 400; 350 for 35min left me with warm raw chicken.  Make sure you cut in to chicken to see if it's cooked through.  First time I made it, I forgot that step after cooking at 350 and put the cheese on top too early, baked for another 20 min at 400 and it was finally done.  Good eating!  Makes me look like I know what I'm doing!

This is my second time making it. The first time I bought full chicken breasts and cut them in half and pounded them. They were really difficult to roll the first time and ended up being a real messy prep. I was really disgruntled trying to fit the whole piece of ham and cheese inside. They ended up being very delicious despite the messiness. This time I bought already-thinly-sliced chicken breasts and pounded them just a little bit. I was able to roll them much easier and didn't care if the ham and cheese was sticking out of the roll. I used butter the first time, and an egg this time to coat each roll before rolling them in breadcrumbs. I didn't need to secure with toothpicks. This is a very delicious and quick-to-prep meal. I recommend Boar's Head ham and baby swiss. I used Virginia Ham the first time, and Tavern Ham this time around; both are wonderful.

This recipe was a huge hit for dinner when I made this!! I did do a few things that some of the other reviewers mentioned too.
I put on a bit of Mayo on each pounded breast. I mixed seasoned  bread crumbs with a crushed up baguette to give it a little more texture since I don't have panko in my pantry.  ( I added paprika, garlic powder, and of course a bit more salt and pepper) It worked out very nicely!  Make sure to season your meat very well with salt and pepper too.   I dipped them in an egg  before dipping in bread mixture on one side, then put on  a bit of Mayo on each pounded breast. I think a great addition is using  Rosemary Ham( from Costco) with 2 thin slices of swiss cheese. The extra subtle flavor of rosemary is fantastic!!  I folded the meat over and put in the 9x13 pan, filled in the pan and then used extra bread mixture on top. I did bake it at 425 for about 20+ mins.( until it came out clear)  It was so nice and crunchy but really juicy  inside!  I made the honey mustard sauce from the site that had1/2c. mustard, 1/2c. honey, and  1/2c. sour cream. DELISH!!!!! My family definitely wants to add this to our rotation :-) Enjoy!

Great easy recipe. After I rolled them up I rubbed the breast with olive oil and then rolled in a combination of regular and panco bread crumbs and added parm cheese to the crumbs. I drizzled the top with oilive oil. Cooked 30 minutes on 350 then 5 minutes under the broiler. They were delicious

Great recipe!  I have tried it twice and both times it took a little longer than 35 min in the oven.  I tried it the first time and followed the recipe but the second time I changed it a little and added onion and chive cream cheese spread between the the cheese and the ham. It gave it more flavor!  I also covered the chicken in butter before I rolled the chicken around in the bread crumbs. It was delicious this way!

Good recipe. What I like about this forum, is that I can see the subtle variations that I have not thought of. I'm not a big swiss cheese fan so I make it with Mozzarella. Like others, I use an egg wash before coating. The brown them in butter. Then bake them in homemade chicken gravy, made from the pan I brown them in. The gravy ensures that I don't dry out the chicken and makes it more tender. I can throw some rice into the gravy also and make a complete meal. Onion and mushrooms in the gravy are a must.

This is excellent, I did not make any changes and it turned out very well. I did top with the sauce that many mention since that's something my grandmother has done to cordon bleu as long as I can remember. I think next time I might try the addition of topping with butter before baking but it definitely wasn't lacking for anything. I'll definitely be repeating this one!

Hubs said this was really good.  He isn't picky but he critiques everything.  The sauce suggested by some posters (cream of mushroom, sour cream and lemon juice, ahem, I added wine) was a hit with the adults.  The kids didn't like it though.  So stay away from a wine sauce if you want your kids to like the additional sauce.  The kids enjoyed having honey mustard dressing on the side with this.

What a fun and simple recipe, took no time at all to put together. I watched the video before cooking & added the white wine ... absolutely perfect. I make every effort possible to try most of these shared recipes as the great cooks share them with us, so I can give a fair & balanced review. My company from out of town loved it ... thanks Vinjovee56
P.S. I saved the juice in the pan & created a easy white wine sauce that I laddled over the chicken.

Really quite good.  I made small portions, with very thin sliced chicken and fairly thin ham slices.  I did brush the chicken with olive oil just before sprinkling with bread crumbs.  Cooking time of 35 minutes, with 5 extra for topping of cheese was about right.  Since I did make 9 chicken rolls, I will freeze leftovers.

I think this a great starter recipe. I read many reviews and advise you to also. #1 Your ham has to battle a bunch of chicken and good cheese so get some GOOD ham. Lunch meat is not an option ( I tried it) I used a bunch of stuff in the fridge. It's Chicken with ham and cheese so don't go WILD. I used potato chips/bread crumbs/ panko ,lot's of garlic. I had stuff to use. This is cooking not rocket science. These are simple flavors and if you don't mess up they're very tasty.

Amazing! Thr only thing I did differently was using seasoned panko bread crumbs because I haven't made bread recently therefore couldn't make bread crumbs. Once cooked, I tasted it and it was great! As a reviewer recommended, I mixed 1 can of condensed chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1 T lemon juice to make a sauce. It wasn't gravy texture so I added heavy whipping cream until it was. Used this as the gravy and it was finger licking good!

Fabulous!!!  Cooked mine at 400 degrees for 35 minutes.  Removed from oven and pour the sauce mix (celery soup, sour cream and a little white wine) over the chicken.  I had heated the same mix in the microwave.  Put back in oven on 325 for eight minutes, just until the sauce was bubbling.  I will make this again for a company meal.

Excellent! Had to leave it in the oven for a bit more than the recipe states (overall it was something like an hour and 20 minutes), but it was sooo worth it! The meat became super tender and delicious, possibly because of the salt/pepper seasoning. I don't know, all I know is that I enjoyed this thoroughly.

Wow, delicious and so easy to make. I used sandwich ham but make sure it's a good quality ham. I baked mine as well at 350 (uncovered)after browning, at least that way all the cheese won't ooze out. Another tip is to use the pan you used in the oven and use that too for the sauce.

This was pretty good. The chicken was tender, and it had just the right amount of cheese. I didn't like that the bread crumbs didn't brown or cook at all, but I will try the egg wash next time. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was simple and tasty. Seemed like it was missing something. It would have looked better if I pounded the meat longer to make it thinner.

Really good and easy. I have never pounded chicken before so it fell apart a bit but i just wrapped it up anyway and it all turned out. I also did an egg bath then rolled it in a plate of panko & Shake n Bake.

Loved it!!!!!  I read the reviews & made the following adjustments... I egg washed the chicken after I secured them with toothpicks and breaded the entire roll.  I placed a pat of butter on top of each before baking.  Then... As the video suggested ... I put a cup of white wine in the baking dish before putting in the oven .  Before serving I dished some wine on each.  I think the wine gave it an amazing flavor.  As a side dipping sauce I also made the can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream & lemon.  I used at least 2 tbsp of lemon.  You definitely don't need much of the dipping sauce.   A really great dish... Into the rotation it goes!!

This is a huge hit in my family, but I altered the preparation to make it easier and faster.

Instead of pounding the chicken, I sliced into equal thin slices. Then I dipped in the egg and breaded the chicken.  After I browned the chicken, I lined it in the bottom of a glass baking dish.  I shredded the ham and cheese (cut into small pieces) and sprinkled over the chicken.  

In a separate bowl mixed cream of chicken soup with some cooking sherry and then spread over the chicken, ham, cheese mixture.  I put some melted butter on top and baked according to instructions.

My kids (ages 7, 5, and 2) love it plus my husband.  It really is an easy recipe by eliminating the process of pounding the chicken and then trying to wrap it in a perfect roll.

I did as most of the recipe advised but also threw in some sun-dried tomatoes. The family was really pleased with the outcome of this and especially the "twang" of the tomatoes!

Yes.  It's fabulous!!!!! Easy to follow. Next time I'll but a pat of butter
on top of the bread crumbs.  Yummmmmmmmmmm. I served the chicken with boiled white potatoes, then crisped them in the oven until slightly browned.

I made this recipe without using the salt and pepper.  I baked it for 35 minutes like it says in the recipe but the internal temp of the chicken was only about 120 so I baked it for about an hour total to get it to 170.  Otherwise, very good recipe.  I'll be making this again soon.

Yum yum yum! And so so easy! I made these chicken breasts today for the first time tweaking the recipe slightly.  I dipped the chicken in egg and then in pregresso brand Italian bread crumbs I find that seasoning is very tasty in these bread crumbs,  I use them for everything. Then I put my ham and cheese  in and rolled them up. I used toothpicks to hold the chicken in place.  Then as other users recommended I placed a pat of butter on top of the breast. Baked about 45mins then melted the cheese on top. Super juicy. Super easy! Will definitely make again.

Very good. Used a flour,egg,crumb combo to coat the chicken. I used cooking spray on the pan and over the chicken. Came out very well. Crispy,almost like it was fried. Be careful of overclocking it though.

This recipe was a home-run!  I purchased chicken tenderloin fillets so that I did not have to pound the chicken thin.  I took the advice of several others and used an egg wash prior to breading.  For an extra kick and to make this a spin on a "croque monsiuer," I added a little dijon mustard into the egg wash.  After the egg wash and before breading, I put the salt, pepper and a little paprika onto each piece of chicken.  I then breaded the entire piece of chicken (as opposed to 'sprinkling' bread crumbs only on the outside).  It turned out absolutely incredible, paired with rosemary garlic mashed potatoes and some haricots verts sauteed in lemon and garlic.

Bon appetit!

Made it according to other's directions (coated one side of breast with egg wash then dipped in bread Ian's gluten free italian bread crumbs then rolled).  Cooked at 400 degrees for 28 minutes.  Made sauce of 1 container/can cream of mushroom soup (I messed up - it was supposed to be cream of chicken but it was still good) with 1/2 c sour cream and 1 Tbsp lemon juice.

I used chicken breast tenderloins. Due to dietary restrictions, I used havarti cheese instead of ham, and parmesan instead of breadcrumbs. I also doubled the amount of swiss called for, used white pepper instead of black, and added a few shakes of chili powder. As the tenderloins wouldn't roll up, I just made two layers of chicken, separated by cheese, and topped with cheese. I also poured about half a cup of white wine over the chicken before I cooked it, as several reviews mentioned it can dry out quickly. It took about 35 minutes on 350, and tasted heavenly.

I just fed this to the pickiest 10 year old on the planet: my step-son. He loved it!!! And so did his skeptical daddy who doesn't venture out too much when it comes to good. He's a southern meat and potatoes man. I did dip the rolled chicken in melted butter before rolling all sides in bread crumbs, then added a pay of butter before putting it in the oven. Delicious!

I used crunched up seasoned croutons instead of bread crumbs.  I coated the chicken with egg and breaded both sides before the Swiss and ham.  I also added some cream cheese and sautéed mushrooms in the middle with the ham and swiss.  I did the Cream of Chicken soup sauce with the lemon juice and this was an absolute HIT with even my most skeptical friends!!!!!

Easy to make & very tasty! I'm not a fan of ham, but I wanted to try as is, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Next time, ill try it without the ham...maybe even add cream of brocolli for a whole new recipe :)

The chicken was raw in the middle! Maybe these large pieces with rib meat that they sell as breasts are too big...I hammered them flat, but the rolls did seem very big (5 fit snuggly in the 9x11" pan). Just a warning: give it longer cook time if the chicken breasts are large. After nuking, I'd say these were okay - not as good as I'd hoped. (I made a cream/white wine sauce that helped a lot!)

I have made this recipe many times.  It is a regular in our house.  This time, I realized that I had chicken tenderloins, instead of breasts.  No problem!  I just wrapped everything around the chicken, instead of rolling it up inside.  Turned out great.  I think my 4-year-old even liked them better :-)

We wanted try something new with the kids (9, 6), and we wanted to use chicken. So in search of a new recipe we've never tried, this one popped up! :) It was simple and we didn't want to rush cooking and preparing, I did everything ahead of time because No. 2 gets out of school at noon and No. 1 gets out at 225. I followed the directions as is with a little flare. I added parmesan cheese, Mrs. Dash, Accent, and a little bit of red chili flakes to the salt and pepper mix in the outside of the chicken. Instead of ham, I used bacon!! I served the chicken with angel hair pasta and steamed baby carrots and broccoli. I did cook some corn cobs, but we didn't get to that.

Made it exactly how it said. Did not change a thing and came out great. I used thin sliced deli smoked ham and swiss. Think I'll use mozzarella next time, not a big fan of swiss but I always make a recipe how it says first before changing anything the next time.  Used 4 breast.

This is such a simple recipe and it tastes so yummy! I've started making it at least once a week for dinner in my house. 

After a couple of tries though, I did start to butterfly the chicken before pounding it and that helped with the rolling part significantly. This also seemed to help prevent the majority of the cheese from creeping out the side of the chicken while cooking.

This was a hit with my family. Used black forest ham. We are not huge fans of Swiss, so I substituted Dubliner cheese. Definitely adding this to the rotation.

My one suggestion is to use dry spaghetti instead of toothpicks. They cook right along with the roll and you don't have to go looking for toothpicks to remove.

I followed the directions just as they were written, and it was wonderful!  Now that I have really looked over some of the suggestions from other posters, it will be fun to try some of them when I make this again.  This was super simple, fast and tasty.  My in-laws loved it as well!

I finally got to make this tonight for supper. First of all I could not find my meat hammer so I had to use my wooden rolling pin. The Hubs was in the basement. I fixed his plate and called him up. He sat down and just stared at it. After he tasted it, he said, "Man, this is better then restaurant food." Needless to say, he LOVED it. I followed the recipe as is except we are not fans of Swiss Cheese, so I used both provolone and I found some sliced Gouda. Served with mashed potatoes, asparagus with hollandaise sauce and deviled eggs. I really think next time I will not include another sauce as I used the cream of chicken soup, sour cream, lemon juice. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will definitely make again as my husband said, "You know the boys would love this."

WONDERFUL easy weeknight recipe!! Good enough for the weekend too :) I cook it at 400 instead of 350 for a shorter amount of time and it turns out great. Use provolone instead of Swiss if cooking for kiddos. Will make this over and over!

This was FABULOUS!!! I did what other reviewers recommended with dipping it in egg (I added a little bit of milk in with it) and then rolled in the bread crumbs. The one thing I did myself was left out the salt and pepper and then poured a little bit of cream of chicken soup on top of each one of them before cooking to keep them moist. Next time, I will experiment and try dipping the whole piece in the cream of chicken (with an egg added into it)and THEN rolling in the bread crumbs to get more of the flavor and still keep the juiciness. Wonderful recipe, will definately be making this again.

Made this recipe with 9 yr. old grand daughter and it was a hit! Really, she learned how to tenderize the meat and had fun! Very flavorful but make a sauce next time.

I just tried this recipe and it was a huge hit in my house :) everyone loved it. What I would do differently is coat the whole chicken in break crumbs and add some kind of chicken seasoning...but other then that it was great. And we didnt have cooking spray so we used veggie oil. Deffanitly staying on the dinner menu and possibly using for future dinner parties!

This recipe was amazing! My family loved it and fought over the leftovers the next day. I also used egg to coat the chicken before I used the breadcrumbs. I also made the sauce 1 can of cream of chicken, 1Tbs of lemon juice and 1/2 cup of sourcream. The sauce was incredible for the Chicken :) I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe! We too egg washed then rolled in panko bread crumbs. And we also added spinach to the roll and used provolone instead of Swiss. It was awesome!!

My boyfriend and I made this for dinner and absolutely loved it!! We followed some of the other reviews and used egg wash and covered the entire chicken in bread crumbs. We also cooked it for 20-25 minutes at 400 degrees. Next time we think we might try to add a sauce, but even without it, it was still amazing and very easy to make.

Excellent recipe and so easy to follow! My family loved it as did the surprise guest we had for dinner that night. I think the next time I make it I will add a creamier cheese so that its gooier. Still an excellent recipe as is.

New FAMILY FAVORITE. I made a couple of adjustments to the recipe...... NO salt, I seasoned the chicken with a little pepper and I added parmesan to the bread crumbs. It was absolutely DELICIOUS. One thing I need to do different the next time is make way more than I did. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!

mmmm.... this was so good!!  Hubby isnt a pork eater, so I used turkey ham.  Didnt even notice the difference.  After pounding out the chicken I placed the chicken in the plate of breadcrumbs and assembled it there.  This gave me a full bread crumb coverage.  I also made the cream of chicken sauce suggested by another review. Will keep making this!

This is a beautiful dish!!  Fairly easy, but enough steps that it takes about 25 minutes to prepare, not 10.  I used shaved slices of deli ham inside, and baby swiss.  I also just added seasoned bread crumbs, and will definitely do an egg-wash first next time.  I made the lemon-chicken-sour cream sauce that others recommended, and my boyfriend would've been happy with just a bowl of that, I think.  :-)

The recipe is good, classy, not too rich, good presentation, and drizzle a little sauce on some green veggies.  Or dip a dinner roll in it.  This dish ended up being a hit!

Oh, this was fantastic! Just some notes about how I prepared it --- I used honey ham (which gave it a nice little kick of taste), and instead of sprinkling bread crumbs on the chicken, I rolled mine in bread crumbs. Great dish!

My hubby & mom liked it as well as me. Din't bother with the breading, just baked it plain with provolone cheese & ham slices. Put some provolone on top of each piece of rolled chicken. Baked for 40 minutes at 350 & it came out great! Will make again.

Made this last night for dinner (husband, mom and toddler). Everyone loved it - my mom and husband both had seconds. I followed someone else's suggestions of adding 1/2 slice swiss just before done; cooking 25 mins @ 400 degrees; and a thin line of honey mustard before rolling up. I didn't have toothpicks or string so I just set it down carefully and it was fine. We are counting carbs and this recipe is perfect for that!

I disagree with others that gave this recipe only 4 stars because they felt they "had to change things" to make it work. I am the opposite.  I give it a 5 star because i  CAN change it each & every time i make it to suit my needs for that night :)  As others have said, i never ever follow a recipe to the letter when i make it, i prefer to make it my "own" by changing things up a bit whenever I make a recipe that i find.

i never add the salt because i use prosciutto & swiss cheese both of which are pretty salty on their own.  I also add mayo to the middle, and sometimes even coat it w/mayo prior 2 doing the bread crumbs, even tho it's extremely messy to do!  I really like the ideas some have had about a sauce or gravy, but i doubt my fam would go for the cream of mushroom soup that i do have on hand.  however, i DO have the new product of chicken stock in pre-measured pats that i think i'll try (this time around anyway!) with a combination  of sour cream/cream cheese and of course the lemon juice. 

i think i will also follow others advice to add melted butter to the top of the packets, but i'll probably do that after I uncover it in the last 20 minutes, just sprinkle the whole pan with the melted butter, and i have a family size pkg of chicken!  Not worth it to leave some undone chicken, bca my family WILL be more than happy to eat left overs :) when you heat up the sliced rolls of chicken and put those on a sandwich :)

Really good and super easy!  I did not try the sauce, but was excellent without.  The egg definitely help the crumbs stick.  It did not say to cover, but I did for a good 25 minutes so the crumbs wouldn't burn.  Great recipe, Kiersten!

my family loved this, especially little sisters. I am not the biggest fan though.. I didn't add the extra pat of butter or salt on the chicken the second time I made it and I still found it to be quite salty. I did use an egg wash (first time with yolk, second time without yolk to try to bring down the saltiness) but it was still a bit salty for my taste. Could be the ham, not sure.

This was great.  My husband and kids both liked it.  I didn't have any swiss on hand so I used provolone.  Personally, I would like it better with swiss, but made do.  It was still good.  I pounded my chicken breasts very thin, so I could have reduced the cooking time a little as they were on the dry side, but to no fault of the submitter of this recipe.  I should have known to lower the cook time.  Thanks for submitting!

this was very easy to make, my husband who doesn't even like ham loved this dish and ask for me to cook it again! the only thing i didn't do was use salt and pepper on the chicken I just try to avoid as much salt as possible and and I did forget the pepper! I've been looking for other ways to eat chicken breats and this is def the recipe for that!!! enjoy! :)

Love this recipe!  My husband declared that this was one of his favorite things I've ever made, and he stressed what a big deal that was!  Great recipe to use up leftover ham.  I made it with the sauce that other members recommended (cream of chicken, lemon juice & sour cream).  Also used panko crumbs that I toasted first.  Fast & easy!Have already added this one to my permanent recipe collection!  Thanks for sharing, Kiersten!

Sorry folks, but this dish was extremely bland.  I even made several changes based upon the reviews.  My other 3 family members feel the same, in fact, we could only take a few bites.  Everything else I've tried on this site has been simply amazing.  Guess we're big flavor buffs!

Okay.  This is my first time reviewing anything on this site, though I view and use these recipes daily.  My husband actually begged me to blog about this meal.  Followed advice of others, egg wash, pat o' butter, Panko crumbs and cream of chicken sauce.  Easy!! Only other change - wrapped each in two slices of bacon.  OMG!!!!!  Please try this.  To die for!! Just shared amazing upscale dinner with my husband on recent business trip and he felt this was better!!!! Serve with wild rice.  YUMMMY!!!

This was very tasty! My boyfriend said it was one of the best he ever had. I dipped the chicken in egg wash and breaded the whole thing (after I wrapped it up). I think next time I'll try the provolone instead of swiss cheese. That's just a personal choice though.

Easy and delicious!  I took the advice of others and dipped the chicken in egg and then laid it on a plate of breadcrumbs then rolled it from there. also added the pat of butter to the tops of each before baking. it was so yummy. i also served it over rice with biscuts and made the sauce. (cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup sourcream and Tbsp of lemon juice).i never would have guessed I could make this at home. thanks for the new addition to the recipe box!

Have been making a variation of this for years and it's outstanding every time.  I don't bread the breasts, but add a can of cream of mushroom soup, poured over top.  Spoon some over top when plated.  It's so quick & easy and great for company, they think you cooked all day.  Add any vege's you like, the dish is quite filling.

Made this for dinner last night and it was a nice addition to my chicken repertoire. I used low sodium ham and swiss to healthify a bit. I also browned it in a skillet on top of the stove first, using just a tiny bit of olive oil and very small amount of Italian bread crumbs for a bit of crust. Then finished it in the oven. It was very moist and flavorful and really didn't take that long at all. Served it with Mushroom Parmesan Cous Cous. Thanks, Kiersten, for a great, easy dinner idea!

I love Chicken Cordon Bleu (named after the cooking school in Paris). The chicken is hot enough so that when you take it from the oven, a slice of cheese on the top will automatically melt before you serve it. Serve with steamed broccoli or cauliflower as a side dish.

Fabulous recipe. My suggestion to get chicken "thin enough to roll" (about 1/4"): Place chicken between plastic wrap, use a meat clever with the flat side applied to pound the chicken. It will take a few seconds, but that chicken will flatten! :) Thanks for a great recipe fit for a king -- and about any company we might have.

Really easy, really good.  I did make the cream sauce with the chicken soup, and it was pretty good, but a little too much lemon for my tastes.  Will definitely make again!

Super good and easy to make! I loved it, my husband didn't but he doesn't like anything. I used thin sliced foster farms chicken breast, so I didn't have to pound and it was easy to roll. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I just seasoned my own with dried parsley, paprika, salt and pepper. I served with stuffing and corn. I made the sauce everyone recommended, but I didn't like the flavor so I just served with a side of mustard (honey mustard would be good too). Overall delicious recipe and I will definately make it again.

This was so easy to make! It was my first time trying a recipe on this site and I wanted to make chicken. First time making chicken cordon bleu as well! The ingredients were simple and the prep wasn't hard at all. I felt like a rookie could make it. I kept it cooking a little longer than they suggested and so it was a little dry. The next time I make this, I'll make sure to take it out on time.

from this starting point there are so many variations: - mustard in-between the chicken and ham - cheese choices  - mushrooms and other stuffings - asparagus These just name a few...the wonderful thing about this recipe is that it gives the great cook (or the not so great) the basics and there is so much room to let it ride from there!...and you really can't screw it up. It's a great simple recipe without getting creative with it.  Note: if you want to stuff a bunch in there before rolling, use ties instead of toothpicks.

Very good recipe.  I did a different sauce just because I don't have any white whine.  I use cream of chicken soup with 4 oz. of cream cheese and 1/2 can of water.

What a great easy recipe.  I decided to use provolone cheese as my husband doesn't care for swiss.  I also doctored up the bread crumbs with some spices to give it some flavor.  I actually dipped the rolled up chicken in the bread crumbs so it was completely coated and I didn't put cheese on the top to keep it a little crispier.  I also bought a packet of hollandaise sauce to serve with it.  Delicious, my husband said it is his favorite dish!

first time making this and LOVED IT!!!!  few things on my part,  i forgot to bread it, which turned out just fine... actually perfect... at the last minute it put a little crushed up crackers and a little butter.... i baked it, then pan fried to get a little darker crust.... turned out sooooooo yummy... seasoned the chicken with a little sea salt and pepper and a little lemon pepper...  and i ended up making more of a gravy then a sauce... but no complaints.  will make this again.

I dipped the chicken in egg wash as others recommended and used mozzarella cheese sticks as my family doesn't like swiss. Everyone loved it.

This was super tasty and really easy to make.  I was having problems with toothpicks so I used kabob sticks that I cut down a bit.  I also used crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs for a little crispier crust.  This is my husband's new favorite.

This was amazing! I used a can of cream of chicken with herbs and 1/2 a cup of sour cream and spooned that over the chicken and served over rice pilaf. Definitely will be making this again!

tasty, but pouding the chicken breasts was a pain.  I was basically wrapping mush around the filling, it didn't stay together well at all.  definitely tastes good though.

Made a few changes, I used ham steak, and thiner chicken breasts. I secured them with a toothpick and dipped only the top with egg and seasoned bread crumbs. Very delicious. I made a gravy out of a few drippings, creamed mushroom soup, sour cream and lemon juice. Its a keeper! Thanx

I tried this one for my family and my super picky eater (would live on chicken nuggets and peanut butter sandwiches if allowed) announced that this was the best thing I've ever made! My jaw is still on the floor. :) Thanks for the great recipe. I adjusted some based on other reviews but this one is a keeper. so easy and so good!

My family LOVED this! Even the two year old! :) I read the reviews and I did the same thing as many others suggested- making the sauce to go on top out of cream of chicken, lemon juice, and sour cream. I also soaked my chicken in buttermilk all day long. It was soooo good!

Great recipe!  I used jack cheese, my husband loved that change.  I also dipped in egg and put a pat of butter on top.  Next time I will omit the butter and just use the creamy sauce suggested on the site (1 can cream chic soup & sour cream).  I heated this on stove & allowed family to drizzle their chicken.  My husband loved the sauce & also poured on his veggies.

Very yummy! The only thing my family changed was substituting the swiss with mozzarella. We tried it with swiss before but didn't really like the combination. But with mozzarella, it tastes amazing!

Exellant.  I sprinkled salt/pepper then put ham/cheese rolled and tied with kitchen string.  Then we cooked them in a deep fryer and served with a mushroom gravey.  Best Cordon Bleu I have cooked.

This was certainly a hit with my husband. Did not change anything to the recipe and it came out wonderful. A few weeks later, I also took the suggestions of some of the other people and soaked all the chicken in the egg before putting on the bread crumbs and put butter on top to keep it moist. It was also wonderful.

Very easy and tasty!  I put 1 tbsp of butter in the pan while the oven warmed up.  Rolled the chicken, ham and cheese then put it in an egg wash then in bread crumbs.  Came out great!  Loved it!

This is my boyfriend's favorite meal. The only thing I have done that was a little different was add more ham if the ham you buy is very thin. I coat the entire breast with the breadcrumbs and then roll up the ham & swiss. I took another reviewer's advice and added a pat of butter on top before backing which really helps keep the chicken moist. I tried someone's sauce recipe with chicken soup and sour cream..I did not care for it! Last night I made some hollindase sauce and poured that on top & it was even better! Try the hollindase sauce if you want added flavor!

Very easy and tastes wonderful. I make the sauce that the others mentioned (can of cream of chicken, lemon juice, and sour cream-I add milk to thin the sauce to desired consistancy). Husband loves this one too.

This recipe ROCKS!!! I used Povalone instead of swiss and put a pat of butter on each one before cooking it. I dreged the chicken in flour and dipped it in eggs before coating it in breading. I used the Italian Bread Crumbs but I put Parmasan Cheese, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Ground Oregano, Basil, and Italian Seasoning to taste in the Breading. I cooked them for 10 minutes on 350F then turned them up to 400F for the last 20 minutes. It was PERFECT!!!  My mom says it's the BEST Chicken Cordon Bleu she's EVER had!!! THANK YOU!!!

Sooooooo yummy!! I cooked this for my parents and my dad said it was better than when he had it at a five star restaurant. It was very easy. Instead of sprinkling the bread crumbs, I laid the chicken on a platefull of breadcrumbs, added the ham and cheese then rolled from there.  As sides I served rice pilaf and Garlic-buttered green beans with  mushrooms from this site. I will be cooking this again.

I can't give this 5 stars, because I changed it. My end result was crazy delicious, but the recipe itself is just a really good starting point. The changes I made were to dredge in egg mixed with 1 tbsp melted butter, and then in seasoned breadcrumbs before baking. I also spooned a homemade honey dijon sauce on the ham/swiss before rolling. My husband's not a big sauce guy, so this subtle addition was the perfect amount and really made the flavor pop. I think pounding out the chicken breasts is a must here. It doesn't take long and ensures your chicken will come out moist and tender. Overall very good and something I'll make again and again.

Followed the recipe exactly, but we also made the cream of chicken soup/sour cream sauce that other reviewers suggested. The recipe by itself was good, but the sauce kicked it into amazing. The sauce is a necessity.

These were really good!! I was way too lazy to pound out the breasts, so I butterflied them and tucked the ham and swiss in that way. Dipped them into an egg wash, rolled in seasoned bread crumbs and baked with a pat of butter on each one. They came out better than expected! I'm excited to try this same method with different fillings!

I have made this several times..I would recommend using fresh chicken breasts (not the frozen/water-added ones).  I have used the frozen ones and they seem to fall apart when they get pounded.  Sometimes it's messy when you try rolling up the chicken/ham/cheese but once they are secure, they are ok.  One recommendation I would also use is one I learned from previous reviews here (but I don't see it anymore).  Use the sauce recipe from Aussie Chicken...it's SO worth it.  Even my meat and potatoes husband LOVES that sauce.

This was a big plus at our dinner table last night, everyone raved at how good it was! I did change one thing, I used boneless chicken breast steaks (thick ones), instead of the boneless chicken breast, I cut a slit in the thickest part and stuffed it with the ham and cheese. This is a keeper, and I will be making it again! Thanks, Kiersten for sharing this wonderful flavorful recipe

YUM YUM YUM!!! We used Italian seasoned bread crumbs (it was all we had) and did the egg wash dip too and it came out AMAZING! I also made a sauce which was Melt 1tbs of butter in saucepan, add 1 tbs flour, stir then add 1 cup milk, stir until it thickens a little and add 1/2 swiss cheese, stir until melted, salt and pepper to taste- YUM!

This recipe was pretty good, but not very specific. I've never made chicken cordon bleu before, so I got a bit confused about how much a slice of swiss cheese was, as well as how big a slice of ham would be, probably because I only had a brick of swiss cheese and a pound of shaved ham to work with. I ended up not using enough of either...so the chicken came out a bit dry. I think it could have used a sauce as well. My family liked it, but they didn't love it. I'll probably use a different recipe next time I want to make chicken cordon bleu, but thanks for sharing!

Delicious, but a little time consuming.  I used sliced provolone and baked for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.  Came out perfect

I did NOT find this bland at all?  The ham really gives it flavor.  I use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  It is really a quick and yummy dish; once you pound the chicken the rest of the recipe is a breeze.  Occasionaly, I need something different than our regular meals and this is one I definetly pick!!  Whole family loves it.

DELICIOUS!!!! I've tried making chicken cordon bleu a few times before and couldn't figure out what was going wrong....I figured it out with this recipe...I wasn't flattening out the chicken breast. This recipe is going to be a staple in my house. Not dry and seasoned perfectly.

Made this as a treat for my husband because he only gets to eat this about once a year when we go out to eat at Mimis. He loved it more than the one he gets at MiMi's. I used some of the tips given in other reviews. dipping the chicken in egg and laying it on the bread crumbs when rolling and adding butter to the top of the breast right before putting it in the oven. In addition, because my husband likes his ham and cheese, i put two layers of each. A lot of the cheese melted in the oven and into the baking dish but it created something that looked like a cheese sauce, which made it even better! I baked for 30min at 400 degrees and then put a cheese slice on top and baked for 5 min or until the cheese was melted. My husband and i both agree, this is a keeper and will hit our dinner table more than just once a year.

I LOVED this dish, I made it for myself, my boyfriend and our roommate and we all loved it.  I took the suggestion of dipping the chicken in egg first before the bread crumbs and I baked at 400 for 25 minutes.  I was going to make the sauce that many people suggested but I actually forgot and it still turned out amazing!!  I paired it with asparagus and mushrooms, I will be making this many more times!

So yummy! My husband said "you definitely can make that again" I combined few of the reveiws together and then made it my own too. (1) I sliced the chicken in half and then half again. so I had 4 slices. I had a total of 3 breasts to start with and by cutting them I could have 4 servings by using only 3 chicken layers.(2) Then I layered  starting with the chicken then sliced ham, sliced swiss and then chicken again. do this until you put the final 3rd piece of chicken.(3) wash chicken in egg wash using 2 eggs then roll in bread crumbs. I made my own seasoned bread crumbs. Mix in bowl 1c. bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp. prarsley flakes, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder,1/4 tsp.sugar 1/8 tsp. italian seasoning , 1/8 tsp pepper and 1/4 tsp salt. Add a pat of butter bake  at 350 for 40 min . Last 20 min cover with tin foil. Remove tin foil and place half slice of cheese . Then back in the oven it goes for  the last 5 min. I also made the sauce 1 can of cream chicken soup ,1/2 c. sour cream and 1 Tbs of lemon juice. I cooked it on med low heat to warm it up.We had company that night and when askd if it was ok said oh it's better than ok!

My husband and I loved this! I started with thin cut breasts and pounded them down. I used three deli slices of Black Forest ham and one slice of Swiss cut in half so the ham and Swiss covered the whole breast before rolling. I only had panko bread crumbs on hand and it worked out perfectly. Fancy looking yet simple to prepare.

This is a great recipe. Instead of pounding the chicken to make it thinner to roll it I just cut the chicken breasts almost completely in half and put the ham and cheese in the middle then rolled it in shake and bake. It came out perfect and my dinner guests really liked it!

This recipe is GREAT!  My husband loved it and even my picky 4 year old daughter cleaned her plate.    I did make a sauce consisting of equal parts mayonnaise, cream cheese, and sour cream, added milk for the desired consistency, 2 tablespoons of parsley, and a dash each of garlic powder, paprika, and pepper.    Another variation I tried was using saltine cracker crumbs and added seasonings to taste.  They weren't soggy at all.  As another reviewer, I used two slices of ham lunch meat which worked well although I will probably use a little more then next time.  I served this with scalloped potatoes and broccoli.  The sauce was excellent over the broccoli as well.

Great recipe! I make a sauce with 1 can cream of chicken & mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 tablespoon dijon mustard. I mixed well and put under the chicken so the breadcrumbs didn't get soggy. Everyone loved it.

Just made this last night.  My family loved it!  I followed suggestions of others and dipped chicken in egg then in bread crumbs.  You'll need more bread crumbs, if you do this.  It's great with whole wheat bread crumbs.  I also tried the sauce of cream of chicken and sour cream.  We found it to be too rich and the dish was better without it!  I used provolone, as it's milder than swiss and baked for 40 minutes. Will make again and again!

It's so easy...and my boyfriend was so impressed.  My dirty secret is I used just some packaged lunch meat for the ham...he couldn't tell!  You can use fancy ingredients...but you don't have to.  Simple ingredients still impress!!

This was extremely delicious. I added 2 additional slices of ham on each chicken breast and one additional slice of swiss cheese on each as well. I also slathered egg batter on the entirety of both chicken breasts before adding the breadcrumbs. I chose not to add the additional slice of cheese on the top since I already added more inside both breasts.

absolutely LOVE this recipe.  my husband and i eat a lot of chicken meals involving chicken breasts, so this is perfect.  a suggestion if you can't find large chicken breasts: smaller ones work fine if you butterfly them and then pound them thin.

Very tasty. I used string cheese in the middle and it was even better. The difficult part was securing the chicken so the ingredients wouldn't fall out.

This recipe tasted pretty good. Everyone loved it in my family. It was also very easy for a chicken cordon bleu recipe, but I think it would have tasted better with the real hollandaise sauce that traditionally goes with it.

This is a good recipe.  Definitely needs more cheese added.  Instead of just sprinkling bread crumbs, I melted some butter and after I had rolled up the chicken, I rolled it in the butter and then coated the entire chicken with bread crumbs.  Also to give the bread crumbs some extra flavor, I add some garlic salt, parsley and italian seasoning.  It was delicious!!!

Delish!! I did use an egg so the breadcrumbs would stick. Also used the sauce suggested(cream of chicken, lemon juice and sour cream) but I added peas. Next time I will double the ham and cheese. Very Good! My b-f loved this and couldnt stop commenting on it:)

Made this once with chicken breasts and they turned out dry and bland.  Made them again with chicken tenders with a pat of butter on top and they were amazing.

This is my boyfriend's new favorite, he asks for it all the time. Now I cook four pieces instead of the normal two portion meals because he takes leftovers to work with him for lunch. I rub garlic salt into the chicken and then dip it in egg and breadcrumbs before rolling it. It helps the breadcrumbs stick and gives it a very nice flavor.

I dipped my rolled up chicken in a beaten egg and then in chicken broth then into the bread crumbs. I also added italian seasoning to my bread crumbs to give it a little bit more flavor. They were very very good though!!!

I was worried about this but OMG is was so yummy! I used provolone instead of swiss and added garlic to the bread crumbs and it came out delicious. I didnt make any sauce dont think it needed it! I also didnt use tooth picks and it held just fine. Thanks this will be served every month at my home.

Very good!  I should have pounded the chicken so it would be thinner -- I will definitely do that the next time I make it.  I didn't make any sauce to go with it but I think that would make this dish 5 star.

I have made this so many time I have lost count.I usually make it with Sugar Snap Peas with Mint and Feta Cheese Mashed Potatoes found on here. I use Colby-Jack cheese. Everyone I have EVER made this for (including a few friends who are French) LOVE it.  rather then swiss. Also I mix a honey-mustard sauce put it on the chicken then I put the ham and cheese and roll it up.

This was really good.  I took others suggestions and dipped them in egg and then the bread crumbs and put a little butter on the top.  I also made the sauce out of cream of chicken, sour cream and lemon juice which was delicious.  I will definatley make this again.  Also, I dont think the toothpicks are necessary.  I didnt use them and they stayed rolled up just fine.

LOVED it. My absolute favorite chicken recipe. Hubbie likes more cheese, so I add an extra piece inside for him, but besides that it is perfect.

My whole family loved this.  After assembling the chicken, ham & cheese I rolled the chicken through some Italian bread crumbs and then used a little spray oil on them so they would have some crunch to them.  Will definitely make again!!!

I used Tavern Ham and Havarti Dill cheese rather than Swiss and it turned out very good.  I also made the sauce another reviewer recommended (1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon lemon juice) and it added a great flavor.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I did do the recommended sauce using cream of chicken, sour cream and lemon juice.  I also threw in a little garlic, because it's good.  The chicken was great though without it.  I used thin sliced honey ham (so used extra ham in the recipe) as well as swiss cheese (extra because I love cheese).  I did use the eggwash before breading the chicken just to make it stick a little better, I also threw in some parmeson cheese with the bread crumbs for a little extra something.  The recipe cooked up fabulous, I did the recommended TBS of butter over each breast when placing in the oven.  The cook time was a little more then posted, however it was only 10 or so minutes.  I used cooking string rather then toothpicks to secure the chicken which made it stay nice a rolled and perfect!  Great recipe with or without my slight modifications.  Thanks!

Fantastic! My husband absolutely loved this and he doesn't like ANYTHING! Very picky. My teen daughters helped make it and now ask for it all the time. I substituted pepper jack cheese for the Swiss, used 2 slices of Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh ham and dipped the rolled chicken in egg before breading. Thanks so much!

First off, I made a lot of changes...  First I took the chicken breast and butteflied it (and tenderized it a little) then seasoned both sides with some Salt, Pepper, and Garlic Powder. Then I laid a slice of Black Forrest Ham and a slice and a half of Swiss Cheese on top of the Chicken, rolled it up and put the toothpicks in to hold it together. Then I dipped the chicken in an Egg Wash and coated them with a generous coat of Panko Breading (with a few dashes of Black Pepper and a Tsp or so of Paprika mixed in with the Panko). I baked at 350 for a little over an hour, and added a slice of Swiss on top after the breading was already crispy.  I served this with Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes.  The meal turned out fantastic. My Wife and I both enjoyed it very much. If you want a little extra crunch to this recipe go with the Panko Breading. It was great. If I would make any other changes I would add more cheese inside and probably a little more ham too.  Definitely worth a try!!

Yum Yum I've actually been making this for a while. Instead of dipping in egg, I dip in zesty italian dressing and then roll in seasoned bread crumbs.  Heavenly!

This was a very easy recipe, and tasted delicious.  I did dip the chicken in some egg substitute (you could use egg) before breading them.  This helped the breading to stick better.  Also, as I wasn't sure what type of ham to use, I bought pre-cooked, pre-packaged, low-fat ham steaks, and sliced them in half lengthwise and then in half again so that there were four pieces from each ham steak.  This gave a pretty nice slice of ham for each piece of chicken.  Using reduced fat cheese also helped to lower the fat in the recipe.  I would definitely make this recipe again!

I think this needs a tasty sauce, but I couldn't figure out what...  Otherwise, it's straight-forward chicken cordon bleu -nothing special.

I make a reduced calorie version:  -thin sliced chicken breast -reduced fat thin sliced provolone  -1 slice of thin sliced deli ham  For bread crumbs, I first dip chicken in egg, then use a mixture of plain bread crumbs seasoned with our favorite Susie Q's Santa Maria Style seasoning.  We dip it in honeymustard dressing & serve with a side of whole grain brown rice & my homemade applesauce!

I took the advice of others and dipped the rolled chicken in butter before rolling in breadcrumbs.  I cooked them at 400 degrees for 45 min., which was perfect.  I also made a sauce from cream of chicken soup with various herbs because, based on other reviewers comments, I thought the chicken may be a little dry.  However, the chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was not needed.  Very good recipe that makes a beautiful presentation on the plate.

I used this recipe but added a hint of mozz on the top about 20 min in. Also, when completed I added a dash of Old Bay. Fan - Tas - Tic!

This dish was incredibly easy to make and tasted great! I used store-bought bread crumbs but added a little chopped rosemary to them which complimented the flavors wonderfully! I will definitely be making this again.

This was disappointing to me, because of the high ratings.  Upon reading dozens and dozens of them, I found most were not rating the original recipe but the changes they made TO this one.  I did like not having to roll the chicken in breadcrumbs.  That was a time saver.  I also made a sauce out of cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and zesty honey mustard.  I pounded my chicken thin, but it was nowhere near done after the 35 minutes stated.  I had to turn the oven up to 400 and let it go another 20 minutes.  Bottom line is that this was good, but nothing special.

This recipe is GREAT! I made it for mothers day for all the mothers in my family, and they all loved it...one mother brought her child, who is the most picky eater in the world, and SHE loved it! Tasted great, and was so easy!

I will absolutely be making this again!

Other than my chicken being hard to roll, this was THE best dinner I've made in a while.  I would suggest adding two slices of ham, and two slices of cheese, though!  Definitely a filling meal!  We also used just regular Shake and Bake, and it turned out great!

Easy and yummy!  My boyfriend declared it the best chicken cordon bleu he ever had.  I too took the suggestion of other commentors and dipped the breast in egg before rolling it in breadcrumbs.  Also made the chicken sauce which complemented the dish.

I just have to say, please do NOT add ANY salt to this dish. I failed to remember that the ham already has enough salt flavor. My family loved this even if it was a tad bit salty. I dipped the filled and rolled chicken in egg wash and then rolled in bread crumbs. I did not melt cheese on top but instead made a cream sauce with heavy cream, butter, paprika, dry white wine and a bit of corn starch. This was so good and easy, I'll do it again and again. I would recommend a little black pepper on the chicken before rolling. Just no salt!!!

This was a good cordon blue recipe.  I am not totally sold on rolling but it was still tasty.  I did follow others and I dipped in egg and then added the ham and cheese, and I coated both sides with breadcrumbs before rolling.  I also added butter to the top.  It wasn;t the best I have ever had but it was good and I will probably make again.

Excellent!! I took other reviewers advice and dipped the chicken in egg and bread crumbs before rolling up with the ham and cheese. I sprinkled the leftover breadcrumbs over the chicken once it was in the pan to make them a little crisper. I made a sauce using wine, chicken boullion, cornstarch and whip cream from another chicken cordon bleu recipe.

After reading the previous reviews,I made some changes to this dish. I took a short cut and used the thin cut chicken breasts. I added a swipe of dijon mustard on the inside of the chicken breast and after rolling and securing with toothpicks, dipped the chicken in an eggwash before rolling in a mixture of breadcrumbs.  Finally I made a sauce to go with the chicken: a can of cream of chicken and herbs soup, a cup of white wine, a tablespoon of lemon juice, a half cup of sour cream and salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.  It was delicious but I did find that it took much longer than the total of 35 minutes to cook.  I had to raise the temp to 425 and cooked it for another 12 minutes to finish it off.  I did cover the chicken at that time with foil to prevent it from getting too brown.  Overall, a good dish.

Whole family loved it.  My oldest son (12) helped me make it.  Easy to prepare.  I did not use bread crumbs, because I have a Glueten Free family member, but you didn't even know they were missing.  Also, did not add more cheese to top, just didn't need more calories.  I used Black Forest Ham from the deli. Yum!  Like I said before, everyone loved it!

I've made this twice, once as directed and once using eggwash and more breadcrumbs as suggested by other reviewers.  Both times it was very tasty.  The first time is considerably lighter, and the breadcrumbs act just as a bit of texture difference.  Using the eggwash, they took on a breading function.  Both very good, and very different.  Next time I'm going to try a little dijon mustard on the inside, which I think would round out the flavors.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used a combo of mozzerella and gouda cheeses because that's what I had on hand, but myself and my husband enjoyed it very much.  I also added some parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs, and put a little butter on top of chicken before baking.  Thanks for submitting!

Quick and easy.  I used cream of chicken with only half of the water to keep some of the thickness as a sauce over top.  Perhaps next time I will add a little inside before I roll it.

This turned out great! I've never had Chicken Cordon Bleu before, not even in a restaraunt. I followed some of your tips though. I purchased thin-cut chicken breasts (Foster Farms) and pounded them out a little more. I dipped them in egg and then Italian bread crumbs. I used Black Forest Ham and swiss cheese. I cooked it at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. I drizzled the basic honey mustard (equal parts of honey, mustard, and mayo) over the top. It was awesome!

I made this last night, it was the first time I ever made this and it turned out great!!! Not a bite left. Everyone loved it. It was so easy and so good!! I of course checked out the reviews before trying, and got some good suggestions. After pounding chicken, I dipped chicken in egg wash, put bread crumbs on a plate and laid chicken on top, then put cheese and ham on top, and simply rolled it up. No hassle and not much mess. I forgot to get toothpicks, so just put on baking sheet seam side down, and they didn't unroll. I put swiss cheese on top last 5 mins of baking, and while cooling, made a cream sauce with cream of chicken soup about 1 cup of sour cream, I didn't have any lemon juice, so I seasoned with a bit of lemon pepper seasoning. We served with brown rice, and steamed broccoli...Yum!!! Great success!!!

I used shake and bake to coat the chicken and I also marinated the chicken before I cooked it. I used provolone instead of swiss, because I just like it better.

I made this for a relatively picky crowd last night. It was a big hit. I had no left overs and it was so easy to make. I made a sauce using cream of chicken soup, salt, pepper, and lemon juice, but when I taste tested it, it was big on the salty side so I added cream to even it out and it worked wonderfully.

So good! My whole family loved it. It was quick and extremely easy. I had HUGE chicken breasts, so I just sliced them half (like cutlets). No pounding, easy rolling. After rolling, I dipped them in beaten egg before coating in breadcrumbs. Then I put a small pat of butter on top of each roll. Like another reviewer, I also made the honey/mustard sauce from the Aussie Chicken recipe from this site. (Note: If you make that sauce, leave out the corn syrup. It's NOT necessary!). It was so good, I'm making it for the second time in a week!

Great recipe! I will use again!  I bought thin sliced chicken and that worked great and did not salt/pepper the chicken.  Next time I will find a sauce to put over it.

I made this for Mother's Day and I made this for about 15 people. Our power went out 1/2 way through the cooking of this and we had to cook the rest of the time on the grill. Thanks god for the grill. Anyways, the mothers loved it and couldn't stop talking about.

Very easy to make and tastes great.
I dipped the chicken in eggbeaters and baked it for 25 minutes at 400. We tried rolling it but we just ended up folding it in half.

This is a very good recipe.  As suggested by others, I dipped the chicken in egg before the breadcrumbs.  Also, instead of using a honey mustard sauce as suggested, I  spread honey mustard on the chicken before I put down the meat & cheese.

I love chicken cordon bleu, but I've always been afraid that I wouldn't have much success making it myself. This recipe makes it so simple though! I like to season my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and to use seasoned breadcrumbs. I dip the rolled chicken in a beaten egg before dredging in the breadcrumbs. I've also found that thinly sliced smoked deli ham works the best in this recipe. I'll definitely be making this again, and I can't wait to try it with the recommended honey mustard sauce.

EXCELLENT! This recipe rocks!  I LOVE the fact that it doesn't have any heavy whipping cream, (which our family hates).  Our whole family enjoyed it very much with 'Honey mustard dressing II' from this site, which also is a winner. Thank you.

My husband had been asking me to make Chicken Cordon Blue for a long time.  I finally did and he had such high hopes that immense failure was probable.  But he LOVED it!  The entire family loved it!  They've been asking for it ever since!  I also used the Honey Mustard sauce and it was a great compliment.

It’s not the recipe’s fault but pounding meat, for me, is always disappointing. I use the flat side of an official meat mallet but I always end up with mushy spots and tears making it difficult to “roll up.” Maybe I am pounding it too hard and it requires a more delicate touch. Whenever I go easy on it though it seems like it’s not flattening the meat at all! I used sort of small breast filets thinking I would just fill them with less ham and cheese. But I will use large ones in the future like the recipe recommends. I also breaded both sides of the chicken before rolling it up because hubby likes breaded stuff and it sounded like a good idea from another reviewer. It added a nice flavor dimension but doing that, instead of breading the rolled up package, makes the rolling really messy. I should have breaded the inside only becasue I needed to re-bread the outside of the roll afterwards anyway. I used pieces of rather thick spiral sliced leftover ham and my Swiss cheese wasn’t too thin either. This made rolling even harder. I used the honey mustard sauce from the Aussie Chicken recipe. Hubby likes honey mustard stuff so I knew that would go over well. Presentation wasn’t too lovely but hubby gave the Chicken Cordon Bleu thumbs up so it gets five stars.

Husband and I loved it first time I made it - made it @ one month later for company.  Did follow another reviewer's recommendation for the honey mustard sauce to accompany.

Looking forward to making it soon - definately a good way to make chicken breasts special!

I noticed in the picture that it looks like there is a cream sauce over the top.  I used cream of chicken soup w/ a little milk, salt, and pepper and it was great!

I made this last week for company and they loved it! I brought left overs the next day to my parents and I got a 2 minute voice mail message from them raving about how it was better than anything they have had in a restaurant and they waned to know how I had made it! It was so much easier than I expected. I got a tip from a cook that I could pound the chicken thin enough by using a can as a tool to spread the chicken out. I put a ziploc bag over it and the can was heavy enough that this worked pretty well! I didn't have any problems wrapping it. I also used the tips here about adding the paprika, breading the entire chicken and I made the sauce suggested to go with the Aussie chicken which REALLY made the dish! I highly recommend!

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. It needed something. Maybe a sauce wrapped up inside with it because i found it quite tasteless. I cooked for the time listed but it came out dry. I will try again with more flavour because it's so easy and makes wonderful presentation but it's kind of bland.

very easy and tasty! Took other reviewers' advice and dipped the rolled chicken breasts in egg before breading. Also upped the heat to 400 and baked for 30 mins to preserve the juices. Served with roasted garlic asparagus and roasted rosemary and garlic potatoes. Only gave it 4 stars because I had to make some adjustments (as well as make up some quick chicken gravy to top it with, as my boyfriend won't eat it unless there's gravy!)Thanks for the quick and easy dinner!

Excellent recipe! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it, I definetly agree with the idea of some reviews of pouring just a little egg over the top so bread crumbs stick, and the tiny pad of butter added to each one made a fantastic addition. However, even without the butter the first time I made it, it was still an excellent dish. Thank you so much, this one is a definetly a keeper for the recipe book.

This was yummy and i got 5 stars from all 6 kids!  The only thing is that I dont think the cooking time was enough for me so I think more 45 min to an hour.  But like another user siad I used the honey mustard sauce from the Aussie Chicken recipe here and the kids just loved it!  As an Adult I would rather a nice cream sauce....Thanks

I just changed a couple of little things.  Instead of pounding the chicken, I just kind of butterflied the breasts, and folded them over the cheese and ham...and then toothpicked them at the seams.  I also brushed the breasts with butter before coating them with breadcrumbs.  They turned out just the teensiest bit dry, so I think next time I'll cover the pan with foil while baking.  I'm told they were excellent, though (I'm a vegetarian).  :-)

This is great! I make it for friends and family all the time and it's always a hit. I have used all sorts of cheeses as well, ranging from Cheddar to Gouda. They both work well.

This recipe is so simple and quick, that I wasn't expecting much from the results, but it turned out GREAT!  The chicken was moist & tender.  Thanks for sharing.  This would also be a great recipe for an Atkins dieter.

This was a simple and wonderfully delicious recipe! I put my chicken breasts in a zip lock bag and beat them with a meat tenderizing wooden "hammer" to make them thinner. I also used Italian bread crumbs (the only kind I buy). Scrumptous!!!

Nothing to scream about.  It was OK - kind of dry.  I doubt I'll make it again.

Really easy, great taste, moist chicken - I left off the cheese on top to conserve some calories and it was still great!  I'm not a big fan of swiss cheese but it was really good.  This recipe can easily be altered with the filling to suit personal taste.

My husband really loved it, but I found it was a little too meaty for me.  I like the suggestion of cutting it up and putting it in a salad.  I think I'll try that next time.   I'm adding an extra star to this!  I gave it another chance and another.  It's now in dinner rotation.  I just make sure to get the chicken very flat.  Also, I think it tastes even better as leftovers.

I loved this recipe, but made a few adjustments.  I pan fried them until lightly brown in oil, then baked them for aprox 20 minutes.  I tryed this recipe a 2nd time & for variation, I angle sliced it over a salad & topped it with the Honey Mustard sauce which I got from the "Aussie Chicken: recipe I found on this site.  They were both agreat hit!

Excellent just the way it is! Will definitely make again! Have now made this a second time. Hubby (who doesn't like chicken - go figure!) requested that I make it again - and told me that I can make it any time! Served it this time with frozen french cut green beens with hollandaise sauce - yummy and elegant supper for our anniversary!!

This was very good even to my 2 1/2 year old and he's such a finiky (sp?) eater.  I tried seasoning a little differently rather than just salt and pepper.  I lightly sprinkled Tony's on both sides and on one chicken breast, I used up some of my pepper jack cheese.  It was better than just swiss cheese.  My husband and I really loved it.  It's a keeper in my recipe box.

This was a great recipe - straightforward and easy to follow.  My only problem was getting enough breadcrumbs on the chicken without getting them all over the pan.  Everything tasted great and was a big hit!

Yum!  Made this for dinner tonight and the whole family loved it - even my 6 year old :)  This is a really simple, tasty recipe. I didn't have enough cheese to put on the top of all pieces, so some did and some didn't, but it didn't matter - both were great!  Also, I bought the thinly sliced chicken to save time as another rater suggested and it made the whole process that much easier!  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was a great recipe!  I made it for a large group and everyone loved it!!!  I did not mess with the recipe much...I substituted oregano for the salt and I used a healthy choice thin ham.  No need to make any sauce for it-it tastes plenty good!

Great recipe!!!  I use different cheeses for different taste.  We use swiss, havarti, provolone, cheddar etc.  If you need to pound the chicken and don't have a mallet, just place chicken in a zip lock bag, take a frying pan and hit the bag.  Works just as good as a mallet.  You can even use a rolling pin.  I don't recommend using string.  If you get the chicken thin enough the tooth picks should work.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe.

I made these for dinner the other night and they were wonderful!! I used crushed flavored stuffing instead of bread crumbs, and rolled the entire chicken in the crumbs.  I used cooking string instead of toothpicks to hold together. Also made the sauce with cream of mushroom soup, lite sour cream, and lemon, and it was wonderful! I put american cheese in some and mozzerella in others.

This was really good.  My husband has now declared this his favorite meal.  I used muenster cheese because we do not care for swiss.  I had to adjust the cooking time slightly, as my oven tends to run very hot.  I suggest using colored toothpicks, or toothpicks with ribbon on the end because once the chicken was cooked I lost a couple of them (much to the surprise of whoever was eating the chicken).  Overall, this was a very easy recipe and I'll definately make it again!

This was delicious and so fancy looking! Perfect when you want to impress someone. Someone I served it to actually thought I'd store bought them and then said they were MUCH better than store bought.  Family loved it!

so easy and so good. I did the provolone and thin sliced lunch ham. It worked well. I didn't have a chicken flattening tool so I used a soup can turned on it's side. it works as long as you keep the chicken in the plastic wrap. thaks for the recipie it's a keeper!

I made this for dinner for my parents and they RAVED about it.  Only thing I didn't personally care for was the breadcrumbs.  Also used mozarella instead of swiss, just not a fan.  Otherwise, PERFECTION.

thanks for the simple and nice recipe. i used turkey ham and shredded swiss cheese. and used egg white to seal everything together instead of using toothpick. also coated the chicken with eggwhite before sprinkling the crumbs.

Good! Easy. I did make a few changes, I rolled them in breadcrumbs (plain, didn't have the seasoned kind) after dipping them in egg, and did add a pat of butter on top. Very tender. A little bland, next time I will definitely make a sauce to go with it, though that could have been because of the plain breadcrumbs.

It was kind of hard to pound the chicken and get it rolled. Then, because I bought such big chicken breasts it was too much to eat when they cooked. Still really good though.

This was such an easy dinner, made from things I already had on hand and yet it looked and tasted like I went through a lot of fuss! Made the house smell wonderful - my family loved it! I will make this again when we have company over so I can spend less time in the kitchen.

Had dinner guest and they were so impressed. I used Shake'n'Bake for the outside breadcrumbs and the toothpick was giving me trouble so I tied them up with dental floss then cut it off right before serving. I will cook these again!!!

This is so good and the easiest fancy meal to prepare for guests. My husband and I both loved this just as the receipe calls for, but will try adding Dijon mustard as suggested by another reviewr just for a change of pace once in awhile. I made these ahead which is also a big bonus when fixing for company

Not the best. The chicken was not very flavorful. I thought that the ham and cheese would add a lot of flavor to the chicken. Not so much.  Edible, but not delicious. Very mundane. I dont know what to do to make this better. Maybe a sauce of some sort will help. I am in the minority here, I know, but I won't make this again.

Recipe was WONDERFUL.  I purchased a 3 lb bag of boneless/skinless breasts and used the whole bag.  Some rolls were larger than others but they all turned out moist cooking the same amount of time.  (Used 9 x 13 pan) I did add 10 min to the cooking time.  I also took the suggestion of others and spread mayo on the rolls prior to adding the bread crumbs.  I made a sauce of 1 can cream of celery soup and 3/4 cup sour cream. YUMMY!!  My husband and I fought over who got the leftovers today for lunch.  Will make again for sure.

Oh this was quick and easy to make and  so-o-o-o good!  I used turkey cutletts, but everything else was the same I assembled these in the morning, left them in the fridge and cooked them for dinner.  Next time I may use the mustard as someone else suggested and I might use a different cheese but I will definitly make this again...thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great. I never knew it was so easy to make this! I followed some of the other reviews and put butter on top five minutes before adding the cheese. My 2yr old loved it! I will try a different type of cheese next time, not that the swiss was bad!

This is perhaps my new favorite recipe!  It was SO good and easy to prepare!  I made one tiny change, which was rolling the chicken breasts in breadcrumbs before rolling up with the ham and cheese.  A definite keeper!

I pounded each breast thin with the bottom of my heaviest glass since my broken tenderizer/pounder has not been replaced yet. I then placed two slices of cheese next to the chicken since the breasts were rather large, then two slices of extremely thin ham, rolled up, sprinkled with Italian bread crumbs, salt  pepper and garlic powder. Did not add more cheese at the end. I served Garlic Green Beans with this. What is really nice about this dish is that it is fast for a weeknight family dinner but is company worthy at the same time.

This was so easy to make. Instead of using seasoned bread crumbs, I crushed up dry seasoned stuffing mix. It worked fine. Served with rice and steamed broccoli.

I give this a five star for its simplicity and at the same time it was very tasty. Instead of making honey mustard I made up some Bernaise Sauce using a package that you add milk and butter. It was a very nice touch. Following other's recommendations, I didn't bother with toothpicks and just laid them down on the seam. I sprayed the crumbs with butter spray after they were in the pan...don't know if that made a difference or not...I covered with foil for the first 1/2 of the baking time and added cheese the last 5 minutes.

I used peppered ham.  I did not roll the chicken up, I layed flat.  Also I used a combo of horsradish cheese and swiss.  Really good.

Very easy! I made it semi-low fat and took shortcuts by using Healthy Choice Ham and some low fat cheese. I'll definetly make this again! Meat pounder is definetly neccesary!

Mine came out a bit dry, but i may have baked them too long.  I served them with the Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce from this site and it was a delicious combination!  My hubby has been asking me to make chicken cordon bleu for quite some time and this combination got 2 thumbs up :)

Husband said this was good, but it took about an hour to cook. The recipe sounded dry so I made a sauce using cream of chicken soup, sauteed shallots, and sage. I poured it over the chicken, topped with the bread crumbs, then put cheese on top during the last 5 minutes.

To add more flavor to this recipe, beat one egg with about a tsp. dijon mustard.  Dip the rolled chicken breasts in the egg mixture before rolling in the breadcrumbs.

Tastes great! I actually used provolone instead of swiss and it still had a very nice taste.

This is a favorite at our house.  I use medium size breasts and pound them out, and sort of tuck in the sides as I roll.  Both of my kids love these, and it is probably one of my husbands favorite dishes.  It does need a sauce, and a very simple one is just to mix some mayo and mustard together.  Which might sound gross, but if you ever had the Malibu Chicken at Sizzlers restaurant (which was my favorite as a kid) then you know it tastes good, and goes perfect with this combo.

Delicious.  Modified it like so:  After rolling up and securing with toothpicks, rolled in 2 beaten eggs, then in cracker crumbs.  After putting in baking pan, sprayed nonstick spray over each breast.  Baked for 45 minutes.  Served with a honey mustard sauce:  Mixed 3/4 c mayo, 1/4 c mustard, 3/16 c honey, a couple dashes of worcestire sauce, and 1/3 grated onion.    YUMMY!!!

This recipe got rave reviews from my family.  They could not stop commenting on how good it was.
I used different types of cheese(provolone, swiss and monterey jack) to suit my family's different taste.  I also used the egg wash and crushed some 
Whole Wheat Ritz crackers. And I dotted them with butter and baked @ 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.  They came out PERFECT!!!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This dish was great!!!  So moist and tender. I used pancetta instead of regular ham...about 3 slices per chicken since it's so thin. I used provolone instead of swiss. I,like the other cooks used the cream of chix,sour cream and lemon recipe for the sauce..also dipped in egg wash then in ritz cracker crumbs.  I had to cook it 400 for 40 min...it came out perfect. Thanks

Made this for my husband's birthday, (its his fave dish) along with my inlaws!  Was told this was better than the way MOM makes it!  They loved the individual servings so that no one stole the other's ham.  Added Cream of Dijon Soup with 1/2 can of water to it to decrease the dryness.  Was excellent!  Was told to definitely make again by the family!

This recipe was wonderful!  I followed the advice of previous reviews and mixed dijon mustard and one tbsp of mayonnaise to smear on the inside of the chicken breasts before I added the ham and cheese.  I also followed the idea for the sauce.  I was out of sour cream so I used 1 can cream of celery soup and a big spoon of dijon mustard.  After wrapping the chicken I rolled it in the sauce and then the breadcrumbs.  It turned out tender and really tasty.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty good, considering I brushed on honey mustard marinade before I rolled and skewered everything together to bake.  I think the honey mustard brought out the flavor it would have needed had I not added it.  It would probably taste really good with a hollandaise sauce as well.

I didn't really like this recipe very much but my boyfried said it was "awesome" and ate the rest of mine!  i found it a little dry (i also think i put too much pepper on it - my own fault) I will make it again (for my boyfriend) but I think I will try mozarella cheese (more melty i think)

Very good recipe. The chicken came out moist and my husband liked it a lot.  Next time, I think I will leave out the bread crumbs, or maybe on sprinkle a little on top along with some salt and pepper.

This recipe is great.  It is the easiest and was a welcomed addition to my collection.  My 1 year old daughter even loved it!!  My husband thought it was delicious.  I get tired of making the same old thing and this helped to switch it up!  Three words Quick Easy Delicious.

This dish was great!  I rolled (instead of sprinkling) the chicken in the bread crumbs to coat completely.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I didn't have ham and swiss on hand so I used turkey lunch meat and cheddar.  My 9 year old son and my husband loved it!  It was too easy to make!  Thankyou!

Great tasting recipe and so easy!  I too used an egg wash and coated the breasts in seasoned bread crumbs.  I forgot to put the extra cheese on top and it was still good!  I will make this one again for sure.

I LOVED this recipe... I don't cook very often, and this was my first ever attempt at Chicken Cordon Bleu. It was so easy, and it came out looking and tasting great.  I will make this recipe often.

I loved this recipe the only thing I changed was to make an egg wash and then bread the whole breast instead of just sprinkling some crumbs on top.

My husband LOVED this.  His exact words were "This is the best chicken ever!"  He made me promise to make it again.  However, I wasn't taken with it for some reason.  I also tried the sauce Michelle suggested.  I thought this was easy and quick to make and it looked really gourmet.

This recipe was GREAT!!  My fiance and I were getting bored with my chicken recipe so I thought we'd try something different.  It was so easy to make but look like I spent lots of time on it.  You have to love that:) Definitely a make again and 2 thumbs up!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  My husband who does not like new things could not get enough and ended up sneaking out of bed at 3am to eat the leftovers.  I found him on the couch in front of the television with a sheepish grin on his face!  I have given this recipie to anyone who will listen!!  I don's like swiss cheese and I loved this dish!  Thank you so much for sharing!  

Sincerely,

This recipe was so good. I used healthy choice ham and a low-fat swiss cheese from my deli and it still came out great! My son(5yrs old)made a face when I put it down but after trying a bite scarfed the rest down. :) A terrific recipie and easy to convert to low-fat.

My husband made this for dinner, It was fabulous. He used Contadina three cheese bread crumbs. We will be having this again soon.And if you're from the Montana area you may want to try seasoning it with Alpine Touch in place of salt and pepper.

This was a simple recipe that was very good.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time, I will egg-wash and bread the chicken, rather than sprinkling with bread crumbs.  Overall, very good.

My husband is rather difficult to please.  He loved this and was amazed that it tasted so good!  He doesn't like to be the guinea pig for a new recipe but this one surprised him.  I used black forest ham and a lot more cheese that called for inside, so I skipped the layer on top.  Very easy and super tasty.

Excellent recipe. Definitly dip 'em in egg before rolling them in the bread crumbs. Have the deli at your local supermarket slice the ham real thin and the cheese and they will be much easier to roll. I used havarti cheese for those who don't like swiss.

You can have too much cheese on this so it may take a couple of times to get the amount correct.

As you roll the chicken I found it to save time by rolling the chicken into the breadcrumbs.  It seams to be less mess and more evenly spread onto the chicken.

Delicious!!  I had two really large chicken breasts, so I just split them down the middle and pounded them flat.  Then rolled them up and dipped them in egg and then bread crumbs.  It was very easy and very good - we also made the sauce that someone recommended in the comments (1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tbsp lemon juice) and it was fantastic.  Great recipe - thanks!!!

I made this for our potluck group of 12 and it was enjoyed by all.  Some of the chicken breasts were a bit large for a lady's appetite so they were shared leaving a couple extra for later!!!

What a wonderful recipe. Simple and delicious!  I did use a little olive oil to roll the chicken in after it was constructed and then lightly breaded them. Work out perfectly!
Thank you!

Came out really good and juicy.
 I used Garlic, Chili,  & Paprika powder.  And Himalayan Salt to season the breast, and breaded the entire breast. I also used mozzarella for my self and swiss cheese for my boyfriend, and covered the chicken while baking to keep it moist. Very hearty meal.

This recipe turned out really well the first time we made it. We pounded and layered the chicken with the ham and provolone, rolled and tied it, instead of using toothpicks, about three hours in advance.

 We followed some of the recommendations, such as rolling the chicken in melted butter and bread crumbs before baking. 

Delish! This is a definite keeper! The family loved it.

I make this but with a few changes: 
Butterfly the chicken breast, smear the inside with Dijon mustard, add your cheese and ham, then roll and place in your pan seam side down. Cover all of the chicken with Ranch dressing and sprinkle with crushed French's Fried Onions... Then bake. AMAZING & JUICY!

Recipe is EXTREMELY wrong as to the time to cook.  Our chicken was undercooked when it was in place for 40 minutes +.  I had to cook for another 10 minutes at 375 after the 40 minutes at 350 using this recipe + my own knowledge from cooking chicken.  Super easy to make and tastes great.

This recipe is truly the easiest way to make this dish. Even if you don’t have all the ingredients it calls for, you can substitute. And, all of the other reviews prove that you can add your own touch and not mess it up. I didn’t have sliced Swiss, but I did have sliced mozzarella and used that. I didn’t have bread crumbs, but I did have a box of shake ‘n bake (don’t judge me). It turned out delicious and I’ll definitely make it again.

I love this recipe, simple is best!  I flattened chicken thighs, added salt and pepper, Boars Head ham and Swiss, and rolled them in seasoned brown rice flour.  I sprayed the chicken with grape seed oil and air fried them.  I love it because it saves some fat, is a bit healthier, all while retaining that juicy inside and crispy crust.  I made garlic mashed potatoes and it was absolutely delicious!

I've made this one many times now, and it's delicious every time!  This last time I used frozen chicken breast.  I defrosted it in the microwave, then filleted it (since I wasn't sure how frozen it was inside). So then I had two pieces of chicken. 
 Then used a meat tenderizer to flatten each one a bit.  Seasoned each with salt and pepper, then added two layers of deli Swiss and honey ham (a slice of ham, then Swiss, then ham, then Swiss) to each.  Rolled them up and gently covered each with an egg wash (which also had salt and pepper).  Rolled each one in a pan of bread crumbs, then secured them with a couple toothpicks each.  I sprinkled a little more bread crumbs on top.  Then I put a couple pats of butter on each one.  Cooked uncovered at 350 for about 40 minutes.  Took it out and put a slice of Swiss cheese on the top of each one, then put it  back in the oven for another 5 mins.  It was cooked all the way through, really moist, and delicious!  I loved the extra slice of ham and Swiss inside.  I think I will have to remember to do that next time, too!  I tried something else new - I tried making the sauce of 1 can of cream of chicken soup and  1/2 cup of sour cream.  It was good, but I felt it was a little bland.  It needs some seasoning (but I'm not entirely sure what!).  My family seemed to enjoy the sauce, and everyone definitely enjoyed the chicken.  And I had just enough for a very yummy lunch today! ;)

This was a success at my house! I cooked it a little hotter and a little shorter (25 minutes at about 400) and it seemed to stay juicier than a few were mentioning. I did use too hard of a Swiss cheese, so next time I plan to use a softer Swiss and more ham. Also, the chicken was a little bland with just salt and pepper, so I plan to add a little of our own favorite seasoning on the next go around. Overall, easy to make and turned out well. Warms up great for good work lunch leftovers also.

I took the advice of others and put one side of the chicken breast in the egg wash and then laid the breast in the bread crumbs. I then put the ham and cheese and rolled while in the crumbs. I did not use tooth picks and put seam side down in the baking dish. I also put extra cheese in the breast and did not put any on top. I put little dabs of butter on the top right before putting in the oven.

I followed the suggestions of other members and dipped the pounded breast in egg wash and then in the bread crumbs. I also added a sliver of butter on the top while it baked. I made the traditional sauce by making a roux of two Tbs of butter and flour, 2C of milk, fancy mustard and Parmesan cheese to taste. I paired it with peas and covered them with the sauce as well. It came out restaurant quality!

We really liked this recipe. I made just a few changes which suited our family's tastes a bit more.  I won't drone on about the changes, but the main one was to season the pounded chicken breasts with garlic powder, paprika, parsley flakes, and used a shredded Italian blend cheese mixed with a couple of Tblsp. cream cheese to make a spread. Overall, it was quite tasty. We did not want any kind of sauce on it.

Dipped in egg wash before rolling in breadcrumbs and topped with dab of butter per some suggestions. I also added a little white wine to the bottom of the dish before baking. We loved it!

Followed it all the way and put on the plates for my Family and we ended up at Taco Casa for dinner.  Never again on this one. Chicken was dry.  Not enough sauce. Yes you can make extra sauce, but had I know in the first place it wouldn't be enough and that I would need more, I would have made more.  Chicken was way too dry for us.   Passing this one on.

I will definitely make again.  Super good.  I followed the top commenters suggestion and dipped the chicken in an eggwash then rolled the chicken up on a plate of breadcrumbs (panko) after laying the cheese and ham on there.  I also made the sauce.  Definitely a must.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 C of sour cream and 1/3 - 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Turned out awesome over a bed of jamsime rice!

Just made this. Very good! I used tips from others, dipped chicken in egg wash then laid it flat on a plate of bread crumbs. Placed the ham and cheese on top and rolled it up. The butter on top makes it that much better. My chicken breasts were large, I did pound them out and had two big breasts. I cooked them on 350 for 25 min and they were juicy and very flavorful. Super easy to make. Definitely adding this into my rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

Wasn’t as good as I was anticipating. Husband didn’t like it, but he’s picky about two different meats in the same dish. I should have tried provolone instead of the Swiss. Won’t be putting this one on my repeat list unfortunately.

This was the first time that I dared to make chicken cordon bleu. The recipe itself was easy but I used the sauce made with cream of chicken soup that someone had insisted would add to the dish. The chicken turned out pretty tasty but I used thin sliced black Forrest ham from the local deli and I didn’t particularly like the taste of this ham. Would use prosciutto if I make it again and will not use the sauce.

I made it mostly as the recipe except I made 6 breasts for our family. The chicken was moist & we absolutely loved it. I used graham cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs for just a tinge of sweetness. I use them in all my recipes that call for bread crumbs. I also rolled them in the crumbs after I rolled the breast & before I put the toothpicks in. Next time I may put in another slice of ham or cheese, or both. Overall very easy, yummy, & tasty!

Excellent meal. We made the sauce with cream of chicken sour cream and lemon juice suggested by another on the reviews. We also did the egg wash and extra breading.
Excellent meal.
Oh, we also did the higher temperature cooking for shorter time...that worked well, the chicken was def not dry cooking it that way.
Easy recipe, 5 star eating

I use a little garlic and onion powder with the seasoning and I have also used a little italian blend seasoning.  I floured prepared breast lightly, dip in egg and buttermilk and roll again in flour OR crumbs (double dip) I then fry them, just like frying chicken.  You may have a little chesse run out the sides but it's ok.  These will melt in your mouth.  Give me fried chicken any way except with a waffle.  I also use toothpicks to help hold together especially when I make smaller ones. (lot more work but the grandkids love them.)

Loved it! Used the egg wash as one reviewer recommended. Timing was accurate. You could cut each portion in half for smaller eaters, especially if the chicken breast’s are large.

Love this. Couldn't be simpler. I split the chicken breasts lengthwise so they are thinner, sometimes don't have to pound them and sometimes do so minimally. We love the flavor, the ease of preparing, and the fact that the chicken stays so moist.
I can't recall if I got the idea from other reviewers or other recipes, but often will brush a thin layer of dijon mustard inside the  chicken breast for more flavor too. 
I made a bunch and transported them to my mom's, cooked them once there while visiting with all.

This is very much like the recipe I use, but am more generous on the ham and cheese.  Other white  cheeses work as well!  This is a family favorite.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I changed was using an egg wash with the bread crumbs. I used a left over piece of ham steak. It was great. I will add this to my regular meal line up.

Outstanding Dish!  Very simple to make.  the only prep was beating down the chicken breast.  Really enjoyed making this.  I made a few adjustments.  Used 2 slices of cooked Ham, 1 slice of Swiss Cheese, rolled the rolled up prepared breast in Egg Beaters and then in the Bread Crumbs.  Also put a 1/2 slice of Swiss Cheese on top for 5 minutes, after cooking @ 350 for 35 minutes.

Also made Sauce.  1 can Cream of Chicken Soup, 1/2 cup of Sour Cream and 1 TLB of Lemon Juice. Mixed and Heated for the last 5 minutes.  Used as a dipping sauce.

Thank You for an excellent recipe!

super easy and fun to make.  I sliced open the breast into a larger fillet and flattened it easily inside a ziplock bag, hitting it with a rolling pin.  It doesn't take much force.  Then placed three Land o Lake deli ham slices and sliced up a a few pieces of cheese from a block of swiss cheese and rolled it up, securing with some tooth picks.  I used Panko gluten free breading and sprinkled Weber garlic and her seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder and garlic salt  and it smells amazing... It's not even cooked yet!  I've always wanted to make this and I finally have.  I will post picture if I can figure this out.  lol

It was my first time using a meat tenderizer on chicken and I didn’t quite get the pieces thin enough, but the recipe turned out great. I just turned the oven up to 400 degrees instead of 350, and I still needed to add some time to cook the chicken. It turned out really well and my wife and kids said that they really liked it. It probably could’ve used a sauce but my wife said to not change a thing, so; there you have it! I guess it’s a hit, just the way that it is. A very nice recipe and the video tutorial was extremely helpful as well. Thank you.

I followed the other reviewer's suggestions for dipping in egg, then bread crumbs.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders and paprika.  We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.

I thought this would be a little bland, so I made a "spread" of dijon mustard and ricotta, and smeared it on the chicken before laying the ham and cheese on top and rolling up. I also used a baked chicken trick and brushed mayo over the rolls, then patted the crumbs on top and sides. Followed the recipe otherwise, and it turned out very good.

I also followed others suggestions including egg wash. I used Progresso garlic and herb bread crumbs. I butterflied the chicken breasts instead of pounding them, and used a pre-cooked ham steak. I used Campbell's cream of bacon soup and the 1/2 cup of sour cream for the sauce. It came out excellent. Very easy to make.

This was really tasty and easy to make!  I added Parmesan cheese in the bread crumb mixture along with some garlic powder and pepper.  I made four as it’s just my husband and I so then we had the other two the following day just to save some time. I used regular sized breasts and pounded the heck out of them and rolled them up with cheese from the pre-sliced cheese packages and Black Forest ham that I use for my hubbies lunch (sorry honey)!  I rolled them up from the fat end first and ended up only using one toothpick. Don’t forget to tell people they are there,  oopsie!  Place them in the appropriate sized pan and for easier clean up I first lined it with parchment paper. Brush the tops with whatever you fancy to make the crumbs stick. I used a beaten egg but I’m sure oil or milk will do. Cover the chicken with the crumbs and pop into the oven. I didn’t have a problem with 400 degrees for 25 minutes especially seeing as you put the cheese on at the end for another five minutes. Really enjoyed this recipe and was not as fiddley as I thought it would be. Will definitely make this again.

I made it according to the recipe, with the exception of adding the egg wash. It was great. The chicken doesn’t need a cream sauce, not to say it wouldn’t add anything, but it’s great without it. I meant to add the pat of butter but forgot. That tells me it’s not terribly necessary. This recipe is definitely worth your time and is quite easy.

I made it exactly like the recipe states. It was good.. I thought it was a bit bland. I made it minus the ham and put in a canned whole Ortega chili in each one. That was delicious. I get it that’s not Cordon Blue but if you want to switch it up. It was really tasty!!

I tried it and it was fantastic!, I added steamed spinach on top of cheese before rolling and dipped the chicken in egg wash before  sprinkling bread crumbs, also made cream of broccoli sauce to go with it. Delicious!

I just made a couple of changes. I dipped the chicken in an egg wash then  in the bread crumbs, before I put the ham & cheese. Once I had them placed in the baking dish, I melted 1/2 stick of butter & poured it over the top of each -- gave it a golden color and kept it moist....

My guys loved it.   I used ham and provolone.   I also didn't bother with the sauce (that many reviewers suggested) and instead just put a pat of butter on top (like others suggested) and then a light sprinkling of cheese near the end.   Great easy recipe!

This was good, but some reviews suggested a sauce with cream of chicken soup & sour cream.  I tried that & it was awful- threw it out.   Try the honey mustard dressing- much better!

Made this last night for dinner.  It was wonderful.  Only change I made was to use panko crumbs and not cornflakes.  Made the sauce as well, and it was delicious with both the chicken and the side of asparagus!  Will definitely make again!

This was a hit but I had to make some changes. Saw a lot of comments about it being dry and that's probably because it bakes for too long. After sprinkling the breadcrumbs on it and rolling it around the coat, I sear it in a pan with butter on all four sides, no time table needed, just sear until it's golden brown, preferably on an oven safe pan because I then pop it in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. If you want a sauce to go with it, I personally recommend a white wine sauce which is more or less just a white wine reduction with veloute sauce. I served it with gratin dauphinoise but it would go nice with veggies if you decide to do the sauce.

I made a few changes but came out great. I followed some other reviews and did and egg wash and used a plate for the bread crumbs so it would be on the whole piece of chicken. I also added paprika to the bread crumbs and S&P. My husband can’t stop raving about it. It came out SO GOOD. I also made a sauce. Can of cream of chicken, 1/2 cup sour cream, a little lemon, salt pepper and paprika. Threw it in a sauce pan and warned it up, super simple. I made green beans as well and my husband LOVED them. Mixed hericot verts (green beans) with salt, pepper, olive oil, paprika and probably about a 1/2 TBS of Dijon mustard. Threw them on a jelly roll pan and cooked them in the oven with the chicken. I did about 400 degrees for 20

I like the simplicity and ease of this recipe! Very quick to make and you'll feel fancy eating it. Make sure to buy toothpicks! The ingredient list doesn't show what cooking utensils you will have to use for the recipe and you may not have those in your kitchen already.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  
I substituted panko for the bread crumbs and seasoned it with garlic powder, minced onion, basil, and black pepper, and coated the whole roll, not just the top.  Great weeknight dinner!

Really a nice and easy recipe, the flavor was just as good as if I had spent more time and money. Had all the ingredients, in the past I put a smear of Poupon Mustard when making, that was the only deviation. Will do this one for company.

Great, easy recipe, my husband loved it!  All I did differently was put shredded mozzarella on top for the last 5 minutes instead of more swiss. It helped add a little more variety to the flavor. I will absolutely make this again.

This was delicious!  I did dip the chicken in egg wash then laid it on a plate of bread crumbs to roll. Added the pat of butter.  I made the sauce with cream of mushroom soup and sour cream.  I didn't like it but hubby did. Next time I'll try the mustard sauce.  We eat a lot of chicken, this is a nice change of pace. Thank you for the recipe...I will make it again

I used pork instead of chicken on accident... whoops...
I did not bread the meat so it would go along with my boyfriend's keto diet. I used a pork chop (this is what happens when you have a vegetarian cook you meat) and cut it in half lengthways and folded it out into a flat oval instead of pounding it. Baked for 25 minutes at 350, then put a slice of cheese on top and put it in for another 2 minutes. It turned out great!

This came out great! I made very few changes. The chicken breasts I bought were huge so when I rolled them, they were quite big. I cooked them at 375 for almost an hour and they were perfect. The only other change was that I didn't add salt, I added instead 1& 1/2 teaspoons of chicken seasoning with the bread crumbs. Will definitely make again! Great recipe. Thank you.

This is in my favorites. I make it all the time. However, I do add some spicy brown mustard after I place the ham on the chicken and then add the cheese. I also sometimes substitute prosciutto for the ham. Kids like it and in fact, my daughter made it for her college room mates.

Based on availability & preverences, A few changes were made.   I used mozzarella for the cheese & pastrami for the meat.  Everyone loved it. It was great.  I will definately make it again.

Easy and quick. I think Swiss can be overpowering so I put Swiss on the inside and provolone on top. That was a mistake more Swiss would be ok.. It took a lot longer to cook like 1 hour to get to 160° it was good not speck tackler.

Finally found a chicken recipe my picky hubby enjoys. Beef eater is not a chicken fan, but this one was a home run. I followed advice of others. Dipped in egg wash first. And made the cream of chicken, sour cream & lemon juice sauce!  Very tasty!  For a two of them, I used Canadian Bacon instead of ham inside.  That was very good and I might do that instead next time.  It usually depends what I have on hand.  Great recipe!

These were delicious! I used a little bit of cheddar cheese inside of them and somebody more on the top. Make sure you pound them out thin or else they are hard to roll out.

The chicken breasts I used were too large. They were difficult to flatten even with a mallet. I had better luck just pressing with my hands, but only got them down to about 1/2 inch, so I had to cook an additional 20 minutes. 
I used gluten-free bread crumbs from Walmart ( I have a child who is gluten-intolerant), but they did not brown at all. I wonder if some time under the broiler would improve this?

I make this a bit different. I do the egg wash, then spread a TBS of Honey Mustard mixed with Mayo on top of the ham slice before I add the Swiss cheese. I roll it up then pat on Panko breadcrumbs all over it that I have added some garlic powder, onion powder and Parmesan cheese to. I drizzle melted butter on them before baking. They are really awesome this way. Crispy, buttery, garlicky goodness. YUM!

Except for dipping the rolled chicken into butter before adding the seasoned crumbs, I followed the recipe exactly.  The end product turned out to be very dry, bland, and almost tasteless.  This recipe cried out for more seasoning and some kind of sauce.  I definitely will not be making it again.

Super easy, and delicious!  (Also note, I am a BEGINNER in the kitchen) 
I also dipped in egg wash before the bread crumbs, used provolone rather than swiss and baked for 25 min (total) @ 400 degrees.  I used the sauce from the other reviews, and enjoyed it both with and without the sauce!  Thanks for the recipe!

I actually made this with turkey breast, and therefore I was a bit worried about the comments of the chicken being dry. To avoid this I used a bit of butter as my first layer, then added the ham and cheese. So it was kind of turkey cordon blue Kiev. :)
When I took it out at the end to add the cheese I put some butter on top first, then added the cheese. 
The result was really outstanding, I can highly recommend it!

The first time I made it, I had to cook it longer, so the next time I made it, I upped the temperature to 375 and cooked for 40 minutes, turned out perfect. Also, instead of toothpicks, I used dried spaghetti noodles, they work perfect and you don't have to remove and throw away, they cook with the chicken:)

I made this tonight. I  didn't  have  the  right  ingredients; I used cheddar  instead  of  swiss. However, the  recipe  was really  easy  to  put together  and it tasted  good  with my unconventional  ingredients. I  will  definitely  be  making  this again  with swiss cheese. I  put some  frozen  spinach  in the  middle  just to add some unavoidable  leafy greens.

Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would make Chicken Cordon Bleu.  Maybe it's because of the elegant French name, but I assumed it would be something that only a high-end chef would attempt.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a very simple recipe, and is sure to impress anyone.  For the ham, I got a few thick slices of the best ham in the deli department.  Absolutely wonderful.

This was very easy to make with little mess and delicious. It also requires very few ingredients. I did not have enough Swiss cheese to put any on top so I used some parmesan and a little fresh rosemary which added to the flavor. This will become a regular favorite meal for our home.

This is great.  Even with large breasts only bake for 35 minutes and make sure to serve with sauce. 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 sour cream and 1Tbs. lemon juice. I also used homemade seasoned breadcrumbs and added a pad of butter to the top of each. Great with Monterrey jack cheese and Canadian bacon.

This was delicious, just kind of a pain to make (for my future reference!).  I had huge breasts to work with and had a hard time getting them flat. It was also difficult getting them to roll up - but I did. Sorta.  I used an egg wash, Panko crumbs and a pat of butter on top of each breast. Then I covered them loosely with aluminum foil to lock in the juices. I baked them for an hour and fifteen minutes.  They came out beautifully and everyone raved at the presentation and the flavor.  However, I'll probably only make this a couple of times a year. Served with baked potatoes and broccoli with cheese sauce.

This is so easy and fast. No browning, sauce making or other time-consuming steps. I cut the rolled breasts in half before inserting the wooden sticks (I had long ones which my hubby cut in half for me...much sturdier than the lowly tooth pick). I then left the sticks in place when I served them and the guests had no trouble eating around them and the rolls didn't fall apart. Six breasts fed eight people with three halves left over. Will be making this often.

I always make any recipe I try as written the first time, before making any changes. This was very good as written so will make it again. I think I will try some of the suggestions of other reviewers like the egg rinse before the bread crumbs and a pat of butter on top of the chicken breast before baking. I don't understand how some people found this dry...mine were very moist so don't feel I need any extra sauce like some do. I served this with Pasta Pomodoro from this site and they went very well together.

This turned out very good, flavor-wise.  The chicken breasts that I purchased were very thick, so pounding them to 1/4" thick would have taken more time and effort than I had available, so they ended up between 1/3 and 1/2 inch thick instead.  After rolling with the ham and cheese and securing with a toothpick, I rolled them in an egg wash followed by seasoned bread crumbs, rather than just sprinkling the bread crumbs on top.  This seemed to help immensely in providing a fully coated end result.The presentation would have been better if the chicken had been pounded to 1/4" thickness, but it di

This recipe is soooo easy and so good! I kinda did a frugal college student version of this because I don't have the one that the recipe says but it still worked fine. Although it wouldn't taste the same as the original, it's still good. I used American instead of swiss cheese because I already have one that I use for sandwich. Just don't use the Kraft singles, it doesn't melt well. Then I used ham sandwich, also worked out just fine. For chicken, I don't have the hammer thing or a rolling pin so I just laid the chicken down the counter with foil underneath and used my knuckles and a mug to press it down. I dipped the chicken in egg wash before putting bread crumbs. I wrapped the chicken individually just to keep the melted cheese in there and it's easier to bring to school. Then baked it at 400 for 30 mins.

I will NOT make it again, it took over an hour to cook, and tasted nasty when it finally came out of the oven! I was VERY disappointed...

I dipped the chicken in melted butter and then used crushed cornflakes instead of bread crumbs and it turns out amazing.

Let me start off by saying that I do not care for Chicken Cordon Bleu at all. This recipe just showed me though that I was wrong. It was a huge success for my husband and I. My daughter doesn't care for chicken, so she just picked the ham and cheese out and ate those. I will be making this dish for my in laws soon and will be trying out some of the recommendations from other reviewers.

Very nice, but a bit too much chicken and not enough cordon bleu.  Nex time, will flatten the chicken a bit more, and/or add more ham and swiss.

This is fabulous.  I add in about 3 spears of asparagus before rolling, then roll the entire chicken in egg, then panko breadcrumbs.  Brown in butter in heavy cast iron pan and then just bake for about 30 minutes. Yummy.

This turned out wonderfully.
I put my chicken on a raised wired rack set in a lined cookie sheet and used crushed plain corn flakes in place of the bread crumbs (didn't have the bread crumbs on hand). The wired rack allowed the chicken to get "crispy" texture without over cooking.
Kids and husband asked why I didn't make more lol.

I know it is annoying when the reviewer changes the recipe but I can't take credit for replacing the two ingredients I didn't have when I was on a boat trip! So just replace the ham with salami and the white wine with carmenere and the men at your table will love it's heartiness! Egg potato salad goes perfectly!

Surprisingly, since cooking is not my expertise, this turned out AMAZING!!!  Super easy, and quick. Did not change a thing, made as directed. Would probably add a bit more spice next time but it was SUPER!!!

Really good and easy to make. I used a rolling pin to pound the meat.

I did coat the whole chicken piece in breading, but it still needed something else...maybe paprika next time? 

I served these with twice baked potatoes.

This was everything I wanted it to be and more. I used to eat this when I lived in Amsterdam all the time, and this definitely recreated that feeling for me. The cook time was perfect since I used thin sliced chicken breast so I didn't have to do any pounding and it was perfect. Also, I did dip in egg before breading on both sides. So, so good. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Great recipe - doesn't need a sauce as it is rich enough. Minor edit: dip rolled up chicken breast in egg before sprinkling on breadcrumbs.

I tweaked the recipe a little. I used whole chicken breasts, cut pockets into the sides, and stuffed them with the ham and cheese. Then I coated them in eggs and bread crumbs and fried them in olive oil. I dabbled off the extra oil and melted an extra slice of swiss cheese on top. My family absolutely loved them! I will definitely make them again.

I was making this for a gluten free friend, and forgot, and put the breadcrumbs on it! But her hubby loved both servings, it was a hit, overall, and I will make it again, just leave off the bread crumbs. Very easy and tasty.

I Love this recipe!! It is simple and delicious!!!  I changed it by using my own home made shake and bake breading instead of bread crumbs and will add 1/2 t. butter and sour cream to center of each and top with a butter/lemon sauce.   YUMMMMM!

I prepared the chicken cordon bleu today for my Valentine (2/14/17). It was a hit, so I will be definitely making it again! It was so simple to do, but also very tasty and that makes it a win-win in my book. I used Progressive Panko bread crumbs, and added an extra slice of cheese. My husband still thinks it needed more cheese though, so that is a simple fix for next time.

Turned out great. My husband said it would have been perfect if I would have added way more ham vs just one slice. I will try that next time

Make sure you use deli sized swiss cheese.  I used square and it definitely isn't enough.  A sauce would be great as I thought it was pretty dry, but I think that's my fault. I was afraid the chicken wouldn't be done so I baked for 35 minutes.  Should've done 30.

Made as instructed and made a perfect meal.  It was great, though tonight I'm going to add some seasoning to the chicken.  Just wondering if I should experiment since my family loved it the first time!

I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception. Our chicken breasts were enormous, so I split two horizontally to get four breasts.  The recipe was easy, fast and delicious.

I made this exactly as written. It didn't  brown  muchat all. A bit dry and quite bland.  The time suggestions are low. Of the 20 or so times I have made some version or another of chicken cordon bleu it has never taken me ten minutes to assemble, and this was no exception. It takes me at least five minutes per breast to flatten to an adequate thinness to roll and still it is never thin enough to fit more ham and cheese, which is what I think makes a better cordon bleu. So, really prep time was more like 30-45 minutes.

My family loved it! Although I made some changes. I did not tendrize the chicken. Instead, I made shallow criss-cross cuts on the chicken fillet. I added some turmeric and chicken powder in the rub. For the filling, I spread a layer of basil pesto and a slice of swiss cheese, dipped in scrambled eggs, and the rolled in bread crumbs. I also individually wrapped them with foil. After 35 mins of baking, I removed the foil and bake for additional 30-35 mins or until golden brown. The chicken was so moist! It was both tasty and fragrant. I will surely make some more next time.

I made this and made a few changes that were great! First I made a mixture of Dijon mustard and white wine and brushed a little on the rolls of chicken before I added the bread crumbs. Then I added a little bit of paprika to the breading. Because most of my family is doing the low carb diet, I did 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 almond flour. This dish was incredible! EVERYONE at the table asked to for me to make it again next week! Yay!

I took the advice of past reviewers and laid the pounded out chicken breast in the egg.  Then I laid it, egg side down, on the bread crumbs. Then I built it, Swiss then ham, rolled it and baked it per the directions. I also made the sauce to go along with it. It was the best chicken cor don blu I have ever had.

Soaked the flattened chicken in buttermilk for an hour, then prepared according to the recipe.  Ended up cooking for an additional 10 min.  Turned out awesome.

The chicken turned out great.  I used Provolone cheese instead of swiss.   I made the sauce that others suggested to go with it and didn't like it.  It doesn't need it.  Great recipe!

The only change I made was to dip the stuffed chicken breasts in egg whites and completely coated them in the bread crumbs. They were lightly crunchy and tasted fantastic! This will definitely be a regular meal for us and for company as well.

My wife and I loved it. This was very easy to make. The thing you have to watch is how big your chicken breasts are. I had some very large ones and it made for a very large Cordon Bleu.

Yummy! Egg wash, rolled in crumbs, pat or two of butter on each. Basted with buttery juices near the end, and made the suggested gravy (cream of chix  soup, lemon juice and sour cream). Everyone loved it!

I also make this dish, but, I wrap a piece of bacon around the chicken breast, roll it in egg wash, then in either breadcrumbs, or in "shake and bake". A really easy dish to make, and delicious too!! Thanks for sharing!

No changes - We thought it was very good.  My husband usually does the cooking, but since he was under the weather, i volunteered to cook.  Sometimes mine does not come out like I expect, but this more than met expectations.  Not looking for any more recipes, I'm afraid I will have to take my old cooking job back.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because I used basically the same ingredients, but put them together a little differently. Instead of pounding the chicken breasts to flatten them, I cut a pocket in the side of each the length of the breast.  I cut the Swiss slices in half and put them into the pocket so they would cover the length of the pocket. Then I put pieces of ham into the pocket. I folded the top of the pocket over the bottom, dipped each in an egg mix, and then in the bread crumbs. Then I baked them in a Reynolds wrap lined baking pan with the folded pocket down in the NuWave oven.  These came out great, and the leftovers froze beautifully for another meal.

Unlike everyone else, I made it exactly as the recipe called for. My only suggestion from my experience, is to reduce the amount of cook time. I think it was probably a little overdone, which probably  resulted in some of the cheese leaking out of the meat rollup.  It is definitely a recipe that a man would like. The sauce is hearty and tasty  and this is an easy basic recipe. It goes well with a  whole-grain or spinach  pasta if you use the sauce on it.

I was able to buy chicken breast already pounded down thin from our local butcher so I used them. I sprayed my dish with pam and put salt and pepper on both sides of the chicken. I rolled up the chicken with a full slice of honey ham and a full slice of swiss cheese. I held it together with a toothpick. I mixed a can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 can of milk and a 1/2 cup (give or take) I usually don't measure, just put in what I think of sour cream. Poured that on the top of the chicken. I put plain panko bread crumbs on top and baked covered in oven for 45 minutes. I then uncovered and baked for another 5 minutes. It turned out great. Mouth watering, nothing left good.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

This was a quick recipe to make. Didn't take much time at all to put it together. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have always enjoyed Chicken Cordon Bleu and this was a very easy version.  I pretty much just followed the recipe as written.
I have a far more complicated recipe, far more time consuming and quite honestly, not that much better that this one.  It may never come out of my recipe box again.

It was amazing! I ended up boiling the frozen chicken breast I had first. Then I put it together with toothpicks then laid it in my crock pot for 3 -4 hours. It was soooo good! Even a lil crunchy on the outside. 
Can't wait to make it again !

It was good. I'm not familiar with meat-pounding and I think my breasts were too thick. The part that had the meat and cheese was very good! But the thick chicken breast part was a little dry.

Great recipe.  Incorporated some suggestions i.e.:  egg wash, cooked at higher temp, used provolone cheese and made the sauce.  Loved by all.  Definitely going to be cooking this again and again.

Added garlic powder to the spice mix. I took the advice of others and dipped the rolled chicken in egg wash and then rolled them in my panco crumbs. After placing the rolls in my  dish  I pored the rest of the crumbs over the chicken. Mine baked for 40 minsand were nlt dried out. Must be my oven. I wll make this again for sure.

It tasted awesome, instead of adding cheese on the top I added home made bread crumbs and it tasted very crunchy with each bite along with the cheese oozing out. Good Recipe!!!

Very good.  I used butter and Panko to coat each.  Baked 30 minutes then added an extra piece of swiss on top.  Great for leftovers as well. Will make again. Might try some spinach and provolone next time.

This looked like a very easy recipe to follow and after reading some of the reviews, I went ahead and tried it. Because I am basically a lazy cook, instead of pounding the breasts I butterflied them and placed the ham and cheese inside. I took a few people's advice and used an egg wash and added a small pat of butter on top. I used GF seasoned panko breadcrumbs. They turned out delicious, not dry at all. Served them on a bed of wild and brown rice and didn't use any sauce or gravy. I would definitely make this again.

Great last minute chicken dish.  My husband loved it and had the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Next time I think I'll put a little more cheese on it at the end, I like mine very cheesy. A great dish served with a vegetable and chicken pilaf

I first didn't cut my chicken breasts in half. I cut a small hole in the center of the side and sliced the inter part of the breast to only  fillet it so the cheese would hold in better. (Imagine a ballon, the area you put your mouth on is smaller then the ballon itself.) I then rolled the ham like a taco, around the cheese and stuffed it into the small hole of the breast. I dipped the chicken in an egg wash before breading it. In the breading, I added garlic spices, salt, pepper, paprika and Kraft™  parmesan cheese. I used tooth picks after to help hold the filling in place. I then placed the chicken with the opening of the stuffing sitting  upright. I cook chicken enough know when it done, it all depends on the thickness.  Once it's been made a few times, it becomes easier and easier.

Sometimes I follow this recipe, but for a change I use goat cheese and add a large tablespoon of basil pesto.

So easy to start with a chicken breast and get creative from there. I keep frozen chicken breast in the freezer and after thawing 30 min. Can begin to create.

This recipe was delicious.  The only thing I changed was to smear the chicken with mayonnaise before adding the bread crumbs.  This added moistness to the chicken.

I cut large breasts in half lengthwise so they were already pretty thin before I pounded them out.  I rolled them up and dipped the rolls in egg and then covered the entire chicken roll in the bread crumbs instead of just sprinkling the tops.  
I also took other reviewers advice and made a sauce out of a can of cream of chicken soup, about half a cup of sour cream and about a tablespoon of lemon juice and adjusted to my taste.   This was much simpler than I anticipated and tasted great!

Love  this recipe... super easy for a weekday and everyone loved it.   The only substitution  i made was seasoning up a row of smashed ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs.  - I used chachere's to taste.  This will  definitely be added to our meal rotation.

I rub a little butter on the outside of the chicken breadcrumbs will still stick but the butter will also help keep chicken moist because of the egg wash will dry out as well i figured with butter i can oven bake at 325 or 300 low and slow without burning or drying out and there is a white horseradish and garlic sauce i make to drizzle over after baking...but awesome dish one of my faves

This is one of my favorite recipies to make. I put a little bit of dijon mustard on the chicken before I added the ham or swiss. I dip the chicken in some egg with some pepper or other seasoning so the bread crumbs stick to the chicken better.

This recipe is amazing. Simple to make doesn't take a lot of prep time. I did make 2 slight changes because of my family's preferences. I used mozzarella cheese as we are not too keen on Swiss and I used crushed corn flakes for the breading, gives it a slightly sweet taste and is great for anyone who's gluten sensitive. Thank you to whoever posted this recipe my daughter gets so excited when she knows we are having this for dinner.

I followed the instructions and i thought it turned out really good. Im going to add more cheese next time but besides that i cooked the chicken 25 minutes and it was perfect. I had thin chicken breasts to begin with though. I will be making it again.

I made this first for myself to see how it would come out. WOW
it was awesome. I made it just as directed and had great results. When it came my turn to make Sunday dinner for the family, It was a hit. The next week I had to show my daughter-in-law how to make it. This one is a keeper.

Just made this tonight and it was to die for. I made it exactly as written and I'm so glad I did! I read reviews and was going to add a little honey mustard before I rolled it up, but I forgot ....so I just dipped it in honey mustard when I was eating it. Delicious!  Make this! You won't be let down

I made some modifications. I dipped chicken in beaten eggs and instead of breadcrumbs I used cashews ground into a mealy flour and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I used kerrygold ballyshanon cheese (grass fed). It came out great and would definitely make it again. I served it with sauted kale and red beans.

I found this recipe when searching for new dish inspirations for my boyfriend's lunchbox, hence didn't have a taste on the first try. Later in the day I received my boyfriend's text message at work and told me how much he LOVE it and urge me to made again during weekend. I did and yum...it is absolutely delicious!

I made some changes base on personal preference - I use the boneless chicken thigh instead of breast, and marinade the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder for 10 mins before wrapping. I dip the meat  with egg wash then coat with bread crumb. Definitely will be one of the signature dishes in the household!

Made as directed.  Wasn't really thrilled with the outcome.  Nothing like the Cordon Blue I've had in the restaurants.  Don't think I'll make again.  At least with this recipe.

My family and I loved this recipe! We will be making this more often! I had huge chicken breast so I added two slices of ham and two slices of swiss cheese! Just perfect! Also I made the sauce and that was great too! One can of cream of chicken and a half cup of sour cream.

Great recipe. I changed it just slightly by dredging the chicken in flour seasoned with paprika, salt, and pepper. I also put a little Dijon mustard on the inside for moisture and flavor. This tuned out great and my husband absolutely loved it!

I used panco mixed with bread crumbs and added garlic powder and onion powder to the mixture.  Instead of ham and Swiss I used prosciutto and smoked Gouda! Wow! One of the best dishes I've tried in here!

This was so delicious!  I usually do not like chicken breasts but by pounding them thin tenderized the meat.  I took 4 tbsp of melted butter as one person suggested and brushed them on top of each breast then added the bread crumbs.  I had a little left over so I just drizzled the butter on top and baked.    I will no doubt make again!

Mine took 55 minutes at 350 (stove is about 18 months old), which didn't bode well for dinner since I counted on the 35 mins stated in the recipe and planned my side-dishes accordingly. Hot chicken = lukewarm sides. The dish itself was good, though; aside from the timing, I made this recipe as stated. Thank you for sharing.

I didn't have the ham steaks I thought I did so I subbed bacon. As some of the other reviews stated, the chicken was a teensy bit dry, but the bacon juices saved it! I think I'll try an egg wash next time, then bake covered with foil until the last couple minutes under the broiler to crisp.

Good recipe.  I've used this with ham and prosciutto.  Both are good.  I also use an egg wash sometimes prior to breading.  Adds some extra crunch.

Hi! I am taking a class where we have to create themed lunches and the theme I chose is France. I was thinking about making this recipe and I was wondering if it would be okay to hold the chicken on a buffet table. If not if you have any suggestions for me.

I eliminated the cheese on top and used an oil spray on top of the chicken for the panko crumbs to adhere. It was a very tasty and easy dish to make.

It was very tender but lacking in flavor. Needed some seasoning on the chicken.

Very easy, and very delicious meal. I made half with Swiss cheese, and the other half with Colby Jack cheese for the picky eaters in my house. It was a hit both ways.

This was so so good. I made a cream sauce made with a mixture of cream cheese, chicken bullion , 1/2 and 1/2 milk, and a cream powder. I didn't  do measurement on the sauce, i just made it. I also added bacon to the swiss cheese and ham. I could not get enough raves about this dish. I will definitely be making over and over again to please guest and family~!!

This turned out great! Have made a few times now. I did edit a few things though: I doubled up on cheese inside the chicken inside of putting a slice on top. Also for the breading, I breaded them like my family always does: flour, egg, then the breadcrumbs (thicker, tastier breading). Also don't forget to take the toothpicks out as I did after my first attempt ;)

This was fantastic. Didn't know how such a simple version would turn out but if you use enough swiss cheese, it will be just as gooey as using cream of "" soup

This is a favorite in our house now.  Something that takes this from good to OMG awesome is the choice of the ham used.  I particularly like the rosemary crusted ham I can get cut at the deli.  Sure, sliced pre-packaged ham will do in a pinch, but deli ham makes this amazing!

Great base! I used a bit if light mayo on the inside and outside of the chicken before breading it, which kept it moist. I also made a bit of honey mustard glaze to pour on once I added the cheese topping at the end. Fantastic!

This is my second time making this recipe.  I made the breading out of crushed cornflakes mixed with enough melted butter to make clump and stick to the chicken.  I used a light sprinkle of lowry's seasoned salt in place of the salt and pepper and also a bit in the cornflake mix.  The first time, I used a thin sliced black forest ham.  The second time, I used a thicker sliced ham off the bone with the hard edges trimmed off.  The second one was much better.  My family loved it!

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5  because I changed the recipe a little.  I followed the advice of others and dipped the rolled chicken in an egg wash and then coated it in breadcrumbs.  The addition of the egg wash just made the breadcrumbs stick better and be a little crunchier.  I otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Prosciutto is the traditional ham used for this so I used that and it was really good!

Came out great. Very important to get large Chicken breasts and pound them out. They took 3 toothpicks each. I used an egg wash and coated in bread crumbs. I also used a sauce that was amazing. 2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour in a pan mix together over low heat, then add 1 cup milk 2 chicken bouillon cubes 1 tablespoon dry sherry 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce makes a tangy creamy sauce that compliments it perfectly.

I made the breast/ham/cheese rolls and froze them a few weeks ago (didn't sprinkle with salt and pepper). I took them out of the freezer a couple of days ahead of time to thaw completely, sprinkled each roll with salt and pepper , then breaded them, dipping each in egg first, and topped each with a small pat of butter and baked. 
It was great! We had this not-so-quick and somewhatfancty entree on a Monday night after a busy workday in a flash! I totally recommend making several extra rolls (unbreaded) and freezing them for a quick and delicious entree on even the busiest nights!

Excellent dish that took hardly any effort at all. The chicken came out very juicy and tender. I would recommend the sauce that I read as a recommendation by someone in the comments(1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream, and 1 tbsp of lemon juice)which really adds to the flavor. However I have made it without the sauce on top and it comes out delicious still. Will for sure make this again! Very Filling and delicious.

Great recipe -- I've tried it with Havarti cheese and it works very well also.  I would suggest butterflying the chicken before pounding it out though.

With practice,folding the chicken and adding perfect amount of ham n cheese will come. Recipe itself was awesome, no changes made. I have subbed the breadcrumb with a fine Italian breadcrumb and plain Panko mixture, just for a bit more texture and slight crunch.

Followed advice and dipped in egg wash before bread crumbs. Otherwise exactly the same. Yummy!

I've been making this for years with a few modifications.  Make your own bread crumbs by crushing garlic/butter croutons.  I add a slice of provolone in the middle and top with a half slice five minutes before it's done.  I've found that I get crispier coating by placing cooling racks in the baking dish and putting the chicken on top.  It does lessen the baking time.  This never misses with family!

I have 2 kids and not so good at cooking, I love things with a quick easy prep! This was awesome I made it and my husband and brother went back for seconds! This never happens my husband usually chokes down my food so I don't feel bad and never wants more haha! I did mix a little egg and milk together and rolled the chicken in it before putting breadcrumbs on (i just figured it would stick better) I think next time I'm going to make it with pepper jack cheese instead of swiss :)

I find this recipe easier to make and more fit by substituting bread crumbs and salt/pepper with low sodium teriyaki sauce. I soak and marinade the chicken breast for an hour then proceed with the baking. The chicken comes out juicier and tastier, IMO.

This is one of my family's favorites. However, I use gouda cheese instead of Swiss and deli black forest ham instead of regular. It's amazing with these two tweaks. Otherwise, I make it as is. And it's still very good as is, even without my tweaks.

Delicious, with a few modifications. I used prosciutto and provolone, and after adding toothpick, dipped in a seasoned flour mixture, then egg, then rolled in seasoned breadcrumbs. I topped each finished piece with a pat of butter before popping in the oven. They were juicy and delicious at 35 minutes and needed no sauce. My husband raved about this dish!

Instead of the chicken breasts, I used the chicken tenders. They were smaller but less expensive to make. Everyone of our family of 7 had plenty to eat.

Very easy to make!  I love chicken cordon bleu, but didn't have the ingredients.  I substituted with honey smoked turkey breast, Colby jack cheese, and crushed stuffing mix, then added a little butter in the baking pan to avoid dryness.  Big hit, will be making it again.

This makes such a beautiful presentation and it’s so easy too.  I used an Italian cheese mixture instead of the Swiss cheese only because my husband doesn’t like the Swiss.  It worked out very well.

I made this for my parents anniversary and they totally loved it! I used corn flake bread crumbs which worked wonderfully, the chicken was tender and juicy and the great thing about this is that you can switch it up and use other types of meat and cheese to roll it up in! Thank you! :-)

Wonderful! Beautiful presentation on rice & much easier than I thought it would be to make...company worthy for sure. Not many baked boneless chicken dishes come out great in my oven, this was perfect though (I'm used to marinating & grilling chicken). My husband hates ham so I marinated large strips of red bell pepper in a balsamic vinaigrette I made for a few hours, rolled that with provolone slices & fresh chopped parsley w/ the chicken. I liked the suggestions to put the crumbs on a plate & roll that way. Thanks.

Great recipe, but, instead of breadcrumbs, I put French' French Fried Onions in a ziplock bag and pounded it to breadcrumbs. I froze 2 and had 2 for dinner. This is a keeper and very quick to make

First off, I substituted the ham with some Johnsonville Mild Italian sausage. We enjoyed the added zing. It was a bit more difficult to wrap them up using the sausage vs. ham, tho. It took longer for the chicken to get 165 degrees so next time I think I would slice my chicken breasts thinner to help make the rolling up easier and the cooking faster. I pounded the heck out of mine and they they were still too thick. I forgot to make the sauce others recommend.  I think it would be even better with the mushroom sauce.

Really yummy, easy to prep and we have delish leftovers to look forward to!  This one is definitely a keeper!  I also think it will refrigerate well if prepped in advance, if you don't add the crumbs until you're about to put it in the oven. Or, bake and freeze for later!

Would have been nice to have a link to a sauce for it that didn't need heavy cream. Turned out really good and was super easy.

This was incredibly easy to make and tasted great. I took others' advice and dipped each breast in an egg mix, then in bread crumbs (added dried parsley to the bread crumbs). Baked uncovered for 35 minutes at 350. However, the breasts were pretty big and I was worried they weren't fully cooked so I increased the temp to 385 and cooked for another 15 minutes. Perfect! Served with a tossed salad and - voilà!  - a nice dinner made easy!

Ok so rather than using swiss I did what any parent would do. I improvised. I would suggest using the cheese you have available (in access if using leseer of the stonger cheeses), and making sure to roll the chicken very tight around the ham and cheese you use. If any of you are asking why the man of the house is cooking and working two jobs. Don't bother. Pleases just give me new cooking ideas. I need help coming up with new ideas.

I made this recipe tonight, I had Honey Baked Ham left over from Christmas dinner so I decided to use Honey Baked Ham, it was OK, but the Ham was so flavorful you couldn't taste the chicken. I will try this again with regular ham because it was so simple and the presentation is great. I think this makes a great choice for dinner guests. Also, I will put use egg on the outside before the bread crumbs to make it have more taste on the outside. I also don't care for Swiss Cheese, so I used provolone which was fine.

This is my new Christmas Day main dish! I doubled it to serve 8 of us, and did add the cream of chicken soup/sour cream sauce, and baked it for an hour ( while I waited for the guests to all arrive...) With the sauce it was not dry at all, and really tender. Everyone loved it. With the sauce I dont think you could really over cook it, so I think it would hold really well. I served the sauce over rice and wanted to lick my plate!

My family loves when I make this recipe. I do tweak it a bit. Instead of ham I use Prosciutto. I also do what others on here do. I dip each rolled piece in melted butter and roll in panko bread crumbs. I also use the larger breasts. It is to die for and is so easy.

Recipe was good, did take tips from other commentators, didn't really dig the "cream of chicken/sour cream/lemon juice" sauce tho. All together, great meal- make sure to eat it fresh from the oven- Swiss cheese is best freshly melted.

I loved it. I took the advice of the reviews and did an egg wash. I added cayenne pepper and Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture because I had non-seasoned crumbs. I like heat so I put a lot of cayenne pepper. And of course the salt and pepper so it had a lot of kick to it. Other than that, I used the recipe. Great recipe and it was on the easy side. My boyfriend loved it. I used the cream of chicken, sour cream and lemon juice as a sauce like someone recommended. Once again I added cayenne pepper to the sauce and onion salt. I served it with rice and steamed broccoli.

I made this for dinner & my family (including my in-laws) absolutely loved it!!!!!! I followed the recipe AS IS & it was perfect!! Even my 12 yr old son, who tends to despise ham, devoured it!!!! Served it with chicken rice pilaf & fresh rosemary olive oil Italian bread. Definitely a keeper to be made over & over again! Our taste buds thank you!! :-)

I usually love chicken cordon bleu, but this did not taste right for some reason. It tasted sweet to me, but maybe that's because I don't really care for Swiss cheese. My boyfriend loved that it was on the sweeter side, but it was a bit off putting for me. I didn't use honey ham either. I also dipped the chicken in egg before breading and I used a small bit of butter on top while they baked. I will most definitely be trying this again with another kind of cheese.

Thanks for a real bell ringer! I made a few revisions you may like to try:
I substituted bruschetta for ham, and provolone cheese for swiss.  To ensure that chicken was moist, after rolling, I covered it in Hellman's mayonnaise then coated the rolled up breast in Shar's gluten free bread crumbs! Thanks for a real bell ringer!

Amazing recipe!!!!!  I add a little Montreal Chicken Seasoning to the side of the chicken that will be inside w/the ham and cheese.  After rolled and tooth-picked, I roll the chicken in seasoned breadcumbs instead of just sprinkling.  Family favorite!!!!

This recipe was fairly simple and the flavors rich. I used left over ham from a New Year's dinner. This made it taste even better because it was not the usual thinly sliced lunch meat most Cordon Bleu recipes use.

I had never made this before, and I absolutely loved it!  My boyfriend went nuts for it-he liked that it wasn't heavily breaded like he had been used to in the past.  The chicken turned out really moist and was really good with rice.

Great, easy recipe!  I used provolone cheese and prosciutto di parma.  I dipped the chicken in egg and then coated with panko bread crumbs (mixed with salt, pepper, and thyme).  Didn't come out well-breaded but I actually preferred it.  There was enough  moisture and flavor that I didn't regret not adding a sauce.  My fiance's feedback: "I think this is what I want for my birthday dinner."

I served this on a bed of white rice, which complimented the taste.  I made the mistake of using sandwich ham... don't do that! The sauce was delicious.  Next time I will use some good ham and I bet it will be much better.

This was excellent as is, the only thing I done differant was I used deli ham, about 4 slices, and cut my breasts in half except for about 1/2", then folded the top back and pounded out to about 1/4" thk. using wax paper, doesn't tear as easy as saran wrap. I used sandwich swiss instead of deli cheese. Great recipe thank you.

I have made this recipe multiple times and it has been moist and very delicious. When I make this though, I usually end up cutting each in half, so that it is thinner, this cuts down on the amount you have pound the chicken and saves money.

Great dinner. Really impresses! Use thick slices of quality cheese to get it perfect.

I substituted pepper jack cheese for the Swiss - it's amazing! It adds a nice kick and great flavor to the whole thing!

I have tweaked this recipe to get a more flavorful meal. First I used butter crackers for the coating instead of bread crumbs and I added 1 capful of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb Seasoning to the cracker crumbs. I also dipped chicken in egg was first. And instead of Swiss, I used Extra Sharp white Cheddar..made them phenomenal!! Try it you will not be sorry!

Came out super yummy! I used plain breadcrumbs and added my own seasoning. I added some basil, garlic, italian seasoning, and a pinch of lemon pepper.

This recipe is just okay, but it's certainly not worth the trouble it is to prepare (i.e. dipping, rolling, securing to make sure it doesn't come apart).

Absolutely delicious and simple to make. I will be making this again very soon. My entire family loved it. The only change I might make next time is skipping the sauce. The chicken was so moist it really wasn't necessary.

YUM!  This is the first review I have ever wrote, even took a picture and posted it.  I doubled the cheese and ham.  I dipped the chicken into egg before the bread crumbs (I used Panko).  I also made the sauce to go over the chicken.  (cream of chicken, 1/2 C sour cream and some lemon juice).  Delish!  Will make again.

This was a hit with my husband. He is not a lover of chicken breast and he really enjoyed this dish. I used cinnamon crackers instead of bread crumbs for extra crust and follow some of the suggestions to put a little mustard on the chicken prior to rolling. I baked in the toaster oven at 150 for 20 mins. We will be having this again very soon!!!!

Made exactly like the recipe. It was moist and flavorful. Had a problem with the cheese leaking out. You have to use very large breasts to roll well and keep cheese and ham inside. Would make again. "Sauce" consisting of canned soup and sour cream was nasty. Do not recommend.

Very good and very easy! To keep it moist, I brushed the chicken with mayonaise before adding the breadcrumbs, and I made a honey mustard sauce for dipping. You could also drizzle the sauce on the chicken. I served this with a side and salad but it is very filling, so next time just a salad.

This chicken was awesome!  I read some of the reviews before and decided to brush some melted butter on the chicken before putting the ham and cheese on (I also used provolone cheese)  I then brushed some more butter on the outside of the chicken and then rolled in Italian panko breadcrumbs.  Instead of the suggested Cream of Chicken as sauce we dipped in Honey Musterd Dipping sauce, will make again very soon!

Outstanding recipe.  The chicken was nice and moist, which I've found to be a problem with other recipes I tried.  One addition I made was I added a packet of Good Seasons Cheese Garlic.  It added a nice extra flavored and really complimented the other ingredients.

A classic and easy to make dish!  You can add many different types of ingredients inside the chicken.  Tonight I am using fresh spinach, Swiss cheese, and bacon.

This was fabulous - very easy and tasted great! We had purchased a ham steak for another dinner and then my husband asked if we could use it for cordon bleu instead. I tried to horizontally cut the steak into thinner slices, which "sort of" worked and made it a little harder to roll than deli slices would have been, so that meant we had a more robust combination of ham vs. chicken flavor and it was excellent.

We loved this recipe!! So super easy. I didn't have bread crumbs in he pantry so I used crispy french frie onions and crumbled them up. I prepped and cooked the chicken as suggested and cooked for 25 minutes, then i topped with plenty of french onion crumbs and cooked another 10 minutes. Then topped with cheese and cooked another 5 minutes. I made an mixed greens salad with sauteed zucchini sides. Yummy Yummy!!!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I didn't have any bread crumbs onhand, so making some added a little time to my prep, but it was well worth it.  The chicken breasts rolled easier for me when I rolled it wrong side out, then coated them with bread crumbs. Delicious!

Excellent recipe! The only thing I changed was added 2x the ham and cheese on the inside, but I kept just a half slice on the top. Easy to put together and tastes amazing! Will definitely be making this more often and great for cooking for guests.

I made this two nights ago. It definitely was delicious. I used provolone because I don't like swiss. Really the only thing i did different was I dipped the breasts , then layed flat on the bread crumbs, put the filling and rolled it from there. I also needed to cook it for a little longer than it says here. And I didn't make the sauce, it was full of flavor already.

Sooo simple and turned out great! i used swiss string cheese for the filling, used 2 slices of ham and added a slice of provolone on top of the chicken 15 minutes before the end of baking. I made a sauce from cream of chicken, lots of milk (to thin it out), garlic seasoning, red pepper flakes, black pepper & lemon juice. came out great!!!! a lot better than I had anticipated! thanks for sharing=)

This recipe was excellent!  The flavour was great and the chicken was very moist.  I added two slices of cheese and ham instead of one because I like lots of filling.  Thanks!

Put a light layer of Dijon mustard before rolling up, gave it extra zing! Quick and easy, prep and walk away dinner.

4.5*** Excellent. i rinsed the cutlets in lemon juice then i dipped in egg and breaded the entire cutlet before adding ham and cheese. i used boars head ham and mozzarella because i didn't have swiss. drizzled olive oil over the top instead of butter. Cooked covered at 350 for 40 min. Uncovered sprinkled some more cheese and broiled for 2 min. Served with garlic-spinach and white rice. Very tasty. the chicken was very juicy.

This was really good and simpler to make than I thought. I was very intimidated to make this dish because I'm somewhat of a rookie in the kitchen.  I had the darndest time trying to get the things to roll and stay together and had to use 3-5 toothpicks each.  I followed the recipe for the most part but did add some crisp bacon in with the ham and cheese and used a can of cream of chicken thinned with milk as a sauce to drizzle over the chicken. It came out perfect! My picky 4 year old ate this so I am happy.  I will make this again in the future.

This was awesome!  I beat the chicken down, then placed ham and cheese on top of the chicken breast and rolled it up.  I only had to put about 3 toothpicks in.  The key is to beat the chicken down pretty well, because it makes it super easy to roll!  Then I dredged the chicken in eggs, and rolled it in breadcrubs (Italian Flavored).  I browned the chicken rolls in olive oil for a few minutes, then put them in the oven with that yummy cream of mushroom sour cream and lemon juice!! Baked at 400 for 25 minutes, as suggested!!  OMG it was awesome!! No leftovers!! Everyone loved it....it was a BIG hit!!

These were great. I did make the cream sauce recommended by other posters but I didnt care for that. The chicken however was perfect. I used provolone as that is all I had. I will be making this again soon. Thanks for the recipe

So good. I following this recipe almost exactly and my family loved it.  I used our lefterover Easter ham and made a sauce one reviewer suggested (1 can cream of chicken, 1 cup sour cream and 1 T lemon juice) as a dipping sauce.  The chicken was good (and moist) with and without the sauce.  Very easy recipe.  Thanks!

Great recipe. I used vanilla almond cereal crushed up instead of bread crumbs and it turned out AMAZING. I also used a maple ham that added to the flavor of this dish.   I served it in a mornay sauce since I hate mushrooms. Magnificent! Will make this one again!

I came up with a recipe similar to this after eating veal cordon bleu in Europe.... and I love it!!!! I add a bit of Slap Your Mama to the chicken after rolling and before rolling in bread crumbs. I also make a Bearnaise sauce to pour over the chicken. Absolutely wonderful!!!

I'm not a big fan of cordon bleu's but my husband loves them so we made these last night and they were wonderful! It was hard to get the chicken thin enough and rolled but once that was done it was easy and so yummy.

Five stars even though I didn't pound the meat thin and roll it. I just sliced the breast open and filled it with cheese and ham. Once I get something to flatten the meat with, I think this will be delicious as my only gripe was that he breast was too thick.

I made this using ham that I'd baked a few days before. Boy was it easy! I've never attempted anything like this before and I was really impressed. It was easy and quick. The flavor was really cool and the meat was moist. I will definitely make this again! My husband loved it.

This was great. I also added the breadcrumbs during the entire rolling process. Really a great chicken dish. My husband was crazy over it. He literally could not stop talking about it. I'll definately have to make this again soon!

Great comfort food.  I took the recommendations of everyone and dipped the chicken in egg.  I also increased the temperature to 400 for 25 minutes to crisp it up, and it was perfect.

This was really delicious.  I had been nervous to try a cordon bleu because I thought I wouldn't get the wrap right and it would end up leaked all over the oven, but it came out great.  I especially love the sauce.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good, I'm not sure why previous reviewers felt they needed an egg wash.  I made it exactly as written and it was so moist and juicy!  I didn't see any reviews where it was tried both ways and the egg wash made a difference so I don't see it as necessary.  I used packaged ham and packaged swiss cheese... I saw some reviewers used provolone but I find that cheese very bland so not sure why they changed it.  It was delicious and so filling!  My man and I shared one breast and we are so full.  Thank you for sharing this recipe:)

This really is a fantastic recipe! Whatever you do, don't try and bread it like you would schnitzel, using flour before the egg and breading! Disaster! I did however find using havarti instead of the less flavourful cheeses much nicer, and easier on the pocket because you can use less. Thank you for this recipe!!! Life saver!

excellent new dish to add to the repetoire. Only deviated from the recipe by first dipping the chicken in egg and instead of bread crumbs I used spiced panko crumbs. To suit our spicy tastes, I added paprika, red pepper flake, montreal chicken seasoning, cayenne and garlic powder to the panko. Also put a little bit of Tapatio (Mexican hot sauce, tastes good with everything!) in the egg for a lil kick! No swiss on hand, so I used Monterey Jack. Was SPECTACULAR!!! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Very good and easy...I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom, some lemon juice, lite sour cream, paprika, and honey dijon mustard for the sauce over top. Would make it over and over :)

Delicious and oh so easy! I was doing the low-carb thing so I did not put breadcrumbs on it and it was still delicious! Also I only had provolone so used it instead of swiss and will the next time too it was so good!

I had been looking for a good Cordon Bleu recipe for quite awhile when I found this.  I used chicken tenderloins and seasoned them with Weber kickin chicken.  I then put them in an egg wash, followed by Parmesan bread crumbs. I used brown sugar ham and swiss cheese.  My husband loved it and was already talking about making it again.

Used shredded mozzarella since that was all I had on hand and smoked black forest ham from the gourmet deli counter. Like others, I dipped in egg and rolled in bread crumbs before baked. Just 1 egg is enough, 2 was a little too much.

I made this last night and my boyfriend said it was the best meal he's had in a long time.  I made the honey mustard from the Aussie Chicken recipe that's on this site. I drizzled it over the top of the chicken and also served some on the side.  I prepared it ahead of time and when I got done with classes all I had to do was pop it in the oven. So easy and absolutely delicious!

Very good and easy to make! Some of my chicken pieces were too thick so I cut them and stuffed them with ham and swiss instead of rolling.

I'm not a huge fan of chicken cordon bleu, but I know that my husband's family is so I made it for them.  The recipe is a great base, but I did what other posters suggested.  I also added bacon on the inside for more flavor.  I made the dressing to be one can of cream of chicken soup with 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  I also added some Italian seasoning to the chicken before I rolled it up.  It was a great hit with the in-laws and the husband.  I kept a little extra dressing on the side, heated up, and they used it if desired (some did, some didn't).  I'll definitely make it again, but likely in a situation like that- making for the in laws.  Wasn't my personal favorite.

I only gave this a 4/5 stars because it needed sauce on it. Gravy is not right. Maybe some type of cheese sauce. Really I hate chicken without sauce, but this without sacue was still a 4/5.

Great recipe. I made a sauce to top it with (1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, a "good" dash of cayenne pepper, dash of salt, garlic powder, black pepper, onion powder, and 1 tsp of horseradish).

This was my 16 year old son's first meal to cook for the family!  He followed the directions exactly and used a few of the suggestions from the reviews.  We used swiss, and virginia deli ham, and a light coating of egg brushed on it.  We used the sauce that another view mentioned, cream of chicken soup and 1 cup of sour cream.  Make sure to add the sour cream after the soup has been heated thru.  This was excellent!He was very proud of himself!

Never before has my husband raved about my cooking as much as he did when I made this last night.  We both loved it!  My variations were slight - I put a thin layer of dijon mustard on each piece of chicken, then covered each side in italian bread crumbs before rolling with the ham and swiss.  As recommended by other reviewers, I also put a pat of butter on each piece of rolled chicken before cooking.  SOOOOOO good!

This was great! The flavors combined beautifully and it was very easy to make. My girlfriend loved it and I would definitely make it again. I read the reviews beforehand and used the suggestions for serving it over rice with cream of chicken sauce. Delicious! I also brushed on the egg wash to help the bread crumbs stick. It was a bit difficult to get the chicken breast as thin as I wanted but next time I think I'll just slice the breast in half and then pound it. Thank you Kiersten!

This was wonderful! I did the increased cooking temp, as mentioned in previous ratings, and added the pinch of butter on top of each roll. I also prepared the sauce made with the cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and lemon juice (as mentioned in a previous review). My husband loved it! I used the Boar's head Maple Honey Glazed ham from Publix, sliced thick. I had no problems rolling the chicken up after pounding it. Thanks for sharing this simple but delightful recipe!

I thought this was just ok, even though my family liked it. I thought it was too dry. I made the sauce people added to their reviews here, and I thought that was pretty gross. I wanted a sauce without a lot of heavy cream etc. I guess you have to use the cream to get a good tasting sauce. I don't think I'd make this again.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe because I was able to make it my own. I used pepperjack cheese and seasoned the bread crumbs and chicken. It was easy and delicious. My husband and son loved how juicy it was. I baked at 400 for 25 minutes. I am definitley going to be making this again.

Great recipe!  I like it as is, and with the egg wash and drizzle of butter, added Italian spices and paprika to regular breadcrumbs.  Fantastic both ways!  Remember if you are using cooked ham or deli sliced ham it's very salty and probably any extra salt is unnecessary.  Thanks a bunch!  It's in my recipe box as a regular now.  Very tasty.  I like the simplicity of this recipe as compared to others I have seen.  Good for even weeknight dinners.

So easy and delicious! I used an egg wash and rolled the chicken in bread crumbs, used Boars Head deli Ham and Boars Head swiss and rolled it up. The sauce (Crm of Chix soup with sour cream and fresh squeezed lemon juice) made it perfect! Will definitely make again and again.

I absolutly loved this recipe it tasted so good I put my own spen on this recipe. I'm not a big fan of ham so I desided to do something a little different I replaced the ham with bacon. I put about five slices of bacon on my George Forman grill and cooked them i replaced the salt for seasoning salt. It was great my husband loved it so i think this will be served in my house at least once a month also. This was quick and easy i would suggest anyone to try it. I give this five stars. Mrs. Treats

Okay I have had 2 chicken cordon bleu recipes on this site and both are YUMMY!  The other you must saute which gives it a nice crisp texture. However, this recipe falls under Quick and Easy; only requires the oven and for the section it falls under Q&E I give it a 5! I butterflied the chicken to put the ham and swiss inside. Dipped in butter and rolled in seasoned bread crumbs.  Also poured 1/4 cup of white wine in the bottom of the pan to keep moist. As for the sauce I cheated and used a Knorr's Hollandaise Sauce and poured over at the end.

This was SO great! I love this recipe. Just make sure to flatten the chicken pretty thin.  Other wise you get too much chicken and too little cheese/ham flavor.  thanks!

I was totally shocked that I was able to pull this off considering I am fairly new at cooking out of the box. My boyfriend loved this and has already requested I make it later in the week.  I would however add more cheese and ham in the chicken and did so myself.  It was harder to roll but I toothpicked them tight.  I will make it again.

I did this exactly as is says, but I made a nice Bechamel Sauce over it. GREAT! Not the healthiest way to make it but a lot of room for substitutes which still would come out good. I made it with mashed potatoes on the side.

This recipe was easy and very good.  I do agree that the breadcrumbs could use some butter, and the reviewers who posted the sauce recipe are definitely onto something (wish I'd read about it before I made it!).  Overall though, it was a hit and I'll definitely make it again.

My 9 yr old helped me make this today. He says "It was the best thing he ever tasted!" His favorite part was the breading. My husband loved it too. I followed some of the suggestions and used egg before using the Panko coating. I used 2 slices of ham and 2 slices of swiss each. It was a little difficult rolling it, but it managed to stay rolled w/the toothpicks. I also put a slice of butter on top of each piece. I made the cream of chicken/sour cream/lemon sauce. It was wonderful. We're definitely going to make this again. Thank you.

Great recipe, and easy to make. This is the first time I've made this and they turned out wonderful. I followed the advice of others and coated chicken in egg wash before rolling in breadcrumbs, then added a pat of butter on top of breast before baking.

I enjoyed the tips given by other users of this recipe. Instead of a chicken breast which is challenging to flatten and role, I used turkey breast cutlets. They were so easy to use.

This was pretty good, I made the recipe as is.  The only thing I would change is the bread crumbs next time I think I will use the good old egg, flour, bread crumbs for breading and then roll them up and cook in a pan on the stove.  I think they would taste better.  Although as is this was very yummy I didn't like how crumbly the bread crumbs were, we like more of a tastey breading.

It was great!  It was the first time I've ever attempted to cook a real (as in basically from scratch) dinner, and I found it to be very easy!!! It was so delicious!  Both my parents and my boyfriend were amazed with how well it turned out.  And for those people who aren't adventurous enough to make changes to the recipe...have no worries! I made the chicken EXACTLY as posted, and it was still great!

I made this recipe, it was awseome I just changed the order. I got the brad crumbs ready. I mixed an egg in the bowl. Then I cut the chicken almost in half. I rolled two peices of ham with two peices of swiss cheeze and rolled. I then placed the roll inside the chicken. I dipped the chicken in the egg. Then I dipped in the breadcrumbs to completely cover both sides of the chicken.Then I put 1/4 butter on each breast. I placed the chicken in the pan and baked in the oven for 40 min. at 250 degrees. I made bowtie pasta with tomatoe sauce. Mixed the sauce with pasta and layed the chicken on top.

I dipped the chicken roll in egg to help the breadcrumbs stick. The sauce idea from another reviewer of cream of chicken soup and sour cream with a tablespoon of lemon juice finished it off. We were very happy with the results.

Soooo easy!  I used turkey breasts (scallopinied) and had just enough prosciutto on hand to substitute the chicken and the ham.  Very yummy.

I followed the recipe except I used Meunster cheese (that is what was in the house) and I used Turkey Ham (as I don't eat pork) and it was delicious.
Took someone's suggestion to put a pat of butter on each roll when baking.
My Husband said he could eat this every night!
Thank you!

Very easy and tasteful recipe. I used a mallet and made the breasts as thin as possible. I followed the recipe exactly except I used turkey ham instead of regular and coated the rolled chicken in eggwash before rolling in the bread crumbs. Thank you!

Excellent recipe.  I used Prosciutto ham and egg as the gluing agent (instead of butter).  Turned out major success.  My guests all liked it.

This is a very easy, simple to follow recipe. The only reason I did not rate it as a 5 star recipe was because I thought it lacked just a little bit of flavor. So what I did was add the white wine gravy from the "Chicken Cordon Bleu II" recipe on this site. However, since I avoided that whole recipe because of the high fat, I made a few adjustments which are as follows: I used 1 tbsp of butter, melted in a skillet, added 1 crushed chicken bouillon cube, 1/2 cup white cooking wine, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, 1/4 cup milk, (or just 1/2 cup whipping cream if you dont want both). Let simmer and whisked off and on for about 10 minutes. Let stand in warm skillet until thickened. Salt and pepper to taste. VERY GOOD on this already good Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe. Have already made twice in the past 2 weeks just like this. Goes great w/ mashed potatoes. =D

Oh, YUM!  This was excellent!  The kids were not too sure at first, but one bite and they loved it!  I dipped the chicken in egg and Italian breadcrumbs first, rolled them with the Swiss & ham, sprinkled a little garlic powder on them, and then drizzled some margarine over the top.  So, so good!!!!

I really liked this recipe because it was simple. My husband liked it as well. I did make chicken gravy to add to it but my husband ate it without the gravy and still liked it. I'll use this recipe again.

This was SO easy to make.  Instead of pounding out the chicken breasts, I just sliced them in half horizontally.  I didn't roll them in any breadcrumbs, though, but like another poster, i shook some over the top once they were in the glass pan.  I also didn't make the sauce because I didn't have the ingredients.  Maybe next time because there'll definitely be a next time!  (My husband loved these.)

This couldn't be any easier!  I bought some pre-"flattened" chicken breasts from the grocery store so the prep time was all of 5 minutes.  I served with some honey dijon mustard and broccoli on the side, and it was a hit.  It looked so classy, but it was oh so simple.  Thanks!

Very easy and very good!!  I can make this one in a hurry on a weeknight.  I didn't need all the sauce it called for.  I halved it and still had to much.  But we only dipped it in the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious! I made it mostly as the recipe calls for. Since I'm lazy, I cut the chicken breasts in half rather than pound them out. I used leftover ham rather than deli sliced ham and wrapped the Swiss cheese around it before putting it the middle of the chicken. Also, don't forget the Swiss cheese on top at the end since it gives the top a good flavor.

This was excellent!  I dipped the chicken breasts in melted butter (I Can't Believe it's Not Butter) and then dredged in the bread crumbs before placing in the baking dish. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I love this recipe, but I put the rolled chicken w/ ham and swiss in eggs, then breadcrumbs and then I fried it instead of  baking.  My husband hates chicken, but loves when I make this.

I made this very simple recipe with the potato rounds from the suggestion of another reviewer for my parents and brother. Everyone raved about the chicken. It was so juicy and flavorful, my dad couldn't stop exclaiming about it!

Really, really good. Followed the same advice of using the Aussie Chicken sauce, which my mother LOVED. I also dipped the chicken in egg before putting on breadcrumbs. Also- bacon & mushrooms in the middle were great :)

This is a good, simple recipe. I've made this a half dozen times or so, and dinner is always greeted with a "yum" when this is on the menu.

I am not a very experienced cook and have had some bad experiences with chicken in the past, but i found this to be a very delicious meal. I takes a while but is fairly simple. This recipe got excellent reviews from everyone who tried it too.

Had unexpected company for dinner the night I made these, and they were a hit! Dipped the rolled chicken breast in honey mustard, placed in pan, and then added the bread crumbs.  Baked at 400 for 20 minutes, then added extra cheese and cooked for another 5 minutes.  The honey mustard made a nice little bit of sauce in the pan, which I poured over the chicken after plating it.  Wonderful recipe!

Made this last night - followed the recipe to the "T".  Thought it was very good.  I have to say I was a little skeptical - because there was "sauce".  But it really came out very good.

This recipe is pretty easy to make. It was very good; however, make sure you do not overcook it because it will come out very dry.

I love how easy this is.  I have been using this recipe for several years now (the printed copy I have is dated 28 Oct 2000).  Be sure to use very thinly sliced cheese and prosciutto (Italian ham).  The prosciutto is quite salty, so be sure to omit the salt earlier in the recipe.

Need to cook about 45-50 minutes if chicken is thicker.

I didnt have a beater to beat the chicken so it was a little bit thicker than usual.

This was super quick and easy to make.  I dipped the chicken in milk before coating with bread crumbs after reading all the comments that something was needed to help them stick better.  Milk is a much healthier option than butter as others used.  My husband loved it!

I made this last night and my husband absolutely loved it. I even forgot to put the extra cheese on top of the chicken and it was still awesome. Will definitely be making this one again. It was also very quick and easy to prepare.

This recipe is very easy and fast to prepare, holds together really well and looks great. I only had plain bread crumbs (not seasoned), so I just crushed up some ceasar salad croutons and they worked great. I think this would taste even better (5 stars) with a smear of a honey mustard-type sauce in the center.

This was not a good recipe. I never leave bad ratings but for this one I had to. The chicken was very hard to pound out and it never got thin enough. I cooked it just like the recipe said and it just was bland. I am sorry for the bad rating. But I won't be making this again.

My husband and 5 year old said this was the best dinner they've ever had.  I baked it for about 45 minutes and didn't add the extra cheese slice on top (I forgot!), still very moist and delicious.

Wonderful! I used pepper jack cheese instead of swiss because my daughter is the pickiest creature ever born. She loved it! The pepper jack cheese gave it a great zip! Will definately be making this often! YUMMY!

This is a fantastically easy recipe.  I've looked at others and they get quite a bit more complex.  This one has become a near staple in our house and is commonly a fallback recipe when we feel a little lazy.

Had this last night and it was a HIT!  Everyone in my family liked it and that is saying something.  Very easy.  I moisturized all of the chicken with mayo and covered the whole chicken with breadcrumbs. Perfectly done (not too dry and no pink) at 25 minutes.  Thank you

Made this last night-2 thumbs up.  My husband said it was like something he'd get in a restaurant.  I brushed egg whites on the chicken before putting bread crumbs on it so they'd stick better.  Excellent!

Pretty good.  Not quite the same as I grew up on with the ham and cheese actually IN the chicken breast but good.  Will probably do again.

I took the suggestions & added garlic & onion powder. Next time to save frustration, I'm going to just put the cheese , spice & ham between 2 chicken breasts & tie together because the pounding & rolling wasn't that easy for me.

This was really good! I used prosciutto for the ham and coated the rolled chicken in olive oil before rolling them in bread crumbs .. I used crunchy (like panko) seasoned crumbs. Will make again.

very good.  Used thin sliced chicken cutlets. Next time I will put a thin layer of mayonaisse on top of the cutlets keep the chicken moist--as another reviewer suggested.  Will make this again.

Instead of rolling the chicken breasts, I think I'll stuff them next time since a lot of the cheese ran out, but otherwise it was great.

Overall good recipe.  My chicken was a touch dry, but I could have baked it a little too long.  I thought the breadcrumbs were too dry on top of the chicken.

I didn't bother pounding and rolling. just topped the breast with the meat and cheese and sprinkled with bread crumbs. I also grilled the breast before finishing in the oven. I used some chicken broth to keep it moist. Easy and wonderful. My husband made them into a sandwich for work the next day.

We really liked this recipe, even my husband who doesn't always like chicken recipes.  I didn't use the butter and our chicken wasn't dry at all.  A great after work meal.

I was served this for dinner the other night and the hostess prepared it as written.  I would have followed other reviewers' suggestions of drizzling melted butter over the breadcrumbs before baking to add moisture.  In general, this is a good basic chicken cordon blue recipe.

This recipe was simple, quick and tasty.  Perfect for making after a long day at work - made as directed, but (as previously suggested) added a small amount of melted butter over the top 5 minutes prior to adding the cheese to the top.

This was very good and easy to make.  Next time I will make it with a cream of chicken sauce because I thought it was a little dry and needed something with it.

this is a delicious & fun dish to make! i pounded my chicken breasts a little thinner then the suggested 1/4" then rolled it up with a good deli ham & jarlsburg swiss. finally, i (like other reviewers) drizzled a little melted butter over top of the chicken before serving. this recipe went well with steamed broccoli. thank you kiersten!

I've never seen such a simple recipe, I was even hesitant to write it down it seemed so simple. We don’t own a meat pounder / tenderizer so we used a garlic press and whacked it good but the chicken was still a little too thick. And it was hard to roll, the chicken breasts are so slimy! But none of that was on fault of the recipe. I was skeptical the meal but it turned out great and even my picky guests went back for seconds. I think next time I will make it with a sauce though.

Great recipe. The only thing I added were some chopped chives, fresh parsley and garlic in between the cheese and ham slices. I also used black forrest ham and provolone cheese. Great basic recipe

This was SO good and SO easy! I was nervous that it wouldn't pass the husband test but he loved it too. I used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss. The bread crumbs were a nice touch, different from other Cordon Bleu recipes I've tried.

Delicious! I didn't have bread crumbs, so I just toasted bread and crumbled it. So easy to make and it turned out extremely moist! The cheese melted out of the wrap, though, so adding it on top was a good idea. Maybe next time I won't put a full slice of cheese inside. This is a keeper!

a few modifications that I did..inspired by the recipe for Garlic Chicken. I put a few mushrooms in between the ham and cheese. Then I brushed canola oil, parmesan cheese, and garlic mixture on the chicken before rolling it in bread crumbs. I was darn pleased that I did...cuz it added some zest...

Very good and so easy that you could make it for a last minute dinner party and really impress your guests.  I drizzled melted butter over the topping to give it a buttery crunch.

This is a 4 star recipe because I had to make alterations to it. I added a bunch of spices to the bread crumb mixture. I baked it as the recipe called for, but for the last 10 minutes I added a mixture of cream of chicken, milk and pepper. With out the sauce, the recipe wouldve been wayyyyy to dry. I also didn't like all the bread crumbs, I thought it was a bit much. However, there may have been more than needed because I added parmesean cheese to the crumb mixture.

This is a yummy and VERY easy recipe. I made it for my in-laws and parents ... they were both impressed. I added a little low-fat honey dijon dressing to the inside to give it a little kick. Great for when you're pinched for time!

I don't like swiss cheese, so I substituted monterey jack cheese.  I also put a pat of butter on top of the chicken before baking.  WOW!!  It was excellent!  Will definitely make again!!!

This was tricky to make. The chicken breasts were a little to thick I think so after baking through they were somewhat bland.  Maybe I should've pounded them thinner.

These were good and quick.  My husband asked that next time I add more ham and cheese, but otherwise we both really enjoyed them.

This recipe was a huge hit. I served it to some friends last night and they all loved it. Even the friend who is the pickiest eater I know raved about it. I served it with the honey musturd sauce from the aussie chicken recipe and that was perfect. I will definately be making this again.

I used processed pepper jack cheese, garlic flavored breadcrumbs, and leftover honey baked ham from Easter (this was because of several reviews stating that the recipe was good, but a little bland).  I also made the honey mustard sauce from the "Aussie Chicken" recipe on this site (as recommended by other reviewers, but I left out the corn syrup and used sour cream instead of mayo).  I will try "real" pepperjack cheese next time--I only had the processed kind on hand.  My husband LOVED this recipe and told me that he is looking forward to the leftovers as am I!!

The chicken breasts I find at the store are huge and although my cordon bleu tasted good it would have been much better with smaller breasts.  The dominant taste in mine was chicken with only a hint of cheese or ham.  My advice, buy smaller breasts or cut them in half after pounding.  Also, it needs a sauce so I recommend adding a nice white wine sauce or something that doesn't over power the filling.

This recipe is very good.  I used the suggestions for the sauce to go over the chicken and it made it even better.  My husband really enjoyed it.

As other reviewers have said, this is very simple and somewhat plain tasting.  It's nice for a change of pace, and works with a stronger flavored side dish.  It's extremely easy to put together - I didn't even need to use toothpicks, I just set the chicken seam-side down in the dish.  It was cooked through in 35 minutes, and I didn't find it too dry at all, especially not with all that cheese.  And it turned out very attractive looking, not sloppy like some similar recipes I've tried.

Pretty good - not superb or anything but definately a nice easy, different way to prepare chicken. I used Proschuto ham (don't add salt) and Provolone cheese. I doused the whole thing in butter before baking - helped keep chicken moist. Very filling! Hard to eat a whole chicken breast after this treatment. Made the sauce to accompany it as well - nice dish overall.

My family loved this. . .especially two of my teenaged boys! I rolled up the chicken and dipped it in egg and bread crumbs, but it was hard to roll these up. However, it certainly didn't take away from their awesome taste or even appearance.

My son loves it!  It's really simple but it's not the best that I've had but that's because I've only had it in restaurants.  So for me to make it at home, it's good.

This was a great recipe!  The only thing I did differently was dipped the chicken in melted butter and rolled it into the bread crumbs.  I think this keeps it moist.  It was really yummy!

It's very good, but it's kinda salty. I didn't use a sauce, though I think that might help with the saltiness. But its very tasty.
