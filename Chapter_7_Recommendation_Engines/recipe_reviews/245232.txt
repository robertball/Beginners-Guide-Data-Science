Turned out great!  I brined roast first beforehand, and didn't use much salt in the recipe.  The flavors were awesome.  There was a lot of filling, but I made it work.  I would use either a sweeter apple next time or add in some other fruit like cranberry or cherry.  And I cooked the filling with the saut√© pan lid off so it was relatively dry when I filled the roast, and didn't run out at all.

Recipe is great, flavors perfect with the he pork.  However, I increased servings to 10 and followed the revised amounts.  but, the   amount of fennel, shallot, apple and gorganzola in the recipe would've filled two 6 lb loins.  I had ton of filling left over.  also, cooking time needs to be closer to an hour or at least 55 minutes.   I cooked for 45 minutes and still had a little too much pink for some eaters.  I was fine with it.  I'd probably make it again.
