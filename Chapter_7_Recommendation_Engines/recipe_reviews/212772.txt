I just don't get this recipe. It is basically veggies and black beans. The rum obviously adds flavor, but I really prefer my beans to have some sort of sauce if I am serving over rice. So, to make this edible, I added an extra can of beans, most of a can of tomato sauce, and some chopped ham. I also added shredded cheddar on top. With the additions I made, it would be about a 2 1/2 or 3 star, but I have definitely had much better beans and rice recipes.

This was a bit different, and not bad.  I think I saut√©ed a little longer than I should have, as the black beans etc. was a little thicker than we would have liked.  Otherwise, this had a decent flavor.
