These brownies were outstanding. I couldn't find the new two-chips-in-one bag yet, but I had peanut butter and milk chocolate chips on hand, so mixed the bags and used about 3/4 of the new mixture. These brownies are incredibly rich -- be sure to have a glass of milk nearby! The brownie and creamy PB mixture wants to come apart; perhaps I should have 'scored' the top of the brownie before I spread the second layer on top. Regardless, we all enjoyed these!

These were delicious and got rave reviews from the family.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the cooking times are off and I had to change a couple of things based on other reviews.  Since others said that the chocolate brownie part came out dry, I used 1/2 stick (8 tbsp.) of butter instead of 6 tbsp.  I also added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips to the chocolate brownie batter.  I baked the chocolate brownie for only 15 minutes.  Then I cooked the peanut butter layer for 10 minutes.  I then added 30 reese peanut butter cups (cut into quarters) on top and cooked for an additional 5 minutes.  Finally, I melted 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 tbsp. milk together, and then drizzled on top of the brownies.  These are very rich and very crowd-pleasing!  Enjoy!

I made this as a birthday treat for a co-worker who loves anything that is chocolate and peanut butter. I ended up sending this recipe to the entire office. These are super wonderful! The chocolate brownie batter will seem very dry when you mix it. That's the way it should be so don't add oil or water or any additional liquid.

I made the above recipe the first time.. I like peanut butter but it tasted a bit too p. buttery for me. Today I made the exact thing just with semi-sweet instead of the mixed chips. I tasted the peanut butter you make with the top layer and LOADS of chocolate on the top and bottom. Today is Thankgiving and we enjoy chocolate desserts better than pie. This would be a hit at a gathering or pot luck. I brought the first batch into work.. I can't wait for them to taste this one. A HUGE HIT!! An instant favorite! YUM!

I made these to bring to a labor day celebration with my boyfriend's family last fall.  This was the first time I was meeting his parents and was hoping to impress them with some awesome brownies (hey, I'm not above using chocolate as a bribe!)  His mom is a fantastic cook and I figured if nothing else, I could only hope to make something that was passable but never surpass anything she could make.

These brownies were a hit!  His family has requested I bring these to several other family gatherings since then.  And, his mother asked me for the recipe since his dad and brother could not stop eating them!  If this recipe can pass the boyfriend's mother test, then you know its good!  I followed other user's tips and cut down the baking time, added some chocolate chips to the brownie batter and scored the brownie layer.  I have a huge sweet tooth so I wasn't too careful with measuring the peanut butter and chocolate chips that go on top and threw on a few extra handfuls for good measure.  It worked well!

Rich, chewy and creamy!! These were wonderful. I did as another reviewer suggested, and scored the brownie layer before adding on the peanut butter layer...they held together just fine. I also chilled  them for an hour or so which made it much easier to cut. Will make again soon.

Trouble with a capital T!

These brownies are fabulous! I made them for my boyfriend because he is a peanut butter & chocolate freak.

I am a beginner cook--this may have been the first dessert I've ever made. These brownies were very easy to make and turned out great. My boyfriend was very impressed!

I just popped one in the microwave ( with a moist paper towel) for 15 seconds and it was divine! Glass of milk a must!

These came out great and not overwhelming peanut butter flavor. I would recommend doubling the drizzle and agree with scoring the brownie layer prior to adding the peanut butter mixture.

I loved these and ate too many of them by myself.  They were really easy too, except that I couldn't get the extra chocolate to "drizzle" so I just omitted it.  Not too peanut-buttery or chocolatey, but really moist and delicious.

These were awesome! And easy to make, I might add. The only problem I had was the bottom brownie portion is a bit thick, and kind of tough to spread around the pan. To save time, I didn't do the chocolate drizzle thing, and they were still wonderful. A big hit with the hubby!!

Awesome!!!  I tried this recipe last month for a party at our marina.  What a huge hit! They were the first sweet gone. (and there was alot to choose from!) I saved 2 for my coworkers...All they could do is rave (after they stopped making all of the yummy sounds). I cut these into 3" squares and then cut those on a diagonal, because I like the little triangles. I just made a double batch on a sheet pan for the Independence Day Party this weekend. Can't wait til they cool!

mmm these brownies are delicious! :) i accidentally forgot to score the brownies before adding on the peanut butter layer like the other reviewers had said, but i refrigerated them instead before cutting and that worked pretty well. i made these for a picnic and they were a big hit. can't have just one!

I was skeptical of these for some reason, but they were delicious! And oh, so easy! They look like they took a lot of work, but they do not. I didn't have any chips so I made chocolate frosting and drizzled it on the top. I will definitely make them again.

My husband and son loved these!  I caught my little brother sneaking out the door with them and had to take them back.  He made me promise to make him a batch next time he comes to visit.  Delicious but I agree that the peanut butter was a tad much and next time I will use semi sweet chips on top instead of PB and chocolate.

These were moist, but I only cooked the first layer for fifteen minutes, as well as adding two extra tablespoons butter to it.  The sweetness seems to come mostly from the chocolate chips & chocolate chip drizzle, so if you don't like your sweets super sweet I would recommend either going light with those or skipping the drizzle altogether.  I tried the brownies before the drizzle topping and did not like them; with the drizzle, they are sooo good (and look nice, too).  I brought them to a family gathering, and I have already had people ask me to make these for other events.  These are very rich, and generally loved, but they won't convert the peanut butter haters.

Okay-- this recipe was the BOMB. I brought it too my women's retreat recently and they were re-named-- O. brownies.  Followed the recipe to a TEE-- just be careful when cooking the peanut butter layer-- you don't want it to get too done.  Also-- I melted the chip mixture for the drizzle in a ziploc bag and then cut the corner off for easier no-mess drizzling... Awesome !!!

Yum... good!! I took these to a church potluck and they went over very well. I also was unable to find the mixed chip bags, so I mixed them myself. Good thing I am making these brownies again this week for a potluck at work so they will get used. The only trouble I had was getting the topping to drizzle.. it really never liquified. I left it off. These are delicious brownies and I have to keep them out of my house or I would eat them until they were gone. :)

Very good. I took others' advice and made a few changes. I used 8 Tbsp butter, but will probably use some applesauce instead of the extra butter next time. To deal with the sweetness complaint, I used all-natural peanut butter, and I didn't think the bars were too sweet. I used semi-sweet chips and peanut butter chips instead of milk choc. Overall, very good. Would probably be better with some walnuts. Will probably keep tweaking because I think it has potential to be fabulous.

Have a glass of milk ready because these are some rich brownies! These are great for a chocolate/peanut butter lover like myself. I did follow other reviewers suggestions and added 8 tablespoons of butter to the chocolate layer, instead of 6. I also only cooked the bottom layer for 15 minutes and then the peanut butter layer for 19 minutes. Really yummy!

These bars are delicious and addictive. They’re very sweet if you try to eat them too soon out of the oven so it’s best to make them a good 24 hours in advance (as is the case with many brownies). My oven’s a bit faster than some others, so I only needed to bake them for about 30 minutes altogether. For a second batch, I tried substituting the recipe for the brownie layer with mix straight from the box and they still turned out great.

This recipe earned my daughter 'brownie points' with her boyfriend's family!! She took a batch to her boyfriend's bday party, and his Dad called people on the phone to tell them about the 'awesome' brownies she brought!!!   We didn't have the swirl chips, so used a combo of regular chocolate and regular peanut butter chips--they still turned out fabulous!!

These were good, but the brownie layer came out a bit dry.  Maybe if I try it again, I'll cook the brownie layer for a bit less time than specified.  The peanut butter layer was really good (but very rich).

These were a bit of work, but very well worth it. I used 2 extra tablespoons of butter in the chocolate layer as suggested by other reviews, and I also cut the baking times to 15 minutes each and they were done perfectly in my oven. These tasted even better the next day-- I will definitely make again!

I made this recipe over the weekend to bring to a get together and everyone loved them.  They are very sweet, so I cut them in small pieces.  The only thing I did different to this recipe is I baked it the first time for 15 minutes and after I substituted chopped Reeses peanut butter cups for the Reeses chips I baked it an additional 10-15 minutes.

very good and an excellent combo of peanut butter and chocolate.  I had the 11 oz bags of peanut butter chips and milk choco. chips separate not the combined kind the recipe called for.  I used 1/4 bag of PB chips and 1/4 bag of milk choco. chips to sprinkle on top.  Worked great.  I also just took 1 tblsp PB chips and 1 tblsp milk choco. chips and combined those with the shortening for the glaze.  Thanks for the other reviewers comments and this great recipe.

I made these for our neighbor who is a peanut butter and chocolate lover and they were a hit with his family and some of our other neighbors, as well.  The recipe is very easy and the end result is delicious -- next time I might even try crushing some Reese's PB Cups and sprinkling on top for the grand finale!

I'm only 15 but this recipe is so simple and so good I'll be sure to make it again!  I've been baking for almost my whole life, so its more like a hobby now.  In other words, I had to variate this recipe to the ingredients we had.  My mom cooks and bakes a lot too so we always have the essentials, but things like the reeses peanut butter and chips I didn't have.  So, simple enough, I used the normal Kraft peanut butter, and some milk chocolate baking squares (no shortening needed then) for the top.  We had the condensed milk, luckily, so that was good.  Anyways, I thought the recipes looked really complicated but it took me about 20 minutes to do it all, and it tastes great!  My whole family ate them up so quick!  Thanks for the recipe! 

Btw, I used 1/2 of normal 'fry's' cocoa instead.

I had a bag peanut butter/ milk chocolate chips and wanted to use them up before it gets too hot. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. They came out very good. I did use a full stick of butter, other than that followed the recipe exactly. If you like peanut butter, you'll like this brownie. The peanut butter flavor is very rich.

Fabulous.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of hte extra drizzle of chocolate on top and they came out great.  Not too sweet not at all dry.  I am not the best baker and I was very impressed.

I have made these twice already; they are delicious. My friends (who are girls) loved them, and told me how good of a cook I am, and nearly everyone who had one at a social event said something good about them. The only bad thing is making everyone happy with enough batches of these treats.

If you want a stronger taste of peanut butter, try using the all natural kind. The second time I made these, I had used the additives kind (hydrogenated oil, sugar...) and it wasn't as peanutty as with the first batch. Perhaps next time, I shall omit the peanut butter alltogether and replace it with a bit of orange zest!

These brownie bars didn't last more than a day in my house.  They were fabulously chewy and delicious!  The brownie slices even looked nice while on my cake plate since they have the double layer effect.

Amazing! I made these for a bbq with the boyfriend's parents and his mom was impressed! They were kinda fudgy b/c I took them out earlier and I added more pb and chocolate chips to the top midway through cooling.

A big hit with the adults, but found that most kids were finding it too sweet...believe it or not.

I liked these but they didn't blow my mind as the best dessert ever.  They are worth making once though since they are easy enough.  Like other reviewers said they are super sweet and I can see where the brownie layer may be perceived as dry.

Another twist on the ever popular Magic Cookie Bars.  Not as good as the orignal, but these will still get eaten.  Mine were a bit dry from being overcooked. I did cook the bottom layer at least 5 min longer than called for because it didn't look close to being done.  Of course, this goes back into the oven for the second layer so the first layer doesn't need any additional cooking time.
