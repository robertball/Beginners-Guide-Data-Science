This is creamy and yummy. I dipped fruit in it. Would go great with a salad that has fruit in it and sweet nuts, in my opinion. I can tell there's tequila in it. It could use a bit more sugar still since the tartness of the sour cream and lime juice still comes thru strongly.

Bumped up the tequila just a bit, and used half plain Greek yogurt/half sour cream.  Nice light dressing, everyone loved it.  Will do this one again.

I used a lot more tequila. HUGE HIT. I made it twice this month with blackberries and strawberries.

I needed an organic fruit salad dressing and found everything but the tequila in organic. Left it out, and it was still an excellent, addicting dressing! I also used plain lime juice and cut the sugar by almost half. Used it over blackberries, raspberries, peaches, plum and mango. Heavenly!

This is a great recipe for all of the summer fruits becoming available.  I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream, I have made this recipe for guests and they want more!
