I've made this twice in the past month! Added some spinach and paprika last time. Probably had about 1/2 the bacon but the flavor still came through. It takes some time but is a major no-brainer recipe that yields awesome flavor due to the crunch of the spaghetti squash and the cheesy crust. Better to undercook this than overcook--broil the top if you have to. Mine did not come out watery at all. May add some form of onions next time!

This was really easy to make. I fried up tiny cubes of pancetta instead of using bacon bits. It wasn't as soggy as spaghetti squash sometimes is. Someone suggested baking it in a shallower pan next time, to get more of the cheesy crust. I might try that next time!
