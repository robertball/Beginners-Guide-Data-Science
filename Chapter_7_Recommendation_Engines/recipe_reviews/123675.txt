I've made lots of pot roasts in my time, but this recipe is the BEST I've ever used.  Absolutely delicious!

I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar, because that was all I had on hand.  I also baked the pot roast in a large covered pot in the oven.  Those were the only changes I made to the recipe.  The meat and vegetables were moist and flavorful, the gravy is just fantastic -- this recipe is a real keeper!

This is so yummy.  I add potatoes and a cup of beef broth just to suit our tastes but this recipe is perfection.  Thankyou Shirley!

It's been forever since I have made a roast & we really enjoyed this! I had a bit of spicy bloody mary mix in the fridge & I went w/ that instead of opening up a bottle of tomato juice for just 1/2 cup. After adding the other ingredients, I couldn't detect any spicyness so it worked very well.  I did sear my roast (I used a 3 and 1/2 lb. black angus rump roast) but then moved it to the oven to bake. I  added some quartered, butter golds when I added the onions & carrots. Hubby, who normally insists on ketchup on his roast, really liked the gravy. Thansk for a tasty recipe Shirley Kidd!

Was looking for a different gravy to slow cook my roast in.  This is IT!  Something different always scares the men in our family...and this did.  Then they TASTED it!  AWESOME 5 star recipe...thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! This made the most awesome gravy! Have already fixed this more than once and it got rave reviews from the family. In the last batch, I substituted sweet potatoes for white potatoes and also added some whole okra. Delicious!!

My Mom used to make something similar with only peppers for veggies.  She'd shred the roasted beef and serve it all over rice.  This was a huge hit with my potroast-loving husband who's very um ... discerning.  Yeah, discerning. Thanks for sharing this!

This is without a doubt the worst pot roast I ever tasted!  If you like real Yankee pot roast, don't even think about wasting your money on this recipe.

Made this with the serving size of 4, it was fantastic! The cider vinegar added a nice mild zing to it, the only difference is I had to use veggie stock instead of tomatoe, and had to keep adding it, so it wuld not burn. We are not gravey fans but the taste of the roast was not over powered and the gravey was perfect!!

I have two favorite pot roast recipes, but I was looking for something different. This is a nice change of pace. I got distracted and didn't have time to add the onions and carrots at the end, and it was still very tasty. I had no tomato juice so I used V8 juice. Served it with mashed potatoes and buttered corn. I will make this again.

My dad (bless his heart) bought 4 sirloin tip roasts on a "buy one get one free" deal.  I think sirloin tip roasts are just about the most awful - tough, dry cuts of beef there is, but he loves pot roasts so he presented these to me.  I reluctantly defrosted one the other day to cook and wanted to try a different recipe and found this one.  Pretty much followed this to a tee except after browning I used my crock pot in an attempt to tenderize the beast.  I did use beef broth in lieu of the water and it turned out pretty good - it was somewhat tender but still had that dry texture but that is due to the cut of meat and not the recipe.  The gravy was tasty.

so so very good! I am a sucker for roast. I just absolutely love it. I usually just throw in some ingredients and never follow a recipe. I decided to this a try and glad I did. The flavor is so wonderful on this roast. My mother came over for dinner and seriously had like 4 servings! So there you go.... she loved it, I loved it and so did my husband!!
