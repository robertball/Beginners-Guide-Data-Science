The (syrup? custard?) filling is very similar to the one of a pecan pie. Yet, I omitted chopping macadamia, and munching on a whole round nut was a nice contrast with the sweet corn syrup filling. May try it with hazelnut to make this pie cheaper.

Very good and easy to make.  Rich like pecan pie.  I actually liked it better than pecan pie because I love macadamia nuts.

Recipe very quick and simple to make, perfect when pressed for time!!  When served warm, this pie didn't do too much for me--just didn't "grab" my tastebuds.  When served cold, it's wonderful!

Awesome. My mom, a southerner, used to make this when I was a kid growing up in Hawai'i. Macadamia nuts, particularly broken ones, were cheaper than pecans. We all liked this better. Good for you, STORMY, and thanks!

Our guests enjoyed this pie so much that they didn't touch the Pecan Pie I normally make.  This recipe will be a new Thanksgiving tradition in our house.

Used to pie crusts to cover a 1/4 sheet pan and baked till golden brown. Easier eating since I cut them in squares.

It tastes fine, but then again, this is simply a pecan pie made with macadamia nuts, so if you like traditional pecan pies made with corn syrup (I prefer pecan pies with caramel filling rather than corn syrup, but that's just me), you like macadamia nuts and you like eating pies, then you'll definitely be happy with this recipe. 

The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is primarily because of its appearance. It's, unquestionably the ugliest looking pie I've ever made. The flotilla of whole, beige macadamias suspended in a crisp filling of dark corn syrup is visually unappealing. The macadamias really stand out with their light color and make the pie look unfinished or undercooked, even though it's not. The dark skin of pecans lends a great deal more appeal than light-colored nuts, at least with this recipe. 

There's a reason I was only able to find 2 or 3 recipes for macadamia pies and like 200-300 recipes for pecan pies. It's because macadamias don't look good and don't really taste all that great in pies. They're meant to be covered in chocolate or eaten plain right out of the jar. They're not the type of nut you put in a pie because of the aesthetic reasons I mentioned and because the sweet filling just doesn't compliment the subtle, understated taste of the macadamia nut, it overwhelms it. 

Don't take my word for it, though. If you are set on baking a macadamia pie for whatever reason, try it! It's a very easy recipe with a short prep time, so you've got nothing to lose.

Hands down one of the worst looking pies ever made. The filling is too sweet and the Irish creme is lost in the overwhelming sweetness of the corn syrup.  As written this will fill (2) 9" pie shells not (1).
