12.22.16   I had to add quite a bit of water to the thick dressing to get it to the right consistency, and it diluted the flavor, so I adjusted all the dressing seasonings.  I was expecting more flavor from this salad, found it just a little bland.  I gave it a healthy shot of Sriracha which suited our tastes, but I’m not sure I’ll make this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Ann D.
