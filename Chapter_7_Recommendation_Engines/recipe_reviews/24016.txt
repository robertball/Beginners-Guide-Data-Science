This was good, however, incomplete in instructions.  The bread DEFINITELY needs to rest at least 10-15 min after baking.  Otherwise, you're slicing mush.  Good without the spinach and just pepperoni and cheese instead.

Truth be told I don't think it gets all that much easier. If I were making this for appetizers I would likely make two or three loaves because I didn't get a ton out of it but since I was serving it as a dinner side it worked out wonderfully. Really easy and just as good as the spinach bread I get at pizzerias here in upstate NY and much cheaper! I highly recommend this one.

Absolutely Delicious and so much easier than the way my Italian Grandma used to make it. My husband and I tried to make his mom's spinach bread a few times but we had too much trouble working with yeast.It is such a pleasure to work with ready made dough. Why not do it the easy way. Still the same great italian flavor we both remembered as children. You can't go wrong here.

Delicious! I only had monteray jack cheese and that was fine. I also sprinkled in a little bit of oregano to the mix. I used a 13.5 oz. can of pizza crust and it worked out ok but I know if I'd used the 10 oz. can as suggested the ingredients would have been better distributed. I used fresh spinach and it was gone within two hours between the three of us.

I've pretty much been making this recipe for years. However 2 things will greatly improve the taste - homemade pizza dough (very easy if you own a breadmaker) instead of store-bought and fresh chopped spinach instad of frozen. I've tried it both ways and the fresh and homemade items make a world of difference! Great vegeterian dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I served it as a side dish along with a big salad. Was very good - I think next time I will add a little more garlic but otherwise I would not change a thing. It would be terrific with some marinara for dipping as well. I can see myself making this quite a bit with a pot of soup in the cooler months.

I did not care for this...(sorry). I took it to a get-together and no one ate it. I will probably try it again but next time I will add some ingredients maybe roll the dough in butter garlic and parmesan before baking and add some seasoning to the inside.

This was very good I made this for myself and my boyfriend. He really loved it which says a lot! I did add a few things though. I used a bag of fresh baby spinach and wilted it with the oil and added about two teaspoons of water to help the spinach along. I also cut two chicken breasts into cubes and sauteed them. I also added an extra clove of garlic along with canned diced garlic basil and oregano tomatoes and mixed the whole thing together before adding the Parmesan and off course seasoned to taste. Overall though very good meal to make on a budget and very easy for a college student like me. I will be making this again i would really like to make it with whole wheat pizza dough next time! But still very good and very filling!

My whole family loved this and asked me to make sure I make this again. My husband said that it reminds him of the spinach pies they used to get at the local pizzeria in Rhode Island. I doubled the garlic too:)

Yum! Bf and I both liked this a lot. Bf made salmon and corn and we served it with that for dinner. I used the Pizzza Dough II recipe on here for the dough and added oregano to the dough. I used more garlic than called for and brushed the top of the rolled loaf with butter and sprinkled some more mozzarella cheese on top. Turned out lovely. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make. Note to self: do not skip flouring the aluminum foil otherwise you will shred the roll trying to separate it from the foil after baking! Flavor was good but not great. I think next time I might add more flavors like roasted red peppers or sun dried tomatoes or sharp cheddar cheese.

What a great easy recipe. I took the advice of others and doubled the garlic (maybe a little more even!). I added in some really thin sliced tomatoes and topped with some extra cheese and italian seasoning while it baked. Great for dipping in marinara. This is a keeper. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the bread towards the inside of the roll never seems to really bake for me. As a result its a tad squishy on the inside but still tastes great!

This recipe is excellent as is. I added 3 links of Italian turkey sausage and 1/2 cup chopped onion and cooked all with the spinach. Fed 2 hungry people and made a good leftover for the next day's lunch. Thanks Anch for the great recipe.

We agreed this recipe was just average. After reading several reviews I added extra garlic & Parmesan cheese. If I were to make this again I d probably use the box of frozen spinach. The spinach overpowered all the other flavors.

Oh my goodness! I have brought this to 2 parties and it was a big hit both times. It is easy and tastes great (I love garlic and add more than the recipe calls for). If you use frozen spinach defrost it in the microwave and lay it on a plate afterwards. Drain it with another plate by squeezing them together. The spinach comes out drier and you don't need to cook it as much. Enjoy!

Very good! Was a bit of a challenge to roll together. The first one looked terrible but the second one looked presentable. I would try this one first before taking to a party just in case.

This was OK. A little bland and soggy. I DID dry the spinach before but apparently not enough. I don't think I'll make it again.

I added some pepperoni to the spinach mixture with excellent results. The pepperoni added that little something extra.

This was phenominal! I used home made pizza dough because I couldn't find any at the store. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. This will be a staple in our house.

This was really good. I definitely didn't season it enough I hate when it just says season to taste because I never do enough. Lol. Next time I'm going to use a little more cheese and a little less spinach since the spinach was practically all I could taste. Also I think maybe some asiago cheese would be a good addition since it's so salty it could make it really yummy! We all liked it after I added extra garlic salt and Parmesan cheese after slicing!

My absolute favorite! I made this for a church potluck. People were eyeballing it right away after I put it on the table. I was afraid no one would go for it but it was the very first thing to go. It is delicious!

We loved this spinach bread. We doubled the garlic since we're big garlic lovers. We took this to a dinner party and it was a hit. We'll definitely be making this again.

I loved this recipe! i used fresh spinch instead of frozen and I used homade dough but that was all I changed. These are going to be a new favorite at our house.
