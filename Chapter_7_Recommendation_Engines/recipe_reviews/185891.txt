Yum!  Man this recipe is good . . . and I think it could be even better if you marinade the chicken first in Italian dressing.

I went by the recipe but tucked this mixture under the skin of chicken thighs. A very nice change to boring thighs! Next time I may try pimento stuffed green olives (I'm an olive freek-must be the salt)!! YUM

This recipe was very good and very easy to prepare.  A great twist on tired old chicken.  Cooking the chicken breasts on the grill added a great smokey flavor to the olive puree.

I thought this was tasty.  I made it exactly as written except I did not use the grill...it is cold and rainy in AZ today.  I pan fried it in olive oil and it worked fine.  The only thing I would change next time it to lesson the parsley, lesson the garlic to one clove and maybe add cheese.  I was amazed both my kids ate it with no questions except my daughter did say "don't tell me what's in it" ha ha!!  Good overall chicken recipe.  Thanks!

I do not like black olives, so I used kalamata olives!!! YUMMY!!!!  I also added lemon juice to the puree, just for a splash of acid.

This was a great dish.  I did add a splash of lemon juice as suggested and a bit of balsalmic vinegar.  I substituted rosemary and basil instead of the parsley and did half black olives and half kalamata.

This is definitely not a keeper, though I had high hopes.  It wasn't bad and it was definitely moist, but given the ingredients that went IN to this dish it's kind of astonishing how little flavor came OUT of it- aside from the flavor of the grill.  Not bad, but definitely not worth the ingredients as none of their flavors truly come through.

This was a huge hit. I'm not a huge fan of olives, but even I liked this dish. I baked it instead of grilling. Delicious.
