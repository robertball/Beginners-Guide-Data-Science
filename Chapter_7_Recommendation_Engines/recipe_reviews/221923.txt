Good stuff.  I personally feel that wrapping the slices with nori (seaweed used for onigiri) makes it taste better.

Good recipe. Had to substitute a milder fish sauce for the dashi stock, because I was out. oh no! but the recipe tasted good otherwise.

Well I don't have dashi but I made the dish with everything but that and it turned out fabulous. It's super easy and delicious. Also I used a large round non stick pan it worked perfectly. No need to hunt down a tamago pan.

Smells amazing while you're cooking and it tastes even better. Although I substituted dashi stock and sweet wine with seasoned rice vinegar. Still worked out great although the color of my version is quite as yellow. Not sure if that is due to cooking it too hot or from my cast iron skillet.

Very tasty! I substituted chicken stock with a little fish sauce for the dashi, and served it on top of sushi rice patties with a strip of nori around each piece. This one is going into my recipe notebook.

You dont need to use dashi. I just used the mirin and i like my tamago sweeter so i made it 2 tables spoons. Also its nice served cold. You can keep it wrapped in cling wrap in the ref so it stays moist. Once your ready to serve it, thats the only time you slice it

The Tamago pan is a must for an even omelette. They can be found in most Asian markets and on Amazon for around $20.00.  The advantage to using this recipe with a rectangular pan is that the ends come out even and you get more omelette without any waste using the same pour egg mixture in the pan, flip or roll the set part of the omelette in half, add more egg mixture, wait until it sets, flip again, etc, etc until the Tamago is built as high as the pan.  A nice finishing touch is to square up the rolled egg using a plastic lined sushi mat to make the Tamago square end to end. Tamago is a great sushi topping as well a welcome surprise in a bento. A light sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds makes for a complementary flavor.

Very good!  The only changes we made were to use chicken broth instead of  dashi stock (we didn't have it and I don't eat fish) and apple cider vinegar instead of mirin since we didn't have that either.  It was delicious!

I liked the recipe, but it was a bit sweeter than when I've had it before. When I make it again, I'll probably cut out the sugar by 1/3.

So yummy and easy!  I used a round skillet and it worked great.  Probably not as pretty, but tasted fantastic.

The first time I made this, I made it without the dashi stock, used the mirin and soy sauce. I didn't like the taste of that. So from then on I just make the eggs without any additions and after they are cooked, I'll add srirachi or wasabi or whatever as a topping/dip. I use a 10" round pan for 2 eggs, the biggest difficulty is rolling the edge over the first time and every time you start a new layer.

This recipe was amazing! I didn't have the wine necessary, so I substituted 1/2 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp red wine vinegar thoroughly blended together. Also, being vegetarian, I had to make the Dashi stock -  I boiled 2 cups of water with a sheet of dried sushinori seaweed and one Morning Star Farms veggie sausage roll, and added a teaspoon of salt. Both of the substitutes worked perfectly well!
Also, I cut a sheet of sushinori seaweed into strips and wrapped it around the egg rolls when they were cooled, like in the picture. I served them over plain white rice with spicy szechuan sauce. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious! Mine came out looking more like a crepe, though. I  think it's a lot harder than it looks. I can't imagine making the roll so small as to fit on a small piece of rice (And a bento box!) but I plan on making this regularly and perfecting the technique.

This was a great recipe. I did not have the dashi,  so I substituted with chicken broth and a splash of seasoned rice wine vinegar. It was great.
