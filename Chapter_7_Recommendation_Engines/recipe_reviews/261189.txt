I did make some changes in the preparation but not with the ingredients. Instead of using so much mayonnaise I decided to mix about 3 Tbsp mayonnaise with about 1 Tbsp dry ranch. I brushed this mixture onto the chicken, and then coated the chicken with the bread crumbs (which I also added dry ranch to). I enjoyed this and will probably make it again.

This was amazingly easy to make. The chicken was moist and flavorful. My family asked me to make it again. The one pan clean up was great too.

Excellent!  I had to use gluten free bread crumbs, but this still turned out so tasty.  My family requested I make this again this week!  My husband asked that I add two more chicken breasts to it though.

I used bottled light Hidden Valley ranch because that's what I had on hand. I marinated the chicken for a few hours and got rave reviews from the hum and mom. It was super tender and moist. Will definitely make this again.

My family loved this! I followed the recipe and It was easy to prepare. The chicken was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I used organic  baby rainbow carrots make the dish colorful.  I cut small red potatoes into quarters.  All of it was done at the same time.  I used chicken thighs.  For this reason I had to increase the cooking time to 45 minutes.

This was delicious. I did not use a large enough sheet pan for all of the vegetables I tried cramming on - that meant it took longer to cook, but well worth it.

No changes made, the carrots turned out hard. Don't know what I could have done different, I cooked it 10 extra minutes in hoping they would soften. It didn't work. The potatoes and chicken were delicious! I loved the tender chicken so much! Overall good meal. I will make it again.

I couldn’t get hold of ranch mix in the UK so just used ranch dressing instead of mayo etc. I jazzed it up with some Brussels sprouts and some kalettes. It was nice enough to make again and clear up is super easy! My son devoured the chicken and poked around at the veg on his plate. (Sigh)

5 stars for easy and 4 stars for taste.  Nothing fancy here but I could have adjusted the spicing to make a more interesting meal.

Loved it but everything cooked unevenly. I will make this again but won’t cook it all at the same time. Carrots were the main problem.

This meal was delicious! I over cooked the veggies just a bit. The chicken was perfect. I’ll remove the veggies before the chicken next time.

Note: 4 chicken breast halves or 2 full breasts cut in half are what we used.
