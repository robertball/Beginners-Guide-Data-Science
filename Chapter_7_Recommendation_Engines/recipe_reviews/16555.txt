So good! I changed a couple things, but for my brothers that are tofu-haters, they couldn't even tell, and loved it. I used choc. soymilk, less almond extract, and didn't have oj concentrate, so used a strawberry/banana/orange juice concentrate instead. also topped it with whip cream lightly sweetened with about 2T honey.

This is divine!! The only thing is...the orange juice concentrate will give it a very slight orange flavor...so if you are not a fan of that you might want to leave it out.  I used chocolate soy milk instead of rice milk.  Delicious!

Can't give this 5 stars because I changed it so much, but it is definitely 5 stars with my modifications!  I found a similar recipe online by Alton Brown and I merged the two and ended up with following changes.  Used the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe from this site.  Substituted Cream of coconut (from the alcoholic beverage aisle) for the orange juice concentrate and the maple syrup.  Used a 1/4 cup rice milk and 1/4 cup chocolate liquor (creme de cocoa, could use any liquor i.e. coffee, orange, etc). Lastly, I increased the chocolate chips to 1.5 cups and tofu to 12 oz. Filled the crust perfectly, and set very nicely, very creamy and very flavorful!

This pie is easy to make and REALLY yummy. You'd never guess from the taste that it contains tofu and rice milk instead of the usual high-fat cream!

Awsome recipe!  I cut back on the almond extract to 1/8 tsp.  Found that the 1/4 tsp. is a little strong.  But overall it was excellent!  I have made this 2 times now and it has set up perfectly.  Thanks!

I like to find ways to use tofu in our daily menu without always having it "visible". This is a winner

WOW! This was the definite show stealer of my dinner. I baked the coconut at 350* for about 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Used 1/4 cup chocolate soy milk, 1/4 cup chocolate liqueur and 1 tablespoon orange juice. Skipped the almond extract (didn't have). 10 oz of chocolate chips and a 14 oz package silken tofu made a FULL 8" pie. It's like a chocolate mousse pie that absolutely melts in your mouth.

I made a variation of this pie and I cannot stop eating it!!  I have ulcerative colitis, and have been trying to cut out refined sugars and a few other things from my diet, but I have a massive sweet tooth and HAVE to have something for dessert each night. I didn't use coconut because I have high cholesterol, and I used Silk chocolate soymilk and actually firm tofu instead of silken.  I also don't have any almond extract, so I didn't use that either.  I bought an organic, sugarless graham cracker crust at the local crunchy store.  It was an incredibly light final result, and I really loved the texture.  It satisfied my sweet tooth without really being that sweet. Of course, the day after I made it my doctor just told me soy can make you gassy and to avoid it...but I don't think I can take that advice.

I've been through several tofu pie recipes & this rates tops with me.  Due to some allergy/diet issues, I did make some changes that I believe don't alter it enough to declare it another recipe. I've used homemade pie crusts (an oat one and rice chex one & sometimes none).  Also, I used a subst. for the choc. chips (milk allergy) -- cocoa, marg., soy milk & sugar.  Didn't have rice milk, used soy milk.  I did have to sweeten it with a little stevia.   I've also made it and added a sliced banana on crust before adding tofu mixture.  Not only do my diabetic family members love it, but I've impressed others with a "good for you" chocolate pie!

Great texture, horrible taste.  What a waste of a good pie crust!  I do not recommend this recipe.

i made this for a couple of my friends and i totally won them over.  great texture and sweeeet!!!  the orange uice concentrate adds an interesting touch--a good touch!
i substituted chocolate soy milk for regular rice milk and it turned out really well as well... so as if the entire cup of chocolate chips wasn't enough...!!!
i can't wait to sabotage the holidays with this pie.

This recipe was well-received!  I made it on a Sunday, and by Wednesday evening, there was no trace of a tofu flavor.  I, too, cut the almond extract in half and the flavor was delicious!  Today I made the recipe again, without the coconut.  It was a lot faster to make it that way, if time is at a premium.  Thanks for sharing it.

This was incredible! Only changes I made were I omitted the OJ since I had none. Used almond milk instead of rice milk. Used 3/4 tsp vanilla and omitted the almond extract. I used the Graham Cracker Crust #2 on this site. My husband even liked it and he hates tofu. A light, delicious dessert! Thanks for sharing!!

This pie was terrific!  Rich & decadent tasting!  I did make a some changes due to preference. . . to not use sugar, I used 4 Tbsp agave nectar & 7 oz baker's chocolate instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  (It could have used more sweetener.)  I also left out the orange juice & almond extract, added 1.5 tsp coconut extract, & upped the vanilla to 2 tsp.  I already had 16 oz firm tofu, so used that with 1.5 cups almond milk.  I also increased the coconut to 1 cup, and garnished the pie with toasted coconut & chopped pecans.  I used a regular pie crust because I like them better.

Wonderful! Only thing I changed was I did not use the 1Tblsp Orange juice. Wanted a healthy dairy free desert for Easter dinner. My husband even loved it and he often complains about my healthy cooking alternatives. Everyone said they never would've guessed it was made with tofu.
