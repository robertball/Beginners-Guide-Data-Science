very salty, i'm wondering if you were supposed to soak the chipped beef first?  with teh salt in the soup and bacon, the beef sent me over the edge.  otherwise it was okay.  very similar to my grandma's recipe except my grandma's is easier and has fewer ingredients. 
2 cans cream of chicken or mushroom soup, 1 16oz container of sour cream
chicken and bacon.  
wrap the chicken with the bacon, mix soup and sour cream and pour over the top. bake at 250 for 3 hours.  the chicken falls apart.

Even my husband liked this! He requested that I make it again, which is rare. I made a few changes. I halved the recipe because I was only serving three people including me, and only used 6 chicken legs. I only used 1 can cream of mushroom soup plus 2 tablespoons of water. I also added 1 can of mushrooms. I didn't use the smoked beef because I didn't have any, but it seemed fine without it. I baked it for 2 hours at 375 degrees and the chicken was wonderfully tender. Thanks for the recipe!
