Yum! I made these because I had a ton of unsweetened baking chocolate to use up. I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the chocolate drizzle because I had no semi-sweet chocolate. 30 minutes was perfect baking time for the brownies, but I thought the brownies alone were a little bland. With the peanut butter though, they're great! I'm sure I'll make these again.

Bland and kinda weird tasting. Refused to cook (i think my total time was well over half an hour- and I halved the recipe) and fell apart when I took it out of the pan. Frosting was gummy.

The brownie itself was good; I used semi-sweet chocolate and 1C of sugar.  I used a dark 8x8 pan and mine definitely were not ready in 35 minutes - it took about an hour to bake.

The frosting the recipe includes is awful!  You definitely have to add milk and butter to the peanut butter and confectionary sugar - I just combined all to taste.  

Also I suggest just 1 square or even half a square for the choclate drizzle; a little goes a long way.  

I give it three stars because of the frosting in the recipe; with a bit of maneuvering this can easily be a favorite recipe.
