I have made this a couple times and its really GOOD!! There are two ways I make them. 1.  how the instructions tell you to. 2. using a 9x13 pan with the chocolate and butterscotch on top.  Let cool and enjoy.  I get many more complements when its rolled though ;).  Also when making the chocolate and butterscotch mix I added 2TBSp butter and 2 Tbsp milk.  It made the mixture creamier and easier to spread out.  Great recipe Thanks!!!!

I made the recipe as stated.  The only thing was that I rolled it along the long edge.  They were still about 3 inches in diameter, so I'm glad I didn't roll them on the short edge!  They would have been huge :)

Followed this recipe to the letter however, I felt it needed some color, so I added some candy coated chocolate sunflower seeds. This was popular with the kids. If I made this again though, I would melt the chocolate & butterscotch separately and layer them rather than mix together. The butterscotch flavor was faint and I think it would have been good had it been stronger. Really fun recipe for the kids and a nice twist on 'ho hum' krispie squares.

Love these. Made as written first time and thought they were great. Second time used the same size pan but made one and half times the recipe (15 servings) and rolled them from the long way.  Press them down hard before adding the chocolate and then you will get the pretty "swirl"

Watch the marshmallows in the microwave!  I *kind of* covered mine and there was a sticky mess all over.  Next time I will use milk chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  Semisweet and butterscotch are just too sweet for me (and I have a major sweet tooth!).  Another idea is use chocolate Rice Krispies with just peanut butter chips. mmmm...

This is fun and easy to make! I rolled from the long rather than the short side which makes slightly smaller slices.

Marshmallows blew up in the microwave and it was a sticky, gooey, ugly mess which could not be salvaged.

Delicious, fun and easy to make!    Definitely note other reviewers posts where the filling can tend to squeeze through little holes in the cereal base.  I was able take the little bits of cereal left in the bowl and fill most of them to minimize it.  This is a real crowd pleaser ~ next time I may make two as this doesn't last long!

YUMM! shall I say more! my pan was smaller when I put the crispy mixture in so it made for a thicker roll. And I didn't have butterscotch chips...they were peanut butter by mistake..don't think that matter. It was still a great treat. Will make again because the family asked me too. Fun to make and the end result was great.

YUM! My mother in law makes a dessert for EVERY, did I say "EVERY" (LOL) occasion that she calls "goodie bars"; it consists of Corn Flakes, Corn Syrup, Sugar and Peanut Butter and then frosted with melted Chocolate Chips and Butterscotch Chips.  I have to tell you that my husband, son and daughter said this was even better than that! HUGE compliment! Thank you TONS!

I am not big on rice crispy treats however I thought I would try this because it was quick and involved chocolate/peanut butter!  Here are my findings: very easy to make, I used a combination of milk choc chips, semi sweet and maybe 1/2 cup of butterscotch because we are not big fans of butterscotch. I patted down the rice crispy mix after spraying my hands with alittle pam and it worked fine, I rolled the log the long way (using tin foil on the bottom sprayed with pam) and that worked out fine as well.  After about an 1 hour, I sliced off a small piece from the end and I was surprised at how tasty this no bake dessert is - this will get eaten up in no time and I will be definitely making again!

Very easy to make.  (I dont do logs often)  I was getting ready to make rice crispy treats and ran across this..fate??  I dont know, but I'm glad I did, its a great recipe.  It took me about 10 min, I did not add the pb, but otherwise followed recipe.  It was very easy to roll with the wax paper.  I cut off the end cuz I couldnt wait to try it.  Its chilling but I know it will be 5 stars...it tastes really good.

Yes, it is sticky to put together but it helps alot to spray your hands with cooking spray!  Also, I thought the microwave time for the marshmallows should be about 1 and 1/2 minutes instead of 2, at least for my microwave.  It rolled up pretty well, though mine does not look like Martha Stewart did it.  It was gone by the next day so I'd say we enjoyed it. thanks for the recipe!

I decided to go with the peanut butter chips like many others and I'm glad I did, it turned our SO yummy. One tip I have is when spreading the Rice Krispies onto your pan spray Pam on your hands and then use your hands to press it into the pan. Makes it much tighter to where the chocolate doesn't ooze our through any holes. This Christmas I think I will use red chocolate chips for the filling and then press red & green M&Ms on the outside :)

Good recipe...I modified a few things..instead of butterscotch chips I used peanut butter for the frosting part, and it's Christmas time so I used the Christmas coloured Rick Krispies - awesome!

Very good, and easy to make.  I used my hands and rubbed soft butter on the paper, and I had no problems with it sticking.  I didn't have butterscotch chips, so I just used chocolate chips with a couple Tbl peanut butter mixed in for the filling.  I left the log in the fridge overnight, and cut thin slices with a sharp knife.  Yum!  My kids like them too, of course. ;)

I made this...but with modifications. Instead of chocolate chips, I used a 12oz bag of butterscotch chips and about 1/4-1/2 cup of peanut butter for the filling. I put it in the jelly roll pan and just thought they were going to be TOO big, so i cut it into four rectangles and rolled them up the long way. They were a HUGE hit at the super bowl party. Everyone loved them! I might drizzle some with chocolate or dip half of it in chocolate in the future... But it really is a GREAT recipe!

Doubled this and rolled it up from long side. didn't have butterscotch chips so used caramel chips I got at a markdown salvage outfit that were called "no need to unwrap" 
Made this for Father's day and I know it will be a hit with husband. He has been wanting rice crispy treats and this is just a fancier form of them. So easy and fun also. Kids enjoyed helping.

I rated this recipe a couple of years ago and have not changed it's 5 Star rating! I continue to make it to serve at a variety of events.  I needed something to serve at the lunch after a funeral.  It was the one and only dessert that was gone.  I got requests for weeks! One thing I have changed is how I roll it up...I use HEAVY DUTY FOIL sprayed with cooking spray...lay it in the pan, spray with oil and then roll it up. It's so much easier for me.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

This was totally simple and delicious.  The only change I made was that I added toffee bits to the chocolate/butterscotch mixture.  I am not a baker and this is a great dessert for those of us who can never think of a dessert to make.

Super messy to make, but so much fun.  Be sure to roll it tight otherwise the pieces are too big!  We added Candy corn to the cereal for Halloween flair!

i make the crispys the original way on the stove, since why mess w/ something already perfected? And followed the rest of the recipe. Everyone loves these! And the first time I made them I forgot to mix the peanut butter in, so i just spread it on the crispys before the choc/butter mix, and they still came out great.

I had the ingredient for these Crispy treats, it was hot today and decided I would  made them. Were they EVER GOOD!! I have not had good luck in the past with "rolling" cakes and such so, I just made them into bars. The kids and I really enjoyed the flavor of these different type of rice crispy recipe! Thank you so much!! It's nice to be able to made dessert without turning on the oven:):)  ♥ Patty ♥

So I haven't actually eaten them yet.  They are in the fridge but I can't imagine this combination of ingredients not being great.  This was incredibly easy.  I think the hardest part will be washing the marshmallow bowl.  I used all natural creamy PB, which I thought might be too runny for this but it seems to have worked out fine.  Some one mentioned chocolate seaping through the holes.  I pressed the cereal mixture into the pan with my clean hands.  I was able to pack it tight and close up the holes.  I have very little seepage.

Easy to make and delicious. I didn't add peanut butter (allergies) and it still turned out perfect.

I admit this recipe is good just the way it is but I have modified it ever since and its ssssoooo much better.....
I dont melt the chocolate....it was too heavy that way so I bought  the mini chocolate chips and the butterscotch and just sprinkled them on. 
I also make a version without peanut butter and I add a little food coloring to the marshmallow mix and double the butter....very yummy....
Ive also used large sprinkles inside by themselves for a chocolate free version....

This is my favorite way to eat Rice Krispie Treats.  I melt the peanut butter with the butter and marshmallows then add the cereal and press in a 9x13 pan.  Then I melt the chips and spread on top.  So good!  Sometimes I'll leave out the peanut butter.

Made these this morning and I'm currently eating my 3rd piece!  Very delicious!  I basically followed the instructions as written except I used the regular stove method for melting the marshmallows.  I also didn't measure out the PB (didn't want to dirty another item) so I just added a large "blob".  I did use about 3/4 cup of butterscotch and 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips as I was afraid the chocolate would overpower the butterscotch if I used the amounts as written.  I think my amounts used were perfect as neither over takes the other.  I did roll it long ways so it made more slices.  They are plenty big even rolling it the long way.  They turned out incredible.  I'm taking them to a cookout and I don't expect to have any leftovers.  Would definitely make again.

The marshmallows blew up in the microwave and it was a huge mess to pick up. The chocolate started on fire in the microwave. I made the rice crispy on the stove and melted the chocolate in a double boiler. Other than the minor set backs and a few changes it turned out good.

This recipe is fabulous.  I made just as it says and family and friends loved it.  I made sue to press it firmly into the pan to avoid any holes for the chocolate mixture to seep through. We enjoyed this so much we have made it more than once.

We made this recipe to take to the kids' school function. Everyone loved them!  The flavor was yummy, but the only problem was that mine didn't have the pretty swirl in the middle. It was more of a chocolate smudge in the center. It could be because they were not completely chilled when I sliced them.  Next time I will either let the chocolate harden for a little while before I roll them, or let the roll harden before I slice them.  Based on what other reviewers recommended, I used a jelly roll pan and rolled the long way. I ended up with about 30 (1/2") slices.

oh man I made this last minute for a potluck and had so many compliments.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and used crushed corn chex (all I had)  REALLY BIG HIT!  I am making them again this weekend and will use corn flakes b/c I think the corn cereal taste with the PB and chocolate is excellent!!

I did have a bit of a challenge with the greased waxed paper sticking as I was rolling but the extra effort was worth it!  Added skor bar pieces as well.

5 stars for ease and taste!  This is such a simple recipe that comes together in 10 minutes.  I had read previous reviews that talked about it looking messy because the chocolate seeped through, so I firmly pressed my crispy mixture in the pan, and then pressed together any holes I could see.  It seems to have worked well, but most of all, it is so good!

This is deeeelicious...
but I agree - the chocolate seeped through the cracks making it a bit...ugly! But it's all about taste right?  I also tried it by omitting the uber-sweet butterscotch chips, and sprinlking Skor bits onto the molten chocolate before rolling up - Sooooo Good!

I was a little nervous making this, since I was never good at making jelly rolls. I didn't have the butterscotch chips but used the chocolate only. Delicious!

My daughters and I really enjoyed making this tasty treat. Although I am not a fan of the butterscotch flavor, I still give it 5 stars, because they were so proud to present this to their father and have him enjoy them. Next time I may try a carmel or a white chocolate chip instead of the butterscotch.

Yummy, but mine turned-out ugly. The chocolate seeped through all the nooks & crannies to the outside. Krispie layer too warm when I spread the chocolate maybe?

Great Recipe!! The chocolate adds a nice touch to regular krispie treats. The only suggestion I have is to take them out of the fridge about a half hour before you eat them.

Awesome!  I cut up some toffee bars into bite-size pieces and added those on top of the chocolate/butterscotch layer.  I doubled the recipe and there were STILL none left over after a potluck.  I'll never make the ordinary rice crispy treats again.
