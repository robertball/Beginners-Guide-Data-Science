Loved this recipe. I made this for a crowd, so I beefed up the recipe considerably. Used two packages of tri-color pasta, and pretty much doubled everything else. Like other cooks, I added lots more of the mayo+curry dressing -- about two cups mayo and four tablespoons curry, and it was perfect for the amount of pasta I had. I also didn't have raisins, so I used "craisins", or dried cranberries. Subbed out pine nuts for chopped toasted almonds. I left out the tofu. This would have tasted GREAT with diced ham. I'll definitely make this again. (Oh, and I added the apples in lemon juice right before serving. This was a nice way to avoid the drying-out that other cooks have noticed.)

Made this with normal pasta not tri-colour, didn't have any tofu so omitted that and used yogurt instead of mayo to make it healthier. Doubled up all the ingredients except for the pasta as others suggested.Absolutely delicious, tasted very much like coronation chicken. Needs to be eaten on the same day or the pasta absorbs all the sauce, I revived it with a little olive oil.

This is a delicious recipe.  I reccomend it highly. I made it twice in two weeks. I tried it with orzo and it was really good.  I did find that I needed to double the quantity of the curry dressing that you mix in for my own liking.

Tastes great..  The first time I made it i used tofu, second time, I used chickpeas-YUM!  I feel that the amounts used in the recipe are not enough.  I just added more of everything until I liked it.  I actually think this tastes better the next day.

My boyfriend and I love this side dish. I added more curry powder and lemon juice. I also added seasoned salt and blackpepper. It was delicious!

I love this salad! I substituted jicima (I had some I needed to use up) for the apple, which worked wonderfully. The 1/4 cup of crumbled tofu is a savory addition that works extremely well with the curry dressing. Like the previous reviewer, I doubled the curry dressing.

I used pumpkin seeds instead of pinenuts. I also grated the apple the same as the carrot. I added about a tbsp of honey.

It was 4 star tasty, but i spent a day and a half trying to get the consistency right. I would recommend trying it at home, with extra ingredients on hand, in your spare time. I wanted it for a party the next day and was disappointed with the initial results. It definably needs lots more of the sauce, but how much more depends on your tastes. I found it kinda dry even with the extra sauce, but on top of lettuce and with a few sliced grapes it was really good.

SO GOOD!  I did this with whole wheat pasta instead of multi- colored and I doubled everything but the pasta.  I quadrupled the curry, mayo and salt.  It would also be good with edamame in it.

I love curry and this definitely satisfied my taste buds!  I only had raisins, tofu, and green onions on me and it still turned out fab.  I really liked the sweet addition that came from the raisins.  Yum!

I played with this recipe a bit (I used blended tofu instead of mayonaise, e.g.), and I agree more "sauce" is needed, but this recipe is excellent as is or with added/subtracted ingredients!  Start with this as your basic recipe and add/subtract to your liking- it's delicious!

Made the recipe as is, though I thought something was missing. So I added some things..don't remember my actual measurements, but I think I used 3 tsp of curry powder total. And also upped the mayo to 3 to 4 tbsp. Added a tsp of cumin, half a tsp cayenne pepper, a few dashes of cinnamon. Ran out of lemon juice so I added about a half tbsp of apple cider vinegar. I'm not the best cook, so the added ingredients might not make sense, but it worked for me! Oh I also used leftover roasted chicken (shredded up) instead of tofu. And decided to throw in some wilted spinach (I'm trying to sneak in more greens)

Other reviewers were right: double the dressing. I also added jicama as somebody suggested along with applies and raisins (hubby doesn't eat grated carrots so I had to omit that). I made a lot for next day lunch and leftover tasted very good with the flavor developed even more. I recommend doubling the recipe.

This is a delicious pasta salad! Everyone loves it. The only thing I recommend to change is the amount of dressing you make - I double that part of the recipe (two tbs. of mayo, more lemon juice and increase curry or not to your liking). Otherwise, this is a great recipe that I highly recommend.

This is a good tasting dish that can easily be made into a complete meal.  I did make some substitutions because I didn't have some ingredients on hand though.  I added more 'sauce' by putting in more curry and mayo and added some EVOO for liquid with the lemon juice.  I also ommitted the tofu but added some diced ham.  Hubby, a big curry fan, had two helpings so it passed the test!

I brought this over to my mom's house, and everybody loved it except for me.  For all the exotic ingredients, it tasted very bland.  It seemed a bit dry too.  I'm sure a great cook could adapt it, it has a lot of potential, but I won't be having it again.

This recipe was quite good.  I used way more mayo, as I like a creamy salad dressing.  I liked that it was a bit different than the usual pasta salad. I'd make it again for sure.

I rarely give such a bad review to a recipe, but this was not good. The curry flavor didn't seamlessly integrate itself with the dressing, but was overpowering. Also, the lemon juice gave the dish an almost vinegary, unpleasant taste. My fiance and I gave up, threw away the leftovers, and ordered pizza. I won't make this again.

I thought this was a delicious recipe.  I would have put 5 stars, though I felt I had to add more curry, as well as some olive oil to make more moisture to the pasta, and I even only used 7 oz of pasta instead of 8oz. My husband loved it as well.

I like the basics of this recipe - I used a 12oz box of pasta and had to almost quadruple the mayo/curry mix - I'd like to spice it up a bit more next time with fresh herbs - maybe some cilantro and parsley - it does dry a bit while in the fridge - I'm going to try olive oil to remoisten.  But it is a keeper for me!

Pretty good and pretty forgiving. No tri color pasta so  used regular ole shell pasta. I used honey roasted peanuts since that's what I had. Also added a tbsp of sour cream with a tsp of sugar mixed in.

The apples give a nice zing to this recipe.
