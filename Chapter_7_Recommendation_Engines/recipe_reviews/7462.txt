I was making this to take over to someone's house for dinner and thought it sounded good and wouldn't take much time.  Well I made it, rolled it up then went to unroll it and it broke all up.  I thought I did something wrong, I already had the filling so I thought I would try to make it again and make sure I followed the directions perfectly.  I waited the said time to unroll it and it did the same exact thing.  What a disaster.  Now I have to look for something else to make before I go over to friends!!!

this really is a great recipe, but you have to wait until the cake is COMPLETELY COOLED before spreading the filling onto the cake and attempting the roll.  It also helps to flip it onto the waxy side of a sheet of waxed paper first.

The text of the recipe mentions beating 1/2 cup of sugar into the yolks; the ingredients list 1/4 cup, which is correct.  It took 16 minutes to be fully cooked.  After cooling the cake to room temp in the pan, I inverted it onto wax paper and let it rest cool for another half hour before adding the filling and rolling it.  It was still fragile, but held up.  The taste was excellent.

This one should have no star at all.  It fell apart and wasn't even good enough to make a trifle...

I attempted this cake the other day for a friend's birthday.  I followed the directions exactly, and the cake completely crumbled when I tried to roll it.  I, like the other reviewer, already had my filling made, so I tried to default to a trifle.  Since there was no flour (which was the appeal of the recipe in the first place) there was no substance to the cake, and it turned to mush when layered with my fillings.  I am glad to know that I am not the only one who had difficulties in the rolling.  Otherwise the cake had a decent flavor, a little bitter for my taste though.

I have made a chocolate roll with regular flour many times, but changed my method slightly for this recipe. Please note there is a typing error in point 3 and only 1/4 cup white sugar should be used. I cooked for 13 minutes, then let the cake sit in the pan until it was completely cooled. I then flipped it onto wax paper, spread the whipped cream and immediately rolled up. The roll had no cracks and it looked and tasted great. All the family liked it and I will be making this again.
