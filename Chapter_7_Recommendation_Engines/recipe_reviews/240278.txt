Delicious! 
A great twist on traditional corn muffins. 
I only made a few changes (because I didn't have all the ingredients.) Everything else I kept exactly as is and the muffins turned out moist, and cooked through exactly on time and at temperature. I especially enjoyed the apple chunks.  Both my boyfriend and I devoured them. 

Instead of white pepper I used regular.
Instead of fresh sage I used 1/2 tsp dried rosemary, 1/4 tsp dried oregano, and 1/4 tsp dried marjoram.
Instead of buttermilk I used whole milk with lemon juice squeezed from a lemon wedge.
