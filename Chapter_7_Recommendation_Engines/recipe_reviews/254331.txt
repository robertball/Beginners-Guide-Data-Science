6.25.16  First, I don’t think this recipe is written very well.  AR typically does a fair amount of editing, and I’m surprised that they didn't question some of the issues that I had.  For example, it calls for “1 pound cooked pasta.”   How much dried pasta do you put in the pot? I have NEVER seen a recipe that called for “cooked” pasta.  I measured out 8 oz dry noodles, remeasured after cooking, and ended up 14-1/4 oz if that’ll help you.  If you want to taste pieces/chunks of the tuna, I’d recommended that you don’t add in the tuna until after you’ve mixed your other ingredients.  Just mixing up the soup, sour cream and mayonnaise takes quite a bit of stirring to incorporate, and if the tuna is in there, you’ll end up with tiny tuna shreds...just my opinion.  What purpose does it serve to cook a casserole in a loaf pan, unless you want to slice it like bread?  I used a casserole dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray to be sure that I didn’t have a baked-on casserole dish to clean later.  And what kind of bread crumbs should be used...dried or fresh?  I used some Italian panko, what I had on hand.   The casserole dish had more top surface area to cover with the bread crumbs than a 9x5 loaf pan, and I stopped at 1 cup (more than enough).  I can’t imagine a 1-1/2 cup bread crumb topping on a loaf pan.  On the positive side, it does taste pretty good.  I would give this 4 stars for flavor, but 2 stars for the way it’s written, so averaged out, that's  3-stars.

This is truly the very best tuna casserole I have ever had in my entire life!!!! I served this to a friend who hadn't had a tuna casserole since he was a child and he thought it was the best he ever had too.  I did make a couple of adjustments as follows: I suspected it might be too dry with the noodles so I increased the milk to  1 cup, I used two  5 oz cans of tuna,  I used 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley, I sauteed 1 cup of sliced portabella mushrooms and added 1 cup of frozen peas.  If you want an outstanding tuna casserole, this one is the 5 star!!!!!

I made this as written and the response was,  "This is really good, Mom!"   I don't know whether or not the amount of pasta (per oz.) makes a difference as one reviewer was talking about?  I added a regular size box of Garden Rotini Pasta from Wally World, and it seemed the perfect amount.  My family said to make it again —so 5 stars.

Love this recipe! My husband raved!  I didn't have any cheddar so I used a mix of Romano/parmesan. I stopped it with a few crumbs from Costco parm. crisps and a few Italian bread crumbs. yum

We used leftover cream for the milk, used 2 cans of water packed tuna, wide egg noodles & a can of mushrooms. We found we needed only about 3/4 c. bread crumb topping, but we added Parmesan to them for added flavor. Excellent, easy recipe! We had it all the ingredients on hand. We would toss in a handful of frozen peas or spinach! Very good comfort food!

Compared to my standards, this is dry, tasteless, and disappointing.  I will NOT make this again, ever..  I will stick to my grandmother’s recipe.  It never fails or disappoints.  I’m just sorry I wasted  two cans of tuna on this recipe.

Best ever!  I added chopped green bell pepper, pimentos, mushrooms (canned), onion and extract tuna-2cans and 2 pkgs of the herb garlic tuna. Don’t worry about the pasta amount, just cook it ! I used a one lb bag of egg noodles. Excellent upgrade on an old classic!

Very tasty. The recipe did call for a little to much noodle and breadcrumbs and I did add extra tuna , but that’s what all cooks do to make something to their own taste. We enjoyed it and will make it again.

It requires more tuna and did not stay creamy. I added another can of tuna and more liquid after removing the toppings and then reheated it and adjust consistency during the process. When I reached the desired consistency I then added the toppings and browned them under the broiler! Family loved the new style!

Very good recipe. I added one more can of tuna and chopped fresh spinach. The spinach didn’t add anything special to the recipe, but didn’t take away from the taste, so was a great way to add greens. I used my immersion blender to blend all ingredients before adding the tuna. This made the filling smooth and consistent. Great flavour!
