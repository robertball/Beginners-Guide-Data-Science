My Fiance and I ate this meal and thought it was fantastic! He added a little more(or a lot more) garlic powder and garlic salt to his chicken and it tasted even greater.

This was easy to prepare. It was also very bland. I won't add this to my recipe box. (This is the same recipe as Campbell's Skillet Chicken and Broccoli.)

I tried this as a quick fix meal after a long day of unpacking. I made  some modifications right off: 1) I used chicken tenderloins. If chicken is going to be one of only a few ingredients, I want something moist and tender! 2) I used butter instead of oil. It brings out the flavor of the chicken and the broccoli. 3) I used all chicken broth, including the broth that drained from the tenderloins. 4) I topped everyone's serving with sharp cheddar to add some tang and some extra flavor. 

All in all, the recipe turned out well. I probably won't use as much broth next time since it turned out a little TOO "brothy." I will also add some Buck's seasoning (a terrific all-around seasoning found in local grocery stores here in northern New York). It might also benefit from a dollop of low fat sour cream. A great, quick basic recipe, though! I'm sure we'll use this on a lot of those busy weeknights when I start dinner late!

After reading the other reviews I made sure to spice it up when I made it. When I heated up the oil for the chicken I added red Chili flakes and a clove of garlic. Also, some cayanne instead of paprika. Also didn't have Basil so I added a bay leaf. Turned out great! At the end I put a sprinkling of cheddar cheese on top which made it creamy! Could have used more rice for the amount of chicken but it turned out really good!

This was ok, but it was really bland. I used fresh garlic, chopped onion, salt, and pepper and it was still bland.
