I could not find small sized red potatoes, so I just cut up one pound of red potatoes into bite sized pieces and boiled them about ten minutes. I know it isn't as pretty but it sure did taste wonderful, and was very easy to prepare. I did use white wine vinegar since my potatoes were cut already. We all loved this and such a nice refreshing change from the mayo potato salads.

This is just the kind of potato salad that we love. No heavy dressing....just fresh and light dressing with bright flavors. I did add some Nicoise olives (cuz we love them) but no other changes. Thanks so much for sharing this great dish! UPDATE: This is one of those recipes that is so versatile because you can use whatever pickled or marinated vegis that you have on hand. Tonight.....golden fingerlings, marinated artichokes, papadews & gigante beans. Kalamata olives and some green ones too. LOVE this recipe for simplicity and fresh flavors. Using up leftovers in my frig are the bonus! Thanks again for sharing!

Made this as written for Christmas and it was perfect! Not only does it taste delightful, it is a very pretty dish as well. My parents were visiting and they couldn't stop talking about it. My dad not only asked to take the leftovers home but also requested that I make it the next time I came to visit them. Five star all the way and a definite keeper!

I made it exactly as is for a big family event.  Everyone liked it.  If I was making it just for my family I would add a little more spice to it by adding some different peppers with a little more flavor.  But I really like the fact it has no mayo or mustard.

Mild flavor, so if you like it a bit more spicy or tangy, you'll need to make adjustments.  But I liked it as is.

Left off the olives, and sliced to potatoes before cooking, but left the rest as written. Might go heavier on the vinegar next try, but overall we found it a keeper. Will definitely do it again. Like that it can be served room temp, warm or cold. Very versatile and won’ Poison the company picnic if it’s not kept on ice.

We loved this version of potato salad.  Both my husband and I love mayo and can’t get enough if it is in a recipe so I wanted to try something leaving it out.  This is a very tasty salad.  The first time I made it, I did exactly what the recipe said to do.  Today, I went to the olive bar at the grocery store and picked out a variety of things and will make it with that instead of just green olives.

I was recently in the Canary Islands, on Gran Canaria in a non-Touristic town, Telde. A take away kitchen which cooks classic Portugese and Spanish Canary Island recipes, El Secreto, makes a version of this which includes hard boiled eggs and fish, but not tuna.  It was fabulous but I don’t know the name of the fish used.  It was stringy and white and slightly transparent.
I made this version and added pre-cooked cod and a sweet onion in place of a shallot and doubled the amount of dressing.  Thank you fir giving me the spring board for what I was searching.  Thoroughly enjoyed it, it is a keeper!

We have a Moroccan saying that this salad reminded me of : "The eyes enjoy the food before the mouth does". This salad is Delicious and oh so Pretty  !
The Moroccan potato salad is very close to this one. It has everything here except the olives and red pepper. I will be making this recipe again for sure.

What a wonderful unique potato salad!  Loved the Spanish flair!  I will make this one again!  The next time I will take care not to over cook my potatoes...otherwise, they tend to fall apart easily.

Refreshing recipe. The green olives make it unique and give the salad a nice salty zing.

I made this recipe as written and it came out fantastic.  I have been looking for potato salad without mayo and this one is perfect.  I will definitely make it again maybe with more olives next time.

I would cut back on the oil & add more olives.  I will try it again since it is a nice alternative to mayonnaise based salads.

It was good  Everyone seemed to like it.  I used capers in place of olives and added a ring of chopped hardboiled egg.  I thought it needed a bit more salt on the potatoes before adding the vinaigrette but that could just be me.  No one at the dinner had any but good things to say.
