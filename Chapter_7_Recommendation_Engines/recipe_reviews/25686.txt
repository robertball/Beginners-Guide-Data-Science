I think men should not be so pig-headed as to think women can't handle hot chili.  I've made chili hot enough to burn the hair off your lumpy head.  This recipe is mild in comparision.

My dad loves HOT chili and is quite the expert, so I gave him this recipe.  Sorry, but he was not at all impressed.  Tasted like a basic chili to him, of course this is the guy who puts Habaneros in his chili and it is so hot just the smell of it clears your sinuses.

I tried this recipe because of the description.  I find most chilis to be too bland for me, and he claimed to have a strong chili here.  I was extremely disappointed.  I added extra chili powder and cayenne, and it was still too bland.  I also cut the beans in half, and there were still too many for our taste.  Overall, there was just something off about the taste - I'm not sure if it was the sugar or the Italian-style seasonings, but it wasn't quite right.

I expected more.  It's really just an average chili recipe.  Not worth the effort.  I could get the same thing out of a can and no one would know the difference.

My toddler and five year old son loved this.  I gave it two stars because all the adults thought it was bland.  I will keep this recipe for a 'kid friendly' chili.

Not all that hot and no real 'chili' flavor. The jar of sauce detracts from the taste in my opinion. Sorry, just not really even chili to me.

My husband won a ribbon in a church chili cook off with the recipe.  The chili had to be editable.   There were four categories: spiciest, best over all, tamest, most original.  He won spiciest.  We actually had a Hispanic family there.  Earlier this week the wife was seen buying a lot of habanero peppers.  The wife had held the husband back from putting more spices in.  So my husband won the spiciest editable chili.  He did not ground the meat but used some meat balls I had made the day before using the following recipe from this website.  'Fast and Friendly Meatballs'

Medium Hot Salsa is what I used and it had medium heat. Used italian seasoning instead of seperate basil/oregano. I also use 80% burger when making chili because I like the flavor that the burger oil gives off, then drain most of it. The end result was a little runny for my liking so I added some brown rice flour to thicken it up.
