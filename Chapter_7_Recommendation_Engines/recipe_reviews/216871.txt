Simple and good recipe.  As a personal preference I added sautéed onion and garlic to the sauce also will cut the butter just a bit next time.  Adding ¼ cup Sherry, as suggested, was nice.  I’m looking forward to trying some different soups next time, perhaps cheddar cheese and cream of potato.

Oh my!  I have made this so many times and it was from my gram also.  I only recently did the rice on the side (low carber)  Of course I love it best cooked with the rice!  I also was told to add dry sherry into the soup to taste and it is great with or without it.  Loved this for decades!

This recipe is great BUT they have come out w/ some really amazing creme soups, ie garlic and mushroom and this is really wonderful as a twist to this recipe. Creme of mushroom by its self is also wonderful. I usually add some seasonings to mine too.

I'm givinig 4 stars because I feel it does need some changes.  Instant rice would never work for this dish.  Like other reviewers, I used regular long-grain rice and it was nearly mushy even then.  I'm sure it also needs a bit of spice as there is none in the recipe at all.  

My package of chops had six in it, so I used them all.  I dusted the chops with flour before browning, although I didn't need to...that was force of habit, I hadn't realized the recipe didn't call for it and I'm sure it wasn't necessary.  I put a bit of salt and pepper on the chops while browning and sprinkled the browned chops with garlic salt in the baking pan.  

I lightened it up a LOT, used FAT FREE cream of chicken and celery soup, SKIM milk and NO butter.  I was a little worried about that, but it came out creamy and rich tasting.  I just mixed the soups and milk in a bowl with a wisk - no cooking - added about a teaspoon and a half of ground rosemary, and a small can of mushrooms including liquid.  Then I stired the rice in - maybe slightly over 1 cup.  I did cook at about 275 or 300 degrees for about 2 hours.  It was terrific and will definately be in the regular meal rotation from now on!

I've been making this comfort food for years! Tonight, I discovered too late that I didn't have any instant rice. I improvised with a box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice, using only half the spice packet. Adding sliced mushrooms and french-cut beans half way through the baking time made this dish really tasty!

YUMMY! Just the recipe I was looking for! My mom made pork chops like this when I was little and this recipe brought back great memories! If you made it just as the recipe states I am sure it would be superb!  I added pepper, garlic powder to the pork chops while they were browning just to give them a little extra flavor.  Also I wanted to make sure the rice wouldn't get mushy so used 1 cup regular long grain rice instead of instant and I added an extra half can of cream of chicken soup and another 1/3rd cup of milk so there would be plenty of liquid for the rice.  We loved the rice that went along with the pork chops! Thank you for sharing!

So GOOD!  As others I added Sherry (1/4 cup, reduced milk my a 1/4 too) and about 2 TBS crushed Rosemary to the soup mixture.  I used the Chicken and Celery soup....AMAZING!  Suggestion is to use regular (instead of instant) rice.  It was perfect when it came out and not mushy as some of the others have complained!  TRY IT...You won't regret it I promise!

I thought this was excellent!  Great way to cook pork chops so that they are tender & not dry.  The 3 of us in the house loved it!  I did season the pork chops with salt, pepper & garlic powder before I browned them.  And I also added about a tablespoon of crushed rosemary into the rice, milk, soup mixture.  It was really good.  The rice was a bit mushy, but it's instant rice, of course it was going to be mushy.  I wonder if I use converted rice, would it hold up better??  Still very very good recipe.

Easy and yummy! I didn't brown the pork chops first and it turned out great! I used brown rice instead of white rice and the rice was extra flavorful.

As written, I think this recipe was a little bland and greasy.  It is a good base and the pork chops were definitely tender, but not a lot of flavor.  This makes a TON of rice, so I would try to add one or two more pork chops in to help even out the leftovers.  I would also do as some other reviewers have suggested and add some onion to the pan after you brown up the pork chops.  For a recipe with such sodium heavy condensed soups, I'm sad to say that it needs salt to improve it.  I would also cut the butter in half.  Mine pooled up in areas and just seemed excessive.  One other note; I didn't have instant rice so I used regular long grain.  I checked the dish about half way through to make sure there was still enough liquid since regular rice absorbs more than instant.  I had to add about a cup of water, but in retrospect, I would maybe add chicken stock instead and at the beginning if you are using regular rice to add more flavor.  On a good note, my husband and 3 year old liked this as written, but they aren’t too adventurous.

This took, literally, less than 5 minutes to prepare, then just pop in the oven!  Super easy.  I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic, and Cream of Chicken soup.  The rice was just a little mushy, but I served it with Stove Top Stuffing too and it was really good to mix the rice and stove top together.  Pork chops could be cut with a fork.

I've made a similar dish before and didn't like it but thought I'd try again.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the pork turned out tender but the rice turned into mush in the gravy. I also seasoned with rosemary because I thought it needed more spices.  Next time I'll just brown it and put it in the slow cooker with chicken broth.

Very good. Did not have the right soup so I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. While browning the pork chops I sprinkled them with a little Lawry seasoning salt and garlic powder and added some chopped onion. Used 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup chardonnay in the soup mixture and added 1 bag of boil in bag brown rice(removed rice from bag before adding). Will be making this again.

My husband and I love this dish so much! We add campbell's cheddar cheese too it though, and that throws it over the top. We have also contemplated adding in mushrooms. Overall, we are very pleased to have found this recipe!

**Edited to add..it's been almost 6 full years since my review and we are still making and loving this recipe! We have 3 kids now, and they absolutely love it when I make this for dinner! It's probably my all time favorite dish.

Very easy to prepare and quite delicious.  The only change I made was adding some finely diced onions to the soup mixture and as others suggested using long grain rice in place of instant.  This will become a frequent meal for sure.

We found this to be dry and not very flavorful.  I was surprised the pork wasn't more tender (I used thick cut chops).  I added some cheese to the rice, which was a solid move according to my family. Not fixing it again.

Good flavour, but found the pork chops dry as the rice had absorbed most of the liquid.

This recipe is awesome with a few personnal touches. Instead of using cream of celery and cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom and Campbell's French onion soup. When browning the pork chops I used a seasoning salt called raven's seasoning. It is absolutely wonderful!

I made this last night, and it turned out very dry and kind of bland. I did as many other reviewers suggested and seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and added some sherry and rosemary to the soup and rice mixture. I also used regular brown rice (not instant), but it got kind of crunchy around the edges. I must also note that I doubled the recipe, so maybe when I try it again I will add more liquid. This recipe got such good reviews that I am determined to make it again, albeit a little differently, because it definitely has potential to be on the dinner rotation for the fall and winter months!

This is really good.  Easy to fix and not that expensive if you use pork chops you got on sale.  I have prepared this exactly as written and prepared it slightly modified in order to use what I had on-hand (substituting Cream of Mushroom for Cream of Celery). Both ways produced stellar results.  The only modification I now make is to add a little bit of ground pepper to the meat before it goes in the skillet.

I would have given this a 5 star except for two things 1)  needed a little more flavor - so 2nd time I made I added a package of dry onion soup mix 2) Used jasmine rice one time and long grain and wild rice 2nd time MUCH better - do not use instant! 3) used 1.5 cups of milk, one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom, 3 Tbsp melted butter and upped the rice to 1.5 cups since I used 8 palm sized butterfly boneless chops seasoned with Lawry's and pepper and pounded before browning.  It was definitely a 5-star recipe with just a little extra seasoning and regular rice.  And no I don't like to change a recipe then rate it but if you are going to make it as written, I think you will be disappointed (read the other comments) and it doesn't need to be re-written...just needs a little tweak!

Mmmmm... comfort food. Easy, smells great and tastes like coming in from the cold. Almost expected mom to bring me a plate of it.

My husband and children loved this recipe! Anything healthy I can get my 7 year old son to eat must be amazing. The pork was so tender we could cut it with a fork. I have a feeling I'll be making it a lot.

I was looking for an easy recipe for dinner using what ever i had on hand and this fit perfectly... Simple yet absolutely delicious!! I used regular ( not instant) white rice and thyme, garlic powder, dried minced onion and salt and pepper for a little more flavor =)

I make this at least once a month and I love it! I actually sear the boneless chops in chapped garlic and chopped onion mixture and put the entire thing right in the crock pot.  I also use regular uncooked rice.  This is a family favorite!

I have made this several times, and it is well liked at my house. I switch out the cream of celery with other soups sometimes, just for a change. Cream of potato is good. I also season the chops with some tex joy steak seasoning before I brown them. Gives it a little more flavor. Overall, great recipe! :)

Delicious, simple dish. I used 1/4c butter the second go round, and it was just as good- maybe better. I, too, added rosemary to the soup mixture and seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder and pepper. I recommend using instant brown rice instead of regular white rice. Slightly healthier and because it tends to stay firmer, didn't get mushy like some of the reviews said.

I made this recipe for my family and everyone loved it, even the hubby. He normally is a soul food man and rarely likes to try new things. However, he was open on this one and he enjoyed it. This one will be added to the recipe box. Thanks allrecipe.com!

This was easy and tasty. I used the cream of chicken but substituted cream of mushroom with roasted garlic for the cream of celery. I then added more garlic (family fave) and sauteed onion. I also used regular rice as opposed to instant (gross, lol), sets the oven to 350 and increased the cook time to an hour. My guys said "excellent" so it's a go!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! Always turns out and don't need to change a thing! Every once in awhile I change out chicken breast instead of pork chops. I have also found that cream of mushroom can replace either of the other soups and be just as good. Love!

I have used a variation of this recipe for years. The difference is I use only 1 can of soup (cream of Mushroom, usually) and after I brown the pork chops I remove them and I stir rice, chopped onions, and garlic into the pan to coat. Afterwards I add a can of soup and a cup of water for every cup of rice. I pour the rice in a greased dish and cook covered at 350 for 1 1/2 hour to two hours, depending on the thickness of the pork chops. We also love to add a little soy sauce to the rice when we eat it. My family loves this!!

It was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly; oh wait - I did season the chops a little.  The rice mixture was perfect and very tasty.  The pork could have used even a little more seasoning than I gave it.  Next time I don't think I will brown the chops as long, if at all.  Although they were pretty tender, I thought them to be just a little dry. Although I have tried similar recipes, this is the best version. Just a tad more seasoning tweaking to be done.

I really like this, but it's almost too buttery and creamy, it gets heavy after a little bit.  Might try to adjust next time.

Family fav!  Just a couple changes I prefer to cut some fat... I use half the amount of milk and sub the other half with stock.  Also, I only use half the butter.  When I use the full amount of butter it tends to separate and soup up on top- half works great.  I just mix everything up in my casserole dish, melt the butter, mix that in, boom.  I don't bother browning the chops either- just cuz I'm feeling lazy about it or whatever.  Comes out great every time.

This is by far the easiest and tastiest pork chop comfort meal ever!  I halved the recipe-used 1 can of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of milk, Marsala cooking wine, long grain white rice and a teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary.   Two hours later it was fork tender and incredibly delicious

Great recipe! Love a good old fashion casserole every once in a while just like my aunt used to make, especially in the winter. I tweaked it a bit with the things I had on hand. Used cans of cream of mushroom and celery soup. Don’t have instant rice so I used Jasmine. I reduced the butter to a 1/4C and added an envelope of Lipton’s Onion Soup. Will definitely keep this recipe.

I use to make a similar recipe but can't find it. I didn't realize how much I didn't read the recipe until coming back to print it off. Having said that, its still the same idea and I love recipes that you can make your own. I breaded and browned our pork chops first, just out of habit. Then I used 2 cans of whatever cream of soup I had on hand, added a cup of milk, a cup of 5 minutes rice, and from there your only limited by your imagination. I used a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce, a handful of cheddar cheese and a smaller handful of parmesan cheese. I only baked for about an hour and pulled the foil off and baked for another 15-20 minutes. I probably didn't need to go that long, but got side track. The rice was so yummy!! We loved it and this recipe was just what I needed to get me off the ground. :)

Very good simple dish. I sautéed a medium onion thinly sliced after browning pork chops. Placed the onions over chops. I then added one onion soup mix to the rice to give  the rice flavor.

I season my pork chops a little extra when I am first pan searing them. Adds a little extra flavor. 
Yummy comfort food

This was delicious. I made it for my elderly aunt and mother, and they loved it. I made it a second time for my family, but I substituted chicken for the pork and I made it in my slow cooker, cooking it for 4 hours. It came out just as delicious.

We really liked this recipe.  The only change I made was I used long grain rice instead of instant.  Will definitely make this again.

As some said earlier, I floured the chops before browning (adding celery salt, pepper, paprika and onion powder to the flour). I only had cream of chicken & cream of mushroom soup in the cupboard so used them too. I added a can of drained green beans to the creamy mix as well. Turned out amazing.

It was very good.  I pretty much followed the basic recipe, but put Old Bay seasoning and garlic powder on the pork chops after I put them in the pan.  I used basmati rice and it turned out just right.  Lots of great leftovers!

I used regular long grained rice. Added riced cauliflower as well, and salt & pepper & cayenne pepper. Even after adding that it was still a bit bland, but I’ll continue to make it and doctor it until it’s perfect.

This is gobbled up by my family no matter how often I cook it. I do cut the butter in half  and cook it covered in the oven on 350 to speed up the cook time. Sometimes it is crunchy on top but we like it like that. We love it!

I will definitely be making this again!  It was quick and easy after work, and when it was done my husband cleaned his plate.  I browned my pork chops with a little pepper and some seasoning salt for some extra flavor, and I turned the heat up a little to cook a little faster after work, but this is good and simple.  I served with a side salad and some crusty garlic bread...

Hubby loved it.  Easy to tweak to suit your personal preference.  I didn't bother with browning the meat, I probably will next time but I was rushing to get it in oven (better things to do than cook today) used regular rice instead of instant and more milk for creaminess.  Good recipe for keeping those pork chops from being too dry.

My husband butchers hogs. I'm constantly  looking for easy pork recipes with little prep and  this fits the bill. I'm sure other reviewers have given tips on how to spruce it up but if you are looking for something simple and good this is yummy as written.  My only alterations were convenience related to use what I had on hand. I used cream of mushroom with garlic soup and brown rice.

being Asian and soft rice was not appealing, I made this and then ate with penne pasta instead. Kids enjoyed it!
I lightly seasoned pork and then browned with some onions. I put the other indredients (halved the butter which was perfect and not too greasy) into cooking dish without bothering to cook it first. Baked at 300 for 2.5 hrs because my cut of pork a bit tough. When it was done I sliced meat thin to eat with pasta. 
use any two cans of creamy condensed soup and should still turn out great and creamy. you can also add potatoes, carrots, spinach.

Made as written.  Lots of butter sitting on top - would agree to cut it way down next time.  Our chops were somewhat tough... perhaps the heat should have been higher during the sear, and for fewer minutes per side... or perhaps it was the meat itself.  At any rate, we will probably pass on this for the future.

I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil Seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before cooking. Also added 1/2 tsp of paprika to the soup and rice mixture. It turned out pretty tasty, everyone enjoyed it. I still think it was too bland, will try different and/or more seasoning next time.

Have made this many times and it's a great recipe. Pork comes out very tender. I make it with regular rice, add frozen peas, carrots and corn kernels and add seasoning. I deglazed the pan after browning the pork with red wine vinegar and sautéed some onions. Also add a splash of sherry. I guess it's my entire new version of this recipe to up the flavor and eat some veggies.

I've made this recipe twice now with a few changes. I started off by doubling the pork chops and seasoning with salt and pepper when I browned them. I used long cooking rice the first time and instant the second time. It wasn't bad with the instant rice but it held up better with the long cooking. I didn't have any cream of celery on hand so I used two cans cream of mushroom soup. I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms and a bag of frozen broccoli florets to make it a complete meal. I added some garlic salt and a little black pepper when mixing up the ingredients. It was delicious and made great leftovers!

This was absolutely delicious and what Iwas looking for!   I only modified slightly.  I added some s/p and garlic salt to the pork chops when cooking them and cut them into pieces before I put them in the casserole dish.   This helped 4 small pork chops go a long way.  Instead of the plain cream of mushroom, I went with cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and added a small can of mushrooms.  Since some of the reviews mentioned the mushy rice, I cut the cooking time to 1.5 hours and everything was done perfectly!   We went back for seconds and this will be my go-to recipe for casseroles for sure. I'm glad there is a little left over for lunch tomorrow!  Update and note to self...double the rice, add a cup of water

I've tried this recipe twice-once using boneless pork chops and once using bone-in chops.  Both times the chops came out DRY AS CAN be.  275 for 2 hours is far too long- Even after keeping my eyes on the dish and taking it out early it was a bust. I did add a third cup extra milk the second time to prevent the gummy rice from the first time ( and as other reviewers have noted)and both times I used long grain rice -not instant.  The rice had fantastic flavor (which alone gives this recipe its stars), but was too mushy for my husband. The pork was so dry both times we decided not to try this recipe anymore

I thought the cream of chicken and celery did not work together and there was WAY to much rice.

I was surprised that this wasn't more flavorful, needed a good bit of seasoning, plus I found that this kind of dried out the pork, I may try this again, but I will do some tweaks to improve it.
