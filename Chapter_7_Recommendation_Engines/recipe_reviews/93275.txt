In VA, where I am living, these are known as blue motorcycles. I went to Vegas one year, where I was introduced to this drink, and they call them Black Opals. What ever you call them, they are delish and get you buzzed in a second.

This had to be one of the worst drinks I have ever had.  I had to change the amounts of the existing ingredients and add a few of my own to make it worth drinking.  And, you can't put pop in a shaker and shake it!  It explodes!  So even the instructions were ridiculous.  I would not recommend this drink to anyone.

I found this drink in a restaurant when I went out to celebrate my divorce. I loved it then and continue to love it! WARNING....It goes down so smoothly you may not notice when you've had too much until it's too late!

I love this drink!  On the west coast and here in NM we call it an Adios, which is exactly what you can say if you've had one too many of these drinks!  I will agree with an earlier review in regards to the soda and mixing it in the shaker.  I usually make it by shaking the alcohol in a shaker and then topping it with the soda, sweet and sour and a cherry.  Which is much how a Long Island is made...

This recipe is fantastic! It combines nearly 8 oz. of 40 to 80 proof alcohols, with 2 oz. of soda (BTW, Earlier comment on soda-in-shaker combo impossibility, Nope! Works good.) I much prefer it the way it is written, but my wife loves this blended with a scoop of ice cream, instead of over ice. Good stuff!

This was delicious!  It reminds me of the Tokyo Iced Tea (which I can't find anywhere on this site!!)  It's all the same ingredients, but instead of Curacao use Midori and nix the carbonated cola.  It's really yummy, and you can barely taste the alcohol!  Before careful though, because it will knock you off your hiney!

Packs quite a punch and is surprisingly palatable!  It definitely needs the lemon slice, and we were quite heavy with the sour mix and Sprite.  Enjoy!

Was looking for blue drinks for my Superbowl party.  This is ok but needs a bit of tweaking. Too much alcohol to amount of mixer for me and I love Long Islands. Increased the sour and Sprite and that helped.  Pretty color blue though! Thanks.

I know this drink as a Skylab Fallout. The common reason for ordering one is to have a Skylab Fallout Race where participants compete to be the first to finish the entire drink, the difficulty is that you must drink through the straw, so no chugging.

We used to sell these where I worked and they are awesome.  Slightly sweeter than a Long Island.  We called it an Electric Iced Tea.

The instructions could use improvement, a 1/2 jigger is 0.75 fl oz, many sites list the suggested volume as 0.5 oz per liqour which is probably better for most of you.  Best all to the drunks who put in over 6 oz of booze in a drink.

Would try flavored vodka next time and add more soda.  Had a bit of an alcohol taste unlike a Long Island Iced Tea.  But still has a heck of a punch!

as a big fan of the Long Island Iced Tea, i had to try this one, and oh my god, i was not deceived.
I didnt read the instructions properly, and the mix ended it in the blender with the ice, and to be honest, if i had to do it again, there is good chance that i'll do it the same way.
NOW, i'm almost done my first glass and.... i'm already tipsy!
sometime, you just wanna get tipsy and try to avoid the extra calories so we go for strong alcoolic beverage. Well this one is now on my favorite list.
Hope this all makes sense... Hmmm blue motorcycle is a killer! I'd say it's probably a speed bike ;)

I'd suggest half the count (.75 ounce instead of 1.5 ounces) of liquor.

It is interesting to see the different names for this. In Utah we call this an AMF, standard, every bar you go to. And it stands for Audios Mother F-er. They are delicious and dangerous haha!
