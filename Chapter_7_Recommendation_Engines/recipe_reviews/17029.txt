I really liked these muffins a lot, but I just didn't really taste the pineapple as much as I was hoping.  Maybe add some pineapple extract?

These tasted really great, but fell apart really easily. I used fresh pineapple instead of canned so maybe that was my problem. But everyone loved the taste, so I'd do it again.

I absolutely love these muffins!  The pineapple gives it a sweet flavor-heck, if you really want to taste pineapple, eat it plain!  The muffins have their own unique taste, and I give it an all around thumbs up.

These were wonderful!  So light and fluffy.  I think the key here as to what type of pineapple flavor one ends up with is the quality of the pineapple used.  I had a fresh pineapple that was about 2 weeks old and in need of being used it.  Wt. was 4 oz. on my kitchen scale once I got it cut up.  It was not real juicy and since recipe stated to use undrained pineapple, I just threw it in my food processor and rough cut.  Did add 1 tsp. vanilla and used 1:1 brown/white sugar.  The pineapple was very sweet and even with the 1 cup total sugar, it was not sickening sweet.  Very full flavor of pineapple.  If using canned, I think I would use pineapple tidbits.  I did add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and could not taste the cinnamon really.  I suppose that is a good thing, as it did not overpower the flavor of the pineapple.

These muffins tasted nothing like pineapple and that is what I was looking for, a really good bread recipe with a pineapple flavor.  I agree, they did have  taste of their own, they were alright, but they shouldn't be called pineapple puffs.  Perhaps more pineapple or pineapple juice would do the trick.

Made these because my kids love pineapple.  They wouldn't touch them.  There was no flavor of the pineapple.  A waste of my time.

Nice and sweet with a soft texture.  However, their was very little pineapple flavor.
I gave it 4 stars because this is in the kids recipe section and it is easy enough for kids to do most of the work and is kid-sweet.  They don't care about the pineapple flavor but just enjoyed being part of the team.  I would make it again because of them.

These are really great pineapple muffins.  I read the reviews prior to baking these sweet treats and learned that some people didn't feel there was enough pineapple flavor.  I used a 19 oz. can of crushed pineapple (less some of the juice)instead of the 8 oz. can called for and was extremely pleased with the results.  Also, I doubled the cinnamon in the recipe and added about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  These are great muffins, Debbie.....thank you for sharing!

I thought these muffins were just right. I used margarine, unsweetened pineapple and a little coconut. Great milk-less recipe if using margarine. If you want 200% pineapple flavor eat a pineapple.

Made this last night with some modifications and it was awesome.  Based on reviews I increased the amount of pineapple, added crushed pecans and vanilla, and substituted half the sugar with brown sugar.  Next time I'll probably add even more pineapple, but very moist and tastes great!  I really like the texture that the pecans added.

As others have stated, not a LOT of pineapple taste in these but I still liked them.  Worth a go if you have extra pineapple to use up, like I did.

An all around good muffin but an EXCELLENT base muffin.  I've used this nice, sweet muffin as my base recipe for throwing in anything sweet I'd like to add to a muffin . . . chips, bananas, blueberries, whatever.  I think I'm trying peanut butter next.  I think you'll like this one.
PS  VERY kid-friendly too.  My 3 year old loves to help cook and this one is just right for her to help.

These turned out awesome!! I read in some of the comments that the pineapple flavor wasn't very strong, so I used chunked pineapple instead and then put 1 chunk in the center of each puff. I also added a brown sugar/cinnamon glaze on top half way through the baking process. Also, I greased the muffin pan with coconut oil. They came out perfectly delicious!

Delicious!! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all- purpose for some density. I also add 4 tablespoons of shredded coconut, 4 tablespoons of applesauce and 1/4c of candied cherries. Wonderfully moist muffin that I can’t stop eating.

Great recipe. Muffins were very flavorful but didn't hold together well, probably because my fresh pineapple was just about puréed. I'll make these again and  add nuts.

Easy to make recipe. I whizzed the wet ingredients in my food processor & then stirred in the flour mix.  As recommended by other reviewers, I doubled the pineapple and used half brown sugar. I was happy with the flavor of the muffins. Next time I will add some vanilla too.

Made these axactly as the recipe says. They weren't very pineapply and they crumbled apart in my hand after about a day or so out on my counter. I might try to candy my pineapple and use that instead next time oh and keep them in a sealed container so they stay as dry as possible.

Good but needed a kick of something. I tried extra cinnamin, but it tasted more like apple cinnamin muffins.

I agree with the majority.  Wonderful muffin.  The pineapple makes it moist, not pineappley.  Added pecans as a reviewer suggested.

We loved these!  I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger to help boost the pineapple flavor, and they were great!  we like muffins a little bigger, though, so I will probably fill the cups a little fuller and just not get as many.  This recipe's a keeper!
