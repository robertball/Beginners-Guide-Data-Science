This was an easy breakfast meal for a Sunday morning, with a couple adjustments. Which, I would rather not do so the recipe stays like the cook intended. However, to make it easier, I used crescent rounds from pillsbury, just unroll and lay flat. I changed the baking pan to 9x9 and did not precook the eggs. Precooking I thought, would make the eggs get too hard.  And , I only used 6 eggs. 
With that all said, cook your sausage pour over crescents, pour in 6 eggs and cover with cheese. Bake for 35-40 minutes. 
Tasted great, served it up with sour cream and salsa verde.

Delicious! I made this recipe, with a few alterations (as others suggested), and it turned out great. We had it on Thanksgiving morning. The only thing I think I'll change in the future is to go back to hashed browns for the base, rather than crescent rolls. The pastry is fine, but potatoes are nicer in a breakfast casserole I think.

So easy! I used a 9oz bag of frozen sausage crumbs instead and added half a red onion. People ate it up! Original Pillsbury crescent rolls easily roll-out and lay flat. Like most , this recipe can be adapted for anyone's choice of "toppings". I will add spinach and sun dried tomatoes next time.

An easy recipe and the family loved it!  I did make a few modifications like some other reviewers. I used only 8 eggs, heated up some frozen hash browns and added those to the sausage. After baking for 25 minutes, I added some lightly cooked fresh spinach leaves along with some of the shredded cheese I left in reserve. Baked it another 10 minutes, for a total cooking time of 35 minutes. Served with fruit.

I reserved 1/2 of the cheese to sprinkle on top during last 15 minutes of baking.  Also, I added red bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms (fine dice) to the mixture.  

A big hit!

I was looking for a recipe to use up my boar sausage! My daughter loves breakfast for dinner she asks for it at least once a week. I love to look for ways to change it up. It gets old after a while! Thank you!

Turned out great, followed the recipe fairly closely and served a whack of people with it.  works well for a group breakfast because it can do it's time in the oven while you're cooktop items.

I didn't make any changes since I have only made it once. I used ground sausage that had no added flavor to it and it was bland. Next time I will add onions to the sausage or use Italian sausage for better flavor. I loved being able to cut a piece off everyday and pop in the microwave. I will be making this again in the future, especially if I have overnight company. I was afraid they would be overcooked but they were just right.

This turned out soooo good. Even my really picky eater came back for seconds. I only had 8 eggs on hand and not quite two cups of cheese but it didnâ€™t hurt the outcome. Since I was missing the 4 eggs, I had some breakfast potatoes (about a cup) on hand and added that with some garlic salt. This is a very forgiving recipe with the ingredients. Highly recommended!

This was a great casserole. I wanted to make a breakfast to last a week and wanted to reduce the calories a bit. So, I used reduced calorie  croissants and turkey sausage. It came out great and was very fulling with all of tb6e protein. Will definitely be making this again.

This was good, but needs more flavor.  If I make this again, I'll add diced green chilie.
