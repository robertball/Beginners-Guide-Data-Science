Very elegant recipe, appropriate for fancy dinner parties.  I had difficulty removing the brie coating, but the mix of flavors was superb and worth the effort.  I used fresh mushrooms without a problem, and also substituted apple jack flavored brandy.  Be careful not to burn the almonds when toasting - they brown quickly if left on a high heat.

Wonderful but next time I will use less or no butter since the oil from the cheese plus the butter makes it very oily.  Flavor is wonderful!  I will make it again!

This was fabulous!  I made this along with several other appetizers on Christmas Eve and this went first.  I had several requests for this recipe and will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Fantastic center piece to my buffet table!  I did cut the amount of butter in half because I knew from experience how much fat Brie can release when baked.  You don't have to buy the most expensvive Brie out there, I had very good sucess with Presidental Brie which costs between $10-$15 a wheel.

Fabulous! Don't bother removing the white coating, it's completely edible, although a bit stronger, it's delicious! I served this with some homemade toast points for our anniversary and it was such a special appetizer! Now I buy brie cheese in bulk so I can make it often!

This was delicious!  I used Canola Harvest, fresh mushrooms and a clove of garlic and it was a HUGE hit.  Served with Triscuits to keep to our South Beach Diet.  Did need to bake about 15 minutes longer to completely melt the Brie, but worth the wait!  Everyone wanted the recipe!!

so good, I served this at my super bowl party and it was the first thing to disappear, and I made a double batch! Next time I am going to add more almonds, because I could barley tell they were in there.

Although the flavor was good it was VERY greasy.  If I make this recipe again I would completely omit the butter.

I've made this several times for dinner at home or to bring to parties and it's been very well-received. I've always used fresh mushrooms, which I would suggest since it adds no time to the recipe and tastes great. I do often add a bit extra brie or cut back on the mushrooms though, because 8 oz. is a lot for one wheel of cheese. I also once added fresh diced tomatoes on top after cooking, which improved the presentation greatly but didn't really have a huge effect on the flavor.

This was ok for the first time trying it...I would reduce the butter, and figure out how to reduce the saltiness just a tad.

I used ground almonds instead of slivers- I prefer the texture. Also, I'm a garlic lover so I used a lot more garlic but I roasted it so it would not overpower. And I'm not big on canned mushrooms, so I went for fresh oyster mushrooms- they have such a light, nutty flavour that they were perfect with the brie and almonds. Finally, I baked it pizza-style on a homemade thin-crust (I cut the butter as some reviewers suggested- a good call, I think)... and cracked some fresh pepper over it before serving. Oh my dear god, it was glorious. I will definitely make this again. If you're not a fan of mushrooms, try it with thinly sliced pear, apple or strawberry. You will love it.

One word...awesome! I brought this for Christmas dinner, and it went within 5 minutes. If you are making for a large group, or any party over 5, be sure to double.

This was amazing and so easy.  I did cut back on the butter and used fresh mushrooms, not sure why anyone would used canned.  Can't wait to make it again it was a huge hit with our guests.  Nice to know that it can be varied a bit with different brandy's and mushrooms etc., just for a change now and then.

This was delicious!  I used sliced portabella and the flavor was great-everyone agreed.  Next time will leave the butter out as the top did become too greasy.  No need to add extra fat when using brie!

I made this with lots of almonds and mushrooms and garlic, some tarragon, a pinch of nutmeg.  And I used Cognac instead of brandy  - poured it on an opened log of brie and baked it - wonderful!  Thanx for the recipe!

Fantastic! sauteed some baby bellas instead of canned shrooms. Really wonderful. Don't add as much butter as the recipe says and make sure not to burn the almonds.

I made this over the holidays when my boyfriends family came to visit.  We had it in the middle of a domino's game. This was so good.  Everyone was raving about it.  We put the game on hold to gobble it up.  I did make some adjustments, I didn't have the almonds so I put walnuts in.  I also added some sundried tomatoes.  I served it with some Nonna garlic toasts from Costco.  I can't wait to make it again!!!

I made this for Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner.  Everyone raved about it.  In fact, my sister-in-law asked for the recipe and
made it at our next family gathering.

This brie recipe was absolutely delicious and was perfect for our low carb dinner! I enjoyed every bite of it! We did change the recipe using fresh mushrooms (cremini) instead of canned ones, other than that kept it the same. We will make this delicious recipe again!!

OMG!  This is more than 5 Stars!  Words fail me - I love to find something different for parties - I almost ate all of it before my guests arrived!  I did not change the recipe - I did use Presidental Brie and Hennessy Cognac (Cognac is a fine brandy).  It would probably be good with an Apple Flavored brandy.  There were no leftovers as we all hovered over the dish until nothing was left.  I served with toast points. I'm having a family dinner in a few days and can't wait to serve this again!!! maybe with some apple slices and Triscuts or toast points.  Thank you so much Amy!  We love it!

I made this recipe Christmas day and it was a HUGH success!  I did not remove the coating (I think it gives the brie better flavor) and didn't use tarragon.  Some folks said they could do without the almonds.  My niece made it the next day for a gathering she was hosting!  I will definitely be making this dish frequently!

Don't use canned mushrooms folks,those of you who found it greasy, the fresh mushrooms will absorb the butter. This recipe is fabulous. It's a treat, don't worry about the extra calories.

This was really bad.  It was slimy and overpowering with tarragon.  It's not appetizing looking either.  Don't bother with this one.

This recipe was very good and was easy to make.  The only reason why I gave this 3 stars is because I probably would want to try cooking something else before I did this recipe again.  But if you are a cheese fan you really can't go wrong with this.

I didn't add any butter and used fresh mushrooms but it was still swimming in oil.  It might work if it was wrapped in puff pastry to absorb the extra oil, but as written I would not make again.

Like a lot of people, I made a couple of changes.  I did not have almonds on hand....subsituted walnuts. Nor did I have any brandy...skipped it altogether. What I ended with was a savoury melted brie with mushrooms, and the nuts, was wonderful for our Sunday lunch served with Port. Life is good.

This recipe is a smash hit, a show stopper. I make one small change with the almonds. I toast them and sprinkle them on top when ready to serve. That way the almonds stay crunchy, not soggy. I have never served this appetizer without EVERYONE asking for the recipe.  Easy to make. Enjoy!!

I had no idea what to expect when I made this. The cheese and everything melted together. I toasted some sourdough bread and ate it with that. It was a total hit my friends and I couldn't stop eating it.

We went to a Christmas party hosted by a delicious restaurant and brought the appetizers.  I was intimidated, but the reviews were true to their word!  This was fabulous and even got rave reviews from the head chef!  Definitely will make again.

This came out OK.  I probably let it sit a bit too long before serving...but in general, people didn't seem too thrilled with the mushrooms and didn't find it to be anything too special.  Baked brie is always good...so this was still nice...but not much different overall.

I made this for Valentines Day and I added chopped sundried tomatoes and I did not have Brandy instead I used Grand Mar and it was a success!
