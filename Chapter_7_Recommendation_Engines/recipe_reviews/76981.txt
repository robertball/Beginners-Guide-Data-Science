This meal is great and I have cooked it many times now.  The only change is instead of using tomato sauce and chicken broth, I just buy a can of premade enchilada sauce.  Being in Florida, we have a lot of great Latino products at the grocery.  It saves time, and the flavor is a bit bolder.  I also mix some of the sauce in with the chicken, bean, and cheese mixture.  Excellent!

I used the leftovers from a whole chicken for this one, and light red kidney beans. I think next time I'll go with pintos instead. I will make this again. The family loved it.

This was excellent.  These were the best enchiladas I've ever made. The only thing I'd change would  be to maybe add a little salt and pepper for flavor.  I loved the sauce and made it again added a little parmesan cheese and served it to guests as a low fat tomato alfredo sauce.  This one is a keeper.

I boiled a whole chicken for this recipe then used some of that for this.  You couldn't taste the beans very well, so I might add another half can or so next time.  I didn't read the directions very carefully and added all the cheese to the chicken mixture.  To speed this up, you could use tomato paste instead of boiling down the tomato sauce.  Yum, yum!  I will be making this again!

These are excellent.  My son picked these for his 9 year birthday dinner.  I did use flour tortillas and added the sauce after baking awhile so they wouldn't get soggy.  I didn't have roasted chicken, so I grilled up some chicken breast seasoned with garlic and white pepper.  I also used low sodium chicken broth, Mexican chili beans, added some sharp cheddar cheese, and added both chipolte and green chile powder for kick.  Next time I'm going to use tomatoes and green chiles for some of the tomato sauce.

Great recipe! I recommend adding some spices to the tomato sauce; I added chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, & tarragon. Everyone in the family liked it!

As written, this recipe would have been quite bland for our tastes. I used mexican seasonings with this, a can of condensed bean and bacon soup and enchilada sauce rather than tomato sauce.

These are easy and amazingly good enchiladas...but with no added seasoning I thought they may be slightly bland for my taste. So I mixed hot chile beans (undrained) with turkey (smoked deli turkey) and cheese for the enchilada filling.  Added a little chipotle powder to the tomato sauce for extra smoky flavor.  Mmm.

This was a nice variation from more traditional enchiladas. They were very flavorful and filling. They freeze well, too.

I thought this was great! I used one cup of pepper jack and one cup of cheddar instead of two cups of pepper jack, and I also was not able to find corn tortillas in the size suggested, so I used flour tortillas. I will definitely be making this again!

Some will disagree with me for giving five stars to a recipe that I changed, but I did not change the integrity of the dish. Instead of rotisserie chicken, I cooked my own boneless, skinless chicken breasts wrapped in foil in the oven with rotisserie seasoning. I shredded those and proceeded with the recipe. I also added some jarred salsa in place of part of the tomato sauce. These were simple and delicious and make a quick weeknight meal. I served them with cole slaw; we'll be adding them to our regular rotation.

Other than adding a heaping tablespoon of jalapeno peppers (canned), I followed the recipe to the T and to my surprise, it was EZ, extremely tasty, and best of all, went over huge with the fam.

This was a big hit at our house!  I generally only review a recipe if I did not change a thing and still loved it, but in this case, I went ahead and cooked the chicken breasts myself--not much of a change!  I also doubled it, and froze one 13x9 pan.  I am so glad I did!  This is a terrific recipe, exactly as it stands.

I make all sorts of enchiladas varying week by week. This recipe was the best by far! I skipped the pepper jack got a bag of kraft mexican shredded cheese, added a can of mild red enchilada sauce, 8 oz of tom. sauce, some chicken broth and pinto beans. My husband loved it!!!

This is an excellent recipe as it is, however we like our enchiladas a little more moist. I added 2 11oz cans of red enchilada sauce to the tomato/chicken broth mix and reduced by 1/2 in about 15 min. over med high heat. this makes more sauce for  chicken/bean/cheese filling and  the baking dish

We really enjoyed this. We fought over the leftovers, which in my house it is usually a fight to make us eat leftovers. We will enjoy this dish again soon! Didn't need to change a thing, it is great the way it is. My husband adds spicy pepper cheese to his to give it an extra flare. Yummy!

These were the most delicious enchiladas I have ever made.  I never would have thought about adding rotisserie chicken; but that really is the key to each juicy flavorful bite.  I added some green onions and black olives to the top, which provided a nice kick.

This was SO unbelievably good.  It took a bit longer than I expected (2+ hrs), but it was enthralling, and worth every minute.  The taste was just perfect.  I did add chili powder, diced spicy green pepper, and a splash of cayenne to give it a little kick.  But there's something about the way this sauce is prepared that just seals the deal on this recipe.   To save time going forward, I'll prepare the sauce the night before.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Ok, so I started making this recipe, used roasted chicken, red beans, grated cheese and 1 cup of sour cream, used green onions instead of plain onions, added a small can of corn, a small can of enchiladas sauce, 1/2 jar of salsa, jalapeno peppers, mixed all ingredients in a bowl, filled the tortillas, topped with a blend of TexMex Kraft cheese, in the oven at 325 for 50 minutes. Ok, I agree, it's not the same recipe but the base was great, I just added what I felt like having... which is what is great about this recipe, you can make it your own!

This is a great recipe because you can make it with what you have in your pantry.  I roasted a chicken in the crock pot and used that.  I also used a can of tomatoes with green chiles (rotel) that I pureed in the blender with chili powder.  I didn't have pepper jack cheese so I used a combination of american cheese slices, fat free cream cheese and mozzarella.  It was still very yummy. 

Really, this recipe is great because you can take it and make it your own!

These were great, but I did make changes. I halved the recipe since it was only me and my husband. I used pinto beans instead of kidney beans. I used monterrey jack instead of pepper jack because I didn't have any of the latter. Diced the half onion instead of slicing some of it. I used one 15 oz jar enchilada sauce instead of chicken broth and tomato sauce, and omitted sour cream since I didn't have any. Next time I'd use a smaller baking dish since I halved the recipe.

I took another reviewer's advice (fellow Floridian!) and used enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce and chicken broth.  I subbed cheddar for half the pepper jack and used chili beans.  Everyone wolfed it down!

Great way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken.  We loved it.  I used a 15 oz can of enchilada sauce (try an authentic brand, not old el paso)simmered with onion and a can of tomatoes.  Then threw in some corn too as well as listed ingredients.  I also quick-fried the tortillas for a few seconds in a skiller with a bit of oil, but not sure if this is worth the trouble.  Gives them a very nice crispy chewy texture but may be lost after dousing in enchilada sauce!   Either way we loved it and will be trying again soon.

This was great!  I am not a good cook, but I stuck with it and it was delicious.  It is a bit spicy because of the pepperjack cheese.

Very good.  Made without cheese to cut back on fat and didn't miss it.  I added hot sauce to the tomato sauce mixture and liked the heat it added.  Thanks for a yummy, easy, healthy recipe.

These were a hit at our house! I added spices to the tomato mixture as per previous suggestions (Cumin, Chili powder, salt, pepper), as well as added corn which was a great addition! Without the corn, I think it would have been too plain. I also used Monterey cheese and cheddar in the enchiladas, and provolone on the top before baking. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

Outstanding - I will now always buy a second rotisserie chicken so we can make this dish.  I used black beans b/c I had them on hand, and prefer them to red, and used flour tortillas for same reason - these were the best enchiladas I've ever made.  A keeper for sure.

I've made these a couple of times, the first time just as written and then I modified it for our tastes and for convienience, both are good but just a tip in  the recipie as written the tomato sauce/chicken broth mixture never really got as thick as I had wanted so the enchiladas were a bit soggy, GOOD but soggy, and the next time I used black beans and canned enchilada sauce... and they were amazing. Thank you for sharing this, I will be making them again.

Very good. My whole family enjoyed it. I didn't have pepper jack cheese, so I used what I had which was cheddar jack. Very mild, perfect for kids. However, I think I will make again using the pepper jack cheese. In addition to the suggested toppings, I served our enchiladas with olives, tomatoes and sour cream. Very simple, but tasty.

Instead of making the sauce, I mixed a 1/2 can of enchilada sauce with 1 can Rotella (green chiles and tomatoes drained) and heated it up. The I mixed with black beans, chicken and cheddar cheese. Also sprinkled with tomato sauce and cheddar and mozarella on top. Delicious! Made with Mexican Rice as a side, delicious!

This was really good - a keeper that I'll make again.  I did use a rotisserie chicken and that was the perfect amount.  I used a can of mild enchilada sauce and added some chicken broth to that as well as chopping up a couple chipotle chiles in adobo sauce and adding to the sauce and onions.  Using a 9x13 pan, I got 10 enchiladas.  If you use a larger lasagna pan, you could get 12.  I also combined the pepper jack cheese and co-jack for a little more flavor.  To top it off, I used chopped cilantro and chopped green onions.

We liked this casserole very much.  I followed the original recipe except I used refried beans instead of red beans and I only used about 3/4 of the can. I didn't use raw onions or cilantro on top but had sour cream available as a topping. It was plenty spicy with the "Helluva Good" brand Monterey Jack with Jalapeno cheese. I really liked the sauce.  There was just enough of all the ingredients to make the dish.  By the way, our Maltese dog loved it too and wanted more.

HOW TO DO THIS IN 30 MINUTES.....Thank you for saving me tonight. Rotisserie chicken is my "back-up" but I've had to use my "back-up" way to much lately that is why I was so happy to find this recipe. I had to alter it so it was ready in 30 minutes flat and it was still outstanding. Here is what I did...I pulled half the meat from the bone and put in the bowl with the cheese and a can of chili style pinto and red kidney beans. Mixed it up. I opened a can of tomato sauce and a can of mushroom soup mixed them together. I spread 1/3 of the mixture in the bottom of the pan, 1/3 into the filling and 1/3 I used later on the top. I was sure we'd miss the onion so I cut some green onion and sprinkled on top once the enchiladas were assembled. That took maybe 10 minutes and they were cooked in 20. WOW.....the kids loved it, my husband loved it and there is still some left for lunch tomorrow plus I still have half the meat from the chicken to make something with tomorrow night. I'm thinking something Thai...maybe I'll try My Thai Chicken Wraps from this site.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used a left over rotisserie chicken.  I did not put enough tomato sauce mixture on the bottom of my 13x9 pan and the enchiladas got stuck.  I was afraid they would come out soggy.  Next time I would put more sauce on the bottom of the pan and a little more on top of the enchiladas.   Othere than that they were very good.

Sauce needs seasoning (I added about 1 Tbsp chili powder and 2 tsp cumin, which was OK, but still not really flavorful).  Used black beans, as well as extra cheese.  Didn't add raw onion (dislike) or cilantro (didn't have) to the finished product and didn't miss them.  A nice hearty family meal.  Served with sour cream and hot sauce (for those of us who wanted to kick it up a bit).

Although I made a few changes to fit my taste buds, this recipe is delicious. I skipped the bean; replaced the tomato sauce with one large can of Red enchilada sauce and the chicken broth with half a can of the green enchilada sauce. I added the other half of the green enchilada sauce to the filling.  I made flavored rice (chicken bouillon and a few scoops of the red sauce) and poured it on the bottom of the baking dish and placed the enchiladas and sauce on top.  My husband said that these were the best enchiladas he has ever had. Thank you so much for sharing!

This is a good base recipe, but would have been a little too bland for us without some tweaking. I used red beans and after tasting the mixture, it wasn't too flavorful. I added a healthy dose of cumin, some lime-infused salt, and a few shakes of taco seasoning. I used tomato paste instead of sauce, added 2 cloves of garlic, lots of chili powder, cumin, and black pepper. Turned out very well. I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and still got 10 enchiladas that were stuffed to the max. Thank you :)

This was really good and even my picky kids loved it.  I think next time I would increase the amount of chicken and slightly reduce the amount of sauce as there was quite a bit left over...other than that, this was a great way to use up leftover chicken.

I made this recipe as is, except to add the whole rotisserie chicken (shredded) and I added a 4 oz. can of chopped hot green peppers.  This is my favorite enchilada recipe now and I've tried a whole lot and some that are much more time-intensive than this.  This is a winner.  Thank you!!!!

This was good.  I made some changes to adjust for flavor. I grilled about 3/4lb of skinless, boneless chicken tenders. I put adobo seasoning on them before I grilled them.  I added a can of chopped green chilies to the chicken and bean mixture.  And I chopped the onion up and added half of it to the chicken mixture.  Instead of tomato sauce I used two 10oz cans of Enchilada sauce.  I opened one can, mixed in 1tbs of sour cream and 1/4 of the chopped onion.  I spread half of it in the bottom of the baking pan and then added the other half to the chicken mixture.  I rolled my enchiladas and baked them for about 12-15 mins.  Then I mixed the second can of Enchilada sauce with another Tbs of sour cream and the rest of the onion.  This I poured over the enchiladas and topped with the remaining cheese.  I baked the enchiladas for another 7 mins.  They were really yummy and flavorful.

Yummy! Made these for dinner tonight but forgot to take a pic. I baked up boneless chicken breasts seasoned with salt, chili powder and cumin and then pulled with a fork. I also added a small can of mild green chilies to the chicken and bean mixture. This would be a great make-ahead recipe (make enchilada sauce and chicken/bean mixture ahead of time) and assemble for a quick weekday dinner.

this was boring, sorry.  I thought it would have some zing with all of the pepper jack cheese, but it didn't.

This was a nice spin on an old favorite.   Some changes I have made... I grilled chicken breasts and shredded them and instead of tomato sauce I use a can of enchilada sauce and simmer it with the sauteed onions and broth. My family prefers the kidney beans to be slightly mashed but a little chunky.  Another portion of a can of enchiladas sauce may be needed for the top with shredded cheddar cheese added the last 5-8 minutes of baking.

Yummy! I used the recipe as a starting point. The adjustments I made were to use about 3/4 can black beans and a cup each of corn and salsa. I mixed them with the chicken and cheese. Instead of tomato sauce and chicken broth I used a can of enchilada sauce. The rest of the recipe was as written, but I did not top with the remaining cheese. I garnished with green onions and black olives. This basic recipe is fantastic to use as an idea starter!

Didn't want to overwhelm the youngun's sensibilities, so I opted for Monterey Jack instead of Pepper Jack.  Great recipe!  They LOVED this!  I think I will add some green chiles next time, just cause I like 'em.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make these with black beans--they're not as mealy.  Absolutely love the sauce--I don't care for the stuff in the can from the store.  Who knew it could be so easy?  Easy to add spice to taste.

As a lot of other reviewers mentioned, the sauce would have been very bland as written.  I added cumin, garlic powder, pepper and some red pepper flakes and we still felt it was missing something.   The sauce also turned out very thin for me... next time I'd use half the amount of chicken broth, maybe less.  With a few modifications, these have the potential to be quite tasty.  Will try again!!

This was a great recipe!  I could not find the corn tortillas in the larger size & the package I bought only had 10 in it so I was able to make due with th e 10.  They were stuffed full & the with extra meat I just filled in between the rolled tortillas. I took the advice another reviewer & used the tomato paste instead of sauce but I thought it was too thick so I found a can of enchilada sauce & used 1/2 of the can to loosed it up a bit.  I garnished with cilantro & then had black olives,lettuce,sour cream, onions, salsa & pickled jalepenos on the table for the family to add what they wanted.  I think it could've used some heat but since I wanted the whole famly to enjoy I opted for adding the heat at the table. Very good!

I actually love this recipe but have made some personal changes. I love using rotiserrie chicken; saves so much time. I found El Paso Enchilada Sauce in a can at my local supermarket. I use flour tortillas because I have never tried corn; I am more used to using flour ones.  Sargento's has a low-fat Mexican shredded cheese blend that works great with this dish. I use black beans and corn; they are delicioso!!!

This turned out to be very yummy.  I used rotisserie chicken and the only thing I did differently is I used less onions.

These were good. Everyone said they liked them. I would recommend using something other than kidney beans just for the way it looks. I did find it a bit more labor intensive than it first appeared.

this was really good!  I added a couple cloves of garlic and ended up using spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce, but it was delicious.....my 6 yr old loved it!
