This was a great new take on potato salad! There's so many different flavors going on throughout it. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the dill. I find it very overwhelming and was worried it would be too much, so I only used half the amount and you could definitely taste it but it wasn't too much. Also I used the bigger yellow potatoes, because they were cheaper, and just quartered them before boiling them.

Very close to how I make mine, only I use my Zesty Ranch Dip, thinned down with a little lowfat buttermilk. With the salt in the dip and the cheese, I don't add extra. This potato salad ALWAYS disappears. Make sure to bring copies of the recipe if you make it for a potluck.

Loved it!! A great change from the regular potato salad with an explosion of taste and texture. Glad summer is almost here.  I will make it often for sure.

Nice potato salad and I liked the ranch rather than mayo.  I didn't use broccoli and I was out of bacon, although I'm sure the bacon would have made it even better!  I cut the recipe in half and then only used 3/4 tsp of dill and that was plenty.  Also didn't use any salt.  We liked it a lot.

For those that like Broccoli Salad and Potato Salad this is the best of both worlds. My husband and brother devoured it and looked for more a sure sign it's a hit! Thanks so much for sharing.

My family really didn't like this potato salad. My boys ate it, but they dumped barbecue sauce on it to "kill" the taste.  I was surprised, because I was hoping they'd like the ranch dressing base. They love ranch dressing on salads, but it didn't work for them with the other ingredients.  Sorry.

Very, very good!  We scaled for 20 servings and used fresh broccoli florets and turkey bacon. Donâ€™t add salt & enjoy!

Fantastic! I used half Lite Ranch and half regular and added a little bit of red onion for crunch. I will never go back to mayo and relish potato salad again. The broccoli was great and the cheddar was subtle. I will make this all summer long.

Awesome! My entire family LOVED it but I did change the recipe a tiny bit. I didn't have everything this recipe called for but was in the mood for potato salad. (So) My version of it is whatever type of potatoes I had,  6 hard boiled eggs,  ranch dressing,  salt,  paprika, bacon n pickles. OMG YUM! The bacon n pickles mixed w everything else is absolutely amazing.

Quick and easy! Didn't have broccoli so I used peas.  Used half the ingredients for the family and estimated on the ranch dressing because I didn't want it saturated.

used celery instead of broccoli (personal preference) and added some green onion. Delicious! Have received lots of compliments :)
