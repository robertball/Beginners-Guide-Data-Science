Having eaten this for years it is easily one of my all time favorite top 5 foods. Don't worry about the crepe mixture being too thin, the ingredients are spot on. Just make sure you only add a thin layer to the pan. Be sure to read the 'Cooks Notes' since this is a very versatile recipe. Adding the pork to the shrimp really ups the recipe.  My Vietnamese is a bit rusty but Banh Xeo translates to sizzling cake or in this case sizzling crepes.

OMG these are so addictive. I used tofu and mushrooms instead of shrimp. Simply fresh and delicious! I used superfine Thai white rice flour as well as brown rice flour. Both times I needed a bit more water, but with the brown rice I needed about one whole cup of water. I had to use soy instead of fish sauce due to allergies.
