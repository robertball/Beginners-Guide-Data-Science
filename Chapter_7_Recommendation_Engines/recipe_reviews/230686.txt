I stumbled upon this looking for a crowd pleasing last minute dessert for a casual dinner party.  I'm glad I did, as it was a big hit.  I prepped both the filling and the topping the day before and left in the frig until I was ready to assemble/bake before dinner.  I wanted individual portions, so I used ramekins w/no issue.  I baked for about 30-35 minutes and served w/a scoop of ice cream.  I used Granny Smith apples, per personal preference.  I can definately see this getting made again at the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, Ashley Tex!

This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half for our small family and baked in an 8x8 pan. Made homemade whipped cream to top it with. Will make again!

The topping needs something to moisten it. Halfway through baking it was still just dry flour. I tried mixing it in . The outcome as mediocre.

Make it every week and love it. I cut down the 2 sugars in the apple mixture to an 1/8th of a cup each and use frozen thawed (and patted dry) blueberries.

Easy and delish!  Had more apples than blueberries on hand and only 1stick of butter, but made due using this recipe as a guide.  Loved it!

I had canned apple pie filling that needed used up and wanted to try something different than just a pie. So I just used the topping portion of this recipe and it was wonderful! My husband has  asked for seconds so I call that a win!

I substituted half the white sugar with honey. Very tasty and easy. Picky husband loved it with strawberry ice cream.

I used more apples and less frozen blueberries, just because I did not have enough blueberries.  It was a little juicy but delicious.  I will certainly make it again.

I made this for dessert with blueberries and apples I needed to use up. Family and guests loved it!!  The only thing I did differently is use regular flour as I had no whole wheat on hand and I cut in the butter in the topping. Left it to bake for 40 minutes, but the edges were a little darker than I would have liked. Next time I will make sure to check it at 35 minutes.
