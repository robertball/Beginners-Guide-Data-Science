Turned out bland. I don't think I let it marinade long enough or didn't use enough ingredients (I'm thinking double the ingredients.) Will definitely try again. Was good, cooked perfectly.

Delicious!!! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except for the green onions, because I forgot to pick some up when I was shopping. I will definitely make it again, next time with the green onions!

This didn’t have as much oomph as I had hoped for.  I’m not sure if it needed some ginger or a longer marinating time.

I sliced my steak thinly before adding to the marinade, hoping it would absorb the flavors more quickly. Worked. I stir fried some cabbage, mushrooms, and sugar snaps in the extra marinade and added a few lo mein noodles. Excellent!

One of our favorite recipes!  We absolutely love it!!  Serve it with an Asian side salad and baked potatoes.  This is one of our “treat” dinners because feeding a family of 6 with teenagers, there never seems to be enough steak!  I have to double this every time and we still have zero leftovers.

Turned out amazing. I recommend after a few min of cooking slice steak into strips and let cool for another 1-2 min

This was delicious. I didn't quite have enough mustard and I forgot to buy green onions, so I added a pinch of onion powder and a pinch of ginger. Otherwise I made it just like the recipe. Really good! Just don't overlook.
