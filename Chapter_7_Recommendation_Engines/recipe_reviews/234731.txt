This is delicious frosting, but the recipe is not enough to frost a whole cake, only a pan of brownies maybe. Double the recipe if you want to do a whole cake.

I like very view icing, but this one is good.  Tastes like maple fudge.

This was good and really easy to make. I used a bit more butter (about 1/3 cup) and 1/4 cup milk. It was really sweet to taste by itself but worked really well on the butter pecan cake I made.

This has been my favorite flavored frosting for years and this recipe did not disappoint. My granddaughter used it to make my birthday cake. It was absolutely delicious!

This recipe was a great jumping-off point! I didn't have enough confectioners sugar so I just used what I had. The texture was a little weird (I think because I didn't have enough sugar) so I used half + half instead of milk and whipped it in my KitchenAid until it was fluffy. I added a little salt and a bunch of cinnamon for a snickerdoodle kind of taste-- it was great on top of a pumpkin chocolate cake! I'd like to try it again as written sometime when I have all the ingredients!
