This recipe is really easy and tastes great. Instead of tortellini I used Chicken/herb ravioli that I had in my freezer.  The spices give it a little kick too.  A keeper!

My husband and I love, loved, loved this soup. I changed it up a bit, just because of personal preferences. I used a combo of Navy and Pinto beans instead of kidney, I added a touch of potato flakes to thicken the broth a bit, and added shredded chicken breast for added protein. It was great. Thank you so much for this recipe it is a definite keeper.

This Happy Soup made all my picky eaters happy! I was looking for a tortellini soup recipe that didn't have tomatoes or mushrooms per my picky eaters. This one was perfect. I didn't have kidney beans so I used red beans. The red pepper flakes gave it a kick. Loved it.

This was OK, but it tasted to me like what it was - a bunch of different things dumped in a pot.  The flavors didn't blend enough.

I had to make this soup because I had tortellini in the fridge and the name is great!  I cooked (and subsequently refrigerated) my tortellini separately so we could have leftovers sans dissolved tortellini.  I also noticed that the broth in the recipe's one picture looks kind of creamy, so I added some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it up (about 1 cup).  I'm sure the soup is great as is, but it turned out really well this way, too and I plan to use the potato flakes again in the future because it gave it some good substance.  The only thing I will change is to use a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes because while we enjoyed the slight spiciness, the pepper flakes made us cough some.  It's true that the flavors of the soup are not complicated, but we thought everything went very well together and it's too easy not to make again.

This was such a quick and easy recipe to make! Especially with a toddler and infant underfoot! I too had all the ingredients on hand and we all enjoyed it with warm biscuits :)

Very good!  I used one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans and frozen mini ravioli instead of tortellini.  Result was very good!  Also, be careful not to cook the beans to long or it will make the broth a brown/grey color...not very eye appealing but it doesn't change the taste!  I

This soup is adaptable based on what you have in your pantry.  I used kidney beans and great northern beans, canned corn, and a combination of pastas to use up what we had. So my rating is based on those alterations. I didn't use the alterations to put my own mark on the recipe, just to use what I had around. I can imagine that the cheese-filled tortellini would elevate this recipe a lot. The next time I make Happy Soup, I'll make sure I use the cheese-filled tortellini and revise my rating if the added ingredient warrants it.

This a very lovely soup. I always favor soups with pure, light flavor, especially when you have a sick hubby to take care of! The name of this recipe says it all.

I made this as written and it turned out very bland, and very low on broth as well; quite unsouplike.  Added a couple broth cans full of water, more basil, thyme, some Old Bay, salt, pepper, oregano, a generous pinch of rosemary, and couple cloves of garlic.  Something was still lacking, the answer ended up being a chicken flavoring packet from a ramen-type soup.  I would think bouillon cubes would work as well.  Much better with the additions, but still disappointing.

What an easy yet delicious recipe!  I didn't have kidney beans, so substituted with black beans.  It darkened the broth, but tasted wonderful!

You want to add the tortellini last since it falls apart easily if overcooked.  Otherwise a very good soup

Super delicious! When I followed the recipe Infound that 5 cans of broth wasn't enough, so i added 2 more (16 ounce) cans of broth. I also added chicken and much more crushed red pepper and basil than the recipe called for. The added spices and chicken definitely added more flavor, i would highly recommend adding chicken. Turned out prime.
