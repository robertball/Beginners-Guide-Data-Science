This was great!  I tweaked it a bit with some suggestions from other reviews.  I added onion soup mix to the chicken soup.  I only used half a chopped onion and sauteed it with the ham.  I didn't have chicken, so used two cups of ham instead and used the frozen potatoes with onions and peppers.  Cooked 45 minutes instead of 30 and it really could have gone longer.  The chips on top are great, but next time I wont drizzle butter on it.  I dont think it needs it.

I took this to a church breakfast and it got rave reviews.  My son and I cannot eat eggs so this was perfect!  It was the only dish empty.  Thanks.

I added some sweet red pepper and green onion for color.

Served this at a bridal shower brunch and it was a hit!  The bride's mother asked for the recipe.  The onion did not cook through but the green onion I added did, so next time I will use just green onions.  I also omitted the chicken and used fat free sour cream.  The recipe card says it only makes 4 servings but yielded much more than that.  Overall...a quick, easy and delicious recipe that I just finished email to my mother-in-law.  Thank you!

I brought this to work for "food day" and it was the first thing to go.  Multiple people asked for the recipe.  It is great made just as the recipe directs however, next time I think I will use all ham and cream of asparagus soup.  It's a keeper!!

I took this to work and it was a definite hit.  I did add an envelope of onion soup mix to the sour cream instead of fresh onion. Thanks.

I liked the taste and it was easy. I didn't like the combination of chicken and ham, next time would use all ham. I didn't think I would like the potato chips but I did.

This is a great alternative to the typical breakfast casseroles.  I do not care for eggs or sausage, so I loved this recipe.  I served it for Christmas breakfast and again for a baby shower brunch.  Both times it was a very big hit!

I made it for dinner.  

I didn't have the chicken so I used ALL HAM instead.

I also used ALFREDO SAUCE instead of the chicken soup. I also added the SOUR CREAM.

I DEFROSTED the POTATOES in the microwave before mixing them into the recipe. (I only used half a bag since there is only 2 of us) I used the OBRIEN potatoes that have onions and PEPPERS already in them.  

I cut up and cooked a SWEET ONION in a little butter till soft.  I added that to the bowl and then cut in a couple of GREEN ONIONS for more flavor and color.

I threw in about a cup of leftover CORN kernels too. (I like the added color from the corn and the green onions)

Added just two shakes of crushed BLACK PEPPER.

I used CHEDDAR & MOZZERELLA cheese.  I mixed some into the recipe and then put the rest on the top. 

I COVERED the dish and baked it for 30 minutes.  I then uncovered it and baked it until it started to bubble and turn brown. (about 15 mins.)

I melted about 2 Tbls. of butter and mixed in about a cup of CRUSHED RITZ crackers.

I then sprinkled the buttered RITZ on top of the casserole...I baked it uncovered a little longer until the crumbs started to turn brown...about 5 minutes.  

I let it sit about 15 minutes before serving..It was YUMMY and just the right texture! 

I plan to use all chicken the next time! 

If I make this for breakfast I would probably try adding in two or three  eggs and use sausage for meat.

This recipe has ENDLESS possibilities!

Thanks for posting it!

THis is a terrific casserole that is very filling.  I've made it several times for family members and they all love it.  Sometimes I substitute sausage for the chicken to mix things up a bit.  I also use cornflakes instead of potato chips to try and lower the fat content.  It's GREAT no matter how you make it - way to go Susan!!

Everyone in my Sunday School not only raved about it but asked for the recipe. My husband picked this recipe and made it himself. But he is a good cook, but still is easy to make. A keeper.

wasn't very impressed with this recipe. Potatos were still raw tasting. Not really worth the time to make.

Loved it! I took advice and left off the extra butter but did add the chips, it was a surprisingly nice touch.  I made two substitutions:  french onion soup mix instead of an onion and turkey bacon instead of ham... fantastic!

This was good, needed to cook  longer than the 45 minutes, the potatoes  were very chewy and the onions still crunchy.  Very similar to the cheesy potatoes that I make for summer picnics.  I also followed the suggestions to use ritz cracker crumbs and bacon bits on top...liked that!!

Was not impressed.  I've made many breakfast casserole variations and this was my least favorite so far.  The chicken and ham combo was strange and didn't create a breakfasty flavor so I tried again with Sausage and bacon...still not good and not worth the calories that are in this thing.  The potatoe chips are out of place on a breakfast casserole and the sour cream was way too much.  The flavor is very bland...also the cook time on this is INCREDIBLY off unless the goal is uncooked potatoes.  I baked mine for over an hour and finally got the desired texture.  Not worth the effort unless you considerable change the recipe but adding more flavor with spices or a hot sauce if that's what you prefer. Loose the chips and butter...just add unnecessary fat and calories and not enough last or texture to matter.  Less sour cream and either double the ham or double the chicken but don't mix the two.  More cheese (I suggest a sharp cheddar for better flavor) and garlic or onion powder as well as the chopped onion (which by the way needs to be sauteed first if you stick with the original recipes).  I'll make my own version of this again but not the original recipe as written here.

use less sour cream, put cheese on top instead of potato chips. I used crackers. Possibly add onion soup mix to it. Saute onions in advance. Needed to cook longer - at least 15 minutes longer.

Very good and easy to prepare.  I also cooked it for almost an hour (it was filled to the top in my 9x13 pan) and also used the Ritz crackers on top.  Yum.  We are still eating leftovers.  Thanks for sharing.

I live in Iceland and cannot get hashbrown potatoes, so I substituted a locally available kind of diced potatoes, and this recipe is always a hit wherever it appears.  I have been asked for the recipe several times.  Instead of potato chips I use crushed Ritz crackers and then sprinkle crumbled bacon over the top.  Everyone loves it.

casserole was really good! my dad who is a chef, went back for more. the only thing i would change about the recipes is the onions. i'll saute them next time prior to adding them to the rest of the dish.

I took other's advice and left out the chips - but I imagine it would have been better with a crunchy topping. I cooked meat and onions a bit before adding, sour cream didn't smell right so I used some cream I had. I also took to heart opther comments it needed longer cooking time & I microwaved potatoes a bit before baking. YUM!

This has potential.  The biggest change I would make is this needs eggs.  Also the onion should be sauteed prior to cooking.  Definately some salt and pepper would be a nice addition.  I think this can be really good it was very easy too.

This dish was just okay.  No one really disliked it but no one really liked it that much either.  Everyone preferred the hash brown quiche that I had previously made from this site.  This dish just seemed kind of blah.  And I didn't like the idea of the potato chips/butter on top so I just used some extra cheese.  Probably won't make again.  Would only make if someone had egg allergies as this dish doesn't use eggs.

This is a very tasty breakfast dish.  My wife and I are still trying to get over the fact that chicken can be served with breeakfast.  Why not???  What are eggs after all?
This is a very good dish.

This was a great meal that was relatively easy to prepare. I omitted the chicken and potato chips/butter topping and used extra ham and French’s fried onion ring topping (the same used on the classic green bean casserole) instead. I also used less chopped onion in the actual dish. Very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

my husband, his best friend and my children seem to like it okay. they even went back for second helpings. as for me, i didn't particularly like the flavor. i used "simply potatoes", half regular and half fat free sour cream. i added a packet of onion soup and only half of the chopped onion. it does take longer to cook than the recipe suggest (about 15 minutes longer). i used ritz crackers instead of chips. basically, i used what i had hear in my pantry. i used 2 cups of ham instead of chicken (didn't have any here in the house). so all in all it is an okay recipe if you can taylor it to your tastes. i just wanted to use my leftover ham and whatever i had in the pantry. it is worth a try.

I found this trying to find a brunch casserole without eggs. I used hash browns with onion and peppers and didn't chop the onion and it was really easy. It will be a traditional offering for our Christmas morning brunch.

This is an excellent casserole.  But, is there anything that Rotel Tomatoes and Green Chilies can't make better?  I added a can (drained) and  3/4 cup of green pepper to this and used Lay's Sour Cream and Onion potato chips.  This gives the dish a little color and just enough kick.

Good and easy. Mine needed to cook more. So it was better the next day. I also used the potato mix with peppers and onions to save time. Yummy

I made this for Christmas brunch today and it was delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I think I'll make it again, but add some cooked scrambled eggs to it.  That's the only thing that would have improved it.

This recipe could work with some adjustments. Next time I would use half the hash browns and add in a vegetable. Spinach, broccoli, peppers, something. I didn’t use the butter so maybe that’s why this tasted so bland. Needs garlic powder or cayenne or something to give some flavor.

Took this to my Bible Study Fellowship this morning and got RAVES!  A half dozen ladies asked me for the recipe.  I prepared it exactly as the recipe called for.  I did use deli roasted chicken where it called for chicken.  Also used Bob Evans seasoned hash browns.

Very good and easy to prepare. I also cooked it for almost an hour (it was filled to the top in my 9x13 pan) and also i used butter & garlic club crackers on top. Yum. my daughters don't like onions & they even liked it. We are still eating leftovers. Thanks for sharing.

Fixed this on labor day weekend when a bunch of friends were spending the night.  One of the girls has MS and couldn't eat ham so I doubled the chicken.  I liked it alot, but seemed like everyone went for the other casserole I made.  Which is why I only gave it three stars.  I'm going to make it again as the receipe calls for and I'll probably increase the cheese.

With a couple of changes, this was a great dish.  I used 1 lb of italian sausage (cooked in water to avoid browning/crisping then processed small) and 1 pkg canadian bacon cut into pieces, and 2 c shredded cheese. The 9 x 13 pan was emptied by 6 hungry guests!

This recipe is pretty bland for my tastes, but for the same reason, it's pretty kid-friendly.  I made it as suggested here (and didn't have any trouble with the suggested baking time), but when I had a bowl of it myself, I added some sriracha sauce--I liked it better with a little kick.

Having a large family with many different tastes, this was a perfect breakfast recipe. I followed the recipe just as it is, except I used sour cream and onion chips. That is what I had on hand, and it enhanced the existing flavors nicely. Thank you for this keeper!

Easy, filling and tasty! We all loved this casserole. I kept to the recipe, except that I used fat free sour cream (and I just might have used more cheese....;) Delicious! The only thing I might do differently next time is to saute the onions before incorporating them. They were a little underdone. I also refrigerated it overnight, so I baked it for about a total of 1 hour and could have gone longer.

I bring breakfast to my Sunday School class once a month, and it was a BIG hit.  I agree with other reviews stating that it needed to cook longer.  I cooked for 45 min, then added the chips and baked another 12 min.  I also used 2 cups of ham (no chicken) and I omitted the butter.  It still tasted great.  I love bringing home empty dishes!

Love this recipe but NO WAY do you need 2lbs frozen hashbrowns! I used a 1 lb bag of hashbrowns and about 3/4 of the sour cream/soup mixure. The cooking time was way off too. I cooked mine for 1hr and then an additional 15min with the potatoe chips. If its done right, this ones a keeper.

We loved this recipe.  I made it for dinner, and everybody raved about it.  My sister-in-law said it was great.  I cook for my church and she said I should make it for next Sunday.  I did change it a bit.  My family does not like sour cream, so I added a can of cream of mushroom and a scant 1/2 cup of milk.  Also, my hubby does not eat beef or pork, so I used all chicken.  I completely omitted the butter.

I made this for a Sunday School breakfast.  It was a huge hit.  I had alot of requests for the recipe.  Several said they liked it because it didn't contain eggs and they were not partial to them.  This dish went very quickly.  I will make it over and over.

I made this casserole for my Bible study group before a trip one morning and everyone raved about and asked for the recipe! It was a huge hit and so easy to make! I will definately use it again and again...

I love this recipe.  I have made it many times for pot lucks, work, sunday brunches, etc.  There are never leftovers.

I use honeybaked ham (buy by the slice) in this recipe and I eliminate the chicken because I love cheese and ham.  I use reduced sodium cream of chicken, reduced fat (not fat free) sour cream, and 2% cheddar cheese.  I double the amount of cheese. Pre-shredded cheese doesn't seem to melt as well and 2% definitely doesn't melt as well, so just for the topping I use regular cheddar cheese that I shred myself.  I have used fresh onion, frozen onion and an onion soup packet.  Fresh onion was by far the best.  Onion seems to lose its flavor after it's frozen (might be in my head) and the soup mix made it taste like it came out of a can (that might be in my head too).  I usually double this recipe and bake it in a large deep lasagna pan.  There still aren't leftovers when I double it.  I have even taken TWO double pans to work and there were no leftovers.  I would like to try making potato pancakes (like you do with leftover mashed potatoes) but I never get to try it because there are never leftovers.  Maybe one day.

THIS TAKES A FULL HOUR TO COOK IF USING CUBED HASH BROWNS.  May take less cooking time if using shredded potatoes.  

I thought this was great.  I got a lot of compliments when I brought it to work.  I omitted the chicken, which just seemed weird for breakfast, and added more ham instead.  I used a full cup of shredded cheese.  I also used cream of potato instead of cream of chicken soup.

Was a success at the family dinner. However, next time i think I will add some ranch dressing mix to give it a bit more “something”. I didn’t add the butter to the top of the chips based on another review and I’m glad I didnt... they did not need it. Glad for the additional suggestions to help make it just a bit better.

Not bad. Really easy to make. Overall its good considering the ingredients aren't the highest quality. Could use some eggs to balance the saltiness.

Great idea!  I mixed eggs, green chili,  and sausage into it instead of ham and chicken and it came out great.  Also used bread crumbs for the topping.

This is one of my family's favorite dishes! I use all ham, no chicken, and if I don't have potato chips, I sprinkle cheese on the top. This dish is FANTASTIC!

In all honesty, I followed other reviewers suggestion to add a pack of dried onion soup instead of real onion and I didn't like it.  Threw more than half away.  MIght be ok with real onion, but will probably not make again

I modified this recipe quite a bit, but it turned out amazing! I don't eat pork, so I used chicken bacon and chicken sausage, omitted the butter, halved the sour cream, halved the hashbrowns, and used cream of mushroom soup instead. I also added diced red and green peppers, spinach, mushroom, red onion, puréed chipotle peppers, garlic, basil, and parsley. I baked this for 45 minutes in my cast iron skillet, stirring twice, as some of the mixture was dry, but some was very wet still. It ruined my nice layer of cheese on top, so next time I'll skip that step until before serving. All in all, it was delicious! The next day, I reheated the leftovers in a frying pan, which made them crisp up quite a bit. Much better with that texture! In the future I will make this again, but pre-make it the night before, let the flavours sit, and then fry up our servings as we eat them.

I omitted the chicken due to a family member with allergies, and doubled the ham.  I thought it was just okay, but with a bit of tweaking could be very flavorful.  It is very rich and very filling.  Needs a bit of seasoning (black pepper, ground mustard, a bit of Worcestershire sauce maybe?).  The crushed potato chips on top were a hit with the kids, though.
