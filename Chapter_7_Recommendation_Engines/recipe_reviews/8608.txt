This was super easy to make. Didn't have any peppers the first night I made it so substituted with a bag of frozen peas - still tasted great, but can see where the sweetness and color of the red pepper would be nice too. Also, served over rice instead of bread so I didn't have to cut up for the toddlers - both kids ate it up in a heart beat.

This was amazingly easy!  I will steal components of this recipe for other things -- the sauce was so creamy but not too rich.  I served it over rice instead of toast, which I think cut the flavor too much.  I would add more seasoning next time if I used rice again.

A nice simple meal.  I substituted Marsala wine for Sherry.  I also added some frozen peas. I would use less salt or none at all next time since the chicken broth had enough salt in it.

This was SO good!
I loved the nice subtle yet creamy taste.
I added some peas to it, but TOTALLY forgot to put in the avocado!  I love avocado, too.  I won't forget next time!
I'm excited for leftovers, too!

I thought this was bland and boring.  I haven't made anything "Newburg" before so maybe I just don't care for the flavors.  If you make this, be sure to have all ingredients ready ahead of time...the cooking goes fast.

I left off the avocado as I don't like it.  Thought it was very good and a bit different.  It had a good flavor and I was pleased to discover it didn't make the toast all soggy.  However, I think this is 3 servings at most.

NIX THE SALT! I'm so happy I read the reviews before making this. Can't imagine what having that extra t. of salt tossed in would have done to the taste. 

This was very "Newburgie"....lol Flavor wise and it went over well with my family.  I'm not a "Newburg" fan, but will give it a 4 for flavor and ease of making it. 

I'm going to try switching out the Sherry with white wine next time just for fun.

Excellent recipe.  Next time I will leave out the extra salt, as it was very salty.  The sauce was creamy and flavorful.  I used this as a recipe for leftover chicken and it worked out great.

Super recipe for a quick easy dinner.
I would however add cayenne pepper or a good dash of hot sauce the next time.  It really wasn't enough for 4,  3 would be just perfect.

This is gourmet restaurant-quality food and very quick and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly but increased the avocado; served it on toasted sourdough bread.

This recipe definitely needed some ooomph for me.  Hubby thought it was good, but I found myself wanting some depth to it.  Maybe marsala would have been better than the sherry.  I ended up adding a lot of Tajin seasoning to it (as you can see from my photo), but it could be any seasoning that you wanted it to be.  I did not add the avocado because I couldn't imagine the flavors together, so maybe that's the reason for my thinking it was bland.  This is a very quick and easy meal to make using leftover chicken.  Thanks for this idea!

Great! Easy to put together and a great way to use up cooked chicken. The mixture is similar to that of a chicken pot pie.

Sorry, but we just didn't care for this.  The avocado seemed liked it didn't belong.
