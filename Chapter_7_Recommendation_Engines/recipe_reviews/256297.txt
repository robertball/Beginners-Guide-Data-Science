Chorizo ragu' rocks!! This stuff is great on zoodles. I used leftover sauce on some toast and topped it with some cojita cheese. It is so delicious. Make extra or you will find yourself frustrated. I froze a bunch and it's perfect after thawing. I made my own chorizo. Thank you for the recipe.

This came together so quickly with such a short ingredient list and for that alone I am thankful! I happened to have left over homemade turkey chorizo from another recipe so I used that. Love the use of squash! It's perfect for those watching their carbs.

Very tasty! I used zucchini and fresh tomatoes, but it would have been just as good as written. It is also just as good if you use soy chorizo, which makes the recipe vegan. I made it both ways, and loved it both times.
