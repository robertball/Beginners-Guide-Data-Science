Cut back a little on the reserved bean liquid which gave me the consistency that I like.  I used a meat mallet to crush the peppercorns, but I think if you have a pepper mill, using the "coarse" grind on it would work fine.  I will say that the pepper is important in this hummus.  Wouldn't change anything on this recipe, it had the perfect balance of ingredients for us. JOEKLUGER, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I roast the pine nuts in a tiny bit of sesame oil to give them extra flavor.  I also use twice the amount of pine nuts and I add sun-dried tomatoes.  I serve mine with naan because that's a family favorite.  It goes fast at any party.  We love it.  (It took me awhile to find the tahini.  It's located in the aisle where the peanut butter is.  It's sesame paste.)

This was good. Because Iâ€™m on restricted sodium I used a little water instead of the bean liquid and half the added salt. Added a little more lemon juice  to compensate. I should have used less or smaller garlic cloves for my taste buds. I love hummus and this will stay in my collection to make again.

This is a good recipe for those who like spicy - maybe it was my garlic (too fresh) or my pepper grinder - but my tongue was burning!  I made this for my kids so i added more of the sesame paste (tahini), and chickpeas and lemon juice just to mellow out the spice a bit and it worked then it was yummy and my kids loved it!

I have no idea what tahini is, so i (obviously) omitted and sprinkled some cayenne for some heat. Quick and pretty good!
