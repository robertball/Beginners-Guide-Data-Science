We loved this! I had a french baguette to use up, so I used that. I kept it open faced, and put the butter mixture (which I also added some garlic powder to), as well as the cheeses on both halves and baked it in the oven until it got all melty and browned. This would be a great accompaniment to a nice big salad. I will definately be using this recipe a lot! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was really really good! I misread the recipe and used shredded cheddar cheese and pepperjack deli slices. I didn't measure the chili powder just shook it until it looked like enough. The pepperjack and the chili powder went well together. I didn't follow the directions about wrapping it in foil I had pre-sliced french bread in the freezer. Will make this again!!!!
