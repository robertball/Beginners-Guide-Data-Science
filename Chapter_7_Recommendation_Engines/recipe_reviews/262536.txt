Yowsa!   Can you say flavor?   This is so easy and with 2 ingredients?? I’m kinda in awe of this.   I used ground chicken.  And you know how much flavor  that has,  not much.  I used basic “on the border” salsa.  I will make it again.  Thanks BD and Cameron!!

So easy and so delicious! I used a traditional pressure cooker doubling the recipe. I did not adjust cooking time and it was perfect. Ranchera sauce is not available in my area so, I used El Pato jalapeno sauce and added a pureed ancho chile. Thank you for a wonderful and simple recipe.
