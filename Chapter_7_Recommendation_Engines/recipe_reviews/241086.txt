This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as written. I love that it is made without corn syrup.

I made them for a friend's birthday - she'd never had butter tarts. They were devoured over tea on a sunny day in the back garden. A very happy birthday girl! I made a half recipe of the batter and it filled 24 mini tarts.

Turned out fantastic! I baked them while baking my pumpkin pies, so I had the oven at 450F for 15 min then turned it down to 350F for 5 minutes. They were perfect :)

These are my favourite butter tarts.  If using raisins or pecans you can easily make 20 butter tarts from this recipe.

Hello:  i made these yesterday and we loved them.  My mistake was I made mini butter tarts and baked them according to the directions.  I should have cut back on the baking time they were a little dry.  The flavour was there for sure.

These tarts turned out perfectly...soaked the raisins in rum before adding to the shells, very tasty!

These were just ok. In my opinion, what will make or break this recipe is the crust you choose. I feel the flakier the better. Don’t use a biscuit dough and be forewarned, they are very sweet.

I’ve had these twice now. My sister made them for the first time for Canadian Thanksgiving. I liked them so much that I’m making them again for American Thanksgiving. I overfilled the shells a bit but they still taste fabulous.

Just made these. Very good, extremely decadent. I didn't have any raisins or nuts so I sprinkled a few mini chocolate chips on the bottom of each tart. I used a 'butter pastry dough' recipe from Epicurious. They turned out great!
