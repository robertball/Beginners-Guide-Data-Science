Generally speaking this made a great tasting relatively low calorie loaf and one that was easy to put together. The only problem that I had was that it seemed more appropriate for one 8 X 4-inch pan rather than two. The loaves were only about 1 3/4-inches high but the texture was fine.

This recipe was really good. Not as sweet as I would have liked. I'm also not a very big rasin fan so I substituted the rasins with dried apples. I chopped the apples up and followed the directions as if they were rasins. I also doubled the batch which made it perfect for three 8x4in pans.

This is a lovely recipe for simple quick and relatively fool-proof apple bread. I used only all-purpose flour (I didn't have any rye) but other than that I followed the original exactly and it came out great! It has a nice moist tender texture and was not crumbly or dense. The original recipe tastes fine but you can vary the spice/sugar and add-ins depending on your taste. I took a few loaves to work and everyone raved.

This was good but was only enough to make one loaf.

This is tasty but has a slightly strange texture and is a bit crumbly. A word of advice I followed the directions and sifted the dry ingredients. DO NOT sift the rye flour. My sifter is now useless. Particles from the rye flour became trapped between the two screens and will not come out.

This is excellent tasting and very healthy but it's definitely a bit on the crumbly side. Instead of the raisins I put in two cups of diced unpeeled apples. I also used apple pie spice (2 tsp) instead of cinnamon concentrated apple juice and omitted the sugar.

Really good! I did 1 loaf and it took 55 minutes to cook.
