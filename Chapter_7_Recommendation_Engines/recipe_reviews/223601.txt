Followed this mostly as directed and came out great.  I had to proof my yeast so I took a tsp. of the sugar called for and added it to 1/4 cup warm water for proofing.  I had to use a bit more flour but that is a variable that changes with so many factors anyway.  I add flour until the dough feels right, not exactly as called for.  I ended up letting the dough mix in the mixer for about 7 minutes total between low to medium speed.  The dough was a soup before adding the rest of the called for flour.  I added some milk to the melted butter to brush the rolls.  My last proof time was less than called for and the rolls continued to puff up while cooking.  I hand shaped them and baked on silicone mats (see the picture I posted).  I made 10 rolls that fit burgers well.  These are not flaky like store bought rolls but they are an even better texture, reminiscent of pizza rolls (gluten formation dependent on mixing times).  They are fairly light and springy.  Although they puffed a bit tall, they compress easily when biting.

Yes, this is absolutely the BEST sandwich bun recipe available!  Our grandkids love them with PB&J.  A favorite for Hamburgers and Hot Dogs.

I make the dough in my bread machine, following manufacturer's instructions for order of ingredients.  (Hint:  I always sprinkle the sugar over the flower, dividing the salt on either end of pan, and putting the yeast in an indentation in the center.  The sugar aids the yeast, but the salt will kill yeast if it touches it.)
   I shape the 12 rolls for King Arthur's Hamburger-Roll pans which have been greased with Crisco shortening.  AFTER the rolls have risen to a large size, I carefully brush the tops with a mixture of 1 Tablespoon Milk, 1 Egg Yolk, beaten, and 1/4 teaspoon Salt using a Fan Art Brush.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or until tops are light golden.

This made a great foundation for pulled pork sandwiches.  Was disappointed that there were not any leftover.  The family ate every one!

My only confusion with this recipe is Step 5. That's a third rise. I've never risen bread more than twice so after the 1 hour in the bowl, punch down, divide into buns and rise again for 1 hour, I brushed on the butter and then right into the 350Â° oven for 13 minutes and they were perfect. 
Maybe next time, I'd reduce the amount of sugar by half. They have a little bit of a sweet flavour to them.

Tried it tonight with bbq pulled pork and it was amazing! I made them so they were the size of hamburger buns, made 6. I did do 2 tsp of yeast as opposed to 1 1/4 tsp. They rose beautifully and were so soft. Will definitely be making more of these in the future!

I tried this recipe twice exactly as directed.  The first time, the dough didn't rise, and I thought maybe I had dead yeast so I tried a second batch with new yeast.  It didn't rise sufficiently and I ended up with hockey pucks.  And I'm not an inexperienced breadmaker.  I will not try these again after two failed attemps.

I halved the sugar and they were still a bit sweet for sandwich buns.  Would make perfect dinner rolls, though.  I also omitted step 5, and they came out super soft, fluffy and delicious.

I will preface this by saying I am new at breads, and new at my stand mixer. I would call this a rather "involved" recipe that didn't turn out how I expected it to. I was looking for "lighter than air" or fluffy sandwich rolls. I followed recipe to the letter. While good, they are heavier than I would like. Unfortunately Allrecipes doesn't allow feedback for where I may have mis-stepped. I will stick to other forums for complex recipes and keep Allrecipes for the simple. I am probably to blame for lack of success!!

These turned out so well! The only thing I changed was to use half whole wheat flour. I made 12 buns and they're the perfect size for sandwiches. I used them for burgers last night and they were great. Other recipes I've tried have come out dense and not good for sandwiches but these were perfect. I highly recommend them.

These are fantastic!  The entire family loves them and that is a big deal with a family of five.  They are time consuming to make, but easy even if you don't make bread all the time.  Well worth it!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These are great!  The dough seemed dry after the two minutes of mixing, but since this was my first go at the recipe, I decided to trust it. They turned out fine, I might add a bit more water/milk next time as they were a bit ragged on the edges.  Added Everything But the Bagel seasoning to a few, that was a good move!

I have very limited skill in cooking, I can fix omelet, breakfast egg, fry becon only for myself, and nothing else.

This is the first time I bake, and the out come is awesome with complements from my wife. The recipe and instruction is very easy to follow.

Thank you so much for the recipe.

These turned out great! I didn't modify the ingredients, but I did add the yeast to the warm milk mixture(not hot!) until it was foamy (about 10 minutes) before I added it to the flour. Then I proofed the dough in a warm oven that I turned off after heating to 100 degrees. Anyone having trouble with the dough rising should try these tricks to get a better rise. Delicious, soft, and golden....yum!

Had quite a bit of leftover turkey (20lbs was a bit much for 6 people, and should have listened to my wife who is the real cook in the house), but think I redeemed myself with these for turkey sandwiches. Sprayed with water and sprinkled poppy seeds on top right before baking and they crusted beautifully.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I have made these rolls 3-4 times and came out perfect each time.  It's my go to recipe now.  Only changes I made were due to allergies.  Used 1cup canned coconut milk and 1/2 cup water instead of the milk.  Used raw sugar instead of white. Olive oil for butter. Instead of mixer, I used bread machine on dough setting.  All worked perfectly.

The only change I made was to proof my yeast with 1/4 c water prior to making it, so I decreased the milk by 1/4 c.  Otherwise I followed the directions pretty much as stated.  (mine didn't require the full 3 hours of rise time to double).  They turned out very good!  They were not as sweet as I expected after reading other reviews.  I did expect them to have a bit more flavour, but can't pinpoint exactly what is missing.  I didn't notice how many buns the recipe was supposed to yield, but I made 12, and they were a very good size for sandwichs or burgers.  I would definitely make them again.

I made these in my bread maker on the dough setting, shaped into buns and let rise again. They were amazing. The buns were so popular they were requested two nights in a row.

I was pleasantly surprised with these buns!  I made a few changes so I didn't know if it was going to work out.  I doubled the recipe and got about 24 nice sized buns.  I had to use way more flour than the recipe called for as the dough was still really sticky.  I probably added an extra cup, maybe even a cup and a half.  I substituted half the flour for whole wheat flour. I also used olive oil instead of butter (I halved the amount).  When I was making them I was worried they were not going to rise well, but they did and they were delicious!!

Best Hamburger bun ever! I add poppy seeds to mine for a more gourmet look. Worked ever so well for a southern citrus chipotle fried chicken.

This was fantastic!  I had to hide the buns, so they'd last for another meal!  We did cut down the sugar, too, but overall it was amazing.  Perfect with butter or as a sandwich.

I liked the texture of these buns, but the sugar should be cut in half at least. Much, much too sweet.

Oh... my... gaaawwd! This is the best recipe for soft buns ever! I used the garlic butter I made and added cumin powder to the recipe. I also turned them into cresent rolls by dividing the dough in two and rolling out into round. Made 24 medium cresent rolls. So soft, so good. The house smells wonderful and my tongue is actually curves in a smiling gesture. Thank you!

MAKE THESE. They are very adaptable too in terms of seasonings. One could add thyme, rosemary, etc. Love it!

These turned out nicely.  I like the taste, the size, and the texture.  I think I even messed up a little on the rise, so I can't wait to make them again!  These are now our daily sandwich breads (I vowed to not buy store bread again)

This is the absolute best sandwich bun I have ever had! My family uses them for everything...hot or cold sandwiches, hamburgers, PB&J, egg sandwiches, you name it! The recipe is super easy and fairly quick. As with everything else homemade, you will never buy buns again!
