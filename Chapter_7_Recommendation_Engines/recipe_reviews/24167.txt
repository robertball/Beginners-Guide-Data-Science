These little pizzas are just fabulous! Try these tips though: first, purchase the thinnest pita breads you can find, and pre-toast them, rather than just warm them, in a 400 degree oven. Let them get ever so slightly crisped before topping them. This will result in a much better crust. Second, you can make your own pizza sauce which is much more flavorful than plain tomato sauce. Mix a small can of roasted garlic tomato paste with an 8 ounce can of roasted garlic tomato sauce. It is the perfect pizza sauce in both flavor and consistency, suitable for ANY pizza recipe. These little pizzas were really divine, an excellent appetizer for a party when cut into quarters. YUM!

I've made these for years, they're wonderful! a little tip - if you prefer a crispier pita - split the pita round in half so you have two rounds and as others have noted toast slightly before adding your toppings! baking time decreases of course with the split rounds.

These are great!  I changed the toppings a bit, adding parmesan cheese, fresh basil, roasted red peppers and grilled asparagus.  I cut each pita pizza into 6 pieces and served them at a party. We thought the crust tasted exactly like those we found on pizzas we ate in Italy.  It was amazing...my friends couldn't believe that the "crust" was pita pockets!

This is a recipe where you can add any topping you like! I used chicken and green onion and peppers. I didnt have the "traditional" mozza cheese on hand so I used a little sharp cheddar. This is a great little snack that's quick  to serve while watching a hockey game on TV, or as an appy at a party, or even as lunch!

This is a great recipe!  I loved using pita breads, it made a perfect crust.  I used whole-wheat pitas and pizza sauce from Trader Joe's.  I love blue cheese, but Dh doesn't, so on his pizza I used feta.  The blue cheese tasted great with the other ingredients.  I used jarred roasted red peppers (chopped) instead of pimentos.  This is something I will make often.

I buy pita bread from Costco that is absolutely wonderful and used it with this recipe.  Since I was making it for my picky 5 year old, I had to skip all of the special toppings and just use spaghetti sauce and cheese.  He still prefers Domino's but when were pressed for time, this will work.  Thanks for the wonderful idea Cheryl.

these are the absolute best little pizza's ever! i have been making pita pizza's for awhile and just love them. the pita flat breads make a great crust. i agree on toasting them in the over first for 1-2 min. you can do just about anything with these, a few of my fav's are BBQ chicken and caprese pizza's. very easy (and fun!) to make too!

I love idea of this. I topped the pita breads with our favourite pizza toppings rather than what was suggested and baked until the bread was crisp & cheese bubbly. Great for lunches!

5 STARS !!! Great recipe. Second time I made it I used pizza sauce and changed blue cheese for parmesan it was much better but original recipe still worth 5 stars. MODIFICATION: I've made this recipe so many times that I’ve made some major modifications that work great; I use pizza cheese mix I believe it has like 5 different kinds of cheese including  mozzarella and parmesan it’s already grated so you save a lot of time. I add pepperoni, ham, whatever I have on hand and the taste really improves. I’ve made this with whole wheat pitas it has a bit of a different taste but still amazing. I skip on the tomatoes because they always seem to lack a little flavor.

These are GREAT!  I added some roasted red pepper, used green olives instead of black, and parm/romano.  Perfect late lunch for two on a Saturday afternoon.

These are very good. To cut down on the carbs simply peel the pita in half and arrange all the fixin's on the inside portion. Just as good and 1/2 the carbs!

I used items I had on hand: cheddar, jack and parmesan cheese, olives, pepperoncinis and green onions with a spinach spaghetti sauce. Added italian seasoning, garlic pepper and crushed red pepper. Threw them in the toaster oven for 10 minutes at 400 degrees and it did a pretty good job at satisfying my pizza craving tonight!

I have  prepared all different kinds of pizza toppings and used pizza sauce or alfredo sauce then let the kids put together their own pizza.  They enjoy eating what they have created.  We also put ours on the grill for a crispy crust.

I've been making these for years.  They are great for a party.  Just have all of the ingredients lined up so folks can build their own.  We did a 10-year-old party using these and recorded the girls (Cooking show style) making their custom pizza.  So versatile, so easy and the combination possibilities are endless.  From standard sausage or peperoni to getting rid of left-overs.

We LOVE these! They are easy and everyone can have exactly what they want. It makes is so much easier especially since my daughter is allergic to so many things. This way I know what she is eating and still gets the chance to eat pizza like the rest of us. I put pesto on her's along with a bit of cheese and she can't get enough.

I didn't actually follow the ingredient list, but I loved the pita crust concept. I baked in the toaster over at 425 for about 13 min per pita pizza.

Great idea.  I used some flour totillas that were on their last legs (still safe just carboardy), jarred pasta saauce and whatever was in the frig.  Made his and hers.  Perfect way to use up those small quantity leftovers and have an enjoyable meal.  The grandsons called them "garbage pizzas" and inhaled them.  Guess the eating was a positive vote from them, in spite of the dubious name they gave it.  I will look for pitas next time.

Top of the Line restaraunts use this technique for ultra thin crust. Use tortillas for an even thinner crust or split pita before using. I gave it 4 stars only because I prefer the totilla base more than pita.

Pita pocket pizzas are my familys new favorite after making this recipe. We have been topping with lots of different ingredients. The toppings in this recipe are fantastic. I love the spice combination. I never would have thought of coriander on pizza. As suggested by Jana Sue, i used homemade pizza sauce and prebaked the pitas for a bit (about 3 minutes) prior to adding toppings. Fantastic. Thank you for the recipe.

Great idea!  Pitas made a crispy crust and we used left over spaghetti sauce.  We put the pizzas on the grill to toast the crust and moved it off the flame but left the grill lid closed to bake the cheese and toppings.  Perfect for a party.

Another alternative to tomato sauce is tomato pesto with sun dried tomatoes, garlic and walnuts.  Toppings we use are spinach, onion, green pepper, avocado and broccoli!  Friday nite is “pizza & a movie” night!

I love these pizzas.  I always have pita bread on hand to make them.  However, like others, I do pre-cook the pita breads rather than just warm them up to ensure the crust is nice and crisp instead of slightly mushy.  I use bottled pizza sauce from a local pizza place and then whatever toppings I want.

I followed the instructions for heating/cooking. It was very good. However i used a pizza sauce and other toppings on a whole wheat pita. My guests loved it too. With a small salad it made a quick and easy dinner.

This is a great ans versitile recipie, you can also just take the pita and brush it with olive oil and add toppings or instead replace tomato sauce with alfredo. I used to make thesse for my high school lunch topped with all kinda of healthy steamed veggies and motzerella cheese. This is not for an elegant dinner, just a change from the plain old turkey sandwhich for bag lunches.

Good starter recipe. Decided to add my own toppings and was a hit. Great for a quick lunch or dinner. Thanks!

I didn't warm the pitas because they were very fresh.  I baked mine at 400 F.  I added cooked lean ground beef spiced with garlic and oregano.  I put onions, green peppers, canned mushrooms, sliced black olives.  I used store brand marinara sauce.  Lots of mozzarella cheese.    Hubby said, no more ordering take out pizza

These are awesome! So quick and taste great. The kids loved them. I used pizza sauce and the toppings that we like. Also, I heated them in the oven more like 3-4 minutes instead of just a minute.

I took out the blue cheese. I made my own sauce with italian seasoning. I put pepperoni, olives and mozzarella cheese on it. It turned out so delicious! I plan on making this again.

How funny!  I was in the mood for pizza the other night and found some pita bread--decided to use that as my crust.  Was the best homemade pizza I have made in a long time! My toppings were a bit different, but hey--try this-you won't be disappointed!

Great recipe, my kids loved it! Only thing, I believe 8 mins it is too long to cook them for, may be because my oven is too much on the hot side, but definitely a keeper!

What an easy way to quickly prepare dinner! My kids had a blast "prepping" their own pizza with what they preferred! I set out a few sauce, toppings and seasoning choices and they made their own individual pizzas. Next time I will take the advise of another reviewer and toast the pitas for a few minutes until they crisp up and then add the sauce and toppings to make a crispier pizza. We will be coming back to this recipe often!

I used wheat pita bread and excluded olives. Turned out great. Took a little longer to get the cheese to melt, but that might've had to do with my oven. 

Fast and easy.
