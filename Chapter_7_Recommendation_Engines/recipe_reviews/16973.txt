This recipe sounded exactly like the one I remember from years ago . . . only I remembered sliced radishes in the salad.  So, I added radishes.  It was wonderful!  One note, however.  A head of leaf lettuce comes in different sizes, and some bacon will render more grease than other bacon.  Adjust the quantities accordingly.  You want the lettuce sufficiently coated so it will wilt, but not drown in the dressing. Also, make sure your lettuce is completely dry.

THANKS!!! I had this salad twice, when I was 16. My grandmother made it, and I haven't been able to reproduce it since. I've been looking EVERYwhere for a recipe for this salad! It's so wonderful. Thanks :):)

I tried this recipe for Easter dinner.  I used the dressing with spinach instead of lettuce...used 1/2# of bacon to about 3 cups of spinach and one recipe of dressing.  Turned out wonderful..everyone wanted the recipe.  There wasn't a bit left over!

This was good, but use plenty of bacon...otherwise, it can be a little bland. The ingrediants are a wonderful blend, though!

I was thrilled to find this recipe, my mother made wilted lettuce all my life and I could not remember the vinegar/sugar ratio. She used regular white vinegar, sugar, no lemon juice....crumbled the bacon reserving the drippings pouring off grease a bit. She then added the vinegar and spices and simmered just a bit, then poured it over the torn lettuce (she just used iceberg back then, a bit of sliced onion and no radish) Then she covered the salad with a dinner plate to "wilt" the lettuce....It was delicious...and just reading the recipe has the juices flowing and a smile on my face! Thanks for whisking me back 45 years

Delicious! just like mom used to make. I must have had more lettuce than called
for, I think it could have used more dressing. My kids would'nt touch it but they are too young to appreciate it.

We liked this salad.  It had good flavor, but I didn't have enough sauce to thoroughly coat the lettuce.  It would have been nice if the recipe mentioned how much bacon grease you would need.  I'll probably try it again.

I was really looking forward to trying out this recipe, unfortunately, when I added the vinegar and lemon juice (I had mixed them together) to the hot bacon drippings, in the pan, the whole thing exploded in my face.  I had taken the pan off of the cook top and as I poured the vinegar/lemon juice into the drippings the contents of the pan began to splatter and pop.  I stopped pouring, I had only poured about half of the vinegar/lemon juice into the pan, and quickly rushed the pan over to my kitchen sink to contain the splatters and pops.  Once the pan was in the sink the contents exploded in my face.  Thankfully, I managed to close my eyes but the hand that was still holding the the pan handle got burned pretty bad.  After cleaning up I reread the directions to this recipe and it says to add the vinegar, lemon juice, sugar and pepper to the "hot bacon drippings".  Am I the only person this has happened to?  I read the least favorable reviews, on this recipe, and no one else mentions this occurring.

Had a question for anyone!  This reminds me of my mother. Brought tears to my eyes. I want to make it but not sure about the fat content from the grease drippings (pretty high) from the five pieces of bacon. Is there some way I can modify and not use all the drippings?  Tx!

I doubled this except for the lemon and pepper.  The dressing was still a bit tart and missing something till I put the crumbled bacon in to heat up in the dressing, then it was just right. Next time I will do half the bacon in the dressing and half as garnish for the crunch.

I grew up making and eating this salad.  We use the baby leaf lettuce in the garden with green onions.  Vidalia onions are also good in this salad thinly sliced.  I must have sliced hard boiled eggs in this salad.  Just isn't the same without it.  The more bacon the better.  You cann't have too much.  If you don't want all the grease just pour some out into another container.  

Thanks Mary for putting down some measurements.  My daughter-in-law has always asked me for some, but I never have them  I just have always made this salad by sprinkling the sugar, salt and pepper and pouring the vinegar with the bacon grease.  Then I have just tasted to see if the balance is right and go from there.  Always has turned out great for me.  Way I was taught to cook.

During the summer, I make a lot of main dish salads.  German Potato Salad has always been a favorite of mine, so of course I loved the wilted lettuce with the sweet/sour bacon dressing.  I didn't use ALL of the bacon grease, and I upped the sugar.  Also added broccoli florets and dried cranberries.  (I sauteed the broccoli and the green onions in the dressing briefly to soften them a bit and add to the broccoli's bright green color.)

This was different. It tasted like a mix between a salad and turnip greens. I found the recipe looking to use up some leaf lettuce and green onions. For the bacon I used thick cut pre-cooked bacon and heated it in the pan. I also just added black pepper to taste in the recipe. Make sure not to toss any of the little bit of dressing, when serving, because it was good at the bottom of the bowl.

We always had this dressing in Pennsyvania when I was a little girl in the 50's & 60's.  The only fresh green available at that time in the winter were iceburg lettuce!  We hunted down the baby dandelion sprouts as soon as the spring thaw began.  There was nothing more welcome than this salad in the spring.  It is also great as a dresing for potato salad.  For that I add fresh dill and coarsely chopped sweet gerhkins.  So good!

My grandmother used to make this salad for me and she taught me a helpful hint to get the lettuce nice and wilted/saturated -- pour the warm dressing over the lettuce; swirl it around; drain it back into the pan; reheat the dressing.  Repeat this process 3 times.

Gave this 4 out of 5 stars only for the fact that it is not wilted lettuce salad without sliced radishes and a sprinkle of hot pepper/vinegar sauce!  A definite summertime treat, especially when made from homegrown veggies!

This is a total blast-from-the-past!  I loved it as a kid, my kids loved it..............and here it is again. 
allrecipes.com does a wonderful job of bringing a wide variety of recipes to our attention, including ones we'd forgotten.  Ya' just HAVE to eat this as soon as the hot liquid is poured on top.  It gets nasty as it cools.

To avoid getting burnt add the onion into the hot grease first and let them cook until tender. I use sweet onion not green onion. Next carefully add the sugar and stir into a smooth bubbly mixture then very slowly add your liquid.

Yum. This is so good even my non-veggie-eating husband went back for seconds. Also added radishess and green onion from my garden.

This is an old time recipe. We used it on both lettuce, spinach and dandelions. Instead of red wine vinegar we used cider vinegar no lemon juice. As  another poster stated add radishes sliced and sliced hard boiled eggs to make it a meal. The kids liked it well enough that we would have it once in awhile as lunch no left overs.

Very good salad. Reminds me of the wilted lettuce my mother made when I was a child. I did cut back on the green onions to just 2 onions, which was plenty enough for us.

Try doubling this recipe and serving it over mashed potatoes as a main dish.... more vinegar if need be..... it's marvelous.  This is an age old recipe, handed down through generations and savored by all.  I've yet to find someone who doesn't like this.

This was just the recipe I was looking for. Bumper crop of spring lettuce and even the 'no-vegetable' teenagers had two helpings. It only served  four in my house. Yeahhhh!

YUM! I used way more than 5 slices of bacon, but still ended up short on dressing, as our bacon is pretty lean. Either way, it was delicious!  I added some diced egg and regular onions to the bacon and green onions.

This is the gold standard for wilted lettuce dressing. If you're going to use it for spinach, adding a little dijon mustard will really enhance the flavor and make it stand up to the spinach better. Adding some chopped egg and chicken livers works well too.

The best way to fix this is to use leaf lettuce, the way we do it here in West Virginia is clean your leaf lettuce, cut up 4 green onions add a little sugar on top and then put vegetable oil and vinegar in a pan bring to a slight boil then pour over the lettuce.  The best you can get...

My 1st mother-in-law in Flint, MI made this several times.  This would have been late 60's and have bought umpteen old cookbooks to try to find it.  Loved it then; will now be able to pass it on to my family.  Thank you.

An all time favorite salad.  I replace the onions with hard-boiled egg and use fresh spinach rather than lettuce since it holds up better to being wilted.  Delicious!

My husband mentioned his grandmother made wilted lettuce and he always liked it.  I surprised him by making it and used this recipe. He loved it.  I didn't have redwine vinegar on hand so used 1 tbsp of applecider vinegar and 1 tbsp of red wine.  It worked  fine.

Excellent recipe. My Mom made this but never measured anything. She would say "a pinch of salt,a scoop in the palm of your had, ect." So I am glad to see this. I do NOT use the lemon juice, but that is just because my Mom didn't and I loved hers. Thank you again

My mother-in-law used to make wilted lettuce salad - and I always indulged in seconds.  She didn't use a recipe, so when we lost her we lost this wonderful dish too.  This salad was similar to what she made, and tasted wonderful!  I did alter it slightly by using 1 TB of suger instead of a tsp (actually I doubled the whole dressing portion of the recipe except the bacon).  I didn't have green onions on-hand, so I substituted a little purple onion which I softened in the bacon grease.  I used 2 small heads of Romaine lettuce.  Well - my hubby & I didn't leave much behind!

Excellent as written but I did add tomatoes and some feta cheese after the "wilting" since I don't care for radishes. Also dod not use the bacon but olive oil for the "grease" to cut back on the bad fat contant.

I am sorry, maybe I did something wrong or it wasn't hot enough but when I poured the bacon grease onto lettuce  (it was sizzling) but as I ate my salad it started to harden and made it almost like a 'shortening coating' on the lettuce.  I couldn't take the texture and oily taste in my mouth so I had to toss it before finishing.  I have had this salad before (never made it), and liked it but felt like I needed some hot tea to "unclog" my arteries after this.

Good, but will use olive oil instead.  Seeing the solidified grease on the side of our bowls by the end of the meal was disturbing. We're also going to add a few other veggies.  Otherwise, great recipe.

Just like my husband and I had as children, even my daughter loves it. I double the dressing for this recipe. It always turns out perfect.

The bacon/vinegar/lemon/pepper juice combo was just right! I used a mix of spinach and swiss chard and it came out perfect. Sprinkled a bit of blue cheese on top. Perfect.

I have been making this for many years and always add a chopped hardboiled egg to the lettuce and green onions, then pour on the dressing and toss. Dressing is especially wonderful made with balsamic vinegar.

Add chopped radishes and my husband loved it. He's not a big salad fan.

I have made this for years, but I use fresh mustard greens, green onions and fried fat back...I have never added sugar vinegar and lemon juice to my drippings, but sounds good for a fresh spinach salad...

Our old spring salad was cooked and thickened, so I added a tablespoon of flour (or use gluten flour or a starch thickener) and 3/4 cup water. I had about 3 tablespoons of bacon drippings to start. Whisk until slightly thickened. Since there are just 2 at our house, I am storing, heating  what is needed over each bowl. We can no longer eat green onions, so I substitute chopped shallot that has rested in vinegar. I place salad in bowls, add bacon pieces and shallot, and then pour enough dressing to nicely coat and wilt each bowl of salad.

We add hot potato chunks to it and use garden lettuce. We call it Dutch Mess.  Yummy!

Very good.  Made it according to directions, but doubled the ingredients because of the amount of lettuce we used.  Will make again!

Reminded me of my Mom's recipe. Mom used leaf lettuce or baby spinach from our garden.  Sometimes wild greens.  Bacon grease was a way of life for us then, a little apple cider vinegar, a little sugar, toss dry greens in the skillet.  Toss carefully until greens are wilted. Yum!

This brings back memories of my grandmother, who used to make wilted lettuce salad when I was a kid.  I followed the recipe to a tee, except I left out the lemon juice because it doesn't need it.  It was just like I remembered, strong, tangy, and delicious.

This is one of the first recipies that I learned when I was young with the exception of adding a couple of tsp of dry mustard to the dressing I have even used yellow bottled mustard.
