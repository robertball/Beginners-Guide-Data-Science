12-27-2018  ~Supper was not a big hit in this house tonight. This recipe’s best feature is that there is no messy, greasy stove-top to clean and just one pot. That’s where the positives end for us.  There was so much liquid we had to serve this with a slotted spoon.  It had an unappealing, murky look to it. Worst of all, the kielbasa took on a very strange texture.  I could be kind and say it was “tender,” but in reality it was simply soft and mooshy.  The flavor, overall, was fine, but the other factors I’ve described unfortunately overshadowed that.  I believe this traditional dish is best prepared in the traditional manner or slow cooker where not so much liquid is required.

I love sauerkraut but didn't have any on hand.  Instead I used   the leaves from the  large head of cauliflower I had. I washed, then chopped up the leaves and tossed them in the pot. It turned out delicious!

I have been making this for years.  I also add a couple of tbs brown sugar and some caraway seed, about a tsp.  You can also add pork chops or ribs on top of the sauerkraut before cooking.  My family really loves this meal.

If you want to avoid your kielbasa turning to mush what you need to do is, when you put the kielbasa back in, put it on top of everything. Then secure the lid and set the instant pot to 0 minutes. It will come to full pressure and then automatically go to the keep warm setting. Let it naturally reduce pressure for 10 minutes and then let the rest of the pressure out of the instant pot. You just have to make sure that you slice your potatoes thin enough that the 10 minutes at pressure will cook them through. 3/4 inch to one inch works fine. This keeps the kielbasa from turning to mush. Now this is only if you are using precooked kielbasa.

One of our go to suppers. I decided to make it in the instant pot instead of oven, so referred to the instructions more than the ingredients... I used Italian sausage because that’s what I had and maple syrup instead of brown sugar. I also added carrots and apple juice instead of beer. A very versatile recipe for comfort food during a storm.

We made the recipe as written, it was pretty good, but a bit bland for our taste, maybe adding a tablespoon of Country French Dijon mustard would have hit the spot. But a very easy and tasty meal after work. Kids can easily do prep work after school.

I made this today and it was delicious. I only did one little thing different and that was to add 1/2 tsp caraway seeds, because I love them. Followed your directions and recipe, but I did add the kielbasa also, in step 2. I think they forgot to add that in.  It was a 5 . Will make this again for special occasions also.

I didn't have bacon but used bacon grease to saute my onions in. I didn't add the sausage till the end with the saurkraut based on other reviews.
I really like it, had great flavor and didn't  take long to assemble.

I liked this recipe. The first time I had this type of dish it was cooked for several hours. The instant pot makes it  done in less than an hour. I used a tablespoon of seasoning salt instead of 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. I also used russet potatoes instead of the yellow potatoes.  I substituted 1/4 cup rice wine/vinegar and additional 1/4 cup of chicken broth r for the beer . When my Polish friend's father made it, he used beer. One for the dish and one for the cook! Great dish if you like sauerkraut!
