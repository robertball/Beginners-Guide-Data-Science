This is very similar to how I make my salsa. The difference is that I use fresh tomatoes and then lime juice instead of the vinegar. I preferred the vinegar in this one over the lime juice in my go to recipe. I have mixed feelings on the canned tomato. A lot more simple than fresh for sure but they gave it a bit of sweetness which I wasn't overly thrilled with. Still a great recipe and it is super simple so you can't go wrong,
