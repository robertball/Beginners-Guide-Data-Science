This was kind of bland - it needed something to moisten it up - maybe eggs.  Also needed some sort of seasoning.

Suprisingly delicious; I added some scallions to really give this dish some extra flavor. I loved the crisp'ness of the spinach. Would work as good side dish, but we ate it as the main course.

My kids love this( following the recipe exactly). Yes, some adults might find it a bit bland, but if you use extra sharp cheddar and your favorite spices it can be a hit!

We didn't like this at all. I think it was because of the turkey though, it was just so bland, even after we add some spices and garlic. It would probably be really good with beef or lamb.

Made as is and the results were a rather bland recipe. After tasting this I added Sriracha which seemed to help the flavor a bit. If I were to try something like this again I would use cabbage in place of the spinach along with some onions and seasonings.
