This was ok, tasted good, but a little too sweet and a little too oily.

Easy recipe, and was a great hit. I followed the recipe exactly but used pink pearl apples which were given to me. Came out very pretty delicious, I like sweet. Has a nice thin crusty top and moist inside. A keeper

This is definitely an easy, one bowl, snack cake.  With a few changes it's a keeper since we're always looking for easy, dairy free recipes.   Reducing the oil would help produce a better final product.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, and exchanged a portion of the white sugar for brown, as a personal preference.

I found it very difficult to fold in the apples. I would cut the apples into half slices and reduce the sugar slightly other than that, it was great.

Very good recipe, came out great! I followed recipe to the letter, even used apple varieties suggested. Very moist with a good apple flavor. Hardest part was folding apples into batter, just had to keep going till everything was coated. Might be my oven but took a little over an hour to cook through. Second time, the wife insisted on sprinkling top with cinnamon and sugar, both were a hit! Definitely a do-again.
