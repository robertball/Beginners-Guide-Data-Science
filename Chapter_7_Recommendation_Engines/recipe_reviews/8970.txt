Great Recipe!  If you have trouble frying (raw on the inside, burnt on the outside)use Wesson oil.  It keeps good heat and will cook it through, without burning the outside.  I keep turning the pieces every few minutes through out the process instead of letting it cook on low for 10 minutes.

Try This Recipe!!!  This is the best fried chicken recipe ever! With simple ingredients, the chicken turns out golden brown and crunchy. And it works great on all pieces of chicken, drumsticks included! Just a tip: works well if you let the chicken sit for a couple minutes before re-flouring:-)

This chicken was out of this world!  It was cooked to perfection, batter was so tasty!    My husband RAVED about it!  I will definitely use it again.  

Note-I let the chicken sit in the batter the first time for 10 min before dipping it a second time.   The batter really does stick VERY WELL!  AWESOME!

We have tried a lot of fried chicken recipes, but this one is the best.  The coating is wonderful and very tasty.  I did soak the chicken (I used split breasts) in salt water for about 1 hour to make the chicken moist and to put some flavor into the chicken.  Definitely make sure you use garlic powder and not garlic salt, as it would definitely make the chicken too salty as a previous reviewer discovered.

This chicken was really nice and crisp the first time you fry it before covering it.  The next time I make it after frying, I would bake it in the oven while preparing the rest of the dinner for about 1/2 hour at 325-350 and it should be done.

I made "boneless chicken wings" (a la Buffalo Wild Wings) using this recipe (chicken breasts cut into chunks and coated in sauce after they're fried), and they were amazing. Better than BW3s. I coated the pieces as the recipe calls for, and then I deep fried them at 350. Because I was just testing, I used one chicken breast, one egg, one cup of flour, 2 TB of seasoned salt, and 1 TB of garlic powder.

This is a great base recipe for fried chicken!  You can add other ingredients and play with the amounts of seasoned salt, garlic, and salt and pepper until you get the right combo for you.    After the first flour-ing, I put the chicken pieces in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.  Then I egg, re-flour, and fridge again for another 30 minutes.  I find this helps keep the coating on even better.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I am not very experienced with fried foods and it turned out perfect.  Crispy, tasty coating and moist perfectly cooked meat. I didn't have seasoned salt so I used about 3 Tbs instant chicken bouillon and seasoning.  With the fat at 335-350 degrees it only took 20-25 minutes to cook.

I fried up this chicken exactly as given. Turned out perfect. Very tender and juicy. A forgiving recipe that can be easily altered to one's tastes. The secret is in applying the coating. Follow the coating instructions exactly and fry at 350 degrees. You can't miss with this one. Eat at once as it is so juicy inside that it loses is crispiness after freezing. Still tastes great, though.

Very scrumptious! We thought the seasoned salt and garlic powder would be overpowering but they aren't at all. We did not change anything about this recipe. We used halved chicken breasts the first time and chicken breasts cut into nuggets the second time. Great both ways!

This was an excellent recipe for my husband to use for the first batch of fried chicken he has evern made. It turned out crispy on the outside and juicy and flavorful on the inside. He did take to heart a tip someone posted to turn the chicken over more often than the recipe requested. This worked perfectly as the crust turned out golden and not burnt as it did for some people who attempted this. Definitely a family favorite!!! Thanks Millie for posting this!

My daughter made this recipe and it was the best fried chicken I have had in our family, so she sent it to me. Now, I can make just about anything and it will come out near perfect, BUT, fried chicken I can never get right. I give MYSELF the one star. I don't like using chicken breast because I prefer the dark meat chicken best AND because I am trying to perfect my hand at REAL fried chicken using the thighs and leg portions.(Fried chicken breast cooks faster and so that is not where my challenge is) My chicken always comes out raw on the inside and almost burned and bitter tasting on the crust. I tried using a lower heat setting, but the chicken takes sooooo long to cook and then it still comes out either too greasy or just mushy on the outside. Oven bake after frying...yup, tried that too, better, but still there has got to be a way to make fried chicken without having to use two cooking methods and using the dark meat peices. I feel like I am one bad chef! But, if your a better fried chicken maker, this recipe won my taste buds and interest and I will keep trying to make it perfect.

Excellent, excellent recipe. I suggest a little less salt.  Absolutely delicious.  It reminds me of when I worked at Roy Rogers and made the chicken there.

So, I found this recipe because my husband did not like the way I made fried chicken.  The search was on, and I came across this one.  WOW!  How easy and simple!!!  Frying time was right on and it came out juicy and crisp.  My husband was extremely pleased and it is now going to be a nice addition to our home menu.    I did not have seasoned salt, but it still turned out very tasty!  Thank you!

Simply amazing. I followed other reviewers advice. Soaked the chicken in salt water mixture for an hour to make it tender. I did add some poultry seasoning to my flour mixture. Then after I dredged the chicken in flour, I let it sit for 10 minutes before I dipped it in egg and re-floured.  I used wesson cooking oil. It turned out perfect!! Never made fried chicken before. I was immensely pleased with the result. Crispy, tender and delicious!!

Good recipe.  There is no need to salt your chicken if you plan to use the amount of season salt outlined in the recipe.  I would decrease the amount of season salt next time.  If cut the recipe to serve 3, I would probably only use about 1 tbs plus 1/3 tsp of season salt.  This cooks in about 20-25 minutes with the heat on medium low.

Loved this recipe! Everyone I've made it for always raves about it and constantly asking me to make more!  I added some paprika to my mix and used sea salt and cracked pepper or a pepper medley.  on occasion I have also let the chicken bath in either buttermilk or broth beforehand.  You really do not need to boil the chicken prior to frying... I've made this many times and the chicken has always been cooked thoroughly with no alterations to the directions, that has been my experience at least.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This was fantastic. I did add a bit more garlic and pepper and it took about 9 minutes per side. I drained each piece well then put in fridge to cool . (We like our fried chicken cold) Served with potato salad on a hot summer night-YUM

Really loved this!!! very well seasoned. I deep fried. Found that skin was less crispy when i put the top on the deep fryer. Such a difference in crispiness when i did the second batch and left the top off and fried uncovered. I will be adding this to my all time favorites. Thanks so much for sharing

This was my first successful time making fried chicken. I followed other peoples advice and did the ice cold salt water soak for 30 minutes before starting. I used less salt than the recipe called for, and added poultry seasoning, cajun seasoning and paprika. I also lightly seasoned the chicken pieces with poultry seasoning before flouring. I used my cast iron pan and filled it with an inch of oil. Chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. After many tries, this is the first recipe that worked (for me)!

This was excellent! I followed the directions as they were except I used boneless skinless chicken and cut the cooking time. It was so flavorful and the chicken was moist! Was a big hit with the hubby so I will be making this again!

This is really good.  I made it the first time with the 5 tblsp of season salt, and it was way to salty.  I made it the 2nd time with only 4tblsp, and it was just right.  I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of crushed rosemary, yummy. I think I may try it with buttermilk instead of egg the next time I make fried chicken.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

My boyfriend LOVES this recipe. Since I just make it for the 2 of us, I cut up 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts into strips, and use 2 eggs, 1 cup of flour, 2 tsp of roast chicken seasoning, 1 tbsp garlic, and about 10 grinds of my sea salt and black pepper grinder. We usually serve in caesar salad or with spaghetti.

This is definately one of the best fried chicken recipes I have tried. Very good flavor, the chicken is very moist and the outside very crispy! I have made it several times and found it a little salty, so I did not add any more salt other than the seasoned salt. I also had a problem with the crust burning, but it still doesn't taste burnt.

This was very moist, tender and juicy.  I followed the recipe but scaled it down to six pieces.  I'm a Southern girl and I do love "fried" chicken.  This is one of three recipes that I've found on this site and really love.  This is the simpliest of the three.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Delicious! These are a big hit every time I make them. I was skeptical about cooking them in oil on low for 10 minutes, but man, that must be the secret, these are so juicy (NOT greasy) and flavorful! It doesn't hurt to kick the seasoning up a bit, and sometimes I rub the chicken with cajun spices before coating when we want something with a little bite.

I made this the other night for dinner. Good recipe. To the eggs I added some hot sauce (we like a little kick) also to the chicken before breading I added a rub of salt, pepper, garlic, and seasoning salt. I also flavored the flour with the same. I dipped the chicken in the flour then the egg then the flour again once all pieces were covered I let sit in fridge for about an hour..then deep fried at 375 YUMMY! Outside was nice and crisp and the inside juicy and moist. Had only 1 piece leftover...which was fed to my 6yr old the next night and the chicken was still moist and the outside still cripsy!  Next time I will let the chicken sit in the hot sauce a bit longer...other then that GREAT!!! Will be making this again!

I have been trying to make fried chicken like my mother-in-law for over six years with no luck. When my husband took his first bite of this chicken he said, "You did it! You did it!" I was so happy with how this turned out and so happy that I found this recipe. The only thing is that I used my 10" cast iron skillet but didn't have a lid that fit so the step where you're suppose to cover it I couldn't do, but it still turned out delicious! This goes in my Keeper Recipes book. Thank you! : )

This is definitely a recipe I will keep for making perfect fried chicken.  I used a 5 pound package of thighs (10 pieces).  The meat came out moist and the coating was golden brown and crispy.  The flour-egg-reflour procedure is a definite key to keeping the coating adhered to the skin during frying--I didn't have a lot of trouble with it sticking to the pan or falling off.  I didn't add any regular salt, because there is plenty of seasoned salt in the coating.  I did add a teaspoon of pepper, however, and it blended well with the other ingredients.  I also didn't want to use up a whole bottle of cooking oil, so I used approximately 1/2 quart (2 cups), enough to fill my electric skillet about an inch or so.  It was more than enough.  I also increased the cooking time because I feel you shouldn't hurry chicken.  A minimum of 45 minutes total works for me.  I cooked it uncovered at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes per side, then covered it, lowered the heat to 275 degrees and cooked it another 10 minutes.  Then I uncovered it again, turned the chicken, increased the heat back to 350, and cooked it 10 more minutes.  I turned it one last time and cooked it for 5 minutes.  It came out absolutely delicious.

I am so glad I tried this recipe! I listened to others and let the chicken sit in salt water for ahile and also let the chicken rest for 10 min before I dipped in the eggs and refloured. The chicken was browned quickly so I turned the temp down on the electric skillet for the last 10 min and finished it off in the oven at 350 degrees while I fried the french fries. It was so juicy on the inside, but crispy on the outside. I added some cajun and alittle more of the other spices then the recipe recommended, for our personal taste. We will definately make this again.

Five stars from Greece! Best fried batter ever, juicy chicken inside! I used chicken breasts, and since there was no seasoned salt and I don't like garlic in chicken, my mixture was: salt, black pepper, sweet and spicy paprika, some oregano. And after the egg dip I coated twice in flour. We ate it with luke warm sweet corn.

Ditto to the last review!  This was wonderful and easy.  I added an extra coating of flour for crispier chicken and it turned out crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside.  Thank you Millie!!

This chicken was quite good, but not "great".  I did soak it in some chicken broth for awhile before cooking.  And as someone suggested, let the first coat of flour set before adding the next.  It was very moist and the coating stayed on better than any other recipe I've tried for fried chicken.  It just needed something else in the spices, I think.

Very good recipe. I used a salt free seasoning and only about 2T. since I was using kosher chicken (already soaked and salted). and added only 1 tsp. salt to the flour mixture. It stuck to the chicken vey nicely but it didn't have that crunch I was looking for when biting into it. It was crispy don't get me wrong but I like that really crunchy coating that crackles when you bite into it.

My husband is a fried chicken snob.  He ABSOLUTELY loved it!!!  He said " Do not change a thing".  I followed the recipe exactly except I used alot of ground pepper in the flour mixture and a little more Lawry's season salt.  I make this twice a month.  It's a must try!!!

I made this chicken for supper tonight and it was pretty good.  I followed the directions exactly but scaled to 4 servings and used only chicken breasts cut in half.  The only minor change I made was to use lard instead of vegetable oil.  The end result was good, but could have been a bit more flavourful for us.  The chicken was super moist though, so we'll likely make this again!

Absolutely incredible fried chicken.  Nice and crispy on the outside and very tender on the outside.  If you're cooking on an electric stove, make sure to be super careful when lowering the heat and covering the pan because the stove takes a while to cool down and the oil could overflow (not much fun to clean up).  I don't make any other fried chicken anymore - this one is just so amazing!

The chicken was uber bland without the outside crust, and the seasoning was only mediocre. Try doubling up on the seasoning. I definitely wouldn't plan on making this if you're starving..it takes forever to cook!

OMG!  I can fry chicken.  This recipe is so good.  I was very impressed with it and very proud of myself for being able to fry chicken.  It was quite easy.  I did run out of seasoned salt so I added extra salt and some poultry season.  I think I might do that again.  Plus I soaked my chicken in salt water for a few hours before frying.  I think this added a lot to the flavor of the actual chicken and it also helps tenderize it.

Oh baby this was good!!  I've been looking for just this recipe - who knew?  I used boneless breast cut into tenders and cut the recipe in half.  I fried it in my cast iron skillet and it was the bomb!  Thanks Sue!

This receipe is definalty a winner.  My husband is not a big chicken eater but loved it and wanted the leftovers for lunch the next day!  Very easy and all the ingrediants were in the pantry.  I used boneless chicken breast instead of whole chicken pieces.  EXCELLENT!

We had this for dinner tonight.  With the exception of my 11 year old, who doesn't like anything, it was a hit!  The chicken was tender and juicy and the batter was crisp and delicious.  I used boneless skinless breasts and they came out just fine.  Great, easy meal.  I will definitely make this one again!

We really liked this recipe.  The chicken had a nice coating and was very moist.  I liked that I had everything on hand and did not need to make a trip to the grocery for something special. I found this to be and easy recipe and I had no problems with it. We will enjoy this recipe again. Thanks Sue

I didn't care for this recipe at all and I won't be making it again. Would be better if the chicken was seasoned as well as the flour.  The chicken was not flavorful and the seasoned flour was bland.  I'm giving it 2 stars because it was edible, but not very appetising.

This is the best fried chicken!  I too scaled it down to just feed a couple of people.  This is the first fried chicken I have made in which the breading actually stayed on and was nice and crispy!  Very good recipe just as is!!

Actually I have been making this recipe for years. I use pepper and Cajun spice instead of all the different spices. This is a great dish to make for someone you are dating to impress them that you can cook.

Love the texture. I used boneless skinless and reduced the cooking times. You can mix up your own season salt pretty easily by googling the recipe. This will be my new go-to.

Loved this recipe.  I am 42 and had never fried chicken before in my life... and it turned out beautiful and delicious!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast cut into 1/4's and my cook time was about 12 minutes, turning it every 2 minutes.  I skipped the salt & pepper (since it already had seasoned salt) and added paprika instead.  It was just a crunchy as you would get in a restaurant.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is the first review I've written in years of using online recipes. This is the best, easiest, no-fail fried chicken recipe!! My husband and kids *LOVED* it and fought over the last pieces of chicken. They even asked if I really bought it from a nearby fried chicken fast food place and pretended I made it! Just follow the tips by other reviewers of letting chicken sit for a few minutes in between dipping and I just kept heat on medium and flipped chicken every 5 minutes for a half an hour.

This was my first time to cook fried chicken, and this recipe was fantastic!  My wife liked it better than her own.  I fried it in melted crisco like my grandma always did and it turned out crispier than oil-fried.  Will definitely make again!

Good base recipe. I agree with others that the extra salt to taste is unnecessary since you are using season salt. I used boneless/skinless Chicken breast and made nuggets my kids devoured.

The best fried chicken I've ever made! I skinned the chicken pieces and soaked them in buttermilk first, then drained them before the first layer of flour.  Followed the remaining directions exactly. Chicken was moist, tender and perfectly done on the inside, crisp and delicious on the outside. Thanks, Ms. Pasquinelli!

Loved this chix recipe! I've tried quite a few and this one so far is the best! Lot's of flavor! I will definately use again! There wasn't much egg for the dipping, so I added a little evaporated milk to the egg, but that's the only thing I changed.

Really good!! This technique of pan frying chicken is a keeper! The only thing that I didn't like about it is that after I uncovered it, it made lots of water..Like a lot of water! How do I prevent this? Should I it? I just want it to be a little bit more crispier, other then that though really good...my boyfriend ood and awwed over it and hes not even that big on chicken.

Tasted very good.  The chicken pieces I cooked took a bit longer to cook than as stated so not sure if I had temp. right or if my chicken was just thicker.  But I would not change anything else as far as ingredients.

I never make fried chicken but, wanted to do a traditional American picnic...Wow! Just delicious.I made it again to take to an outdoor concert.My friends loved it! Seems few people fry their own chicken these days...I soaked it in buttermilk before coating the second time around.

This recipe is fantastic! I am fried chicken challenged and even I managed to fry up a batch that rivals what my mother used to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it really came out perfect. Trust me, if I can make this good, almost anyone can.

Just the best! DO follow the instructions, DO soak the chicken 1st in ice water, and DO let the chicken sit before frying to give the batter & flour a chance to 'meld' together. Regardless of what seasonings you choose to use, the result of proper frying will give you GREAT results every time!!

FINALLY! A recipe for fried chicken that works for me! All other recipes I have tried the batter falls off in the grease but this one worked PERFECT. I used my own seasonings (lawrys, old bay, onion and garlic powder and Nature's Seasonings) and 3 eggs since I only had 6 whole chicken wings and it was perfectly done. I also used a deep fryer I bought from walmart which I think is also the key to keeping the batter on, no need to turn. Excellent recipe!

This recipe was really very good.  I'm not a big fan of trying recipes from sites online but I've changed my mind after this.  I made it exactly the way it was stated.  I did take the advice of the other reviews and left the chicken in salt water for thirty minutes before making it. This one is for keeps!!:)

Phenomenal! I added onion powder, paprika, basil and oregano to the flour because I didn't have any seasoning salt ( I used Kosher salt). The end result was delicious.

This was delicious! I didn't have seasoning salt so I used garlic salt. And in place of garlic powder I used ground chili powder and paprika. I tried to make fried chicken a few times before and it wasn't very good but this recipe made it very easy for me to make. Will use this again.

The chicken was a bit salty for my taste. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not add salt and pepper to taste, but it was still salty for me and my boyfriend. Otherwise it was very good and moist. I loved how easy it was. I already had all the ingredients in my kitchen. I might try using garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and it turned out amazing. Cut large breasts into quarters, cutting in half for both height and length. I then pounded them to uniform thickness. Doing this my chicken always turns out nicely done no matter how I cook it. (Cover the chicken with a sil-pat mat when pounding to stop any splatter.) The oil needs to be at least 350 but 375 does work best. I cooked mine for 3 minutes each side for thinner ones and 4 minutes each side for thicker ones. I recently became allergic to nightshades, and also can’t eat onion or garlic,  so I can’t eat any prepared chicken products any more. I am THRILLED to have found this recipe that creates a thick breading that is close enough to Chick Fil A to satisfy my tastes!!

I've used this recipe twice and it's awesome sauce, looks like a batch of KFC chicken, only thing is to let the chicken sit a min after the 1st flour dip so it coats nicely.

My family LOVED this! My husband is a fan of a certain popular (spicy) fast food chicken, so I marinated it in 1/4 C of hot sauce for about 90 minutes before following this recipe.  I did not add any extra salt - it would have been too much.  The breading was great and I didn't have trouble with it falling of while frying.  I did all drumsticks to make it a bit faster, and I did turn them a lot while frying to prevent burning.

Overall - really a great recipe, though time consuming  - will try chicken tenders next time.

This recipe was simple and produced a very flavorful fried chicken. I forgot how long it takes to fry chicken and decided if I ever make it again, I will use chicken breast tenders.  My family enjoyed this meal!

This is a wonderful recipe. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  This will be recipe that I always use for fried chicken.

I didn’t make any changes to this recipe and it came out amazing! I was a little nervous, as it was my first time making fried chicken, but it came out perfect! Golden brown on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. Will make again!

Super easy and so yummy! Had that extra crispy texture I've been looking for! Quick tip.....if using legs in a deep fryer, takes 20-25 min to reach fully cooked!

Delicious recipe. I season my chicken before putting it in the flour and I'm constantly turning the chicken to avoid burning it on one side and came out great

I made this in the air fryer. So in the air fryer of course you still get some flour so it looks a little bit white on some of the chicken parts. But as long as you don't mind that it came out really good. And very crispy.

been using this recipe for a while now and my family absolutely loves it! i am allergic to chicken so i use pork instead. i use boneless pork chops cut into two inch wide by four inch long by 3/4 inch thick nuggets. pan fry in 1/2 inch of oil at about 300-350 degrees F, for about four minutes per side. Delicious!

This recipe is excellent. This took me from a novice to a professional chicken fryer. I no longer like to buy fried chicken because nothing you can buy at a restaurant tastes as good as this. It is perfectly seasoned and juicy.

This is the best! Use vegetable oil, don't worry about the brand. The most important thing is to make sure the pan has a good thick bottom like cast iron and to use a thermometer on the oil. You will burn the chicken if the bottom is thin or if the oil is too hot.

This was great. Personally I would rate this 4.5* as I think the flour coating could use more flavour - maybe some spice. But given my husband polished off all the leftovers before they even had a chance to cool down, I can only give it a 5. I did find that I had a lot of leftover flour, so when I make this again I would probably only use 1/3 of the flour, which would probably also solve the slight lack of flavour issue.

I did add several other spices. onion powder, creole, chili powder, and sea salt. I used a deep fryer to cook at 375 then moved to stove top to cook at lower heat. I have a very large family so we made two huge packages of chicken legs. The entire family was pleased as were the neighbors who all came by lol.

Perfect crust, moist juicy chicken, 300 times better than any fast food. I used the breading recipe for chicken fingers. My chicken breasts were sliced four ways, and pounded a bit. I jazzed up the ingredients with celery salt, paprika, cilantro leaves chopped very fine, and a wave to the bowl of buffalo wing sauce. Made this boopie just the most spanky thing ya'all ever did see! My girlfriend loved it, and ate right down through it.

This was better than expected; I love oregano so I added some to the flour. It was a bit hit! The only thing I didn't follow (based on other reviews) was that I kept turning the pieces of chicken through out the process. It was crispy on the outside and really tender and juicy in the inside.

Perfect recipe. I have found the recipe along with cooking time best for bone-in pieces. When browning, I set my double electric burner on 4 (it goes up to 10), and when covered to cook through I set it on the lowest setting single burner. This has become a family favorite and definitely will make over and over!

This is my go-to fried chicken recipe. I use tenders and either pan fry them or drag out the fryer. Either way there are never leftovers! Kids and picky husband LOVE it!

Made this for my husband and I and it turned out GREAT! I did rest the chicken before I re floured and all the pieces came out cooked through and crispy on the outside. I will definitely be making this again.

I've been frying chicken for 30 years and it was good but this fried chicken was fantastic....it was moist and crispy, perfect. I used seasoned salt so I didn't add any additional salt but added about a tbsp of pepper. Next time I'm going to use this egg and flour combo on fried green tomatoes to go with the chicken.

Great! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that the coating was much too much for 2 pounds of chicken. I ended up throwing away most of it and ended up feeling like I wasted a bunch of food. I used 2 pounds of chicken wings - probably different if you're using a variety of cuts.

I haven't had much luck with fried chicken in the past.  One of my kids chose fried chicken for his birthday dinner.  The rule is NO restaurants.  Unless I wanted to pay the price for every future birthday dinner, I had no choice but to make it.  This is a very simple recipe and it turned out wonderful.  I didn't have the seasoning salt so I followed one of the recommended reviews and pulled up a mix up your own recipe off allrecipes.  This did take me more than an hour so it was time consuming, but I figure now that I know what I'm doing, it'll go much faster.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

yum....here is my tip for perfect fried chicken....invest in a deep fryer, especially useful for battered recipes such as this one.  The oil stays a consistent temperature, which means that not too much oil is absorbed.  The outside stays crunchy, and the inside gets done. The fryer has a lid, which prevents oil from splattering everywhere and also helps to cook the chicken thoroughly.  I drain and filter my oil, and it can be reused, at least once or twice.  Peanut oil is the best, but regular vegetable oil works too.  Oh, and let the chicken rest for a few minutes after the final flouring.  It helps it stick to the chicken better and keeps the coating from falling off in the oil.

Absolutely loved it. My kids, husband and mother in law all loved it and I was certainly amazed with how great it turned out for my 1st time of cooking fried chicken. with it I used homemade mashed potatoes with gravy and corn on cob. It was perfect!

I must say this recipe is great and extremely flexible. I added some meat tenderizer and Cheyenne pepper and it turned out wonderful. The crust is light and crispy, not overpowering like a lot of others, and the meat is very tender and juicy. Also, I made these in a deep fryer and cooked them for approx. 5-7 minutes at 375. I will definitely be using this recipe more ofter!

And juicy on the inside! (Plus they were great as leftovers!) I followed the recipe exactly. And flour egg flour def does help!! I cooked them in the deep fryer at 350 for 20 mins. I will def be making these again!! Thank you!!

This was the BEST fried chicken!!!  I have "tried" to make fried chickin in the past, but it was always burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside.  I decided I would give it one last try.  As another reviewer suggested, I used Wesson.  The chicken was so crisp, flavorful and juicy.  Amazing recipe, thank you!!  It was also a hit with the family!

I made my first ever batch of fried chicken this evening using this recipe and my husband said it was the best fried chicken he has ever had.  For the seasoned salt I used Cajun seasoning instead.  I also used a deep fryer instead of in a pan but turned down heat as directed.  Came out great!  Will make again and also would be great for chicken strips.

Love this recipe! I often have problems with chicken burning on the outside before the inside is cooked.  This recipe turns out perfectly without having to finish off in the oven to cook it thoroughally.  The flavor is wonderful on the crust and it turned out wonderfully crispy.  My husband loved this recipe - definitely adding it to my recipe book!

This is one of the best crust that retains and seals the chicken flavor and juices.  I omit the salt and pepper becauce of the season salt already present.  The chicken tasted great for immediate eating, the rest goes on a car trip tomorrow, I hope it holds up and remains as crispy.

I had never made fried chicken before, and this came out wonderful...moist inside, crispy outside and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time i tried to fry chicken myself and it turned out delicious, the whole family just loved it. As i didn't have any seasoned salt i just used 4 1/2 tablespoons of salt and australian chicken salt. It was a little too salty for me (but not my husband). Thank you soo much for the great recipe, this is a keeper!!

I used boneless chicken breasts and fried it in olive oil.  Came out nice and juicy.  Seasoning is tasty too.  Will make again.

My husband is a very picky eater and he found this to be the best fried chicken he's ever had and it was just the right amount of crispyness on the skin. I did it as is... no changes!!!

I have to agree with the other reviewers on this one - Too salty! I added a few dashes eash of onion powder and cayanne. Pretty darn good in spite of the saltiness. Hubby asked why I don't make chicken like this all the time! Will make again with decreased seasoned salt.

This chicken was awesome. It was my first time frying chicken and it came out great. I used breasts and drum sticks. I think the breasts were better. The batter is so light and crispy and really stuck on the chicken well. Will make again and again.

I too tried brining the chicken in salt water for about an hour before cooking. The chicken was tender and moist after cooking, and not salty at all. I added a lot of spices to the flour (oregano, poultry seasoning, old bay, paprika, basil, etc) to liven it up. Unfortunately I didn't add any salt because I read the other reviewers who said their turned out too salty and I was concerned that would be the case with mine as well. It did need the salt added, so I will do that next time. Chicken was very crispy, my husband loved it. Easy recipe for someone who's never fried a chicken before!

I really enjoyed this recipe. My family loved it as well. The only thing that wasn't too pleasing was that the second batch of chicken I made burned. Other than that, it was GREAT!

I made this last night, this was the first time I made chicken this way and it came out amazing, my family loved it! My husband said that every time I make it from now on to do it exactly like I did and not change a thing. I made 2 chickens and was left with one leg!

The description is right on; tossing it the second time with the flour mixture locks in the flavor and the juices!  My favorite fried chicken recipe!

Easy and delicious! My first time frying chicken, and it was perfect. I used a southern-hickory rub mixture in place of seasoning salt for an extra kick of flavor. I was a bit worried that the chicken wouldn't cook all the way through, but it was moist, crispy, and everyone asked for seconds. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I thought this was pretty good, but I should have added more seasoning.  It was a tad bland for me.

I loved this recipe!  When I make it again I will use less seasoned salt.  It was a lttle too salty for my husband and I.  It is the crispiest chicken recipe I have ever made.
