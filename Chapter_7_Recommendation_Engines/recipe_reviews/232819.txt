Put on your list to make for sure!!!  I used chicken tenderloins.  I dipped one side of the tenderloin in egg and placed egg side down on a layer of the  bread crumb mixture which I had ready in a glass 13x9 pan.  I pushed the tenderloins(strips) close together so there weren't any gaps.  I then put the cheese mixture on top and covered with another layer of strips. I put egg on top and then pressed bread crumb mixture on top of that.  Baked for 46 minutes and followed the rest of the instructions with sauce, etc.  Came out moist and heavenly.  Put on a bed of angel hair.

Delicious. Used 3 cloves of crushed garlic in the cheese . Also used Hunts Tomato sauce with onion and herbs to add at the end. Also used Tex Mex 4 cheese blend as cheese. The combination of spicy garlic cheese and tomatoes was heaven. Amp it up with any of your favorite herbs and you will not forget this. Served with angel hair pasta stirred with 3 big cloves of crushed garlic  and butter and french ed beans.

This recipe is a excellent base for a variety of ways to make baked chicken. I've made the recipe exactly per directions and it came out excellent. I've also changed the type of cheese I stuff inside(cheddar cheese and jalapeños) and type of sauce (mango habanero salsa). The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

I made this for a dinner party and it was fantastic - everyone loved it. I baked the chicken covered with foil then entire time, except the last 5-10 minutes to allow the breading to brown slightly, and the chicken turned out so juicy and tender. I decided not to pour the sauce over the chicken, and served it on the side instead. I would definitely make this again!

Nice easy meal, paired with a side salad and bread and everyone was happy! This will be made again in our house, might try throwing in a little spinach in the middle but it sure doesn't need any adjustments, good just the way it is. For this site I usually tweek or change the recipe in some way but not this one :-) thanks

I hate to be a downer when reviewing any recipe, especially a relatively new recipe but.... This was just so-so. There's nothing wrong with this, it's just a tad too bland for my liking. My husband seemed to like this, but I don't think he'll be disappointed if I never made this again. On a more positive note, I must say that the equivalents of each component (i.e. breadcrumb & cheese mixtures) was SPOT on. So many times I'll end up with a TON of leftover breading or filling ingredients. It's always a shame that so much goes to waste, but I didn't have that problem this time (hooray!). An Alfredo rice side dish and garlic bread rounded out our Italian-themed meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, CSLUSH. Even though I wasn't a fan, I'm glad to have given this a try nonetheless! :-)

This was great.  I added  a teaspoon of powdered garlic to the cheese mix and rubbed the fresh garlic on to the chicken before brushing with egg and covering with breadcrumb mix.  my whole family loved this.  I will definitely be making this again.

Used Mozzarella and Provolone for the cheese mix and a couple toothpicks to hold the chicken together.  Other than that, I followed this as exactly as I follow anything without measuring.  It was great! Even the neighbor kid who's about the pickiest kid I've ever seen loved it!
Thanks for a "keeper" recipe!

Great the way it is, but use more cheese (if you like a lot of cheese) because it does melt away.  Also, I made it so much easier by having the egg mixture & bread crumbs ready in 2 separate plates.  When you use regular plates, the egg wash isn't too deep.  Flatten the breasts, then lay 1 side of 2 breasts in egg wash, being careful not to coat the up side.  Then put the same 2 breasts in bread crumbs, and press down to coat.  Then put same 2 breasts in baking pan & fill them there.  Then just fold over & close.  Really great dish!

We really enjoyed this.  I also laid a strip of prosciutto in the middle and laid a whole leaf of fresh basil in the middle.  I also sprinkled Italian seasoning on top for the last 5 minutes of baking.  There were no leftovers!

I have made this several times for my family and they loved it, so I used this recipe to feed 30 adults for a recognition dinner. Everyone loved this dinner and several asked for recipe. There is nothing to change, the only advice is not to skimp on the cheese you use.

It was really flavorful and good but the chicken itself was still really dry. Next time I think I'll add more cheese in the middle and make extra spaghetti sauce.

Try adding mushroom to the stuffing. They will lighten the texture.

This was a hit with my family including my 2 year old. I followed the recipe exactly but used 3 chicken breasts so the cooking time was less. Keep an eye if you use more or less breasts. It was a simple prep time. :)

Turned out great. Had it over baked spaghetti squash and it was amazing. Everyone wanted this again. 38.3 cal/oz (wt) plus 7.7 cal/oz (wt) or 42 cal/cup for squash. I started with 3# 1.2 oz of chicken breast and we had two dinners for 3 adults and a child.  To calculate calories, I weighed each ingredient  (2756 cal and 70.0 oz total). We use spaghetti squash as a spaghetti substitute and love it.

I wanted to try a new dish tonight and this fit the bill.  I tried to stay as close to the recipe as possible without having to run to the store.  My Italian cheese was mozzarella and parmesan with a little Boursin.  I'm sure the "real" Italian cheese mix would have made it even better.   I used Prego Traditional sauce and added oregano and Italian seasoning.   I made whole wheat spaghetti as the base for the chicken, along with green beans and garlic bread.  The family said it was fabulous!   Thanks for sharing!

Oh my goodness!!! My boys loved loved loved this!!! I didn't have the Italian cheese mix so I just used cheddar. They went back for more :) also I just used Italian seasoning mixed in with the cheese to stuff it plus some garlic powder. I also did as someone suggested, put some pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan before putting the chicken in it. I'm definitely gonna make it again! :)

Made as directed, but I think suggestions made by others may help. I'll try again by using some cottage or ricotta cheese in the filling instead. You need to secure the breasts with the filling in so will use turkey skewers since tooth picks didn't work. I will use Italian Panko crumbs instead of the seasoned bread crumbs. If your serving over fettuccine you'll need more spaghetti sauce. Finally before baking I'm going to drizzle some melted butter/marg & put over the chicken breasts so the crumb crust will be firmer before adding the spaghetti sauce later as directed.

Tender, juicy and full of flavor.  I increased the ingredients to six chicken breasts (2 pounds) which increased the prep time to 30 minutes.   After cooking the stuffed chicken rolls  to 165 degrees F, I added 1 1/2 cups of sauce and substituted fresh mozzarella, dried parsley and grated Parmesan for topping.  
Excellent dish!

Chicken had a great taste but the stuffing was not pleasant. Followed the recipe and I think the amount of oregano was too much.

I think this is a very good recipe for someone else.  I just don't care for chicken with spaghetti sauce.  Don't let my rating stop you from trying this!

Very good. Cooked it just like the receipt. I think next time I will wrap a few slices of bacon around it just to kick it up a bit.

Excellent choice for a get together or just a meal during the week. I didn't change anything from this recipe like I often do except adding a side of linguini.

Very good!  I substituted mozzarella cheese mixed with some finely shredded cheddar cheese for the Italian mix, but it still tasted great.  The seasonings really gave it great flavor.

Easy to put together, flavorful,   keeping nthe cheese stuffing inside in the oven wasn't as bad as I expected.
Hint: Use crushed tomatoes for the drenching sauce. I adds a little substance.

A new family favorite! I alway add extra garlic to everything, so stuffing and coating had extra.  I also added some pepper to the stuffing and Tapatio, zucchini, squash and spinach to the sauce. It was great! And im a begginer cook!!!

I made this with only one change, I put fresh basil leaves on the chicken under the cheese. My family loved it. We are big fans of Chicken Parmesan and this was easier healthier and much tastier. Thank you for this recipe it will be added into my regular rotation.

So easy, so good. The only change made was the cheese only because I already had a Mexican blend on hand-so I used that instead of the Italian blend.

The only changes that I made was to increase the amount of cheese because my family loves cheese, but I have no doubt the original recipe is just as good. I will definitely be making this again.

This phenomenal dish has taken over for our chicken parmigiana recipe.   It has more flavor, frying isn't a step and it uses less pans and utensils.

Delicious. I used thin sliced chicken breasts, folded them over the filling and pinned them with a toothpick. The amount of cheese filling and breading was probably more than I needed for 1 lb of meat but otherwise it was perfect as written.

The only thing different I did was season the outside of the breast with a little salt and pepper. Other than that, I stayed to recipe. We really enjoyed it and it's going on my list to make again. It wasn't difficult and it keeps baked chicken from being boring.

this was very good and I am making it again this weekend with a few slight adjustments. I adjusted it for two servings and I found it needed a little more filling - this time I  will pound the chicken a little flatter and increase the stuffing.

This dish has become a favourite in our home with the exception of a few changes. I I used Parmesan grated cheese in the bottle and Cracker Barel Tex Mex cheese blend. I put 3 extra gloves. Instead of the sauce recommended,  I chopped tomatoes with Classico’s Basil Pesto. We love it.

I added minced bell peppers and spinach to the stuffing this was a big hit for ladies night!!!  Also use regular mozzarella cheese because I couldn't find the blend and it turned out fine. Also Gluten free Italian breadcrumbs work fine with this recipe.

This turned out so good on my first try! The only deviation from the recipe I added was to quickly pan-fry the chicken in a little olive oil after dredging in the egg & breadcrumbs, which ensured the outside coating was nice & brown & crispy. The filling of breadcrumbs, spices, garlic & cheese was flavorful & I loved the crispy texture on the outside & the gooey cheese & tender chicken on the iinside. Got 2 thumbs up from picky SO & will absolutely be adding this into the rotation. My goal when making it next time will be to try to cut down on the # of dishes used because I did make a bit of a mess during prep.

I didn't have Italian cheese so I used mozzarella cheese balls, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and Feta cheese instead. I also used fresh basil from my garden. I had some Italian salsa from a dish I made the other night so I used that to garnish the chicken instead of marinara sauce. I think I might have cooked it a bit too long as the breasts were a bit dry. It was a tasty dish and I will make this again.

I used chicken tenders instead of flattening and stuffing regular chicken breast. Turned out really great! We ate it with angel hair which is the only thing my husband would change (use ziti or penne)

this was amazing!  So fun to find a new recipe that is easy and wonderful.  The only change was how I put it together.  Once I put the cheese mixture in the chicken and folded it over, I brushed egg on it and then sprinkled the bread crumb mixture over the chicken.  Then I turned it over and did the same on the other side.  It didn't take the full 45 minutes.  40 was plenty with the aluminum foil on.  Then I broiled it just a couple minutes to make the topping a little brown.  Served it with a big chopped salad and a baguette.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I made this recipe with absolutely no changes for a dinner party of 8.  I doubled the recipe and it worked out perfectly. This was one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

I made it exactly like the directions and it was delish!  I did take the advice of another reviewer and used plates to put my egg wash on and bread crumbs, making it easier to bread the chicken.  I did bread the chicken first on both sides and then stuffed it with cheese.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a very good recipe!

I made as directed except I mixed a half cup of cooked Italian sausage in the filling. The chicken was tough and rubbery . The flavor was good, did I do something wrong?

Delicious and so easy to make! I used the indicated garlic, oregano and basil but used 2cups of Mexican 5cheese, added 1cup of mozzarella and 1/4 cup of Italian seasoned Parmesan grated. For the bread crumbs I substituted a packet of  original shakeNbake and added the Parmesan. I also used deli style ham inside each breast and marinara to top it off. It was to die for.

Aunty D

This was one of the easiest recipes I've made in a long time.
Was everything they said it was....very tasty, tender, etc.  Since I am a single woman, I will cut the recipe in half next time; however, the reheated leftover chicken was just as tender as the day I made it.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  Now I'm anxious to try other recipes I've copied from your lists.

This was a very tasty dish! The only change I made was adding a bit of ricotta into the cheese mixture. 
Next time I might substitute the garlic for garlic powder. 
I served it over pasta with steamed broccoli on the side. 
Thanks for sharing ??

Fantastic dish, I went over on the cheese and didn't use quite as much sauce...still turned out killer!! Use Italian Seasoning as needed if you're out of basil, oregano or don't have seasoned breadcrumbs.

I had some ricotta cheese that needed to be used so I added it to the filling and it was FABULOUS. Definitely company worthy! Served with asparagus and rice.

This was really good! I used 3 cloves of garlic and a bit more seasonings for the filler cheese. Only had 3 chicken breasts so I used the extra filler cheese to sprinkle on top at the end. Also, I didn't want to open a jar of pasta sauce to only use 1 cup so I just used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and added some Italian seasoning. Hubby and 1 yr old son loved it! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

It was a hit with my wife. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I used plain and added  Italian seasoning. Also a little extra garlic. Angel hair pasta and garlic bread.

I used cheddar and mozzarella instead of shredded Italian cheese blend, used plain bread crumbs with Italian seasoning added, and garlic powder instead of fresh.  I had to make the changes because where I am living , the ingredients I substituted for could not be found or did not have.  I cut the recipe in half as it was just the two of us, and made it using small chicken tenderloin like someone else mentioned,  Would I make it again, YES!

Loved this recipe!  The chicken came out so moist and full of flavor!  The only change I made was to put a whole jar of spaghetti sauce on it vs 1 cup.  This is definitely a go to for us!

My wife and I liked it. I might try reduced fat cheese next time to cut some calories, but it was easy and definitely a keeper!

This is delicious!  I used cheddar, parm and Swiss cheeses as I did not have the Italian cheese on hand.  Yumm!

I've been making this recipe for years as its one of my family/friends favorite..I make my own pasta sauce because I'm huge on flavor (olive oil, lots of garlic and Italian seasonings, fresh tomatoes reduced in skillet with olive oil,tomato paste, red wine and salt/pepper to your liking)

Instead of stuffing it with the cheese blend, I just fit a slice of salami and provolone cheese inside the chicken and continued with the recipe.  It was fabulous.

This is my favorite thing that I've made so far on here! My family devoured it. It's a little time consuming, but well worth it in the end.
