5.16.19  Used low-fat Greek yogurt and didn’t add the stevia because the blueberries  and coconut milk sweetened this enough for my taste.  You need to really like yogurt to enjoy this (and I do) because the tangy yogurt flavor dominates over the oats and even the blueberries.  This really is more like “yogurt with oats” instead of “oats with yogurt.”  If I make this again, I definitely would add more oats.  Also, this is a huge serving for one person, and more realistically, it serves two (at least IMO).  I like all of the ingredients in this recipe, but the proportions will need to be modified a bit for my taste preference.  Thanks for the recipe.
