This is a very basic recipe, however it does need a few changes and additions in order to turn excellent. I omitted the carrots and used red bell pepper instead because I think the pepper is more of a mexican veggie. I added a can of pinto beans (rinsed) for some protein, garlic powder, homemade taco seasoning and a lot of fresh cilantro. I don't think I would have enjoyed this dish without these changes, it would have been way too bland. Served with Avocado Mango Salsa recipe from this site.

This recipe needed some spices. I added 1 tsp each of cumin powder, garlic powder, oregano and chili powder. I didn't have carrots on hand, so I used green, red, and yellow bell peppers. The peppers give this a sweet smokey flavor.

I felt good eating these because not only are they super healthy, they tasted great, too! My husband and I both liked them. The only thing I would do different next time may be to add some spices like crushed red pepper and cumin.

This is a great springboard for a yummy and healthy fajita! I used garlic salt (sprinkled over the veggies) instead of salt. I also added a can of rinsed black beans and a can of tomatoes with chiles to the stir-fry instead of salsa at the end. My veggie-hating hubby ate three and raved about them! This is a real keeper! Thanks.

A great dish when using fresh vegetables. I add black beans and substitute sour cream for guacamole, though I don't think it needs either. Try it out!

I really did not enjoy these. I'm not sure if other raters are from areas that do not readily have fajitas but these were really lacking in spice and flavor and way too soggy. Very disappointing! I had my doubts when reading the recipe since it was really missing a lot of common mexican spices. Should have trusted my instincts!

Good Stuff! I added a red, a green, and a yellow bell pepper & nixed the mushrooms. Wrapped it up in a whole wheat tortilla and enjoyed! Thank you!

These are just OK. They were kind of bland before I spiced them up with some fajita seasoning. I will make these again but with the addition of the extra seasoning.

I loved these! I only added salt, pepper to my veggies and sauted them in coconut oil. Them when it was done I added lime juice. Topped it off with sour cream and salsa. WONDERFUL!
