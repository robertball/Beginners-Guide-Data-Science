This recipe was fantastic, thanks!

To those having problems getting a good "puff" out of your sopapillas, here are some tips, all of which are related to keeping your oil at the right temperature:

1. Use adequate oil.  You want at least an inch depth of oil to fry in.  Contrary to what some believe, more oil in the pot means less oil in your food, because the temperature stays more constant, and the food finishes cooking before it begins sucking up oil.

2. You need an candy/fry thermometer.  Don't trust strange voodoo methods like timing the cooking of bread cubes.  Don't trust your electric skillet's temperature controller (mine is off by about 75 degrees!)  Spend $10 and buy a thermometer.  There's no excuse to guess at the temperature when it's so cheap and easy to measure it.

3. Don't overload the oil.  When I made these, I was frying no more than 2 sopapillas at a time.  Putting food into hot oil is like dropping an ice cube into a warm beverage -- the food is going to cool the oil around it.  Putting a lot of food in will dramatically drop your oil temperature.  This is especially bad if you're also violating point #1 and not using enough oil.

HELPFUL TIPS THAT WORK FOR ME EACH TIME: It's very true that to get these to by puffy, you must get the dough as thin as possible.  I just make sure the oil is at a temp that if you enter something, it sizzles.  Never need a thermometer :)  Mine are super puffy if I let one side cook for 2 min, flip ...then another 2 min.  They taste exactly like they do at restaurants, and enough of a pocket inside to insert that warm honey.  And why stick to squares?  I found a star shape cookie cutter & used them.  Thought they were cuter.  Don't overload your fryer though because you have to leave time to hurry & flip.  Also, be sure to wipe off extra oil w/ paper towels!!!  Mine didn't taste greasy AT ALL doing it this way. :)

I've been looking for a recipe this good for over five years, and this THE ONE.  Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon and the honey they recommend, and serve with a scoop of Breyer's vanilla ice cream.  It's truly the best.

This recipe is wonderful!!  Light and tender... crispy and easy to cook all the way through.  I worked in a Mexican restaurant for a bit and we used to take the balls of fresh tortilla dough and just lightly spread/pull them to the right thickness & round shape in front of the fryer.  Instead of rolling & messing up my counter, I let the dough rest 20 min.... rolled it into 2" balls & then let them rest about 10 min. & pulled them like I used to. They turned out better than the restaurant's!  The last few had an extra 15 min rest and they were even better.  This will be my only sopapilla recipe & I'm using it for fresh tortillas too!  Thank you for the recipe!! **UPDATE**  I stuck several leftover balls of dough in the freezer..just to see what happens.   A few days later... HOLY COW!  They rose as they defrosted, and, when fried they were soo puffy that they were almost round & completely hollow.  I noticed a little bit of a crust on the raw dough just from air contact, but it was completely undetectable after fried.  How dangerous can it get with amazing sopapillas just minutes away with virtually no prep???  Thanks again.....I think  :o)

I'm Hispanic, and this is a regular dessert at my house. One thing I learned from my my mother was not to roll out the whole dough. Make small meatball size portions and roll out one at the time. They come out thin, puffy, and very crispy.

I made these to go with my Mexican Buffet for Super Bowl Sunday. Everyone loved them. They were quick and easy to make. I used a cinnamon, sugar mix to coat them with, while they were still warm.

PUFFING YOUR SOPAPILLA:  I realize this is somewhat an issue commonly discussed so I shall tell you all what needs to happen in order to puff your sopapillas.  When you drop the dough into your oil you should then proceed to spoon oil over the dough.  Yes, begin this immediately.  Once the sopapilla is puffed be sure to remember and flip it so that it browns evenly on both sides.  Don't forget that the dough needs to not be a thick piece, as a sopapilla should be hollow on the inside.  This will happen if you use thin pieces of dough.  I hope this helps everyone.  Good luck!

These were very good sopapillas. I followed the recipe exactly, and they puffed up when fried and tasted great. However, i strongly recommend rolling your dough very thin and making 100% sure that you oil is at 375 degrees when you start frying! The first batch of sopapillas i made were really doughy and tough because i rolled the dough a 1/4 inch thick. Rolling the dough much thinner (1/8 inch thick) made them puff up and become flaky. Also some of the more negative reviews said that the sopapilla itself was bland. Due to this i added a hint of cinnamon to the dough, but other than that i don't recommend putting anything else in them. Sopapilla dough is not meant to be sweet by itself. If you prefer sweet sopapillas i recommend drizzling a little honey on top of them and then dusting them with cinnamon/sugar. Over all this recipe turned out great for me. I hope my tips are useful :D

So good!  My mom, aunts, grandmas ... all have always made sopapillas but nobody ever writes down measurements.  They just say "You have to just go by the feel of it".  That just doesn't work for me.  This recipe was perfect.  The dough was a beautiful texture -not too dry, not too sticky.  After letting the dough rest for 20 minutes I rolled it into balls about 2/3 the size of a tennis ball and kept them covered with plastic wrap as I rolled each one into a 10" circle.  I cut each one into quarters.  If you want a more crisp sopapilla just roll your dough a little thinner and if you like a softer, thicker sopapilla just roll it a little thicker and lower the heat a little so it has time to cook all the way through.  You just have to play around with the thickness and temp to get them the way you want.  They are wonderful any way you serve them -with honey, powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar, stuffed w/savory filling, plain ... we love em!  They're not healthy at all so we try to only consume them on special occasions -like my mom's birthday today!!  Happy Birthday Mom!  They're a little time consuming and a little messy (anything you fry is) but they are so, so good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not see it mentioned, but the secret to having a puffy hollow sopapilla is to push it under the hot oil or to spoon hot oil over the top. If it is just laying on top of the oil, it will be flat instead of puffy.

This is a really basic, tasty recipe.  Be sure to let the dough sit for 45 minutes before rolling it out (I am high-altitude, so that may be why the longer resting period is required).  I often roll the fried sopapillas in sugar and cinnamon and serve them for breakfast.  If your oil is hot enough, these will not be greasy.  If you are not using a deep-fryer, you can simply drop a cube of fresh bread in your oil and if it sizzles, it is ready.  

If you make these large enough, you also have a delicious sandwich bread.  You can fill them with lettuce, tomatoes, and grilled chicken and veggies and serve them taco style.

These are soo delicious! I made them this morning for the first time for my daughter's pre-k Cinco de Mayo party and they were pretty easy to make. I doubled the recipe and there was no problem in that either. I used a regular, bigger pot with about an inch of oil in it and had it set at just above medium heat on my stove... I just let the oil heat up for 10 minutes before I added the dough. They fluffed up instantly. Then I filled a plastic baggy with cinnamon and sugar and once the sopapillas cooled down just enough so they wouldn't burn the bag, I put them in the bag, shaked it and they got a good coating.

These were very good. The initial batch I made came out like bread because I did not flat them out well. My next batch I flattened thinner and it come crispy and chewy with a nice air pocket. I cut them into a small square shape and fried them. When you first put them into the preheated oil, they sink to the bottom and then as they are frying they come up to the top of the oil. I suggest that once they hit the top of the oil turn them over, keep turning every 10 seconds or less, I think it gives a nice air pocket. Only fry 2-3 at a time for better results.

This recipe is awesome. Thanks for submitting it!! All my family and friends loved it!! If you want them really puffy try turning them over and over every few seconds when you first put them in.

PLEASE - if you make these, please try them with powdered sugar and a few drops of lemon juice - amazing.

If you like them crispy on the outside, then re-heat using a toaster instead of microwave.

If they don't puff up, roll the dough out thinner.  Make sure you turn often and DON'T overcook.

Wonderful:)

We made these for our restaurant's Christmas party and they were a HUGE hit!!!  The trick is definitely letting the dough sit awhile.  In fact, I made the dough at home and put it in a oiled bowl and it rested quite awhile before we even fried it up, maybe 1 - 1 1/2 hours and it was FABULOUS!!!

Delicious...exactly what I wanted.  Had a craving.  Found the recipe and tried it. Glad that I did.  Other reviewers are right...it is more dense than I thought it would be.  Thanks for the post.

i was glad i was a "good girl" all day because i lost all control when it came time to eat these!  two hints: be sure your oil is good and hot or your sopapillas will sink, take too long to rise, and be too oily.  also we found cutting the squares a bit smaller (use a pizza roller!) made the perfect little pocket to fill with honey.  YUM!

YUM!  I have never eaten a sopapilla before nor have I ever seen one.  Making these was an adventure into new territory.  All I can say is, when I dropped the little dough squares into the oil, I was amazed at the little pillows of puffiness.  I knew I did something right.  How amazing these would be cut into little hearts and covered with tinted sugar.  I coated these with a mix of sugar and  cinnamon and they were yummy.  Thank you Leaz for sharing your recipe and allowing me to have another first adventure!

I have been trying to find the perfect sopapilla recipe for years -- as a kid we'd get them at the Armadillo in Ft Collins, CO but I've never had them as good since...this recipe, as is, is perfect!  Soft, slightly doughy -- not like the hard crunchy  you get in most Mexican restaurants!  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Make sure your oil is at 375! Too low and they'll be oil-soaked! If you follow the instructions exactly, they'll be GREAT!!

Two questions: Can I use my deep fryer for this? If I'm out of shortening-can I use butter?

This was wonderful!  I had no shortening so I sub canola oil, and it still turned out prefectly.  Also used only about 1/2 qt of oil in a smaller but deep pan so I would not use up all my oil.   Turn often to get them to puff and crisp just right.  Dusted with cinnamon and sugar and serveed with honey.  Big hit with the kiddos!

Wow!  These are the best ever!  So quick and easy.   Only thing to be careful of is keeping the oil hot enough...if the temp goes too low, they don't puff!  SSOO delicious with honey, cinnamon, and sugar!

I made these tonight. I'm SO tired because I only cooked them 2 at a time and the recipe made like a billion, but I had to take the time to say how wonderful these are! I had never even heard of sopapillas before today, but I will make these many, many times more. I followed the recipe exactly, but used like 1" of oil because its all I had. I also didn't have a thermometer, so I winged the actual temperature of the oil. When they were done, I coated half in confectioner's sugar, and half in a mixture of sugar and cinnamon. I buy donuts all the time for like $4 for a box of 9. This recipe made literally like 60 sopapillas and probably cost just over a dollar. I never thought that so much wonderful could come from a little all-purpose flour and some water. Thank you so much whoever submitted this recipe!

these are pretty good!  i found that frying until "golden brown" was a bit too much for us, so only frying until lightly golden is perfect.  i was afraid they would be more like a pie crust texture, but they're chewy on the inside, flaky on the outside!

These sopapillas were definitely good, I made them for friends who said they were very good. One thing about the recipe though, you definitely need to have the dough much thinner than 1/4". We had them that thick at first and they turned out horribly, but then we flattened them as much as we could and they were much much better. Top with honey and cinnamon.

after you let the dough rest for 20 or so minutes, kneed it about 4 times and that will create even more fluffiness. I put chocolate chips in the middle and folded it over and made those for my kids so good, and it does work for tortillas as well just buy a press and there you go

YUM!  Very good and authentic New Mexico sopapillas.  Yes, if you go into an authentic Mexican restaurant, especially east of the Mississipi, they will not have these on the menu.  They originated in New Mexico, and are mostly found in the southwest...unfortunately for those of us who are transplanted on the east coast!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Seriously ... it's this easy??  Why did I not know this years ago??  Followed recipe exactly.  They puffed up and everything.  Just make sure the oil is 375 as the recipe says.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  You've made myself and my family very, very happy :))

Just the recipe I have been looking for. This recipe is also perfect for tortillas, just roll the dough into small balls, roll out thin, and cook on a comal (or skillet). I even used half for sops on one day and refrigerated the rest to make tortillas a couple of days later. As a chicana, these things are everyday food, but my grandmother never wrote a recipe, so I was always guessing amounts. Not anymore! Thanks for the recipe!

these are ok if you must make them without yeast. Growing up in New Mexico the sopapillas we ate were made with yeast to puff up and could be stuffed with meat, beans, if you didn't want them sweet.  In a hurry for a sweet these are ok.

This recipe turned out excellent for me on the first try, and I am certainly no expert  when it comes to cooking.  I made these for my home group through church, and they couldn't stop eating them!

I used a 1/2 gallon of canola oil and put it in a medium-sized pot on medium-high heat for about 10minutes.  I sprinkled the tiniest bit of flour in the pot to check when it was ready.  When it sizzles and cooks the oil is ready.  I cut the dough probably 2x2 instead of 3x3, and I put no more than 7 in the pot at a time.

I had no problem with the dough fluffing, and I didn't even roll them out that thin since I was pressed for time.  I'm thinking that the key here really is the oil amount, temperature, and quantity of sopapillas in the pot at a time.

I pulled them out of the pot of oil onto a serving dish with papertowels so some of the oil would get soaked up.  As soon as I finished cooking all the sopapillas, I rolled them around in a large bowl with sugar and cinnamon, using a spoon to make sure all sides were covered.  Then, I served them with honey on the side.

What others say about them being a same day food is correct.  I brought the left overs to work and they weren't as good.  However, one co-worker stuck a few in the toaster oven for a few and said they were much better leftover that way.

You should definitely try this recipe.  It's really easy.  Just be mindful of your oil quantity and temperature!

This recipe is wonderful.  I sprinkle the sopapillas with powdered sugar, add a scoop of ice cream and then drizzle with warm, sweet butter sauce (  Found listed under "apple cake and butter sauce" recipe on this site).  Actually drizzle isn't with word for it....I drown the sopapillas in butter sauce...yumm.  For my daughter's birthday, I made these instead of cake (I cut the sopapillas in to fun shapes like butterflies and flowers).  They were a hit.

I having been looking for a recipe like this for YYEEAARRRSS. I grew up in Colorado where you get this type of Mexican food...not found out here in California too much for some reason.  I made these for my family and they LOVED them. I agree with all the previous suggestions of rolling reallll thin, turning frequently in the oil and using either lots of honey after draining or rolling in powdered suger out of the fryer. I will probably 1/2 the recipe next time cause these need to be fresh out of the fryer in the whole families opinion. Also rolled dough out and cut some of the pieces in circles and fried into little bowls for ice cream. Used the "scraps" as regular Sopapillas.

Just made these for my son's Arizona State Fair project. This was my first time deep frying and it wasn't as difficult as I'd thought. 

I only had 12 oz of organic high-heat safflower oil so I used organic coconut oil (so much healthier) for the balance. The sopapillas were so light and such a pretty gold! (Didn't taste the coconut at all.)

I spent about 30 minutes trying to get the temperature close to 375. I bought a candy thermometer and this was the first time I used it. It only goes up to 400 degrees, but at one point, the oil was far hotter than that! 

Once I was able to control and moderate the heat, the frying was a breeze. I had a nice rhythm going with the new dough going in and the golden, crispy dough going out.

I didn't flour the board enough so when I spatulaed the dough off the board, it accordioned and I had to flour my fingers and stretch it back out. I quickly learned a few things (as long as you're not as concerned with looks or pockets): 

It definitely doesn't have to be a perfect square--or a square at all.

There is a lot of leeway (though you can't really walk away from the oil) between light golden and dark golden--they all tasted good.

If you can successfully lay the square on top of the oil, you get a nice bubble. Pockets seem hard to come by, but again, this was my first time out.

You can make these as 2" shapes and get many more out of them. I started off big then experimented with small and ended up with about 80! 

An easy recipe!

I've made these in my deep fryer several times with awesome results. They're very tasty with honey and my guests continue to beg for more. The dough keeps well for a few days if wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in the fridge.

i made these this morning for breakfast! I mad the dough last night. wrapped it and stored it in the fridge, rolled the dough these a.m.. i let it set for a few seconds will getting the oil ready and on the stove. this allowed it to rise just a tad and it created the "poof" when frying. if you roll, cut and fry right away, you will have "flat" bread.  these were yummy.(I had added a tsp of cinnamon to the dough.)

Reminds me of being back home in AZ! Tasted great! I even made some using cookie cutters for the kids and they came out puffy and held shape.

So Easy!  I just had a fry pan and some olive oil so I put the oil in my pan about an inch deep.  I heated it until just about smoking and then cooked my scones perfectly.

These came out great! I don't have a deep fryer, so I used a cast iron skillet and heated up the oil on medium-low heat. I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on them while they were hot and they tasted great!!!

These were really tasty! I made them for taco night with friends, and served with vanilla ice cream, honey, cinnamon, and whipped cream.  They were a hit.

I have a little fryer that only gets to about 350 degrees, but this turned out great.  They cook quickly and puff up nicely.   I halved the recipe which made 16 triangles.  Served with honey butter (equal amounts of honey & butter) and some cinnamon sugar.

Made these on Christmas Eve and they were a hit with my extended family. All were gone within five minutes! I shook half of them in a baggie with powdered sugar and half of them in a baggie with cinnamon & sugar (only shake 2 per bag at a time). Served with honey, couldn't be better!

Excellent! I made these for my son's Mexican themed kindergarten potluck and they were gone in a flash. I fried them on my stovetop in a pan with oil set on medium heat. Dusted w/powdered sugar & topped w/honey. The house smells great! As for reviews stating they're inauthentic - these are just like the ones you get in a restaurant.

Great recipe! 

Here are some tips from other reviewers and some I noticed myself:

-Make sure you roll the dough out VERY THIN

-Drop the dough in and immediately begin spooning hot oil over the top of the sopapillas. Do this until they start to puff up- then flip them

-I put leftover dough in the fridge overnight and made them again for breakfast :p lol - Anyways they puffed up even more than when the dough was fresh

-Also, I saw someone commenting about needing an oil thermometer- I didn't use one- I heated the oil on Med-High heat for around 8 min. If you flick water into the oil and it sizzles and pops it's ready.

Enjoy! :)

I had been looking for an amazing sopapilla recipe for a good while and I finally found this one and I loved it. But to make it exquisite I found out you have to be careful in the details. Now I've made it many times and it's been a hit every time. And I'd like to help others enjoy it that much too. So here are my suggestions:  1. Follow the proportions of the recipe and the instructions as written. (And for those of you in Europe, you can use lard instead of Crisco) 2. Make sure to let the dough rest in a warm environment for about 20 min. after kneading it. 3. As you roll them out on the table make sure to have them no more than 1/8" or 1/6"  inches thick. Too thick will not puff right. 4. You can use vegetable or sunflower oil. Just make sure it's at least an inch and a half deep in the pot you're using and make sure you are using a thermometer for the temperature of the oil. 5. The oil temp MUST be kept at 375F for best results. That temperature is crucial for the sopapilla puffing up and frying right. 6. Make sure to turn them a few times on each side during the frying. 7. Serve them hot and serve them right. That means not by themselves. I serve them with the amazing brandy butter sauce on top found at Don Pablo's and powdered sugar. Here is the secret recipe for the sauce: 1 1/2cups salted butter. 1 cup powdered sugar. 1/2tsp. cinnamon. 2tbs. Brandy (or rum). 2tbs. Dekuyper buttershots. Melt these in a pot and boil for 1min. Stir constantly. Enjoy.

This is a perfect sopapillas recipe!  I have wanted to recreate this dish for years and tried over a year ago on new years and it failed miserably.  Since finding this recipe I have made 3 batches and every single drop was snatched immediately.  TIPS: If you want puffy then your oil must be at minimum 375 degrees F.  Roll them thin and don't undercook.  Give them a minute or two on one side and you will notice it rise to the top and puff after that.  flip with tongs until lightly golden on each side and discard to a paper towel.  I make mine the following way: Fry chips, place on paper towel, dust with powdered sugar/cinnamon/scant pinch of salt(the extra salt boosts all the flavors and helps with all the sweetness of the way I make them).  Heat oven to 425F.  Place dusted chips in baking dish.  Grate mozzarella cheese in a nice layer covering chips.  Drizzle a fair (for us, god awful LOL) amount of honey.  Bake for 5-7 minutes until cheese melts.  OMG just try it! I know cheese might seem weird to some, but it is truly a whole new way to indulge with this recipe.  10 Stars!

Made this for a get together - went over FAMOUSLY! I used cookie cutters to make fun shapes, and thinly rolled out dough made these puffy, and fabulous. I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them right out of the fryer, served with honey, and was applauded. THANKS for making this zero look like a hero!

I've never had sopapillas before, so I don't know what the flavor or texture is supposed to be like, but these were really good!  They puffed up beautifully and cooked just perfect.  I decided to serve them plain as an accompaniment to Beefy Spanish Rice by Donna L.  My daughters thought it was great to bite open the ends of these and fill them up with the rice and meat mixture.  I can't wait to try them with honey!

These came out perfectly!  I followed the directions exactly.  As one of the previous reviews noted, I rolled out the dough a little thicker and left the rolled out dough to rest as long as I could and it puffed up beautifully!  Just with some sprinkled cinnamon and honey drizzled on was very good.  I did make some very thin ones first with cinnamon and sugar and they tasted just like mexican buñuelos!

The batter came out entirely too gooey. I had to add about 1 cup more flour to make it workable. They puffed nicely. This recipe is close to my original but I will keep searching (I lost my recipe) This is definitely a good starting point and it made A LOT!!!

Very good recipe, same as my grandma makes them.  But I fry mine in shortening not oil (I know its not good for you, but it tastes delicious!) If you have a problem with having them puff up you need to get your fryer a bit hotter and also if you just push them under the oil a couple of times they puff real nice.  I like mine thick so that is the method I use to have them puff nicely :)

this was so not good. i will admit that i didnt use all purpose flour. instea i used whole wheat. yes it was milled so id didn't have husks or anything in it. it still should taste about the same as regular flour would in recipes. not here. they were so bland. i had to keep checking the computer to make sure it didn't say to add sugar or something. the restaurants must add craploads of sugary sauces that you don't notice the blandness. someone wrote that they are used with meats and stuff... totally can see that. but as a dessert?! no way. im making funnel cakes with my leftover oil

These sopapillas were so easy and so tasty!  We made them as the dessert for a Mexican-themed meal and our entire extended family loved them.  We dusted ours with cinnamon-sugar and let people drizzle honey over theirs as desired.  Highly recommend this recipe!

Wow! These are so delicious! I almost don't want to share them with my husband! Took them right out of the fryer and into the cinnamon sugar and...just...wow. These are...heavenly! Flaky, doughy, puffy heaven. I had them at a Mexican restaurant Friday night and had to have them again...and this recipe is perfect! Thank you so much for posting it!! And they're so easy. It's dangerous.

I loved this recipe! we had some stuffed with taco fixin's and some rolled in cinnamon sugar and stuffed w/ice cream.  The advice to let it rest is crucial.  I rushed the second batch and did not let it rest after rolling and those did not puff up as well as the first batch that I let rest for about 3 minutes after I rolled it out.  Otherwise, the best thing ever! My kids asked that these be on the menu every week!

I have been living outside of the US for several years and had been missing Mexican food. So I started looking for things I could make myself to satisfy my cravings! I came across this recipe and it is really easy and tastes great to! Even better served warm with honey drizzled inside or served with ice cream....mmmmm!!!

This worked out wonderful for my husband and I. I halved the recipe, and the only change I made was adding 2 teaspoons of white sugar. Even though it was halved, I actually only ended up using half the dough and the other half is in my fridge. Hopefully it'll work out just fine when I make them again with the refridgerated dough. This was a perfect end to our Cinco de Mayo celebration. Thanks!

This recipe was simple and delicious!  Making sure that the oil was the right temperature and turning the sopapillas continuously beginning immediately after dropping them into the oil ensured that they puffed up perfectly.

Awesome!  I made these with 2 cups reg. flour and 2 cups wholegrain spelt flour to make them a little healthier, and they came out great!  Between myself, hubby, and the 3 kids, the entire batch was gone in a span of a couple of hours, topped with homemade Chilean manjar, YUMMO!

Oh my goodness, these were wonderful! If you want them chewy, roll them out a little thicker. I serve mine with honey butter sauce and they taste ALMOST like Don Pablos.

This recipe was excellent! I was born and raised in New Mexico and now live in California and I have asked several friends if they know how to make sopapillas and they have no idea what I'm talking about. I have even asked in mexican restaurants and they have no idea either, one place thought I was talking about bunuelos (they're more of a crispy version of sopapillas.) Thanks to your recipe I can make these at home and my family and friends can all enjoy them! Funny how my friends never heard of sopapillas before, now every time we have a get-together they always ask for them! Thanks again!

I made these for a Mexican fiesta dinner party, and they were a HUGE hit! No one could believe I made them from scratch and that they were so easy to make. Thanks for all the tips - keeping the oil hot and the dough thin is certainly the key to a good "puff". Serving with honey drizzled over the top is absolutely essential (I could see how they might be bland without it).

My family loved this recipe! It was very easy to do.  I used a stand mixer and a dough hook and mixed it until I had a nice soft dough. I separated the dough into little balls.  Then I rolled each ball out really thin before frying in a large deep stainless steel electric skillet set to 360-65  degrees.  They puffed beautifully. We  smothered the tops in honey butter and ate them warm. Yum! It made a lot.  Next time I'll save half the dough in the refrigerator for later.

When I searched out this recipe I was trying to duplicate the sopapillas served at a Mexican restaurant chain called Don Pablos.  I've had "real" sopapilla's in Mexico and all over the west/southwest and their version is the only kind I like.  I guess it's my junk food upbringing, but this dough was a big disappointment for me.  It was so bland no amount of powdered sugar, honey, honey butter, vanilla ice cream, or cinnamon (yep, I tried them all) could save it for me.  They prepared and cooked just as was promised.  I didn't have any problems with puffing etc...  They were just so bland I felt like I was eating vanilla ice cream and communion wafers.  I realize bland pastries and crusts compliment sweet sauces and filings, but my palette wasn't having it.  So if you're like me and you prefer glazed donuts to cake ones, cookie crumb crusts over traditional lard ones, and cool whip over meringue then make a funnel cake instead.

EXCELLENT. THis was perfect. And I thought the thicker ones popped the biggest, but almost 100%. The dough can rest more than 20 min. In fact the second half set out for more than an hour and still worked perfect! THANK YOU for sharing this.

This is a great recipe and even better as a base recipe. Using the milk makes a great texture. I cut the batch in half w/o a problem but then also mixed in lots of cheddar cheese. They were great cheese sticks. We tried the reciepe with and w/o cheese and both were great. Will make again.

These were okay...pretty good once you put honey on them, but not as good as I expected.  Definitely stick to the tip to roll them out thin if want them to fluff up.  I had to roll them VERY thin order to get them to fluff up.  Overall I think I'll stick to recipes I've used that use yeast...they fluff up much more than these.  This one isn't a keep for us.

Worth all 5 stars!! I had sopapillas years ago when my grandma took me out to eat at a Mexican restaraunt and I loved them, but have not had them since. I made a mexican dish tonight for dinner and decided to try these - they were awesome and easy!  I added about 1/8 tsp freshly grated nutmeg to the flour mixture. I dusted the finished sopapillas lightly with powdered sugar and served them with honey. My kids LOVED them! I will definitely be making this recipe again.  THANKS for sharing :0)

Was pretty good, oil has to be very hot, for maximum puffiness. 

I stuffed mine with carne adovada (pork marinated in NM Red Chile sauce, garlic, salt, and oregano, than baked.) Garnished with Shredded Cheese, black olives, a dallop of sour cream, and, lettuce, onion, and tomato. I also like to eat with honey as a dessert!

I helped my 16 yr old neice make these for her spanish class.  The dough is much like my mexican mother-in-law's flour tortilla recipe.  I let the dough set for an hour or so before rolling and cutting.  When they were done, we dusted them with cinnamon/sugar.  She said they were gone in minutes.  Will definitely make these again for home consumption!

wow! these were just as i remembered from my trip to texas. to ensure the dough was going to be flakey enough, i let the dough rise for 2 hours near a fireplace ( it's pretty cold here!)i downsized the recipe to serve 6, which used only a cup of flour, and this made a perfect size circle of dough. i then used a pizza cutter, and cut wedges. it was perfection! i sprinkled a mixture of cinnamon and sugar over it.
i could not make and serve them immediately, so i put them in the microwave for 15 sec. I placed 2 triangles in a bowl, topped with vanilla ice cream, and drizzled warm honey over it. DELICIOUS.

If you don't want this as a dessert, you can leave out the cinnamon and sugar and fill the dough with refried beans or anything else you would like. It makes a nice treat if you're tired of tacos or burritos.

These are very good - just made them last night for Cinco de Mayo.  I was suspicious of the dough, because it seemed very sticky, and it was hard to lift off the counter after they were rolled.  All that happened is I didn't have perfect little shapes, but odd, twisted pieces, which didn't seem to bother anyone.  I served these drizzled with honey and then dusted with cinnamon sugar, which was great.  Our local Mexican restaurant (not authentic, but good) does the same but also drizzles with chocolate syrup.  That should take care of any need for additional sugar!

I really liked this recipe although I do have some minor complaints:
1) It needs sugar or SOMETHING to giveit flavor INSIDE the dough. I gave some to try to all my family and it really needed the sugar in the dough. (We all can't handle honey) I know we could sprinkle it on top but it causes mess.
2) I could make more than 2 dozen with this recipe. I think it should be stated here in my review so others will know. I made like 3 and still had more dough left over!! I followed the recipe exactly. While that is a plus, I didn't have much family over at the time!! We had so many left it was unreal! 
Well, it was a good recipe to try and I'll mke it again, but maybe slim down the recipe a little.

I followed what one reviewer suggested and froze the dough in 2" balls so that all I needed to do when ready to make these delicious treats for my Mexican meal was pull each dough ball into a flat square and deep fry. WOW! They were delicious! Rolled them in cinnamon sugar and drizzled honey. We loved them. And they were so easy, too.

Sopapillas are a New Mexican treat, and this is the most authentic recipe. They are not supposed to be sweet by themselves, they are little fry breads that you top or fill with. I saw a couple of reviews where they used the same dough for tortillas...me too! Awesome! Lots of good pointers, two being to make sure your oil is hot enough, and to completely submerge the dough when starting to fry. I always put them in a large basket with paper towels to absorb extra oil. PERFECT!

When hot I dipped sopapillas in a cinnamon sugar mixture, and served hot with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh berries, a drizzle of caramel sauce and whipped cream.  It was amazing!

Really, really, really loved this recipe. A little advice, don't add the water all at once, because you might not even need all of it. And I found it better to mix it with my hand rather than a spoon, and I divided pieces into small balls and rolled them out into big, thin circles, found it easier than cutting. But it was a really good recipe. Would definitely use again!!

Perfect dough for sopapillas - to get them to puff up so that you have a hollow center for honey or agave roll the dough or to 1/8"

Excellent.  And so easy.  I was nervous making these for the first time at 9 o'clock at night for a Mexican themed luncheon the next day.  I followed the recipe exactly except adding salt, only b/c I didn't have any, but I would add it if I did.  After resting for 20 minutes, I followed someone else's suggestion to roll out balls of the dough.  So I divided my dough into 8 balls and cut into 8 triangles each w/ a pizza roller cutter.  Made 64!  I brushed melted butter on and rewarmed in the oven at 400 for 6 minutes for the luncheon.  I topped half w/ cinnamon/sugar and honey/chocolate sauce and served w/ ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these, following the recipe exactly with the exception of swapping half the AP flour for WW flour, which I normally do, and they came out pretty dense with little rise. I made some the other night, following a different recipe that did not have shortening in it, and those had rise, but were still a bit denser than I would prefer, which I attributed to the WW flour, which is why I chose to try this one. I think I'll go back to the other recipe and try it w/out the WW flour and see if that makes them more tender so I know that that was why. I may try this one again, with straight AP flour, but only after I've done the other one first, as I had better success with it (btw, the other one was an Indian Frybread recipe that I found on AllRecipes.com, basically the same thing).

Great recipe, I haven't made these since home ec in the 9th grade. Tried them on a night I made tacos for the main course. Temperature proved crucial. 375 lets them brown and puff just right. After rolling in cinnamon and sugar, drizzle with honey. Sounds too sweet, but it is just right. And the warmer the better.

This recipe was very good! I added a few of my personal touches to it. I used about a tbsn of cinnamon, and 2 tbsn of organic sugar to the dough :) I also rolled mine in some sugar too :)

An excellent recipe! Mine turned out perfect during both tries. I didn't bother waiting after making the dough--baking soda shouldn't require a proofing stage. Will definitely be making these again and again.

I've made sopapillas for many years.  I used to just make them with tortilla mix.  I wasn't sure how to make up the mix on my own.  This recipe was perfect and my sopapillas puffed up beautifully.  The kids love them!

My first batch wasn't good because I had the oil too hot.  The dough burnt within 5 seconds of being in the oil.  Once I cooled it down to the right temp, they were great.  My son now wants them every night.

One of our friends is always talking about how he misssed his mothers sopapillas, so for his 77th birthday I went searching for a recipe and came upon this one.  I am so glad I did.  Birthday boy was in 7th heaven, he used one as a pusher for my husbands 'chili verde', then couldn't get enough of them for dessert.  He said they were as good as his mom used to make.  Birthday dinner was a success.  Thank you Leaz for the recipe.

These were GREAT!  A lot easier than I ever thought they would be & I will be making these again for sure!  Some were puffier than others, but they were all very good!  I did one at a time in a large saucepan since I do not have a deep fat fryer.  We sprinkled with cinnamon sugar right after pulling from the oil. This one's a keeper - thanks for posting!

I only make half the recipe and that made a lot. I rolled them super thin and had no trouble getting them to puff up.  Everyone was standing around in the kitchen eating them and eating them... They are so good and easy to make! I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them when they came out of the fryer.

I use this all the time to make Navajo Tacos & it works great. A little heavy for just scones I think!

I was so happy to find this recipe! I have loved sopapillas for years even though I have only had them once or twice. You must drizzle with honey! I bet a chocolate sauce would be great too.

I made these for a dinner I catered and they went over pretty well. Not as well as the fresh beignets I made a different time, though. The dough on these are pretty plain, and definitely needed either a powdered sugar coating or some honey. People in the crowd liked them both ways. Don't get me wrong, I was still munching them down quite a bit! Given a choice though, I'd rather make the beignets because they had a much better flavor. The dough was workable, though, and it fried up pretty well. Thanks!

I too cut the serving size down to 6 and found the recipe to be a great one.  I used baking soda instead of baking powder (on accident actually), but it seemed to work just as well. Rolling the dough on a flowered surface helps with the sticky part.  My 2 year old son loves it when I cut them in star shapes with a cookie cutter and fill with peanut butter and jelly.  My husband stuffs them with beans, meat, and rice.  It's a great alternative to tacos (and a little more fancy than our standard hamburger helper meals)  :)

Ok, well it must have been something I did, because of all the great reviews, but mine did not puff up.  I tried rolling them thin, rolling them thick, letting them sit, different shapes and nothing would work.  Fresh box of baking power so that can't be it.  The dough was good with honey, so I'm at least giving it three stars for that, even if it wasn't puffy like a sopapilla.

I may of done something wrong, because sopapillas were very dense and not airy and puffy.  Other than that they were delicious, but dense.

Made these for the very first time tonight for my fiancé who asked for them. Followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect! They did puff up better if you turn them several times as soon as they go in the oil! Definitely making again!

I followed the recipe exactly, but the amounts shown will make too much for a couple.  I quartered it down.  That made 3 or 4 for the two of us.  Each time they have come out delicious, so I bought a small deep fryer to make it easier.  I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, drizzled with honey.  Side of vanilla ice cream made a wonderful dessert to follow our Mexican feasts.

I used actual lard like traditional recipes call for, I also followed instructions to use warm water (activates the Baking Powder, Which makes the “pillow” effect), and I waited the required 15 minutes- I think that helped it ‘pillow’ properly.  GREAT RECIPE! ????

Pretty decent recipe--and I agree with New Mexico Man--sopapillas are from New Mexico, which has a whole different type of food.  It's not Mexican.  It comes from Indian fry bread which the Native American have a strong influence in the area.

So easy! Took advice to roll very thin, so it wouldn't be greasy. It had a great puff, it was crisp and delicious. I was too eager and only let the dough sit 10 minutes. I didn't have shortening, just used butter. It turned out great! I sprinkled mine with cinnamon sugar and ate with honey.

Basically, sopas are fried biscuit dough. But, to get the really good puff sopas are so liked for, you have to have steam and steam requires water. This recipe, which I made exactly according to the recipe was a little low on water. The taste was real- very authentic. And the texture and crust were worth bragging about. But, without that magical steamy, tender hollow inside, they are not what I like in a sopapilla.  Next time I make them I will add a tablespoon or two of more water and I think they will be a big hit.

I should have read the previous reviews before making these. I didn't get the "Puff" because I didn't get the oil hot enough. They were still very tasty!

I substituted self-rising flour for the all-purpose flour after reading that some people had difficulty getting their sopapillas to puff up. I think the dough expanded in size because I ended up with a LOT of sopapillas: probably about 70. We couldn't eat them all and had to give them out to neighbors! When they were still warm, I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar and served them with honey. They were delicious, and I feel like I'd definitely make this recipe again (only I'd halve it first).

Made this recipe to go with chicken enchiladas and black bean salsa. It worked beautifully. The recipe is easy to follow, and the sopapillas came out crispy and delicious. Will try cinnamon and sugar or honey next time. I agree with another reviewer, that at least one inch of oil is needed to give them that puffiness. I used a saucepan on the stove since I don't have a deep fryer, and they popped perfectly!

Love.  Puffy, soft and perfect.  Just like the ones I grew up eating.  First day we eat them with honey until we can eat no more.    The next we have stuffed sopapillas.  Just stuff with meat and cheese.  Love.

Easy and nice dough to work with.  Followed another review and did not roll, but just flattened out with fingers into a round shape.  Puffed up nicely in the fryer.

Pretty Good Stuff. I added  a cinnamon sugar to the top of the sopapillas when they came out of the fryer which the kids absolutely loved. Top it with honey and they were gone before I even got to serve them. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent results from a simple dough. I use lard as the shortening and frying oil. Fry at 375 for good puff and miminal oil absorption.

Oh WOW! This recipe is excellent. I usually use a mix, and eat the sopapillas with honey, or I stuff them with seasoned beef, refried beans, cheese, and sour cream, but I didn't have any mix, and this recipe looked just as simple. I actually prefer this over the mix! They taste so light and flaky and they puff up like magic. Just make sure to have the oil hot and deep enough. YUMMY!

These were delicious but a little too crisp for my taste. I like them nice and soft. :)
Still, they were really good and very simple - the recipe halves wonderfully but still makes a ton!

They didn't get very brown like I thought they would.  However, they did puff (yeah!), and the flavor was very good.  I did not use a deep fryer...I put about 2inches of oil in a deep cast iron skillet instead, on medium heat.  That could account for them not being brown.  Very good taste!

This recipe is great but it is more of a flatbread rather than a sopapilla. It's good but not light and fluffy like real sopapillas should be. I have a recipe for sopapillas that are light and fluffy that I may share here later. Thanks for this recipe though! I enjoyed it. Delicious. I used it in a savory dish with spicy beef, cheese, sour cream, lettuce and tomato. Yum!

These worked very well for me.  They puffed up nicely (per instructions on rolling them a little thinner).  I haven't perfected them yet, but they were so easy to make I'll definitely keep trying.

Although this sopapillas recipe didn't turn out as good as those served at my favorite Mexican restaurant, it is one that I still enjoyed.  I would suggest rolling the dough thin.   Serve with warm honey butter and sprinkle with powder sugar. The recipe as it is does make a large quantity. Wonderful treat!!

This was an outstanding dessert! Try brushing with melted butter and drizzling with chocolate syrup or powdered sugar. These were a huge hit at my New Year's party!

Excellent recipe!!  Twice I made these for my daughter for high school functions.  However, I used a 2 1/4" round cookie cutter and generously sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar after frying.  They turned out great and disappeared immediately upon serving.  Thanks!!
