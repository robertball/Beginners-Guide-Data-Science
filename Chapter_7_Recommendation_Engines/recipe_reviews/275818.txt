The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, but it was WAY to cheesy so the sauce didnâ€™t come out right. I tried it again and omitted the mozzarella and used sun-dried tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes and it came out great! I will make it again with those changes.

I wouldn't recommend making this recipe, the mushroom flavor is very overwhelming. Might be good if you cut down the amount using only 1/3 of called for.
