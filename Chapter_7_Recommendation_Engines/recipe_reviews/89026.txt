These were delicious! I needed a recipe to use up rucola, and this was a nice twist! I do not assemble and refrigerate them in advance. The first time I had fresh crispy bread and I wanted it to stay crispy ;-) and now I just assemble them just before eating. Or I just put all ingredients on the table and everyone assembles them as they like (using more or less of every ingredient to taste).
Thanks for the great recipe!

I served this  at a bridal shower and everyone thought it was great.  Instead of using a 6'' sub I used a whole french bread and cut it into 5 mini sandwiches with a pick to hold it together and that seemed to be plenty with a side of pasta and a side of fruit.  Everyone loved the artichoke garlic paste.

Wow!  So good!  I made a couple of small changes- I left the soft bread and did not tear it out, and I served it warm.  To serve warm, I wrapped each sandwich in foil and put it in the oven.
The flavors blend together so well.  It tastes like a high-end deli sandwich.

These were very good even though the bottom of the bread was soggy (thats why I gave it only 4 stars)!!  I didn't see this problem with any other viewer.  I used a crusty Italian loaf but might have taken out too much of the inside bread.

I made them for tailgating at the horse races and they we're perfect - make ahead and just slice the sandwiches there with the wrapper on.  Couldn't be easier!  That artichoke spread was awesome but it could have used more of it so next time I'll double the artichokes.

Will definitely make again. I didn't have roasted red peppers so used sun dried tomatoes in their place.  Can't wait to use the peppers.

Very good.  I didn't care for the roasted red peppers (personal taste), but otherwise, loved them.

Good but not out of this world.  Don't add salt (to the spread).  Canned artichokes, salami and cheese are salty enough!  Use arugula instead of spring mix.  I used spring mix and my husband said, "you know what would make this taste good? Arugula."

This is such a tasty recipe, love this sandwich ! But be careful you don't want to breathe on anyone after you eat this.
