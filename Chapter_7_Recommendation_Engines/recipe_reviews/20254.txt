I've made this recipe for guests and family and have always had rave reviews. I've learned to look for smaller apples as I find it difficult to strech the quartered puff pastry dough over the larger ones. It is now a staple dessert in my family. Really great!! Pat

This dessert was so easy to make and it was a huge hit at my party.  To save time, I made the dumplings in the morning and put them in the refrigerator.  I baked them during dinner so that they were still warm when it was time for dessert.  The kitchen smelled heavenly.  Everyone requested a copy of the recipe.  I can't wait to make this again!

I always hate when people change stuff about the recipes but still review them, but I did that with this one.  Sorry!  I did everything exact except that I chopped the apples rather than using halves.  It was delicious.  I tried it first with one sheet of pastry and they were gone within 5 minutes of coming out of the oven.

I tested this recipe today before making it for a dinner party this weekend and it was a big hit. I made a few changes by adding 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar, I also added some rum soaked golden raisins and some walnuts. I will definatley keep this recipe and make it again and again. Thank you so much for a wonderful treat.

This was just awesome. They were easy to make, looked great and tasted even better.  With a little scoop of vanilla ice cream, it makes the perfect fall dessert.

I made 2 different apple dumpling recipes from this site this fall and the other one FAR out does these.  These are easy to make and beautiful presentation but lacking in flavor and difficult to eat.

YUM!YUM!YUM!i followed the others' suggestion and halved the sugar mixture, lessened the cinnamon, and cut up the apples. i also ended up using 1 big fuji apple. it tasted a bit like apple pie. i might experiment with other fruits too. i also served it with vanilla ice cream. truly a keeper! thanks

These were pretty good.  Next time I think I would prefer to cut up the apples more.  The sugar and cinnamon didn't really penetrate through to the core of the apple.

This recipe is so delicious and easy!  I made it for a dinner party.  Everyone was impressed with how fancy they look.  And, they all wanted seconds.  I have made this recipe about 4 times in the last 4 weeks!  It is a keeper~

Delicious recipe.  I made the recipe as written the first time.  After that, I made just a few changes.  Instead of 1c. white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of an equal mix brown/white sugar.  I also decreased the amount of cinnamon (to taste) and chopped the apples into coarse chunks.  I've also used this recipe with fresh and canned peaches.  I think you could use any type of fruit filling for a quick and easy personal sized pie.  This is a definite keeper!

Excellent!  I made this for my husband and some friends and they ate them ALL in about a half hour.   Delicious!!!  I actually added the icing straight out of the oven (didn't bother waiting for the cool down) and really liked how it melted over the dumpling - didn't have too much frosting which was perfect for us.

I will be making this again (and again)!

I tried it with the chopped apples and the cinnamon was SO strong. It was almost unedible. I will try this style again but with caramels.

Great Recipe!  I did tweak it slightly by using half the ingredients, including the number of apples (chopped).  Was a big hit with my family!  Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I tried this before taking to friends for Thanksgiving and I'm glad I did.  The seams did not stay on half of them so there was no apple inside and the brown sugar looked black.  My taste testers liked the ones that turned out right, so I will try again.  It was extremely easy to make and I like that.

This was an amazing dish! The filling caramelized beautifully and the pastry was golden and crispy.  Then add the sweet glaze and we have a winner! Will make again.

These were a little bland for me. I prefer more flavor to my dumplings. I think maybe the glaze is very neccessary since we used ice cream instead.

I turned the oven a little lower than suggested (400 for the first 15 minutes, 325 for the last 25), but otherwise made them exactly as directed.  They are delicious and very impressive-looking.  A big hit with my family!

The sugar mixture is too much, I think. I'd halve it in future. Also, I left the icing out. I didn't make dumplings, but rather, I made an apple strudel log shaped pie out of this. Still, the apple filling from this recipe tastes better than the very basic Apple Strudel filling I used to use for my apple pies.

Amazing recipe! The first time I  halved the recipe and left off the icing due to popular request, and everyone raved about them. The second time, I chopped up the apples, which seemed to let the mixture really come together- and they were even better! (Still no frosting, though; will try that next time.) Great recipe!

My husband liked it a lot.  I thought it was okay, I think I prefer a traditional apple dumpling better and I think he liked the pastry puff.  I might combine the two next time.  I also thought the apple was  a little over cooked, he thought it was fine.  I think I will try whole apple cored and stuffed next time.   Easy and worth a try.

I didn't like that I had to eat them the same day (which is true by the way). And I ended up with way too much of the cinnamon sugar mixture leftover. But it was good. Not an overly sweet dessert.

Good base recipe.  I chopped up the apples and they mixed well with the spices.  Perhaps because of this, the cinnamon was a bit too strong (I should have known considering how much is added to this mixture).  I would cut the cinnamon by a third next time.  I don't think that the icing is necessary (and can be a bit messy) so I would suggest trying some with and some without to see which you prefer.  Might make this every once in a while with a few tweaks, but won't be a regularly used recipe.

Nice recipe.  I made half of the recipe because I didn't need 8 servings at the time but between my boyfriend and I we ate all 4 servings!  As suggested by previous reviewers I chopped the apples into chunks, didn't use the bread crumbs but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  My puff pastry got too brown even after reducing the temp. as directed.  Maybe the starting temp. should be 400.  Anyone have an opinion on that?

This is an awesome recipe.. Very easy to make. I chopped the apples and like another reviewer i only used 2.  Also next time i will make only half of the sugar mixture.  I had at least half leftover. The crust is so nice and flaky and the apple mixture is yummy.  I had fears of a liquid mess but everything stayed right where it was supposed to be.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were really good!  I cut the apple halves in half and served them with vanilla bean ice cream.  My daughter and boyfriend gave them thumbs up as well.

I chose this recipe because it used puffed pastry instead of pie dough, and it looked to be the easiest. I made it today and I LOVED it! The only problem I ran into was the cook time; the dumplings were done 5 minutes after I turned down the heat to 350 degrees (for a total of 20 minutes in the oven). The apples were cooked all the way through, too. I have shared this recipe with my friends on Facebook, and I will keep it close by to use over and over!!

These were so easy.  Tastes like an apple turnover.  Like others, the next time I make these I will cut down quite a bit on the cinnamon. It was a little overpowering but still delicious. The recipe makes 8 and my husband ate 4 of them in two days. So it's very good. Oh one more thing I left off the icing. They were great without it. Reheats just fine by microwave too.

AMAZING... I made it with red delicious apples, because that was all that I had on hand, and I served it with vanilla icecream.   To eat the next day, just re-heat in oven. I thought that it tasted even better, since the spices had a chance to marinate. I may chop up the apple next time just to make it easier to eat. Over-all, Great recipe.

I wish I could give these 10 stars!  HOLY COW they were amazing!  My husband was literally unable to speak because he was eating so fast!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I just used flour instead and I also used about half of the amount of cinnamon called for.  These are heavenly!!  Serve them warm with ice cream and you have a fancy-schmancy, but super easy dessert!  Thank you Allie for these awesome apple dumplings!!

This was good but next time I will cut the apple in pieces and bake for a shorter amount of time. Everything was done but it was hard to eat. Also, I sprinkle the tops with raw sugar before I baked them.

Very delicious!  Like other reviewers, I chopped the apples first and followed the recipe otherwise.  Nice crispy, flaky crust, done-but-not-mushy apples, nice spice.  Over all very good!

These didn't stand a chance on the counter! I scooped ice cream on them while they were still hot and they were inhaled! I chopped the apples up, like some of the other reviewers, but next time I will try the apple halves. These are easy and delicious!!!

I made these last night and they turned out pretty good. The only problem I had was that all but one popped open (my daughter says they blossomed) almost immediately in the oven and so the corners got a little burnt and crispy. 

I didn't put as much of the cinnamon/sugar mixture as the recipe called for because it just seemed a little excessive and I believe a tiny dollop of butter under each apple would have carmelized the sugar better for a more uniform taste throughout.

Super delicious! I made these this morning as a New Years Day breakfast treat.  I used Macintosh apples instead (only because I forgot which kind was specified while I was at the store) so I cut the sugar in half.  I also skipped the drizzle so it wouldn't be too sweet for breakfast but I think I'll add it anyway next time.

These were easy and good! I could tell immediately 3 tblspns cinnamon is way too much. I halved the sugar, using combination of white and brown sugar, added two teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 tspn nutmeg, and less than 1/4 cup
bread crumbs. I followed suggestion to
chop the apples (2 was enough), and the biggest thing was working the pastry dough to make sure I sealed the edges. I'm sure I'll improve. Anyway, some liquid did run out, but they were 
excellent. Will make often, thanks Nyred!
