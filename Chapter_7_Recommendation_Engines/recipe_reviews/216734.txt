This was pretty good. I think next time I would add something to give it a little kick. Some sort of spicy pepper. So it's sweet and spicy.

This recipe was great! Only problem is that my jar of orange marmalade was bad. I had a little bit of apricot preserves and raspberry preserves and mixed them together. It worked and had a lot of flavor. I can't wait to try this recipe with orange marmalade. My kids ate it even my picky one.

Good dish. I added fresh broccoli for the last 5 minutes and served with wild rice. Complete meal. Easy and affordable. I only used 2 chicken breasts that were cut to bite-size chunks. It even looked pretty which is an added bonus! I will do it again. Great fresh citrus taste.

This recipe was not to my liking. The orange and the ranch did not go together.

The chicken did pick up the taste of the orange marmalade and ranch quite nicely although the sauce cooked up much to thick for the amount of chicken and really was more of a thick coating for a few pieces of chicken. I think maybe adding more chicken broth or cutting way back on the cornstarch would get it more saucy.

This recipe has a lot of potential but as is it doesn't quite hit the mark. If I were to make this again I would probably double the marmalade for a sweeter tangier sauce. I might also make more sauce so that it doesn't just coat the chicken but flavors the rice as well. The chicken was a little overcooked after being cooked fully before cooking the last 10 minutes. Next time I would probably not cook chicken completely before covering.

This is one of the best and easiest chicken recipes I have ever made. I used lower sugar marmalade and it tasted great. I was leary of the ranch dressing and orange but it worked very well together. The sauce was quite thick so instead of stirring the cornstarch directly into the sauce I chose to stir it into more of the broth then added it to the pan. Next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces to shorten the cooking time and allow the chicken to cook more evenly. This is definitely a keeper!

Easy. I cut up the chicken and mixed it with the rice before serving. Refreshing citrus flavor. Good pantry dish - nothing special.

This was easy and delicious. I doubled the marmalade because I like it so much and added a little red pepper. As others suggested I cut the breasts in smaller pieces. Very tender and tasty. Served it with white rice cooked in chicken broth and peas. Will definitely make again!

It was delicious! Minor changes: used 1/2 the ranch packet and added a few splashes of sriracha for a spicier flavor. Next time I will bread the chicken and cut in small pieces-this would make a great orange chicken sauce!
