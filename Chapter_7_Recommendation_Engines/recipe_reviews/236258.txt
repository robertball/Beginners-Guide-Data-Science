These are really good! I made mine with blueberries. I also made them into 8 regular sized muffins and baked for 18-20 minutes. They turned out great!

I tried these out for the family because i wanted everyone to be able to have breakfast at the same time! Came out really cute and everyone enjoyed. Will make without syrup next time because the kids still put it on top and I don't want to give them sugar overload.
