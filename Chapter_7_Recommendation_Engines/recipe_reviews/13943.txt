Fabulous recipe. After I cooked the eggplant I put them in a baking dish, sprinkled with mozzarella, parmesan and spooned jarred sauce and place the tray in the oven until the cheese melted. Easy and very good.

I used a large eggplant, sliced 1/2" , cooked in nonstick pan.  Then in the baking dish, some sauce, the egg plant layered, the rest of the sauce topped with mozzarella cheese.  baked while some spagetti cooked. then broiled to brown the cheese....delicious!
(and as someone else mentioned, salt the slices and let sit while mixing the egg mixture, pat the moisture off and the bitterness is greatly reduced)

My daughter & I love eggplant parmesan. We wanted a quick, easy way to make this dish just for the two of us. We were both very pleased with the outcome of this recipe. I peeled and cut the eggplant thinner that it called for. I then fried the eggplant and put it in the oven set at 200 degrees with it topped with cheese to melt while I made spaghetti. Delicious dinner!

YUM, YUM, YUM!  This recipe was delicious!  Everyone raved.  I couldn't believe how fast and easy it was.  The only things I did differently is slice the eggplant about 1/4 inch thick, instead of 3/4 inch and I peeled about half of the peel off of it in verticle strips around the eggplant.  I used 1 Tbs. olive oil in a non-stick skillet, it cooked all the way through and nothing burned.  Served over whole wheat spaghetti made for a perfect meal.  THANKS!!!

Excellent use of eggplant!  I can't imagine an easier or quicker way to make a tasty, healthy dinner.  I left the peppers out of the sauce and added garlic salt to the bread crumbs.  Eggplant was not soggy at all - it was soft inside and crispy outside.  Will definitely add this to my recipe box!

Pretty good & easy, but it was still too hard after frying so I popped it in the oven for a while. Sure beats the stuff from the frozen section of the supermarket though.

I have to agree with the Chef...........it is better to go through a little more effort and bake it in the oven..........this is OK if you are in a hurry to eat.

This is the easiest and quickest eggplant parmesan I've ever made! Though its not like the real thing, this is very good for a quick meal, or for using up eggplants without alot of effort! Thanks for sharing!

This was a quick and easy recipe to try.  I didn't read the instructions as good as I should have and ended up frying the eggplant on med-high instead of med so they were a little scorched, but still delicious.

I just sliced my eggplant, dipped in egg and panko, layered with homemade sauce from fresh tomatoes, peppers and garlic, parmesan and mozzeralla and baked for about 45 minutes on 375.  The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the whole dish is amazing.

GREAT! I made a few changes though. 1. Didnt have any egg, so I used a little mayo mixed with milk to dip my eggplant in. 2. Sliced my eggplant into 1/2 in rounds. 3. Set oven to 375 and baked slices till golden brown. 4. Made my own sauce made of crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, garlic salt etc. 5. After slices were baked to a nice golden brown I pulled them out of the oven and THEN spooned my sauce and sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. I found that doing it this way keeps the crusty outer parts of the eggplant crispy bc they aren't soaking in the sauce. My and my husband really liked this recipe.

Quick and easy! While I'm still working on my pan frying skills and this was my first time cooking eggplant, everything turned out perfect! The recipe couldn't be any easier. I used one of my home-grown eggplants and then used some store-bought pasta sauce and angel hair pasta to finish out the dish. This one's a keeper!

Simple short recipe!  I used Panko crumbs. To make it a 1-course meal, I made my own sauce with tomato paste, garlic, yellow squash, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, basil & oregano and I added cheddar cheese to the other cheese. I also peeled & soaked the EP for 30 min  in salt water, drained & dried well. Fried in light olive oil before baking.   Served with french bread.

This is a great recipe and just what I was looking for!  I also baked it to brown the cheese (at 250 for about 20 minutes).  Also, I doubled this recipe and it did well.  I used half seasonsed bread crumbs and half panko crumbs which added a nice crunch.  Also, I added some chopped red and green bell peppers to the top of the casserole when I was baking it for some added vegetables, flavor, and color.

It turned out great, except my eggplant was very large and after frying the pieces, I layered them in a casserole dish, topped them with the mozzarella, pasta sauce and parmesan cheese and baked at 425 degrees for 10 minutes.  wonderful dish.

I was delighted with this recipe because both my one yr old and my picky two year old ate it! I am normally a super healthy eater but was craving eggplant and had hardly any ingredients in the fridge after being out of town...used light mayo instead of egg to adhere bread crumbs and used extra parmesan to make up for no mozzerella on hand....tasted delicious but will not use much oil next time.

So easy and fast on the stovetop!  I sliced my eggplant thinner (1/2") and it still took about 8 minutes on each side before I added the cheese to melt.  Great recipe for a quick dinner with on-hand ingredients.

Fantastic Recipe! Just make sure you let the eggplant set out (sprinkled with salt) a little before hand - it helps to take the bitterness out. But this recipe was quick, easy and delicious!

SOOO fast and easy. I'm thinking you could also bake this to make it healthier but I used my cast iron skillet and it was ready in no time.

This was my first time eating and making the dish.  I suggest you peel the eggplant before frying it, I found the skin too bitter and the texture was weird.

I also found I liked the taste of this dish the 2nd day as leftovers. I didn't add mozz cheese to the frying pan as suggested, but I did sprinkle the eggplant liberally with garlic salt once out of the fryer.

I then layered the dish like a traditional lasagna, and baked in the oven until the cheese on top was bubbly.  

Yum.

First - I am NOT an accomplished chef.  I can barely boil water without burning it but I made this last night to go with a pork tenderloin.  It was simple, quick and WOW!! Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  Raves from all around the table.  I may try cooking it in peanut oil next time but just following the recipe and YUMMY!  I had never even had eggplant before. I'm definitely making this again!

Great quick and easy recipe.  My husband loved it and he is not big eggplant fan. I followed other reviewers suggestion and cut the eggplant into 1/2 inch slices.  Also I used a medium-large eggplant so I quadrupled the sauce and used a healthy 1/2 t of red pepper.  Placed the finished eggplant in a 250 degree oven for the cheese to melt while I finished making the pasta and side dishes

This dish is unbelievably easy and good.  I also sliced my eggplant into thinner slices.  After I coated the eggplant in bread crumbs, I dipped it in the egg and then the breadcrubs again.  Serve over a bed of pasta and everyone will be impressed.

Wonderful recipe.  Very easy and tasty.  I did take other reviewers tips and after frying the eggplant, I placed on a baking sheet and spooned spaghetti sauce on and topped with cheese then baked until cheese was bubbly and slightly browned.  Family (even my son who is a picky eater) loved it.  I served it with left over spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread.  What a hit!!!  Will definately make this again.  This is the first year we have grown eggplant in the garden but will from now on for sure.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

It probably would have turned out good if it told me how much oil to use and if it said to bake it after frying it. I should have read the reviews before trying this. I ended up throwing it all away and going to whataburger.

I was looking for a quick way to make eggplant parm and this recipe was just what I was searching for. Was very tasty! I changed things a little by heating the tomato sauce in a separate pot while the eggplant was cooking then I put it on top of the eggplant when everything was done. I put the shredded cheese on and put a lid on the pot for about 2 or 3 minutes and the cheese melted and it looked and smelled great. Red pepper flakes kicked it up a little which I liked and I had plenty of leftovers. Great and easy dish.

First time eating eggplant & I loved it. Only thing I changed was putting the crushed red peppers in with the dry bread crumbs instead of the sauce ... 2nd helpings were emjoyed by all.

I used one ovenproof pan to panfry the eggplant, then top with the already prepared sauce and cheese. Right in the oven to heat the sauce and melt the cheese (350 for 15 minutes or so) with only 1 pan to wash!  Excellent dish.

I didn't know I liked eggplant until I tried this recipe!  Quick to fix and very tasty for a side dish or meatless main dish.   I dipped the eggplant in flour before the egg wash and patted it firmly into the crumb mixture (I used half seasoned bread crumbs and half Panko to total 1-1/2 cups).  I had to add a little more water to stretch the egg wash.  I also used more sauce because we like it that way.   Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish!

Liked that this cooked on stove & finished in microwave.  I did not use red pepper, used  1-2 tablespoons olive oil & in addition to mozzarella cheese, I blended a bit of shredded sharp cheddar which added flavor.  I also layered eggplant with the cheeses & needed to add more spaghetti sauce.

Tasty! I took the advise of another review and cut the eggplant thinner to 1/4 inch and  cooked the eggplant on the stobetop. The crispier, the better. Delicious and fast.

I have never had eggplant parmesan before and this was really tasty. I cooked the eggplant per the recipe directions. I then sprinkled the parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes over them in baking dish. I poured the sauce and the mozzarella cheese over and then baked it for 12 minutes at 350 degrees. Very yummy.

Very good!  I used my own spaghetti sauce from the Spaghetti Sauce Mix recipe on this site.  I cut eggplant at about 1/2" slices.  It did take longer to cook than the recipe specified but it was worth it.  As others suggested, I baked the cheese in a 200 degree oven for a few minutes, then turned it up to broil to brown the cheese (and the garlic bread) a little.

Yummy recipe!  Made great leftovers, too! To cut some of the fat, I fried the eggplant in a nonstick skillet with only 1 tsp. of olive oil and used reduced-fat (Kraft 2 percent) mozzarella. Served it over whole grain penne. YUM!
I used Barilla bottled sauce but overall found this dish to be kind of salty (even though I looked for the lowest sodium breadcrumbs I could find), so next time I would omit the salt when boiling the penne to make up for it.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing.  I have never cooked eggplant before and was worried about the results but the whole family loved it!  I used one good sized eggplant which made about 14 slices and after frying and assembling it I sprinkled it with mozarella and baked it in the oven for 30 minutes.  I omitted the red pepper flakes as not everyone in our family likes them and just added them before eating.  I will be making this recipe often!

I'd never made an eggplant parmesan before. It was very yummy and suprisingly as many others comment my husband - not a huge eggplant fan- loved it! I drained moisture first, then cutinto rounds, crumbed, fried, placed in baking dish - 1 layer only, topped with pasta sauce then cheese and baked for a while. yummy. I think cut the eggplant about 1cm in thickness, no thicker. Thanks - I'll try load my pic

i agree with "grammy" below completely.  my first time making eggplant parmesan and it was so easy!  it was delicious, too.  my only problem was the breadcrumbs kind of fell off and consequently got charred despite my trying to scoop them out of the pan - that isn't a fault of the recipe as much as user error, haha.  hummy totally loved it so its goes in the keeper box.

Very good and easy.  I peeled my eggplant because the skin did not get soft enough, and I used plain breadcrumbs with italian seasoning.  I will definitely cook again.

This recipe is quick and easy and very good. I didn't have the red pepper flakes, and besides leaving that out and salting the eggplant slices to draw out the moisture, I followed the recipe as written. I served it with a side of pasta and a fresh salad.

I had never had eggplant parmesan. I am staying in the Fisher house at the Veterans hospital with my dad and they were selling eggplant out in front of the hospital. Fisher house has some items in the pantry like cheese,  spaghetti sauce, eggs, hot pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and croutons so I made this dish. I used meunster cheese because that's all I had. This exceeded my expectations. It's the best eggplant dish I have ever had. I added extra hot pepper flakes because I like it like that but omg delicious. My husband and kids don't like eggplant because I usually stir fry it but I was bragging how good this was on the phone to them. When I get home I am making it for them and I know they're gonna love it. 5 stars especially for not having to use the oven.

I made this exactly as described (almost).  I also used the recommendation from others to sweat the eggplant for an hour with a bit of salt.  Quite a bit of moisture came out.  Instead of marinara sauce, I used the last bit of pizza sauce that was in the fridge.  I added a little sugar to it to sweeten it up some.  I was pleased with the texture of the finished product.  The taste was good, too.

Very easy to make and it was light and tasty.  Not to heavy as I find some eggplant recipes. Nice quick dinner with pasta and a salad.

This was very tasty. I had some leftover bread crumbs so I used to cook sliced red pepper the same way. That was really tasty too. Nice easy recipe. Yummy!

I baked the  slices at 375 for about  30 min, turning half way through.  Added cheese the last five minutes.  Used 1/2 C sauce which I added before serving.  Also used Panko crumbs, rather than bread crumbs.  Turned out very crisp & hubs enjoyed every bite!

The only change I made was to cook the eggplant in my electric frypan and then pour the sauce over it, add grated cheese and then turn it to low, put the lid on and let it simmer until the cheese melted. Turned out great.

Im not the best cook  for sure but my family loved this when i made it !!!   I added a couple steps to the orginal reciepe. First I laid the eggplant slice's out and sprinkled salt over them and let them sit for a couple minitues, then used paper towels to soak up the water that the salt pulled out. Then I added flour to the slices after the first batch (bread crumb stuck better) before putting them in the egg batter. I also put them in a browine pan when i added the sauce and broiled them to melt to cheese. Everything came out Faboulous!!

I made these on a night when our Son was home from College and his Dad wanted to order Pizza -- so I made this for our dinner as well. I doubled the recipe because our Son is a big eater.

I also added Onion Powder, Garlic Salt and Black Pepper to the Bread Crumbs. I popped it into the oven for about 10 minutes to melt the cheese and heat it up a little. 

I was AMAZED to see both my Husband and Son getting seconds -- they usually get disappointed when I bring Vegetables to the table!

They next time I made them -- I made both the Eggplant and added some Zucchini (cooked the same way). Hubby did a repeat and ate tons of both. It's a Keeper Recipe :)

Quick and easy.  I heated the sauce in the microwave as directed and then assembled everything in a baking dish and baked at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes to melt the cheeses.

Fast, easy and very good! My only critique is that they were not tender enough all the way through. Our young kids ate the topping and tender parts, but asked for the skin to be removed and left the middle untouched. Pretty good for young picky eaters!

Love this recipe!!!  Although as someone else mentioned,  I use a baking dish and put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom, layer the cooked eggplant and covered with the cheese and sauce and put I under the broiler to melt & brown the cheese.  Delish!

Really easy. Just watch the oil heat and make sure to use enough since the eggplant soaks it up a bit. Bake for a few like others said and its very satisfying.

My whole family ate it up! My only suggestion would be to halve the amount of breadcrumbs (and possibly reduce the mozzarella) you use - I ended up dumping a whole lot of breadcrumbs out after I made this.

While I admire the speediness of this recipe, it just didn't work out well for me. First, the bread crumbs didn't stick well enough to the eggplant slices, making a big mess on my stove. Then, the bread crumbs burn before the eggplant is soft enough to eat.
