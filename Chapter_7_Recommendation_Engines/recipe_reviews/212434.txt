Very good.. I love them because they taste like cookie dough, but they are totally edible!  I didn't, but you may want to add more rice cereael.  If you don't care for the almond taste, it would also be a good idea to cut down on extract.

The recipe was so easy to make.  Make sure you get the real almond extract and non of the imitation stuff...the almond extract makes the squares extra special.  And they taste great!

Great quick recipe. Calls for too much almond extract. I would cut it in half next time.

Very sweet.  I wonder if there's a way to cut the sugar a little bit.  Other than that, it was an easy recipe, and I liked the addition of the peanuts on top.  It gave the recipe a little more interest.

These were nice but not incredible.  I needed to add more cereal to get these to the right consistency & in the end wished I would've added more.  The texture was still almost fudge like.  Tasty though, very easy & super quick to whip up!

I loved this. I substituted vanilla for the almond extract. To me, this was like peanut butter fudge with rice krispies in it, so, YUM. I broke my spatula handle though... suggest a STRONG spoon. I wonder if this started as a fudge recipe but needed the cereal to hold it together. It's really good though!

These were good, although the almond flavor was a little overwhelming. Might need to use less or eliminate it all together.
