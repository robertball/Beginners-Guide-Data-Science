Tasty Turkey Meatloaf with Sauce Haiku: "Licking-lips, this rocked! But what is 'pear applesauce?' I used regular." My only substitutions were half crushed saltines for 1/2 the oats (ran of out oats) and just apple-applesauce (not pear). This WAS a really tasty turkeyloaf, but my only minor complaint was the pieces of sauteed onion in the sauce topping - maybe if they'd have been diced instead of chopped they would've jived better w/ the sauciness of the sauce.

My husband's words, "This is the best meatloaf I have ever had!"...he is 60. If you like a little kick, this is perfect. The recipe doesn't tell you to let it stand for about five minuet

I will definitely make this again. I didn’t have enough Chili powder for the recipe so I substituted with Chili flakes in addition to 1 Tbsp of Chili powder. It was very tasty

Wanted to make something with what I had on hand and this fit the bill. I followed recipe with only change being regular applesauce since that’s what I had. My stepdaughter and I liked this very much - husband ate it and said he liked it but I think the oats put him off. If you are feeding someone who has known food texture issues, take that into consideration. Other than that, the taste was very good and a nice change from bland meatloaf. Will make again!

I made it as written, omitting the salt.  I used Newman's hickory bbq sauce as that's what I had on hand and it is relatively low sodium.  It was delicious!
