Anyone who doesn't rave over this soup must have done something wrong. Our family doesn't usually love soup so I don't make it often but decided to give this a whirl after ordering something similar at a restaurant. I made a few changes. I added cubed red potatoes, diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, onions, baby bella mushrooms, two cloves of garlic, basil and a bay leaf. Topped each bowl with parmesean cheese. It was FANTASTIC!! You can really add just about anything you like to a recipe like this. I also used elbow macaroni because it was all I had on hand. The aroma was so wonderful. My husband wasn't excited when he saw that I was making soup for dinner but he quickly changed his mind after the first bite. He went back for thirds. Even my kids who are picky eaters asked for more. To date this is the absolute BEST recipe I've found on this site and I've tried many!! Thanks for sharing this. I'll make it over and over. Very easy to make too!!

This makes a pretty tasty soup but I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand. Instead of dried onion soup mix I used 1 cup each of chopped fresh onions and celery slowly sauteed over low heat for 10 minutes in 1 T. oil and then added 4 beef bouillon cubes along with the water. I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth a can of diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes and then left out the canned green beans because I didn't have any. I also added a cup of chopped cabbage to add some more fiber to the soup. I reduced the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in the meatballs to 1/2 cup each (otherwise the meatballs would be all filler) and added 1/2 tasp. of Italian seasoning. I thought it needed more seasoning when it was done so I added some dried basil and oregano to it. I also added extra beef broth to balance out the extra veggies I put in. This is a good hearty basic recipe that you can adjust depending on the veggies broth and seasoning you have on hand.

When I was a child my Grandmother used to make "meatball soup." I have asked her numerous times for the recipe but she could never tell me because it was a "kitchen sink" soup. Well this soup tasted just like I remember it! I thought it needed more broth so I added 2 more cups of water to it. I also added 2 cups of celery. This made for a lot of veggies! Also 1 lb of meat may be a lot. I should have made the meatballs a bit smaller but I ended up with about 60 meatballs the size I made them. (I also added garlic powder to them) My meatballs came out a bit dry so next time I will add an extra egg. Only other thing is this makes a lot of soup so get ready to freeze batches. Thank you Judy Henry this is going into my recipe box and will be made every winter!!!

Awfully darn tasty. I did not use as much liquid as called for and added fresh parsley bay leaves and more pepper and salt in meatballs. Even hubby and kids liked that in itself is a miracle!!

I used premade frozen meatballs for this recipe and medium pasta shells instead of the alphabet pasta. Wow was this ever so good! Everyone ate it up and I got lots of compliments and asked to make it again for the weekend! LOL

This recipe was great! Here's what I did a bit different. Only used 16oz bag of frozen veggies and used orzo pasta because that's what I had on hand. The bread crumbs were Italian breadcrumbs and I added about 1tsp Kosher salt and 2tsp of adobo (you could sub Lawry's or poultry season) and 3 eggs total but that was to 2.25lbs of ground beef. It was a perfect ratio of vegetables to pasta to broth meatballs. I added just under 60 meatballs to the soup and froze the rest.The last change was adding a small can of tomato sauce. The recipe for me made about 9 servings and of course I have about 100 mini meatballs for another use! I think if I hadn't added the additional seasoning to the meatballs they would have been a bit bland. Excellent soup!

Since I'm on a low carb lifestyle I didn't try however my husband and 3 children (world's pickiest eaters) were very positive about it. I used canned vegetables (corn baby carrots Leisure peas green beans) instead of frozen since they prefer this type of vegetable and it came out great. I served it with cheese bread. Very good meal

We used sea shell pasta instead of alphabet. Minor adjustments really. But this was really great. My wife ate it about 4 different times for leftovers.

This was easy and delicious!!!! Based on the suggestions by other reviewers here are the changes I made: I only used 2lb of frozen mixed vegetables. No others. I used rotel diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. I added 1 can of v-8 juice 1 tbp. basil 2 bay leaves 2 cloves of minced garlic. I used 1.5 lbs of frozen meatballs (about 45) instead of making them. I used 2 cups of uncooked wheel pasta instead of 1 cup of alphabet. This made the EASIEST prep and my family rated it as one of their favorites. We forgot to top it with parmesan and it was still delicious. We had it with sourdough bread too. YUM!!! We will be making it again for sure!

Very good soup I used shredded cabbage added 2 crushed fresh tomatoes add some celery and green pepper (instead of mixed veggies) and instead of the pasta I used 1/2 cup uncooked rice. It tasted really good. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't change anything and thought this recipe was OK. I think next time I will add less vege's but throw in some celery and add V8 to the broth for flavor. It is very thick more like a stew.

My ENTIRE family loved this which is a rare thing for everyone to like the same thing! It was great!! Things I did different in meatballs: I used 2 LBS hamburger 2 pks pork stove top stuffing instead of bread crumbs 4 eggs 1/2 cup of water. Soup: I did everything it asked for besides dry onion soup mix frozen mixed vegs. Instead I added canned corn canned chopped chilies chopped onion.

We loved this soup though we used home made stock and fresh veggies. A quick and easy way to make a lot of meatballs quickly is to pat the ground beef into a 1" thick square and then cut that into 1" cubes. They remain square when boiled in the soup which looks kind of neat but if you cook them in the oven they shrink up into balls.

This recipe was a plesant suprise: I followed the recipe fairly strictly only using slightly different veggies (just what I had in my freezer and cupboard). The meat I used was ground sirloin because that's what I had. And I put a little italian seasoning in the balls. I sent some to my mom to put in dad's lunch and she called and asked for the recipe. Boyfriend and I liked it too.

We loved this soup so much. I did have to substitue 2 bags of frozen mixed vegies as I was out of the other vegies and that worked out great because there was no chopping involved. I was also out of french onion soup mix so I had to substitute a dry onion soup mix I found on this site by faye522 and we ended up loving the flavor of the homemade one. The meatballs have an incredible taste I wouldn't change a thing about them. We serve this soup with parmesan and italian bread. Delish!

I LOVE this soup! I make a few changes though to suit my taste and to simplify the recipe even further - I don't bother chopping carrots or using the canned beans because my favorite frozen vegie mix already has lima beans green beans carrots and corn in it. I just use 2 bags of that and one can of tomatoes. (Diced fire-roasted is what I usually have on hand). I use tiny shells instead of alphabet pasta and I add a couple of teaspoons of red pepper flakes and a couple of dashes of Magy. For the meatballs I substitute ground turkey for beef and I use seasoned bread crumbs. It is a bit time-consuming to make the bite-size meatballs so if you're feeling impatient you can make them bigger. Or if you like to cook with your kids - they might like rolling the meatballs - mine do. This is so good nutritious low fat and easy I made it every few weeks. I highly recommend this recipe as a family staple.

This was great! I didn't have any onion soup mix so I followed the advise of another review and finely chopped some onion and garlic and sauteed it in a little olive oil. I was using what I had available so I used a couple of chicken bullion cups and ended up using a total of 6 cups water. I only had carrots so that was the only veggies we had and some tomato juice but just a little. I added dried basil and oregano (about a 1/4 tsp eyeballed it). Hubby loved it! I served it with grilled cheese sandwiches. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was so good! I used shells instead of alphabet noodles and provolone instead of the Parmesan cheese. My fiance said the texture of the meatballs was wonderful! I added some paprika and garlic powder for extra zing. I love that you can add so many different ingredients to this soup and it will still be really good. Thanks! Will make again soon.

My hubby was craving something like this so we tried this recipe. It turned out well. We all liked it. Even my 2 yr old that's on a healthy food strike.:) It makes 8 BIG servings! I used 1/2 sausage & 1/2 grnd turkey for the meatballs. Instead of adding the meatballs to the soup to cook which I knew would make the soup really greasy I broiled them patted them with paper towels to absorb more of the grease and then put them in once the main soup was ready. It really turned out yummy.

YUMMY! So easy too. I added chopped celery and omitted the pasta all together because I was out and used frozen meatballs. And it still turned out to be very filling. Goes well with some sweet corn bread. Oh yea I also threw in 2 bay leaves and some italian seasoning. I thought that the herbs might of clashed with the onion soup mix but it actually enhanced it. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Before I give this recipe my opinionated shake I have to admit I changed it a bit. First I used ground turkey for the meatballs instead of beef. I added some pepper flakes to them too. I did the same soup base but I didn't have any frozen mixed vegetables so instead I used frozen peas and corn. In addition I used a little fresh onion celery and added some coleslaw mix that needed using. I skipped the pasta all together. This was good the flavor of carrots was prominent but that didn't bother my family in the least. We served it with a pinch of parm on top. My boys ate 2 huge bowls of it.

Soooo good! I'm a 21-year-old college student and it was super easy to make not to mention super yum. I used italian sausage onions and cilantro and skipped the frozen veggies (I had none!). I also used 4 cups beef broth instead of water and chicken broth and 2 cans tomatoes italian stewed and chopped. I have lots of leftovers and I def will make this again! Thanks Siri

I tried this last night and I made a few changes: left out the pasta used 24 oz of already cooked meatballs added 2 stalks of celery (chopped) added 3 cups chopped potatoes added 1 T dried parsley 2 bay leaves and 1/2 tsp. of black pepper added 1 can (8 oz) of tomato sauce used a 20 oz pkg. of mixed vegetables and omitted the can of green beans and also added 1 extra cup of water. I served this with "Quick and Easy Cheese Bread" from this site. Everyone (except me) enjoyed the soup. Don't know right now if I'll be making this dish again though.

This was really a very good soup. Only thing I didn't like about it and what is keeping me from the 5th star was the grease from cooking the meatballs in the prepared soup. Next time I will brown them on the side and add them to the soup to dispense the grease. BUT! my sons and husband really enjoyed it...good meal for my twin toddlers. If others are interested: I added a cup of V-8 juice to the soup and also added 1 teaspoon yellow mustard as well as two teaspoons of brown sugar to the meatball mixture. Next time I will add diced potatoes instead of the pasta.

Really tasty. I would call it meatball stew though because there was not a lot of liquid. Also use a really big pot. The recipe barely fit in the biggest pot I have.

Made this today and it was great! Read reviews and added what vegetables I had on hand - corn green beans celery green peppers peas (you really can't mess that part up). Added some red wine too. Because of the grease factor from other reviews I used 1/2 ground turkey and ground beef - I also added italian spices. My 13 year old son said it was good and that his friends would like it too with the meatballs! Might try cheese tortellini next time instead of plain pasta...

This was a really good and filling soup. I will make a couple of changes next time I make it. I will omit the tomatoes and the stock and just add more water since I used chicken soup pkt instead of onion there was plenty of flavour. I will also use less parmesan. Other than that the soup is really good as is and even better the next day when the flavours have had time to blend.

Good stuff - had to use orzo pasta instead of the alphabet (couldn't find) but Mr. Meat & Potatoes (husband) loved it and has devoured the leftovers - my house smelled of onion soup mix for a couple of days though!

This was great! It also made a lot! I had an extra half pound of hamburger and thought I'd put it in and there were almost too many meatballs for the soup. I did not add pasta but did stir in some quick cooking barley. Will make again and will try to freeze.

Everyone I shared with (because it did make a lot) thought it was great! I found the alphabet pasta in the ethnic Mexican section of the grocery store. The alpahbet pasta stated on the package it is a product of Mexico. I really liked the taste of the pasta.

Soup is wonderful because recipes are so much more of an idea than requirement. This recipe is a great example of that. I didn't use the onion soup I added carrots chopped spinach and corn. I added the can of tomatoes which I think make a real difference. My meatballs were both pork and beef and I flavoured them with herbs akin to pork stuffing. The end effect was so delicious my daughter ate two bowls. BIG bowls.

I used frozen vegatables pre-made frozen meatballs no pasta and more spices than originally called for but the soup tastes good. We will see what the family says in a little while.

Made with frozen veggies and used fresh shredded parm for the meatballs. Left out the pasta. Didn't need it. This soup is thick and hearty! Loved it!

Very good soup! I made the meatballs as directed doubling it so I would have extra meatballs for another time. I baked them in the oven to minimize the grease in the soup and they were delicious. For the soup I used the broth and seasonings as called for only changing a few of the veggies to suit our preference. I pretty much followed the recipe though and it was a hit with everyone. Seriously yummy soup and one I will make again. Thank you!

This lives up to the recipe name but we found the meatballs missing a bit of flavor. Made tons of soup so make sure you have containers for freezing. A great way of getting in all your vegetables.

This is one of my family's favorite meals. My son's comment is always "Oh I love this soup!!" My daughter likes to stuff bread sticks with it. It is excellent as leftovers as well. I really love how you don't have to pre-cook the meatballs...just drop them in. I use the tiny pasta balls used in traditional wedding soup in place of the pasta shells.

I loved this soup. I used frozen meatballs and left over green beans from a bbq instead of canned. The flavor is great! I will definitely make this one again.

YUM! I subbed beef broth for chicken and also added some V8 for flavor (an old soup trick my MIL taught me) and used pasta I had on hand. I took off one star because I found the soup needed a lot more liquid than called for - I kept adding water as it cooked. This one's a keeper!

This was really good soup. I was in a hurry after working all day and then going to the grocery store. I wanted a meatball soup and found this recipe. I had frozen premade meatballs. Only needed 1/2 the broth and left out the green beans. I added mixed vegetables with lots of carrots. Used a bowtie pasta that appealed to my toddler. It came out so good my husband and my toddler daughter loved it! I will do this again. Maybe next time I will do the meatballs myself. But I got to say with the frozen meatballs start to finish a half hour! Wonderful.

This was good and something I will make again. Very hearty. However there is no way to form meatballs out of that combination - either you need 2 eggs (which is what I did) or you need to cut both the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese in half. I'll probably add some spices to the meatballs next time e.g. onion garlic powder oregano worcestershire. All the packages of mixed veggies that I had on hand already included carrots and green beans so I used frozen peas and frozen corn to make the specified amount of veggies. I made the specified amount of pasta but felt it needed a bit more but that's my personal taste. Overall excellent and easy to tweak. Thanks for sharing this!!

Absolutely wonderful! My husband is not a huge vegetable fan but he ate this great soup even though it truns out chock full of veggies. My daughter (1 1/2) was crazy about it. I made it just as the instructions said but if you want more of a soup texture add some more liquid. I liked the way it turned out thick and very hearty. Can't wait to make it again.

I made this last week and am still having leftovers! Wonderful with some french bread. I substituted sausage meat for the ground beef as that's all I had. still totally delish. I added canned corn amongst other veggies just to clear out my pantry a little; it was soo delicious but I almost needed a larger pot as I was bordering on overflowing my big soup pot! Take into consideration what fresh vs canned veggies you may be adding to the soup. The canned stuff should be added more towards the end of cooking because they're already quite soft and done. Everything that I put in that was fresh was put in towards the beginning to give it more cook time.

I made a lot of changes to the soup but the base is a good start. The meatballs I made exactly the same. The thing is with the soup you can add whatever you like. I made the chicken broth from scratch I added celery fresh parsley onions and later I added some pre cooked brown rice instead of pasta. I added a can of tomatoes to the broth added the meatballs and left it in the slow cooker for a good 4 to 5 hours. i added some oregano thyme and garlic it made a wonderful soup thanks for the soup building blocks..

This made for a great meal and great leftovers too. This soup doesn't have a lot of broth when it's done so you might want to add another can. Personally I like a lot of broth but my husband and son don't so it was perfect for them. I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used a can of tomato soup and added a can of water and about 2/3 cup of salsa. I also put a few shakes of red pepper. I used about 45 frozen meatballs instead of making them.
