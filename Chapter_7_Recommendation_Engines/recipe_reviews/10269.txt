After making the dough instead of using a cookie press or dropping by balls, I rolled the dough into four logs, wrapped the logs in waxed paper, placed in the fridge to harden, and then sliced in about 1/2" slices. Perfect and delicious. Sometimes I make the dough up to 3 days ahead of time then slice and bake when I need them. After baked I sprinkle with powder sugar. Makes a beauiful presentation.

Excellent shortbread ccokies!! But be prepared when making these, the recipe says it makes 2 dozen and that's WAY off unless you're using some super **huge** cookie press! I get at least 6 dozen cookies out of one batch every time I make them!

This recipe was very easy and came out very good.  But I think the proportions are wrong, I halved the recipe and still made at least 2 dozen.  I also didn't have a cookie press, so I just rolled the dough into little balls, then flattened them on the cookie sheet.  Next time I plan on dipping them in melted chocolate... mmmm..

Wonderful shortbread cookie! These were so easy to make and yet turned out fabulous. It's great when such simple ingredients come together to create something so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough chill in the fridge for a half hour before rolling it out and using cookie cutters vs. a cookie press. I baked the cookies on parchment paper and they were perfectly done in ten minutes. These have a wonderful butter flavor and are great for decorating. When I was all done I placed them in clear cellophane bags tied with ribbon - too cute!

I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I don't have is a cookie press. I'm a very experienced baker and never had cookie dough go this wrong on me! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn't even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface.   I'm sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn't want it to go to waste. We'll see how they bake!  Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It's also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.

This is the first time I've actually bothered to log in and write a review. Oh man, these cookies are good. Yes, you should add a little confectioner's sugar to improve the taste and add to the "melt in your mouth" factor, as well as some brown sugar for moisture (I added 1/8 of each, 1/4 total). I also cut down on the flour. Thanks to the other reviewers, those few tweaks resulted in a blissful butter-sugar shortbread like cookie that can stand on its own. Normally my favorite cookies have chocolate involved, but honestly, these are so delicious I don't even miss it. (Hint - because this recipe is so simple, the quality of ingredients has to be good or it will ruin the flavor. I'd bet the majority of people who had issues with this recipe didn't use unsalted real butter, sifted flour, or real vanilla extract). Seriously, if you're having a cookie craving, give these a try. YUM!!

They really do melt in your mouth.  I was surprised that so few ingredients made such a tasty little cookie. This was my first try with a cookie press and this recipe worked wonderfully, even though the directions that came with the press said to use only their recipe.

Note: I see a lot of "it's tastes too much like flour/biscuits" reviews, mostly from those of us without a cookies press that end up rolling them out. This should help:

Instead of rolling your dough out on a floured surface, which puts more flour than needed into the dough, simply place the dough between waxed paper. This not only eliminates the excess flour, it also makes the dough easier to work with since it doesn't stick to anything.

I used this method, rolled mine out to about 1/4 inch thickness, and they turned out perfectly! 

I also think that some of the reviewers are confusing these with Sugar Cookies, which are much sweeter, since I saw a lot of "these are so bland" reviews. Shortbread cookies are not meant to be super-sweet, they are meant to be subtle, and in my opinion, this recipe nailed it!

These cookies melt in your mouth and taste as good or better than any other
shortbread recipe I have used, but only used 4 ingredients. They were so easy
and cheap to make, I am definately saving the recipe. Although they taste 
good plain, I added coconut to a second batch and was very pleased with the
result!

Tastes like butter, but I assume that's the way shortbread is suppose to taste; good thing we used AA grade, sweet cream, unsalted butter. Ran an experiment and made four batches of cookies using the ingredient ratios outlined in this recipe: two with vanilla extract, two with almond extract, two with salt (ratio of 1 tsp. per 2 cups butter), and two without salt. Our favorite was the unsalted vanilla as written in the original recipe. Next favorite was the unsalted almond. The salted vanilla tasted gross after being stored for a day. Also, as part of the experiment, I refrigerated two batches of shaped dough before putting them straight into the oven and left two batches at room temperature before placing them in the oven to see if it would affect oven spread. It didn't affect spread given that both cookies grew to more than twice their original size width-wise. [I did, however, refrigerate all the dough before shaping them into thin sticks to make it easy.] Lastly, these cookies were still crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth chewy on the inside when stored in an airtight container for two days (except the salted vanilla that developed a terrible flavor).

This is exactly what I was looking for-- a classic shortbread recipe (1 part sugar, 2 parts butter, 3 parts flour). They turned out wonderful! I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly. I ended up with 3 dozen small cookies-- one batch plain, the other two with sprinkles. (Put the sprinkles on before baking so they stick!) I'm not sure what went wrong for the negative reviewers, but my cookies tasted great, even right out of the oven-- not at all crumbly or sand-like as some claimed. I don't have a cookie press, so I rolled the dough into 3 logs and froze for 30 min so I could slice 1/4" cookies (if you do this make sure to use a sharp cutting knife, a butter knife won't work). Bottom line: These were the perfect and simple shortbread cookies I wanted. Will definitely use again!

I just spread the dough out in a cookie sheet and cut into squares.  Saves me a lot of time and I can still decorate them if I want.  This is the same exact recipe that I've been using for years and years. Foolproof! I grab them out of the oven as soon as they start to turn a LIGHT brown. Otherwise they have that sort of "burnt" taste to them.

Made these with Stork baking margarine as that's what I had in when we needed a sugary treat. The recipe was simple and we made 16 biscuits even tho we halved it. I've given this four stars as I found I needed to add some more flour so that this could be rolled out (gently) and shaped with biscuit cutters. I found that at 170 degrees C on our fan oven on a silicon mat in the baking tray for 10 mins, these came out perfect and unbrowned as shortbread is supposed to be. As others have said, don't move this until they have cooled down a bit. The silicon sheet helped with this.

Good recipe. I read all the low rated reviews and here is my suggestion to those of you that struggled with this recipe. I made half of the original recipe and it was more than enough dough for 2 dozen cookies by itself.

1 ingredient that is missing: pinch of salt

Advice: When creaming your sugar and butter, make sure you do it for at least 5 minutes to make the butter nice and fluffy. I recommend scraping the bowl down and doing for a few more minutes as well. When rolling dough, USE FLOUR! It's no different than any other dough. Flour your board and flour your rolling pin.

Enjoy!

I'v never been a fan of shortbread cookies but my husband/child/friends say they were really good and would rate this recipe 5 stars. With some of the cookies I made a well in the center and added some strawberry preserves. Those were the first to go.

These cookies are fantastic. Not only does everyone always have these four ingredients on hand, but they couldn't be easier to make and always turn out so well! I prepare these exactly as the recipe lists and take them out when the edges are golden and they're always perfect, regardless of the thickness or size. I first made these as little drop cookies to give as part of a Christmas gift. The receiver begged me to make more because her family wouldn't stop eating them. I recently did them rolled out and cut into mini hearts and drizzled with milk and white chocolate as part of the favor for my best friend's bridal shower. I had to make over 200 little cookies and every single one looked great. Everyone raved about them and thought they were made at a bakery. My own family, who always gets the extras, can't stop eating them and while I really enjoy baking, I'm not a big sweets person and even I love them. Only thing I'll reiterate that otthers have said is that these definitely make a lot more than listed, unless your cookies are really big. No complaints there, though!

If I could give this recipe 0 stars, I would.  These were definitely NOT melt-in-your-mouth shortbreads. They are extremely flour-y tasting, with a texture of 2week old biscuit/raw butter. Dipped half in chocolate fudge, but still couldn't get over the plain, bad taste.  After a night in the cookie jar, they were almost rock hard.  And even for shortbread, they were just bland. Like compacted butter and flour.  Was wary about not using confectioner's sugar in shortbread, however, I had none on hand and this was one of the few recipes found without the powder. Next time, I will just follow instinct and buy it instead of making inedible snacks. Now I just can't get over all the butter wasted :(

If you like shortbread, this recipe is it!.  I've been looking forever.  Wonderful.  They are crisp, yet soft in the middle.  

Next time what I will do differently is, make the cookies bigger.  I just rolled them out and cut them in strips for dipping, but I will make the sticks a bit larger, and dip oneside in chocolate.    I did find that sprinkling a little white surgar on top made them a bit more tasty.

Great cookie.  They definatley could be used at Christmas, cut into shapes with decorations.  Very easy...

I just made these last night, and OMG!! They were so good. I read on a few of the reviews that they can end up crumbly, so I edited it a bit. I added a tablespoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of lemon juice. They turned out perfect. Not too sweet, with a nice lemony taste for spring :)

I also didn't have a cookie press, nor do I know what that is LOL but I just rolled the dough into balls and flattened them on the cookie sheet. I also used butter to grease the sheet, and I think that added a little more flavor too :)

I didn't really care for these. They did not taste good at all. It was lacking something... maybe some more sugar I dunno. All I know is that it was crumbly and it tasted like flour. I won't be making these again. :\

I wasted a lot of flour and butter and the better part of an afternoon with my cookie press on these cookies. All you could taste was flour. My husband tried to cheer me up by saying "they might be edible if we frost them." I didn't want to waste the frosting. The ratings on this website are usually accurate but I don't know how this one is scoring so high. They were not good at all.

These are so easy! The ingredients are really basic, but the cookies come out really great. Crunchy on the outside, but then they melt in your mouth. The dough was too soft and sticky to roll out, and I don't own a cookie press, so I just rolled them into balls in my hands and flattened them using a fork to form a criss-cross design.

Great!
They came out exactly like shortbread, the traditional Scottish type.  A little sweet and a little salty everyone in the office enjoyed them and the best thing is I could find all those ingredients here in outback China!

LOVE THIS RECIPE. However I made a few alterations and it came out even better than the original recipe. I added one egg for moisture, and non salted butter, I found that the salted butter really adds dryness.  Also to add flavor I add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond flavoring, and an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. To get a nice golden crisp outside and a tender center that just melts in your mouth I cooked the cookies at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. I used about a spoonful of dough for each cookie. I do not own a cookie press so I freezed the dough for about a day, then let it thaw out and put the cookies on a NONGREASED cookie sheet.  NO GREASE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! These were so amazing,  they just absolutely melted in your mouth, you can't have just one!

I am English and have been eating shortbread cookies all my life and without doubt this was the finest.  Cannot wait to make another batch because I made some real rookie mistakes on this batch.  I made some thick and some thinner (the thin ones were super super delicious... so crisp and melt in the mouth) but mixed them up on the same baking tray so the thin ones were cooked while the thick ones were not quite ready.  Second mistake I tried to move them to the cooling rack too soon and the shape got messy.  They really need about 5 mins on the baking tray before they are ready to be moved.   On the second tray I made thumb cookies with lemon curd.... again it was lovely but I made the indentation too deep and when the curd melted it cooked almost through the dough.  A centimeter more and there would have been a hole.  The last batch were sprinkled with Heath bar bits but the cookie itself was so buttery and vanillary that the bits were lost in the mouth.  I piped peppermint candy on top of some and that flavor was so distinctly different it worked much better.   Just one more tip.... you have to work quickly with this dough or put it back in the fridge for a while.   Honestly cant imagine being bothered making any other type of cookie ever again even though the thin ones were rather fragile and meant careful packing when I put them away.   Might make the lemon flavored ones next time too.... so yummy!!

Good shortbread recipe.  Delicate enough to melt in your mouth, but has enough substance to stay together and not crumble. I would give 5 stars but felt it may have tasted to salty - I should have used unsalted butter. I love shortbread cookies because there are so many variations you can try - maraschino cherries, strawberry jam (like Pepperidge Farm cookies), dip in melted chocolate, powder with confectioner sugar, fresh sliced strawberry on top, drizzle with caramel and pecans, etc.

NO! I tried this for my bake sale! I was very surprised when the recipe did NOT include any eggs! My mom said, Well, you gotta do what the recipe says! I tried it and did not care for it! All it did was burn the bottom of the cookie! I do NOT reccomend this cookie to anybody.

I have been making this recipe sibce 1965, and have always kneaded the dough until it begins to look greasy.  If you bypass this step, all you have is crumbly dough!

I will keep searching for an alternative shortbread recipe. I followed the recipe to the T. It was hard to cut out with cookie cutters because the mixture kept crumbling.  Tasted good in the end, but not exactly what I had hoped after reading all the rave reviews.

I've finally found the best recipe for a shortbread cookie. These cookies are crunchy, melt in your mouth and have a delicious butter cookie taste. Gonna bake it often. Didn't have a cookie press, so I rolled dough in walnut sized ball that I flattened on cookie sheets with the tip of my fingers.

Easy, quick, and yummy! I didn't pay attention and just dumped all the ingredients in the bowl and mixed and they still turned out great. I didnt' use a cookie press...I balled some, flattened some, and made shapes of others. I experimented by adding different things around the house to each cookie like chocolate chips,sprinkles, butterscotch chips, nuts, jam, even chopped dates. All were fabulous! Get creative!

Yum. Simple, delicious, decadent. Don't wait until the tops get brown though, the bottoms are brown way before then. 12 minutes is perfect in my oven. And I don't own no fancy cookie press, just made them round with my hands and squashed em...delicious nonetheless!

I have a very similar recipe that I make every year, so if you don't have a cookie press, here is what you do - use the recipe above (my recipe doesn't include vanilla and I don't miss it, either). Instead of putting in a cookie press, make 2 'logs' out of the dough, and roll the logs in colored sparkling sugar. Wrap in plastic wrap & refrigerate until firm - a couple of hours, or overnight. Then slice the dough into cookies about 1/4 inch thick & bake @ 325 for about 20 min. Since ovens vary, just watch the cookies & make sure they don't get too brown - they are better when nice and light-colored.

these cookies are not for rolling.  i thought i could roll them but i just became frustrated after trying.  i don't have a cookie press so i decided to roll the dough in balls.  i then pressed the dough and left an indention for my strawberry preserves, baked them at least 15 minutes and they came out wonderfully delicious.  they are really very soft.  maybe i should bake them more to form a little crisp at the edges.  5 stars for the simplicity!

I made a 1/4 batch of this recipe (I was low on ingredients and needed a cookie fix!), and replaced about 3-4 T of the flour with cocoa powder. I then rolled them by hand and dipped them in a bit of castor sugar before baking. They turned out splendidly. A new favorite!

I wish the recipe had been more specific on how to cool and store the cookies. I say the cookies have a nice flavor out of the oven but a bit floury the next day but still good. I used the food processor and am grateful for that because the dough is very dry a crumbly it made mixing nice and easy. I am on a shortbread mission and this recipe hasnt haulted my search good yes but not "THE ONE"

Very easy to make and delicious!  Lives up to its description of being melt-in-your-mouth good!  One tip-I made big cookies and found that I needed to leave them on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before removing them with a spatula to a cooling rack or they would crumble.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Well, I would have loved to make these as press cookies, but they didn't work with a WILLIAMS-SONOMA press, so I don't think they'll do you much good in that dept. I made them as cut-outs (the THICKER the better unlike most cutouts) I found them needing some "mmph" so this is what I did: Melted 1 1/2 bags of chocolate chips in a small pan and dipped each cookie half way. Put on wax paper in fridge to harden. FANTASTIC!!!!!! Very FILLING treat :-)

Missing some salt - I added 1/2 teaspoon and added the zest of one lime.  Dipped in chocolate (dark and white) and decorated with gold and pearl dust along with christmas colored sugars!  Pretty cookie and quite fragile!

I made two batches at Christmas with excellent results.  I used my Super Shooter for one batch and prefer this recipe to any others for my spritz cookies.  The batch that I rolled out were quite delicate but once they were baked and frosted, they held up well.  Very tasty results. I will continue to make these cookies.

I followed this recipe and the cookies turned out marvelous and melts in your mouth. It was hard to get them into a shape as I don't have a cookie press...but none the less turned out wonderful!

Awesome cookies!!!  Easy and fast to make. Instead of omiting the vanilla and adding the almond extract, as some of the reviews suggested; I used both the vanilla and the almond extract!  Oh, and by the way, I didn't use a cookie press, I made small balls of dough and used a glass cup to flatten them... since some reviews said that this recipe yields about 3 dz cookies and I didn't want that many,  I cut the ingredients in half...  I have to say that perhaps the cookie press uses a very small amonut of dough and perhaps that's why they get so many cookies, I got 15 cookies out of this dough, so I think the measurements are correct...  My cookies were not too small or too big.  They were Yummy! Hope this helps!  =)

I appreciate a good shortbread, although I would hardly call myself a shortbread lover.  This is a very good recipe, very melt in your mouth type shortbread, which in my opinion is what makes shortbread good!  I have neither a cookie press, or a rolling pin, so I rolled them into balls on the cookie sheet and pressed them down with a water glass with a floured bottom, people asked me how I got them so nicely shaped :) For variety I dipped some of them half way in chocolate, which were also a huge success (1 cup semi-sweet chips in microwave for 1 minute, dip, set on waxed paper to cool) every one enjoyed them.  They said there were the "black and white cookies from Sienfeld" I obviously missed that episode, but as long as they were enjoyed it worked for me.

These cookies are good, but not quite what I was looking for.  I was hoping for a recipe more like the Girl Scout cookies.  They are my favorite!  Although this is the best shortbread cookie recipe I have found this far.  My little sister came over just after I took these out of the oven and took nearly the whole batch home with her!  She couldnt stop eating them and saying how wonderfull they were while she was at my house.

I just got done making these cookies and this recipe is by far the easiest and tastiest of any others that I have tried for my cookie press. The dough is a little hard to mix together but I used my hands to mix the dough until it came together and it worked out fine. When the cookies are baked second rack up in my oven for 11 minutes, I removed them off the cookie sheet to a rack to cool. The only thing I did was use 1 Tsp. of lemon extract and 1 tsp. of vanilla. My family all love lemon flavoring. I would give this recipe 10 or more points if I could Pat H.

The easiest cookies I have ever made! My entire family loves these. I have 7 children with vary different tastes but they gobbled these up! Makes a ton of cookies... I rolled the dough up into logs and refrigerated them until firm then sliced them into cookies. Love this recipe!

LOVED IT!!!  First time I got to use my cookie press.  I halfed the recipe and it made a little over 7 dozen cookies.  Had no problem with the dough in the cookie press and they taste just like good shortbread cookies.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!!!

Very good!!  Really easy to make, used a kitchen aid mixer and they turned out perfect.  I didn't use a cookie press, instead I rolled into balls and just pressed them down before baking.  I also refridgerated some of the batter because I didn't have time to make them all, and they seemed to turn out better refridgerated.

I'm in the habit now of using margarine for all my baking, because my boyfriend has a dairy allergy...but that turned out to be a big mistake with these! LOL. This was my first time baking shortbread. Tomorrow I'm going to attempt these again with REAL butter, and hopefully change my rating:) UPDATE: These still didn't taste like shortbread...more like pizza dough. After comparing them to other, traditional shortbread recipes I noticed a difference in the ingredients. Every other recipe seems to have confectioners sugar (not white sugar), and cornstarch in place of flour. I won't be trying this recipe again.

Simple and classic.  You may want to add a bit of milk as needed to make putting though your cookie press easier.  Good workout for the arms and hands though!

These were great!  I made some plain, and then I made another batch with a twist.  I topped the cookies with seedless raspberry preserves, and then froze them.  While they were in the freezer, I melted dark chocolate in a double boiler.  I then removed the cookies from the freezer and dipped them in the melted chocolate.  I set the cookies on wax paper and placed in the refrigerator for the chocolate to harden.  They were a hit!

The biscuits were way to flowery plus they were way to hard to use cookie cutyters with because they kept crumbling. the after taste is fowl.

I make this recipe a few times a year, definitely every Christmas and they always turn out amazing! I do not have a cookie press and simply use cookie cutters without any issue. I sometimes roll the end of the dough into a log and slice off circular cookies. They don't have that weird starchy taste on your tongue that other shortbread cookies have. They aren't too sweet... just right! I love them decorated with icing sugar mixed with a bit of spiced rum, sprinkled with nutmeg. Amazing!!

I rolled these into a log and froze it then cut it into slices about the size I needed and rolled it just a little In between plastic wrap then used cookie cutter to get the shape I wanted flipped it onto a cookie sheet baked them up and got great reviews from everyone who tried them. They were wonderful, ii just need to remember not to use salted butter next time! But even with the salted butter ppl loved them. So excited by recipe.. Thank you for sharing!

Followed the recipe to the letter.  Ok, well I halved it but otherwise I followed it to the letter.   I used a cookie press and didn't have the need to refrigerate the dough before I started making they cookies.  The were excellent; just what shortbread should be.

This was excellent shortbread! Instead of cookies press (which I will also use) I put dough in fridge for a few minutes and then rolled out the dought to a wanted thickness and cut with biscuit cutter. I also added peanut butter and chocolate chips!  SOOOOO yummmy.

Good recipe. Makes much more than 2 dozen cookies. After mixing, I thought it looked sort of 'wet' (melting butter?) so I covered the metal bowl with plastic wrap and placed it back in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Took it out, rolled it and used medium sized cookie cutters. Placed these on parchment lined sheets and baked as instructed.

Maybe we're just not shortbread fans, but my family found these cookies to be very bland.  If I were to make these again, I would probably add more extract, dip them in chocolate, or ice them to add more flavor.

Made exactly to recipe but scaled down to 3 servings, 1/4 of the recipe because I am trying several to see what will work best for a special occasion.  The taste of these cookies is excellent, a very nice traditional shortbread.  My less than 5 rating is due to the inflexibility, that is if rolled even a bit to thin they tended to break, I tried stamping them but unless refrigerated after they were stamped and thus baked from a very cold state the image would not hold. I then added a bit, maybe a tablespoon more flour but then the dough was too flaky to roll and do cut outs,  so I shaped it into a flat disk and baked it that way resulting in a disk that was tender on the inside with a perfectly firmer almost crisp edge.  (you could bake yours a bit longer for a firmer shortbread but I like mine this way).  Bottom line- I will use this recipe again for a pan of shortbread but stick to a sugar cookie recipe for cut out and or pressed cookies.

So easy with four ingredients! They turned out awesome from my cookie press. I used almond extract and they were lightly almond and butter flavored. I will be using this recipe again.

At 12 servings, it made almost 10 dozen 2 inch cookies.  But very light airy melt in your mouth taste - this will be my go to cookie press recipe.

i don't know what it is, but every time I make shortbread it is all crumbly... I did reduce the recipe b/c we didn't need a bunch.  I did also reduce the flour.  But could I still be putting too much flour somehow?  Regardless the taste was ok just crumbly.  At times like this I wish this site was more interactive so someone could tell me what I did wrong!

Much too doughy. My boys didn't even want to eat them and they will eat just about anything. The sad thing is that I followed the recipe to the letter.

fantastic recipe.  I made them gluten free, and I can't get enough of them.  I used 1tbsp vanilla and 1tbsp of lemon juice to make them lemony.  SO GOOD!!

Just takes a few ingredients and a few minutes to get a great little cookie! The only change I made was using Splenda instead of sugar. I frosted with red decorator icing and sprinkles. Great recipe! I will make these again! Thanks!

Great! I sprinkled powdered sugar on top after they had cooled. Hubby and I loved them! I made a batch of 3 servings, which still made about 20 cookies!

I'm certainly no shortbread connoisseur, but these weren't my favorite and there were MANY left on the cookie tray after a house full of people on Christmas day. Baking 9 minutes was perfect. I will likely not make these again, but I'm not convinced there's anything wrong with the recipe. It may be a case of no shortbread fans in our group.

These were simply phenomenal!  I halved recipe and ended up with close to 40 cookies - some I left plain, some I dipped half in chocolate, and the remaining (as suggested) I simply rolled into balls, made thumbprints, filled with boysenberry jam.  Husband devoured.  Only change was to add about 1/3rd of a mixed egg for added moisture as my mix was just a tad dry.  Pressed cookies cooked in exactly 10 minutes;  rolled took a bit longer - I'd guess around 15 to 18 minutes.  Be sure to use a cold ungreased metal cookie sheet so patterns from press grab and adhere to sheet.  This has already become a family favorite.

Easy, tasty, versatile.  I rolled mine and cut with mini cutters -- they held their shape well and did not puff or spread.  We dipped them in Chocolate Bar Fondue and Citrus Fondue from this site... excellent!

I halved the recipe, rolled the dough into logs, wrapped them in wax paper and refrigerated for about an hour.  Then I sliced them and baked. After baking I dipped them halfway into ganache. Perfect shortbread cookies!

I have not had much luck with homemade cookies and this was my first attempt at a shortbread.  OMG!!!  They came out PERFECT!  I used almond extract like a few others and the came out so yummy that I'm looking forward to trying cinnamon, vanilla and even raspberry varieties!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that even a cookie dope like me couldn't mess up!

These cookies will melt in your mouth literally! They are so great, I made them for a bake sale at school. The hard thing was just cutting them up but if you use enough flour it should be no problem.   And yes, the servings are wrong, the make twice as much or even more, so half the servings for your desired amount.

WOW!  These are amazing cookies.  Such a simple recipe too!  I was going to dip them half in chocolate but they were all gone by the time I got around to it.  I used different sized biscuit cutters (just simple circles with a scalloped edge) and they looked so elegant!  Thanks for the great recipe I'll be making a lot!!!

This cookies are great!  Except for making different variations, I followed the recipe precisely.  I divided the recipe into four and added vanilla extract to one batch then orange, peppermint and almond to the others.

I decorated them with mint chocolate chips, cinnamon chips, coconuts, almonds, pecans and some plain (not all mixed together :). )

They turned out fantastic, wore a lot of fun to make and very easy.  They are very rich, but that is what makes shortbread cookies so delicious.  They definitely made more than 2 dozen but I made them small.  

I don't have a cookie press, so I just rolled each batch into logs and cut them.  I agree with the reviewer who said the thinner, more crunchy ones taste better than the thicker ones.  Will make these again.

These were very easy to make and delicious. I recommend combining the ingredients by hand. I tried it with a mixer and then with a spatulta and only got loose crumbs. The dough came together when I mixed by hand. I halved the recipe and pressed the dough into a spring form pan. I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the shortbreat at 300 degrees for half an hour. Be sure to let them cool before you cut into them so that they don't crumble. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla for flavor. I will make these again.

As a shortbread cookie these are great.  But I do not think shortbread cookies have much flavor so I used them as a base cookie--I made thumb print cookies - apricot and strawberry jelly (store brand jelly)- and they were great.  These cookies also make good cut out cookies- I used a rectangle cutter with a frill edge- and then made them into frosting sandwiches.  I agree with a previous writer to sprinkle sugar on them.  Good base- great shortbread but I like more flavor. 5 stars for great shortbread and a great base

I tried this recipe in my new cookie press because it sounded simple.The cookies were great.I did replace half the sugar with brown sugar splenda.I think this must have gave them more flavor,because they sure were flavorable and perfect texture.Be sure to use real butter and to cook till just lightly browned on edges.Time depends on your cookie size.

Really rich, but tasted great.  I used unsalted butter instead of normal butter.  It had a great milky, melt-in-your-mouth taste.  Also, to make it even better, substitute 1 cup of icing sugar for flour.

Very good recipe! The cookies came out with a nice butttery flavor without over doing it. I didn't end up using a cookie press thought. I rolled them up into balls and then pressed on them with a spatula in perpendicular directions and added sugar to the top of them. They came out great!

Excellent! I packaged these and gave them out as Christmas gifts with rave reviews.  Made the following modifications: Added 1/3 c. ground toasted pecans.  Divided dough into fourths and rolled each into 2" logs.  Wrapped each in wax paper and refrigerated until hard.  Sliced into 1/4" slices and baked until barely a hint of golden brown. Sprinkled with powdered sugar when still warm and then again once cooled.  So easy....will be a standard Christmas cookie.

These cookies are really great, and are a great base as well.  I made half a batch with the orange and lemon zest (one of each), and that gave it a really nice citrus flavor that didn't overwhelm the shortbread flavor.  The other half was made with almond extract - good as well.  It was hard to use the colored sugar, depending on the shape of the cookie, it wouldn't stick or collect on top, but I sprinkled some cinnamon on the cookies after they came out and that was great also.  Oh and I only needed 3 1/2 cups of flour - any more would have been too much, and had to bake them at 10 minutes, 400 degrees.  It would have taken like 30 minutes, at 350.

Delicious, simple recipe!  Who'd have thought four ingredients could be so perfect together?  Didn't change a thing.  Rolled into balls and flattened with a glass jar dipped in turbinado sugar.

Made a mess and needed a very large bowl but these simple cookies turned out fantastic. Very melt-in-your mouth and excellent dipped in coffee or milk. I used the tip someone else mentioned and formed into 4 logs and refrigerated for 30 minutes. Slice 1/2" and bake! Oh and no way do these only make 2 dozen, I ended up with about 6 dozen! I was able to pass some on to a neighbor who always gives me baked goods. Also sprinkled powdered sugar on these...I thought of icing or decorating and you easily could, but sometimes simple is the best.

Absolutely delicious! The whole recipe gave us around 4 dozen 2-inch cookies. Remember not to over bake them...the aren't supposed to get really browned on top or bottom. And they come out of the oven a bit soft, but set up nicely as they cool.

I followed this recipe exactly, except halved it since I didn't want that many cookies. They looked delicious but the taste was not good at all. I'm not really sure how to describe the taste other than floury and blah. The texture however is great and melt in your mouth as others have suggested. 2 stars for simplicity and texture.

Buttery and flaky. Not too sweet and easy to make. Rolled and cut out nicely. Tried another recipe using confectioner's sugar and this was better balanced flavor-wise for my household. I will try no vanilla next time to compare.

This was simple, fast and delicious; And with melted dark chocolate, it was amazing. However, when I made these the dough was slightly too sticky so I just added some more flour until it became the consistency I wanted, and it turned out great. Of course the number of servings was extremely off, so a suggestion, halve the proportions.

First time trying these. Had to free form them  since I have no cookie cutters or press. I rolled them into balls and then flating and shaped them roughly into circles. I used only 3 cups of flour instead of 4 which worked just as well. These were cakelike buttery and delicious. I really enjoyed adding different flavours and decorations.

Very good recipe.  My family loves it & always asks me to make them.  I add a tad more flour  and top baked cookies with melted chocolate, sprinkles, cookie pieces or whatever I have laying around.

So I made the mistake of making these cookies. And by mistake, I mean that once I tried one and it melted in my mouth, I wanted to eat the whole batch! They are absolutely wonderful! Such a simple recipe. I don't have a cookie press so I took a suggestion from another review and rolled the dough into 4 logs and wrapped them in wax paper. I put 2 in the fridge to harden for about an hour and 2 went in the freezer for another day. I cut them into 1/2 inch disks and got about 3 doz. Baking time took about 5 minutes longer than what the recipe says so just keep an eye on them. Thank you for a great recipe.

Quickest, best shortbread recipe! Didn't have a cookie press so I decided it into 4 balls,  put it in the fridge for 30 mins and then rolled them into logs and cut 1cm pieces,  350 for 12 mins. Made approx 90 1.5inch cookies. The taste is so deliciously buttery and melts in your mouth!

These were great!  I was looking for a cookie I could use for mini fruit pizzas.  This one worked well.  Just made them a little thicker.  Rolled into a log and put in fridge for awhile.  Then sliced them and baked.  Will be making again for a Scotland project my daughter is doing.

Our go-to recipe for amazing shortbread!! I have made these as rolled cookies (using parchment paper to avoid sticking) and rolled them in logs and sliced them after chilling when I am pressed for time. We have never had them go wrong. A few tips: allow the butter to warm to room temperature before creaming (do not microwave!) and mix the dough with your hands after adding the flour to warm the butter and make it stick well together. Don't skip the chilling, and you'll get perfect flaky shortbread every time!

I just made this today and its a great shortbread recipe.  I don't own a cookie press, and my dough was sticky (I honestly expected this).  So I just ended up dropping a dolop of dough in my cupcake tin and pressed it down flat with my 1/4 c measuring cup.  Worked like a charm.  Delicious!

I cut the recipe in half and it made the perfect amount of cookies to share with a few friends. They were delicious. I got it in my head that I really wanted to dip them in milk chocolate, which I did to half of them. Glad I didn't do that to all of them. They were way yummy without chocolate! Will make these again and they'll hopefully become a tradition at the holidays!

The end result of making these cookies was good.  I rolled the dough and cut it with a heart cutter.  The first batch came out like pancakes.  I added about one cup of flour to the dough and tried it again.  These puffed up and lost a little shape.  While still warm I re-cut them with the cookie cutter.  They tasted fine.  For the third batch I sprinkled them with sugar and them were yummy.  Later I dipped the cookies in chocolate and the were perfect

They are good but they taste more like sugar cookies to me.

Really good cookies.  Reduced the servings because I wanted just something to snack on and still came out fine.  Very easy to make too

I didn't use cookie cutters with these. I formed them into little balls and did a criss cross pattern on top. I also added cinnamon to the batter to make it more like a snickerdoodle. Once the cookies were done I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. I loved it this way. I also like that it doesn't have eggs in it so my kids could come in and eat some dough while I was making them! I recommend adding cinnamon sugar. Its a great treat for kids and they are not overly sweet!

Just fabulous!! I used 3/4 c sugar and 1/4 cup powered sugar, also a little less flour and a little more vanilla. Perfection. So rich and buttery. A little crunchy, but still soft inside and melt in your mouth. I used a hand mixer and beat the butter and sugar til fluffy as stated. I don't have a cookie press so I formed the dough into two loaves and placed in parchment paper and put in the freezer for 30 mins. I cut into slices about an inch or so thick. They do not crumble and cooked perfect. My husband loved them!

PERFECT! I logged on to find a quick recipe to cure my immediate "need" for sweets and found this recipe. I was specifically looking for cookies with no egg in them as I am allergic to eggs. This was the easiest, quickest recipe I have ever found! I cut it in half, made it quickly and an hour later, my kids are fighting over the LAST of the cookies! I drizzled melted Baker's semi-sweet chocolate over the finished cookies - and actually, they would have been better without it! Thank you so much for this fast, easy and delicious recipe!

This recipe is surprisingly VERY good. I'm impressed; I didn't think such little ingredients would yield a recipe this delicious. All I did differently was add a dash of salt. To garnish I drizzled it with milk chocolate and topped that with sprinkles. Thanks!

Quick and easy cookie recipe, it comes together so fast with very few ingredients.  The cookies are tender and delicious - you don't even need any icing if you don't want it!  But for the holidays I did a quick vanilla icing to top these off with some sprinkles.

I made a half batch the other day to prepare for a major cookie-cooking expenditure today.  Just realized I accidentally used half the amount of butter needed and they still turned out fine!  Will be making again today with the correct amount of butter.  But word to the health-conscience, you can cut out some of the butter and they are STILL good :)

First time I ever write a review but its absolutely necessary ... this is the best cookie I've ever made ... buttery and sweet and delicious we can't stop eating them. I purposely chose this recipe because I needed lots of cookies and it made over 80 ... its a good thing since we've already eaten about a dozen. I followed the recipe to a t and used a cookie press for the first 60 cookies and the last 20 I rolled into a ball rolled in colored sugar and flattened on the pan. Im extremely excited and can't wait to make them again.

These are the best cookies ever in my humble opinion! I do dip some in chocolate because then it's real perfection. I also add 1/2 tsp of salt because salt makes everything better! Thank you Sally!!

Great recipe.  I used marg since I didn't have any butter and they turned out just fine.  I halved the dough and added brickle and white chocolate chips to one half and cranberries and white chocolate to the other.  Both batches turned out delicious!!

Very good, very simple, works well in cookie press.  I think they could use a bit more sugar, but then again, shortbread isn't supposed to be very sweet.

Easy to make, works great in a press, makes LOTS of cookies, and tastes AWESOME!  My kind of recipe.  Just gotta make sure that you watch the oven.  I baked mine for 7:30 on a dark pan and for 9:00 on one lined with silicone.  YUM!

Loved these!  Super easy and really good.   I did not use a cookie press, just rolled out and used the opening of a small glass to cut cookie.  Might try almond extract next time.

THESE WERE AMAZING!  They're exactly what a shortbread cookie should be!  I halved the recipe, and it makes about three dozen smaller cookies.. maybe a little more.  Rolled into balls and place on lightly greased cookie sheet, pressed with bottom of glass to even them out.  Baked for 12-14 mins for golden and crispy... Thanks!

These are absolutely delicious and so addicting!  I only made 1/2 batch and that is going to be plenty.  I didn't have a cookie press so I followed the reviewer that suggested rolling it into a log and refrigerating it and then slicing it.  The only thing I did wrong is I accidentally used unsalted butter and while they are good I think they will be much better next time if I use salted butter, the flavor will be more defined I think.  Either way, I am not throwing these babies out at all, they are still delicious!

Very easy to do and very nice results. I substituted a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste for the vanilla extract and dipped the finished cookies in melted chocolate. ;)

These are simple and delicious. I actually eat half the dough raw and the other half baked. The only thing different that it needed was a little more vanilla.

I'm new to baking, and found this very easy to follow. I love these cookies: good flavor and wonderful texture. After making the batter, I let it chill in the fridge for about 30-45 minutes; if I had more time, I would have let in chill for longer. I don't have a cookie press (or know what one is for that matter), so I just scooped with a spoon, rolled into balls, and flattened/cross-hatched with a fork, placing them onto a greased cookie sheet with a light coat of sifted flour. They baked for about 15 or so minutes, and were still moist. I added a combo of freshly-ground cinnamon, brown sugar, and white sugar on some of them. Yum! The only modifications I made were 1) adding 1/4 cup more sugar because my husband likes cloying sweet desserts and a dash more vanilla, because it's his favorite flavor. I will likely add more sugar, or add some brown sugar, and more vanilla next time. Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe---it is my go-to if I need good, fresh cookies in a pinch. I will never buy store cookies again.

I can't imagine using a whole pound of butter in these.  I halved the recipe and still came out with 2 dozen.  The taste was just okay.  Too buttery in my opinion.  My kids didn't like them.  I liked the fact that so little ingredients were used, but I could only eat two of them to give them an honest opinion, and I don't care to eat any more.

These came out excellent.  My son is on a gluten-free diet.  So, I substituted the flour with 3 cups coconut flour & 1 cup gluten free all purpose flour (Bob's Red Mill).  Rolled them into balls and topped each with a piece of dried pineapple.  Hope they last until Christmas ;-)

I just tried this recipe today, making only one-half for my first try. It is the BEST shortbread cookie I have tasted. At the 1/2 batch it yeilds just over 2 doz. 3 " cookies. For Christmas I brushes with a light glaze and added sprinkles. So easy I will definately make over and over....

Perfectly melt in your mouth shortbread cookie! I rolled mine into a log and chilled it overnight before slicing into 1/4" pieces. Make sure you bake them till they just begin to brown on the edges then let them cool only for a few minutes before removing them from the sheet. If you wait too long they might break.

If you've never tried shortbread before you will be totally impressed with this recipe. I know my family could't quite eating these. Didn't change a thing.

These are really buttery and delicious!! I did not alter anything.  I've tried a few other short bread recipes, and these are the best!!!  I melted some semi-sweet chocolate and dipped the top in it.  Awesome recipe!!

Followed the recipe ALMOST exactly--I used almond oil instead of vanilla.  Way better than store bought We will be making these again. Super easy, super cheap, and super delicious.

I love this 4-ingredient shortbread cookie recipe not just because it's so easy to make, but because it makes absolutely delicious cookies that taste EXACTLY how shortbread cookies should! They are heavenly. Do not change the ingredients! They are perfect! I don't have a cookie press, so I roll the dough into walnut sized balls and press flat on the baking sheet. A handmade decorating template & a few colorful sprinkles make for a fun & tasty Christmas cookie. Thank you for sharing this recipe! It's a keeper & a frequent repeater even after the holidays. :)

Taste just like the shortbread cookies in a tin you buy during the holidays. Yum! Added 2tsp almond extract as some reviews suggested. For half of my batch I added chopped walnuts to top of cookies before placing in oven. Cookies tasted even better.

Exactly what I was looking for -- rich, buttery and not overly refined. Makes a great bar cookie, which is so easy. After stirring the flour in by hand (instead of with the mixer), I pressed it into a sheet pan. It took a few minutes longer to bake this way -- just until it stopped bubbling and looked a little toasty around the edges. Let them cool completely before cutting!

These shortbread cookies are awesome!  Very buttery and very easy to make.  I don't have a cookie press so I just rolled them out with a rolling pin and then used cookie cutters.  It worked just fine.  I did have to use my hands to mix the batter though because there isn't much liquid so it got sort of crumbly, but it still turned out great.  I had to bake mine for 11 minutes.

Awesome.. super fast recipe. The perfect cookie for dipping chocolate. You can either keep the recipe as is or add a little more sugar for a sweeter cookie. Great recipe!

These are THE shortbread cookies that you get in christmas tins around the holidays! I halved the recipe and it still worked well, mine did take a little longer to cook (about 13 to 15 minutes)through. I pulled the first batch out at 12 minutes and they cookies were white and tasted like flour :( I put them back in until they turned golden in color and then they were perfect!!

Wow! All I can say is these are amazing and so freakin simple! You don't know how many of these recipes I have tried in my pampered chef cookie press just to turn out like . So I'd pretty much given up for years and decided to try some new recipes today. I made one other recipe on this site with way more ingredients and had to dump the dough. Then I found this one, it seemed too easy. I finally made beautiful Christmas trees and wreaths and snowflakes!!!! Not only do they look good, my picky 6 year old said they are delicious!

Great recipe.  Cookies do melt in your mouth.  Too much butter though.  I will make again, but will either lessen the butter or add more flour and sugar. I added vanilla nut flavoring and pecans to the recipe. Yummy

I liked how simple this recipe was, I used it to bake about 400 cookies for my wedding! Each guest got to take home a little packet of three cookies cut into the shape of a tulip. I also used it to make the cookies for my wedding cake instead of having a cake. I added variety to the cookies for my "cake" by including instant coffee in a batch, orange zest in another, coco, cinnamon, and than chocolate chips in the last. I also added bright food colouring and drizzled chocolate on some to add a little flare! They all turned out great and  for the number I needed it was very affordable :)

I love this recipe! I chose this recipe because the list of ingredients was simple, and they turned out wonderfully. I had to make cookies for the office, and these were a tremendous hit! I spooned out the dough with a teaspoon, rolled it between my palms, and placed it on a greased cookie sheet. I took Hershey's kisses and pressed them into the center of the ball of dough on the sheet and baked them like that, they turned out both pretty and tasty! I also baked some without any embellishment, and they were great too. My husband loves shortbread cookies, and he said these were the some of the best cookies he'd ever had in his life!

Excellent shortbread cookies! I found them best when cut thin.  Great for milk and cookies--thicker cookies don't absorb the milk but the thin ones just melt in your mouth!  DELICIOUS! Add smarties or chocolate chipits to decorate cookies. NB: The metric instructions are incorrect. Cookies taste floury and "pastey" in your mouth and you need to add a lot more flour to the dough to roll it out.  Measure out the ingredients for a successful batch.

So easy and so good. I was making 12 types of cookies yesterday so, I wanted a few easy recipes. I got it.. These were great and easy to work with. I used my cookie press and got about 6 dz cookies. I put green food coloring in the dough and made Christmas trees, blue snowfakes with coconut and plain ones with shaved chocolate. They were all great!! Thanks for sharing this recipes!

The *taste* is great. Very much the shortbread flavor I was hoping for BUT, the proportions if I make these again it'll be either less butter or more flour. They looked more like thin florentine lace cookies than shortbread. There was enough butter that they were greasy to hold and after one, the butter made your stomach not want more. They do taste great though.

Good texture - but the taste isn't quite there.  But on the floury side and definitely not sweet enough.

these were very good, but I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I added a little more vanilla, and a bit of lemon extract.

These were very easy to make. I added some Peanut M&M's to them. However, I, like a few other reviews found these a bit on the floury taste.

I love the way these cookies melt in your mouth! The only change I did was to add a pinch of salt into the batter. I made them into chlocolate chip cookies by adding 3/4 C chocolate chips. It would have gotten 5 stars if it isn't for a weird aftertaste - maybe it's from the salt I added or that I'm not using fresh flour.

These came out great and were so easy to make!  Exactly what I  was looking for.  I don't have a cookie press, so I flattened the cookies by hand, takes a long time, but it's worth it in the end.  I didn't have any extract on hand, so I made the cookies without the vanilla, and it was still very good.  This will be my recipe from now on :)  Thanks!

Super easy and tastes just like a shortbread cookie should.  To make them even better though, I replaced the vanilla extract with almond extract...yum!  And then I melted chocolate chips and dipped the top of each cookie...so good!

Easy cookies...my husband refers to them as the "crack" cookies...very addictive.  I had to beat him away from them and ultimately had to make him his own special batch that he could stuff himself with.  I rolled and then flattened the cookies with a glass dipped in colored suger to make them prettier...however, I think I'm going to invest in some cookies stamps for next Christmas so make them even cuter.  Wonderfully easy and tasty recipe!

The dough on this was too soft for the cookie press. the cookies didn't look the grates but they still tasted good. would recommend just dropping by the teaspoon onto the cookie sheet.

This is THE BEST shortbreak cookie recipe ever!  I made it with raspberry preserves in a thumbprint cookie and for Christmas, I rolled balls in red and green sugar.  They were very pretty and easy for a nice spot of color on a cookie tray.  I then used decorating icing and piped a bow on each cookie, they were packages.  Looked great and tasted wonderful!  Much easier than cut outs.

Best shortbread cookie recipe I've tasted...and simple to make. I have had nothing but praise for these melt-in-your-mouth treats.

These are the best shortbread cookies ever.  My husband is not the biggest cookie fan but we are both addicted.  I have never seen him eat so many cookies.  I packed some with his lunch and he told me they never made it to work.

I loved this recipe!!  A few years ago a lady on my job my really good shortbread and I have been searching for a good recipe ever since.  These were really easy to make!  I did find however, that people have to be shortbread fans to really appreciate this recipe.  We also added sugar to the top just to add extra flavor!!!  Definatley will make again.

These are delicious. Flaky and crisp. I roled out the dough and cut out shapes. The only down side about this recipes is that they spread a little during baking, otherwise very good.

These are very good shortbread cookies.  I think, next time, I will try adding maybe 1/4 tsp of salt, as the shortbread I've had has had the tiniest hint of salt and it goes well with the sugar.  Thank you, Sally!

I followed a reviewer’s suggestion of putting the roll of dough into the refrigerator since I don’t have a cookie press. I made two rolls about 2 inches thick and 18 inches long, wrapped them in wax paper and put them in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. I then cut the cookies off the roll, each one about 1/2 inch thick, then baked them for 14 mins since they went into the oven cold. They are delicious.

I made these last night and they are delicious. I made half the recipe and had 30 cookies. The only thing thing I did different was to add 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of one and 1 tablespoon of milk. I rolled them into balls and flattened them with the bottom of a glass.. I melted about one cup mini chocolate chips and 1 1/2 tablespoons salted butter and dipped the cookies after they cooled into the chocolate. I will be making these for Christmas and will make some dipped in melted mint chocolate chip s.

Took way longer to bake than recipe states and when it was finally done it had the consistency of sand and would fall apart at the slightest touch.  

The version of this recipe in the recent all recipe magazine suggests you melt chocolate chips and dip cookies in the chocolate, but it gave no instructions on how to melt the chocolate.

I made this for my wife and others at the nursing home that she is in. I also took some to work, everyone that had some really enjoyed them. I did not change anything and plan to make them again. I would suggest to leave the dough a little thicker as if it is too thin, the cookies are very brittle, making them hard to dip in the chocolate. Overall, I was pleased with my first attempt and had better results from shaping the dough round, leaving it thicker and cutting it into wedges instead of the thinner rectangle shape.

I thought these were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I don't have a cookie press, so I rolled the dough into logs, chilled, then sliced about 1/2" thick and baked for about 11 minutes. They came out very rich and buttery, not overly sweet but very tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I sprinkled some with colored sugar or sprinkles before baking and left the rest plain, then half-dipped in melted chocolate after they cooled. All were good, next time I will try doing thumbprints filled with jam. Very versatile and very easy. I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing!

I have used this recipe twice and both times were delicious. I let the dough chill for about an hour and then rolled it out and used cookie cutters. They came out perfectly. Simple and scrumptious!

One of my favorite shortbread recipes. Only thing is that you ABSOLUTELY need REAL BUTTER. Not margarine or hydrogenated oil spread (country crock), I mean >35% saturated fat butter. If you do not use real butter you will taste flour (a flavorless cookie). I made my own butter with heavy cream and they were so delicious. I'll be making them again, today. I did not have a cookie press so I froze the dough for 20 minutes and rolled it out between floured parchment paper and then I used a floured cutter. I definitely recommend a cookie press, instead.

Perfect recipe. The only adjustment we made was the baking time. 300 degrees for 20-30 minutes made dry, classic shortbread. We rolled into logs and refrigerated like some others. Amazing!!

I loved this recipe, these cookies are so yummy! I didn't have a cookie press so I just rolled the dough out on a floured surface with a rolling pin and used cookie cutters and they turned out perfect! My only complaint is that this recipe makes too many cookies haha, I think I'm just going to halve the recipe next time (:

I was looking for a recipe to use with my Kuhn Rikon cookie press. I am giving this recipe 4 stars because it is labeled as a recipe for a press, but it did not work with mine. Once I discovered that the press would not work, I rolled out the dough and made cut out shortbread cookies. I halved the recipe and ended up with 3 dozen small/medium cutouts. The cookies are buttery and delicious. I am going to dip them in chocolate.  I would use this recipe again for cut outs, but not a press.

Tweaked the recipe here and there. I used a mixing machine. I super whipped the butter and sugar.  Added 1/2 cup of flour more than called for, then added 2 Tbs gluten flour, 1/4 tsp maple flavor, 1/4 tsp of ground cloves, and 3/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts. I used an old fashioned small ice cream scoop to measure out the dough and  squished it down with the bottom of a coffee mug dipped in sugar. Merry Christmas!

Used this recipe as written with a cookie press to make pillow cookies with small pieces of Hershey's inside.  No ingredient change for altitude (6,000 ft).  Baked for 14 min at 350 on silpat mats on the cookie sheets.  We've made them twice and they turned out great.

I did not care for this recipe. I could not roll the dough and all the cookies just spread into one giant one in my oven.

I halved this recipe and it made exactly 2 dozen fair size cookies. I do not have a cookie press so I refrigerated the dough for a half an hour( as another review suggested) then rolled into 24 balls. I rolled the balls in powdered sugar then made a thumbprint and put half a maraschino cherry in the top and baked for 11 mins. Next time I WOULD NOT refrigerate the dough first... The cookies turned out very thick and had big splits in them( not a nice presentation for holiday gifts).... The taste and texture of the cookies was very good. I will make these again and not refrigerate the dough... And add a pinch of salt.

I have used this recipe several times now and is a complete success. Thanks for the opportunity to use it.  As the holiday season approaches, the grandkids want to bake cookies for Santa, the parents ask me to make these since they must  make them disappear.  Love these cookies!!

Awesome recipe. However, these taste best after cooling. Eating them warm isn't good, in my opinion.

I love this recipe. It was great.  My god children had so much fun because the recipe was easy for them to grasp. I added extra tsp of Mexican vanilla (you can find this vanilla extract online at Penzey's Spices).  Even though the recipe does not call for salt, I added a tsp of saIt ( next time I will not add the salt. I can then compare them and make a final decision whether to add salt or not.) I also used confection sugar to coat dough and roller. It really added to the flavor.  Also make sure you follow the time strictly.  If the edges become a caranel brown, you have over cooked them.  This was an excellent recipe. I will place this one in my recipe box. Yummy!

This recipe is awesome! Simple ingredients, easy & clear instructions wonderful for an amateur like me. In fact I tried this with my 9yr old son & we both enjoyed making the cookies so much. I halved the ingredients, skipped the vanilla extract,  added chocolate chips. Turned out awesome, the cookies literally melts in my mouth. I didnt get a chance to store the first batches. Husband & son cleaned them off the rack! Thank you Sally for the recipe.  I cant wait to try them again next weekend & im planning to add dried cranberries & white chocolates.  Thumbs up!! Im going to make them this xmas!!

The other reviewers are right: these melt in your mouth and are delicious, but the dough is pretty gooey and hard to work with without a cookie press. Like another reviewer, I ended up making small balls and flattening them with my hands. I halved the recipe and ended up with about 3 dozen cookies.

This recipe made the perfect shortbread cookie. I'm not much for sweets and desserts, but every once in a while I get a craving. Well, I had a 'need' yesterday, but didn't feel like spending an hour in the kitchen just to take care of a craving that will be taken care of with a bite or two of something sweet. I scaled down the recipe by 3/4, and was still able to get a nice sized log.  I whipped these up in less than 5 minutes, then I placed the mixture in the fridge for about 10 minutes to let it firm up a bit. I then put the mixture in saran wrap and formed it into a log (just kind of form it into a log by hand, wrap it in saran wrap and roll it along your counter...it'll be the perfect log shape in no time), then I cut 8, 1/4 inch thick cookies and baked them for about 9 minutes. This was the perfect amount for my boyfriend and I to have a sweet snack. I wrapped the rest of the dough and placed it in the fridge, and I'll be able to slice and bake a few whenever I have my next 'need'. I think the next time I make a batch, I'll add a bit of lemon juice to make Lemon Shortbread Cookies! Either way, great recipe!!

I baked these with my daughter. My wife said they were perfect.

I almost bought shortbread cookies today at the grocery store with a long list of ingredkents.  I am so glad I found this simple 4 ingredient cookie recipe.  

I also do not have a cookie press and do not care to have one, so I rolled the dough into a log. Chilled it in the fridge and sliced them into thick slices and baked for 10 minutes.

This is a great classic understated cookie.  

Thanks all recipes.

I halved the recipe and I still got more than 2 dozen cookies. I don't have a cookie press so I just rolled up the dough into 2 logs, wrapped them up in plastic wrap and put them in the freezer for a bit before putting them in the fridge overnight. Then cut them in 1/2 inch slices and onto the cookie sheet with parchment paper. Turned out perfect in 12 minutes!!

This actually makes several dozen cookies. Don't forget they don't rise like sugar cookies so roll them as thick as you want the cookie to be. I was able to roll them out and use cookie cutters with no problem. I love recipes that only have a few ingredients like this! I got lots of compliments on the cookies and I think they were my favorite tasting shortbread cookies ever. A definite keeper!

This recipe did not do well with my old fashioned cookie press or as drop cookies.  That being said they were absolutely perfect for rolled out cutters!  I simply chilled the dough and rolled out between parchment sheets- they kept their shape wonderfully even rolled thin!  I will be substituting these for sugar cutouts for the holidays.  The secret is to cream the butter and sugar very well and mixing very well between adding small amounts of flour or they can taste very flour-y.  It also yielded much more than 2 dozen....

They turned out well for my first time, tasted good. The only thing I was confused about was do I use salted butter or unsalted?(this was not specified in recipe). I used unsalted butter and they tasted good. 

If you are a perfectionist, you will need to roll out the dough and use a cookie cutter. I tried a method I read on another recipe, rolled a log in wax paper and froze the batter. Then thawed it a bit and cut 1/2inch slices then bake.

I've made several batches of this recipe, substituting almond extract for vanilla, and powdered sugar for granulated (1.75c powdered = 1c granulated), which leaves it with a consistency of play dough which is excellent for loading into my cookie press, with no need to refrigerate.  I do a double click (larger cookie) on the cookie press, 5 minutes @ 350, and then turn for another 4 minutes, then remove to cool for 5 minutes, and rack to fully cool.  Each batch results in approximately 70 yummy cookies that melt in your mouth.

Mmmm... I halved the recipe and rolled dough into two logs wrapped in parchment paper. I refrigerated the logs for about 30 minutes and then sliced into quarter inch slices with a sharp knife. I then used the same parchment paper to bake these for almost 15 minutes. Delicious. Just make sure the dough is properly mixed before rolling the dough. Next time, after baking and cooling, I will try these dipped halfway in melted bittersweet chocolate and chopped almonds.

I tried this recipe because I was out of corn starch, and my usual recipe requires it.  These cookies stay soft, but this is not like the classic shortbread. More chewy then melty. I dipped the tips of the cookies in a chocolate ganache, complimented the cookies nicely.

This is a very good basic shortbread, and easy to innovate with. To one batch, I added lemon juice, lemon zest and a little more sugar. In the other, I replaced 1/2 a cup of flour with cocoa. I used food coloring to make these dark green for trees and wreaths. They were fantastic.

Just put them in the oven.  Way too much flour, couldn't roll the dough.  Couldn't flatten the dough.  Ended up rolling it into balls & hoping for the best.  I'm glad I only made half the recipe :(

I just made these to take to a social gathering and of course I had to try them first and wow, so good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have a cookie press or cookie cutters, so I chilled the dough for 30 minutes and rolled in to walnut size balls, rolled them in powdered sugar and suggested by another reviewer, and then pressed down on them slightly with the bottom of a teacup. After they were cooled, I melted some milk chocolate chips, put in a ziploc bag, cut the tip, and drizzled it over the cookies. They look great, and taste even better. Can't to see how my friends enjoy them!

OMG, SO DELISH!!!
Melt in your mouth buttery. Crisp, light, and full of flavor.
I love that there are only 4 ingredients and yet they taste so amazing. I used a cookie cutter and iced them with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe from this site. I will be making these over and over again. Thanks!

PS. I 1/4 the recipe to try it out and it made 1 dozen regular sized  cookies. You can easily get 4 dozen regular sized cookies from the full recipe.

I haven't had much luck with shortbread before but these are great.  There's a few things to remember: If the only shortbread you've ever tasted is store bought and you think that's how it's suppose to taste, you might not give this recipe the credit it deserves.  For those who are complaining about the cookie being too hard, you may not have creamed the butter and sugar long enough.  You really need to get the air in there and trust me these cookies melt in your mouth.  I made them and served butter pecan icecream with them and it was so perfect.  Also, I didn't use a cookie press because I just like to make logs and I made two large ones.  You get a ton of cookies.  Also, depending on how big and thick the cookies are you may need to increase the cooking time by 2-5 minutes.  Thanks for recipe.

I used almond extract instead of vanilla and they were fabulous! It was a very easy cookie to make and an excellent excuse to use my cookie press.

Mine were Okay, not much flavour, like other reviews stated, too much flower, the dough just crumbled. I had to sprinkle with water to hold it together. It may be Canadian flour vs US. I have heard that can make a difference. I may try again using less flour.

This is the best Shortbread cookie recipe I've found so far. My husbands grandmother is from England and notoriously hard on shortbread since she grew up with traditional shortbread and shortbread cookies. I made these and she raved about them and no longer wants any kind but the ones I make. I'd say that's a compliment!! 
I do tweak mine just a bit by sometimes adding a scraped vanilla bean and only one teaspoon of Vanilla extract. I prefer also to let the dough chill after I mix it together and roll it into a roll, wrap in plastic and refrigerate and then cut slices off of to bake. With the amount of butter, it just really is easier, less messy, etc. Am thinking of trying these with some chopped pecans and toffee bits one day!

While these cookies are fairly good, I was disappointed.  I think the best and only way to get the true authentic taste and feel of shortbread is to just make shortbread in the old and traditional way.

Very easy to make and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out excellent. I love that they have only a few ingredients and still taste this great. I added almond extract to a 1/4 of the dough and the cookies were great, I recommend trying it. Similar to other people who tried the recipe, I got a lot more than 2 dozen, like 4 dozen!

I did not have a cookie press so my first time making these it was difficult to keep them together. A long wait in the fridge really helped that the second time around. That said, they taste amazing! I used cookie cutters and decorated them. They matched up to some of the "shortbread guru's" recipes. Thanks for sharing :)

Great shortbread recipe.  Can be made in various ways...I like using Pampered Chef small scoop the best. They turn out uniform size and shape without getting your hands messy. I also sprinkled colored sugar on before baking. Will definitely be a favorite.

So easy and so delicious. I just made tiny balls and flattened them so they were like tiny patties. After they were cooked, I cooled them for 5 minutes and then dipped half in semi-sweet chocolate. Mmm! 

I also halved the recipe and got about 45 medium sized cookies.

These are absolutely perfect! I was worried about making them after reading most of the reviews-- a good number of them say the cookies are bland, but a good number of them say to bake as directed and they'll turn out fine. I decided to err on the side of caution and I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla and about 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I mostly melted the butter in the microwav (with a few large lumps) and I baked them for about 15 minutes to make them a little crunchier (we just like them that way). They are absolutely amazing! My mom can't stop eating them! Can't wait to add chocolate and frosting to cute them up a bit! Will definitely be making more-- a new Christmas tradition!

soooo good with some jam or nutella on top, you could even dip it in some dark chocolate, the reason that im not rating this a 5 is because it doesnt mention salt i would add at least 1/2 teasopoon to this recipe and sprinkle a bit of sugar and fleur de sel on top, that would make it a 5 in my book

The yummiest cookies I've ever made!!  I was trying to copy Panera Bread's shortbread cookie for summer (the cute litle flower shape with yellow frosting and pink sprinkles).  Gotta say this recipe was even better!  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting flavored with orange extract.  Delicious!

These shortbread cookies are fantastic.  Even hubs loved them and he has absolutely NO sweet tooth.  I quartered the recipe so we wouldn't have cookies running out our ears and ended up making a second batch with almond extract which we liked even better. =)

I followed the directions to the letter. It had hardly any flavor and was very crumbly. Would not recomment this.

i just tried this recipe today. I was looking for something similar to the Pepperidge farm Chessmen cookies. The cookies turned out pretty good but I realized that the missing ingredient is salt. It might work if added in with the flour but I discovered that if you sprinkle the cookies with salt while they are still warm, that is just as good. The salt really made the cookies taste better. 

I put the cookie dough in the fridge in a covered container before rolling and cutting with big cookie cutters.

I used exactly half of the ingredients (added approx. 3 more TEASPOONS of sugar). 
The cookies also need to cool on the baking sheet before removed otherwise they will be crumby and break apart. Like I said earlier, if you are looking for more taste, try sprinkling a little salt while they are cooling on the cookie dish.

These are great; just what you would expect out of a shortbread cookie. The dough was relatively easy to work with. I rolled it out and cut it into rounds rather than using a cookie press.

Had a cookie craving and decided to see if I could bake something with ingredients I had around.  I googled shortbread cookies, which got me here.  This recipe is very easy to make and it really hit the spot!  I divided the recipe by 4 and it made 1 dozen cookies.

This recipe was really easy to make, I am a beginner baker and I made these with my brother. They are really easy and a big hit. Super yummy. A few suggestions: We halved the recipe, and made 23 cookies (of all sizes). We didn't have a cookie press, so we just used our hands. The dough is EXTREMELY crumbly, but it sticks together well.  We baked them for about 17 minutes, checking every one or two minutes, EVEN THOUGH the recipe only says 10-12 minutes. However, it also said that it made 2 dozen cookies. They must have been mega cookies, because we had lots when we halved the recipe! Thanks though, we will definitely make these again!

These really are pretty good -- even if you dont' have butter.  I've made a batch both ways now, the first time I had a craving for shortbread but no butter in the house so I took a shot in the dark and it wasn't bad at all!  I prefer my shortbread thicker and crumbly than the recipe calls for.  Didn't have a cookie press and simply formed it into one long log and put it in the deep freeze for an hour or so, sliced, stabbed with a fork a few times and baked on parchment paper.

Slam dunk. Couldnt be easier. I'm a novice to baking, and the first time I made them, they were perfection. the second time i made them, i substituted butter for Crisco, after doing all the research, and not only was the flavour consistent, but the classic and traditional texture of the Shortbread was divine~!

Great texture!! I also like that they're not particularly sweet, which is great if you plan to add icing.  Be careful not to make the cookies too thick or they get too crumbly.

WOW! My boyfriend's from Scotland and was craving some shortbread cookies!  We halved the recipe and were blown away how rich and wonderful these cookies are! So easy to make!  We didn't have a cookie press so we just rolled them into little balls and pressed them by hand!  He'll be makin' a batch for his mum when he goes back! :) It's gorgeous with a cup of tea!!!! P: YUMMMMM!!!!

DELICIOUS!  I could barely keep out of the dough!  Very good, balanced taste-not too sweet, or too bland.  I rolled the dough into little balls and then flattened on the cookie sheet and it worked out just fine.  Great, simple cookie!

These are the first time I have ever tried making shortbread. Recipe was amazing. Think I will cut back on the flour by maybe 1/4 c or so. Got dry pretty fast and couldn't get last 18-24 cookies through the press. Recipe does make about 6 dozen. Husband and kids are VERY happy. Will use this recipe again and again!!!

These worked great in my cookie press! They came out really buttery and SUPER yummy, but I'd suggest refrigerating the dough for 15 minutes or so if using a cookie press!  Thanks for sharing :)

I didn't taste them because I don't eat sugar, however I am giving them 5 stars because my husband thought they were great and he;s tough to please! I halved the reciipe, but accidently still added the 2 tsp. of vanilla. Irolled the dough quite thick and cut them out. They needed and additional 6 minutes or so in the oven and I left them on the cookie sheet to cool before moving them because they looked as though they might crumble. Then I drizzled them with a little milk chocolate.

Easy recipe but these cookies were somewhat bland.  Needed a little more sugar.    I made 2 batches, one with white sugar and one with brown sugar and the brown sugar came out much better.  A more richer flavor.  The white sugar cookie tasted like there was too much flour.  Very bland tasting.  Try brown sugar and this recipe would be a 5 star.

It's a fool proof recipe!  DELICIOUS.  I usually make them on the puffed up side with a dallop of strawberry preserves.  If you want plump them up like I do I'd recommend whipping the sugar and butter up with a mixer rather than just creaming it up.    It took 20-25 minutes for my puffy cookies to bake.  5 stars using ALMOND extract.  4-stars for vanilla extract.

I reduced the ingredients to a quarter and still got a good batch of chocolate swirl cookies. They're very nice but I would add a bit more sugar next time. Here how I did; divide the ingredients into two portions, take 1/5 (25 g from 125 g) flour off from one portion and substitute with 25 g cocoa powder, mix the dough seperately to make one plain and one chocolate dough, chill the dough for 30 min, roll each dough out to rectangular shape on floured surface (3 mm thick), place the chocolate sheet on plain sheet and roll them together into a log, wrap and chill for 30 min, cut the log to 4 mm thick cookies and bake accordingly to the directions.

Excellent recipe. Only change I made was to add some coarse kosher salt, as those little nuggets of salt is one of my favorite things about shortbread.  This is truly an excellent cookie for as simple as the recipe is.  Oh, and I rolled the dough up in a ball and used a cookie stamp to flatten the ball. The dough did retain some of the stamp decoration.

These are pretty good, very rich. They are a very typical shortbread but very easy and they smell wonderful. Would give them five stars but im still searching for a replica of the first shortbread I ever tried. This recipe is definately a must try tho!

I added a dash of cinnamon to these as well as a dash of pumpkin spice. I ended up rolling them out and using cookie cutters, and sprinkled colored sugar on top. These cookies are absolutely amazing. Everyone who had some loooooved them. I also ended up with about 3 dozen cookies.

Excellent Recipe!  Very easy to make and it doesn't require any electric tools!  I cut the ingredients in half and was able to make 2 dozen cookies.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract and rolled the dough because I didn't have cookie press.  Delicious!

Delicate, slightly crisp, not too sweet, nice buttery flavor. Like another reviewer, I formed logs and froze for 20 min. and then sliced.- This was far easier than rolling into balls or even drop cookies. I made "Milanos" by sandwiching two together with a fudgy glaze... I was very pleased with the result!  I might try decreasing the butter by 1 or 2 Tbl. next time, they were just a tad greasy, but if it doesn't work I'll still be perfectly satisfied with the result.  This is a KEEPER!

Very good cookies!  I halved the recipe and creamed the heck out of it.   I rolled into 1" balls and pressed with a fork and made 2 dozen Oreo-sized cookies.

I made them exactly like the recipe and my husband and stepson couldn't stop eating them.  These are wonderful as is.  I didn't put a thing on them.  They'd be good drizzled with chocolate too.

I decided to try this shortbread after reading all the rave reviews it received... I am so happy that I did! Not only is the recipe simple, does it use readily available ingredients but I was able to make it without the aid of an electric beater and this cookies still turned out excellently! I think using good quality butter is the trick to the great taste but the texture is very shortbready too, not too dense but still recognisable as shortbread! I also used vanilla sugar as i didnt have any extract and this seems to have given a very gentle vanilla flavour. Like other reviewers I also shaped the dough into a rough log, wrapped it in plastic wrap, refriegerated and then cut 1 inch slices. My cookies spread to about 1 1/2 times their original size and needed the full 12 mins in the oven. Having being forewarned, I only made 1/4 batch of this recipe and turned these cookies into an amazing Christmas pressent.

Delicious!  I whipped the living daylights out of the dough in every step.  I split the dough into 4 logs and wrapped in wax paper to chill it (as per another reviewer), then sliced into 1/2" slices.  Yielded over 5 doz cookies.  Thanks!  Will definitely be making this one again!

Best shortbread cookies ever! Dough was perfect for the cookie press and made way more than the recipe states.  Lucky for us because nobody could stop eating them! Followed exactly 1st time then added colored sugar, and lemon zest 2nd time- both were awesome

Delicious and simple! I used this recipe in the Almond-Raspberry Meringue Bar recipe on this website, turning it into a Shortbread-Raspberry Meringue Bar (absolutely beautiful and festive looking). The shortbread layer is buttery and has great texture! I used the recipe as is and pressed it into a parchment-paper lined 9x13 pan, then followed the directions for the other recipe for baking instructions and layering (cookie layer is mostly baked before raspberry and meringue layers are added, then returned to oven.) Bars are cut in pan once cooled and remove easily (cut with plastic knife). Can't wait to take it to the company bake sale!

I expected these cookies to be delicious by reading the reviews. I found them a little dry and very bland. I am going to add a powdered sugar glaze just to give it a little sweetness.

I absolutely love it! however, i agree with those who said it needed more flavor. I would definitely use lemon flavoring next time. for those who are using a cookie press, u need to soften the dough every time u put some in the press.

These cookies were fantastic! They remind me of the wonderful shortbread that I get in Maui, and they are sooooo easy to make.    I did not have a cookie press, so I rolled the dough into walnut sized balls, and flattened them with my thumb.   I also quartered the recipe, since I only had one stick of butter. It worked perfect, especially with the addition of mini chocolate chips:)   If you make these with margarine (I used Smart Balance in a test batch), the texture stays the same, but the cookies take on a margarine flavour. It really is best to use butter for these cookies for taste purposes. If you do not mind the margarine flavour, less cholesterol, healthier fats, and some omega in your cookies, then you can use Smart Balance.    Either way, I love these cookies. Next time, I will try mini chocolate chips, in addition to dipping them in chocolate. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Sally :)

I voted 4 stars because they were good cookies, still a little on the floury side even after adding vanilla.  I also added an m&m to the tops for the kids. However, I really enjoyed the cookies!

This was a good recipe.  However, I couldn't give it 5 stars as it tasted a bit "floury" for me.  Next time, I will try almond instead of vanilla to see if it makes a difference.

Very tasty cookie for so few ingredients! Trust the reviews you wont be dissapointed. I halved the recipe so i wouldn't end up eating 4 doz. by myself, and i also pressed shredded  toasted almonds to the tops of mine and they came out fabulous. I didn't have a cookie press either so i just spooned out roughly 1 tsp balls onto sheet and then flattened out with a spoon.

I love these!  They are so easy to make, and I made so many (more than 75).  I did add about 1/4 Tsp of vanilla, and about a tablespoon of lemon juice, just to get a less floury taste.  I will make these again.  Thanks for sharing.

Deliciouso!! Very easy and very yummy! I halved the recipe to 6 servings and it made 24 regular-sized cookies. Swapped almond extract for vanilla, added chopped pecans, and formed it into a roll onto parchment paper and refrigerated dough for 15 minutes. Then I sliced it and baked and they turned out evenly shaped. Bake for 12 mintues for the golden look!

Everything you would expect in a shortbread cookie.  Not too sweet.  Very customizable.  I used mint flavouring instead of vanilla. I did the rolling into balls and pressing with a fork to bake mine.  Turned out great!  Forgot them in the oven for over 25 minutes - thankfully I was using my stone cookie sheet...so although well browned, these cookies did not burn and tasted great!  I hope to memorize this one.

Amazing cookies!  I halved the recipe, and it still made quite a few cookies.  I don't have a cookie press, so just rolled them into little balls and pushed them down on the sheet with a spoon.  I baked them for 12 minutes and they turned out fantastic!  Also, after reading many of the reviews, I added a little bit of orange zest to some of the dough and these ones turned out AMAZING.  Just a little hint of orange flavour, they are awesome!  Going to definately make these again, and experiment with different ingredients and flavours.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  :)

I have made these following the recipe to the letter, and I also get around 70-80 cookies using my cookie press.  I sprinkle them with coarse white sugar sprinkles before baking (colored coarse sugar sprinkles during holidays) to give them some sparkle.  Wonderful flavor.  They freeze very well after baked and cooled.  I have kept them frozen for 3 months and still tasted wonderful.

Fresh from the oven just now and WOW! Yummy! Don't make the mistake of overbaking them by gaging their color. These stay virtually the same color when done. Mine were perfect after exactly 10 minutes.

Thank you for this recipe! Finally a shortbread cookie that is just as good as the ones I get from Scotland.  I love eating them just barely still warm from the oven.  Simple recipe, I cut in half as I have add terrible luck with cookie recipes lately. However I will be buying more ingredients this weekend to make some more. A new Christmas tradition for this family!

Awesome cookie!! My boyfriend asked me to try making shortbread cookies and I tried this recipe - he said it's the best cookie I've ever made.  I tried them in the cookie press but I think I like them better just using a cookie scoop and then pressing them down a little in middle to spread them out. Very delicate and light - literally melt in your mouth.  Thanks for a great recipe - very easy!!

This recipe is great to put in the cookie press.  (I make my cookies with a smaller design)  The cookies are so tasty!!  I make 1/2 the recipe and add more vanilla for extra flavor and we also decorate with colored sprinkles.  My family likes to put the cookies in the freezer and eat them cold.  These shortbread cookies have been a favorite in my family for just over a year.  Thanks!

This is a fairly good recipe. I cut in in 1/2 because I didn't want a ton of cookies. And I used about 1/4 cup cornstarch in place of some flour....cornstarch helps make a melt in your mouth shortbread. For some of them I put a chocolate chunk in the middle, rolled in sugar and baked as a ball. They took about 20 minutes to bake at 350 in my oven. I like them...not sure how Hubby will feel about them...he's more of a traditional scottish shortbread lover. But overall it's not too bad a recipe. Oh I also whipped them with an electric mixer..wouldn't work for using cookie cutters though.

The first time I tried this recipe I used margarine to cut fat (since it calls for TONS of butter).  The cookies tasted like flour so I decided to try again using real butter. WOW!  What a difference.  100% better!  I made balls, pressed and put a chocolate kiss in the middle of some and strawberry preserves in the middle of others.  AWESOME!

Do not let the lack of eggs deter you from making these luscious cookies.  My advice would be while preparing the dough, treat it gently - cream your eggs and sugar, but stir your flour in a with a wooden spoon.  I believe overmixing could cause a tough cookie.  I rolled and cut some cookies, and some I rolled into balls and pressed them flat.  Rolling/cutting worked better for me. (Sprinkled powdered sugar on my board and roller to prevent sticking)  Also, I found that the tube end of a "wonder cup" (push thru measuring cup) works well as a cookie cutter.  Drizzled a little chocolate over them and they were Delicious!

It's a basic recipe, but resulting in literally melt-in-your-mouth cookies.  I jazzed it up a bit by mixing in about a 1/2 cup of orange zest and a 1/2 cup of chopped dried cranberries. 

So good!!!

I added 3/4 cup of chopped dried cranberries, 1/2 cup each of crushed walnuts and brazil nuts....YUMMMY!  They stayed soft and are a HUGE hit with the family.  Easy to roll out and cut w/cookie cutters.  This one is definately a keeper!

Not to bad,very quick and easy. i did  make some subsitutions like i use the smart balance spread and i used one cup of whole wheat flour. The recipe made 6 dozen rather than 2, which was ok because my family liked them. :) i will be making these again

I used margarine instead of butter and they turned out very well.  I didn't find the dough to be crumbly at all, as some other reviewers reported.  The cookies were light and melt in your mouth good.  I'll definitely make them again!

These were absolutely perfect.  I used a cookie gun.  I was worried about the reviews that mentioned the dough was crumbly.  It was, at first, but just get your hands in there and squeeze!  Happy Holidays All!

We really liked these.  They are extremely easy.  I used half sugar, half splenda, and used almond extract instead of vanilla (I just prefer it).  They won't last long here.

I just made these and made a mistake, that in my opinion, tasted pretty darn good!  I only added ONE cup of (chilled) butter.  When preparing this, all seemed normal with the only difference being, the texture was more dry, so I pressed the "dough" into a pan, firmly and baked them a tad longer (20 mins).  When removed from the oven, I cut them into squares and then let them cool.  They were not greasy... they were not floury tasting!

The dough is rather crumbly and more fit to make regular circular cookies than to use the dough to make cut-out cookies. But I used it to make cut-out cookies anyway. I sprinkled bits of flour in my hand and on the dough as I took it apart to make cookies and it came out really well! They taste really good but be careful when they're done. Leave them to cool for at least 5 minutes and then carefully take them off the cookie pan.. they break easily!

These cookies are great!  Very soft and yummy.  I did not have a cookie press so I  just rolled the dough into balls and then rolled the balls in sugar.   I pressed them out with my hands and voila!  These would be perfect for the holidays but I will make them any time of year.

I made these yummy cookies for a Christmas get together.  The cookies were so yummy, and had a yummy buttery taste to them.  Unfortunately my cookie press would not work with this recipe...Hmmm I guess I will have to get a new one.  So I made some of them into  thumbprint cookies with Strawberry Preserves,a nd the others I rolled in Red and Green Sugar.  I will definately make these again.

Made these yesterday, they're perfect!  With my cookie press, I ended up with 4 dozen cookies of different shapes.   The kids loved making them!  I left some "au naturel", some with chocolate threads, some with cherries and some with chocolate and cherries.  Everyone LOVED them.

This was excellent.  I'd made similar cookies before, but these are the best.  I only used 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and it was plenty.  Next time, I'll buy almond extract.  I also rolled them in balls and flattened them with a glass dipped in sugar.  Turned out great.

yummy cookies~ i succeeded the 1st time i made them.. i added chocolate rice to a portion, nuts to another, raisins to another..n they all came out very nice..with different tastes.. yeah, i kindof agree dat they are too sticky to mould, so i jus simply roll into balls and flatten them.

This is by far the best recipe I have seen for cookie press cookies, shortbread and butter cookies alike. They are very buttery but not too rich. And not floury at all! 
  I didn't change the recipe except I used almond extract instead of vanilla and they came out perfect. The 4 cups of flour was perfect also. I highly recommend this one!

These cookies were so easy to make and very good. I added a bit of colored sugar on top for decoration before I baked them. They turned out great.

These are pretty good.  They are crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside, but I thought they could have a little bit more flavor.  I drizzled butterscotch on top, and it tasted good overall =)

This is so yummy!  I didn't have a cookie press so I used a soup spoon and my hand, so mine weren't pretty but I was just making these for myself so I didn't care how they looked...  they are absolutely the best shortbread I've ever tasted!

We have made them twice already and they were eaten quickly by 3 adults! We don’t have a cookie press so we gently rolled the cookie dough and cut with cookie cutter.  We will definitely make them again. Sooooo delicious.

LOVE it!! I honestly have to wonder at the results that the " professional bakers " got.. I am NOT much of a Baker, dont have a cookie press & I didn't even have a full cup of sugar so I used 1/2 cup white & 1/2 cup brown.. I made little   balls, dusted the bottom of a drinking glass & smushed them.. they turned out EXACTLY how I wanted.. I will be using this recipe alot!! I got about 3 dozen .. thanx so much for posting it!

A cookie press isn't necessary for this recipe. I divided the dough in half, rolled it into logs, and placed in the fridge. After 30minutes it was still too soft. At the 2hr mark it was perfect for slicing into cookies.

This was an easy but very testy recipe. I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar. My shortbreads looked brown however, tested very very good. I looked at other reviews at first and made half a batch. Half a batch was plenty for us. Thanks for this useful recipe!

I made these as written so I can review this recipe. They turned out perfect. Those are the words of my sister who is here for Christmas and her favorite cookies are shortbread. I try and make her some every time she is here. I did not have a cookie machine. But I rolled them out and cut them to size. I will use this recipe again.

I do not know what I did wrong. I wonder if I did not cream the butter and sugar long enough as some cream 15-20 minutes.   I followed the recipe , however my dough would not come together.  So I grabbed a softened half stick of butter and threw it in the dough and continued to mix dough. Everything came together, used a cookie press successfully, baked great and tasted wonderful.  I rarely use recipes that do state the grams as I weigh all my ingredients.   A cup is not always a cup depending on who manufactured it, a gram is always a gram on an accurate scale. I have three sets of measuring cups and they  all weigh a cup different.

I had a really hard time keeping the dough together when I was rolling it out (making christmas cookie shapes). It was so crumbly and it was difficult to get it to stick together. I felt so frustrated!

First time to make Shortbread cookies & didn't want to ruin an entire batch of dough so I read a lot of the reviews; do's & dont's. 
First, if you are using this recipe to cut out larger holiday cookies, you will need to double the batch if you want nice thick ones.
I used salted butter & still had to add a little extra salt to get the desired flavor I wanted. In addition to the 2 tsp of vanilla, I added 1/4 tsp almond extract. I also added an 1/8 cup powdered sugar to enhance the flavor. 
Make sure you add the full 4 cups of flour! I reduced the flour by nearly 1/2 C at the advice of some reviews & my test cookie was flat & greasy.
Be care not to overcook! I cooked mine for 12 mins & they were too brown. 
Overall taste was great & just like I had imagined.

I was a little hesitant about these since I have not made these before and do not have a cookie press.  I decided to make a small batch to test these out. I made a 1/4th of the dough and it was the perfect amount!  I was able to roll the dough into a nice square log and cut slices for 1 dozen cookies.  They looked very nice - didn't crumble.  My husband said they tasted better then the ones he remembered his mom making when he was a young boy!  I will be making more!

Dont let the name fool you. These are not shortbread. These are the weirdest spritz cookies I've ever made. True shortbread is a chilled firm rollout dough made from three ingredients. These are too firm to be spritz either. I nearly broke my spritz gun on this dough.

Taste was a little bland (and yes I know that shortbread cookies aren't suppose to be real sweet) and they fell apart like in some of the reviews.  They did however melt in your mouth.

Super easy, delicate texture, but I did not sprinkle with sugar before baking, I think the recipe needs more sugar if you are not decorating them.

I wish I had taken a pic!  This  is for second time I made shortbread cookies for friends’ 50th I decided to make 50 cookies with some creativity, I wrote ‘50’ before putting them in oven. I had golden dust on hand the first time (last Oct) I baked them. Well, yes I was creative but the credit to the recipe... these were yummy too. Just remembered I had baked these for Christmas last year too.   Thank you for no fail cookies I changed NOTHING!

My family is Vegan so I used "I Can't Believe Its Not Butter-Vegan".
Dough was soft so I chilled for 15 minutes before I used my cookie press (1st time). 
Cookies came out very tasty. Next time I will add a little more vanilla and more sugar to give them even more flavor.

I added my own little spin to it and zested one large naval orange into the dough and then drizzled a lemon icing on top. They’re perfect! (Also, I halved the recipe and I got 2 bakers dozen with the cookies being about 2 inches in diameter.

This is a good basic shortbread cookie recipe. I did refrigerate the dough after it was all mixed. Then I rolled the dough and cut out cookies. I was using the shortbread cookies to decorate a ginger cake I made. I dipped the baked cookies half way in vanilla candiquick then sprinkled with raw sugar. Looks nice and I think I will try this with snowflakes.

Really simple cookie recipe. I didn’t have press so just put a spoon of batter on the cookie sheet. Only complain is the cookies were a little salty.. I would recommend using salt free , sweet butter :)

By far the best shortbread cookie recipe I've found.  My review is on this exact recipe.  Also, you can mix up the flavorings, such as lemon, almond, rum, just whatever you want. They will be delicious!  I don't use a cookie press, because i don't have one, and they are just too mess in my opinion. You won't regret making them. :)

These were quick, easy and tasty. I followed the recipe but didn't have a press so I made 1Tbs balls and gently pressed with the back of my measuring spoon. The dough was crumbly and held together well when compressed.

I was looking for a great shortbread cookie receipe to use for a base of my New York Style Cheesecake, made this and I do believe it will work out, I did make a change and used Gluten Free flour for the base , and the rest of the dough will be used to make the cookies for my grand son who is Gluten free 
Another change I did is to make this all Organic

Skip the Vanilla!!! almost just like Walker's Shortbread Cookies. YOU DON'T NEED A COOKIE PRESS. Roll out the dough and cut out circles or rectangles and punch little holes in with a fork. Bake and enjoy!!

I cut the recipe to a quarter, and added a little cinnamon; I also used a little light brown sugar to make up the sugar part.  The dough was very dry, so I added two teaspoons of milk.  The resulting cookies are delicious, but a little doughy.  I'd like them more crispy.  I love this as a basic recipe, and can enjoy adding different flavorings and even some fruits to it.  Would probably use a little less flour.

This is my go to shortbread recipe for a few years now! Recently I have found myself without ap flour and wondering if oat flour would work with this recipe. It does! Now, that said, it's a bit  trickier rolling out, my next batch I'm going to try a log roll and cut with a knife. But the taste is really good!! Even my pickier son requested me to make these cookies (with the oat flour) once we'd eaten them all up! Also, they really flatten out when in oven, so trying a short trip to fridge before baking this time!

Great tasting and baked beautifully.  Be aware that cookies spread quite a bit while baking so if you use a cookie cutter the shape won’t hold perfectly.

These are great! Make sure to use salted butter. I use natural lemon extract since we like it better that way.  Great traditional shortbread for using in a cookie press, making stamped cookies, making thumbprint cookies, or you can roll into logs, refrigerate and slice into round cookies. I only bake 8-10 minutes if and watch closely, removing if they start to brown. If I do refrigerated rounds they do take longer to bake.  Tip - if you are adding sprinkles or decorative sugar add before baking so it will stick.

Made 3 batches today with  2  11-yr old girls. Two batches we made with vanilla, one made with orange extract. Both turned out fabulously well. Such a simple recipe with perfect results.  We got about 85-95 cookies from 3 batches, kids were getting a little crazy trying to make bigger cookies. (we didn't use our press, just rolled into balls by hand.) Will definitely be making these again! Yum!

I did as one poster suggested and formed the dough into 4 rolls, wrapped in wax paper and refrigerated. I left them overnight. The next morning they were so easy to just slice with a knife and lay on the cookie sheet. I did make them a bit thick and baked them longer than suggested. I used salted butter that I let soften for several hours. I didn’t use any extra flour to roll them, just a clean surface and my hands. They turned out just fine. Very easy recipe.

Delicious! Made these following the recipe in my KitchenAid mixer.  Only adjustment was I did need to bake them for about 15 minutes total.  I tried rolling the dough out and cutting into squares as well as rolling into balls and pressing down with a fork.  Both ways turned out! I did make about 4 dozen regular sized cookies.  Nice and flaky, a traditional shortbread cookie.  Will make again.

Light and buttery just like they should be crisp at the edges a little bit of heaven. I used a 2oz scoop and got creative added maple sugar bits to the mix cut back on the white sugar a little to compensate. Gold sugar, toasted pecans and half a dark Belgian chocolate disk stuffed in the middle yummy

First time I have ever made shortbread and it turned out perfectly! I halved the recipe and it made about 22-23 cookies. I also added sweetened coconut flakes to half of the cookie dough and found that it added a bit more sweetness to the cookie. I think I prefer the coconut ones to the regular ones (I am more of a sweet tooth). I also added some milk chocolate chips to the top of the cookie after they were done baking and it made it even more delicious! (made a little imprint in the cookie before it went to the oven and after they came out I added about 5 chocolate chips and covered sheet with tinfoil to hold heat and melt chocolate). Definitely a recipe to hold on to. Enjoy baking!

Light and buttery! These cookies have a crispy bite to them with a flavor that reminds me of childhood. This recipe comes together quickly and easily. I use this dough with my cookie press. The dough does not clog the press and holds the desired shape through baking.

I love this simple recipe!  I use unsalted butter, and since I do not have a cookie press I roll them and then fork them like a peanut butter cookie.  I also put in milk chocolate chips.  I am curious to know what adding crushed up peppermint candy cane's along with the chocolate chips!

The only adjustment in the ingredients I made was to add 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate morsels   This was the 2nd time I made these.  They came out delicious and perfect both times.  I added the chocolate the 2nd time because my wife and I love chocolate.  Will make these again and again. Very easy and fast to make.

This was the first time I made cookies on my own, and even though these cookies tasted amazing with only a few ingredients, they spread out way to much. P.S. I didn't use a cookie press.

it was good but for those who think that there was to much flour..... use your common sense! it will obviously be too crumbly and there are not enough fluids to make it nice and pasty. you should reduce it to at least 2 1/2 cups then add more slowly enough for it to turn in to the dough. but try not to use 4 cups or else your cookies will be crumbly, and if you're making these for Christmas you will earn money:)  just to give it the spice for Christmas add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon or more but that's optional.

I added 1/8 cup of confectioner's sugar and they turned out really nicely, not very moist though. I might fiddle with the recipe a bit more when I make them again.

Loved it! And so did everyone else. I used SALTED butter and, as recommended by another reviewer, I separated the dough, rolled it up in wax paper and left it in the fridge for 30 minutes.  Took it out and sliced it into rounds.  Sprinkled AFTER baking with powdered sugar. And voila! Melt in your mouth Goodness!!

Just for us at home I spread the dough on buttered heavy foil, bake and score cut squares as soon as it is out of the oven. We don't care if they are pretty. They only last an hour.

DELICIOUS 
I replaced the sugar with 1 1/2 cups of splenda and it worked perfectly. I baked for about 17 minutes turning the pan around halfway through. I also chopped some chocolate covered cherries and folded them into the dough. Came out amazing.

This is not traditional Scottish shortbread just so you know. These are now my 89 year old dad's favorite treat and I make them every couple of weeks when I go spend a few days. My husband loves them, and they are fantastic with my tea. They bake in 17 minutes but all cookies seem to take longer in my oven. Like many other reviewers, I roll them into a log and slice them for baking. They are not too sweet but not bland because of the vanilla. Wonderful! Thanks for an easy cookie treat.

Just made them and they are so good! I used land o lakes spreadable butter and it was so much easier as I didn’t have to wait for it to soften yet it still had same buttery taste and consistency. I did roll batter into two rolls using Saran Wrap and put in fridge for an hour to harden then sliced them. I baked for 15 minutes and then dipped in chocolate ganache. These are my new go to cookies!

Ii thought these were great. I did not have a cookie press so I followed another reviewers suggestion of forming them into "logs", wrapped in parchment paper. I made the dough and formed it into 3 short cylinders and let it sit for 3 days in the fridge inside one large Ziploc bag. I could not get them to form into perfect circles, so I flattened the sides, removed the  parchment and sliced them into square/rectangular 1/2 inch thick cookies. I put the first batch in and had not let them come to room temp first so they took longer to cook. I had to flip them with a spatula about 10 minutes into baking and baked about another 5-7 minutes. The next pan, which had been prepared at the same time as the first pan, had warmed somewhat while the first batch was baking and they didn't take as long to cook, though I did flip some of them. I also added toasted pecans to the dough before refrigerating (whole pecans baked at 350 for about 5-7 minutes and then crumbled by hand after cooling, slightly shorter time if already chopped. It brings more of the pecan flavor out.). Overall, a great recipe for shortbread. Not too sweet.

These cookies were amazing! I will be making these again and again. I halved the recipe and it was perfect for the three of us with plenty left over. Not owning a cookie press, I formed balls of dough after chilling it in the refrigerator for 1/2 an hour. Near the end of the baking time, I used a spatula to slightly flatten the balls. These were even better the next morning! Thank you for this great recipe!

Not the slightest bit sandy, not a wee bit bland, not a wee bit any of the quasi-insulting terms I saw scattered about your reviews.  It strikes me, that all the complaints I'm reading are simply from folk that read the recipe wrong (i.e. butter), or just added something incorrectly.  I found the finished product to be delicate, and delicious.  Shortbread and cookies are NOT the same thing folks.  Shortbread is flour, butter, Vanilla, and sugar.  Period.  Its end result is MEANT to be delicate, meant to crumb between your teeth and into your mouth in a million tiny bits of deliciousness!  The quasi-"cookies" themselves are delicate, as they CAN easily shatter into a million bits if held too firmly, or set down too sharply.  Part of the skill of making shortbread is getting them whole into the oven, and out again without breaking.  :D  Oh!  Tidbit on the how to's... Gallon Ziplock (or uber cheap alternative brand name) - I cut the dough in half, and put each half into a ziplock.  Leaving a tiny bit open for air to escape, I simply roll the dough out until the same size as the bags, then close it up.  Those flattened bags go into the freezer to firm up.  Once ready, you can easily take a large flat knife and cut through the bag and dough to make any shapes you'd like.  I always use standard rectangles - Five rows top to bottom, and four the opposite way.  Hadn't ever tried this recipe before, but did today, and found it to work VERY nicely, though I did cook mine for 19 minutes

This easy little cookie has become a favorite of my friends and family.  I don’t even take the time to cut them out.  I half the dough onto a piece of parchment paper and shape it into a long roll.  I then put it in the freezer for a few mins while I’m washing up my mixing bowl.  I then take a knife and cut the roll into cookie fingers.  I bake for a little longer because we like them a little on the crispy side. YUMMY!

I followed the recipe with one addition, I added about a tbsp of ground ginger. Turned out great! I like chewy cookies and these were indeed that. I don't have a cookie press, so pressed out by hand into a sheet about 1/4" - 1/3" think and used a round cookie cutter. The only thing I would do differently next time is brush the tops with melted butter or an egg wash to promote browning. Will be making these again.

I followed the instructions in the AllRecipes magazine, which are slightly different and even easier.  Instead of using a cookie press, you spread the dough onto two 10x12 inch rectangles on two cookie sheets, then cut into rectangles with a flour-coated knife.  When they come out of the oven, you re-score them right away and then let them cool.  So easy!  No piping, just a big rectangle scored into small rectangular cookies. Once they've cooled, you dip them half-way into melted chocolate.  They are classy-looking and oh so good.  One of the most impressive and easiest cookies ever.  And they taste awesome!

Way too sweet! I threw them out. Nobody in my house could eat them without going into sugar shock. I needed them for alfajores which need to be spreaded with  dulce de leche. The second batch I made with only 1/4 cup 
sugar. That worked out fine. They are soft and have a nice texture.

I didn’t have a cookie press so I just dropped spoonfuls onto cookie sheet and pressed with fork. Pretty tasty and I’m hoping hubby got me a cookie press for Christmas. Don’t refrigerate for more than 30min. Tough to work with.

Delicious, tender, buttery, shortbread. I used 2 cups of corn starch and 2 cups of flour, instead of the full 4 cups of flour.  Makes them even silkier.  Yummy!!

These were fantastic, I used the same ingredients, but I whipped the butter for about 5 minutes and then with the butter and sugar another 5 minutes.  Added the flour mostly by hand, then split the dough in half and put in fridge covered in wax paper for about 5 min.  Took out and rolled between wax paper, and used cookie cutters.  Made over 6 dozen.  Will make them again.

Although I’m a long time cook and baker, this was my first time to make shortbread. These cookies are Devine! I pressed the dough into a cookie sheet and smoothed the top and scored the long shapes I wanted then baked until almost lightly brown then removed from pan and cut into the bars I wanted. I thinned out homemade strawberry preserves and brushed the tops with this. These are awesome melt in the mouth shortbread as good or better than i had in scotland this summer

This recipe was simple, and resulted in some of the best shortbread I have ever had! The only changes I made, was I stirred the batter by hand after I creamed the butter and sugar with a mixer. I also don't own a cookie press, so I rolled the batter into balls and pressed with a spoon. I got about 4 1/2 dozen cookies and drizzled white chocolate and sprinkles!

Good cookie! I rolled into a log and refrigerated overnight. Easy recipe to follow. Will be making a batch later using orange extract in place of vanilla.

So delicious! It's incredibly way to make! I dipped mine in white chocolate with red sugar to give it a subtle red-speckled look.

This recipe makes delicious shortbread but it would not go through my cookie press.  I used  cookie cutter instead.

These are very easy cookies to make, which normally would leave me reviewing with five stars. I would recommend using unsalted butter. My cookies turned out tasting very salty, since there's no salt in the dough, it must have came from the butter. To try to compensate for the salt, I rolled my cookies in colored sugar. They still taste salty to me, but I'm hoping others won't taste it as strongly.

Im an experienced baker and make macarons, bread, cookies, and fancy cakes weekly. I love shortbread cookies and wanted to take a break from the usual sugar cookies I make. This recipe was a disappointment. It came out beautiful but the taste was bland. I did chill the dough and rolled it out between two parchment paper. The dough was fairly easy to work with but the taste was so lacking I won’t be making this recipe again. I guess at least they look pretty? I agree with some of the other viewers. If you follow the recipe, you’ll get far more than two dozen. I halved the recipe and still had a little over two dozen.

It was so excessively buttery. The entire kitchen wreaked of butter and when they came out they were whiter than snow. You could also still smell the butter and they tasted like flour and butter mixed together it was awful. They also caused major stomach aches.

I made these yesterday for my daughter to try because she doesn't like store bought shortbread. This came out very good but I can't help feel that maybe something is missing. They were still very tasty and we enjoyed making them. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used unsalted butter and added a pinch of salt. Definitely needed another pinch of salt, but yummy taste and nice texture as both spritz cookies and rolled out cookies.

Nice flavour however, the cookies are VERY crumbly and don’t hold their form. Even after allowing to cool completely, they fell apart in hand.

This was fantastic! I added crushed, frozen raspberries and raspberry flavoring and it was so tasty. Then I drizzled chocolate on them and they just got better! It really makes a difference if you chill the dough in the fridge before cooking and this recipe really makes a TON of yummy cookies!

I skipped a step and still turned out great.

Forgot to cream the butter +sugar before adding flower.
I mixed the sugar and flower before adding butter.

In the end, it was fine.

Super simple to make. Cookies are delicious. The cookies take 21 minutes to bake no matter what size I make them. My oven time doesn't vary with other recipes, so it's definitely this recipe. I make the recipe exactly as written. This is my favorite go-to for basic yummy easy cookies!

These were great!  I got the butter creamed and realized I didn't  have vanilla extract so i substituted unsweetened vanilla almond milk and it actually turned out great!  I poured about 1/4 cup of almond milk and added a little extra flour. Will probably try again with actual vanilla soon but it was pretty good without!

These cookies are super yummy and easy to make! I rolled the dough into 4 logs, wrapped them in wax paper and put them in the fridge for about an hour. Then I sliced them into ~half inch circles to bake. I then dipped the finished cookies into dark chocolate (covering half of each cookie). My family and the ladies in my book club loved them! Super easy!

Press into a jelly roll pan and cut  1" x 3" rectangles before baking.  Cool and lift out carefully.  You can pick the top before baking too with a fork :)  Simple, simple!

Wow!!! So good. Made this recipe after my girls wanted the pre made sugar cookie dough in the refrigerator section and the store was sold out. Never again will I buy pre made!! We sprinkled a little sugar on the tops before baking and these cookies came out near perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I rolled them out and used a round cookie cutter.  The recipe made 2 dozen cookies that started from the 3" diameter cutter (rolled out relatively thin) - they did expand a bit (but not much).  They cooked up nicely and ended up being exactly the texture I wanted - strong enough to use in ice cream sandwiches, but not overly hard/crunchy (again, ice cream sandwiches).  They were buttery and sweet, with just the right amount of vanilla.

I'm not deducting a star for this, but I will say that they aren't the easiest to work with using a rolling pin.  I had to use a lot of flour to keep things from sticking. However, unlike another reviewer, I kept at it and managed to get my nice flat round cookies.

I rolled these out and cut with a round cookie cutter as I don't have a press. I made one batch as stated, I made a second batch with Heath pieces mixed in. I also dusted both batches with granulated sugar before baking. Delicious.

Like some others who didn't have a cookie press, I separated the dough into three logs and chilled for thirty min in freezer. I used two logs that made three dozen. I still have one log (1/3) of dough in freezer for later use. After removing chilled dough, I sliced into 1/4" slices, covered with waxed paper,  and pressed slightly with bottom of cup. Before baking I pressed almond slivers into tops of cookies and dusted with white powdered sugar. Also I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and sense I didn't have two cups of butter on hand, I used Imperial margarine. Good Cookie.

Super easy, only four ingredients, and they turned out delicious!! It makes wayyyyy more than it says the yield is, however, so bear that in mind. I made half a recipe and ended up with about 2 dozen 0.5x2 inch cookies.

I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored cisco and instead of using 1 cup sugar I used 1/2 brown sugar then I rolled them into balls made a well in them & added jams, jellys and dates. Sooooo good.

I cut the recipe in half and it made 2 dozen cookies. I made them into balls and took them out  after about 7 minutes, pressed the centers, and added a little strawberry jelly. I then baked them for an additional 8 minutes or so and they came out perfect!

The first time I made them they turned out absolutely perfect! However, the second time they did not do so well. I have made the conclusion was the fact that I used salted butter the first time, rather than unsalted the second time. Next time I will make sure I use salted butter!

Hard to go wrong with shortbread cookies.  I cut the sugar in half and add pecans or chopped walnuts for a bit of extra zing.

The BEST cookie I ever made. I divided the dough into two rolls, chilled and sliced. Perfect. Took a little longer to bake but could be my oven.
I added some lemon extract because my husband loves lemon and next time I will add even more. I think you could add any flavor.

We made these to give away as Christmas cookies and I'm sad to say that the first batch we made didn't make it to too many people. The second time around we used a bit of vanilla and cinnamon and they were fantastic!

I added chocolate kisses while cooling. They turned out great as I was nervous since the dough felt very dry and a little difficult to get into a ball. The recipe made three dozen. I definitely will make these again! Delicious !

Easy and tasty. Used salted butter and it was not too salty.  Made over 4 dozen 2 inch round cookies, the 2 dozen claimed by the recipe would be enormous.

I don't own a cookie press, so after mixing all together (and I mixed the sugar and butter until it was fluffy), I refrigerated the dough for about thirty minutes, rolled it in to small balls, and used a fork to smash them down. I then sprinkled colored sugar on each one before baking. Yum! These are awesome shortbread cookies. Like another reviewer stated, use good quality BUTTER because that's what you'll be tasting.

This was my first time to ever make this shortbread cookie.  I am a novice at baking but this was so easy and they were wonderful.  Just  sweet enough, very light and crispy.  I made 3 dozen with this recipe.  I didn't have a cookie press but used wax paper to roll the dough out to desired thickness.  I will make again!

I busted out the 1962 MIRRO cookie press that I'd scored at a garage sale and wanted to find a good shortbread recipe, recalling that as my favorite of my grandmother's spritz.   I intended to make a half batch, but lapsed into a full batch during the flour so had to cream more (melted) butter (and I used salted butter and didn't notice any problems)  and sugar to add in during the flour stage, and they still turned out great, I thought, for my first try at these vintage goodies. I froze half of the batch to make closer to Christmas and got 24 trees from the first half.  I found it helpful to express/ crank the dough fully on the cookie sheet then express a little more after lifting the press slightly off the cookie, as it make for a thicker cookie with nice ridges/ relief. I kind of like the first "mistakes", where it looks like the tree has branches atop branches.  These held their amazingly shape well in the oven.  They are a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth, not too sweet, perfect little spritz. What a great Christmas treat to bring grandma back around the table.

I added ground nuts to the dough.   If you do this, be sure to add enough flour. I subbed 1 cup of nuts for 1 cup of flour. They spread out a bit too much so not as pretty.

I would definitely make these again. I did not have a cookie press so rolled the dough into four logs and chilled them in parchment paper overnight. I cut them into 1/2 inch thick cookies and got 60 cookies out of the recipe. I drizzled chocolate over them for appearance and taste and then put them in the fridge to set the chocolate. Just be sure to roll the dough thoroughly as I ocassionally had minor holes in the centre of my logs.

Followed the recipe exactly. I like the taste, however the dough was really sticky for rolling and using cookie cutters. I didn't have a cookie press so i just rolled them, placed it on the baking sheet then flatten them using my finger.

Recipe made over 30 large cookies. The cookies seem like an average sugar cookie. They definitely taste good however they are just not the best shortbread cookies I've ever had. In my opinion, the texture of shortbread cookies should be a little more chewy and would melt more in your mouth.  I did not use a cookie press. The batter was crumby (like sand) until I used the heat of my hands to form a slab on my cutting board  to use cookie cutters. Really needed to heavily flour my prep surface. A rolling pin would not work as it would tear up the dough so I patted it into a thin slab. I used shaped cookie cutters to make shapes and added a piece of marricino  cherry to the center for holiday decoration. Although the recipe didn't say to spray the baking sheet with oil, I did and found it fairly easy to lift the delicate cookies off. The recipe made about 30 cookies for me and they do taste good.

The cookies turned out really delicate. I'm talking breaking apart when moving them to the cooling rack delicate. I had to add a tablespoon of honey to balance out the flour aftertaste. I am will definitely make these again.

It turned out pretty good!  It made more than a dozen cookies, though.  It would help though if you put the time for softening the butter in the microwave.

I love this simple recipe for shortbread cookies. Seriously one of my favorite cookies ever. I alsways use real butter when baking. I used salted butter for this recipe. I did have to add more flour than it called for, it was way too wet with the amount the recipe calls for. Adding in additional bits of flour at a time till I achieved the right consistency of the dough..also added a few tablespooons more sugar while trying to attain the correct dough consistency in order to avoid the cookie from losing sweetness due to the increase in flour. I also chilled the dough for 20 min prior to baking. (I do that most of the time with most all the cookies I bake especially ones that contain a high butter content. It helps them bake better and not flatten out so much. The longer you chill the better but I only chilled 20 min tonight.) also i don't own a press and never have never will. I roll them into balls with my hands then flatten slightly with a damp fork then dust with granulated sugar and bake. Also bake time for me was more like 15 min. They are so so buttery and perfect!!!!

Easy simple recipe and yummy too. Instead of using cookie press or even rolling out  ( old bakery trick) roll out dough into log then roll log in sugar or seasonal sprinkles refrigerate and slice into cookies and bake .....

No changes needed. I didn't even need a cookie press, I used cookie cutters! :) They turned out perfectly. I tried two batches one instantly in the oven after the dough was made and another after being chilled for 12+ hrs. Chilling the dough makes it much easier to shape / roll. For those who found it too greasy, try chilling it or adding the flour in cup by cup.

I've made it several times now and it always came out very good.  I  have made it as instructed and also with variations (e.g. adding different  combinations of nuts and flavors like cinnamon, cardamom, lemon zest, nutmeg)

I love shortbread cookies. This is a great, simple recipe. My dough came out a little too thick to go through a cookie press (I will back off the flour a little next time). I ended up using a cookie scoop and flattened them a little. They came out perfect.  Drizzled with a little dark chocolate. Started out with a half batch that made 2 dozen.

It was an easy recepie to make,but it tasted a bit flat. So I added vanilla extract on the second batch to make it flavorful. It turned out great! I also couldn't roll it out, so I made them into balls and flattened them out with my hands. Then I used a cup to make them rounder. Great recipe!

These were delicious! I halved the recipe but I'm not sure how many cookies it made cause we were just eating the dough plain. I did add powdered sugar and brown sugar, which improved the taste. Also a little extra vanilla. I didn't have a cookie press, but it worked fine to just roll them into balls.

I made this but, I switched the butter for coconut oil the white sugar for agave and added a cup of milk and two eggs then added flour as needed, the cookies came out delicious and flakey, my kids love em. I've made it the other way before and it didn't come out to my liking plus it was difficult to roll out with a rolling pin, making my adjustments help a lot.

These tasted very buttery and were a hit with my family. The dough was very fluffy though and I had issues getting it ti stick to the pan  out of my press. I eventually gave up and used the flat plate and cut the dough into strips.

I did not care for the heaviness of the cookie. I even tried to make them very thin and they still came out heavy. I won't make this recipe again.

Turned our really good.  I used unsalted ghee instead of butter.  My husband is a gluten-free guy, so used Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free baking flour.  Since I recently learned 1.25 cups baking flour is the substitute for 1 cup all-purpose flour, I made that substitution.  Used 1.5 tsp almond extract instead of vanilla (just because in the mood for almond).  I didn't have a press, so just molded into a roll inside of waxed paper.  Sat in fridge for 20 min while oven preheated.  Sliced about 1/4" thin with a filet knife.  Put on ungreased cookie sheets for 16 minutes at 350.  Immediately moved and cooled them on wire rack.  I like these cookies better AFTER they cooled than while hot.  Cool ones have the shortbread texture I love.  Hot ones - well, just kinda odd.  I did not add any extra sugar or salt and think the flavor is perfect.

This was a easy and cheap way for cookies, everything that you have everyday no needing to go buy a lot of other ingredients.  Read some of the reviews and added the brown sugar and confectioners sugar and they turned out fantastic.  Grandkids thought they were great considering they are not one of the most sweetest cookies out there.  Will definitely be making a lot more of these.  What a way to give the young ones a extra treat without excessive sugar  and without a lot of time involved.

I loved the easy recipe and directions! The only problem was that I didn't really like the taste of the cookies, but everybody else loved them so it's probably just me. I will definitely be making these again (for other people). Perfect for kids because of the easy recipe and being fun to decorate and shape. ??

FAfter mixing, make 2 balls dough and place onto 2 pieces of wax paper or foil, fold it over once, then hand roll it into a log. Freeze one log. Freeze working log for a short time. Remove from freezer. Here's the trick....SLICE the dough, and place on cookie sheet to bake. Eliminates stickiness!

I made these tonight and I was scared bc I have never used a cookie press before. I went and bought one and they are pretty easy to use and it was $19 at Bed Bath and Beyond. These cookies are absolutely fantastic and easy to make!! I LOVE short bread and just sprinkling a little sugar on them is enough for me. I dipped about a dozen in chocolate but prefer them without! If you don't have a cookie press, you should definitely refrigerate the dough for an hour or so otherwise it might be too sticky. Love them!

I made the dough, rolled it in wax paper, and refrigerated it for two days before baking.

This recipe turned out well but only because I modified it as I went along. 
I tasted the dough with each 1/2 cup of flour I added and I stopped at 2 1/2 cups - anymore than that would have left it as an over powering flour flavour. I then made a single cookie and baked it for 10 minutes to test if it would still turn out with less flour. Turned out great. Produced a soft well formed cookie.
Using the cookie press did not turn out - the dough just constantly oozed out of the press - I couldn't get a cookie to form nicely. Perhaps its my press or because I used less flour leaving the dough slightly stickier? 
I ended up rolling the dough into small balls and pressed them down with a fork to produce a lovely cookie. Everyone enjoyed the flavour. 
My advice - taste the dough as you go and decide how much flour will work for you!

Made this twice and both times there was nothing left of it. Wonderful recipe but the cookie press was hard on my hands. Hoping for Christmas that my family buys me an automatic press if they want more of these. I ended up having my husband do the pressing.

This was my first time ever making shortbread cookies. Admittedly I am a lazy cook so I'm drawn to recipes with 5 or less ingredients. Can I just say that this recipe is AMAZING!! Just like, if not better than, those I've purchased.  I didn't add anything since this was my first time. I don't own a cookie press so I rolled out the dough and used a cookie cutter (first time with that too).  Rolling and cutting was challenging but I did okay. This one will be saved as one of my favs.

Added 1/8-1/4 tsp almond extract for a better shortbread flavor, and used Salted butter specifically! I also recommend adding 1 cup mix-ins. Pecans are my favorite!

I halved all the ingredients and still was able to make about 30 medium size cookies. They tasted really good... melts in your mouth but a little bit buttery which i don't mind. Since I don't have a cookie press I made small balls and pressed them with my fingers on the baking tray and they came out really well. Try to make equal sized balls so they wont get burnt while the big ones are still baking. Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe...

Not nearly enough butter, I made about a dozen and they were much too flour-y. I added two more sticks of butter and they turned up much better. Butter is better!

Just made these and love this recipe! I read the reviews before making and made a couple worthwhile adjustments. First I quartered the recipe... and it still made 30 cookies!! (Admittedly, I prefer a smaller tea cookie size--about two inch diameter after cooking).

I definitely recommend using fancy butter and spooning your flour into the cup rather than just scooping. But no need to sift the flour IMO.  Finally, since I don't have a cookie press, so I rolled the cookies into a log with parchment paper and a ruler and cut it. Worked great! The cookies spread a little, though, so they're more ovals than round. Doesn't bother me, but if you care about presentation, keep that in mind.

This is a great base recipe and I can't wait to try variations on it. I have some lavender-infused sugar from a spice shop that I'll try next, and someday I'll use orange or almond extract in place of vanilla.

I really like this recipe it's very simple and kid friendly.  I used it to make christmas cookies with my little girls. I only gave 4 stars because it says to use a cookie  press but the dough was too sticky even after refrigerating. I use a cheap press 1st and when that didn't work I tried a better quality wilton press and got the same  results, a sticky mess. But the dough held up fine to a good old rolling pin and cookie cutters, I just floured the surfaces really well. It was more fun for the kids anyway. The taste is simple but good, next  time I may add a little more vanilla and maybe even a touch of almond extract. Really have to be exact with the baking time 1 min past the 12 min time made them a bit over done. Overall really nice recipe!  Thanks for sharing  !

First time making shortbread cookies.  So after combing recipes decided on this one.  Best ever!  I rolled and cut them instead of a press.   Turned out great!

The flavor is very nice and I slightly overbake them so they're nice an crisp instead of soft in the middle. I tried using a cookie press and the dough was too stiff. I took a small section of the dough and added a tsp of milk. this made the press work but the cookies came out a bit chewy in the middle (not the good kind of chewy). same when I tried adding a little bit of water. My cookie press was pretty much an the verge of breaking trying to squeeze out the dough. The dough is a bit fragile when rolling out. it cracks easily. my cookies turned out cute with the cookie cutters. nice a crisp edges.

Too much butter and they fell completely apart.. Tasted okay, but way too crumbly and too sweet, needed to be more airy and light in my opinion.

Although I have made shortbread cookies many times, I decided to try this recipe. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It did not state whether to use greased or ungreased sheets, so I opted for ungreased, and the cookies burned on the bottom well before being done. A reviewer has mentioned baking on parchment, which probably would have saved the day, but I didn't see it in time. One shouldn't have to read dozens of reviews  in addition to the recipe itself  before making a simple  recipe.

This recipe was so easy and turned out lots of pretty and yummy cookies. I put them in a pastry bag instead of a cookie press and piped them onto the sheet. I halved the recipe and it still made close to 3 dozen. Definitely going to make more and I'm going to dry adding in some other extract flavors.

Very easy to make, worked well with my cookie press, came out nice and light and the texture was nice, but they did taste like flour.  It also has a slight aftertaste of bitterness.

This is a yummy buttery cookie.  The more it cools the stronger the cookie becomes.  I pressed the whole batch of batter in to my 9 x 13 stoneware cookie sheet and cut them in to squares as soon as they came out of the oven.  Melt in your mouth!

I made the recipe as it was published in the magazine (dec/jan 2015). I just wanted to make some suggestions that I encountered for other bakers who may use that version.

In bar form, these cooked for about 15 minutes (and ended up being the size of the whole cookies sheet, not 10 x 12). They are also really crumbly when coming out of the oven, so after my first batch mostly fell apart, I left them to cool for 10 mins, not 5 and they were perfect.

My cut lines also disappeared on both batches along with my fork pokes, so they lost some of that traditional shortbread look.

Recipe is delicious, next time I think I'll try it in my cookie press as the author suggested! :)

I made these as-written the first time around, only swapping butter for vegan-butter to make these vegan. They were alright - but I agree with other posters who said this recipe was way too floury. On the second time around, I increased the sugar by a half of a cup and added more vanilla, still using the vegan butter. They were way more cookie-like this time! I also do not have a cookie press, so I rolled these into a log in wax paper and refrigerated them until they were firm for cutting.

Yum!
I followed the recipe but used pastry flour, Madagascar bourbon vanilla & other quality ingredients.  Chilled the dough for 30 before rolling out and using cookie cutters.
Great, easy recipe! Some had sprinkles, some had melted dark chocolate drizzled over them.

I actually used it as a crust for pies. It really works well for both pies and cheesecakes. I don't like a normal pie crust, and I added a tsp of amaretto and a tsp of pumpkin spice. It was a hit.

This is by far the BEST shortbread recipe I have found. Even better than the shortbread in Scotland! I use just a bit more vanilla because it gives it a better kick of flavor.

Great recipe. A bit crumbly so instead of dipping I "iced" half in chocolate (melted 1 cup semisweet chocolate chunks and 2 tsp butter).

I loved how it only contains 4 ingredients! However, it made way too much than what I expected and I didn't put them in the fridge before baking them... Which would explain why using a cookie cutter didn't work out for me. I also felt I needed to leave them in the oven longer than the 10-12 minutes but it's probably because my cookies were a bit thick. I'll definitely make them again in the future by making half the measurements listed and putting the dough in the fridge before making it and rolling it out. I would rate 5/5 if the instructions mentioned it makes a generous amount of cookies and it should be in the fridge before rolling out for best results.

I'm so mad I just wasted SO much butter. They were SO hard to roll out because the dough was so soft. I should have known that it was going to be a problem right there. So I use a gorgeous cookie cutter with a stamp and bake them, and about seventeen, minutes later they still are not brown. OH but they are super puffed up and have greatly expanded. Great. Cookie cutter is wasted. They don't even taste that good. If I needed go refrigerate they dough ( which I'm now freezing the cut cookies raw before baking the next sheet) then that needs to be in the FREAKING DIRECTIONS!!!

Thought the cookies were kinda dry and tasteless. Perhaps because I used margarine instead of butter.

made this with one minor adjustment: 3 cups flour and 1 cup cornstarch. cornstarch added a little extra creaminess and springiness. 

i split the dough up into 5 different chunks and used some food coloring, sprinkles, a fork, and the bottom of a glass to make different designs . really fun way to pass the afternoon!

Best shortbread cookies I have EVER made! I flattened dough on the counter and cut them out into shapes. They taste incredibly delicious... I think I just tasted a piece of heaven!

These are very good! It was a nice change from the typical "chocolate chip" cookies that my son always wants me to make! Good recipe, perfect amount of ingredients and texture when done!

These taste fantastic. I don't have a cookie press, so I just used my hands to make really tiny cookies that fit in the palm of my hand. 

My favorite shortbread cookies were always the ones with sugar crusted on top, so what I did on about half of mine was set them upside down in sugar to give them a nice crunchy sugar crust on top. 

These came out FLAWLESSLY! I'll have to experiment with other toppings on them. I can't wait!

I love this recipe! I have to say these cookies are now my favorite!! I did not do a cookie press. I just rolled them in a ball and flatten them. Definitely an amazing recipe!

We loved the taste very much, but agree a cookie press would help with the look!! We loved this recipe so much that I'm going to use it with fruit pizza for July 4th!

I did not like the flavor of these cookies at all.  Yes, it was very easy to make and I used a cookie press.  I was expecting something more rich and buttery like those Royal Dansk cookies that come in the blue tin. These were nothing like them. I'm disappointed; with so much butter that I used, I could have make a cake instead.

I adjusted the recipe since other reviewers said it made more than listed. The cookies came out very buttery, so no complaints with flavor! I had some trouble with the dough and cookie cutters. It would get soft very fast and I had to keep chilling the dough in the fridge to keep the shapes from tearing. Probably works better with a cookie press or  rolling it into a log to slice.

After reading a ton of reviews I was nervous to try these just because of the few bad reviews. .But those ppeople must have done something wrong cause they turned out great for me. I just doubled the vanilla and added a little more sugar for flavor. I bet they'd be great with icing! Too bad I don't have powdered sugar.

Great basic shortbread recipe! I halved the recipe and it still made over 2 dozen. I rolled and used cookie cutters since I have no press. Worked well, good consistency for rolling. Also rolled in some icing sugar to give a little more sweetness.

I also added nonpareils in christmas colours to add some festive-ness!

It tasted good but I think 4 cups is too much flour. It has a texture of a flour paste when soft.

Love these! Instead of vanilla, I used lemon extract and the zest of two lemons. It gave the cookies a wonderful aroma and just a hint of lemon taste.

Pretty good recipe :) although I halved them seeing as everyone said it made a lot of them and I think I needed to add more sugar..however.. I dipped some in chocolate and let them dry and some I put jelly on top! Very tasty! :)

I actually really liked this recipe, with very simple ingredients and even simpler instructions. I didn't have a cookie press, so I rolled out the dough on a floured surface and used cookie cutters. It worked perfectly! Also, I greased the pans just in case, although the dough itself was greasy. I had just taken the butter out of the fridge, and instead of letting it soften on its own, I melted 1 1/2 cups of butter. Great recipe for all levels of cooking!

Great flavor and melt in your mouth delicious.  You definitely need to chill the dough thoroughly before baking.  I didn't and they spread everywhere and were ugly, ugly, ugly.  Still tasty but not attractive at all.

Wonderful!! Easy peasy and perfect on the first try. I've never made shortbread before and will only ever use this recipe from here on out! I added about a quarter teaspoon extra vanilla because I love it, but no other changes. Also, got 6 dozen cookies out of my cookie press (oxo) and I halved the recipe. I'd say they were tablespoon amounts of cookie pre-baked. Definitely a keeper!

I love shortbread! This is a great recipe and so easy to make! I highly recommend the cookie press. They made the prettiest cookies, even without decoration. I'm doing these for my next holiday! They disappeared in a few hours at my house! They will get made again... maybe with decorations next time!

I LOVE this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the recipe in half  which was still probably more cookies than I needed in my house but that's another problem.

These cookies are fantastic. The recipe is simple, and easy to follow. I was able to switch out white flour with an unbleached and whole wheat mix, and still ended up with melt-in-your-mouth tasty cookies with a soft wonderful texture. Like many other I did not have a cookie press, so I rolled out little balls a la peanut butter cookies and just pushed them down with the fork. However, like others have said, this recipe makes more than 2 dozen cookies for sure. I got over three and was making some pretty hefty sized cookies.

Bought the Wilton cookie press 
just for this recipe and sadly it didn't work out :( 
Ended up rolling out the dough into logs and cutting into little cookies. I think the dough was too stiff for the press. It came out of the press but not cleanly onto the cookie sheet.  Just looked like sad, squished playdoh wah-wah. Perhaps my butter wasn't soft enough? I may try the recipe again since the cookies themselves tasted pretty good.

LOVE this recipe. Big hit at Christmas parties, bake sales, etc. Made an account just so I could comment and express my appreciation for this recipe. I like to add 3 tsp of vanilla, and then top with icing and sprinkles. The sprinkles can be changed depending on the holiday/occasion/preferences, etc.

I have been baking for years and this was the first time I have ever tried to make shortbread cookies. I really like shortbread and thought I would give it a go on making some. The first time, I did exactly as the recipe instructed, but the cookies had hardly any flavor at all. The second batch I added a BUNCH (3 teaspoons) more vanilla extract and they had a light vanilla flavor, finally. Other than the flavor, the cookies turned out just fine.

I've used this recipe about four times without a cookie press and it's worked wonderfully. I don't chill the dough, and I make sure the butter isn't completely at room temperature, so they roll out better. This time, I even added candy canes to the batter and it's turning out great!

Yummy and oh so easy!  I followed another bakers tip and rolled into logs, chilled, sliced and baked! Cutting with cookie cutters would have looked better but still looked good and tasted great!

Great recipe for "pure" shortbread.  I used lemon extract instead of vanilla and added the grated zest from one lemon.  I rolled them out and used cookie cutters.  Perfect Christmas cookies!

Awesome cookies. Followed exact recipe. Very easy and fast to make. Made 56 cookies. They were pretty sticky when rolling them out. Next time I will chill them for an hour and see if that helps.

We followed the recipe exactly and we got mediocre cookies. They hardly expanded/fluffed out which, I think, would've made them more aesthetically pleasing. The taste was decent at best. Still looking for that 5 star shortbread cookie recipe.

It was easy to make for a first time cookie baker. With a cookie press I made 60 cookies not 12 as the quantity called. This recipe could also use a little more sugar.

I got some good reviews from friends and family.  I get the whole cookie press concept because it is a wee bit crumbly but, I am not a seasoned baker and don't know if that's standard for shortbread.  Great recipe, thanks!

I make these but instead of using vanilla extract I use pecan and then cut the flour by half a cup and add crushed pecans. When baked you dip half the cookie in a Good quality melted chocolate chip. AMAZEING for cookie exchanges or just with a cup of coffee.

I found this recipe in one of my cookbooks and that recipe says to chill the dough for a couple hours. This will help with those people saying the dough is very sticky.

Delicious!  And if made with whole wheat flour, it makes wonderful digestive biscuits!  Again, I'll agree with a lot of other posters though in saying that this makes WAY more than the amount mentioned.  I used proper big shortbread presses, and still managed to get about 4-5 dozen out of the recipe!

So basic but so amazing!!! My kids love the frosted seasonal/holiday cookies they sell for 5 bucks at the coffee shop, so I decided to try making them at home. Those cookies are more like buttery shortbread than they are sugar cookies. This recipe turned out beautifully, I frosted them with lemon glaze frosting. The kids were thrilled! :)

This recipe is SO simple and SO good.  Flaky and buttery, perfection. I made these at christmas and again today for valentines day. However, I added a final step because I use cookie cutters.  I roll the dough into a ball and put it in saran wrap and into the fridge for about and hour.  Then take it out, kneed the dough and roll it out and use cookie cutters.

This was the first shortbread recipe I ever tried and one that I am going to keep forever!  What I like to add to the recipe is orange or lemon flavor - the juice and the zest from the rind. For Halloween I used this recipe to make those shortbread owls that's all aflutter on pintrest/internet - super big hit! For the holidays I used a cookie cutter to make star shapes, and after they finished baking I wrapped 5 cookies in colored cellophane and a ribbon to give as gifts to friends, family, and neighbors. 

Some lessons I learned from trying this recipe:
- I tried to make a vegan butter batch but that did not go well at all - they shriveled up and became super hard
- Using a cookie gun for this recipe is incredibly difficult - you have to work the dough a lot and make it more moist, which may or may not take away from the final shortbread texture. 
- Rolling out the dough and using a cookie cutter works better, but again, it takes some extra effort (and a lot of extra flour!)

These did stick to my cookie press, although it may have been that I greased my cookie sheets?  Other than that, these are very delicious!

The classic shortbread recipe! Just flour, butter, sugar and a bit of vanilla, just the way a shortbread should be. I got 4 dozen press cookies out of half of this recipe, and they were delicious and buttery.

I felt this recipe could have been a little sweeter. Lucky for me i was planning to decorate the cookies which added the sweetness that the recipe was missing. When I use this in future I will add more sugar but otherwise, once iced, melt in your mouth DELICIOUS! I will add that I'm new to the shortbread world and had hoped to use my new cookie cutters but the dough didn't hold up well enough for me to feel comfortable doing so. I have a portion of the batch currently cooling in the fridge (like other allrecipes for shortbread had suggested)and I'm hoping that will make it maleable enough to cut into.

So , so perfect!  We let the dough sit in the fridge to harden, then rolled and cut with cookie cutters and it worked out great!

Nice easy recipe.  This shortbread had a lovely flavour. I would use a little less flour next time, very minimal reduction. I didn't have a cookie press and made these with four tiny pairs of helping hands so I had the kids roll into balls and smuck down with forks. Worked fabulous. Highly recommend.

I have never made shortbread cookies before and OMG these where not only easy but so freaking good. I don't have a cookie press so instead I rolled into little balls,flatten them a wee bit and made a so called thumb print and filled with cherry pie filling. I will defo be making these again .. like tomorrow.

Followed the recipe to a "T", except that I don't have a cookie press.  So I did what a few others had stated and rolled the mixture into a "log", refrigerated then sliced and baked.  Just not my kind of shortbread cookie at all!  Very dry and almost crumbly.  The taste was okay, but I don't see myself using this recipe again.

My son has been hounding me to make a cookie he could fill with Nutella. I thought shortbread cookies would be good for a "sandwich" type cookie. This was my first time cooking shortbread cookies and they turned out great. I had no problem with rolling the dough and cutting with cookie cutters even without refrigerating first. Maybe some of the other reviewers did not follow the recipe close enough?

Not very good. To get even a slightly underdone cookie you need to flatten it out and bake it for 16 minutes or more. Mine were okay, my family said they were okay-good. I wouldn't probably make these again, unfortunately.

i did not have a cookie press, either, but i chilled them in freezer for about 20 minutes, then rolled them in balls and flattened on cookie sheet before baking.  afterwards, i covered them in melted chocolate and finely chopped walnuts.  the shortbread is so airy and soft it is like eating a cloud made from sugar and vanilla!

I loved this, it was fantastic. It was buttery and delectable, just like a short bread should be. I cut the recipe in half, and it still yielded more than a dozen, so the measurements are off. I added a pinch of my favorite instant coffee and they tasted great. I wanted to dip them in some chocolate, but I'm not sure they'll make it that long! ;-)  Thanks for a great recipe, this one is getting saved for sure!

Not impressed.  Made some slight alterations to a different batch and they came out pretty good.  However, I am giving it 3 stars based on the original recipe.  Would have gave it 2.5 if I could have.

Love love LOVE this recipe.  It is soooooo good.  The only change I made was to half the recipe.  The first time I made this cookies I stayed true to the recipe and it made about 4 dozen cookies that were a respectable size.

These shortbread are delish! I followed the recipe (just added in a pinch or so of salt). If people are having difficulty with this recipe I would think it is in the mixing! I used my mixer and mixed until I had a fluffy batter and then put the dough in the fridge.
The dough is delicate, but I just rolled it out on parchment paper, used some flour and a spatula! Worked great!
Don't make these if you are on a diet! I'm not usually a cookie monster but I can't stop eating them! Can't wait to experiment with them!

These cookies were so rich in flavor and taste and super easy to make. If I had known how easy these were to make I would have made long time ago instead of buying those Danish store bought ones in the tin. 

Just 4 simple ingredients!!

I will definitely be making these again!

I followed all instructions exactly and the ingredients exactly.  My cookies flattened and became one big liquid thing.  There must be something wrong either with the ratios or proportions.

I tried it with the cookie press and it required no refrigeration. Crisp, buttery, light! Perfection with such simple ingredients. Not floury at all like those recipes that call for icing or confectionery sugar. Bake till its pale but slightly brown on the edges. If its brown all around, even the slightest brown in the center it will start to have a burnt taste. Yielded 140 Wilton cookie press cookies.

These cooked the way they were supposed to however they were very bland (maybe this is the way shortbread cookies are supposed to be?) I put chocolate frosting (made from the cocoa mix directions) on them and that helped but even the kids didn't like the blandness.

Very simple to make, tasty cookie.  I had a little trouble with my cookie press, so I chilled, rolled and cut into small hearts.  I used some for sandwich cookies - some with raspberry jam, some with some "failed" fudge.  Dusted with some powdered sugar, they were pretty as well.  These will go in my Christmas cookie collection.

These are really excellent! they are nice and crispy and sweet. Only thing that might make them better is maybe a little salt. I cut the recipe into fourths and it still made a good bit.

Absolutely amazing shortbread cookies!  I thought: "Surely this can't possibly turn out right!"  I cut the recipe in half, rolled them out, cut them with a cookie cutter and baked them on parchment paper on my cookie sheet.  Since my cookies sheets are insulated, it took longer for the cookies to brown on the edges but they turned out FABULOUS!!!  My family loved them and my husband immediately went out and got more butter so that I could start on another batch.  Unbelievably simple Sally...thanks for the great recipe!

My family loved these.  However, I only put 2 sticks of butter in (1 C total).  I noticed the dough was dry, figuring it was our high altitude or something.  So, I put in about 1/4 c of buttermilk.  They turned out fabulous!

perfecto!!!! I've been trying to get this recipe right for years.  I left out the vanilla and i LOVE it!!!!! I baked them at 325 with a pan underneath to slow the browning.  They were crispy and buttery.

Absolutely delicious! And so quick and easy to make too. I made a half batch and that gave me plenty. Next time I wanna try almond extract and maybe even butter extract.

This dough is awesome, my niece is allergic to just about everything (she's 2) but I want her to have the same memories of baking at Christmas that I do from when I was a kid, so I was looking for something we could make for fun. I decided on these and so glad I did. The dough is perfect for shaped cookies! We even made a snowman complete with a broom, and you could still tell what it was when it was baked, plus, she LOVED the cookies! Thanks so much for this recipe.

These were REALLY good. My mom doesn't like them for some reason, but my family loves them! I don't have a cookie press so I just rolled them into small balls for the first time I made them. The next few times, also just rolled into balls. The most recent time though, (christmas), I put them in cookie cutters (took me a while, but was worth it). I made them all pretty trees and snowman and christmasy shapes and put icing, and they looked AMAZING and still tasted good after a week! Thanks!

There were okay... They worked great in my new wilton press. I wish they tasted better. I can't explain it, maybe too butter or flour. I will try to find another recipe that I like.

These were very good and very easy. Everyone loved them. i added some cocoa to it to make it a little bit different. I thought it was a little bit crumbly dough but maybe thats just how shortbread cookies are...

Very easy!  I got about 5 1/2 dozes out of these.  I don't have a press, so I rolled them into a ball and then flattened them just a bit with two fingers and sprinkled a bit of colored sugar on each.  My family really liked them and described them as very "rich".  They were a bit dry (not a bad thing in my book) so a nice cold drink will go great with them!

Absolutely wonderful cookie! I rolled and cut into Christmas shapes and ended up with nearly 6 dozen cookies. I took these to work (some plain, some with Sugar Cookie Frosting found on this site) and they went quick! I've been directing people to this recipe ever since. I've made many other shortbread cookies and none tasted nearly as good. This is my go-to recipe any time I need a cookie to decorate.

This is a PERFECT shortbread cookie.  I didn't use my cookie press this time just rolled the dough into logs and shaped them ractangles, then sliced.  I sprinkled some cookies with colored sugar, iced some and put ground nuts on others.  Very easy and a lot of bang for your buck.  The recipe resulted in about 4 dozen 1" cookies.

Great base recipe for shortbread cookies. I added chopped candy cane and about 3/4 of a bag of mini Tollhouse morsels. I then dipped one side of cookies in egg white and granulated sugar, then baked em. Yummy. Very rich.

I've never made a decent cookie in my life, but there a great!!  I can't stay away from them.  Some reviewers mentioned they are dry, so I tried half with vanilla and half with lemon extract.  The vanilla was better by far.  I had forgotten to leave out the butter to soften and microwaved it too long, so it was pretty in a semi solid state.  This went into the batch with vanilla.  The batter remained moist, unlike the other batch, and was easy to work with.  I don't have a cookie press, so I formed a ball and pressed them with the bottom of a glass.  I'm making more this weekend, it was fun and easy.  I finally have a Christmas Cookie to add to my recipe box - thanks for sharing.

These are great. I added pieces of crystalized ginger, amazing. I substituted lemon extract for the vanilla in another batch. Quite nice.

These were awesome... I cut small circles and after baking, spread 1/2 teaspoon of jam on each and covered with another. After these had set I drizzled melted chocolate on the entire thing. I used milk chocolate for the ones filled with cherry jam, and dark chocolate for those filled with raspberry. Yum! Somewhat time consuming, but very easy.

Turned out delish! Found it a little dry so I added a little more butter to hold it all together. Will make again for sure!

Absolutely fabulous. My roommates and I can't stop eating them. I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and since I didn't have a press, I flattened them out after dipping the tops in cinnamon sugar. Next time, I'm making thumbprint cookies!

Yummy cookies!!  Refrigerated left over dough and it is hard as cold butter:)  Set out to see if it will soften.  Hopefully we will have some more cookies tonight.

These were so easy and so good.  They reminded me of Grandma, she always had a package of short-bread cookies in the drawer.  I didn't use a cookie press, just rolled a tsp amount and pressed it down on the cookie sheet.  Frosted with buttercream frosting and they were melt-in-your-mouth delish.

Nice taste but not sweet enough...it was more "floury" as others said. I was looking for a good recipe for a cookie press but this was too dense. I'll stick to the recipe on the back of my cornstarch box if I want shortbread...

I added nutmeg to some, and lemon zest to the other half. They were best dipped in chocolate. I melted chocolate and then let it cool, and it became an interesting frosting. If you cook them just a bit under, they are soft, and just a bit over and they are crunchy, good both ways.

This is a wonderful recipe. The cookies are rich and buttery, with a nice balanced texture.  I must agree with some of the other reviewers about the yield on this recipe. I ended up with about 7 dozen cookies from this recipe (about 1.5" sq.) - a far cry more than the 2 dozen the recipe states. I am going to be giving some away to the neighbors!

After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to a great cookie.  Unfortunately, I found the dough difficult to use in a cookie press.  I ended up adding some liquid (1/8 - 1/4 cup of milk) which helped work in the cookie press.  I was hoping for a cookie that tasted more like a Lorna Doone, but was disappointed.  These cookie are very bland by themselves.  I drizzled them with melted chocolate which did help.  I liked the firm texture though and may try amending the recipe to my liking in the future.

Crisp and buttery - I made almond and lemon flavored too, with great results. I rolled the dough into balls and flattened with the floured bottom of a glass. I made 3 dozen cookies with a 6-serving recipe.

These cookies definitely were melt-in-your-mouth but were slightly difficult to bake. Just remember to remove them from the oven when the edges are beginning to brown/toast.  This was the 1st shortbread I have ever made, and I'm guessing that there was just something missing.

These are awesome cookies. I rolled the dough into two logs and cut into rounds to bake as another person mentioned, and they turned out awesome. The dough even freezes great, just let the dough thaw a bit before slicing. Oh and we added finely chopped pecans...they turned out like pecan sandies cookies! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I don't know what went wrong, especialy with all the great reviews.  But, these cookies just didn't turn out great.  I didn't have a cookies press so I just formed them into balls, but, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies were sort of hard and just not that tasty.  Sorry, I'll go back to my original shortbread recipe.

These did not turn out very good at all. First, they would not go through the cookie press very well, so I decided to try to roll them out and make traditional rectangular shortbread. This did not work well either. So, I simply formed them into the shape and baked. They tasted okay, but did not remind me much of the shortbread I had while in Scotland. I don't think I will try this one again.

Yummy!! These cookies are great. I don't have a cookie press so I just formed little balls and flattened them on the cookie sheet. My cookies took much longer to cook, about 15-20 mins. Not sure if my oven is off or what,but I cooked them until I saw the edges begin to brown. They make about 4 dozen cookies. Second time I made them I used lemon extract instead of vanilla, gave them really nice flavor.

I was really looking forward to these cookies but found them to be so bland.  I am not into super sweet, but had hoped that they would be like shortbread that I had eaten before (like Walkers).  Both my husband and I agree, these need more sugar.

An amazing easy recipe that my 10 yr old daughter followed and she made some delicious cookies. She rolled them out and used cookie cutters and placed candied cherries on the top. Wonderful melt in your mouth goodness!!

Maybe it was my ingredients; my cookies came out beautiful but tasted like raw butter.  I followed the recipe exactly and am very disappointed in my results.

The power went out while I was making these thanks to a tropical storm.  I had to finish up by candlelight and they still tasted great :)  I chose to frost mine with some chocolate icing.

These were so easy to make and tasted similar to girl scout shortbread cookies!

I dont have a cookie press, so I rolled it into a log and put it in the fridge for about an hr and so. I couldnt wait to bake them so i took them out around an hr later. I sliced them at about half inch thickness each and shaped them into circles. Baked for about 11 min.

This is a great cookie! I realized the recipe is basically the same as one I make every xmas, however, it calls to put choc. chips and walnuts in and then you dip them in powdered sugar and dip one end into melted chocolate. Very rich but very good! They are better if kept in the fridge if made this way.  However, they are a good shortbread cookie just made as it is. My recipe calls to put 4 TBLS of cold water in it when you have creamed the butter and sugar, vanilla etc. Not sure as that makes any difference in the final cookie or not. Might be a bit more flaky.

This is definitely a keeper recipe!!  I made half the recipe since I thought it would be too much.  I used a cookie press and my kids decorated it with icing.  It was gobbled up as it was decorated.  Thanks!

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe but my cookies tasted like flour. I even tried adding more sugar and vanilla and it didn't seem to help much.

I have been looking for awhile for that "perfect" shortbread cookie recipe, and these came pretty close.  I didn't bother with a cookie press since they were just for me and my hubby.  Just rolled the dough in balls and flattened slightly.  The dough is easy to work with, so if I make them again, I will go ahead and use a cookie press.

These are very sweet.  If I made them again I would probably due 3/4 or 1/2 the sugar.  But they were quite good, and very easy.

These are excellent cookies but I got about 56 small cookies instead of the 12 stated by the recipe.  They're easy to make and delicious so they'll be among the first recipes I'll reach for when bringing something sweet.

I liked how these cookies tasted (although I was amazed at the volume of butter once I realized how much it called for); my husband wasn't as thrilled.  But I am still glad I tried this one!  I'm keeping it for the future!

I halved this recipe and used a little mint in them for some holiday flavor and dipped them in dark chocolate. Very good but a little to fragile. I will try it one more time and play with the oven temp and bake time.

Great flavor.  I made with my niece and nepphew and we ate as much dough as we did baked cookies.  They were a little hard to get out of my press, but the flavor was wonderful so that made up for it!

Delicious cookies. Taste just like other good shortbread I've had. I'd definitely make this again, and I'll probably serve it to guests with tea or just as an easy-to-make dessert.

I have been looking for a shortbread cookie recipe since I had some wonderful homemade shortbread in europe, and this recipe is quite good.  It has a good buttery yet sweet flavor and a nice texture, however it seemed to be missing something; i don't know if it was a lack of salt or something slightly off in texture, but it wasn't quite what i was expecting.  Nonetheless, they were very good cookies and came out well.
