This was surprisingly good and easy to make. I usually use butter for garlic bread but the olive oil had a nice light flavor.

Yummy! Of course, we like garlic anything! Sometimes we sub butter for oil. Also, I like to add a sprinkle of garlic salt.

Granted, I did not use the Sara Lee bread the recipe called for (I used a french baugette), I like butter rather than olive oil for garlic bread. But this was good!
