"This is a great bean soup
recipe.  Will make again.
Although had to add a little bit
more spices at the end, it still
was wonderful."

AWESOME.  We put the beans, ham, and onion in the slow cooker for 8 hours and mixed in the soup and cheese about 20 minutes before serving.  Didn't even get any to freeze

I added some diced green peppers and some cooked rattlesnake meat and this was a big hit.  Everyone wanted seconds and even thirds!

Without a doubt this is the best bean (soup) we have ever had.  Definitely soak the beans overnight or at least all day.  I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and 1 pound of soaked beans.  I put that on the stove and brought them to a boil and then turned them down to a simmer.  About an hour later, I added my onions and ham...maybe about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of ham (what was left from easter after sandwiches).  Returned to a simmer until done...about another 1 1/2 hours.  I then added 2 cans of the soup and 8 ounces of Velveeta and about 1 1/2 cups more chicken broth for the soupiness we like.  It was amazing.  I am sure it would be good just as written...just thought I'd share what had my family saying "OMG that was good" all evening.

VERY easy and great for holiday leftovers. I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the fake cheese and it was spectacular! Super yummy with sliced ciabatta bread, or italian bread.

This is a keeper.  Family loved it.  Even the kids.  I added Italian seasoning and lots of garlic and garlic salt.  I made this in the slow cooker.

Great meal and other than the ham, pretty inexpensive to make - I had it cooking all day and put in the crock pot with the cheese and soup for several hours.  (good with ketchup and hot sauce added per bowl too!)

This was so good, and got better the next day! I cut the recipe in half, but that was the only change.  I soaked and par-cooked the beans, then loaded everything into a crockpot on high for 5 hours. Put in the soup and cheese with a half hour left. Perfect!

My bean haters liked this one. I used a pressure cooker to cook the beans and onions, then added the rest of the ingredients.  (stovetop style PC, 1# beans unsoaked beans in 5 cups water for 25 min. quick release)

This was a great hit for dinner. I had to add some milk and simmer a little longer but there were no leftovers. Served it over toasted bread and then tried it over steamed broccoli that was the side dish. Will make again and again!

Great recipe....I did use less water based on other reviews stating it was too watery and I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I still think I would use even less water next time to make it more creamy.  I also used 1 cup of celery instead of 1/2 stalk and added the ham drippings/glaze from the ham that I used for the recipe.  Really added fantastic flavor to the stock.

This is a keeper.  Made it in the crockpot.  Added celery and garlic salt.  Went light on the ham.  The garlic salt added a lot.  Will definately be making this again.
