I was tired of tossing overripe bananas so I came on this site looking for a good recipe for banana bread. This one sounded easy & I really like the idea of the browned butter. That was last  night, thank God I had more bananas because we finished the loaf and I am now waiting for another to finish baking! The browning of the butter is essential...it smells so heavenly and tastes delicious... do NOT skip this step! The only thing I did differently is that I buttered my loaf pan and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the bottom and sides, makes it a little sweeter and gave it a little "crunch" on the ends. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.... I can hardly wait til the bananas over ripen again!

This was a great banana bread but I'm not sure browning the butter made the difference.  I think you could just add melted butter and pretty much get the same flavour. For the people who are having discrepancies with the cooking times and perhaps ending up with a dry loaf, please remember there are a variety of different materials used to make bread pans.  Anything from light silver colour to dark teflon to glass and now silicon.  Lighter coloured pans do not absorb the heat like a dark coloured pan.  So if you are using a dark colour, you may want to turn the heat down slightly and/or reduce the cooking time.  Teflon and silicon add a different texture to foods cooked in those pans again. (sides are often tough or rubbery).   My suggestion is to find as many light coloured cooking pans, cookie sheets and muffin tins as you can!  You will always end up with a more uniform product that doesn't cook on the outside faster than it does on the inside.  :)

very yummy! I made 3 loaves as I had 9 bananas to use up, mine baked in 50 minutes, I used baking powder for the soda as I am very sensitive to the taste, added cinnamon, the browned butter and brown sugar add a nice taste.

Stuck to recipe for bread except tripled it. Very good bread, not the strongest banana flavor though. Used the rest of the browned butter to make a simple cinnamon caramel glaze (pwd sugar, browned butter, cinnamon and nutmeg) which really added a nice flavor to the bread. Will make this recipe again though I'll probably put in extra bananas. My father says it's the best banana bread he's ever tasted in his life.

LOVE this recipe!  As always, with any banana bread recipe, I added one more banana than it calls for - the banana flavor is a little lighter, so if you are looking for a strong banana flavor this may not be the recipe for you, but we LOVE it.  Printed and saved!

This is a delicious banana bread, but I would have added the whole 1/2 cup of butter and not measured out only 1/3 or I would have added a bit of sour cream or applesauce. It was slightly dry. I baked it for 50 mins at 350, but I wouldn't have wanted to leave it in for less just to make sure the batter was cooked all the way through. I added 1 tsp salt but kept everything else the same as the recipe. The browned butter adds the delicious depth of flavor. Just fell a bit short of being the perfect recipe. I think I can work on it, though. This recipe has the possibility of being THE ONE.

This was very good banana bread, and the browned butter does add that little extra depth to the recipe.  The next time I make it I will add some chopped walnuts.  Following the recipe will give you a very nice breakfast bread!  Thanks, Chef V!

Browned butter really makes a difference!  Only used nutmeg and the flavor was fantastic.  Used the "leftover" butter to oil the pan and added sugar in the raw to make a nice crispy crust.

It lacked salt.   Next time I left out the nutmeg and cinnamon, used 1/4 cup of butter and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  It was perfect for our family.  I really loved the brown butter part.  I also added about 1/2 C. of pecans from my backyard.

The only thing I did differently was use a 1/4 cup of applesauce with 1/2tsp baking powder instead of 1 egg because I was out of eggs. Turned out delicious. Thank you!

I added chocolate chips and made a glaze from the left over butter.  My family LOVED this bread.  Now I have to make it all the time. 
 I didn't have any brown sugar so I used white sugar.  Next time I'll use brown sugar and it will probably be even better.

This is a delicious recipe but I added extra cinnamon, some raisins & walnuts which I toasted in the brown butter and brown sugar before adding them to the batter. I also added one more banana--mainly because I wanted to use all bananas that were too ripe to eat. I didn't have baking soda on hand but plenty of baking powder so I tripled the amount to substitute. It rose just fine, in fact it rose about 2 in. from the top.  The bread came out moist but not too gooey! About halfway through the baking time, I brushed on the remaining butter to give it a nice crispy top! It was delicious!!!!!!

I really like this recipe, I'm thinking if my bananas were more RIPE, the bread would be a little more sweeter.  Not over sweet,  but w/ the brown butter the natural sweetness  POPS! I will make this again

I love it!  I added the remaining browned butter over the top of the baked bread and it was delicious.  I kept the recipe simple this time, followed the exact instructions so I could enjoy it as is.  Next time I plan on adding walnuts and raisins.

The idea was good, it smelled AMAZING, but it came out really bland (despite the enormous amount of vanilla) I might try redoing this one with more sugar/banana and some salt. I like the idea someone else had posted, with making a browned butter glaze to go with it, something caramely would intensify the flavor. I  bet this would go nicely with a little jam or nutella too.

Loved the brown butter flavor, but like others, I felt the banana flavor was a bit lost. My loaf was dense but had a tender crumb, and was not dry thanks to careful watching at the end. I may add more banana next time and possibly some baking powder for a bit more loft.

I don't know if Browning the butter made that much difference. Maybe some salt would help. I used unsalted butter.

Browned butter gives it a nice aroma but a day and two later it doesn't taste any different on the taste buds than it would had you melted the butter instead. Speaking of, could've used the entire browned butter as it comes out rather crumbly, dense but not moist, and the baking soda pings through loudly (And I'm not sensitive to soda at all). Even using very ripe bananas didn't do much for depth of flavor or texture here, you'll need more than 3. The banana flavor is barely there and doesn't offer much like you'd expect in a BB. It also took longer to bake than stated. I would make this again but alter quite a few things, so as it stands it's definitely moderately good (not quite a 4): 3.5

BEST EVER BANANA BREAD. I THINK THE BROWNED BUTTER IS THE THING THAT SETS IT APART! I ADDED ABOUT 2/3 CUP CHOPPED WALNUTS BECAUSE WE LIKE NUTS BUT WOULD BE GREAT EVEN WITHOUT THEM.  I MADE A DOUBLE RECIPE AND IT TURNED OUT PERFECTLY!  
THANKS FOR THIS WINNER !!

Delicious banana bread recipe! I also love that it only cooks for 45 mins! Instead of nutmeg I added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I added choc chips. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Ps... I used the left over browned butter at lunch as a sauce for my pasta. Delicious!

Used all the butter, included more cinnamon & whole wheat flour. I also Ninja’d the bananas instead of mashing, which I also do for banana bread. YUM!

I always forget to set the butter out to get to room temp so this recipe  is perfect  for me.  It is more dense than most banana breads but the flavor is wonderful.  I tried substituting  coconut flour and it was too crumbly. Maybe I need to add an extra egg and beat them before adding. I'd like to know if anyone  else tried a gluten free version.

I LOVE this recipe! The only thing I did differently was add 1 1/2 teaspoons of both baking powder and soda as I had incorrectly read the recipe. Luckily my mistake did not change anything about the flavor! Absolutely delicious! I recommend a dab of peanut butter on top, too!

Made this yesterday and I have to say it is some of the best banana bread that I have ever had.  It was so moist and full of flavor.  Great any time of the day.

This was very good-The only change I made was the addition of mini chocolate chips. I really like the browned butter.  It did not have a strong banana flavor so you might want to add an extra banana. Everyone we shared with loved it. I will be making it again.

I followed the recipe omitting the optional nutmeg, adding one tsp of salt, and using the cinnamon + 1 tsp of sugar to coat the inside of the greased loaf pan, as someone had suggested. Browning the butter didn’t seem to make it any better over just melting it.   It turned out good, and it helped to avoid overmixing,  stirring by hand only until the flour just disappears.  This recipe has a very nice texture and mine was done ahead of expected time.

This was probably THE best banana bread I've made! I added chopped walnuts and took the suggestion in the video to use the remaining browned butter to coat the inside of the loaf pan. Great idea! I also added four bananas rather than the suggested three. Nice, moist, and tasty loaf bread.  I needed to bake almost an hour because the center was still not cooked after the suggested 45 minutes. My husband had a piece while it was still a bit warm and said he loved it.  A good way to use up over ripe bananas!

It is definitely heavier though the ingredients that I used were not as carefully measured as I would do at home since I did not have accurate measuring spoons. It did smell delicious while baking. My husband gives it a 7/10.

Loved this recipe. Made just a couple of changes, did not have any brown sugar so used all white sugar and added 1/2 tbs of molasses. Also we had 4 bananas to use up so took another reviewers suggestion and broiled them on each side to intensify the banana flavor. It's so much lighter than the typical dense banana bread. Been looking for the best banana bread recipe and this is it. Thanks!

I have made a few different recipes for banana bread and this by far is the best I have made!
Browning the butter is an awesome twist.
Plus I tried other reviews and buttered my pan and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on inside bottom. Wonderful finishing touch! My definite go to recipe

Very easy and consistent results every time. I like my bread a bit sweeter so I sprinkle dark brown sugar in top before baking. I also add a splash of banana extract to the butter. After cooking (before cooling) I pour the remaining butter over the top and let it soak in.

This is an amazing recipe!   The best, since I was not a fan of banana bread, this changed my view.   I used ground up oats instead of flour, used maple syrup instead of the sugars, and yes the melted butter MADE the recipe.  Also added chopped walnuts.   Made it 2 days in a row, as the first one went so quickly.  Thank you!!!   Would highly recommend this recipe!

I doubled the recipe, because we really love banana bread.  I have tried many banana bread recipes and this is my least favorite so far.  The one thing I like about this recipe is that it was a lighter texture than I usually find.  However, there was no flavor.  I don't understand it.  I even questioned my daughter afterward to make sure we hadn't forgotten to put in the cinnamon and nutmeg.  She was certain she had added it.  It is possible that we did not brown the butter enough, but I don't think I'll bother trying this one again.

So good! My husband loved it. I noticed 3 overripe bananas on the counter. I think he is leaving them there hoping I make another loaf as we finished the first one yesterday. Other than adding some chocolate chips followed the recipe.

I added 4 banana's instead of the 3 like many of the reviews suggested, I also used the entire 1/2 cup of the browned butter, baked at 325 because I use a dark pan and baked for only 40 minutes----It was dry, tasteless and had a very dense texture.  Not impressed and would not recommend.  There are far better recipes out there for bannana bread.

I live above 5,000' in a dry environment just for starters.  I always use organic unbleached white spelt flour instead of whole wheat when I bake, except for yeast breads which require a higher-gluten flour.  I also teach gluten-free cooking so can adapt this recipe and any other to g-f cooking principles.

I melted 1/3 cup as it doesn't make sense to melt 1/2 cup if you're only using the 1/3 cup, unless you're making ghee which is good for baking as it imparts a less dense finish.

It definitely needed salt, which I thought was odd that this ingredient was missing.  Next time I'll add 1/2 tsp sea salt.  The cinnamon and nutmeg gave a nice undertone of flavor and cinnamon is also good for regulating blood sugar as it slows the rate of absorption of sugar into the system.  It's also very warming and nice to use in winter dishes.

Usually w/a quick bread like this, I would use baking powder and baking soda, although the bread rose beautifully and was easy to cut after it cooled.  I always toast and then butter w/a sprinkle of cinnamon as it brings out more flavor in the bread.  I like the fact that there is not a huge amount of sugar in this recipe.

Another tip for those who said it didn't have as much banana flavor is to broil the bananas a few mins which caramelizes them somewhat.  It seems to impart a richer banana flavor.  I also use 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans. Unsweetened coconut flakes would be good too.  I think pumpkin seeds might be interesting to use, especially for t

The brown butter is delicious!  I did add about a 1/4 tsp salt (needs salt) and pecans.  I Also sprinkled cinnamon sugar around the greased pan, the brown butter with the crispy sugar coating is awesome!  this is a keeper.

My family liked it.  It's a nice change from my usual recipe.  It is moist and flavourful.  The browned butter is Ghee or clarified butter - which is what is used in indian cooking.  I never considered using ghee.  It's a nice touch.  I did add a 1/4 tsp of salt, just from experience and since I used unsalted butter.

The bread was dark in the middle. It did smell great, but flavor just wasn't what I'd anticipated.

Add salt! I thought it was odd it wasn't in the recipe, but figured it was because of the large amount of baking soda. Very disappointed.

I absolutely love using browned butter in recipes so I was really excited to try this one. Unfortunately the bread was just meh. The color of the loaf was good, but the flavor just fell short of what I was expecting.

Wasn't difficult to make. Tasted great. I think I'll add walnuts next time. Browned butter really did make it good.

My sons REALLY loved this.  And I got to use the Pi Pan that my brother got me for Christmas.  Because of the shape of the pan, I kept my eye on the bread while it was in the oven and it was done a bit early.  I hate to admit this, but we ate it all in one day.  So good!

I'm not a very experienced cook so I made the bread exactly as the recipe indicated, except I doubled the ingredients and made 2 loaves. It was delicious!  My son who has a very sophisticated palette loved it.  I didn't get the butter to "brown" because I dont think I used the right pot, but it didn't seem to matter.  Next time I'll add some crushed walnuts!

For high altitude (7000 ft), reduced baking powder to 1 tsp. For personal preference, reduced vanilla to 1 tsp and omitted nutmeg. Great texture and not overly-sweet as some recipes with a full cup of sugars can be, and loved the browned butter flavor!

This recipe sounded so good til I reached the part about the cinnamon & nutmeg.  I wasn't sure I'd like the addition of the two, and I was right.  Plus, mine came out a tad dry, too, but that's easily remedied by slathering on a ton of butter!  I will definitely make this again, but I will omit the cinnamon & nutmeg.

Very nice crispy crust, excellent flavor but just a wee bit dry.  Would another egg fix that?

This is my go to banana bread recipe. I'd heat up only enough butter to use rather than leaving the melted rest for later. I added a lot of cinnamon to it and only a little nutmeg. Definitely could add chocolate chips or some kinda dried fruits.

Absolutely wonderful bread, the browned butter is a crucial step, it gives the bread extra depth.  The cinnamon and nutmeg also add so much flavor to this very moist, flavorful bread.  I will not use any other banana bread recipe!

It was a really nice tasting bread.  The most important thing - the kids loved it.  Next time I may omit some of the cinnamon, perhaps I will be able to taste more banana flavour.

I made this...  and was leery as it had no sour cream or sour milk like every other recipe I've used.. but I was also desperate for a recipe since my mom sent home THREE  bunches of ripe bananas with me. 

It turned out really awesome, good texture, moist and lots of flavor.   I'll definitely use this recipe again, and am becoming a BIG fan of browning butter in various recipes.

It did smell heavenly while it baked, but it was much too dense, even for banana bread.

I made it gluten free by using cup 4 cup. I had 7 organic bananas which were tiny and equaled about 3 large. Definately a keeper!

This was a great recipe.  I added a big handful of cinnamon chips that I had in the freezer.  Just use the whole 1/2 of butter (after browning).  In addition, I used all brown sugar. Like most quick breads, it tastes much better after it has rested overnight.  The banana flavor intensifies.

I would not use the cinnamon and nutmeg next time. I lost the banana taste. I had really ripe bananas but could not enjoy it because of the spices. I used all the butter but not sure why they have you brown more than you need. Next time I would brown the 1/3 cup only.

Best banana bread recipe I've tried and I've tried a few! Easy to make and delicious flavor. I wouldn't change a thing. And what's better is if you look at the ingredients here versus other banana bread recipes, this is relatively light. Just bought more bananas at the store, as we went through the first loaf in 24 hours!

Very good banana bread recipe.  Loved the brown butter in it!  I used the entire 1/2 cup of browned butter and went with all brown sugar.  Smelled wonderful while baking and I like the extra depth of flavor the browned butter gives it!
