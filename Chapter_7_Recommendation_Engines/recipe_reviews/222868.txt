So thankful for this recipe!  it has all the same ingredients I use for a potato salad, but I have to make enough for a small wedding and was so unsure how to do that!

I have been eating, and making, this type of potato salad since I met my husband 44 years ago.  The only difference is we add some dill pickle juice to the mayonnaise mixture before adding it to the potatoes, eggs and green onions.  My mother-in-law always used 5 pounds of red potatoes, one dozen eggs and close to two bunches of green onions (green parts only).  The mayo-mustard, salt and pepper were never measured.   I followed your recipe using 5 pounds of potato but added a lot more mustard than listed (I USED TWO TABLESPOONS, AS WE LIKE IT TO HAVE SOME ZIP).  IT WAS FANTASTIC!  I CAN NOW DUPLICATE THE TASTE EVERY TIME.

OMG! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!! I made this for my daughter's graduation party - what a hit!!!! I got so many compliments! My hubby & father-in-law both said "it's better than grandma's"! I also added a little celery for a crunch & extra color...green onions are a must (added about 5-6, mostly the green ends)!! I didn't quite measure all the salt/pepper, also added a smidge more mustard because it seemed really mayo-ey when I tried the sauce. **to anyone who has a hard time cooking potatoes perfectly (I always made them too mushy), a trick my mother-in-law taught me is to boil them with the skins on just until a fork can penetrate without too much force, then put them in the fridge for a bit to cool, peel and dice. I am tossing any other potato salad recipes I have as I will use this one ALL the time.  ;o]

Even as a mustard style potato salad preferrer, I rate this mayo style pot. Salad an A+. I made this for a serving of 3. I just adjusted the serving size on the recipe, & cooked potatoes only for 12 min vs 20. It turned out delicious!

Great recipe!  So nice to have a decent and tasty potato salad without those offensive and improper pickles added.

made exactly how the recipe says.  I made it for a camping trip with a bunch of people and it was a hit.  Everyone asking for the recipe.  Now I still make it for my family and it will still be gone within a few days.  My husband likes to take it for his lunch as the main course.  LOL.  But every since I made this recipe I cannot stand store bought potato salad.  I have tried several different kinds and it always gets thrown away.

Nice basic recipe, I added twice the mustard and it could have used more in the dressing.  I also ended up adding some apple cider vinegar as it needed more zip. I added the green onion and celery chopped fine.   My mom always added sweet pickle relish and I added that to this.  Needs a bit more adjustment but it is a good starting point.

This was great!  Made one batch and put it in two bowls added 1 cup of celery to one and some celery salt instead of regular salt. Ran out of both both so good.

I made this dish but modified it for 10 people. I usually add vinegar to my potato salad, but this one tastes just as great with mustard. I added an additional 1/4 teaspoon for extra flavor. My parents loved it and want me to make it again for Thanksgiving!!

Needed a recipe for a crowd and this one tasted almost as good as my family recipe, had lots of compliments on it!  I did add dill Pickles and a little more mustard but it was good een without those additions.

I’ve made this twice and both times everyone commented on how delicious it was! Halved the recipe for approximately 12 people . I like getting the potatoes and eggs ready the day before,makes it so much easier to put together the day of. I added celery this last batch which was very nice also. Thanks for a great potato salad recipe,it’s a keeper

Yes.  I added celery and substituted half of the mayo with Henri's sweet and tangy salad dressing.  It was superb.

I wasn’t sure how much I needed for 40 people. Spot on. I did use dill relish. Such a personal preference.

Love, love this potato salad!  Only thing I changed was reducing half the salt and replacing it with celery salt, and adding sliced olives.

This is the perfect basic potato salad recipe. Just the way I like it. Be careful with the salt!
