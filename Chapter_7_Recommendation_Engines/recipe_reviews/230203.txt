You can call these cupcakes or muffins - we called them GOOD!  With or without the frosting, these are keepers!

I barely bake and I never leave reviews on this site, but this recipe is one of the best things I have ever made. The muffins are so moist and tasty. I love when I get a bite of the pecans.

Only change was to omit pecans as we don't  care for them. Also, next time I'll reduce the confectioners sugar to 3 cups, otherwise among the best I'v made and received many compliments from those for whom I made them at work.
