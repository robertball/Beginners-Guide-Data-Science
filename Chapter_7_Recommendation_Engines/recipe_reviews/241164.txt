I spread this on top of softened cream cheese and served it with pretzel chips. It was devoured and much enjoyed by all. I still get calls for the recipe.

This makes a lot, so I halved the recipie and still got a large bowl.  Only change I made was I left out the onion, as I hate onion.  And I used half pecans and half walnuts only because I never had enough pecans.  Everybody loved it!  Will make again, it has a nice texture and crunch to it.  I stirred the jalapeño jam into it as opposed to spreading on top.

Great Thanksgiving snack.  Severed with cream cheese and raspberry jalapeño as well as a much hotter pepper jelly. I like the extra heat but it’s not for everyone.  Made 1/2 the recipe for a family gathering and it was more than enough.

This was excellent, and very easy to make!  I used Raspberry Chipotle Jam.  Devoured by my family and friends on Thanksgiving.  Thank you!

This recipe sounded interesting, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I adjusted the serving size to 5 servings because pecans are so expensive up here and I wanted to try the recipe out before making a giant batch. I thought that the flavour of old cheddar cheese might be more apparent, but it wasn't. I make my own jalapeño pepper jelly so I used that instead of buying a jar of raspberry jalapeño jelly. I found that the taste improved after it sat in the fridge for 24 hours, but I wasn't compelled to eat it all up. Maybe if the cheese was doubled, or replaced with a very sharp cheddar, it might have a fuller flavour.
