This tasted really wonderful - but, the prawns are really unnecessary and the combination red wine/salmon made for a really unappetizing PURPLE sauce. The sauce would not thicken so I had to use a thickener. I would make this again but use a chablis or white wine rather than the red and certainly add maore mushrooms. Tasted great - looked bad.

This was a fairly easy recipe that ended up tasting great!  Next time I will try using a bit more garlic a serve the salmon on the side, rather than mixing it in.

This is probably one of the most unappetizing recipes I have tried of late.  It had a really strange taste and the sauce was bland and rather scant.  Definitely taking this off my list.

I omotted the tarragon as I can't stand it. Apart from adding a little more Parmesan, I made this pretty much as written. Turned out great. Thanks!

I used blush wine, snow peas instead of asparagus and  fromage frais instead of cream and it was just as delicious.

Made this because I had all the ingredients ( except the fresh mushrooms). I must say, I am impressed!  I will be making this again, next time with the mushrooms.

This was fantastic and the red wine really makes it.  I lightened this up significantly by using fat free half and half and whole wheat pasta.  However, I found that you lose an additional 30 calories per serving if you swap out 1/4 cup of the red wine for chicken broth.  I will try that next and hope that there is enough of the flavor from the red wine to carry the dish.  I also increased the prawns to 6, cut them in half and tossed them in with the salmon.  My kids even liked this!!

I used white wine instead of red, and added a splash of fresh lemon juice on the salmon. I only had frozen cooked shrimp, it was okay. At the end, I added fresh spinach and some pine nuts. We enjoyed it; the recipe was light unlike some pasta dishes with cream sauce. My husband said this is a keeper!

We actually used soymilk instead of cream & it was still tasty!  Maybe it's 5 stars w/the cream.

Full disclosure: Based on reviews and my dietary concerns, I used almond milk in place of cream, white wine in place of red, and 1 Tbl nutritional yeast in place of the cheese. I also skipped the mushrooms, adding more asparagus, and used a tsp of chicken bouillon paste to get more flavour and 2 Tbl of vegan butter. I found that it needed more sauce for the amount of noodles and it wasnâ€™t very thick however, that could have been due to my changes. The idea is fantastic and I will try it again with double the sauce. Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious, but would be much better with a dry white wine rather than red.  Used left-over Salmon from BBQ, regular raw shrimp (cooked with onion, etc.) and bow-tie pasta, so I'm an adapter... but still, it was very good.

Added some olives, replaced cream with sour cream, cooked the salmon instead of baking it. Was wonderful

I made this as directed in the recipe with no changes (we did use dehydrated mushrooms, but I wouldn't think that should change the overall taste).  Sadly we were not happy with the results. It was very bland.  It wasn't bad, there just wasn't any taste to it.  Definitely an odd color too when you use the red wine.  If you opt to try this dish, I'd definitely go for a white wine.  Might give the dish a little more bite too.

Quick and esay to prepare and the kids loved it, which is in itself amazing. I used spring onions instead of normal onions, white wine instead of red and I ommitted the asparagus simply because I was trying to use up what I already had. A lovely, delicate but very tasty meal. I will definitely be making again and again.

I followed the recipe to the letter and wasted a beautiful piece of salmon, prawns, and asparagus on this completely flavorless dish!  I cook a lot of pasta dishes, and this was one of the worst.  Don't waste your time, unless you like very bland food.
