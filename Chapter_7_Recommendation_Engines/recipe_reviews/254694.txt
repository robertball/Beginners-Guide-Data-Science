I will make this again as a regular side dish and not wait for holiday time. I couldn't find any Japanese eggplant but I bought a 1 lb small regular eggplant that worked just fine. I had all of the other ingredients. Didn't need to change a thing.

I added green olives, black calamata olives and whole baby onions.  I will make it again and my family loved it.  Also so good on angel hair pasta.

This dish is easy and delicious! I added some feta when the dish cooled slightly. I will definitely make it again!

I left out the capers because I'm not a big fan of them. I personally didn't like the combination of the acidic tomatoes with the cinnamon and allspice. I may try a different variation of this using beans or mushrooms instead of tomatoes.

I left out the allspice and cinnamon. Added 1/4 cup kalamata olives cut in half. Added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Omitted the capers and sugar  and added 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil. Delish!

I made this yesterday because I thought it looked good as I love eggplant.  I am not a fan of cinnamon in savory dishes so I cut that back to 1/8 tsp.  After letting it sit for 30 minutes I tasted it and was initially disappointed.  Too much vinegar, way too sweet, and the cinnamon and allspice were screaming! I decided to refrigerate it overnight and give it another chance while researching other recipes for caponata.  This morning I tasted it again and what  difference!  Wow!  I added the olives which another reviewer also did.  I probably will make this again but cut way back on the spice, sugar, and vinegar.  In my opinion I would like it better without tasting pickled.

This was very good! I served it with French bread as suggested. The only addition I made was adding 1/4cup of green olives.

Very delicious. I substituted chopped green olives for the capons, I also added soy beans to boost protein for a well-rounded vegetarian meal.

I've never had this before and so, I have no idea what it is supposed to taste like. I like it quite a bit, however I have been eating a big bowl of it LOL, until I read that it is a relish type dish. It passed my test.
