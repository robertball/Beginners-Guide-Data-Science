I submitted this recipe - they made an error in the amount of preserves needed. Technically it would be 12 tbsp (or 3/4 cup) but I usually use a liberal tsp so have a full jar on hand!
I also wanted to point out I added Before and After photos to show how much these cookies really spread out.
Try them, they're delicious!

OK, I had to say "this recipe was extremely hard to work with..dough needed more flour in order to roll out. Butttt, because I love working with dough, it was a fun challenge, and well worth it. Really good cookies and a great way to use up jam out of the fridge". Hubby loved the cookies and said it is a "must repeat recipe."
Finicky, but fun.

This is the exact same recipe that my mother-in-law used to make. These cookies are absolutely wonderful. This was such a special and beloved recipe, that my mother-in-law would not share it outside of the family. (I guess the cat is out of the bag now.) This recipe is perfect as is. No additional flour is needed, just a well floured board and delicate handling. Do not substitute cinnamon for the nutmeg. The nutmeg lends a wonderful flavor that compliments the strawberry filling nicely. They do spread a bit. I use probably closer to a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter. When first baked, these are a little crispy on the edges but if you freeze them in single layers separated by wax paper, they are nicely soft when defrosted. Wonderful, wonderful recipe!!!!!

I did not care for the dough (nutmeg) flavour at all in this recipe. It did not seem to suit the filling. I gave it 3 stars because with some changes this could be a really good recipe. Perhaps cinnamon instead of nutmeg? Or an apple type filling instead to better suit the nutmeg? I doubled the batch and only ended up baking 18 cookies after tasting them, throwing out the rest. I'm sorry, I don't like posting negative reviews :(

My family loves this recipe! It was handed down from my great grandmother and I have been making them for my family for 20 years. It is a little laborious but absolutely worth it.

I just used the cookie dough recipe because I lost the one my mom used every year to fill with mincemeat. It was so good. I buy the jar of mincemeat and add  orange zest, golden raisins, and minced dried apricots until it is a bit drier than the stuff straight from the jar. So Christmas-y! Everyone in the family likes these best of all Christmas cookies.
