DELISH!!  I have been making Pea Soup the same way for over 20 years and I have never ever "sweat" the onion, celery and garlic prior to adding the ingredients in the order of this recipe and I believe that THIS IS KEY to an AMAZING HAM & SPLIT PEA SOUP! I did a few things my old way such as simmered my ham bone for about an hour prior to starting the recipe.  I removed ham off of bone and used all the leftover ham that I had sliced from the previous "baked ham" dinner.  Instead of using chicken stock and water, I used the stock from the ham bone.  I added everything in the same order as Chef John, let simmer for a few hours and then added approx. 5 peeled, cubed potatos and 6 cut up carrots to the soup and let simmer another one to two hours longer.  I did simmer my soup on stovetop throughout the day for many hours (definitely stirring occasionaly).  My family from ages 9 - 55 LOVED LOVED this soup.  My husband stated that this was the ABSOLUTE BEST SPLIT PEA & HAM SOUP I have ever made.  Thank you for the added tips and directions on adding ingredients in a "different way"!  WOW, who would have known that it would make such A MAJOR DIFFERENCE!!  I can't wait to go home after work to eat some more of this GREAT SOUP!  BTW, I always double my recipe for my BIG EATIN FAMILY!!  I did save some of my ham stock to add to the "thickened" soup if needed. My family LOVES my cooking, but stated that "my" recipes have become even GREATER since I found CHEF JOHN. LOVE YOU XOXOXOXO

Try this with the addition of Masoor Dal (red, split lentils). The lentils tend to disintegrate and give the soup a thickness that's quite appealing.

I'd give this soup 100 stars if I could!!  I found Chef John's recipe on Foodwishes.com and made it at least 5 times now.  Even when I double the recipe it doesn't hang around long enough for me to get my fill and I crave it until I make more.  Works well either on the stove top as stated, or in the crock pot (do step one as stated, then throw it all in the crock pot on low for about 8 hours).  Simply delicious!!

Amazing, I've never made split pea soup. I added a little veg oil instead of butter. I did cook the diced onions and diced celery until it was translucent. I did add green onions as well. Then added left over ham from Thanksgiving from Logan Farms and also the Sausage from Bone Daddy's. I stirred for a few. Then added the split peas stirred it infor a couple of minutes before I added the Chicken Stock. I covered all with the chicken stock. Then a pinch of salt and pepper. Boiled it for 45 min. Stirred it continusly.  Then lowered temp to simmer the rest for an hour and 15mins. My husband couldnt get enough of it. Its was incredidble. Thank you

A Keeper! I enjoy split pea soup very much. I thought this was the best I've ever had. My wife who is not a soup fan at all (any kind of soup) found this delicious. The flavors really were as Chef John described, the smokey salty ham flavor married with the slightly sweat pea flavor. I guess the key is the "sweating" of the onions, garlic and celery in the butter, because I've made split pea soup many times and its never tasted nearly this good. I made a few minor alterations because of what I had on hand and because of what I needed to use up. I don't think these added or subtracted from the basic recipe, I'm just listing them here fwiw: (1) I used 48 oz turkey stock (instead of chicken stock.) and about 8 oz of water. (2) Added 2 small russett potatoes diced small (left skin on) and (3) about 8 baby carrots sliced about 1/8 inch. I placed it all in the slow cooker (added the butter, onions, garlic, celery after "sweating" them on the stove in a pan) and 10 hours later, the most delicious split pea soup I've ever eaten.

Just made this for dinner, and it's a keeper (literally, too - it made a whole lot of soup! More than the 8 serving stated). I followed the recipe almost exactly, only changing up 2 things. I added 4 cooked and chopped slices of bacon that I had leftover from breaky, and I seasoned with a couple pinches of cumin because I think it adds a little something different. Great recipe!

Oh my gosh! I need another stomach to hold all the soup I wish I could eat! I needed a split pea sou recipe that did not call for a ham hock or bone because I only had some ham frozen leftover... This is a great simple recipe that is so flexible. I had no bay leaves, and I prefer to use olive oil for sauteing... I also added two chopped carrots to the recipe. And just for kicks and giggles, I added about 3/4 cup pinot grigio in the last 30 minutes. It almost doesn't matter what you do to this recipe, as long as you have a pound of ham, a pound of peas, and some broth, you will be happy. If my stomach was not a finite vessel, I would have eaten the whole pot by now!

This will be MY split pea soup recipe forever. I have made split pea soup many times, but this is the KEEPER recipe. I started out with a ham bone and simmered it with the split peas, ham, chicken broth, water, and bay leaf while I chopped and sauteed the vegetables.  I used canola oil instead of the butter.  I also added chopped carrots and sauteed them with the onion, garlic and celery.  Then I added the sauteed vegetables to the ham bone broth. I did cook the split peas and ham bone longer than 1 hour 15 minutes, but total time from start to finish was 2 hours as shown above.

Made this soup today (didn't have any celery and I added 1 cut up carrot) and it's probably the best split pea soup I've ever made or tasted!  After I cooked the onion and garlic in my Le Creuset french oven, I added the rest of the ingredients and popped it in a 350 oven for 2 1/2 hours.  Turned out just perfect.

This was one of the best pea soups that I have ever made.  I used two smoked ham hocks and got lots of tender meat off of them.  Used a bit more liquid to cover them, so thickened the soup at the end with some dried potato flakes.  Worked great.  This will be my base recipe from here on.

THE best. I've been making this every other week for the last three or four months. The only things I do differently is to add a couple of sachets of jamon bouillon powder, and I omit the celery if I don't have any. Even though Husband is firmly in the 'I hate in when my wife makes soup for dinner' camp, he has NO problem with this one. Serve it with some homemade crusty bread. Delicious!

Made this as a favor for a friend and he gave me a high compliment by saying it was exactly like his mother used to make and she is now deceased.  He was so happy to enjoy it again and ate 2 big bowlfuls.  I also shared with other friends and everyone LOVED it.

Really easy recipe and a great way to use leftovers from the holidays (only needed to buy the split peas). It isn't anything super unique -- but it is a recipe that worked well just as written.  I'd make it again.

Used left over Christmas ham and it was awesome!  I used no fat reduced sodium chicken broth so I used all broth instead of broth + water.

Sometimes, simple is the best. After I roast a ham, I'll use the bone to make my split pea soup. I'll simmer the ham bone (with generous meat still attached) in the broth for an hour while I chop the veggies and saute in butter in a large skillet. I'll remove the ham bone from the broth, and then add the sauteed vegetables, split peas, and spices to the broth. Fantastique!

Wow!  I thought this recipe was too simple - and there was no way it could be a great soup with so few ingredients and seasonings.  Boy was I wrong!  I've already made it 3 times in the past 6 weeks - it is THAT good.  I've been on the hunt for a great split pea soup and my search is done!!  The only VERY MINOR tweaks that I made, were to add a carton of reduced sodium chicken broth instead of the quart of water (in addition to the 2.5 cups chicken broth), and a few carrots I had diced to add some color and texture.  A word of warning, if you buy the pre-packaged diced ham (which is what I used), make sure you rinse it thoroughly before adding it, or it could make your soup too salty.  I can't wait to have this again!!

Made this yesterday with Christmas leftover ham. The only change I made was I used carrots instead of celery. I served it to some guests last night (against my husbands recommendations, he thought no one would like it)-they loved it! Some even went back for seconds! I loved it and will definitely make it again!

I tried this recipe for New Years dinner! It was awesome! Didn't change a thing! Didn't need to! Did want to make one comment tho. Someone had complained that it took longer than the recipe said to cook. Please bear in mind that not all stoves are created equal. Mine took a little less time to cook and peas were very tender! Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

Great simple soup that reminds me of my grandmother's. I've made this several times since discovering this recipe a few years ago. Carrots make a great addition. For something different, try with bacon instead of ham and use 2 tbsp of the bacon fat to saute the onions and celery instead of the butter. Soooo good.

Very good and easy recipe.... I added five cloves of roasted garlic and more stock than water. About 5 cups stock and only 1.5 cups water. I also added a diced carrot and two celery stocks instead of one.

I made this soup today following the recipe exactly, with the addition of diced carrots. The end result was a very tasty pea soup. The problem with the recipe, is that it does not call for soaking the peas first.  There is no way this soup can cook in the suggested time without soaking the peas. I had to cook my soup for over 2 hours before the peas were at the right consistency. I will make it again and be sure to soak those peas the next go around.

This soup is delicious! I used chicken broth and water but added "Better Than Bouillon" for added flavor. I also added red pepper flakes while sautéing the vegetables. Very good and I'm glad I sautéed first. Almost forgot, I added a grated carrot as well. You won't be disappointed!

My kids like a creamy split pea soup, so I "smashed-up" some of the cooked peas.

Great and simple recipe. Delicious!  The cooking time was a bit too long and almost burned. Likely though dependant on the type of stove you have.

Make sure you remove the bay leaf! I prefer not to put garlic in pea soup, but that is just me. I used a sweet Maui onion, it was about a cup and pretty chopped, I don't want chunks of onion taste in my soup. I put the ham in the last 5 minutes so it would be juicy; ham is already "cooked". I used homemade ham broth with all the fat skimmed off, so depended on that to give the rich flavor of ham for the soup. Last half hour I added heirloom carrots from Trader Joe's, tested for salt, since there is already so much with ham and broth, did not need to add any. When serving, I added 1/2 teaspoon of Toasted Sesame Oil to each bowl, this makes an absolutely incredible bowl of soup for dunking toasted bread. I put Bragg's Amino Acid bottle at table for those looking for more salt without the sodium in their individual bowl. TIME NOTE: When cooking, I brought to a boil, then simmered on low, with lid; my soup was ready in 45 minutes. I would suggest making ahead of time in case your soup takes longer, depends on the type of pea and the type of broth vs. water for how long it will take, and some like it mushy too (like me). Even better the next day! Thanks!

Split peas needed to be cooked much longer to get mushy. maybe they should have been soaked overnight. I'll try it again.

Yummy!  After I devoured some myself, I froze the rest in individual portions to deliver to my father in law since split pea soup is his favorite.  Next time I will double the recipe!

This was great. I am new to cooking, our family had left over ham from Father's Day Brunch and took left overs home and made soup for lunch for the week. It was easy for someone that can barely boil water to pull off and it tasted pretty good. Excellent with some warm French Bread and butter. Tends to be a bit cool and cloudy in LA in June this soup hit the spot. Can not wait until Fall and serve this at our Sunday Dinner's for my entire family.

Amazing recipe..we have a butcher shop here in Charleston so I bought a 1.5 lb ham hock, threw in one slice of Applewood Smoked Bacon..I did use Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth and added two more cloves of garlic..came out perfect. I did have to cook a bit longer, but we live in an older house with an older stove so I think that was the differential. The boyfriend is Dutch, thus having high standards for Split Pea soup :), and after two minutes, I got a kiss. I think that speaks for itself.

This recipe has potential, but I'd say the soup, as is, was just ok.
First off, I'd recommend using reduced sodium chicken broth, and then
adding salt as needed.  Even though I didn't add any salt along the
way, mine was still on the salty side.  Felt that some more vegetables in the soup, perhaps carrots and/or potatos might improve
flavor.  Lastly, to make this a soup that would satisfy my pallet, I
felt like more spices would be needed.  I think I'll check out some
other split pea soup recipes on this site to see what kind of spices people are using in their split pea soup recipes.

I am an absolute (note ABSOLUTE) beginner when it comes to making soups, however I am a very practised taster of them. This recipe was so easy to follow and what's more, tasted DELICIOUS. Boyfriend is happy, I'm happy, I'm recommending it to my friends :)

3.5 stars. The flavor was wonderful, but I had a few issues. Putting cooked ham in to simmer for the time the recipe called for made the meat very chewy. Also, I needed way more liquid and kept adding before I could get the peas cooked through. Also, I had to strain the pea part of the soup to have a smooth texture (but i realize that may just be personal preference). Not sure I would make again.

This is probably the best homemade soup I’ve ever had! My boyfriend made it last...the only changes he made was using a bit more butter and garlic, and he dropped the center bone in from the ham steak while it was cooking. It had an amazing depth of flavor which is crazy since the ingredients were so simple. And he said it was incredibly easy to make.

I had never made, or eaten split pea soup, but it's one of my husband's favorites. I followed the recipe, minus the salt and pepper. And instead of cooking on the stove, I put it in the slow cooker after sauteing the onions, garlic and celery. My husband, who has loved this soup since childhood, said it was the best tasting split pea soup he's ever eaten! His only "complaint" was that he prefers it thicker. I will definitely be making this again. I'll probably just cook it for less time, or add a thickener(?)

This is a great recipe! I used a ham bone and water instead of stock.  I also added other vegetables including carrots and potatoes. Before serving, remove the bone and bay leaf. With the extra vegetables I used an immersion blender to thicken the soup and break up the vegetable chunks. This is our New Years go-to recipe using our Christmas ham bone.

Very nice dish. I stuck to the ingredients and made as the directions called for. I used the salted chicken stock and broth for flavor. Came out delightful. As the directions call for, salt and pepper to your own taste, worked out well.

This was far and away one of the best and easiest soups I've ever tried. First time for split pea soup and it was perfect and easy.  I did add 1 carrot. My husband loved it too. I served it with crusty garlic bread. It's a keeper.

Oh, yum! I made this mostly as written until the end when I decided on the spur of the moment to add diced baby carrots & potatoes as some reviewers suggested & then - just to get rid of them - i threw in half a package of frozen peas & carrots.
I had a ham bone from Christmas with a ton of ham on it & I used that broth instead of chicken stock.
I like cumin but would have never thought to use it but I'm glad I did! I loved the flavor of it in this soup!
My DH was impressed as well so I know I will make this again & again! It's a very forgiving recipe. I'm thinking of adding roasted corn the next time. Served with homemade cornbread for a hearty meal on this cold evening!

By far the best split pea soup I've ever had! I used left over Thanksgiving ham for this, and did not include the celery as I am not a fan. When the soup cools, it becomes like mashed potatoes, so adding a bit of water when reheating is a must, but does not take away from the delicious flavor. I will be making this recipe many more times in the future!

Delicious soup! I've been making it like this for years, usually just eyeballing the ingredients. I made as directed, but added some sliced carrots to the onion, celery, garlic saute as well. Turned out perfect and hubby and the kids gobbled it right up!

Great recipe. I used mostly stock and just a little water. I added 1/4 cup diced carrots and pureed the vegetables after sauteing them. I used a purchased smoked ham bone which added lots of flavor. I simmered the soup for 4 hours before eating so it was nice and thick. Delicious. I will make again.

YUMMY!  Especially on a cold day.   I live at 8800 feet in CO and simmered for an extra hour.  I didn't have any ham and the soup was still very filling for my family.  I added about 1/2 cup of diced carrots for me.  This is an easy recipe and very good!  Served with a side of french bread.

My Husband says this was one of the best soups I have made in awhile (and I make lots of soups) I personally liked the texture of a vegetarian slow cooker version I got off this site but did think this soup was quite good.  P.s. I made it exactly as written except I used Olive Oil instead of butter bc I didn't know I was out of butter until I started making this

I just got done making this in my crockpot and I am totally pleased. I loved eating the split pea soup my grandmother used to make and I haven't had it since I was a teen and this one is just like hers. I might add a little more chicken stock next time since it did cook down to where it is really thick. Definitely a great thing to have cooking for a cool evening meal.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was really good.  I prepped it the night before and left it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low the next day.  Before serving I ran my immersion blender through.  I topped my bowl with a dollop of sour cream.  Mmm.

Oh, boy! Is this good! I died over this recipe for like 2 weeks with leftovers. I had a lot more leftover ham thought and I didn't want to waste it so I used the whole bunch! Boy is this good though- wow!! Top notch.

Just like a can soup make sure to use low sodium broth and used just broth no water. Nice and thick.

Great recipe, I used fresh parsley instead of a Bay Leaf and added carrots. I didn't have chicken stock so I just used water. I did have a really nice ham bone and some good ham pieces so the flavor was good. Next time I will try it with the stock added.

My mom loves split pea soup. Me? Not so much. BUT, having tried this recipe, I may be converted to have a few bites.  Seriously, this is a great soup. I was going to add carrots towards the end, but forgot. Also, following another reviewer's advice, I boiled the ham bone and used that stock, and used the ham on the bone too. 

I pulled it off at around 45 minutes, it was beginning to become paste, so watch the simmering.  

I'm hanging onto this one!

Great recipe, I added bacon bits that I cooked with the onion, celery and garlic.  I also used minced garlic instead of slices.  Perfect blend of ingredients that produce a hearty and flavorful soup !

I made this soup for the first time and loved it.

I had to make it less than a month later, doubling the recipe.

Delish. Easy. Even better the next day!

Like all recipes created by Chef John that I've tried, this one turned out great. I added carrots and a tad bit of maple syrup in at the end. I also crushed the garlic instead of slicing it because I prefer not to bite down on garlic. All the salt already present in the ham and broth season this soup perfectly.

Delicious, and very easy.  Adding chicken broth was a great idea.  I also added carrots.  I might try adding a fan of Lennon juice next time.

It was wonderful!  I made two changes,  no bay leaf, and I remembered my husband used to add diced potato.  I also used bacon instead of ham.  I already had bacon and it was a rainy day and I didn't want to go out for the ham.

This was a good recipe.  I followed it as it was written except I added more garlic because I love garlic.  Anyhow, it could use slightly more liquid otherwise it is very good.

2nd time I've made it and love it during the cold weather months.  Great for leftover ham!!  I let it cook for a considerable amount of time for thicker, creamy soup.  Have previously added potato, but it's fine without.  Happy tummy!

I make this all the time and there are NEVER leftovers! We like garlic and I usually add a lot more. Also add carrots (finely chopped) at the beginning with the celery, onions, and garlic. We also like spicey so I add up to a tsp of cayenne.

will definitely make it again. I will need to make a few adjustments, add a little more liquid and let it cook a little bit longer. But the flavor was really good. easy dish to make. And it would be easy to make other adjustments such as carrots versus celery. kids really enjoyed it as well.

Very simple and easy. The split peas I used has a flavor pack that added a bit of smokiness. I recommend making this and Chef John has never  steered me wrong.

Awesome soup!  I've never had split pea soup before, and really didn't know what to expect.  It was amazing.  We added a couple pinches of salt at then end, and a fair amount of pepper.  Also added a tad of Lawry's seasoned salt for a little extra flavor.  Topped it with a bit of grated parmesean cheese.  Really good.  Can't wait to make again! (heck I'm excited about my leftovers for lunch today!)

I also added dry marjoram for last 5-10 mins of cooking, and it greatly enhanced the flavor. Highly recommended! 
You can also replace ham with the chicken/bacon combination, and the result is pretty good too.  Great soup for cold and dark night.

This is probably the best spilt pea soup I've ever made. I like mine a little thinner so added one extra cup of broth at the end. Also, I initially only added half the ham called for because it seemed like a lot, but trust me, you'll want to use the entire pound. Lastly, I always add a dash of lemon juice or vinegar to soups/stews/chili for acid balance, so I used lemon juice here and it was just what it needed.

Soup season is here!

An excellent and easy soup to make, I even received compliments from a friend who is a Red Seal trained chef!  It is a very thick soup, especially if you have enough for leftovers. I’ve made it twice and added extra stock the second time and it didn’t seem to make too much of a difference.

The problem must be that I really don't like split pea soup.  I was given it at school in the 1940'S and did not like it.  I thought I would give it another try.  This was a whole lot better than the soup from my childhood, but I still found I did not like it.  I gave it a 4 star based on the improvement and the assumption that people without my. prejudice might give it a four star.

Simple, healthful and delicious.  Froze several containers for lunches.  Soaked a smoked pig's foot for several hours in water, and then added it to the pot.  This is a keeper.

Doubled the recipe and followed the method exactly. Felt like a lot of garlic, but it was perfect. We did end up cooking the soup for double the time, but we had double as much. Recommend that you don’t season until the end, as the ham and broth gave enough flavour that we didn’t need to add extra salt. My husband loves spilt pea soup, and this was a winner.

How about some carrots?  Didn't mention if cooking was covered or uncovered. Mine took longer than 1 hr and 50 min.  When I added carrots and cooked it much longer covered it was 5 stars. Good thing I'm not a newbee to cooking.

Good pea soup base.  Kept it garlic-free and was just as good as Andersen's Pea Soup.   Going to try a few modifications next time: omit ham until the end, trying bacon instead of ham (as a garnish), etc.

So I used less garlic than stated & because I increased the recipe servings to 20, I also cut the ham amount down to half of what it stated. But OMG this recipe is so delicious & I did use my immersion blender briefly after it was cooked, just to mash up the celery, the  split peas etc & it is so delicious. Tip: go easy on the added salt, because the Ham already has lots of salt in it. This is def. a keeper. Yum!

This soup was exceptional. The only thing I added was chopped carrots with the celery, onion and garlic.  It was thick. Some recipes call for it to be placed into a blender. No need to do this with this recipe it was perfect.

I found the addition of a bay leaf added an enhanced flavor that made my mouth sing hallelujah!  This recipe is the first and only recipe that I have ever tried for split pea soup!  Using chicken broth also kicked the soup up in high gear!  My recipe of using plain water with salt pepper onion and garlic powders and a ham hock was good but this recipe is fantastic !!! I will use this now and forever more!

On the menu again next week. My husband absolutely loved this. We used a smoked ham hock and let it sit in there while the split peas we're simmering. Didn't need any additional salt after that. 

Thanks Chef John for another simple yet absolutely delicious meal

Something went wrong. My peas never got soft, not hard but definitely not soft. I even let it cook for an additional two hours adding water whenever needed. Everything else turned to mush but not the peas.

I made this to use up leftover ham +bone.
I have never made split pea soup, and usually don’t purchase a ham with bone in, my bad for that.
This was delish.  The only change I made was that I boiled the bone in a quart of water, and used ham bone broth instead of chicken broth, because I had no chicken stock or broth.  I then put all in crockpot on low for about 6 hrs.
This was very tasty and very easy

I used chicken broth from a boiled chicken, which was a bit bland, so I added 3 bouillon cube for additional seasoning. I also added some 3 chopped carrots. Excellent soup recipe.

Delicious! Definitely used more liquid (both water and broth) and also about 20 minutes more after adding more liquid to soften the pees a little more.

I added a ham bone from Easter...still lots of meat on the bone so it was very smoky. I also used the reduced salt chicken broth. The ham made up for it!

Great stuff! Left out the garlic, because it upsets my husband's stomach. Used a ham steak instead of ham hocks and it was fine. Did not use chicken stock, but simmered the ham steak for a few minutes in equivalent amount of liquid until the steak was hot. Then removed the steak, cut into cubes, dumped in the split peas, cooked onion and celery, put the cubed ham back in the broth and simmered for a bit longer than an hour. Very easy and good!

The only  change I made was I didn't use garlic. 
The onion was just the perfect touch.

So delicious. Made in the slow cooker, didn’t have a full 8 hours so did 2 on high then set to low - it was done after 3 hours on low (an hour early than I expected) so set to warm, didn’t want to turn to mush. Haven’t seasoned yet because I used chicken bullion for the stock, and pre-diced ham from the store. Those saltier ingredients plus sweating the onions/celery/garlic gave it plenty of flavor!

I know everyone hates changes but I am on a heart healthly and low salt diet so I made this in a slow cooker.  Same ingredients except for the butter,  no sodium chicken stock, 1 cup of each the diced veggies, and dry spices.  Put the peas in first then the ham then the rest. 12 hrs on low. Came out great.

I'm a big fan of Chef John and when I'm looking for something specific and I see his name I like to give it a try. Really great recipe. Easy. I added a carrot, because I like carrot in split pea soup. During cooking I added maybe another 3/4 c. water. A little salt (3/4 tsp) and some freshly ground pepper at the end. Thank you for the recipe.

I found by adding salt to ham that was already salty, it was too salty. Next time I would  not add any salt. Otherwise the soup was delicious. Would make again

I made this with some alterations and it is wonderful. I added a TBSP of celery salt as well as sea salt to taste, dumped 2 cups of the almost done soup into the blender to puree into a thick paste which I readded to the soup to give it a thick creamy texture and this step was a great addition as it came out like the pea soup of my childhood 2.0

I’ve made this recipe about five times now and it is hands-down the best split pea soup you will ever make!! The only changes I made were I added three carrots, skipped the Bayleaf as we don’t care for bay and added more water as needed. This is such a satisfying meal with a big piece of crusty artisan bread!!

This is the best split pea soup recipe ever!  I sauteed the onions, celery, and some chopped carrots in bacon grease and I added cooked, chopped bacon as well.   My husband and I add a little sweet Sherry to our bowls of soup at the end ... it's delicious!

I have made this recipe twice now.  I simply added no salt, the cans of broth has enough!  I added more broth and an 1/8  of cumin.  The soup does take larger to thicken than it states above.  A good recipe for split pea soup.

This was delicious! My husband and son loved it. I did use ham stock with the chicken stock, as I had a good ham bone I didn’t want to waste. I also added carrots, good way to get some veggies in n my son. Delicious.

I just made this, as hubby & I sit in 2 feet of snow-thought that would be a good time to warm the tummy.  Cut the recipe in half otherwise made exactly as listed.  Just excellent!  Served with a nice green salad and buttered bakery rolls.  Hope you give this a try-sooooo very good! Thank you, Chef John, for another great recipe!

So easy to make and delicious as well. I did add diced carrots and used chicken bone broth as these are personal preferences. Also, it took about 2 hours to simmer for desired thickness. I will definitely use this recipe from now on.

Excellent soup.  But 1 lb of ham to 1 lb of peas was a bit much.  Had a mouthful of meat in every bite.    I made it again with 4 ounces of diced ham and it was perfect.  Browned the ham in a skillet first.  Will use this recipe forever.

Easy and delicious soup! I had some ham bones with a bit of meat left on them--so I boiled those, and made broth out of them. I used that in place of the diced ham and chicken broth. I also added some chopped carrots too. Would definitely make again! Thank you Chef John!

I love split pea soup and had lost the recipe I was using for many years.  I found this recipe which seemed to be close to the one I add.  I just made it and was very happy with the result.  I made the recipe exactly as written, but I did add diced carrots.  The recipe says season with salt and pepper to taste.  I added about 3/4 tsp. Of salt while cooking and some freshly ground pepper at the end.  Delicious!

My soup was delicious. I made minor changes, soaked my yellow split peas overnight (the grocery didn’t have green split peas), added 1 diced carrot when sweating the vegetables, and cooked the soup with a leftover ham bone and the scraps of ham from the bone in the slow cooker on high for approx 8 hours. Best thing for this snow stormy weekend, served with homemade corn bread!

I got so many compliments on this and it was delicious. I had a ham bone and couldn't find recipes using just the bone so I tried this one. Instead of the ham (meat) ingredient I placed the bone which had some meat into the pot. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. Saved to favorites!

I made this for New Years Day and it was awesome.  I only made a few very small changes.  I used low sodium chicken broth for all of the liquid, added chopped carrots, a few extra cloves of garlic and omitted the salt.  Because we like spice, I added about 1 tsp cumin and the same of smoked paprika.  I cooked it for several hours and the soup thickened beautifully with the peas being completely cooked.  Loved it!

I boiled the Ham bone left over from our Christmas ham with parsley, thyme and pepper with enough water to cover the bone.   I then followed the rest of the recipe as written.   It was outstanding,  I will use this basic recipe every time from now on.

I referred to this recipe to remind me about how much water/liquid to put in. For my recipe I used 1 cup beef stock and 7 cups water adding in 4 chicken bullion cubes. I chopped 1/2 a carrot, 1/4 of an onion, 1 giant clove of garlic and cubed 1 medium sized potato. I didn't have celery but I am also not a fan of celery. I had a lovely ham bone and put that in too. I used about 18oz. of dried green peas. I chose olive oil instead of butter too. I like my pea soup smooth so that generally takes about 2 hours. I turn it off and let it cool. It is always thick and lusciously velvety. It came out divine! I love my recipe**

Made it to directions except I boiled peas for 2 minutes first and then let them sit for about an hour. And I did throw in a ham bone.
It cooked a little longer than 1 hour 15 minutes to get to consistency I wanted.

This is super simple and delicious.  I made 3 changes though.  I used olive oil instead of butter, I threw a couple of handfuls of lentils into it because they break down faster and make it a little thicker, and then I pressure cooked it at 15psi  for about 10 mins instead of boiling it for over an hour.  It turned out perfect.  Total time from start to finish was about 20-25 mins.

This was an astoundingly delicious soup

 I sautéed the onions in plenty of butter then added some fresh garden green onions and garlic tops and celery and crushed garlic along with chopped sweet potatoes, white potatoes and then dried herb and spice blends with a hint of curry and morocco and pink Himalayan sea salt, because I didn’t have any chicken broth on hand

Added the pound of ham coarsely chopped, the pound of dried split peas, a fresh Bayleaf and 1/2 gallon water 

wow  it turned out great 

Simmered about an hour 15 

I’m thinking if you follow this recipe as closely as possible you will be very happy that you did!!

 it’s a great recipe thanks Chef John

I didn’t have any bay leaves, but it’s still great without any! I let it cook for a couple hours (accidentally), and the peas broke down and made a nice creamy soup. Don’t forget the salt and pepper. Very tasty!!

This is the best Pea Soup With Ham I've ever made!  I did add 2 extra cloves of Garlic, 5 Bay leaves, 1 Medium Red Potatoe Chopped. I only had a Yellow Onion so used that instead of White.  2 tsp of Kosher Salt & 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper.  The potatoes did help to thicken the soup, but I wanted it a bit thicker, so I added 2 tbs of corn starch dissolved in 1/4 cup water.   The extra additions of Garlic & Bay Leaves made the flavor perfect. 
     No more searching for the perfect Pea Soup recipe...This is it!

This is HAM & split pea soup; not split pea with ham. Ham gets top billing because of quantity. OK to use canned ham & reserve the good stuff for steaks. 
My family's favorite soup. I add carrot rounds for color & texture. 

Punch it up a notch by adding 1/2 bag frozen peas 10-15 minutes before serving. (They float.) Garnish with fresh parsley.
Awesome!

I have made this soup several times, it is one of my husband's favorites! (And mine.) I love Chef John's recipes and never deliberately substitute. In this case, I do, only because I keep copious quantities of classic "mire poix" on hand and frozen, so all of my soups get this onion, celery, carrot mix. I also found this Thanksgiving, after finding my newly purchased chicken stock "opened" and unusable, I was able to simmer the carcass of our turkey breast and the stock worked just fine for the soup!

This was by far the easiest split pea soup recipe I've ever made.  And so flavorful.  I didn't stray to far from the recipe-only adding sliced carrots to it.  It took under 2hrs from start to finish and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

What he says about the salt-- he's not kidding. Add almost none at first, otherwise the ham might make it too salty in the end. It depends on the ham but the ham I used made it VERY salty.

This was so delish. The only change I made was adding some chopped carrot. I used the meat and broth from a ham bone that I had simmered. The reserved some of the broth for thinning the soup the next day.

I made this recipe with salt pork and it was by far the best split pea I've ever made. Previously I have used bacon and ham hock, but the salt pork out did it. Super rich comfort food, perfect for an autumn or winter night for the family.

We had left over ham with the bone from a work holiday party, so I thought I would make some Split Pea soup. I used a different recipe a couple years ago and it turned out good. I thought I would try another this time. This one was really easy to make. It was a hit with the hubby and was delicious. I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding carrots and a dash of cayenne pepper.

I am not a fan of celery pieces so I used two whole ribs while simmering. I also used onion powder and minced garlic. I melted the butter and added the onion powder and minced garlic and ham and let that simmer a minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it on about a 4 level heat for an hour and twenty minutes. It was perfect!! My first time making this but will definitely make it again!!

Delicious. My kids were fighting over who got to finish the pot. 
Changes: no onion; used my homemade broth, comprised of smoked pig hocks simmered for 24 hours with black pepper corns, roughly chopped onion, carrot and celery. To make enough soup, added liter of vegetable broth. Used split peas I had already softened. Sooooo yummy! Thank you for the recipe. I’m making it again right now.

A great soup for rainy or cold night like we're having tonight. Made some this evening. We'll eat half then freeze the other half for even colder days ahead. For our personal pre, I use a whole chopped onion & a couple of chopped carrots.

I have made this twice. The first time exactly as written. The second time I used a whole container of chopped celery and chopped onion. I used 1/2 pound ham but cut into really small pieces. I loved the end result and so did my guests on a chilly Fall day!

I made a few changes I substituted olive oil for a para are use no celery and I added garlic powder ham seasoning and black pepper. It was super delicious and the bomb. A must try. And I use a ham shank instead of the chopped ham, I plan to shred to ham shank later.

So good!!  Love this recipe.  Only change is I add carrot chunks.  When the soup is fully cooked I strain out the ham and the carrots and put the soup in a blender to make it smooth.  Then I return the ham and the  carrot chunks and it is amazing!!

This is the second time I've made this in a week! I absolutely love this soup. I used reduced sodium chicken broth,  and added carrots. I just doubled the recipe so my adult kids can try it, as they both love  split pea and ham soup. Great recipe!

Great Pea Soup!   (and I'm not even the biggest fan)  Used a little less ham as I didn't have full amount on hand) but didn't notice due to great flavor.  I used extra black pepper (closer to a tablespoon) and found that it took longer to cook than advertised (may have had simmer set too low).  Just cooked an extra hour and smashed as many peas as I could into paste  to thicken things up.  Another Superb recipe by Chef John!  Serve with stale/crusty bread or lots of crackers.

I used smoked ham and it turned out to be excellent.  Just a bit saltier than i like.  I used low sodium broth and very little salt, next time i will not salt it at all..

This is hands down the best split pea soup we have ever had and I've been making soups for a long long time. I used both green and yellow split peas and sweat the carrots along with the onion, garlic and celery. As others have said, it is the 'sweating' that does the magic in this recipe.

This was a great soup.  Additional instructions on the video which I think are important for the flavor:  add a pinch of salt to the onion/celery/garlic so they will sweat and after they are translucent, add the ham, bay leaf and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes prior to adding the peas/stock/water.

Instead of adding chopped ham, I had a ham bone that still had plenty of meat on it and cooked it in a slow cooker.  After about four hours I pulled it out and cut the meat off the bone.  the meat was chopped and added back in.  Otherwise I made it as the recipe was written.  I've also made Betty Crocker's version and like that better.

Pretty much just dumped everything in the crock pot and let it go for 5 hours on high. It was a little on the thin side, so I added dehydrated potato flakes to thicken it a bit. I really liked it! My kids did not. I don't think that should discourage people. If it's not a fruit snack, kids need to try things lots of times, usually, before they like it.

This is good soup. Everyone in my family loved this. The seasoning is perfect.  Because I have a dedicated green pea hater, I  had to change the color of the soup. I used half yellow and half green split peas. I also added red lentils and a handful of mixed dried black, pinto, and red beans. I put the dried mix in my slow cooker with a ratio of 2 cups water to 1 cup dried mix. I put it on low over night. In the morning I drained the peas. I followed step  1, and put it in the slow cooker.  T added back the peas . I used a ham hock,  and I put that in. Lastly I put in the  chicken broth,  water and seasoning.  I cooked it on low for 12 hours.  I removed the ham hock and used my immersion blender to make a thicker soup. I deboned the ham hock and put it back in. Yum!

I never had a shoulder ham , so I took bulk ham lunch meat, cubed it into bite size. I sauted until golden brown, then added to soup.

I made as directed and it was delish. I may add potatoes or other veggies next time, because I think it could also be a good springboard recipe, but it really was a great stand alone recipe too.

Great! I had to cook the peas longer, close to 2 hours. And I used the ‘Better then Bouillion’ for the chicken flavor base. It was great- I think the best pea soup I have ever made

Made this recipe twice and both times it turned out well. I used yellow peas the second time and added more ham as my husband likes a lot of ham. I did not have celery on hand so I finely grated 1 cup of  carrots. It made a lot of soup and I was able to put some in the freezer for future lunches.

This soup gets better over next few days. I blend 3/4 of the soup after the soup is cooled to mimic the texture of famous Anderson's split pea soup. Subtle but delicious. It is going to be a staple at my house.

I've made this soup a number of times and it's great!  Of all the pea soup recipes I've  tried this is, by far, my husband's favorite one. The only change I make is to substitute three carrots (peeled and diced) for the celery because (1) we don't  like celery and (2) the carrots add color and a great flavor.

I changed the celery for carrots.  
Added chicken chorizo which provided a kick of heat.  
I did 1 small size yellow onion.
I used vegetable stock

I used this recipe as the base for my soup, and it gave a wonderful base. But I felt I needed a bit more veggies in it and added two large diced carrots and one medium diced potato.  And a shake or two of thyme.  It was wonderful and will definitely make this soup again.

I used a nice meaty ham hock which I added with the split peas and broth. I doubled the recipe and after I took out the ham hock I added almost 2 lbs of sliced carrots and cooked for another half hour. It was absolutely fantastic and will be my go-to recipe for split pea soup from now on.

This recipe is great!  I used a small yellow onion and grated carrots because I was out of celery.  I wasn’t paying attention and burned the onion and carrots, so I salvaged what I could and started over.  I searched my spice cupboard and added a sprinkle of toasted onions and dehydrated shallots to add back some of the onion flavor I had lost.  Instead of canned or boxed chicken stock I used water and a tablespoon or so of Penzey’s vegetable soup base.  It took well over an hour to cook.  When it was done, I removed the bay leaf and briefly used an immersion blender to make it a bit more creamy while still leaving chunks of ham and peas.  My friend was over for dinner and we both went back for seconds.  Loved it and will definitely make it again!

Great soup, easy to make, I agree with others, if you're not reaching a high enough temperature the peas will not fully cook in the time stated.  Also - don't forget to remove the bay leaf before serving!  Recipes frequently seem to leave out one or two important steps.

I used ham broth made from a meaty picnic ham bone and added a little chicken broth to make the full measure of liquid. The diced picnic ham and a little residual fat from the ham broth really brought out the flavor. Carmelizing the onion in the butter adds a little sweetness.  I don't particularly like bay leaf, so instead I added  1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper and 1/4 teaspoon celery salt to add a little zing. Great, great soup!

I have made this soup countless times and it’s fabulous. It’s perfect as it is but along with the celery, garlic, and onion, I like to add 2 carrots (finely chopped). Seriously, you cannot go wrong with this recipe. It’s so popular in my family that I normally triple or quadruple the recipe and freeze the leftovers. You won’t be disappointed.

Made this exactly as directed and we loved it.  I will make it again and I don't think I would change a thing except to add more carrots but that's just because we like carrots!  I put some in the freezer as there is only two of us and it was just as good after defrosting and re-heating.

Great starting point!  I followed the recipe, but I added a carrot also. We don't like our soup super thick so I added 2 more cups of water to thin it out. I also used an immersion blender to make it creamier. I cooked it with the ham bone, but didn'tadd the diced ham until about 10 mins, before serving.

I've been making my pea soup this same way for decades and I also add one or two leeks which smooth out the onion flavor.

The previous reviews were helpful.  I found that the soup did need to cook a little longer so the peas wouldn't be too crunchy.  I added a little more pepper and a little cumin to give it some spice, as another reviewer had suggested.  Very good meal on cold days!  Perfect with cornbread.

My daughter, a chef, once made me the best pea soup I'd ever tasted with ground frozen peas. So, I made this as directed and added two cups of frozen peas, grounded in my Nutribullet, at the very end, and some extra broth. It gave the soup a more vibrant colour and texture. It was a hit.

Made a half recipe. Did not have any chicken stock, garlic cloves or bay leaf.  So made my own stock with chicken bouillon and ramen chicken flavor, garlic powder, oregano and rosemary, no added salt.  Turned out amazingly good and so simple to make!!!

Very good recipe and extremely easy to make.  I varied it only by adding the entire ham bone to the pot for additional flavor.   Combined with cornbread it makes an excellent winter meal.

I am not sure I would change anything, although you could add carrots if you want them.  But the soup is quite good as is.

A very simple split pea soup recipe.  It's an ok base recipe, but it's bland on its own and just needs something else.  I tried simmering the split peas with a smoked pork bone.  I also added two carrots and a little sprinkle of thyme.  A sprinkle of lemon at the end really helped; vinegar might be even better.  But in general, it's nothing special.

Okay, full disclosure: I do not like split pea soup, so I didn't actually eat any. This is my husband's and son's opinion.

Changes I made: I added a bunch of carrot coins and about 5 pieces of bacon, chopped up ??.  And I used extra light Olive oil instead of butter.

My husband loves split pea soup and said this was fantastic. He said I should bring it to a church potluck because everyone would love it.

My four year old son loved it and asked for seconds. He gave me a hug and said it was a reward for making such a yummy dinner. He has literally never done that before.  I mean he had hugged me a zillion times, but never as a reward for having cooked something.

So although I didn't personally try it, it receives rave reviews from my household!

This recipe is so good.  I made it with leftover Christmas ham.  Where I live we can't get split peas, so I substituted lentils.  Still amazing.  Comfort at its best.  Thank you!

This is a great soup!  Very good flavor!  I used my immersion blender after cooking for 1 ½ hours.  Gave it a few pulses for a smoother texture!  Will definitely make this again for a hearty meal on a cold winter's night.

Wow !  I have never made Split Pea soup and was it delish!!!!   I added a ham hock in for added
Flavor and then added 4 carrots and 4 diced potatoes towards the end and simmered a long time.    Will be making this again.... but next time using the crock pot!  I made one error — recipe calls
For 32oz of chicken broth.  I used 48oz and used less water instead.   I cooked the ham hock in the water i used and then added the ham hock to the soup.   I used zero salt and pepper and it was still very salty from the chicken broth and ham.

My rating is due to the fact I used honey glazed ham chunk, which made the soup sweet.  Bad move on my part.  May try it again with just plain ole ham.

I don’t like split pea soup, however, I make it for my parents and my in-laws who are all in their mid 80’s they LOVE it!
They all say it reminds them of the soup they had growing up on the farm! Score!

Great recipe! I made it today when the wind chill outside was 15 below zero here in Maine! I used bacon as I had no ham and carrots in place of celery. Fantastic! It didn't thicken like pea soups I've made before but I was using a dollar store bag of split peas so that could be why! I'll make it again, filling and healthy and just yum.

This was pretty tasty. We made it exactly as described. Next time I'd add a bunch of carrots and other veg, as that's how I'd prefer it, and less ham. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very simple & delicious soup! I have learned to cook the peas (& any beans) without salt or bouillon and just add that in at the end when they are fully cooked. If added too early in the cooking process it will not allow them to cook properly. I just learned this about a month ago so sharing in hopes that the tip helps others.

Great soup. I made it yesterday following the recipe instructions.  It turned out perfect and everyone in our house loved it. I used fresh sliced (diced) regular ham and stayed away from any already processed boxed ham (these usually have a lot of fillers). Also, I used low sodium chicken stock since the ham itself has a ton of salt. Next time I may add diced baby carrots. A hard copy of this recipe was added to my list of favorites.  Thank you.

Simple and easy recipe! What really took the soup to the next level was adding "Everyday Seasoning" from Trader Joes.  It makes a lot of food!

I made it just as the recipe called for with the exception of the celery, I left that out as I just don't care for it and it turned out really well. The chicken stock gives it a lot of flavor and the cooking time was enough for the peas to get cooked through well.
 I loved it and will definitely make it again.

I added a ham bone and 1 tsp of soda, when the peas had not softened after 2 hours.  This helped, but I also recommend cooking for 3-4 hours.

Made with ham stock I made the day before. Replaced water and chicken stock with ham stock. Making another batch a few days later. I added some carrots too. Cooked in the crock pot all day. Perfect winter meal. Can't wait for my next ham bone and ham leftovers.

I used a smoked pork hock and some boneless ham. I also added some liquid smoke for an even smokier flavour. It’s a great fall comfort soup. Thanks again chef John!

WOW!  Only thing different was to add some diced carrots. It cooked down quickly and was absolutely delicious. I'm not a good cook but my next door neighbor is - she's always having to doctor things up for me. She tasted it, gave me the nod, and pronounced, "well done." Will make this a million times.

This is probably the best Split pea soup I've ever had hands down. I used a ham shank and left some pieces of bone with meat on them to simmer. didn't have the bay leaf...added a little arrowroot powder to thicken because it was getting late but otherwise followed to the tee...awesome soup

This is by far the best split pea with smoked ham soup I’ve ever tasted. The only change I made was the addition of a small amount of shredded carrot, mostly for appearance. This recipe is near the top of my list of favorites!

I made the recipe with 3 changes:  I had no chicken broth, so I added  the 4 c + 2 and 1/2 cups of liquid to the sweated veggies and ham, and added 2 Knorr bouillon cubes.  I added one diced potato, and I added 3 chopped carrots.  The ham I had was smoked and very dry, and it was the perfect type for the soup.  Very tasty soup.

My husband requested a few cans of split pea and ham soup from the store, I had never made it before but I figured why buy cans and searched All Recipes. I followed Chef John's recipe exactly except I added carrots in to sweat with the onions and celery. My husband LOVED it, said it was the best split pea and ham soup he'd ever had, better than the cans (that's a huge compliment from him). It got really thick when it cooled off but I added some more chicken stock to it when I reheated it and it was perfect.

I used about a cup of diced onion versus the stated half of an onion. I seasoned it with 2 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of black pepper. I used fresh bone in ham, diced. I intentionally left out the chicken stock. I used my slow cooker on low for 9 hours, seasoned it with the remaining hour on low. It came out great!

We loved it.  The only problem was it didn't make enough.  Next time I plan to double the recipe.

This was perfect. I looked at 5 or 6 other recipes before settling on this one. The taste is great and I prefer the texture to the puréed versions of this soup. In full disclosure, and, I hate that I'm that person, but I made one substitution: I used ham stock instead of chicken. I was honestly afraid of doing it as well because I didn't want it to be overwhelming ham, but it worked.

This was a good recipe.  I added some cayenne pepper. Mine was ultra thick and I needed to thin it down some but overall was really good.  My ten year old picky daughter loved it.

A very easy and delicious soup!   I did not add any salt as I found the ham gives off enough.  Loved it.  Thanks!

My DIL brought some leftover soup to the upscale steakhouse; she works as a server. The chef had a taste and was begging for more. How cool is that?

This is a basic split pea soup. I swapped carrots for the celery and that was it. It was delicious. My daughter, who is a chef, loved it. It was so easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. A nice, hearty soup for a chilly winter day. I think I may have gone heavier on the ham (my family and I love ham).  I also added more broth and water to thin it out a bit. I paired mine with a nice homemade yeast roll. This is definitely a staple now.

I love this recipe! I use ham stock instead of chicken stock, no water. When the peas are tender I put half of the soup into a blender and leave the other half chunky and mix the two halves. Then I add the ham and carrots and tiny cubed potatoes. To die for, hearty and smokey and YUMMMY!

This will be a standard go to recipe in my house, anytime I have some leftover ham.  I used chicken stock in place of water. I eliminated salt then  added cumin, coriander and a little mace.
Yum!!!

This is such an easy soup to make. I have never cooked with split peas before. There is definitely an art to it. As it states simmer on a low temperature. It got very thick, quite quickly, so I took it off the stove in less than an hour. But the flavour was very good and I will be making it again.

I literally just finished making this and it is so yummy for a 30 degree day!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only change I made was to add a diced carrot just because I love carrot in split pea soup.

This one is a winner!! We only made a few changes, leaving out the celery, adding a couple chopped carrots and using a ham bone instead of just ham, removing the bone and adding the salvaged ham back in. And to get it just a "little" thicker, I used my old trick of adding a couple of tablespoons of instant mashed potato flakes just to "bind" it up a bit. It was amazing!!

Very tasty and easy to make. I tossed a hambone in and simmered longer than directed. I also added some diced carrots. It was delicious and got even better as leftovers!

Gave it 4 stars although I used ham stock instead of chicken stock so I think that woud be a greatly different flavor profile. Loved the choped ham pieces in combo with the thickened pea soup.

I did not add any salt until the end and it did not need any -- and I like salt!  Used a Honeybaked ham bone and its ham and it was plenty salty.  I took out hambone instead of leaving it in -- I think leaving it in too long can draw too much of the fat/flavor into your soup.  I added more liquid as well.  I have made several of these over the years and family said this was the best.

This soup is really yummy - very rich & filling - perfect comfort food for a cold weekend.  Instead of using chicken stock, I boil the ham bone and use that stock which just adds to the richness.

So yummy. However I did add shredded carrots and 4 stalks of celery and a whole small onion. Oh and I can't do chicken so I used vegetable stock instead. So so yummy. And it cooked up nice and thick in an hour and 15 minutes. We didn't have any problems with the peas that other people have had.

Definitely scratched that split pea soup itch that comes over me from time to time!  I cut the carrots and added a smoked ham hock for that little bit of extra smoky flavor as well as some fresh rosemary.  Couldn't have been more pleased with this recipe, my tummy was extremely happy!

The soup was terrific. The only problem was it took for ever to thicken. I think I should have left it un-covered when simmering. Also I had two bowls and there are maybe two more bowls left. the recipe says 8 servings. But the flavor was great!

This is really tasty, doesn't need any extra salt because of the ham. I subbed water for more chicken stock. Cook time was fine. Second time I added some lentils, and veggie stock in place of water, but I think I cooked it too high (M, note to self) and it ended up a thick paste.

Great soup.
Changes made:
Bumped up the ham and celery a bit - ham addtional 4-5 ozs, celery 4 stalks instead of two.
Added some fresh nutmeg for a little twist.

It's a good basic recipe.  Very tasty, but like someone else said, it took longer than the given time to cook it properly.  Cook it until the peas become soft.

Let me begin by saying that I absolutely detest peas in any way, shape or form. My husband, however, loves them... especially split pea soup. I've made it for him several times, to only "meh" reviews. I decided to try out this recipe just because. Well... He not only raved about it, he asked me to make more so he could take it to work for lunch! I was so surprised that I actually took a tiny taste and was shocked that not only did I not immediately gag, but I actually liked it! The only thing I added was a bit of fresh Thyme, otherwise I followed it to the letter. Thanks for the recipe, can't recommend it enough.

Made this recipe this past week. Made recipe exactly as written and the flavour was fantastic. I ended up adding quite a bit more water as it was cooking but that did not alter the flavour at all. In the end I decided to add a couple of new potatoes as I was going to serve this to my grandgirls (5 & 2 1/2) so I needed a bit more substance so the 2 year old could keep the soup on her spoon. They were dubious in the beginning but after tasting they loved it and asked for more!! I have always made Pea Soup but used a recipe with Turnip but thought the girls may find that a bit "different" tasting so left it out. Thanks for the recipe.

So easy and even more delicious .  The only substitution I made was to use ham broth in place of some of the water. As a result, I did not need to add salt.

A fairly simple recipe but with good flavor as written. I always make a new recipe as written when I try it for the first time, just so I know what the original intent was. 

Now, the next time I made it, I changed a few things, as all of us who love to cook are apt to do. 

1. I boiled a ham bone that was left over from Christmas for six hours or so, letting the meat left on it come apart and the marrow to disintegrate. I discarded the bone (by giving it to my dog of course) and gristle while retaining the stock and meat. I used this in place of the water and cubed ham. 

2. After sauteing the onions, carrots, and garlic in a small pan I transferred them to my large slow cooker. Then I added the ham, stock, peas, and bay leaf and cooked on low for 6 hours or so. 

It turned out great. By using the ham stock, it added much more flavor to the soup from the marrow and cartilage!

We made this after a ham dinner using the bone to make stock as suggested, other than that following the recipe exactly.  It was amazingly delicious and even my picky pea eaters loved it.  Can't wait to have a ham dinner again, with this as the wonderful aftermath!

Great Recipe, and very simple! Used Bouillon Cubes instead of chicken stock, and still tasted great. Though, I prefer my split pea a little bit thinner. As is, this one turns out pretty thick (solid when in refrigerator). Next time I would add an extra cup of water and increase the vegetable amounts just a tad. I might also add a chopped potato or two midway through cooking for extra texture.

I've made split soup for fifty years now, and this really works.  My changes:
-//- A slow cooker on low all day rather than quickly on the stove.  You don't have to sweat the vegetables this way either.
-//- One rib celery, one large carrot--I can't imagine split pea soup without the bits of orange and the carrot flavor.
-//- Not having Chef John's knife skills, I chop the vegetables in the blender with the 2-1/2 cups of water.  It works fine for me.
-//- For ham, the hambone from a dinner with whatever meat clings to it--don't trim too closely so you'll have bits of ham.  You'll have to get the bone out and any large pieces of ham to crumble them finer.  Put them on a plate to cool and crumble in your hands or use a knife.
-//- Country ham is usually quite salty, but with a dinner hambone you'll need more salt and can put black pepper right in the soup when cooking.  Still, you can add later but you can't take it out, so start cautiously.

I've been making pea soup for over 40 years and this was the best ever!   Like others mentioned, the sweating of the  vegetables might have made a huge difference.....maybe the ham was just better, maybe using 3 cloves of garlic?    Carrots were a must for me and that was the only thing I did differently than the recipe suggested.  Chef John's recipes are always excellent and easy.   If you haven't tried his method for mashed potatoes yet....do it!  Perfect every time!

We loved this soup! I made a couple of minor changes: I defrosted a bag of Mirepoix (diced onions, carrots & celery), instead of fresh, and added a ham hock since my ham didn't have a bone in.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said it was the best split pea soup ever!

My family just finished this for dinner. This is by far the easiest and best pea soup. Even my husband who doesn't care for pea soup said it was a keeper!

Tasty soup but needed additional salt and pepper, this is to your taste. I used a ham slice, cut into small pieces along with carrots, celery and onion that were sweated for a few minutes. Additional water was needed during the cooking process as it evaporated.  I added a bouillon cube instead of stock. This soup needs to be constantly stirred as it will gum up if you do not. Making pea soup from another recipe before, this was an easy recipe for sure. Great fall soup served with butter and garlic croutons. Letting the soup stand for a few minutes before serving will give you a thicker soup.

Great recipe! I omitted the salt & pepper,  doubled the rest of the ingredients and added a bag of shredded carrots. It cooked up beautifully and tasted delicious. I would've liked to run my immersion blender a bit to help thicken it up although it was fine without just not as thick as we are prefer.

Fantastic  soup! I the only changes and additions that I made were that I used a whole medium onion, I added two finely diced carrots, I used all low sodium chicken broth instead of water and put it all in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.

Pretty much followed the recipe.  Used two packages of Hormel diced ham and saved a considerable amount of time and effort.  Very tasty and satisfies on those beautiful and cold Seattle nights!

I made this wonderful, velvety soup last night and was both surprised and amazed at just how good it was for so little trouble to make. I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of adding one small chopped carrot. I will return to this recipe again and again, the results are so good with little effort. Thanks again for a really great recipe, Chef John!

Split pea loves to be cooked with a bone. If yuo don't have a haam bone try a hock. Using only cubed ham is still excellent and a bit simpler.

I will defiantly be making this again just in a smaller batch. I have made this several times, I cooked mine at med-low for about 2 1/2 hours so all flavors have a chance to blend. This recipe is my go to for split pea soup!

Delicious, easy, and enjoyed by all.  I went exactly by the directions, but added one diced carrot.  I thought that was essential.  Also, I'm a garlic lover, but I thought the flavor the three sliced cloves added didn't work, especially the next day when I had the soup as a leftover.

As always chef johns recipe is the best. I've made mine similar to this for years, but I loved the addition of the garlic, and I add shredded carrot. It's a winner everytime, since I eat this soup way more often then I have ham bones left over.

Very good, indeed.  Instead of onions, I used scallions (which I had an over abundance of from a previous recipe but sliced them very thin) and I chopped up two large carrots to be lightly cooked with the scallions, garlic and celery.  I also added two large bay leaves broken in half for an added touch.  I was unable to find a ham bone, so at the suggestion of the butcher, I used 3 smoked ham hocks cooked with the rest of the ingredients.  I used 1 lb of a ham steak, cut up small, added when the soup was done.  It was delicious.  Did not add salt.  The hocks were salty enough.

My kids didn't really care for split pea soup 'til one day I made this.  Now they love it!  This recipe is so super easy, and I think the ham makes it a heartier dish.  Enough to just eat this as the main entree with some bread on the side.  I usually season my food really well, but I think the ham adds so much flavor that salt and pepper are not really necessary at the end.  It's delicious just as is.  Two big thumbs up from my household!

I made with leftover ham from thanksgiving. Sautéed ham in pot first, then followed instructions pretty well. I had to cook longer though and used my immersion blender at the end. (Fished out most of Ham pieces first)I only wish I made fresh croutons to go along with it!

Very good.  I used 32oz. chicken stock, 1 can of low sodium chicken broth and 1 cup of water.  After about 1 hour of cooking, it was getting pretty thick so I put the lid on it.

Just made this tonight with the help of my 12 year old daughter as sous chef. I used Yellow split peas instead of green as the sous chef does not like green soup. Turned out excellent. I encourage you to watch the accompanying video for tips on sweating the vegetables and seasoning tips. As Chef John advises watch the Salt! I didn;t add any and for me it was excellent. Will depend on the ham you use and its salt content. Also The yellow split peas seemed to take about an hour longer to break down than indicated in the recipe. Everything else I did the same. Very easy to do with minimal prep. I will be saving this one and will make again. Loved it! Very hearty and flavourful soup indeed! Thank you very much Chef John!

Great soup,  full of flavour, takes longer to cook than 1.5hrs however, added 3 medium carrots, an extra cup of water and and extra cup of stock, as well as the bone from the ham to give it more of that smokey flavour...

Another excellent CJ recipe.  Prepared exactly as described, and my husband and picky six year old loved it.  Great flavor and texture, and easy to make.  My husband thought it might even taste better with carrots in it.

Followed the recipe adding carrots for color and sweetness. It was perfect for our leftover ham!!  Our 12 and 15 year old boys scarfed it down. Used a little more stock than called for and didn't add any salt. Served with warm crusty bread...fantastic on this cold, rainy day.

Excellent!  Followed recipe exactly (except I forgot to add the garlic).  Made on a snowy New England winter day and my husband who doesn't like peas declared it very good.

I loved this. I did have to cook a little longer but that was OK. I cooked it early enough. I did add some red pepper flakes and it was perfect. My huband loved it as well. Great simple, healthy recipe.

I absolutely LOVE this soup. The only change I made was to use low sodium chicken broth. It turned out perfectly. My Family loves it too. I will definitely make this again.

Well, I'm not sure what I expected since I've never had split pea soup before, but this was not it. This was basically green peas with ham. It tasted fine I guess, but definitely nothing special and not something we want to eat as a soup / main dish. I gave it two stars since it does taste OK, but we won't be making this again.
