This is almost exactly like my recipe for JULEKAGE (Norwegian Christmas bread).  Don't bake it in the casserole, but rather form it into a circular loaf and bake on a cookie sheet.  Butter the top when it comes out of the oven.  It is best when sliced and toasted, then buttered and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Store wrapped in plastic or a Ziploc bag.  Yummy!

This was more like a batter bread.  Needs more flour.  A 2 qt. casserole was not large enough for this recipe.  Slopped over the edge and fell in the middle.  I was very disappointed.

Delicious. Baking as round loaf on greased baking sheet worked better than casserole. Monitor carefully while baking to avoid overcooking. Not a recipe for novice or beginner bakers. More experienced bakers should have no problem.
