I signed up just to rate this recipe.  It serves closer to 10 than 4, so be prepared.  We had leftovers here for days (but it reheats well).  I made these balls to practice for the upcoming Holiday, and they came out great!  Use salted water on your hands to keep the dough from sticking to them, and drop the balls into the broth with a slotted spoon.  I also used the freezer to get the dough ready faster.  It took about an hour.  I added some veggies to the soup.  My Jewish mother-in-law even said they were some of the best she's ever had.  I'm not sure if this recipe is kosher or not, but it's great either way.

This recipe makes up the absolute best matzo balls I have ever had.  They were fluffy, not heavy and very flavorful.  This made about sixteen 1-2" matzo balls.  This will be my go-to recipe, especially when I don't have schmaltz on hand for my grandmother's recipe.

Excellent! These Matzo balls nursed me back to health when I was suffering from the flu.

Just had these last night for an early sedar. They were a HIT with homemade chicken broth! I may jazz them up with a few more spices, aromatics or schmaltz instead of oil next time for a twist :)  These were very simple to make. I doubled the recipe which made way too much (2 large balls per person... 8 people) so half the dough is still in the fridge.

I accidentally used Matzah Cake Meal without making any changes, and these still turned out really well.  The flavor of your stock makes or breaks this dish, but the Matzo balls were really good.  It made 36 balls, so I fed my family of 8 and had leftovers.  I did use about 4 quarts of stock, though.  Great recipe.

Not a huge fan of all the extra ingredients.  I didn't have the soda so they didn't come out as fluffy as usual.  I might try it again...

I made it according to the direction.  Boring and bland.  Maybe this is just not my thing.  So sorry.

This recipe is phenomenal! The only thing I really changed was adding diced garlic and some finely chopped onion into the balls! I use a honey dew scooper drop them into the broth so they are all the same size. :)

Very fluffy balls, super tasty. Added chicken and noodles which really added a lot to it. As others have said it made way more than 4 servings. Cooking time was accurate. Will make again. :)

This was as delicious as everybody said it would be! I didn't have any vodka, so I just substituted more chicken broth, but it was fabulous! I don't know if the vodka would even be noticed. This was chewy and delicious and flavorful. I made 1 and 1/2 batches because I had a big crowd coming, and accidentally added too much garlic, but I'm so glad!

Have always just used a ix. This is my first time making the matzo balls from scratch, and they are so YUMMY!! Very easy to make and very yummy. I made them each with a diameter of 1inch, so my batch yielded over 20 matzo balls

OMG OMG OMG.. this was beyond awesome.. probably one of the best dishes i've ever had.. i tried making matzo ball soup once and it was horribly bland.. first mistake.. i followed the directions on the box.. i should have known better.. i cut this recipe in half and only addition to the matzo balls was about 1 1/2 tsp of fresh parsley.. i made my infamous "caldo" (chicken & tons of veggies soup).. saved the broth and cooked the matzo balls in that.. i hate to rile up all the jews in beverly hills.. but this is better than the matzo ball soup at The Nosh.. and i LOVE their matzo ball soup.. ty for such a versatile recipe.. my tummy is smiling
