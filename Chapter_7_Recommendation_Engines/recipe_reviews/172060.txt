What a healthy and filling sandwich.  You could also use roast beef or even turkey or ham for the meat.  I would also use fresh spinach instead of lettuce for the added health beneifts.

My girlfriend says it's the best wrap she's had & gives it a '5' - I give it a '4'. For sure, the proscuitto tastes better cooked up over raw. Overall, a very tasty (love hummus) and easy to prep wrap.

I love this wrap. When it's hot, I fry the meat on the stove top and melt the cheese by placing a lid over the pan. 

I also like to add sun-dried tomatoes, if I have them.

tasty sandwich.  will keep in the rotation for sure.  BTW, the person who reviewed "Watch the salt"  that is not a review!  yes, the sandwich comes in a bit high for salt, but if you make your own hummus that helps cut down a bit and if nothing else is salted in the wrap than you know the only salt is coming from the prosciutto.  I will add some red onion next time.  I used a spring mix of dark lettuces and I used only 2 slices for each wrap; only because I make another sandwich which calls for 3 and we like it better with 2--just a personal preference.  And, as we are getting to the point of not getting farm fresh veggies, good tomatoes are harder to come by.  I will try this with roasted red peppers!

Delicious combination of flavors!  Made the recipe as written - doubled the recipe and enjoyed the wraps for lunch the second day.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Nice for lunch or a light dinner. I used veggie bacon instead of prosciutto.

Delicious! So easy to prepare and very tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn't crisp the Prosciutto. I added some slices of yellow pepper for the crunch factor. I used grated Mozzarella which I had on hand. I wolfed it down and my mouth is watering for another. Yummy!

Fantastic!! Super simple to prepare resulting in a healthy and satisfying meal. I made it just as written except I used shredded mozzarella. I will definitely repeat this recipe - often!
