Amazing. Added a bit more Chipotle peppers just for kicks and it turned out to be the perfect amount of spice! Also added some green bell peppers, onion tomato and bread crumbs on top right before baking to give some more diversity to it. Came out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe. My new go to mac and cheese!

This was super yummy. Instead of the chipotle in adobo sauce I put in a can of diced green chiles and some cayenne pepper. We will definately make this again.

This stuff is addictive. My husband and I can eat a whole 9x13 pan in 24 hours. If you want to avoid gaining 10 lbs every time you make this, you may want to make a smaller batch as a side dish or invite guests to come help you eat it. We like spicy food, so we double the chipotle, and we add a pound of crumbled bacon. I also recommend having everything prepped before you start, because once you get into making the sauce, you don't have time to stop and measure ingredients.

I have spent years trying to find a homemade macaroni and cheese recipe that has some flavor to it. I finally found it! My husband raved about this during dinner and the next day too!

This was awesome! We used 3/4 the can of adobo chilis for a lot of spice and added crumbled bacon on top. Also used 3 tomato-chicken bouillon cubes (instead of five chicken).

AMAZING! Our grocery store didn't carry chipolte pepper so I used a 4oz can of Jalapeno's drained. SO WONDERFUL!

Amazing!!! To make this a more hearty main course, I only added about 3/4 of the noodles and 5-6 cooked and shredded chicken tenders. It was so good! We like things really spicy so I added 3 chipotle peppers. It was delicious, but we were both a little sweaty by the end of the meal. Definitely adding this to my regular rotation of dinner meals.

This isn't the mac and cheese you ate as a kid! Overall, very tasty, unique dish. I added extra chipotles and used all pepperjack for an extra kick.

The flavor is exactly as I had hoped--spicy, smoky, savory, and cheesy!  I made exactly as written and it was perfect for me, but would be a bit too spicy for my kids.  I think next time, I'll try using all  regularmonterey jack with the chipotle.  I topped mine with smoked paprika for color, and it was delicious!  Sprinkling with cheese would have made it too rich, I think.

I liked it but it was a bit too spicy for me. There was a LOT of cheese and cream added to it as well and although that made it creamy like I like, it was just almost too much. I'm not big on spicy but, I would recommend adding much more chipotle to this. It will give it more flavor otherwise, it may be too bland.

I made this for a big family Christmas.  I added a bit more chipotle peppers since I knew I wouldn't be using the rest of the can before it spoiled.  It was AWESOME!  So many compliments!  This is an adult-oriented mac & cheese.

Outstanding!!! I've only made mac&cheese from scratch once before and it was awful, but when I found this recipe I just knew I had to try it. My kids love spicy dishes so I added one extra chipotle pepper for a little more kick. I also left out the onion powder simply because I don't care for onions in any form. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing! We'll definitely be adding this to our regular dinner rotation. (and I'm considering adding it to the Thanksgiving menu as well!)

This was fantastic! It reminded me of gourmet macaroni and cheese you get at an upscale restaurant. I added an additional chipotle pepper and reduced the pepper jack cheese to ensure it wouldn't be too spicy for the kids. I was concerned that the kids wouldn't like it because they are loyal to kraft "mac n cheese" but they loved it! This will be a  family staple!

This was great!  We made it for a New Year's Eve party.  I used 2 chipotle peppers, omitted the pepper, and cut the onion powder in 1/2.  I also added some panko bread crumb with melted butter for the topping rather than additional cheese.  We'll definitely be having this again.

My family really enjoyed this.  I used 3 chipotle peppers but took out the majority of the seeds and it wasn't too hot at all.  I also used better than bullion instead of the bullion cubes and all Monterey Jack cheese instead of half pepper jack (was worried about too much heat for my kids).  I might try with half white cheddar next time.  Definitely a keeper and will make again.

Absolutely amazing!  This tasted better than pretty much any mac and cheese I've had in my entire life.  I used four peppers from the Adobo sauce and fresh grated cheeses.  Simply heavenly.  Paired well with pulled pork sandwiches.

This is now my favorite mac & cheese or should I say Chipotle Macaroni and Cheese. Doubled the chipotle and this came out perfect.

We served this to the whole family! Everyone came back for seconds and took home the leftovers. After changing the servings to 15 people we put in a whole can of chipotle peppers.  Definitely the right amount. For a little extra flavor we stirred in a pound of crispy bacon and because we like things with spice we added red pepper flakes and Tabasco to taste. Believe me this will not overpower or make it to spicy. This recipe will become a regular part of future BBQs and will be our go to for carrying to potluck dinners.

This is an excellent recipe! I made the mistake of adding extra chipotle peppers, thinking that my family likes their food spicy. But not that spicy!  Had I stuck to the recipe, it would have been perfect.  I'll make this again without deviating a bit.

I made one change by mistake... I forgot to add the cornstarch because it wasn't in the written directions, only located in the ingredients list.  I guess it didn't matter because it turned out great!  My sister thought it was a bit too spicy and I actually ate another pepper on the side with my dinner.  I will make it again and I will probably leave out the cornstarch again.

I made it exactly as the recipe indicated, with the exception that I increased each cheese by about 1/2.  I used only one chipotle pepper and that was sufficient to give the dish a good zing.  It was bordering on being too salty - next time I won't salt the noodles before cooking them.  Definitely a keeper

I changed the recipe.  Not because I didn't like the original but for convenience.  The original called for pepper jack, and one chipotle pepper (to taste).  I already had shredded cheddar so I used that.  More traditional anyway.  As a result of an anticipated lack of heat from not using pepper jack I used three chipotle peppers.  My family is also weight lifters and they want their protein so I threw in a pound of ground beef.  The results were excellent.  Enough heat to make it very interesting!

Followed the recipe as instructed but felt like it was missing but everyone else in my house thought it was great. Would have added breadcrumbs but didn't have any on hand.

The texture was good, but it was WAY too salty. I'm guessing from the bouillon cubes?

Super easy to make and it makes a lot. You can also freeze this bad boy for later chipotle'ing and it's just as good.  I added a few more chipotle's for an extra kick and it was just the right amount.

I adjusted to 3 servings and baked in a glass bowl.   I mostly followed as is except for using 2c. penne, 1.5 chipotles and an extra garlic clove.  I forgot to divide the half & half and used it all in the first step, so for the second I added 3 tsp. heavy whipping cream.  I tried paprika/chipotle powder and pepperjack on top but honestly I preferred the sauce alone.  The sauce was creamy and delicious, there was plenty but I wouldn't mind a little extra.  I can't imagine making the original serving size, the 3-serving made 4 bowlfuls.

I adapted the recipe to lower fat and had some lobster that I wanted to add to it.  I used fat free half and half, chipotle powder instead of the pepper and half of the cheese was reduced fat cheddar and the other half, havarti (to give that rich buttery feel).  For the chicken base I substituted Lobster base.  Made these into appy style small plates and topped each small plate with 1 tablespoon of the pepper jack cheese before baking.  Grumpy LOVED it.  Very creamy and awesome flavor from the lobster base!  The little bites of lobster in the dish just made it even more yummy!  I feel the original recipe without changes would be high on my list also!

Awesome recipe! I altered it a bit to serve for a party so it's not spicy for everyone! Instead of Chicken bouillon cubes I used 1 pk of Ramen Noodles seasoning for creamy chicken + 3/4 cup of chicken broth (it was what I had in stock). I used regular sharp cheddar cheese blocks (2) along with 1/2 pack of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Once I cooked and drained my noodles I put them in a pan and sprinkled about 3 tsp of light salt and added 3 raw eggs (scrambled) to the noodles. In small pot I did my cheese mixture with half & half, 2 blocks of sharp cheddar cheese cut up, chicken seasoning packet I mentioned above & chicken broth, 3 tbsp of corn starch (Cream brand was what I had in stock), 2 tsp of red pepper on low heat until it formed a thick mixture. Then poured over the noodles, mixed it well then I and added chives and 2 cups of shredded cheese. Then you just add light salt or salt to your liking! Topped with remaining shredded cheese and paprika. LOVED IT!

What a great recipe. This was the first mac n cheese from scratch I've ever made. I made it for my 6 year anniversary dinner and we were very happy. If you prefer a creamier macaroni you can omit the baking all together. This is a great base recipe as well because it's so simple. I have made it without the chipotle several times to make it kid friendly and they love it.

Great!  I made half the recipe (only 2 of us) and still added one whole chipotle pepper (we like it spicy!)  Also used only pepper jack.  Great twist on the traditional mac-n-cheese.

I only used 4 of the 5 suggested boullion cubes, and it was still overwhelmingly salty. The flavor overpowered the chipotle. Next time I'd only use 2 cubes. Also, they tore up my food processor - I would add them straight to the cream mixture on the stove rather than blending. Chipotle is of course to taste, but if it's a flavor you enjoy I'd do at least two.

This is how macaroni and cheese should always be!!! So delicious! I can’t eat the plain stuff anymore, haha! I did the 1/2 monterey jack, 1/2 pepperjack but had to add 1 more chile and LOTS of spicy adobo sauce to the cheese mixture in order to taste the heat. I think next time I will probably try all pepperjack cheese and 2-3 chiles total. I took the suggestion of others and fried a pound of bacon to “crumble” on top, then added a layer of breadcrumbs and then sprinkled smoked paprika on top of that. Soooooo good!! It is rich and decadent, smokey, spicy, warm and stick-to-your-ribs good!! I might try adding chicken next time as some others have done for a complete meal. And it will definitely be going on my Thanksgiving menu for next year!!!

So I went to a smoke-out challenge with the top brisket,pulled pork, etc smoker masters in the world and one of the vendors was selling chipotle Mac and cheese (odd) and I have been trying to recreate it ever since. Let me first say that I have made this more than a few times - as the recipe is stated it is delicious. 5 stars. If you are like me and like heat, I will tell you that even adding 2 chipotle peppers to the recipe rather than 1 didn’t even get a comment from my 7 year old who complains if something had too much pepper even. Kids love it and it’s great. If you really want to spice it up -  use three Chiles and a pinch of cayenne Into the sauce  before adding the cheese(only takes a pinch) and then finish it off in the smoker rather than the oven. You will be in for an unbelievable treat and never would you have thought anyone would compliment Mac and cheese so much. Killer recipe killer Mac thank you for sharing it

Was delish!!! I didn’t add all of the chipotle peppers as not all of my family enjoy the loveliness of spicy. I would bake it more 20-25 min. I took my batch out a little late and it became a tiny bit dry. Still delicious though! Love this recipe! I’ll be making it again!

Great recipe! I have made this many times to clear out any leftover cheese in the fridge. I usually have some odds and ends of smoked cheddar or gruyere that I will mix in with the Monterrey Jack and pepper jack cheese. In addition, I add pan fried sliced links of andouille sausage at the same time as the pasta. Finally, I have used roasted garlic cloves in place of minced fresh garlic to add more depth to the flavor. I always get rave reviews with this recipe with or without my modifications. Easy to make, and perfect comfort food for young and old cheese lovers!

to be fair, I only used the "cheese sauce" portion of this recipe, and then put it with a baked  broccoli and rice casserole that I created. I just had to rate this anyway cuz I was pleasantly surprised that after baking in the oven for an hour at 350* this cheese sauce was still creamy! And this was never mixed into the rest of the casserole. I covered everything with this cream sauce.  I know if I had made a "normal" white sauce made with flour as a base It would have been a totally different outcome. oh, i did replace all  the cheese with Velveeta, so maybe that made the difference.   Yes, it was flavorful ( even without the peppers and all that spicy stuff--- just as a plain cheese sauce it was outstanding.  Yes, I will make the recipe as written one day and review that, too~

Oh. My. Gosh. This stuff is AWESOME!!! I made it according to the directions minus the onion powder, because I didn't have any, and I cut the amounts in half (just me and the hubby). This reminded me of the shrimp fettuccine we get at our local Cajun restaurant! So, so, so good! I opted for a crushed cracker with butter topping with a little smoked paprika mixed in. Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was a good start, but we will modify next time. It was a little too rich, so I will substitute milk for some of the 1/2 and 1/2 and reduce the amount of cheese next time.  I will also add some sauteed onion and green pepper to give it a little texture. We did like the chipotle heat and will add a little more next time as well.

I reduced the serving size since I only cook for 2, but I only reduced the cheese to 1 cup (and sprinkled a little more ok top before baking). I also added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes before the mix went into the oven. Don't ask why, but we LOVE spicy food in our house. Overall, this is the best Mac and cheese I've ever had.

Was quite a tasty dish, what I did to try this recipe was cut the ingredients list in half. Threw everything together that was called for, but added for my own liking crushed red pepper, dash of paprika, twice the chipotle (I like spicy), a jalapeno, 1/2 lb of ground beef and 3 strips of minced bacon. turned out to be rather delicious.

Very delicious and easy to follow. I usually don't change recipes or add to them, but I think every Mac and cheese needs some bacon added to it. I also added some bread crumbs on top. At one pepper, it wasn't that spicy. I'd definitely use two peppers next time or maybe add a chopped up jalapeño when blending.

This is a very good dish!  Cheesy and creamy with a nice kick, but not too spicy at the same time.  I have made this a few times using 3 chipotle peppers as well as adding about a generous tablespoon of the adobo sauce.  I have also added a 10oz can of shredded chicken to give it some meat so it could pass as a dinner.  I stirred in the chicken right before it went in the baking dish and it turned out great!

Halved recipe, used 2% milk, 1/2 Teaspoon chicken bouillon, 1 +1/2 chipotle peppers, 1 cup colby jack and 1 cup velveta. Topped with sliced deli American cheese I tore up that I had on hand and a little paprika. I think you could change the cheese up with your favorite. Made for Lent and we will not miss any meat with this beauty! Best Mac & Cheese Ever!

I love all Mac and Cheese but unfortunately my husband does not so I was thrilled that he liked this recipe! Some changes I make: 1) I use 2 cups nonfat half and half and 1 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt (I do not notice any difference than the first time I made this with the quart of half and half 2) I use 2 chipotle peppers (seeded) and a spoonful of sauce from the can since we really like the chipolte flavor (this does increase the spice though so beware!)

I really liked the flavor of this. I used hot peppers instead of the chipotle ones. Next time I think I will just make the sauce in one pan and not mess with the processor as that was a mess. I will also use uncooked noodles verses cooked as even with them just a little undercooked I feel it was too mushy. I am thinking more sauce too. Just feel it was a tad dry and mushy but the flavor was awesome.

Made this the other night. It was wonderful. I couldn't find the chipotle peppers so used chipotle powder instead. Next time I think I will add some chopped jalapeños and bacon as well.

Just okay. Way too salty. Should have only put in 3 bouillion cubes. Also, definitely do not add breadcrumbs as some have suggested, unless you like a grainy texture.

This was just fantastic. Make exactly as is if you can. I had to sub a lot (which I normally don't do) but I will make again and again. The chipotle was key. I subbed mozzarella and cheddar because that's all I had and I substituted for half and half and bouillon as follows: 1 c chicken broth, 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 nonfat Greek yogurt. Still tasted restaurant quality and was the right consistency. Yum!

This mac and cheese was really yummy. It's got a great creamy consistency and was a huge crowd pleaser at the party I took it to. While it's really a great recipe, it seemed to me like it was missing something. I can't put my finger on it, but there is a flavor that wasn't there, maybe a bit more chipotle pepper?

I've been searching for a good homemade mac n cheese recipe, most haven't been quite good enough.  This one may make it into the final round.  One chipotle pepper is definitely not enough, I used 2 and would probably use another if I make it again.  When mixing the half and half, peppers, bouillon and garlic, I processed for awhile, let it sit for a couple minutes so the bouillon could dissolve a little bit and then finished processing.  Also, on top I used breadcrumbs instead of cheese or paprika.  Next time I may mix breadcrumbs, a little parmesan cheese and a smidge of paprika.  Pretty good mac n cheese!

This was wonderful! I used a mixture of Monterey Jack, mozzarella, and pepper jack cheeses. I was worried it would be too spicy for my children (I LOVE spicy food). But the end result was a little spicy with a LOT of flavor!

as far as mac and cheese goes this was delicious.  I used 1% milk instead of half and half and an assortment of cheese I had left over from a party to include swiss, feta, Havarti, montery jack, Colby, munster, and chedder as well as some parmesean.  I also put sliced chicken breast in it and crumbled corn chips on top.  AAAAAMMMMAZZING!!!!

I did 1 cup of pepper jack and 3 cups of Monterey Jack (rather than 2 and 2), and it was still pretty darn spicy. I ended up using 12 ounces of pasta rather than a full pound, so I didn't pour all the cheese into the dish, but we ended up using the leftover sauce as a dip for tortilla chips...yum!  Overall, we really enjoyed it, but don't serve it to little ones and expect them to inhale it like they do Kraft Mac & Cheese...too spicy by far to my little Texans.

This was awesome. One chipotle seemed to be the perfect heat for me. I also added vegan sausages to it, to "beef" it up. Quite delicious.

Very dry. Not creamy at all.  The cheese mixed with tomato and chipotle flavor didn't go together on this recipe
