My family loved this drink! I only used 3 lemons and 3 limes. I didn't want it to be too tart and I am glad I did. Also, I used green tea. It's very refreshing and smells so good too.

Interesting taste. I believe this will be popular with the adults since it's not overly sweet.

Refreshing tea with a bit of tartness, and not overly sweet. Would make again.

It was way too minty for my taste. maybe my mint sprigs were larger than average. I am going to add more limes in an attempt to fix it.
