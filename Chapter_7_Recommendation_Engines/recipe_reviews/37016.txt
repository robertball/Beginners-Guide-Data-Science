Very easy to make.  I whipped these up the night before and let them rise overnight in the refrigerator after forming the rolls.  My kids said these were the best rolls I've ever made.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

These turned out wonderful.  I substituted some whole wheat flour for the white flour to make them a little healthier.  They were very soft and moist.  My boyfriend and I ate them up in less than 1 day.

I thought these were really good but a little too chewy and doughy on the bottom for us.  I think I am going to lower the oven temp and bake these longer to achieve the perfect rolls for my familys tastes

These rolls were great!  This recipe could easily make 50 rolls, just make the balls 1" in diameter, rather than 1 1/2".  I used 3 c. bread flour and 1 c. whole wheat flour rather than 4 c. all-purpose flour and they were excellent.  You could not taste the oatmeal at all but they were very moist. When kneading the bread I ended up adding probably about 1 c. of flour in order that the dough would not be as sticky to work with. Will make these often.

Wow! My sis-in-law wanted to "raise the bar" of her Thanksgiving bash and have it be a little more Martha Stewart. Oh no. I looked around for a new roll recipe and tried this one. These were so darn fab! They are heavy and soft and were very popular. There were no leftovers to be found! I've also given platefuls of these as thank you gifts. I always make a double batch which fits perfectly into three 13x9 pans. I like the overnight idea someone mentioned and the wheat flour idea. I'll try them both! Oh, and these are easy to make.

Wonderful rolls!  These were moist, slightly sweet heavy rolls and my husband loved them!  I used 5 tsp. of bread machine yeast instead of packaged and they had a wonderful consistency.  I also added more brown sugar and only stirred the ingredients together instead using the mixer.  And everthing still turned out great.

This is a great "something from nothing" recipe, easy to make and really tasty. They came out perfect and soft, even when I reheated a few the next morning. (Remember to sift your flour or they'll come out like little rocks.)

These were good rolls!  I made half a batch and got 16 rolls.  The only change is that I used old-fashioned oats instead of quick oats and just cooked them a little longer.  Next time I'll bake them for an extra couple of minutes or let them rise a little longer the second time to ensure that the insides aren't doughy.  I'll definitely make these again!

These were fantastic.  I just finished a test batch before making these to contribute to a dinner party.  Like others I used old-fashioned oats and cooked longer and used the dough hook on my mixer for 4 minutes and then finished kneading by hand.  I rolled each 1/2 of the dough into a rectangle with a pin and then rolled up the dough into a log before cutting into 16 pieces.  I shaped into balls by gently stretching and tucking the dough to avoid over-warming and over-working it.  (Perhaps this may help some who had difficulty with the texture of the finished product.)

These will be made on a regular basis in my kitchen.

excellent recipe--and so easy to make--I would probably bake them as individual rolls next time as we are crusty bread lovers--other than that I wouldn't change a thing

wow! what delicious rolls! I changed this to 24 servings but actually got 16 large dinner rolls.  I made the oatmeal, and cooled it to room temperature, then layered the ingredients in my bread machine. I also added about a tsp of bread improver (not sure if it needed it or not).  I used the dough cycle through the first rise, then shaped by hand and let the dough rise again.  These were so easy and are just as perfect as can be!

These were very yummy and soft!  Be sure to use a thermometer when checking the temp of the water to add to the yeast - the recipe calls it warm, but it's actually hot water, and it makes all the difference in whether the roll is too dense or not.

I'm a bread baker from way back, and these rolls are fabulous!  I've made them twice for dinners with friends, and everyone wants the recipe.  Extra pans freeze and reheat well, too.

WONDERFUL recipe!!  I halved it, since we couldn't eat 32 rolls before they go stale.  I also used old-fashioned oats, since I didn't have any quick cooking.  The rolls came out fine!

I followed the recipe exactly and these rolls turned out great.  They are very moist.  Since the recipe makes 2 pans full of rolls, I put one in the freezer for later. The batch from the freezer seemed to taste even better when we ate them about 2 weeks later.  My kids love them!

This is a keeper, soft and light. Makes a boatload of rolls. Made the dough in the bread machine, and it mushroomed out of the top! They were still quite good a day or two after baking. Thanks for submitting!

I give the rolls a 5 but I think I'd give the directions about a 3.  First, if you use 4 cups of flour and mix it all with a mixer, you will end up with a very, very soft dough.  Unless southern AP flour is a lot drier than northern AP flour, I'd guess you are going to add 3/4 to 1 1/2 extra cups of flour in the kneading process.  I used my dough hook to knead, added 3/4 c. flour while kneading and still ended up with a very soft dough.  (I love to knead by hand but this was just too soft and sticky).  Second, I'm still not sure if I am reading the directions right but it looks like they are putting 16 rolls in each 9" cake pan.  If so, your rolls will be very "squashed"  I divided my dough in half and made one-half into dinner rolls.  I started out with a 9" cake pan but they seemed too crowded so I switched them to an 11" diameter deep dish stoneware pizza pan and that was better.  The rolls were delicious and the stone made them "crusty" but some of the rolls still seemed squashed.  I used the other 1/2 of the dough to make 8 nice-sized raspberry cinnamon rolls -- yum.  Moist and not too heavy.  These rolls are heavier than my favorite dinner roll recipe but one of the big advantages is a fairly short first and second rise.  I'll definitely keep the recipe handy and will experiment with pan sizes.

I have been making these rolls for 3 years now.  They get better each time.  I have passed the recipe on many times.  Don't change a thing.  They are moist and wonderful for days.  Even my extended family who loves white bread enjoys these rolls.  They are also very easy.  It helps if you have a large stand mixer.  The dough will be sticky when you take it out of the mixer.  Just gently kneed in more flour.  No need to try other roll recipes.

I like the idea of this recipe, and the rolls looked beautiful, but they weren't done in the middle. I am not sure what I did wrong, and would be willing to try this recipe again. I love the fact that they have oatmeal in them.

Thanks for the incredible recipe!  So easy.  I baked them on my new pizza stone and they were delicious!!  Contrary to what others have said, I can taste the oatmeal -- subtle, but there.

Awesome rolls!  As per another poster, I used milk in place of the water.  I brought it to a boil in the microwave and then added it to the oatmeal and butter over the stove top.  I doubled the recipe and had no problems.  Very fast, very simple, very good...what more could you ask for!  They were devoured at out Thanksgiving dinner.

Excellent hot, excellent cold, excellent-excellent 3 days old!  These rolls are without a doubt, by far, the best I have ever eaten - they just don't get any better than this!  I love them with honey butter, salted butter, hot ham and cheese, jam, chicken salad, or just plain without anything on them at all.  The subtle sweetness of this soft, easy to work with dough serves as a fabulous base for cinnamon rolls too.  Highly Recommended - you simply must try them!

hot and steamy rolls, but very moist dough, needing 1/2 to 1 cup additional flour. I used bread flour. Had a strong yeasty flavor that might benefit from the addition of herbs. But otherwise, a good bread to go along with traditional American cuisine.

I made this in a 9 x 5 pan instead of making dinner rolls. I baked it at 375 for about 33 minutes. I used half whole wheat flour, 2 T. of gluten, and 2 T. of dry milk powder. I think the bread should have more salt, maybe 1 t.

I made these for 4th of July...they had a nice dense texture that went great with barbeque and baked beans.  I made them larger than the recommended size, but just lowered oven temp to 300 F and kept them in for 30 minutes instead of 15.  They are great the next morning with homemade butter and applebutter.

My husband said, "You need to keep track of that recipe," after having these rolls with a steak supper last night! Because I live in the arid high desert, I use less flour in my breads, so it did not bother me that even after 4 cups of flour the dough was pretty sticky. I just floured up my hands really well before handling it. I made one loaf of bread and 8 dinner rolls with this recipe. The 8 rolls fit perfectly into a 9 1/2 inch pie plate.

These rolls are absolutely fabulous. My family always requests them for holidays, they are almost as delicious as the dinner rolls my grams used to make.  I find that they are tastiest if you add a couple extra tablespoons of brown sugar and when you mix the dough let it stay pretty sticky (it's tempting to want to keep adding flour) I have even used a large spoon to evenly drop the dough into the pans and they come out delicious and look nice

I have been making these rolls for a few years now.  They are by far the best.  My family loves these and everywhere I take them I get requests for the recipe.  The only thing I do differently is that I bake them on my 10x18 baking sheet.  I get 30 nice size, beautiful rolls that way.

About 10 years ago I wanted to make homemade rolls for thanksgiving.  I failed horribly.  I tried again this year with these...and they were wonderful.  SO easy and so good.  I used half wheat floor, and they were perfect.

This recipe was easy, and the results were excellent.  I halved the recipe and instead of kneading by hand, I used my mixer with the dough hook for 5 minutes.  I used old fashioned oats and cooked them for @ 3 minutes.  No one could believe they had oatmeal in them.  Will make again for company.

I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking, i just cooked them a little bit longer.  The rolls came out so chewy and tender, I have replaced my old dinner rolls recipe with this one!

These were great!  I was cooking for 2, so I cut the recipe in half, but I wish I'd made a full batch!  Also, I accidentally made 8 rolls instead of 16, and that worked fine, they were just big.  I used 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour (in the halved recipe) and will probably do that again.

This was one of the best dinner roll recipes I have ever tried!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and they were fabulous!  I took them to Thanksgiving dinner, and they were a big hit.  They are even good the next day.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  I know I will make these again and again.

My daughter and I attempted these dinner rolls to bring with us for Thanksgiving dinner.  I was a little nervous.  They turned out wonderful.  Will use this recipe again.  So easy, I am not sure now why it has taken me so long to try homemake rolls.

no complaints!  I was craving some sort of dinner roll and saw this one and whipped it up!  They were really good!  I cut the recipe in half, mixed it all by hand and it still was great!  So good hot from the oven with real butter and good today cold with chicken salad!  Very versatile and made me feel like I was being a little healthy with the oatmeal in the roll!  Just don't count the melted butter!!  VEry good and easy!!! Thanks!

This is a good recipe.  I made a few changes though, instead of water, I boiled milk and added butter.  And put less white sugar and added brown sugar.  We couldn't eat enough of it.

These rolls tasted just ordinary to me.  I don't know if it is because I made the dough in the bread machine or what.  They tasted yeasty and slightly bitter.  I don't t hink I will make again.

These rolls are excellent, the best I have made from this site. Baking them together in the cake pan was a wonderful idea and added to the texture. They have great flavor. I even left out the brown sugar by mistake, and they were still wonderful. I can't wait to make another batch with the sugar.

Very nice rolls. Dense, but by no means heavy. I did have to add 1 and 1/2 cups more flour. The dough was still soft. (It's a dry day, too.) My husband loved them. The recipe made 56 ounces of dough, so next time I might half it to make in the bread machine. I'll make again.

Great Recipe and couldn't have been easier. This was my first attempt at breadmaking,  and I have made this recipe 3 times now with excellent results. This last time I increased the Brown sugar quite a bit for a slightly sweeter taste and found I prefer it that way. I think This is definitely a keeper.

I printed this recipe a couple of years ago and kept meaning to try it. Finally got around to it today and oh goodness wish I had tried it sooner. Mixed and kneaded them in my food processor so it couldn't have been easier. They rose beautifully, smelled great cooking and taste awesome. I'll be making these again!

These were so good!  I followed the recipe exactly and then brushed the tops with melted butter when I took them out of the oven.  The best part of them though, was that they were still SO soft and tender the next day!

This is the best bread recipe.  I made these for the first time on Thanksgiving.  They are great on their own but magical with the Honey Butter recipe on this site.  My 9 year old nephew ate 5.  I have already made them twice this week for coworkers and they have been requested at the family dinner on Sunday.  I used regular oats (all I had on hand)and cooked them an extra minute and sifted all my dry ingredients together.  The last time I made them I only used a tablespoon of butter and there was no change.  No eggs, no oil, minimal butter - THANK YOU SOUTHERN LIVING!

My boyfriend made these to go with our Thanksgiving meal.  We didn't change any of the ingredients.  He said that they were more trouble than they were worth making.  The flavor was good, but they were a bit heavy, maybe too heavy for such a large meal.  I don't think we'll be doing these again.

I made these for the first time tonight and served them to guests.  Everyone loved them, including me!  My dough was very wet so I had to incorporate 1/2 - 1 cup more flour when I kneaded it.

Theses rolls were absolutely delicious! I made them exactly as the instructions stated & they came out beautifully. My three kids wolfed them too, always a plus with a new recipe. Will definitely be making them again.

Excellent rolls.  Stayed very moist and looked as good as those you may get in a restaurant.  I also may try subing with some wheat flour to add even more fiber & keep them nice and wholesome.  And were excellent the next day also.  Didn't feel bad eating these.  Felt like I was upping the fiber intake.

I had to add a little more flour because its pretty sticky, but the texture and flavor turned out great.  I bet this would be great in a loaf.

They were a bit too heavy and took longer to bake than expected, but not bad.  However, there are better recipes out there, I probably will not make them again.

Excellent!  I have had little experience working with yeast, but these turnd out very well.  A little smaller than I expected, but that is nothing compared to the taste.  They are just as moist and tender as can be!

I was asked to bring rolls to a family dinner and these were a hit!  I used regular oats and let the dough rise a little longer than the times on the recipe.  The rolls ended up smaller than I would have liked but were moist and tasty.

These were really great with butter--I halved the recipe and then wished I hadn't!  These were good left over too.
