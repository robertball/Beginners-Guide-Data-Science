This is a good basic recipe.  Precooking the ham bone before adding the beans works well.

The flavor was fabulous, but even though I left out some of the broth and added a little extra ham it was way too soupy for me. Will make again, but I need to remember to cut back on the liquid because I prefer a thicker soup.
