This is the best waffle we've ever eaten, except 2 Tablespoons of milk doesn't work.  2 CUPS of milk works great!

WOW! Excellent flavor - even better toasted the next day! Nice and CRISPY on the outside.  My son LOVED these and he is a very pick breakfast eater. I added a little more cinnamon to suit his taste, these are a keeper in my family. Thanks!

MMmmm- the smell these made while cooking!  Yummy and light texture but very filling.  I made the following modifications:  I needed almost 1 c of milk total!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I added a pinch of salt, wheat bran and oat bran.  They had a great flavor!  Will definitely make again.

I used less pancake mix and more WW flour. The flavor of this was mild. I was hoping for more maple walnut goodiness. But the kids did not care they ate them all up!

These have great flavor, i did have to add another cup of milk, i used almond milk.  Mine were crumbly.  I didnt let them get crispy in the waffle iron, mabye that would have made a difference.  The next time i make these I will put an egg in it, very good though~

I give this four stars only because you do need to add a bit of milk. Atleast 1/2c possibly more. After that it has a wonderful flavor.

I gave it two stars only because the flavor was decent. However, the batter is so thick that it makes the waffles very heavy. I would add an egg, add at least 1 cup of milk extra (or even more) and use only 2 cups of the dry pancake mix. I wouldn't make this again.

You need to use 2 cups of milk! If you do, you won't be disappointed! We love these waffles, they are crispy, they freeze up well and best of all they are eggless. We also just use 3 full cups of pancake mix instead of using whole wheat flour. This is our go to waffle recipes, only gave it 4 stars because of the milk typo in the recipe.

I used my own homemade waffle mix. I had read through the reviews before I made this recipe, so I knew to add more milk than what the recipe called for. For me, this needed almost 3/4 of a cup more milk and honestly, I think this could have used more. The flavor of these was great but the texture was off because of the overmixing and the need for more liquid. I'll try these again (because I think this could be an excellent waffle recipe) but I would use 1 1/2-2 cups of milk next time and cut out the water completely.

I initially found the batter to be too thick, and a little dry. I added an egg, plus an additional 1/2 cup of milk. These changes produced the desired result. Each waffle turned out perfectly, crispy on the outside, as promised.  I will make them again.

Thanks Jane for your comment.  I am glad I wasn't going crazy, as I kept re-reading the recipe to make sure I didn't get it wrong.  The milk measurement must be a typo!  More milk is a must.  Delicious!

Excellent taste and texture.  I added crumbled crisp bacon to the top of the batter before I flipped the waffle iron.  My waffle connoisseur boys (hubby and son)loved them as a change of pace from my usual souped-up box mix.  I gave only 4 stars because of the batter consistency with the original recipe.  I added an additional cup of milk and could have probably added another 1/2 to 1 cup but didn't want to overshoot and make too runny the first time.

I like this recipes because it doesn't have eggs. I used rice milk instead of cow's. I had to add MUCH more water & milk to create a "pourable" batter. The waffles were a fairly crunchy coming out of the waffle baker. Flavor was a little bland but acceptable for an egg-less recipes.
