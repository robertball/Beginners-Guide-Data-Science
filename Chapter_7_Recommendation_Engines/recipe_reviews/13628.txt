This cookie created conflict. They were so good I wanted to share them and made up a plate for my husband to take to his parent's house. But they were so good he kept insisting I only put a few on the plate and made it clear that he would not be held responsible if they were gone before his family got some. 

Just fantastic.

These were good! My first batch was a little flat, so I added a touch more flour and that did the trick. I let each batch cool for 5 minutes before moving to serving tray and had no problems with cookies falling apart.

These are some of the best cookies I've made in a long time! Followed the recipe exactly, and you can really taste the coffee flavour. LOVE THEM!

This recipe came out wonderful!  I added about 1/2 cup extra flour, and susbtituted white chocolate chips for the walnuts, as I did no have any on hand.  Over all an instant classic with my famiy.

I make cookies constantly and have a huge recipe collection of which my husband and son have all tried through my persistence.  My son has become so fussy he won't eat cookies anymore but for some reason when I sent them to his College, he and the kids raved about them and asked for them again (and these were one kind out of 16 kinds that I have sent through the months). I will be making this recipe often in the future now that I have found a favorite.  Thank you.

This is a really nice mocha cookie where you can taste the coffee.  I used unsalted butter and found the salt in the cookie noticeable.  If I was using salted butter I would cut back on the amount of salt called for.

Really good and really easy to make. I halved the recipe but still used a whole egg and these came out cracked on the top like a gingersnap, but with a soft and chewy/flakey texture. Kind of hard to explain but really easy to eat!

This is just what I've been looking for, I read the reviews and I too added 1/2 cup more flour as I do not like thin crisp cookies. I also added a handful of toffee bits....They came out just perfect I got 75 nice size cookies Thank You

I gave this recipe 4 stars because the flavor is good, however, the recipe doesn't state how far apart to place the cookies.  The picture makes it appear that the cookies don't spread much, but they do.  I made the recipe twice, but they spread to very thin height.  I would put the balls at least 3 inches apart until you see how much they spread.  Next time, I'm going to add another 1/2 cup of flour.

So delicious! This recipe is going into my favorites! I did not have instant coffee so used strong brewed coffee and also part bittersweet chocolate for the semisweet chocolate.

THis were tasty...however, I agree with some that say not much mocha flavor....next time I will add lots more.  After dropping on the cookie sheet I placed in the freezer for about 10 min before baking...that keeps them from going flat.

These cookies are OK - the recipe is off, though. I had to add more flour - about 1/4 cup. I love coffee taste, but i would reduce the coffee to 1 tbsp.

Aside from me messing up the directions, the flavor of the cookies was really good, a nice light coffee flavor. I will definitely try this again for Christmas.

These were WONDERFUL! I made a double batch (48 servings) and my family of 10 ate 2 dozen before the next two pans were even out of the ovens! I added 1/2 cup extra flour, as another reviewer suggested. I can see why they would spread a lot if you stuck to the original recipe... so it's a matter of personal preference if you want large, thin cookies or small, thick ones. :)  I'm so glad I tried this recipe, it is our new favorite! Highly recommend!!!!

I first made these cookies from a Better Homes and Gardens Christmas magazine in 2001.  They added toffee pieces to the batter which was very yummy. I added melted chocolate drizzles on top for presentation.  I lost the recipe and was so glad to find this version today. They are a real winner!

This is a good recipe, the cookies turned out great.  I bumped up the chocolate flavor by adding 1/4 dark cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.  This one is a keeper!

Wow!  These cookies are amazing!  My husband doesn't care for nuts in baked goods so I left them out but they were still wonderful!  I work at Starbucks, so I used 2 little packs of the VIA ready brew Italian roast.  It worked great!  I think we will be baking these up and giving them away at Christmas!

Loved these! They had just the right amount of coffee flavour. I added a little more flour because the dough seemed a little too wet, but other than that I made as written. These are disappearing very quickly from the cookie jar.

These were fantastic! I added  1/4 cup more of flour like some reviews suggested and they came out nice and full. Also added 1 1/2 tsp of coco powder and 1 tsp of vanilla and a little more nuts then it called for. Will be making these again!

I made these for the first time last year.  They are now my son's favorite cookie. 

I did make a few changes as we all prefer dark chocolate and less sweet.  I always double the recipe.  I used dark chocolate chips and reduce the unmelted chips by 1/2 cup. I also reduce the white sugar by 1/2 cup. Finally, I add a few drops of real vanilla extract.

I love anything with coffee in it and these are so delicious!

When I followed the recipe exactly, these cookie were nothing spectacular. However, the other day I went back and made a few adjustments. 
__________________________
I used about 1 1/2 cups for flour, maybe a little more. I found that that original dough was very runny and wet, and because of this, the cookies came out very flat and dark. When I added the extra flour, the cookies looked exactly like the ones in the picture. Pretty and fluffy.

Also, I used 4 tbs of ground coffee, and I didn't dissolve it, I just poured them straight into the bowl. Doing that gave it a delicious coffee flavor, and with the original amount of chocolate chips, it made perfectly sweet chocolate chip cookies - absolutely delicious. I also omitted the walnuts, because I'm not a fan of nuts in chocolate cookies.

Made these for Christmas. Followed others' suggestions, adding 1/2 c. extra flour and chilling dough for an hour before baking. Got 48 nice,round cookies. Had to sample for myself and found they were a rich, dark chocolate, perfect with coffee or mocha hot chocolate!

They tasted amazing! But were really really flat!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, but I have no clue what went wrong. I followed someone's advice in the comments here and added a little flower...that seemed to do the trick!

I love these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and then put batter in fridge overnight and they did not flatten out very much at all.  I have to hurry up and start giving them away before I eat all of them by myself.

I made these without the walnuts because my husband doesn't like nuts. As far as the mocha part, we couldn't taste the coffee at all. We could tell there was something else in the cookie, but not that it was necessarily coffee. Mine turned out flat, but tasted like the best double chocolate cookies ever!

Soooo good!  Everyone said these were the best cookies they had ever tried.  I have a convection oven, the first batch cookies baked at 350F turned out flat, I reduced it to 325F for the 2nd batch and the cookies were perfect.

These are pretty yummy, but both hubby and I thought they needed tweaking, but we disagree on what they need.  I think they need to be a tad sweeter and the coffee taste toned down, and thought they needed to be softer and were a tad too dry; hubby says keep the coffee taste and tone down the sweetness.  I omitted the walnuts because we aren't a "nutty cookie" family.  I really like the concept of them, but they weren't what I was expecting.  They aren't bad at all, but I doubt I will make them again, and will probably try some other similar recipes.

My 97 year old mom in long term care snarfed these up... 3 before dinner and continues to remind me how good they are. Like others, I added the extra 1/4th cup flour . I believe this wouldn’t be needed if the ingredients weren’t too warm... such as the butter, melted chips, diluted coffee. My second batch was almost too thick with the cooler ingredients. I didn’t add the walnuts. I used the Starbucks Via for intense coffee flavor... used parchment paper for baking with convection oven . They were somewhat crispy which was to my liking by baking a bit longer.

I’ve made this cookie many times. It’s one of our favorite recipes. I melt and add all of the choc at the same time. Makes a darker cookie and very rich. Yummy. Great recipe!

Based on the reviews, I added 1/4 of flour and the cookies were puffy & did not spread much. I thought these were a little too sweet. I would decrease the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup next time or decrease the amount of sugar. I took them to a Christmas party & everyone loved them.

Good, but far too sweet for us, and I don't get a strong coffee flavor.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar and increase the amount of coffee and see how they are.  Didn't want to dirty all those dishes / bowls so melted the chocolate with the butter and coffee (with the water, but not boiling) in the microwave.  Let it cool a bit, whisked in the sugars and the egg and then combined with the dry ingredients.  Two bowls, done!

Good coffee flavor that adds richness to an ordinary chocolate chip cookie. The walnuts compliment the coffee taste. Quite sweet.

Added 1/2 cup flour to total as recommended. These cookies are soooooooo delicious! My husband said they were the best cookies I ever made and I've been cooking and baking for over 40 years!
Other than the flour I followed the directions exactly. I may just try adding 1 tsp of vanilla the next time to see if they could possibly taste even better. 
I used parchment paper, air bake cookie sheets and let them cool on the sheets for five minutes or so.

Delicious with a cup of coffee! I made these cookies as written with just a few changes. I added a 1/2 cup of extra flour as per other reviewers suggestions, I refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours before baking and I substituted pecans for walnuts. Mine turned out puffy with a crispy outside and a soft chewy inside. I will make them again.

These cookies were really good!  They have a very strong coffee flavor really stands out.  My family is not a fan of nuts in cookies so I left out the walnuts.

These are wonderful! Exactly what my sweet tooth was looking for. Mine came out a flatter than the picture but I think it's the age of my baking soda.

Go ahead and double this recipe, you'll be glad you did.  Makes a nice chocolately cookie.  The mocha was not too strong in my first attempt.  I might play around with Kahula in another attempt.

Mmmm...these are GOOD!  My husband just ran off with a plate to share with the guys at our automotive shop.  Usually he's not big on sweets, but these are addicting!  :)  I'll be making these again and again!

Delicious! I substituted the melted chocolate with some Ghiradelli hot chocolate mix by adding not quite 1/2 cup right into the sugars. The cookies turned out amazing. They didn't last very long at my house.
