This dish is sooooooo good, I highly recommend it! You might as well print it and put it in your recipe box right away because you will love it. All of the ingredients are things I keep around so no need to scramble for a strange item. These are the changes I made: 1.) I used fresh chicken broth instead of using the water and the bouillion. 2.) I used some salty kalamata olives instead of the canned kind 3.) I omitted the salsa topping and the cinnamon. This was a TOTAL crowd pleaser for myself, my picky husband and 1 year old.

Fantastic flavor!  I used chicken broth instead of bullion and water because that is what I had.  I also mixed the cumin, cinnamon, and chili powder together before I added them to the dish so that the flavors spread evenly throughout the dish. I didn't add the picante at the end becuase I wantd to taste  all the spices more than the picante, but it was on the table if anyone wanted it. Things I will modify next time: I may add a little extra chicken broth because the rice was not cooked in forty minutes.  I had to cook it a lot longer, which made my chicken dry.  Overall, the dish was very good.

Great recipe - the chicken is tender and moist and the rice is bursting with flavor! Just a few tips on preparation: I brine the chicken breasts in cool salt water in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before baking. I also dredged them in flour/salt/pepper before browning them in the oil. Finally, it took more water than the recipe called for in order to get the rice sufficiently tender and fluffy. ENJOY!

This recipe was fantastic!  I only made small changes, such as cutting the chicken breasts into strips so they browned/baked faster, I omitted the bullion, because I used a packaged Spanish rice, I added a can of rinsed pinto beans to up the fiber/nutrition factor, I omitted the cinnamon, and I omitted the picante sauce and black olives, but added sliced jalapeno on top of the cheese.  I served with sour cream and pureed avocado on the side.  Added a great dimension to the dish.  My VERY picky family loved it and I'm sure it'll be a regular on our table for years to come.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this without olives and with chicken broth rather than water and bouillon cubes. It was easy to put together and very tasty. Definitely going into the regular dinner menu rotation!

This was just okay.  I wished I had pounded and marinated the chicken and if I ever make this again, I will add a ton more chopped green pepper and onions to the rice mixture.  I used a mild salsa to top the chicken, but I would prefer medium.  It was just kind of bland.

This was so good! Everyone in my house LOVED it! I did change a few things. I used onions, celery and finely chopped carrots. But only sauted the celery and onions before putting them in the rice. I used chicken broth instead of the water and bullion cube. I omitted the cinnamon as well. I did sprinkle garlic, cumin, salt, pepper, and chili powder on top of my chicken before baking. Very lightly though! Which added GREAT flavor to the chicken. I also used 2 Boil in Bag bags of rice and just poured the rice uncooked into my baking dish. :)

We really liked this recipe. It was so easy to make. We thought the cinnamon was a little strange, but we loved the rice. We will definitely be making this again....only without the cinnamon. It was nice to eat something different. Thank you.

Absolutely great! I made this dish for my family and they loved it. I also like to point out that more rice can be used for the recipe.

My rice did not cook either. Had to add 25 more minutes and that is too long. My suggestion would be to cook on stove with other ingredients about 10 minutes. Give rice an extra start or just use a packaged rice mix. But recipe is easy to put together. I sprinkled a new spice I discovered on the chicken called Jamaican Jerk. A blend of red pepper flakes, allspice and thyme. Delicious!

Great flavor. The pot I had overflowed when I put the rice in, so I had to cook everything over the stove for a few minutes.  This ensured the rice was cooked properly. I wish I had followed the water amount in the recipe - I had added more due to several reviews saying there wasn't enough, and then turned out with really mushy rice. I think the few minutes on the stove ensured that it was cooked properly.  Added about 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and could have used a full teaspoon.  Really great flavor, can't wait to make this again.

I used Rotel cilantro and lime salsa with a little tomato sauce instead of the picante and white cheddar instead of regular cheddar. I think both gave it an added zing. I also used chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon. Served with tortilla chips.

I cooked this for four people and everyone loved it!  I did make a couple of changes,  I used Rotel with garlic and lime instead of diced tomatoes, seasoned the breasts before cooking with one squeezed lime and a mexican spice for chicken called Pico De Gallo Con Limon that I found at my local grocer and had been wanting to try.  I also added about two chopped green onion stalks, 3 cloves of garlic and a can of well drained and washed black beans!  I did not use the cinnamon or olives and if I make it again I would recommend using Chihuahua cheese or a mix of chedder and chihuahua.  It was FABULOUS, will definately be making this again!

AMAZING! Easy, fast, and great the second day too!

A few minor modifications:  I used the entire green pepper (rather than 1/4 cup) and doubled the minced garlic (about 2 tbsp total).  I used all the spices, and upped the picante sauce and cheese to 1 full cup spread only over the chicken.

This was pretty good. Next time I'm going to leave out the cinnamon, use 1/2 tsp of chili powder, add more cumin, and use mild salsa instead of hot picante sauce. The great part about this recipe is the rice cooks up nicely

Great week night meal. Great flavor. Did not have picante so I used roasted red peppers on top of the chicken. Added more rice and used chicken stock. Will make again.

Not to bad, I had to use Barillo Orzo instead of rice (I was out), I used a few canned Jalapeno peppers for the green pepper, and I accidentally put a little too much cinnamon in!  I'm am definitley not sure about the cinnamon, I probably won't use it next time.  This dish is pretty good!  I bet it would be excellent if I had all the correct ingredients! : )

I used this recipe as a guide but didn't want to go to the store so I used these ingredients instead and also modified the amounts:

Chicken
Extra Virgin Olive Oil
3/4 of medium yellow onion, chopped
2 stalks of green onions, chopped
11 oz can of mexicorn (corn, green & red peps)
garlic salt 
a handful of grape tomatoes, sliced
1.5 cups of H20
3/4 c. Jasmine rice
2 tsp Knorr chicken granules
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1-2 tbsp chili powder (the more the better!)
pinch of cinnamon (or to taste)
1 tsp cumin
pepper & salt
pepper jack cheese
chopped cilantro
sour cream (optional, for some, mandatory)

Season chicken with salt and peps, brown each side in the EVOO for about 3 min, remove, keep warm. In same pan, saute yellow onion and green onion until yellow is translucent. Add mexicorn and tomatoes, cook for 3 min, then add 1 c. of the H20, rice, bouillion, seasons, bring to boil then simmer for 3 min. Pour into glass baking dish (no need to grease), I added a half c. of H20 so the rice would cook and not dry out, top with chicken. 

Cover and bake @ 350 for 25 min or until rice is tender. Take out of oven, uncover, top with cheese, cover until melted. Garnish with chopped cilantro. 

Serve with sour cream, if you'd like. It tastes 10x better with it, but what doesn't taste better with sour cream?

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. I used more peppers than required and used fresh tomatoes rather than canned. Consequently, I added more water - about 1 1/3 to compensate for the liquid that would have been in the can.
Since we're not olive lovers, I didn't include them. This is definitely a keeper!! thanks!

Great recipe! Made as is, but omitted cinnamon because I didn't have it on hand, and olives because my bf hates them.

Made this pretty much as written. The only changes I made were to use a small can of chopped jalapeno peppers instead of chopping a green bell pepper, and used salsa instead of picante sauce, (don't really see the difference between the two) and Monterey Jack cheese, instead of cheddar, ( I just can't reconcile cheddar cheese belonging on a Mexican dish). Everything else was made as written. This is very good, but next time I will definately leave out the cinnamon, I just didn't like the subtle cinnamon taste, hence the 4 star rating.

We loved this! I didn't have some of the ingredients but I made it work! I did not have any green peppers or chili powder. I used chicken broth instead of water and added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper for an extra kick. I did have to add some more broth after it had been baking for about 20 minutes-- It seemed really dry. Turned out great though!

This was really good!  I followed the recipe, but sub'd red bell for the green (used about 3/4 of a large pepper) and didn't measure the salsa (just used plain mild) and it was great!  We liked the cinnamon and it smelled very yummy.

This was great and as a bonus, super easy! I modified the ingredients based on what I had on hand, and the taste was great! Seasoned the meat before browning. I used red bell pepper instead of green, didn't have bouillon or stock so I just added water and made sure I added extra seasonings to make sure the taste wouldn't be lacking. Added oregano, salt, and cayenne. Also used chicken leg meat since I had a lot from a recent sale. At the end when I added cheese, I increased the temp to 500 to give it a good texture. Served with sour cream. Will make again!!!

I give it 5 stars for ease of preparation and taste- perfect for a quick weeknight meal.  My whole family loved it.  I actually doubled the spices and used chicken broth instead of bouillon.  It was awesome.  It took no time at all to put together.  I did shake the chicken in a ziploc with some flour and salt and pepper before browning.  Yum!

My husband loved this!  I found the flavors very interesting and the dish as a whole satisfying but next time I will try it without the cinnamon and cumin and up the chili powder to 1 1/4 teaspoons.  The cheddar cheese combined with cinnamon and cumin was unusual to me.  I prefer these spices in a curry, moussaka or a vegetable dish like ratatouille.

This has a wonderful flavor and will go in my bi weekly rotation. I chopped up the chicken instead of leaving them whole. It makes it easier for the kids. Great flavor super fast. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I didn't have all the ingrediants on hand so had to do a few substitutions but it turned out very good.  Family said it is a keeper and I like that it can be made without much fuss.

Incredible!! I made mine with chicken broth instead of water and bouillon- just healthier, IMO. I also tried with Hot Sauce (like Frank's) instead of picante sauce. Delicious!

This recipe was okay, but lacked something...even doubling the spices I thought it was quite bland.  I'l probably make it again, but bump up the cumin and cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, and add some red wine and salt to the mix. I dredged the chicken in flour before browning, and after reading reviews of undercooked rice, I used 1c of rice and 1 3/4c chicken stock, omitting the boullion and water.

The dish was good but I think the cinnamon a little over powering to the rice flavor. I would next time take that out. I did not add the olives but did add sour cream to top when serving that did make it a bit tastier. But overall I would make it again.

This was SO good!  Flavorful without being spicy - even my 6 y/o loved it!  Only changes I made were to use 1 1/3 c. chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water, no green peppers (didn't have any) and had to cook it for about 50 minutes to get the rice tender.  Topped it with a dollop of sour cream - delicious!

awesome recipe!  So flavorful and yummy, and great texture too.  I left out the onion and doubled the green pepper.  I also used colby jack instead of cheddar.  DELICIOUS!  will definitely make again.

Pretty good chicken.  Just enough spices, without being over powering.  I added a spoonful of sour cream to each piece of chicken when serving it, and it was perfect!

This recipe was a hit.  I added sliced olives to the spanish rice with a little of the olive juice and put them on top as a garnish. I'm making this for company tonight. Great recipe!

This recipe is very good.  The spices give it a Mole type flavor.  I used low sodium chicken broth, instead of water and doubled the rice and broth.  I used chicken thighs (because that is what I had).  I also omitted the olives and peppers, but the dish was still very good.  I served it with sour cream and my entire family loved it.

Very yummy, one dish meal!  I used bone in skinless chicken, just browned a bit longer and I also used some brown and wild rice mix (cooked for about 12 mins first).  I was out of green peppers, so used some red and per other reviews, threw some black beans in as well.  Left the picante sauce off of the top and the olives too (hubby doesn't care for olives).  Turned out great, with lots of flavour, yummy!

This recipe is sooooo good! The rice came out awesome and is so much better than the spanish rice I have had in restaurants. I pretty much followed the directions other than I left out the cinnamon, used chicken broth instead of cubes and omitted the picante sauce. The recipe was still great and I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is great - I have done various things including using leftover spaghetti sauce mixed with salsa and still it was amazing - it is the few spices that add that very specific taste - so much my brother used it at a dorm party! To make it healthier use brown rice (but preboil it halfway first so it doesn't take too long in the oven) cut back on the chicken sizes and throw lots of pepper slices (red and green) on top to make them extra crunchy... Great recipe for all

So yummy! The rice was excellent! It made great leftovers the next day- I shredded the leftover chicken and stirred it into the rice mixture. yummy! I did add a few dashes of cinnamon even though many reviews did not seem to care for it, and we all liked it! I used more like 2 teaspoons of chili powder too.

This recipe was awesome!  There was so much flavor!  Like other reviewers, I did omit the cinnamon, so as not to take away from the Southwestern spices in this dish.  I made this on a night that I was having my parents over.  They were SO impressed.  They said it was delicious and that they would like to try the recipe themselves!  Thanks!

I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatos, so perhaps that is where this went wrong. It didn't taste very flavored at all. I probably would not use this recipe again.

Very easy and surprisingly delicous!  I used fresh diced tomatoes, left out the picante sauce, and added a can of black beans.  Next time, I will double the spices for a little more flavor.  Will make again!

Really great recipe, my husband loved it!  I change a couple things though, I just cut up the chicken and cooked everything in the skillet.  I also used diced tomatoes with green chiles, we like it spicy :o) Overall, really yummy!

This dish is delicious, but I put in a lot of shortcuts.  I cubed the chicken before I browned it, then I just simmered everything in the large saute pan.  I omitted the picante sauce and olives and just served it with cheese sprinkled on top.  My kids loved it!!!

Made this tonight for my husband and his friend.  They loved it.  Left out the cinnamon and the pecante sauce and cooked a little differently.  I made the rice separately because I made yellow rice.  Cut the water and chili powder in 1/2.  My husband said it was delicious - which is big because he hates green peppers!

This is a great recipe for a quick week night meal. I like to add a little more chili powder and cumin for my taste.  The chicken and rice always come out perfectly cooked for me.

SO Good! I used 5 min rice as directied in this recipie and it fluffed up nice. I had no problems with it not cooking in the time the recipie states. VERY easy and VERY yummy. I did not have the chicken bullion (or even chicken stock), but I did have some left over tommatow soup and I used that. Turne dout great. The cinnimon in the rice was good too. I wouldn;t think the little bit of sweet with go with the spicer taste of the dish, but it was GOOD! Definatly would recommend this!

Just three stars because this meal took SO long to cook.  I used brown rice, which takes a little longer than white, but I had to leave it in the oven for an hour and 20 minutes for it to be edible.  That makes this a very time-consuming dish and not one I would make regularly.

Despite this, the dish turned out pretty good.  I didn't think the small amount of spices would be enough but it was actually just right.  I did use chicken stock instead of bouillon, and added some peas, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

It's good, but probably not good enough to be worth the wait, in my opinion.

Delivers on its promise to be quick and tasty. Fantastic!

I cut out the olives and onion and added a bit more garlic, as well as 1/2 a red pepper, chopped.

I will definitely make this again!

This dinner was amazing.  I used diced tomatoes with jalapenos to make it even spicer and instant rice so the cook time was shorter.  It was great and definitely on the will make again list.

Sorry, didn't really like this. There wasn't a lot of flavour and some of the rice still wasn't cooked after an hour in the oven.

Great recipe, very easy, tastes great!I used a whole can of chicken broth instead of the water and bullion.  Also, increased the bake time by 15-20 minutes because the rice was not cooking.
