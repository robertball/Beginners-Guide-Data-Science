I feel that the instructions are not clear to anyone inexperienced.  Most fudge recipes need to be beaten until they are no longer glossy to get that fudgey texture.

blah.... i made this last night and here it being 8 o'clock in the morning, its a brown goo. i would not recomend this recipe as it is not very explanitory in when it is done, so it was very hard to tell. even besides that, it is awful.

I was happy when I saw the vegan label, having one in my household, but this recipe turned to mush and was unservable.

I got the brown goo too.  On the bright side....it would make a good ice cream topping.

There is not enough peanut butter in this recipe to give it any flavor.

I agree with everyone who wrote a review. I should have read the reviews before making this fudge, could have saved money and time. I made my fudge 3 days ago and it still hasn't set up.

It never hardened for me. I left it in the fridge 8 hours, then left it in freezer 12 hours. still liquid. I followed the directions, so I don't know what went wrong. I hope I figure it out because it does taste good.

It's delicious, but not fudge. More like brown sugar goo.
