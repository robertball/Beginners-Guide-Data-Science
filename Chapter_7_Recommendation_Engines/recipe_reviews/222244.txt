These were pretty good, but a little too heavy for us. I only had a cheap-y can of crab, so I used that and also added in some chopped pickled jalapenos to the mix, which was a nice addition. These were very easy to mix up and held their shape nicely. I just wish they were a little lighter...Thanks for sharing. :)

I  used this recipe as a basic platform as it was too late for a trip to the store for corn or crab. My husband said these were best Hush puppies he's ever eaten. I didn't use crab or corn, just chopped onion & celery. And used buttermilk for liquid. Perfect!
