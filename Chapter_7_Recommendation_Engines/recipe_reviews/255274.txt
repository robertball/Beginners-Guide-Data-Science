The recipe title is a bit deceiving because once the tomatoes and salsa are added the end result is not white. With that being said, this is a good. Mine turned out more of a soup which is what I like but if you want a thicker chili you might want to  drain some of the liquid from the tomatoes or either add less water. On that note, I think the one thing that would give this chili an extra boost of flavor is to use chicken broth in place of the water. I used fire roasted tomatoes but any of the seasoned blends (or plain) would work in this. Overall this is a great recipe and one I would make again. Thanks for sharing!

Made it as directed with one exception, I made it in my non stick copper pan so I did not use oil. This made all the spices stick to the chicken which made the chicken absolutely yummy, yet spices still flavored the creamy sauce. I really loved the result. My hubby thought it had too many beans. The next day I sauteed one chopped onion and three thinly sliced celery stalks until onion was translucent. Added four peeled and chopped carrots and one 12 ounce can chicken broth and brought mixture to a boil. Reduced heat. Simmered 20 minutes. Added the leftover soup (about 1/2 the original batch) and stirred in one cup sour cream. Thoroughly heated. Same great flavor with less beans and lots of vegetables. Hubby loved it and I still give it five stars made both ways. Even better topped with grated cheddar cheese (if you like cheese). Thanks for a great recipe.

Fast and tasty: doesn’t taste like it simmered all day, but a fast lunch. I scaled it down for my husband and self so eliminated the tomatoes as I don’t like having partial open cans in fridge. Used cooked chicken from freezer and added a sautéed shallot. Added more of the salsa to offset no tomatoes.

I made some slight changes...used chicken thighs, stewed tomatoes, a diced jalapeno , and no water. I added some sliced carrot and a tablespoon of cumin since it is a chili. It was good with the chicken thighs and I would make it again with the slight changes.

I was making a scaled down version, about a third, for two of us. I had plenty of chicken, but only one can of the beans.  I fire roasted a fresh jalapeno out of the garden, and threw in some leftover grilled corn (cut off cob) and green beans from the night before! IT WAS FANTASTIC!  My bf is a pro chef and he was so pleasantly surprised with this.  Remember, mine was about double the chicken and less than half the beans.  I think you can go kind of fast and loose with what you throw in.  I did, however, stick to the spice as called for and it was great!  ENJOY :)

Wow! This tastes amazing!! It does come out to be more of a soup than a chili but it is soooo good! Amazing broth :)
