This is divine!
to avoid having trouble slicing the soft goat cheese - here's a trick:  Use Dental Floss.  Set the cheese on a cutting board and slice through the cheese with a piece of floss.  This will create a smooth cut and not put so much pressure on the cheese to make it crumble.  Sometimes it's easier to find goat cheese labeled as Montrachet Cheese (and under that you'll find a description of Goat Cheese).  This tends to be a slightly firmer type of goat cheese.

This was a hit at my last party.  However, I did modify the directions.  I did not prepare ahead of time and I got the soft cheese that does not slice well, so I just chopped everything, put it in a blender and mixed it in with the cheese.  So far 5 people have asked me for this receipe.

Great and easy to prepare. Being concerned about the softness of goat cheese but loving it's flavor I substituted a Dutch white goat gouda cheese. It's firm but not dry. It was a good choice, kept the flavor but made the cheese much easier to handle. I also reduced the size of the cubes, to make it easier to spoon the cheese and bits of the marinade onto a bread slice and get into your mouth. Finally the recipe is not clear as to the nature of the black olives used. I used Kalamata olives and they tasted great. Lastly, I put the whole mixture into a gallon zip lock bag to marinate just reaching into the refrigerator every couple of hours to mix it around for better coverage. Then at serving time I just poured the whole lot into the serving dish, picked out the garlic picks and it was ready to go. Couldn't be easier and really yummy.

I made this initially for a dinner party.  Taste-wise, this was killer and there was none left.  I got asked many times for the recipe. However, it was hard cutting goat cheese into cubes because the stuff is WAY too squooshy.  What I did instead was take 1/2-teaspoons and roll them into balls, then toothpicked a slice of raw garlic to each one, and poured the marinade over top.  Made it easier for people to get out of the pan.

My Oscar night variation was to combine the goat cheese, sun-dried tomoato, oil and spices in a food processor, fill phyllo-dough shells with the mixture, and garnish each one with an olive slice and a slice of raw garlic.  Tasted the same, and the phyllo crust gave it just enough crunch!

I decided to make this as a spread, so added about 4 oz. of cream cheese as someone had suggested to make it more spreadable.  The goat cheese was a little salty and so were the sun-dried tomatoes I had, so I was afraid that 1 cup of tomatoes would be too much.  I used about 1/2 cup and also only 1/2 cup of the olives.  I chopped the fresh herbs and minced the garlic and then mixed everything together, with extra virgin olive oil.  With the goat cheese and cream cheese at room temp., it was easy to mix.  I served this with sliced French bread, as recommended, and it was fabulous, also quite attractive with the different colors.  Everyone raved over it.  I was glad there was a little left over, because it was SO good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. Edited to add: I have made this (with my modifications) many, many times and it's always a huge success. I even had to make it without the sun-dried tomatoes one time because I couldn't get any, and it was still good (not as good as with the tomatoes, though). Everyone just loves this.

This was a wonderful appetizer and enjoyed by everyone for a baby shower that I had. We substituted the goat cheese with sharp cheddar b/c the goat cheese was so expensive.  It was wonderful.  We also took the garlic cloves out, b/c we were not sure how strong they would be.  We marinated it overnight so we got the flavoring of the garlic and it was perfect.  Next time I make it, I may substitute it with shredded sharp cheddar for easier serving.  It was just hard for people to spoon it out and put it on the bread.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Delicious! We had trouble slicing the goat cheese, so we ended up using unwaxed, unflavored dental floss, which worked like a charm. I doubled the recipe since it only makes 10 servings, and ended up buying WAY too much goat cheese. Overall, a great appetizer for our party!

A great recipe inspires.  When my sliced cheese kept crumbling, I carried on.  Added some capers (it's Christmas!) and used it to top bruschetta.  A major hit at our neighborhood potluck!

This is THE BEST appetizer to serve or bring along to any gathering! Trust me on this. I dice up the cheese and usually end up drizzling more olive oil on it. For the black olives, use Kalamata instead of regular canned--it's FAR better.  This is always a huge hit, and everyone asks for the recipe.

AMAZING recipe!  I followed some of the other review suggestions and I only used one clove of garlic - chopped and sprinkled on top.   In a second batch I modified as follows:   half Chavrie and half cream cheese.  I blended the two cheeses together, then I put all other ingredients in the bowl and Hand Mixed. The result was a chunky spread that everyone absolutely loved.  In 5 minutes of putting the leftovers out at work, 4 co-workers asked for the recipe!

I didn't bother with cutting the goat cheese into cubes, I just spread it over the plate and went to it. Turned out pretty and tasted AMAZING. The fresh herbs really make the recipe. Will definitely be making this many times.

I made this for a party a few days before Thanksgiving and  I used all chevre and Kalamata olives and just chopped everything up. and made a cheese ball.  It was great!  Everyone really liked it and since I doubled it, I had enough left over to re-form into a new ball to add to the Thanksgiving appetizers.  Really good and different!  I will make it again.

This is a fantastic appetizer. If you mean to impress, this is the one that will do it. I used Kalamata and green olives.

I thought this was excellent, but the name was tough to live up to.  I suggest marinating this overnight because I only did six hours and it was even better the next day.  If you have picky eaters, not foodies, this might be an intimidating dish for them to try!  If you like goat cheese, you will enjoy this dish.

Outstanding recipe! Even my steak and potato loving husband thought it was really good. I brought this to a party and everyone raved over it! I followed the recipe pretty straight forward. Someone on a previous review suggested slicing the goat cheese with dental floss- this was an excellent tip! Worked like a charm (after trying to slice with a knife-didn't work well). Also don't be afraid to liberally drizzle the olive oil over the cheese. I also drizzled a small bit of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes over top.

I served this tonight for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it!! I did make a few changes. I mixed the goat cheese with minced fresh garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and 3 tablespoons of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. I marinated it overnight. For the party, I spread a heaping tablespoon of the cheese mixture over sliced french bread and drizzled prepared pesto. Not only did the appetizer look festive but it tasted delicious!n I would highly recommend making this appetizer.

I have made this about 5 times now and been asked for the recipe each time.  I actually mix the goat cheese with the ingredients so it has more of a spread consistancy.  Instead of using sun dried tomatoes I use the sun dried tomato pesto from Trader Joe's.  Serve this with sliced baguette and a big glass of red wine...excellent!

This was wonderful!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I served it as an appetizer for a wine tasting party, and everyone agreed that it was simply fantastic.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I made the recipe as is, but I did slice the cheese with dental floss.  However, in the end, it didn't really matter, as the cheese did not retain it's shape.  I did as another suggested and just put everything together in a plastic ziploc bag and "squished" it all together and put it into the refrigerator overnight.  I then just inverted the bag to release the spread into a pretty bowl.  I served it as a spread, along with a sliced baguette.  It was devoured!!

Made this for the first time last week and took the recommendation of putting all ingredients in a food processer then mixing with the goat cheese.  This was good as an appetizer with toasted appetizer size bread slices.  HOWEVER, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PUTTING THIS ON THE NEXT BATCH OF WHITE FISH YOU ARE GRILLING! Brought my left overs to a friends house and he surprised me by adding the spread to the top of the fish.  The flavor was to die for, high restaurant quality.  Grill fish on one side using your favorite seasoning, then flip and add this spread to the top of the fish with a little cheddar sprinkled on top to hold in place.  He used mahi but it would be good with any white fish.  Actually like it better on the fish than as an appetizer!  Try it, you'll like it!

my Goat cheese was purchased in a tube. So I sliced cheese about 1/3 of an inch thick. I put my garlic thru my press and put a little on each one.  Then put the rest on top.  Wow I had to make copys of this one for one and all.

I made this for a pot-luck for work and it was a big hit.  I stuck to the directions, but added some minced garlic instead of the cloves, some fresh cracked pepper, and used Kalamata olives instead of black olives.  I sliced a baguette, which made perfect one bite servings.

I did not care for this cold, but warmed in a 325 degree oven for 10 minutes and served with crackers or bread it was perfect!

Tastes like it's from a recipe on the back of a box of generic cream cheese. Way too fatty for my tastes. The herbs were nice but not enough to save the dish; I've had better cocktail wienies.

This was a hit at a recent luncheon I attended! I used calamata olives and three flavors of goat cheese (regular, garlic and herb, and roasted red pepper) mixed together. I put all of the ingredients into a zip-lock bag, and after marinating overnight, molded it into a ball to serve. I also toasted the slices of french bread. I had many people asking for the recipe - thank you!

This was very flavorful.  I see what people are saying about the different kinds of goat cheese.  It comes in different kinds of containers and some are softer (and harder to cut) than others.  I just made mine a spread to keep it simple...it all ends up being a spread in the end anyways.  I think it looks colorful either way.  I found my goat cheese at a discount grocery store (Marc's) so it wasn't pricey AT ALL!  It looks gourmet and everyone enjoyed it.

This appetizer is the best ever, full of flavor, this one is a keeper, I loved it!  The goat cheese is what made it even better than the usual mozzarella you are used to having with hor's deurves.  Thank you for this recipe, I loved it!

This is the most delicious cheese spread I've ever tasted! I served it at a party last night and it was a hit! Instead of putting the garlic cloves in, and taking them out again, I pressed two cloves and blended it with the goat cheese to which I'd added 4 oz. cream cheese to make it more spreadable, then spread it on the platter. I blanched the tomatoes for 3-4 minutes and skipped the olives. Fresh herbs are a must-amazing! I'll make this a zillion times!

This did not disappoint!  I brought it to a New Year's party and got rave reviews.  I used many of the suggestions posted by others.  I did not try and slice the cheese, I just chopped it into rough cubes.  I used 1tbsp of the sun-dried tomato oil in place of 1tbsp of olive oil.  I minced the garlic and threw it right in.  I put it in a big plastic container so I could shake it up through the day.  When I was ready to put it into a serving dish, I mixed it up so the consistency was like a spread.  It was so fresh and awesome on baguette!

I did what many others did and just stirred all the ingredients up to make a spread that I put in a bowl surrounded by crackers. I did get many comments about how great it was, but it was a little thick/rich for my tastes. A very interesting combination of flavors, though. Not a typical cheese spread.

This was my first experience with goat cheese, but I had all the other ingredients on hand, so I gave this recipe a try. The cheese was pretty crumbly to cut with a knife - perhaps I should have one of those cheese-slicing tools, and/or let the cheese soften a little at room temperature. Plus it came in a cylinder instead of a brick, so I couldn't get the desired uniform "one inch pieces". The sun-dried tomatoes came flavored with various herbs, so that boded well for a great-tasting dish.
The garlic gloves should be small ones, I think - even halves of bigger cloves split the cheese pieces in my case; again, maybe the cheese should have been slightly softened. Therefore, I didn't bother leaving the toothpicks in. I did, however, serve it on thin slices of French bread, as suggested. In summary, this is not technically easy for a beginner to do, I don't think. It turned out a bit messy for me, but the combination of tastes here was very good. Thanks for a nice introduction to goat cheese!

This was a big hit.  I made as instructed but maybe added more olive oil (a good quality olive oil).  My guests loved it and so did I.  Don't worry about perfectly slicing the goat cheese.  Guests will just pick some up with an app knife and put it on a piece of toasted baguette and all the other ingredients are covering up the goat cheese anyway.  Soo good. Also great you can make it the night before.  Highly recommend.

This dip was a big hit with my family.  Followed the recipe except I spread the goat cheese on a platter rather than try to cut it in pieces.

Thanks for the ideas this recipe gave me! The flavor combinations you provided are terrific. I basically used it as a jumping off point because I didn't have the time to cut/marinate, etc. and needed this to be easy for folks to eat at a pool party. I used kalamata olives instead of black (although that upped the saltiness). I used minced garlic and just left it in. Then I added about 2 TBSP of lemon juice to brighten it up a little. I also blended all of the ingredients but the cheese and then folded it into crumbled cheese. We'll see how everyone likes it!

A delicious, easy to prepare, and different appetizer. Make sure to take it out of the fridge at least 45 minutes before serving so that the cheese is soft for spreading. Served with baguette slices, this is a rich and filling appetizer, so be careful not to have too much and spoil your appetite for dinner! Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This is one of my favorite appetizers.  Instead of using chunks of goat cheese, i use the soft goat cheese and make kind of a layered dip.  Everyone loves it!!

This was WONDERFUL.  It was a great hit at the wine and appetizer party I brought it to, and a lot of people asked me for the recipe.  I only needed about 2.5 baguettes, sliced about 1" thick, to go with this topping.  I also cut the cheese with dental floss as per a previous suggestion, which worked well.  I also gently tossed everything together so that the flavors could mix better in the casserole dish I used to serve it.  Thanks, will make again!

Everyone else gave this recipe 5 stars so perhaps it was something I did but we found the flavors to be REALLY OVERWHELMING.  Maybe it's because I mixed everything in the food processor, I don't know.  The rosemary and garlic were particularly strong.  The flavors were a little more mild the next day and mixed together better, but nobody really ate any.  Sorry.

This recipe is great! Lots of flavour, and it doesn't really matter if the goat cheese is sliced, cubed, or crumbled, it will be gone so fast no one will care or notice what shape it was. We get it in a cylindrical shape so it's easiest to use dental floss to slice it. Some of the reviews mention it was salty, or say they used feta or some other type of cheese. Goat cheese is not feta. It's chevre. Anything else would not give the same result. Those who change the recipe and then don't like it shouldn't give a rating -- they haven't tried THIS recipe. It truly is a wonderful appetizer, worthy of all of the 5-star ratings!

We tried this two ways. One with goat cheese and one with mozzerella. Both were good, but goat cheese is worth the extra money if you only have a small crowd to feed. We served it with pita chips. Yum!

I made this for a new years eve party; it was the hit of the party. In fact, my wife and I didn't eat any of it in order to save it for the guests. Of course, we made a second batch the following weekend which we completely finished! Great recipe.

Recipe was very good.  The portion size is huge b/c guests can only put a small amount on each bread.  The longer it sits in the refrigerator the better it gets.  I found it better to mix the ingrediant over slicing the cheese.  A few people told me it was good but too hard to get on the cracker when the cheese was sliced.

Made this baby for a party.  Followed the instructions precisely, and it was the only appetizer that was completely consumed.  Only six people were here, and it was gone fast.  Despite what others have said, I didn't find it too strong at all.

I make this every chance I get. I love the smell of the garlic and herbs in the fridge when I leave it overnight. I think Kalamata olives are the only way to go. Their flavour makes a contribution to the dish that you wouldn't get from just regular black olives.  At a BBQ we used the leftovers to top our burgers.  Would also be great on scrambled eggs.

I am a fairly adept cook and was looking for a new appetizer to try.  I made it as a spread and added minced garlic rather than adding whole cloves and removing.  I like all of the ingredients, but the dish seemed bland to me.  I also made an artichoke dip that I have doctored over the years.  That disappeared, but I brought more than half of this back home. I will say that a few people really liked it.  I think it is one of those dishes that you either love or hate.  If I could think of a way to add more flavor, it would definitely help.

Fabulous!!  I used crumbled goat cheese instead of sliced because it is less $$ and MUCH easier to spread.  I had the bakery slice baguettes to serve with it and this was perfect!!

This is very good and got good reviews at a party. I was too chicken to try goat cheese so used sharp cheddar and people enjoyed it. Plus goat cheese would have cost me over $12.00.

Oh my Gosh...  Yumm Yumm...  I used Kalamata olives instead of black olives... and feta cheese and used a little dried rosemary along with fresh basil. Some hard italian bread sliced up. Everyone loved it.

Pretty slammin'   Made it for the playoffs and even the guys loved it.   My husband said it looked "too pretty to be good"  I would add more basil, rosemary and a tiny bit more EVOO next time as it was a little on the dry side.   MUST be prepared day prior for best results.   On my top 10 list for sure

I made this recipe the other day and it was a hit!
I spread out the goat cheese instead of slicing it, into an oven ready dish.  Mixed the ingredients in the food processor until it made a paste.
Spread the paste over the goat cheese and warmed it in the oven for 10 mins at 350 and then drizzled it with a little honey and served with crackers, it was delicious.

I didn't have a chance to try this, but all the other party goers gave this appetizer rave reviews. I'm honestly not a cook, either, so this recipe was both easy and (apparently) tasty -- and such a treat to bring along something everyone loved so much!

We love this.  I don't bother trying to cube the cheese ~ I roll it into little balls.  In addition to being very tasty, the white cheese with the black olives, red tomatoes and green herbs makes for a pretty dish.

I really enjoyed this appetizer. I figured out what cheese is used in the photo.It's not the soft goat cheese but semi soft goat cheese. It is a little harder to find but is worth it because it doesn't crumble.I found this at Costco.

This is an excellent recipe except for putting it on bread.  That part was a little difficult for everyone, but we all enjoyed the taste.  I may try mixing the goat cheese with a little cream cheese to make it more "spreadable" for the bread.

I used all the ingredients, but I brought the goat cheese up to room temperature and spread it onto a platter.  I also finely minced the garlic and added it on top of the goat cheese with the other ingredients and then you can serve it right away or chill it for a while.  Serving this dish is much easier as a spread.

I was very embarrased when I took this to an appetizer party with such high expectations and it was an absolute flop!!  Don't know what I did wrong because I love all the ingredients, but I surely did not love this!

The flavors are fairly good in this recipe, however it was very unpractical and crumbly. Nobody asked for the recipe either and I will not make it again. It takes too much time and effort to get an average appetizer.

This is outstanding.  I used kalamata olives instead of black.  I love green olives but i felt they would be too overpowering.  Someone suggested using dental floss to cut the goat cheese and I wish I had.  I used a very sharp knife and it still made cutting a little sloppy.  I toasted baguette pieces with a spread of olive oil also.

This was a big hit at our New Year's Eve get-together.  As suggested by other reviewers I used kalamata olives instead of the black olives.  In addiiton, I used minced fresh garlic and gently push it into the cheese before topping with the other ingredients.  The garlicky taste of the cheese was wonderful!

It is better the longer you let it marinade.  The first time we tried it, it had been marinating for about seven hours.  It was good, but we found the left overs were much better the next day.  This morning my hubby put the remaining amount in his omelet and he said it was even better.  At his request I made another batch.

I made with homemade goat cheese which was much softer than what the recipe calls for so I just mixed the ingredients and used as a spread on toasted baguette slices. The flavors were fantastic together! Everyone raved about it at the party I took it to. Will definitely make this again!

I had this at a dinner party this weekend.  It was gone very quickly.  The hostess made balls out of the goat cheese and put pine nuts on top.  It was BEAUTIFUL.  I'm making this for the holidays for sure!!!

This is the best!  I just crumbled the cheese and used chopped garlic.  Gave everything a stir before putting it in the fridge and served w/ toated slices of french bread.  OMG--yum!  Next time I will take it out of the frig at least an hour before serving.  Room temp. would be even better.  Thanks so much.  BTW, I used goat cheese from Wal-Mart (never have before, always bought the "good" stuff), it was great, couldn't tell the difference in this recipe.

Don't know what I did wrong, but our gang were not impressed. With goat cheese at about $16 a pound, it really hurt to throw it out.Maybe Feta would have worked better or perhaps fresh herbs from my patch overwhelmed it.

This dip is delicious. I did it a bit different in that I used soft goat cheese and folded all the ingredients in until it was a chunky dip. I also diced the garlic fine and used a bit less. I didn't have fresh rosemary so I gave it a sprinkle of dry. We ate it right away with Wheat Thins because I couldn't wait 6 hours. Super Good!

Very yummy- expensive treat though.  Only changes I made- used kalamata olives instead and put the entire mix in a plastic bag to mold it more into a log and slice off of.

Very good and very popular. I served it with crackers because I thought the bread would be too filling. I tossed it gently in a bowl, chilled it overnight and served it in a shallow platter. It was a bit oily so next time I'll cut back on that.

This is one of my favorite appetizers.  I serve it with baguette slices that have been brushed with seasoned olive oil and broiled until crispy.

This recipe is fantastic.  Slicing the cheese with dental floss did make it easier.  I put it out with a knife and people smeared it on the bread like a spread.  Wonderful!

This didn't work for me. I was scared of the goat cheese and used havarti. This was the first time I used sun dried tomatoes- (I re-constituted them in warm water; maybe they should have been left dried) and they really overpowered the marinade. It gave it a really sweet flavor, which isn't what I expected from the reveiws. I thought it would be really sassy- maybe more of a strong garlic and herb flavor but it turned out sweet. My husband liked it though. I may try this again, with the crubled goat cheese food proccesor style, with the cream cheese and DRIED tomatoes.

So very very very good.  It went in a matter of minutes.  The goat cheese is very crumbly; I don't think the picture shown is of goat cheese.  It's impossible to cube.  Nonetheless, very delish.

This was good. I have to agree with another rating about using it as a spread. It was very difficult to handle and may have been easier as a spread. Will probably make again.

I made this for a Christmas party. It wasn't bad. Everyone seemed to enjoyed it. I did not have time to marinate it like I wanted to but still came out fine. Also, I used crumbled goat and just mixed everything togethter. Probably will make again.

Since my grocery store sells goat cheese crumbles in 4 oz. packages (and it's not cheap), I bought two and just made 2/3 of the recipe.  It was still more than enough.  I also used sun-dried tomato pesto in place of the sun-dried tomatoes and olive oil.  I'm sure the fresh herbs would have been excellent, but I used about 2 tsp. dried basil and 1 tsp. dried rosemary since I had it on hand.  I didn't think the garlic flavor really came through and will probably add a little minced garlic to the recipe next time rather than halving the cloves and removing before serving.  Nonetheless, my guests all seemed to like the appetizer, and it's a nice treat if you want to splurge on the ingredients.

This is something that I hope I have leftovers of so I can enjoy days after the party. I mixed all ingredients in a covered container (which I tossed in refrig to marinate) and re-arranged on platter to serve. Could also serve with pita triangles. A bit different to my friends, so I loved haved something new. Excellent!!!!!

This was truly a delicious "best ever" appetizer. I made this appetizer for my monthly "girls' night birthday dinner (10 girls in the group) and made the recipe exactly as the ingredients called for except I did not infuse the garlic cloves and wait for at least 6 hours. I had 2 hours to be at the party, therefore, I crushed the cloves and mixed the garlic with the sundried tomatoes and kalamata olives and then spread the mixture on top of the goat cheese.
I then sprinkled the fresh rosemary and basil on top and served with store bought whole wheat mini crostini's. The end result was that all of the other 9 wanted the recipe and it was the perfect appetizer to share on a mid summer night as the ingredients were reflective of the season. Thanks so much to the creator of this delectable appetizer.

Recipe was delicious. Did not use the raw garlic as one guest was allergic. Even so was delicious. It does need to marinate at least overnight - tastesmuch more delicious.

This is really an excellent dip.  It is different and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it.  I made toasts to go with it.  I sliced baguette 1/2" thick and brushed them seasoned olive oil and baked them.  I used a baguette and when the bread ran out people stopped eating it.  I would say I needed 1.5 baguette

Fabulous! Even better with kalamata olives as other have suggested. I have used buffalo mozzarella cheese cut into tiny pieces as well. I mix it all up in a bowl before letting it sit overnight. Served with small bread slices or toasts. Great as a topping for leftover sandwiches.

I made this recipe two different ways.  One with goat cheese and the other with fontina cheese (the softer version).  I think both were good, however I would leave out the rosemary next time as it was a bit overpowering.  Overall, good recipe.

I arranged the cheese straight on plate and let marinate with all ingredients covered with foil. It was delicious but very rich. U cant eat much of this. There are people who either like this or do not care for this at all. Because of thr cost of this appertizer I dont think I will be making this often.

This really was fabulous, and I was sooo glad that some was left over because it got even better later.  I love garlic, so instead of using and them removing the cloves of garlic, I just minced two cloves and mixed it with my olive oil before drizzling over the goat cheese.

Sorry but not a "Best Ever Appetizer"!  I love Feta, garlic and sun dried tomatoes and was extremely excited to make this.  But this was just missing something and was hardly touched at our party.  I followed the recipe, let it marinate overnight and served it with French bread (brushed with olive oil and lightly toasted).  Will not waste the time or money making this again.  Sorry!

This is a party pleaser, to be sure.  To fix the spooning problem, I spooned each slice of the goat cheese mixture onto pita bread which I sliced into triangles.  I added fresh minced cilantro on top also.  HUGE HIT. :)

I agree with the name, this is a wonderful recipe and one of my favorites on the site yet!  I had to make a lot of substitutions: fresh mozz for goat's cheese, tomatoes without oil, and dried herbs due to my grocery store not having anything I needed, and it still turned out great.  I took it to a potluck and got rave reviews. Next time I'll plan ahead and get the proper ingredients and I bet it'll be fantastic!

Somehow this just didn't work well for me.  The flavoring was great, but it was hard to handle.

I recently took this to a wine + app party and it was a big hit!  Be prepared for some very strong flavors- to make it more tolerable, spread the goat cheese out among many thin slices of french bread.  Enjoy!

Fantastic recipe. I didn't have the time to let it marinate for 6 hours and it was still delicious. Next time I think I will roast the garlic. 
Such an easy recipe too.

So, I made this for a girls' party and it was a huge success! I put room temp goat cheese and all ingredients in a bowl (crushed the garlic), mixed together, and let sit overnight. The slicing of the goat cheese would have been too tricky, and the truth is, it tastes better all blended anyways. I'll be adding this one to my regular repertoire!

Great appetizer - we serve it often!  I substitute garlic olive oil instead of the regular olive oil and garlic cloves.  Marinate as suggested, drizzling a little bit of the garlic olive oil over the top of the mixture.  Yum!

I didn't get the same wow as other reviewers did.  I love all the ingredients, but this was just okay and I would probably not make it again.  Perhaps, it was the amount of rosemary which really was overpowering.

This was delicious and a hit at our party.  I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and marinated it in a zip lock bag, then just emptied it onto a platter when I was ready to serve it.  I'll definitely make it again!

This is so-so! However I did substitute yellow cheddar for the goat cheese and a can of diced tomatoes(drained)for the sun dried tomatoes.It may not have been such a good idea since the other reviews raved about this. I might do this again if I stumbled across some more goat cheese.

Ever time I make this, I always get asked for the recipe! Delicious and easy!  I do make a couple of changes though.  Instead of trying to slice and keep the cheese in slices, which is not only a pain, but also is too much cheese on a cracker, I let it 'crumble'. I used chopped kalamatra olives instead of black olives...gives it a nice additional dimension of flavor, and I don't drain the oil from the sun dried tomatoes. I found that the 3 tablespoons of olives alone left it too dry.

This is wonderful!
I added Bordeaux Cherry flavored balsamic vinegar and the olive oil.
You could also use a Jalapeño flavored balsamic and add shoe peg corn, black beans, cilantro for a Mexican version.

Great recipe!  Some of the reviews mentioned trouble with slicing the goat cheese.  I put mine in the freezer for about 15 minutes.  When I took it out, I sliced it up quickly and it worked like a charm.  Also, I did not use black olives - I used Kalamata sliced olives.  Yummy!  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Wow, we loved this!  I used a cheese slicer and didn't have any problems with the cheese. Next time I'll try Klamata olives instead of black (though I didn't really taste the olive flavor) and mince the garlic and just put it on top with the spices. Served on a sliced baguette. It's beautiful too, great presentation.  So yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

DENTAL FLOSS, really...OMG what a helpful tip. I laughed and tried to use my very very sharp knife but goat cheese is "fragile" and it crumbled. SO I pulled out the dental floss. Beautiful cut, sliced right through time & time again.  My dish turned out very pretty with evenly sliced goat cheese, thanks to you Dining Diva!

I wish I could add another star, it’s that good!  Made one little change because I had less than 30 minutes to make this and leave the house....I used garlic powder instead of marinating the cheese with the garlic cloves.  I also used kalamatas instead of regular blacks.  Unbelievably rich deep flavors that all hold their own.  I used a sliced crusty baguette for my base and book club pretty much wiped out the platter. All were referred to AR for the recipe.  The little bit I have left over (I doubled the recipe) is going on pasta tonight for dinner.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!

This really is the Best Ever Party Appetizer! I brought this to a potluck and everybody was worried they weren't going to have room for dinner! (It really was that good!) Next time I won't drain the dried tomatoes quite so dry. And I did use a machine to to chop the rosemary, and it came out more like ground. It seemed to work okay, though. I appreciated the video. It took away the first-time recipe jitters.

This was a hit! I added fried and  very crunchy bacon I cut up in very small pieces on the very top. I had trouble pulling the garlic cloves out.(ended up having to dig them out) Will definately make this again with the bacon.

Took this to a Christmas Party and it was a big hit.  As simple as this is the flavor is wonderful.  Will definitely make this again as is.

I cut the goat cheese in smaller pieces. I bought 3 ...3oz. pieces and  I cut each 3 oz piece into 12 pieces and then placed all in bowl and marinated for 8 hrs.  I then took the goat cheese out first and spread all else on top...delicious...everyone loved it!!!!

I was dubious, can you really believe it when the recipe is entitled "the best party appetizer ever"?  Well, I am now a believer.  Maybe not "the best" but definitely in the top five.  I served it for friends who were my guinea pigs; I am now serving it at my New Year's Levy for 30 people.  It was a huge hit, so easy to make and I love that it is make-ahead and frees up my time for the other last minute details.

This was a very pretty appetizer but it was a lot of prep work and it was just ok. I wasn’t too impressed with the flavor.  I would not call it the best ever.

I made this and either did something very wrong or just don’t like it. I followed the recipe using kalamata olives instead of black. I mixed it all together the night before and let it marinade as suggested. When I looked the next day the basil was all black and unappealing to look at. My sundried tomatoes were also dark, not bright red so the whole dish looked very unappealing (kind of like dog barf). When I tasted it it was ok but there were too many powerful flavors and it just didn’t work for me. The rosemary especially threw me. Didn’t really go with the other flavors and overpowered them. I’m not sure how everyone else had such bright sun dried tomatoes. Typically they are a very deep red and almost black. I did try to add more fresh basil for color but it didn’t help.

Made this for the first time to take to a holiday party. Everybody loved it!  Prepped it in the morning. Shouldn’t have taken more than 30 min, but I had to frequently stop to wash off the knife I was using to slice the goat cheese cleanly. I now understand that taught dental floss pulled through the cheese log works better. Served it with fresh baguette slices.

This is a great recipe, I've been making variations of this for years & it's always a party pleaser.  I often serve it on toasted French bread rounds, I slice the cheese a little thinner using dental floss, but if it's too soft or crumbly I will sometimes spread it.  I put all the ingredients including the garlic in a food processor & it makes it easy to use as a topping. Thanks for the great recipe!!

First had this at a party and loved how beautiful it was a first and then how it tasted. Great presentation. I asked for the recipe thinking it would be difficult or time consuming to make. I was delightfully surprised, so easy to make! 

My husband doesn't like olives so I made one half with olives and one without.  Hit with the family

Love! Love! Love!

Excellent!  I followed several other recommendations: chopped everything then put in a ziploc bag to marinate. Only had 3+hrs in refrig and it still came out great!  I mixed the bag several times over the 3+hrs.  Then, scooped out of bag and created a thick spread in a shallow, ~4"x8" dish and garnished with whole kalamata olives and basil leaves.  Served with thin (1-2") slices of french bread.

This was a big hit, even with friends who never eat goat cheese.  I am always searching for appetizers I can serve without dairy; this one will be on my "always" list.  Also easy enough to just make for a delicious snack.

I have made this several times now, it is my "go to take to parties" appetizer because I always take something my husband can eat (most people bring things with dairy, I love it is dairy free).   We found it works great with Triscuit  Rosemary crackers.  And it is a bit crumbly, but piles on ok.  Also the leftovers are wonderful too.
I always get rave reviews on it and requests for the recipe.

I made this a full 24 hours in advance using "chevre" goat cheese due to lack of availability in log form. After making this I would opt for the chevre style again over the log form. It is soft, crumbly and creamy and came in a small tupperware container from a local cheese shop. It was absolutely delicious and is impressive to a crowd for being so simple to assemble. The only thing I slightly disliked about making it 24 hours ahead of time is the basil turned brownish. It did not taste bad, it's just much less appealing to the eye. Next time I'm going to try to make this  6 hours in advance (as suggested) as I think letting it marinate really does help bring the flavors out, but hopefully the basil won't turn brown.

This was good, but I think the next time I will do what someone suggested and make it with Havarti cheese instead.  I am not a fan of goat cheese, but like to try new things.  A few of the folks at the party really liked it.

For those of you who had trouble slicing the cheese I think the recipe calls for slicing not cutting into chunks. Either way the trick I've always used is to freeze the cheese for 30 minutes first

I made this as directed, and it was good. A bit messy to scoop onto the bread though. Also french bread is not part of the ingredients. I did use the dental floss to slice the goat cheese and it worked perfect.

So easy, so good! I used goat cheese crumbles to make it easy to eat and make. Yum! Hubby doesn't like Rosemary so I made half with half without. Both great!

I omitted the garlic, but I did add a balsamic reduction drizzle over it while serving it. Awesome flavor!!

I thought this was really good and it looked pretty too. I used black olives because that is what I had but Kalamata would have looked nicer.  I sliced the cheese the evening before and put it and the oil from the tomatoes and garlic in a ziplock bag to marinate. Arranged the next morning, removed the garlic and it went well. Unfortunately a lot of people seemed to be a bit suspicious of this dish. They seemed to go with the old standbys.  Oh well, more for us:-)

This is super Delicious!!!
I substitute goat cheese with Queso Fresco Semi-Soft Farmer's Style Cheese, and it turns out good.
Thank you for precipices.

This appetizer is only going to be as good as the quality of your ingredients because it's very simple. Get good quality everything, especially the goat cheese (chevre), sun dried tomatoes (only oil packed, not dried) and olives (kalamata would be a good choice). Get fresh herbs, don't substitute dried.  Pine nuts or pistachios make a good addition to the recipe. With good ingredients, this app is divine. I could eat it all myself!  Don't scrimp and get cheap ingredients, if budget is a concern make something else. I spend about $30 or more making it, but it's worth every penny!!

This recipe was amazing.  I followed directions exactly, and it was a hit.  The second time I made it, I tried mixing all ingredients together.  It tasted just as good, and was easier to eat, but the presentation wasn't as nice.  I served it with both fresh french bread slices, and toasted french bread slices.  Everyone preferred the toasted bread.

Based on prior review, mixed up everything in a food processor and piped into phyllo shells.  Added baby basil leaves and chopped sun dried tomatoes to garnish.

I made this for Thanksgiving at someone else's house (and they are foodies). It was really good, everyone who had some raved. I was nervous since it was my first time but followed the directions used kalamata and black olives also chopped roasted garlic on top and went light on the rosemary. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I was so inspired by the variations posted by everyone that did not give up when there was no fresh basil to be found. I mashed up the goat cheese into a spread and topped with olive oil and prepared tabuleh from the deli. Sprinkled it with chopped kalamatas, served with baked pita chips, and viola! Delish.
