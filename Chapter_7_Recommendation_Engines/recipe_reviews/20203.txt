The syrup is always added first in the glass because if you add milk first, you can't tell how much syrup you are adding. This makes portion control impossible in a restaurant. My problem with this receipt is the use of the term "cup". If you put selzer in a cup, then chill it, it becomes flat. Traditionally there is only one acceptable syrup for an egg-cream. That is "U-Bet" syrup. The key to a good egg cream is to have highly carbonated selzer, well-chilled milk and a well mixed combination befgore the selzer is added. The amount of milk here is a bit much. You need a higher selzer to milk ratio for the best egg-cream. There are two parts to adding the selzer. First you add and stir till the mixture bubbles to the top. Then stop. Then add more selzer. The best egg-creams have a froth of chocolate bulles on the top. It is difficult to make a good egg cream without a seltzer bottle. Not impossible, but difficult. You can also make vanilla egg-creams. The best glass for an egg cream is the coca-cola soda-fountain glass with the bell-shaped top.

When I was a little girl in the Midwest we always called this "Chocolate Soda" not to be confused with a "Chocolate Coke".  I remember that the canned Hershey's syrup was always used, then milk, and finally it was all finished off with cold, cold, cold seltzer.  Absolutely yummy!

Not good! My friend and I had to chug them so that we could tolerate them and not waste them.

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't really measure the ingredients. My daughter really liked this but my son wasn't a fan. I would make this again.
