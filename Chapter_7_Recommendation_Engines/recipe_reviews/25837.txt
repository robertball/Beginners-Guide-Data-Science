very good and very easy.  Used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup butter, and used zylitol instead of sugar.  subbed raisins for some of the chocolate chips and only used a cup of each.  excellent cookie!

Like other reviewers, I had to make some substitutions based on my not-so-full pantry.  I had only choc chips, and no nuts, so I omitted the nuts and added 1 C each of Crasins and raisins.  There wasn't a lot of flavor, considering what I DIDN'T use, so I added about 2 tsp of cinnamon...my friends and family just raved!  Thanks, Cara, for a new "keeper"!

These cookies were sinfully delicious!  The only change I made was adding about 1/4c water to the batter b/c it was just way too dry (we live in a very dry climate, so I'm not surprised).  I made these cookies as a welcome gift for my new neighbor and her two boys - I'm sure they'll love them!

These were good, but they were a little too sweet for our taste.  If I make them again, I'll increase the nuts/oats, and decrease the chips.

Absolutely delicious and sinful! I did not have any pecans so I used chopped walnuts instead.  To me nuts in cookies are great so I don't care which kind I use.  But I did get distracted by my newborn baby during the preparation of the cookies and forgot to add the oats! I noticed it when I came to write my review and by then I had made two dozen, but they still tasted great! I went back and added the oats because I really wanted them to look like a meaty cookie and for them to live up to their name.  Try these cookies! They are great!

I also had peanut butter chips so added them with walnuts instead of pecans and added raisins.  Next time I'll add chopped dates.  So versitile I'm thinking I'll make an "all fruit" one (dried cranberries,dried blueberries, raisins, dates with nuts) and a "peanut butter cup" one with peanut butter chips and chocolate chips...so many different ways to make these!!

I forgot to read the reviews, but I had a problem with it being sticky, I think the chips and oats were a little bit too much, didnt realize it until the end, I wasted about 1/2 cup of the four ingredients. I think next time, I wont add butterscotch chips, as I realized I don't like them! lol Other than that PERFECT and yummy! I'm gonna keep this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

My substitutions: I substituted one of the cups of flour with whole wheat flour. I used one cup Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of two cups brown sugar. I omitted the vanilla chips and added extra of the chocolate and butterscotch chips.  I made smaller cookies with a melon baller and larger rounded tbsp sized ones that I pressed down a bit.  Both times they only needed the 8 minute cooking time.  I liked the larger cookies better.  But I agree with the other reviews that the cookies are a bit dry.  This may be due to my substitutions.  Would make again, but would tweak them to avoid the dryness.

Really good and easy - plus cleans out your pantry! I ran out of oats, so substituted Rice Krispies for the rest - and used additional chocolate chips instead of vanilla chips - still yummy!

OMG - heaven!  This is my favorite cookie.  Ever.  I did end up making quite a few changes based on other reviews and personal preference.  For fear of these being too sweet based on prev reviews, I only used 1 C. brown sugar, then added 1/2 C. of splenda blend for baking.  I also cut down the flour to 2 cups - 1 C. white, and 1 C. whole wheat.  All other amounts were the same until I got to the chips.  I omitted the vanilla and used a full cup of butterscotch.  I also added 1/2 C. of coconut.  These took about 9 mins in my oven, and they definitely don't spread much.  So if you like a flatter cookie, you might want to squash 'em down a little.  I can see how these could be too sweet using the full 2 C. brown sugar and all the chips in the original recipe.  I also think using the whole wheat flour helps manage them being overly sweet, plus it gives the cookie a delish heartyness.

Oh My goodness ~ WARNING, do not even think about baking these if you don't want to turn into the cookie monster!!!  Seriously they are the most delicious cookie, I followed the recipe exactly other than using heaths toffee pieces in place of the butterscotch chips as I did not have any.  I doubled the size of the cookie and cooked for an additional 5 minutes.  I only baked half of the cookie dough and the other half I made into balls and froze on a cookie sheet to bake off at later date (got a feeling that my be very soon!!) The cookies looked just as good as they tasted, just the right amount of cracks...  This really will be my most used cookie recipe now and to think it was just the name that first attracted me to this recipe!!!

Really good!! For those of you who had problems with being dry I have a convection oven and I cooked them for 8 minutes @ 370 and they turned out perfect! Also I usually roll the dough into balls and then flatten them with my hand instead of dropping them and they always turn out looking so professional! Next time I am going to mess around with different types of chips because alot of people i know don't like butterscotch. These cookies truly taste homemade! So AMAZING!!

These cookies were very good.  I do agree with some of the other reviews that they were a bit dry, so next time I would add less rolled oats.  I also added 1 package of mixed semi-sweet chocolate and peanut butter baking chips.  Everyone that tried them really liked the cookies!

These are SOOOO GOOD!  I only changed one thing in this recipe and that was to add a full cup of butterscotch chips instead of the 1/2 cup, because they are my favorite.  Everybody that tried these loved them.  I hope I have enough left to send to my daughter in college.  After all... that is who I made them for.

I made this recipe for a Christmas Cookie Swap.  It was a huge hit.  I chopped up leftover Halloween candy bars (Snikers, Milky Ways and Three Musketeers) as well as added some semi sweet chocolate chip and butterscotch chips.    I didn't add any nuts.  Very easy to make and delicious.

These cookies were delicious! We all agreed that the cookie was high end bakery quality! I had prepared the dough earlier in the day, covered the bowl and placed it in the fridge.  When I was ready to bake, I took the dough out and 'rolled' it into a log and sliced it 1/3" pieces. I initially baked for 9 minutes but they didn't seem done(probably because I had refrigerated the dough), so I baked additionally in 2 minute increments. After 13 minutes in my oven, I pulled them out and let them rest for 5 minutes on the tray, then transferred them onto a rack and were perfect! I didn't have any pecans so used walnuts instead, and were still great. Definitely recommend this receipe! THANKS CARA!

This is my new go-to cookie recipe. I often use this recipe for just making chocolate chip cookies and omit all the other fillers. Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Love me some oatmeal chocolate chip cookies!!!

I made this for a quick get together and I think only half the batch made it. They are really good and it has everything in it from sweet, to nuts to filling ingredients. I followed the exact chip amounts and I think next time I will skip over the white chocolate pieces because my husband is not a big fan...maybe more chocolate chips and add peanut butter chips. I did not have problem with scooping and baking cookies either... I used a small melon baller and they cooked just fine. Excellent!!!

Excellent cookie. I made it exactly as the recipe says. I don't love the flavor of butterscotch so I'm glad it was only 1/2 cup. I might even add less next time. I will also try toasting my pecans next time and leaving the pecans a little bigger next time but I like chunky cookies. All around good cookie for those who like cookies with lots of "stuff" in them.

After reading the comments on how dry the dough was... I changed a few things.  Reduce the flour to 2 cups and reduce the oatmeal to 1 3/4 cups.  That did the trick the dough is more the moistness of choc chip cookies.  I also changed the chips.  I used peanut butter, white, and chocolate chunks.

I didn't care for them - very dry with too much of a brown sugar taste for me.

I LOVE this recipe and every time I make it people ask for more (and the recipe!).  The only thing I do differently is sub peanut butter chips for the vanilla chips.  Sometimes I throw other stuff like toffie chips in to.

The only changes I made were using 1c of butterscotch chips & omitting the vanilla chips (b/c I'm not a fan) and omitting the pecans (so my little one could eat some but I think they'd be great).  I thought these were INCREDIBLY sweet & I have a huge sweet tooth.  My mom didn't think so but next time I'll definitely decrease the sugar by about 1/2c and maybe sub in half whole wheat flour & try decreasing the butter just a bit.  UPDATE: I kept the batch I made in the freezer & we ate them slowly.  They grew on me & I think they're quite good now.

Very good!  Although I would use some other flavor instead of the vanilla chips next time

Even though I changed a few things, I still feel like I can give the original recipe 5 stars.  I replaced the vanilla chips with Craisins, and used a flour blend which included white, whole wheat, and spelt flour.  I also took out 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and they were still plenty sweet.  These cookies are great - they have a lot of texture and flavor.  I like my cookies thin and chewy, so I melted the butter and smushed them down a little bit when putting them on the cookie sheet and that worked perfectly.  I'd like to not use quite so much butter...  anyone have any ideas for that?

Nice and easy recipe to follow. I removed the butterscotch chips and substituted steal cut oats for rolled oats - since that is all I had in my pantry. Not the best substitution. Next time I will either used rolled oats, or no oats. The steal cut oats are like tiny seeds in the cookies. I guess at least it's fiber! Would be good with coconut too and raisens. Delicious simple cookie batter though.

These are great cookies and come out nicely every time.  I used peanut butter chips rather than butterscotch, but I don't recommend substituting toffee pieces...they burned and melted and did something weird to the consistency.

Absolutely the most versatile recipe! I have made these several times and never exactly the same... except the basic dough... sometimes I add raisins or Heath chips or Mini M & M's.. that is my grandchildren's favorite... Definitely a great cookie!!

My family loved these cookies. My husband and son thought they were amazing. 

I reduced the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups, omitted the vanilla chips (didn't have any) and increased the butterscotch chips just a little. I thought that they were still a little too sweet for me. I would reduce the sugar to 1 cup next time and still omit the vanilla chips but leave the butterscotch to the suggested amount.

I gave them 4 stars because of the sweetness ... my husband would probably give them 25 stars!! He absolutely loved them and couldn't keep his fingers out of the container ... they disappeared very quickly!

Loved everything about these cookies.  Most of my batch were given to and eaten by friends, who gave me many compliments.

I did just two things differently: Used only chocolate chip cookies (equal volume to that of the summation of three types listed in the recipe), and used macadamia nuts instead of pecans because they were on sale and much cheaper than any other nut at the store on that particular day.  

Making them again tonight so that I can enjoy them this time!

These cookies are awesome!! I made 2 changes, I left out the vanilla chips, because I don't like them, and I chilled the dough overnight before baking.  The reason I gave it 4 stars, was because I think with the vanilla chips they would've been too sweet for my taste.  But leaving them out, they were awesome!!

Turned out pretty tasty.  Took advice of some other reviews and adjusted the flour to 2 cups - 1 each of white and whole wheat.  Used 1 cup of the chocolate chips and 1 of butterscotch, and walnuts.  They are a little dry, but very tasty.  Also as other reviewers said, they DO NOT spread. So if you don't want thick cookies you definitely need to flatten them.

Very, very yummy cookies! I used half whole wheat flour, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Next time (and there will be a next time) I might add some peanut butter chips for a change. These don't spread much, so make sure to press them a bit down before baking.

Almost 5 stars! my only issue was so much brown sugar. I've made the recipe twice and the second time around I did half and half white and brown sugar...that little tweak made them that much better! Threw in some Heath toffee chips and semi sweet and milk chocolate chips. got a review from a friend that they were "the best cookie i've ever eaten"! thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies were simply wonderful.  I do agree with the previous comments that the dough is a tad stiffer than average, and I will take a bit more care with shaping them during placement on the cookie sheet in the future.  However, I don't think anyone cares about the funky shape of he first batch :)

This recipes is fantastic!  I only had white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips so I used those up and added walnuts because my brother can't eat any other nuts.  Everyone in my family eats these 3 at a time and they never last more than a week. Thanks so much!

5 stars, plus one. Best cookie recipe EVER. I have received so many compliments when I bring these cookies with me I am starting to think people like my cookies more than me. Just try it, you'll love them, very rich and decadent. And addictive! I used receipe as is, however I us salted butter in my cookie recipes because I like that salty/sweet combo.

This is my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. It is amazing just as written but I have varied the flavors/quantity of chips and also used walnuts or no nuts.  ALWAYS a big hit and everyone loves them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a GREAT cookie recipe.  After minor adjustments for my high altitude, it NEVER fails me.  I sometimes improvise with other add-ins:  peanut butter chips, caramel bits, different nuts, flaxseed, etc  Kids and adults alike LOVE these cookies.  It is nearly impossible to stop from eating the dough out of the mixing bowl.  But hey, we all know that cookie dough has no calories until it is baked.  :-D

My new favorite cookie! I only changed the semi-sweet chocolate chips to milk chocolate.everything else the same. I got 1 1/2 dozen large cookies. had to mix the oats and chips in by hand. very stiff dough. did roll into a log and cut.instead of dropping by teaspoon full.so very good! would like to share them with my work friends.but probably wont.they are that good. so glad I found this recipe.thanks cara for sharing your fabulous recipe! (they are sweet)

Great cookies!  I halved the recipe. I put in equal amounts of dark, semi-sweet chocolate and buterscotch chips.  Substituted 1/2 cup of shredded wheat for the oats - wasn't sure how that would turn out but it did! Will definately do it again.

A very tasty morsel, I had no vanilla or butterscotch chips so I added some peanut butter chips instead. They turned out perfect and I didn't have to bake them longer than suggested. Thank you for the recipe! They are amazing :)

They are still baking and we have almost finished off the 1st sheet!  I used butterscotch, dark and semi sweet chips.  WOW!  Super sweet and tasty. I reduced the butter by 1/2 cup since we were out and subbed some flaxmeal. The kids helped put them together and are really enjoying eating them.  I will most likely not be able to comment on how they keep since they should be gone by tomorrow.  Will make again for sure.

These are really good cookies. I didn't have vanilla chips and doubled the chocolate (also had some leftover jumbo choc. chips that I threw in). Used two heaping cups of oats - may do more next time. Definitely use salted butter - the salt complements the sweet very well. Will make again.

These are "Super Chip" cookies! Just eating one was sweet enough for me (at least for 20 min or so). Love the oatmeal and nuts added in (I used pecans). I'm a big cookie snob, so I give these 4 stars, but they were as easy to make as any other oatmeal cookie, and everybody loved them!

Makes a hearty, sweet cookie. Our dough made around 60 2" treats.  We added scor bits and used butterscotch chipits.  Also substituted toasted almond slices for pecans.

I LOVE these cookies. They remind me of the 7 layer bars I love to make, only, these cookies don't have near the calorie or sugar count. I don't like nuts in my cookies, so I left them out. 
I love how soft they turn out. Yummy

I really wanted a monster cookie with butterscotch chips in it.  I have found what I've been looking for!  I made the dough one night, kept it in the fridge and then baked it the next day for guests.  They turned out great.  I used 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and 1 cup butterscotch chips.  Next time I think I'll try some mini M&Ms in the mix.  One thing to note, at least after being refridgerated the dough didn't spread out much so I could have put more on a sheet and bigger scoops of dough.  I was also happy to find them still chewy the next day, just the way I like them.

These cookies are amazing and so quick to make!  I excluded the vanilla chips and nuts (didn't have any on hand) and they were still great.  Next time, I will add the nuts for added texture and flavor.   These remind me of a cowboy cookie, but better.  You have to try this recipe.

This is an excellent way to use up partial bags of chips!  My husband and I both thought they were a tad too sweet so the next time I make them I will cut back on the sugar.  Thank you for submitting!

Well - they ARE called "Kitchen Sink" Cookies.  I used up leftovers from my Christmas cookie bake.  I used up from my pantry about one cup each of milk chocolate chips, raisins, chopped pecans, and coconut.  I wanted to use oats but I was out so used about 4 packets of brown sugar cinnamon instant oatmeal.  That made them too sweet for me but the family loved them.  I would rate it 5 stars if the recipe noted the option of using other ingredients.

these are so good.  rich.  I've made them twice and both times, have gotten rave reviews even from some male friends and family commenting on how good they were.  I think the secret here is that it uses all brown sugar.  the dough does not need to be chilled.  I use my large size pampered chef cookie scoop and it still makes a nice big batch(which is good because these will go fast.)  I usually add a few raisins and a pinch of cinnamon; it is not really noticeable to a large degree but just enhances the flavor.  I always stick a slice of bread in my cookie container to keep them soft on the inside.  they store well with a slice of bread.  the oats gives them a nice crunch.  they are everything one likes in a cookie; crisp on the edges, chewy, and soft on the inside.  just a great recipe with all kinds of possibilities.  I changed it up but kept proportions the same.  I like mine personally with 1 cup butterscotch morsels and half cup of white choc. chips.  something about the buttersotch with the oats and brown sugar that is extra yummy.

I was looking for a basic "kitchen sink" cookie recipe to tweak to my liking and this one was perfect.  To make it healthier, I:  cut the sugar in half; used 1/4 cup unsalted butter, 1/2 cup organic virgin coconut oil and 1/2 cup raw smooth almond butter; used organic white whole wheat flour; and, cut the salt in half.  Increased baking soda to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Add-ins were:  2 cups Ghirardelli 60% dark chocolate morsels; 1 16 oz. package of fresh gooey dates which I chopped and then shook in some flour; and 1 cup chopped organic walnuts.  I loved that the recipe uses a good amount of rolled oats (I used quick oats).  Formed generous tablespoon+ disks by hand and pressed onto parchment lined baking sheets.  Baked at 370 degrees for 10 minutes.  Big, puffy cookies with great texture.  The whole family loved them.  Nice and substantial.  Delicious.  Tasted great warm and at room temperature.

I bake for two and this receipe has a high yeild.  I baked half and froze the rest for next week.  Everything you want in a cookie.  I used no vanilla chips and added coconut and peanut butter. Turned out great. Seems like if you use common ingredients, you can make different versions.

I skipped the vanilla baking chips and doubled the butterscotch chips instead. I also replaced the pecans with chopped macadamia nuts. The dough was really hard to mix (this was a much bigger recipe than I expected - should have used my biggest bowl). It was quite stiff. But it turned out great and tastes wonderful! I like the texture added by the oatmeal, and hopefully the oatmeal gives it some redeeming nutritional value as well :).

need to add in peanut butter and raisins and M&Ms instead of the vanilla chips.  Much better :)

I left out the vanilla chips and doubled the butterscotch chips instead.  These cookies are delicious!

This is just an "add-what-you-want" cookie recipe, but it turned out really well! I used oats, chocolate pieces, chopped Snickers, chopped Reese's peanut butter cups, and pecans. I don't think they needed a little extra water like some suggested. I added it and they were a little flat. Next time I won't add extra water. Overall, YUMMY.

I love making these cookies. I even forgot to buy Butterscotch chips once so I mixed in some more chocolate chips. They were still delicious. Not your everyday cookie, but they are great alone or a glass of milk. :)

I do not use the white chocolate chips.  I use a bag of chocolate chips and a bag of butterscotch chips.  They are a hit every time I make them.  They are the most requested cookie I make, and my most requested recipe. Be sure not to overcook them.  

Also, I use a small cookie scoop and get about 120 cookies.  I cook them for 7 minutes.  You can cook half the batch and scoop the rest of the batter onto a plate and freeze.  Once frozen, then bag the up.

LOVE this recipe! I didn't have vanilla chips so I just added equal amounts of chocolate and butterscotch chips.

Wow.  Rich, fantastic cookie with so many ways for change-ups.  One taste of the batter and I knew I was in for a treat.  These will be the top cookie in our exchange tonight, I'm sure ;0)  thanks so much!!

These were so good!!! I sent them to my deployed husband & his co-workers & they were asking for more in only a couple days! I left out the vanilla chips because I'm not a big fan, but I imagine they're even more amazing with those in if you like them. These will definitely be made over & over again.

My husband says these are his new favorite cookie!  They are truly yummy!  One thing I done different was I blended the oatmeal in the food processor, gives a wonderful texture to the cookies!
