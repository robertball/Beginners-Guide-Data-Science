Perfect! I make this every weekend! I use 3 whole eggs. Tips: Sift your flour or use a sieve when the batter is done. This will take out the flour chunks for a smoother consistency. Also measure the flour by using a spoon to pour it into the cup. If you scoop a measuring cup, it packs the flour and you get a doughy crepe.  Find the right temp! When you first pour the batter, it shouldn't wrinkle too much when spreading, or your pan is too hot. No dalmation spotted crepes!   Technique! Pour your batter on a very lightly greased pan (short spray of Pam is fine) You know you're ready to flip it when the edges begin to curl, the middle batter isn't glossy and wet looking, and you can shake the pan to move the crepe.  Use a large thin spatula, flip, and cook another 15 seconds. Pick up the pan and slide the crepe onto a plate. When you're ready to make another crepe, don't set your pan on the burner for more than a few seconds, or it gets too hot. 1/3 c. for a 9" skillet is perfect.  I serve mine with strawberry compote and cottage cheese. Yum!  LOW FAT: You can sub the butter for margarine, the sugar for a zero calorie sweetener (Truvia or Splenda taste best), and even replace yolks with egg whites or Egg Beaters.

REALLY good.  That is a direct quote from my kids.  My 2 cents-- I threw all my ingredients into the blender and poured from there...  much easier.

Well, I took the advice of others right off the bat.  I added a little more milk and less butter and vanilla.  They turned out perfectly.  I might try creaming the egg yolks next time to see if I like that texture better.  

We made some awsome cream cheese filling for them.  8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup of powdered sugar, 4 tbs butter, and 1 tbs hazelnut syrup.  Some pecans added to the crepes with this filling give it a good texture and a little bit nuttier flavor.  

Best crepes I've ever had with the small changes.

This recipe was delicious and sooo easy!  I have never had success with crepes like I did with this recipe.  They do smell heavenly when they are cooking up.  My 4 year old and 6 year old ate four each, not to mention my husband.  They kept raving about breakfast hours after we were finished.  I used the filling suggested in the basic crepes recipe by TRISTIA (fry up some chopped apples with 1 T. butter, 1 T. pwd sugar, dash of nutmeg and cinnamon until tender).  They were wonderful!

My boyfriend and his sister thought these were absolutely perfect. I used a variation of a recipe that another reviewer posted for the filling (8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup of powdered sugar, 4 tbsp butter, 1 tbsp dark corn syrup, and 1/2 tsp vanilla). I also used the method posted by the first reviewer, they could not have turned out more perfectly. This recipe gets 5 stars hands down.

I just loved this recipe.  It was so simple and delicious.  The only change I owould make is that I found the batter just a bit thick so I added about 2-3 tablespoons more milk.  I will definantly make this again. Thanks!

I tell you what, I lived in Germany for 6 years and have become a 'crepe specialist';)  I could not have told you the difference between these crepes and the ones I ate fresh out of the stands in Frankfurt.  I used Nutella as the filling on the inside..heaven!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  Brings back fantastic memories.

Excellent!  Per Suggestions, Upped the milk to almost 1 3/4 cup, 3 whole eggs.  Shorted the vanilla by 1/2 tbs.  3 tbs POWDERED sugar, and four tbs melted butter.  Tossed in a pinch of nutmeg.  From "OVERNIGHT BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST" recipe on here, I whipped up the blueberry syrup (1 cp sugar, 2 tbs corn starch, 1 cp water, 1 cp blueberries, 1 tbs butter), which was the perfect topping (Don't fill crepes with this though - far too sweet - just a drizzle on top is PERFECT!)  Yup, be makin' this one again.

These are the greasiest crepes I have ever tasted!!! Next time I think that I'll try 1 Tbls of butter instead of five. Had to pat each one of them with paper towels to make them less greasy than the bacon I cooked. Definitely 2 cups of milk. The vanilla was a nice touch.

Didn't have a problem with greasiness in our house; strange.  We did add the additional half cup of milk to make this more pourable, and the crepes were universally loved by our three boys!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now... my kids ask for 'skinny pancakes' EVERY Saturday! TIPS...I use a regular frying pan and keep them warm in the oven until I accumulate a pile. The only changes I make are: Use 2 whole eggs instead of just 3 yolks, Add an additional 1/2 C. of milk to thin out the batter. This helps when you swirl the batter around the pan to get a nice thin crepe. Other than that, Perfect!! I don't even have to grease the pan. I had never made crepes before trying this recipe, but now I feel like a pro!! Thanks for the recipe, it is now a tradition in our house too :)
For an easy topping simmer blueberries and strawberries in some pancake syrup & a bit of water. Mash them up a bit and you have a delicious 2-berry syrup. I have always wanted to try these crepes as a dessert topped with ice cream and berry sauce!

My family and I can't thank you enough for the recipe.  I found this recipe 2 weeks ago, and we've made these already a dozen times.  We did not make any changes to the recipe, and they came out perfect.  I did use the advise of using 1/3 cup of batter in a 9 or 10 inch skillet.  I found that keeping the glass stovetop set to 3 1/2 made these come out perfect every time.

5 stars for these! These are my first ever homemade crepes. I added and extra 1/4 cup of milk so the batter was thinner and easier to spread. I sifted the dry Ing. into the wet and mixed well. Use a 10" skillet pan so you have spreading room and easier room to flip, keep temp on low so they don't brown too much. As they get done, stack between pieces of parchment paper or wax paper so they don't stick. We used nutella and fresh sliced strawberries in ours, dusted with powdered sugar. They were delish, even the kids loved them. (to be blogged)

Excellent recipe.... although for the millions times I have made this I always just used the whole egg out of sheer laziness.  TOday I had egg yolks and used just them... And I would say just use the whole egg!  I got more crepes out of it, and they are thinner and more like the original!

Very Good; however, I would add more milk to make the consistancy more smooth/thinner.  Also, adding apples fried in butter/sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg is a wonderful addition --- tastes  just like an apple dumpling!

This was a recipe that came up in the ingredient search for egg yolks, but no egg whites.  I had never made crepes before this, so I suspected it would be an adventure.  I don't own a crepe pan, but do have a good non-stick flat bottom fry pan.  The first 2 were reject crepes, and then I realized that I needed to put more batter in the pan to cover the bottom.  After that, and getting the hang of flipping, the rest turned out great looking - and fantastic tasting.  My kids and I tried one with the citrus blueberry sauce from this site, and yum, yum.  The rest are being refrigerated for breakfast tomorrow.  I will not be afraid of making crepes anymore.  Thanks!

Y-U-M-M-Y!  I love this recipe.  It is so easy to make.  Definately a crowd pleaser.  I got lots of oooh's and aaah's.  I used the recipe portions as listed.  I did add 3 whole eggs as others recommended.  Also, added a little more milk to thin out.  I added a little at a time to desired consistency. For me - it was kind of like a medium/heavy cream consistency.  Everything else the same.  It was a little lumpy but did not affect the outcome at all.  I used a 9" skillet over medium heat.  About every three I would spray with PAM. I poured a small amount in pan then moved around so that mix would spread all along the bottom. I would wait until ends would curl up a little.  Turning them with a spatula was very awkward for me. Since the pan had PAM - I was able to pick the edge up with my finger and actually turn it over with my hands.  Almost like a super thin tortilla.  Very fast and easy. For the filling someone recommended a very simple receipe - I doubled it and this is what it was 8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners sugar & 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I actually popped the cream cheese in the microwave for about 1 minute.  Then added the sugar and vanilla.  I also added a little heavy cream to make it easier to stir.  It was a little thicker than cake frosting.  It was very easy to put the filling on the crepe.  For the top - I cut about 1 1/2 lbs of fresh strawberries.  I placed them in a bow and sprinkled with regular white sugar about 1 tablespoon.  Mixed them and let t

This is a very easy recipe and my family loves when I make crepes for breakfast.  We've even done this the morning after they've had sleep-overs and their friends rave about them too.  We typically fill them with pie filling, such as apple, blueberry, and cherry pie fillings, but we've also used Nutella and sliced bananas too, which is another favorite.  I have even altered the recipe by adding a 1/4 cup more milk and 1/3 cup cocoa powder, to make them chocolate crepes.

Easy and very tasty recipe!  They were a bit doughy, but I will sift my flour next time.  Nonetheless, I was still happy with the results.  

As a filling made two small pots of sauce- in each pot add
 3-4 tablespoons of sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup of heavy cream
2 teaspoons of vanilla extract- 

On a medium heat stirring constantly (to avoid scorching).  When sauce is creamy add two cups of thickly chopped bananas in one pan, and strawberries (halved)  in the other.  Lower cook temp to low for a 2-3 minutes, then take off the stove.  
Fill crepes, fold and garnish with whipped cream on top. 
My family loved them!  Alors, bon appetite!

Fabulous.  I prepared exactly as written except- my vanilla is extra strength pure so I only added  1 TB.  After making the first one I added a shot more milk...and again after the second and then the batter was 100% perfection.  I whipped by hand with my wire whip and I did not sift- maybe that is why I needed a bit more milk, but I had no problem with lumps.  I used my 10 in. nonstick egg pan which did not need additional oil. I cooked them on med low (gas stove) and got just a tiny touch of golden to them- so pretty, almost like having a lacey print on them when I flipped them over. I got about 20 crepes from this recipe - from the 10 in. skillet and liking them very thin.  I will add this recipe to my "forever" keepers.

These are the best crepes! My kids love them and so do I! My daughter loves french toast but hates the egg part so I dip texas toast into this crepe batter and then put it on the crepe pan and cook until light brown. She loves it! Thank you for this recipe!

These were absolutely perfect crepes. The vanilla was a great addition, and contrasted nicely with the tartness of the blueberry sauce I accompanied the crepes with. I think next time I'll try to use Nutella and Bananas for filling, my daughter will go nuts!

This is my go-to crepe recipe! The whole family RAVES about them! I always use just a couple extra tablespoons of milk to thin out the batter a bit.

These were great crepes! We loved the vanilla! I did add just a bit more liquid as others have stated to make it thin enough to spread around. I changed the serving size from 12 to 4. Worked well. Next time I might use less butter (by just a little) because it was a little greasy. Great recipe though!

This is a pretty easy recipe to make.  I made a cream cheese filling with 8 oz cheese, 1/4 cup sugar and dash vanilla.  I never had to flip the crepe.  When it looked set, I just dolloped the cheese mixture into the center and rolled up and left for 30 sec to 1 min to warm the cheese.  After removing from the skillet, I topped with warm canned apple/cranberry pie filling, whipped topping and powdered sugar.  YUMMMM!

Wow--an excellent recipe; it turned out exactly how it said it would, and the vanilla flavor was excellent.  I served it with fresh whipped creme that also had vanilla and sugar in it along with fresh strawberries..

I made these for mother's day, and I couldn't have been happier.  I chose this recipe because of the vanilla, what a yummy addition to crepes!  We covered them with jam, bananas, tripple berries (a frozen package that I thawed), Nutela, whip cream, & powdered sugar (though not all at once).  I found that it was easiest to pour the batter into a pitcher (a 2 quart plastic one we use for juice), that way it was simple to pour just the right amount into the hot pan with little to no dripping.  I also found that removing the pan from the burner to pour the batter made for a "less cooked" crepe - the ones I poured directly into the pan were browner on the first side, which, although just as delicious, didn't look as pretty.  I love this recipe and will use it from now on when I make crepes.

These are ok first time around, but the batter is way too thick and 2 TABLESPOONS??? of vanilla is crazy, so I suggest 1 1/3 cups flour and 1 2/3 cups milk and 1 TEASPOON of vanilla. We ate them with strawberrys and the vanilla was overpowering and I love vanilla. They smell good while cooking and dont stick at all. Will re-try next week with less flour more milk and see how it goes. Couldnt just tip the pan to spread had to literally spread them.

"You outdid yourself this time!" was the response from my family members when I made this for brunch. I reduced the flour a bit and added more milk, and threw some blueberries sprinkled with sugar with a 1/4 c. water over high heat to form a sauce. Topped with whipped cream, this tastes like dessert, only a little healthier!

This was really delicious but way too thick. I had to add more milk to my batter while I was making the crepes and then I thought they were just right. I will definitely make this again!

These are yummy! As others have mentioned, they turned out a bit oily even though I reduced the butter to 4 Tbsp (and upped the milk a bit). I think you don't really need to grease your pan at all. Next time I won't. I used powdered sugar in place of regular white sugar and used a whole egg in addition to two egg yolks (I had two yolks reserved from another recipe). I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. For filling I made the cream cheese-butter-powdered sugar-vanilla recipe suggested by several folks here (thanks!) and also cut up a ripe peach and simmered it lightly with cinnamon until the pieces were warm through and a bit syrupy. Yum!

I have not tried this recipe yet but will, they sound wonderful. Several years ago, my niece told me to add vanilla extract to pancake batter. OMG, they just melt in your mouth so I can only imagine these crepes will do so also.

Very good crepe with a fragrant vanilla flavor.  My batter was just a bit thick for crepes, so I did add a little more milk.  They cooked up quickly into very thin/delicate crepes and were a breeze to flip w/o breaking up.  Filled with fresh fruit, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, and a dollop of whip cream.

First time crepe maker, I tried another recipe and having it not quite work, I went for this recipe because of the story and a shared familiar for the smell of vanilla.  The crepes turned out wonderful and made the house smell delicious.!..

I also used 3 whole eggs, increased milk to 1 3/4 cups (skim worked great), and reduced the butter to about 2 1/2 Tbs. They turned out pretty good. We filled them with a little nutella and syrupy strawberries and raspberries. SO Yummy! Thanks for sharing!!

Good, typical crepe recipe, nothing spectacular about it. Filled mine with Hersheys Chocolate Almond spread, Sugared (syrupy) strawberries, and bananas. Very good, but again, just as good as other crepe recipes i've tried.

Didn't sift, just threw all the ingredients in a blender (using whole eggs) and gave it a quick mix.   Poured directly into a non-stick pan, swirled it a bit to make the batter spread thinly, and waited until the edges browned before turning over with a spatula. They turned out beautifully and tasted delicious!  This is a very easy recipe.  I would recommend it to anyone.

I replaced the milk with buttermilk.  It adds a whole new dimension to the flavour of these crepes.  But I had to add a bit extra water (about a half cup) to thin it out enough.  Also I added even more vanilla.  And it was the good stuff from Mexico.  Excellent!!!

I felt that the proportions were far off in this recipe. The batter was VERY thick when I made it exactly as described. Almost like a pancake batter texture. I added 1/2 cup more milk to thin out the batter. They tasted OK. I'll try a different crepe recipe next time.

I eliminated the vanilla and did only half the sugar and double the salt to make savory crepes with this recipe. Mixed it in a blender and used a nonstick pan. The first one I did was a little thick, so I added some more milk to make the batter thinner, and worked very well. I'll be using this one again.

This Crepe recipe is amazing just the way it is. I sift my flour and use my Kitchen Aid mixer to do all the work. I usually fill them wth strawberries and cool whip, or nutella and cool whip. The kids love them and there are never any leftovers. This is the first recipe I tried and I see no reason to try another.

This is a delicious crepe. I used my blender to mix the ingredients. After mixing the milk, eggs, vanilla and melted butter first in the blender, I then added the flour,sugar and salt. Blended really well and it worked great. If I was to use a savory filling I would eliminate the sugar.

I made some changes to these to avoid dairy and they still turned out excellent. I used almond milk and replaced the butter with about 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance. Very good!!

The kids are loving these!  I found that the butter in the batter keeps me from having to add oil to to the pan.  We'll cook these again.

I thought that crepes would be a great Sunday start for the day!  I was pleasantly surprised when I ate them!  I filled them with homemade pumpkin butter, and whipped cream and topped with syrup!  You should try it!  You'll be surprised too!

This is sooo easy and delicious! I am a terrible pancake maker, but these were so easy to make that I will be making these all the time now. I used the advice from reviewer RyanMichelle and they were perfect. For the filling I used chocolate chips, just picked blackberries, and vanilla yogurt. Yum!!!

Absolutely delicious!  My girls couldn't get enough of these crepes!  All I added to this dish was whipped cream, though when I had a coffee get together at my home I added blueberries and blueberry sauce.  SO GOOD!

Followed the suggestions of adding more milk and using 3 whole eggs. These were AMAZING! I added a cream cheese mixture inside (8 oz. cream cheese with 1/3 cup sugar and a dash of vanilla) and topped with Lingonberries. EXCELLENT! Husband loved them as well.

These crepes were so amazing good!! Having no butter on hand, I used olive oil instead. I also put extra oil in the pan, and I patted it dry afterwards. The oil helped to cook it better. My whole family loved this~ including my mother!!

Mmmmm , sooo good. I gave it a 4 because I listened to other reviews and added 1/2 cup more milk and 1/2 tsp. less vanilla. I stirred mixture with a whisk until it wasn't lumpy and it turned out yummy. The whole family loved it too. Will definately make this again.

so good! i actually add three to four tablespoons of vanilla and they're even better. friends always ask me to make these for them. i add more milk than called for to get a smoother, thinner consistency. the crepe spreads better in the pan this way and you get a couple extra crepes out of it. i also use a hand mixer, otherwise i always end up with little clumps of flour that wont go away. love this recipe!

Made these for a friend and I, they were wonderful.  I made the filling suggested by another reviewer and added blueberries inside and on top with a touch of whipped cream...YUM!  My 4 yr old loved them as well, eating the leftover crepes, plain, straight out of the refrigerator...cold!

WOW! These were really good! The vanilla is such nice addition. I totally thought I was making waffle cones in my kitchen! I followed others' suggestions and used 2 cups of milk and cut the melted butter to 3 1/2 tsps. My four year old gobbled these up :)

These are delicious, although the batter can be a little lumpy (I distractedly added the melted butter to the dry ingredients, exacerbating the problem) but just blending with a mixer takes care of it.  I also used 1 T vanilla extract and 1 T banana flavoring, and added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. They were easy to flip in the pan and tasted absolutely amazing stuffed with ice cream, banana slices, berries, and homemade berry jam.

This was excellent.  I'm a fairly novice cook, and I have to say that this was really easy and fast, so don't be afraid to try it.  You can add a bit more milk if you like a thinner crepe.  I used a strong Mexican Vanilla, and added a splash of chambord liquor. I also added a dash of nutmeg.  I filled them with fresh blueberries and a devonshire creme recipe that I got from a local GREAT LAKES COOKBOOK in Buffalo, New York.  VERY GOOD.  I suggest purchasing a good du Buyer crepe pan.  I just received one for a housewarming gift, and I can't imagine making crepes in the frying pan now.  It made it so much easier to handle, and the crepes were the perfect shape because of it. But I also hear people who use any old frying pan, and they say it works fine.

These are delicious! My family loved these crepes. I read some of the other reviews and used some of their hints. I used 4 TBLs of butter instead of 5, a tiny bit less vanilla. The 1/4 cup of batter for each one was the perfect amount. I made the filling w/ 8oz. cream cheese, 1 c. powdered sugar, 4 TBLs butter, and 1 TBL pure maple syrup. I put sliced bananas on top of the filling before rolling up. Yum! Any fresh fruit would be great in them. Will definitely make these again.

These were WONDERFUL and had a great taste all on their own.  Anything you add to them makes them even better.    One thing...I added more milk because I like my crepes VERY thin and these were on the thicker side.    But if you want a simple and DELICIOUS shot at crepes, this is it!

These had nice flavor and were easy to make.  I too used whole eggs.  We only had medium eggs, so I used four instead of three.  Milk is very expensive here in Puerto Rico, so I used 1 1/2 cups of water and 6 Tblsp of powdered milk.  You'd never know it.  We served them with sour cream and home made jam.  DELICIOSO!!

I added a little extra vanilla, and next time I'll probably add more still, because I love vanilla.  These were great, though.  We had them in the morning with some apple filling I made, and then later in the day, my fiance used the few remaining to make some almost burrito-like things with egg & salsa (I think?), and those were good, too :)

This recipe is awesome, just as it is. I make this every Sunday morning and fill with either Nutella, or I chop up strawberries and mix with a little sugar, or apples with a little cinammon and sugar. Top with powdered sugar!! Delicious.  Kids love it, especially the Nutella!!

Great crepes my kids loved them. I just added a little more milk to make the batter thinner, 3 tablespoons of butter instead of 5. I also used 3 whole eggs as someone else suggested. We filled the crepes with a tablespoon of chocolate chips and the warmth of the crepes melted the chocolate chips. Thanks

My mother always made these ,as i do now for my family. Another filling is sweetened cottage cheese. Just add sugar & vanilla to your taste to small curd cottage cheeese,place them in a oven proof pie plate, & warm in the oven for 10 minutes, sprikle with 10x sugar & you have a gourmet dessert!

Just wonderful!  I've used whole eggs, a little less melted butter and they turned out great!  Don't worry about lumps in the mix - you can't tell or taste once the batter is cooked.  This batter worked great - I was able to flip crepes without the spatula!  Will make again, definitely!

I came onto allrecipes and this was the front page. I immediately had a craving for crepes and decided why not! I followed other's suggestions and sifted the flour and had no issues with lumps, increased the milk to 1 3/4 cups to make the batter thinner, and I used 4 tablespoons of butter and had no issues with them coming out greasy. They came out very tasty, served with butter and powdered sugar, vermont maple syrup, fresh musk melon and baked ham. I was pretty satisfied!

Very yummy! This was my first time making crepes and I was nervous that they would be too runny, dry, break when I rolled them.... They were perfect! I have made them several times and they turn out great everytime! We have filled them with sliced strawberries, blueberries and bananas.

this recipe is simply awesome. some other reviewers said to sift the flour or to sieve the batter for a smoother consistency. for those of us who have extra time, i suggest letting the batter cool in the refrigerator over night and mix it up again when you're ready to cook it.

I love this recipe! I uses it almost every Sunday morning for family breakfast! It tastes so good with cheese and sausage as a filler. Somehow the vanilla taste is perfect with the cheese and sausage. I love it! We also love carmel,jam, nutella and other fun fillers. I just lay it all out and let the kids choose. Thanks for sharing!

Just tried making crepes for the first time with my daughter and used this recipe.  They turned out great, so yummy!  It took me a couple of times to realize that I had the burner turned on too high, so I turned it down a bit and they cooked much better!  We used a cream cheese filling (softened in the microwave, stirred in some confectioners sugar and cinnamon) and some carmelized apples! :)

Really good recipe, the texture and flavor is perfect! Made mine by mixing everything in the blender and let sit for about 5-10 minutes before preparing. In the meantime made fillings. One caramelized banana with brown sugar and cinnamon and the other with canned guavas. Served also with vanilla ice cream. Thanks!

With a few changes, these were AWESOME!  I cut back the butter to 3.5 tbls and vanilla to 1 tabls...I added roughly 2.5 cups of milk (as needed) and I used light brown sugar as opposed to white... I threw everything into a blender, and then strained the batter for lumps....I refrigerated it for a few hours, and it was perfect!  I stuffed mine with fresh blueberries and  marscapone, and topped with homemade blueberry compote....YUM!!  I also did a savory version of these for lunch....I omitted the vanilla, cut the sugar back to 1 tbls, stuffed with ham and sharp cheddar and topped with a dijon mayo sauce....mmmmmmm....super easy!!

For those of you who say the crepes are too greasy, make sure your pan is hot enough or the batter will absorb most of the shortening........

Amazing!!!  I followed the tip of the reviewer suggesting a cream cheese filling except I substituted about 1 tablespoon of vanilla for the hazelnut syrup, and then we topped the crepes with sliced fresh strawberries.  Soooooo delicious; we'll be making this again!

Best Crepe by far!  Although I add 3 table spoons of pure natural vanilla extract and only use 1/4 teaspoon of salt.

I love these crepes. I eat them once a week now! I took the advice of P4C and use a filler similar to this  "8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup of powdered sugar, 4 tbs butter, and 1 tbs hazelnut syrup. Some pecans added to the crepes with this filling give it a good texture" I don't measure, but I use cream cheese, strawberries or nectarines, a little honey, a little powdered sugar, pecans, and regular maple syrup. I improvise depending on whats available in my kitchen. LOVE!

I have made these from the exact recipe several times and have been very impressed and received great comments! However, this weekend I had a guest with a dairy allergy and made a few MODIFICATIONS... Substituted the milk for Light Vanilla Soymilk... and they were even better! PS - I also intended to use vegan margarine, but I forgot it in the microwave melting - and they turned out fantastic.. Bonus less fat!

The perfect crepe for any sweet filling. I don't change a single thing and I have only received rave reviews. I spray my pan with Pam, move the batter around in the pan until it completely covers the bottom and is as thin as possible, and wait until the edges curl up to flip it. For me, a non-stick pan is a necessity, and once I have a stack of crepes I fill them with strawberries, roll them, and dust them with powdered sugar. My husband says I make the best crepes in the universe.

this was the first crepe recipe I used and it was pretty good. The crepes came out a little thicker so I think I'll thin it out a bit next time, but otherwise they tasted great! I made 1/3 of the recipe and got 4 mini crepes (I used a small frying pan) and I used the sauteed apples recipe from this site for the filling. A little sprinkling of icing sugar and these were fantastic! I will be making them again.

I have a crepe receipe, but decided to use this b/c of all the great reviews.  It didn't make as many as it said it would, which wasn't a big deal, but may be for others.  Didn't have the sweet taste of vanilla, as everyone said they did.  My dad said they were very dry. Overall they were fine, but nothing spectacular & don't plan on making them again. Will be sticking to my own receipe.

These were the easiest crepes to make! I did reduce the butter to 3 Tbs but they still turned out fantastic! I made a cherry sauce (canned cherries, sugar and cornstarch) in addition to the cream cheese filling. I will be making again and trying different fillings, thanks for the great recipe.

Okay, I don't think I've ever actually made CREPES before, but this was irresistible, and they came out beautifully. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I found I needed to add a bit more milk to thin the batter somewhat. This probably depends on where you're located in the world, and the humidity level/altitude where you are (flour is dry here in the AZ mountains). I think using the egg yolks rather than whole eggs is a plus ... they make for a dense, rich crepe that marries perfectly with fresh berries and lightly sweetened whipped cream. DO use a good quality crepe pan for even browning. I made crepes about 8" in diameter, and the recipe made about 10 in total. It was fun to do, and they smelled great "baking" on the griddle!

I threw everything in the blender, including 3 whole eggs but next time I will spoon my flour into the cup because it tasted a bit floury. Believe me, nobody complained but I knew they could have been better.

This was my second attempt with making crepes and I will have to say that this recipe is my favorite.  I wanted to make them ahead of time for dessert for the family but I kept eating them!! You can always make more though!! I did add a bit more milk like other reviews have suggested.

I used two whole eggs, 4 tablespoons of butter  and added a tad more milk, because you don't want it too thick. It should be soupy. Make the crepes as thin as possible, and spray or grease the pan before each crepe. I found this to allow them to cook more evenly. Using a ladle to put the crepe batter in the pan works well, and i also didn't use a crepe pan, as i didn't have one. Lemon juice and sugar is delicious inside, as is nutella with bananas. If you don't sift the flour, whisking the batter works just as well, and is also easier cleanup.

Wow, these were so easy to make and came out perfect! I had 4 egg yolks leftover, and needed a good recipe to use them up. Someone suggested this recipe. I waited about a week before finally deciding to make it, and am I glad I did! I upped the servings to 16 so that I can use all four egg yolks. I eyeballed the sugar and salt, and completely forgot the butter for the first two crepes!! I added a few tbsp melted butter to the rest, and both with and without butter came out great! The ones with butter had a bit more crispness to them. I used a non-stick fry pan and didn't add any grease whatsoever to it. They came out perfect, and none of them stuck or gave me any trouble! Filled one with peanut butter and cherry pie filling, and my kids loved it. They even loved them plain! I'll fill the others with nutella and bananas! Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

Heavenly! I used 3 whole eggs and the batter was perfect! I think it would have been too thick with only egg yolks. (Everything else I followed exactly.) My favorite way to prepare these is to smother jam on them, roll 'em up, drizzle on some melted butter, and sprinkle powdered sugar on top! So delicious!!

I really love crepes and I really love vanilla so I thought this recipe would fit me perfectly and I was right.  These are delicious every time.  I used whole eggs instead of just the yolks because I mis-read the directions but they turned out amazing regardless! Try nutella with your crepes- DELICIOUS!

Loved!  I followed recipe exactly.  My whole family loved.  I used the suggested cream cheese recipe from other reviews for filling with fresh strawberries! Excellent!

These were my first attempt at making crepes ever! Definitely won't be my last... I made the recipe as is, although I did add just a splash more milk. Delicious! A perfect golden color, and great texture!  Mine were a little thick, but that's just because I need more practice.  For hubby and kids filled with some leftover cream cheese fruit dip, and topped with strawberry glaze.  For mine, left it flat.  Topped with the leftover egg whites, cheddar cheese. And sausage gravy, again, delicious!  Kind of like a breakfast pizza..  Will make again & again.. Make sure you sift the flour though, I know it made a big difference!

Be warned: without modifications, these are not crepes. they turned out as thin pancakes, but not thin or eggy enough to be called crepes. Need more milk and whole eggs as others have suggested.

I used 3 whole eggs and 1 cup + 3-5 tbsp milk. I like my crepes very thin so I used just enough batter to coat the bottom of the pan and swirl the pan around in the air until it all sticks. Then, cook about a minute on first side and 2-3 minutes on the other. Also in addition to using the suggested cream cheese filling I made a berry sauce that was to die for! Berry Sauce: 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup strawberries, 1/2 cup blueberries. Directions: Bring water to a boil and add granulated sugar & brown sugar. Stir until fully dissolved and remove from heat. Crush/blend strawberries/blueberries and add to pan, stir until thoroughly blended.Place pan on low heat and add about 1 1/2 cups of the powered sugar, stir until no chunks are visible (may want to use a whisk). Remove from heat and let cool; when cool add remaining cup (or more) to the pan to thicken the sauce a bit.

This is a great basic crepe recipe.  It is a little more thick than a crepe you would get in France or at a French bistro but its easy and yummy!!  I also used 3 whole eggs and went a little scant on the flour. I cooked them in a large skillet because we don't have a crepe pan.

These crepes are amazing!!!  I didn't change a thing and they came out perfectly!  I agree with the previous post you can't scoop the flour with the measuring cup that packs it down and you end up with too much.  For the filling I used 8oz cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons butter and raspberries.  They were all gone within minutes!  Will make again and again!!

this recipe was fantastic just from following the ingredients list toe to toe. theyre not greasy at all, even with so much butter. i used whole eggs instead of just the yolk and mixed it all in the blender. my boyfriend loved them so much he ate about 20! they go great with jam and neutella!

Great Crepes! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and everything was delicious.  Simple and a great variation from the normal pancakes or waffles.  I dusted them with sugar and filled them with a mixture of plain yogurt/cottage cheese and a mixture chopped apples (lightly sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon), grapes, and plum.  Next time I'll add walnuts! Seriously, this was one of the tastiest breakfasts I've ever made, and a little healthy too.  Thanks!

In my family we call these "Mexican Pancakes". The only difference is that they have cinnamon. We just ate them with some butter, but they were very good with some strawberries and whipped cream the next morning. The key is not to use too much oil or else the look doughy and fall apart in the pan. This recipe is a keeper!

I've tried crepe recipes before without success. These, however, turned out perfect. They tasted great and looked so beautiful. Cooking them on low heat for only 30 seconds helped. We topped these crepes with vanilla pudding and blueberries.

When I tried crepes before, I made a huge mess and burnt them all. This recipe was very simple and, I agree, the extra vanilla was heavenly. The only problem I had was when I poured the batter into the pan, it was to thick to move around. So, I added some extra milk (about 1/2 cup). That really allowed it to spread in the pan better. And, though it probably didn't need it, I also added about a teaspoon extra of vanilla. I would definitely recommend this recipe, and trust me, you won't be sorry when your kitchen smells like waffle cones!

This was intense. I am torn between 4 and 5 stars. It tasted excellent and smelled just like sugar cookies when cooking! It was a tad too sweet and I mean a just a tad. I could have easily augmented that by using a less sweet syrup. Other than that it was amazing and I'm definitely keeping this in the rotation for a nice weekend breakfast. The only thing that I disagree with is the number of servings! They were so good I could have eaten half of them by myself. :-)

Topped with confectioners sugar and strawberries. Yum

This was so easy to make.  I wish I had used whole eggs - the crepes were slightly thicker than I wanted, and I think the whites might have made the moister difference.  Excellent taste though!

Excellent recipe.
I have cut it in half, doubled it, tripled it, and even quadrupled it, and it came out great everytime. I add a little more vanilla since i like the taste. Just as it's getting done I like to fill it with chocolate-hazelnut spread or with melted butter and caster sugar. Great treat for kids. Kept batter in the frdge once overnight and made it for breakfast the next morning, still amazing. Enjoy it!

This recipe is everything i was looking for!!! I used Smart Balance intstead of butter, 2 whole eggs instead of the 3 yolks, and a little more milk. I also added a 2 inch piece of vanilla bean to the batter with the extract. They were SLENDID! I chopped up some apples really little and sauteed then with a little brown sugar and smart balance. Then I filled the crepes with it and added some fat free Reddi Whip on the top. Delicious treat.

The crepes came out excellent! They were smooth and rich and are best served with fruit or a type of apple sauce. While making the batter, I added less butter than the recipe called for (about a tablespoon less). In the middle of mixing the ingredients I realized I there wasn't vanilla in the cabinet. However, instead of adding vanilla I added the same amount, if not more (depending on the amount of flavor the crepe had), of cinnamon into the batter. They came out absolutely delicious and I definitely would make this again! Thanks for livening up my breakfast. 
P.S: This was my first time making crepes.

Very good except I needed to thin out the batter a bit with some water.

very tasty!  We made angel food cake, so we have lots of left over yolks.  This was the perfect use for them!  It was my first attempt at making crepes (although I eaten them all over the world).  very pleased with the results.  Althougth I do agree with the suggestion sift the flour.  I will make again!

tasty but very thick compared to traditional crepes. added milk to thin out the batter, should have added an egg b/c it caused the crepes to break apart in the pan when flipping them.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I followed to the T and didn't have any problems as the the reviewers did.  I actually had to make 2 batches for my 4 kids and husband.  I took one reviwers idea with stuffing them with bananas.  I melted some butter and brown sugar and stuffed them with htat YUMMY mixture.  I make a quick "dressing" for the top, I mixed blueberry yogurt with sour cream.
Thanks for the simple recipe!  It's a keeper here at our home.

Great recipe and easy to make, however, even though the aroma from the vanilla is wonderful, it's a bit too strong in flavor, next time I think I am going to add a little bit less vanilla to the mix.

it was a little thin but i reduced the ammount from 12 to 2 but it ended up tasting very good. If you want to give it an extra rich taste add a hint of netmeg.

The batter was way too thick,wouldn't spread out in the pan, and they came out heavy.Followed recipe to a "T". Maybe less flour and butter next time.

Really good! The vanilla definitely makes it pop, and makes it taste much better than another recipe on this website.  I used 1/3 of the recipe and it was enough for 4 large crepes! My favourite crepe is a savoury one--just mayonnaise, pepper, cooked spinach, ham, and mozzarella.

I made this recipe for the first time this evening. I didn't get any greasy crepes at all like using 5 tbs of butter. I used 3 whole eggs and the only thing that I had to add was just a little bit more milk because it was too thick. I eyeballed it so I couldn't say exactly how much. 1/3 cup more perhaps. It was creamier and was able to roll out on the pan the way it should and any clumps that were in the batter were dissolved completely too. I also used 1/2 cups of the batter at a time to cook in a ceramic skillet, which made a larger crepe. 1/4 cup only made a soft taco size crepe for me. I found that I never had to redo any light oil on the skillet as I used up all the batter in this batch. I may even try going without next time. I stuffed the crepes with fresh mixed fruit that I warmed on the stove with freshly squeezed orange juice until a consistent softness. It turned out great! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Rave reviews from everyone who has tasted these!
I tried it today with whole eggs as someone suggested and they were amazing!
Don't scrimp on the butter!

Oh yum!  These are fantastic and so easy to make.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not need to add extra milk.  The 1 1/2 cups stated was enough.  My batter was thin and so were my crepes.  I did though use 2 whole eggs plus 1 egg white instead of the 3 egg whites.  I used a hand blender to get rid of the lumps and to help thin out the batter. I also made these gluten-free by using Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free all purpose flour.  I stuffed mine with brie cheese, blackberries, blueberries, and honey and then sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  So delicious!

The flavors are great, vinilla is pronounced yet not overpowering, while for me personally it tends to be a little too sweet. (Then again, I usually put half the amount of sugar as most recipes)My only real problem was the consistency, it was more of a pancake than a crepe batter, and before you derail this comment, yes I added exactly the quantities the recipe specified. I would reccomend about an extra 1/8 to 1/4 cup of milk  to get a nice thin crepe. All in all, with a little more milk, GREAT RECIPE! would definetly use again and reccomend.

Great recipe! I made just as written except 1/2 tbl of vanilla less since I was running low. Made a couple of different types: peanut butter and banana, nutella, preserves, and cheddar cheese. My kids (7 and 3) loved every single one.

The vanilla really brings out the flavor in these. On the finished crepes,I spread a little melted butter, sprinkled it with brown sugar and cinnamon, and rolled them up. It was lke cinnamon rolls in crepe form. Next time I think I'll also make some cream cheese icing to drizzle over top!

The recipe was tasty and easy to follow. Really should have watched a video on the best way to cook these, though! Don't really know why you need to spray the pan with as much butter as is in these if you're using a nonstick pan. You can gently lift the edges as they crisp. Personally, I LOVE the spotted dalmatian type as I like crispier crepes. 15 seconds on the second side did NOT seem like enough time. I prefer these not to be soggy, and very thin! Served these with blueberries and strawberries dusted with powdered sugar and ate them by hand. YUM! Will use the leftovers for lunch and put strips of grilled chicken, garden tomatoes, lettuce and some mayo. YUMMERS!

Made according to recipe, egg yolks and lots of vanilla but prob 1/2 c more milk because I did not sift flour. First batch the other wee used blender, second time by hand. Found the blender mix cooked a bit rubberier than the hand mix. Also, I let the hand mix batch rest for about an hour prior to cooking. With my non stick frypam, had no trouble making thin, delicious crepes.

Loved the flavour. I ate mine with fruit, my son with table syrup.

These are so good! I made mine with vanilla flavored almond milk. I topped mine with raspberry jam and a few(about 12 or so) chocolate chips :)

This were really greasy, rubbery and kind of an odd, sickly yellow/brown color. The batter was also WAY too thick for crepe batter. I put a spoonful in the pan and it wouldn't move when I tried to swirl it around. When you make crepes, you're not supposed to spread the batter it should spread easily and leave a thin layer in the pan. Even after I added an extra half cup of milk it was still really thick and greasy. I made 4 "crepes" thinking maybe I had added more oil than I thought to the pan and they were just sucking it up. After the 4th crepe came out as oily as the first, I ditched the rest of the batter and just added vanilla to a recipe I have used before. The taste of these was ok, but the texture was more rubber pancake than delicate crepe.

These were so good! Worth all the time it took to make! I stuffed them witha creme cheese filling I found on allrecipes (strawberry crepes recipe) and topped with fresh strawberries that I cut amd mixed with with sugar! My 6 year old fell in love and I finally had to tell her she couldn't have anymore because I was afraid she would get a tummy ache! LOL

These were really good! I used 4 tbsp butter and a bit more milk, as well as a little bit more sugar. I didnt want to waste the eggs by only using the yolks, so I used 3 whole eggs. I wasnt sure if I was supposed to mix the milk, eggs and vanilla by hand or with a mixer, so I just put it in the blender and then stirred the remaining ingredients in with a whisk. Will be making again, but will continue searching for THE ultimate crepe recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is AMAZING.  I love this recipe and I have been looking for a good crepe recipe for a long time that you don't have to prepare in advance of cooking.  My son tells me I have the best crepes and lives off of them.  I only use 1T of vanilla and 4T of melted butter.  Thanks for sharing.

These came out fantastic! i made them with my mom and husband, and we ended up having loads of fun flipping the crepes in the air. We even called my dad in to join us! They were super simple to make, and were delicious with the bananas foster my mom made to top them. No exaggeration: we manages to finish the entire dish in under five minutes. That good. Rich, but that good.

I don't know....maybe my family members just aren't crepe people.  This was the first time any of us had tried crepes.  We didn't hate these, but we didn't think they were all that great either.

Amaaaaaaaaaazing! Added a half cup more milk and they were perfect! We don't have a crape pan so we just used a regular frying pan. They probably could have been a little bit thinner but I thought it still worked out well. Well enough that I won't be buying a crape pan any time soon, but I'll still be making these crepes! I just had a baby last December and I think that this would make a great family tradition. Another reviewer mentioned their mother making these for them every Sunday and I think that's a great idea!

Using a  blender is a fantastic idea for crepes.

Using this receipe was the first time I made crepes.  Only made two adjustments to the recipe with whole eggs and cut the vanilla in half.  When cooking the crepes I found two skillets made the job easier.  One skillet was cooling down while the other used to cook the crepe. Also needed to wash the skillets and spatula to keep the crepes coming out nicely.   Recipe is easy to make and came out great. Thanks for sharing.

Yum!  Filled with Nutella and topped with whipped cream.  Delicious.  I did need to add a little bit more milk but, other than that they came out perfectly.

Excellent recipe! I used whole eggs and a blender as others had commented. Easy * Fast * Kids love 'em!  I served with choice of fresh pineapple, blueberry, strawberry or mild goat cheese (like a cream cheese). Yummy!

Fun recipe for a Saturday morning and my 4 year old loved helping.  We had fresh strawberries for some and cherry pie filling for others.  We also added whipped cream in each crepe for extra yummy-ness!

Very good recipe.  I could have eaten the crepes plain, because they tasted like sugar cookies.  I did add a little more milk (about 1/4 c.) and reduced the butter by a tablespoon, but it could have even used a little less.

I made these with a vanilla creme banana filling and they were amazing. VERY rich and sweet so my husband said he would prefer as a dessert and a little goes a long way. Successful though and will make again.

Easy and delicious! The only thing that I did differently was use 3 whole eggs instead of just the yolks. It turned out perfectly! Tips: (1) turn down the heat to medium-low after making the first couple because the pan gets hot and starts to cook the crepes too quickly, and (2) sift the flour. Great when filled with strawberries, blue berries.. topped with powdered sugar and a little whip cream!

This was a very delicious and simple recipe. I followed the directions exactly and the result were excellent crepes that my family loved. I filled them with nutella chocolate, banana slices and blueberries. then folded them and topped with sliced fresh strawberries, strawberry glaze and powdered sugar. I also added a little whip cream on top as a garnish....I will make these again.

Very good and super easy, a little berries and cream and you've got a great breakfast.  I was a little nervous to try as Im not very good with pancakes and didn't have a crepe pan... You don't need one just a good nonstick frypan and turns out its much easier to perfect then a pancake!

For one of my daughters Girl Scout badges she had to choose a cuisine and make and prepare 2 menu's each consisting of an appetizer, entree, and a dessert. She chose crepes w/ Nutella and used this recipe for her crepes. It was so easy for her to mix and make on her own (she's 11) and the crepes were so yummy! We did cut the vanilla in half though. The recipe double easily as well. This one is definitely a keeper!

We've made these recipes dozens of time. They've become a Sunday morning staple. We follow the recipe as directed, except I only use 4 T. butter and definitely cut back on the vanilla. We use 2 TEAspooons vanilla, which still give a rich vanilla taste that isn't overwhelming. It also helps to get a good iron crepe pan and not use too much batter; my husband uses a scant 1/4 c. per crepe for a nice thin crepe. We've used all kinds of fillings. Our favorite are fresh berries with some powdered sugar and then some whipping cream on top; we've also made a cream cheese spread (cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a little vanilla) with berries, and recently my husband cooked up apples like for an apple pie filling, and we used those for the filling - yummy. These crepes definitely lend themselves to sweet rather than savory fillings, since they contain the sugar and vanilla. This recipe is a keeper!

These were amazing. My mother makes a Hungarian version of crepes and these taste exactly like them. I didn't change anything in the recipe. Even my husband enjoyed them and he doesn't like to try anything new! I'll be making these many more times, thank you!!

I also reduced the vanilla to one tablespoon (only because i happen to run out) and they turned out absolutely perfect! I filled them with a cream cheese filling made with 1/2 cup of sugar 4 tablespoons of butter and a splash of vanilla. I topped with blueberries and powdered sugar. My family couldn't get enough of it!

WOW!!!! :) These are AMAZING!!!!!!!! My family LOVED them! I rolled mine up and put whipped cream on the top and ate it with frozen strawberries from this summer (if you put them on a tooth pick it's just like a popsicle). I also used homemade vanilla extract instead of store-bought because I think it really tastes richer. I will for sure make these again in the summer when our blackberries, rasberries, blueberries, and strawberries are growing. Thank you soooooooo much for this recipe :)

Followed recipe to a "T" and they came out perfect, not greasy at all.  I filled them with homemade yogurt and berries one day and scrambled eggs and cheese the next.

Very tasty and simple! I was surprised how easy it was to make crepes. I used a non-stick pan and PAM. I did add some extra milk to the mixture (I halved the recipe for 2 people first) It made 6 crepes with the thinner batter. I put orange marmalade in one and sugared mixed berries in the other. I'll put yogurt next time. Such a nice change for breakfast! Maybe I'll try them savory too.

I used a little less than 1/4 c batter for my 7" pan.  We had them with strawberry sauce and nutella and I also made blueberry sauce which was delicious.  I would make these again because the family liked them, but I just didn't like the taste as well as my other recipe.

This was wonderful!  I will try it with only 4 T of butter and see what happens.  I filled them with sliced bananas and a squirt of chocolate syrup, rolled them up, put 2 on each plate and topped with fresh whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup on top.  Everyone loved them!    This is the first time I have made crepes and will be making these often!  Thank you!

My family loved them! I added another 1/2 cup milk per other reviews, and the only other change is that I didn't grease my pan. They were perfect. I thought 2 Tbs vanilla would be a bit too much, but I was wrong, it's just right!

These are fantastic! I leave out the butter, used whole eggs and don't sift my flour. Throw the batter in the blender and you're good to go! Love to fold them up into triangles with nutella inside. They are wonderful!!!

I didn't have a crepe pan just used a regular ol' nonstick pan. Though my crepes didn't look pretty they tasted awesome.  I found the less batter I poured into the pan and spread it the more it looked liked crepes. Yummy yums.

These were easy to make and turned out great! I set up frozen berries, powdered sugar and whipped cream and the family thought it was awesome! I'll definitely make them again.

Easy to make!  This was my first time using Madagascar Bourbon real vanilla extract and idk if it was the vanilla or the amount but I felt it was a little overpowering.  Will use a little less or artificial vanilla extract next time and see if that makes a difference.

these were so easy to make and tasted so yummy! I did use just a little more vanilla cause thats the way I like it. I thought they were really good alone so I just drizzled mine with a little syrup.

I made this recipe last weekend - my first ever attempt at making crepes at home - and it turned out perfect!  I did add about half the vanilla, since I was adding fruit and syrup.  I kept batter and made crepes twice more, it kept very well.  I do need to work on my batter spreading skills, but will definitely make those again :).

The smell is heavenly, like the description suggests. These are perfect with powdered sugar alone, they are that good. No alterations are necessary. Best crepes I've ever had, and I lived in Europe for 3 years!

I just finished eating mine and it was SOOO amazing- I made two with just the vanilla extract but then I deviated- I decided to be bold and throw some dried culinary lavender into it.  I then made a vanilla cream cheese spread (Cream cheese, vanilla syrup and powdered sugar) and added a little sliced red plum into it and I think I have my new favorite breakfast!  If you have some lavender to add, try it if you're the adventurous type- it may be worth your while!    The recipe itself- very delicious.  I have a horrible sweet tooth.

This was the first time I have ever tried making crepes and I was impressed. I will try to make them thinner next time by spreading the batter. We put fresh cut strawberries and warmed cottage cheese in the middle and dusted with some powdered sugar. My grand daughter filled hers with scrambled eggs and cheese.

Very very good! - Did the recipe as written and we thought they turned out great!  I used a large flat pan, kept it on very low heat, and used Pam between each... no problems with the edges wrinkling, the color being spotty or dimpled, or greasiness (as others had mentioned).  I will definitely have to try the different filling suggestions next time I make these.

I love this recipe! I've made it three times already and every time it turns out perfectly. I personally love these crepes with fresh fruit/berries or a whip of cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar. Or combining the berries and the cream cheese is fabulous, too. Couldn't ask for a better recipe!

Very good. The whole family loved them. I used whole eggs instead of yolks, and blended it in a blender like one of the reviews suggested.

Used whole eggs, reduced vanilla to one tablespoon and USED THE BLENDER!!!  So much easier, smoother, pourable.  WARNING:  Even the batter smells intoxicating.  These crepes are FULL of flavor, so if you want to highlight your filling a bit more, reduce the vanilla even more than I did.  :-)  Bon Appetit!

This is my favorite thing to eat for breakfast. One suggestion though. Instead of using bleached flour,use whole wheat flour. It's healthier and it gives it a nice flavor.

I absolutely loved it.  I made them today for my Sis.'s bday.  We both are going to have it again soon. I cut the serving size to 8 and with the calc change i used a splash more milk, a tbsp less butter, 2 whole eggs, and i subbed the real sugar for a tbsp of splenda.  I think the whole thing came out beautifully.  On the inside I used a dollop of vanilla yogurt, strawberries, raspberries, cherries, and mango.  Then a dollop of whip cream on the top with a touch of powdered sugar.  http://i1002.photobucket.com/albums/af147/l_lost_my_marblez/bdaybreakfast.jpg

I make these with a lot of the variations others suggested, and they are the best crepes I've ever made. When I make the recipe as is, it is still good, but the consistency and flavor is awesome with a few changes.

Amazing! You won't need another crepe recipe after you master this one! I  used a little less butter and cooked on low temp. I put strawberries and blackberries on the outside and chilled cream cheese with sugar and cinnamon on the inside! MMMMM MMMM Good! A+

my husband loves to have crepes for saturday breakfast so it was real nice to be able to make them for him. He was very impressed with this recipe, wants it to be the one we use now forever! For me, they didn't taste much different than the crepes he makes, which is just flour, eggs, and milk.  It was a lot of work, but i guess im an amateur cook/baker, so, others will probably laugh  that i call this a lot of work!

The crepes were delicious, however the flour started clumping after I put it in the mixing bowl. I stirred and stirred but couldn't seem to blend it in. However, this recipe was terrific and I will make it again.

I loved this dish! My batter came out a little thick - but it was still quick and easy. I made a fabulous desert of it with warmed caramel for ice cream, some whipped cream, and powdered sugar. YUM!  The next day I threw in some frozen fruit (defrost and drained first) and made pancakes out of it. Also a crowd pleaser! Thanks for sharing!

These were incredible. We ate them way too fast and I am going to have to make another batch tomorrow. The only change I made (accidentally) was dropping three eggs in, instead of 3 yolks. They still turned out fabulous. This is definitely the "go to" recipe for crepes.

I love this easy crepe recipe for special occasion breakfasts (It's become a Christmas tradition!) I usually use a little less flour or more milk to make the batter thinner.

I'm giving this one five stars because the taste is great.  I have never had a problem with greasiness but I did find the batter was way too thick and needed quite a bit of additional milk.  We like our crepes quite thin so the batter has to be only slightly thicker than cream.  This batter seemed more like pancake batter at first but I've made them several times so now I just plan for additional milk and they're perfect.

Great with strawberries or some other filling. :)

These crepes are soooo good! Even if you make them thicker like a pancake they taste great. My husband surprised us with these and wouldn't tell me where he got the recipe. Lucky for me he didn't clear out the web browser and I was able to see the recently viewed recipes. ;D

Great! Super! Delicious! That's what our family said!  I upped the milk to make it more pourable, but that was all the changes I made regarding measurements. I didn't have white flour and so I used wheat, it still turned out delicious and my non-wheat eaters even liked it. I used a filling from what my Romanian mother-in-law uses - sour cream with sugar and a touch of vanilla. Yummy!

Next time I will use a little less vanilla. I used bananas and chocolate chips as a filling. Also used lite cherry pie filling- yummy! Topped with whip cream. Overall, it is a light crepe, which I like, but as always, it's what one puts inside the crepe that really makes it.

Thank you for this recipe, It was great, easy and delicious! My family can't wait so I can do them again!  It is soooo easy to make you can make it any time for desert or brunch, and saves you so much money because they are so expensive in the mall when you buy them there!!

I was brought up eating crepes and this is a great recipe. It makes a nice thin batter that is easy to spread in the pan, and has a light vanilla flavor making them great plain as well as with berries and brown sugar. I will use this recipe again. :) Soon!

I followed the exact recipe.
but just did not like this.
I love crepe, vanilla!!
But this recipe was too buttery, and i made this thin but still tasted  like pancake to me. 
it might work better with cheese and eggs or such but not so much with fruit.

Fantastic! I changed very few things (mostly at the suggestion of other reviewers)... I added about 1/4th cup of milk to the mix, and out of laziness I used the blender to get the mix smooth.  I also used whole eggs rather than yolks.  I stuffed these little guys with the suggested filling of 8 oz whipped cream cheese, 4 tbsp butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tbsp vanilla, and tbsp of dark corn syrup, THEN I drown them in chocolate ganache with a touch of dark rum, and finally garnished with powdered sugar and strawberries.  Beautiful to the eye, and amazing to the tummy.

SO GOOD! This was my frist time making crepes, but it was super easy and they were VERY good! I added a little bit more vanilla to give that extra vanilla taste (they were for breakfast crepes). Definitely will use a sift next time to make the batter not lumpy. I WILL make these again! Thanks so much for the recipe! :]

Yummy!

We used whole wheat flower (King Arthur white whole wheat) and the complete eggs.  Mine came out a little thick and pancakey.  Next time I will turn down the heat a little.

This said, my son actually ate them with bananas in yoghurt with whipped cream and powder sugar.

Added 2 tsp cinnamon.  I use white chocolate chips for filling after spreading in pan - they melt and no other filling is needed.  Awesome recipe.

Absolutely delicious! This is a great recipe if you have kids, also. I put diced strawberries and whipped cream out on the table and let my 5 year old son make his own. He thought it was so much fun (and also thought the crepes were very good).

Great recipe!  After reading the reviews here, I added a little more milk to thin it a bit and mixed it all in my blender.  They smelled divine and tasted even better!  Just a spray of Pam is all you need to grease your pan.

Such a hit!  Even though I wasn't able to sift the flour, the small clumps were not even noticeable once the crepes were cooked.  Try topping them with fresh oranges, bananas and blue berries, its fresh sweet treat.

This is a perfect crepe recipe.  I add a little more milk because the batter tends to be too thick.  I have made these several times and have even served them to guests!  They are always a hit.

They came out perfect on my first try. I make extra batter because it seems the first few are never as even as the rest of them. I like to spread the batter as thinly as possible and cook them just a tad longer because I love the little bit of crunch from the crisping of the edges. I also just used the whole egg rather than the yolk... I think this may help with the batter being too thick in which the other user added milk (I did not). This was my first attempt at crepes with this recipe and I already feel like a pro!

I made these for church on Sunday. I actually made the crepes with my crepe maker on Saturday afternoon and stored each crepe between wax paper and put them in an air-tight plastic container. They stored very well and tasted fine. In the morning I filled them with a vanilla cream mixture (1 box sugar-free vanilla pudding, 1 cup milk, 2 cups whipped topping, and 1/4 vanilla) and dessert strawberries. They were amazing and everyone raved! I didn't have to bring any home; they ate every single one and I even made a double batch!

Very Good.  I added a bit more milk to thin the batter, but that's just personal preference.

I made these for a dinner party I had last weekend- huge hit!  I made the crepe batter before hand and after dinner I made a show of making the crepes.  I then served them with my guests' choice of shaved chocoalte, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, powdered sugar, or cherries- which I served FLAMBE!  SO MUCH FUN!  And everyone commented on the vanilla aroma!  This one is a keeper.

Just a note though- when making crepes you must have the right pan and spatula.  The pan must be very wide and thin and the spatula must be as wide as you can find it.

These were very good however I prefer a sweeter batter so added extra sugar to mine.  Great way to use up extra egg yolks left over from other recipes.

The only reason why I didn't give this five stars is because I had to make a few substitutions- but WOW they came out beautifully and were gone within ten mins! I used 1 3/4 cup of milk and only four tbsp. of melted butter along with 3 whole eggs- not just the yokes. They were delicious and they smelled wonderful! I filled them with a modification of the last reviewers recipe- 6oz of low fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar (or splenda sugar blend) 1 cup mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries- whatever) and 1 tbsp. of maple syrup. Absolutely flavorful, creamy and melts in your mouth! Thanks for the recipe because based on my boyfriend and roomates reviews I will definately make these again!

The vanilla taste was wonderful, but I have to agree it was a tad bit cakey when I followed the recipe as it is, I made another batch with more milk and it turned out wonderful, I added a dash of nutmeg for flavor too!

I'm sorry but these are nothing like the real thing.  These are kind of cakey and way too fragile.  Definitely needs more egg.

Really good except I used the whole eggs (my chickens' eggs are on the small side).  I usually mix up the batter in a large measuring cup so I can pour it as needed.  Didn't have any problems with it spreading or tearing.  Filled with peaches and topped with peach butter.

These were the most wonderful crepes I've ever had!  I disagree with reviewers saying it was too thick or too greasy. It was perfect! Wonderful vanilla flavor!  I experimented and used half milk, and then half half-and-half, and it made it really fattening and a little thicker, but delish!

I also used whole eggs in the recipe, and the crepes turned light and fluffy.  I stuffed them with bananas covered in a peanut butter drizzle and dusted with powder sugar.  Very good.

The crepes I made had perfedt texture. The only reason I took off a star is beacause I think there was a bit to much vanilla in it. THe idea is great though!

I agree with the others, the crepes were a little thick, so I did add a little more milk. But I made them for a bridal shower, the flavor was amazing and EVERYONE loved them!

After reading reviews, I used whole eggs, 1 3/4 cup milk, only 1.5 Tbsp butter and less vanilla.  With these changes it's a 5 star recipe - easy and delicious.  As written, I give this recipe 4 stars because 5 tbsp butter sounds much too greasy.

I took advice from the reviews, and used whole eggs, increased mile to 1 3/4 cup, reduced to 1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract and reduced to 4 tablespoons butter and it came out awesome.   It was my first time making crepes and I was surprised how excellent they were.

I make crepes fairly often at home and I was not a fan of this version. They fell apart in the pan, and had a crispy bite to them, rather than a soft and fluffy texture.

I followed the recipe and while they smelled amazing.. the batter wasn’t nearly as runny as it should have been. After making one crepe that turned out like pita bread, I added about a quarter cup more milk, whisked again, and they turned out amazing. I filled with a small amount of thick homemade blueberry sauce, topped with custard, icing sugar and fresh blueberries. Delicious!

I absolutely loved it. mmh just thinking about the crepes makes me want to get some now. They were thin and sweet. But not too thin or sweet. They were absolutely perfectly DIVINE. I made them for my sister and she absolutely loves them. She is even willing to get of bed early(6:00am) for them which is shocking for she the type to sleep in til 10am or 11am if mom and dad don't make her get up.

Perfect batter. The crepes turned out beautiful and delicious. I substituted the 2 tbsp sugar to 1 cup for preference. I like my actual crepe without toppings.

My family loves these! Due to allergies we make this recipe gluten and dairy free exactly as written just replacing with the gluten-free flour blend and a dairy free butter option and they are amazing!

These were amazing! I will definitely be holding onto this recipe for life. The sifting flour idea is great and to get that sprinkle of confectioners sugar on top, use a sift, as well.

These crepes were fairly greasy and the batter kept separating while I was cooking the crepes. They also cooked strangely, but that could be because I used gluten free flour. They do taste pretty good, though, and this is a simple recipe.

I had to change around some ingredients so that might be why it didnt turn out so good, it didnt  really work for me but I'm sure if I used ingredients I cant  have I'm sure it would be great.

My son absolutely loves these crepes.  He won't even eat crepes at any restaurant, only eats them when I make them.  That is a major compliment coming from him.  These are so good and the vanilla definitely gives them a wonderful flavor.  Thank you for an awesome recipe.

I make these all the time for family and friends! One tip is to sift the flour to rid the little white chunks that may appear in the batter.

These crepes are amazing!!! I've never had a problem making them. Most of the time I'll half the recipe and just use a whole egg. Foolproof—and amazing with strawberries, jam, and whipped cream! :)

my family and I LOVE this recipe, I got first place in a crepe making contest with this recipe, and it's pretty simple to make. the only thing is, when making the batter, but the dry ingredients right in with the wet (don't separate wet and dry and mix together), or else you will have very liquidy batter with the chunks of the dry ingredients

I made these yesterday.  Don't know what I did wrong but they came out terrible.  I followed the directions to a tea.  I cook & bake a lot but these were terrible. 
I was so disappointed.  I must say that this was the first recipe that I made from All Recipe that was a disappointment.  I have written many reviews & were all great recipes.  Need to find a good Crepe recipe.
Thanks Allrecipe.com.

As per RyanMichelle:  use 3 whole eggs. Tips: Sift your flour or use a sieve when the batter is done. This will take out the flour chunks for a smoother consistency. Also measure the flour by using a spoon to pour it into the cup. If you scoop a measuring cup, it packs the flour & you get a "doughy" crepe. Find the right temp! When you first pour the batter, it shouldn't wrinkle too much when spreading, or your pan is too hot. No dalmation spotted crepes! Technique! Pour your batter on a very lightly greased pan (short spray of Pam is fine) You know you're ready to flip it when the edges begin to curl, the middle batter isn't glossy & wet looking, you can shake the pan to move the crepe. Use a large thin spatula, flip, cook another 15 seconds. Pick up the pan & slide the crepe onto a plate. When you're ready to make another crepe, don't set your pan on the burner for more than a few seconds, or it gets too hot. 1/3 c. for a 9" non-stick skillet over medium heat, spraying with PAM after @every 3 made... is perfect. Thanks for your helpful info!

Yes I made changes. 3 whole eggs. Substituted one fourth cup of flour for whole wheat pastry flour. And substituted half the milk for buttermilk. Put everything in the Vitamix and blend it and oohh lala, ready to make crepes.  Ive made this recipe many times as it is by far the best recipe online for crepes!!! We've given up pancakes for this recipe!!!

These are wonderful. Made them for fathers day and the only complaint was I didn't make enough. I thought there was a bit too much butter so next time I will reduce it by half.

I love this recipe! I always wanted to make crepes and cane acceoss this easy recipe. They were a hit, my husband and kids loved them. I changed a couple of things: only added 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and substituted 1/4 of milk with buttermilk, they came out perfect! I highly recommend. I topped them with nutella, bananas and strawberries, yum yum yum!

It was super!  Had egg yolks to use up and these worked out perfectly.  For a slightly thinner batter, lessen the flour.

These were so yummy! Took others suggestion and added a little more milk and cut the butter down to 1 Tablespoon. Also sifted the flour as someone else suggested. When they were done we filled them up with fresh strawberries, bananas, and whipped cream! Perfect breakfast! Will be making these a family tradition!

It was a delicious recipe that my family loved, although I thought the batter was a bit thick, but I assume I mis-measured the flour.

I'm 70 years old and have never made crepes.  I decided I'd better try it while I'm still able. I'm glad I did.  They were delicious with sliced fruit and whipped cream.

I made the recipe just as it is -- after the first few crepes I did add a bit more milk to thin the batter just a little.  For filling ~ mmmm so many choices.  I had apples on hand so I diced 6 apples, put them in a skillet with 3 TBSP butter, cinnamon, sugar and a bit of brown sugar and 1/8 cup water cooked until tender.  In a small bowl, I mixed 8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup pwd sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I also had some chopped pecans that I had toasted with some brown sugar (left over topping from grape salad).  I put a generous smear of cream cheese mixture, a generous scoop of cooked apples and sprinkled with the toasted pecan mixture.  My kids who don't normally like crepes said they were the best crepe shells they ever had and raved about the filling.

This recipe was very good. I used 2 egg whites, and one whole egg, 2 cups of milk, and a teaspoon of cornstarch. The texture and flavor was pleasing. I also used Martha Stewart's chocolate ganache recipe as a drizzle with strawberries and whipped cream. Super good.

After making the first two crepes, I thought the batter was a little too "cakey" so I added one more egg yolk and a little more milk.  This made just the right difference in the consistency of the batter.

Very good, but you must sometimes play alter the consistancy to get desired thickness for your crepes.  I personally use this recipie everytime i make crepes for my family and it tastes really good with apples, pears, and walnuts.

Yummmmmmm! These were so delicious! My husband, 2 boys and I loved these and cannot wait to eat them again. We filled ours with Nutella and sliced bananas while still warm so that the nutella could melt, topped with homemade whipped cream and powered sugar with a side scoop of vanilla ice cream. We were in heaven! I froze the remaining crepes and cannot wait to eat them next Saturday night for dessert! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe :)

These had a wonderful vanilla flavor. They were far too buttery, I will decrease the butter by half next time. Otherwise excellent. We served them with Nutella.

So easy!  So delicious!  I make them in a round frying pan and then lift and tilt the pan to spread out the batter!  So good!  Mix a little mascarpone, sugar and cream today for the filling and add berries!

Really good recipe, except, like most of the previous reviewers, I did have to use more milk. They will come out more pancake-y if you don't! I also substituted with WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR and SILK VANILLA SOYMILK. Which is probably why I needed more milk (2 1/2 cups), since the whole wheat flour makes the batter thicker, and the soymilk is thicker than fat-free, or low-fat milk. It's Heart Health Month, try whole wheat flour! Yes, it tastes slightly different, but with all those delicious toppings, it's hardly noticeable =)

These crepes are absolutely delicious! I make them exactly according to the recipe- no modifications needed. I've made these many times since I came across the recipe just a month ago- my entire family loves them! I've filled them with sauteed diced apples as well as fresh berries and cream; both ways are divine!

Delicious recipe! I followed some other reviewers to spoon the flour into my measuring cup rather than scooping the flour up. (Otherwise they turn out way too thick and might as well be pancakes.) These are going to turn into a regular weekend treat in our house!

This was my first time making crepes and they turned out GREAT!  It took a little practice to get the hang of how much oil to use, how much batter to use, and the best time to flip...but since the recipe makes so many, it's easy to practice.  I used this site's recipe for "Creamy Dip for Fruit" and spread a bit of that and some fresh blueberries inside each crepe...very good!

Very good dessert crepes.  I did add a little more liquid to thin out the batter and filled them with cream cheese whipped with a little powdered sugar and chopped apples cooked in butter and sugar until tender.  Yum!

These are very flavorful crepes.  The recipe made exactly 12 crepes.  I filled them with sweeted cream cheese and topped them with homemade strawberry sauce.  Yummy.

I made them and they turned out heavenly delicious! I used 3tbs of melted butter and still tought they were a little too greasy. Next time I will use less butter until I get to the point I want them to be. I filled them with ham and colby jack shredded cheese. You can add a little pancake light syrup if you desire. They taste good either way, with or without syrup.

Never made crepes before, and was a little nervous, but these were wonderful. I used 2 skillets, a small one for the kids, and a standard size for the adults. That way I always had 2 going at the same time. Filled with sweetened cream cheese and then topped with sauteed apples. Yum!!

These are great! Easy and the smell is wonderful! We used fresh fruit, pie filling, Nutilla spread as fillers and powdered sugar and whiped cream for toppings. Kind of a crepe bar. Very yummy!

Thanks for such a delicious recipe! I have to say that until couple of months ago, I could burn just plain water! So that will tell you the my culinary art was floating in the space but everything changed and now I am making delicious dishes!!!  Of course, I had never made crepes and now I can proudly say that I know how to make them.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful and easy to make recipe!

Not bad! A little thick for my taste--next time I will definitely sift the flour--but a good flavor. Went great with fresh strawberries and home-made whipped cream!

I made this for my family, and most of us loved it. I made it exactly as written and they came out wonderful. Never eaten nor made crepes before. This was great. I am now looking for creative fillings.  Thanks. Keeper.

TOO MUCH VANILLA!  I would only add a tsp next time...not 2 TABLE SPOONS!  that is way too much and they tasted like sugar cookies...kinda made me sick feeling...like I was eating a plate FULL of cookie dough.  The rest of the recipe is super!  The crepes are easy to make, to flip, nice texture, just too much vanilla.

I thought crepes would be much harder than this!  Will definitely make again, but reduce the amount of butter in the batter - they came out slightly greasy.

I tried this recipe today and I have to say my "crepes" were greasy. I use the altered measurements that others have suggested (4 tb of butter melted). Also I have only eaten a crepe but once in Greece and it was delicious! I don't know what I have done wrong. I am a newer cook. I'm sooo confused.

I made a small version of this recipe for myself just to try it out on a Sunday morning.  I wasn't even going to fill them, just taste them. The first one I threw away because (I guess) I added it to the pan before it was hot enough and never did brown. The next one turned out fine.  I noticed some cinnamon sugar and walnuts sitting out on the counter from yesterday's oatmeal, so I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on after I flipped it.  When it was brown on the other side I slid it out of the pan and added some walnuts and rolled it up. Perfect! I tried one with (Harry and David's) raspberry preserves. It was great also. The amount of butter wasn't bed if you have a simple filling, but you could always cut back. The crepes didn't stick though! LOL!

Almost just like my grandmothers recipe- though no wheat germ. I never have it so it was nice to find a recipe that didn't need it. Delicious! Made changes that others recommended. served with blueberry filling.

Excellent! Followed recipe exactly, but put all ingredients into the blender. Easy cleanup! I made a filling with sour cream and powdered sugar with strawberries and bananas. Drizzled with chocolate sauce and dashed powdered sugar on top.  Takes some practice to know when they are done and ready for flipping, I tossed the first one, actually. It got easier though! Will make again for sure!

Great taste! We love crepes and this is the 1st one I have tried from this site, not sure if I will try another cause it was very taste. I love vanilla and this was just what I was looking for, served them with powder sugar and blueberries and the whole family enjoyed them.

My husband had crepes when we were in Cancun that he said were out of this world, so I went on allrecipes to try and find a recipe since I had never made them before.  I found this one; it was easy to make and my husband thought they were as good as the ones in Cancun! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I halved this recipe because I was just making it for myself and it was delish. I first did the milk, vanilla and eggs in the blender then added the rest of the ingredients and it came out perfectly. Once I flipped the crepe over I put Nutella on the one half then folded it in quarters. Excellent. I've made other recipes where the egg was the prominent taste but with this recipe all the flavors blended together nicely.

I love crepes and I love vanilla, so this couldn't be better!  I took the advice of another cook and added little bit more milk to thin out the consistency.  I also sprayed Pam in the pan.  Excellent with freshly baked sliced peaches with cinnamon!

mmmm yummy!  I just made these with my kids and they were a big hit. Fillings were limited as I need to go shopping- but that's what I love about crepes. We melted some chocolate chips- that's what the kids had with a little powdered sugar. I used the cream cheese recipe a pp posted. added a little raspberry jelly and I was in heaven. Thanks for posting it! Mine were a touch thick so I might add a little water next time- my only prospective change. and it was user issues not recipe issues.

Thank you for this awesome recipe!  I made a couple of modifications (omitted the salt and reduced the amount of butter to just 3 tablespoons), but the crepes still came out fantastic!

Excellent!  I decreased the amount of margarine to 4 tablespoons, but I would use even less next time (to be more healthy).

Excellent recipe! I halved it and it came out great! I used butter flavored spray for the pan.  One word of advice- mix everything according to the instructions.  I didn't follow them and had a very lumpy batter initially.

Very good crepe recipe. I was so glad that the crepes didn't stick to the pan. For the filling, I used 4 oz cream cheese, 4 oz sour cream, 2 T sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1/2 can of blueberries (10 oz), and 1 tsp lemon juice (all measurements are estimated). Threw everything in a small food processor, filled crepes, and topped with a sprinkling of powdered sugar.

I made one batch of these crepes and they were delicious!  My husband, who normally isn't a fan raved about how delicious they were.  He enjoyed them so much he asked me to make them again the next day, but I was out of vanilla so i used coconut flavoring and added a little extra sugar.  With those additions, the crepes tasted fabulous plain or filled with fruit.  I will definitely make these again!

I am 12 years old and this recipe was easy to make, easy to eat(and yes, I made all by myself-no help(except the first time i tryed it), and a bit hard to clean up. It was so good! When I was making the recipe and looked at the directions, I thought that the amount of vanilla extract you put in there was too much, but it was the perfect amount(when I tried it of course). I totally recament this recipe for all sweet lovers!!!!

This is a great basic crepe recipe! The only thing I changed was using 3 full eggs instead of only the yolks and they turned out fantastic! I made them as is for breakfast with strawberry sauce and whipped cream. I then used the leftover batter for dinner with deli turkey, pesto and swiss cheese - delicious! If I were making them exclusively for dinner, I'd leave out the vanilla & sugar, but I was just experimenting and it actually tasted ok as is.

This is the first time I have made crepes and this was so good. I did follow some of the other reviewers and made the following changes: 2 cups of milk, 3 whole eggs, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 4 tablespoons of butter. Use 1/3 cup of batter for a 9" skillet. Mix all dry ingredients together and then sift before adding to the wet mixture to prevent lumpiness. Whisk the eggs before adding to the milk. Put the wet mixture in a blender and give it a brief blend and then add the dry mixture and blend all ingredients together. WOW. So good.

The texture and flavor of the crepes were great! I made a berry and cottage cheese filling and added a tsp. of vanilla, two tblsp. of brown sugar and about a tsp. of cinnamon. I have experimented with other fillings cinnamon apple, chocolate and peanut butter but the berry and cottage cheese is the most satisfying. I also mixed the wet ingredients into the dry to help the batter form better. I also used a third a cup of mix instead of the 1/4 cup and it yieldes 9-12 crepes. This recipe has become a regular in our household.

This is my favorite crepe recipe.  It's fast, easy and even husband can make them.  If we have extra we use them for manicotti shells as well we'll put ice cream in the middle and freeze them so we can pour fruit & sauce over top, for a wonderful dessert...Dar, Vic BC

i think i did something wrong.  I had to use soy milk, my BF is lactose intolerant, but they came out rubbery.  i made an apple filling like another reviewer suggested and it was really good.  if anyone has any suggestions on how to fix the rubbery texture please let me know, i will def try again.

Turned out PERFECT! I tried to make crepes before and they did not turn out at all, bu this recipe was awesome! I followed it exactly except for one thing: I used a whole egg (not separated). Then I filled the crepes with a cream cheese mix: 1 pkg cream cheese, about 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1-2 tablespoons orange juice and then 1/2 cup cottage cheese. Then I topped them with a triple berry mix. SO YUMMY =] way better than any restaurant version!

AMAZING!  I would use less butter next time.  Maybe 2 tbls next time.  And if it needs to be thinner then i would just add more milk.  I will be making these again!

I was looking for a quick crepe recipe and this one is great.  The other recipes I've used the batter has to be made a day ahead of time.  I did reduce the vanilla and I love crepes with fruit filling so I made it with some fresh blueberries I had on hand.  I put the blueberries in a saucepan and heated them with 1/4 cup of fruit juice, a tbs of lemon juice, tsp of sugar, and thickened it with a 1/2 tsp of cornstarch.  Filled the crepes with the warm fruit filling and sprinkled them with confectioners sugar.  Fantastic breakfast!

I just made them. . .like just now and I thought they were definitely rocking. However. . . I think I messed up somewhere because it didn't have that extra something, but they were still pretty good. I can wait to make these for my creampuff party.

perfectly lacy and wonderful crepes!  i used whole eggs (by accident - i didn't read the recipe very carefully!), a little less flour, and a little less vanilla.  i made them in my cast iron skillet.  filled with bananas and topped with powdered sugar.  i will definitely be making these again & often.

These crepes were excellent! I followed the tip of a reviewer on putting all the ingredients in a blender, worked great. They have the right amount sweetness and you can eat them all by themselves. I had then with Cajeta, it's like a Mexican caramel sauce and it was the best. Next time I'm having them with Nutella. Thanks for the recipe!

It was a little too thick for my husband and I, more like pancake mix, so we added another 1/2 cup of milk to thin it out.  Then it was very good with a mixed berry filling, whipped cream, and syrup for breakfast.

awesome!  I wouldn't change anything about the recipe.  I did however fill the crepes.  I put some frozen strawberries and sugar in the microwave and made my own whipped cream mixed combined with sugar and some cream cheese.  I suppose you could use whipped cream you got from the store, but making it is so easy and tastes so much better.  Just beat heavy cream and sugar until stiff (or consistency you want)and add room temperature cream cheese.  YUM!  Great recipe with or without filling.  Jen

Good, the batter was a little thick.  I added a little milk because it seemed too thick.  The batter never really came together like I think batter should, but they still tasted really good!  I'm no expert crepe maker, I've only made them twice, but they were really easy and tasted oh so good.  I had a little difficulty getting all the lumps out, but it didn't seem to effect the taste of the crepe at all.

What a fantastic recipe!  The flavor is perfect.  I did agree with some of the other reviewers and found it a bit thicker than I like.  I did make a couple minor changes to the recipe that I think make them perfect for us.

I upped the milk to 2 cups, I lowered the eggs to 2 egg yolks, added 1 3/4 cup flour. We also used 1/4 cup sugar. I can't remember if that's different or not.

What a wonderful flavor!

Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. I made mine a little too thick so they took longer to cook and were a little doughy, but I'll know better for next time. I topped mine with Nuttella just before I took them off of the heat. They were awesome and a big hit with the kids and my wife.

2nd time making crepes. These were great.
Followed advice for additional milk, less butter + vanilla.
Seemed too greasy when pan was sprayed, came out great without the spray.

These were good, but I thought that the texture was a bit rubbery.  My recommendation is to make them as absolutely thin as possible, if that means making the batter a bit more liquidy.

I never made crepes before but this recipe gets 5 stars because it was so easy & so yummy.  And of course there is the added benefit of having your house smell wonderful with the vanilla.  I made a cherry filling & spread some nutella.  My son made a crepe with both & loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!!!
My family LOVED these crepes.  My only variance was that I used the whole eggs and I added about another half cup of milk.  I found the batter to be the perfect consistency for light crepes.

These remind me of the crepes we had in France. I used whole wheat flour in place of regular flour and added 1/4 c of water to make a thinner batter (to account for the wheat flour). Also used 2 whole eggs instead of 3 yolks. Excellent results.

Wow! These were fantastic! My husband said they were his new favorite breakfast, and anything that gets him to eat breakfast is good in my book. I used the cream cheese filling that another reviewer used, and added some mixed berries. Simply fantastic!

I've made crepes in the past and I'm used to using a much lighter batter.  This one was very hard to pour to make very thin crepes so I nearly doubles the quantity of milk to get the right consistency.  Overall, taste wise they were amazing especially with Nutella and bananas or strawberries.

Excellent crepes! My husband and I got addicted to the ones at IHOP and decided to try making them on our own. These were just as good, although we ran out of vanilla and had to miss out on that extra little 'kick' that this recipe was touting. Fortunately, they were still very good sans vanilla, and my husband had blackberry butter on them while I had Nutella. My only caveat: do like the other review suggested and make sure to sift your flour into the batter. It makes for smooth smooth crepes!

I split the recipe in half.  I used 1 egg yolk and a little extra milk.  I added salt to taste only.  Next time i will try two egg yolks and the regular amount of milk.  Next time i will use cooking spray instead of vegtable oil.  I LOVED this recipe!!

Very good. A keeper. Easy to make.I used my cast iron griddle to make the crepes and they turn out very nice. I placed wax paper between each one until I was done with them all. Then I put the baked bananas in them. both worked together well.

Really really good! I did one whole egg and 2 egg yolks.  I spooned the flour in to keep it fluffier and I mixed it all together in a blender.  Turned out great.  My whole family raved.  It made a lot of crepes, but we ate them all!  We will definitely make these again.

Simple and delicious.  I, too, used whole eggs and it turned out great.  We stuffed them with a reduction of blueberries mixed with cream cheese and they were terrific!  Next time I'm going to try a savory dish using this recipe.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it turned out EXCELLENT.
I added a few more tablespoons of milk to make the batter a little more thin but everyone loved it and asked for seconds.

Very quick and easy.

Great receipe. The only change I made was one mentioned by another user, I added more water the second time I made them. They were a little too thick the first time. But still had a great flavor. Stuffed with fresh strawberries, bananas, drizzled with chocolete and powdered sugar.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe! My 10 year old made them for us for breakfast all by herself and they tasted wonderful...only change was she added the whole egg, not just the yolk.  We had with blueberry jam..yummy!

These are awesome! My husband loves an IHOP item called swedish lingonberry crepes, so the first time I made them, I mixed butter and blueberry preserves and spread the mixture over them, and rolled them up, they were a hit. I finally found lingonberry preserves so I'm pretty sure they will taste just like the originals.

I have used this recipe a couple of times. The second time I mixed in 1/2 cup of wheat flour and only used 1 cup of the all purpose white flour. My 11 year old liked it, but liked the first batch better.

This was my first time eating and making crepes. So I guess my review comes from somewhat a picky eater perspective- I personally thought that the crepes were kind of flavorless. I made a strawberry compote and topped with whipped cream. I didn't much care for them but my family raved over them- My mom said they reminded her of the ones her mother used to make so I guess that's good because my grandma was a gourmet chef! overall they were quite good- I just personally don't prefer crepes after growing up with my grandpa's German french toast (very flavorful) I grew up with very strong tasting foods so this was just a bit bland but everyone else liked it so it was pretty good.

I tried these last night and they were a big hit with my family!  On a side note, a regular frying pan doesn't work as well as a griddle. (The sides of the frying pan make it hard to turn over the crepes.)
