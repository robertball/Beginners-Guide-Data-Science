The salad was great, love strawberries and avocados.  The dressing, however, was gross.  Way to sweet, and not a good sweet.  Had a funny taste to it.  I will keep the salad nad use my own dressing.

Took this salad to our monthly Empty Nesters Dinner Group. It received rave reviews. Definitely a keeper!

Used a bottled poppyseed dressing as a timesaver as well as bagged romaine lettuce. Good but this didn't blow me away. Kind of average. I would definiately toast the pecans.

This was very tastey all the flavors went well together although the next time I make it I will use less sugar in the dressing maybe about half.

I thought the dressing was much too sweet and ended up tweaking it a bit to tone it down (added a bit of salt and some all-purpose seasoning mix). I didn't have any avocados handy, so I ended up using green peppers. Can't tell you what it was like with avocado...but with the peppers...it was marvelous. Good salad, just needed a few modifications.
