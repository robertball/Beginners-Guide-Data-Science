This recipe does actually produce "Perfect Hard Boiled Eggs"!  My husband loves hard boiled eggs and quite frankly so do I and nothing is more frustrating than something so simple turning out improper or down right ugly when doing deviled eggs or wanting something pretty to garnish a nice salad. I let the eggs come to room temp. to reduce cracking. When adding the eggs to the water I use a slotted spoon and gently place them into the pot this also helps to remove them. These were very easy to peel and the yolk has a nice rich yellow color. Thanks Ken!

Salt just increases the boiling point of the water, it doesn't actually do anything to make the eggs easier to peel. Vinegar is not necessary, the real trick here is submerging the eggs in the ice water after removing them from the boiling water. I do the exact same thing with just plain water, and they are perfect! Save your vinegar, the ice is the magic ingredient here ;)

Brilliant, Ken!  I've always used salt (supposed to prevent the contents leaking out) but the vinegar is news, and it works!  14 minutes is a bit long, I think; 10 minutes total boiling time will produce a less rubbery white and a creamy yolk, if you plunge the eggs into cold water immediately.  Also crack the shells immediately after putting the eggs in cold water.  This will allow the gas to escape which turns the yolk blue.

Thanks for all of those that have posted comments to my receipe. I heard alot of discussion about eggs cracking when you put them into the boiling water. So, I did what every husband would do..ask the wife! Her trick as indicated in some of the reviews, is to allow them to become room tempeture before going into the water. Seems to work perfect everytime. Once again, thanks to all that have posted and have a Happy Easter.

You do not need vinegar or salt. The secret to making hard boiled eggs that do not stick to the shell is to use older eggs! Ideally, eggs that are 10 days to 2 weeks old work best. For Easter, I always buy eggs ahead of time. I put the eggs in a pan, cover with COLD water 1" over the eggs; bring to a boil over medium/medium high heat. Once the water comes to a boil, cook for 1-2 minutes, then turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Let sit for 10-15 minutes depending on egg size. Drain water and cool immediately with cold water (I drop the eggs in bowl of ice water). Let them sit for a couple minutes and remove.

Wow!  I've been cooking for over 50 years and finally today I made perfect boiled eggs for deviling.  Have tried everything anybody told me from poking holes in the ends with a needle/fingers to vinegar in the water to standing on my head.  This recipe really works.  My eggs were extra large so I boiled them the full 15 minutes but a couple extra minutes would have been better.  I would have had soft-boiled if I had taken the advise of one reviewer and only boiled for 10 minutes.  Like most of the other reviewers I recommend following the recipe exactly. Thanks Ken...wish I had discovered this recipe years ago.  Who knew you would need a recipe for boiled eggs...ha ha!!!

PERFECT EGGS! I always have problems peeling eggs, especially fresh ones. I will always use this method to boil my eggs from now on, the shell practically slipped off of the eggs! Just in time for Easter too, I'm so happy, thank you for sharing this Ken! :)

For those who had their eggs crack after carefully lowering them into the boiling water?  It's because the ice cold eggs are hitting boiling water.  Allow the eggs to get to room temp and this recipe works perfectly.  And use cool water to cool them down, not ice water...again, it's the super hot hitting the super cold that will cause the shell to crack.   Also, if you're making Deviled eggs and want the yolk perfectly centered in the middle of the egg, GENTLY stir the eggs for about 2 or 3 minutes after placing them in the boiling water.

Although I consider myself an above-average cook, hard boiled eggs had never turned out correctly.  Until now!  Thanks to Ken's recipe I finally had a hard boiled egg turn out perfect!  They peeled cleanly and easily and the yolk was cooked through without turning green around the edges.   Follow recipe exactly...it won't disappoint!

Super simple & PERFECT!  I did use red wine vinegar because I was out of the white... couldn't taste it & it gave the egg shells a light pink tint so I could store them with the unboiled & know the difference!

I've boiled eggs this way for many, many years with one exception...which will guarantee no "grey" ring that you get from the sulfur...I put the eggs in the salted/vinegar water before bringing to a boil - uncovered. Once It's boiling, cover pot w/ lid and turn off heat. Leave on burner for 15-20 min. depending on how many eggs. Drain water and soak in ice cold water for 10 min.

No matter how carefully the cool egg was lowered into the boiling water, it cracked! Not a good choice of steps at all.  Use the good old fashioned way of cold water on top of eggs, brought to a boil, turned off and left for 15 minutes, then chilled with cold water. Much better, uncracked eggs!

I cannot begin to express my frustration with hardboiled eggs, but this recipe has changed my life, I kid you not!  I can't even tell you the last time I was able to peel an egg (and an older egg, at that... I have always known fresh eggs are likely to be difficult,) without any of the flesh peeling off with the shell, but today, I have success!!!!  Yippee!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  **FYI, I did double the amount of water, vinegar and salt.... boiled a dozen at once.

The vinegar will stop the egg white from running if cracked while in the water, Ive used this method for a long time, I do 10 min and then 30 min. off the heat and then into the ice water, I also turn my eggs in the carton at least 6hrs before boiling, I found that it will center the yolk in the egg for a better deviled egg presentation.

THESE THINGS ARE THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i don't have a lot of patience and get real agitated when eggs don't peel right (can't remember how many i have thrown in the trash!)  i cooked 24 eggs (used 3 different pots -- was afraid to alter the recipe) and they all turned out perfect except for one (it cracked a little bit when i added it to the boiling water -- and it wasn't bad -- that is the one i used in the photo i posted)  will definitely use this recipe from now on for boiled eggs!!!!!!

Got 23 out of 24 perfect eggs!  They are pickling away for Easter.  Having read the reviews of problem with cold eggs cracking once they hit the boiling water...I put my eggs in a bowl and ran hot tap water over them.  I let them sit while I waited for the water to boil.  Used a plastic slotted spoon to transfer, and not a single egg cracked.  The one egg I had a tiny chunk out of as I peeled.  Certainly much better odds than I normally get!  (And I ate the evidence, so no one will ever know)

This worked great - I wish I would have read the other reviews before making them. I would have taken the eggs out of the fridge a while before doing this so they wouldn't have been so cold. I had a couple of eggs crack, and from reading the other reviews, that can be avoided by letting them get to room temp before boiling.

Eggs came out great, but I didn't give it 5 stars because recipe didn't say anything about adding cold eggs to boiling water. When I added eggs straight out of the fridge, they cracked, but when I let them sit out for a few hours before boiling them, they came out perfect. Maybe this is common sense, but would have been nice to know from reading the recipe.  Recipe worked great with room temperature eggs!

it worked ok... a slight hint of green around yolk.  I'll stick to the boil water/simmer eggs method.  Putting the eggs in cold water is what makes the peeling easier.  That works like a charm

Okay. I thought I'd never rate/review something as "simple" as hard boiled eggs... but WOW! These are quite literally "perfect". Perfect texture, SUPER easy to peel, not a HINT of gray on the yolk. I stand amazed. :) Thank you, Ken.

Wow!  What can I say?  I'm impressed!  I'm always wary about hard boiling eggs because I'm afraid they'll be undercooked.  Not these!  It's so nice to finally have an actual cooking time (rather than the wishy-washy 10 to 13 minutes, or until your preferred 'done-ness' - I mean, really?), along with a great "recipe" for cooking them.  These turned out beautiful and firm, and peeled very nicely.  Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe. I made my eggs exactly as the recipe stated, adding one tip that I remembered from another recipe: bring the eggs to room temperature first to prevent cracking and while they are warming up to room temperature lay them on their sides for nicely centered yolks.

Most peeled badly so the deviled eggs came out looking unattractive too. I made 2 seperate batches and followed the directions exactly. Even though I had put the eggs out of the fridge to warm up to room temp for 20 mins and lowered them in with a slotted spoon, 3 of the eggs burst open upon contact with the hot water. Most of them were not even easy to peel. There were 2 or 3 that peeled beautifully, and even though most were either broken or peeled with most of the white attached to the shell, the yolks were creamy and perfectly cooked, not grey on the outside, so that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. I'll be heating the eggs up WITH the water from now on, as I usually do. This was not an effective method for me.

Difficult to review this recipe. Frankly I don't believe the vinegar or salt have anything to do with how well the shells peel. My mother always told me the vinegar was to reduce cracking of the age shells. I think age of eggs and brand of eggs  have more to do with easy peeling than anything else. I have recently been having great luck with the shells peeling easily since I switched to Trader Joe's Cage Free Eggs. I had still not perfected having a pure yellow yolk however. I do like this recipe because you don't place the eggs in the water until the water is boiling. This gives you better control of exactly how long to cook your eggs. I left the eggs out for about an hour and half to come to room temperature. Out of 18 eggs, only one cracked. I thought that was pretty good. I will say I  had to cook these 17 minutes. I checked one egg at the 14 minute mark and the yolk was still soft in the middle. I think this recipe has potential, but you will have to play with it to get the right timing.

One more tip for cooking perfect eggs -- once the water boils, turn off the heat, remove pot from burner and cover it.  Set a timer for 12 minutes.  Then, follow instructions as written in the recipe and immediately chill the eggs in ice water to stop the cooking process. Otherwise the centers will stay hot and continue to cook the egg from the inside out. Also, place enough eggs in the pot to avoid a lot of excess bouncing around.  That, plus removing the eggs from the heat once the water boils, prevents cracking. You will love the texture and flavor of the eggs.

Be sure to use the right size pan. Mine was a little too large and the eggs weren't perfectly round because the water did not completely cover the eggs. Otherwise, yes, these were perfect!

Perfect eggs? I don't think so. Adding cold eggs to boiling water makes them crack and leak into the water!!! I had egg drop soup when I was done following this recipe.  I even left the eggs out to get room temperature and lowered them into the water with a spoon and what happened? Almost every egg cracked!  You have to add eggs to cold water and then heat the water and eggs.

Out of curiosity, I compared this method to how I normally boil eggs in plain water. The eggs peeled fine for both batches.  For Ken's method, I allowed the eggs to set out on the counter for almost 2 hours before easing them into the boiling water so they would be at room temperature and not crack.  I have tried this method three times now and each time, at least one egg cracked and oozed some of the egg white when I put it into the water.  I'm thinking it would be better to put the eggs in first and let the temperature slowly come to a boil.  However, Ken's way does produce pretty and bright yellow yolks.  Thanks Ken.

Yeah, I dunno, kind of weird.  They didn't turn out any better than my usual boiled eggs.  I always start everything out cold.  Cold water, cold eggs, cold burner.  I bring to a boil and then take off heat and cover for 20 mins and voila!

Every egg I put in the boiling water cracked and oozed egg white.  I stopped at three and went with the tradition way of boiling eggs.  I only gave it one star because I had to choose one.  I would give it zero stars.

PERFECT is right.  I've always used the vinegar when boiling, but never the salt - until today.  What a huge difference when peeling the eggs.  I've never seen such PERFECT boiled eggs.  I remember grandma boiling more eggs than she needed for deviled eggs because of all the "bad" ones that were a mess after peeling.  With this method that won't be an issue.  Thanks Ken!!

Lots of cracking - when 3 out of 12 are cracked, that's too many!! I will also be sticking to the usual boiling method - bring the water up to a boil when the eggs are already in it!

Been doin this for years.  Works great.  Vinegar also helps "protect" the egg if it does crack during the boiling process.  It helps prevent the white from coming out of the boiling egg.

Not as perfect as I hoped. I had several eggs break right away, and those that didn't, did not peel any easier than other ways I've tried.

I don't know why, but this really does work. I followed the directions exactly. I got eggs from a local farm yesterday & they really did peel perfectly, except for 1 egg that the yolk was on the side of the egg. While the older store bought eggs peeled better, I was pleasantly surprised to see day old eggs peel this nice!  Thanks!!!!

Love this method!  Perfect eggs every time.  But, before boiling, I perform an extra step:  I prick the large end of each egg with a push pin.  At the large end of each egg is a small air space. When you hard cook an egg, this air heats up, expands, and escapes through pores in the shell, but not before the egg white sets. This leaves the egg with a flattened end. Pricking the egg provides a quick escape route for the air, which gives you an egg with a smoothly rounded end. If you prick an egg, watch for a jet of air shooting from the hole as the egg cooks.  This, I feel, also makes peeling them easier.  Just something I learned from Julia Child many years ago.

A.MAZ.ING!  I've tried other recipes that claim to make "perfect hard-boiled eggs", but have never gotten perfect eggs.  This is the real deal, folks.  Not only were the eggs perfectly cooked, with a beautifully yellow and creamy yolk, but it peeled incredibly easily as well.  I literally bought my eggs from a Farmers' Market TODAY and boiled them TODAY -- still peels easily!!  Thank you so much, Ken!  This is the only method I'll use!

Followed directions to the letter - including salt, vinegar, water, eggs, etc.  With water boiling at high heat, I added eggs "one at a time" so they wouldn't crack, and reduced heat to gentle boil for 14 minutes.  I removed and placed in ice water for 15 minutes.  I chilled overnight and peeled the next day.  What I had was UNDERCOOKED eggs with mushy whites.  VERY disappointed.  Won't use this recipe again!!!

The best way to get perfect hardboiled eggs!  We have our own chickens and I have been told that the fresher the egg the more the shell sticks.  Well we had an awful time doing hard boiled eggs, we could not get the eggshells off with out the eggs looking mangled...until now!  
I have tried countless different ways.  I am sold on Ken's!  Thank you Ken!

I tried your recipe Ken and the eggs came out PERFECT. They peeled very easy and I was surprised how perfect the egg came out considering this is the first time I hard boiled an egg. Next I will attempt to make deviled eggs. Maybe I'll hit 2 for 2.

With this method, my hard-boiled eggs turned out perfect and were very easy to peel, even though they were very fresh!  They were cooked to perfection with no gray/greenish ring or rubber texture...thanks for the research, Ken!

I had no problem pealing these eggs at all! I've tried many methods with varying sucess, but this worked great. However, I, like many others added the eggs to the cold water and started to time when boiling. Thank you!

I don't know what it is about this way of boiling eggs; whether it's the vinegar or the amount of time, who knows?! I DO know that it does make a difference and these eggs turn out perfect, and I mean p-e-r-f-e-c-t. This is the only way I will be making these from now on.

I found the eggs very difficult to peel and the yolk was not cooked "well" enough for me.  The middle of the yolk was a "under cooked" orange color.

Perfect is an understatment ~ the whites are tender, the yolk  is a creamy butter consistency with no greenish discoloration it's the outside. Peeling is a breeze; This has been my biggest challenge since moving to Colorado where due to elevation (7800 ft) water boils at a lower temperature. I could get the yolks the right color, but the shells REFUSED to peel and often I lose most of the white in the process. I am convince the white vinegar is the magic ingredient (without any alteration of taste and ice bath to finish. Note, my only change due to lower boiling temp was to add 3 minutes to the cooking process. My gratitude to Ken for his late night research and phenomenal recipe. Easter will be a joy!

The correct time for hard boiled egg is 8 minutes 
starting with cold water place eggs pot in on a high heat and remove them 8 minutes later and run under really cold water to stop the cooking process... The reason for your eggs bot peeling correctly is because the eggs have been over cooked...

I was skeptical on this method but it works great with fresh eggs.   Takes forever to get the water to boil on my stove.

OK, I cheated and I put 9 eggs in the water cuz that was what I had left in my carton. Things were going along smoothly, until I peeled just one egg that was a mess. I should never have cheated!!!! The other 8....perfect. Man, that is the last time I tweak this recipe!!! Thanks Ken!

I have had such a hard time making hard boiled eggs that I can peel easlily every time. Tried everything including using older eggs. This is the one recipe that works every time for me. I love this. Thanks so much!

I have farm fresh eggs that are notoriously tough to peel when hard boiled.  Have tried ice baths immediately after boiling and soaked until cold, but still no joy with peeling. Store bought eggs were the only remedy to this dilemma because they are less fresh and somehow makes a difference separating membrane from eggs.  Until this recipe!  Boiled my day old farm fresh eggs using vinegar in the water and presto - they peel like a banana!  No more store boughts.  Yippi!  I suggest using a slotted spoon to lower eggs into boiling water to prevent cracking.

Perfect.  I used fresh. large. room temperature eggs, apple cider vinegar (turned the eggs a little tan) and iodized sea salt.  I used a pasta spoon with slots because I'm a klutz.  No cracked eggs when added to boiling water.  Used a low boil - on my electric stove between med-lo and medium for 14 min.  Yolks were perfect yellow - just cooked.  Any larger egg would have been under done.  Whites were tender.  The best part - when I cracked it all over and ran it under water the peel just slipped off.  I almost cried.  I really didn't expect this to work.  Happy Easter!!!!  We're grateful for your insomnia, Ken.

Truly, I cannot thank you enough for finally giving me a NO-fail way to make the PERFECT hard boiled eggs! I was reduced to purchasing boiled eggs I was that bad at it before I came across this version. I thought I had tried every trick out there but with these slight modifications I can finally, and proudly, make some eggs :-) 

I did follow this recipe to the "t" even though some reviews said you can do it without the vinegar and/or salt...so long as you plunge them in the ice bath - perhaps I'll try that out later but for now just too happy with my results to worry about straying from the recipe.

Works for me 9 times out of ten!  No matter what I tried before (ice bath post cooking, cracking shells pre and post cooking, different cook times) getting peel-able hard boiled eggs was always hit or miss for me.  Using this method I've had perfect results almost every time.  Only once did I get one egg that would not peel, who knows why...

Ken--you are the Egg Meister.  For the first time ever (And I Mean Ever) I got perfect hard boiled eggs even though I messed up on the preparation.  I didn't get them to boil, and then I turned up the heat too high and boiled them too hard, but they still came out easy-to-peel and perfectly cooked.  A few of them absorbed a lot of water, and even those were perfect.  Was it the vinegar or the cooking time?  Was it that the eggs were quite elderly?  I have no idea, but this willl be my go-to egg recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!!

this was my first attempt at hard boiled eggs and they did indeed turn out "perfect"! i didn't have distilled white vinegar, so i just used what i had on hand and they turned out perfect. recipe aside, ken was right about being careful adding the eggs to the boiled water - the slightest bump/touch against the bottom of the pot and they pop. i used a measuring cup to gently roll/place them into the water. thanks!

I've never had success in getting the shell neatly off eggs so decided to try this method. I followed the directions exactly and they were indeed easy to peel. Yay! The four stars is because the yolks had the grey ring around them. A perfect egg wouldn't :D

I did not have the success this recipe claims.  I have tried several times, and with more and less vinegar.  For me the difference is always the age of the eggs.  The older the eggs the easier they are to peel after boiling.

PERFECT!  I needed to make deviled eggs for Mother's Day and forgot to buy them ahead of time.  This recipe saved the day!  I have never been able to peel fresh bought eggs.  I followed this recipe to a "T", even measuring the water.  It worked perfectly.  Thank you Ken for sharing this PERFECT recipe.  I raved about this recipe to my daughter.  We used it while making our Mother in Law eggs for a party.  The eggs wouldn't peel.  Perhaps she didn't measure as carefully as I did...the solution is we put them in the freezer for 5 minutes and they peeled like a charm!  If an egg gives you a problem try the freezer for 5 minutes.

Followed the instructions exactly and got purrrrfect hard boiled eggs!  Lovely, creamy-textured yolks with no ring of green, tender whites, and they peel like a charm (the shells come off all in one piece after cracking the entire surface).  Of course, I used the eggs that I let sit in the fridge for a week to increase the air space around the egg and make peeling easier.

I made these eggs exactly as directed. They are amazing...the egg is cooked to perfection and the shell falls off the egg when cracked-how much more easy can it be!? Thanks Ken for a terrific recipe!

Why argue with success? I'd read that old eggs peel better and plunging them in cold water helps, but this addition of salt & vinegar did make them peel perfectly! Ken, you've helped make Easter easier. Now onto the deviled eggs...

Don't know why, but this method didn't work for me at all. Almost all of the eggs cracked in the pot! Major bummer. I usually do the way where you add the eggs first with cold water and then heat, and I'm going to stick to that. I usually only have maybe 1 crack not a million! :(

PERFECT Farm Fresh Boiled Eggs!  I have tried every trick in the book i.e., add salt, use baking soda, boil the water then add the eggs, add the eggs then boil the water,  use only "old" eggs, peel them  warm, peel them cold, peel them under warm water, peel them under cold water, peel them under running water - you get the point.  Using Ken's method worked like magic!!! On farm fresh eggs!!!  They peeled beautifully with no extra help.  The only thing I did different was add 3/4 cups vinegar to 10 cups water (because I did a dozen eggs) omitted the salt and I peeled them as soon as they were cooled.  Thank you Ken!

This is great. Just don't use all natural eggs. Every one of mine popped as soon as it hit the water. I have used regular eggs with great success though.

I made a batch of eggs using this method, the eggs were as fresh as you can get them, one day out of the chicken, and they turned out great. The shell came off without much trouble, no white stuck to the shell, and the yolk was perfect. This is now the preferred way to cook hard boiled eggs in my house.

Don't see the reason for vinegar or salt. I put my eggs in water, bring to a boil, turn the heat off as soon as it comes to a boil, wait 12 min, and then put them in ice water. Just don't crowd the pot. and they won't crack.

Great advice and recipe.  I have cooked easy to peel, perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs for years without the advice in this recipe.  My problem is that we have retired and are living in our RV and cooking with Propane.   Over the past 3 years, cooking with propane, I have tried every technique and until today I have not been able to cook a hard boiled egg that wasn't difficult to peel.  I tried this recipe today and was elated!  Finally, I can return to the days of easy t peel, perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs!  Thank you!

I made them and asked my husband to peel when I wasn't home.  He said remember what brand of eggs you bought they peeled soooo easy.  I laughed and said it was the recipe not the eggs.

I don't often hard boil eggs, so I don't have a *system* down (I end up calling my mom and having her walk me through it).  I read this recipes rave reviews and figured it was worth a shot.  I made 6 eggs, 2 of which cracked because I wasn't gentle enough (note to self:  slotted spoon).  I had no problem removing the shells and ended up w/gorgeous pickled eggs as my end result.  Thanks for the recipe, Ken!

This is an egg-cellent recipe! Since I was a kid my mom has always struggled with getting her hard-boiled eggs to turn out as anything but crappy. I can remember many hours accrued as a kid picking itty bitty pieces of shells off and ending up with a eggs that looked like they'd fought with the blender. I used this recipe for deviled eggs and was so stoked to have my mom use it! We recently had a get together and she asked me to hardboil the eggs for her egg salad. I told her i had a secret recipe and when it was time to peel them I got her on video. She was so blown away she was shouting at me how in the world did I do it. She couldnt believe it!! It took 55 years but now she can finally make super quick and easy hard-boiled eggs that you can peel so easily you can actually crack the egg once and pull it apart leaving the shell in one piece, no little bits of eggshell littering your countertop. I also think the vinegar kills the boiled egg smell that tends to linger in the kitchen all day (the worst! especially on hot summer picnic days!) Fantastic recipe Ken, 5 stars! Thank You!!

This method worked perfectly for me!  I have heard that less fresh eggs are the way to go when making hard boiled that are easy to peel, but I only had fresh eggs and I still had no trouble peeling my hard boiled eggs!    The other reviewers tip of letting the eggs warm up a bit to room temperature before dropping them into boiling water is a great tip.

Wow! It really worked. I had fresh eggs and wanted to make pickled eggs, and I have always had problems with the shells sticking to the shells and tearing. No one wants to eat unsightly "pitted" pickled eggs. All my eggs peeled perfectly. Thank you so much for this foolproof method.

Oh no, for some reason this did not work for me!  I have gone back to tapping the large end, rolling in my palm to crack it, then peel the shell gently under warm running water.

I rarely have a decent looking peeled egg, until NOW!  I just tried Ken's version and they turned out perfect, just like he stated in the recipe.  The only thing different that I did this tine that I haven't done in the past was add the vinegar.  Thank you Ken!!!!

Another helpful suggestion to being able to peel your eggs is to make sure the eggs you use are not brand new from the store. Using eggs that you bought a week or 2 ago works better than newer eggs.

I've used this recipe about 20 times now and it's worked perfectly every time. I did have to up the cooking time to about 20 minutes, but that may be an elevation/egg-size thing. 

One note to people having trouble peeling them: They still have to be peeled like a normal egg. My husband was repeatedly complaining about the shell ripping chunks of the egg out ... then I discovered that he was only knocking them on the counter 2-3 times before peeling them, then peeling them with his nails instead of the ball of his thumb. Try cracking them COMPLETELY (20-30 knocks on the counter on EVERY part of the egg) and peeling them with the ball of your thumb rather than your nails. I've had over 100 eggs from this recipe shell perfectly every time in this manner, even when they were bought from the store less than an hour before.

Yep. Perfect all right. I can cook almost anything but I'd always had trouble boiling eggs. We really like them so I made 18 and increased the boil time to 20 min then let them sit in the hot water for another 5 (don't know if this made a differenceI just got busy with something else).

These are perfect.  I can finally enjoy hard boiled eggs.  Other recipes I followed still had the shell sticking.  These peel easy and are cooked perfectly.
I used 4 eggs and cooked them for 12 minutes, and then put them in a bowl of ice water for 15 minutes to cool.  They are good immediately after and peel easily.

I didn't find this recipe helpful. In fact, I might say that it made things worse. The egg was not at all easy to peel and I found that the egg whites were more rubbery than usual.

This is what I do.
Put eggs into a pot of cold water.
Heat to a rolling boil.
Turn off the heat but leave the pot on the burner.
Set timer for 20 minutes then remove from heat.
Put eggs into cold water, crack the shells, let them sit for 1/2 hour or so. Peel shells and enjoy.

I've been boiling eggs in "just water" & putting them in cold water right after forever. Peeling them has always been a HUGE pain. Followed the recipe and they peeled so easy & they weren't overcooked! Yay!

After reading all of the rave reviews, I was very excited to try this method.  Unfortunately; despite following the instructions precisely, my eggs were anything but perfect.  The yolks were not cooked all the way through and I didn't have one egg that I didn't lose some of the white on when peeling.

Who would have thunk you need a recipe for hard boiled eggs, but I did and thank you!  Not sure if it was the ice bath, the vinegar, the salt... who cares, it works!  My mom did hard boiled eggs for deviled eggs for Easter and griped the whole time about the shells sticking.  So I made these for her this way today and she was so skeptical until the shells just slid away!  It's kinda nice to say "I told you so" to your mom, even when you are 44 years old!

Seriously, don't laugh.  This may sound crazy, but this is the PERFECT way to boil eggs.  Because I had extra large eggs, I increased the cooking time for an extra minute or two.  Ken didn't lie.  We all benefit from his sleepless night.

I am not an egg eating person so I have no idea if they taste good but they looked perfect!  I made Easter eggs with them and then made deviled eggs from them to take to dinner.  Everyone ate them up so they must have been good.

Thank you Ken!  I can cook just about anything, people have even told me that I should sell my baked goods.  But I could never hard boil an egg, as silly as that sounds.  But now I can, thanks to Ken and his incredible technique!  I did have one egg crack when I put it in, but I think it might have hit the side of the pan when I dropped it in.  The next time I will just lower them in with a spoon.  The seven remaining eggs peeled perfectly.  I have honestly never had that happen before.  And don't think it's from lack of effort!  I love deviled eggs and have served up some that look like my cat clawed at the egg white before I stuffed it.  

Thanks again Ken, you're a genius in my book!  My husband is pretty happy too!

I'm amazed.  Went according to directions (doubled)and ruined the eggs.  Shell stuck to whites and they were UNDERcooked.  BTW..did have 3 older eggs in pot, those shells did not stick.  Now I need to start all over.  Thankfully I have another 18 pack.

:( So sad! Almost half of my eggs cracked the moment I put them in. I even used an egg dipper I put them in so gently. No need for an easily peeled egg when it's cracked to begin with. Cracked eggs won't work well for Easter eggs!

OMG!! These ARE perfect! I did 4 dozen this way this morning, (one dozen at a time) and they are better than I have ever done with other methods. (Turning off heat and letting them steam) I didn't even do the ice water with some of them and they still peeled perfectly while still warm. And they were fresh eggs as well! Awesome... thanks for the tip!
I also tipped the carton of eggs on their sides as suggested by another member, and the yolks are perfectly centered. Using both of these methods, I now have perfect eggs. Thanks!

For all those brown egg people out there...if you hard boil the eggs egg-sactly the way Ken does with the vinegar and salt...the brown color will scrape off when you're done...leaving perfect eggs for Easter egg coloring. We raise hens and have a ton of brown eggs. I just couldn't bring myself to buying white eggs when we have so many brown ones. So, Ken's recipe did the trick! I've always had a problem with hard boiling them and one of my theories is they can't be too fresh. Ken, thanks for your sleepless night of hard boiling eggs...I can't believe it worked!

Throw out all of those other "perfect" hard boiled egg recipes because this one is just that...PERFECT!  The key is cooking the eggs in a slow simmer for 14 minutes, then plunging the eggs into a super-cold water bath.  After cooling, the shells are easily cracked by smacking, then rolling, them onto the counter to loosen, then peeling under cold water to reveal the perfectly-cooked, yellow-yolked egg (NO GREEN YOLKS!). Thanks, Ken!

So easy.  I think I will try for 15 minutes because on some eggs there is a small speck of liquid in the middle of the yolk.  I took the tip of the knife to get it out.  Otherwise a perfect egg.

PERFECT!  This was first time I was able to peel ALL the eggs I cooked without having at least one messed up.  Who would have thought you needed a recipe to boil eggs?  Thank you Ken for sharing this and ECHO1272 - thank you for the tip on gently stirring the eggs to get the yolks centered for deviled eggs.

Cooked perfectly. Cut down the boiling time to 12 minutes because the eggs were on the smaller side. Subbed apple cider vinegar for white vinegar, worked fine.

Amazing. A tip is to run the eggs under warm water before putting in the boiling water. This keeps them from cracking when you put them in the boiling water. Perfect eggs! Can't wait for Easter.

I am revisiting my previous review just to say that for years now, I've never made eggs any other way, and they come out absolutely perfect each and every time!  I've passed this "recipe" on to so many other people since then. I don't believe that the vinegar and the salt "don't make a difference" as others have stated.  I've tried many methods (and I do NOT submerge these in ice water, actually, so for people who say that's the only trick--not so--and I have tried the ice water trick with other hard boiled eggs and it doesn't always work) and this is still the best way to make them.  Ken, you are a genius!

Original review:  I will never make hard-boiled eggs again any other way!  I used to do the classic "put them in cold water, bring to a boil, take off heat & cover" method, but almost always had problems shelling them.  The shell on these comes off in a snap and the egg is cooked perfectly.  Only one piece of advice:  Make sure you keep an eye on the water, don't let it boil too hard after you add the eggs; mine reached a fast boil again once and that time one of the eggs cracked open.

My mother taught me the cold water rinse about 40 years ago. I never realized it was a mystery. I only boil mine for 12 minutes though. Any longer, and I think they start to get rubbery.

Wow! This is the first time that I have made PERFECT hard boiled egg, not a single scratch or dent on the egg from tearing off the shell, it came off like butter. Here are my tips: Put it on 9 or high to boil, put the eggs in, and then reduce to a 6-7. Make sure they have small bubbles coming up. PLACE THE EGGS IN WITH A SPOON! I cracked 2 of my eggs from just letting them go. Once the process is done, refill the pot with cold water and add ice. 15 minutes later, you peel a piece of perfection. Is going to go great in my Potato Egg Salad.

It's hard not to give this recipe a 5 star rating, considering how simple the directions are.  BUT, I give it a 5 star rating because I didn't know how long to boil an egg and after they were done, the eggs pealed very easily after sitting in the ice water for @ 30 minutes.   Thanks Ken for a recipe that we should know but not all of us do know.

UNBELIEVABLE you'd think after cooking all these years i wouldn't need a recipe to hard boil eggs.. well i sure did.... after listening to people tell me a hundred different ways how to do it... well thanks to ken it was a success. I was worried about different sizes of eggs.. and it didn't seem to make a difference if you use medium or large... I havne't tried thiis recipe with farm eggs yet... i sort of given up on them... but i will try and give another review.  my cousin in law's chickens can't seem to keep a consistant size egg... and i have had a lot of failed attempts... thanks again for the recipe

I was a skeptic, but it worked. First time in a long time that I was able to peel an egg. While peeling, I noticed that the shell stayed together in big chunks making it easy to come off the egg. Doing it the old way, the eggs broke in tiny little pieces and stuck to the egg along with the skin making it impossible to peel.

One thing I could never do was make good hard boiled eggs that peel easy and are nice and yellow instead of dingy yellow with a green ring around the yolk . . . well now I can!  This really works!  Mine came out a tad bit undercooked in the middle, but that was my fault because when I lowered the temp to simmer, I lowered it too far, and when I checked again - it wasn't simmering.  Next time I'll keep a better eye on the simmering part.  Peeling the eggs was so easy.  The shells slipped right off, which I was never able to do before.  Thank you Ken, for teaching me how to make great hard boiled eggs!

I followed the directions exactly and ended up with really soggy soft boiled eggs.  I cooked it for another 14 minutes and got "almost" hard boiled eggs but they did not peel well at all, the whites were not firm and came off with the shell.  It seemed like they were still far from being hard boiled.

Awesome. Most of my eggs peeled in one or two pieces, which never happens with my usual method (boil water/eggs, cover, remove from heat, let sit, etc). Definitely will use this method from now on. Thanks!

Try this - it really works! I made 18 hardboiled eggs with this method (even reused the water to make the last six) and every one peeled perfectly. The yolks were done perfectly as well. You can't go wrong with this method. Thanks, Ken!

This was TOTALLY awesome!  We eat deviled eggs a lot because they're my brother's favorite thing, but we live at 7,000 feet and have SUCH a hard time getting anything to turn out that involves boiling liquid (i.e., pasta, baking, pretty much anything you cook, etc.).  Because of our elevation, I had to cook them 20 minutes, and they could probably have done with maybe 2 minutes more, but they were SO easy to peel and looked gorgeous!  Ken is my new hero.

I'm undecided on this really. I've made hardboiled eggs in my lifetime too many times to count. I usually use the method of putting the eggs in water, then boiling, then turning off the gas and let them sit about 12-14 minutes, covered.  Rinse immediatedly under cold running water. I never really have a problem with peeling, however I do sometimes have a green/gray edge around the yolk.  Never thought anything of it actually. Using this method, I broke 2 eggs putting them carefully in the water with a slotted spoon (they were salvageable.  Because of the vinegar?)  And I had one egg where the yolk was overcooked. The shells did peel off nicely, but I don't usually have that problem anyway. The ONE thing I will say?  They did not stink as much in the fridge after boiling. Vinegar?  I don't know.

Quite possibly the biggest disaster I've ever had.  The skin stuck to the eggs, and I had so many divets in them once pealed, they are useless.  My Easter is ruined.

OH MY GOD! I can't tell you how many times and ways I have tried to make hard boiled eggs. These by far are PERFECT the best I've ever made. THANK YOU KEN! I will pass this method onto everyone I know Great job finally decoding the "Hardboiled Eggs". It works great too if you have a pot with the strainer, like for pasta. I left the strainer out, put the eggs in it and when the water was boiling I just lowered them down. This way there was no splashing water when dropping the eggs in.

This does not work on truly FRESH eggs!!  I mean from the nest to the boiling water.  FRESH eggs need to sit a week before you boil them.  They will do perfect then!  Grocery store eggs are not that fresh.

These certainly worked, but I've never had a hard time with peeling eggs unless they were brand new. I'm not totally convinced that the vinegar does anything. I also broke 2 trying to carefully drop into the water, I should have used a slotted spoon. I'll stick with my normal method, but thanks for sharing your recipe.

The shell sticks to the egg when the eggs are quite fresh.  I saw a science-based food show once that explained that adding vinegar changes the Ph of the egg, thereby allowing the shell to release easier.  Likewise as an egg ages, the Ph changes, so an older egg won't have a problem with sticking either, but who wants to eat that!  Someone commented that it's the ice water that does the trick, but I think there's merit to the vinegar thing.  So, thanks for figuring out the right ratio.

Finally! I was able to peel hard boiled eggs without the white sticking to the shell. I followed the instructions exactly and they turned out perfectly. I just finished making them for the second time to be sure it really does work, and this time seemed even easier. Thank you Ken. We are really enjoying the eggs.

I followed the recipe as written although I did follow other reviewer's advice for letting eggs sit until room temperature before boiling as well as putting eggs in cold water instead of ice water (then stored in fridge until ready to peel and eat). There were no cracks and the eggs were cooked just right.  I used large brown eggs and the 14 min seemed just right (12 min probably would have made them a touch creamier though).  I have never been successful making good hard boiled eggs. This will be my new go-to recipe. Thank you!

Every week I use this recipe to make a dozen hard boiled eggs for the week ahead (I add an extra 1/4 c vinegar and tbsp salt and 2 min boiling for the extra four eggs). Perfect every time. No uncooked yellow, no graying of the yolk.

This recipe is perfect as is! Followed it exactly two different times and I wouldn't change a thing. Perfect, creamy yolks, and the shells come off so easily. Thanks for doing the research!

Most perfect hard-boiled egg ever. Bright yellow yolks with no gray ring, perfectly cooked, and I peeled a dozen in less than 2 minutes. Call it voodoo if you must, your eggs will still be perfect.

I don't know what I did wrong. I thought a followed the instructions, but several of the eggs cracked and leaked as soon as they hit the boiling water. Maybe the eggs have to be at room temperature first or something.

These DID come out perfect! I took another reviewers advice to crack the eggs just after submerging in the ice bath. I read another review that states the vinegar & salt are not necessary, just submerge the eggs in an ice bath pronto.....well....i have been doing just that for years and still struggled with peeling the shell. Whatever the science behind Ken's method, it works perfect!!

OMG! This really works! I've tried every method others say work for them, but not for me. Using the vinegar and salt together along with allowing the eggs to reach room temp before cooking and putting them in an ice bath immediately after did the trick.  No cracked shells. The eggs shed their peels perfectly and easily. Note: I cooked some fresh white eggs and older brown eggs together to test for a difference, but there was none. Both peeled equally well. I used cider vinegar, being out of white, and it worked just as well.

13 mins is enough, but I've tried just using ice water to get them to peel easily for years and it just isn't enough, inconsistent, etc. I do think the vinegar helps.  Vinegar is cheap, a sm bottle will last a really long time.

I am 53 years old and have tried all kinds of methods for boiling eggs, including using "old" eggs.  It's always been hit and miss with sticking egg shells.  We boiled 2.5 dozen eggs yesterday with Ken's vinegar/salt water.  It is THE BEST method I have ever tried!!!!  The peels slipped right off even after overnight refrigeration.  The yolks are a beautiful yellow with no grayish coating.  I'm so pleased.  This is going into my favorites book.

Peeling took forever and when I was done they looked like swiss cheese.  I thought, luckily I am using them in a salad.  Then I started to cut them and my biggest egg fear came true.  They were not done.

An excellent recipe. The eggs were very easy to peel. I live at high altitude and the large eggs were perfect at 14-15 minutes. I checked one at 14 minutes and it wasn't quite done. So, I cooked the rest of the eggs for 15 minutes. The yolks were a beautiful yellow.

Thank you, Ken!  I have chickens and it is impossible to peel the shell off of a FRESH egg that I hard boil....until now!  Of course, I haven't tried it with JUST LAYED EGGS, yet...but I will.  Another hint, that a friend told me (before this recipe) is to hard boil the eggs.  Cut the shells and egg with a knife, in half, and use a spoon to scoop out the egg.  It does work 90% of the time but this, so far, has worked alot better!!!

Wow!  This worked like a charm last night, and there is no vinegar taste whatsoever.  My eggs match the above photo exactly!  No green coat on the yolk, and the shells peeled off easily.

Ken, you are my favorite!!  I know others have said it before, but I have to chime in as well--this WORKS!!  I have tried MANY other methods and I have used old eggs instead of new--no matter what I tried, peeling them was always a frustrating,naughty-word inducing chore.  But not this time!  And I used fresh eggs since I forgot to stock up for Easter and bought them the day before I cooked them. Oops. But even with poor planning on my part, it still worked wonderfully...EVERY SINGLE EGG peeled beautifully and the yolks were a lovely yellow.  I made a dozen eggs and increased the water, salt, and vinegar accordingly.  PERFECTION.  I love deviled eggs and now I look forward to making them more often--they'll be delicious AND pretty. :-)  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Have been doing eggs for more years than I care to remember but tried this and it's FANTASTIC!!!  Will never do it differently again.  Did 3 batches for Easter and not one piece of shell or sticking. Thanks so much. (They say you can't teach an old dog a new trick but not so)

I did this recipe with 36 eggs. I must have done something wrong because these were the worst eggs I have ever cracked in my life! I couldn't even use half of them they stuck so bad. I quadrupled everything on the recipe thinking it would work...but I guess not. Ugh! Have to go boil more eggs now...using a different recipe! :(

This is a good technique, there is another one too. I learned from food network to put the cold eggs in cold water then bring to a full rolling boil, cover pan and remove from heat and set timer for 10 minutes.  Then plunge into cold water.  Perfect every single time and very quick!

I tried this recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Perfect doneness and super easy to peel. I was searching for both. Love it, Thanks Ken!

This recipe blew me away!  I raise chickens and have tried dozens of recipes to hard boil eggs.  I was told fresh eggs are harder to peel and I was living proof that that was a fact.  Today, I tried Ken's recipe.  Here's how I did it:  The eggs were already boiling for about a minute when I found the recipe.  I hurried and sprinkled about a teaspoon of salt, probably less, and dumped about 1/4 of a cup in the already boiling water.  I boiled them for another 14 minutes.  I tested one egg by plunging it in a bowl of ice that had just enough water to submerge the ice.  I peeled it immediately.  What I noticed was that the shell was actually separated from the egg!!!!  I immediately put all the other eggs in the ice.  I did not wait.  I started to peel each one in amazement as all of the eggs had SPACE between the egg and the shell!!!  None of the eggs were overcooked.  I am still in shock!  You have no idea how many eggs I have mutilated trying to peel.

Didn't work for me, still hard to peel and I made sure to follow the directions exactly including letting them warm to room temp.. It might be that I used fresh eggs from our hens and they say the older the egg the easier they are to peel. All Well

Worked a charm.  The only addition I made was to poke a small hole in the large end of each egg to let the air pocket empty during cooking, so the eggs come out evenly shaped.

Ken has the best hard boiled egg  recipe. My eggs came out perfect except the one that cracked.  I agree with a previous reviewer, next time I will let the eggs get closer to room temperature before putting them into the boiling water.

I make the quick red beet egg recipe elsewhere on this site and like to start with perfect hard boiled eggs. This recipe truly gives a perfect hard boiled egg if followed exactly. 

I always started my eggs in cold water and turned the heat off when the water started to boil, so I tried to use that technique with the ingredients in this recipe - the result was the usual eggs that are hard to peel. Apparently the eggs really do have to be put into the boiling water and as one reviewer stated the eggs should really be at room temperature when they go in (I tried it as written one other time with 7 room temp eggs and one refrigerated egg - the refrigerated egg was the one that the shell broke on early in cooking). 

So, if you follow this recipe just as written, you will indeed have perfect hard boiled eggs. One other thing I do that may not be necessary with this recipe is to shake the pot right after I drain the water, which cracks the shells a bit and lets the cold water I add get between the egg and the shell for easier separation.

Well Ken, you saved the day on the 4th of July!  I've been making deviled eggs for many years and there are so many wives tales out there about how to cook hard boiled eggs!  My first batch of 18 eggs stuck to the shells (due to another person's crazy advice), which = egg salad!  I followed your directions EGGxactly and Voila!  Perfection!  Thank you for sharing!  EGGcellent!

The inner membrane of the egg, the translucent skin that envelops the albumen, shrinks away from the egg white once you plunge the boiling hot eggs in ice water. We use eggs directly from the coup and never have trouble peeling the hard boiled egg under running water. What I like about Ken's method is placing the eggs directly in the boiling water. I couldn't believe they wouldn't crack. I use kitchen tongs to put them in the water. And, 14 minutes is just perfect for large eggs, whether refrigerated or not. I don't use vinegar or salt, and it works perfectly. We try to get unwashed eggs and we don't refrigerate them. You know how eggs spatter when you fry them? It's because refrigerated eggs absorb moisture through the shell. Unwashed eggs left on the kitchen counter don't splatter. We're one of the few countries that refrigerates eggs.

Thank you!! I've tried so many recipes that claim they are the perfect hard boiled egg and still fail or are too difficult. these were perfect (and I mean PERFECT)! no risk of over cooking and there were EASY to peel even with relatively fresh eggs. Thank you again!!

There’s more to a perfect hardboiled egg than just getting it to peel and that’s getting a beautiful yellow center without the yucky green edge that comes from over cooking.   This recipe passes both tests.  Perfect every time, even when I’ve used fresh eggs.   It should be noted, that this recipe works best with “large” eggs.   Whenever I’ve used extra large or jumbo eggs, the centers were underdone using the recommended cook time.

I have been on this website for years and have never reviewed a recipe here before, but I had to after making this one.  All I can say is "Wow!"  I followed the recipe exactly and you really do get perfect eggs!!  I have tried cold water, ice water and other things but still always had several eggs that were almost impossible to peel.  I just made them and had 13 perfectly cooked (no green), super easy peeling eggs!  Thank you!  Thank you! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  I will never hard boil eggs any other way again!  This recipe actually makes me want to hard boil eggs!

This did not produce a 'perfect egg'. Followed to a T in an effort to make our Easter Eggs peel easy after coloring. Didn't happen. I will stick with my way: after boiling put eggs in cold water for a few minutes until you can touch them, then immediately peel, refrigerate until ready to use. Must peel while egg is still warm. This is the only way I can peel hard boiled eggs without mutilating them.

Wow Ken, you 'cracked' the code on hard boiling eggs to perfection!  I live at a high altitude and have always had a problem getting them just right.  That nightmare all stopped today.  Even though you did all the research, I feel like the smart one!  Many thanks.

I've spent the last 41 years dreading making hard boiled eggs.  It had to be a real special occassion to suffer the torture.  The shells aways stuck, the yolks were either not cooked completely or were deep green.  Since finding this recipe I've made them at least once a week for the past 16 weeks. THANK YOU!!!!

This works!  I have always tried the traditional method, but this can't be beat!  I would never go back to the old method.  I have laying hens and use fresh eggs.  They say "allow fresh eggs to sit for 14 days or they are impossible to hard boil and peel".  I allow 7 days and boil for 16 minutes instead of 14, same with cooling....PERFECT!!

I am so happy with this recipe. I always ruined eggs but three batches later no issues. For the person who said that the salt and the vinegar aren't really necessary (essentially) I would like to point out that the salt actually does flavor the eggs slightly. Vinegar breaks down the shells and makes them easier to peel, too. 

Thank you, Ken!!

Use week old eggs for easy peeling. Gently shake pot after bringing eggs to a boil to keep yokes centered. Can wrap peeled eggs in plastic or put unpeeled eggs in cold water & keep in fridge up to 1 week. Crack shells immediately after putting in cold water. This allows gas which turns the yolk blue, to escape. I boiled 24 eggs for 20 minutes as 14 was still mushy. I made 40 deviled eggs for my 1st. grandchild's baby shower. They all had yellow yokes & peeled easily. Thanks Ken.

Thank you!  I have struggled with this problem and finally found a unique answer, I 've tried the salt, but must be the vinegar /salt combo that makes this work.  GRACIAS

Awesome job Ken! I have always had to let the eggs cool for hours to get them to easily release the shells. Hate that picky, piecy shattered mess that sometimes takes half the egg with it! I only had cider vinegar but it worked beautifully!!!! These were the easiest peeling eggs I have ever seen and I have peeled a S*@T ton of eggs in my day. Thanks for sharing.

OMG if I could give this 10 stars, I would.  It's a CHRISTMAS MIRACLE that I can now cook hard boiled eggs!  No kidding.  I've spent my entire life trying every single trick known to man for making hard boiled eggs...nothing EVER works for me.  I've tried new eggs, old eggs, fresh eggs, store eggs, large eggs, small eggs, starting with cold water vs. hot water...and even my vegetable steamer.  So frustrating!  But these came out ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe...it's amazing  :))  I will need to cook mine just a minute or two longer next time tho...there was this teeniest spot in the middle of them that wasn't quite cooked all the way.  Still tho...worlds apart from my previous attempts!

Okay, Ken you won the argument of yes a recipe is needed to boil an egg. I have been boiling eggs for recipes for at least 25 years. The white was softer than my usual and the yellow was a perfect color of yellow. It had no gray green ring with the same eggs I have always been using. I don't know if it is the salt, vinegar, or precise boiling method? I laughed whenever I seen the recipe, but now I can say I will use this method to boil eggs from now on. TY

i've tried many combinations of salt and vinegar without it working, but this does...magic proportions? who knows, who cares! for once in my life, i'm finally getting compliments on the perfect medium egg. (i DO know that making sure your eggs are fresh and not over-cooking makes a really big difference to flavor, texture, and ease of peeling, just and FYI...)

Thanks Ken but, I too use vinegar and salt, I put the eggs in right away. When is reaches  a boil, I reduce heat to simmer and let it go for 20 or so minutes, turn off heat let the pot on the burner for a couple minutes then drain and add ice water. They turn out great too.

Sorry - just didn't think this was worth the fuss.  The eggs peeled easily, but were a little undercooked for our taste.  I'll just stick the good ol' boil and cover method.

This is the perfect method for hard boiling eggs.  Just follow the recipe as it is presented and you will be golden.  I have always had problems with hard boiled eggs. They never turned out quite right and I have lived through numerous deviled egg nightmares when I got to the peeling stage. Sometime got so mad I just threw the whole lot down the grinder. I just made 8 eggs following this recipe step by step. I pulled one out of the icy cooling water, whacked it on the side of the sink and it was perfectly peeled 3 seconds later.  Salted it, popped it in my watering mouth and tasted pure perfection! Thanks!

I boiled 3 dozen eggs for my kids to color.  I made one pot of the boiling water with salt and vinegar.  I boiled a dozen eggs a time and removed them with a slotted spoon in between and cooled in a pot of cold water for 15 minutes.  Used the next day, Easter, for deviled eggs.  They shell came off perfect and they were perfectly cooked! Thanks! :O)

I make hard boiled eggs quite often, pickled eggs, deviled eggs, egg salad, etc. and till now, have struggled peeling them.  I did internet searches and tried everything from a-z, but still had those that just didn't want to come out of their shell.  I read that using older eggs would work better, but still found them difficult.  Well, I tried this with 1 1/2 dozen eggs and every one of them just sort of slipped out and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  No green rings, not too hard or soft.  Perfect!

THAAAAAANK YOOOOOU!!!!  I've been having a lot of trouble hard boiling the farm fresh eggs from our chickens because the membrane is a little thicker than store bought, and the shells would always stick.  But this recipe made them perfect!!!

wow, this is so exciting! Shouldn't be such a big deal, but what a delight to easily peel eggs. I use these cute little bento egg shapers to form my kids hard-boiled eggs for their lunches, and you have to do it with still-hot eggs. Very frustrating if they don't peel easily! Thank you, Ken!

Terrific method!  Thanks Ken!  I also take the eggs out of the fridge a few minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature.  I think this prevents them from cracking when you place them in the boiling water.

I made this exactly as written- and the eggs turned out perfectly. This method yielded silky, fully cooked yolks, peels that slipped off effortlessly and best of all- no grey yolk rings. This will be my method for boiling eggs from now on.

The eggs turned out great.  Tried to just cook them for 10 min. as suggested in the reviews - you def. need to cook the full 14 minutes.

They were pretty good, I have a microwave egg cooker that works great! but it only cooks four at a time and I used this version to make 12. I like how my microwave one does a better job.

Wow, this really worked!  The shell peeled quite easily and the yolk was a bright yellow.  I got the eggs from an organic farm near me.  NOTE:  The farmer told me not to hard boil farm-fresh eggs - - older eggs are better to hard boil.  Most eggs in the grocery store are 5-6 weeks old.  All these eggs needed was a pinch of sea salt...YUM!

Sorry Ken...I know you are insisting on the timing of this thing, but 14 minutes wasn't long enough in this higher elevation. We ended up with soft boiled eggs. A disappointment on Easter, but they did peel rather cleanly, and there wasn't a green ring around the outside of the yoke, so I gave it four stars. I'll try again with a longer cooking time.

This did not work for what we like.  My son likes the whites only - and 14 minutes did not cook the center hard enough to remove easily.  It kept breaking apart and sticking to the whites.  Also, this did not make peeling the egg any easier.  In fact, I had more trouble with it.  I'm going to stick with my old method of hard boiling eggs.

I used freshly purchased eggs and they peeled beautifully, were perfectly cooked, and had not a trace of color around the perfectly centered yolks.  I didn't take my eggs out of the refrigerator until I placed the pan on the stove, so one of mine cracked as I lowered it into the boiling water.  (You couldn't tell which one it was after they were cooked.)  Next time, I'll allow them to sit at room temperature a bit longer.  Thank you, Ken!

Perfection, but follow the instructions. Make sure you do boil the eggs for the time it states. I thought that was way to long so I didn't and they were soft so I put them back on the burner and they still turned out perfect. Just follow the instructions as stated and you will have perfect eggs.

Ok...so this is perfect!!!  I was nervous because I was going to hard boil a dozen eggs for the kids to dye for Easter eggs.....I did as instructed....the eggs were dyed yesterday afternoon....and today the hubster decides to make a lil egg salad for lunch.....I watched over him as he "easily" peeled the eggs.....and then I asked him to cut them open and they were perfect....nice yellow yolks...no gray line!  Yes....Perfection! I will be hard boiling by this method only from now on....thanks!

I usually use a little less vinegar in the water, no salt, and the eggs have about a 75% chance of being cooked appropriately (neither under, nor over) and easy to peel.  I've never had any luck with any of the recipes that say to bring to a boil and remove from heat - my yolks are NEVER completely cooked through if I do it that way, letting them sit for 15 or even 20 minutes.  I was very curious if this recipe would do any better, and so far it has proven itself a winner!  I lowered them into the boiling water with a slotted wooden spoon, and kept a close eye on them as they cooked - I reduced the heat to medium so the water was probably more at a heavy simmer than "boiling", and not one egg cracked.  I did notice that tiny bubbles seemed to attach to the shells and sort of fizz as they cooked - never noticed that before but I wondered if the salt and vinegar combined was "doing something" to the eggs.  I've only peeled a couple so far and they peel like a dream and are perfectly cooked!  Thanks Ken!

I usually had good luck putting the eggs into cold water, bring it to a boil and then cover and take off the heat. But, I tried this recipe, mostly out of curiosity and was happy to find out it worked perfectly just as claimed! I agree with others who said to let the eggs set out for 5-10 minutes before putting into the hot water. Thank you!!!

Perfect, I was using large eggs (rather small large eggs) and only boiled them 12 minutes.  I was very careful to gently lower them into the boiling water with a slotted spoon, one at a time.  That kept them from breaking.  The whites were perfect and the yolk creamy and bright yellow.  Thank you Ken for a great method.

This recipe works great and results with easy to peal eggs.  Tip to prevent eggs from cracking when placing them into boiling water...  Let the eggs rest at room temp 5 - 10 minutes before placing them in the boiling water.  When I made my first batch eggs 4 of my eggs cracked, even though I placed them very gently into the boiling water.  I realized that my eggs were probably too cold, I think the shock of placing cold eggs in boiling water made them crack.  For my 2nd & 3rd batches I used eggs that sat out a bit and none of those eggs cracked in the boiling water.

I did these last night so that my kids could color eggs for easter today. I used fresh, straight from the chicken eggs and followed the directions exactly. 2 separate batchs of eggs and the test eggs from each batch were perfect. Perfect yoke, perfect texture and the shell peeled right off. We ate 3 out of each dozen so I think that's a pretty good sampling.I didn't have a single broken egg but, as another reviewer suggested, I placed the eggs in a bowl of warm water as the water in the pan was being brought to a boil.

Wow!  I've always made a fine hardboiled egg, but most of the time they were impossible to peal. This technique was almost perfect.  Instead of boiling for 14 minutes.  I started with cold water, brought to a rolling boil, then removed from heat, covered and let sit for 10 minutes.  Then I transfered them to the ice water.   I don't know if it was the salt, vinegar or ice water, but the eggs pealed so easily, the white was firm without being rubbery and the yolk was creamy and the perfect yellow color.

I just made a dozen eggs Ken's way and I have 10 easy-to-peel, no ring around the bright yellow yolk hard-boiled eggs.  Why only 10?  'Cause I ate the other two for lunch!  Thank you, Ken.

I made these eggs today and they turned out perfectly.  I wish I had known about this method last Christmas when I had to make nine dozen deviled eggs.  I had a terrible time getting the shells off and this way would have saved me a lot of time and frustration.

These worked out well for me. I did have 2 eggs crack (out of 12), but, to me, that's a small price to pay for having eggs that WILL actually peel! I will definately be using this method again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The first egg popped as soon as it hit the water (maybe due to temperature difference) but the rest came out beautifully! Easy to peel and no yucky gray yolk!

OMG!  This SO works!  I always "aged" eggs for a couple of weeks so they would peel easy, what a pain!  I cover the eggs in a sauce pan with cold water, bring them to a boil, cover and remove from the heat for 20-25 minutes.  Then drain the water, shake the pan a little to crack the shells, and put under cold water.  Peeling was still iffy.  Today I bought fresh eggs and came home and tried this.  EVERY egg peeled perfectly!  Thanks Ken, you're my egg hero!

I'll have to agree that the salt and vinegar are not necessary. My Dad taught me to run the cooked eggs under cold water until cool enough to handle. Pour off all the water, then shake the pan vigorously until all the shells are well-cracked. Most off the shells will fall off by themselves! Also I only boil them for 5 mins then remove from the heat and let stand for 10 mins. Never had a green egg!

They do peel easily.  However, 4 out of 12 cracked upon entering the hot water.  Will go back to the old tried and true method.

After reading many of the reviews, I decided to use a combination of old and fresh eggs.  The claims are correct, I had no bruised yolks and the peeling slipped off as promised from all of the eggs.  Some of the eggs did burst, next time I'll try starting them all in the cold water solution. Salt raises the boiling temp of water, so hotter water.. less cooking time.. saves energy.  Steaming is two minutes faster, but I don't always have fresh eggs. I'm happy with this technique.

This worked ok.  I didn't have any problem peeling the eggs, but I think it had more to do with the eggs being a week old than anything else.  I was frustrated because I broke a couple of the eggs getting them into the boiling water.  I ended up using a spoon to lower them into the water.  I, too, will probably stick with my regular method, the "Basic Hard-Cooked Eggs" recipe from the American Egg Board on this site and use week-old eggs.  I guess the true test of this recipe is to use fresh eggs!

This recipe made peeling the eggs so easy.  First time I've EVER made deviled eggs without having to choose the best looking whites to stuff (and give the crummy ones to the dog)!  Now when family asks for deviled eggs, I won't dread it!  Thank you for publishing this!  We will call them "Ken's Eggs" too LOL

I have chickens. Although his method is probably good, I can take a fresh(day of laying) egg and steam it for about 13 minutes and the shell slides off 95% of the time. After steaming I cool quickly in ice water.

I agree with Gretchin, to a point.  You need to buy the eggs about a week in advance.  But the 14 minutes seems to be a good timeline.

I'm going to give it 3 out of 5 stars because I didn't see any difference from the way I usually do it.  I put the eggs in a pot and add water to about 2 inches above the eggs.  Once the water gets to a rolling boil, I turn the heat off and leave the eggs in the pot for about 30 minutes.  I cool them off by emptying the hot water out of the pot and fill it with cold water and ice cubes and let it sit for about 15 minutes.  Peeling the eggs is very easy  at this point.

I am going to try the vinegar and salt.  But, to get a hard boiled egg with no green around the yolk as well as a creamy yolk.  Bring the water to a boil and then cover and remove from heat.  Remove the eggs to an ice bath after 14 minutes.  Try it.

I've been boiling eggs this way for a while now, but I do things a bit differently. The vinegar is not really necessary, but I do use the salt. It keeps the eggs from "leaking" Also, I like to put the eggs in a bowl of warm water while the water is boiling, so they don't crack when plunged into boiling water. And, I found that 12 minutes is really enough time to produce the perfect boiled egg.

Bring eggs and water to a boil together.  Add salt after water boils.  No need for vinegar.  After the water boils, turn off the heat and cover.  Let stand for 20 minutes.  Immediately cool in cool water.  Gently crack egg shells.  If you wish, you can peel after cooling and wrap each egg in plastic wrap and keep refrigerated for up to a week.  Otherwise, keep refrigerated in the shell in cold water.

I've tried so many recipes and finally one that works!!! 	I am absolutely over the moon!  :)  Beautiful, easy to peel, hard boiled eggs!!!  Just made a batch before this one using a different recipe that were not peeling at all and took me longer to peel ONE of those eggs than this whole batch.  I've got to remember this recipe for future devilled eggs-it's a lifesaver!

I haven't made egg salad in years, partially because I could never keep the shell from sticking to the egg whites! These eggs came out so beautifully, and in fact, I could "feel" that the eggs were loose inside the shell before I ever cracked them! That was a first! To those people who say you don't need to add this or that or do this or that or that cooking time is too long or too short, fagetaboudit! Just do what Ken says, and it'll work out perfectly. Why would I gripe about a tablespoon of salt or a little bit of vinegar? If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and these instructions for how to get the perfect boiled egg definitely aren't broken! Personally, I'm thankful Ken was here for me when I needed him. Maybe some of the naysayers should write their own set of instructions!

My god, they weren’t kidding when they said these were perfect! And even better, they are the easiest-to-peel eggs I have ever made. I followed the recipe to a tee and strongly recommend you do too if you want the most perfectly cooked, easy-peel hard boiled eggs of your life.

Gonna try the accompanying video’s recommendation of 10 minute cook time for soft boiled eggs next. Thanks Ken! :D

Finally eggs that peel perfectly, even when using fresh eggs! Not everybody has old eggs lying around the house. So if you need perfectly peelable eggs in a pinch, use this recipe!

They did come out perfect! I love to cook. I do every day. I have a sauce business, that I cook all of the sauces.
Hard boiled eggs are one thing I rarely could get right! We all have that simple thing in life that we just can't master! This recipe makes delicious HBE's!

I’m giving this recipe five stars because it really does make perfect hard-boiled eggs. But the nutritional information is incorrect. One hard boiled egg does not contain over 900mg of sodium. It’s more like 60mg. Here’s a tip to prevent cracked eggshells while cooking:  Going from refrigerator to boiling water is what makes them crack. Allow the eggs to warm up some before dropping them into boiling water.

The eggs were very good, no funny taste from the vinegar.  My only suggestion would be to use slightly room temperature eggs.  Two of my eggs cracked when placed in the boiling water.  I have always placed my eggs in Luke warm water and let them warm with the water, but I think that method would cause over cooking.  Overall peeling was super easy, no issues with the shell sticking and losing half the egg white!

While this method may work, using older eggs is the easiest way to do it and eliminates the need to have vinegar or salt in the water.  If your eggs are super fresh, leave them on the counter for a day or two.  Eggs are not refrigerated in supermarkets and restaurants because they really don't need it.  Waffle House has cases of eggs stored at room temperature in every store, and it doesn't hurt them a bit.  They are easier to peel after a couple of days on the counter.  In the hurricane country I grew up in, eggs on the counter were common during power outages and boiled or fried on the camp stove.  Supermarkets just put them in the refrigerated cases because people think they need to be kept cold.  Ask anyone who ever served on a submarine how they stored their fresh eggs.  You will fall over LOL

This is seriously the best way to make fool-proof hard boiled eggs! They never come out overdone where the yolk turns green/blue. Forget the old way of covering the eggs with water first and then boiling.. Do it Ken’s way! ;)

I always had a problem getting the shells off without tearing up the egg.  I've used your recipe twice now and the shells came right off!  Did not have regular vinegar so used red wine vinegar and it still worked.  Thanks so much!!

Holy cow!  This really works!  I have been struggling with peeling hard boiled eggs for years.  I’ve tried all the other “secrets” but nothing seemed to work.  I boiled a full dozen eggs that were straight from the grocery store.  I increased the water to 8 cups and the vinegar to 1/3 cup but followed everything else to the letter.  The shells practically fell off on their own and the eggs are perfect!  Thank you for this recipe!

best hard boiled eggs I;ve ever made. Didn't have white vinegar so I used some rice wine vinegar. Worked the same. Awesome!

These came out awesome! And so easy to peel! I used 11 eggs and only used a large pinch of salt, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. This is my go to recipe from now on!

I am making this now. Happy Easter everybody, happy dying and hunting! One question. I wanted to up the recipe to a dozen eggs. This creates an oddball measurement. It also occurs to me this might change the boil time. Do you have a recommended version for a whole dozen?

The eggs were perfect and peeled easily. I did an entire dozen and three cracked, but I used them for egg salad. I will used the others for chef salad.

I've been trying forever to hard boil my eggs perfectly AND peel perfectly. Found the method right here! Followed the instructions exactly and they not only turned out perfectly (beautiful yellow yolks with no green) but they peeled like a dream! No chipping away at the peel and taking chunks out of the egg. I submerged the  cooked eggs in a bowl of ice water for 20 mins then refrigerated them. So glad I found this method. Now I won't dread making deviled eggs again!

My Alexa suggested this recipe and it’s perfect! The eggs cooked perfectly. Also, I usually have a super difficult time peeling and the eggs look awful, but not with the steps in this recipe. They came out awesome! Highly recommended.

Here's the deal, I don't always have ice on hand nor older eggs but its not mandatory with this recipe, the eggs still peel beautifully most of the time, an ice bath I'm sure helps. 
You do have to be very careful when you add the eggs to the boiling water or they will crack, slotted spoon helps a lot.

Always use old eggs. I add the eggs at the beginning because it's easier, then cook for 10 minutes after the boil is reached.

I have always known that the fresher the eggs, the less they will be difficult to peel.  Let your eggs reach room temperature before cooking. Place the eggs in a pan and add lukewarm water. Salt is not necessary. On a medium-high heat, bring the eggs to a roiling boil, then turn off the heat. Place a lid on the eggs and let stand 15 minutes. Place pan in sink and allow cold water to bathe them until cool. Not only will the shells remove easily, the egg yolk will maintain its yellow color.  The real trick is using fresh eggs.

My mom told me about this about 30 years ago. It doesn't really work if your eggs are fresh. BTW what the salt does do is keep all the white from running out if the eggs crack. I always salt the water. The best way I've found to boil eggs perfectly is to cover them in cold water, bring it to a boil, turn off the heat and cover the pan. Let it sit for 15 minutes and then pour the water out and cool with cold water. Empty the water from the pan, and then shake the pan to crack up the shells, peel under running water. As someone said, you can't use fresh eggs, or eggs that are too old either. Both will have shells that stick to them.

Absolutely wonderful. The eggs peeled perfectly. This was the best ever. I will always use the salt and vinegar.

Eggs came out perfect. If you're making egg salad, use the eggs right after you cool them down. It mixes better with the mayo

This did work perfectly. Perfectly on an brown eggs I pulled out from under chickens. These eggs were very VERY FRESH; hours old with very hard shells. They peeled perfectly after I cooked them. Some times you just can't wait for eggs to get 10 -14 days old before you want to make egg salad. I would not recommend boiling them in a porcelain lined pot though. It did come clean, it looked like the brown color of the eggs would stain my pot but it didn't. I cleaned it immediately.

Works perfectly, every time, regardless of age of eggs.   I make sure to put them in a bowl of ice water after they are done cooking.   Having the shells come off so easily is the best part!

I have made hard boiled eggs in the past. They have NEVER turned out as nicely as they did using this recipe.  I have used this recipe for times now, and each time the eggs turn out perfectly. They are easy to make, cooked the right amount, and are incredibly easy to shell. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These are some really good eggs. The yolk was light and fluffy, and the white of the egg remained light—not dense—too.

I've tried to make hard boiled eggs a few times before and they were under or over cooked so I stopped trying.  After reading reviews for this method, I figured I'd try one more time.  Some reviewers say cool eggs to room temperature, I didn't just pulled them out while water boiled. Also I didn't use old eggs, just bought them yesterday. Followed the directions exactly and eggs came out perfect!! I couldn't believe it.  They were even easy to peel! I'll use this recipe forever!! Thank you! ??

I can make a slow-roasted, stuffed chicken that melts in your mouth.  I can make 20 different amazing soups from scratch, and homemade bread and rolls that would make your grandma jealous.  But, for the life of me, I couldn't make hardboiled eggs until I found this recipe.  They were either overcooked, or difficult to peel.  Follow this recipe.  It works.

I used new eggs and tried this recipe exactly as Ken wrote it, they came out PERFECT!!!!! They came out better than if I were using "old eggs" which used to be the only way i could get eggs to peel easily.  Definitely will use this method regardless of how old or new the eggs are!!!!!

I was really hopeful that this was going to be my new recipe for easy to peel hard boiled eggs.  They peeled more easily than some recipes, but I ended up having to discard a lot of egg with some peel.  I am going to keep searching ...

Since I tried this recipe several years ago, and I have used it for hard boiled eggs ever since.  It really does produce great looking, perfect hard boiled eggs.  No more of that gray tint on the yokes that I used to get from overcooking, or whatever I was doing wrong.  It is very easy to follow, and makes beautiful yellow egg yokes.

The eggs come out perfect, just like the name says! I've had so many issues with hardboiled eggs until now. They were either under or over cooked, or peeling the shell meant taking most of the egg white right along with it.

Brought to simmer as instructed, left in pot with lid 18 minutes ( one minute longer than required, and ALL EGGS were just slightly past RAW. Unedible, and barely peelable

Amazing!! I shelled two dozen eggs in under 10 minutes without losing a bit of egg white. The eggs practically popped out of their shells when I tapped them on the counter.

I made this according to the directions.  It is so easy to do and the eggs were the easiest to peel that I have ever tried.   I have tried several different recipes for hard boiled eggs & still had trouble peeling them without mangling the whites.  My family loves deviled eggs & I always hate to serve them with their whites missing random chunks.  I will use this every time I need hard boiled eggs from now on. (I think the eggs I used  were purchased about a week before I used them.)

Mine didn't turn out perfect. The shells were still hard to peel. I will try it again though.

Be aware that vinegar will cause the brown pigment on the egg shells to rub off. This is normal. The shells are alkaline and the vinegar is acidic.

I inherited a beautiful glass egg plate from my beloved Grandmother and have had the worst luck for the past year in trying to make hard boiled eggs that are easy to peel.  This method works perfectly to make delicious eggs!  Now I will be making deviled eggs for all events served on my beautiful Grandma's egg plate!  Thanks a bunch!

Whether or not the salt and vinegar is necessary, I don't know. Made this just as called for in recipe. When I can crack the circumference of a hard boiled egg, and it peels in two halves, I call that a perfectly boiled hard egg.

Perfect!  I've been hard boiling eggs for many years and finally figured out through this recipe how to get them right for develing!  Eggs were easy to peel, and cooked perfectly at 15 minutes for the large eggs I used.  Try this recipe and you'll never go back to your old one. Who knew something so simple could make such a big difference. Thanks Ken!!

Left out the vinegar and salt. Put cold eggs in water that was at a low boil. Cooked for the recommended 14 minutes, then the ice bath for 30 minutes. Eggs were perfectly cooked and the best part was the shells slipped right off! My eggs were near the expiration date, but don't know if that made a difference.

AWFUL. A total failure, and I followed the directions/video to the letter.  I had to throw out the first egg and then I re-cooked the other 5, which are now "eh", but basically edible.  This is a waste of time.

It works, the shell comes off the egg without it being a disaster. That alone gets a 5 star rating.  Also, I added to the filling some chopped bacon you buy in a bag from Hormel.  Delicious!!!

20 cups water in pasta pot, this will cover the eggs by about an inch and a half and give enough hot water bath that you do not lower your boiling bath temp to much. One cup distilled white vinegar. Four tablespoons of table salt. Stir and bring water vinegar and salt to a boil.Twelve eggs at room temp. overnight.    If you use eggs straight from the refrigerator they will crack every time due to the thermo-expansion when hitting the boiling bath water.  With eggs in pasta strainer put in warm bath of water "kitchen faucet running hot water to cover" start bringing the eggs up to temperature for about two minutes. Transfer strainer of eggs to boiling pasta pot of water "gently and gradually lower into water.   Start timer for fourteen minutes, let boil for the whole time.  Fill another pan with enough water and ice to cover eggs by one inch.  When timer is up on the boiling eggs then move off of burner and then pick up the pasta strainer with the eggs and gently and slowly lower down into the ice bath water, let sit in water for fifteen minutes. You may now pick up the eggs one at a time and crack all over and peel perfect eggs.

I made Ken's recipe  because I wanted to make deviled eggs. They turned out seriously PERFECT. I suggest this recipe. I'm sorry for the people who didn't have good eggs after following this recipe.
This is a different way of cooking eggs, and I love it

Using this recipe and cooling the eggs with cold water makes it so easy to peel the eggs. They peel nicely.  Other recipes I have used, with ice water for cooling, always made the eggs peel too much and were never pretty for deviled eggs. THIS is THE recipe to use for the hard boil portion of deviled eggs.

Finally, a recipe that allows me to easily peel my hard boiled eggs!  While I appreciate what some others are saying about using old eggs and/or dropping them into ice water for easy peeling, those have never worked for me.  I use fresh eggs that I collect daily from my chickens, and really don't want to wait weeks for them to be old enough to peel easily, and I have tried the ice water drop to no avail.  After trying numerous "perfect eggs recipes" that didn't work, I am happy to report that this one really does!  Thanks, Ken

I love hard boiled eggs but hate peeling them so I have seldom made them at home. I have tried every "Perfect/Easy hard boiled egg recipe and idea I have seen, none worked any better than any other. This one however, I have made seven times exactly as written. To date I had one egg that was tough to peel and it wasn't the method, it was one of those eggs you occasionally get where the shell fragments into tiny pieces regardless of the cooking method or whether they were cooked at all.

Thank you for this one, I now have a bowl with ready to eat tasty eggs in my fridge all the time now. Great for a quick snack or ready to become part of a bigger meal.

This combination of ingredients, the cook time and the cooling time/method really produces the perfect hard boiled eggs. I have not been able to accomplish that until I came acrossed this recipe. Thank you!

Carefully follow Ken's recipe for perfect hard boiled eggs every time.  They are easy to unshell and no dark green ring around the yolk.  My go-to recipe for hard boiled eggs!

SAVE THIS RECIPICE! Thank you. I always over or under cook and waste several gallons of water. I added salt and have read the vinegar will help contain the contents if an egg cracks. I added salt and vinegar. One egg cracked but it could be because of the number of eggs I was doing...it made a great snack!

I followed this recipe exactly and it made absolutely perfect hardboiled eggs!!  I was amazed.  I'm not sure which part does it, but my eggs had the perfect yellow center with no green or grey.  When I pealed them, the shelled cracked right in half and almost fell off! No mess or work!  Awesome recipe.

PERFECT. The person who said that the best method is to use cold water 1" above the eggs, turn off  water when it reaches a boil, etc.-- is wrong. I've used that method many times, only to end up disappointed with a bunch of ugly, cracked eggs (with stringy whites & yolks attached to the eggs and all over the water). THIS IS THE RECIPE TO FOLLOW. The only thing I can add that also helps is to use eggs that are at room temperature before placing them into the boiling water. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Well thought out.  Eggs are *always* very, very predictable and lovely when we follow this procedure.  We Happily, I can modify the time if someone wants the centers barely undercooked for a creamy egg salad or what-have-you. HINT: Per someone's review here at allrecipes, we've tried the 'turn the egg carton on the side' option to try to 'center the yolk', and that seems to work better with fresher eggs.  MODIFICATIONS?:  I have found we do not need the vinegar, but that might have to do with sea-level issues, hard water issues, or what have you - so I'm not about to criticize the recipe, just state that we don't need the vinegar here.  That said:  If I'm making eggs for 'in the house use', ***AND IF**** I don't have time for the little bit of fuss behind this recipe, then I simply 'hard boil' eggs in my slow cooker (it took a little practice to learn how long to 'boil' the cold eggs in my particular slow cooker, straight from the fridge - but we've got that down now).  BUT.... those slow cooked eggs obviously don't peel as well as these.  SO....: When I want pretty, easily boiled eggs, I take the time to set out my eggs ahead of time, set up the equipment for this, and voila, lovely eggs with minimal'sh fuss.  HINT:  if you are peeling many eggs at once, let them rattle around in the pan a little to crack them so the peels just slip off!

Superb protocol. I found that by  punching a small hole in the egg shell and avoid any eggs cracking during the cooking process.

I've made tons of boiled eggs in my life: using the exact same cooking temp & time, and using every other trick available: using "older" eggs, poking a hole in the end, doing the cold bath afterward; even rolling the egg in my hand before eating to crush the shell.  It was still hit & miss if my eggs would peel.  BUT I had never used vinegar or salt before.  These eggs came out PERFECT!!!!  I used to think vinegar and salt were just flavoring items, and since they didn't get inside the shell it was a waste to use them and and they didn't do anything.   Well, they do.  I noticed the shells felt different afterward...more flexible.  The vinegar apparently softens them.  Salt changes the boiling point; perhaps it also acts as a corrosive.  Ignore the skeptics.  Ken knows his eggs.  PS:  I made this with FRESH eggs too!  PS:  I made a video of it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOV7VBdNSdQ

Yeah!  PEELABLE eggs!  Frustrated beyond belief that even as a competent cook usually failed at eggs - especially peeling them nice and pretty.  But now, I've got a tried & true method.  Deviled eggs, here I come!

Ken, you tell the truth.  These were perfect!  So creamy and yellow inside.  Not rubbery, not green, not difficult to peel, and absolute perfect texture.  I don't know what you researched to give you this formula, but I thank you for sharing it!  I will also call them "Ken's Eggs" in your honor!

My eggs now come out perfect.  The magic in peeling them. Get a glass of water you can put your palm over.  Fill the glass halfway, drop in an egg and give it a few good shakes.  The egg will slip right out of the shell.

Excellent recipe. I didn't use the vinegar, but the salt in the boil and an ice bath to cool the eggs resulted in a perfect shell removal.

It seems to depend on the size of the eggs. I have bought  large that were actually medium. When I bought large...as the recipe states...it worked like a charm.

I've tried many techniques over the years, but this is my absolute favorite. The eggs are perfect every time! The one extra thing I always do is let the eggs get close to room temperature before I put them into the boiling water.
But as for the vinegar and salt...I'm a believer! :)

This method worked perfect!  I have a spotty history with hard boiled eggs, usually over cooked with the shell sticking but these peeled beautifully with a just done yolk!  Thanks!

Definitely worked well. Only three eggs out of two dozen stuck to the shell. May have been because I couldn't fit quite all of the eggs on one layer. Four or five were stacked on top of the others, but I don't know if that actually makes any difference or not. There was only one egg which cracked, and there was no leakage of the white at all! I've used salt before, but never vinegar, so I think that did make a difference. Did not notice that the vinegar affected the flavor. Yolks are beautifully yellow.

Perfect!  I've made hard-boiled eggs many different ways and tried lots of other tricks to get them to peel easily.  This worked!  All of my eggs peeled quickly, effortlessly, and not one of them stuck to the shell!  I'm sorry you lost a night of sleep, but it was a benefit to the rest of us.  Thanks, Ken.

Do not question or alter this!  It is truly a perfect method for achieving perfectly cooked, easy to peel eggs.  I had tried many recommended methods over the years and none of them worked like Ken’s method.  After a particularly frustrating bout making deviled eggs a couple of years ago, in which it appeared the shells had been “chewed” off of the whites, I found this method and haven’t looked back.  The shells slide off easily, even after several days of refrigeration, and the yolks are perfectly cooked.  Thanks, Ken, for sharing the results of your efforts and research! ??

Let's talk about a simple concept called "Thermal Shock".  This recipe is thoroughly sound in design. The salt and vinegar will penetrate the shell and loosen the skin from the egg, making peeling a breeze. Especially if you use the "end peel and blow through" method of peeling eggs. This recipe is PROPERLY EXECUTED by putting the eggs in the water-salt-vinegar mixture, bring to a rolling boil, then remove from heat. Cover and let sit for 15 minutes, then immerse in ice water or cold running water for 10 min.

Tried this method and as soon as I put the eggs into the boiling water the shell cracked and the whites oozed out.   The eggs were at almost room temp.  Guessing they were still too cool and this caused the shell to crack.  They did however peel easily but part of the egg white was missing at the end due to the oozing out.
will go back to my old method ...

Only item, and this isn't a criticism of the recipe per se, is I'm having trouble not cracking the eggs in the transfer from carton to pot to cooling basin. Any thoughts?

The recipe itself is awesome, great yolk texture and great flavor!

My family loves deviled eggs. My mother taught me how to make them when I was a little girl, and she explained that it is necessary to always use old eggs so the shells don't stick to the whites when you peel the eggs. Otherwise, as has happened to me, you can get very dilapidated-looking eggs for deviling or salads. I tried this recipe with fresh eggs and the eggs peeled perfectly. They really are perfect eggs! Mine took 17 MINUTES to cook (not 14 minutes as stated in the recipe), the amount of time they usually take to cook with the eggs that I have in my location. I noticed that some reviews stated that the actual cooking time was 10 MINUTES, which suggest that there is a wide variation in eggs and cooking times

I don't know whether adding the salt and vinegar actually does anything that wouldn't have happened without them. (I've seen a lot of differing comments about it in the reviews). I do know that I don't know anything about cooking eggs and by following the recipe exactly they came out perfectly! That's good enough for me. :) Thanks Ken!

I have tried every recipe in the book to get fresh eggs to peel  -- Mom's old adage about week-old eggs is true -- but finally this one works with fresh ones. I don't know if it's the salt , the vinegar or the cold bath (I have tried all three in different combinations) and don't care.  Together, IT WORKS!!

I followed directions but used large eggs in high altitude so they were undercooked. Need to remember that for the future. Ate one anyway. It was okay.

My mothers method makes perfect eggs everytime. No salt or Vinegar needed. Place eggs in pan and cover with water. Place on stove, heat until water begins to boil moderately. Cover and shut off burner. Leave covered for 12 minutes then immerse in cold water. Eggs will peel easily and the yolks will be perfect without the green tint.

I raise my own chickens, so my eggs are always hard to peel. These peeled perfectly and were done to perfection.  Oddly though, it made all the brown eggs lose their color and they all came out white!

I agree with the majority.  I follow the timing of the recipe very closely and eyeball the vinegar, salt, and water making sure there is enough to cover the eggs by about an inch.  So easy and they do come out perfect.

I seriously could not understand how every time I attempted to hard boiled eggs through trying different recipes and practicing over and over my eggs came out under cooked EVERY TIME. I vowed that if this recipe didn't work that I would never attempt to hard cook an egg again. lol Ken I thank you for having a simple recipe that makes perfect hard boiled eggs. They are perfect!

I like to put hardboiled eggs in my salad, so it matters how easy they are to peel and how bright the whites and yolk are.  Finally I've made perfect hardboiled eggs! I've tried other methods (boiling without vinegar and also baking) but the shell is hard to remove, the white isn't as bright and the yolk gets greenish. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe does work! Without the vinegar and salt there will be graying of the yolk. The ice water plunge shrinks the membrane and allows it to peel away from the white easily. I did have to lengthen my boiling time to 20 mins. Also, for those having difficulties with cracking as they enter the water, use a large tablespoon to gently lower the cold eggs into the boiling water. Be sure to guide them with the spoon all the way to the bottom! No need to allow them to reach room temperature before boiling.

This works most of the time for nicely cooked, easy to peel eggs. The trick for me seems to be following directions precisely. Whenever I don't, they are not as good.

The eggs were well cooked, but most of them were VERY hard to shell. Out of 12 I only had 2 that came out perfect. However, that might have more to do with the freshness of the eggs than the recipe.

Ken, with 40+ yrs of cooking and many first time failed attempts, this 'first' a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y worked for me . I halved the amount for 4 eggs, allowed them to come to room temp. Had one egg(slightly) crack, though did not result with egg whites floating about. Timed them at 15 minutes, shells easily came off, cooked through and no ring bling.  
The next time I can't sleep, kitchen and fame, here I come. lol Thx!

The recipe is for room temperature large eggs. Yolks are creamy with no grey or green rings. Whites are silky and firm, not rubbery. Perfect is the right word, Ken. Thanks!
Update: I used room temp. eggs this time and one still broke. Eggs are cooked perfectly and easy-peel, but I've NEVER broken an egg with my old tried and true method. Sorry, I had to remove a star.

Tonight was my first time making hard boiled eggs! I avoided this recipe due to the stench of sulfur hard boiled eggs can produce. I didn't measure anything, just boiled water and added some vinegar and salt to the mix. I didn't have any ice so I just added the eggs to a bowl of cold water and they came out perfectly! I ended up making deviled eggs, that's how fresh the yolks were! Also happy to report that there was no stinky smell!

I'm giving the recipe 3 stars rather than 5 simply because this recipe is more complicated than it needs to be.  Neither salt,nor vinegar makes eggs easier to peel. Adding either is not needed. Salt raises the boiling point of water which is useless for boiled eggs. Vinegar will help the insides of CRACKED eggs from leaking out; but if the eggs aren't cracked then the vinegar is useless. If you do add vinegar and have eggs crack, the cracked eggs will have a vinegar taste to them.  As for the cooking instructions, I dont agree.  The recipe states to 'boil gently'.  Well, boiling is what causes eggs to crack, even a 'gentle' boil will cause the eggs to move enough to tap one another and cracking occurs.

Great method.
 
One very important step to prevent eggs from cracking. Take eggs out of fridge for an hour or more to get the chill out of them. ///
When water boils - add salt and vinegar, remove from heat and add eggs on at a time, then return to very slow simmer - NOT BOIL. ///

BTW - I buy my eggs from a poultry farm - super fresh. So the idea of using older eggs makes no sense.

Gave it 2 stars because 2 out of 4 eggs cracked and were unusable. Keeping to cold water first, less waste. Did adjust recipe beforehand.

This just didn't work for me.  Eggs did not peel easily and a weird brown foam-type "stuff" filled the pan.

What is new to me is the vinegar:  with this, a cracked egg does not leak, at least mine didn't.  I do crack one or two accidentally putting them in the hot water.  I came across this while trying to find out WHY with vinegar, an egg does not leak.  So far, no luck on the search.

Thanks again.

GO SAINTS!!:)

I'm in my sixties and have been boiling eggs for years.  But I'm always game for anything new and better.  I tripled the recipe for 2 dozen (room temp.) eggs.  Used a slotted spoon to lower 2 at a time into the boiling water.  Did everything as directed and my eggs came out perfect.  To save on dishes, I carefully poured out the boiled water until most of it was gone, then immediately ran COLD faucet water over the eggs.  Then I added a lot of ice cubes and let it sit.  After 20 minutes, I peeled about 12 eggs and EVERY one of them peeled perfect.  And these were very fresh eggs to begin with. With so many fresh eggs at Eastertime, it becomes almost impossible not to have batches that just won't peel (even for the pros).  I've always done the shocking with cold water and ice and it didn't always work.  THIS DID!  I don't feel I need this method for year round since I usually don't boil fresh eggs.  But it certainly is GREAT for big batches and when using FRESH eggs.  Great job Ken, I'm converted.  UPDATE:  Am convinced that maybe the grayish ring around the yolk may be a sign of an older egg.  Boiled 2 dozen and found 2 eggs with it.  And the egg companies have been found to sneak a few in here and there.  This cooking process didn't eliminate that . . .BUT it works for everything else.

Perfect every-time! And I never do anything the way I'm supposed to....I used 6-8 eggs, put them in a pot added enough water to cover them, added whatever vinegar I had left in the 16 0z botttle..about a 1/2 inch from the bottom of the bottle...added some salt...just opened the container and poured a little in, I guess about a tablespoon or so. Then I forgot to time it...asked myself, "How long have these been on?" Answered myself (lol) "about 4 minutes or so"...so I gave them ten minutes on the timer , took them out- never bothering to check for doneness, ran them under cool water and left them in a container of cool water for probably 15 minutes- give or take a few. 
They peeled easily and were cooked exactly the ways Ken's picture shows....I couldn't mess them up - even with all of my carelessness.

Thanks Ken! I have used your method several times- Perfect!

I followed this recipe to the letter and made sure the eggs were room temperature before adding them to the boiling water.  No eggs exploded.  Eggs peeled beautifully both immediately after cooling in ice water and after sitting in the fridge overnight.  I am very pleased with this recipe!

Every time I use this recipe my eggs turn out perfect.  And I have used this on very fresh eggs from our farm that are only 1 day old.  They never stick to the shell when I use this recipe so I have to believe it works!  In fact, we give our customers this recipe with their eggs so they can boil them w/out troubles.  Yes, you could use store bought old eggs and not need the vinegar, but why do that when you can use perfectly fresh farm eggs and still have awesome boiled eggs. I also think putting them in the ice bath right after seems to help.  Thanks Ken for putting this recipe out.  It works great for us.

For me, my batch worked out perfectly!! It was a little difficult to peel, but that's because I'm not very good at peeling. The eggs didn't crack either. If you want a topping, you can put some salt on the egg after you've peeled. Don't skip the ice water part! It helps you peel a lot better. Trust me. I didn't do it the first time, but  the second time was fabulous. I definitely L-O-V-E-D, loved it! you should give it a shot!

Not perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly and the yolks weren't all the way hard boiled.  I wanted to try something new to see if it made for a better hard boiled egg, but this recipe was not successful.

This is how it's done! I never struggle with eggs anymore. The ice water at the end really nails it. I suggest bringing eggs closer to room temp before putting in the water so they don't crack/explode, but I think a little bit of a cold/hot shock helps with the magic of this recipe so I try to have them at least a bit cool before gently lowering into the pot with a slotted spoon. :) Perfect!

Great recipe/how-to for hard boil eggs. After reading all the reviews I had to try this method and I definitely made the easiest to peel eggs I have ever made and perfect for pretty deviled eggs. I usually only get half of my batch of eggs peeled well enough to make deviled eggs but this time all but one peeled perfectly! Thanks Ken

I think, it's vinegar and salt that is making the eggs peel better. I've tried all sorts of different ways to hard boil fresh eggs and nothing ever worked and could never get the shell off without tearing up the egg..... until today. Two of the eggs I boiled with this recipe were laid just yesterday. They peeled perfectly. Thanks,Ken!

Well, I tried this tonight and used the recalculated to two eggs. The water would not come close to covering the eggs, so had to add more water.  I did not add more salt or vinegar, maybe I should have?  Will give it another shot later this week and try it with more eggs this time.  Is it something wrong with our eggs now a days as I never use to have these problems.  My hard boiled eggs take me several minutes of pain staking removal and I end up with 3/4 of an egg :(

This is the best, easiest way to make perfect hard-boiled eggs.  I've made them twice so far, and there is no dark ring around the yolk.  The eggs are beautiful.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  This is how I will always make my hard-boiled eggs from now on.  Yummy!

Ken,

As an SEO content writer online, I am used to (and pretty good at) researching things. So glad I found your wonderful directions!

I have used this recipe dozens of times, and it works perfectly!

Thanks,

I wonder if different sizes of eggs contribute to different results, more than age of eggs or cage free/commercial, etc. I use only "AA Large" at room temp now and this recipe is perfect. My main problem was always peeling the eggs. These slide out of the shell and that alone deserves 5 stars. Now the yolk is also centered and I have no cracked eggs. I love being able to tell at a glance which are hard boiled - I used cider vinegar and they are slightly tan. I rarely had rubbery eggs or discolored yolks, but I have none of that. Wow, I am a Ken's Eggs convert. Thanks Ken.

For those having trouble with peeling, make sure your water comes to a full boil, or the white will be too soft and stick to the shell. The yolk should be a pale yellow when done, not still orange, especially if you plan to make deviled eggs.

These came out PERFECT! No green ring from overcooking, no undercooked yolk - just perfect. I've tried and failed at trying to cook them so many other ways. I wasted about a dozen Saturday baking them in the oven in a muffin pan (which is apparently the popular way now) and ended up with brown spots on the egg white. Now I've found a better way! Thanks Ken.

This worked perfectly!  I brought the eggs to room temperature first.  In fact, several of my eggs were cracked before I cooked them - discovered this as I was lowering them into the water in a slatted spoon.  But I pulled them out and VERY SLOWLY lowered them in(kinda like lowering yourself gingerly into a hot tub...) and only one of them leaked a little!  All of them were perfectly cooked and good to use for deviled eggs.

Thank you Ken, you saved Easter!   The eggs are really perfect and I am so grateful.  I tried many different way including baking in the oven, nothing worked and the shells still stuck.  With your recipe they slip right off.  Thank ou, thank you!

Thanks! The only problem with this recipe is once the water is boiling the eggs(even when gently lowered into the water) cracked, so I had to let the water cool down a bit before putting them in. Besides that, this  worked well once they were cooked and peeled very well!

OMG!  I've NEVER been able to make hard-boiled eggs that would peel easily! This worked like a charm!  They practically peeled themselves!  I didn't have distilled white vinegar, so I used some apple cider vinegar instead and it worked just fine!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  I'll never have trouble again!  THANK YOU!!!

the key to perfect hard boiled eggs is vinegar!  I have tried very old eggs, starting with hot water, starting with cold water, cover and let sit, let cook on rolling boil.  They all stick!!!   This recipe works!

My first review after several years of allrecipes use is for hard boiled eggs.  I've just never been moved to actually rate a recipe until now.  This has changed my life!  Thank you Ken, for this brilliant bit of information! We raise chickens, so eggs are a primary source of protein in our house.  Everyone knows the trouble with hard boiling farm fresh eggs right?  They are MISERABLE to peel, so miserable that I avoided boiling them at all if I could.  Not this batch though, I peeled 6 eggs right in a row, with no struggle at all, and without a single gouge in any of the eggs.  They were, well.... PERFECT! Amazing.

Ok I cannot tell you how many times I have FAILED making hard boiled eggs. I decided I would give it one more try tonight and guess what....PERFECTION I am so excited I think I might have even cried a little. My daughter who has seen my failures and makes fun of me for it on a regular basis is oh so proud of me. We were dancing in the living room. LOL Thank you so much!!

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect- no green yolk and the shell slides right off!

tip- I put the eggs in warm water as I bring the pot to a boil.  If you put cold eggs in the boiling water they will crack.  The warm water transition prevents this from happening

I gave this a 3 because while it does make great hard boiled eggs, it is terrible for eggs you will dye!

The vinegar or salt must break down the outer shell, so that trying to dye them the eggs look strange and some of the dyed egg shells slough off. 

I will use this recipe if I ever boil eggs, but will sadly have to find another recipe to boil eggs when I wish to dye them (which is most often the case for us...)

I have used this method many times with perfect success every time.  I live at over 6,000 foot altitude so had to increase the cooking time to just 15 mins and they are perfect.  I tried putting the eggs in the pot straight out of the fridge, brought up to boiling, lowered the heat and cooked for 15 mins...still came out excellent.  Thanks, Ken!!

This worked GREAT!  I split a 18 pack carton of eggs & did 1/2 with this recipe & 1/2 with plain water and Ken's recipe was SO much easier to peal than the plain ones.  When done, I dumped most of the water out & ran cold water in the pan to cool them off just a little before transferring them to a bowl of ice & water for 20 min & then into the fridge.  As other reviewers have said, older eggs are better, but testing the same cartoon of eggs proved this one to me. I also had the eggs at room temperature.  And YES, cooking 14 (actually 15 minutes) worked perfectly for me, but NO you probably don't have to boil them this long if you're closer to sea level.  I now live at a 7000 ft elevation after 10 years in Seattle at a 500 ft elevation.  I made a lot of soft boiled/not fully cooked yolked eggs when I first moved & tried to make them here just like I had before.

By far the BEST hardboiled egg method/recipe. The only thing I can add that Ken didn't is that you NEED to let your eggs get to room temp before you put them into the water.

This is by far the best way to boil eggs.  The shell peels off so easy with no tearing of the egg.  The only change I made was that I only boil the eggs for 12 min.

Perfect just as written! 

Also works for soft boiled, just boil them about 5-6 minutes and toss them in an ice water bath to stop the cooking.  You have to cut the top off the soft boiled by popping them with a sharp knife and slide a spoon next to the shell and they pop right out!

I rated these eggs kinda low, because when I made them half of them broke. I made them just how you said and even used a spoon to carefully lower them into the boiling water. Maybe the eggs need to be at room temp. or put the eggs in before boiling. Has anyone else had this problem. Eggs still came out ok and I was able to use them because I was using them for potato salad. I will try again either bringing eggs to room temp. first or putting the eggs in before boiling the water. Hope this fixes my problem. Thanks anyways. I will let you know how they come out  nextime I try.

I can't believe I'm writing a review for hard boiled eggs :) but seriously, they turned out perfect. Easy to peel, perfectly colored. Thank you Ken!

Ken isn't kidding.....these ARE perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the shells pretty much slid right off the eggs.  It was unbelievable!  I used very fresh (purchased yesterday) extra large eggs, and boiled them for 17 minutes. Amazing!

Used a dozen rather than 8 eggs with the ingredients but other than that, followed instructions exactly.  The eggs were incredibly easy to peel...the shells just slid right off and they were cooked perfectly!!!  Thanks for the tips:)

I made these for Easter my family said they were great, I did exactly what the directions said, they were perfect.  The yolk came out so yellow the egg when cut in half looked very good, I've used other recipies sometimes they work sometimes they don't and never has the yolk looked so yellow, this is the only recipe I will use for hard boiled eggs.    Thanks for sharing.

These came out perfect! I would suggest dropping the eggs in the boiling water with a slotted spoon to avoid cracking in which I learned the hard way. I always overcook my hard boiled eggs and these came out with a perfectly cooked yolk and were easy to peel.

Beautiful clean whites and nice and bright yolks!  NO GREENISH-GRAY YOLKS!  Unfortunately, I was using fresh eggs, so they were hard to peel, which is typical for fresh eggs.  I used them in my macaroni salad.

I used 1 dozen eggs, just change the servings from 8 to 12 and follow directions.  These are by far the BEST HARD BOILED EGGS.  I had absolutely no problem peeling them. I've already eaten 2 so I guess the Easter Bunny will only be able to leave 10!! Highly suggested!

I've always had trouble getting eggs to peel easily.  I've tried several different traditional methods, used older eggs, with or without the ice water, you name it.

I tried this formula and put 9 eggs in because I always have one or two that have chunks rip off with the shell.  It turns out there was no need----all 9 turned out pretty as a magazine photo.  Not one split, gouged or cracked.  The yolks were pure creamy yellow.  The shells came off pretty easily.  I didn't have to fight them like I normally had to before.

This is already on my hard drive.  It's a keeper.

Love the recipe!  Worked really well, but a lot of my eggs broke when I put them in the water even though I was using a spoon to lay them in gently.

Wow!!!  This is the first time I have had my hard boiled eggs come out so well - without the dark yolk coloring which looks terrible!  I followed the directions with the salt and vinegar and the cold water.  I had 4 dozen eggs to cook so I did a little at a time. - using the same pot of water and it was fine. 
Thanks Ken!

I love this recipe, but I have trouble preventing the eggs cracking when I put them in the water. I thought it could be because they were too cold when I put them in the water.

I've been to the mountain and I sees the light! The best eggs I've ever turning into hard boiled!! Followed the recipe as written for a potato salad I'm putting together. I've read and done so many things to get perfection but this has worked the best by far. The last one I tried was Alton Brown's "Steaming" method. I could not achieve the repeated results that I'm sure I'll get from Ken's "recipe". Mahalo, Dude!

I have made Ken's eggs many times before.  My daughter and I did an "eggs-periment" this morning.  She made hers the old fashioned way with just boiling water.  I made mine according to the recipe.  Both looked great when cut open.  The whites of hers were all pimply and dimply and she lost about 1/4 her egg whites.  Mine (I mean Ken's) were perfect inside and out.  Hands down the "perfect eggs".  :)

I always had the hardest time peeling the shell off of the eggs. I tried this and it was perfect. I will always use this method from now on when hard boiling eggs. The cook time was perfect as well. The eggs turned out fabulous. Thank you.

This method works, not perfect, but still pretty good.  I had only one egg shell out of a dozen that stuck to the shell and tore - perhaps, it's the cook?  I followed the method exactly as written.

I love this boiled egg recipe. It is perfect, perfect perfect. I have never boiled eggs that would peel and the shells almost fall off by themselves when I start to peel them and the eggs are not over cooked or under cooked. They are PERFECT just as Ken say. Thank you Ken!

Ken's right. The eggs came out perfect! I added a splash more vinegar because I haven't had any luck in the past making hard boiled eggs. Shells practically came off by themselves. Thanks very much for this recipe.  This is one of my "cooking basics" for good.

This recipe does work. I don't usually like to hassle with extra work for boiling eggs but the results make it worth it. The only change I made was that in order to avoid worrying about cracking the eggs I place them in the cold water solution (rather than dropping them into boiling water) and then bring them up to the gentle boil and then time it for 14 minutes and do the cold water bath. I also end up cooking 18 eggs (that number fits in my large pot) at a time to save effort in doing a larger number of batches. I use the same amounts of water, salt, and vinegar in the recipe just boil more eggs at a time. Thanks for sharing this!

Ken, you did an excellent job researching this one. For years I have been struggling with peeling eggs. I even increased the batch. I used a 2 quart pan. Instead of 8 cups of water, I used 14 cups. I used one half cup of vinegar instead of a quarter cup. Two tablespoons of salt. 16 eggs instead of 8. Followed the same boiling time and cooling time. I used another bowl with water and ice for cooling down the eggs. When I peeled them, the shells practically fell off. So very easy. This is my method for now on. Thanks SBC  Grand Rapids,MI

Ken's method IS perfect.  Tried it last night and the shells came off without any struggle, the yolks were a beautiful yellow (not a hint of that awful gray) and they were cooked to a perfect texture.  Not rubbery or dry.

Thanks so much for posting this! I can't believe how easily the eggs peeled and that they were all perfectly cooked. I'll be making hardboiled eggs more often now that I have this easy method :)

Absolutely perfect!   The ice water bath helps keep the egg yolks from turning gray around the edge.  Peeling the eggs was a breeze using this method.  Thanks, Ken!

I have seen this reviewed several times and saved it to my recipe box.  I decided to make devilled eggs tonight, so I went straight for this recipe.  It worked like a charm, and I will use this method from now on.  No more using most of my ruined eggs to make egg salad!

I've only used this recipe once, so I can't say with total confidence it makes the eggs easier to peel.  I did have an easier time of peeling my eggs than I do sometimes, but the age of the eggs plays into how hard to easy the peeling process is.    The cooking process wasn't any faster/easier than my usual way of putting the eggs in cold water, bringing to a boil then removing from heat and sitting in the boiled water for 15-17 minutes.  But it also wasn't any harder either, and the eggs were all fully cooked!

Yeah, these were perfect.  Honestly, my issue with hard boiled eggs has always been cooking time.  14 minutes is the magic number.

These are perfect! I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who said it was all due to the ice bath- I have always done the ice bath and still had difficulty with the shells. Done this way, the shells literally slipped right off. Never again will I do them any other way. Thank you, thank you!

WOW!!  What a great tip.  I will no longer fret about making deviled or boiled eggs again.  The shells practically fall off the eggs.  Thank you for offering this.  I will definitely be using this to boil eggs from now on.

These really did come out perfect. I tested this with both white and brown eggs. I wouldn't recommend using the brown as they were harder to peel, but the white just slid right out of their shells like magic.

I don't care why this works or what each ingredient does - all I care about is it worked!  I've never had such perfect eggs!!!  The last 2 years we haven't even been able to peel our eggs on Easter because they just crumble in our hands.  This Easter they were perfect so, Ken, thanks for sharing your sleepless night with us!

We didn't love these. I think I need to adjust the ingredients a bit. I am not picky at all, and I thought they were gross. I am going to work on this recipe though, because I think it could be really yummy!

This worked out well except I had a few eggs that cracked as soon as they were put gently into the water.  Next time I will start out with the eggs at room temperature so it is not such a temperature difference when added to the boiling water.

This were fairly easy to peel, but I didn't find them much easier than using regular water and plunging them into cold water immediately. I wonder what the vinegar and salt really accomplish.

Ok... I came into this pretty skeptical.  I've always had mixed results with boiled eggs.  The best tip I ever got was the ice water bath after boiling, but that still didn't solve the problem of how long to cook, or eliminate that green ring around the yolk.  As I made these, I kept thinking to myself "I can't believe I'm actually dirtying measuring cups for boiled eggs!"  I have no clue what role the vinegar or salt plays in this, but it creates perfect, and I mean PERFECT eggs.  I only had one tiny crack in one egg.  Beautiful.  Now I'm not afraid to bring deviled eggs to a party anymore!  Thanks Ken.

Is there a better word than perfect???  No size was specified, and we can only get XL eggs at the Carlisle, PA Commissary so I let them go for 18 min.  Shells slipped right off leaving a perfect egg with no dings or dents!

Been hard boiling eggs for 40 years and this time they actually did come out PERFECT!  I used a slotted spoon to lower the eggs into the boiling water and followed the recipe to the letter.  I used fresh eggs and the shell came right off and the yellow was yellow and didn't have that ugly green around the egde.  Thank you Ken ... now you can go back to sleep!

DELICIOUS!!! And very easy to peel.  Only thing was that 2 of my eggs cracked, and I think it was because it got to be a pretty rough boil before I turned the heat down.  Also, there was some silly-string lookin' stuff that came out of the eggs... was that normal?

I followed LuckyLeprechaun's advice and did not add salt or vinegar (not needed), just simply submerged the eggs in ice water after they boiled (my large eggs took 16 minutes) & they were perfect!  I've tried the method of adding eggs to cold water, bringing it to a boil, turning it off & leaving it covered on a cold burner for a set period of time & I've never had them turn out.  These were perfect & just in time for Easter!!!  I'm sure the recipe as written produces a wonderful hard boiled egg but it is the method, not the additional ingredients.

I've tried several different methods but this is the first to create perfect, easy-to-peel, green-free eggs!!  As one user suggested, I let the eggs rest at room-temp for 5 mins before putting into the boiling water gently with a slotted spoon.  Thanks Ken!

This recipe was o.k.  I have not necessarily had a hard time with peeling eggs in the past but thought I'd try a different technique just for fun.  I think the secret is in the cold water bath, not the rest, as some other reviewers have stated.  Also, my yolks were still soft and that isn't appealing to me at all.  They weren't green though so that was a plus.  I followed the directions exactly.  Will go back to my old method again.  Thanks for sharing Ken.

Don't add your eggs to boiling water straight from the frig.  Our eggs cracked when added to the water because the temperature difference between the boiling water and the eggs was too much.  Better to either let them come to room temp or add before the boil.  Also the water didn't cover the eggs since my pan was too big. I had to add extra water.  I don't think the vinegar actually does anything either.  Everything I've read says  fresh eggs are harder to peel.

I have tried other recipes for hard boiled eggs that come out without the green hue. This is hands down the perfect recipe! I would not agree that the cold water is why the eggs peel so well, that was tried before and not successful. I am not sure how it all works, but it does and I will be making deviled eggs today using this method!

Absolutely FANTASTIC!! I'm telling everyone I know about this recipe :) I had a couple eggs crack but I think it's from minute cracks I didn't see. Even the cracked eggs peeled perfectly. Don't know what the negative reviewer did wrong but I'm VERY pleased with the results. THANKS for sharing!!

Wow!! When I saw this recipe I thought "a recipe for hard boiled eggs?"  I decided to try it and it really does produce perfect eggs.  The shells nearly undress themselves with no battle of the membrane. Finally, a way to get hard boiled eggs without craters.  I just finished a great egg salad wrap made on Joseph's soft flour tortilla with Flax, Oat bran, and Whole wheat flour (great for fiber and tastes fantastic), with yolks almost creamy.  This my first time reviewing a recipe, though my bookmarks are filled with them. Thank you Ken, you've solved the mystery and mastery of the egg.

I have tried everything!  The ONLY way I get perfect HB eggs is to use an electric egg cooker.  Plus the ice vinegar/water bath.  I'd venture to guess that the difference in timing (10 mins vs 15 mins) could be due to altitude.

I read somewhere, if you want a perfectly centered egg yolk for deviled eggs. Turn the egg on it's side in the carton for a day or so, before you boil it. The yolk will be perfectly centered.
