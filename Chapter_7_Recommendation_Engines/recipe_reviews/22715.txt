THe only issue wth this is that itis not just whiskey you put in the shot glass....You need to pu half whiskey(jameson) and half bailey's cream. When you drop it in it starts to curddle and rise which is the bomb effect...then you drink as fast as possible before it spills on you and curddles. Not for the squimish....

The other reviews are right in the fact that this recipe is missing Irish cream liquer but you don't put it in the shot glass with the wiskey. You put it in with the beer then drop the wiskey. The wiskey is what makes the cream curddle. Friend owns a bar and we drank a -load of these on St. Patty's Day. Also you gotta use Guiness. It's the best.

This really isn't a Car Bomb without the Bailey's Irish Cream in the shot glass....that's why you are supposed to chug them before they curdle. Yummy!

As others have said, you need to add the Bailey's Irish Cream as well. Also, careful not to swallow the shot glass? Really? That would take some talent...

this is so good, but you have to put the Jameson and Baileys in the shot glass together. Only way to do it!

A trick is to put the Bailey's Irish cream in a shot glass with Jameson and drop it in a glass of Guiness with a splash of vanilla schnapps. Then drink it as fast as possiblr brfore it curdles. Tastes just like chocolate milk.

Hubby loved it, though, he did point out (much like every other reviewer), that this isn't truly an Irish car bomb b/c there is no Bailey's in it. He also said that there is a name for this, but he couldn't remember it (too much Irish whiskey and beer perhaps, lol???) He did enjoy it though, and said that he would drink it again! Thanks for sharing. :)
