Only change I made was to use butter rather than margarine.  Dough game out too dry.  Added 1/4 Cup water.  I also cut the bake time down to 10 minutes. I've now completed the first batch and I must say these are tasty.  Enjoy

I love this recipe, I have made it with and without the coconut, with and without apricots. I use a spoon size scoop and the cookies melt out and become deliciously chewy.
