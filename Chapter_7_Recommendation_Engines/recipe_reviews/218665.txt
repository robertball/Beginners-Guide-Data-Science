I did not try this particular recipe, but ate a very similar one at a Punic.  It had a topping of brown sugar and chopped pecans  and was scrumptious.

This is amazing and addictive! The only change I made was using real sugar instead of the substitute. It took a lot of self control not to sit down with a spoon and just chow down on the cream. It was such a wonderful combination with the grapes too, so refreshing. I have a lot of the cream leftover, I didn't have enough grapes for that much. I also tried some sprinkled with Oreo crumbs (no grapes), delicious! I think this cream is very versatile, I can see it working beautifully with strawberries, or pretty much any other fruit. I think it will be great for non-fruit things too. It is *that* good. Thank you so much for sharing!!

I modified for "what's-on-hand." I mixed a 6-oz carton of NSA flavored yogurt (Mango-pineapple-passion fruit flavor) & a 8-oz block of neufchatel cheese till smooth, then added a 8-oz carton of whipped topping and sweetener equal to about 1/4 cup (sugar equivalent). I omited the flavor since the yogurt already had it. I used a little over 3# of grapes; could have held more if you want to stretch the "sauce." YUM!!!
