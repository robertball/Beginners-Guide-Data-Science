I am a novice at pickling. This recipe is awesome, it is easy and quick. The pickles came out delicious, it is not too vinegary and the spices give it a full and complex satisfaction to the taste buds.  This beats the hell of all the pickles I ever bought.  I am never buying pickles again. Thank you very much Chef John.

This was my first year trying to make pickles. This recipe is FANTASTIC! These are the most delicious bread and butter pickles I've ever had. If you're worried about the jalapenos, DON'T. They are perfect , as is. Don't change a thing.

I substituted raw Turbinado sugar for processed granulated sugar, but followed the rest of the recipe 100%.  Great pickles, best ever for me.  This is definitely a keeper.

Taste just like grandmas. I will totally make this again. Next time I will add more jalape√±os for my husband. He likes them with a strong kick. Me, I hate spivey but this was great flavor without the heat.

It was my first time making bread and butter pickles.  Unfortunately I overcooked the pickles (better luck next time).  But for those that survived, I kept them in the fridge a few days and they turned out awesome!  Thanks John.  I'll try again while I can still get cucumbers at the farmers market.

I've never made "quick" pickles before, and I'm so glad I found this recipe!  It's so easy to follow, not a lot of steps and uses basic pickling ingredients.  I would advise to watch the video first though, I think it is helpful with explanations for the "why" of some of the steps.  The flavors come together perfectly and the end result are pickles that are sweet with a touch of spice,  have a bit of a crunch and look amazing.  These are so much better than store-bought!  We love these yummy pickles!!

I don't like cucumbers but I grew them in my garden so I could make pickles.  This recipe is very easy and I've been giving pickles to my neighbors and friends. Everyone loves them,  as do I!  Red jalapenos are difficult to find but I have a quart from last year's garden. I added some red pepper flakes for a little extra zip.

It was fun - it was easy - and everyone loves the pickles.  I did not use any peppers.  And, I could eat the pickles that evening.

The first time I over salted. The second time I followed the recipe and LOVED it. Changed my review from 3 to 5 stars. Now I will be picking all my cucumbers early when they are small enough to get pickled.  Really delicious, just measure.

I have made this several times and always get requests for more. I do one thing additional however prior to closing the jar, I put a whole Tabasco chili pepper in the jar. Then seal the jar and can it as normal. Over time the pepper will spread it's goodness throughout the jar of bread and butter pickles. It's not a lot of heat but rather a low heat at the back of the mouth.

Perfect balance of vinegar and sugar.  I‚Äôve added all kinds of other veggies too. I recommend only letting the salt sit for 2 hrs if you like crisp pickles.

Have made three batches of this recipe so far and planning on more. I have never canned before and this was an easy introduction. Everyone loved the flavors. I have made jars with the jalape√±os and in others substituted red bell peppers (1/2 pepper thinly sliced). The recipe mades 3 canned pint jars per batch.

Oh no! I usually love all of Chef John's recipes, but this one was terrible! I followed the directions to a T (except for cutting the recipe in half, and also using green jalapeno peppers rather than the red Fresno chilis), and they turned out awful. Wayyyy too much vinegar, that's pretty much all I tasted. They were not crisp at all either. What a disappointment and a waste of good cucs!

Delicious! Used a green jalepeno because that is all I had. The peppers were hot as hades but they did not make the pickles spicy. Be sure and cut your cucumbers a bit thicker (no less than 1/4 inch) to make them nice and crunchy. Can't wait to harvest more cukes and make this again!

This was our first attempt at pickling and they came out wonderful!  Love the sweet with a hint of spice!  They have amazingly good crunch as well.  Very easy, will definitely make again!

I have never pickled anything in my life but now I have made this recipe three times in one month. Twice for myself and once at the request of a friend who tasted them. This has to be one of the easiest things I have ever made and one of the best tasting. Better than any store bought B&B pickles I've tried. Will become a staple in my fridge. I cannot imagine not having a jar on hand. No changes at all, just great results!

This was my first attempt at pickles. I made it EXACTLY as written, and it turned out perfect. I actually have people that want to purchase jars of these from me. Didn't process these in a canner, I don't think they'll last that long.

Like others who made this recipe, I used thinly sliced red bell peppers and jalape√±os. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly. Crisp, sweet, delicious. Better than any store bought. Thanks Chef John!

Absolutely wonderful.  I didn‚Äôt have a red jalape√±os, so I used a red bell pepper for color and put in green jalape√±os.  I also couldn‚Äôt find one or two things of the ingredients and just threw it together accordingly.  They are sooo good!

Made the recipe earlier today per my husband‚Äôs request.  Although I love cukes, I was never much a pickle fan.  These turned out tasty, and tender-crisp as expected.  I did slice the cucumbers too thin, and will use thicker cuts next time.

This turned out quite good.  As John suggested in the video, leaving the pickles in longer enhances the flavor.  These were crips and flavorful.  I'm typically a dill pickle guy, but this was outstanding.

I was a little worried about the cloves in the recipe, but there wasn't too much.   I did use more onions than called for, but we love onions.  Perfect bread and butter pickles and loved by all.

Best pickles I've ever made. Simple and delish! Pickles came out crisp and not vinegary. The spices were just right. I doubled the recipe and it worked.  Have to be sure when changing the recipe you measure carefully. I'll be using this recipe for a long time.

My first attempt at making pickles and canning was a huge success! Everyone I‚Äôve shared these pickles with has loved them. My only change was that I substituted a pickling spice blend for the cloves and mustard seed. I also canned them instead of making refrigerator pickles. Delicious!

This is a great recipe. It reminds me of the bread and butter pickles my mom used to make. It also tastes pretty much like the relish my family loves. 
With the second batch I made I sliced the cucumber thinner and also added about 5 banana peppers (cause my neighbor had an abundance) and a whole onion. The peppers and onion were sliced thin also.  My family has been wanting burgers and hot dogs all week just so they can enjoy the pickles on top.  The next time I cook up a batch I may consider substituting the peppercorns for half the amount of ground pepper as a few times I bit into a peppercorn.

A little salty for me. I have an abundance of yellow sqaush, so I used that instead of cucumbers with a little piclkle crisp. Turned out good, I will cut the kosher salt way back next time.
Thanks.

Made these today. The only changes I made:
3 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and green jalapenos instead of red - English cukes instead of pickling (it's all we had at the local grocery).  Otherwise? Like SO many others have already stated: these are THE best bread and butter pickles I've ever had.  Without question, crispy, delicious and wonderful.  I'll never buy store bought B&B pickles again.

Awesome flavor!  Made a half recipe and followed exactly.  Ran out of white vinegar so used plain rice vinegar for about half of it.  Salted the cucumbers with about half the salt and don't think either made any difference. Used only 1 regular cucumber but may up to 1-1/2 to 2 next time. May heat cucumbers a little less next time just to see what that does texture-wise.  Tasty, easy recipe.

Great recipe and the execution keeps the pickles so crunchy. I only make one pint at a time scaling down to 12 servings. I use pickling or English cucumbers.  I don't use raw onions or jalapeno's but...I add dry onion flakes and crushed red pepper flakes. My only execution change is I toss the turmeric on the slices with the salt  while they sit in the fridge. That way my finished product doesn't look murky yellow.  I use granulated garlic to avoid purple garlic slices floating around. I don't know, it just turns me off.  So, after rinsing, I pack in the slices, get the brine super hot and pour it straight in the jar while removing any air pockets. Micro for a minute, cap and it seals itself.  I do add 1/2 t of whole coriander seed which I personally like.  Also because I don't use real sugar, I replace with less sugar sub as I don't like super sweet pickles .  Works great  if your living low carb or Keto. Thanks Chef John. Love the end results. Crunch!

I've never made pickles before so I tried to follow the recipe as it is. I had some problems with the amount of cucumbers. I didn't think I had two pounds of cucumbers so I used the serving size adjustment on Allrecipes to help me adjust the spices. I think I could have used more brine. I also thought they could have been sweeter. I have to believe I had too many cucumbers for the adjustment I made. Maybe it would be helpful if the recipe said "two pounds (about x number of cucumbers)" in the recipe. I'll have to watch that if I try this again.

I'm new to canning and pickling. My husband has never been a fan of bread and butter pickles because of the sweetness, but said these are very good. I reduced the amount of sugar by half for the recipe (taste preference). Also, I thought I had celery seed, but oops it was celery salt in my cupboard! With no celery on hand, I ended up using dill seed. The bread and butter pickles were still a little too sweet for us, but isn't this variation supposed to be sweet? Still delicious nonetheless! Thanks for an easy recipe to follow Chef John!

This was easy to use and also easy to adapt other ingredients into which I did. I added red peppers and more jalapenos both red and green and came out perfect..yum yum.

I made this as directed the first batch, with grand kids. It is very easy to put together, and kids measured, and poured ingredients. It was a fun project. Ages, 4,6,& 72. The best part, they learned where pickles came from. They hade some to take home, and enjoy there labor.    The next batch I altered ingredients, with different peppers. Slight difference in flavor, but we're very enjoyable.
