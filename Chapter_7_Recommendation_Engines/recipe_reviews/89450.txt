i am the poster of this recipe, and when i posted it i called for FAR more chili powder than 1 teaspoon.  It should be more like 4-5 Tablespoons depending on how spicy you want it.  I hope that this helps future people who attempt this recipe.

Much too bland for my taste. I had to add salt, pepper, garlic, more tomato sauce and chili powder to the skillet mixture before baking to bring it up to a 4-star recipe.

We fry the meat with onion and garlic, and use spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. We also use sliced cheese instead of cheddar. It is a family favorite.

Extra easy to make, minimal ingredients.  I doubled the Chili Powder and used Ground Turkey.  My Son(18)thought it was great, too bland for my taste, though.

As is very bland. However, great base to start with. 2nd time, I omitted the chili powder and used 1 packet of beef stew seasoning. I covered the whole thing with mashed potatoes and then baked. It was a big hit.

This was just too bland.  I used 2 cans of tomato sauce and also added salt, pepper, and garlic.  Sadly it didn't help.  It was boring.

This was very good although it needed more tomato sauce. I topped it with French fried onions instead of cheese.
