My husband raved and raved about this dessert, and he's not big on desserts.  The only things I did different is I increased the blackberries to 8 cups and added about 1/2 cup more of flour while it was cooking, this filled the 9 x 13 pan better and made it set up better, less runny.

very good!  I didn't change a thing, except there wasn't enough blackberry mixture to fit a 9x13 pan, so I used a 7x11.  Also didn't have oats on hand, and it was fine without.  Took this to a group gathering, and none was left!

This is my go to cobbler recipe. I now omit the first 4 ingredients and use any of my home canned pie fillings. I usually make make 1.5 recipes for a 9x13 pan because we love plenty of topping. This is a very easy recipe, I always have all the ingredients on hand and can throw it together last minute.

I wanted to use up some frozen mixed berries so gave this a try. Delicious!  Tasted like fresh berries, and the topping is a perfect crunch. Warm a piece in the microwave, add vanilla ice cream and everyone will be happy. I love my blackberry pie, but this is so easy and tasty.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but for one thing. I didn’t add the pecans since this was for a gathering. I didn’t want to risk anyone having a nut allergy.

I made it, but made a few adjustments.  I didn't add the water to the topping for I like a crumbly crust.  That was great!   I also used frozen berries using about 6 cups to compensate.
