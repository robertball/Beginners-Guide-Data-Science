A  crunchy, tasty, healthy snack- once you get it right... It took a few tries at this recipe to get it right, though... Got best results by: reducing the amount of salt to 1 1/2 tsp divided; cutting the amount of olive oil down to 2 1/2 tbs; reducing the oven temperature to 375 on the convection roast setting, for  no more than 25-30 minutes, mixing the chickpeas every 10 minutes; adding whole cumin seeds ( to taste); and adding a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. Make sure you keep a close watch on the mixture and remove as soon as you hear the sound of the peas rattling on the pans as you mix them. You'll notice the difference from the sound they make after the 10 and 20 minute mixes. It's worth the effort for this addictive snack!

Addicted to these! Have made it 3 times messing with amount of spices. I'm trying to do a no gluten, carb cleanse and looking for healthy all natural snacks, so this was a great find. I definitely add more salt, but cooking wise time, this has made the most crunchy ones I have tried. LOVE!

Tasty-but-burnt. The cooking time was way off for my oven.  15min stir, 15min stir, & then after the last 10min, it was almost on fire.  Black, crunchy & barely still edible.  Will try this again at a lower temp & keep a much closer eye on it.  Ooops!

I soaked dry chickpeas for this recipe and used less olive oil and tobasco and they turned out nice, but they are missing salt. I will try marinading the chickpeas for an hour prior to baking next time.

Made the recipe as directed. It turned out great. There’s only one problem-I can’t stop eating them! Will definitely make these again!

These are great! I omitted the cumin (personal preference) and it took quite a bit longer than expected to roast them, but they are delish!

Very tasty, very easy to make, my oven cooked it faster than the recipe suggested and few beans burned, but overall I will definitely make it again. Cooking time in oven - 37 min, overall prep and cooking time 45-50 min.
