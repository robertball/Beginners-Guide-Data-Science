This was pretty good.  I didn't have light cream so I just 1/8 cup of milk.  The milk was starting to over power the sour cream so I just kept it at 1/8 of a cup.  I had to add about 1/4 a teaspoon of salt.  Also, after I combined all the ingredients a let the flavors meld together on the stove top for 10min on a really low setting.  After that it tasted good.

I made this last night and it was great.  I had company and they didn't leave anything in the bowl...all gone.  I did leave out the bacon simply because we don't like it, but otherwise followed the recipes exactly.  Thanks for the post.

Made these last night and they were great! I followed the recipe exactly and my only compliant is that they were a little runny... I prefer really thick, creamy potatoes so next time I will use a little less broth and cream. I also added a large handful of cheese just because we LOVE cheese! I will definately make these again!

You can't go wrong with butter, bacon and sour cream in mashed potatoes, and cooking them in chicken broth just added another layer of delicious flavor.  I didn't measure exactly, but I certainly added quite a bit more butter than the recipe directed and only dribbled in the half and half.

These are very good. Chicken stock is a great way to make mashed potatoes if you are watching your weight. When making with steak use beef broth. I dont add bacon and they are wonderful!

Made this for thanksgiving twice. LOVE IT. I didn't change much, I don't really like bacon, so I don't add it. One of my fave mashed potatoes recipes out there.

This is so far the best mashed potato recipe I’ve come across here in this website. You just cannot go wrong with butter, sour cream, fresh chives and crisp bacon in mashed potatoes cooked in chicken broth. It has all the flavors I like in mashed potatoes. I used very little half and half with lots of butter and a heaping amount of sour cream. I minced up fresh chives and added the crispy bacon along with a little of its grease for flavoring. It was rich, creamy, savory, seasoned just right and delicious! I served this with, “Mushroom Slow Cooker Roast Beef,” and “Olive Oil Roasted Eggplant with Lemon,” also from this website.

YUMMY FOR TUMMY! I prepare the bacon, but I leave it out and let everyone put it on top as a garnish that wants it. Such a glorious comfort food!

Left out the bacon, otherwise the mash will become far, far too fatty. It's a decent enough basic recipe for a country-style bowl of mashed potatoes - whether you need to use BOTH sour and light cream is entirely up to you, the chef. Oftentimes the addition of some fresh chopped parsley just before serving can make the world of difference.

Very good but I don't think I really need to put in so many fatty ingredients into my mash potatoes. I prefer to use skim milk instead of cream and only a light sprinkle of bacon bits if any. I also used fat free broth and light sour cream. Yummy.

Our new go-to mashed potato recipe! I followed this exactly (I used half and half as the cream... is that light cream? I wasn't sure, so I guessed).  We passed on the bacon but I would totally add it for the occasional kick. But really, these potatoes don't need them.  They can stand alone - no gravy needed.  They were sooo good.  A definite keeper for our recipe book.

Everyone loved this dish.  This is going to be my new holiday dish.  The only thing I did different was I only had 1 can of broth- so I used it along with enough water to cover my potatoes.  I left them whole & when I mashed them, I kept the skin on.  Then I mixed in 4 oz of sharp cheddar cheese into the potatoes & then sprinkled a little on top. Delicious.

Everyone commented on these and I am pretty sure most people had THREE servings! This is great for company - trust me! UPDATE: I use 2 boxes of Swanson Chicken Broth (8 cups), 5 pounds of potatoes and double the rest of the ingredients.  I make these every couple of weeks and have never had them go to waste.  Great leftovers!

Just made this for my hubby and I. I cut it down to two servings and did not use the bacon or light cream. Instead of the cream I used milk. I also did not really follow the proportions--I just added some of each until it tasted good. I great recipe! Will definitely make again!

In place of the sour cream and chives, I use a tub of cream cheese with chives or other herbs.  I give this receipe five stars - it's a never fail dish.

I've made these potatoes several times, and the only thing I can say is that they're simply amazing. Every ingredient is perfect. I cooked them with my sister recently to feed four people and tried to convince her that she needed to double the recipe to eight, but she didn't seem to think we'd eat that many potatoes. After one bite she wished we had made more. My skinny, perpetually 85 pound sister kept going back for more until it was all gone, and then she cooked them again a few nights later! Best mashed potatoes I've ever had.

Awesome... even my super picky little brother had seconds. I used Turkey bacon, and it was deliscious.

i just use milk (not fat free) instead of cream, and then add about 1/2 cup of chopped sharp cheddar.  :)  if you don't have chives finely chopped green onion works well too.  Oh and I don't drain the bacon... it adds flavor.

These were fine, but I honestly couldn't really taste the chicken broth. I felt bad that I used so much instead of just using water. Not a thing wrong with the potatoes themselves, I was just hoping for more chicken flavor.

This is my go to mashed potato recipe! Cooking the potatoes in the broth adds a nice flavor, with no need to  add salt.  I tend to warm up the cream and butter to room temp and hand mash only to prevent any texture change (have added cold before and ended up with glue like mashed potatoes.   Recipe reminds me of when I was young and celebrated the Holidays at my grandparents home.

I don't usually go for the recipes that are sponsored by companies.  But I decided to bring this dish to a pot luck dinner that I attended.  We loved it, and so did everyone else.  We'll be making this again.

As usual, out of necessity, I made some mods w/ great results:
Steamed Red potatoes (water boiled off leading to slight burnt smell hence mashing time)
No lite cream->50% Mocha Mix, 50% whole milk;
No Bacon->thinly sliced Spam fried crispy;
No Chives->baby sweet onions w/ "stems" from the garden;
Put in oven pan, added sharp cheddar & tossed in the oven for a bit.
Result-Wife said "Best mashed potaotes ever!"

Surprisingly easy, and pretty good- my husband liked it, but I thought it needed more salt or butter or something. I didn't have cream so I substituted 1% milk, maybe that was the problem. But overall it was a very tasty, filling dish that I will make again!

Pretty Good. They tasted like a loaded baked potato. I will say I doubled the bacon and the chives though. I felt like it could have used a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top as well.

This was good; I didn't have enough broth to boil potatoes. I boiled them in water and then added 1/4 cup broth when I mashed them. I omitted the chives because they weren't in season yet.

Who knew mashed potatoes could be so simple and fast to make. Could use a little more seasoning of some kind though. I don't like buying whole containers of stuff, for a small amount, so I followed AMIJANES advice on subsituting the milk for light cream. It worked Great!

These mashed potatoes were delicious.  I was afraid that the potatoes might come out salty but they didn't at all.  I also didn't add any bacon because we were having these with baked pork chops.  Very delicious. Will definetely use this recipe again. Thanks.

This recipe was very easy to follow and not time consuming. How good was this Ultimate Mashed Potatoe dish? Everyone commented on how good it was this Easter afternoon. My son took the left overs. (not much left!) Very Yummy, went perfect with the ham as main course. Thank you, Carrie

These were excellent mashed potatoes - I will never make mashed potatoes with just water again!  We had these with our Easter dinner tonight, and I got rave reviews - I did omit the bacon (had a guest who is absolutely anti-bacon), but I'm looking forward to making this again so I can see how yummy these are with bacon!
