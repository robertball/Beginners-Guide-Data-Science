i made this just after i got my wisdom teeth out so i made some alterations. I also only had 1 cup of heavy cream and do not like pineapples.

1 cup whipping cream
1 1/4 cups 2% milk
4 tbsp coconut milk powder
1/2 pkg lemon pie filling
3/4 cup sugar
3 mashed bananas

if i wasn't on a soft-food-only died, i would have used less coconut powder and added the flaked coconut and walnut pieces. I was scared the frozen banana slices would be too hard, so i mashed them, however i will probably just slice them the next time i make this recipe.

I'm giving this 3 stars as it gave me a good start, however i made quite a few alterations to the recipe.

I give it 3 stars as it, however, it is easy to make and easy to adjust.  What I did was substitute an equivicant amount of tropical fruit blend for the coconut, walnuts, and bananas and it was fantastic!  5-stars all the way!  I've tried other combinations also, fresh berries with a berry juice blend, etc.  The choices are only limited by your imagination.  I've made it 3 or 4 times.

I don't have pineapple orange juice blend but I have pineapple juice and orange juice so I measured 2/3 cup of the two of them together (it was mostly pineapple juice).  I also used up bits and pieces of various milks in the refrigerator to make a total of 4 cups of liquid.  I used evaporated milk, reduced fat half and half and skim milk.  I added the banana cut into cubes, not sliced.  I really wanted to mash it but I didn't.  I added a dribble of both coconut extract and rum extract.  It froze up beautifully and is now in the freezer.  My taste of what I scraped out of the ice cream maker was very good.
