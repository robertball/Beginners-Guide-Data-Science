This is how I modify this recipe for 1 Gallon jar of pickles and veggies:
15 pickling cucumbers, 1 red bell pepper (cut bite size), 1 yellow bell pepper (cut bite size), 2 texas sweet onions (cut bite size), 1 entire stalk of celery (cut bite size), 8 carrots (peeled and cut on bias). Then 2 Tablespoons salt, 2 teaspoons of celery seed. Brine is made of 1 3/4 cups sugar, and 1 1/4 cup white wine vinegar. I only put cucumber, onion bellpepper into the salt mixture. These are all the vegetables that we have tried and they are great this way!

These are the crispest pickles! I did cut the sugar in half, left out the sweet peppers, added 1 t. pickling spice instead of the celery seed and 2 t. red pepper flakes. Wonderful! I have had the piclkes for 1 week and already shared the recipe with 5 friends.

So easy to do, and the taste is excellent.  I even kept adding cucumbers for weeks into the recipe and it was just as good!

Pickles are crisp, frest tasting and delightfully good.  My husband and I are sure to get raves when we take these pickles to our family outing.  It took no time at all for us to make them. Thanks for sharing.

Not really pickles, but delicious all the same! To make "pickles" crispy, MAKE THE VINEGAR SOLUTION FIRST, and refrigerate. Use REFRIGERATED cucumbers and after salting, put them BACK in the frig. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup; used 2 cups Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar (it has mother in it, great stuff); used the Hothouse English Cucumbers in plastic wrap, and peeled them a little bit, not all the way. No onion and no green pepper; instead I placed a fresh Serrano chile pepper halved lengthwise in each jar, because we appreciate hot and spicy food. I did use a Tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and a Tablespoon of celery seed. If I had fresh dill I would have tossed a sprig in. I put the cucumbers into the jars first, then covered them to the top with the vinegar solution. If you don't have enough vinegar solution, do NOT add water...just fill each jar up evenly, then top with more vinegar. Taste the next day, some may prefer more sugar, but not me! Another good thing...as each jar empties of pickles, just add more cucumbers!

Very, very good. I'll cut the sugar next time, but I think that's just personal preference - my husband did not think they were too sweet at all. I might also do an experiment with Splenda. Used white onion because I didn't have red. I cut the cucumbers REALLY thin, so it turned out more like a cucumber salad than pickles, but delicious nonetheless. Plan to double or triple if you're taking to a picnic or barbeque!

If you take the advice to halve the amount of sugar, this really is a 5 star recipe. I'm not a big fan of celery seed so I left that out. I made half with dried dill and half with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic - I like the garlic pickles just a little bit more. This is a great way to use up garden cukes. Thanks!

I liked these pickles.  They were my first try at making pickles.  Very easy to make.  My husband did not care for them, he said they taste too much like cucumbers.  If you like cucumber salad, you will like these.

This made the best pickles I have ever eaten. And judging by the requests I got for the recipe (and more pickles!), others obviously agree! I used 1 cup of sugar, red bell pepper, and a regular sweet onion, thinly sliced end to end. I used 2 tsp. of kosher salt. I cut into slightly thick slices, and they were incredibly crunchy, and so delicious. The cider vinegar is a great idea, it is much milder tasting than white vinegar. LOVE this recipe, and will be using it over and over.

These pickles are delicious!!  Thanks so much for sharing it!  A neighbor had given a bag full of cucumbers and I was looking for something to make with them.  I made PICKLES and plan to share them with my neighbor.

I made mine with only one very large cucumber - about 3 1/2 cups worth - and left out the peppers.  However, they were the most amazing pickles...  my grandma used to make the same ones when I was a kid on summer vacation at her house.  I think that everyone should try some of these!   I hate dill, but I could eat these all day!

This recipe has truly been a family favorite for generations.  Heating the vinegar/sugar/salt mixture helps the sugar dissolve quicker, but be sure you cool it first to keep the cukes crisp. Also be sure you add some powdered alum for crispness and longevity.  I use a large tupperware bowl and fill it with the cukes and onions before pouring the syrup over them. These can be kept for up to 12 months, just keep adding thinly sliced cukes and onions as the container gets low.  My family eats this as cucumber/onion salad (nobody likes gr pepper in it here)or pickles on burgers or hot dogs.

Couldn't have been any easier! I used a mandolin to slice the veggies; very thin blade for onions and peppers- medium blade for cukes and it took just a couple of minutes. As soon as I finished mixing in the sugar and vinegar, I tasted them and they were too sweet for me. For an easy fix, I drained off some of the liquid and replaced with more vinegar- next time I will taste after I add one cup of sugar and go from there- too bad I didn't think of this first :) 
I used a sweet onion as thats all I had in the house and added a big pinch of red pepper flakes, they taste great. I am looking forward to experimenting with different types of vinegars and seasonings, but this really is a simple and yummy way to enjoy the bounty of the season right now.

I used 4 rather large cucumbers from the garden and then did not add any green bell pepper (as I didn't have any).  I followed the recipe exactly and these little gems are addicting!  I love the sweet/sour flavor and the red onions are wonderful too.  Oh, no celery seed on hand so I used Beau Monde seasoning.  Very good.

I am not a fan of sweet pickles but I had seen this recipe recommended on the buzz and I decided to give it a try. I have to join in the chorus of praise. This recipe turns cucumbers into crunchy, cold slices of heaven on a hot summer day! After I made them I couldn't stop eating them. Seven cups sounded like an awful lot of cucumbers but it's really not that many. I used more garlic than the recipe called for because I like it anyway and my garlic was getting a little old. I will definitely be keeping these around and can't wait to share them with friends and family. I think I'll try them with English (seedless) cucumbers or I'll just scoop the seeds after slicing the cucumbers lengthwise but that's a purely personal preference. Thanks for sharing, Gary.

These were very tasty and easy to make.  My one and only disappointment was that the red onion turned the liquid and pickles pinkish which wasn't very appealing.  Next time I'll use white onion

Great!  Easy!  I used 1 3/4 cups sugar.   Next time, a cup and a half.  Also added a couple cloves of minced garlic, and a half a banana pepper diced.

Easy and super delicious.  Perfect use for garden cukes.  I did not have celery seed so I used red pepper flakes as another user suggested and they added a nice kick and a nice touch of color.  I will definitely be making this again! Thank you, Gary!

These are really good and so easy to make. I left out the bell pepper because I didn't have any and I don't really like it anyway.  I don't even like sweet pickles and these are terrific! Thanks for the recipe.

If you like German-style coleslaw, you'll like this recipe. My feeling is that recipes should be tried once as-is before reviewing or altering. So, after letting everything refrigerate for a day, I found it was too sweet for my taste, so I added an additional 1 tsp salt and 1/2 cup vinegar. This made it a more balanced 50/50 sweet to sour. We will enjoy variations of this all Summer (including hot peppers next time). Thanks for sharing!

i'm pregnant and LOVED this.  i'm almost just ate the whole batch.  and it wasn't as big of a pain of chopping things as i expected.  i used 1 1/2 c. sugar and will cut back to 1 c. next time.  (there will be a next time)  added a handful of dried chili peppers to add some spice -- which worked, but i had to squeeze the juice/seeds out after they had marinated for a little bit.  i agree it is more of  a cuc salad, and wish i had discovered this over the summer when cucs were more rampant.  for now, i'll just hope my food co-op continues to come through.

Love this recipe -  I did cut the sugar in half (bascially because I didn't have enough) but thought the flavor was great - perfect amount of sweetness for me.  Great way to use up a ton of cukes I got out of my garden - only wish I'd found it sooner!  Thanks!

These are very good!  I followed the recipe exactly, although I did take other reviewers' recommendations and stick a clove of garlic in two of the jars.  I couldn't stop snacking on them right off the bat and am looking forward to see how they taste after a few days in the jars.  This made almost 4 pints for us.  I think I could have included 8 cups of cucumbers instead of 7.  Might try adding a pinch of alum next time like another reviewer recommended.  thanks!

Yum!  The flavor was there!  Used one cup of sugar and it was great.  Will try to slice the cukes a little thicker so they aren't so limp.  Reminds of the kind my mom used to make

These pickles are wonderful.  I used the engllish cucumbers, long and narrow, wrapped in plastic.  They worked beautifully,  I did not peel.  I just sliced them in the food processor, it took about 15 seconds.  I also did the red onion this way.  I used multi color peppers.  The cucumbers cost $3.00 for the 3 of them,  and made a large amount of pickles.  I got them at Aldi's.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I love this site.

These were very good!  I did follow the advice of others and cut sugar in half.   Not too sweet and not too vinegary.  Also, I did not cut paper thin,  I cut a little thicker.  Perfect! Thanks!

I made this and gave some to my mother in-law and brother in-law, they loved it and she asked for the recipe and has made it since. Cut sugar to 1 1/2 C. Looks pretty in the jar, I used red bell pepper instead of green. I then made for gifts for my neighbors. Thanks will make again for my xmas baskets

So easy and very good.  They're not quite like anything you'll find in the store and they're an excellent way to use cucumbers that might go to waste as they keep well.  They're great on salads, sandwiches or simply straight out of the jar.  We are rarely without these on hand - and if we run out they are missed!  The recipe is excellent as is, but easy to modify as well. I've made them with red peppers, with and without onions, or even without peppers or onions and they turn out great. Sometimes I just add a few pieces of celery instead of celery seed. This is one of those recipes you just can't go wrong with. The simplest things are the best!

A friend gave me some "Frozen Pickles" so searched all recipies for the same recipe.  Found this recipe and it is exactly the same except she puts hers in THE FREEZER!!! and they are still crispy.  So if you have too many cukes just freeze the pickles.  They were great and I couldn't tell they had been frozen.  I've had freeze cole slaw before and didn't doubt the fact that she froze the pickles.  I eat all the ones she gave us on sandwiches.  This is a must try recipe.

I've made this twice, the first time I thought it had a lot of sugar but my husband liked it.  Then second time I put in less sugar and then ended up adding it back in because of the vinegar taste/smell.  Overall it was an easy, yummy thing to do with the abundance of cucumbers this time of year!

Great recipe!  I've had many great compliments from the folks I've shared the pickles.  My revision was to use red bell pepper, as I liked the color contrast.  I also used 1 and half cups sugar instead of the two cups.  A recent change I tried was to add hot banana pepper.  I have several growing in the garden.  I sliced the pepper into rings and then put about 3 rings in each container before adding the pickles.  Just a few pepper rings in each container added a great kick to the pickles!  Very easy recipe overall and great way to use up the cucumbers!

Update: I had too many zucchini, so made this recipe with the zucchini.  Turned out well too!  The zuccs did not break down as much as the cucs did; but I also did not let them sit in the salt for the prescribed time before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Regardless, still good tasting "pickles" and another way to use the zuccs!

My family and guests go CRAZY over these pickles! They remind me of the ones my grandmother used to make.  I don't use any green pepper ... just onion (I use sweet onions).  I mix the sugar and vinegar and bring it to a boil to allow the sugar to dissolve quickly.  I then pour the sugar/vinegar mixture over the cuccumbers and onions.  How easy can you get?  :)

Great recipe and so easy! I omitted the green peppers because I didn't have any. And I added 1 tsp whole black peppercorns. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used a 1:1 ratio of vinegar to sugar.

I loved how easy this recipe was! I had cucumbers coming out of my ears! I'm not big on the sweetness though so all I would do different is change cider vinegar to regular white vinegar...I already had cut the sugar in half.

Very crisp pickles and easy.  Cut sugar to a cup and left out the bell pepper.  First time I made it I used 1t of salt and found it a little flat.  Just upped the salt to 1 1/2t on my second batch.

I don't even usually like cucumbers but I got a ton of them in my CSA share today and got desperate about using them. Thank goodness I found this recipe -- they're amazing! And they've just started to marinate. I can't even imagine what they'll be like tomorrow morning. I followed the recipe exactly as written. My only concern is that the liquid seems inadequate for keeping the pickles from drying out. I'm planning to put them in canning jars and I think I might need to add more vinegar to cover them in the jars.

I am a diabetic and I had to use splenda sugar in mine & my husband said they tasted just as good as the real sugar ones I made for him.  Now I use my sugar in every jar I make.  They are the simplest and best pickles we have ever tasted.  Thanks so much.

I made this exactly as written and it did not turn out like a pickle at all.  It's more of a cucumber salad.  The family liked it but definitely not what I was looking for.

These came out really well. Like other reviewers suggested, I cut the amount of sugar in half and I think that was a wise decision. I also added some turmeric and dill.  I would make this again.

This is so much easier than the "Freezer Pickles" recipe I've been using.  I also cut the sugar in half with this recipe and it still has the perfect sweet tang.

Very easy, and very good.  I was skeptical these would work after mixing it up--not a lot of liquid at all.  But, with letting it sit in the fridge, the liquid is pulled from the cucumbers and you have a lovely marinade.  I like bread and butter, but dill are my absolute fave, so I was not as impressed as hubs, but I am thrilled I found something to help keep my cukes from going bad too quickly.  Tasty, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used one cup sugar and added 1/2 tsp. of black peppercorns and one garlic clove minced and five or six dashes of Frank's red hot sauce.  Really good

These pickles are great and so easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was omit the green pepper but that's just because I don't like peppers.  The pickles are really sweet but I like them this way.  I will make again for sure!

This recipie might have helped me have a better marriage... I'm not a huge pickle fan myself, but we live overseas and cannot buy pickles... and that for my husband was not okay!  I add dill seasonings to my pickles and reduce sugar/hot spices.  They turn out pretty darn good... almost like dill pickles in the states... but not quite.

They taste like cucumbers to me.  And I found the vinegar didn't cover the pickles so I added some water.

This a great and really easy. They were a little sweet for our taste so next time we'd add less sugar. We also added some different kinds of peppers to the mix because of what we had in our garden. These are wonderful.

These are very sweet and tangy which is how I like them.  Onion and green pepper were a nice addition.  I made as directed except for slicing thicker.  My kids liked them, too.  I love them the way they are, but I would agree with the suggestion to cut the sugar for those who don't like their pickles so sweet.

These were light and delicious.  I added a little more salt than the recipe called for, and will experiment with fresh garlic and jalapenos next time.  But, these are great just as the recipe specifies.

First off I need to say that for my entire life I have HATED sweet pickles. My husband also is not a fan of sweet pickles.  We have now been converted!!!  These pickles were so yummy they only lasted for 5 days.  We loved and ate it all--the onions the peppers, I even ate the few cloves of garlic that I threw in.  I can't wait to go back to the farm stand and get more cucumbers.  I will DEFINITELY be making another jar full.

I was given a bunch of cucumbers from a friend’s garden and decided to use this recipe. I thought no way will they be ready by dinner time. Oh My !  They were delicious!  I didn’t change the recipe at all. I only added white sweet onions to the mix.  Yum and a half!

These are great pickles!  My whole family loves them! 
The only things I changed were, I used a whole sweet red pepper for color, Vidalia onion instead of red and I only used 1 1/4 cup of sugar.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!

I leave a little of the skin on the cukes (for texture), slice them to the thickness of a good bread & butter pickle and instead of dicing the onions and peppers, I slice them into thin strips. Awesome on burgers and sandwiches!! Note: be sure to first put the pickles into jars, and then distribute the liquid evenly.

This is a very easy recipe to make. Much like what my mom used to make.  I found though there was way too much salt and I did much less sugar as Instead of using white sugar I used cane sugar so maybe that made it more sweeter.

Great concept, but definitely halve the sugar. I used a vidalia onion because that's what I had on hand. I added a sliced salsa pepper for a little kick to balance the sweet.

There should have been a warning in here somewhere that these are like bread&butter pickles.  I followed other recommendations and used half the sugar but they're still really sweet.

These pickles are fabulous! I did change it up a bit?? I eliminated the bell peppers and added thinly sliced red onion, mustard seed and celery seed and because I tripled the recipe I wanted to be able to store them longer so I did process them for 30 minutes and now I will have them for the summer! The quantity of the items I added are purely personal preference.

This is just like my mother's pickle recipe with the addition of thinly sliced sweet onion. My Mom passed away in 1976 and these pickles were part of our family tradition for many years prior to her passing. My family has continued to make these pickles over the years all through the growing season for cucumbers.  We too have cut the sugar in half and some use even less than half and love this recipe.

Great flavor. I did not bother peeling the cucumbers and I did not add the bell peppers.  To me, they were not quite ready in just a couple of hours. They still had a cucumber flavor.   I left them in the fridge for a couple of weeks and they turned out great.  I ended up giving away a few jars of them.

I use only about 3/4 cups of sugar.  I made twice the "juice" and added a tsp. of dill to each batch of juice.

These were good. There are a little on the sweet side though. I think this would be an exceptional sweet relish if you just chop the cukes and strain whatever portion you would be using. Yummy!

Easy and everyone that visits our house loves these pickles. This recipe allows us to use the many extra cucumbers from the organic farm this time of year.

wonderful recipe, reminded me of the pickles my grandparent would make.  Made these all summer long and never grew tired of them.  It's a family favorite now.

I have never pickled anything and I am a pickle lover. I tried this and it was great! Cut back on sugar but if you cut back too much then its just vinegar. Carrots did not work so well. Making it for Easter. Low calorie and homemade! Thanks for the recipe!

I have many relatives in the midwest and have heard them mention "refrigerator pickles", but I never thought much about it until I saw this recipe.  This was very good!  Thanks for the recipe!
