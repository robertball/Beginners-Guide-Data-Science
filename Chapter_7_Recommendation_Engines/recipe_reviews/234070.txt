This is a solid recipe.  Just a couple of hints.  Partially freeze the beef and slice it against the grain, very thin.  I marinated the beef for almost 24 hours.  (I didn't plan on that, it just happened) Add the broccoli first and sprinkle with a tiny bit of sugar and add 1/4 cup broth, cover and steam for about 5 minutes.  Remove from the wok and add the mushrooms (I use fresh mushrooms) and snow peas - cook for just a couple of minutes.  Remove and add the beef and marinade - it will cook in about 5 minutes, maybe less.  I added about 1/2 cup of broth at the end to make more sauce.  Add the broccoli etc... back in and toss.   Without the addition of the broth there would not have been enough sauce.  Serve with rice - quicker than driving for take out and so delicious.  Thanks!

Very good! I adapted it a bit for the vegetables I had on hand, but this was a very versatile recipe. I did the beef and the vegetable mixtures in separate pots at the same time so it came together very quickly.

Added 2 heaping tsps chili garlic sauce to give a little heat and a couple good squirts of Sriracha sauce. stirred in peanuts. The sauce is good not as salty as sauces with more of a soy sauce base. Can use hoisin if out of oyster sauce but like the oyster better. Have also made with some celery carrots red peppers. Yummy

I'd add more ginger (At least 7 slices worth of ginger) and garlic and leave them in until the end. Use the big chunk and remember to smash them to release the flavor. Beef can be marinaded in small and equal amount of soy sauce, wine, and sesame oil (with small amount of corn starch) for about 15-20 minutes. Room temp is good enough. Try to use Kai-lan (Chinese broccoli or Chinese kale) instead of broccoli to make it more authentic. Tip: cook the stems first and add florets later to avoid over-cooking.

Super easy and tasty. I used brandy instead of sherry and only used 1/2 of required amount with the rest water. Also I used fresh red peppers and mushrooms with the beef and broccoli. The recipe stated to mince the garlic but when we did that it burned in the oil. We started over and just smashed open a garlic clove. That was much easier and effective.

I subbed the beef for venison would have liked to get it a thinner cut (next time!). Followed most of the top commenters suggestions adding the 1/2 cup broth at the end made the sauce a bit too watery needs to be thicker. Otherwise great! Will want to try fresh mushrooms next time.

marinade didn't really flavor the meat when cooking beef it got so watery. It just didn't look or taste right. I love beef and broccoli and this was no match of what you can buy!!

This is a great recipe. I added carrot strips to the veggie mix. We loved the marinade and next time plan to double the mixture. Great dinner!

Delicious sauce which I think is the most important part of this recipe as you could use any vegetables suitable for stir frying. I couldn't get snow peas so I substituted an unseasoned frozen stir fry mix. Great way to use leftover roast beef. This is a keeper.

Yummity-yum-yum! Used dry vermouth because that's what I had, added about 1 T of Sambal Oleck chili paste and a big squiggle of Sriracha. Had partially steamed the broccoli and used fresh mushrooms. This will definitely be my "go to" recipe for beef & broccoli!

I read the previous reviews and did double the marinade. I marinated the beef in 1/2 of the total volume and retained the other 1/2 and added when I returned the vegetables. I shredded the garlic and ginger and left them in the pan; I used 16 oz fresh mushrooms and added them first then the broccoli and peas. Next time I would increase the cornstarch because it did not glaze... Solid recipe! We loved it and will definitely make it again!

I substituted hoisin souse for oyster sauce and because that is sweet deleted the sugar. A used seasoned rice wine vinegar instead of sherry and fresh instead of canned mushrooms. Delicious - but don't think I would have liked it much without the changes. Ai would also add more fresh ginger next time.

I really liked this. It made a real nice sauce on the veggies. Next time I would use olive oil instead of veggie oil (don't like the taste) and I did add a little more soy sauce to this to give it that salty oriental taste. I used froze broccoli which I don't recommend but it's what I had. Turned out fantastic anyways. I will use your recipe again.

We really enjoyed this! I followed Baking Nana's cooking suggestions and will do so again. I intended to make this as written but my toasted sesame oil had gone rancid I don't use it very often so I used 3 drops of sesame oil. The store where I shop didn't have any snow peas I was so disappointed so I added extra mushrooms. Served over rice and garnished with green onions and toasted sesame seeds...Delish!
