This was excellent!  I doubled the recipe, but used about three pounds of meat.  I used frozen corn (didn't cook or defrost) and whole olives.  For the taco seasoning I used a double recipe off this site.  I cut the milk down to 1 cup per recipe.  I work, so after spraying "Pam" in the casserole, I put it on low for the 9 hours I was at work.  I added the cheese when I got home and headed off to a pot-luck.  Everyone raved about it!  The consistency was perfect, no dry crust in the pan.  It was moist just like a home made tamale.  The flavor was great.  Thanks, an easy, delicious recipe.

This was really yummy!  The only thing I would have changed was probably not cooking it on high.  Maybe it was just my crockpot, but I turned it to low about 3/4 through the cooking time and it still got very overcooked on the crockpot side.  Since the meat is already cooked, I think it's okay to cook it on low for at least most of the sooking time

This was an excellent recipe! So easy, and delicious.  My husband even took leftovers to work the next day for lunch...so, that says a lot! :)  It's also a very versatile recipe as you could really add whatever you want to it.

I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Then, I added 1 can each of black and pinto beans.  I also used taco seasoning instead of chili seasoning.

After reading previous reviews, I was skeptical of cooking it on high the entire time.  I ended up switching it to low heat half-way through the cooking time.

First, I should say that the only thing I changed about the recipe was adding an onion and a clove of garlic.  Secondly, I'll tell you that I'm very glad I didn't make this on a day I had to work.  If I did, I would have come home to a dried up, burnt up mess.  After two hours in the crockpot on high, it was starting to burn around the edges.  When I took the lid off, it was audibly sizzling.  I quickly turned it to low and left the lid off for a while to cool it down.  It appeaed to be done -- TWO HOURS EARLY, and my boyfriend's was not due home from work for (can you guess?) two hours.  I left it on the "keep warm" option until he got home. It was beyond bland -- maybe it's just because it was WAY too overcooked by the time we ate it?  There is definitely something wrong with the recipe -- if not the ingredients, than the cooking temperature and/or time.

This turned out really good with the changes I made based on the other reviewers. I added garlic and onions. Instead of chili seasoning i added cumin, onion powder, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Instead of cornmeal I used a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix and used 1 egg and about a cup of milk. I also added a can of black beans. For the diced tomatoes I used diced tomatoes with green chiles (like Rotels). I baked it at 375 for about an hour. YUMMY!!!

This was so good! I didn't have chili seasoning so I used taco seasoning and I substituted zucchini for the bell peppers (I didn't have any of these either). I followed the rest of the recipe except for I baked it in the oven because I couldn't wait for the slow cooker at the time. I baked it at 350 for about 40-45 min. and added the cheese the last 5 min. It turned out great and seasoned perfectly. So good! Thanks for sharing recipe.

Very yummy flavor!  I took others advice and used taco seasoning instead of chili.  I didn't have to time to put in slow cooker so I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes and then added the cheese and cooked 10 more minutes.  Served over fritos with sour cream on top.

I doubled this recipe and although the flavor was great, the texture was off. It came out a bit mushy. Next time I try this, I'll reduce the amount of milk to see if I can firm it up a bit. Thinking that when doubling this one, need to not quite double the milk.

This is very good. My husband ate the leftovers. I used taco seasoning because that's what I had. Great with some s. cream and scallions to finish it off.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  I followed others instructions on cooking time as well.  It wasnt what I was expecting.  It was a fun recipe to try though.  Sorry, just not for me.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe based on the other reviews. 1) Added onion to the ground beef; 2) Used taco seasoning instead of chili powder; 3) Used 1 c. milk and 1 c. cornmeal and didn't mix it in with the rest of the ingredients; 4) Added a can of black beans.  I poured all ingredients (except the cornmeal/milk/egg mixture) into the slow cooker first.  Then I layered the cornmeal mixture on top.  I cooked on low setting instead of high setting for the time listed in the recipe.  Turned out great!  Definitely keeping this and making it often.  Thanks!

As an experienced home-cook, I read all the reviews before making a new dish so I can learn other people's mishaps instead of making my own. Instead of cooking on high, COOK ON LOW for the same amount of time as written in the recipe. Since you've browned the ground beef in the skillet, it's fully-cooked. Since it's bathed in some liquid in the slow cooker, cooking on low is sufficient. Cooking on high runs the risk of drying out the meat, as some reviewers have experienced. Instead of using cornmeal, USE GROUND OATMEAL. I don't have cornmeal on hand, probably never will, but oatmeal is a healthy substitute. If you follow the rest of the recipe, you will have delicious results. We put the casserole in hard-shell tacos, topped with shredded cheese, and had happy bellies. We've put the casserole in soft tortillas but prefer the ease of crisping the tacos in the oven for 3mins at 250F instead of warming/flipping soft tortillas on the stove 15secs each.

After reading other reviews, I decided not to mix everything together.  Instead, I added 1 C of flour to the cornmeal mixture along with some sugar and salt to make it more like cornbread.  I added this to the bottom of my greased crockpot, then spooned the beef mixture over it. The final result was more like a pie and tasted incredible!  I will definitely make it this way again.

This was a great recipe, tho a little bland. I added a can of chili beans with the sauce. Next time I will add more spice. I didn't have time for the slow cooker, so I made it in a 9x13 dish and baked it at 375 degrees for about 30 min.

This recipe is awesome and easy.  I used 1 cup of milk and a little extra cornmeal to get the right consistency.  I kept the corn mix seperate (from the meat and tomato mix) - and next time I will put half the corn mix on the bottom first, put the meat mix over that, and finally, pour on the rest of the corn mix over that.  Cook this recipe on medium/low and it will turn out perfectly.  I used shredded chicken breasts and jalapenos and it was still pretty darn good.  It reheated well the next day and I cannot wait to make it again!  Thank you!

i cooked this on LOW for 8 hrs but it was done by 4-6 hours. flavor was great and my husband loved it. i will make again, but it will have to be a day that i am home..... so it defeats the purpose of being able to cook while i am @ work - which is why i have my slow cooker, hmmmm

The only modification made to this was the omission of olives since my family doesn't like them.  This was just a mushy, flavorless mess with an unappetizing appearance.  My husband described it as a waste of cheese.  Sorry!

This was good!  My kids didn't agree though which is part of the 4star rating.  I boiled chicken, shredded it, then put on stove with tomatoes and taco seasoning and olives.  Mixed the corn in with cornmeal egg and milk (cut down to 1c).  Put chicken mixture on bottom of 8X8 baking dish and poured cornmeal on top.  375F for 30 min add cheese give it another 10 min.  Done!  I thought it was great, next time I may try a little enchilada sauce on it (or in it) or something.  How many things can I do to this to make it different every time???  hmmmmm....  Thanks for the recipe!

Good basic recipe... but I looked at many different reviews changed it based on them and made additional changes... mine turned out great but really didn't resemble the given recipe anymore... maybe I'll post what I ended up making!

I felt like this needed more salt--I wonder if that could have been due to the chili seasonining packet I chose (Williams brand).  I think next time I make it, I will use taco seasoning instead and see how it turns out.  Otherwise, I like the texture created by the cornmeal.

This was very easy and good. It was missing something though, needed a bit more flavor, maybe taco seasoning would do the trick. I will be making this again!

I thought after reading other reviews that I had a handle on this thing. But it is now clear to me that the recipe is missing something crucial. I wish I could have figured out what it was. Many have mentioned the heat level, and I found that to be a problem. For me, using a 7-quart slow cooker, the sides burned while the center was mushy. I went ahead and ate it and found the taste to be okay.

My family loved this! I browned the beef with an onion and a clove of garlic. Then dumped it in the crockpot with 2 cans rotel mexican tomatoes, the olives, and 4T of homemade taco seasoning (from this site). Mixed 1c milk, the egg, and 3/4c cornmeal together and poured over the top of the meat mix. Cooked on high 2 hours, added cheese and cooked another 20 minutes. Served with a salad and sour cream. We loved this and will make it again!

I made this in the oven, basically because my slow cooker is old and hard to clean!  I used Rotel instead of tomatoes, and taco seasoning instead of chili seasoning.

This recipe is a keeper!  However -- Don't cook on high, it will dry and stick to the crock pot.  I have made it a couple of times and made the following minor changes based on our personal tastes -- first, I double the recipe and I use my own homemade spicy taco seasoning, I use black beans instead of corn  also throw in some green chiles, and serve wth chips on the side.  Both hubby and the kids love it.

It doesn't get much easier than this! This was super easy to throw together and wonderful that it cooks in a slow cooker. We followed the directions exactly except using veggie meat for the beef. Next time I will add in some black beans as well and maybe some green chilies. My husband enjoyed this as well. I will definitely make it again.

Yes, the final product does resemble dog food a bit, but it tastes good. We ate ours with fritos and sour cream on top.

This is a great tasting dish! Mine also got a little over cooked around the edges and was a little "mushy" in the middle. My family still loved the taste!

This is a great, easy to prepare recipe!  However I made some changes to the ingredients.  Instead of ground beef I used ground chicken.  I also left out the olives and added a can of black beans and a can of green chilies.  I even sautéed some onion before cooking the chicken to add extra flavor as well.  I served it with sour cream and it was delicious!

The first time I made it as printed, it was overcooked around the perimeter. So the second time I not only doubled it, I also lined the perimeter of the crock pot with parchment paper and then removed it just before serving. Since I have also substituted the beef for canned chicken breast. This is a WONDERFUL base recipe!!!

Absolutely love this! I make it almost weekly, and the whole family loves it!
I double the recipee, add an red onion, red bell peper, garlic and taco spices to the meat when I brown it. I leave the olives out (personal taste) and add one can of black beans to the double amount of other ingredients.
I replace the chili spices for taco spices. 
Becaue I use twice the amout of ingredient, I do cook it 4 hours on high. I serve it with salsa and sour creme.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars.  Simple enough and very filling.  Per PP's advice, I just used a box of Jiffy cornbread mix, 1 egg and a cup of milk since I never have cornmeal on hand.  I used diced tomatoes with green chilies and taco seasoning mix.  I think the next time I may use black beans instead of ground beef, would probably be just as good but less expensive and meatless.  I served with some sour cream.

It's pretty good but I think next time I'm going to add some red pepper flakes for spice, double the meat, and maybe an onion and peppers. I did cook it on low like some suggested And it came out good.

Slow-cookers vary -- my brand high is high, best suited for soups, stews, and such. This dish has become a staple, we have variations on this theme two or three times a month. Sometimes with a can of beans (black, pinto, dark kidney), or with leftover pork loin instead of ground beef. Add bell pepper if you have it. I've even added leftover Spanish rice.

This was worth a second try. I ended up using taco seasoning & adding rotel & black beans. I have had the opposite issue of most reviewers and could not get this to cook to my satsfaction...it just wouldn't set...I took it out of the crock pot and spread it in a pan...shoved it in the oven with a coating of sharp cheddar. Yum! Like a tamale without the fuss...will try shredded seasoned chicken next time. We completed it with a topping of sour cream, taco sauce, & a spattering of green onion.

I used homemade taco seasoning from this site, doubled the corn meal (made too thick) and poured the cornmeal mixture on top of the meat/tomato mixture.  I cooked it only about an hour or so on high.  It was good, but much better the next day reheated with extra tomato I had left over from a large can.  Next time I will use about a cup of cornmeal.

This is tasty, easy, and filling. I took other reviewers' advice and used taco seasonings (Taco Seasoning I from this site). I would have given it the 5th star if  the cooking time and setting had not been an issue. You will have to experiment and check on it the first time to figure out how to "set it and forget it" in the future.

Pretty tasty!  My family loved it.  We definitely plan to make it again.  We served it with some Spanish rice, which went together well with this.  I will probably try using taco seasoning next time, and throwing in a can of black or pinto beans.  I used extra lean beef, and it didn't taste dry or "extra lean."  I might also try it with ground turkey, which is what I generally use when I cook, instead of beef.  Makes good leftovers, too!

This wasn't really what I had expected, probably because I'm spoiled from the Fanny Farmer version of this dish wish is amazing. I had to add a lot of salsa to make it taste like something. I would suggest adding lots of yummy flavorful red salsa to the mixture some canned diced green chilies, and another packet of the taco seasoning. I could even see a can of pinto or black beans going in here. This didn't reheat well, was all hard and nasty, so eat it in one go. And I did cook it on low and it was fine for those of you who have jobs to go to like me. :)

My family loved this! I did do a little tweeking though, I added chopped onion and garlic to the meat and I doubled the recipe but I only used two pounds ground beef. I also stirred the chili seasoning into the meat, and I added two cans green chilis to spice it up. This recipe made so much that I mixed in the leftovers the next day with some macaroni noddles and grated up some velvetta and baked it and made a whole other casserole which was also good. I had no problem with it burning on the edges but that may have been because I doubled the recipe.

I really liked this and think my husband will too when he gets to try it out when he returns from Iraq.  Just recently got a slow cooker and was looking for lots of recipes and this has turned out to be a favorite.  I will use Rotel next time instead of just tomatoes and liked the chili seasoning flavor even though some mentioned using taco seasoning.  My 3 year old enjoyed this very much, but he isnt a picky eater so he eats whatever I make for him.

Definitely do NOT cook this as long as the recipe says, it will be totally dried out.  The meat is cooked so simply doesn't need this much time.  I made the recipe as written and only rate them if I have made them as written.  I found it lacked flavor.  I may try this again making the changes recommended in other reviews, but more likely I will simply look for another recipe.

This was really, really yummy! However, the people who said it may need to be cooked at a low level, or cooked for less time, are correct. There was about an hour left of cooking time when I realized that it was beginning to get crusty around the edges, so I turned the slow cooker down to low. After 15 mins. or so I realized that would not save it, so I added about 3/4 cup of milk... then it was fine. I also skipped the jalapeno pepper, but I did add hot sauce. Delicious!

I was in the mood for Mexican and needed to leave something in the slow-cooker. I looked this up and after reading some other reviews I modified it also. I did everything the recipe said, except I added a can of black beans, Mexican Rotel, can of green chilis, and I used taco seasoning (all I had on hand) and ground turkey. I put it on Medium instead of high. When we got home I looked at it and I thought, doesn't look so good. My husband said, "Oh my goodness this is good stuff, this recipe is a keeper!" We had a salad and corn chips to go along with it. So I guess we're keeping this one.

This was ok. Nothing out of this world, but not horrible either. I used taco seasoning rather than chili seasoning, and I added it to the beef rather than mixing it in with the other ingredients. I also cooked it on low instead of high. Even on low, it was burning around the edges after a couple hours.  Probably won't make again, we just weren't crazy about it.

I used soy crumbles, and tomatoes with jalepeno peppers for more kick. Cooked on low rather than high for recommended time. DH and I both like it, but our daughter did not. DH called it a keeper. Will make again.

This had a good overall taste.  It was well received by my church group.  I think though I'd prefere a layered tamale casserole so it would taste more like tamales.

This was great. I added a few diced hot peppers and it was fantastic. I did not have diced tomatoes so I added salsa. Cooking time is less than 3 hours though. Around 2 is better. Just keep your eye on the time so it does not burn. I made it for work and it was a hit. Yummy Yummy Yummy.

This is an excellent and simple alternative for your normal chili or meatloaf comfort meal. To cut on salt and fat, I use skim milk, and I use chili seasoning with less sodium. It still tastes good, and if you need a little more taste, squeeze lime or a lemon right before you eat. Enjoy!

We liked this one. Doubled the recipe but as per other reviews, used 2 cups of milk, 3lbs of ground beef. And I must have the same crockpot as Diana, because mine did cook on high for right at 4 hours total. Over all a pretty good recipe and if you are looking for simple, this is it! Will put this one in my rotation to be used again in the future, probably not quite as often as others though.

This casserole turned out great! I made only minor modifications: I sauted 1/2 chopped onion before browning the hamburger, added 1 can kidney beans and 1 cube beef boullion (for flavor.) I used taco seasoning and it was great but next time would try chili seasoning and maybe even add extra cumin and chili seasoning for a little more flavor. Perfect for those cold winter nights.

My family loved it.  I agree it looks a bit mushy and sloppy when you serve it, but the flavor is awesome!  I took many others suggestions and did the following: sauted chopped onion and some garlic with meat,added an egg, put in a 1/2 cup less milk, added a small can of green chilies, used a taco seasoning mix, added a can of red beans, and a package of frozen corn. I also used an enamel casserole in the oven for 1hr @ 350. Next time I will try it in the croc pot.

This was good. I can't say that I would make it alot, though. It just seemed somewhat of a mushy texture. Anyway, my family did like it. I did add garlic, onion, and black beans also.

My kids really ate this up!  However, I had to add more chile to spice it up a little, plus beans to add more substance.  Plus, after reading several reviews which stated that the cornmeal was too runny, I added a half-cup flour and it turned out well (I live at high altitude and extra flour is often added to bread/cake recipes).  It was easy to make.

We love tamales and this recipe tastes just like them.  I added an onion and 2 cloves of garlic and I also used taco seasoning instead.  It is also very good with a little enchillada sauce spooned over the top.  I made this tonight and my hubby is already requesting that we have it again.

I enjoyed this and would make it again. I did make several changes. I added an additional egg to the cornmeal/egg/corn mixture. I layered the crockpot with ground beef and then stirred in the diced tomatoes. I had mixed the other ingredients in a separate bowl (the cornmeal/egg/milk/corn mixture) I poured it on top and it made more of a custard/cornbread type of topping. If I had to do anything different, I would have added either diced chiles or jalepenos to the cornmeal mixture. I thought it important to cook on high if you are going to cook it in 3-4 hours. Made it firm enough to serve as you would a pie. I served this with sour cream on top and heated up some refried beans. 
Everyone wanted a second helping.

If you were to judge this dish by its looks, this recipe isnt so hot....A big pile of orangish-colored chunky mush. But it does taste great!! I served it to my husband and my parents, and they all gobbled it up. After reading other reviews I reduced the milk to 1 C. and used taco seasoning packet instead of the chili seasoning. I served it with corn bread on the side.  Yum!

I was really excited to make this dish and thought today would be the perfect day with freezing temperatures outside! I added some extras to it--green chiles, taco seasoning, and garlic powder, however, it did not turn out as good as I would have liked it. It was very mushy--almost like a dip. In fact, I ate it with tortillas b/c it was not very satisfying to eat on its own. If I made it again, I'd definitely keep the chilis, add some onions, and maybe some spinach to help liven it up a bit. I would not make this as a "main course" but maybe as a dip for watching a game or on a cold day.

The taste was OK, the presentation was awful. It was indeed overcooked on the edges, but the rest was mushy, the consistency of sloppy joes perhaps. Even with all the seasoning, (I used "hot" chili seasoning) it was pretty bland and needed a ton of salt and jalapenos. This improved the taste quite a bit, but I wouldn't serve it to guests.

I have no idea what happened here.  I followed the posted recipe and then worried about the thickness of the dish (most people cut down on the milk) so I stirred in another 1/4 cup of corn meal just incase.  With about 1/2 hour left, the dish was still somewhat mushy in the slow cooker but the sides were burning as others described it.  I had even lowered the cooking temp to low mid-way.  I am not sure I would try this again in the crockpot...maybe on the stove.

My boyfriend really liked this one and he is very picky. I wasn't as thrilled about it but I will be making it again. I was so surprised how close it tasted to actual tamales! I'm totally going to try this with other meats like chicken and shredded beef as I'm not too crazy about ground beef myself. Just a personal taste thing! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I followed the advise of others and cooked on low for eight hours.  It turned into a mushy mess, slightly crisp on the edges.  The flavor was ok, but texture not what I had expected.  I think I would try mixing beef, seasonings, and vegetables and layering the cornmeal mixture on top. Then cook for the prescribed time.

I didn't have any tomatoes so I used tomato sauce and no corn so I had to use cream corn. I don't know if this just made it too runny But it wasn't as good as I was hoping. Also, I am really glad my husband was home sick because I got a call 2 hours after starting it that it was burning on the edges, this was on the lowest heat setting. It was good and I will try and make it again with the right ingredients, but I wont make it while I am gone.

I thought the consistency was very mushy and overall just didn't feel like it was a good dish.  My husband liked it which was good but he generally likes food pretty bland.  If I make it again will probably just be for him.

One of my Favorite recipes ever. I use chicken and also add diced green chili peppers, but other than that I stick to the original and it turns out great. It isnt the most appealing thing to look at, but it tastes so good, who cares.

Delicious. The second time I made it though, we doubled the recipe and it didn't turn out as well. Will make again but will not double it again.

Excellent recipe, the family loved it including mom and dad.  The only modifications I made was Rotel (tomatoes/green chili) as a substitution for the tomatoes since I didn't have them on hand and using the taco season vs. chili seasoning.  It was wonderful.  I did not have sticking problems as indicated in some of the other reviews and I did cook on high (I have a new teflon cooker and I did coat with pam as well).  I did turn the cooker off after I added the cheese as it melted pretty fast.  This is a keeper!

This needs a little work.  The overall flavor was OK but I'm just not sure about it.  I might do it again, if I do I'll definitely leave out the corn.

I give this 3 stars.  I used taco seasoning instead of chili.  Might try chili next time.  The only thing I'm thinking I might do different is add the dry seasoning to the meat instead of the liquids.  pameyjo

I give the original recipe 2 stars. I thought it was tastless and had a weird mushy texture. But I did try it again changing a few things. I added 1/4 lb. of bacon, an onion, and chipotle peppers. Turned out much better flavor wise but I will not try again simply because of the texture.

I really liked this.  I added a large garlic clove and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  I probably could have cooked it a bit longer.  My husband ate it, but isn't a fan of Mexican or casseroles.  My toddler didn't like it.

This looked like slop, but tasted OK. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked on LOW for 4 hours, and used a can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos and a packet of HOT chili seasoning mix in an effort to jazz it up a little, since some reviews said it was bland. Overall, this was OK when served with salsa. Not sure if I would make again, but thanks!

I was very disappointed.  I made this recipe exactly as stated, but felt it was a little favor-less.  It was nothing close to a real tamale.  I won't be making this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used taco seasoning as someone else had, because I had it on hand.  I left out the olives and substituted Morning Star Farms veggie crumbles instead of the ground beef.    Everyone at our house LOVED it!

This recipe was very bland. I cooked on high for two hours and then on low for a few hours after that, and it was burned around the edges. This recipe needs more taco seasoning or something to give it some oomph. Perhaps using Ro-Tel tomatoes and green chiles would help.

This was a good tasting recipe.  The only thing I did not like about this recipe is it should not be used as the main dish.  Unless you would use it as a filling for tacos.  I will make this again for superbowl Sunday to add to the top of nachos.

My very picky husband LOVED this recipe.  He has been craving tamales so I thought I would try this.  I cooked mine in the oven and used Jiffy mix with 3/4 cup milk.  We thought this was yummy.  I think the people who thought it was plain probably don't like tamales.  It tasted pretty much how you would expect basically ground beef, tomatoes, and cornmeal/cornbread would.  We will make this again and again.

This works good with beans instead of meat (black, kidney, etc). I also keep the cheese out and use TACO seasoning instead of chili seasoning. It is much healthier overall and my family and friends crave it!

This was pretty tasty, but a little spicy for my taste.  I would give 3 1/2 stars if there was a half star.

Well, it was worth a shot.  Very mushy consistency and rather bland.  Not really BAD, just not very good.  Might be good for kids, but we have more adult palates.  :)

This was really not satisfying at all. I was so disappointed.  This recipe was followed exactly and it came out mushy and gooey.  We couldn't even eat it and had to go out for burgers.  I thought it would be more like a cornbread with the cornmeal but it was more like a gritty dip!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My family just loved it instead of just chili seasoning I add spicy chili seasoning and some jalpenos.

Tasted great and SO easy to make.  My husband thought it was too dry but I reminded him that Tamales are supposed to be a bit on the dry side.  I cooked them for 4 hours but on Low rather than High.

This recipie is good,  It has great flavor, I used taco seasoning instead of chili seasoning and added kidney beans, also used the frozen corn.  Don't double the recipe unless you know you need a LOT!!

This was pretty darn good with the modifications I made based on previous reviews. Some people complained about theirs being mushy, so I added about 1 c. cornmeal. I also added a can of chopped green chilies, drained. I used chili powder instead of chili seasoning mix, and baked it in a casserole at 350F for 35 min, topped it with shredded sharp white cheddar, baked for another 5 min. It turned out great! My whole family enjoyed it. I will make it again, possibly in the slow cooker next time.

It is delicious but a bit meat heavy.  Some more vegetables mixed in besides corn and a bit more cornmeal batter would enhance and put this over the top.

Pretty simple. I add black beans, use spicy taco seasoning instead of chili seasoning and I use salsa instead of diced tomatoes. It was good but not exciting, but I gave it 4 stars because my husband loves it.

This was good, but I am not sure if mine came out correct.  I might try it again, but not anytime soon. It was fast and easy.  Definitely a plus and full of stuff I always have on hand.

This was tasty, but much more of a dip than a meal! 

I used a taco seasoning packet rather than chili and I had to add a bit of salt, other than that it was good. I'll make this again, but only as a dip.

Substitions made included stewed sliced tomatoes over diced tomatoes, cheddar jack cheese instead of just cheddar. Served with cheese quesadillas & added sour cream & chives upon serving. Fiance thought it could had been more saucy but maybe it was because I over cooked them, not sure. It was a good recipe & will still will make it again at some time but not the best. Thanks anyway!
