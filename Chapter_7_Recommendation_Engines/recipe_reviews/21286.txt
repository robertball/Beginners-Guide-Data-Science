The first time I made this, I made it exactly as Pat. C. directed, and it was pretty good. Not amazing or anything, but a decent recipe and easy enough to put together and very nice for a light dinner with a dise salad. The second time I made it, I didn't have any bread on hand (other than the squishy "pillow" bread which isn't really good for anything except getting the kids to eat peanut butter) I DID have some asiago cheese bagels from Panera that were getting stale though. I sliced them in half, and then in half again (so I had 4 thin circles from each bagel) and LET ME TELL YOU it was OUTSTANDING! WOW! I plan on making this again the next time we have overnight guests, and I will buy the bagels just for this. Even my six year old, who turned up her nose at it the first time, ate two helpings when I made it with the bagels. I wish I could give it more than five stars. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not really gross, but not good either. My family thought it just tasted like mushy bread. Easier to make a fritata or omelet.

Love this quick and easy recipe!  I add sauted onions, a splash of sherry, and a little dry mustard to the egg/milk mixture.

I'm going to have to critize.  This misses the mark.  First, it's not a souffle.  It's a baked egg and cheese dish.  A souffle needs to have eggs separated and folded together after having been whipped.  I'll play with it and come up with a breakfast casserole, but wouldn't consider making this to serve as a 'souffle' again.

I have a similar recipe that my cousin gave me many years ago and I've made it every Thanksgiving since then.  The key is to NOT use so much liquid.  If you use too much,  the bread will be too soggy.  Use only 1 cup milk and it turns out better.   Also,  use older, dryer bread as the other reviewer stated.  But this is awsome.  I made my own from memory since this is an annual tradition with my family.  They would get upset if I didn't make a "Cheese Souffle" on Thanksgiving.

This was awesome!! I took another reviewers advise and used an Asiago cheese bagel. I only made half a recipe. I also threw in a little dry mustard and a small handful of green onion and mushrooms. I cooked in a large loaf pan and bread was covered. Next time I will not butter the bagel and will cook at 350 instead of 375. All in all, it was teriffic.

This was tasty and easy.  Allowing time for the bread to soak up the egg mixture is critical.  I think this may be where the cook who said hers was like soggy bread may have gone wrong.  Making it the night before is the way to go.

I soaked the bread overnight and after 45 minutes of baking it was soggy bread, so I turned the oven up to 425 and baked for 20 more minutes and still soggy bread.  To top that off there was an inch of grease on the bottom of the pan

My family thought this was rather blah and unfilling. I guess we are looking for something with more substance.

THought it was pretty good. My mother has always made something like this. Added dry mustard, some diff kinds of cheese, and used a loaf of nice bread (not standard wonderbread white kind) purchased from bakery.

Cut the bread into cubes after you butter it. I have  made similar version for years and love it. Serve with bacon on the side! Great for holiday breakfast as you put it together before you go to bed :)

The dish is not a typical souffle.  However, the recipe  was quick, simple, and delicious!  I added dry mustard.  I am always looking for quick and simple recipes.  My family enjoyed!

This recipe turns out perfect every time. The only thing I do different is add a very light spred of yellow mustard, over the butter, like my Aunt Rachel used too. if you haven't tried it this way, you should.

I loved this recipe, and so did my husband! I would have given it a 5 star, but I made a lot of changes. I followed a review and used cheese bagels instead of bread, I added a little hot sauce, diced tomatoes, and green onions to the egg and milk mixture. The amount of milk is fine if you're using bagels, but if you're using bread, then it would be too much milk. I actually cooked mine in a 9x9 pan for about 55 minutes at 375 and it turned out fine.

It was my first souffl√©. I think it is a great starter recipe. I added some pepper jack instead of all cheddar, and I used wheat brea instead of white, but it was really good.

I really wanted to try this, so I read all the reviews and tried a couple of the suggestions. I had older white mushy bread and used that. I also added saute'ed onions. I used only 1 cup of milk, two eggs and added sweet onion dressing, spicy honey mustard and a dash of Worcestershire sauce for flavor. And we loved it! Yummy. Easy. And I will do it again!
