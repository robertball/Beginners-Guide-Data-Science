This was the second time making these and I made a few changes with excellent results. I used chicken tenders as my son likes chicken strips - the first time they were a bit soggy but this time - I turned them after 15 minutes I broiled them for 5. I used 1/3 cup bread crumbs and sesame seeds. I didn't have an egg so I mixed a couple of tablespoons milk with sesame oil to dip in before breadcrumb mixture. Yummy, will make often

We really enjoyed this one.  Per some other folks' comments, I melted about 2 tbsp. butter in the pan before baking, and had no problems with sticking.  To enhance the sesame flavor, I whisked 1 tbsp of sesame seed oil together with the egg- it brought out the flavor beautifully.  A nice, mildly-flavored dish- my 2-year-old gobbled it up.  Oh, and I used thigh meat instead of breast, and it was amazingly moist and juicy!

It was very bland but tasted fine.  I added red chili flakes for some kick and a little salt and pepper. Next time I might also add italian seasoning or something along those lines. The recipe is definitly a good base.  I didn't have problems with dryness. It was perfect and I kept them in for the full 30 minutes.

I used Progresso Garlic & Herb breadcrumbs and doubled the Parmesan cheese.  Yummy!  I fixed extra and my husband who never packs his lunch took the leftovers to the office for his lunch.  This easy recipe will now be a regular dish in our house.

I added equal parts bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and they turned out great!  I would have to say they need some kind of sauce to go with them though.

I made these as chicken fingers and they were good.  I followed the recommendations of others, increasing the parmesan and decreasing the bread crumbs.  I also added garlic, salt and pepper to the crumb mixture and sesame oil to the egg.  The dry adjustments worked really well, but the sesame oil (about 1/4 tsp.) was wrong.  I will definitely make these again, but will leave the sesame oil out.

It was a good recipe.  What I did to ensure the chicken stayed moist was I wrapped each chicken breast in foil with a small amount of butter on top.  That gave it a little "steam" and the butter seemed to help keep it moist and add a little flavor to the recipe.  Hope that works for others.

Sometimes if I have it on hand I'll add in some Asiago or mozzarella cheese to the breading mixture. I toast the sesame seeds in our toaster oven too. I also like to double bread these... I spray my baking dish with some non-stick spray & drizzle a little olive oil over the chicken before baking. It comes out delicious and crispy every time! I think this is my favorite recipe for breaded chicken!

This went over well with my girls, one of whom gets "sick of" eating chicken.  To add a little additional sesame flavor, I added a couple of drops of sesame oil to the eggs---very tasty!!

This was OK. No bells and whistles. Very simple. I too melted some butter in the dish and had no problem with sticking.  I increased the parmesan cheese for more flavor.

Super easy !  I made the following substitutions (because that's what I had on hand): basil & tomato flavored crumbled feta (instead of the Parmesan), crushed Italian-seasoned croutons (instead of plain bread crumbs).  Plus I added a dash of garlic powder to taste.  Also, I increased bake time to 40 minutes.  Turned out wonderful !

this was not very good in my opinion.  i'm giving it 3 stars because my friend's husband really, really liked them and went back for 2nds.  i did decrease the bread crumbs and increased the paremsan cheese per other reviews.  also added garlic salt, paprika and salt & pepper per other users comments.  didn't have a problem with them sticking as i used a baking stone.

very good.. I added more Parmesan cheese, sesame seeds and added Chinese Five-Spice. I had to cook it at 400 and for 45 minutes because the chicken cutlets I used were huge.

I agree that the breadcrumbs need more spice.  However, I found it to be tasty overall.  I would suggest toasting the seeds before mixing them into the crumbs.

We didn't care for this. First of all, it was bland and second of all, I don't think that the sesame seeds and parmesan chicken went well together. I will stick with more of an Italian Parmesan chicken in the future. Thanks anyway.

It was good...nothing spectacular, but good.  It needs more spices to add flavor.  We added ham and swiss cheese on top with some thyme and that was great.  Another night we topped it with bacon and cheddar cheese, dipping it in BBQ sauce.  Both were very tasty.  The chicken is good as a base, but flavor-wise it needs some props.

This recipe requires some help in the flavour department. Romano can easily be substituted for the Parmesan Cheese. Bread crumbs on their own are pretty tasteless, hence the previous comments by others who rated this dish, so the addition of any of your favourite herbs/spices such as oregano, thyme, paprika, garlic etc to the bread crumbs will definately help out. Also, as others mentioned, melted butter can also lend moistness to chicken breast meat which by nature is sometimes dry. This recipe is basically good, so you should't be afraid to play around with it!!

Well, I have to say the blend of flavors were very good, but it was very dry.  I think it should have called for some butter.  I used Pam in the baking dish since it didn't say anything else.  I wouldn't make this again unless there was a way to get it more moist.

Very moist. To be honest I thought I would come out a bit dry but I was wrong it was moist and tender. I had a lot of bread crumb mix left over so I will use it again.

I've made this before and it always goes down a treat! I add Italian herbs, and black pepper to the Parmesan/sesame/breadcrumbs mixture. If I use beaten egg for dipping, I drizzle a few drops of olive oil over the chicken breasts before cooking- it gives them a more golden colour. Alternatively, I've dipped the chicken in melted butter instead of a beaten egg-very tasty!

I agree that the parmesan/sesame mix may not have been a favourite.  These probably would have been better as chicken strips.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but was disappointed.  The flavor was pretty bland.  I didnt have trouble with the moistness though, as others seemed to have.  Just the flavor was ho-hum.

I had a ton of leftover crumbs and I think with less, I would have tasted the Parmesan and sesame more.  Good classic recipe though.

Very easy and fast to prepare.  As others suggested I reduced the bread crumbs and increased the parmesan and melted some butter in the pan.  I also added garlic powder, salt and pepper, and toasted the sesame seeds before adding them.

This was good, but flavor is quite mild.  I used thighs and added some sesame oil to beaten egg.  Next time try toasting the sesame seeds, and instead of adding sesame oil, try searing chicken in sesame oil and then baking.  2/3's cup of crumbs is plenty for 4 pieces.

It's is pretty easy to prepare but I agree with other reviewers it lacks of flavor. First use less that 1/2n cup of bread crumbs. Then for more flavor use garlic salt, pepper and herbs of provenze or dried basil. Now if you don't add any of the seasing I mentioned befores you can prepare some dipping sauces like: a creamy italian dressing, cesar, mustard and mayonise.
