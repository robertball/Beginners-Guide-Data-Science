Not a bad flavor, though it could use more spice. My biggest problem was that it was mushy. It was very hard to cut into slices or even pieces, and I even added a 1/3 cup more of oatmeal because I couldn't even shape it into anything after mixing all the ingredients together. There really isn't that much different between catsup and a mixture of tomato sauce and chili sauce!

I made this last night and it was great with the following changes.  I beat one egg and added it to the oatmeal, oregano, parsley and pepper.  Didn't have sage, or sour cream.Didn't add any other liquid.  I used 1 tbsp butter to cook 1/2 onion, 1 celery stick, 1/2 red bell pepper and fresh mushrooms.  Mixed it all together and put in loaf dish.  Poured medium heat salsa over the top and baked.  Really good flavors and stayed moist.

My family and I loved this turkey meatloaf. Instead of using fresh vegetables,  I added a bag of frozen chopped onion peppers and celery - a real time saver! This was a bit wetter than a traditional meatloaf while shaping it on the pan, but once it cooked up it held together and sliced beautifully. I highly recommend this recipe. My grown son didn't think he'd like it (ground turkey? YUK!) but he became a real fan!

The flavor was REALLY good. When I made it, it seemed VERY mushy before I put it in the oven. I meal prep for the week so I had another pound of ground turkey in the fridge. I added the entire extra pound & 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs (I ran out of oats when I used the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe). The consistency was perfect after I did so. It came out perfect & the flavor was phenomenal. I'll definitely be making this again but from now on I'll be making it with 2 pounds of turkey. Also, the tomato mixture that is poured on top was WAY too much. I'll probably cut that in half next time & pour it on top halfway through the cooking time as opposed to when first putting it in the oven.

Very good meat loaf. My only complaint like some others is that it was mushy. Will add more oats next time.  My favorite thing about meatloaf is making a sandwich the next day.

Love this recipe! I adjust the veggies based on what's in the fridge. Also, I use Egg Beaters and Panko bread crumbs instead of the comparable items in the recipe. 
Last, I top with the can of tomato sauce, drizzles of Worcestershire as well as drops here and there of A1. 
No matter how you alter this recipe always turns out fabulous. Definitely one of my families favorite.

The recipe as is is good, very good flavor from the veggies.  Changes I made were to omit the V8 and I used 3 Tbl of Sofrito instead. It's firmer and the turkey is already kind of light in texture so it helps keep it from being too soft. I also used additonal veggies i had in the fridge. 

I used fresh mushrooms which worked out well and added about 1/3 of a cup of panko in addition to the oatmeal and it came out perfect. Watch the liquid ingredients and you should be fine

I've never made meatloaf with anything but bread crumbs. The use of rolled oats, so much better... will definately be making this again!

I used black beans in lieu of mushrooms; my family members aren’t too fond of the latter.  It worked out fine.

Our favorite, great for a week night, I usually put a few more veggies in it (carrot, peas etc) and spice it up a bit as we like our food spicy.  Easy and tasty.

Great! Did not use the sour cream. Used jalapeño catsup and 8 oz of tomato sauce in place of the chili sauce and v8. Doubled the recipe and made one meatloaf for my in-law’s and one for us. Will definitely make again. I love that it uses fresh vegetables.

Not bad overall but it was mushy and didn’t hold its shape. There were way too many vegetables in it as well. If I was to make this again I would cut the veggies in half at least.

Followed most of the recipe. ( didn’t have V8 so used tomato juice) Did add Panko since it seemed pretty moist . With 20 mins. left to bake I put B.B. sauce on top. It was delicious.

Very tasty dish, even without the green pepper (that I didn’t have). Might use fresh rather than canned mushrooms the next time....the pieces were so big that the meatloaf was a bit crumbly. I’ll cut the mushrooms in smaller pieces next time.

My family raved over this meatloaf!  I did add just a bit of heat with a few pepper flakes,  and I used a red bell pepper, don't care for green, that may have sweetened it up a bit. will def make again, and again!

My experience was similar to others. It was very mushy and hard to handle but it firmed up after cooking but is still very moist.  I will definitely add more turkey meat and oats or bread crumbs next time. The flavor was fabulous. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used canned Tomato Soup and left out the chili sauce. I'll make it again.

Making it now again. So tasty! I didn't have chili sauce on hand so I substituted a little A1. I doubled the recipe and will do so again. Like others it seemed mushy, but when cooked on a grate / broiler rack it firmed right up.

It was the best turkey meatloaf I've ever made! I omitted the hot sauce, substituted orange bell pepper for the green pepper, and used fresh mushrooms (sautéed with the other veggies) instead of canned.  I have sent the recipe to family and friends and will definitely make it again.  It made a large loaf and the leftover portions heated up well in the microwave.

This was wonderful! I left out the sour cream and substituted soy sauce for the Worcestershire sauce. Since I can't eat onions, I used lots of scallions. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is delicious!  My husband and I are doing the QWL diet so I had to make some modifications.  I pureed a tomato and made bread crumbs in place of the tomato juice and rolled oats.  Had to omit the sour cream.  Used all fresh vegetables: green onion, celery, peppers and mushrooms.  Did not put the sauce on top.  We will definitely be enjoying this again.  It was incredible and sliced up nicely.

There were a few ingredients that I didn't have so made it without them. It turned out great even my picky granddaughter liked it and had 2nd's . I will sure make it again with all the right ingredients.

Made this recipe as called for, worth trying again.  During the second making I modified it to my families preferences bread crumbs instead of oatmeal, less sage, added garlic granules, split salt with half sea salt and other half celery salt, omitted veggies except onion and finally topped with ketchup and BBQ sauce mixture.
