Have not tried this recipe, but, very similar to my grandmothers. Correct in saying (don't work the do too much. Best cookie in the known universe. My wife bakes a double batch every year for Christmas.

Made the cookies, used 1 rounded TSP of raisins per cookie and had  a lot of raisins left after making 30 cookies; cookie part was good not enough raisin filling. Will increase filling in each cookie if I make these again.

The dough was fine (used 1 cup of coconut oil instead of crisco) but the filling did not turn out. My recommendation will be to cook the flour, raisins, and brown sugar on the stove to make a syrup before filling the cookies. Going to try it that way next time.
