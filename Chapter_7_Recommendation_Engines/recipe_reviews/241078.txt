Roasted Cajun Cauliflower Haiku: "We couldn't eat this, it was just way too salty. Made us very sad." We were unable to eat this cauliflower b/c of the insane saltiness, from the garlic salt, Cajun seasoning, and regular salt. W/ a drastic reduction in garlic salt (if not exchanging it altogether, as the other reviewers did) this cauliflower would be good, but I'd give it zero stars as written b/c it was inedible.

We made this last Saturday,  the only thing we changed was instead of garlic salt, we used garlic powder.  Ours turned out a little bit blackend, but everyone loved it and even the guys that don't normally eat cauliflower,  took seconds and thirds.
Next time I will cook for 10 min uncovered.

Taking into account other reviews saying it was too salty changed it up a little. Only about a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning, garlic powder instead of garlic salt and a 1/4 cup of hot sauce. It was a good alternative to boring cauliflower.

As stated in earlier reviews, way too salty as made. Cutting Cajun seasoning in half and using garlic powder worked really well. I also used a garlic Parmesan seasoning that I buy from Costco (johnnys) in place of the Cajun and garlic and it turned out really good. Overall, good method, we didn't used to like or eat cauliflower!

Way over cooked in time allotted.
I liked the concept of Cajun flavoring.
Would cook at a lower temperature just with Cajun seasoning and garlic powder.
Add salt to taste afterwords.

I tried this tonight and it was delicious. My husband and I both liked it. I used minced garlic from a jar instead of garlic salt because I didn't have the garlic salt and liked it a lot. Will be making this again.
