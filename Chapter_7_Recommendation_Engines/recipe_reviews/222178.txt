I could only give this three stars because as written, it is pretty bland, soupy and tasteless.  However, the hubby and I both love curry so I experimented and came up with what I believe is a 5-star dish.  I used two cans of 13.5oz coconut milk, about 1/2 cup of chicken broth, about 1 cup matchstick carrots, diced yellow potatoes, 3 yellow onions diced, about 1 tblsp freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 cup plus 2 tblsp curry, 1 tblsp of chopped garlic and sea salt to taste.  I did not dice the chicken breasts since the slow cooker makes the chicken so tender.  The last hour I added the red bell pepper, about a 1 and half cups of sweetened flake coconut and the cornstarch which probably wasn't needed but did thicken it a bit more.  I then served it over white rice made with milk, water and butter.  These changes made this an awesome dish though probably not very low calorie.  However, the flavor was perfect and reminded me of a good vegetarian Vietnamese dish (basically veggies in a coconut broth).  I know I could have made this without the crock pot but am always looking for slow cook recipes to help with busy schedules.  Cook on Sunday, eat leftovers most of the week.  :)

Best slow cooker recipe I have ever found! Usually I hate using slow cookers because they never come out the same as if I cooked it traditionally. I made this exactly to the recipe and served it over jasmine rice. My whole family loved it, including my kids ages 6 and 8. This one is definitely a keeper and will come in handy for those busy afternoons!

I made this recipe as written, with the exception of adding more bell peppers.  Maybe I am just accustomed to spicy food, but I found this dish to be extremely bland.

Wonderful!  I served this with some rice and it was so flavorful and satisfying.  My husband loved it, he was a little miffed that I took some leftover for lunch!

This was a good base curry recipe if you are starting to try curries.  Loved the fact that it was made in the crockpot.  We will make this again, but add more kick to it next time.  Even the kids that do not like heat said that it was just bland. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bland as in no flavor, it just needs a boost.

I made this today, and I enjoyed it.  I added more bell peppers - different colors to make it look a little more appetizing.  Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe as stated.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe for someone learning how to make a delish curry. I've always had to go out for something like this since my family isn't too big on "exotic" food. My 10 and 12 year old daughters and hubby LOVED it, even our 12 year old neighbor who stayed for dinner.
The only thing I changed was to use a can of chicken broth rather than 1 cup, this way I had a lot more of the yummy gravy to enjoy with my naan.
Will definitely make this again, especially the next covered dish night I host.

This is a good, basic curry recipe. I love curry, but I've been hesitant to actually try making one - glad I took the chance on this. I realized too late that I had forgotten the potatoes, but since I added some fresh mushrooms, I didn't really miss the spuds. And after tasting mid-way through cooking, I did add a bit of chipotle-garlic olive oil to kick up the spice a little. (I am always so amazed - and dismayed - by the reviews I read complaining of "blandness." One person's bland is another's 5-alarm fire, and it's ALWAYS up to the cook to taste along the way and adjust seasonings accordingly!) After making the house smell wonderful during cooking, I served this over rice with coconut flakes and cashews sprinkled on top - wonderful late lunch.

Great recipe for Chicken Curry lovers! I added one can of pineapple chunks and a trio of colored peppers, red, orange, yellow to kick up the visual appeal. I also had a can of thick coconut cream (Trader Joes)on hand so I threw in two large spoonfuls of that for extra richness but the recipe is great as is. I used skin on browned chicken thighs as that is what I had on hand and the meat just fell off the bone and was very tender. If you like a colorful dish use your food processor and mince some carrot up fine then add the last twenty minutes of cooking time. This is good served over jasmine rice.

It sounded so good, and I like all of the components, but man, it was hard to eat. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out to taste very strongly of curry powder and nothing else.  In an effort to not waste the entire dish, my husband and I sprinkled some cashews on top of our servings and that helped a lot - to make it edible - but after eating it once, I was not up for working my way through all those leftovers. I imagine that the curry powder is a big variable. There is such a range of strengths from one to the next that I wonder if the one I used was just way too powerful or something? I would recommend starting with a smaller amount of curry powder than called for.

I made this for friends who have a stay in Pakistan in their background.  It tasted good, but was terribly bland.  Fortunately, I made it a day ahead and had time to add at least a tablespoon of garam masala and a pinch of ground cayenne.  Made it a tiny bit spicy, and gave it much more depth of flavor.  Didn't use potatoes, but did add a can of garbanzos, drained.

It won't let me give zero stars. This recipe was terrible! So bland. I had to add so many things to it to make it edible. Glad I only wasted one pound of chicken, not the two it has listed. It wouldn't have made enough sauce anyway.

This was decent, but nothing great. I made it exactly as written, using just over 2 pounds of chicken breasts, 2 "White Rose" potatoes, a white onion, and the chicken broth was made from a bouillon cube dissolved in a cup of boiling water.
This made a lot of food - I served it over cooked brown "Texmati" rice, and it lasted for 5 meals. I prefer really hot curries, so even with 1/4 cup of curry powder here, I found the flavors slightly bland.
It was good enough - just didn't wow me.

It was OK. Not really as much flavor as I would have liked. I'll try again with some modifications to see what I can do because it's not a bad base. I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars.

I read all the reviews before beginning, so I also added julienned carrots when I added the chopped red pepper. I also veganized it by using Butler's Soy Curls. I used a tiny bit more water as I did not know if the soy curls would soak up more liquid (I had re-hydrated them first). I did NOT add in the corn starch as I wanted the rice to soak up all the goodness. I did add 2T of brown sugar, which was unnecessary if you used the raisins. Would make this again with tofu it is delicious!

Delicious and healthy! My whole family loved this dish. I added a spoon of turmeric just because I had it and wanted to use some of it up. Added veg I had on hand, like carrots, peas, amd mushrooms. Made 4 cups of basmati rice. We ate it for several days. We will be making this one often!

This was an awesome dish and I got lots of compliments on it!  

Using what I had, I used chicken leg & thigh quarters.  I omitted the raisins and the shredded coconut.  I did add some turmeric.

I am rather proud of myself and will be making this dish again!

ultimately the veggies came out fine, but I agree with all the others; it’s extremely bland. if you like spice or complexity in your she’s, go with another.

A delicious recipe and so easy to prepare. The great thing about curry is that when you serve it you can add anything you like such as cashews, raisins, even sliced banana, to enhance the meal.

As some comments said the dish was bland, I added more ingredients at first go and it was delicious.:
Matchstick carrots, Cardamon Pods, Star Anaise Bay, Cumin, and a bit more curry powder and raisins than recipie recommended.
Used coconut cream instead of milk, and didn’t need the cornflower.
Omitted the bell pepper as didn’t have any.
Would make again but use sweet potatoes instead of usual,.... delicious!

Next time, I’ll sub more of chicken broth for  coconut milk to create creamy sauce and more red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.

Have no idea what went wrong. The broth was actually pretty awesome before I threw the chicken in and left for the day. I came home and the house smelled awesome but everything was just thin and watery and bland. We ended up going out for dinner. I did save it. Maybe if I throw it on the stove top and reduce it a bit and add more seasoning it might be good. Sorry-just wasnt the taste I was looking for.

We never had chicken curry so I didn't really know what to expect and I tried it without the raisins and coconut topping first, then with it.  much better with it.  still I didn't care for it that much but it wasn't terrible or bad or anything, just kinda spicy.  the green color was a bit strange to us also.  now I'm glad we made it because the second time I had it later that evening I loved it.  maybe it grew on me? idk?  but yummy!!!  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it was a bit too much onion and spicy.

After reading other reviews I knew this wasn't going to be spicy enough for us. I added more curry, lots of red pepper flakes, and will add additional spice on the next go around! Very good base to start from and make your own

Decent start for curry chicken, but wow was this unbelievably bland.  There's very little flavor. Any recommendations is greatly appreciated.

I tried to modify this to accommodate two large bone-in skinless chicken breasts... Had it on low for four hours and added the red peppers at hour 4, cooked 45 more minutes, then added  cornstarch and cooked for the last 15 minutes as recipe suggested. The chicken unfortunately tasted over-cooked.. . . I feel that perhaps I needed to recalculate / adjust the  total cooking time to no longer than 4 hours.  Otherwise the flavours were all there. I will try again.

Pros: I was amazed that this recipe actually has a 1/4 c of curry powder in it.  I thought it was a mistake but added 1/4 c anyway.  1/4 c is about the amount in the average size spice bottle.  This recipe is easy to use as a base.  I rarely follow a recipe without making my own changes.  My changes were incorporated into the recipe easily and included adding carrots, eggplant and chick peas.  I also added a cinnamon stick and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  I made Basmati rice to go with it and used 1/2 water and 1/2 of the curry broth to cook it in. 

Cons:  The recipe instructions are vague.  Specifically what type and size are the potatoes?  I used red potatoes and they worked fine.  I did a web search and found that 2 potatoes equal about 2 cups of potatoes.  Since my potatoes were small I added 2 cups of potatoes which was about 4 of the type of potatoes I used.  The recipe also doesn’t indicate the type or the actual amount of onion needed.  I added 2 small yellow onions because that is what I had on hand.  

I was pleased with my version of this recipe but will be looking for other chicken recipes to try in the future.

Perhaps I need a better brand of Jamaican Curry Powder. I also overcooked the chicken. Not bad, but I'm seeking GREAT!

As written, this did not work for me at all. I put it in my slow cooker for 4 hours on low, and when I added the peppers, the potatoes were not even close to done. I switched it to high and the potatoes are still not done two hours later.

I guess it might work better if you cut your potatoes into tiny pieces, smaller than the ~1 inch cubes I used, but I'm not likely to try it again.

It is quite easy, and very tasty. The one drawback is the potatoes did not cook fully even after 5 hours. Perhaps I needed to cut it into smaller pieces. Yes, I will try again.

This was really quick and easy. The only thing I changed was I left out the peppers. Hubby's not big pepper fan. It was still great. Thanks for sharing :)

I made this with a few adjustments and we loved it!  I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes and added carrots and a yellow bell pepper.  I also added cayenne pepper, thai seasoning and jamaican jerk seasoning.  It came out wonderfully, with a bit of a kick.  Served over brown rice and it was an easy dinner we can't wait to repeat.

I enjoyed this but skimped on the curry powder and only used 2 tsps. No one in the family really likes curry except me. I used the correct amount of chicken broth but found it to be very liquid, more like a stew, not sure I enjoy the potatoes. Made a side of Thai white rice and mixed the rice into the slow cooker when everything was done, didn't really want two starches/potatoes/rice but needed the rice to soak up some of the liquid. Needed salt to taste afterward. Added raisins and coconut on top and stirred it in too. I think adding the raisins to the cooking in the last few minutes might add a bit of sweetened flavour as well. Good but not amazing.

It's ok, I followed the recipe that maralina posted. I feel like it needed something zesty. Ginger and lime maybe. I'll try that next time. Also I added a TBSP of crush red pepper for an extra kick but I'm a spicy lover. Idk. Try it out and let's see if we would find that zest it needs.

Very good recipe but as others observed, it was a bit bland for me as is. I stir fried onions and garlic and also added red chili powder to give it an extra kick. I'll definitely make it again!

I took the advice of others and used 2 extra Tbls of Curry Powder, I added a pinch of dried Curry leaves, added sweet potatoes, and used boneless/skinless thighs.  Like others I added the potatoes in the last 1-2 hours. I cooked it 8 hours on low.  Next time I'll use lite coconut milk to save calories.  Needs more salt, but yummy on a cold night!

This recipe is awesome!! I added jerk spice and chille peppers as suggested and it added just enough spice. I have tried it without making those additions and found it a little bland for my taste but still very good! I would highly recommend this recipe.

This dish was only meh.  It was edible but pretty bland and too much liquid.  Never really thickened even with the cornstarch.  I followed the recipe closely.  I had made some curry quinoa along with it and it was more palatable if I mixed those together (absorbs some of the excess liquid at least).

This was pretty good, but I agree with other reviewers that it was bland.  I followed the recipe except that I used sweet potatoes (it's all I had at home) and added an extra pepper. At the end I added cashews with the raisins and coconut flakes.  Good, but missing something.

This was a great recipe - I made it with shrimp as I don't eat chicken and I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I cooked for 4 + hours as opposed to 5+ hours.  I added cauliflower 2 hours into cooking and added the red pepper and shrimp 3 hours into cooking.  15 minutes before serving, I added  a tablespoon of mustard seed (give a neat texture),  cliantro and the coconut milk.  I added the cornstarch too to add thickness.   I also added 3/4 tablespoon of cumin and a teaspoon of cardamom powder as well as garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic.  Very yummy!

I agree with the other reviewers, a bit bland, wish I had read reviews first! BUT, that said, it was put together in no time and tasted fine, next time I will just spruce it up a bit! The raisins did not work for me, coconut flakes add a nice touch.

This was the first time I made curry chicken in a slow cooker. It wasn't bad. But it was a little watery so I did add flour I stead of cornstarch. I also added a little hot sauce and ketchup. Along with the red peppers I added some peas and it turned out pretty good.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews. I used 3 chicken quarters, 1/4 Curry Powder + 2T. I didn't want to open a box of broth and had a can of chicken broth and used it all so not to waste any. I set it on low 8 hrs in u crock and when I got back to it, it was falling off the bone delish!!! Will surely do again.

I love curry , but the recipe needs more flavor and veggies. Next time I will add heat, bamboo shoots, shallots, green peppers and less chicken broth. But I did love this concept. Super easy also.

I made the recipe as is, but added the raisins in with the bell pepper so they would plump up. I served it over jasmine rice. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

This ended up really bland. It smelled amazing but everyone that tasted it (5 adults) said it needed more flavor. I was bummed. Next time I am going to add pineapple and a few more spices.

I've made this several times and every time I'm surprised at how good it is! My husband loves it too and there is always plenty for leftovers.

It was very easy to make. I may leave out the raisins next time for the people who aren't raisin lovers. Thanks for the recipe! :o)

A little bland, maybe more pepper next time, but everything turned out well.
