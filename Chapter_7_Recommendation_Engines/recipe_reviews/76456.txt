Since I like tuna and refried beans separately, I decided to give this a try, even though I couldn't picture these two ingredients together.  As I suspected, this combination was too strange for me.  I'm still giving it 3 stars for 2 reasons.  One is that the recipe, made exactly as written, was edible, although not enjoyable.  Two is that I thought this was great with cheese substituted for the tuna, which is how I ate the rest of it after the first serving.  That creates a different recipe, but I love the cheese version.

this dish tastes great. the combination of the zesty taste of the tuna with the creamy refried beans gives the dish a very distinct texture. i highly recommend it.

This recipe has some good points to it, but overall does not work well together. I like the creaminess of the beans, and I also like the tuna lime mixture, but they absolutely do not taste good combined.

These are quick and easy to make. I used solid white Albacore packed in water. The creaminess of the refried beans pair well with the tuna and lime. If you use a good quality tuna don't be afraid to make this.

I made these for my family tonight (picky teenagers included). I used canned albacore tuna and refried black beans.  We made one and split it between us as a trial since we were leery about the combination.  Everyone loved it!  I doubled the recipe for our family of 5 and we ate just about all of it.
