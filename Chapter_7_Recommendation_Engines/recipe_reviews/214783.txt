These were great!! My kids ate them as soon as I got them out of the oven. I baked them at 350 for 10-15 minutes. Nice and crisp!

never liked kale until now!    My friend advised me to set temperature in dehydrator to 130 and let it go about an hour longer.  Awesome!

Undeniably delicious!  I don't have a food dehydrator, so I baked them in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. The texture was ok - but not all were crispy, and they were starting to get browned on the edges.  So next time I'll try them at a lower heat for a longer time, as suggested in the directions.

Delicious! I hadn't had kale in years, but picked some up the other day for something different. Unfortunately, it doesn't make enough at one time! I baked them on 350 for 10 minutes and then flipped them over and baked them for another 7 to get them nice and crispy.

Tasty.  I used coconut oil in place of olive oil and I didn't have any lemon.
I would make these again and thanks for the recipe.

A very easy and healthy snack especially when made in the dehydrator at suggested temp, lets you keep all the nutrients.  Normally I don't care for kale but these are yummy.

These taste nice, but because there isn't a definitive amount of kale called for, there is way too much oil on these.

Super simple.  My kids really liked it. I followed other's suggestions snd cooked it at 350 for about 10 minutes. I stirred it and cooked another 5 minutes but a few pieces started to burn so I took it out. It was still soggy though. Next time I will cook it on a lower temp for longer (like the directions say) and see if  I can get it crispier.
