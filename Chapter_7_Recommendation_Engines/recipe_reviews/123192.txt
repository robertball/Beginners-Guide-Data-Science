Light, refreshing dessert, especially nice after a heavy or spicy meal.  However, I found this almost too much like just a lemon-flavored whipped cream.  I would like to see this sweeter, with bolder lemon and especially lime flavors and maybe half the whipped cream.

I thought this tasted delicious. And like another reviewer mentioned, it actually can be used as icing! After I finished the recipe I couldn't believe it was enough to feed 6 people, but a little does go a long way with this mouse because it's so rich. It's perfect as a refreshing treat after a big meal. It's tart but sweet and quite refreshing! I served fanned strawberries on top.

Very very sweet and tangy at the same time. You can really taste the lemon and lime. It was delicious, but I think it would be much better as the filling inside of a nice vanilla layer cake.

I made a large batch of this with fresh limes from my tree and served it in meringue shells with a small amount of fresh blackberry sauce drizzled over.  It was amazing and I got recipe requests from all my "lunch bunch"!  The next day I served the extra in a pavlova shell with fresh berries and the sauce on top and got more raves!

This was absolutely amazing!!  I am a lemon-anything lover and this was fabulous!  Make sure to constantly stir on low-medium while on the stove, I walked away and it burned the first time!!!  I made about 6 hours ahead of time and it was perfect!!

I tried this for a dinner party because I could make it in the morning and leave it in the fridge and it was brilliant.  I couldn't get any decent limes, so used only lemons.  I suspect that depending on how sour your lemon and limes, you may need to adjust your sugar - for me it was perfect though.  This is quite rich, so a little goes a long way for most people.  Will definitely make again.

Makes what I would consider 5-6 servings.  Place in dessert glass using a pastry bag with a wide piping attachment.  Added a sprig of mint and a raspberry or blackberry as garnish.  Can easily make many hours ahead, but I prefer to not leave it in the fridge overnight-- I feel that the whipped cream texture is nicer when the mousse is not so 'old.'

The adults enjoyed this, although it was closer to a custard than a mousse.  If I make it again I will not use grated rind, which was a little much, but use a lesser amount of zest.

This recipe was GREAT! It was very easy and didn't take long. As others mentioned - definitely keep an eye on the ingredients while they are on the stove as they can quickly be burned. Careful stirring and all the sudden it changes consistency/color and soon after it is done. We put frozen raspberries on it as well and it was fantastic!

Made this for my parents and family.  Very good but I did add a bit more fresh lime and lemon juice because we like more tang and lemon lime flavour.  We had a big rib feast so it was a nice light desert after such a rich meal.

I made this recipe a day ahead, and I think this was important to the texture and consistency. It turned out well, but I do agree with some other users that it is a bit sweet. No one complained, though!

This is a light, creamy, tangy dessert.  We all loved it, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that a bit less whipped cream would make this even better.  UPDATE: I made this recipe as written and used as a filling for a 9x12 butter cake with "Grocery Store Frosting."  It was fabulous.  If you use this as a filling don't forget to refrigerate the cake once assembled!

I didn't have fresh lemons/limes, just bottled juice, so I left out the peels, which I think mellowed out the flavor a bit. Could be good or bad, depending on your preference, but I was hoping for a little more zing to balance the sugar. As with most mousses, it will serve more than you think, due to richness - I like to serve it in champagne glasses with long sundae spoons, or in double-shot glasses, garnished with berries of some kind. Blueberries on lemon = like the muffin!

Great recipe! The only thing I did differently was combine everything stright into the bowl and then transfer it all to a saucepan to cook. I used it as a filling for a cake and everyone was throughly impressed, and I couldn't help sneaking myself a bowl before =D

This is my go to recipe! I completely replace the lemon juice with lime, then use it as a filling for white chocolate cupcakes. I top it with a white chocolate cream cheese icing! They are a hit every time!

This is a wonderful spring dessert-rich & citrusy.  I served in ramekins w/ shortbread & fresh blackberries.  Everyone loved it and relatively easy to make.  I really like the lemony flavor, so if you want to tone it down, you could prob omit the peel.

Very tart and smooth recipe- excellent dessert for summer!   Only substitution I used was to whip heavy cream instead of whipping cream- its what I had on hand and came out great.

Light and luscious. My kids really liked this. I used soy milk to make this dairy free and freshly-squeezed lemon juice, which I highly recommend. I didn't have limes so just used extra lemon juice and peel and it was excellent.

It is a light dessert. Great dessert for summertime especially after a BBQ. If you like lemon this will satisfy your taste buds. The serving for 6 actually turned out to be a small portion for serving of 4. I had to put each serving in a very small individual glass bowl that was just a little bit more than a third of a cup per. Otherwise it was very tasty!!!

This was tasty and fairly easy to make.  To us, it tasted similar to key lime pie filling.  Texturally we felt this dessert needed crunch, so we ended up dipping graham crackers in it and that worked well for us.

Wonderful refreshing dessert for hot weather. I put the full recipe in four clear irish coffee mugs, because it was sooo good, six servings would have been too small.

I made this for a party...doubled the recipe and put spoonfuls in plastic wine cups...guest LOVED it and commented on how refreshing it was with the lemon taste.
