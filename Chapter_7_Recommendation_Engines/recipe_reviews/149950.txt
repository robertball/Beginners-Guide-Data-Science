We loved this recipe!  I usually make the traditional puttanesca, with anchovies, but the arrabbiata style gave it a unique twist.  Since it is winter, and fresh tomatoes are virtually flavorless, I used two 14.5 oz cans of diced garlic flavored tomatoes, drained, instead.  I also used herbed feta for the topping because that's what I had in the fridge.  I didn't add any extra salt, since the olives, capers and cheese are already high in sodium.  I also cooked an extra cup of rigatoni and the recipe served three adults as a main course. My "purist" Italian husband had a philosophical issue with using feta instead of a traditional Italian cheese, but it is excellent as written and I will definitely make it again.

I made this then stuck in crockpot for hours to simmer.  Added 1/2 cup red wine, more garlic, and Italian seasoning, had to skip the artichokes because I didn't have any, used crimini mushrooms instead.  Served with baked chicken leg sections and spaghetti squash.  Very tasty..

Tried this tonight and thought it was fantastic. I had to substitute canned tomatoes and green olives because that was what I had. But will definitely try it with the kalamata olives and fresh tomatoes next time. It was also quick and simple to make which is always a plus. Thanks Kelly for a keeper.

A very nice change from the ordinary, and a good use for feta (one I never would have thought of myself) thank you. I was apprehensive in making this dish for my toddler and husband, but they both enjoyed it. I had to omit the olives and capers today and the flavour remained very good. Next time I will add more then a pinch of red pepper flakes maybe 1/4 tsp.

this was very tasty.   I used applewood bacon from Trader Joes, I did not add capers or olives as I don't care for them.  I did add a can of black olives and a jar of artichoke marinated in oil and added it to the whole mix. I use really nice cherry tomatoes cut up from Trader Joes and some Tomato and basil Feta chesse. Instead of parsley I used fresh basil because it is what I had on hand. Thank you for this recipe it was a hit.

Delicious!  I loved this.  Hubs, not so much.  I was doubtful he'd like it, though, as he is not a fan of this type of flavor, olives, or capers.  I was using up some artichokes, though, so thought I'd try it on him and see.  He ate it but wasn't overly thrilled.  That's okay; I LOVE the flavor, and I'll eat this for lunch leftovers.  I doubled the recipe and got five servings of this.  I also used canned tomatoes (2 cans) instead of fresh and added more olives (whole, so I could pick them out for hubs).  I did think the feta was good, but maybe a tad overkill; there's so many strong flavors in here, that Parmesan or mozzarella might work even better.  You need to like all of these ingredients separately in order to like them in this dish.  Thanks for the recipe!
