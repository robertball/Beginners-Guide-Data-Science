This recipe is easily adapted to what veggies you have in your frigde.  I often use broccoli, onions, red peppers, tomatoes -- whatever  flavors are in the fridge and go well together.  It's really easy to make.  The Parmesan cheese on top gives it a nice touch.

Love this recipe! I added a jar of artichoke hearts and don't forget the 1/2 cup chopped shallot's (not listed in the recipe). I also minced up some garlic and mixed it with 1 tblsp. of olive oil and added it to the wheat crust to give it a little flavor. The recipe turned out great, tasted delicious and it's healthy too!
