I read pretty much all the reviews and decided to make it anyway.  I added an extra box of pudding mix.  The mixture was kind of thick but worked out well. I read how this wasn't very flavorful and too cake like.  That's why I added the extra pudding.  Everyone loved it.  I also didn't add the cherries, food coloring, cinnamon, or sugar.  Instead I mixed brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped pistachios and layered it between and on top of the bread mixture and swirled it through with a knife.  Came out great.

I would say this tasted very cake like.  I didn't use any green coloring (it was still green due to the pudding coloring) or the cherries and liked the flavor.  I also used low fat sour cream.

Deeeeeeeeeeelicious!!!!!!! so moist and colorful, I just loved it, and so did everyone who tasted it. I added an extra 1/2 cup chopped marraschino cherries to the mix. After that I made a cheese & cherry frosting with an 8oz. package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/3 cup margarine, softened it all up, beat it until well incorporated and then added 1/2 cup pureed marraschino cherries, it made a beautiful soft pink frosting, topped with some more cherries and VOILA!!! the flavor mix was great, thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe.

Excellent. I added whole pistachio nuts to the batter and topped the bread with finely chopped pistachios with the cinnamon sugar. This will be a big seller at our Church's Bake Sale this spring!

This bread is divine!  I have made it many times, and every time I am asked for the recipe.  It is SO good.  I am not a fan of marschino cherries, so I left them out.  I also dusted the bottom of the pan with the cinnamon/sugar  mixture.  You HAVE to try this bread.  It is SO good.

I made this exactly by the recipe.
Is is very good and would be great to make for St. Patrick's day.  If I were making it for Christmas, I would probably add more cherries just for the contrast.  We don't care for overly sweet treats so this was perfect for our taste.  It
reminds me of a pound cake and would probably be good served with fresh fruit.

Couldn't find an 18.25 oz yellow cake mix anywhere, so I used a Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme mix which was the correct weight.  All of the yellow cake mixes now are somewhere in the range of 15.25 to 16.25 oz., the same old trick that so many manufacturers are using now...cutting back qty/volume.   The batter was REALLY thick, and I'm a little surprised that it turned out as light and moist as it did.  What you'll end up with is something that tastes like the cake mix, and the texture is like cake, not a bread.  Recipe didn't say to do anything with the cherries, but I did slice them in half thinking I'd get better cherry distribution throughout the batter.  I made one loaf and the rest into muffins (or cupcakes might be more accurate).  This recipe is colorful, fun, easy, and definitely a conversation piece.

Very tasty...  It was the hit of our brunch.  People went back for seconds, thirds and fourths.  I omitted the cherries and food coloring and made a streusel topping which was wonderful.  It is more of a cake than a bread but, who cares, it's fabulous.

Wow-I can see why it is rated #1!!  It is sooo simple and quick.  The flavor is very unique and the bread is so moist - melts in your mouth!!  The cinnamon sugar is a nice mild touch to keep it simple. My boyfriend ate half the loaf right out of the oven!  It's a crowd pleaser!

This bread was wonderful!  My father loves anything pistachio, and he really loved this.  The rest of the family loved it too.  I left out the cherries, and it was still great.  I have made it numerous times, and it never lasts more than 24 hours!!

This is a very tasty recipe but it sure is GREEN!  I think next time I will add only a few drops of food coloring and some chopped pistachios.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I have been looking for this particular one for awhile!  The recipe was easy and quick to prepare and the taste is fantastic.  Some people are a bit apprehensive to eat green bread, but once they have a piece, they are back for more!  Everything about this recipe is great-you have got to try it!

This recipe is excellent.  The bread comes out a beautiful bright green color and looks very pretty when sliced.  Perfect for holidays such as St Patty's Day or Christmas.  My daughter loved making this bread with me - it was very kid friendly.  The texture is moist and the taste is lightly sweet.  Terrific recipe.

This was a HUGE hit with my family!  My husband  proclaimed it "the best bread you ever made!"   We quickly gobbled up the first loaf and froze the other for "later"...which turned out to be only a few days away!  mmmmm!

I wasn’t sure what to expect from this, but it was delicious.  It is NOT super pistachio-y.  The cherries added a lot to it.  Next time I will coat the cherries in a little flour to try to keep them from sinking to the bottom. I cut the cherries into eighths.  The food coloring is good in this because otherwise it would be a strange shade of light greenish-brown.  Since this has a cake mix as a base, I expected it to be cakey but in my opinion, it wasn’t.  It was a little less tender than cake, a little more dense, just like a sweet bread should be!  I’ll still mostly make variations of pumpkin bread, but I’ll keep this in mind when we want something a little different. I also think I’m going to bake it in a bundt next time.  It’s such a fun color and I think it would look nice on a cake stand, with a slice cut out of it.

I made it just like the recipe stated. I used real sour cream, not low fat. When I put it in the oven, I had forgotten to put the cinnamon sugar on top. Five minutes into baking, I was cleaning up, and saw the sugar mix on the counter. I added it on top of the bread. It may have disrupted the rising of the bread because it was not as tall as I had expected. The sugar cinnamon mix was a delicious extra on top despite the oops. I found the bread to be extremely moist and the maraschino cherries just enough of  a surprise extra. I don’t think I will change the recipe at all with the exception of adding the sugar prior to putting it in the oven.

Okay, I just wanted to make a bread with cake mix + pudding, so I used the smaller sized carrot cake mix , vanilla pudding mix and added toasted walnuts and half a grated carrot.  I did not put anything on top.  Used two *8 X 4 pans and baked them for 50 minutes.  Turned out really good.

I actually didn't eat it because I'm allergic to nuts but my bf and everyone else loved it! I left out the cherries and added chopped pistachios on top. After the second day, it got a bit dry but was still good, apparently.

It's fine. Just tastes like a normal sponge cake, can't taste the pistachio at all. Will try adding actual ground pistachios next time.

Very tasty, everyone loves this bread! People who are a bit apprehensive are completely surprised at the great taste and very moist.

I love it. I make it every year for our bake sale & it is always the first to go. I don't add the green coloring & I add nuts.

Very good.   Added more cinnamon to sprinkle.   Would be good for Christmas with the colors.

My mom makes this bread it tastes and smells so good even my 11 yr old daughter (read:picky eater) had to sneak a bite then she loved it!  We like extra "crunch" on the top and more cinnamon throughout but not necessary.

I've made this several times now and my family loves it. I even made mini loaves to give for Christmas this year. I passed on the recipe to my aunts and they've made it for parties and got great reviews also. One crumbled the bread up and mixed it with pudding...said it was very good.

Very tasty - I left the food coloring out, as the pudding mix made it green enough.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.  My husband will ask when I'm making "the green bread."

I was really excited to find this recipe, and it tasted very good, but I was disappointed because it didn't really have a pistachio flavor.  I even added almond extract, and the bread was very moist, but there was really not a noticeable almond/pistachio flavor.

I also omitted the food coloring (there really is no need for it), and I used non-fat sour cream. It was more cakelike than bread, but my husband and I agree it is very good. I would add some nuts next time and top with cool whip.

I have been baking this recipe for the holidays for a few years now and everyone LOVES IT!  This is one of the BEST recipes I have ever found!  A HUGE HIT!  Even people who don't usually like the pistachio flavor love this!

Quick and easy recipe.  It was more of a cake than a bread.  I skipped the food coloring

Delicious. My whole family loved it. My husband told me this is one of the best breads I ever made. It is so moist you won't believe it. I chopped the cherries as noted in an earlier review and I know the 2 loaves won't last 2 days. Great recipe.

This is a REALLY good, sweet bread. But, chop the cherries and add them into the dry stuff before adding the wet stuff.  Next time I'll add nuts, too.

This recipe is the best there is.  I have been looking for this recipe for around 6 years.  Thank you so much.  This is the best dessert, snack or appetizer there is.  It is even great to take to work for breakfast on the go.  I always double the recipe.
