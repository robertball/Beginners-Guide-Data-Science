I made the sauce described in this recipe this weekend to eat over an andoille hash with poached eggs. While the sauce was easy and smooth it was a little bland. I put a lot more than a dash of hot sauce and it still needed a little something else.

I made the recipe and added the photo. I was forced to crop it so - - I will say this: There's a lot of variables to this dish. Basically the sausage cheese and hot sauce. I made it exactly as the recipe called for w/good Parmesan (Not in a can) butcher shop sausage & Crystal Hot Sauce (2 Tbl). It was pretty good. Not "Knock Your Socks Off Good" but not bad. The only think I varied was the eggs. I like mine lookin' atcha.

All these ingredients are great individually as a meal (love me some andouille sausage).. the sauce is a little weak for me I like a mighty roundhouse kick from my sauces haha good breakfast.. buuut I wouldnt classify this as a 'eggs benedict' dish

I LOVED this - I'm always looking for variations on Eggs Benedict and this one tops them all by far.

We definitely have a winner here! The only change I made was to make low carb biscuits instead of buttermilk. Everything melds together so nicely. Great recipe!
