I was SOOOO happy with this recipe!  I am on Weight Watchers and have figured out that as I prepared them, the muffins are about 2 points each.  I used regular whole wheat flour, not pastry flour.  I also omitted raisins and did use pecans, but I mixed them in rather than sprinkling them on top.  I also used wheat bran instead of oat bran.

These are the best muffins EVER!  I make them at least once a week :)  I use wheat bran instead of oat bran...it has less calories!  Oh, I also couldn't find pastry flour, so I just use whole wheat flour for all of it. And I always use a different flavor of fat free yogurt instead of plain.  Also I mix the pecans right into the mix, and bake for about 17 minutes.  Perfection!  These are so low in fat & calories and totally moist.  I recommend them to everyone.  Great recipe!

very good for whole grain healthy muffins! I am usually disappointed in the flavor of recipes like this, but this one is tasty and so healthy! I used whole rolled ots instead of oat bran, no raisins and no nuts...and it came out very good. I will make this again for a healthy treat for my kids.

This was really really good. I omitted the added sugar, and halved the maple syrup, and used wheat germ instead of oat bran, and it was still excellent. How a muffin should taste.

Excellent texture and moist for an extremely low fat muffin!  Got a nice crown on them too.  I also used wheat bran instead of oat bran.  To reduce the sugar I skipped the raisins and maple syrup and instead used just 1/4 cup sugar as called for in the recipe and 4 bananas.  They were not bakery-cakey sweet that way, which I actually prefer.  Non-fat greek strained yogurt worked terrific (and added to the moistness--plus a protein boost!), and if you do that, you don't need sour cream - just use 3/4 cup greek yogurt for both.  In my laziness I also used one whole egg instead of the 2 tsp egg whites.   Don't skip the nuts on top!  I had walnuts on hand so used those. Makes them very pretty and appetizing.  I've tried dozens of healthy banana muffin recipes over the years but this one is a keeper!

This is the perfect morning breakfast for us!  I used all whole wheat flour rather than the pastry flour, added just a touch of almond flavoring along with the vanilla, used organic apricot applesauce; otherwise, I followed the directions.  My bananas measured out to be 1 1/4 c, and it made 13 muffins--perfect for Friday the Thirteenth!  I will definitely make these again!

Excellent healthy muffin! Very chewy and soft texture. I used a 6oz container of blueberry yogurt and it came out wondurful, I'll make again and try using a different flaver of yogurt but blueberry was good. Also pecans added right into the batter was good as well. Great recipe!

These were good, but not the best banana muffins I've ever had, and I tend to cook whole-grain recipes rather than regular. These muffins were tasty, but they just weren't my favorite ever. I'm undecided as to whether I'd make them again.

I made some modifications to suit my cooking style.  I used 1/2 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup ground flax.  I also used banana cream pie fat free yogurt in place of plain.  I omitted the raisins and added an extra banana.  These would also be good with chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Yum yum.....

Loved this recipe! Didn't have the pastry flour or oat bran so just used all whole wheat which sometimes can be dry. Not so -- really moist and yummy. Threw in chocolate chips with raisins (1/2 and 1/2). Added chopped pecans but next time would pan roast them first as I found them a little bitter. Otherwise really, really good. Had one ripe banana left over so sliced it and put it on top before baking. Looked nice.

I think these are pretty good! They could be a tad sweeter though. I added a couple mini chips and substituted agave nectar for the maple syrup and they were great!

These were flavorful, moist and substantial. I confess to making a few minor adjustments according to what I normally have in my fridge/pantry - all whole wheat flour, a whole egg, and all 1% sour cream. I also just incorporated the nuts into the batter rather than sprinkling on top. I really enjoyed these whole grain muffins. Thank you!

Yum!  Delish!  Like another reviewer, I have been on Weight Watchers for a while and look for new healthy recipes. . . LOVE these!  Of course then I ate 2 of them  :)  But they were just so moist.  I used all wheat flour as I didn't have the pastry flour.  I also used a brown sugar splenda blend that I just picked up instead of the white sugar.  Of course I could have trimmed a bit of fat and calories if I omitted the pecans but they added such a nice flavor to the banana.  Thanks for sharing!!  Will make these again.

This tasted pretty darn good and were very moist. I was looking for a pretty healthy muffin that I could make with the ingredients in my pantry. 

I didn't want to go to the store so I didn't follow the recipe exactly...
*only used 1/8 cup maple syrup subbed brown sugar for the rest
*I only had plain yogurt so no sour cream
*Only had whole wheat flour so I subbed 1/2 cup of milled flax seed
*Didn't have applesauce so I cut up an apple stuck it in the microwave then blended it. 
*also didn't have oatbran so I used oatmeal. 
Where there is a will there is a way :). I didn't realized I subbed so many ingredients until I listed them! Pretty forgiving recipe and they turned out great.

This recipe was excellent. I omitted the sour cream and used a full 6 oz. container of mango flavored yogurt because that's what I had. I also used rolled oats instead of oat bran and swapped 1/2 cup of chocolate chips for the raisins. I also mixed the pecans in instead of sprinkling them on top.

This was a great recipe! I made a few changes that were suggested and what I had on hand.  I enjoyed not having to use oil and a lot of sugar. Loved the idea of using non fat yogurt too! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

I thought this recipe was really blah.  Maybe not sweet enough, maybe just not enough taste to it?  I don't know.  Might've been tasteless bananas.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (used all whole wheat flour instead of part pastry) and I didn't have the nuts, but honestly, the raisins were the only saving grace in the muffin.

I've made these twice, and neither time did they turn out tasting very good, or rising very well.  I think I'll stick with the honey bran muffin recipe.

SO glad to find a healthy banana muffin recipe... and YUM… totally stuck to the muffin papers, but so delicious… I used oat/rye flakes in lieu of oat bran… shoulda added ground up flax seed, but didn’t remember to.  Added some brown sugar and instead of raisins added cranberry/apple/carrot chutney.  Used all yogurt instead of sour cream, made applesauce from scratch and one egg instead of egg whites. Came out fantastic!  Might make a great bread... and would totally eliminate the sticky paper situation!  I added a cream cheese icing (not healthy!) since they're a b day treat at my daughter's school... and sprinkles, of course... she's 3! :)

Wow this was great! I used 2 large bananas instead of 3 small ones and used walnuts instead of pecans. Used honey instead of sugar...and also added 1/4 cup extra applesauce because I discovered my sour cream was two weeks past the expiration date. The recipe made nine large muffins and they were all gone by the end of the day. Delicious! 5 stars.

I am surprised at how moist these muffins are, given the omission of butter or shortening.  I did not have whole wheat pastry flour, so instead used all whole wheat flour and oat bran.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins and pecans.  I will definitely make them again.

Unfortunately, mine turned out really undercooked and gummy. I used unbleached flour because I didn't have whole wheat, maybe that was the reason...? The outsides were cooked, and that tasted good - great if you're looking for a muffin that's not too sweet and healthy. Not sure if I would attempt this recipe again, knowing how there are other great banana muffins out there.

So good!  Sweet enough to be a cupcake- maybe a little cream cheese frosting on top...I made this basically following the recipe- although I didn't have pastry flour so used regular whole wheat for all.  The muffins were incredible!  I ate two right out of the oven, and I'll be back for more pretty soon!  The only mistake I made was using the paper liners and not spraying them with non-stick spray first- I lost a good part of the muffin because they really stuck to the paper.  Otherwise, they were just fantastic.

So, I made these this afternoon (Aug. 2, 2014), and my reaction is mixed. 

The first thing I'm sure of is there is too much baking powder in these. There is a metallic aftertaste that is unpleasant.

The other issue I had was that the baking powder acted immediately in the batter when dry hit wet, but then they didn't rise in the oven.

The top note of flavor is good, but that metallic aftertaste nullifies that.

My advice, less baking powder and make sure it's double-acting! 

Aside from those criticisms, I like the versatility of the batter. I added whole oats instead of oat bran, trail mix (with sunflower seeds, raisins, nuts, etc.) instead of raisins and pecans, and used all Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. The texture is dense, but that's the way I like them.

Overall, I'd try them again with a few adjustments.

Amazing recipe and use of whole wheat pastry flour! Very moist muffins. I sprinkled chocolate chips on just a few as an experiment.

These are wonderful for someone wanting to have a healthy carbohydrate snack.  (like me today!)  Unlike other healthy muffins, these are not dense and too chewy but light and satisfying.  I would recommend not using paper liners so that they do not stick to the paper.  A good wheat flour adds flavor.  I omitted the raisins and nuts for my preference and enjoyed my snack!

Perfect.  I used golden raisins, and molasses instead of the honey.  I was a little concerned that raisins might not be the best flavor with the banana, but I was wrong - it's delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best turnout I've ever had with a whole wheat muffin recipe!    I did have whole wheat pastry flour, but I know that white whole wheat flour works just as well.    I used 3/4 cup of berry flavored yogourt instead of any sour cream. I used free flowing organic brown sugar (Sucanat) instead of granulated. I also omitted the raisins and stirred in dark chocolate chunks for a boost of antioxidants. I just had one warm out of the oven..and the melted chocolate is such a treat.    Great recipe! Thank you! I suggest greasing the pan or using silicone muffin liners instead of paper ones. More eco-friendly anyway.

I would not recommend these.  Mine have barely any flavor.  I substituted white flour for the wheat, but I don't know how much of a difference it could have made.

These are great. Even my teenage boys liked them. I used whole wheat flour instead of pastry flour an left out the sugar. They were still sweet enough. Will make again.

They were gummy. I wondered about adding canola oil or something to correct the texture. Also, I had to guess about the amount of bananas to add.  "3 small bananas" is not a helpful instruction. That might have been part of the problem? So I was disappointed after the rave reviews.

I used the Sneaky Chef's Flour Mix in place of the whole wheat flours, blueberries instead of raisins, all yogurt instead of sour cream, and 2 lg bananas instead of 3 small.  Also omitted the pecans so my toddler could eat them.  These were very good, but in the future I'll add more bananas to really get that flavor to come out.  Also realized, after baking them, that I'd forgotten to add the vanilla, so I'll add that next time :)

I'm always looking for a healthier version of muffin and this one fit that bill.  The flavor was good, and the calorie to size ratio was excellent (no skimpy little muffin here!).  I think the one detraction for me was the density of the muffin - with the whole wheat flour and the oat bran the muffins were pretty heavy and dense.  I'll definitely make these again and see if I can find a way to make them a bit lighter.

I will definitely make this again. I made several changes due to allergies and to increase the depth of flavors & texture, but kept the ratio of dry to wet ingredients pretty much the same. These muffins came out moist and delicious. For my future reference: 
1 and 3/4 c of whole wheat pastry flour,
1/2 c all purpose pastry flour (makes it lighter & fluffier),
1/4 c brown sugar (for a richer caramel flavor)
1 tbs baking powder,
1/2 tsp salt,
1/4 c brown rice syrup (instead of maple syrup)
1/2 c plain Greek yogurt (for added protein)
1/4 c light sour cream,
2 tsp melted coconut oil,
1/2 c (4oz) banana purée (find in baby aisle/used for extra banana flavor)
1 tsp vanilla extract,
3 med bananas (mashed)

I have never eaten a whole grain banana muffin, so this was new to me.  To be honest, it's not what I'm used to - sugar packed muffins.  With that being said, I'm trying to get away from all the unnecessary sugar and I think this is a good starting place.  It's not my norm, but will be my new norm!  I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I used 1 & 1/4 cup whole wheat flour because I didn't have pastry flour.  I subbed sour cream for the yogurt (so I used 3/4 cup sour cream total in the recipe).  I used two 4oz cups of applesauce total - because I was short a banana.  A whole egg and 2 ripe bananas.  I did a few muffins without pecans & raisins, a few with pecans & raisins, a few with just pecans, and some with just a few chocolate chips.  They were all great!  I will use this recipe again!

These were great! I was a little worried by how thick the dough was and the way they looked when they came out of the oven (a bit like a batch of attempted fat free cookies). But they were delicious!

These muffins are awesome!  I didn't have white sugar so I used the same amount of light brown sugar and they turned out great.  I was surprised that the banana and maple tastes weren't nearly as strong as I expected (in a good way).  They have a really nice flavor and texture without anything being overpowering.  I am going to try them with dried cranberries instead of raisins (or maybe in addition to) next time.

I made these today using Dannon nonfat raspberry yogurt and regular wheat flour since I didn't have the pastry wheat flour.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract to give it extra flavor.  It was a quick recipe to make, and they turned out very well.  I will definitely make them again!

I thought these were just ok, however I probably can't completely rate it fair since I made some minor changes to the original.  I used 1 cup ww flour, 1/4 buckwheat flour, and I cup whole oats in place of the other flours it called for because I did not have them on hand.  Next time I might use a little less baking powder because they sort of had a metallic taste to me.  Suprisingly, I also felt like they needed a little more sugar even though they had raisins and maple syrup for added sweetness.  I'll probably try these again following the recipe exactly and see if it makes a difference.

oh this recipe is fabulous. Like others, I didn't expect it to be moist despite me using all whole wheat flour. Some changes I made included substituting dark chocolate thin shreds (made by using a normal knife to slice against a small section of a bar of dark chocolate) for raisns and walnuts for pecans. I did not have sour cream so I mixed 2 tbsp soy milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice + 1 cup low fat cottage cheese to substitute for the sour cream. The muffins turned out great! My sis love it though it was my 1st attempt.

These healthy muffins are very good; tender and not too sweet.  I didn't have oat bran so I substituted a combination of oat flour and wheat bran. It's nice to be able to serve muffins for breakfast without worrying about too much fat and added sugar.

I substituted berries for the bananas and added a 1/4 cup of olive oil, less yoghurt, and I added some Bran Buds for extra fibre. The muffins turned out to be a bit gummy, but I think that was the berries. All in all, a nice healthy (and super quick) breakfast muffin!

Delicious  muffins, super moist & easy!  I almost feel bad rating this one as I made so many changes....but I love reading how people change the recipes, so here's what I did to increase the protein & make it nut free for kids school snacks.  I also used 1/2 oat bran and 1/2 flax meal rather than 1 cup oat bran.  I cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup, and added handful of choc chips, left out the nuts and applesauce, but used 1/4 cup coconut oil instead. I used 3 full eggs & as I don't have pastry flour, I used 1/2 almond flour and 1/2 cup oats instead.  Also I topped them off with rolled oats and millet for some crunchy topping & decoration.  They are a bit sticky to the paper liners, so I'll probably just grease the pans next time.  I did have to cook them an extra 5 mins with the extra moisture I added.  Thanks!
