1.21.17 I had concerns that the pumpkin would dominate the flavor but it doesn t the pumpkin and apple share equally. We like our smoothies a little icy/slushy so I did add some crushed ice when blending and this smoothie had just the right amount of sweetness for us. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
