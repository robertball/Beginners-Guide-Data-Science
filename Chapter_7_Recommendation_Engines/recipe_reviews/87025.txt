I left out the Burgundy because I didn't have any on hand.  I wouldn't recommend adding the raw steak to the cooking onion mixture.  It doesn't develop a beef flavor.  Better to brown the beef in a separate pan and add it, together with some of the juices, to the onion mixture.

14 ounces of consomme makes a pretty liquid sauce.  If you have absorbent noodles they will take some of the liquid.  But I'd recommend making the thickening liquid (flour and water) with 3 tablespoons of flour.  You don't have to use the whole amount, just add as necessary.  (I ended up using 3 Tbs of flour).  Either that, or start by using only 9-10 ounces of the consomme and adding more as needed to keep the sauce at the right consistency.

As to the lemon juice, that can really overpower a dish.  I took 1/2 of a lemon and "forked" it over the pan a couple of times.  I probably added less than 1/2 of a teaspoon.  A little fresh lemon juice goes a long way.

These exceptions aside, this is a really nice and easy recipe.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.  Thanks for letting us have this dish!

I think this recipe turned out really well.  I did make a few changes...I tossed the raw sliced meat with salt, pepper and about 2 tablespoons of flour.  Then I browned the meat BEFORE I cooked the onions, etc.  Once the meat was browned I removed it from the pan with the "gravy" that was made from the drippings and the flour.  Then I added a bit more butter to the pan and sauteed the onions and garlic in the SAME pan - this way you get the flavor from the leftover drippings and browned pieces in the pan (some reviews said the flavor was bland so I thought this could help).  I also cooked the mushrooms longer than the recipe called for to cook out more moisture since many previous reviews said the sauce was too runny.  I also used 1/2 the amount of onions called for, added a few glugs of Brandy rather than Burgundy (I didn't want my sauce to be reddish), and didn't use quite as much lemon juice as called for in the original recipe.

I loved this recipe for stroganoff. The lemon did make it! As for the other reviewers who said it was too thin of a sauce, I must remind you to use consomme and not broth. I bet this is what makes the difference. Consomme has gelatin added. I used consomme, and my sauce was plenty thick.

Oh My Gosh!! This is the best recipe I have ever found! The wine and sour cream are so perfect together! We enjoy ours best over rice and I could easily make it once a week and no one in the house would complain. I do, however, eat most of my fill as I cook!!! So fabulous!!!!

Flavor was great, had no leftovers!  However, the sauce was a little too thin for my liking so I would probably decrease the broth next time.  The recipe also didn't make as much as anticipated for the number of servings it was supposed to result in.  Maybe my crew are just big eaters?!  To feed 4 adults, I would use the full 8 servings recipe.

We followed the recipe to the tee, except we browned the meat first which is definitely the way to go.  We have had better results from other beef stroganoff recipes.  We probably will not use this one again.

The primary taste of this recipe was of lemon!  The only changes I made was to decrease the onion to one & decreased the egg noodles to 8 oz.  We will not make again; have other beef stroganoff recipes that are very good.  This just didn't have enough beef taste.  I think part of the reason was that the beef was never browned to develop the glaze in the pan that adds so much to the taste of the final product.

I am working with a small budget and trying to stretch my money so I used a cheaper cut of meat--stew meat--in place of the beef loin steak. Because I used the cheaper cut of meat, I had to let it simmer a while so it would become tender. I sauteed the mushrooms, onions and meat until browned (adding fresh ground pepper), then added the other ingredients, brought it up to a boil, then covered and reduced heat and let it simmer for an hour or so. I left out the lemon juice because I was a little skeptical only because I didn't want the sauce to be too sour with the burgundy AND the lemon juice......I know.....shame on me. After tasting the stroganoff, I added a teaspoon of dried basil and dried oregano. I also tossed the buttered noodles with a little fresh ground pepper and some dried parsley. We really thought this was quite good, you couldn't even tell I used a cheaper cut of meat. My kids especially liked this with the buttered egg noodles. I'll make this again. NO leftovers.

Excellent recipe.  I made a few changes though to suit my taste - browned the beef with the onions, then threw everything (except sour cream) into the slow cooker for 8 hours.  After 8 hours, I add the sour cream and serve over egg noodles.  Delicious and tangy!

This was a good base recipe, but I did make a few changes. I used a large skillet and browned the onion and garlic in the butter, then I added the steak, followed by the mushrooms. When the steak was cooked, I added the flour to the pan and stirred it for a few minutes to cook it through. Then I slowly stirred in beef stock (I was fresh out of consomme). I added 1 TBS of worchestershire sauce instead of the burgundy to bring out the beef flavor, then allowed it to come to a boil for several minutes for the "roux" to develop its full thickening power.  I added about 1 TBS of fresh lemon juice, but will leave this out next time as we felt it overpowered the other flavors in the dish. The sour cream makes the dish, and the sauce was not too thin, but was just right. I did need to add salt and black pepper, though. I agree that the recipe, made as stated, only feeds four with no leftovers to speak of.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I marinated my beef strips in the burgundy (actually I used cabernet sauvignon because I like it better than burgundy) for a few hours.  I also added 2 kinds of fresh mushrooms.  Other than that, it is great the way it is.

I like that this a a REAL meat version and not just a ground beef dish and that it is relatively simple and quick.  That said, it lacks a certain something.  The sauce is rather bland, though the wine does add a touch of depth.  I noted there was no pepper in the dish so added a touch as the meat was searing.  My sauce did not thicken at all from the flour and water slurry so I made an arrowroot slurry (2T 1:1).  That helped.  Again, not bad, but it is not a favorite.  If I make it again, I will add more garlic, course chop my onions, and season with more pepper and maybe some more herbs.  May make sauce apart from meat and then incorporate.  Maybe I just need to find a slower cooking version.

I found this recipe to be a little bit bland the first time around, so I made a few modifications...I replaced the red wine will Amontillado, and I also added a pinch of ground caraway seeds a a 1/4 teaspoon of dried dill to the sauce.

This is positively delicious!  I may try braising the beef before adding it to the sour cream mixture.

I adjusted this recipe alot , and came out with a better tasting stroganoff .  The first time I made it , it came out waterey ( i used consomme ) and tasting of onions and lemon, no beef flavor at all. This time I skipped the lemon juice, and consomme and halved the onions.  I used packaged brown gravy mix instead of the consomme and mixed the sherry with the flour before adding it to the sauce to thicken it .  It came out much more flavorful and alot thicker , more like a gravy instead of a runny sauce .  My family didnt like it the first time we made it and wound up ordering take out for the night .  This time they absolutely raved about it !

Very similar to the stroganoff I have been making for years.  Only changes I make is coating the beef strips in seasoned flour before browning them, and adding a little worcheshire with the sour cream at the end.  A classic!

The flavor was really good even prior to adding sour cream.  I didn't have beef consomme or stock so used chicken broth with 3 beef bouillon cubes. The best stroganoff and the last recipe I'll use!

Followed the recipe, but could not get the sauce to thicken even a little bit. Also, it didn't really have much flavor.

I loved it, but I was short several items to make it. The next time I make it it'll taste like Beef Stroganoff should.

This was pretty good, but I wouldn't really call it "the best" It never really thickened up like stroganoff usually does even though I used 3 T of flour. I added worcesterchire, onion powder and freshly ground pepper while I was browning the meat to add more flavor and I will definitely do that again. Also, using portobello mushrooms was nice because they are hearty and rich tasting. I will probably make this again since I like that I can make it even if I don't have a can of cream of mushroom soup handy. So many other recipes use that and it's nice that this one uses all fresh ingredients. I also liked the kick that fresh lemon juice added. I have a recipe that uses red wine vinegar instead and it was also good that way.

Great flavor and easy to prepare. We loved it and I'll be making it again. Funny story, my boyfriend instantly went to the soup aisle to pick of cream of mushroom soup because that's how his mother always made it. He's a believer now. Fresh ingredients only make this a mouth watering dish.

This is by far the best sauce I have made.  Have to agree and will do it the next time and that is the meat should be precooked before adding to sauce.  As for the thickening, I added a can of mushroom soup with the can of consumme and skipped the burgandy.  Once the mixture melded together, I then did the flour mixture and added the sour cream.  My son, who thought the stuff was going to be gross, ate three helpings.  This sauce would be good with left over roast beef.

This is a good recipe as is, but I felt a few changes were needed. First, increasing the flour to 3 T. tightened up the sauce considerably. Also, 3 T. of lemon juice would have put the sauce far beyond the familiar tang associated with stroganoff; I reduced to 2 T. and it was still a bit much. Also, a bit of salt and pepper really brought out the flavors. As mentioned by many others, it's really a good idea to brown the meat first. In all, a very good recipe!

We enjoyed this!!!  For years I have been making stroganoff with Cream of Mushroom soup.  When I learned that there is MSG and other chemicals in the soup that isn't good for you, I wanted to find something that was better, something that used natural ingredients.  This was perfect..and easy!

There isn't much flavor to this recipe and my sauce didn't really thicken as it should have. Next time I am going to add a bit more garlic, and season my beef with salt and pepper and work on the thickening of the sauce and I think it will be better.

This was easy and quite tasty.  I reduced the onions to only half an onion and it was perfect.  In the future I will substitute a potent beef broth for the consomme.  I read the ingredients of Campbell's Beef Consomme and there is nothing mmm mmm good about it!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was not good.  The sauce was very watery (despite actually adding corn starch when it was clear it wasn't thickening) and extremely bland.  The boiling phase caused the meat to be bland and tough.  I'll continue looking.

This is an easy recipe to make and my family loved it. Deffinately a keeper. Only thing was I didn't have any burgundy on hand so I used what I had, white cooking wine. I know it was at the opposite ends of taste but this still was great. The next trip to the store will include burgundy cooking wine to try this again.

Delicious!  Based on other reviews, I coated the beef in flour, salt and pepper, then browned.  Removed from the pan, then followed the directions in the recipe.  I omitted the mushrooms (we don't like them) and wine (didn't have any).  Went to add the sour cream and discovered I didn't have any!  So I substituted plain yogurt.  Hubby, kids and I all loved it.

This recipe was okay but not great.  The steak was very tender and I think if more was used, this meal would be more satisfying.  I omitted the lemon juice per other reviewers' suggestions; I couldn't see why this was an ingredient.  It was easy and tasty enough but I don't think I will make this again since there are so many other beef stroganoff recipes to try.  Also, I think adding peas to this would bump it up a notch.

Wonderful. I used this as a make ahead meal.I had 1 pound of leftover cooked sirloin roast. Used a skillet to cook the onions/garlic/mushrooms in butter. Removed from heat. Added the sliced beef to skillet. Used a separate saucepan to whisk 10 oz of beef broth/lemon/wine then added in  3T wondra/2T broth/1 T butter. Poured this into the skillet and mixed all together. Let it cool and "rest" in fridge for a 3 hours. At dinnertime, I made the noodles. Added the sour cream to the skillet and then reheated and served over hot egg noodles.

This was delicious, the lemon juice was a key ingredient. I don't like to review recipes that I've modified but I did do one thing differently to this recipe by using sliced up New York roast from a previous meal. This is an easy recipe and the end result is fantastic.

A good start for stroganoff.  Less liquids will make it less soupy and cut the onions in half.

This is the best recipe I have found for Stroganoff.  I used a little more than 14 oz of the consomme and it just required a little more thickening.  Other than that, no changes - It was perfect!

I have been using my own recipe for this dish for years and recently decided to try this one for a change. It was absolutely beautiful and I will definitely use it again. I added slightly more wine than suggested and I felt being sreved with noodles doesn't do this dish the justice it deserves. Try it with rice or potatoes next time for a change Yum.

EXCELLENT recipe! I did cut it down to one large onion and used baby bella mushrooms for great added flavor. Sauce was thick enough to give it some body but thin enough that it covered the noodles well.
It was all I could do to keep my husband from eating it out of the pan while it was cooking it smelled so wonderful!

The mixture was way to watery and the onions were over powering. Also, I tasted way to much lemon. There wasn't any real beef flavor. I can see where other posters have made lots of adjustments to this recipie and it's easy to see why. Hubby and I ended up tossing it the trash after a few bites and put a pizza in the oven. Don't waste your time.

I made this for my husband and I last week and I thought it was....okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and was a little disappointed.  I was hoping it would be a little more like what my mom used to make.  We won't have this version again but we will keep looking for a good stroganoff recipe.

I thought this recipe was great!  The wine and the sour cream made for a delicious combination.  I use and inexpensive Cabernet Sauvignon and my sauce was not purple as other people have mentioned.  I am thinking they may have used a Merlot which definitely has that more intense color.  I ended up using venison instead of beef and the flavor was fantastic.  This is an outstanding recipe and it doesn't use any yucky condensed mushrrom soup!  Try it!!!

Like many other people, I used this recipe as a guide and changed it to fit what I had on hand.  I used canned venison, dehydrated morel mushrooms, and marsala wine.  The liquid used to rehydrate the morels in was reduced and added to the broth from the canned venison.  I skipped the minced garlic so it wouldn't overpower the delicate morel flavor.  I had to add about 4-5 tbsp of flour mixed with venison broth to thicken the sauce.  The resulting dish was wonderful!  Can't wait to try it with fresh morels this spring. I particulary liked the lemon juice addition: it seemed to lighten the flavors without standing out.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW!! This was AWESOME! I did like JessicaB, tossing the meat in salt, pepper, and a little bit of flour and cooked it first. Then I cooked the onions, garlic, and mushrooms in a little more butter. Also, used Wondra and cold water to thicken. Also, didn't have Burgandy, so used some red wine I had around. It was AMAZING! THANKS!!!

This dish was so tasty! I used a Merlot wine that I had open already instead of the one suggested in this recipe and it was very good.  I gave it 5 stars because it was delicious and the whole family ate it! *The only change I will make next time is to cut back on the lemon- 3 T was a bit too much for me.*
Love this dish and look forward to making it again!!

I upped the garlic to 4 cloves and upped the wine to 1/2 cup.  My whole family including  my 21 month old devoured this and loved this.  KEEPER for sure

I used frozen egg noodles, which were fantastic. Given a choice, I would always use the frozen egg noodles (instructions on the package) or from scratch noodles. I also used what I had on hand as follows: 1) canned mushrooms instead of fresh, 2) red cooking wine instead of Burgundy wine, 3) leftover diced prime rib (we only had 10 ounces, but that was enough), 4) chicken broth instead of beef consomme (using broth instead of consomme will require more flour to make sure the liquid is thick enough). We loved the lemon juice and did not decrease it as some have suggested. Excellent recipe, Speechteacher.

My husband and children love hambuger helper which I cant stand.... So I decided to go with this recipe after reading a few reviews on it.   This recipe was very easy and quick to prepare.  The flavor idea seem to be on point but, we are comparing it to hamburger helper. My family and I both felt it was way to oniony (12 servings ask for 3 onions finely chopped.) We also thought the sauce was not thick enough.  I felt the final sause was not rich enough.  My children felt it taste to much like wine.  My husband and I liked the Burgandy wine flavor. Next time I think I will use 1 1/2 onion for 12 servings and use half cream cheese and half sour cream to make it creameir thicker and richer. I even think I will marinade the beef in white wine and seasoning before cooking, leave out the burgundy too.   If its wonderful I will be sure to let you know!!!

MMmmm good!.. I made a few substitutions, sherry for the wine and canned mushrooms.  I cut the lemon back to about 1T and seasoned my beef well with garlic, salt, pepper and cayenne (my favorites).  I had some homemade chicken stock in the freezer and I used that; sprinkled some flat leaf parssley on top when I served it.  This is a hubby pleaser!..

I first looked at this recipe a very long time ago, and since then it has become a definite family favorite. I now no longer even use the recipe and just add stuff to taste, using the basic guidelines. I don't add lemon juice, I use beef broth and cornstarch, and only about 1/2 cup sour cream, plus seasonings to taste, such as parsley and lots of garlic. The way I make it (which I can't pinpoint exactly, and was once this recipe) is absolutely fantastic and is now the only stroganoff we ever eat at my house. Rave reviews from everyone who tries it.

With a few small alterations, it was a very good, standard stroganoff. 

I used beef stock instead of consomme, and only about 1 1/4 cups.  As with many others, I browned the beef first.  Instead of mixing the flour with water, I added it directly to the pan after cooking the onions and garlic, then deglazed with the wine.

It yielded considerably less than 8 portions - probably more like 5.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I browned the beef separately in a saucepan with worcestershire sauce and coarsely ground black pepper for five minutes. When it was done, I sliced it thin. That's the only variance I had in this recipe.

Very good recipe. I didn't have consomme, just broth, and so I used extra flour.  I added the flour to the onions, garlic and beef, and then while stirring, added the lemon juice and let it evaporate.  I did the same for the wine before adding the broth.  The finished product wasn't that pink at all. I served my husband's portion over egg noodles and mine over steamed vegetables and it was so good that way I'll be doing it again.

I took some liberties w/ this recipe to make it more healthy.  I subbed ground turkey for the beef, msg-free chic broth for the beef consomme, & used light sour cream.  I appreciate the base recipe though as this was very good.  My husband LOVED it.

Very good! I followed other users' suggestions about thickness of sauce. The beef didn't have a whole lot of flavor so I'm going to try marinating the beef in the  beef consumme next time.

This recipe wasn't bad but it came out very soupy. I notice some other reviews mention using broth instead of consomme but I used the consomme and it still came out very liquidy. Maybe trying a little less of that or maybe a little more flour to thicken it up.

I cooked this recipe exactly as written.  I did not really think that it was thick enough.  I enjoyed the flavor though.  Very good.  Next time if I use this recipe, I will make it just a bit thicker.

For the first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out really good.  Quick and easy to make, under 30 minutes.  I will be making it again!  I wonder if reviewers with watery sauce used consomme or beef broth.  I used consomme with gelatin added and my sauce was almost too thick!

I may not have made it correctly, but my sauce was a bit too watery (and yes, I did use consomme). I also thought it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped so I added a tiny amount of mustard and some peppers. It was alright. I just may not be a Stroganoff kind of gal.
 PS- pay attention to the number of servings, I didn't and ended up eating this mediocre dish for days!

I love this recipe!  It's exactly the same as one I have been using for many years.  It also makes a great filling for crepes, topped with dab of sour cream. I have also made this dish using ground beef and it is just as good.

This dish is delicious! Very easy to make, the flavor is just right.
Highly recommend making this for the family. I've made other stroganoff with soup as a base, but this was soooo much better. Thank you.

I've made this at least a dozen times.  It is great as is, no changes necessary.  Make sure you use Beef Consomme and not broth.  The fresh lemon juice makes this recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars as it was totally enjoyed by all 40 people who had it for lunch today.  I multiplied the amounts by 5 times and used sirloin tip roasts that happened to be on sale, sliced thinly.  Cut the lemon juice to 1/3 c for the total recipe and it was perfect.  We cooked the onion, mushrooms and meat (tossed in the flour)until browned. As each lot was done, it was transferred to a portable oven to simmer for 1.5hrs.  We deglazed the frying pans with the broth before completing the cooking in the portable oven. Served with peas on the side and a spice cake pumpkin trifle for dessert.  Excellent recipe.

Great recipe! Easy to make and handles minor modifications just fine.

What I did differently:
*I used a little less broth since I chose to use the optional wine. I didn't have an actual Burgundy on hand, so I used red cooking wine. 
*When it came to the flour, I used a searing flour that already had salt and pepper in it (Wegmans brand for those with a Wegmans grocery store). 
*I used two 4-ounce cans of mushrooms in place of fresh as I had several on hand.
*Instead of dealing with portioning out noodles and topping separately, I mixed them together in the pan I'd made the topping with and served it already dressed. Made it easy to serve lunch and to store leftovers without one of us have more noodles than yummy stuff.

This turned out really well! I followed a few other reviewers' suggestions and browned the meat first (with a little olive oil), and then cooked the onions and garlic in the same pan with a tablespoon of butter. I didn't have any mushrooms so I added some cooked peas at the end before adding the sour cream. I also reduced the amount of beef broth to 1 cup and the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons. I used 2 small onions, and it was a little much. I think next time I will try 1 large onion and maybe 12 ounces of beef broth.

for all the folks on the fence try this .
*Marinade your beef in merlot wine, the consumme and a package of lipton onion soup mix for 8-12 hours. 
*use sliced Shitake mushrooms
* when It comes to adding the consumme and wine use the remaining marinade.
*I like a really thick sauce so bump the flour up to 1/4 cup
keep the rest of the recipe the same!!

Excellent flavor.  I used Sirloin Steak, and reduced onion to just one medium yellow onion. The lemon gave it a bit of a zing and I did use the wine.  It was easy to prepare and fairly quick.  Family loved it!

Great stroganoff!  Makes plenty of sauce to accomodate 2 pounds of beef.  My growing boys loved this and even the picky 2 year old ate it.  I was in the mood for rice and they were great together.

I liked the flavor however I only used 2 tbs of lemon juice and it  use 1 tbs, put the meat in later so it is more tender and use less consume to thicken it up a bit. But once I tweek it it will be perfect for us.

I only used this as a foundation for using leftover Slow Cooker French Dip from this site. It already had the flavors of the wine and of course the consomme as I had plenty of broth from the french dip recipe. I followed all the other instructions omitting mushrooms ( we do not care for them) and lemon juice as I had none on hand. My family LOVED this and it is but one way to use leftovers from the Slow Cooker French Dip recipe that is so well reviewed on this site!

I found the recipe to be quite good. Although I can only give four stars due to some changes. I used ground beef and used the drippings to make a rue, to thicken the sauce. I also added some dill, paprika, salt and pepper. Very Yummy!

I added some browning liquid and used 14 oz. of beef broth instead of "consumme" since I wasn't sure what that was... I just realized today that I totally left out the sour cream, and it was still very yummy!

I enjoyed this dish. I used homemade beef stock and cooking wine which added a salty taste.

This was great!  We're eating low carb, so we just didn't put it on noodles, so I omitted the flour, used less onions, and more mushrooms.  Otherwise I made the recipe "as is".  Broth was "runny", but we didn't care.

This was the best Stroganoff we have ever had. I served it with green salad and steamed broccoli/cauliflower. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Excellent!

It was GREAT! I made my own noodles, and marinaded the beef with a splash of the cooking wine, lemon juice, beef consume, garlic salt and pepper. It was amazing.

It was exactly how it should taste! I personally wouldn't add as much sour cream but that is a personal preference. It just wasn't a recipe I enjoyed but ONLY because it just wasn't my taste the recipe itself was awesome and easy to follow and it tasted like a gourmet chef created it!

I too followed the advice of lessening the onion amount and  cooking the beef up-front.  I added cooking sherry and re-hydrated/ & chopped wild mushroom to the mix.  I rated this four on the initial recipe and 5 with changes

Based on other reviewers' comments, I cut the onions in half and added more garlic.  I also browned the meat before cooking the onions.  The house smelled WONDERFUL when I was cooking but the stroganoff itself seemed a little bland.  I will try this again, varying the quantities of the ingredients and see what happens.

This was OK, but not the "best".  I am still searching for a good stroganoff recipe.  The onions were overpowering plus something just seemed to be missing.  Way too many noodles for the amount of beef mixture.

We liked this recipe as it had a very good flavor.  I did add 1 TBL of lemon juice to the marinade.  Think I will try the marinade with steak.

This was very yummy! I used a boullion cube & water in place of the consomme & wine. I also used 3 cloves of garlic, & canned mushrooms. Since I was out of noodles, I sliced potatoes & boiled them and served it over the potatoes.

Something in the recipe gave it a funny taste. I thingk it was the lemon juice. If I were to make this again I would leave the lemon juice out and see how that tasted.

This is awesome! I substituted 4 green onions, and included 4 garlic instead of 2. I also added Campbell's mushroom/onion soup. Instead of Burgandy, I used medium-dry red wine. I am from Nova Scotia and Jost's Terra Nova compliments the flavour exquisitely.

Very tasty!  I could not imagine ANYTHING with two onions so I cut it done to a half of an onion.  I used broth and it came out great.  Also substituted frozen meatballs.

This was wonderful, great flavor.  I used a 10 1/2 ounce can of consomme and 1 lemon and some red wine - did end up using 3 tbs of flour and water but otherwise followed the directions and it was great - had enough for 6-8.

This was ok.  My sauce was way too watery.  It didn't have a lot of flavor.  I won't make it again.  I'll keep looking for a better stroganoff recipe.
