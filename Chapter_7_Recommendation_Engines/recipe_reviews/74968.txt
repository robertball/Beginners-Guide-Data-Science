If you want the "full fat" version of this recipe change the servings to 8.  Use sugar instead of Splenda. 2 eggs instead of egg substitute and add 1 tsp of vanilla.  These are the best pancakes I have ever had.  I will not eat any other kind!

Yum… I looked up this recipe in efforts to duplicate a pancake made by a local natural foods restaurant that I loooove and these are really great. I’ve made them several times now for friends and family. I too used regular sugar/eggs and usually double the recipe, adding a little vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. I like that they are slightly sweet because I don't really like to use maple syrup. A tip for cooking them: make sure your griddle is heated thoroughly and maintain a medium heat. Since this batter is a bit heavier and thicker, they need to cook a little more slowly than other pancakes. Also, I often use the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a thinner, rounder pancake right when I put them on the griddle.

I made one version with non fat and one with full fat ricotta cheese. Hands down the full fat version was better! But I did use whole wheat flour. I didn't have any egg substitute so I used two egg whites instead, whipping first and folding in. Very light and fluffy pancakes. I'll make again.

This is a wonderful recipe. To make these pancakes truly melt in your mouth, try adding a bit of lemon juice to taste.  It contrasts beautifully with the blueberry, and gives an incredible texture.  I've seen lemon ricotta pancakes all over restaraunts here in New York.

I used another reviewer's suggestion for 2 eggs and regular sugar, as well as 1 tsp. of vanilla and a pinch of salt, and they came out great. They are fluffy but press them down a bit as they solidify to make sure the insides cook. I have made these with sliced strawberries, blueberries, or spiced with cinnammon and pumpkin pie spice (1/2 tsp each) and they always come out great. My friend begs me to make these for her whenever she comes over!

I have type 2 diabetes and because of this recipe I can eat pancakes again without raising my blood sugar! They are very tasty and I have made them about 15 times already. Even my husband likes them and he doesn't have diabetes. I just add a little vanilla and lemon zest to spice them up a bit. YUM

This one is a keeper, folks!  Even though I modified this recipe for real eggs and sugar, these babies were suprisingly good.  Very delicious!  I will make it again until I get the best results... I cut in 2 tbs of lemon zest instead of the blueberries.  But I will try lemon zest WITH blueberries next time.  I dusted it with powdered sugar since syrup would have ruined it for sure.  It was delicious and sweet enough without the maple.  I found another version of this on cdkitchen that required a lot more ingredients such as vanilla extract.  I wonder if it would taste better then.  So next time I'm going to try it with the subs.  Then I will try it with vanilla.

I am also a diabetic and make a similar recipe only I use cottage cheese in place of the ricotta. With very little flour my blood sugar stays under control.

Really enjoyed these after making some changes as others did. I changed the serving size to 8, went with real sugar and whole ricotta cheese, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon extract. Also I added some milk to the whole batch just to loosen it up a bit, it was a little too stiff without it. Awesome!

Nothing like feeling you are really "indulging" if you are dieting by having these pancakes. The only changes were adding 1 teaspoon vanilla, a pinch of salt and substituting wheat flour. Topped with the fresh berries and a sugar free maple syrup. I've had better pancakes, but this really is a good healthy version of a pancake. =)

We made this today using leftover cannoli filling:) Great! However we used real eggs and had to add a little cream. The mixture wasn't very workable without a tad bit more liquid. Thanks.

I used a hand-whisk to make sure the ricotta was well-blended. I substituted the all-purpose flour for wheat and added both brown splenda and vanilla. The result was sweet and delicious! Next time, I plan to add flax seed to make it super healthy. Good recipe!

Oh my gosh - these were AMAZING!! I'll be making these again and again - soooo good. They were the perfect size, cooked wonderfully, and came out really light & fluffy, but not at all dry (I hate dry pancakes.) I couldn't ask for better pancakes! I used skim ricotta, one egg instead of the egg substitute, real sugar, and whole wheat flour. The recipe made 2 large pancakes (and like another reviewer, I sprinkled just a bit of powdered sugar on top.) Yum yum yum!

These were really a nice surprise.  I couldn't imagine how different they might taste than regular pancakes, but I was pleasantly surprised!  And, my 18 month old LOVED them!  I doubled recipe and used 4 t. regular white sugar and 2 eggs.  Doubling the recipe really allows you to serve 2 people.  The recipe as written serves 1.  I omitted blueberries (didn't have them) but added vanilla and lemon juice.  I used my measuring cup I was pouring the batter onto the griddle with to smooth the batter into a thinner pancake.  This allows the center of the pancake to cook before becoming too browned on the outside.  We dusted ours with powdered sugar and ate 'em up!

Quite simply one of the tastiest pancakes I've ever eaten.  I used 1 egg as I didn't have any substitute ones, and Truvia because I had no Splenda.  I added a splash of lemon juice - lemon and blueberry just go together- a sprinkle of cinnamon and a grating of nutmeg.  Easy, tasty, sweet but not overly so.  Just put a smear of butter on them.  Will definitely make again and try with different fruits.  I bet these would rock with dried cranberries or fresh strawberries!

Not sure how this only has 4 stars.  It's fantastic.  I find I need to double the recipe for 2ppl though. I also opt for using part-skim ricotta.  I used the fat free ricotta once and it didn't taste great, so maybe that's why it's only 4 stars. I also use 2 eggs when I double it, a splash of vanilla, a pinch of salt and the zest of a lemon and juice from half of it.  It is soooo yummy.  Add some bananas and blueberries and yogurt, you have a healthy high protein, low carb breakfast.  Enjoy!

I don't know how I feel about this pancake.  I did change it slightly - 2 eggs whites for egg substitute, chopped strawberries for blueberries, and a dash of almond extract.  It tasted delicious, but the texture was much too soft for me (like eating ricotta cheese and mushy strawberries).  I think the recipe has potential with some added body though.  Just not sure of how to do that - maybe just more flour?  Also, be careful about adding tooo much fruit - that adds water when cooking.

Yummy!  I used whole grain flour and Rapadura instead of Splenda.  Also used whole eggs.  Would be even better with lemon zest and/or vanilla!  Definitely double the recipe.

These pancakes were so good!!  We up the servings to 16 to make enough for my family of six.  Also we didn't add the sugar and they still tasted wonderful.  They do take awhile to cook so prepare for the time it takes!!  We will be eating these again, thanks for the recipe!

I just love these pancakes. I did not have blueberries around the 3rd time I made them. I did add a scoop of vanilla protein and they were still really yummy and I got my protein in to boot.

These were just "ok."  I did make the recipe for 8, and used whole eggs and sugar as suggested by others.  They were too bland and thick (more like cookie batter), so I added a couple teaspoons of vanilla, and half-and-half in order to thin it down enough to scoop it out into a pan.  They took an exceptionally long time to cook.  I did not care for them at all, however, I gave the recipe two stars because everyone else in the family said they did.  I would not make these again.

For someone that doesn't really care for pancakes, like myself, I felt this was a great idea to utilize my leftover ricotta cheese from lasagna the dinner before. My husband being the pancake fan and always trying to convince me to make them for dinner, really enjoyed them! Thank you to the user who suggested the use of sugar, real eggs and vanilla.

These pancakes tasted a lot like French toast and were pretty good. However, because the batter was so thick, the pankcakes were hard to flip and didn't turn out looking very appealing. Not so sure I will try this one again.

Wow - surprised that these tasted so similar to real pancakes!  They are a little lighter of course, but my finicky husband couldn't tell the difference...I told him what was in them AFTER he took a bite.  Like the other reviewers suggested, I used a fattier ricotta (part skim), added 1/4 t vanilla.  I also spread them out in the pan with a spoon to get a fuller flatter cake.  To cut down on fat I used 1/4 ricotta and 1/4 non-fat cottage cheese.  YUM!  Will try fruit and cinnamon next time.  I love that this makes enough for just a couple of people.  Thanks TRROUBLE07!

I made the full fat version of this recipe and it was FANTASTIC. If I am going to make pancakes, I want the real deal. They are so rich and delicious.

I am newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and this recipe is a great find.  Its really nice to have some pancakes and carbs to waste!  I used sliced strawberries instead of blueberries.  The pancakes are not as fluffy or bread-y as regular pancakes, but are definitely sweet and warm and good.  We topped them with butter, a squeeze of lemon, sliced strawberries and powdered sugar.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It made my day--and my dietitian was impressed too!

mmmmm... these are the best pancakes that I've cooked.  I've been looking for a different breakfast entree to cook for a while... this was wonderful.  Ran out of egg substitute so I used the two egg whites.  The only thing that was a pain is that for me it made only two pancakes so I had to double the recipe for more pancakes.

Delicious! Going by some other reviews, I used real sugar and 2 egg whites instead of splenda and egg substitute. Unless you can't have sugar at all, 2 tsp for the whole recipe is really tiny. 
I also used part-skim ricotta and added cinnamon, vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. 
It might sound like I changed it a lot, but really it's just subbing in real ingredients and adding some spices. 
Yum!

I was skeptical, but these were pretty good.  I, too, used a teaspoon of allspice and a dash of cinnamon.  I also used 2 large eggs and put in frozen cranberries instead of blueberries.  Yum!

We found the pancakes to be lacking flavor despite adding blueberries and pure maple syrup.  Maybe they were not as good as they could be because I used all natural ingredients.  This recipe just didn’t ring our bells.

Very yummy. don't be impatient.  turn the initial heat down a tad  after flip and  let them fully cook inside.
I used whole egg(s) , regular sugar and white whole wheat flour  and a little  heavy cream to keep consistency good.    yummy and easy.

These are wonderful pancakes. The consistency wasn't dry at all and they were even a  bit sweet. It made the need for syrup practically non-existent.  I followed some of the other reviewers recommendations and made a few substitutions (FYI...I doubled the recipe). I used one large egg plus one egg white instead of the egg substitute. I used regular sugar instead of Splenda. I omitted the blueberries because I didn't have any. Also, my husband cooked the pancakse in extra virgin coconut oil instead of butter. This made the outside of the pancakes crispy and left the inside very moist and probably contributed to the sweet taste. Very good....

I added chocolate chips instead of blueberries. These did not cook all the way through. The taste was there but these cakes need to be cooked "low and slow". I also use Crisco shortning intead of butter to cook the cakes in to get that crispy edge.

These pancakes had ad different texture than the regular pancakes but tasted good. I made a few changes: used fat free ricotta cheese, whole wheat flour, used 1 egg + 1 egg white, added vanilla extract and omitted the blueberries since I didn't have any.  Great source of protein. Thanks for the recipe Trouble07!

These must be an aquired taste.  Although they were not that bad, I was not impressed.  I did like the flavor of the Vanilla,Nutmeg and Cinnamon, but other than that, not a go for us, personally.

Very good.  I used part-skim ricotta and doubled the recipe, with two eggs instead of the egg substitute and half of the flour being whole wheat.  I also added lemon zest and lemon juice, and had the blueberries as a simple sauce over the top as opposed to in the actual pancakes.  Note that the ricotta doesn't make the pancakes "cheesy" at all, it just gives them a very addictive texture that's light and yet rich at the same time.  It takes a bit of trial and error to get the right temperature on the pan -- too high and they burn, too low and they spread into impossible-to-flip near-crepes.  Would be very nice to serve as a special breakfast.

The 1st time I tried these pancakes was at the cheesecake factory and they were delicious. These are just as good as those. I did substitute 2 whole eggs and 2 tsp regular sugar. I did use fat free ricotta because thats what I had. I omitted the blueberries and added 1/4 tsp lemon extract and I loved these. They were fluffy, light and flavorful. Absolutely fabulous give them a try.

First I read the reviews.  I decided to double the recipe and I added vanilla & cinnamon for more flavor.  Then I added milk because the batter was way too thick.  To be honest, the texture was good, but they really lacked flavor.  I don't think I'll make these again...Sorry!

These are really good and so good for you. The trick is to make sure that you cook your pancake completely. If you don't the consistancy will be mushy.

After making Silverwolf's "Spanakopita-Greek-Spinach-Pie" This recipe doubled used up what was left over from the 15oz ricotta container perfectly. 
As suggested I added 2 tsp of lemon juice. 
Soooooooo YUMMY!

Delish! Added fresh squeeded lemon juice to the batter and a little zest. Added raspberries and strawberries to the top and dusted with powdered sugar and butter. Would also be good with some boysenberry syrup! Yummy!!!!!

These were really different and good! Not really like regular pancackes. I used egg whites (whipped first), regular sugar and added a tsp of vanilla. I normaly eat pancackes with maple syrup, but I thought it tasted funny on these. Instead I spread a touch of butter on them and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Yummy!

It took me a few times to get these right...I really needed to spread the batter to make a thin pancake otherwise the center seemed wet and mushy. I used egg whites and either white or brown sugar and once added vanilla extract...all made them plenty sweet...i also used whole wheat flour and part skim ricotta...like other reviews i didnt find these pancakes to be light or fluffy more heavy and wet...but i like the healthy aspect plus the extra protein you get from the ricotta.

Pancakes were exceptionally light. I only had whole milk ricotta on hand and frozen blackberries.  A good recipe for that little bit of ricotta that you don't know what to do with.  I would think any fruit would be delicious.

I made them using real eggs (used more eggs than it calls for) and real sugar.  They taste amazing.  You don't taste the ricotta,  just amazing fluffy pancakes!

Loved the taste! Removed one star because it was hard to cook. I am allergic to artificial sweeteners so I used sugar. I didn't have egg substitute so I used one egg. I added a little water to make it spreadable. I couldn't find the right length of time before I turned them and they were either burnt or somewhat raw inside.  But the taste was incredible. I will definitely try these again!

These are great made some substitutions thought.  For larger serving size 6-8. I added 1cup of ricotta buffalo.  6 tbs of flour , 6 tbs of coconut flour, 3 tbs of baking powder.  3 tbs of lemon juice.  3 whole eggs. 1 tbs of vanilla. Only water to mix.   Add the blueberries as desired. Perfection ????

OH MY GOSH!! These are by far the best pancakes I've ever had. I did use full fat ricotta but eliminated the sugar, I used 2 eggs and the vanilla other reviewers suggested also I used almond flour instead of AP. Excellent without butter or syrup- low carb friendly and extremely satisfying. Downside: next time I will at least double the batch, only made four 4" pancakes. Will be using this recipe every time  I make pancakes!

I used full fat ricotta cheese and substituted almond flour. A couple of the pancakes crumbled when I took them out of the pan so next time I will add an additional egg.  Besides that they were delicious and I plan on making this recipe a staple in my house.

These were pretty good, some of the fluffiest pancakes I've eaten. I took some of the suggestions from other reviews- adding vanilla and lemon juice, also added salt, nutmeg ( goes well with ricotta) and cinnamon. I did not add sugar, did not need it. I think next time I'll add zest of lemon instead of juice, more flavor.

Really good - and very fluffy the way I did them:
Separated eggs (I doubled the recipe and used 2 eggs) and beat the whites til fluffy.  Mixed the yolks with the ricotta and added 1 t vanilla (that's a lot but we liked it). Then I combined everything except the whites which I folded in.  After doing one pancake, I added about  a T of milk to the remainder to thin them out just a little - THAT was a good move!  Made 4 medium sized pancakes.

DELICIOUS! I've never made these before because, to be honest, ricotta cheese in pancakes didn't sound that good, but had some leftover ricotta so thought I'd give it a try.  WOW, am I glad. I prefer real, whole foods, so I did use sugar and real egg.  Added a splash of vanilla.  Forgot to try whole wheat flour.  This does make just a small amount, I doubled for myself and 2 kids, but if husband was home, would probably quadruple.  Oh, and I added a couple of splashes of milk at end to thin just a bit.

The only way to make pancakes!  I modified with 1 tbsp of coconut flour with 2 tbsp of white whole wheat flour. And, 1 tsp sugar with 1 tsp splenda. I used the recommendations from others with 2 eggs, vanilla, pinch of salt, and a good dosing of fresh grated nutmeg. I had frozen blueberries which I put in the batter frozen and they turned out perfect. I wished I had a lemon for the zest, but I'll try that next time.
These are delicious.

I made this with full fat ricotta and 2 eggs. Omitted the sugar, and added 1 tsp vanilla extract. I served the fruit as a topping with yogurt. They are good but custard-y and egg-y. If you don't like that sort of thing, fyi. My kid wouldn't eat it for that reason, so my making this again isn't likely.

I think this really has potential. But even when I finally got the temperature of my skillet right to where it wasn't too hot and the outsides of the pancakes weren't overcooking, I still had gooey, uncooked centers. The taste was fine, these just didn't cook right for me.

Weight Watchers has a similar recipe that is very yummy, but I misplaced it, so thanks for posting this! I use canned crushed pineapple thickened with a little cornstarch and make a sauce to pour over the pancakes. Instead of putting the fruit in the pancakes. I'll have to try it with blueberries. That is just how I have always done it. Nearly any fruit would work, because the pancakes themselves are sooooo delicious!! Thanks again!!

I give this one three stars for a few reasons. My first attempt resulted in pancakes that I probably would not eat again. They were not really cooked through, and a little mushy. Following the recipe, I found the batter so thick that I couldn't even mix it well so I added about a quarter cup of skim milk. This made my batter a great consistency but may have been the reason for the overall mushiness. I am also not a huge one for exact measurements, which hindsight has shown me is probably necessary for this recipe. I will try this again because the idea is still so good to me and I think I can get it right. I normally wouldn't down a recipe that failed because of user error but I still gave this one 3 stars because I believe that it needs to be tweaked somehow, just not the way I tweaked it this time.

With all-natural ingredients these are five-star.  We make them with real eggs, blue agave juice (low-glycemic), and whole wheat flour and a little lemon juice.  My family prefers them to any other pancakes when made this way, and they are far healthier than the ordinary carb-loaded version.

This did not turn out for me at. all. The batter looked okay but when I spooned
it on the griddle, it spread and didn't cook. Shame, I was looking forward to these. What a waste of ingredients.

I love ricotta so I loved these pancakes. I went for full fat ricotta and sugar and an egg rather than egg substitute.  It was a thick batter, so I wish I would've added some lemon juice like others suggested.  It stuck to my pan like crazy (I used Pam) so next time I'll just add a little oil and see what happens.

These seemed rather "mushy".  I had added some skim milk because the batter was so stiff, maybe that was the problem.

WOW---this recipe was excellent!  We were skeptical w/using ricotta but since we like ricotta, we thought--what the heck.  We enjoyed having a protein packed pancake--very tasty.  Thank you!!!

These were good and easy to make. I think next time I'll add a little salt or try mixing the ricotta with cottage cheese.

I made these for Fat Tuesday (pancake Tuesday) and my family loved them! The blueberry and ricotta flavors are delicious together. Thanks for a great recipe!

These pancakes are always light and very tasty. I made them for the first time after I made stuffed shells and had a lot of ricotta cheese left over...this is the perfect way to use the leftovers. My partner even requests them all the time. So delicious. Give these a try and you will not be sorry!

These pancakes were delicious! I didn't have any blueberries on hand, so I made them plain, and they were still very flavorful. I also added some lemon juice to the batter per other reviewers' advice. So good and so easy!

These are excellent. Very tasty and the kids loved them. I took advice from other reviewer and cooked them at a lower temp. They do cook very differently from regular pancakes. Do not sneak in extra blueberries, they make it hard for the pancakes to hold together. Stick with the recipe.

I really enjoyed these pancakes, thank you!  I used egg whites instead of the replacer, and they came out very well!  Topped with some broiled grapefruit slices, this was a great weekday brunch!

Hubby couldn't tell the difference between these and "regular" pancakes, but he devoured them all the same!  He gave them 5 stars though, and so will I because this is a good, easy, healthy recipe.  This is a great way to get a little more protein into your breakfast!  I used non-fat ricotta, whole wheat pastry flour, and I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and some lemon juice.  I did have to add a little milk because they seemed to thick.  I wonder if the thickness will depend on the brand of ricotta used?  Anyways, they were great!
