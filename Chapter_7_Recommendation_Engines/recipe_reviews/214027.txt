I had to rate this a 5!!  It is a wierd sounding recipe, but since odd flavors sometimes blend well, I tried it for an Easter lamb roast and once my guest started using the sauce, they couldn't stop!  It is perfect accompanyment for Lamb.  Thank you for the recipe

I was in charge of a Seder Meal and made 110 lbs of roasted lamb and knew I wouldn't have time to deglaze pans and make a gravy so with the great reviews on this sauce I made a million or so batches and wow what a hit.  It made me love lamb, not just tolerate it.  Thank you thank you for posting.

Excellent basic recipe. I only had lemon mint which worked great and used half the olive oil to save calories balanced by half the white wine vinegar. Next time I will double the tomato.  We love lamb and this will be part of a regular rotation.

I made this recipe to go with my Leg of Lamb for Easter.  It taste so good. Will use any left for salad dressing. I did use a full cup of mint instead of 1/2cup.

Loved this recipe! Was really surprised at how well the flavors blended. I used this on grilled lamb chops. I followed other reviewers' advice and went a little heavier on the mint (it wasn't overpowering at all), used only 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard and used 1 teaspoon of sugar. I didn't have enough white vinegar so I mixed it 50/50 with red wine vinegar. This would also work great as a salad dressing on a tomato salad with feta cheese. Thanks for the recipe! My first time ever making lamb chops and it was awesome thanks to this sauce.

This was good but I personally made a few tweaks. 1 tsp sugar and double the mint. Also the diced tomatoes were a little chunky for me so I put the mixture through the food processor at the end to smooth it out a bit. Wasn't what I was expecting but still a delightful pairing for the lamb !

It was great! My uncle usually makes the same thing only without the mint and tomato! But it was perfect with my meal. I made pasta with the mint chutney! And then this sauce with the beef I made instead of lamb cuz there was no good lamb at my store! So yea! My dad is a meat and potatoes kind of guy but he ate all of this!

My husband just discovered, after 50 years, that he actually likes lamb.  We tried this sauce and loved it.  The first time I made it I didn't have enough white wine vinegar so I substituted a sake vinegar and it was a little 'off' (perhaps heavy would be the right term to use).  Still, we liked it enough to know that it had great potential and was worth another try. After a trip to the grocery store and the correct ingredients assembled I tried it again and it was spectacular!  We have used this a number of times and passed the recipe on to numerous friends.  The mint and tomato gives a nice fresh taste and balances nicely with lamb.  We usually season lamb with Herbes de Provence and love the combination.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  Easy to follow, it needs no alteration.  I have ventured a couple of times using Cognac vinegar, which was good but really didn't add to the flavours.  At the end of the day we keep coming back to the original recipe.  Don't mess with perfection!  If you have someone who isn't fond of lambs 'lanolin-y' taste, this sauce could turn them around.  This has become one of our definite keepers and is a regular in our rotation.  Thank You Shandeen.

I used Rosemary instead of mint and used Garlic flavored Vinegar since that was all I had. I heated it up a little then added cherry tomatoes cut in half towards the end (they were still cool) and poured it over the lamb. Very good.
I would make it again.

A little too tangy.  Taste a bit better when you add more mint, less tomato, less dijon and plain greek yogurt.
