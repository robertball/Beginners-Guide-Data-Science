The perfect soup: simple, straight-to-the-point and genuine. The proportions of potato, leek and liquid are right on. The consistency is not too thick and not too thin; enough to coat the back of a spoon. I made this recipe in a pressure cooker in 10 minutes then using an immersion blender to smooth it out. I ended up tripling the cayenne pepper though. A tasty and warming way to get your vitamins. Thank you plasticRobot for your recipe.

First time review, because as a person who uses Allrecipes frequently, I typically start with those with a high volume of people who have rated positively, and was lucky I took a look at this one. It needs more 5 stars!  I rarely follow a recipe to a T, and I usually like to spice things up a bit more. But with health issues that limit safe foods for me, this looked attractive due to the simplicity of the ingredients. The result, it was perfect, made exactly with the ingredients and amounts noted (sans salt, I never add salt to anything.......with the exception of black truffle salt on a few select items).  The only thing I did differently, just because, no real reason, was put all the olive oil in at once.  And I added the cayenne pepper before using my immersion blender to blend the soup.  Was tempted to use more cayenne pepper, but it really was perfect with the exact amount mentioned.  I'm a non-meat eater, but even my carnivore husband enjoyed this one and ate several bowls of it.  Simple and delicious!  Always happy to find another good vegan/vegetarian soup to add to the mix!

This soup was quick, easy and delicious, but I made a few additions. I added fresh garlic while cooking the leeks. Once I combined the leeks and potatoes, I added garlic powder, thyme, paprika and parsley (saw another review with these additions). Then I blended about 2/3 of the potato mixture and added that back to the soup for a beautiful creaminess. Last, I added some frozen veggies--corn, carrots and green beans. Lots of flavor, still low fat, low calorie and amazingly easy and tasty. Love it!

This is a easy, healthy, low calorie soup and very tasty. I made it already several times and we love it. The only change I made, I put more leak. The recipe calls for one leak and I put two untrimmed or three trimmed leaks. Yummy soup!

Healthy, warm and tasty. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that I didn't think that the flavor had much depth- maybe not surprising since it's so quick and easy to make. Will definitely make again.

Tasted great! I replaced the cayenne pepper with a little white pepper instead since I am allergic to Cayenne.

Great soup.  I prefer it without any type of dairy so this fits with me perfectly.  I like to add some thyme into mine but that’s the beauty of soups like this... so delicious as is it with your own personal twist.

Even my kids raved about this - and didn't even miss the milk/cream that I usually add.  This couldn't have been more simple; I added more salt to taste, otherwise kept things basically the same.

The soup, when made per directions, is gravy consistency. So the second time I made it I used 3 leeks, 3 lbs potatoes, 2 32oz low sodium vegetable broth, and 1/2 tsp cayenne

Added a little ripple half and half 1/3 cup, 2 tbsp of lemon juice, tad of tofutti sour cream, dash of sage and thyme.  Used 1/2 oil and half vegan butter. Came out great!  Will leave a little chunky next time.

Great recipe - I added celery and garlic and 1/2 fennel bulb to sautéed leeks. Added cut up carrots to potatoes and cooked with 100% chicken broth. Puréed only half then added cubed ham and simmered for a couple of hours - awesome!!

I loved this recipe, which is actually vegan as well as vegetarian.  Very simple to make; blended it in my Vitamix with ease.  It was so good, I ate it all instead of freezing part of it (which had been the plan).  It is now my "comfort food" soup of choice.

My personal opinion is that it was slightly more bland than I prefer, but not by much.  I added more salt, some pepper and thyme.  I don’t have any Worcestershire sauce on hand, but that might do the trick for me.  But yeah, basically a better than decent recipe on its own.

I used yams rather than russet. They make the soup a little sweeter and they are more nutritious.

Definitely making this again! I love that it's creamy but dairy-free/vegan (which also makes it cheaper than many leek and potato soups, which have cream and/or cheese in them). It's hearty and very tasty. I froze a portion and it heated up really well - another reason for me to rate this 5/5! I covered the soup after adding the stock, water and potatoes, and used an immersion blender to puree, which I find more convenient.

Great soup.  I usually put a bit more salt and cayenne to give it more flavour but other then that it's so yummy. Fav soup!  Edit...make sure to use a good broth.  I tried some store brand cause they were cheaper and the broth lacked flavour causing the soup no be more bland.  Quality products = quality results.

I liked that this is a healthier option, but as others mentioned, flavor was lacking. I added half of a diced onion, garlic powder, rosemary, and a lot more salt. I think adding sour cream or milk would improve the flavor even more.

I used crush red pepper because I didn't have cayenne and I added a pinch of thyme,  otherwise followed this recipe and it is delicious!  I love how simple it is!

I found easier to use an immersion blender.

Too potato-y for my taste. I added 3 more cups of broth after I pureed it and even though I had used 2 leeks I would double or triple next it next time or add an onion for flavour.

we loved this soup! We are not vegetarians so I used chicken broth and drizzled a little (1/4 cup?) 1/2 and 1/2 over the top at the end. Also sprinkled each bowl with cheese.

This is a great recipe. I followed all the directions and I did make 1 change, which was I added Italian seasoning to mine. I only wish it was a tad more thicker, but it taste great. I had it with fresh French bread and it was very flavourful. It is low calorie and light, a great way to eat vegetables and get all your vitamins. It’s also fast to make after work. I will definitely make this again.

My family had never tasted leek before.  We were gifted several batches.  I found this recipe and tried it.  We all loved it.  We will be buying leeks and making this soup regularly.  We made as written.  Great served with warm bread.

This is my new favourite soup, I really loved it. So simple to make and very tasty. I doubled the cayenne pepper but I do like a bit of spice in my food and thought for 4 servings 1/8 teaspoon was a bit measly. I will be making this regularly from now on!

Excellent soup! I used chicken broth and blended just half of it because I like some chunks in my soup. Also added a splash of heavy cream to my bowl because my husband is lactose intolerant but I'm not!

This soup is insanely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I used more cayenne that was called for (I like heat... a lot), and it was so thick and delicious that adding additional thickeners like cream would have taken away from how good it is.

This is such a basic, easy, and really inexpensive recipe. The only thing I added and it really wasn't necessary was a pinch of sage. If I had had some thyme in the house, I might have put a pinch of that in as well.

This has a very pleasant flavor.  I followed all of the directions except for the puree part.  I was going to do a before and after taste test to see if the puree made any difference to the flavor.  Before tasted so good I never got to after.  The only complaints I would have is I thought it was a little too greasy, so I would use less oil next time and I don't know that the cayenne pepper was necessary.

My vegetarian daughter loves this soup. I have made it multiple times as it is described. The only difference is I used a hand held blender right in the pot rather then transferring it over to a separate blender. This way I can get a smoother texture which we all prefer.

This was very good. Followed the recipes with the exception of adding a little more chili at the end for personal taste. Also garnished with some cilantro just because I had it on hand and my wife will eat cilantro on everything.

Added more red pepper to cook into the broth, 1 clove of garlic (minced) and 1 1/2 tablespoons "Bavarian Spice Blend" from Savory Spices.   Then fresh basil and 1/4 c soy milk right at the end before pureeing using a hand blender.  Big hit!

I made this recipe recently for the first time and it came out amazing! I added other ingredients to adjust for my taste bus. This is what I did differenly: I used homemade veg broth (celery, kale stems, onions, chili pepper, tomato and parsely stems), I also added about 1.5 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp Cayenne pepper, 1 lemon + 2 ladels lemon juice, and about 1 cup extra frozen veggies ( corn, lima beans, green beans, carrots). And the garnish on top was a little  bit of paprika and chopped parsely.

I boiled the potatoes separately and then lightly mashed them and added the potato chunks with their cooking water into the pulverized leeks.  A bit chunky and very delicious!

I will make it again, but I really don't like it puréed. That's just personal preference. It's very tasty. I stirred ia couple drops  of Tabasco  into my own bowl. & loved a bit of heat in it!
