I've read so much about steak salads but none interested me enough to try them. So happy that I took a leap of faith and tried this recipe for my maiden voyage! Oh so flavorful! The "layers of flavors" spoke to every sensory tastebud in my mouth! I used Anjou pears, toasted chopped walnuts and a fine bleu cheese. What a pretty presentation with my perfectly grilled, marinated, tender beef steak as the shining star! My husband and I haven't been this WOWed in a long time. Due to circumstances the steak ended up marinating  for a full 36 hours. FABULOUS! We love a good steak and salad and this one is a true winner! Thank you Natl. Cattlemen's Beef Assoc.!

A very flavorful recipe in which the Balsamic did overpower the Maple Syrup. If it were me, I would cut back on the Balsamic & Pepper by 1/3 and double up on the maple syrup. Really enjoyed the pears & red onions. We paired them with Manchego Cheese & Walnuts. Beef, it's what's for dinner.

Great new marinade and flavors for our steaks!!  I would never be able to think of these flavor combinations myself.  I used a balsamic vinaigrette dressing as suggested in an earlier review, blue cheese, and almonds.  Delicious!  My husband is convinced that I can cook a better steak than most restaurants now - so he won't order one when we go out.  It's very complimentary!  Thanks for another great recipe and twist on a "regular" steak dinner.

The marinade was pretty bland for me - I even added Worcestershire as another recommended. I used feta cheese instead and thought the salad itself was pretty delicious.

My husband is a meat and potatoes type of guy and prefers his steak “unadorned,” however he thought this steak was delicious.  The marinade added good flavor while the beef flavor remained center stage.  I was surprised by the fabulous flavor combination of the grilled bosc pears and red onions.  I’m so glad I tried this and will be making it regularly.

Used chopped pecans, honey balsamic vinaigrette dressing, Anjou pears, and smokehouse bleu cheese. Amazing. We loved this. We would give it more stars if we could! YUM!

My family loves beef and we eat it regularly. This was not a great recipe for us as is. We didn't really care for the salad, the grilled onions were nice, and the steak was sweet which is an oddity to us. We added Worcestershire sauce to the steak marinade on the second batch and our steaks came out savory. When you add about a tbsp you really round off the flavors of the steak. Definite winner recipe with said adjustment.
