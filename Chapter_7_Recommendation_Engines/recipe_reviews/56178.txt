Very, very easy and husband-friendly.  I added a tiny pinch of sweet pumpkin pie spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice, ginger, and cloves to the brown sugar, and then served it pooled in the shells, letting the diners mash it themselves to their heart's content.  Some preferred to scoop out plain chunks and dip into the carmel sauce in the middle.

SOOO Much faster than baking and just as tasty!  My boyfriend would make this for me in the oven once in awhile but stopped because it took so long.  I am adding it back into our meals thanks to this receipe.  I made it today and it turned out great!

This summer my husband introduced me to acorn squash.  He said his mom made it alot growing up. I sliced this into 1" sections and covered with 1" of water and cooked for 10 in the microwave. Brushed with butter and sprinkled with brown sugar

I served this as dessert after a light lunch to company. Everyone loved it! It is perfect as written but I added a few Craisins and chopped walnuts before serving just for color and texture. Excellent. Thanks for sharing!

This is definitely an easy recipe to make, but I didn't think it was spectacular.  I prepared as directed, but I think I should have taken the advice of another reviewer and added additional spices.

What at easy recipe! I didn't take the squash out of the shells, pulled the flesh from the skin and mixed it with the melted butter and brown sugar in the hollow and just ate it from the shell. Next time I think I will do as you suggested, and remove the flesh with the butter and brown sugar, mix it up and serve it that way, I think it would be better, even thought we really enjoyed it the way I did it. I may try using a little less brown sugar and butter next time, I think I'd like more of the squash flavor, although my husband may not agree with that!  We at this with roast turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

If you're looking for a simple squash recipe, this is it. I would advise stirring in another tablespoon or two of brown sugar when you mash everything together in the bowl - and I'd increase the time frmo 10 minutes to more like 12. Finally, instead of mashing the squash in a bowl after cooking, I'd do the mashing in a small square pan - it's easier to mash things together than in a bowl. Then sprinkle some more brown sugar on the top and serve!

This was a standard when I was growing up...especially the year my mom planted acorn squash and we had kind of a glut on it. We always liked it. She would usually put some orange juice into them as well.

This was delicious - similiar to how my mom makes it, but much less time.  I added some cinnamon and a drop of vanilla. Will definitely make again!

This was fantastic!  I've done it this way before, but this time I cut the squash, placed it cut side down on a foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and baked for 45 minutes (I had 3 squash) then took them out, flipped them over and sprinkled with salt and pepper and cinnamon, put in 1/2 tbsp of butter then about a TBSP of brown sugar in each.  Then I just placed a piece of foil over the top and baked for about 15 more minutes.  My daughters boyfriend, who hates veggies and won't eat them announced "I like this!" then proceeded to eat it all.  Amazing!

Mom used to make these all the time. I am not a fan of Microwave ovens, as I believe they destroy the nutritional values of food, so I prefer baking them in the oven or on the grill.

This recipe is great! I can't wait to tell my MIL that acorn squash doesn't have to be baked in the oven. I cooked this for 10 minutes with half the butter and brown sugar called for and then when it was done, scooped it out and added Butter Buds and a little more sugar. I cut the calories in half but didn't lose any of the flavor! We both enjoyed this Soo much and I wished I had another one to cook the same night! It's that good :o) Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

The end result is exactly like baked squash, without the wait and extra electricity! I think 2 T butter and 2 T sugar is overkill -- half of that would suffice!

This is so delicious! My mom used to mkae this all the time and it brought back great memories. This was just as good as I remembered and so much faster in the microwave instead of the oven how she used to do it. My son wasn't too fond of it although he did try a bite, and hubby said it was okay, but he really isn't into sweet things unless they are choc chip cookies.

Delicious! It was sweeter than I expected Maybe I'll make it a dessert next time!I added craisins like some people suggested, which added a nice texture. My little 22 month old son loved eating it with me :)

added a bit of ginger and cinnamon in the cooking process and topped with cranberries and roasted pecans.  Wonderful addition to Pork.

Wonderful and I loved how much easier it was than baking!  I used ~1/2tbsp butter and a heaping brown sugar tablespoon in each half.

YUM!  I only had a small acorn squash, so I made half the butter/brown sugar mixture (I personally would use the full amount with a larger squash - seems more like a "treat" dish to me and I have to admit to enjoying the "yummies" in the middle!) and cut the cooking time accordingly.  Very good - my 8yo (my adventurous eater) enjoyed the other half with me.  Will definitely make it again.  Sprinkled with cinnamon before cooking as well.  It was fun to eat right out of the skin with the rest of our meal.

I'm not crazy about cooking with the microwave, but this recipe was really delicious. And fast to the table! Buttery and sweet... delicious! It really hit the spot on a cold wintry day.

Can I give this zero stars?? Sorry I hate to be the minority here, but this was just plain discusting. The taste was not good and the texture was horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. Infact, all of the squash that I prepared went right into the trash. Sorry, no one liked this at our house. I will never try another acorn squash recipe again.

My kids ate this in seconds and asked me to buy again.  I got none because they all gobbled it down.  Making it tonight for the second time adding pie spices tonight see how that goes.  Well kids ate it and asked for more no other explainations needed.

Delicious.  After microwaving the squash and adding the butter/sugar, I finished cooking in the oven. I did end up sprinkling a bit of salt to add a bit of a kettle corn taste.  Hit the spot.

Yum, and very easy.  The first time, I added chopped walnuts.  The second time I didn't - and I think I liked it better!

Yum - this is quick and delicious.  No need to use all of the butter and sugar as written - it tastes great with about half of each.  Be sure to turn during cooking as is written - I've made this twice and the second time forgot to turn it so it cooked a bit unevenly - still tasted good though!

My mom made this regularly during the winter when I was a kid.  It was one of my favorites!  I use less butter when I make it - less fat that way.  The kids like it just as well with about a two teaspoons of butter and a tablespoon of brown sugar in their half of a squash.

Super easy to make and a great side dish. Only 4 stars because it was a little too sweet for me. Whenever I make it now I cut back on the butter and sugar by 1/2. Great and quick recipe!

This recipe was delicious and simple!  My family (even the non-squash eaters) loved it!
