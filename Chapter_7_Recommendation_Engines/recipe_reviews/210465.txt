So good...with my substitutions! I didn't want to buy so many different bottles of liquor, so I bought rasberry vodka to combine the vodka and schnapps. Also, I used limeade instead of sweet and sour (can't stand s&s) and lime juice. It was perfect...not too sweet or sour. Yum!

If I could give this more than five stars, I would. This is very good, perfect blend of sweet and tart.  I made one last night and enjoyed it so much that I turned around and made another. NOTE: I didn't mix mine in a glass as directed, I used my martini shaker.

This was a hit at our Christmas party.  I could not find raspberry schnapps, so I used Island Punch Pucker.  I made a large container of it...YUM!  I also added a little green food coloring.  Very sweet, but very good!

This drink is too sweet. I tried a pitcher of these for a ghouls-nite-out.  The first couple sips tasted like grape soda, but by the end of the glass, I was not wanting a second.  The others obviously agreed, because the pitcher didn't get finished & I ended up tossing it.  I am considering doubling the alcohol only & using it for shooters @ our big Halloween bash.

Too sweet for my taste too. Glad I made a self serving before making for the party
