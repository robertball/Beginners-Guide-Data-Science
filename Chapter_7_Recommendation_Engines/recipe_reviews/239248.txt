I made this recipe and it is now my husband and my favorite chicken dish ever! It's so easy because there are hardly any ingredients but it's so good. I did a couple things differently though. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used a tablespoon of powdered garlic. I used olive oil instead of canola. I used a medium/small tomatoe and 1/4 of a large white onion both diced very fine.  Also the cooking is where I differed a lot. I put my chicken in a glass casserole dish and baked chicken in preheated oven at 375 until done(about 20 mins). Then when I pulled out the chicken I braised it on a medium high skillet covered in butter on both sides of chicken until the where dark golden brown spots on both sides. This was my version of grilling. The chicken was so tender and juicy with a nice seared outside. I also tried this recipe 2x and used twould different shredded chesses. The first time I used and Italian blend and it was great. The second time I used shredded parmigian and my husband said he liked that more. They both were good in my opinion I guess it comes down to preference. Also the absolute thing that makes this recipe is the actual bruschetta!!! It balances everything out so well!  I'm getting hungry writing this review it was so good.  We served with a creamy pesto pasta which was perfect!

Loved the flavor of the bruschetta mixture - and the seasonings worked beautifully on the chicken breasts. Perfect together! Made some cheesy bruschetta bread and green beans to serve alongside. Delicious dinner.

This was very good! I did make some adjustments, but stayed pretty true to the recipe. I used a grill pan indoors, brushed with Mazola corn oil to grill the chicken. Also, because I used frozen tomatoes from my garden instead of fresh (currently out of season), I decided to cook the bruschetta topping in the pan with the chicken. I used dried basil rather than fresh because I had it on hand. I also used fresh mozarella cheese instead of the bagged, shredded. It was delicious and flavorful.

This was so good and measurements are spot on! I used my own blend of Italian herb seasoning instead of spice islands brand (basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, marjoram). Didn’t have canola and subbed with olive oil. It’s been pouring rain for days here, so I seared the chicken in the cast iron for 3-4 min. p/side over medium-high heat. Topped the chicken breasts with bruschetta mixture, covered the pan and reduced heat to medium low while making sides. Chicken was cooked through and remained moist. Served over plain pasta (gluten free spaghetti) and side of steamed fresh broccoli. Can’t wait to try it on the grill!

I made this (almost) as written, and it has become a household favorite.  My only substitution is, instead of commercial Italian seasoning, I mix a little oregano, basil, garlic, parsley, and whatever else strikes me as my seasoning.  I also use olive oil, as I don't keep much else on hand.  A+++

A perfect bruschetta recipe! I love the cold bruschetta on top of the warm grilled chicken cutlet that is topped with melted mozzarella! I'll also be using this bruschetta recipe on top of slices of toasted Italian bread! Great recipe Mazola...thanks!

This was fabulous! The chicken was so moist! I added rosemary, chives and scallions from my garden too. Also, a chili pepper and a jalapeño to one of the chicken breast to spice it up a bit. Very tasty! All my boys loved it!!

Loved this. It was so quick and easy with great flavor and presentation. I threw this together for dinner last minute since I had most of the ingredients ( I substituted with olive oil and mozzarella cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly). My husband and I both loved it. I am planning on making this for my in-laws when they visit next month! Anyone have any suggestions for good sides to pair with this?

I made this with my 16 year old nephew for a family dinner (Sorry- no photo; we were too hungry!). We did not have access to a barbecue to grill the chicken; however, we did have a heavy cast iron pan.  It charred nicely in the pan and remained tender and moist.  Our birds marinated for 20-25 minutes.  We doubled our marinade so we’d have plenty for the meat and enough for a topping. We served ours on angel hair pasta with asparagus cooked with sautéed onions and garlic.  The whole family (his parents and sister, and my wife) repeatedly said how good it was. The only complaint was we only made enough for everyone to have one breast!  I rated this four stars ONLY because it was not grilled. I’ll make it again on a bbq and decide if I like it better grilled or in cast iron.

Made it for my sig other for dinner. He loved it. I baked it in the oven at 350 for 30-40min. I used white onion because that’s all I had on hand. I also added onion to to top while it baked. Wonderful dish.

Wonderful summer dish to prepare ahead and stick in the fridge until cooking time. I marinated the chicken for two hours but next time will aim for overnight  to get more flavor.

We made this twice with the only change the  second time being we cut the the chicken into strips prior to grilling.  We liked this dish this so well the first time we served this to guests the second time.  We simply serve this with french bread.

Have used this several times...always good...today I stepped it up and instead of putting all the toppings on top I improvised a pasta underneath w 1 can diced tomatoes, 1/2 onion, grated parmigiana cheese (self grated), and a balsamic vinaigrette using the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder in lord only knows what amounts. (Sorry) Probably could reuse the marinade recipe. Amount would depend on pasta used. I used about 2 cups dry and about a cup of marinade with my other amounts. Sooo good

Very yummy dish.  If I were to do it over (and I will), I would have marinaded the chicken for more than the 15 minutes recommended.  That, and make more of the dressing to go on after, that was delish!

Absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend this recipe. Hubby loved it and he isn't a big fan of chicken.  Full of flavor and juicy.  I used chicken breast tenderloins because that's what I had, and mozzarella cheese. Can't wait to make it again!

This has to be the best Bruschetta Chicken I have ever had!!! 
I hate recipes that everyone changes, but I do love little helpful hits so here is mine.
Instead of cutting up tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic (drained) and added more red onions.. 
It honestly was to die for!! My whole family couldn't  get enough of this.

This is a delicious and easy dinner!  The chicken came out so moist and flavorful, and I only marinaded about 30 minutes.  We grilled the chicken and served it with buttered rice cooked with diced onion, red pepper, and parmesan cheese.   We topped the whole thing with fresh basil.  It took about 30 minutes to get everything cooked and on the table.  Definitely going into our regular dinner rotation now!

I'll definitely make this again. Very easy and delicious. I bbq'd the chicken, about 5 minutes a side, and added the cheese at the end so it melted perfectly. I served it on a bed of diced romaine lettuce. So good! A perfect summer meal.

This was a very good recipe. I will make it again, but next time decrease the amount of italian seasonin and garlic. It was a little bit overpowering, but still delicious. I also baked it in the oven instead of on the grill. 30 minutes at 375 degrees.

This recipe turned out great! I drizzled more balsamic on top of everything at the end and I baked the chicken instead of grilled! I will definitely be making this again!

This is an excellent recipe!  Made it last night for the first time for an impromptu dinner party and it was a huge hit!  Only change I made was (by accident) I marinated the chicken in half of the bruschetta mixture, which had to be thrown out after, but I did spoon some of the mixture into the pan when I sauteed the chicken and it was amazing.  I served the chicken on a bed of angel hair pasta tossed in a bit of marinara topped with the bruschetta mixture and parmesan cheese.  Can't wait to make this again!

It came out really good, I added mashed potatoes with it and it reminded me of a dish that O'Charley's had on their menu. I will definitely make this again! :)

I really enjoyed this.  I made changes as well - olive oil for corn oil and used much less.  I also just used salt, pepper, dried basil and oregano for the spices in the marinade.  Made separate marinade for tomato mixture of just olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.  Next time I'll leave out the balsamic (or use it very lightly).  Added fresh basil to tomato mixture as well.

i used olive oil instead of corn oil, and it was fantastic. only marinated the chicken for about 15 minutes using the entire marinade, then mixing another batch to add to the tomatoes. it was so good, cooked on the grill as directed, it was very moist and flavorful will definitely make again, was a huge hit with everyone.

I made it just as written and it was EXCELLENT! Sides were Texas Toast and a salad. It's a nice refreshing summer meal. You need to give it a try.

Chicken not very flavorful. Maybe sprinkle directly with italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Bruschetta and oil goes great with serendipity bread.

We subbed the cheese for diced fresh buffalo mozzarella. When the chicken was done we put in a cast iron and spooned the bruschetta/mozzarella cheese mixture onto each chip breast. Yum! Great marinade! I will make this again!

Easy to make and the fam loved it;  said it was restaurant quality.  Basically followed the recipe but did not have fresh tomatoes so used canned and it was still very good.  Will make it again when I have fresh tomatoes from the garden.

This was a huge hit in my house!  I made exactly as the recipe stated, but, I doubled the marinade.  I had larger chicken breasts and wanted to be sure I had enough to coat them.   I marinated for about 10 hours and the chicken breasts had great flavor & were moist & delicious!  The bruschetta topping with fresh basil was a perfect accompaniment.

While I really like the idea of this recipe, it was a little too herby for our tastes. If I make this again, I will cut way back on the Italian seasoning or eliminate it all together, and just add more freshly chopped basil.
