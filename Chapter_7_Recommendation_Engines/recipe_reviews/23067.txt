I saw this recipe last night and decided to try it today on a group of 12 kids. It was very good (to me)and half of the kids ate it up. (The other half.......who knows?...it does look a bit "messy" when you serve it) I made a few "tweaks" to this recipe:
1)I cooked the beef, onion, garlic, salt and pepper ahead of time. (Then I was able to drain all the grease and not have that IN the casserole)
2)I used Cream of Mushroom w/ Roasted Garlic soup
3)After pouring the cream/milk mixture I sprinkled cheddar cheese all over it before the layer of Tator Tots.
4)Baked it for only 30 minutes since beef was cooked.
Yum! I'd make it again. Very easy and tasty.

This was awesome!  My pickiest son gobbled it up. I did not at the oats and added a layer of grated cheddar in between the soup and tater tots.  We will have this in the future.

This is just a little friendly FYI for those new to making Casseroles a.k.a. Hot Dishes:  you always cook the the meat (whatever kind that may be, except tuna) before putting it into the casserole dish.  It will not tell you to do this in many hot dish recipes, because it is, for the most part, understood.  You should use raw meat in a casserole/hot dish only when the recipe tells you specifically not to cook it before hand.  I hope this helps.  Great recipe.  It is an old common dish that most people will love.

This recipe was good.  Next time, I will cook and season the ground beef BEFORE I assemble the meal.  The recipe doesn't say to do this, and I ended up with a very greasy dinner.  So, if I decide to make this again, I will cook the beef first, then make the dish.  :)

Like it says this is an oldie...I also browned the ground beef and onion so that I was able to drain off the grease, skipped the oats (I can't stand oats and ground beef it is the whole moatloaf thing) added a can of veg-all and added a layer of cheese between the beef and tator tots...I cut the baking time down to approx 30 minutes since the beef is already cooked...this can be assembled up to the cheese layer in the morning put in the fridge pull it out just prior to dinner add the tator tots and pop it in the oven even the picky eaters like this one

I took other reviews advice and cooked the beef & onions first.  I also spreaded cheddar cheese before the tots.  This was definitely a "do again" from my guys!

I agreed with the other reviewers- fry up the hamburger with the chopped onion and diced garlic, drain, then put in the bottom of the casserole dish. I actually chopped up about half a large zucchini from my garden and added it to the onions and garlic as they sauteed (before adding the beef to the skillet) mainly just to add a veggie to this dish as it's a meal in itself. It was very delicious! Also, after I emptied the can of condensed cream of mushroom soup into the bowl, I refilled it all the way with milk instead of just half way. I'm not sure how it would have been with just half the milk, but I found the amount of creaminess to be perfect with how I did it. I also did similar to another reviewer and laid some slices of cheddar down- I put mine on top of the soup layer, so it actually went: meat, soup, cheese, tater tots. Then upon serving I added a few grates of cheddar on top of the hot dish once it hit the plate. Wonderful! And the kids LOVED it!

My husband loves tater tots but I rarely ever buy them. When he saw this recipe on our meal plan he smiled form ear to ear. I fried the beef and the onions first and drained the fat and I didn't add the quick cooking oats. It was delicious and will become one of our regular meals.

This received raves here. Very hubby and kid friendly too. I used a couple of tablespoons of dried onion and a sprinkle of garlic powder on the meat along with a bit of low sodium Season Salt. I had to tweak and added a splash of worstershire sauce to the milk/soup mix. The last 3 minutes I added a slice of american cheese to the top. Hubby requested some chili in this next time like chili cheese tots. I can't believe how easy this was and no dirty pots and pans only 1 little casserole dish. I prepped the dish with some non stick spray. Awesome oldie but goodie. Thanks Terrie!

Very good!  I did add corn and peas as well as worcestershire sauce while browning the hamburger (I browned it ahead of time).  A typical Midwest casserole that is yummy and comforting!

As other reviewers I cooked the ground beef and onion together with a bit of garlic.  I left out the oats also.  This dish turned out nice and cheesy, very good and quick to put together.

I make an even easier version of this:

Meat in bottom of baking dish.

Lots of worcestershire sauce on top.

Mushroom soup on top of that.

Tater tots for top layer.

It tastes great!

I really like this!! I cooked the ground beef and onions and garlic sale first, also skipped the oats and sprinkled cheddar on like others suggested. I added green beans to the beef after it was browned and it made a nice all in one meal. The kids really loved it. The only suggestion I have is to make sure you make it in a pretty big pan (9x13 AT LEAST) so that the tater tots will all fit on top. YUMMY!!

Ends up with half as much meat as potatoes.  next time i make it I'm going to add an extra pound of hamburger and maybe a 1/2 bag of peas?  Good flavor, and very kid-friendly, my 2 year old helped make it.

My daughter loved it after i argued with her to try it for 30 minutes because she doesn't like tator tots. She wants it again this weekend, I think I'm going to add some corn this time.

My husband and grandsons love this dish.  I add a bag of frozen corn on top of the hamburger before the tater tots. You can substitute cream of chicken soup or cream of celery. Very good, quick and easy!

This is a good base recipe but doesn't make much food. I browned 1.5lbs ground beef, then sauteed the onions. Combined those with the soup, milk, about a quarter cup each of frozen peas and corn, generous salt, pepper, and garlic powder. No oats. I had to put this in a smaller casserole dish because it doesn't make much, even with the extra half pound of beef. Covered with half a package of tater tots, and baked at 375 for about 40 minutes. It's very tasty. I think you need to at least double the recommended amounts for a full casserole serving.

I browned the beef and onions with tons of seasonings including garlic and even some dashes of taco seasonings.  I also added some frozen french freen beens and chedder cheese to the layers.  Also, I took other's suggestion and baked the tots before hand so they weren't soggy.  Turned out ok, very filling meal.  But, nothing spectacular.  The best part were the tots!  I think next time, I'll try a different cheese/veggie combo.

I add 2 Tablespoons of dry Lipton onion  mix to the soup mixture and 1 tablespoon worchestire sauce as well. Wasn't this called originally the "Firemans Casserole"? With that recipe it called to add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese the last 5 min. of baking.  Good Stuff!

This recipe went over very well with the kids. We enjoyed the dish as well. I did not put the oats in, I just substituted the cheese in place of of the oats.

this an old recipe my father use to make all the time. he always used half a can of mushroom and a half of can of cream of chicken and put it in. no one in our family liked mushrooms and it makes a world of diffrence. i defintly reccomond cooking the beef before hand as well.

I added chedder cheese like one reviewer said. Otherwise I made it exactly as directed. It's not bad, but not very good either. I don't think I'll make it again.
