First time I tried this I used all the butter specified. It was so delicious, but also so greasy I couldn't eat much. Since then, I've at least halved the amount of butter specified and it tastes just as good. Either way, my family (kids included) LOVE it.

For years, at Thanksgiving I had always made Scalloped Corn using crackers.  This year I still wanted to serve Scalloped Corn, but wanted to 'update' the recipe by making it a bit more exciting.  I came across this recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  My family LOVED it!  It was the hit of our Thanksgiving Dinner. From now on I will use this recipe when making Scalloped Corn. Thanks!!

Yum! Cut the butter in half & used half the sugar with a Jiffy cornbread mix (which is already sweet). Just like Grandma's!

This was good but changed the recipe a little. Only used 1 Tablespooon of sugar since I used jiffy corn bread mix and it is already sweet. Also tried it once with the butter called for and had a hard time getting it to be done in the middle so tried it again with only 1/3 c. butter. It was much more evenly baked the second time. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe several times and have made some adjustments.  I used 1 can of cream corn & 1 can of yellow corn, used 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup of the corn muffin mix, add bacon bits, green onion, 1 cup cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup of the butter, garlic powder, onion powder, Top with bread crumbs & dust with papirika and parsley.  It is a hit everytime.  Enjoy!!

Great side-dish!  I did omit 1 tbsp of the white sugar, and the sweetness was just right.  I think it would've been too sweet with the second tbsp. Easy and good!

This is awesome! The only thing I changed was to use half the butter, that was plenty. I also used 1 can whole kernel corn and one can cream style. Very yummy!

I typically don't like when people completely change the recipe and then review it, but I'm going to do that here--sorry.  I followed the advice of Busy Bee and this recipe turned out amazing.  The changes are as follows:
1 can of cream corn
1 can of yellow corn
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup corn muffin mix
Bacon bits (I probably used 1/2 cup or so)
Green onion (maybe 1/4 cup)
1 cup cheddar cheese
1/4 cup butter
2 eggs (as per original recipe)
Garlic powder (a couple tsp probably)
Onion powder (same as garlic powder)
Also, I omitted the sugar in the recipe.
Top with bread crumbs & dust with papirika and parsley.
With these changes, the recipe was a huge hit...though I'm sure it was wonderful as written (which is why I still gave it 5 stars).  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe, and thank you, Busy Bee for the great recommendations!!!

I've made this twice now and loved it each time.  The second time, I added a bit more corn and think I liked it a little better that way.

I've made this over a dozen times as written, and we just love it. Tonight, I decided to try modifying it. Added 1 c. Colby jack, minced garlic, pepper, onion powder, and I drained the corn. Honestly, the garlic didn't add much, the pepper was unnecessary, the cheese was pretty good, but in my opinion, the original recipe is just as good

This was good. I had never had it before and thought I would give it a try. I did cut the butter back as others as suggested. I had something similuar to this a few years back, but it was way better than this recipe. But over all this was good, and makes a good side dish.

I tried this variation of creamed corn for my family.  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was just odd. Everyone in my family agreed, this one was not a keeper. I think it was the sour cream that gave it a strange flavor, or perhaps the corn muffin mix.

This recipe has a great flavor to it! That being said, it is also very rich. Try reducing the amount of sour cream by 1/4 cup, the taste is still great!!

This is a great side dish for any meal.  I omitted the sugar as the muffin mix is quite sweet already. I also add 2 cups of frozen corn kernals and add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the topo about 10 minutes before dish is done.

This stuff is amazing. I've made it twice now...once as written, and once I cut the butter in half, used fat free sour cream and added an extra box of Jiffy corn muffin mix. Liked it way better the second way. Everyone at the family reunion requested the recipe and had second and third helpings! :)

Came on to find a recipe like my mom made when I was young.. with soda crackers.  This version is WAY better.  My whole family loves it.  Making it tonight for about the fifth time since I found it about a half year ago! I use jiffy mix and don't add the sugar. no need.

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I read the recipe, but it wasn't what I expected. It was actually better. I've made scalloped corn with a cracker layer on top but never with cornbread mix. I wasn't sure how it would go over and most of my family thought it was a corn bread pudding. I'll make it again.

I subbed yogurt for the sour cream and left out altogether the butter. To the mix, I added half of a large onion (chopped in processor) and black pepper. I skipped adding any sugar. It was very tasty. I enjoyed it very much!I also found it was very soupy and took a LONG time to bake until it wasn't runny inside.

Very good recipe.  I did not add the sugar and it was sweet enough.  I also sprinkled smoked paprika on top.

Great recipe as is, so the second time I made it I added lima beans as my father-in-law loves succotash, but I needed to find a way that others would eat it. This was perfect! Thank you Carla for a wonderful recipe, that is extremely easy to adapt for all tastes!

I love the way this casserole turned out. I used 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of yellow and white corn. I also added about 12 ounces of dry corn muffin mix to give it a more cake-like texture. I will be using this recipe not just on the holidays but year-round!!

I have made this recipe for years, and it is a must for Thanksgiving in my house!  We love it, and we like it even better when I use one can of creamed corn and one can of regular corn (drained).

I followed this recipe exact and although this TASTED awesome,  it never got done enough to serve for dinner.  It was goo inside and brown/nearly burned on the outside after baking longer in an attempt to soak up the sticky gunk.  Next time I will add more Jiffy mix and hope it's texture is more cake-like, rather than pudding.  The taste was FOR SURE worth another try!  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Very good, amazes me how the cornbread rises o the top of the mixture and looks like something that would take a lot of time and effort to make.  So easy.  Next time I think I will use another can of corn though, so good you there is not enough!!  Thanks!!
