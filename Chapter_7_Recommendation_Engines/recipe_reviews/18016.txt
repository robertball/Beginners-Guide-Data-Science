I took the roast out when it was 140 degrees (rare). By the time it sat for 10 min. it was medium rare which is exactly what we wanted. This tastes like roast beef from a nice restaurant. The salt crust does not produce a salty tasting meat. Great recipe!!

This was a huge hit on Christmas Eve. Everyone raved about how tender and juicy the meat was. This was my first attempt at a roast so I can vouch for the easiness of the recipe as well.

This recipe works great. Just be sure to line the pan with foil as indicated (don't use cooking spray) and when drying the roast be gentle and try not to remove the spices. Be sure to show your guests the roast before you put it in and after you take it out - they'll be horrified by all the salt you use and fascinated at the salt crust after the roast is done. The roast itself comes out delicious. Don't buy a cheap roast - this recipe won't make tough meat any more tender (go with a slow cooker reciped if you have a cheap roast sitting around). Oh and ignore the "sodium" amount in the nutrition info - obviously it's wrong because it figures you'll consume the salt.

When I make a beef roast at the holidays this is the Only one I make. It is perfect and if it isn't broke who am I to try and fix it? This could not be more simple marinade the meat make a salt paste and build it up around the roast. use foil to line the pan this is Very important! When you go to clean up you will Thank me! Trust me you have better things to do then try and scrape salt off your roasting pan:) This roast browns up beautifully. While it cooks the salt hardens just break it off. Do Not Worry about the saltiness not overly salty. Try it once and you too will be telling your friends about it too! Thank You Marc You Rock!

This was wonderful! My husband does not like roast that much he is more of a pizza man. I served this for the first time at Christmas dinner. Everyone raved. I allowed the roast to marinate for at least 24 hours. So flavorful.

I am making this again tonight but first made it back in 2003 (?). It was an easy was to prepare the tenderloin while we entertained our guests. As others mentioned the salt crust presentation is a fun novelty enjoyed by the guests. 12/2010 update: used a 6 pound tenderloin for a larger crowd. Turned out great. Warning: leftover meat is really really salty the next day!

I made this for dinner. It was the best roast beef I ever made! I made one little tweak: added 2T balsamic vinegar to the marinade. This cooked pretty quickly; faster than my calculations. I was sure I dried it out especially because the crust cracked. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was perfect. I would make it again (and again). Thank you Marc.

When I lived in Brazil I saw at numerous occasions that they do it this way with the salt crust and every time it had been a huge surprise as to how tender and tasty the meat were.

This was a whole new experience for me and it came out really well. I marinated overnight flipping the bag occasionally. When it came time to make the paste I had to add a little more water than called for because the salt was still too dry and not "pasty" enough to adhere. You really just need to get in there with handfuls of the salt paste and smoosh it around with your hands packing it as tightly as possible. I had no problems getting it to stay put. When the roast was done the salt crust pretty much came off in big pieces. (very easy to remove and discard) and remaining salt was easily brushed away. This technique provided a perfectly cooked roast beef that everyone enjoyed.

I sure expected this to be alot better based on the previous reviews. Possibly because I couldn't get the salt paste to adhere to the roast even while carefully using the exact amount of water. It kept dropping off the sides. Then the rest of it cracked and fell off during baking leaving only a "hat" of salt on the top. The marinade was nice and I let mine marinate at least 24 hours. But the roast was about average as far as tenderness and moistness goes. No extraordinary flavor really. Not bad certainly but I probably wouldn't bother again.

This is the best thing I ever cooked! I did not pat the roast dry I just held it for about 30 seconds & let it drip dry. My salt didnt turn into a paste (using the exact amount stated) so I poured what was left the oil/herb mixture in & mixed it by hand. It was still not a paste but I packed it on anyway. This came out PERFECT and I will DEFINATELY make this again.

This is also awesome with a pork loin; in fact I do it with pork loin instead of beef most of the time.

I was hesitant with all the salt but it was truly unbelievable! Letting it sit for 15-20 minutes after wards really helped sealed in the juices. We are making this for guests on New Year's Eve because I am confident they will enjoy it!

I thought that this was a moist cool way to cook beef and I liked the taste it gave. I only gave it 3 stars because I thought that it was very salty - at least the outside of the meat was where the salt crust was and some particles remained. I love salt so it worked out well for me but I noticed that it was too salty for other people. If I made it again it would only be for me and my salt-worshipping friends!!!!

I love this recipe for all cuts of beef but especially Prime Rib. I've been using it for years and every time I make it I have to share the recipe. I cooked it exactly as stated but have found a secret to make the crust stay on better. Add equal parts flour and salt then mix with water. Cook the roast about 20 minutes then remove and repair any cracks with leftover salt/flour mixture. I also use a disposable foil roasting pan with a cookie sheet underneath for support.

This turned out nicely and was super easy to make. I used rock salt instead of kosher salt because it is what I had. It works to the same effect however it won't "paste" like the kosher salt might. I just piled it on and let the roast set for 20 minutes before breaking the crust off and it turned out just fine. Very yummy the marinade makes a positive difference from just rubbing in the herbs as I have in the past and makes it that much easier and less messy.
