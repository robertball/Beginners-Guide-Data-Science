I replaced the water with chicken stock, omitted the boullion and used more potatoes. All in all, a very delicious and satisfying soup. Thanks so much Sue!

If you make this recipe as stated, it's way too salty (as I had feared with all of the boullion cubes and salt) and it doesn't have enough potatoes for me.  I would suggest reducing the salt you add or omitting it altogether as the cubes have enough themselves.  Also, I used 3 cups of potatoes which still wasn't quite enough so I'd recommend 4 cups.  This recipe has potential but just needs a little tweaking.

Super delish!!! Like other reviewers, I added more potatoes. I used almost 4 cups. This was really quick and didn't call for lots of ingredients. It has a wonderful taste...two of my children (6 yr old and 3 yr old) insisted on having a serving right away! I can't wait for hubby to come home for dinner! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very yummy soup and with surprising results - my two young children LOVED it!  I suggest adding twice the amount of potatoes...but other than that, this will be a recipe we will make again and again!

Very very good flavor in this soup. I added 3 cups of potatoes, but sure wished I'd used another 2. I only added about 1/8 tsp black pepper to the soup before I served it. I'd give this 5 stars if I didn't think it needed double the potatoes called for. As it is though, it wouldn't feed 4 people, as it only fed 2 here. My son had seconds (he's a growing teen). Definitely a keeper. Thanks Sue!

Two cups of potatoes are not enough.. I ended up using three medium size potatoes. I didn't think the soup was thick enough so next time I'll use a little more flour.  As for taste... This is a five star soup.  I ate three bowls of soup and skipped the rest of my lunch!

My husband loves this soup!  He likes a little more onion though, and chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes.

After reading other reviews, I increased to 1/2 medium onion, 3 cups potatoes, and substituted 1 can chicken broth & 1 bouillon cube (instead of 1 c water & 3 bouillon cubes).  Also added 2 c frozen corn.  This hit the spot on a cold Nebraska day!

I'm not sure why this is called Swiss Potato Soup since it uses cheddar.  I used swiss cheese and it's amazing that way!  I used chicken stock instead of boullion and tossed in a little cooked crumbled bacon that I had on hand.  This way I only had to add a pinch of salt.  The thickness is perfect.

I learned how to make this recipe and now I just add all kinds of goodies to it. usually some chopped ham, and a little instant mashed potato to thicken it up! (I have a hard time thickening soups period) It's my"family recipe"
