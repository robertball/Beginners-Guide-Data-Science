This was very good.  I only had yellow cornmeal on hand and they still turned out good.

I was looking for a recipe that was close to IHOP's cornmeal pancakes and I found it!  These were so good.  I only changed the blue cornmeal to yellow cornmeal and they were great.

I love making blue cornmeal pancakes!  I was using another recipe, but saw this and decided to try it.  It's a little time-consuming, because you have to use 3 bowls to mix everything together separately.  They ended up tasting pretty similar to my other ones.  I didn't have pine nuts, so I dropped in frozen blueberries and it was very good.  I used an electric griddle and cooked at 350.  I ended up having to put in a little extra milk.  Instead of 3/4 cup of white flour, I put in 1/2 cup of whole wheat and 1/4 cup of white.

These were great! I used less than 1 Tbl. of butter and yellow cornmeal, and they turned out PERFECT! I think next time I'll use 1 TBL. of honey instead of the white sugar, since that's a more authentic cornbread ingredient.

These were truly delicious and I will be making them again & again! Also, they're great with a cinnamon & sugar mixture sprinkled on top!

I had some excess cornmeal that needed to be used, and found this recipe in my search.  I substituted white cornmeal for the blue, increased the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  Once mixed, the batter was pretty thin, so I added another half cup of flour.  With the adjustments, these pancakes were quite delicious!

My four kiddos and I had this for lunch today. Didn't have an egg or blue cornmeal (had yellow) and this recipe rocked. No leftovers at all. We are all full and it was wonderful! Thank you so much!

I used yellow cornmeal and whole wheat flour and they came out great! they had a corn bread like taste, which is why i wanted to make this recipe. I wasnt sure about pine nuts for breakfast but i used them in some and it was good. they taste great with peanut butter on top.

Fantastic tasty recipe, didn't have pine nuts, but didn't miss them!  Oh, and just as a health note, blue cornmeal has 20% more protein than yellow, and a MUCH lower glycemic index, so for all those who are watching their diet, this is a great recipe!  Worth the trouble to search out some blue cornmeal to be able to have pancakes without the guilt :).

Wow, these are delicious!  Tender and perfectly seasoned.  I used yellow cornmeal, I left out the pine nuts, and I had to add a few extra tablespoons of milk to get the batter to be the right consistency.  These really hit the spot.

We loved these pancakes! I found Arrowhead Mills blue cornmeal in my local health food store and I bought it just for this recipe.I've been on a pancake kick lately and I've been trying a different recipe each time.This is definately one of our favorites.I put blueberries on a few of the pancakes before flipping instead of pine nuts and they turned out delicious.I only used 1/4 tsp of salt after reading a few reviews they were too salty. I used wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose and they turned out perfect!

A great alternative to standard pancakes.  Have served for breakfast with maple syrup or honey.  Have also used as a savory pancake along with pork green chile or meat/veg mixtures (similar to tomales) topped with cheese, salsa, sour cream, etc.   I have found that starting with a hot cast iron pan/griddle (and we also use butter to prevent sticking) adds a crisper texture that is key for the savory style.

I used regular Corn Meal, and the pancakes were flat and dry.  I think if I would have used Blue Cornmeal, it would have been better.

These were REALLY good. Some people thought they were too salty, but usually recipes are too sweet for me. So I just left the measurements as is, and it was perfect.  The only thing is I thought 2 Tbs. per pancake was a bit much. I don't know if it's because I didn't use a cast iron, but the first ones were too greasy. Haha, I almost added butter as a topping and then was like, "uuuuh, no!! I think we've had enough!" Anyways, I highly recommend!

These came out uniform and perfect. My husband is the pancake person in our household and very particular about texture and taste when it comes to cornmeal pancakes; he rated these 5 stars. I FINALLY found a recipe he likes (loves!)!!! Thanks.

These were delicious! I used yellow cornmeal and omitted the pine nuts. I cooked on medium heat on a griddle. These pancakes brown very quickly, but the insides remained undercooked. This made them very hard to flip, so I recommend making smaller pancakes. This recipe made 14 4" pancakes, each using 1/4 cup batter. You've got to try these!

These pancakes were AMAZING!

I used yellow cornmeal, coconut oil instead of butter, almond milk instead of regular milk, and no pine nuts. 
Other than that I followed the recipe and they were so good, as well as filling!
Making them again for sure!!!

I've made these pancakes so many times that I figured I should review it. Ubergrrl deserves 5 stars for such an awesome recipe. Thank you!

I use yellow cornmeal instead of blue and the hotcakes have always turned out delicious. Instead of using pine nuts, I always throw fresh or frozen blueberries in right after I pour the cakes on the griddle. I recommend trying this!

I experimented with leaving the sugar out since I thought that the cornmeal would already be sweet enough. Not a good idea! Leave the sugar in. It's not a huge amount anyways.

These were very good. I did not add the pine nuts but did add blueberries. Would be good with a tad of lemon zest as well. It was not lacking any sweetness. Once you add the syrup, it is plenty sweet.

I wanted to make these so badly that I just used regular yellow cornmeal. The batter was so easy and quick to make, and the pancakes were super topped with a little butter and maple syrup, and I even liked them with peach jam on them.

Great recipe! Been in New Mexico for 23 years and always looking for ways to incorporate blue cornmeal into my menu planning! Second time I made them totally healthy and guilt -free. Substituted the following: No sugar - as sweetened items are usually poured/spread on top, 2 egg whites vs. 1 egg, unsweetened almond milk/soy milk vs. cow's milk,
2 T olive oil/grape seed oil vs. butter, whole grain flour vs. white flour, roasted/unsalted sunflower seeds vs. piñon nuts.

Simple, quick, and easy!  I should also mention that they are tasty.  This recipe made two waffles.  I used honey instead of sugar and added pecans.  The honey was good, but I would skip the pecans next time.  I was a little iffy about the consistency of the batter, but it worked well for waffles without additional milk.  I did use oil instead of butter and whole wheat flour.  The husband - who usually drenches pancakes in syrup - was very pleased with the flavor and we sued jams, raspberry coulis, and greek gods yogurt.  I will definitely be making this again....thanks!

These were really great pancakes. I was a little worried about the corn meal but it added a fantastic texture and taste making the pancake much more unique. I suggest cooking in butter for flavor, delicious with syrup. I used yellow cornmeal because that's what I had on hand. I think be careful to leave on a little longer than you might think to make sure center is cooked through. Will make these again!

A new family favorite! The batter was a little too runny so I had to add about 2 1/2 Tbsp of extra flour. I also suggest cutting the added salt in half, because we could taste the salt. All in all, they were really yummy and hearty! Great with strawberry preserves!

I've made this several times now, and I absolutely love it. I make the batter a litter more runny with more milk and butter because I like thinner pancakes. My husband isn't a big pancake lover--he usually eats only one, but when I make this recipe, he'll eat two! I make the same substitutions and omissions that everyone else makes, because who really has blue cornmeal and pine nuts in their cupboards...

My fussy five year old and I really enjoyed these.  I just aquired a bag of coarse blue cornmeal, and had no idea what to with it.  Now I know.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this recipe and followed it to the letter (except I used yellow cornmeal).  Very good!  A little fussier than regular pancakes to make but well worth the time.  Cooked in an electric skillet and they came our perfect!  Thank you for the recipe.

Yummy! I used it for waffles - you will probably have to add more milk for the right consistency. Nice taste of Santa Fe!

I have not been able to find the blue cornmeal so I use the yellow. My family and I really enjoy this recipe. I make it with white rice flour and it turns out very good. One needs to cook it slowly so the puffy insides get fully cooked.
I found some blue cornmeal on a trip to the four corners area. As soon as we got home I was able to try the recipe with it. Yummmm. I am not sure there is a big flavor difference but the color is very appealing. I used regular wheat flour this time rather then rice flour like last time and I used 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk.

After making these several times and substituting diferent things we came up with our favorite.  I use yellow corn meal(instead of blue), graham flour (for the all-purpose), coconut milk (instead of cow), olive oil(for the butter) and pecans (instead of pine nuts).  Yummy! They were good as written, but I love recipes I can make my own.

Pretty darn good twist on a pancake recipe. Kids loved having blue-ish pancakes. The recommendation to let them cook slightly long was dead on as this batter seemed moister and heavier than normal pancake recipes. I would also advise mixing just enough to get everything well blended. I stirred mine quite a bit and the pancakes ended up less fluffy than they could have been. All in all though, the me and the kids liked these more than our normal pancakes and they are already asking to have these again next weekend.

I made these with yellow cornmeal.  They were a big hit with my kids.  I will try next time with the 1/2 cup whole wheat next time.

They were really awesome:) The pine nuts are a great addition. I am gluten free so I substituted 3/4 cup of gluten free baking flour instead of the white flour and added a full cup of blue corn mix, because 3/4cup wasn't enough for the batter to be the proper consistency. Next time I am gonna use Prickly Pear Syrup, this is what I had on a recent trip to Tuscon:)

Very tasty!  I used yellow cornmeal and left out the pine nuts because I didn't have any.  I added blueberries to some of the pancakes, and my kids gobbled them up with maple syrup.  I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  I still prefer the texture and taste of traditional, fluffy pancakes, but these were perfect for a morning when I didn't have quite enough flour for my usual pancakes.  Thanks!

This morning I was in the mood for something different from our usual weekend breakfast rotation. So of course I came here, and I'm so glad I found these pancakes. Husband and I had a conversation that amused me mightily and summed up any review I'd care to write:  Husband: What're those? Me: Cornmeal pancakes. I got the recipe from allrecipes.com. Husband (reaching over to snag a freshly cooked pancake): Mmmm...tell soccermom37 I said thanks. Me (looking at recipe): Actually, her name is UBERGRRL. I'll be sure and let her know. Husband: Wow, she even spelled "grrl" right. You guys should be BFFs. Me (taking a bite of yummy pancake): Mmmmm...Oh my gosh, we totally should.   Like most others, I used yellow cornmeal, and I substituted White Whole Wheat Flour. Delicious, especially with pure maple syrup! Thanks!

We thought these were really great. I added honey instead of the sugar like other reviewers did, but I don't think I added quite enough. Wasn't as sweet as I would have liked so I will add more next time. The actually corn cake was delicious and wasn't too gritty. Just the way I like it! I didn't use pine nuts because I don't like them. :)

I guess I was the only one who did not love this recipe. The pancakes looked great, cooked easily, and the texture was perfect. I didn't have any problems with a thin batter like some people reported. But the flavor was bland and salty. 1 teaspoon of salt is far too much. They did not go well with the maple syrup I served them with. I think these have potential, if you decrease the salt by half and up the sugar. Or, if you add corn kernels, salsa, and cheese and keep the 1 teaspoon of salt, they'd be good as savory pancakes.

Love these. Followed the suggestion of using honey instead of sugar and that was great. As with many, I use yellow corn meal. I make these often. I've only made with pine nuts once and didn't care for the added value versus extra expense. They are great with blueberries though.

These were very good. I skipped the pine nuts and didn't replace them with anything (don't like them). I also skipped the last mixing step--I combined my baking powder with my boiling water/cornmeal mixture, stirred it to get it nice and wet, then added my egg mixture, then finally all the flour. They worked out great :) We had them with fresh bananas, peanut butter, & fruit syrup. I do not advise using chunky peanut butter on pancakes :( The little peanuts make an awful presentation!

I've never had cornmeal pancakes, but I thought they sounded tasty and would be a nice brunch alternative to regular pancakes. I didn't have blue cornmeal so I substituted yellow. I cut the salt in half (as I do with all recipes)and omitted the nuts. I also traded out vegetable oil for the butter. I used yogurt instead of the milk because I thought it would not only make the batter less runny, as other reviewers had mentioned, but the acid in the yogurt would react with the baking powder to give more rise. Although these weren't overwhelmingly corn-y, we did like the flavor. They came out light and fluffy. I think next time I make these I might add in some corn kernals and cheddar cheese and maybe serve with salsa instead of syrup for a more savory meal.

These were yummy! The only change I made was that I used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour for some of the flour called for and I used oil instead of melted butter. They turned out great and I served them with some leftover cinnamon honey syrup from the Taste of Home chocolate chip pancakes on this site. Went together perfect!

A great father's day breakfast this am. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. I substituted half yogurt for the milk and it took care of the runny complaint some reviewers  raised. I also substituted dried currants for the nuts as we didn't have any pine nuts. Might try macademia nuts next time only as my husband still remembers macademia nut pancakes from Hanalei Hawaii, 3 years prior. I also used half whole wheat flour (as always) without noticing a difference.

These are great!  My hubby mentioned cornmeal pancakes, so I searched them.  First I tried Johnnycakes because it was a quick recipe.  It was cornmeal, milk and butter.  Very bland w no flavor.  My little boy (almost 2) came over and opened his mouth saying "too yucky, take it out."  We threw them out ans started over.

Next I used this recipe with yellow cornmeal and no pine nuts (i didn't have any)  They turned out great.  The batter was pretty runny, but it made thin fluffy pancakes and he just loved them.  We topped with honey. My kids also gobbled them up and had seconds.  GREAT RECIPE!

This is so far my favorite pancake recipe. I usually cut the recipe down by one half, skip the butter, and use one egg. I would suggest that everyone who loves cornbread tries this. It's absolutely delicious and comes out perfectly fluffy everytime.

We already loved cornmeal pancakes and were eager to try these.  I finally found the blue cornmeal (Arrowhead Mills) at our Whole Foods.  I made them for breakfast this morning.  I loved them with wild blueberry spread, but my husband preferred his topped with cheddar and chipotle salsa!

I make these pancakes on special occasions (mother's day, most recently) and they're so good that I refuse to let my little brother make them -- I want the credit! Because I couldn't find blue cornmeal or pine nuts the first time I tried making these, I've always used yellow cornmeal and crushed macadamia nuts.  To continue the tropical theme I toast some shredded coconut to go on top. They're delicious, easy, and different...I have a feeling I'll be making them for my own kids someday!

I used yellow cornmeal because I didn't have blue.  I used hempseed because  that's what I had and when toasted lightly it has nutty flavor.  I used whole wheat flour because I always do.  Because the whole wheat flour is heavier I increased the baking powder.   My husband loved it and so did I.  I have already made it again and plan to purchase the blue cornmeal.    As recipe suggested I added a little more milk so that it would pour off spoon correctly.  The second time I added dried cranberries.   This recipe is a keeper!  Awesome!

Delish!! I ordered the blue cornmeal off of Amazon as I live in the middle of no where and have five boys at home. Not easy to go to the grocery store. I made them tonight however I had to quadruple the recipe in order to make enough for the guys! I always have extra too! Plus my husband takes leftovers to work! Amazing they all loved them and even my picky ones ate them. Since they are blue I added a pic I told them the "flour" was blue but it was just regular pancakes. The picky ones even had seconds which is a highly rare! Thank you for an excellent recipe. Also I wanted to add that we use corn cob syrup on them. Instead of corn cob jelly I make syrup which my husband thinks is soooo yummy! My oldest boys use regular maple syrup. Enjoy!!

Made these pancakes for dinner tonight. They were delicious. I did make a couple of changes. Like several others I didn't have blue cornmeal so I used yellow and I had some buttermilk that was fast approaching its expiration date.  I don't know if it was the buttermilk substitution but I did need to add more than the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe. The pancakes were light and fluffy with a great texture.  I think letting the cornmeal hydrate really helps with the lightness. I highly recommend this recipe.

So tasty! I used half buttermilk and half whole milk for the milk called and substituted a tablespoon and a half of raw honey for the sugar. We also added raspberries! They were delicious, moist, not too sweet, and just perfect for a lazy weekend morning!

Easy to make GF! And dairy-free!
Substituted Trader Joe's GF flour instead and used 2 TBSP oil instead of butter.  Decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp and increased the sweetness to our family's liking. The additional step to soak cornmeal in boiling water is worth it in order to get a great texture, not gritty.  These turned out perfectly.  Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar or drizzled with honey--YUM!

These were pretty good.   I'd been searching for a recipe to mimic The Mission's (San Diego) Blueberry Cornmeal pancakes and decided to try these.  They weren't what I was looking for, but they were good!  I subbed yellow for blue cornmeal and added blueberries.  THANKS for the recipe!

These are delicious! I have made them several times now and they come out perfect! I thought the cornmeal might give them a grainy texture but they are very nice and fluffy. I used yellow corn meal, there is no difference in taste. Didn't have pine nuts.

I also tried it with yellow cornmeal and added fresh lemon zest and some Greek yogurt to the mixture. I also made a lemon-zest butter to top it with. These pancakes were light and airy and so delicious!

I just made this and it was beautiful. I used yellow cornmeal and wholewheat flour, and skipped the pine nuts. The batter was thick but the result was fluffy. For those who got it flat, you have to wait for the cornmeal until it absorbs all the water and turns into polenta, porridge consistency, then add milk and so on. I served it with honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Happy day.

This was very yummy and a nice change of pace from regular pancakes.  My toddler son and I ate them up and the leftovers made great "pancake toast."  I used yellow cornmeal since that's what I had; I also used buttermilk since I had some to use up. I skipped the pine nuts since I didn't have any.  These were very light, very flavorful, and delicious with either honey or maple syrup.  I will definitely be making these again!

Every bit as good as the ones I had at a high-end hotel in Santa Fe, NM a couple weeks ago! I was looking for a recipe for blue corn pancakes that would be similar to the ones I just had on vacation so I ran across this recipe this morning and made these for breakfast and this is definitely a keeper! I had to add a little more milk but that was the only change I made.  My husband had never had blue corn pancakes before and he loved them too.

Love the crunch of the cornmeal, but my husband and I agreed that they needed more sweetening.  It seemed like there was something missing.

didn't use the pine nuts, did use yellow corn meal, and bleached AP flour, I've never heard of blue corn meal. The texture was a bit odd. The flavor was good, but the texture was just off to me.

Made with regular ol' cornmeal and a bit of yogurt for some of the milk and left out the pinenuts but otherwise followed exactly -- yum!  I've been making a lot of pancakes lately for my 10-month-old daughter (no molars = somewhat limited options) so try to mix things up and this was a fabulous recipe to add into the rotation.  Light, fluffy and flavorful.

Thank you so much for this recipe!! My husband and I have been missing these since we had them in Santa Fe in the spring. This recipe is spot on!

I didn't have pine nuts but it didn't need them! I lightened it up by using Egg Beaters, less sugar and skim milk.

We've found our new favorite breakfast food. Thanks again!

I don't know what happened, but these turned out really bad. They were very bland and not fluffy. I was very disappointed, as my brother was. I followed the directions to a T, but they weren't good at all.

Like most, I used yellow cornmeal. Also I added more sugar (well, splenda), used whole wheat flour, and did not add pine nuts. I will definately make this again, but I think next time I would add more cornmeal. Just weren't corny enough for me. But it was pretty good!

I had some leftover fresh-milled yellow cornmeal from dinner and wanted to use it up for breakfast.  These were a nice change from our regular pancakes.  I did double the sugar knowing my 4 and 2 year old would eat them without syrup, and I used whole wheat flour for some of the all-purpose flour. I also left out the pine nuts.  They were very light and fluffy (even being mostly whole grain).  My kids each ate 4, but my husband thought they were a little salty (as was the cornbread I made last night--probably the cornmeal, not the recipe).  I'll definitely make them again, but cut the salt down when using fresh cornmeal.

I too found the batter a bit runny, so I added a handful of oatmeal to the mix after a pancake or two. 
Regardless, the batter will still make excellent pancakes, even if you aren't used to the runny consistency.

These were really good.  I used rice milk and non-dairy margarine, as we have a dairy allergy in our family, and yellow cornmeal and they turned out great.  Thanks!

Excellent! Used yellow cornmeal, skim milk and Smart Balance Light spread cooked in Enova oil. Put peeled,diced granny apples in 1/2 of the cakes and 1/2 pine nuts. Ummmmmmmm! Will try next time with pecans.

First, these pancakes taste fine.  I addeed a little more sugar than called for just as a matter of taste.  They cooked very nicely.  Other than the added sugar, I followed the recipe exactly.  Instead of having to add more milk because the batter was too stiff I had to add more flour because it was soupy.  More like crepes than pancakes.  But, the tasted fine.

I found this recipe very quick and delicious!  I also used yellow cornmeal and it didn't seem to affect the outcome at all.  I added cinnamon to the batter for a little extra zip and topped it with powdered sugar!

These had great flavor, and were lighter than other cornmeal pancakes I have made. I followed the recipe exactly.  These were not very sweet but I served them with fruit compote and it was a perfect combination.

Very tasty!  We made them with honey and had to thicken the batter with a bit more flour.  We used cornmeal from Santa Fe and it had a bit different texture than Bob’s Red Mill.  Just FYI.  Also we used chopped pecans as the nut. Yummie!!

Deliciously unique! Blue cornmeal behaves differently than yellow or white cornmeal because it is super thirsty. I used gluten free all-purpose flour so I ended up adding almost an entire cup of milk. The batter was still super thick making cooking time and temperature subject to adjustments. But well worth the wait. I even tried making waffles out of them, which turned out to be a disaster. The final taste is delicious and the pine nuts give it a toasty, nutty flavor- almonds or walnuts would be a good substitute. Thank you for the recipe.

I love pancakes!  And these have quickly become my favorites. I use yellow cornmeal instead of the blue, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. Perfect texture every time. Highly recommended.

I was looking for IHOP corn pancakes they quit selling a long time ago. I tried this, figuring yellow cornmeal would work as well as blue and be much cheaper (a real consideration for us). Oh. My. God! These are incredible! IHOP cornmeal pancakes pale in comparison, these are so amazing! Well worth the three bowls for prep, worth as many bowls as it took to make these melt in your mouth corn cakes. 

Only change I made other than color of cornmeal which IMO isn't worth mentioning, is that I skipped pine nuts ~shudder~ Vile weeds! I have already made these three times between Fri and Mon lol.

No such thing as blue cornmeal where I live, so I use yellow.  I've made these several times so far.  They have everything you want in a pancake - plus cornmeal!  Added frozen corn kernels for extra corny deliciousness. :-)

This recipe is fabulous!!! Just made these pancakes this morning and couldn't be more pleased with the results. The pancakes tasted exactly like those I get in New Mexico. Instead of white flour, however, I used white whole wheat flour. Also used turbinado brown sugar rather than white sugar. Even with the flour substitution, the pancakes were moist and delicious.

I made 3 changes: 

I used yellow cornmeal.

I substituted honey for the white sugar ( per suggestion of Jessica's review).

I added (In addition to the corn meal) about 1/4 cup corn grits plus a bit more milk to compensate. The grits added a bit of texture.

This recipe is awesome! I make cornmeal pancakes all the time experimenting with different ones each time. This one is the best so far. My wife loved them too. She says it is the best recipe yet also. They are hearty with just enough fluffiness. It reminds me of the cornbread my grandmother used to make in North Carolina. I highly recommend you try these by the recipe or experiment with changes.

These are delicious, excellent drowned in butter or butter and maple or fruit or just about anything.  The pine nuts are a luxury worth the cost, but you can substitute lightly toasted sunflower seed kernals in a pinch.  I ate these in NM several years ago--immediately recognized the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE cornmeal pancakes so I tried this recipe and it is really good!  I read the remarks and after following the recipe exactly I noticed a couple of items needed in the batter but not major and altho they are a little flat they're filled with perfect flavor and the cornmeal is softly chewy-impotant to soften it like the recipe says with boiling water step. I added an xtra egg, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and 2 xtra tblspoons of flour.  I used yellow cornmeal and half n half since thats all I had on hand.  Served w bacon n 100% maple syrup.  Delish!  Batter made 12 pancakes (plus 1 "tester") using the quarter cup measuring cup to pour 1/8 of a cup each of the batter on to the griddle.  This batter could be used to make appetizer of tiny pancakes, cream cheese mixed w capers & green onion n topped w salmon.

These were delicious! I used yellow cornmeal because that's what I had on hand. To make them vegan, I used vegan Becel margarine instead of butter, egg substitute (1 TBSP flaxseed mixed with 3 TBSP of water) instead of the egg, and almond milk. They turned out fluffy and delicious! We ate with maple syrup.

I recently had blue cornmeal pancakes on a trip to CO.  I found blue cornmeal in a Navajo convenience store and brought it home.  Thanks for the recipe!  The pancakes I had contained orange so I added 1 teaspoon of orange zest and subbed some of the milk with orange juice.  I also used the juice of the reamining orange squeezed on my pancake to reduce the amount of syrup I needed.

This was so good, even with the healthier changes I made. I used 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg, half the sugar, and 1 T. butter and 1 T. coconut oil. Served with apricot preserves. Delicious.

This recipe caught my eye since I'm always looking for something out of the ordinary. I used yellow corn meal since I didn't have blue. They were a nice change from regular pancakes. When we have leftover cornbread, we re-heat it and eat it with butter and syrup the next morning for breakfast. That is what my mom used to make for us when I was growing up which I like even better. But I will keep this recipe and probably make the pancakes again. Maybe I'll find some blue cornmeal.

Yummy. I wanted something different for pancakes this morning, but didn't have blue cornmeal on hand. Turns out, this recipe works just wonderfully with yellow cornmeal. Hearty, with a nice texture. Would definitely be delicious with tart cherry or cranberry jam.

Very good, but I made some changes. Used yellow cornmeal, a mashed banana instead of butter, and all milk instead of using water. I mixed all the dry ingredients in the bowl, then added the wet ingredients - cut down on the dirty dishes. It turned out very well, and I'll definitely make again.

Wow, these were better than I thought. I used yellow cornmeal - I did not have any bluecornmeal on hand. My youngest son loves pancakes and he was asking for more.

I found the batter to be rather runny, so next time I will probably add 1/2 c flour (whole wheat would be great, I think, as some of the other reviewers suggested). I also added two very ripe mashed bananas and some cinnamon to the recipe, and was very happy with the result - especially when my teenage daughter informed me they were 'the bomb'.  Nice change of pace...happy eating!

Susbtituted yellow cornmeal without any problems. I plan to use white cornmeal next time, just for a different look!
