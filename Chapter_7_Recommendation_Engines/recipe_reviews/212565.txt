The recipe is great with modification!  I did take note of the first comment about it being a bit too dry and I added a 1/4 cup more milk.  Also, I didn't have Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup but instead I use Campbell's Condensed Cream of Celery.  The taste was delicious!  I served this with Beef Short Ribs Braised in Red Wine.

Well this was sure easy, but I found the bottom noodle mixture to be a little on the dry side.  Definitely a basis for a good recipe.  next time i may try to use half a can more of the mushroom soup or maybe instead of that half a can of the cream of cheddar soup.  The bottom line is that it needs to be more creamy.  I loved the French's onions on top.

I was looking for an easy recipe of mac and cheese and thought I would try this one. I'm glad I did. I made a small change but I thought it would be worth 5 stars even without my change. I added a can of cheddar cheese soup because I wanted some SUPER comfort food and that meant extra cheese. I also added an extra cup of macaroni because of the extra can of soup. It was delicious. I especially love the crunch on the top of the casserole.
