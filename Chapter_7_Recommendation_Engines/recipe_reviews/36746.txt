This was great! I did make some changes, though. I used almost 7 cups of zuchinni and about 1 cup of jarred red peppers. Additionally, I roasted 4 cloves of garlic with the veggies for about 10 minutes and then took them out and put them through a garlic press and added it in with the basil/balsamic mixture. I also used 1/4 tsp. of pepper in the mixture. I also used sun-dried tomatoes to add a little something extra. Also, for fun, I grilled the polenta circles (which I only used 1 18 oz. tube)on a stovetop grill. The grill marks always add to the presentation and just sprinkled s & p to taste. Great vegetarian meal! Thanks!

While this wasn't much work, there also wasn't much taste.  Will NOT make again.

The veggies for this dish were really outstanding...I've made them twice already.  The polenta was a bit plain and needed a little more pizazz to make the dish outstanding.  Thanks, though, this was a really fun and interesting dinner and I'll certainly be trying it again with some changes based on our own tastes.

We liked this, and it was definately a change from the usual. I used the basic cheese polenta recipe from this site, instead of buying premade polenta. The polenta was only okay, but that may be due to a problem with the other recipe that I had. The vegetables were fantastic! I subbed baby portabella mushrooms for the peppers; used a lot of zucchini; and took the advice of another reviewer and added a couple garlic cloves. I kept the cloves whole, and then pressed them at the end of roasting and stirred them back in. I would make this again, after playing with the polenta a little bit. It's nice to have another meatless option that my husband and I both like.

I made my own roasted garlic polenta and used asparagus, eggplant and red peppers. I added 3 cloves of garlic. Really wish I had the onion. I used goat cheese but feta would be just as good. The vegetable possibities for this are endless.

This was pretty good! I used the polenta recipe from "Easy Polenta with Tomato Sauce" (but omitted the parmesan cheese). I didn't have any zucchini and I added mushrooms to this. I also didn't have much feta cheese so I mixed the feta with some mozza...turned out quite tasty!

I gave this recipe 5 stars simply because of how versatile it is!!! I used ingredients that I had on hand (asparagus; red, white, and blue tiny potatoes; chicken sausages; romano cheese)and it was, without a doubt, the most delicious meal I have ever prepared. I can't wait to try it with a variety of other veggies and cheeses. Truly yummy!

This recipe is amazing.  It looks and tastes fabulous.  I served it with Christmas dinner this year, and everyone raved about it.  I use a little more vegetables than it calls for.  I also use herb flavored feta cheese.

I didn't have all the stated ingredients:  sustituted mushrooms for the onion and dried basil for fresh; parmesan cheese was all I had on hand, but it all pulled together and was quite good. I will make this again.

I made this for a Friday meal during Lent. It was easy to prepare and I will certainly make it again.
