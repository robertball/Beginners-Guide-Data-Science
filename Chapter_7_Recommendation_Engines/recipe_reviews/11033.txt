I thought these were awesome!! Me and my friend made them and we thought they were cookies but in the directions it says to put in a pan like bars but we baked them as cookies for 15 minutes and they turned out great!We didn't add the nuts though cause I don't eat any kinds but I'm sure they taste great in them!! I highly recommend these and I'll definetly be baking them again!!

Wow too sweet! I like my toll house chocolate chip cookies better. My kids said they wished I hadn't put the butterscotch chips in them. They also took 45 minutes to get cooked on the inside and so I covered them and turned the oven off to keep them from getting to brown.

These were good in the way that any chocolate cookie is good but they were nothing exceptional. In fact regular old Toll House chocolate chip cookies are better in my opinion. Don't know if it was the hype of the other comments or what but after expecting something phenomenal I was disappointed a bit.

Truly evil! Once people had a bite they totally understood the name! Very well-received by our group. Perfect as is but I have switched out the butterscotch chips for flaked coconut from time to time. DH loves the coconut version!

I thought these were great! Yes very rich...but that's what makes them so great with Ice cream. I also added a half cup of shredded coconut with the nuts and chips and it adds a tasty texture.

I made these for my daughter to take along to college with her to share with her roommates. Everyone loved them. I used pecans instead of walnuts and also added a cup of shredded coconut. It's a keeper!

Very very sweet from the butterscotch chips. They are also very thick much thicker than I expected from a bar cookie baked in a 9x13 pan. Baking time really isn't enough for these--a bit underdone on the inside but done on the outside. I'd probably halve it if I made it again but I'll have to see if everyone else likes them before I do. Thanks!

I LOVE these cookies. Everybody rants and raves about these whenever I bake them. They're a fun variation on the chocolate chip!

Really good but baking time is confusing. I kept baking for 5 more minutes (about 4 times) because the middle was not cooked but when it was finally cooked the edges were too done! I will make again and next time use a larger pan so that they are not so thick.

I made these into cookies instead of cookie bars and got almost 4 dozen servings. Not sure why this recipe says 12 servings. Those must be very large servings! I ended up baking them for about 19 minutes until they were browned on top. They're a little crunchier than I like but still a decent cookie. Not irresistible which I guess is a good things in my house =)

i followed the recipe exactly. very easy and i'm horrible at baking. my kids loved it. update: 10-14-15 So I did what another reviewer mentioned which was switch out the butter scotch chips for sweetened coconut flakes. It was so bomb. The butter scotch made it taste very sweet and caramel like but I am not that big a fan of overly sweet. I might even do half of the chocolate chips next time.

I enjoyed this recipe but I ended up putting it in the oven for twice as long as every time I tested it it was runny and soupy but in hindsight I think it was the butterscotch chips that were gooey and not my batter itself. So I'd suggest cutting back on the butterscotch chips and cooking it a little longer.
