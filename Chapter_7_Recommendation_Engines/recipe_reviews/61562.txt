I loved these as did our dinner guest, and both in taste as well as presentation I was proud to serve them.  (Hubs didn't like them but he doesn't count because he doesn't like Parmesan or Asiago cheese).  I used Panko bread crumbs and mixed olive oil right into the cheese/crumb mixture rather than drizzling it over the top. The topping was flavorful, light, crispy and golden brown and I was lucky to have red-ripe Roma tomatoes to begin with.  Beautiful and delicious addition to the dinner plate.

Wow!  These are so tasty! They can be a meal in and of themselves.  This is nice because it can work as an appetizer or a side.  Quick and easy, but tastes like you spent a long time.  I love the blend of flavors! This is a definite keeper especially with fresh garden tomatoes over the summer months.

I used fresh picked heirloom tomatoes, panko bread crumbs and EVOO. Our garden is overflowing, so I will be making this again.  Next time it will be on the grill.

really good flavor. definitely stick with harder tomatoes.  we used vine ripened and found that they got too mushy.  i would recommend hard romas.  also added a bit more oregano. yum!!

This recipe is an extremely nice "stand around the kitchen table" snack.  The guests helped to prepare it, and when it was eaten everyone was awestruck by the flavours created from the common, simple ingredients.  It's a perfect snack recipe for Yuppies, and other mindless people.

Peace and love,
Paul

I think I would rather eat a plain tomato with salt. I really tried to like this recipe but I think I just don't like the texture of the tomatoes. I will try these with some fresh romas from my garden very soon.

Overall, very good. Nice texture with the toasty bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. I also added a garlic and herb cheese spread to the top, before sprinkling on the parmesan/bread crumb mixture, and it added a really nice flavor.

Found these to be quick and tasty. Went well with my grilled filet mignon, wasabi garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.

Delicious and very easy....I used only Parmesan as I didn't have the Asiago cheese. It was still good.

Made this recipe the first time to go with pork chops for dinner, and was realy pleased with it. Made them the next time to go with the Marinated Grilled Shrimp recipe from this site, for a ladies group card party, and they just could not get enough. Every one raved about them. The secret is to make sure you get good solid tomatoes, not over ripe ones. The only way I could find grated Asiago cheese was in a pre-packaged mixture of Asiago, Romano and Parmesan. Worked very well.

I served these instead of a salad along with some BBQ chicken.  These are so simple, and absolutely delicious as is. The textures of the broiled tomatoes and crusty cheese topping are wonderful together.  Highly Recommended!

they were tasty but didn't blow me away either. It was a nice change for a side dish. Though, next time I'll likely try some different herbs/cheese combos to make them more flavorful.

These were good...I did make a few alterations. I don't love dried parsley that much to make it my main seasoning, so I made dried oregano my season instead. The amount the recipe calls for is too much, too overpowering. It could also be that oregano is much more potent than parsley. Next time I will use less and change to Italian seasoning. I also cut mine a little thicker than called for. I had no issue with mushiness.  I also used panko brd crumbs and mozzarella cheese, I didn't have any Asiago.   I know I changed this recipe up a bit, but I wanted it to be more of my liking.  Low broil setting and the rack close to it is key! Thanks!!

This was excellent!  I just used one smallish "on the vine" tomato and cut it into about 1/2" slices.  I thought 1/4" slices would be a little skimpy.  I used romano instead of asiago, because that's want I had.  At first I thought there should be more bread crumbs (I used panko), but instead followed the recipe as written.  And I'm glad I did.  The topping was light and crispy and wonderful!  This recipe gets 5* in my book, but I do have some issues with it.  I broiled this on the middle rack for the full 5 minutes and although the topping was perfect, even my thicker slices had turned to mush.  I'm going to try this again and either broil closer to the top of the oven for a much shorter period of time, or I'll bake them briefly - just to warm through - and then pop them under the broiler to crisp/brown the topping.  I can also see halving the tomato instead of slicing.  I want to perfect this in time for our wonderful summer tomatoes which I know will make this even better!  With a few tweaks, this ones a keeper for me!  Thank you.  **UPDATE**  8/23/10 - I have made these a number of times now and I've found I get the best results by halving the tomatoes and just sticking them under the broiler.  No mushy tomatoes that way!

These were very, very good! I used a bit of Greek seasoning, and I added a dash of freshly ground pepper blend. Also, for added quickness, just lightly sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray. For the crumbs, I used panko and just the smallest amount of crushed french fried onions. Will make again and again, trying different combinations of seasonings and cheeses. :)

They're okay as written.... lacked some flavor, though.  I used Italian bread crumbs.  I did love the contrasting textures!  Next time I will use fresh bread crumbs or panko and play with the herb combination a bit, perhaps add a little garlic or something else.... Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a great & simple recipe! Loved it!  Great way to use tomatoes in a different way. I did add crumbled up cooked bacon to the topping mix only because I had extra. I will be making this recipe again. Thanks!

So this rating provided to those who ate these when I made them. They quite enjoyed them. I don't eat tomoates but I realize every one doesn't hate them like me. I will do this again... for some one else.

One of my most favorite ways to eat tomatoes. I use panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs or if I'm really broke, Ritz cracker crumbs.

Fantastic! We sliced grape tomatoes and left out the asiago cheese (since we didn't have any), but the result was still superb. The broiler heated the tops of the tomatoes before the bottoms were heated through, so we threw the tomatoes in the oven for about 3 minutes, and then it was cooked to perfection.

We really enjoyed these. I added basil, parsley, salt and pepper to the olive oil and in the bread crumbs and on the tomatoes. I made them with an Italian cheese mix. I served them on the side of the "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" from this site and vermicelli. I heard someone say that they can't wait for the tomatoes in the garden to come in so we could have them more often. That's a "High Compliment" in my family :)

Super broke and had lots of tomatos I didn't know what to do with. Such a good idea, I did add garlic salt, onion powder, chili flakes & oregano (I prefer more spice). Didn't have any bread crumbs, what a wonderful/easy, use what you have recipe!

What a lovely recipe! Made per recipe but added a bit of basil to the topping because I love it with tomatoes. Thanks for sharing this delicious low carb treat!

Has to be good because anything can be cooked with this recipe.I have used fish,eggplant,you name it,and its good with the oil,bread crumbs and cheese.Maybe each ingred.needs slightly different variety of herbs but pretty much standard in the Med.coastal areas in Europe.Mostly I would use this as a base for a main course

I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes as a dish unto itself but wow, I absolutely loved these.  And the next day I used the left over ones in BLT's... it really added some pizzazz to the sandwiches.

Husband really liked this. The cheese mixture was very good. However, I used vine-ripened tomatoes and they turned out mushy and the smell is'nt very appetizing. It was hard to get my daughter to eat it. Probably would'nt try this again. I like my tomatoes fresh.

Couldn't find straight asiago cheese so I got a mix of asiago, parmesan and another. But i couldn't see anything wrong with the taste.

I actually made it twice already. 

I grabbed some fresh basil out of my herb patch and added it to the left over cheese mix and smooshed it all over a chicken breast and broiled that and it was yummy too!

Tomatoes are great right now, the meatier ones hold together best (think roma's ). Watch closely or they burn. 
I cooked mine on top shelf at 425 degrees just to be safe. 
Very tasty

We had a surplus of tomatoes, so this was a good way to use some up. It went very well with fish. My family absolutely loved these. I only had Parmesan, so that’s all I used for cheese, but I’m sure additional cheeses would be delicious. Simple, but good.

A tasty and simple recipe.  It can easily be modified for any tastes - the asiago cheese is a great flavour.  We will try it again and change it up with other toppings (cilantro; lemon zest; spiced oils; etc.....).  Give this one a try!!

I have made before as directed... cooking for one tonight...  I substituted different cheeses and added slivers of onion and slivers of mushrooms and garlic. Baked for 10 mins at 375 added cheese and breadcrumbs and baked for another 10 mins until the cheesy crust was browning. Cut up tomatoes and put over angel hair pasta with an added drizzle of evoo.

These were great! I used 4 large ripe tomatoes from our garden, each cut into 3 (chunky) slices. Put onto a cookie sheet (sprayed with Pam), seasoned with salt and pepper. For the topping I used: 1/4-cup Panko, 3/4-cup fresh grated Grand Padano cheese, 1-tsp dried basil, 1-tbsp (packed) freshly minced garlic. I put them in the oven at 350 for 5-minutes, then broiled for another minute or so. Easy and delicious!

This was ok. I expected it to be better. Once the  tomatoes were cooked, they were a bit mushy making the breadcrumb/cheese mix a little soggy. I cooked a little bit longer to see if it would crisp the tops up but there was just too much tomato juice. The flavors were good, so I think I will try this recipe again.

It only tastes good hot, in my opinion. Another tweak I've used in the past is to use the Italian dressing dry mix in the breadcrumb mix. That just adds that zingy flavor. I would make this again but incorporating the above tweaks.

So easy, tasty and delicious!  I used tomatoes out of my garden and instead of buying the different cheese I had a jar of Kraft shredded Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheeses.  Quick  and so easy!  Will definitely make them again.  I might try green tomatoes and a little cornmeal!

Yummy good right out of the broiler.  My mom used to make something like this with wheat germ and mayo, so I topped it with mayo.  Next time, I'll try adding mayo to the cheese and breadcrumbs.  Easy and fast.

Just made these for lunch, Outstanding! I didn't have large tomatoes right now but did have 4 nice Romas.  This also gave me a sturdier tomato. I would think that an overripe tomato may not work as well.   These romas worked great, sliced each one in 4 slices so I only needed half the bread/cheese mixture (will use the rest later on something else, can't wait). I also only had parm cheese and used Italian style bread crumbs. Even though I had the oven preheated, I did have to keep them under the broiler a little longer than 5 mins.  Maybe I didn't have them as close to the broiler as the original chef.  Can't wait to make these for a big family dinner.

I made this recipe (half) as a side dish. It was a nice change of pace, but I made some changes. I added fresh garlic, basil, and a dash of oregano. I didn't have Asiago so I subbed mozzarella for it. After 4 min in the broiler the mozz. got dark and crispy, so maybe if you're using mozz. adjust the cook time. Nothing out of this world, but a nice little side.

Easy and scrumptious.  I changed it a smidge, using Italian seasoning panko and fresh asiago (which had olive oil and rosemary in it).  I served it atop Trader Joe's breaded eggplant discs.  It tasted like I spent hours in the kitchen.  I made it simply because I had the ingredients in the house and I was not feeling well so I wasn't really in the mood to cook.  This was delicious and I can't wait to make it again for some dinner guests.

We love these!  I've made them twice in the past two weeks . . . The first time I used half tomatoes and half zucchini.  I subbed half Parmesan and half pecorino, and panko for the bread crumbs . . . Just to use what I had on hand.  They turned out delicious!  Very easy and make a nice presentation.

Excellent!  I don't care for tomatoes and I loved these. I substitued Dried Rosemary for the Parsley.  This is an awesome quick side dish.

Very quick and easy to do!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs rather than plain.  Yum!

This is the only way I will eat fresh tomatoes. We use whatever cheese we have on hand and they taste wonderful. Make them for my parents-in-law and they raved about them.

I usually start judging a recipe long before it's finished cooking.  This one looked great before I put it in the broiler.  After that, it all went downhill.  The smell was nauseating, the tomatoes came out mushy, and the flavor was just wrong.  My tomato loving mom couldn't even bring herself to finish one slice.  Sorry for the bad review, but we just did not like this at all.

I cut the topping ingredients in half & still had too much. I also used olive oil Pam to spray the tomato slices before & after broiling. Very healthy & delicious!

Simple and delicious. Make sure you use great olive oil and fresh sweet tomatoes. A wonderful side dish for fish!
