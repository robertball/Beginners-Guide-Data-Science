Totally unique recipe. Really enjoyed this zesty sauce for a change of pace. I was expecting it to be fairly spicy hot but it was not. Loved the subtle flavor of the horseradish. I made as written, but as the submitter told me that the original recipe did not call for the water, I left it out. I am glad I did as it would have been far too thin had I added it. It makes a lot, yielding about 8 cups of sauce for me. I just put the extra in the freezer for another meal. Looking forward to it! Thanks, smitty.

The slow cooker made it a breeze, no standing round stirring the pot.  Great flavor of the sauce.

I omitted the tapioca and used a lot less water. Didn't have tomato soup, so I substituted tomato paste and a small bit of water. I also used Seasoned and Smooth V8. Flavours were great! Got lots of compliments!

4 stars for originality and flavor. This is more reminiscent of a trendy sunday brunch than Sunday dinner at Nonna's- if you're expecting an old fashioned italian "gravy" for your "maccheronies"(as they say in the bronx)this aint it.  Think Bloody mary.
