Excellent, IF you tweak a bit.  The combination of sweet potatoes and apples is sublime.  Golden Delicious is the best type to use since it's texture and firmness is similar to the Sweet Potato.  Definitely BAKE your potoates first (locks in the sweetness and vitamins!), cool, then slice.  I also sliced my apples, then cut again into bite size pieces and it cooked perfectly.  No need to layer the sugar in between.  Just melt the butter (1/2 c. is enough)& spices and drizzle over the top.  Good dish to make ahead of time and put into the fridge.  Just let it sit at room temp. for a few hours before baking and you're good to go.  This is such a nice change from the marshamallow topping and so much lighter!  I always get raves and requests for this dish, which I've been making for the past 5 yrs.  Try it!

Used a combo of suggestions and it came out perfect.  Try this: Boil the potatoes in skins until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Cool, peel and slice into greased casserole dish. Using only 1/2 cup of brown sugar total, mix remaining ingredients except apples and butter.   Top potatoes with 1/3 sugar mixture. Mix apples (1/4 inch slices cut into 8 pieces each) with the remaining sugar mix, spread over potatoes. Drizzle the melted butter over the top. Bake for 20 min, stir gently and drizzle with 1 Tablespoon melted butter if mixture seems dry. cook 15-20 minutes more.  Great flavor combo!

I made this for Easter dinner and everyone wanted the recipe!  Next time I might cut down on the amount of sugar, but I will definitely make this again!

The potatoes need to be cooked very soft before baking. I left them firmer than they needed to be since I thought they would soften up a little more while baking, but they didn't. Other than that, the dish was a hit.

This is the second year making this tasty dish.  I find that I have to cook it for about an hour on 350 degrees.  I adjust the time and oven temperature as needed.  I know it's done when it begins to brown.   I use golden delicious apples.  This meal is so easy to prepare, inexpensive and tastes so good!!

Took this casserole for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews!  The only problem I had was the topping didn't say whether to melt the butter or cut it in so I cut it in.  The apples looked like they were drying out while cooking so I added a little butter to the top during the cooking.  Next time I will melt the butter and see how that works.  Definitely a keeper!  I used Granny Smith Apples and everyone thought they had a wonderful taste.

Excellent!!  We forgot to peel the apples and my young "assistant" sliced them RATHER thick, but it all still worked fine.  I would be sure to slice the apples very thin next time.  Also, I might even use "half moons" of apple instead of "rings" to make serving easier.

found this last year at my inlaws place, and everyone loved it when we made it.  

Make it fairly regularly, and the only part that is a problem is the caramelized sauce.  I find it better NOT to put in the flour, as it seems to make the sugar clump gloopily

This was a good dessert dish.  I must say it was a bit too sweet however.  Personally, I would omit the sugar between layers, add the spices to the topping and use a bit of that between layers.

This is wonderful!!!!!   Everyone in my family who like sweet potatoes (I'm a recent convert to them) loved this dish.  Even my mother-in-law (who doesn't like them) was tantalized by its cinnamon-y aroma into tasting it and she proclaimed it delicous.   

My notes to the recipe - (1) use MEDIUM size sweet potatoes to avoid excess potatoes after assembling the casserole; and (2) for families, like mine, who have those disliking pecans (or just nuts in general) -- I halved the pecan halves so they could remove them easier.

The top layer of apple rings (I used "Cameo" apples) made this dish very eye-appealing.

I totally agree with mommyfromseattle I took the sweet potatos and put them in a roaster pan and baked them for 25 to 30 minutes prior to baking the dish instead of boiling them. The skin peels right off. I also added oats to the topping mixture and made sort of a sweet potato crumble....it was delish. I cubed the potatos and apples and cooked with the top on most of the cooking time and then took it of for the last 10 minutes to crisp up some.

I was just trying to use up some extra sweet potatoes & apples but I didn't think that it would come out this good.I omitted the pecans because a guest was allergic.  Other than that, the only thing I changed was that at the end.....I melted the butter and made a roux w/the flour.  I then added the brown sugar and made a caramel sauce.  Poured it on the sweet potatoes/apples, mixed it up a bit and baked.  Then, made a little more sauce to pour over when it came out of the oven only for 'eye appeal'.  This was gone in no time.  Definitely will make again.

I only used half the suggested amount of sugar....would have been too sweet with it all....I also baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them and it turned out great...a great addition to Thanksgiving dinner!

I doubled (tripled) the crumble and got rave reviews.  Wonderful yam/stewed apple combo for people who don't like pureed muck topped with marshmallows for thanksgiving.

The apples were actually a sharp contrast to the creamier sweet potatoes but they worked really well together.

As good as a sweet potato dish could ever get.  Usually never a hit, this dish got quite a good reception, even though I left it in the oven for a little too long and the sweet potatoes got overcooked (forgot that they were already fully cooked when dish is put together).  Streusel topping a little hard to spread so maybe decreasing the melted butter would help?   Don't bake until ready to eat because reheating doesn't work on this dish.  Thanks for a sharing a good obligatory sweet potato dish -- it's a keeper!

I cut back to 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar mixed with the apples.  On top I kept it to 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 Tablespoons of flour and 1 Tablespoon of butter.  Kids loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was amazing! I used sweet potatoes and apples from my organic CSA veggie box and threw in a Bosc pear just cos I had one. I layered a bit of the pecan topping mixture in the middle so we could have pecans throughout the casserole. I layered everything in a medium round Pyrex and it was just the right size to fit this recipe. I'm going to make this another time for dessert and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt on top -- it's that good!

Worth reading the reviews and "tweaking" accordingly.  A dressy accompaniment to fairly plain pork and chicken dishes.

LOVE love LOVE this recipe! My friend made it for Thanksgiving last year and I had to make it this year for my Thanksgiving. It was a hit! Only thing I am going to try different next year is cubing the apples into bit size pieces as well. I used Granny Smith apples and it was a GREAT combination with the sweet potatos. Just a smidge of tart with the sweet.

My boyfriend and I made this for Thanksgiving. I had reduced the sugar and only used 3/4s the amount recommended. I actually found that it wasn't as sweet as I imagined it would be so next time I make this, I will use the full amount. The yams came out really soft. Like others stated, I wasn't sure about the butter, pecan and flour mixture - was it suppose to be melted butter or softened? I don't know but I melted it first and it was not pretty looking but tasted good as a subtle topping. I plan to use this recipe over yams with roasted marshmallows any day.

loved the combination of the apples and the sweet potatoes. I cooked the sweet potatoes in the oven for an hour then peeled and cut them up with the apples. Then combined the rest of the ingredients and sprinkled it on top and cooked in the oven for another half hour. It was delicious and everyone loved it, even those shy about sweet potatoes.

This is a recipe that is a "must have" at the holidays. It's easy, tastes great, and although it counts as a vegetable it tastes more like a dessert! I like being able to add more sweet potatoes or more apples depending on the tastes of the crowd. Great the next day too.

I made this a couple days ago for a barbeque, and it was excellent.  I did modify it a little!  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes, so I did not boil them first.  I just peeled and sliced them in layers with the apples and brown sugar.  I also changed the topping.  One family member can't eat nuts, so I used oatmeal instead in the topping.  Oh, and I added raisins.  The whole thing came out great.  Most people went back for seconds, and a few for thirds!  Thanks for the great recipe, I have added it because I will make it again.

This was a hit for Thanksgiving. I was afraid everyone was going to miss the normal baked yams with marshmellows but they seem to like this better. Yeah!

I used canned yams (what I had on hand) and thought it turned out well.  I would use less brown sugar than called for, however, and I wish I had cooked it longer than 30 min (my apples were still hard).  Also used walnuts in place of the pecans, which I thought was fantastic!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I used half the amount of sugar and it was still sweet.  I agree that the flour should be left out as it did create a paste on top. Just melt the butter with the other ingredients and pour on top.  Also, don't overcook the potatoes and wait until they are cool to slice; otherwise they become a little mushy.

Very good.  I have never enjoyed eating sweet potatoes because everyone makes them so sickening sweet.  As another suggested, I left the sugar out of the layers (only used nutmeg and cinnamon).  Not too sweet at all and very tasty.

I made it with Granny Smith apples and yams (we prefer the flavor and texture of yams over sweet potatoes). Next time I would use a softer apple, like a Golden Delicious, to better match the texture of the yams.  My elderly parents thought this was the best flavor on a plate full of great stuff.  I liked it a lot too.  My husband came away "without getting a sweet potato experience."  He prefers savory flavors to sweet, dessert-ish ones like this, and would undoubtedly rate it a few stars lower.  Savory lovers would probably do better to move on.  Everyone else should try it!

I cut the recipe down but I still followed it. The only problem I had is that it really wasn't cooking that much. I did cook the potatoes in the microwave before peeling and cutting. I had to turn it up to 400 and covered. It was really delicious. Next time I'll cook it on 400 for an hour. Thanks!

This was a great recipe.  The only difference that I had was that I baked my sweet potatoes skins on in the oven at 400 until they were soft, then peeled and cut them.  I used a granny smith apple (all that I had in the house) and I think a sweeter apple would have been better.  Everyone in the family loved it though.  Thanks for sharing.

YUMMMMMM!!  Followed pretty much the recipe, chunked up my apples (golden delicious) and probably used more butter than asked for, but its thanksgiving, so who cares :) will make again. Everyone loved it. Pretty sweet and I used about 1/2 the sugar.

I halved the recipe for my husband and I and used 2 small sweet potatoes and 1 Granny Smith Apple, but I kept the topping the same (that's my favorite part!). It was soooo good! This is how I will make sweet potatoes from now on (I'll have to lay off on the topping, though .. ..!)

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it did come out great.  There was barely any left.  My only recomendation is to take special notice of the two listings for brown sugar.  I didn't realize the 2nd listing was for the topping and almost messed the whole batch up.  Whew!

My sister-in-law said this is like having a bit of apple pie without the crust.  Really easy to put together the night before Thanksgiving and throw in the oven to warm the next day.  I liked the apples with the yams - a variation on the same old marshmallows.  I think this one will be a tradition now.

Made this recipe at Thanksgiving. It was absolutely wonderful.  I didn't think I liked sweet potatoes, but I guess I do! We followed it exactly.  We refridgerated it after we prepped it so we baked it a bit longer than recipe calls for.  Worked very well that to put in oven as turkey was resting and being carved.

I've made this recipe four times already and simply love it.  The combination of sweet potatoes and apple is very good.  The topping with pecans is simply scrumptious!  This is a mainstay dish for Thanksgiving get togethers!

This was delicious! Tasted like apple pie- perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas (or a monday night!). Took awhile to cook in the oven- almost an hour. I would make sure the sweet potatos are very soft when you boil them. Mine seemed soft on the outside, but when I cut into them they were still firm on the inside-should have thrown them back in. My bf loved it-a nice mix up from the usual broccoli on the side.

Most liked this but it did get mixed reviews at Christmas dinner.  I probably would just cut up the apples in chunks, put everything in the baking disk and forget layering it.  I had to cook it longer than 30 minutes as the apples were still too crunchy.

Not popular with my guests.  Of all the side dishes at Thanksgiving, this was the one I had the most left overs.  No one wanted to take it home, either.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and people loved the apples mixed with the sweet potatoes.  I made the dish the day before and put it into the refrigerator.  I baked in two smaller pans because for part of the recipe I substituted frozen apple juice concentrate in place of the brown sugar for the diabetics in the family.  I found out that with the juice I need to bake it longer.  I used the previous reviews and baked my potatoes first, then peeled them as they cooled.  I used delicious apples for the right texture.

I added juice and zest from 1/2 an orange. Didn't have pecans, so I used almonds - they were scrumptious also.

Good dish, but too sweet.  This is better as a dessert or snack than as a casserole for a meal.

I made this for Thanksgiving and also for a recent family dinner and everyone loved it (even a few who normally don't like sweet potatoes). To cut down on fat and sugar, i made this using only half the sugar, half the butter and omitted the pecans. It was still delicious! Will definitely add this to my recipe rotation.

This is DELISH!! I followed the recipe as directed except I sliced the sweet potatoes small BEFORE I boiled them, and they didn't take as long. Thanks so much, I'll be making this again and again!

Everyone had 2nds or 3rds of this dish. All the ladies asked for the recipe.  I did overcook the apples a bit with water, so will chop them next time for easier dishing out instead.  I also boiled my sweet potatoes whole for about 20 min.

MommyFromSeattle's suggestions make this one a keeper!  Not overly sugary sweet like the other "sweet potatoe casseroles", yuck.  This one rocks!  Plus, I feel a little healthier eating it :)

This was great. I had some kiwis on hand so I added them. Next time I will take the advice of some reviewers and bake the potatoes instead of boiling. I'm thinking that way they'll be naturally sweeter and then I'll need less brown sugar.

I didn't add any brown sugar... I sprinkled the layers with cinnamon sugar after spraying with olive oil.  I did end up having to cook it a bit longer... the apples cooked but the sweet potatoes took longer.  I love how the flavors all blend without all the sweet!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving! I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but I had seconds of these. My family doesn't like really sweet sweet potato dishes, so I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar over the potatoes and then 1/4 cup over the apples and they were still plenty yummy.

This was fabulous.  I don't really like sweet potatoes but it was Thanksgiving and you have to have them so I thought I'd try this.  Everyone loved it. None of us really like sweet potatoes, but my husband, my sister,my brother-in-law even my kids loved this.  THANKS!

Made mine with roasted sweet potatoes and honey crisp apples. Only used 2 Tbs brown sugar with pumpkin pie spice and ground ginger plus butter, and no flour. Brushed a little butter on top to glaze when it came out of the oven. So delicious.

AWESOME RECIPE AND A KEEPER!!! This is definitely a recipe to try and add to your favorite list!!!! Do not even think about it - just try it and follow the recipe.  The only thing I did differently is I did not layer the potatoes and apples. I mixed them together and spread them in the pan.  TO DIE FOR!!!!!!

My family loves this side dish. We aren't big sweet potato casserole fans (too much work for me and not big on toppings). But we love apples, so this was a big hit. Have made several times already.

This dish was an impromptu addition to my dinner contributions for Thanksgiving. The 5 stars was given by the hosts, and family who ate them. I am not a big sweet potato person, however, the reviews given by my friends were even balanced flavor, unique recipe that that a few have already added to their boxes. On ease to make, and change as required, This recipe is one of those forgiving dishes, which allows you to put the personal touch without compromising the integrity of the dish

This was a pretty good recipe, but a little to dry for my taste.  Everyone enjoyed the combination of apples and yams, and the spices were just right.  My one year old had four helpings.  I would make this again if I could come up with a sauce to keep the yams more moist.

I searched everywhere for a recipe before I picked this one. I made for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! My mother-in-law, who has thousands of recipes, asked for this one.

Very good.  The apple/potato combo is a nice alternative to a regular sweet potato cassarole.

Very good healthier option for Thanksgiving than most sweet potato casseroles.  4 x recipe but 6x the topping and everyone loved it for our large crowd.

Followed the recipe exactly but the casserole is dry, the apples are still not soft after more than 30 minutes baking,  and the flour topping is kind of mushy. Plus it's not very sweet despite the brown sugar.

I made this 3 times over Thanksgiving week! The only changes I made were...I peeled and BAKED the sweet potatoes (coated in melted butter, brown sugar and nutmeg) first for 25 minutes, THEN added the apples with the same coating and made a struesel topping (butter, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and pecans) on top and baked for 30. I got rave reviews from all!

The sweet potato lovers at our house enjoyed this dish so much on Thanksgiving that they fought over the leftovers. I rated it 4 stars because I did take another’s advice and baked the potatoes first rather than boiling them. Be careful not to over bake them. Let them cool.  Also I added cinnamon. Perfect!

This is a winner!  I made it for a group of women who have "heart issues".  I needed a heart healthy recipe for our December luncheon.  This received raves.  Several asked for the recipe.  I told them to go to Allrecipes to find it.  I followed the suggestion of using two Golden Delicious apples.  It was easy to follow and tasty as well.

This is my go to recipe. One adult daughter has never cared for sweet potatoes/yams, yet when paired with apples and pecan struesel, she's fallen in love with them! I layer them standing vertically in baking casserole so it's 1 slice of potato, then 1/2 apple ring, and it continues that way. It's a pretty presentation. I also mix the apple rings in 1/2 of the sugar mixture in plastic bag then top the remainder of sugar mixture with pecans and spread over all rows of pot. and apples. Delish!

This is a great recipe, but it would have helped us cooks if we knew the total weight of the  sweet potatoes to use for this recipe. They range too far in size and it makes it hard to  determine the amount of brown sugar needed to repeat this recipe successfully. I, also,  added 1/4 cup of golden raisins so I cut  the sugar back to 1/4 cup just for the potatoes and kept the sweetness of the topping as given. Yum!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  We had it for a dessert and the kids loved it!  Instead of brown sugar, I used coconut sugar.  I added a few extra spices, like clove, nutmeg, allspice and ginger.  I also just cut up the apples and yams and baked it all together for 1hr on 365.  It made the whole process much easier.  I think I won't cook it as long next time, as it made it a little mushy.  But it was still delicious!  Thanks for a healthy recipe for dessert!

This is delicious and a nice change from the usual gooey creamy style sweet potato casseroles.  I like to use Granny Smith apples because their tartness balances out the sweetness of the sugar.

i love this!   Made it for Christmas & everyone else did too.  Just did a little tweaking by excluding all the sugar & used maple syrup instead & coconut oil instead of butter.  Just a more natural/healthy alternative.

I don't like sweet potatoes but decided to be a grown-up and try this dish. Delicious! I tweaked a few things: diced the baked sweet potatoes and granny smith apples, left the skins on the apples, and doubled the topping (my family is a mega frosting or topping family. It was liked by everyone.

I made this today and it was a big hit. I didn't use all of the mixture  of cinnamon, nutmeg,  and brown sugar to coat because it seemed like a lot and other reviews suggested it was too much sugar. Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly. It was delicious. The pecans really made it for me. Will make again.
