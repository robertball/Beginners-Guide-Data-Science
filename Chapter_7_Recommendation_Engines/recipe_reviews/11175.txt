I think this is the easiest fudge recipe ever!  Even though the recipe doesn't call for it, I add 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 stick of butter to my chocolate chips when they are melting.  Seems to make the fudge creamier and softer when it has cooled.  I have also tried this by using 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips and have put in unsalted peanuts, and have received great reviews!

I used this recipe, without nuts, to make truffles...not only does it make great fudge, but the texture is perfect for scooping and rolling into balls. This also works as a wonderful base for flavorings and liquers!

It is simple, easy and good.  I don't know what any of the other people who complained about it were doing but they could not have been following the directions correctly, as some mentioned maybe they used evaporated milk, because this is really simple and one of the first "candies" I ever attempted and had no problems.  I've also used low fat and fat free condensed milk with great results.

This is the recipe I use when I don't want to go to all the trouble of making "real" fudge.  I just melt the chips and cond. milk in the microwave, mix in the nuts and vanilla, and it comes out perfectly every time.

I found this recipe when I needed to use up a can of sweetened condensed milk I'd bought mistakenly. Normally I'm a fan of fudge made with marshmallow fluff, but this was nice for something different. I agree with the person who said that it could be used as candy filling -- I may experiment with this base for truffles.

Two observations: it works best if you stir constantly, and add the chips gradually. Also, I was out of wax paper, and so I just sprayed the pan with cooking spray and left it in the fridge to chill til the fudge was ready. I was pleasantly surprised by how easily it comes out of the pan!

SUPER easy and SUPER yummy! And sooooo many variations are possible! This has been my stand-by for quite a few years now, and I rarely ever make it the same way. I live in a different country, so I don't have all of the wonderful options in flavored chocolate chips -- I only have dark chocolate and white chocolate available. That has forced me to become creative though, and with great results. Everyone ALWAYS asks me about my fudge, and comments on how great it is -- they're so surprised when I tell them how easy it is! I've done everything from your standard Chocolate Walnut, to Rum Raisin, Coffee & Hazlenut, Orange Cream, and even a Layered Peppermint fudge (with a festive mint green layer sandwiched in the middle), amongst many others. You can add various nuts, candy flavorings, liqueurs, dried fruits, zest, etc. to come up with your own, fantastic flavors. Have fun and enjoy! :o)

This fudge was very easy to make and will probably satisfy a chocoholics craving. However, it's no comparison to real fudge.

I read the reviews and thought....maybe I should try it anyway.  Well, it didn't turn out well.  Unfortunately it did turn out just like others.  I had a huge mess and it just didn't seem as if the measurements were correct.  All, the same thanks for the post and the learning experience.

My daughter called me at the beginning of her two-hour drive home to ask if I had any chocolate in the house.  I had seen this recipe and bought the ingredients, so I told her no, but I could make fudge.  Two hours later, when she pulled into the driveway, the fudge was ready. My husband says it's the best fudge I've ever made.  They both think I'm amazing.  All the credit goes to this very simple, reliable recipe.  Thanks for making me look good.

I made the mistake of trying this before reading reviews.  I ended up with a lump of chocolate, but added 2 more cups of chips and 1 7 oz jar of marshmallow creme and it turned out wonderful.  Hope that this helps someone else.

As it stands, it is a good easy fudge recipe and I've made it many times.  Tonight, however, I got creative by adding a little butter (1 tbsp-ish), 2 cups or mini marshmallows (they only semi-melted) and a 1/2 cup of peanut butter and swapped some semi sweet for dark chocolate and almonds for the walnuts and OMG I couldn't even wait for it to cool off, it was that good!

I made a batch, split it in 1/2, swirled peanut butter in 1/2, after spreading it on wax paper, then mixed in some creme de menthe coffee syrup in the other 1/2.  Both additions turned out great!  I will be using this recipe again regularily, very very very easy, so much simpler than the ones with so many more ingredients.

I think this is an awesome recipe. I make it all the time and everyone clambers for the recipe, I write it down and list this as the place I got it. I've tried lots of variations too. Mint/choc chips, peanut butter/choc chips, white chips, choc/white chips and toffe chips... it's all come out excellent. My next try will be candy cane! Mmm!

This is great fudge! Very easy and satisfies the cravings. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I really like my Dad's marshmallow fudge a little better - but this fudge is great for when you don't have time or ingredients to spend on that.

Great EASY recipe for fudge! I had never made "real" fudge before and am not a fan of the marshmallow fluff stuff - this was just what I needed for my first attempt! Yummy deep chocolate flavor too. The pan I just made won't last long...

Easy! Turned out good 1st time. Not the best fudge, but works when you're in a hurry or NEED fudge.

A super easy recipe.  For something a bit different,I replace about a cup of chocolate chips with cinnamon chips.  Always a bit hit.

This is a great recipe!  Obviously, you can't take a recipe that has four ingredients and expect it to taste like some French delicacy, but this recipe does a darn good job of being good on its own merits.  

I added butter like a previous reviewer suggested, and it added a nice richness and texture.  I was a little wary of the gooey consistency as I was stirring, but it turned out some great, soft fudge.  Definitely a great recipe for when I have an irrational compulsion to eat chocolate.

I LOVED this recipe! I don't usually make candy, I don't know if I ever have actually! But I had a can of sweetened condensed milk I needed to use - so this was it! I used 2.5 cups of choclate chips, and .5 cups of peanut butter chips, and probably only 1/4 cup chopped peanuts (I would use the full 1/2 cup next time). This fudge was SUPER easy to make, and the texture and flavor came out FABULOUSLY!! I love it! :)

This was so easy to prepare.....It shouldn't even be called a recipe! Husband loved this and thought it was like a big chocolate bar. Made a lot. We will be eating on this for days and days.

I omitted the nuts and instead added about 3/4 cup peanut butter.  This seemed to help keep the fudge fairly soft after it set.  This recipe made a lot (I cut them small). In the future I would like to try adding marshmallows, nuts, candies, etc. Easy!

This recipe always turns out great, satiny smooth fudge - my sister-in-law compared it to the old candy found in convience stores called Ice Cubes.  You must use sweetened condensed milk in this recipe, as evaporated milk does not have the right consistency for this recipe.

I like this recipe. It sounds like some people are using evaporated milk instead of  sweetened condensed milk. evaporated milk is not going to work in this recipe. overall I like it.

This is a great recipe to use if you need a quick dessert.  I used milk chocolate (18 ounces) and it turned out delicious!  This is a perfect recipe to use if you have your children helping!

Fudge lovers are generally divided into two groups: marshmallow lovers and those hate marshmallow goo.  This is a fine recipe for the latter.  There isn't anything fancy about this fudge, but I dressed it up a bit by substituting pecans for walnuts and mint extract for vanilla.

This was my first time making fudge, and it was definitely fast and easy, however the end product wasnt as good as i expected... it kind of tasted like i was biting into a block of melted then hardened chocolate chips. Maybe I used more than 3 cups.

The measurements seems to be incorrect.  I tried twice and just got chocolate goop!  Switched to 3 cups of chocolate chips, and it was fabulous!

I love this recipe, turns out the right consistency EVERY TIME! Never too dry, never too soft, it’s perfect and so easy! I chop some extra walnuts to decorate the top, but that’s the only change I’ve made. I’ve also tried using pretzel pieces in place of the walnuts, and subbed the nuts for candy cane bits as well. I think I’m going to try to layer it with peanut butter fudge this year for Christmas! Yummy and thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Wow! This was so easy and turned out really great. I will 100% make this again. I did take more than 2 hours to set. Next time I will plan on letting in set overnight. The consistency was great. It was smooth and not grainy at all. I did use milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet and it wasn't overly sweet.

My father-in-law made this same recipe for over 50 years. He called it "Rum Fudge" and added a jigger of Dark Rum in place of the vanilla extract. It smells and tastes wonderful. I don't even like any liquor but I do like his Rum Fudge. He is gone now but, we are still making it this way.

The can of condensed milk I found was only 300ml, so I reduced the chocolate chips to 2 cups. I also added in pecans, somewhere between 1/2 cup and a cup. I didn't measure.   I thought it'd be really sweet, but it's not. At first I thought it actually wasn't sweet enough, but I like it more and more.

This is an awesome, easy recipe for fudge - the only one I'll use. Just be sure to put in 3 cups of chocolate chips instead of one! Use different extracts to spice up the recipe.

This was a waste of ingredients - it was impossible to melt the chocolate and I ended up a horrible mess.  I tried to melt in the microwave to stop the mixture burning but this just made the cocoa butter separate from the chocolate.  There must be another ingredient missing - probably butter or cream.

This one was not what I expected.  The chips were difficult to melt with the milk.  I had the heat very low and it still tried to scorch.  It was hard to beat smooth.  This is NOT one I will use again.  Very dissapointing.  :(

If there is a fudge staple, this is it. I had searched everywhere for a fudge recipe without marshmallow creme.
