My taste testers loved this one.  I rated it a four because reading the recipe, it sure seemd like there was way too much cheese to hold up to the deleicate puff pastry crust, so I made a few modifications which I hate when people do and then rate a recipe, but I really thought it necessary.  I used only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the cheese amounts called for.  I had beautiful artichoke hearst so I did not mix them into the cheese mixture, I arranged them on top.  I also cut the pastry sheets in half lengthwise to make longer tarts.  I was worried that a more square shape would have caused the puff pastry to get mushy in the middle.  Doing the rectangular shapes worked better, I think.  I also used freshly roasted sweet red peppers instead of the jarred ones.  This was really a nice appetizer that my testers enjoyed very much.  I will be making this again.  It might be good with just a little sprinkling of crab meat too.

Made this new year's eve and it was excellent.  I did have to bake it significantly longer than the recipe called for... about 10+ minutes extra to make sure it was golden brown with crispy crust.  This will be one of my stand by appetizer recipes from now on.

Ok, this tasted great, but my puff pastry was not baked on the bottom.  I used Trader Joe's brand.Put back into the oven, covered with aluminum.  Looks like it is baking a bit, but, not sure if I an serve it to my guests.
