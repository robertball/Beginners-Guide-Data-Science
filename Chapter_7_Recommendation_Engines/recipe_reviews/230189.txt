I have been using a recipe similar to this for years!  I originally received it from the ladies at the church where I grew up.  It is a sweet mustard sauce.  I believe it is to offset the saltiness of the ham.  The recipe I have calls for 4 egg yolks instead of whole eggs and they are not incorporated until the other ingredients have been blended together and heated up in a double boiler. I wouldn't change the sugar content at all! I am giving it 4 stars due to the egg content. Love this!

I had some leftover tomato soup that needed used so I decided to give this recipe a try. I scaled way back since it is only the two of us. I honestly didn't think this would turn out that great but I was pleasantly surprised. I do recommend cutting back on the sugar though because the tomato soup is pretty sweet itself. I would definitely make this again.

My Mom made this recipe 50+ years ago and I still make it in her memory. Itâ€™s not only great on ham but pairs perfectly with corned beef as well !
