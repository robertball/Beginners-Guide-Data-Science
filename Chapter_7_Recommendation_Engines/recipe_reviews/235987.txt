I would suggest that when starting to cook this you use two separate frying pans.  Caramelize the cabbage,onions, and pepper in a larger pot using olive oil and slowly saute until transparent. This will bring out the natural sweetness of the cabbage. In another frying pan cook the bacon to desired doneness. Drain off the fat before adding bacon to the sauted vegetables.  Add just enough bacon drippings to flavor the dish. Sprinkle with a little Beau Monde Seasoning and serve. Full of flavor without the fat.

Oh my goodness, this is delicious!  I had a small portion of cabbage to use up, so I just adjusted the amounts of all the ingredients.  The directions didn't say whether to cover or not, so I put the lid on the pan to help steam the cabbage.  This was a nice side to go with 'Grilled Pepper Steak Salad' from AR.  Contented Home-maker, this was an excellent recipe, that I will be using again.

This is very good.  Amazing how much better cabbage tastes if it's sautéed rather than boiled. One can add in shredded onions and sweet peppers as desired, a little bit of chopped fresh hot pepper or garlic, whatever seems to fit and the family or guests like.  I would do a bit of bacon in the microwave until crisp and then crumble it over the dish last thing.  It gives a nice finish and leaves out the a lories and fat in a whole pound of bacon.

Really good and husband thought so too. Came home late with little time before dinner, and less energy.  I only used a half pound of bacon and half of a large onion. Husband said you'll have to keep that recipe. He rarely says that!

I made it according to the recipe, I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I cooked the bacon first and removed. Next I cooked the onion and bell pepper in the bacon drippings for about five minutes. I added the cabbage with bacon pieces and cooked all together. Right at the end I added a splash of lemon juice to add acid. It turned out delicious. It was greasy so next time I would remove the bacon drippings and cook in olive oil. Maybe add back some bacon grease for flavor.

Wonderful! This is going to be one of my new favorite sides. I actually used purple cabbage because I was trying to use it up and a red bell pepper

Easy side dish. It was a bit served with country ham and dirty potatoes.
Definitely will make again 
Try it with Benton bacon for a great taste.

A last minute choice and I didn’t have any peppers so I made it per the recipe without. We also cut the amounts down to about a third. Yes, it was a little greasy but the taste was outstanding. We put this on in the “do it again” box.

I liked this a lot. I put half an orange pepper and part of a large carrot cut up small and only used half a pound of bacon and about 1/3 of a large cabbage, as there’s only me here to eat it, but it still turned out good. I also added a teaspoon or so of garlic powder. Will make this again!

Excellent, a great way to cook and eat cabbage. Follow Lilla Seh Taylor's recommendation to cook the bacon separately, I found it a bit too greasy with all the bacon fat (that's why only four stars) just need a few drippings.

This was a good way to use up left over cabbage. I think next time I will drain some of the bacon grease before adding the vegetables. I also sprinkled a little vinegar on my portion.

I replaced the bell pepper with a diced apple, and I also added diced garlic. Sauted everything for about 10 minutes in some olive oil. Delish! I will make this again. It is super easy AND fast.

Yum! I made half a batch as it was just for 2 of us and added a couple squirts of Sriracha sauce as we were looking for some spice. I would also consider adding some fresh sliced hot peppers to the mix, very good!
