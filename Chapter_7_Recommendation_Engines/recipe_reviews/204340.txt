Made this last night and it was really good, however I didn't have all of the ingredients. Subbed the Dijon Mustard for regular mustard and worked perfectly. Also, I would say I boiled my potatoes about 20 minutes on high and had to season them as well...also used more dressing, but this recipe turned out great..

I made this salad for a family brunch and it an easy "do ahead" side dish.  The dressing was perfect.  I wasn't sure if the green onions and peppers were supposed to be sauteed or added to the salad raw.  I went with raw and they added great flavor and crunch. I served the salad at warm/room temperature.  There was just a small amount leftover so I'll be trying it out as a cold salad today.

The thought of uncooked green pepper with cooked potatoes and cooked sausage seemed weird so I cooked the green pepper and half a chopped yellow onion with my sausage. Cooking them just softened them a little bit. This was really good, loved the mustard dressing with the sausage and potatoes! So quick and easy to make on a weeknight as well.

i always cook in the evening and eat one half for dinner and take the other half with me for lunch the next day. i was a bit worried that the tomatos might soften up the whole meal and make it squishy, so i left them out. i cooked the sausages, then added the green pepper and after the onions. i fried the veggies just for a little while to soften them a bit, but they still had bite. the dressing was too sour for me. next time i'll use less vinegar. if you end up with a too sour dressing: i saved mine by adding a little bit of honey and mayonnaise and it tasted great in the end. will make again!

I served this tonight and the hubby gave it a rave review.  It's very different from most potato/sausage meals ~ the tomatoes are a great addition.  I didn't use smoked sausage (bought the wrong kind) and used red pepper instead of green but it was fabulous!

This recipe turned out great for me even though I had to make a couple substitutions.  I had no sausage on hand, so I used a pound of peppered bacon on hand (got it nice and crispy).  Also, I ended up using 1 cup of quartered grape tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes.  It turned out fantastic!

I made a couple of small changes: I sauteed the veggies with the sausage and I added some sliced red cabbage. I used Dijon mustard and apple cider vinegar, since that's what I had on hand. It's delicious served warm!

Tangy, crunchy, satisfying, delicious & easy to make! I would highly recommend this recipe for a simple week night dinner or potluck dish. The dressing is slightly creamy because of the oil & mustard combo. Plus White wine vinegar and Dijon mustard add just the right amount of tangy flavor! I used garlic chicken sausage from Trader Joeâ€™s instead of what they recommend. Along with white onion instead of green onion, regular Dijon & olive oil instead of regular oil. Served at any temperature would be fine. Definitely adding this one to my favorites list!

This was a tasty dish. I cooked the green peppers and onions with my sausage as it seemed hard to imagine with them uncooked. 
The only cold item added were tomatoes and I would likely leave those out next time around.

This was delicious!  Reminded me of German potato salad.  I did not have green onions, so I used red onion.  I cooked the onion and green pepper with the sausage.  Will definitely make again!

i made this for my clients at work and they loved it. i did drain my sausage really well and i added fresh green beans i had cooked n the microwave to tender crisp to make this a complete meal with cornbread. i used balsamic no ww vinegar on hand and red onions since thats what we had. this wasnt as good cold but microwaved to just warmed it was as perfect as the first time i made it. 5 stars.
