Treacle is another name in Britain for Golden Syrup the nearest product here would be dark caro syrup. There is a Black Treacle in Britain  that is similar to your mollases but that is different to golden syrup treacle and is not used on Treacle Tart. The name of the recipe is correct and it tastes great!!!

I love this! Just like the ones I grew up with in England. My Mum always made individual tarts(just reduce the cooking time)and I prefer it that way for the filling/pastry ratio. You have to appreciate a fairly sweet dessert to enjoy this and I do. My kids loved it especially with the Harry Potter tie in!

I am rating this a 4 for the idea because treacle (similar to our molasses) tarts are popular in Britain but Golden Syrup is a totally different product..........so perhaps the title is wrong.

Reading the other comments, I ordered a tin of Lyle's Golden Syrup from England to make this recipe.  I later found that you can order it from Walmart on-line.  So I ordered a case...  Today I was in the Food City Grocery store in Greeneville Tennessee and found the Lyle's Golden Syrup in the pancake syrup area...  So 
Golden Syrup is definitely available in the US.  I tried this recipe and the one from Lyle's in England and found that this one is more to the American taste.

I used milk instead of heavy cream, and found I needed to double everything for the filling in my 9 inch pan. Used the no roll pie crust recipe from this site, which was perfect - it's not sweet, so set off the treacle really well. We're going through a Potter phase, so I'm sure I'll be making it again!!
Made mini-tarts the second time, with the crust recipe from Brandy's Blackberry Cobbler on this site... Perrrfect!

As an American, I had to make some modifications, but it was still delicious. And so easy to make!

Instead of treacle, I used maple syrup and I used a graham cracker crust. I only put it in the oven for 20 minutes and it was good to go. I whipped up the rest of the cream and added some blueberries to top it off...yummmm

Just like we used to have in New Zealand when I was growing up. It brought back memories.  I used Best Ever Pastry from AR

I made this.......it was very dense. I couldn't find the golden syrup so just used light corn syrup and molasses. pretty good, maybe needs an egg in the batter to lighten it up?

I loved the taste. I added a bit more lemon and used a mix of the syrups I had in the cupboard, molasses and maple syrup. It was excellent with whipped cream! Next time I will likely add more of everything to the filling to get more volume, for a 9inch tin it ended up a bit thin.

Very simple to make, but tasty nonetheless. Had a small accident and accidentally dumped all the lemon squeeze's in while trying to measure out the two tblspns... but darn good anyway.

This recipe was a real treat. We found a golden colored buttermilk syrup at our local grocer.  It worked beautifully. I was worried it needed a sauce so i whipped up the cream.  However, the tart was so good on it's own that i scraped mine off.  Yummy! Perfect addition to our Harry Potter night.

I made it once as a test run and just made it again for my daughter who is home from university on Spring break.  We love this recipe!  As huge Harry Potter fans, we now understand why Harry loves it.  Will definitely be making this again and again and again.

I tweaked the recipe because I just couldn't find Lyles Golden Syrup...I used Dark Karo Syrup with a healthy dose of vanilla extract since golden syrup has that in it. Then instead of lemon I did 2 cutie oranges because I had those in my fridge. And a dash of cinnamon to add some spice. Finished off with a dab of real whipped cream because this dessert deserves the good stuff and viola!
