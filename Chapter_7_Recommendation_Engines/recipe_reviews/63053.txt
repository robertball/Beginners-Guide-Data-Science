This pizza is incredible! Totally easy to make and it really taste great. I made it as an appetizer for my book club group and every raved about how delicious it was.

I love anything with Brie. Here's what I had on hand and substitued with, fresh basil for the oregeano (about 4 leaves rolled and then cut), 10 Kalamata Olives, 2 tblsp. red onion for the green, and only used 2 plum tomatoes. Would make for a nice appetizer also! Will definitely be making this again, and again!

Lots of potential.  Our only complaint was that the main thing we could taste was the dijon ... and we only used about half of what was called for.  Perhaps we've got a super spicy brand at our house.  We're going to try it again with a different mustard.  Used one reviewers suggestion and exchanged basil for oregano.

Very good, and my guests loved it.  Be sure to use all the tomatoes, even though you might think the pizza will overflow.
