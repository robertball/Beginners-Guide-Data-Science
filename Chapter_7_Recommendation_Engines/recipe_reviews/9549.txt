Took quite a bit of tweeking, but good results.  I doubled recipe and also added thawed chopped spinach.  Added about a cup of sour cream and 8 oz. cream cheese instead of all the mayo.  Also garlic powder to taste, and cajun spice too.  Very rich - served in bread bowl with toasted sourdough slices and crackers.

This was very easy and YUMMY! But it doesn't make enough - I doubled the recipe and it was just enough for an appetizer for 4 artichoke loving adults.  If you're making it for a party you'll probably want to make at least 4 times what the recipe calls for.  YUMMY!

Taste as good, if not better than any restaurant.  I used the whole can of artichokes and added extra on the cheeses.  Only "extra" ingredient I added was about 5 cloves of minced garlic.  The garlic added the perfect touch (imo).  
Mmmm Mmmmm Yummy..........(update).........I made this again for a card party and forgot to put the garlic in that time, it was still good, but I decided I really like the garlic addition.

Tasted wonderful (a TINGE too much mayo, maybe) but a thin layer of grease rose to the top upon re-heating...if anyone could post how to avoid this, I'd be happy to make it again.

This is great! I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 cream cheese, and garlic. Of note: recipe calls for canned artichoke hearts, NOT marinated ones. This is probably the problem some have had with the "grease" issue. Canned artichoke hearts are in lightly salted water only, no oil. I think next time I will add chopped spinach as an extender. I served it with a rustic roasted garlic loaf. There was nothing left! That speaks for itself.

I made this for Christmas and got RAVE reviews on it from many of my relatives!  Everyone agreed it is best eaten warm. Also, I made it the night before and then re-heated before everyone came over.  My husband tasted it both times and said it was better the next day.

I really love the taste of this but I thought it was too oily.  I had to keep scooping the oil out of it, making it difficult to put out and serve to guests.

I've used this recipe for years and it always pleases.  I generally double the cheese using 2 whole blocks of cheese and one jar of artichokes (any size).  You can totally microwave it too (it never lasts long enough to get rubbery).  Perfect with bread or a spoon.  The onion is optional and we rarely use it.  As for oily problems, it's rarely an issue.  I probably use slightly less than half a cup (more often it's just 2 large spoonfuls).  No tangy taste as we always use real Hellman's (no low-fat or miracle whip in my house).

Very good. I also doubled the recipe, and was glad I did because even doubled it wasn't a 'large' appetizer for a party... Everyone loved it, and THIS review is a TRUE FIVE, bacause I didn't add or take away any ingredients like some of the other 5's did... Delicious... Try this one...

***EDIT***CHANGE OF STAR RATING*** Made this again, and was disappointed. I now realize why some people said watery and or greasy... The first time, I used a can of whole artichokes. I drained them on a paper towel, and then chopped them myself. This time, I used the already chopped artichokes. I think because even with the can drained, the layers to the artichokes hold alot of moisture. So, this time it was watery, making the grease show up more, in an oil and water don't mis sort of way. If the recipe sounds good to you, try draining very well, and towards the end of baking, sprinkle top with fresh grated parmesan...

This is a great appetizer for 4-5 people.  There was 4 of us and it was gobbled up quickly. My husband suggested "Triscuits" and we all thought that they tasted better than the french bread.  Next time I'll probably use a little less dill (although my guests liked it).   Great recipe that I'll definitely make again

for this recipe I used organic mayo and all the oil made the mixture separate, so the dip looked really funky. However, I let it cool down and used it as a spread instead of a dip... and it was great!!

I made no revisions to the recipe, and it came out a little bland. I would suggest tweeking it a bit.

EASY AND YUMMY! However; i did add some (8oz) sour cream and (4oz) cream cheese.  Throw in a ton of spice!  They're good for you, and I used the Omega 3 mayo - Smart Balance.  Great dish and reasonably healthy too!

I'll cut back on the dill next time, but otherwise this is fabulous. Delicious! As others have commented, I would recommend to at least double the recipe.

I also have to at least double this recipe every time I make it.  It's delicious - especially with Triscuits (sp?).
I never have trouble knowing what to bring to a party now, because my friends and family all request this dip.

This has good flavor, especially if you like dill, but it is way, way too oily.  After it sits for a few minutes the oil from the cheese seeps out and it becomes very unappealing.

PERFECT!  I follwed it exactly the first time!  (I did triple it for a large family). The second time I added extra artichokes & different cheeses just to shake it up a bit!  WONDERFUL!  I serve it with tortilla chips everytime.  This is a keeper & SUPER easy to make!  I think this will be my "pot luck dish" for a while!

This dip has an elegant & delicious flavor.  I only got to bake it for 20 minutes being crunched for time, but it was still good.  I think I will double it next time and cut the mayo a bit.

This was the best Artichoke Dip I ever tasted.  There was just the right amount of cheesy flavor without being overpowering.  I served it as an appetizer with onion flavored bruschetta rounds and my two year old grandson and one year old granddaughter ate almost as much as the adults.

Im afraid I cant give this too many stars as my DH REALLY disliked it. I thought it had potential, but the mayo just left it with a real twangy taste. Sorry! But on the other hand was very easy to make.

This wasn't quite what I expected.  Rather than being a creamy dip it was more like artichoke hearts held together with cheese.  I even added extra mayo.  The flavor was really good.  I was in a hurry and accidentally used mozzarella instead of monterey jack, which made it a little stretchier than intended.  I really want to emphasize the need to drain and paper towel dry the artichokes.  I did all that and it was still a bit greasy.

I like dill but this has too much in it. I also found it a bit too salty (which ruins a dish for me).  I won't make this again.  I made the dip and then baked it on top of chicken breasts.  I still like my chicken breasts cooked this way but I I will use my regular spinach/artichoke dip next tip :)

Incredibly delicious, warm and gooey.  What a simple dip.  I couldn't find artichokes at the time so I substituted canned asparagus spears instead.  We loved it.  Can't wait to try it with the artichoke.

This has an excellent flavor but did not care for all the grease.  I took paper towels and soaked it up.  Tasted even better the next day.  Served with toasted french bread.  Might or might not make again.

Easy, Very Tasty, and portable.  I added a little spice that I prefer, yet that does not take anything away from this recipe.  This is a great basic dip that has so much diversity with a few items of personal preference.  Thank you for sharing.

I seriously liked this, I thought the dill was going to over power the dish, but it didn't...my family loves dill...So I was watching their reactions. However, in this, I found that it was a tad oily from the mayo and the mayo does come forth just in front of the dill. I'm thinking of adding a splash (tbsp) of milk to help binded the cheese better and reduce the mayo just a little. Possible down to 3/4 cup. But over all, I really enjoyed the recipe and topped it on toasted french baggette rounds. TY

YUM!!! I tweaked this recipe a little bit. I added mashed roasted garlic and thyme to add some color. It is definately better warm than cold. I served mine with home-made (or you can use store-bought) bagel chips.

This is addictive. I've made it twice now, both times omitting the dill, which I don't much care for, and it has never failed to produce requests for the recipe. It is wonderful on french bread or even with fresh veggies for dipping (more like scooping!) I also added minced garlic just to add a touch of something.

This was delicious! I would add less mayonnaise next time - it was a bit watery, even after baking it 5 minutes longer.

Had this twice now - the recipe is good as stated but I think it's better with the hearts cut up a bit.  I might add a couple of drops of Tabasco or similar hot sauce next time to add a bit of a nip without taking away from the overall taste.  An alternative way to serve this is as a grilled sandwich - we really enjoyed it more that way.
