This is a great recipe and very forgiving. You don't have to have all the exact ingredients to make it work but the more you have the better it will turn out. We've been to the Christmas markets in Germany and this tasted just like what we had there. We loved it even on a hot Christmas eve in Hawaii. Thanks so much marthajones for the recipe.

I haven't been to Germany and haven't tasted this in the Christmas markets, so this is an opinion from a more "typical" American. Like the 1st poster said, this is a good "base" recipe to adapt to what you have on hand, taste preferences and your creativity.   If you like German bitters, this will appeal to you. Overall, it has a bitter tone that some may like and others not so much. The Kirschwasser to me is a strong alcohol as well as on the bitter side.  If I made this again (and I will make it again) I would try cherry schnapps or a more 'recreational' alcohol to cut the bitter.    For this recipe, I ended up adding about 1 cup honey and 1/2 cup frozen orange juice concentrate to cut the bitterness. I also added 1tsp cinnamon and a couple shakes of nutmeg because I wanted more of the spice flavor. I used a house red wine with a "cherry" note to it. (Black Box Shiraz)  It is a definitely alcoholic, wonderful German version for Sangria. I like the taste and the taste gets better and better as I get to the bottom of the mug.  :)  Thanks to the author for such a unique and wonderful holiday beverage.

I got this recipe from a weihnachtsmarkt in Germany.  The owners of the stand did not mind giving me the recipe.  This is authentic as you can get.

It was easy to make and the taste of the Gluhwein brought back great memories from my trip to Germany. I loved the recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe, however due to lack of ingredients I had to make the following changes.  I didn't have the Kirschwasser, so I used one bottle of sweet cherry wine and one bottle of shiraz. (It is hard to find what type of red wine should be used, most recipes don't say, so I guessed)  I also used ground nutmeg since I couldn't find a whole one, same with the anise, and I did add a few cloves.  Followed the rest of the recipe and let it warm in the crock pot an hour or so and kept it warm all night while my friends and I enjoyed it. Next time I may add about 1/4 to 1/3 cup orange juice to counter balance the tartness from the cherries.  Still very tasty though.  I think my favorite part was eating the tart cherries.

This is the third year I've made gluhwein and the third recipe I've tried. This one is a keeper. Went over really well at my Christmas potluck.
