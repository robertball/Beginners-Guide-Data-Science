I have tried this recipe several times, I thought it needed kicking up a notch.  So I basically made a new recipe by adding 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, 1 box sliced fresh portobello baby mushrooms, 1 teaspoon oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon ginger root, 1 pound of fresh green beans, 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/2 bag of bean sprouts. I used two cans of chicken broth and enough cornstarch to make it a little thicker.  This turned out very flavorful!

Ohm, am I missing something here?  I have not made this dish because I am looking for a CHOW MEIN dish, isn't chow mein a NOODLE?  I see no noodles in this recipe, I don't get it, this is just a chicken dish, where's the chow mein part?

This was pretty good, although not a true oriental taste. Here are the changes I made (a combination of those previously listed):  I added about 1 cup sugar snap peas, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 c soy sauce, 2 1/2 T cornstarch.  Next time I won't do the green beans, because for me they didn't make much sense, perhaps bean sprouts would have been better.

very excellent chow mein...i would just like to clear something up for everyone...i was born in philadelphia..but moved to LA for college...Lo Mein is the dish on the east coast which west coasters consider Chow Mein...chow mein is actually an eggy, runny dish served over white rice...Lo Mein (means soft noodles) is the noodles and brown sauce...please dont botch this recipe! it is perfect for what chow mein REALLY is.

Wonderful dish! I made a few changes beforehand such as seasoning the chicken in lemon pepper and basil, added a little more soy sauce, added some chopped up cabbage and bean sprouts instead of green beans. I also took out the baby corn because my husband doesn't like them much. A really wonderful meal as chow mein is his favorite. I served it over rice and added some crispy chow mein noodles on the top. Making it made me have more interest in studying asian dishes as we can never find a good asian restaurant anymore. They've all practically turned into fast food or buffets now!

Good dish but, is everyone out there that likes Chowmein to young to remember in the 70's chowmein was only made with beansprouts, green onions carrots, celery with bits of meat and all of this was put over hard noodles.  It was piles high on your plate and great to eat.  Only older chinese resturants seem to know about this.

I have lived on both the east and west coast. On the east coast we eat chowmein on top of rice and crispy noodles. On the west coast the sauce, veggies and meat are mixed with noodles, which made me really sad because I like it over rice.

This is a good base recipe. I found the sauce a little bland, I think it needs about twice the soy sauce and perhaps a bit of chicken bullion powder for a more intense chicken-y flavor. I also just used a canned asian vegetable blend instead of fresh veggies as I was in a hurry. Tasted fine like that but I am looking forward to making it again with a few alterations and fresh veggies. Overall it made a great meal!

I have made this several times and my whole family enjoys it. I love bean sprouts so I use 1/2 lb of bean sprouts in place of the green beans. For previous posters, I did a little research and chow mein is traditionally served *over* crunchy/fried noodles, lo mein is made with soft noodles. Don't avoid this recipe because it's not quite what you're looking for - find a way to work it in somewhere. You won't regret it!

Really good, will definately make it again. What's great about recipes like this is that you can really throw whatever you have on hand in them. It was quick and healthy, all in the prep work, which makes a great weeknight meal. My own changes: I cooked the chicken in 2 minced garlic cloves and olive oil, used 1 can sliced water chestnuts, 2 cloves pressed garlic instead of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. ginger, 1/2 cup sugar snap peas & 1/2 cup bean sprouts instead of green beans, 2 1/2 tbs of cornstarch and 2 1/2 tbs soy sauce.

This was an easy chow mein recipe.
I did add some yakisoba noodles because when I think of Chow Mein, I think of noodles. DO NOT USE yakisoba noodles! The chicken broth makes it taste like super dried ramen noodles.

jiust wanted to say 30 years ago, this was a special recipe, heck I remember my mom opening that can of chicken chow mein and serving it with the noodles that came on top of the chow mein can, with minute rice.  This lady was sharing a reciepe that made her happy.  Breathe ok, serenity now.

Where are the noodles? For you east coasters who believe Chow Mein is a dish to be served on rice, you've got it wrong. Mein means noodles! Don't take my noodles from me!

If you are using fresh veggies, (and realize you can be creative veering to bits of colorful options not listed) this is really good. It IS mild, so if you are thinking spicy, you might want to throw in some red pepper. We like it over rice with crunchy chow mein noodles on top.

Thank you for having the REAL chow mein recipe...with some changes noted in comments.  The West coast can take their noodles and really brown them.  Over sticky rice is best.

This was a pretty good, basic recipe - I am sure it could be customized to your own taste.  As it is, I found it a great way to clean out leftover veggies - throw in some mushrooms, beans, frozen mixed veggies, it all works.  I think next time I make it, though, I will try to use Asian veggies like straw mushrooms, water chestnuts, etc.  Having authentic chow mein noodles made a big difference with this recipe, I think, and also I used a little sesame oil instead of the butter to add some nice flavor to the recipe.  Overall, a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great chow mein recipe!  I usually trade out the baby corn and green beans for water chesnuts and bamboo, but that's just my personal taste.  It really has a wonderful subtle flavor.  Yum!

This isn't really a review. But, growing up I learned Chow Mein was on a bed of Chow Mein Noodles. Chop Suey was served over steamed rice and that was the only difference between the two. Just an FYI.

Sorry, but this just was not very flavorful.  I expected mild and I love chow mein, but this just didn't do it for me. I followed the recipe exactly, only adding a few more vegies than called for.

It was a hit!  I am not a huge fan of Chinese foods and this was just enough for me. I used 1/4 cup soy and cauliflower instead of green beans.  I only used one onion and next time I would use more mushrooms.  I slightly fried the noodles in some olive oil after draining and rinsing because it was the only oil I had on hand.  It is yummy, thank you!

I have always wanted to make homemade chow mein.  this was a very good recipe.  My printer was not working so when I wrote it down for the garlic powder I just put 1/4.  Well I put 1/4 cup of garlic powder but it was very good.  We love garlic. I would like it just a little thicker though.  But would make this again. Thanks

I bought Chinese Noodles from the grocery store to serve this dish over.  For the green beans, I used the fresh, sweet & tender, small, French green beans, that I cut in half.  And I only used one onion.  Everyone loved the dish, and my daughter thought I had purchased the dish from a restaurant, or bought it from a store.  :)

I tried this out for dinner tonight, everyone enjoyed it. I added about double the soy sauce and used bean sprouts in place of green beans. I think next time I make it I'll use less chicken broth, maybe only 2 cups instead of the 2 and a half it calls for.   I served it on stir-fried chow mein noodles, tossed with a touch of sesame oil...I really enjoyed it!

Not bad, a little bland, needed to add more ginger and garlic.  Will definitely make this again but add more stuff.

This really lacked something. Was more like a Pot Pie filling than a Chow Mein. Made the noodles like a prior reviewer suggested- fried in oil, soy sauce and ginger; those were really good.

This was absolutely delicious!  I did change it a bit just to take out the celery and green beans and to add bean sprouts and water chestnuts.  The sauce was a little on the thin/watery side but next time I think I will add less chicken broth.  I served it over white rice so instead of chicken chow mein, I made chicken chop suey!  Great recipe!

Very good!  We served the dish over rice, and it was wonderful vegetable filled comfort food on a cold day. I used fresh green beans from the garden but I imagine frozen green beans would be good too. I also buy rotisserie chickens from the store deli, and use them for all my recipes that call for cooked chicken. It is a big time saver for me when cooking.

Not the most Asian tasting dish, but it was nice. I used bok choy instead of celery, baby corn spears instead of corn kernels, and olive oil instead of butter. I think that I will use a little more soy sauce next time and use sesame oil instead of butter.

I used only vegetable oil, substituted soy beans for the green beans and added bean sprouts toward the end.  I didn't want it too soupy, so I decreased the broth.  I did add water chestnuts and red pepper flakes (thanks to the suggestions).  I finished it with a couple splashes of sesame oil at the end.

I am a poor college student and found a way to make this work from similar ingredients in my pantry. I didn't have mushrooms, but i think it really needed it, or celery (not a fan anyways). I added water chestnuts and 2 tsp fish sauce, and instead of using chicken broth i used a ramen noodle chicken seasoning packet mixed with water. I made it over the actual ramen noodles and it was delicious! adding to my recipe book!

I was fifteen before I realized that Chinese restaurants served more than just chow mein because that's all my mom ever ordered when we got take out. This is one of my least favorite Chinese dishes, but my hubster loves it and enjoyed this version very much. Even in restaurants, chow mein isn't all that flavorful, but I did add more seasonings and more soy sauce to give it a little zip. I also threw in water chestnuts, sugar snap peas instead of the beans and a ton of sliced onions. A light and healthy dinner, Ruth, and I thank you!

Eliminated the corn and green beans.  Used fresh asparagus.  Also used turkey instead of chicken as I had turkey left over following Easter.  It turned out great.

A basic Chow Mein reminiscent of a La Choi canned version. I added julienned carrots, used fresh garlic, and used canned bean sprouts not beans. Served with rice, here.

It was plenty liquid-saucy for our tastes.

I did like the recipe.  I don't really get too fussy with exact measurements, so I might have added more soy sauce than what was called for.  All in all, I would make it again!

I have made this probably a dozen times and have finally found the missing ingredient.....GROUND GINGER!!!!  I changed the recipe a lot but was happy to find a good base.  I sub out different veggies, broccoli, water chestnuts, celery, bamboo shoots, onion, peas and omitted the chicken.  I also sub veg stock. Add a few dashes of sesame oil while sautéing the veg.  Upped the cornstarch an extra tbs and 2 tbs of soy sauce.   Add a couple dashes of ground ginger and good to go :)

This was phenomenal!!  I didn't use as much butter -- and boiled 4 chicken breasts (I like my protein!) ahead of time. I used mushrooms and canned corn  because I hate baby corn.    I used rice vermicelli soaked in chicken broth -- could have used plain water though it tasted quite chicken-y enough!  This went so AWESOME with the Sweet and Sour Pork III from this site.  Holy Hannah, I found a way to satiate my Chinese food craving!

Just made this recipe today and I must say, we loved it. I did the onions, celery and mushrooms (canned) along with the garlic powder. Sauted that a few minutes then threw in raw chopped chicken breast and continued to saute till cooked. Then the chicken broth and a can of drained stir fry vegtables. Simmered that a few minutes and then the soy sauce and then the cornstarch water mix. I served over rice noodles and some sides of sweet plum sauce and soy sauce. I will make this often. Thanks for the good recipe.

It was ok. I liked the mix of veggies and the crunchiness but overall it was just "ok".
