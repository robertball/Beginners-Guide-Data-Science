Enjoyed these a lot. Used a 10x16 pan. Didn't have cranberries so used one cup of currants. Cooked for 33 minutes. Liked the pumpkin but will try it with buttercup squash next time as it is a little sweeter and is my favorite.  To bring to a function I would add a little more honey or drizzle some icing as this recipe is not on sweet .  

I will definitely be making these again.

Great flavor and texture, especially for being gluten-free!
