Add in a frozen banana and it tastes just like banana bread! Can be made lighter with nonfat milk and Truvia as sweetener. If your banana is ripe enough, you don't even need sweetener!

Turned this into a smoothie by adding frozen cantaloupe.  I used a pasteurized egg, Horizon Organic Lowfat Milk, Truvia, and cut the cinnamon amount in half (personal taste preference).  This is such a good neutral base for adding any type of frozen fruit if you prefer a smoothie.  Very nice.
