I tried this recipe because I have some extra honey and I was a little suspicious because I've never used honey to bake before. The cookies were so easy to make and turned out beautiful! Eating a warm cookie with a glass of milk was divine! The cookie has a "cakey" consistency to it when warm. Absolutely recommended! I'm thinking of trying to drizzle some melted chocolate on it to make it prettier for a gift!

A good, basic butter cookie recipe. Good honey flavor, with a hint of vanilla. You could drizzle a little chocolate glaze over them for more taste, if you want, or roll in cinnamon sugar before baking. I halved the recipe and got 3 dozen 2-inch cookies. I'll make these again!

These are pretty good! I didn't have quite the honey required, but they still turned out good. Someone else mentioned they're bland. Well, they're like shortbread cookies. They are good as basic butter cookies go. These would be wonderful with a cup of hot tea. If you do feel they need dressing up, easy enough to do. I rolled some in cinnamon sugar at the suggestion of someone else here. Some others I made a deep well (don't just use your thumbprint - they spread too much) and added a dab of raspberry jam. Delicious variations! These are versatile little cookies. Eat them as is, or try adding your own twist.

Please read. This cookie was awesome. My batches turned out beautiful too! Refridgerate before you cook for sure, makes a fluffer cookie. Personally, I added more sugar and took out 1/2 cup of flour. I add sugar to everything though. It does dough in the middle, enough to bug a person. My cookies had to be light brown (like the bottoms usually are) all over to get the dough cooking. Overall loved it. Would be great with tea.

I made these yesterday.  I thought the flavor was more 2 dimesional rather than the preferred 3 dimensional.  At one point I pushed in a big chocolate ship face down in the cookie.  Made them look cute like buttons but did not really changed the flavor.  That being said, I fed them to my 19 year old boys (who tend to be brutally honest) and they really liked the cookie as is.  The rest of my family did too.  So there you have it.  It is one I would make again because it was well received by my kids.  I think I will add some butter extract though and try that.

This is an EXCELLENT cookie for toddlers because it's simple and not too hard and not too soft. I halved the recipe and got 3 doz. The dough is great for cut out cookies too. I rolled it out (probably would be easier with a little refridgeration) and had wonderful little heart-shaped wafers. Reduce baking time to 7 min. in this case. I don't like the consistency when baked in "balls" like orig. recipe said - too cakey. Shape should be flatter. Another great shape for kids is make a snake and curve into an "o" shape, connect and flatten a bit. Add 1/2 - 1 tsp. cinnamon for more flavour. I used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 cup white - next time I think I'll try leaving the white out - they're a little too sweet.

My family did not care for these.  They did not have much taste.  I'll put this recipe in file 13.

I did not like the consistency of these cookies or the flavor. they were doughy in the middles and i bake alot so its not my oven. eveything else turns out perfectly done. this ones not a keeper for me. the flavor may be personal taste but the dough is not fully cooked.

I made these thinking they were biscuits, but that was my fault because I did not read the whole thing, but after I had made the dough I decided to finish it off. They were great! I added a tiny little chocolate in the middle and they are delicious. Not really sugary but just a hint sweet from the honey. If you do not have honey you can substitute blue agave. Works perfect!!!!! Good luck all you little cooks out there!
