I cut this recipe out of the Food Section of a Boston newspaper years ago- 
 It is also called "Peking Pot Roast".
 There is one big difference that might make this recipe more appealing to those reviewers who
 didn't like it.
Before cooking the roast, the newspaper recipe called for soaking the roast in red wine vinegar for 2 hours.
 It doesn't have to be a lot of vinegar, just 1 cup in a large plastic bag, turning several times.
 Afterwards, the roast is rinsed with water, removing excess vinegar.
 This not only affects the flavor of the meat but tenderizes it as well.
 I was fascinated by the "Peking Pot Roast" recipe & that was over 10 yrs ago. Maybe using this additional step will make a difference to the folks who tried this & didn't like it.
 Good luck, thanks as always to allrecipe.com

What a great dinner we had last night!  I find it difficult to rate dishes based on the way they're written here.  Invariably, this thing and/or that thing gets changed due to others' reviews etc.  But I digress....

There's another recipe here @ AllRecipes.com, Pulled Pork, that is so completely delicious I can't stand it.  Sooo, I did something similar with this beef (seasoning it a bit more since beef tends not to be as naturally flavorful):  In addition to the coffee, I added a can of beef broth to the crock pot.  This was after, however, I rubbed the entire roast with minced garlic, onion powder, kosher salt and pepper.  Every hour or so, I flipped the roast over and added another dab of kosher salt and pepper.  Throughout the day, the house smelled wonderful; at the end of the day, dinner *was* wonderful!  The meat fell apart as I hoped, so I presented it by layering it against some grilled sourdough bread, along with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The gravy was awesome!  I made it using Wondra.  Both of my sons had seconds of everything.  My husband had a third helping of the meat and gravy!

I can't believe how fantastic and easy this was! My husband HATES coffee. I have to admit I felt a little deceitful making this knowing just how much he can't stand it, but I remember my sister in law making some really fancy (and complex) roast recipe that called for coffee. Anyway, I made this, substituting jarred, chopped garlic (that's all I had) and my left over morning coffee. I sprinkled the roast with salt and pepper and let her go for 8 hours in the crockpot. When the meat was done, I made the gravy, as described, except I wanted a bit more, so I added about a cup more water and a beef bullion cube. Then salt and pepper to taste (I may have used some onion salt for the gravy). Anyway, it was WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL and my husband had NO CLUE it was cooked in coffee all day. I finally fessed up when he was finished. He was shocked. Will make this again and again! Thanks.

Very tender. Flavorful enough to be enjoyed by people who are watching their sodium intake. If not in a special diet, simply rub salt and other seasonings to taste (black pepper, onion powder, sage, thyme, red pepper, or whatever else you like). Make sure to use coffee with robust flavor (such as that of Arabica beans). Prepare the coffee as instructed on the container. Do not prepare strong coffee by ommitting water or increasing the powder -- this will only make the roast and gravy very bitter.

This is a great recipe! I had a smaller 
inside round roast(2.5 lbs) I took someone's advice and soaked it in redwine vinegar in a ziplock bag overnight. I forgot to rinse off the meat before cooking it and the house smelled like vinegar all morning. I seasoned he roast well with garlic powder,mustard powder,salt and pepper, and browned it for a few minutes before putting it in the slow cooker. I put 3 quartered potatoes in the bottom of the crock, used a whole head of garlic, and added about a cup of beef broth. It was ready after six hours on low. SO tender and tasty. I was worried about it being bitter or strong with the forgotten vinegar and the coffee, but it was great. The gravy wasn't a favorite. I will definately use this (modified) recipe again!

I thought this would be terrible with adding coffee to a roast...boy, was I wrong.  It was great!  My children loved it...even my in-laws!! There is no coffee taste to the meat.  The meat was so tender.  I plan on using this alot for company.  Easy to fix!  Thanks for a great recipe.- DSB - Colorado

Truly delicious! This recipe made an inexpensive cut of beef taste like it belonged in an upscale restaurant. In addition to the coffee, I added about 1-1/2 c. beef broth (made from powdered boullion), 1/2 sliced onion and rubbed roast with blk pepper and chili powder. In 6 hours we had a very tender, very tasty dinner. I used the liquid to make gravy and served with garlic mashed potatoes, corn and homemade bread--how much more of an all-American meal can you get? Tomorrow the leftovers will become tacos to honor the hispanic side of my heritage :-) Thanks for the terrifically easy and tasty recipe!

The garlic was a little over the top for me, but overall this was a good recipe.  If the coffee evaporates too much, you will get a burned flavor.  Dilute the juices if this happens before making the gravy, and add a teaspoon or two of sugar to counteract the bitterness.  Prevent this from happening by occasionally adding water or beef stock to  your pot while cooking.  Good recipe, good flavor.

This was a great recipe.  I read some reviews and was worried about the coffee adding a burnt taste, so I used 11/2c water and mixed in 1 tsp instant coffee and one beef oxo cube.  I had great reviews that nite!! Very nice! will use again, and again...

I've cooked various cuts of both beef AND pork with coffee for years..so many, in fact,that I don't remember how it started. The coffee adds a depth and richness of color that doesn't happen with baking alone. It also enhances the flavor. Living in the south, red-eye gravy was the first time I'd ever heard of using coffee, but now I add it to nearly every kind of gravy I make - beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and sausage. I also keep a small jar of instant coffee on hand and use a teaspoon or two in certain soups and stews.

Coffee is wonderful with meat dishes.  Like other reviewers, I recommend adding salt, beef boullion, or vegeta to the coffee before putting the roast on to cook.  And a touch of sugar added to the gravy will balance the bitterness of the coffee. 

Also, I suggest using one of the following techniques to ensure a tender roast.

1. In a medium high skillet, quickly brown the roast on both sides before putting in the oven.

or---
2. One day prior to cooking, seal the roast and approx 1 cup of red wine vinegar in a large ziplock.  Shake lightly to coat and refridgerate.

My husband a non-coffee drinker (ick!) loved it.  I did add about 1/2 cup of beef broth to the recipe and included mushrooms, onions and diced up roasted peppers in olive oil and herbs.  It was fantastic!!!!

Awesome!!!  I also added 1 can of beef broth so  could make more gravy.  (I did add beef bullion while making gravy.)  I also put carrots in.  Could not taste ANY coffee.  Was the best beef roast I've ever made.  I hope I have some for lunch today!

I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this recipe.  The roast was extremely tough and bland.  I'm going back to the roast my Mom used to make.

Certainly easy, but is it a roast beef or a pot roast?  The meat was grayish and not very attractive, and the flavor was fair.  However, the leftovers were good in sandwiches,  Probably won't make this again.

I have never had a roast in the crock pot come out dry???? But this too happened to others. Could it have been from the deep slits in the meat to place the garlic?  Will definately not make again.......ruined a very good piece of meat.....ps added can of beef broth too from advice of others with dry meat.

Neither my husband nor I cared for this recipe.  The meat was dry and not very flavorful, and the gravy was just so-so.  The ingredient list says to mince the garlic; the instructions say to use whole cloves.  I cut the cloves into thirds and they did not cook through; they were crunchy and harsh-tasting.  Not something I will make again.

I fixed this in the slow cooker.  It was very juicy and tender.  Had a very good flavor.  It made the most beautiful brown gravy to which I did season a little.  I made the recipe as written, next time I will season to taste, but definite will make again.

I also tweaked the recipe quite a bit but the result was fantastic!  First, I soaked the meat overnight in a mix of red cooking wine and balsamic vinegar.  After rinsing off the marinade and stuffing the roast with the garlic, I seasoned it with garlic salt, oregano, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes then browned it for about 10 minutes.  Then it went in with some potatoes and onions.  It smelled great while it cooked and it tasted wonderful.  The gravy turned out nicely, as well.  I'll be making this again.

This is blissfully simple and so good - tender and flavorful - with no coffee taste - just rich beefy flavor. I froze half and served it the 2nd time over noodles.  Any recipe that lets you throw a hunk of meat in a pot, add the leftover morning coffee, leave for the day and come home to dinner is a keeper.

Sorry... I just didn't like the flavor of the gravy using the coffee.  It was really rich.  I love coffee but don't like the beef/coffee combination.

Even tho I thought the coffee sounded wierd, and I HATE coffee, I gave this a shot. I am really glad I did.  It is delicious.  I did add some onion slices to it.  I also added a little wine, cajun seasoning and little soy sauce.  The gravy was delicious,and the meat was really tender.  The left over meat I shredded, mixed with the gravy and had on toasted buns the next day.  A keeper at our house!!

Pretty good with the suggested alterations. I did the red wine vinegar marinade overnight, rinsed then seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic and onion powders. Then I browned it in a little light olive oil before adding to the slow cooker set on low for about 6 hours. I also had to season the gravy with the same seasonings plus half a beef bouillon cube. It was okay but I don't think I will make this again.

This was not so good.  It was edible and OK, but I didn't find it to be anything special. I could not even detect that coffee was part of the recipe.

This is good, it made a very tender roast, but the coffee taste is a little odd, and you can taste the coffee. As is, I think this recipe is missing one crucial ingredient, and that's beef broth. I added about 2 T of better than beef bouillon to my gravy and that made it 4 stars.

Super easy to make.  I cooked my roast beef in the slow cooker for about 7 1/2 hours and it came out fork tender.  However, the garlic seemed a bit overpowering for my taste, and my roast beef came out more like pot roast.

This roast was delicious. However, there wasn't enough liquid, and the bottom of my roasting pan started to burn. I had to salvage my beef by pouring a can of beef broth over it. It's very possible that I misread the directions. And the beef DID turn out very tasty. My cats were begging for bits (the little fellas were out of luck-- garlic is not good for cats).

Use the red wine vinegar tip, it can't hurt and it will probably help. If the amount of coffee intimidates you, substitute beef broth for some of it. I browned my meat in a pan first, and added veggies to it while it was cooking. I liked the addition of coffee to this pot roast and will probably use that again. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out pretty good but I wish I rubbed a bit more seasoning on the roast prior to putting in the slow cooker.  I used some of the tricks mentioned in other reviews like marinating it in red wine vinegar for a few hours.  I also added 1/2 can of beef broth.  The meat was very tender and juicy after 6 hours of cooking on low.  Try rubbing it with a lot of salt/pepper/garlic/onion powder...whatever you like prior to cooking for added flavor.

This is excellent...I would add one suggestion that I always used when I had my cafe....I would deep brown the roast in coffee and garlic atop the stove before putting in the oven on a very slow bake. The dark color not only looks great but adds to the taste.

This was really good.  I left it on low in my slow cooker for 8 hours and it was really tender.  I took a couple of other reviewers tips, added a teaspoon of sugar to the coffee to offset any bitterness, and added some vegeta for flavour.  Even my 13 yr old who doesn't like coffee liked it.

While I would not call this my favorite roast recipe, it was a nice change of pace.  The only thing I had to add, like many others who reviewed this recipe, was salt.  Overall, it is a nice recipe to have on hand because I always have garlic and coffee in the house, and it's a great make-ahead meal.

Don't skip the marinating in vinegar step. It's what helps make this sooo tender. After marinating, you need to brown the roast until it is almost burnt - yes, almost burnt. I hate coffee, but the roast did not taste like coffee. The flavor was awesome! This recipe originated from the newspaper columnist Heloise and she called it Peking Roast. Search for her original recipe, follow her instructions and you won't be sorry.

I used a very cheap cut of beef that I had no clue what else to do with, so my expectations were very low. This roast turned out surprisingly good. Although it was not particularly tender, I blame the beef and not the recipe.   I had plenty of gravy and I could not really detect the coffee flavor (I used espresso). Thanks for the recipe!

The smell that filled the house was incredible!  I didn't make the gravy, but I will next time.  It was so moist it was falling apart in the crock pot.  I did it a little longer than 3 hours, and it was delish.  I'm about to heat some up now!

I had actually given up on cooking a roast because they always came out dry and tough.  But I decided to give another recipe a chance and tried this one.  This was the easiest, tenderest roast I have ever cooked.  I didn't add the garlic because we don't like a lot of garlic and my family ate the whole roast.  No leftovers!!  My 12 year old grandson that won't eat anything that doesn't come from a fast food restaurant ate 3 helpings!!!

It was a good roast, we couldn't especially taste the coffee. I added even more coffee then was suggested because I was cooking it longer then the time recommended. So I guess my question is what does the coffee do for the roast? Is it just flavoring or is there some other factor I'm missing?

I found this roast to be somewhat tough, but perhaps it was our cut of meat.  Also, I am a nursing mother, and after eating this my baby would not fall asleep! If you are sensitive to caffine or a nursing mom, perhaps use decaf!

This turned out to be probably the best roast I've ever prepared..hubby thought so too!  I did add a 14 oz. can of condensed beef broth and I also added potatoes to the slow cooker.  Also added extra corstarch since I had more liquid.  Wonderful recipe!! Thanks so much!

The name threw some folks off, but once they tried it they liked it. We took the hint from a few others and marinated the roast in red wine vinegar (to tenderize) for 2 hours. We also used beef stock in place of the water.

I gave this 5 stars with the changes I made. I used some suggestions by other reviews and tweaked it to make it the way we like it, and it was amazing! First, I didn't have a roast, so I actually used Y-bone steaks -relatively cheap cut and fantastic for the slow-cooker as the bone adds flavour and by the end of the day the meat was FALLing off the bone tender!  I started by rubbing the meat with salt, pepper, minced garlic, dried onion flakes, and paprika (instead of the cayenne suggested by other users, as we are a bit shy of hot spices). I just basically covered the meat in this dry rub seasoning.  Then I put it in the crockpot and covered with the coffee, beef stock and also added about a TBSP (or a little less) of whole grain mustard.  It made the whole house smell amazing all day, and it was a real hit with my husband and my little girl. Will definately make this again. Didn't make the gravy this time (we had it with roast veggies in the oven) but next time I might make the gravy and mashed potatoes. This is so easy to make and versatile and yummy!

I made this recipe quite frankly expecting a failure.  All i had was a cheap cut of meat and flavored coffee.  I made it in the slow cooker with Toasted Coconut flavored coffee, crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  It came out DELICIOUS!!! Even the gravy tasted amazing.  Will definitely make again and again.

Pretty much followed the recipe as written, made in slow cooker.  Mine did turn out dry, however, but had a good flavor.  I waited until my husband was done eating and asked if knew what I used to make it.  He had no clue there was coffee involved until I told him.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yes,this recipe sounds " interesting" due to the coffee and vinegar. I am here to tell you that this has to be some of the best roast ever. It's a good savory taste but is a clean light dish, as sometimes roast recipes are a little too rich for me. I generally followed the instructions except a few tweaks here and there. I will be serving this again!

The best roast I have ever had.  Husband and kids could not believe that it was made with coffee.  Very tender and seasoned throughout.  The only thing I wouldn't do again is make the gravy with the juices......had a distinct bite to it, didn't taste like coffee, but was very sharp.  Would be much better with a milder brown gravy.

My son and I and husband really cannot even give it a 1 i had to throw the whole recipe out cause we could not even stand to eat it. Could not stand the taste of it, could be that we are not coffee drinkers do not know just did not like the roast beef mixture with the coffee.

This was fantastic.  I too worried about the coffee making it taste burnt, and the gravy did have a tinge of that flavour.  I added 2 beef bullion cubes to the gravy mix (and used my blender to make sure the bullion got fully mixed into the gravy), and it was wonderful!

I was intrigued with this recipe as I am a coffee lover.  How can the beef be so dry with all of that liquid?  (In addition to the coffee, I added water and a beef bouillon cube.  My husband hardly ever says "don't make this again" but did this time.

My husband thinks this is the best roast beef he has ever had!  I started it stove top in a enameled cast iron dutch oven then put in oven at 285 for 3 hours and turned out wonderful.  Tender, moist and flavorful.  I did not make gravy---married to the only man who does not like gravy.

I've made this recipe in a roasting bag always. Just follow the directions on the roasting bag per lb of meat. I use 2 cups of strong left over coffee from the morning. I slice the roast and insert cloves of garlic but that's it. They say not to add salt and pepper but I always do. I cook my potatoes, carrots and onions separately. The coffee really does make a difference.

It was lacking in flavor and very dry. Maybe I just didn't have a good piece of meat, I used a round roast. The only thing that saved it was the gravy/sauce, which could of had more flavor. I won't make again.

Not quite sure what to say about this one. I can't say it was horrible but I also can't say it was great. It was an interesting combination and I would suggest trying it at least once. I liked it my husband did not but he still ate it and we ate the left overs.

Not my cup of tea.  Meat was not tender and the coffee did not flavor it enough.  Strange, I've used coffee in stews and loved it, but this was not good.  Sorry.

I tried this in the crock pot and wasn't happy with it at all.  My husband, who loves pot roast AND coffee, said that if I didn't make it again, he'd be okay with that.  I thought it gave the beef a "corn beef" kind of flavor (if you didn't know that it was cooked in coffee).  When you DID know it was cooked in coffee, the coffee flavor was very evident.  I tasted the broth and decided that it wasn't worth making into the gravy - it was kind of bitter and had a very strong flavor.  I've giving the recipe two stars because I was out of real garlic, so I had to use garlic powder.  Perhaps that would have made the difference - so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt.

Very, very nice, very easy to prepare.  My daughter came home from school and wanted to know what that wonderful smell was.  The roast was very tender without falling apart, the gravy was delicious, needed a bit of salt in the gravy.  We'll be preparing this one again.  Everyone was surprised that coffee was in the recipe.

This was surprisingly delicious! The second time I made it I used a bit of water with the coffee, to take the sharp coffee taste out of the gravy. My family loves this and it is so easy.

This was very good and was a nice change of pace to the traditional roasts I usually make.  I halved this recipe because I only had a 2. lb roast and it worked just fine.  I also browned the roast before adding the garlic.  The gravy was very good too.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe add some salt to the gravy.  Also, note to families with kids....they may not be wild about the taste of this, one of my sons loved it, the other did not.

Absolutely delicious!! A pleasant change of pace from the traditional water/beef broth method of making a roast. Love the gravy....My favorite comfort food is mashed potatoes & gravy anyway, but now I have a new found fondness for it! Java junkie or not, you'll appreciate the flavorful results of this recipe. Can't wait to make this again!!

This was quick and simple recipe. My family and dinner guests liked it. The meat was tender; however, it need something to give it a little pazzaz. I am not sure if I will make this again due to my personal taste.

this was great, i made it in the slow cooker, could have cooked less as it was a small roast but i was sleeping, anyway i used wondra to make the gravy, also shredded the meat and mixed it back in the slow cooker with a bit of the drippings. the gravy came great, we ate this all week for sandwiches, the gravy is a must although it was tender, it was a bit dry but the gravy solved that problem.  also put it on a sandwith with homemade bread, some cheese and sour cream, really filling. does not taste like coffee at all.

i followed advice of other reviewer and marinated in red vinegar for a couple hours .  Also i added  a splash of worcheschire sauce  to crockpot for a deeper flavor.   The vinegar left a bit of a tang to meat.  I cant say that the tang was a good addition so not sure I would do that step again. Sauce was really good.  I served with mashed potatoes and carrots.

I was surprised with how good this really was!  The meat by itself wasn't great though... I made the gravy nice and thick, teased the meat apart, and stirred the two together then served it on top of rice.  Great combination of flavors and the stirring together eliminates any dryness to the meat.

This was deliicious! I make pot roast in the slow cooker all the time but the coffee really took it to a new level of YUM! I did not have the fresh garlic so I simply coated the roast in salt, pepper and garlic powder. I added coffee and one heaping teaspoon of beef Better Than Bouillon to the crock pot. This is a keeper!

Certainly not what I expected!  I did season the beef with salt and pepper, and decided to add 1/2 cup of beef broth because I was afraid the coffee flavor would be too strong.  My husband and I both thought it was great - moist, tender and very flavorful.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks, Karela, for sharing this simple recipe!

The coffee does give the roast a different, but good flavor.  It definatly needed something else which I couldn't put my finger on, so I added some salt and worchestershire.  Turned out pretty good and the juices made a good gravy after thickening.

I read the reviews and was really anxious to try what I thought was a simple roast beef recipe in the crockpot.  Since I love coffee I also thought it would be great. Before I made this I read lots of reviews and decided to make according to the exact recipe this first time and not "experiment".  I followed the recipe to a T and it was very dry and very bitter taste from the coffee.  The gravy had no flavor and even salt and pepper did not help from tasting like burnt coffee.  The best part of the meal was I did make homemade mashed potatoes...not from the box!  But even these had to have butter on them since the gravy was so bad!  We ate one helping and I'm proud of my 2 teens for at least eating it for Sunday dinner.  Will not make again!!!  It puzzles me that so many raved and raved about it!  What did I do wrong??

I used a large bone-in beef blade roast. I did marinate/soak it in a cup of vinegar as someone suggested, although it may because I didn't use the red wine variety that it didn't tenderize enough. Seasoned it with minced garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper. Next time I will also rub it down with some Worcestershire sauce for added flavour. I used instant espresso powder, about 2 TBsps. to a cup of water. Also added a half cup of water to ensure there was enough liquid in the pan so it wouldn't burn. Cooked it in the oven for about 2 hours. This cut of meat would do best in a slow cooker though, since it wasn't as tender as I'd hoped. The gravy itself had a nice consistency, but I did need to add about 1 tsp. or so of sugar to tone down the bitter aftertaste. This definitely mellowed out the bitterness of the espresso. Served this with some white rice and steamed vegetables. Not sure if I'd make it again though.

I also had high hopes for this recipe. I tweaked it a bit by sprinkling a bit of garlic and onion powder, then browned all sides in a hot skillet.  After I put it in the slow cooker with the coffee for 8hrs. The roast came out falling apart but very bland and dry. I thought it was because I needed to make the gravy for it....I started the gravy and once it was thick I tasted it, boy was I glad I did that!!! I would have really ruined the roast if I had poured that gravy all over it! I wasn't good and thats an understatment. guess not everyones tastes are the same, but I won't be making this one again.

I really had high hopes for this recipe, however, it didn't turn out well.  The meat was dry and the gravy tasted weird.  I could taste the coffee in the gravy.  Cooked 8 hours on low in the slow cooker.  It wasn't horrible, but it was my worst pot roast. Will not try this recipe again.

I was really hoping I would have a use for my leftover breakfast coffee with this recipe. I made the recipe with a high cut of beef roast, and prepared exactly as suggested. The roast turned out dry and flavorless and the juice was really not good enough for gravy.

Sadly, I really had hopes for this recipe, but it just did not turn out well. As much as I love coffee and roast, maybe I just don't quite get them together.

It was good and different. I could tell a subtle taste of coffee was in there. Everyone enjoyed it and welcomed the different flavor to the usual pot roast. I also used baking cocoa before. Delicious both ways.

This was great.  I added a can of beef broth, salt and pepper and half an onion because I wanted a lot of gravy.  The meat was extremely tender.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the meat was rare/medium rare as planned, but it was seriously lacking flavor.  Not good at all.

I have used this recipe for years.  It's fabulous!  I use coffee, a couple shakes of worchestershire and a bit of soy sauce.  No salt if you use the soy.  Trust me this is great

not a bad roast...not great either...I didn't enjoy the gravy too much, although I am a coffee lover...I have done my roast like this for years, just insert garlic into it before cooking, but I tried this recipe for the coffee...I'll probably just stick with beef stock next time.

I wasn't to impressed, not sure what i did wrong.  But it did not have a lot of flavor, maybe it was the cut of meat i was using?  I don't know, but i don't think i am going to make this again.

I made this recipe in the crock pot, exactly as it appears.  The meat was very tender, very tasty.  But I made the gravy from the drippings, and it was awful!  It was so bland.  I added salt, but that didn't do it.  I guess I needed to finesse the gravy more, but I don't have enough experience with gravy to do this on the fly.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime, after I devise a new "gravy" plan of attack!

Flavor is very bland. I added soy sauce, sliced onions, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. I would probably make again. Thanks.

Very moist and flavorful. I didn't mince the garlic cloves though. I just inserted them whole into slits in the meat. Before serving I pulled them out, mashed them up and added them to the mashed potatos I was serving as a side. Yum! Had plenty of juices to make gravy. Made a great meal and super easy too!

Very simple and great tasting.  Three out of the six people who ate this HATE coffee and have no idea the roast was cooked in it.  Meat was very tender.  Will definitely make again.

I made this roast just last week and it was so delicious and easy to prepare I am making it again this week.  The gravy is out of this world. You don't taste the coffee at all, just a very tender roast with a yummy gravy. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I don't understand why everyone thought this was so great. I thought it just tasted like pot roast. Nothing special. My husband felt the same. I don't make any recipes I find here until I read 95% of the reviews. We were very dissapointed!

This was pretty good, but mine did turn out a little dry.  I cooked on high instead of low, but I'll also have to try the vinegar tip in the other reviews next time.  It was in serious need of salt, so I added a few splashes of soy sauce for the last 2 hours, seemed to do the trick.

Very simple and very good. Coffee, broth made a fantastic gravy. Only changes I made were to rub meat with celery salt and add some chopped red onion on top of roast. Basted several times during cooking. Mine came out a bit dry but that was my fault due to a faulty meat thermometer. I will make this again.
