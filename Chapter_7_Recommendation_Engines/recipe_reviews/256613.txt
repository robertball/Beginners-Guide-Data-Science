Excellent recipe! My only substitute was using a T. of granulated sugar for the maple syrup as I didn’t have any on hand. My kids gobbled them up so fast! The batter is thin, so these are not “fluffy” pancakes, but they are light and delicious.

These turned out very well for most of the familia, although hubby didn’t like it as much. I had to grind the spelt in the coffee grinder because I didn’t have it in flour form, and that may have made the texture not quite as fine. I also increased the maple syrup to 3 tbsp to make it sweeter. All in all, a good recipe for using a very healthy grain.

I am always looking for recipes that are non acidic and spelt flour is an ingredient I use.  These pancakes are delicious, my husband even said they were good.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used coconut milk - still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

These pancakes are delicious! Whole spelt flour does beautifully in pancakes. These are not very sweet... because I like to eat pancakes plain as a snack, I may increase the amount of sweetener next time. I was out of maple syrup so used honey.

I LOVE these pancakes. They are fluffy and moist. I don't feel heavy after eating them either.  They are very easy to make.

I'm not experienced with spelt. I'm also not experienced with pancakes. Therefore, I nervously subbed 1/3 c. white flour for 1/3 c. of the spelt. The spelt was factory ground and kept frozen from the time I purchased it. Pancakes had a nice, nutty/grainy texture. I used the common buttermilk sub of milk + vinegar. I also swapped out 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the cinnamon. I upped the maple syrup to 3 or 4 Tbsp since we do not eat them with syrup. I added about a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Delicious! Thanks for the great recipe. I can't wait to do more cooking with spelt.
