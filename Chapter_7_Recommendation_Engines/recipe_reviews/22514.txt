I have made these for several parties, and everywhere I take them they are a big hit.  People just can't believe they are so simple.

I have made these for years. A big plus is that these can be made ahead so they are ready to go in the oven when needed for your guests. I use the precooked bacon you can buy at Costco. !/2 of a slice of bacon works perfectly. The precooked bacon also makes it easier for these to cook and get past that rubbery bacon stage without burning. I use the 6 inch appetizer skewers instead of toothpick for ease of eating and serving. For ease of cleanup, bake on a foil lined baking sheet. Thanks for sharing FLIPPERMD2000. These are winners at our house!

Excellent, everyone loved it.  Works great because you can prepare  the day before your event.
