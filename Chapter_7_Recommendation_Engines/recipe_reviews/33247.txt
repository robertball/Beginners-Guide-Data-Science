This was REALLY tasty.  It was very similar to something we ordered last week at a local sushi restaurant, only we paid $12 for a TINY portion at the restaurant and were able to make a massive amount of this (with sashimi grade ahi, even) for under $15.  My only problem is that it was extremely salty because of all the soy sauce. Thus, I recommend using low sodium soy sauce.

NO COOKING and this recipe tastes awesome!!! It was a smash hit at a formal dinner party! I was out of sesame seeds and green onion. I substituted a small amount of white onion for the green. I also used fresh red peppers. I suggest tasting often as you mix in small portions of the soy sauce. A half cup of soy sauce would have been way too salty.

This was delicious the way I ended up making it. I don't care for avocado at all, so I substituted diced mango. It came out very tasty.

This was a big hit at my dinner party.  Great with sesame crackers - I would suggest easy on the soy as well and I also grated some fresh ginger and cilantro on it - was yummy!

The name of this recipe is very fitting...it IS absolutely amazing ahi! I made this for some friends who were over to watch the game and they devoured it.  This app. is a tribute to any sushi lover.

ETA:  I suggest using a sushi/sashimi grade soy sauce with this dish.  It balances the sweet and salty flavors and tastes much smoother.

Loved this, my family loves sushi and this fulfilled our craving on a Sunday night.  The only thing I would change is to use a little less soy sauce and make sure to use low sodium grade.

I made this recipe for a friend of mine who just moved here from Florida where she ate lots of fresh sushi.  She was so impressed! It was a huge hit.  I fixed the same recipe for a formal dinner party and my guests all said it was definitely "amazing".  They all wanted the recipe.  I would also recommend the low sodium soy sauce because it is a bit salty.  Very impressive appetizer for very little work!

The name says it all! I served this over salad of mixed baby greens, with some Sweet & Spicy Green Beans (recipe from this site) mixed in, as well as some peeled, roasted potatoes.  This was fantastic!!  I did sear the tuna for about 30 seconds per side, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I don't really like raw fish that much, and I will not lie, this recipe did not change my mind.  The reason I give it 5 stars is because my Japanese sister-in-law and brother loved and raved about it when I made it for them.  So, for those who like to eat shasimi and sushi, this is probably a 5 star recipe, and easy too...

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it has been fantastic! Truly, a beautiful flavor, with just the right amount of heat. Since it was so popular the first time, last night I doubled the amount of avocado to help it go just a bit further. I think next time I make it, I may even add a whole cup of cucumber, for the same reasoning. It was the most popular dish at both of the functions I attended, and everyone asked for the recipe. Simple to prepare, and stunning to serve. (My husband has now claimed this as his most favorite dish, and has requested a big bowlful at his next birthday)! Thank you for sharing this amazing dish! I will definitely make it again, and again...

Awesome Ahi Appetizer, made 24 servings into a full meal for 6 hungry friends and added bread. LOW SODIUM makes this meal perfect. I also added a little bit of spinach. Turned out great.

This dish was extremely salty, my husband and I could not even finish the dish. I would cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup, if that.

Wow...wow...wow!  Absolutely Amazing (as the title states!)  I have made multiple recipes from "AllRecipes" that I have loved, but this is the first time time I am writing a review!  Made as written, EXCEPT...I used way less low-salt soy salt!  It was at least an hour before we at it, so perhaps that just gave it even more time to marinade, so next time I will probably use even less!  I may even try Ponzu Sauce.  Also, make sure you cut the tuna small...I cut it in too 'big' of pieces, and found it was harder to 'scoop' or put on to pita chips or wasabi rice crackers.   I will DEF be making this again and again!

This was GREAT! I made it for an appetizer night and got nothing but rave reviews. One person did say it was a little too spicy but he's a wimp when it comes to spice. I would have added more!! It was very easy to make and looks beautiful. Can't wait to make it again!

I have made this recipe at least 20 times and it always gets rave reviews.  I did double the lemon and the cucumber in my version to give it a bit more tang.  I also serve this as a main dish on top of chilled riced noodles.  It is so fresh and tasty I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipes.

No complaints here.  This tasted amazing!!  I added some wasabi to the soy sauce mixture before combining everything.  Gave it a nice little kick.  I will definitely make this again and again!!!

The best!  Totally go with the low-sodium soy sauce like others have said, and I would add that you should chop the ingredients up a little smaller if you're going to use a thin cracker  - - - it gets heavy!

This was delicious!  I didn't have sesame seeds, so had to omit them.  Also, I wasn't sure if my ahi was sashimi grade, so I pan seared it to be on the safe side.  It was perfectly rare and had great flavour.  I served it with rice crackers.  I might add a bit of wasabi next time to give it a bit of kick.  Will make this again soon!  Thank you!

This recipe was awesome!  I served it over arugula salad and made it into a full dinner meal.  It was very filling and satisfying.  I used Organic Low-Sodium soy sauce and cut the oil in half.  Thank you for sharing.  Will definitely make this one again.

Wonderful!  As previously reviewed, use low sodium soy sauce...I only used 1/3 cup.  It is essential to carefully mix together for presentation...not for taste.  I felt like a gourmet chef when I served this...thank-you!!!

This was awesome!  A few changes I made were to use low-sodium soy sauce, and only 1/3 cup.  I also served this with rice crackers, pickled ginger & Boston bibb lettuce.  We put the mixture in the lettuce leaves and ate it like a lettuce wrap with pickled ginger either on the lettuce or on the side which was really, really good.
I don't like spicy food, but my husband loves it so I split the recipe and added the red pepper flakes to only one bowl.

Really enjoyed this dish. Perfect served cold for a hot summer day. 
A little too much soy sauce for my tastes, but good. 

I served on top of warm rice, side of buttered french bread, and a red wine. Delicious.

MMM!!  Wow, just like going to a sushi bar!  I do have a few suggestions.  First, I would recommend this with rice (add seaweed if you want the full sushi flavor).  Secondly, if you're not going to dilute it with something like white sticky rice, I highly suggest using low-sodium soy sauce.  I'm Asian and use soy sauce as much as I breathe!  But I still found it slightly salty... but still fantastic!!!

Love, love, love this. I am so happy I found this recipe. It was easy to make and cheap, considering what you pay at a restaurant for this dish. I also like this because it's low carb. I did use low sodium soy sauce but other than that followed the recipe to the T.

My tuna steaks were not sashimi grade, so I had to cook them. I broiled them with some seasoning and then made this recipe as a side/topping for the fish steaks. It was sooooo incredibly good. I used 50/50 cuke/avo. Highly recommended if you love avocado and cucumber, like I do!

SO GOOD! Followed others' suggestion and only put 1/8 cup soy sauce.I'm not a fan of "very salty" and this was the perfect amount of saltiness.  Also ground up the pepper flakes for a fresher taste (and put about half of that suggested). Added some fresh grated ginger and a side of wasabi sauce. Very good!! Would make again.

Absolutely delicious! made for a hawaiian themed cooking night. Very easy to prepare. We couldn't find sushi grade tuna, so we barely grilled the outside of the tuna before dicing. Would recommend light soy sauce to lessen the saltiness.

This recipe is AMAZING! My father swore her would never eat raw fish and I guilt tripped him into trying a bite. He immediately took a full portion and then went back for seconds! I would recommend using low sodium soy as the recipe is pretty salty, but otherwise it is perfect as it.

AMAZING!!!  I am not even a fan a raw fish.  I did not add the onions, I added cilantron instead and it was incredible.  I served this 2 of my friends while they were in town and they raved about it as well.  Never any left overs.  And it is a plus that is is so healthy!

This is the best.  I would give it six stars if I could.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I did use low sodium soy sauce.  Low sodium is the only type of soy I buy so it is what I had on hand.  I also served this on bagel chips and it was fantastic.  This is a MUST TRY for anyone that likes ahi tuna.

I loved this, even though I made it without the fish. Next time I will definitely get some ahi, and also cut back on the soya sauce (it was a little salty). Thanks for the recipe!

SO GOOD! other reviewers said that it was too salty but i think it's the combination of the red pepper spiciness and the saltiness of the soy sauce and ahi that is overpowering.  still delicious though!

Excellent!  I'm sure there's a technique to cutting the tuna that I'm unaware of, and will look more into that.  Also, don't be fooled, this is very rich!  I wanted to have it for dinner and was totally full after a small portion!  Tip: don't us regular soy sauce!  Kikkoman regular soy sauce will ruin this dish; I picked up a bottle of Kikkoman Premium Soy Sauce for Sushi/Sashimi.  The sodium content is only slightly less, but for some reason this sauce makes all the difference!

I made this last summer and it was so good. I did add more asian flavors like mirin and sushi vinegar to get some of my friends with “raw fish fears” to try it. Everyone that ate it loved it and I cannot wait to make it again.

This was delicious! I seared tuna steaks for thirty seconds on each side and cut it into cubes. I served it over rice as a main dish. I did forget to put the red pepper flakes which I will try next time, but I added a bit of rice wine vinegar into the mixture. So tasty and filling!

Impress your guests by serving in a martini glass :) The red pepper flakes really make this dish great.  I use black and white toasted sesame seeds and make sure not to use too much sesame oil or it will overpower the ahi.

This was very tasty. Reduce the soy sauce because it was too salty with the amount called for in the recipe.

Great recipe, only change I made was to use low sodium soy and use less of it.

Delicious and easy!  I have made this a few times and it is always a big hit.  Definitely best with low sodium soy sauce.

Recipe was yummy, however, my husband and I just can't do the raw fish thing.  It's partially mental but primarily there's a texture problem...even chilled in freezer prior to serving.  Thought this would be a good rookie recipe (and it was) but we just couldn't do it.  Also, I STRONGLY suggest you reduce the sesame oil unless you know you love the flavor..it is quite pungent and I'm not a fan!

I bought sushi grade ahi from my fancy local store for this meal.  Another tip I used was to use low sodium soy sauce that many other reviewers suggested.  Despite forgetting to purchase the cucumber this recipe was out of this world amazing!  If my family hadn't seen me making it, they would never have believed that it was a home made creation.  Exquisite!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING...just as the title claims!  Trader Joe's sells sashimi grade Ahi tuna for a very reasonable price.  I called my local store and they put one on hold for me b/c they go so quickly!  Thanks for this outstanding recipe!!!!

Amazing served over rice.  If you don't like heat, you can cut the red pepper in half.  You should definately use low sodium soy sauce.

Used a mixed sashimi with yellow tail, ahi, and salmon.  Recipe was delicious.  Wrapped in seaweed and devoured almost all of it in one sitting.

I made this with a pound of Ahi and left everything else the same - and it was amazing!  A sure hit!  I did sear the tuna before dicing it, but only because we had guests and children that may not have liked it raw. It was still delicious.

Great recipe! This is a variation of a Hawaiian dish called Poke (pronounced PO'keh)that uses ingredients readily available outside of the islands. Cutting the soy sauce in half and using low-sodium soy per other reviews are  also recommended to avoid overpowering this dish. It allows the freshness of this dish to shine. A key ingredient in most traditional poke dishes is mashed kukui nut, but you can substitute mashed cashew nuts. For this recipe, you can substitute the sesame seeds with just 1 or 2 coarsely mashed nuts. The sesame oil is a must - it imparts a wonderful nuttiness and smooth mouth feel to the dish.

I have had this requested 3 times this week alone for parties!  The simplest recipe.  I skipped the sesame oil, bought already toasted seeds (from Asian market)and added about a teaspoon of wasabi powder.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Cheap and PERFECT!

If you love raw fish like my girlfriend and I do...you'll love this!

The recipe will get you there without any hiccups...my only suggestion: Use low sodium soy sauce, or it will be too salty.

Good thing I read the reviews before making it. I only put 1/4 cup soy sauce and it's already very salty. I added wasabi in the recipe for extra zing. Turns out amazing. I will make it again when we have company.

I did put my own spin on it. I added 1 whole small tomato diced, 1 clove garlic smashed, sweet yellow onion diced instead of green (that's what I had on hand), and 1 quarter red bell pepper diced. I also did not use 1/2 cup of soy sauce, I only used 2 tablespoons and found that plenty. I forgot to toast the sesame seeds but the flavor came through by adding a tad more sesame oil. The added vegetables gave it more substance and added to the already great flavor of the original recipe. It is now something my family wants on a regular basis.

This was an awesome recipe.  I made tostadas out of it by using some white corn tortillas that I browned in a skillet with PAM and topped with a little lettuce.  My husband loved it and said it was perfect for a hot summer evening.

If you've ever ordered an "Ahi Tuna Tower" in a restaurant, this is it!   A great way to use up a little leftover Ahi from Ahi Steak night.  I served it over a bed of greens with some Maui Onion dressing and called it dinner!   Wonderful, thanks for the recipe!

LOVE this recipe! As long as you get the best Ahi you can find, then this is a GUARANTEED HIT! I served it with either the choice of crackers or slices of toasted baguette. The baguette was WAAAY better. Just make sure it's not too toasted that it becomes hard. Next time I'm going to toast the baguette with a little bit of parmesan cheese on top. I think that will go well with the poke.

I got accolades & requests for recipe all night at our Valentine's Day party! I did not use any soy sauce though just added in a sweet & savory Ginger Teriyaki marinade that we had in the house and my husband likes more "kick" so we added wasabi. Also, I served with big bowl of wontons. Will DEFINITELY use this recipe again... Big Hit!!!

Very good!  I made it tonight and it was a hit.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except:  I used at least 1/2 the soy sauce and about 1/2 the sesame oil.  I found the liquid and flavor to be plenty.  Also, I did not have sesame seeds and did not miss them.  I added 2 avocados because my husband loves them.  And I seared the tuna for about 10 seconds total but I think I might skip that step next time.  Great!

Avocados were too expensive so I used some chopped frozen mango I saved when they fell of the tree in season.  Instead of adding wasabi as some suggested I used about a tablespoon of Sriracha chili sauce and a chopped handful of cilantro.  Also flash grilled the yellowfin tuna steak about 30 seconds on each side to get a grill mark and taste before cutting it into bite sized pieces.  Served the tuna mixture over a bed of soft leafed red lettuce, toasted black and white sesame seeds along side the sweat and spicy green bean recipe.  The flavors had a refreshing summer appeal but I would eat it anytime.

WAY too much soy sauce.  I thought I would be safe using half of what the recipe said, but even that was too much.  My fish was just sitting in a puddle of soy sauce.  I would add a tablespoon at a time until you get the flavor you want.

Great recipe! ~ so easy to make this at home! If you have a good source for fresh ahi near you, definitely try this!

I combine the soy sauce (I recommend low-sodium), lemon juice, red pepper flakes & sesame oil, then fold in the diced ahi. I place the cucumber and green onions on top and refrigerate until I'm ready to serve. Waiting to mix in the greens  keeps the cucumber crunchy and the green onions fresher.  I dice the avocado just before serving. So colorful & flavorful!

This is awesome!  Tastes just like the ahi tuna appetizer at our favorite sushi place. Would go lighter on the soy sauce but don't change anything else!!  Thank you for posting, you just saved me some trips to the sushi restaurant.

Yep! Just like everyone else stated...1/4 cup soy and you have an EPIC spicy tuna salad. Leave out the sesame seeds  if you want - they just get stuck in your teeth and add nothing to the overall taste sensation. I'm embarrassed (well, not really) that I ate the entire bowlful all by myself. As good or better than any Asian restaurant offers.

I've made this twice and will make it again.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is way too much soy sauce in this recipe.  I cut the soy sauce in half and we liked it much better.  I also added a mango for color.  (The picture shows some orange color as well).  Very tasty.  I had to lightly pan sear my tuna because it wasn't sushi grade. I served with cold white rice as a meal and even my kids loved it!  Thank you for the amazing recipe!

Excellent dish. Tastes great and has more color with half tuna (maguro) and half salmon (sake).  Can cut the soy sauce in half.

Delicious! I varied on the recipe somewhat and marinaded the tuna overnight. I added purple cabbage, jalapeños, spinach and tomatoes and it added such a bright note to the dish. I fried egg roll wraps and bent them into taco shells. For the sauce I used a sweet Thai chili, and a splash of soy sauce.

Will absolutely make this again--delicious! I used Braggs amino instead of soy but didn't change up the ingredients other than that. I did layer in large martini glasses and it was beautiful! I started with a few tablespoons of seaweed salad, than the marinated tuna, avocado-onion-cucumber and seeds on top. I put a few pieces of ginger on one side like a garnish and large dots of wasabi on the rim of the glass. Wish I would have thought to take a picture!

I have made this a few times now, it the closest thing I have had to the poke served in Maui. In my opinion better than what most of the restaurants around here (Vancouver BC) serve. I had rave reviews from a couple of experienced poke fanatics using this recipe so I don’t think there is much need to tweak it. Enjoy!

This was a big hit at a party of 6. Even the 14-year-old child of the host devoured it. Here are some suggestions: At Whole Foods where I bought the tuna, it came frozen and pre-sliced. I thawed it just until I could cut it. I sliced it into cubes while still frozen and put it back into the refrigerator and skipped the whole icing direction.  In advance, I mixed together the sesame oil, only 2 tablespoons (1/8 c) of soy sauce, the green onions, and the red pepper flakes and placed in the refrigerator. I also diced the cucumber (about 1/2 a large cucumber) and placed in the refrigerator. At the last minute, I cut the avocado and mixed all the ingredients in the serving bowl, and topped with toasted black sesame seeds. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was outstanding, though one guest dunked his poke in more soy sauce. This is an easy recipe made easier by doing some steps in advance. The soy sauce issue in other reviews is a question of taste. If you want to taste the fresh tuna, and other flavors, opt for 2 tablespoons (1/8 cup) of soy as I did. It was plenty.

Still my favorite go-to poke recipe for years.  Except for one thing: 1/2 cup of soy sauce is insane.  Try 1 tbsp. instead and it will be way better.  This way it won't cover up the wonderful flavor of the fish nor be too salty as others have complained.

My guests and I thought this was very good. I will put less red pepper flakes in next time, because it was a littler hotter than I prefer. I spooned the sauce in gradually so not to overpower the tuna.

While we both enjoyed this recipe, we don't feel it earns a 5-star rating.  I read several other reviewers comments about too much soy sauce, so added it 1 tablespoon at a time.  For our  tastes, 3 tablespoons was just right.  I'm not sure it I'll make it again, as there are other poke' recipes we like better.

This was a big hit!  I used only half of the soy and it was perfect and simple - yet impressive!   I also thinly sliced  a bread stick and toasted them up  to eat with  it.  Definitely doing this again!

Really good, but garlic and fresh minced ginger make it even better.  Nice served with wonton chips or better yet, wonton cups baked in muffin tins. Or serve with iced cucumber as "cracker" for low carb option.

This seemed to be a cool recipe that would be perfect for company.  unfortunately the soy sauce issue absolutely ruined my entire dish.  I was throwing an Oscar party so I upped the servings to 10, which called for 3/4 cups of soy sauce. Before adding the soy sauce the dish looked delicious and so fresh with the cucumbers and onions. I read the reviews about the soy sauce and the saltiness, so I lowered the amount from 3/4 to 1/2 a cup.  I typically like generous seasoning and i love soy sauce so I thought lowering by 1/4 cup would be sufficient. 

The soy sauce completely changed the consistency from normal tartare consistency to a loose watery mess. what's worse is that I generally use this premium dark soy sauce they carry in Asian food stores and trader joe's.  it completely dyed the beautiful tuna a dark purple (i mean they looked like beets,  the tuna was unrecognizable!) I was so embarrassed.  It tasted okkaayy, but a little too salty and spicy and the appearance really threw it off.  i went ahead and served a small bowl of it with some chips.  many of my guests politely asked "what is it?"  this was $35 worth of tuna down the drain. 

I would try this recipe again,  but next time NOT with premium dark soy sauce,  and I will likely only use a splash of regular soy sauce vs any amount remotely like what the recipe calls for.

I doubled it since I had a whole slab of tuna, but apparently you have to be careful with the soy sauce. I doubled everything else but a whole cup of soy sauce ruined the whole thing. It was SOOOO salty.... I ended up giving 2lbs of fresh ahi tuna to my pet pig and chickens.  I might try again but will reduce the soy sauce by half. I can always add soy later.

This is so good.  My kids love it.  I love it.  It is super healthy.  I serve with rice crackers.  I use low sodium soy sauce and don't use quite as much as the recipe calls for.  I add some and taste... I love how soy sauce flavors some dishes but I don't like it to overpower.  There are so many other yummy flavors going on in this that I don't want to miss from overpowering soy sauce.
I get the frozen individually sealed tuna steaks at Albertson's or Sam's Club.  It doesn't say "sushi grade" but it is hard for me to pay the premium at the seafood bar at the grocery stores.  We eat a lot of tuna.  Some of the steaks seem to be more sushi grade: red, not many white fibers, no fishy smell.  Some aren't as good. I use only the good ones when I make sushi, sashimi, or seared ahi.  But the not so good ones work fine in this recipe because you can peel out any of the fibers and any fishy smell is lost with all the other flavors going on.

very good! I added some rice vinegar to it,  seared the tuna, and served it over a bed of rice as dinner! It is salty, but in a good way.

I cut the soy sauce in half. I made it for the Feast of Seven Fishes on Christmas Eve. It was gone way before anything else. And I made a lot! Obviously, freshest of fish required.

It's pretty darn close to the real deal. But 1/2c soy sauce was just too much. Made the dish too salty and overpowered the delicate ahi.

I normally never rate a modified recipe, but this particular one (since it's not cooked) lent itself well to experimenting.  I added 1/2 the amount of soy sauce to start with, taste-tested, and it was already too salty for my taste, so I stopped right there.  I used the listed amount of all other ingredients, but then added more lemon juice to balance the saltiness.  

I really, really, really wanted to love this recipe, especially after spending $26/pound on sashimi-grade tuna, but the most I can muster is 3 stars after halving the soy sauce.  The recipe should really call for low-sodium soy sauce, or better yet, ponzu sauce.  

I'm trying to eat it because of the amount I spent on the ingredients, and I'm grateful that I was experimenting on my own and not serving it to anyone.  I'm unlikely to make it again.

My husband said this is the best meal I've ever made.  I was shocked. I cook all of the time and he loves my cooking.  I did use 1/4 of low sodium soy sauce.  In addition to that I seared the tuna.  I was not sure if it was sashimi tuna or not.

Delicious!!!,!

I felt this was too salty and even used reduced sodium soy sauce.  I think this recipe is 5 stars if you reduce the soy sauce to 1/8th cup.  Tip, add a little soy sauce, mix, and taste, add more soy if you need it.

This is a great recipe. For those that can't eat soy sauce and want a lower sodium option, Coconut Aminos works great as a substitute. I also added jalapeños and fresh garlic to mine for extra kick and it was great.

RESTAURANT QUALITY APPETIZER!!  This is absolutely the best tuna appetizer I've ever had. I made it for my husband for his birthday and he was blown away. My local store didn't have fresh Ahi so I had to buy frozen & it was still incredible! The second time I made it I drizzled a little spicy mayo on top which also made a beautiful presentation. Its just 2 tablespoons of mayo and add some spicy chili sauce to taste (located in your Asian or ethnic food aisle). I think it would also be good with a wasasbi mayo drizzled on top. Two tablespoons of mayo & mix with prepared wasabi to taste. I took another reviewers advice and served with toasted sesame crackers and it added the perfect crunch to really compliment this dish. Thank so much for sharing!

Love this, and its so easy to make.  I've served it different ways:  in nacho scoop chips, for a one bite appetizer.  I've wrapped them in rice paper with lettuce and schredded carrot.  Also a great topper for a crispy salad.
