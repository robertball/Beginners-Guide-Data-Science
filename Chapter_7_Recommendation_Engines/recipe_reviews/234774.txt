Absolutely amazing!  Tried it twice for football parties and both times everyone loved it.  Used smoked paprika instead of chipotle the first time and it tasted just fine as well.

It really isn't fair to rate this because I changed so much of it to use what I had on hand.  I needed a quick dip to take to a party.  I used mild Italian sausage, cream cheese and sour cream.  I substituted peach mango salsa for the tomatoes.  I added a minced jalape√±o pepper, Asiago cheese and the chipotle powder.  I heated this in a small dip size crock pot.  pretty tasty.  Don;t be afraid to play with ingredients!
