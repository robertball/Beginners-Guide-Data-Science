I had to add another cup of rice because it was runny, like rice soup. But in the end, it was good. I might also add more raisins next time.

I tried this recipe last night adnd it was great.  I'm from CT. And now live in TN.   I have been looking for a recipe since I've moved here that tasted like what we had back home and this is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for sharing this  Reciepe. The only the thing I changed was I couldn't find short grain rice, so I used medium grain and it worked great.

Thank you Pat

I didn't have short grain rice so I used long grain. I also didn't have any cream so I substituted 1 cup coconut milk. I think the key is to use whole milk. This makes for a richer, thicker pudding. I like mine with coconut because that's how I grew up eating it. Other than that, I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe to the "T" and it came out fantastic. It's like the "arroz con leche" I grew up eating. Thank you! This is definitely a keeper!

When I wanted to make this rice pudding I had no milk or cream so I substituted with 11 tablespoons of skim milk powder, 2 3/4 cups water, & a 300 ml tin of evaporated skim milk ( Eagle Brand). Also I doubled the amount of rice to 1 cup. It turned out great. Rich & creamy tasting.
