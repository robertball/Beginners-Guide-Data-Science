EXCELLENT! Made exactly as written, except for using butterscotch chips in place of regular chocolate chips, per hubby's request. So moist and flavorful...loved the addition of the vanilla pudding mix. Buttery, yummy goodness...a defininte keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were really good.  I used butterscotch pudding mix because it's what I had on hand.  Also, I sprinkled butterscotch chips on top.  You could make a lot of variations based on what you have in your pantry.  Cinnamon chips with raisins and pecans would be good or chocolate and peanut butter.

The first time I made this recipe I was just looking for an easy bar cookie with ingredients I had on hand.  This is what I discovered.  This recipe is outstanding on its own but it is so versatile it has to stay in the recipe box.  First time, I saw I had pumpkin spice pudding in my pantry so I traded that out for the vanilla pudding.  2 cups of raisins instead of chocolate chips and a TBS Pumpkin pie spice.  The next time I had butterscotch pudding and used 2 cups of butterscotch chips.  Today I am making them again.  I am not sure what changes I have in store, but even if I don't change it all it will be wonderful. Thank you Cicada77 for sharing such a great recipe.

Awesome flavor, great texture, family loved them!  Changed one thing: used 1 stick butter and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup butter.  Came out great.  Just made second batch with dried cranberries and pecans in lieu of chocolate chips for my non-chocolate friends.  Awesome as well.  Thanks for a great recipe shared!

Love this recipe!! I use whatever kind of pudding mix I have on hand and make lots of variations. My favorite is white chocolate pudding, white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. YUMMMM!  My kids ask me to make these at least twice a month! The original recipe is excellent too!!  I hate hard cookies and bars, these are sooo soft and melt in your mouth even after being stored for several days! Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This makes the house smell amazing. It needed to bake an additional 12-15 minutes to get the middle to set up completely. I have a commercial grade convection oven. I cannot mark down the recipe for that. Every oven is different. I used semi sweet chocolate chunks from Trader Joe's which might be why it required a longer cooking time. The chocolate chunks made this very chocolaty, which was great. I gave it a shake of cinnamon into the batter, other than that, followed the recipe exactly. My men loved this! Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! I didn't have any white sugar on hand, and only a little brown, so I used 1/2c brown sugar and the rest coconut sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour.  Came out great!  My daughter initially complained that they were too crunchy, and my son that they were too chocolatey.  And yet they've been devouring them!

Sorry, but i really count on reviews when i look at recipes here and they're usually right on.  This recipe was a real flop for me, though i followed the directions carefully.  The bars were so gooey and just not cooked through.  I actually put them back in the oven for 15 mins. and they were still gooey!

These are very tasty! I also messed up a little and accidently used  a small box of vanilla pudding instead of the larger 3.25oz box. And although they came out a bit dry, they were still very good! I added 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of raisins. Will definitely make these again. I can't wait to try them with chocolate pudding! Thank you, cicada77!

I messed up a little - but it still worked out great!  I used instant pudding by mistake, but it was too late so I went with it!  I used 2 boxes since they were 1oz or so each, but I did stick with vanilla.  I did have to cook it about 20 more mins than written, fyi.4
The end result not over-powering sweet, the choc chips added to it nicely.  I liked it more the more I ate.The more I ate, the more I liked them :)

The first time I tried this recipe, I forgot the eggs! But it still turned out great. Today I'm making it again but am changing the vanilla flavored pudding mix to a different flavor and adding coconut! Such a versatile recipe! I LOVE it! (So does my family!)

Update: I made this again, but didn't have vanilla pudding so I used banana creme instead. To even it out I added about 1/2 cup or so of peanut butter. Wow! Still amazing! This is probably one of the most versatile recipes EVER! Still love it!

Very easy. Very good. I only had chocolate pudding in hand, worked fine. I used 2 cups old fashioned oats, not quick oats.  Mine took about 30 min, perfect, soft in the center.

Halved the recipe, including the van. pudding mix, only had 1/4c choc chips,  added 3/4c walnuts and used 1c oats. OMG these ARE AMAZING! I'm going to double the vanilla next time, OH YES there WILL BE a NEXT TIME! Thank you!

There's been a next time, 1/2 batch with same mod's as b4 w/Dbl vanilla extract. Oh YEAH!!! This is the recipe going to the camping trip as "adult" energy bars. This is a wonderful recipe for the amazing flavor and versatility!

Delicious!  I followed exact recipe except for 2 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract.   I spayed my 9x13 pyrex with pam and lined the bottom with parchment paper.   Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzle.  So delicious!  Even the picture I included makes you run for a spoon and a glass of milk!

Thought the recipe was great!  Everyone loved it.  Also tried it again using chocolate pudding and peanut butter chips and was also great and the pudding makes it moist but not gooey.

This is a great recipe. I did make a few changes based on what I had in my pantry and they turned out amazing! I used one small box vanilla pudding mix, and one small box of butterscotch mix. Instead of chocolate chips I used a milk chocolate toblerone bar, and a white chocolate bar. I brought these to a get together and they were gone in 10 minutes! Will be making again!

This was good...a little bland, but ok.  I think it would be better substituting half of the chocolate chips with pecans or walnuts, or some other flavor, as other reviewers suggested.  

I mad this exactly according to the recipe.  It was simple!

Excellent recipe, one that we'll use many times.

We did have to bake these longer than the recipe calls for, as several other reviewers mentioned, but it didn't hurt them at all.

These are good, but mine didn't come out gooey, they are actually a little dry and crumbly.  I added raisins in place of the choc chips as I was looking for an oatmeal raisin bar recipe.  I think the raisins must have absorbed some of my liquid.  I will make them again but will boil my raisins before I add them to the batter as I would like them to be gooey.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Delicious 
I have made them as written, and have also substituted the chocolate chips with cranberries & raisins.

Try taking them out at the time the recipe says to, even if they jiggle a lot more in the center than you think they should.  I think the pudding mix makes them set up more as they cool than they average bar.  (I left them in longer in an attempt to make sure the middle wasn't raw, and they're a bit overbaked.  So, they're dry on the edges but still yummy.)

Delish! Added some butterscotch chips and mini m&ms. Subtracted about 1/2 cup of oats. Definitely making again .

These bars are excellent!  I did not have vanilla pudding, so i used butterscotch.  I also did not have quick oats, I used regular oats.  I will make these again and again!  Thank you for sharring the recipe.  Cyrina  Fdl, WI

I messed up and only had lemon pudding mix so I added that then I reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup and added 1 cup of coconut. Pretty good!

I don't generally like bar cookies, but this recipe changed my mind! My entire family LOVED it! I used butterscotch pudding (since that's what was in the pantry) instead of vanilla pudding. They were ooey, gooey, and DELICIOUS! Like so many others have commented, this recipe is very versatile. I'll try it with butterscotch chips next time.

Good, but not a favorite. It bakes in about 35 min - 40 min. I added dried cranberries. A very, very stiff batter, hard to spread in pan.

It really did turn out well. Im attaching a picture if mine. I used toffee chips and just a smidge of cinnamon instead of the chocolate chips. The kids loved it and so did my coworkers!

Made exactly as written...scrumptious!!! Looking forward to trying some different variations, maybe cranberries and white chocolate chips, butterscotch, or peanut butter chips.

A wonderful and flexible cookie bar. I used half quick oats and half old fashioned, half chocolate chips and half butterscotch, because that's what I had on hand. Came out perfect!
