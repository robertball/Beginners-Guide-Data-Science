Super recipe.  I did everything according to recipe and they turned out fine; nice and fluffy.  The next time I used butter instead of lard.  Same result.  One change in shaping - I hate to have to roll out the scraps (Makes the second ones slightly less tender), and also hate to waste anything, so I usually just cut the biscuits with a sharp knife and get square ones instead of round.  I've never had any difficulty caused by doing it this way.

This is a great biscuit recipe! My biscuits turned out fluffy, soft, and flaky. All I changed was substituting out half of the lard and replacing it with butter for more flavor. As with any biscuit recipe, you want to make sure your fat is cold. My lard had been in the freezer and my butter was cold from the fridge. It's also essential that you don't overwork the dough. I found chef john's buttermilk biscuit techniques very useful (the video is on allrecipes).

I've made these twice and everyone who tries them says they're the best biscuits they've ever had. I do use butter (freeze and shred) instead of lard just because that's what I have when I decide to make them. So soft and delicious!

3-15-2016  ~I tried a cast iron biscuit pan for the first time today and I wasn’t entirely pleased with the results so I suspect mastering it and turning out perfect biscuits will be a learning curve for me.  That said, Sadie’s Buttermilk Biscuits was a great recipe to try it out on – it’s obviously a dependable and quite forgiving recipe! Lard is the best for pie crusts in my opinion, but when it comes to biscuits, I like the taste of butter, so I made that substitution.  The biscuits were light and rose tall and fluffy.  They just didn’t brown on the bottom as much as I would have liked, but again, this was my first attempt with this pan.  I have no doubt that made on the cookie sheet I am familiar with, or once I master the cast iron biscuit pan, they’ll be perfect.  The fact that Hubs requested ham sandwiches made with them for his lunch tomorrow is a great testament to them. Update: I believe I have determined my "problem" and it is not with the pan.  The recipe calls for the biscuits to be cut to 1" thickness and I believe this is too thick -  should be 1/2" thick. Also, the dough was a little too wet - start with 1-1/2 cups of buttermilk - you can always add more if necessary.

I substituted butter for lard just cause I didn't have lard.  They came out MAGNIFICENTLY DIVINE!  I paired them with sausage egg and cheese.  My husband wanted to marry me again.  I made sausage gravy for biscuits and gravy.  My kids liked it with honey butter.  I also made strawberries and cream with the biscuits.  Paired it with fried apples and sausage once too.  Very versatile. Thanks a heap!

Great recipe. As another reviewer stated, I normally would use recipes that have high ratings, but I said what da heck, I'm going to try this one and I don't regret it! The biscuits are nice and fluffy...

Perfect!! I added a little melted butter to the tops while baking just to give them that golden brown touch.

Eating one right now right out of the oven, so good w/butter! Very easy, only had the Crisco baking sticks, but that made it even easier to cut in with the pastry blender.  The flavor is great, with a little bit of a crunchy top, baked on stoneware, delish!

This is a very good recipe. The biscuits came out great. I did not change a thing, made them as the recipe stated. I made a second batch and froze them. They freeze well. Baked some out of the freezer this morning and they were perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

These biscuits are amazing! I generally hate when people review after changing a recipe, but I don't think it matters TOO much what  fat you use in this recipe.  I have done it with all shortening, and half shortening and half butter, both with fabulous results.  This is my "go to" biscuit recipe. Thank you!

This fall I set out to teach myself to make buttermilk biscuits. I tried 6 recipes before finding this one and you cannot imagine how excited I was to finally find THE ONE!! I was downright giddy! This recipe is perfect, I followed it almost exactly only using cold butter instead of lard.  I'll never ever use another. I pulsed the dry mixture and cold butter in my food processor and then dumped it into abowl, made a well in the middle and added the buttermilk. After the buttermilk was folded in, I turned it out on my floured counter top and folded about 10 times before rolling and cutting.  I used a pretty large biscuit cutter (maybe 3 inch??) and rolled them out thick,  and had 10 biscuits with just a smidge of scrap. After placing them in my skillet (my skillet could only hold 4 at a time), I buttered the tops and I let them rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes before putting them in the oven. They came out tall and soft and tender and flaky and buttery and just perfect!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I have been trying lots of biscuit recipes for years and finally settled on one that is very similar to this one.  The biscuits were pretty good and my husband and I always each ate 2.
I struck gold with this recipe.  I cut it down to 4 servings and cut the biscuits to 1/2" tall.  These biscuits are light, fluffy, delicious and beautiful.  My husband ate 3 of them!  I was wishing I had made more.  I'm sure it was the cream of tartar that made the difference.

Love this recipe!! Didn't have cream of tartar so I did the white vinegar substitution of 1 tsp of vinegar for every 1/2 tsp of baking soda. Baked on stoneware. So quick and so delicious! I was looking for a good buttermilk biscuit recipe and this was the first one I tried. I don't have to look any farther. Thank you for sharing!

My family gave this a double thumbs up!  I keep trying different biscuit recipes, and this is the one!  I think the cream of tartar adds a wonderful crunch to the outside, while the inside was tender and delish.  As another reviewer commented, I also substituted cold butter for lard and gently worked the dough.  I used a generous amount of flour on my hands and my counter when turning out the dough as it was a bit too wet to work with.  We live at 5,000 feet, and the recipe worked great here.  Thanks for a great recipe, Sadie!

I substituted 1 cup of butter crisco.  These were the bat biscuits I've ever made. If you don't have buttermilk, add 1 TBSP vinegar to 1 cup milk. Stir and let sit for a few minutes.  If you haven't made biscuits, the key is not to over work the dough. The less you do, the fluffier they are.

although a good cook, my biscuits have always been dismal. These were a huge success.  I used half butter  and half lard.  Grating them into the mix made it a breeze, basically almost no mix or knead. cooked on parchment.  wow! what a find.

These are wonderful biscuits! I halved the recipe. I didn't use lard, I used shortening instead. These were nice and light, almost as tasty as my grandmothers. This will be my biscuit recipe now. Thanks! 
I'm glad I tried them. I have a habit of only using the recipes on here that have a high rating And a large amount of reviews. I think I will take chances more so I don't miss out on good ones like this.

THIS IS THE ONE!!!  For years I have had issues making homemade biscuits and I do not know why, so I gave up.  Recently I decided to attempt it again.  I spent hours looking at recipes.  Yesterday I tried one using self rising flour,  butter and buttermilk.  It was okay but it wasn't exactly what I had hoped for.  The taste was a little off and the texture wasn't quite right.  So today I decided to try this recipe and this is DEFINITELY a keeper!!!  I did add just a little extra buttermilk, a splash at a time until I thought the dough looked good.  For me I felt one cup of buttermilk wasn't enough.  I started cutting them an inch thick and accidentally cut some a little thinner as I re-rolled the dough to cut.  I prefer cutting my biscuits under an inch.  Next time I will try 3/4 of an inch and half an inch to see what I like better.  Personally I feel cutting them one inch thick makes them a little more doughy and I felt they could have cooked longer.  For me it's just a matter of getting the right thickness.  But this is my go too recipe.  Comparing using butter vs. lard....lard is the way to go!  And this is the recipe to use.  ;)

I've been looking for some "cathead", buttermilk biscuits to make that tastes like a hole in the wall stop in GA. ChowDog!! They had the best buttermilk biscuits I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. These are pretty dang close to those. What also makes the biscuit are a little runny scrambled eggs, good sausage and sharp chedder cheese(has to be sharp!!). Needless to say, I don't need to eat these often but when you have a craving.....

Best biscuit recipe!!! Followed it exactly. After trying many other recipes over the years using butter and sugar, I have to say that the secret to this recipe's light & fluffy deliciousness is the LARD!!! ...That and as little handling of the dough as possible... Yielded 16 large clouds of scrumptiousness!!

Used butter in place of lard as well as Chef John’s rolling technique. (Roll, fold dough into thirds, roll and repeat two more times) Do not twist biscuit cutter. It seals the dough. If you follow these tips, you will get fluffy, layered biscuits. Next time, I will consider covering with a loose layer of foil and cooking. 1-2 minutes more because mine were still raw dough in the center after 12 minutes. Great recipe!

Made only half the recipe using salted butter and omitted the salt and just formed them into balls and baked.  Wife and kid ate them all! Making full recipe this time so I have a chance to eat one.

This is the best biscuit recipe in the world. I have been searching for years for biscuits like these. My search is over. The only thing I changed was butter flavored Crisco for the lard because I didn't have any lard. Absolutely fabulous!!!!!!!

Fantastic! Soft, fluffy, and great flavor! A great standard recipe to dress up however you wish. Whipped these up last night in about 10 minutes (the oven preheating took longer than mixing these babies up). Minimal kneading, rolled them out, cut into squares and baked on a stoneware sheet.

I made no changes.  Loved the idea of grating the butter.  Kept the handling of the dough down to a minimum.  Takes minutes to make.

I made this today for company with rave reviews!  I did not have any buttermilk, so I added two more teaspoons of cream of tarter and used milk.  This will be the only biscuit recipe I use in the future!

Made no changes, so this is a true rating.  Great recipe!! This is now my go-to recipe for biscuits.  I will next time, however, add a couple tablespoons of sugar.  Even with the inferior flour that I used, these biscuits were nice and fluffy.  Thanks!

Just made these and they were the best I have ever made.  Used butter instead of lard.  Since that is not something I keep around.  The family went nuts over these.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Great recipe! Nice light fluffy biscuits.  I did use cold butter instead of lard and added a touch of lemon juice to the milk.  I think they turned out well but would love to compare the differece myself using the recipe with lard and buttermilk.  Thanks for sharing I sure will use this recipe again and again!

This recipe was a hit with my husband and daughter.  My husband said it was better than store bought.  Easy to make.  Used half butter and half shortening and lemon with milk for the buttermilk.  Batter was a little runny, so added a little more flour.  Yummy!  Definitely will make again.

I left them a little longer in the oven (4 minutes 425 convection). Baking Soda & Cream of Tartar make Baking Powder - curious why the recipe needs all three. ( I used a little extra Baking Powder and everyting was fine. Good tip re keeping the lard in pea size lumps... nice and flakey.

I weigh flour so used exactly 480g of flour, dough came out pretty wet but I pulled it together. It was requested to use a large cutter for big biscuits, so they came out huge. Tasty and filling!

I used half butter and half lard and used chef Johns method of rolling them out.  They rose well and were tasty.  Especially buttered with some rhubarb jam!

made no changes except using frozen grated butter  instead of lard. texture was good, they  could have risen more, but  they were tasteless even after brushing with melted butter.  maybe i will add more salt and a pinch of sugar  next time  or  make them with garlic and shredded cheddar.  they were ok, but  they needed something.

Super delicious! I didn’t have cream of tartar, so I substituted it with white wine vinegar. I also used coconut oil for my lard. My husband and I had biscuits and gravy. These were perfect!!!

Following others suggestions of substituting butter in the place of lard made an excellent biscuit.  These will definitely be a keeper.

I did what some of the others did, ie., half shortening and half butter and it came out great. I also used my judgment on the buttermilk adding enough to make sure that the dough was moist enough.  The biscuits came out spectacular! Definitely would make them again.

My family loves this recipe. I usually use butter in place of the lard. I have also used margarine in a pinch. It always  turns out well!

I made these today, following the recipe to a T and they are fabulous! Would not change a thing. We ate two of them and the rest are in the freezer for us to enjoy in the future, probably smothered in sausage gravy. Y'all, this recipe is perfect as written and the results are delicious. Thank you for my new go-to biscuit recipe.

I made these tonight exactly as the recipe stated.  They were a huge hit with my family and let me tell you they are picky.  We will be using this recipe forever.  When they come out of the oven I melted butter in a saucer and brushed the top of each one three times letting the butter soak in between coats.

OMGA!!! I've tried God-only knows how many different biscuit/scone recipe.  This is it folks.  No need to look further.  You can actually add whatever you want to this recipe - it is THAT versatile.  I substituted butter for  lard, since I don't have any lard in the house, and I used 2 Tbs. lemon juice to before measuring out the milk since I don't keep buttermilk in the fridge either.  My husband compared this recipe to another one I made the same day, and he said "hands down, this is the best you've every made".  So, Patrick, thank you for sharing this recipe, and if your grandmother is still alive and well, giver her a super huge hug and thanks.

I think there is an error in the recipe. Perhaps only 1 tsp of baking powder. I made this with the 4 in the recipe and it wasn’t edible. Will try again with 1 and see how it goes.

Made my first batch ever and I am an old lady..husband scarfed 5 down of these with home made soup today...
The only change made was to use butter because its
flavor is the preferred fat in this house. Thanks!!!

This is a GREAT biscuit. I followed the recipe and also made a few changes. I swapped out the lard for butter. I shredded my butter into my flour mixture. This allowed for better incorporating when the mix receives the milk. I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar. I increased my milk by 1/4 cup. I used a rubber spatula to fold the dough in the bowl. I didn’t kneed the dough at all, I just placed it onto a floured surface and rolled it out. They are light and moist in the center with a great crust. This is now my forever biscuit recipe!!!!! THANK YOU!!!

I have NEVER been able to make a good biscuit, and I have tried!  But these biscuits came out perfect!!  Absolutely perfect!I didn’t have lard, so I grated 1 C of frozen unsalted butter into the dough instead, and TaDa, my first perfect biscuit, and so easy too!  Thanks for the recipe, I’ll be making these again and again.

Instead of lard I used butter Crisco. That was the only change. They came out really quite nice and very tasty. I was curious how they would come out because I am at a high altitude. I followed the instructions and they came out marvelous.

These biscuits were great and super easy to make. My husband is not a big fan of biscuits or bready stuff but he liked these.

I used shortening instead of lard and plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. I just never have buttermilk.

Made these this morning and followed the recipe exactly, they turned out great , excellent texture and flavor. I did find that the dough was pretty wet/sticky and added more flour when I shaped them. I cut them into squares because the dough was sticking to my biscuit cutter when I tried to use it next time I will use a little more flour. Also it may just be my imagination but they looked like they were rising nice and high while baking but a little flatter when they cooled off, not sure what that is about? At any rate they taste wonderful and are tender, will absolutely make again .

I’ve tried many, many biscuit recipes and this one is by far the best!  My kids loved them and they only love Grandma’s homemade southern biscuits, now Mom has a recipe that compares to Grandma’s.

I hadn’t made regular biscuits in awhile, so looked up a recipe to get my proportions and ingredients lined up.  This recipe was perfect!  The only thing I changed was to half the recipe.  The biscuits turned out light, fluffy, flaky, and golden brown on top!  All the things you’d ever want in a biscuit!  Half the recipe makes exactly nine biscuits.

I made these biscuits with no changes or substitution.  They turned out reasonably fluffy and are good.  I was also pleased to get 15 biscuits out if the batch.I would try using butter instead of Crisco next time; the buttery flavor was missing.

I made this with no changes, at first I thought it was too wet,  I used plenty of flour on bench, gave it a few quick turns, cut out 24 perfect rounds and baked for full 15 min. @ 450 
excellent biscuits,  light, tender, even the next day. this will be my go to biscuit from here on.

Halved the recipe.  The dough was a little wet even without the full amount of buttermilk and they took longer than 12 minutes (maybe 17 minutes?) to cook because I made them bigger for ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches but the husband loved them.  Will try again.

Yummy and perfect!  Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Tasted so good I just ate them plain--no butter, honey, or anything.  Made a half recipe; and then froze and grated butter--didn't have any lard.  Started out with 3/4 c. of buttermilk but ended up using a full cup.   Patted out to 3/4 inch thick and cut into 12 squares with a pizza cutter.   Baked at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes on parchment, rotating pan half way through.  Great recipe and will make again, but may add 1 tsp. of sugar next time.  So easy too!

The dough was too sticky, so I added a little more flour. Next time I'll try 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and see how it turns out. The finished product was delicious, light and fluffy.  I recently bought a Canvas Pastry Cloth and Rolling Pin Cover and it makes kneading and rolling so much easier and I bought a 1/2" square dowel 3' ft long from Home Depot. Cut it in half and you have a cheap, easy 1/2" guide for rolling the dough.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful...best buttermilk biscuit ever! I too had no lard or shortening so substituted very cold better and they were divine.  I cut the recipe down for the two of us, but will make a full recipe next time so we can have some with breakfast. I baked using parchment..easy clean up. I loved the crunch!

I've made this recipie several times since finding it. I've made a lot of different biscuit recipes in my life, eaten a lot of restaurant biscuits in my life. These are really some of the best I've ever had. The only change that I occasionally make is half lard (shortening) half unsalted butter. Thank you so much for sharing this!!

2 28 17 ...http://allrecipes.com/recipe/234033/sadies-buttermilk-biscuits/ ... So, these are good biscuits; very good biscuits.  I love "my usual" recipe ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/85594/kentucky-biscuits/ ... & do mean love.  I tried plenty & decided it was the best buttermilk biscuits I'd tried.  Now, I'm not sure.  Really, I don't know.  :o  These seem to have layers so may be better for filling with sausage, egg, etc.   I can't decide which is better.  I just can't!  :D  I added an additional 2/3c flour to the bowl to help with stickiness.  I'm wondering if a bit more salt & a li'l sugar would take these OTT.  :)  My dough was a bit less than an inch & it made 16 15oz tomatosaucesizecan biscuits.  :)

I had given up on making biscuits until this recipe.   I didn't have lard so I used butter ` instead.  I also watched Chef John's video on how to make biscuits.  It helped me a lot.  They turned out flaky and yummy.  My family loved them.

I used butter instead of lard and sour milk instead of buttermilk. Since the dough was very soft, I made drop biscuits and they were heavenly - soft and light inside and delightfully crisp on the outside. These were the best biscuits I've ever made and I've made thousands in my life. Got rave reviews, too!

Excellent!  I did use the frozen, shredded butter in place of lard.  Like any biscuit-fresh, warm out of the oven is when they are the fluffiest!

Just like I remembered as a kid.  Didn't change a thing!  It's just my husband and I so I froze the leftover cut biscuits.  They cook nicely on the same temp plus a couple extra mins (since they were frozen) or turn your oven off and let them finish up.  Yum!!

My 12 year old daughter made these! We used butter instead of lard and cut the recipe in half because I was short on flour. She rolled them a little too thin, so we would stick to the recipe next time and roll them 1" thick. But they were delicious and so easy to make!

I am on a mission to find a great biscuit recipe. This one is awesome and very close. Definitely needs more butter in my opinion. Next time I will maybe do half lard half butter. Other then that these are close to McDonald's biscuits.

Best biscuit recipe ever. Never used lard before but had it on hand today.  Really light and fluffy texture.

Next time I will add a couple tablespoons of sugar and raisins and try to adapt to make fruit scones.

I tried a few buttermilk biscuit recipes and this one worked out the best for me.  I stuck to the recipe and employed Chef John's tips from his video.  Very light and fluffy biscuits, i might try half butter and half lard next time.  This will be my go to recipe for biscuits now :) The only thing I would like is if the outside was a bit more crispy so I may try with different coatings or baking slightly longer.

I suggest this for all people who are not biscuit fans. It might change your mind like it did mine. 

I read some of the reviews that suggested substituting butter for the lard, and I was grateful for it when I realized my lard was not solid enough at baking time! I used butter this time and the reviews at the table were all positive. I'll make them again with lard and half lard/half butter. Wonderful Recipe. Quick, easy, and delicious!

Awesome recipe.  I use Keifer Milk instead of Buttermilk.  I make them often. Always a hit. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was great! I made the following substitutes: stone ground whole wheat flour,  coconut oil for lard, apple cider vinegar buttermilk. Next time I will slightly reduce the salt.

This was my first attempt in making homemade biscuits.  I didn't have lard so I substituted with butter.  They were the best biscuits I have ever had, my husband ate 4 of them and my kids kept coming back for more!  Goodbye tube refridgerated biscuits, these homemade biscuits will be on the dinner table from now on!

These were amazing! I ate three of them before dinner was ready. The only change I made was to use butter instead of lard. They were rich and flaky. This will definitely be on the table during the holidays. I can't risk making them more often....they are THAT good.

Delicious.  These turned out so good.  I've been looking for a recipe that uses lard and this one turned out to be a keeper. I had only one problem, I used only 1 cup of buttermilk, otherwise it would have been a batter rather than a dough. Not sure why that happened.  Super good recipe!

Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe! Without a doubt the best and lightest and fluffiest biscuits I have ever made in my 50+ years of baking! Absolutely delicious! I didn't have lard and used oil instead.  And I substituted milk with 4 Tb of vinegar for the buttermilk.  This made the dough too sticky and I had to actually add 2 more cups of flour to make it manageable.  However, the results were so spectacular, I'm not going to mess with it any more. When I want to make biscuits this will be my go-to recipe!

These came out great. I just finished making them for breakfast, or use butter instead of lard, unsalted. They didn't rise very tall for me because I might've squished him a little to keep them together and I only made three. Next time I'll make sure to pile them up tall so they bake in a more traditional biscuit shape and not fat cookie.

Very good biscuits! Light and fluffy, delicate texture. I was out of lard, so I used half shortening,  half butter. I'll definitely try them with lard next time, but these were a hit.

Like so many others, I substituted butter for the lard.  I wanted a bigger biscuit but these got so big and fluffy I should have used a smaller tool to cut these as they turned out HUGE (I still ate two because they were so good).  I will use a bigger pan next time with a lip as some of the butter dripped over the edge of my stone sheet so now I'm cleaning my oven (that's ok these are worth it).  Light and fluffy on the inside and just the right amount of crisp on the outside.  Biscuit perfection!  Never again will I cheat and buy the tube.

Just pulled these out of the oven and they are perfect.  Light on the inside with the perfect crispiness on the outside.  I used butter instead of lard and used a previous suggestion of freezing the butter and grating it.  I'll start doing that for a lot of recipes.  It was a breeze.

Oh, wow!  Best biscuits I've ever made - and I've been making buttermilk biscuits for years!  They rose up very high and were quick to prepare.  I substituted 1 cup of  the all purpose flour for 1 cup of multi-grain flour for added texture and used butter instead of lard.  I also had some leftover  grated cheese in the fridge, so threw that in.  Sadie, you rocked this one!

I didn't have lard so I used a stick of butter and 1/2 cup of vegetable shortening.  These biscuits are really wonderful.  Even my 5-year old granddaughter loves them and she's pretty picky.

Amazing!  I loved how soft and fluffy the dough was, so fun to work with and my family devoured them.  I did use butter instead of lard, no lard on hand...extremely happy with these.  Very easy to make!  Definitely a keeper.

I loved this recipe; I would've given it five starts, but I had to make some changes.

1) I cut down the butter to 3/4 cup, because with the full cup of it was too greasy  for my taste.

2) Because the cream of tartar is often hard to find, I took out the cream of tartar and baking soda and instead increased the amount of baking powered to 3tbsp all together.

Hope this helps!  Happy baking! :)

Great!  The only thing I did differently was to use butter instead of lard.   Fantastic.

Okay i have tried only a couple times before to make biscuits and with limited success. This came out perfect for my biscuits and gravy. No more canned biscuits for me.  I did not change a thing.

These are fantastic biscuits we just formed a rectangle and cut sqares instead of making round biscuits.They were the best biscuits I've ever made.

These were easy and delicious!  We didn't have any lard, so we substituted butter.  So soft and fluffy!

I am not a great biscuit maker.. they never turn out well for me. I made this recipe for the first time and they were DELICIOUS, light and flaky! I used half shortning and half butter because that is what I had on hand and they turned out great! I will definitely make these again! Thank you for sharing this delish recipe!
