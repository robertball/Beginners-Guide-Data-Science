This chili has definitely been a favorite everytime that I have made it. However, there are a couple of things that I do a little differently. In addition to the onion and minced garlic, I also chop up one whole jalepeno (seeds and all as my family likes the spice) and saute it. Instead of using 3 cups of salsa, I use 2 cups and replace the third with a can of condensed tomato soup. And lastly, I use beef broth in place of the 1/2 cup of water. It never fails to be completely delicious.

This was a great chili recipe.  Pretty spicy, that was one of the things that made it great.  I will add extra beans and steak next time. Otherwise it was perfect.

As a Texas native, I have to admit that the kidney beans aren't real authentic. Pinto beans give it a real Texas flair. Spices were perfect!

Good tasting chili. I just have to mention one thing. Why all the "Texas" chili recipes with beans? Traditional Texas chili has NO beans or other fillers.
