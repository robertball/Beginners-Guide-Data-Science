This recipe is awsome! I added a bit of pinapple juice with the orange juice. The texture was like sherbet. Overall this smoothie is very fresh and tropical!

I had to add a cup+ of water, as the ingredients kept freezing and seizing up.  Wondering if this was meant to be in the ingredient list in the first place?  Flavor was yummy & tropical once made; just too much work.

I loved this one! I didn't have frozen mango so used fresh and it was fine.

It’s perfect WITHOUT BANANA! I thought the banana took away from the other flavors. But it’s good either way!

I used a small amount of white grape juice because I was out of orange juice.  My husband and I enjoyed it very much.

I didn't have any mango so I made it without and it was great! I also doubled the spinach and halved the banana to cut the sweetness a bit. Sooo good. Definitely making this one again!

This is so delicious, i don't add ice tho, jus the frozen mangos and pineapples. It'll make it's own thickness itself ! The only con, is that the spinach gets stuck in your teeth! Lol, other than that! I make this for my breakfast in the morning helps for weight loss.

Super delicious!  I needed to use extra liquid to keep my blender moving. Not sure the ice is necessary when using frozen pineapple and mango. Thanks for the recipe!

Added more orange juice - it needed more liquid for blending. I eliminated the ice since I was already using frozen ingredients

Delicious and refreshing! My only change was using frozen spinach instead of fresh! My three kids loved it too!

Kids loved it! This is a good basic recipe that can be modified for the items you have on hand. I used a frozen ripe banana, frozen spinach, mixed frozen fruit (mango, pinapple, strawberry), frozen orange juice concentrate. It was like a sorbet when finished. The kids wanted it a tiny bit thinner, so I added apple juice. I did not use ice at all.

My son is a picky eater and I can't get him to eat any fruits and veggies. I decided to make this to see if he at least will give it a try. To my surprise he liked it. This made it to my recipe box.

I added 1/2 cup of Green Goodness and it turned out even better. I tried it again with 1/2 cup of pineapple juice added to make it sweeter and my two year old enjoyed it. Great recipe
