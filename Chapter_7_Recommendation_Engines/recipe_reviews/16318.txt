I was looking for something like the chewy ginger-molasses cookies at Starbucks, and this recipe does the trick. Thank you!

By the way, fresh ginger grates much easier if you freeze it first, and then use a microplane grater.

Excellent cookies. Even my mother liked them and she hates ginger cookies. I used McCormick ground ginger instead of fresh grated ginger and they turned out just fine.

LOVED them!!!

I didnt want to wait the hour for the mixture in the fridge, so I threw it in the freezer for about 10 minutes.  It seemed to work fine to harden the recipe enough to make the dough balls.

Next time, I may cook them for longer in hopes that they will turn out cruncy rather than soft.

I love these cookies!  I have made this recipe about 20 times, so I thought I would share my tips.

1) I use dry ginger, but otherwise follow the recipe to the letter. 

2) Don't add all the flour mixture at once.  Sometimes it doesn't need it all and the dough will be too dry. 

3) The dough, when completed, should be uniform in colour and texture.  You should be able to pick it up with your hands and form it into a large ball without any cracks.  It should also not stick to your fingers.

4) Chilling the dough is paramount.  If the dough is not chilled enough, then the cookies will be too flat, won't form a crispy crust, and won't have the awesome cracks on the top.

5) I use a 1/8 cup measuring thingy to make all my dough balls exactly the same size (crazy?).  They cook for exactly 15 minutes at 350 in my oven.  The middle of each cookie will be raised, but will fall when it cools.

6)I prefer them a couple days old, but my G/F likes then best right from the oven.

I want to add some more detail on the look of the cookie.  Using a 1/8 cup ball, and cooking for 15 minutes, I get a cookie that is just over 1cm thick.  Every cookie has deep cracks (deeper than the picture).  I sprinkle sugar on them when they come out of the oven too.

If you cookie is too flat and lacks cracks, your dough was either too wet, or you didn't chill the dough enough. 

If the cookie has a rounded, puffy top, and the cookie tastes dry, then the dough had too much flour added to it.

Good luck!

Personally,  I loved these cookies. I thought they were really good. I am rating it a four based upon the all-around response I received from family, some of whom thought there was too much ginger. Perhaps decreasing the amount of ginger and a slight increase in molasses would do the trick next time.

This recipe makes flavorful, perfectly chewy cookies.  These were exactly what I was looking for to go with a little hot chocolate or mulled wine on a cold evening.  I also added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg to mine.

This is a favorite now!  The sweet and spice, and that tiny hot kick at the end of a taste are trademarks of this cookie.  Simple enough that my sons (9 and 16 years old) have made it.

*Wow*!  I baked these for a friend, but I just ate one and they are SUPER~!  The recipe is easy, they look pretty, smell good and taste great. Two thumbs up for sure. ps- I used oil instead of butter because she can't have dairy and they came out perfectly.

Here is the thing about these, you will have to make a double batch! I made the first batch just like the recipe and was excited but wanted MORE GINGER! I was making them for the holiday party and wanted them to really stand out. I used the 2 TBL of fresh ginger but also added 1 tsp of dried ginger that comes from a bottle. Also, to add more pep, I added some freshly ground nutmeg to the outside sugar that they are rolled in before baking. There was no stopping them from there! Gone, gone, gone! Repeat: Just they way they are deserves 5 stars, but don't be stingy with the ginger!

It is interesting if you look at all the photos of this cookie how different they all look. Mine came out pretty dark--thing is, because they are dark, it is hard to tell when they are done. The first sheet I put in I thought the cookies were underdone, so I left the second two batches in slightly longer. It turned out when the cookies on the first sheet completely cooled, they were still chewy, but the other cookies left in longer really hardened up and were crispy. I would set the timer for 10 minutes and keep checking them and err on the side of being underdone. Good cookie--I followed the recipe exactly. I thought maybe it would need extra spices, but it didn't. You could probably even up the ginger a bit.

These cookies are very yummy, I personally like a lot of ginger so I doubled the amount of ginger and also added some cinammon, nutmeg and cloves. I never have molasses so I always use honey when I make these.  A very good cookie and you almost don't have to feel guilty because ginger is so good for you!

Ehhh, these are very boring ginger cookies. The ones with cloves, nutmeg, and/or cinnamon (Ina Garten's ultimate ginger cookies, minus the crystallized ginger, if you're not a big ginger fan) are great! These are ok cookies in general, but not good ginger cookies. Texture and other aspects of the cookie are good though.

These cookies are perfect! Soft & chewy with a slight crunch. I rolled 1/2 of the recipe in cinnamon sugar! I made these for my sister who is receiving chemo & radiation, ginger is known for soothing the digestive tract & ease nausea. I hope these help!

This is a very good soft ginger cookie. I did add ground ginger to the sugar I rolled them in and next time I will try adding chopped candied ginger. I love ginger and these are addicting. Everyone who has tasted them loves them.

These had were seriously delicious!  The only changes I made were that I added a little bit more ginger than called for (heaping tablespoons instead of regular, so maybe 1/2 t. extra) and I sprinkled a little extra sugar on top directly after I removed the cookies from the oven.  The recipe was very easy to make.  I was short on time, so I didn't fold the dough together gently; I just mixed it with a regular mixer.  The dough was in my fridge for about four hours instead of one.  I baked the cookies when I got home and they were awesome!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These cookies are awesome!  Exactly what I was looking for.  the only recommendation I would make is to either use light molasses or substitute half of the molasses with corn syrup if you use dark molasses.  Otherwise the cookies have a pretty strong molasses flavor.  This is fine if you like molasses, I just prefer to really be able to taste the ginger.  But however you do it this recipe is excellent!

Absolutely delicious! The fresh ginger wasn't as hard to grate as I had anticipated.  Using fresh ginger vs ground ginger adds A LOT more flavor.  I won't go back to using ground ginger!

YUMMMMY PERFECTION!!!
I followed this recipe exactly as written, and these cookies are the BEST!! Neither my husband, nor I, are that fond of gingersnaps due to the powdered ginger "bite", but the use of fresh ginger in this recipe is fabulous!  We both love these cookies. They've quickly become our favorite. 

My cookies came out the perfect thickness (not too thin, and not too thick -- I hate cakey cookies--blech!), and they were soft, yet not too chewy. Perfect! Thanks for sharing this recipe! I've served these at a few parties, and everyone raves about the cookies and asks me for the recipe. 

TIPS:
Chilling for the 1 hour is crucial, otherwise your cookies will be too thin/crispy. Also, I use about 1.5 tbsp of dough per cookie, and I roll them into "balls". I then roll into the sugar, then I flatten the balls "slightly". If you flatten them too much, you will get a flatter/crispier cookie. I re-sprinkle with some sugar as soon as the cookies come out of the oven. YUM!  Also, if using "blackstrap molasses", I add in about 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp extra sugar into the dough mix, since blackstrap has a bit more bite to it than the other type molasses. To store, I keep the cookies in a metal cookie tin. If left uncovered on a plate, the cookies will harden.

Excellent!! I only had large crystal sugar (organic)- was leary of the results, but it melted fully in the cookies themselves and made for a great "cruch" on the outside (rolled sugar) to offset the softness of the cookie.

Made these for the first time and they were gone in two days. I used a pampered chef cooking stone to bake the cookies and they baked perfectly. Definitely will make again and again.

These were amazing! I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have molasses so I substituted some brown sugar and a little maple syrup. On the sugar coating outside, I used a coarse grain sugar mixed with a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and dried orange peel. It didn't take nearly a cup of sugar to coat the cookies. Highly recommended recipe!

Delicious! I didn't have molasses, so I used honey. I also zested some orange peels into the sugar used for the rolling part. A great combination. I need to improve on the cooking time though--little gooey. But, that's not the recipe but my oven.

These cookies were easy to make and were the perfect texture (crispy and chewy). They're great crowd pleasers. A couple people said they're just like the Starbucks Ginger Molasses cookies. I only had salted butter, so I cut out the salt. I'd like a bit more heat, so next time I'll add a bit more ginger. They also look prettier if you roll them in coarser sugar.

Fantastic cookies. My wife doesn't even like ginger cookies. These were very gingery with a nice chewy texture and they looked pretty too :) I added two tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of allspice. Thanks!

These cookies are fantastic!  I replaced one of the cups of flour with whole wheat flour and they turned out great.  Because I live at a high altitude I adjusted the baking time to 11-12 minutes.  It was perfect.

Really, really, really good. It goes without saying that this is not a recipe for people who don't really like a strong kick of ginger, but if you do, these cookies will disappear in a flash (as they did in my home).

Excellent cookie!  I had some fresh ginger left over from an asian dish I was making and decided to go looking for a cookie recipe.  Very glad I found this one!  I made the cookies slightly larger - I used a 2 tbsp. measuring spoon - and ended up with 2 dozen.  Baked just a bit longer too, about 18 minutes.  They are best after they have cooled, since the flavors don't come out as well when they are fresh out of the oven.  I also used the tip of freezing my ginger before grating on my mircoplaner.  Worked great!

Delicious - chewy and very gingery. Only cooked them 10 minutes and that was just right. If you are not a big ginger fan you may want to cut back a bit, but overall they were wonderful!

Recipe was easy to follow, although I only used about 1/3 C of sugar to roll the balls in and it was enough.  The final product tasted just ok to my husband and I.  It seemed like they were missing something.  Overall, still good.

I made a Gluten Free version, using the same measurements cup for cup with Red Mills' All Purpose Gluten Free Flour. I added 1/4 tsp xantham gum. I also subbed two heaping Tbl of powdered ginger for the fresh and the cookies were amazing! So easy! I should've been making these for years.

I found this to be a great cookie. Although I let the dough sit overnight in the refrigerator. Great flavor, I am very funny about the products I use, I fine unbleached flour makes a huge difference and I go to the Dutch Market (Amish) for eggs. Great recipe and will make it over and over again.

I was looking for a simple, chewy ginger cookie recipe...AND THIS IS IT! They came out in the perfect round cookie shape, perfect golden-brown colour, neat little cookie cracks, and tasted heavenly. The outside was crunchy, but the insides are wonderfully fluffy and soft. The spicy aftertaste was the cherry on top. I love that the ingredients are simple, but uses fresh grated ginger. As I was making the dough, I was initially worried that it was too wet (so I added a few tablespoons of flour), but then let the chilling do the work. Afterwards, it was completely fine. Keeping this one for sure!

These are definitely as advertised being between a molasses cookie and a gingersnap both of which I've made.  I was wanting to make gingersnaps but had fresh ginger to use so I went with this recipe.  I have to admit they aren't what I was looking for but that is my fault not that of the cookies.  They taste almost a little bitter to me.  I got 41 cookies out of the batch and baked them for 12 minutes which almost had them burnt.  The cookies are edible but the jury is out on whether I'd make them again.  Thanks for the recipe though and I'm glad to venture out of my comfort zone.

So disappointed.  Not sure what happened, but they turned out completely flat and very crispy.  Thinking they needed more flour, but very disappointed.

I think I found my family's new favorite cookie! They are the right mix of slightly crunchy and soft. The fresh ginger gives it great flavor without being harsh. The recipe is perfect just as it is, sooo easy to put together, wonderful result, and they look good enough to give as gifts. Note that the dough is soft so the chilling is a necessary step, but I couldn't wait an hour so I put the dough in the freezer for a few minutes and it was fine. Will definitely make again!

I made these cookies for a Christmas party last year and they melted in your mouth!  They didn't last long at the party and my 5 year-old daughter absolutely loved them.  I will make these cookies every holiday  from now on.

THESE ARE THE BEST GINGER COOKIES I HAVE EVER EATEN! I will never use powdered ginger again. I was a little low on molasses, so I supplemented with very dark organic brown sugar. Um um good!

i followed the recipe exactly, and after an hour of sitting in the fridge the dough was still pretty liquidy. it was a pain in the butt to try to get it on the pan. next time i will use butter instead of margarine. however, the cookies taste great!

Wow! incredible cookies. I changed a few things. I used corn syrup (out of molasses) and substituted 1/4 C of the flour with almond flour (trying to use it more). I scraped an entire vanilla bean into the mix. I chopped fresh and candied ginger into supper fine dice (2-3mm). I left out the final roll in sugar. The husband went wild! He made absolutely obscene yummy noises and hoarded the rest of the lot before our son discovered them.

So very delicious!  I upped the grated ginger to 3 TBS and added about a quarter cup of finely chopped candied ginger (use a bit of sugar from the recipe for chopping in the food processor).  For the ginger "trifecta", I added powdered ginger to the sugar used for rolling the balls before baking.  I love the chewy texture and the zing from the ginger and molasses.  This one's a keeper!

Delicious!!! I have tried to make ginger/molasses cookies and they always end up flat, but these were perfect.  Unfortunately I had to do without the molasses on my first batch and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar... still delicious and perfect.

Thank you so much for this great recipe!  What great, soft cookies!  Fresh out of the oven they were chewy on the outside and soft/yummy on the inside.  They keep so well, too!  I didn't even use the fresh ginger, instead I used 1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger and drizzled in extra molasses and they still turned out really wonderfully.

Oh my goodness. This is the best cookie ever. Just chewy enough, not too spicy, not too sweet. I used ground ginger and a dash of cinnamon, but it's still amazing.

Maybe it was me? I used the ground ginger instead of fresh, just because that was what I had on hand. I've never found that it made a difference in cookies before, though. At any rate, my dough was very dry and crumbly - rather like a pie crust is after you cut in the shortning and before you add the water. I was expecting a dough like chocolate chip or sugar cookie dough. It rolled into balls easily enough, and the kids liked the cookies, so I guess that was the most important thing. I'll keep looking for the perfect ginger cookie recipe. Thanks, though!

This was an absolute hit!! I ended up making a second batch within a few days, they were so yummy. 

I have also tried making them without the baking soda (yes it was an accident) and they turn out large and flat and a bit crunchy on the outside, but still taste just as delicious. They also  turn a rich golden brown that way. Just like having a recipe for ginder snaps as well as ginger cookies.

I will be making it (both ways) again very soon.

Great recipe! My daughter picked up a piece of ginger at the grocery store and wondered what it was and what it was used for. We bought it and looked up a cookie recipe using fresh ginger. We had a lot of fun making this one, and eating it, too!

I am not a fan of molasses, so I substituted honey.  This probably made them a little chewier than the cookies most reviewers made, but I love 'em. And the ginger smells wonderful while it is being grated.  Wonderful.

The flavor of these cookies was delicsious.  However, I must have done something wrong, because mine came out more cakey and rounded. they were not flat and chewy like I had hoped.  One small change was I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar instead of just sugar

My husband and I like these cookies - the kids eat them, but they aren't disappearing as quickly as say choc chip cookies.  I like the texture - soft in the middle, crunchier on the edges. I'm not big on sweets, so these are just right for me as they aren't overly sweet or sugary.  This recipe is a keeper.

Delish!  In addition to chopped ginger, I also used a garlic press to crush ginger for the juice (keep the juice, find something else to do with the pulp).  Added a 1/4-ish tsp of chipotle pepper for a little kick.  Last, I also added crushed ginger to the sugar coating.

I've never really baked before and still these turned out great. I doubled the fresh ginger and added an extra teaspoon of dried ground ginger, and I'm very glad I did. Too much sugar though for my taste, and I even could've handled a little less butter.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfect.  On the second batch I baked them for 12 minutes to get them even softer.  The only thing I noticed was how much the flavors mellowed after a day.  To get that just out of the oven taste I just warmed them in a low oven for a few minutes.  They also make a wonderful substitution for graham crackers for a cookie crust.  I use just enough melted butter to keep the crumbs together.  I have also used them in my peach crisp recipe.

Delicious!  Great, fresh ginger flavor.  They are sort of small (they don't spread out while baking).  Very moist and soft while the bottoms were sort of crispy.  We will definitely make these again!

I doubled the recipe.  The dough was marvelous -- to die for. Let me share my comments on the process before I tell you about the final product:

* I did some control trays (ie per recipe) and a few experimentals (using ideas suggested by others in their reviews).  One of the suggestions was to sprinkle water over the cookies before putting in the oven.  This resulted in cookies stuck to the tin and thus broken cookies.  I wouldn't do this if I were you.

* I am not sure what the sugar added at the end (per some suggestions) is supposed to achieve other than adding calories and potential mess when eating.

* I baked mine 10 min @ 150 Celsius on a fan oven (which is equiv to the temp suggested in the recipe).  15 minutes would have burnt my cookies to a crisp.

* My exterior was beautifully cracked, but I am not sure I have achieved the right hardness on the shell of the cookie.

* I am not sure the finished product (or at least 30 minutes out of the oven) is as good as the dough going in. Perhaps the cookies are better the next day??

Instead of rolling the cookies in sugar, I used an old crumbled marzipan dough I had. The almond from the marzipan added a nice flavor with the rest of the cookies.. Will make it again :)

These were awesome!! The only things I changed was that I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, I didn't roll in sugar and I put dough in freezer for about 10 minutes instead of in refrigerator for an hour.

Excellent ginger cookies, just like my Mom used to make when I was small . . . lots of good memories!!  I used half molasses and half honey and I love them this way!  This recipe is a keeper!

Waaaay too sweet and not gingerly enough. I skipped the second cup of sugar (for the roll-over part) and still ended up with cookies that were extremely sweet. Could be the brand of molasses.

These were amazing....really unique flavor!! If you just love ginger these are the cookie for you!  I have to go back now and make several batches for Christmas. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe they were really really fantastic!! I had to use up some ground ginger and they were good so I cannot wait to make them again with some fresh ginger or some crystallized ginger.

I had to use 3/4 cups more flour, and it tasted more like a gingersnap, which I don't like.  Too much moasses.  'm never making this cookie again

I'm not a huge fan of ginger, but I was looking to use up some extra molasses and thought I'd try this recipe.  These are excellent cookies!  I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used ground ginger from the spice rack and they turned out just fine.  I otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and they came out soft, chewy, and delicious!  I think these cookies will make an appearance at a family gathering soon ...

I made these for a cookie exchange and for my husbands work and they were a HUGE hit.  Using the fresh Ginger instead of the powdered or candied makes this recipe fantastic.....I really recomend these cookies.

These were pretty cookies. Made them with ground ginger instead of fresh. Perhaps itd be better if I hadnt done that but they were still good. Just not exceptional.

Great cookies!  I didn't have a good grate for ginger, so I minced the ginger root as finely as I could.  Easy to make!  My wife doesn't even like ginger and she loves these cookies!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I made it for my coworkers and not only did they finish a whole batch (there are only 6 of us), they all wanted the recipe. I really dislike cinnamon and  it's hard to find a ginger cookie that doesn't call for it so thank you!!

I used the extra-dark "robust" molasses, turned out perfect! These are amazing, soft and chewy, with great ginger flavor. My husband couldn't stop eating them, he ate six in one sitting and was using all his willpower not to go back for more. Great recipe!

Substituted honey for the molasses and brown sugar instead of white. Also added one teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon. End result was great! I love the taste but wondering how to make them a little less chewy and more crispy?

These are excellent cookies!  Very easy to make and a nice taste and texture.  Leave them out overnight to get crispy on the outside. And I made them into disks (not balls) and only dipped the top half in the sugar before baking.   Next time I make them I will try less butter - I suspect that they will be just as good with less better.

These cookies were delicious!  Definitely chill the dough thoroughly because as I found, the dough sticks to your hands and is hard to roll if still a little warm.

These cookies have become a regular in our house.  I always freeze some when I make them, and they keep very well this way.  Freezing is the only way I can keep some around, they are eaten as quickly as I make them otherwise. I have stopped going to the effort of grinding fresh ginger for them and use powdered instead, but otherwise follow the recipe as written. I chill the dough well and do not flatten the balls.  I dip the tops in turbano sugar before baking.  They are chewy, flavorful and moist.

Really tasty.  Just a tip...do NOT refrigerate the dough overnight.  Not sure why, but when I did it made the dough not rise.  The second batch I followed the suggestion of putting it in the freezer for just a few minutes instead.  That seemed to work out well.

I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and these still turned out very tasty!  Might be able to even get away with 1/2 cup, since they are rolled in sugar.  Nice flavor of molasses and ginger. Chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

Very good and easy to make. I use even more fresh ginger, and find them delicious and potent, but not overly sweet. The sugar rolling is a must with these, and the courser the better. They last well too, IF they don't get gobbled up right away.

These were great. I baked 1 minute under baking time to make sure it didn't come out crunchy- I like chewy cookies. I added fresh ginger but I added extra, and it was too gingery.

I just made these cookies three days ago and they are quickly disappearing.  I did adjust the time in the oven a bit to just 10 min instead of 15 and they are fully cooked and chewy moist.  Best recipe using fresh ginger that I've tried so far, and I've tried at least 2 others.

Used this recipe for a cookie exchange last year, my grandma (who hates chocolate) snarfed soooo many!  They turned out excellent, and stayed chewy and delicious for about a week.  I followed the recipe exactly, as it was the first time I tried it, and I wouldn't change anything.

I substituted 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup sugar instead of all the sugar. They stayed in mound shapes and were a tiny bit dry...a good coffee or tea cookie. I liked the balance between molasses and ginger. You could taste both, but neither were overwhelming. A wonderful mildly sweet addition to the cookie tin.

These were awesome! Next time I would try a bit less sugar and more ginger if you like a more "gingery" taste. But overall great consistency and flavor! I will definitely make these again.

I thought these cookies were pretty simple to make, and fun at that. They turned out nice and crispy for me and were incredibly delicious!
I made them for my grandma, she doesnt taste much except for ginger and she simply loved these cookies!

I used two teaspoons of ginger instead of fresh ginger and they turned out great. It was kind of weird that some ended up very flat and others very puffed (in the same pan), I think I will mix it more next time.

These didn't work for me. They turned out flat. Good taste though. They turned out more like ginger snaps for me.

They were ok. I liked the flavor of them, but the texture turned out way wrong. When I baked them they flattened out paper thin. Tasted good though.

These cookies are the perfect texture. Just soft enough, yet have a bite to them. A perfect marriage!

This is good but I changed the recipe and added 2 tbspns of instant coffee and also used part brown sugar with the white sugar... gave it a little more kick!

Very nice recipe. Maybe a wee bit dense, however I did add crystallized ginger which added a nice zing. I also really liked the coating of sugar on the cookie.

These turned out great, and this is coming from someone who's only made nestle tollhouse cookies in the past.  I had trouble grating the ginger, and it mostly came out as a pulp, but it seemed to work out fine in the end.    My ginger was also older with dry skin, but the cookies don't taste too gingery.  I'm keeping this recipe!

I have been making these cookies about every month for a year--my family, friends and clients can't get enough! Lately I have been adding the zest of a med/lg orange which is adds a great subtle taste. Watch the baking process, take them out before they begin to fall--will ensure a moist, slightly chewy cookie!

These cookies are divine. The nine people in our household have different taste preferences but all agreed that these are amazing. Firm and chewy, bursting with ginger and molasses. These are definitely going in my recipe box.

On the positive side, I could really taste the butter and they were soft. However, I won't make them again. They were lacking spice and were too cakey.

This is the same recipe that I clipped from First magazine years ago.  The fresh ginger makes the difference.  It sounds like a lot but that's because you're using fresh not powdered.

These cookies were easy to make and absolutely  melt in your mouth!  I love the taste of the fresh ginger in them.  Hint...freeze your ginger root as it makes it easy to grate and keeps it fresh.

A lot of reviews change the recipe. Don’t! Baking is an exact science and if something didn’t seem right following the recipe then you goofed somewhere! This person had this recipe published because it worked as written! Please follow exact! And to help with grating the ginger definitely freeze it as someone else posted!! Great recipe!

I was  very surprised to hear my husband has never had gingersnap cookies, and my four-year-old daughter help me roll them, and to my surprise again, she enjoyed these cookies very much! They are so delicious, and now has become one of my favourite recipes and will make this many many many times again! Thank you for sharing this recipe! Cheers

I think this just might be the tastiest ginger cookies I've ever had. If only it made more than 28 cookies! I have a family of cookie fans and 28 cookies didn't last long. I had to hide a few to try the next day and I'm glad I did. Much better. Crunchy on the outside edges and moist in the middle. The fresh ginger gave them a warm and wonderful flavor. But only 28 cookies! I considered doubling the recipe but I am not strong enough to stir a double batch.

These were SO good!  I was a little nervous about it being too much ginger, but it was not!  If anything, maybe just a touch more.  The ONLY thing I did a little different was roll my dough balls in raw turbinado sugar (instead of white sugar) before putting them on the baking sheet.  This will definitely be my "go to" recipe for ginger cookies!

I have to say I LOVE these cookies. I've made these about a billion times already. They are chewy and can be compared to Subway's cookies texture. When I bake these I add cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. I never really measure the spices or ginger,  but they always taste amazing. These are a must try and I'll tell all my friends about this recipe.

These cookies are seriously to die for! The cook time was spot on at 15 minutes. I used fresh Trader Joes ginger in a tube and the cookies were perfect, with a nice bite! I followed someone else's suggestion of about 1/8 cup of dough per cookies and I got about 30 cookies out of one batch. Will definitely double the next batch. YUM!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I did it with coconut butter (instead of regular butter) and honey (instead of white sugar)
and it was still great! I love allrecipes! Thanks Noel!

We only added 1/2 tsp each ground ginger and  cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp each of ground cloves and allspice.  Best ginger cookie I have ever tasted!!!!!

I made these cookies with fresh ginger. Replaced flour with ground flax and the last 1/4 cup was course ground barley. We eliminated the sugar and replaced butter with coconut oil. Since we didn't use flour no chill time was required. They turned out delicious! Can't wait to make them again. Due to the flax - they did require extra cooking time. They were done after about 25 min.

Not enough ginger and the molasses was overpowering. I did not care for them.

I added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. These have to be the best ginger cookies ever! Thank you! After I rolled the balls into the sugar, I pressed them down slightly with a large fork.  They were chewy and a little crunchy....just how I love them!  These will be made for Christmas and for my co-workers.

I made these for my son for chistmas and he discovered them and ate the whole batch... Im off to make more and find a better hiding place. I added about a third more ginger   and added 1/2  teaspoon of allspice and nutmeg.

These were really easy to make.  I love ginger cookies that have a good ginger punch to them.  I used ground ginger but next time I will use fresh ginger.  I think this will give more flavor..I used brown sugar instead of white, I also added 1/2 tsp cloves and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  They turned out great.  Very soft and chewy.  I will be making these again but with real ginger.  ?

A friend made these, substituting coconut oil for the butter, and raw sugar for the granulated white sugar.  They were the absolute best!!  I took it one step further and substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose flour, and they were outstanding as well, and a little healthier.  Great recipe.  One of my new favs.

(Using raw sugar for the final roll makes the cookies look all sparkly and pretty, with a nice crunch!)

In an attempt to make these a little healthier I replaced half the molasses, 1/8th Cup, with 1/8th Cup of Agave, and I didn't roll them in Sugar. They were superb. Next time I'm going to try replacing some of the Butter with Applesauce.

Great recipe! I didn't have molasses so I melted 1/4 cup brown sugar with some water in the microwave. Came out perfectly! I also coated the dough with course brown sugar which gave an extra crunch.
My one disappointment is that the cookies were more cake-like than the picture indicated, but the flavour was good. I'll add some cinnamon and/or allspice to my next batch. The recipe made 40 cookies!

Delicious and a great remedy for morning sickness. My partner loves them. I added 3+ tablespoons ginger and cooked them for an additional 5 mins.

VERY good!! I took them to a cookie swap & everyone agreed they were the best cookies there.  I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I added 1 Tbsp. of good quality powdered ginger, along with 1 cup of finely chopped (soft) crystalized ginger.  The crystalized ginger "melts" into little gooey bites in the cookie.  Have to add this for sure!!  Over Christmas, I think I made this recipe around 6 times for friends & family requests!

They taste great.  I added some cinnamon, cardamom, and grated orange peel to mine.  I think 15 minutes was too long to cook - not as chewy as I hoped.  Also, as mine cooked, they stayed in the shape of a ball, so I would probably make them a little larger and flatten then a bit before baking.

These are GREAT! In fact too good, can't leave them alone!  I used baker's sugar in the batter and turbinado sugar to roll them for texture/asthetics.

I adore these cookies, I was a little intimidated by the amount of ginger, but I went for it. I'm glad I followed the recipe because they were great. They are going in our Christmas cookie tins this year.

Ummmm...tasty, soft and gingery.  I really like ginger so I amped it up by adding one teaspoon of ground ginger.  These cookies are so easy to make and totally addictive.  Fabulous!

These are exactly as described, right between a molasses and gingersnap cookie.  I think I let mine bake a little too long, because they weren't as chewy as I'd hoped, but I'd definitely use this recipe again for the holidays.  They are GREAT with homemade eggnog too!

Excellent.  I was looking for something sweet to use my fresh ginger and this fit the bill perfectly.  I dipped the dough balls into turbinado sugar before placing on the pan and they had a nice sparkling crunch to them.

I first tried this recipe years ago, and it was such a hit that I've been making these cookies every Christmas ever since! Grating the fresh ginger is kind of a pain, but once I start to see the pile of cookies disappear, it's all worth it.

I have made these for a few years now, they are my families favorite cookie ever! I bake from scratch as a rule and have tried dozens and dozens of cookie recipes, this one is the top of my list. The cookie is amazing, complex with perfectly blended flavors. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent!  A little less molassas next time, maybe, but a very good and super-easy cookie.  Resisted the temptation to flatten the raw cookies with a fork and am glad I did.  Cookies flattened nicely on their own, creating attractive little cracked-tops.

I baked these for 'goodie' day at the office. I got rave reviews for them. I up the ginger a little bit, about half again and watch them closely to not over bake so that they stay soft and chewy. I've tried them with fresh ginger and with powdered. I've found it well worth the effort to grate the ginger as this makes a much tastier cookie.

I am required to make these for family every Christmas season! I found this year that rolling them in white sparkling sugar gives them a beautiful look and actually keeps them from spreading too much while they bake. LOVE these cookies.

These cookies have an amazing simple, fresh flavour.  They bake up to be just the right consistency, slightly soft with mildly crispy edges.

Simply Delicious!!  My husband likes these b/c they are not too hard/crunchy especially the same day the come out of the oven.  If the dough seems sticky too you just try chilling it in between baking batches.  This recipe calls for less flour so the cookie will be softer.

This was a fun change of pace from the usual gingersnaps and molasses cookies.  While I'm very fond of those, these were good and somewhat "lighter" - the fresh ginger really adds a kick without weighing things down, keeping this from being one of the more intense spice cookies.

I'm eating one right now.  Mmmmm.  I love the use of fresh ginger.  They're soft and chewy; not bakery-cakey.  Very yummy.  I need to go get another one!

My family loves this recipe.  I use 3-4tbs of ginger.  It helps that you can find fresh grated ginger in a jar now in most produce sections.  Yum!

These were indeed awsome. Held up great when dipped in milk, and soaked up milk well. 100% delicious. 

Mine didn't go flat in the oven like the one's in the picture, so I started flattening them with a fork before baking. Made them pretty too.

Wonderful cookie that the whole family loved.  I usually don't have much of a sweet tooth and am more than happy eating only one cookie. These are so good that I did not want to stop eating them! This recipe is a definite "keeper."

Wow! What a good cookie! I love the fresh ginger flavour and that, the molasses is not overpowering. I can't keep the cookie jar full of them. They dissappear, straight off the cookie sheets as they come out of the oven.

I made this mostly exactly as written, the only change I made was I didn't have fresh ginger to grate so I used fresh ground ginger that you buy in the jar and keep in the fridge. I cut it down a little because I feel like it is stronger than fresh shaved, but maybe I wouldn't do that again.  The taste was good, maybe a little buttery for my taste but certainly soft and chewy even the next day!  Great combo of molasses and ginger cookie.

Made these many times and they've been great. Has anyone had problems using Splenda though? I made a batch this time, using Nature Something...a Splenda knockoff...and they didn't flatten out (they "cracked", but they were still balls) and they tasted chalky (flavor was right, but they were dry and chalky).

These came out amazing. The first time I made it, I used Country Crock instead of real butter for nutritional reasons. They didn't taste any different but it was very difficult to roll into balls because it kept sticking to my hands so I used spoons. It just took longer so I recommend using actual butter if you want it to be quicker.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I've made these cookies several times - once for a party and they were a huge hit!  I think the fresh ginger makes such a huge difference in the quality and taste.  These are better than any store-bought ginger snaps I've ever had and I love the way they melt in your mouth!  Thanks!

I made these for a birthday party, along with some other, what I would call more "flashy" cookies. These were the first to go and I got so many compliments on them. I loved how soft and chewy they turned out. I can't wait to wow people with these at upcoming holiday parties!
