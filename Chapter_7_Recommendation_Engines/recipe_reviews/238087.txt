First review!! Just going to say that I'm a lazy baker and I didn't have All of the exact ingredients and didn't want to go and buy them . I'm not vegan either but just loved the healthiness of this recipe. In stead of stevia I used 1cup organic brown sugar, corn starch for tapioca start, canola oil for coco oil. With the chia I used 1/2cup coco milk and 1/2 cup water. Added 1/2 cup shredded coco extra. Pecans for walnuts. Regular flour for cashew flour. Finely chopped apples instead of apple sauce. Turned out really good.  it made 16 muffins instead of 12. Next time might add chocolate chips!  Thanks for submitting !

Delicious! I didn't have chia seeds on hand so we used flax seeds, substituted regular all purpose flour for cashew  flour, corn starch for tapioca starch, and maple syrup for stevia.  We also added approx 2/3 cup of dark chocolate chips because chocolate is great :)

These are very good will use for a breakfast muffin I added a little maple syrup and I used rice flour instead of almond. Would like to try with a little almond flour.
