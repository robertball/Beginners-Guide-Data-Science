This is a very good sauce for tortellini.  The only changes I made were to use walnuts instead of pine nuts and to add approximately 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.  The garlic powder definitely improved the sauce.  Initially I wasn't sure which type of sun-dried tomatoes to use.  I decided used dry packed sun-dried tomatoes, next time I will use oil packed sun-dried tomatoes because the dry packed ones stayed very firm and I didn't like that texture.  In the future I will also leave the nuts out of the recipe.  I look forward to making this again.

Five stars plus!  This sauce really fits its name - amazing!  My very Italian household was raving about it.  Like everyone else, we added garlic, the ommission of which was the only flaw of this recipe.  We used sundried tomatoes in oil and I commonly substitue half and half for cream, just to save on fat.  I was a bit concerned about the addition of mozarella, but it worked perfectly.  Smother a bowl of gnocci with this sauce - you will not regret it!

A great recipe that can be made healthier by using low fat evaporated milk, rather than cream.  Evaporated milk has thickness to it, like cream.  I also used less cheese to make it healthier--it surrenders a little bit of taste, but also a lot of calories.  Thanks for the recipe.

This dish is wonderful.  I was trying to find a recipe for one of my favorite meals from a local Italian restaurant, and this was perfect!  I did make a few changes.  I substituted a grated Italian 6-cheese blend (mozzarella, provolone, parmesan, asiago, fontina and romano)for the 1/2 C mozzarella.  I also browned 1/4 lb. of Italian sausage in garlic and added that to the cheese sauce.  The sauce is salty enough, so I did not any additional salt.  Absolutely wonderful!

A really nice recipe, very similar to the kind you can buy in the deli section of your grocery store.  I added a few things to this recipe:  1-chopped onion, 2-gloves chopped garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms (didn't really measure how many I used).  I sauteed them in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  I also did add about 5 large tsp. of tomato paste because I found the sauce needed a kick.  I cut the sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) with kitchen scissors and boiled them in water for about 5 minutes.  This really helped to soften them up, they were not chewy at all.  I also omitted the pine nuts.

I'll be making this one again for sure!

This stuff is great!  Quick too!  We had it over cheese stuffed tortellini and it was sooo good!  I bought sun-dried tomatoes in a jar, drained the oil off and put them in a food processer for a few seconds.  Everyone loved it- and I have picky eaters!  Had a little leftover sauce, so I put it over pasta and it was very good heated up too!  Will make again and again!

This was an excellent, simple recipe, that was quick to make and really dressed up an ordinary weekday dinner. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I improvised a little taking tips from some of the other reviewers, and so didn't use this exact recipe. 

I served it over cheese tortellini and pan seared boneless pork chops.

Details: I used olive oil instead of butter and sauted 1/3 diced onion, 1 chopped garlic clove, sliced fresh white cap mushrooms and maybe 1/2 cup of diced sundried tomatoes packed in oil; then added salt, pepper and about a cup of heavy cream and a tsp. of tomatoe paste.  I left out the mozzerella and parmesean.  It was still delicious!

This recipe made my supper look and taste like it came from a restaurant. Like other reviewers, I removed the pine nuts and added garlic powder. I also bought garlic sausage, removed the meat from its casings and cooked that in a frying pan to serve on top of the pasta. It was absolutely delicious. However, I used 35% cream to make this (not sure what percentage heavy cream is supposed to be) and found it much too fatty. Next time I'll just try using whole milk.

Love this recipe!  Yummy but oh so simple!  One thing I do differently is to chop the tomatoes small/thin and sautee it until tender with some olive oil so its not so rubbery when you eat it. Doing this also infuses the sun dried tomato flavor in the sauce. I like to make this with sun dried tomatoes that are just DRY not in olive oil.  The tomatoes packaged in olive oil give a different taste to it that I am not a very big fan of.  Kind of makes it taste fishy?  I guess thats the best was to describe it.  But anyways great recipe!  I serve this with grilled chicken and pasta cooked al dente!  Yummy... :)

Amazingly good and relatively simple to make.  Love it with gnocchi and extra sun dried tomatoes.  I use half and half instead of heavy cream and olive oil instead of butter to make it a little healthier.

This is wonderful. My boyfriend love the Fresh Market Sun-Dried Tomato Alfredo sauce. Him and I both found this version must tastier. 

A few changes (similar to others comments): 
I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil. I rinsed them with water and patted them dry with a paper towel. I then pulsed them in my food processor to a finely chopped consistency. 
I omitted the pine nuts.
I added garlic powder (very necessary in my opinion) and a pinch of dried basil.
I used half and half instead of whipping cream, and it turned out perfect. 
I used the italian blend cheese.
I also added a bit of tomato paste, I found that the sun dried tomatoes weren't enough flavor for me. 

These changes definitely helped make the sauce. Thanks for the advice all!! Very easy recipe! Is sure to please.

Do NOT listen to the other reviewers that say to add garlic--that essentially makes it an alfredo sauce.  Very quick to throw together.

Delicious! and versatile -- would have been a 5 if the recipe indicated to let it sit a bit before serving -- it was somewhat watery when I served it, but thickened well after the heat was turned off

So very good!!!  I did as others said and added more sun-dried tomatoes and more cheese.  I didn't have mozzerella so I used basil and tomatoe feta cheese along with the parmesan and it was delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is truth in advertising calling this "amazing".  I did make 1 change - I used a bag of Sargento's shredded mozzarella with Sun-dried Tomatoes and Basil only because that's what I happened to have in the house.  Next time, if I just have regular mozzarella, I'm definitely adding some basil.  Served over plain ol' medium sized shells, it was yummy!!!!!!

Excellent recipe.  Used 2% milk because it was all I had, but added  a couple TBSP of reduced fat cream cheese and 1 TBSP flour tot hicken it up.  Also, added minced garlic with butter before I added milk.  Served over gnocchi.....YUM!  Turned out great!  Will use this again for sure.

This was OK as is, but you have to add seasonings because otherwise it was very bland.  To trim some fat and calories I  used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, reduced fat mozzarella cheese and dehydrated sun dried tomatoes which I soaked in warm water to soften them prior to adding to sauce.  The seasonings I added in addition to salt and pepper were minced garlic, basil and parsley.  I skipped the pine nuts as I didn't have any on hand.  The recipe as I modified it actually tasted better over the course of the next few days.

Very easy and divinely delicious.  Unfortunately, with all that fat, this isn't something I will be making very often.  Great recipe to keep in the file if company drops by for dinner though.  The whole family loved it.

A wonderful and easy recipe.  I always have trouble with cream sauces but this one turned out perfect.  It also includes all of my favorite ingredients.  Try it with portabello mushroom ravioli.

Excellent cream sauce.  I made some additions myself: pan fried mushrooms, garlic powder (like someone had suggested), and roasted chicken breast strips.  I also left out pine nuts because i am not a pine nut fan.  It was really yummy.  Gave 4 stars because I made additions.

Not sure what I did wrong, since I followed the directions exactly, but my sauce didn't turn out at all.  The cheese didn't melt into a smooth sauce.  It was just a curdled, inedible mess and we ended up with no dinner.

Fantastic recipe, we added garlic and topped with chopped basil.  We also used bagged sun-dried tomatoes.  Make sure you rehydrate them first to get rid of the chewy consistency.  In the end this tasted like something from a restaurant!

I was really looking forward to this but for some reason the sun-dried tomatoes I bought tasted like raisins! I bought the sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil. So it wasnt very good : ( Other then that the sauce was very easy to make!

I agree, adding a clove of garlic is essential. I used half & half (since I didn't have any cream on hand) and let the sun dried tomatoes sit in the heated sauce for 10 minutes before I warmed it back up & served it. Yum!

My husband, 3 kids and I loved this sauce. I served it over 1 lb fresh cheese tortellini, salad and rotisserie chicken that I picked up from the deli. I made this meal in 20 minutes, and it couldn't be easier. So for that it deserves 5 stars. I omitted pine nuts, and boiled the tomatoes a few minutes. Next time I will try the jarred ones in oil, so that I can cut out the boiling step. I also added a couple cloves of garlic, and some dried basil. I used a mixture of mozzarella and provolone, and that worked just was well. I will also try to find Sargento's shredded mozzarella with Sun-dried Tomatoes and Basil that another reviewer used because that sounds yummy. With only a few minor easy changes it's perfect for my family. 5 stars all the way! Thanks.

This was a bit bland for my family.  Right before I served it, I had my daughter and husband taste it and we all agreed it needed something more.  I ended up adding 1/2 c. of high quality tomato sauce and topping the dish with some Romano cheese and extra pine nuts.

"Amazing" is right! Must use this in combination with the recipe "Chicken Breast Stuffed with Spinach Blue Cheese and Bacon" recipe from this website.  On Chix recipe, first browned Chix in EVOO (no flour), then slit them in the middle, then stuffed them. Must add some garlic salt and salt and pepper to chix and sauce. For Stuffing, used 1/2 cup blue cheese and then some cream cheese. Also eliminated fatty bacon in chix recipe in place of the sauce. Also used 1/2 and 1/2 for sauce instead of heavy cream. Trust me, this is one of the best meals I have EVER made!!! I will make it over and over!!! Sooooo flavorful with this sauce and chicken combined. Poured sauce over cooked egg noodles and on the chicken...it's to die for!!!

This is a great recipe. It took me less than half an hour to make this sauce, just heat up a few ingredients and voila! Making your own home made sauce really couldn't be any easier, and it's so good! The only changes I made, I soaked the sun-dried tomatoes in hot water for a few minutes to soften them up because I like them a little mushy. Also, when I tossed the tomatoes into the sauce I threw in a handful of fresh basil as well. It came out great, I just finished eating some right now and I couldn't wait to rate this recipe. Definitely will become a 'regular'.

This was a bit bland for our taste so I added garlic powder and about an additional 1/2 cup of cheese, (a 4 cheese blend from the grocery deli).  Nice and easy base to work with to suit your individual taste!

Great recipe.  I also added garlic.  But I love pine nuts.  I lightly fried them and the sun dried tomatoes (in their oil) together and then used the fried mixture in the recipe.  Browning the pine nuts gives them a different texture and a nice flavour.

Not bad.  I had to jazz it up a bit though.  I sauteed mushrooms, added extra sun dried tomatoes ( not oil packed - to use the dried ones you need to soak them in boiling water for a few minutes then drain).  a bit of garlic powder and onion salt.  I also added some leftover grilled chicken.  Without all of the add ins the sauce would have been bland.

This recipe is delicious, just like something you would order at a restaurant.  Plus it is quick and easy to make in the amount of time you can cook the pasta.  For some added flavor I add fresh crushed garlic and bacon to the cream sauce.

This was good but not fabulous.  I actually didn't like the mozzarella which I am a melted cheese fan.  Maybe it was my brand of mozzarella but it didn't melt just kind of clumped up and stuck to the tomatoes. I sautéed six cloves of garlic in the butter before adding the cream.  I did half cream and half whole milk, more tomatoes in oil, and a cup of 
thawed and drained frozen chopped spinach, and omitted the nuts because my kids wouldn't eat them.  Overall it is a good flavor.

Great recipe! I made it with Tortelini and everyone was licking their bowls clean.  I didn't have the mozzarella, so I used just fresh grated parmesan and I also added some cayenne pepper for a little kick.  Thanks for sharing! Will be making this again and again.

I chose this recipe to utilize sun-dried tomatoes I had. I would give 4,5 stars for this recipe. My mom loved this so much, for me this sauce was good, but I wasn`t impressed, me dad liked this. As suggested, I used garlic (2 cloves) and I added dried basil and oregano as well that give an extra flavor. I used the sauce over tortellini.

Really great!!! I loved the taste, but it came out a little dry, might have something to do with the cream, since I used the only cream I had in my fridge. Next time I'll follow recipe more strictly.

I made this recipe with what I had on hand as I didnt have time to go to the store. I only ever have skim milk and was out of half and half so I made a rue. I melted the butter and added about 2tbsp of flour. Then I added about a cup and a half of the skim milk. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and some canned diced tomatoes that I mashed up a bit first. I had mozzarella, but only had the canned parmesan cheese and it worked fine. I served it over cheese ravioli with fresh baby spinach. YUM! It turned out very good. I can only imagine how great the full fat recipe is. Thanks for sharing.

This sauce was really good with added garlic and some mushrooms. The only problem I had with it was that the sundried tomatoes were a little tough. I might soak them in hot water first next time. Very tasty.

I had this at a friends house and had to ask for the recipe! It is absolutely decadent! I thought I might try adding some goat cheese and pouring this sauce over cooked boneless chicken for a mediteranean taste.  Wonderful recipe!!! Thanks

This dish was true to its name. Amazing! My husband loves this dish and always asks for me to make it. Sometimes I like to switch it up and add sauteed mushrooms and roasted red peppers to it as well.

This sauce was just ok. I sliced some baked chicken breasts and added to the sauce and pasta to make it more hearty.  I served with tortellini - it wasn't bad for an ordinary dinner but not amazing/on par for a dinner with company.  If I make this again I'll add some pesto to balance out the sun dried tomatoes, again add chicken and maybe serve it with a fettuccine or something.  I'll update if that improves the dish.

This is really good. I leave out the sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts and serve over pasta with broccoli and chicken.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I added onion and garlic, per another suggestion, and that was great. Next time I'd like to add mushrooms as well. We can't wait to impress our guests with this easy and yummy dish.

Really good -- Sargento has a Sun-dried Tomato & Basil blend of Mozerella Cheese out and I used that.  Nice addition to a great recipe.

Not bad - I thought it was a bit thin, so I added more cheese, and it definitely needed some garlic - not sure how uch I used, just added powder to taste.

Oh wow....I was totally unprepared for how wonderfully tasty this was!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added some sauteed garlic and onion. I also added a little parsley.  I made it as a sauce for cheese tortellini and we all loved it. I can't wait to make this again!!! I can't believe it's so quick; tastes way too good to take less than 15 minutes to make. Thanks so much!!

Really tasty with the addition of basil. Creamy and tasty. I used mac noodles, but probably would have been better with fettuccine (sp) or what other's have recommended. Oh and I boiled the dried tomatoes so they'd be softer.

So easy, and so delicious!  I made it just according to the recipe the first time and loved it, and then when company came I used penne pasta, added grilled chicken, artichoke hearts and sliced mushrooms.  It was a hit.

Delicious!  I used lowfat evaporated milk instead of cream, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think I'll use even more sundried tomatoes next time.  They add so much delicious flavor!

I judge my recipes on whether I would make it again or not.  This is a NOT.   I substituted half and half instead of  heavy cream and used 2T butter and 1T margarine, so if you want to make it light - don't do what I did.  Go for the fat version, as written.

Very Nice!  I have made this a few times and it is a BIG HIT!  You must add garlic salt or garlic.  I also added fresh mushrooms and it was very good!   The 1st time I made it with half and half and that was great.  Another time I tried to make it with milk and it was too runny. Thank you for sharing this YUMMY Recipe!  My family thanks you as well!

Outstanding!  Because I was making this quickly, I didn't add nuts at all. I did add garlic and thinned it a little with extra whole milk.  This sauce covered an entire 12oz. bag of pasta.  I topped it with shrimp.

Wonderful!  I was out of Parmesan but I knew I was going to need some flavor so I subbed the same amount of capers for the saltiness/nutiness.  Also, I added minced garlic, crushed basil, and a dash of cayenne. Bon apetit! :)

This recipe is awesome, but do not cheap out on the sun dried tomatoes.  I did once and it was not good at all.  The brand I do like is Mediterranean Organics sun dried tomatoes in olive oil.

Dieters beware!! This dish is not low on calories or fat and it is reserved for very special occasions. On that note, it is absolutely divine! I would suggest tripling the sun-dried tomatoes, and you can use all grated parmesan if that is all you have and it still turns out great. I usually cook some chicken in a little bitt of olive oil and then make the sauce and add the chicken back in and toss with some pasta....perfect!

This was sooo easy to make!! My family loved it!  My husband does not like tortellini (which I didn't know, until after I made this), but he loved it in this!  He rated it a 4.5!  I didn't put the pine nuts on.  I used the refrigerated cheese tortellini.  I will make again!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I did add some chopped grilled chicken and fresh mushrooms to the recipe just because I love both and they were a great addition.  I have made this many times and my family loves too!

This recipe lives up to its name; it really was amazing!  I made a few modifications, as suggested by other readers.  I started with sauted shallots and garlic, to which I added the cream and butter.  I also added some red pepper flakes, omitted the nuts and added peas and shrimp to finish.  I served the sauce over Trader Joe's artichoke tortellinis and it was a BIG hit.

simply amazing!!! I used the sun-dried tomatoes that weren't in oil and boiled them so they weren't as chewy. I think next time I would definitely get the ones in oil but other than that it was amazing!!!!!

The base of this recipe is really good!  I added things to make it more substantial.  First, I sautéed a chopped onion and sliced portabella mushrooms in margarine.  I also grilled 3 or 4 chicken breasts and chopped them up.  I added all this to the sauce!  I also suggest using more cheese & sun dried tomato than called for.  I used parmesan & also an Italian blend shredded cheese. I used 4 cups 1/2 and 1/2... increasing everything else by 4.  It made a big pot that fed about 12 adults.  Everyone asked for the recipe....

Great and simple recipe! The added pine nuts completed the sauce. I made this for my parents to go with gnocchi - big hit.

This was fairly good. I used fat free half n half instead of cream, to make healthier. Didnt use mozzarella, but reggiano....Then I added sauteed garlic and cooked all together, then I poured in blender and pureed to a creamy sauce. Will use again!

Sorry, we tried this and found it bland.  Needs something to liven it up...maybe use this as a base and add capers or olives?

I liked this recipe and it was very easy. The sauce didn't have quite enough flavor for me, though, even after adding extra salt, pepper, cheese and tomato. Next time I might try it with all shredded parmesan.

Came out ok, but I made a few mistakes - purchased the ingredients from memory and ended up with half and half instead of heavy cream, so my sauce came out a bit gloppy once I added the cheese.  Great flavor though, I omitted the pine nuts which I think was another mistake.  I would definitely make this recipe again and try to get it right.

Yummy!!!!
Followed the directions exactly and it was excellent.  I have now made it several times and my family loves it.  And I recently made this with cheese tortellini for out of town guests and they thought it was divine.  Highly recomend!!!!

I tried this recipe last night and it was absolutely WONDERFUL!  I left out the pine nuts since I didn't have them handy.  I was cooking for a crowd, so I doubled the sauce recipe which covered an entire box of Penne.  I also added chicken, and chopped fresh basil. Served with a spinach caprese salad and bread.  Super easy to make!

This is wonderful.  I made it exactly as described, except I substituted the heavy cream with half and half.  (I used oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed well) Served with salad and bread, it's a super-easy meal fit for guests.  Thanks!

Great Recipe! I'm new to cooking and it was very easy for me to make, the only change I would make is to add a little less cheese, but other wise this was a great recipe, very tasty.

this was pretty good with a few additions. I sauteed mushrooms in the sundried tomato oil and added it to this sauce. I also added chicken and served over fussil pasta. Next time I think I will skip the pasta and just serve over thin cut chicken cutlets. I will definetly make this again.

I sauted chicken, then added the other ingredients per the recipe.  I think it needs some umph somewhere.  But the kids loved it because it didn't have anything fancy about it.  I will try it again.

Had a Tuscan ravioli recipe that used jar sun dried tomato Alfredo sauce in it. Why buy when you can make fresh. So this recipe sounded perfect.  I debated on adding garlic but was adding other ingredients to this sauce to make my dish so I did not. My spinach cheese ravioli dish was amazing. This sauce is delicious as is but is versatile - you can add roasted mushrooms, vegetables, meats and maybe some seafood but you want to be careful not to hide the delicate seafood under too much sauce. I left out the nuts but they would be super in it. Thanks for a great recipe by itself and allows for the imagination to take over with extras added

This sauce is great.  I used it to go with the Mushroom and Mascarpone Ravioli (also found on this site) and they paired up perfectly!  I'll be using this sauce again and again.

It was very good, easy to make.  We put it on salmon.  The sundried tomatoes you choose are the most important part for the flavor the dish.

I used this as a sauce on mini ravioli. It was awesome! I did as others and added some garlic powder, and I used sun dried tomatoes that had been marinated in olive oil and Italian seasonings. I think that made it even better, although I've not tried it with plain sun dried tomatoes..... This made enough sauce to serve 6.

This is the easiest, tastiest meal. My kids and hubby love it. The first time we had it was for Christmas and it was a major hit. I make it then put it in a crock pot on low till we are ready to eat. Then just put it on top of pasta. I add chicken and garlic to it also. We LOVE this dish!!!

Fantastic!  Like some other reviewers, I used half & half instead of heavy cream and I added a tablespoon of garlic, too.  I didn't have mozzarella cheese so used cheddar, omitted the nuts too.  It was delicious!  I could easily see adding more veggies to the sauce next time, too!  Love!

This was a great recipe as written.  Tried it the first time as written and DH love it.  The 2nd time I added peas and leftover ham after the sauce was done and warmed it through.  Served over pasta.  This is a great, easy white sauce that you can dress up or down as you like.
