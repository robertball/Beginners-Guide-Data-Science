This is great!  I doubled the whole recipe (except the butter- I only used 1/2 cup) and thought that the amount of caramel/chocolate/nuts called for was perfect; all the kernels were covered pretty well.  Based on other recipes, one cup of popcorn= one serving, so I used 8 cups of stove-popped popcorn and used the same stockpot to make and mix everything.  I think it would have helped if I had kept the popcorn warm in the oven before mixing it- by the time I got to the chocolate and peanuts, the caramel was sticking.  I baked in two deep aluminum roasting pans.  This made FAR more than eight servings, more like 16!

An addicting, delicious recipe. I made it using 1 cup of popcorn seeds that I microwave-popped. Hint: REMOVE UNPOPPED KERNELS! Keep the roasting pan in the oven while melting the caramel sauce, then take it out and add the popped corn and sauce, this makes it easier to coat the popcorn evenly. Enjoy!

I followed this recipe fairly strictly, except I used 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) rather than 2 sticks.  I ran out of brown sugar so I used about 1/2 cup brown sugar ,  1/2 cup regular white sugar, and it seemed to be no different.  Go sparingly on the chocolate chips---I "eyeballed" it and ended up making the popcorn a little bit too chocolatey, and overcoming some of the caramel taste.  Also, my popcorn started to burn after 45 minutes, so I didn't bake it the full hour.

This popcorn tastes fine, but the chocolate chips do not melt (they scorch instead). I would follow the recipe as is next time, but would melt and drizzle the chocolate at the end. I only baked for 30 minutes because of the chocolate scorching. I've used another caramel/chocolate popcorn recipe from this site, and I think I prefer it with the addition of the almonds and coconut.

Updated to add: I took the leftovers to work and my coworkers devoured it.

Great recipe. I followed exactly, but would do as another review and double the caramel. The popcorn was not as well coated as I would like. Will try again as it had a great taste!!

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have to constantly stir it because it didn't stick to the pan. I used whole almonds for a nuttier crunch and it was great! I had one problem--the nuts and chocolate didn't stick so well. I must have got so excited about stirring the caramel evenly into the popcorn I was letting it cool.

This was realy easy to make and it tastes great.  Be sure to have a HUGE bowl to mix the popcorn in.  I used a wok and it was still too small.  The chocolate didn't melt like I thought it would so I'm not sure what to do about that.  I used 1 cup popcorn kernals and made my popcorn on the stove.

I popped my popcorn on the stove and omitted the almonds and coconut. It was very good!

Even though I made a stupid mistake (added the choc chips to the caramel instead of the popcorn ~ won't leave the laptop in another room again lol) the caramel started to seize up once i tossed the chocolate in it I was still able to spread it around a bit. Then I remembered alot of the reviewers mentioned they doubled the batch of caramel so I quickly made more and added that to the mix already in the bowl. I finished it according to the recipe and even though I nearly screwed it up totally it still came out delicious! I will for sure make this again...just hopefully I'll add the chocolate at the right time then lol

great taste, very easy too make. I found the temp too high.  Also, just the caramel sauce over microwave was a hit with the kids.
