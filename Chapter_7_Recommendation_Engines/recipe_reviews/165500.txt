I think i am the first person reviewing this who has actually done it with soy milk. i used vanilla soy milk and then added the vanilla extract, which gave it a very rich taste that i wasn't sure i liked. next time i used vanilla soy milk i omitted the vanilla extract from the recipe and it tasted really good!

Hot chocolate is one of the things I've missed the most since I stopped eating dairy over a year ago.  So when I found this recipe, I was really excited to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written - except I reduced the salt to a pinch (personal preference).  It was sooooo yummy and creamy and rich.  I will be making this again and again.  Thank you Cymbaline!  Finally I can drink hot chocolate again!

This recipe was really delicious!  We made ours with vegan-friendly chocolate bars broken into bits in place of the cocoa powder and found that the chocolate doesn't separate and sink as quickly, nor as easily, as the powder does.

I used almond milk instead of soy (was just out of soy!) and added about an oz. of good quality chocolate chips, omitted the spices (cinnamon and cayenne).  It's excellent.

I know I can't give this a true rating since I altered the recipe. I used rice milk (also vegan!) instead of soymilk, decreased salt to 1/8 teaspoon, and used 1 tablespoon of agave nectar instead of 3 Tablespoons of sugar.  We omitted the cayenne pepper.  The result: a deep chocolate flavor.  We also put marshmallows on top.

This is very tasy.! I never make changes the first time, but I had to due to my daughter having a soy allergy and also due to running out of cocoa which I thought I had enough of. So, I will tell you what I did in case you find yourself needing to make last minute substitutions like I did. I doubled this recipe for our family of 6 and it made just enough for 4 small mugs and 2 big ones. I used vanilla rice milk, did not add vanilla, just 1/2 tsp of salt instead of doubling, 1T of aguave (anymore sugar or salt would have been too much),  I stuck to one pinch of cinnamon and cayenne and used 3 T of cocoa, and 5T of non dairy chocolate chips, because I ran out of cocoa. I also added a few more chocolate chips to mine and my husband's cups, because I like it VERY rich and chocolately and I felt it needed some more after I poured it. My kids gobbled this up and I am so glad to have a recipe that works for my daughter. Thanks, Cymbaline!

I have made this recipe twice now.  Both times I used milk instead of soy and it turned out excellent.  Definately satisfies my chocolate cravings.

Like the previous reviewer, I made this with actual milk, not soymilk (sorry, I know that defeats the purpose of this recipe). I thought this was pretty good, but next time I would reduce the salt to only a pinch. I didn't even put in the full 1/2 tsp and I though it was pretty salty.

I made this as written except I substituted agave syrup for the white sugar.  It was not very sweet (agave is supposed to be even more sweet than sugar!).  I used unsweetened milk, so maybe this recipe calls for sweetened soy milk??  I still enjoyed it, but my 4-year-old said it was missing something - sugar!  I would probably add 1 extra Tablespoon of agave syrup next time.

Great great great. Very rich, I added a little cold soy to the end product to make it kid friendly.

I'm so bummed to give a bad rating to such a unique recipe and representing the vegans too!  I was really looking forward to this recipe but even following recipe *almost* exactly it turned out bad!  I cut the salt in half just because I hate things salty and alas, still salty!  I even used the original soymilk!  I just don't know what's wrong here and I'll have to try a few changes and see if we can figure something out because this is such a brilliant idea!

Whoa Nelly! Being a self-proclaimed hot chocolate expert, I have to say that this recipe is top-notch.  With or without the cayenne pepper, my roommates and I loved this.  It's rich, frothy, and very decadent.  The only trouble was that I had a hard time separating the clumps of cocoa powder that formed when I put it into the water. Any suggestions for how to remedy this problem?

I wish I had read the comments better, the salt was way too much, couldn't drink it :(  I used sea salt, maybe that was the problem.  Also used Splenda instead of white sugar which worked great ~ I'm sure raw sugar would work as well, making it a better vegan choice for me :o)

I used coconut milk rather than soy. This was really good. I may start experimenting with adding other flavors (hazelnut.)

Yummy and very rich--I had vanilla soy milk so I halved the added vanilla, thought it turned out very well. Even my dad, who wasn't exactly thrilled about it being vegan, thought it was delicious.

I was sitting here in the heat of FLorida, snuggled up with a book when the mentioned Serendipity's in NYC and I got an urge for hot chocolate and just made this recipe.  I only had lite soy as that is what I normally use just for cereal and this is sooo very yummy.  As someone else mentioned, way too much salt, I think I would leave it out or put a pinch in. Next time I will use reg soy so it's creamer.

This was easy and delicious. I think this recipe is perfect. I used unsweetened plain soy milk. For extra fun, I added a bit of peppermint schnapps. I will make this again.

Overall, I thought this was pretty tasty, although too salty.  I cut the salt by half and still thought it was too salty.  I'd recommend reducing the salt to 1/8 tsp.  The cayenne pepper is a nice touch.  Thanks for the recipe!

I mostly looked up this recipe to find the right measurements for basic hot cocoa...last time I tried to wing it it tasted terrible :(  So...the measurements were very helpful and I made several variations.  Real whole milk, a dash of vanilla coffee creamer, a cinnamon stick instead of dash of cinnamon and omitted the cayenne pepper and only a dash of salt.  Basically, we all make our own tweaks to a recipe :)  Turned out great!!

This is NOT vegan, for the record. Vegans don't use refined sugar or table salt or anything processed. Still a good recipe, however. Those of you who think you're vegan because you don't partake in dairy are mistaken, you're vegetarian.

I'd never had soy hot chocolate before and wasn't sure what to expect, but this didn't taste "soy" it just tasted like good hot chocolate.  I cut the soy milk, cocoa, and sugar amounts in half, since I just wanted one serving.  After reading other reviews I sprinkled in only a little bit of salt.  I forgot to halve the vanilla, and never noticed till after I'd finished drinking it.  It was rich and chocolate-y.  Another time I will try melting some chocolate in instead of using cocoa powder, as other reviewers have done.

I didn't like this. It came out a bit salty and bitter. Maybe it is because I used rice milk instead. I followed the rest of the recipe, though. I won't make this again.

It was so easy to make... Did everything  to the exact measure except adding a little more cocoa powder (which did not need it) and cayenne pepper. Still YUMMY...!!

I made it with soy milk, cut the salt to a pinch and omitted the cayenne pepper.  This was perfect on a cold rainy day.  My four-year LOVED it.  No more mixes for us!

I just purchased a soymilk maker and was anxious to make hot chocolate with some of my first batch of milk. This recipe looked great, so I decided to give it a try. I cut the recipe in thirds because I really just wanted a bit. I used just a few grains of salt and omitted the cayenne pepper, since I didn't have any. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I might make it a tad bit sweeter and use stevia. And I will try it with cayenne. I like chocolate bars with a bit of chili, so I imagine I will like it with a bit of kick. All in all, a good, creamy recipe.

This actually turned out pretty good! I made a couple of modifications though. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of soy milk, splenda instead of white sugar and I didnt add cayenne or cinnamon. It was a little salty for my taste buds so next time I wont use any salt. I'm so thrilled to have a recipe that is low in fat and sugar and still taste good!

I used vanilla soy milk as that's what I had on hand so I omitted the vanilla extract as I thought it might be too much.  The result was great.  I'm not that big of a fan of chocolate but I really love this hot chocolate.  It's very easy to whip up a quick mug and it tastes so good.

I used unsweetened plain almond milk, but found it needed a lot more sugar. For a half recipe, I did: 1 1/2 cups of unsweetened almond milk, 2.5 TBL sugar, 1.5 TBL cocoa, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp vanilla, pinch cayenne, pinch cinnamon. I might tweak it again and see how it fares.

Yum. This was my first attempted recipe for homemade hot chocolate and I am so glad I tried it! I took advice from past comments and cut the salt in half. I also didn't have any cayenne so that was omitted. Very delicious stuff though!

I was all out of white sugar, so I used brown sugar instead. Even with the minor adjustment, my hot chocolate was delicious! This will be my new go-to recipe when it's chilly outside.

Not bad at all!  I tweaked it a bit myself: I used unsweetened almond milk, plus a smidge more sugar and left out the cayenne.  Oh, also used only a pinch of salt, due to the reviews about saltiness.  I can finally have hot cocoa on a cold night again!  Thanks for the share!

I couldn't give 5 because I altered it.  I used 1/2 rice milk and 1/2 almond milk (that's what I had -don't do soy).  I also used 1 T cacao powder and 2 T agave (vs cocoa and sugar).  Whisked the ingredients while heating to break up the cacao powder.  It's really good!!

This was quick and easy. I didn't have the pepper so I omitted it. Also I used a bit too much cinnamon but it was tasty regardless. Next time I would mix the cocoa powder with a little bit of water before adding it into the saucepan- no clumps that way.

Holy Grail of Cocoa:  i adore cocoa so much that i drink it year round, cold in the summer.  so when i became vegan i was distraught that every alternative milk i tried tasted terrible with cocoa.  think of it like painting walls with red paint - it seems like a dark color but in fact, it's the sheerest and if you don't use dark primer, it will never look right.  likewise, chocolate seems like an intense flavor but it is easily overwhelmed by anything other than cow's milk, often leaving behind an aftertaste of rope (despite so many recommendations of adding cinnamon/cayenne) or too watery.

finally, in desperation, i tried the very last alternative milk on the market, Pacific Brand's non-dairy OAT milk.  cocoa nirvana at last:  it's creamy enough, doesn't compete with the taste of cocoa and leaves no aftertaste.  i sweeten mine with a PINCH of organic stevia (man, that stuff is potent!).  NOW try all those vegan cocoa recipes!

if you just adore soy milk or some other variety, add all the cocoa to it that you want.  but if what you want is the pure, unadulterated cocoa that God and Mr. Hershey intended, Oat Milk is your ticket to enjoying a true cup of cocoa sans dairy.

I've been making this recipe for at least a year so I thought it was time to write a review. When I went vegan a year ago I was craving some good hot chocolate, and with this recipe, you don't miss a thing in dairy. Creamy and sweet (but not TOO sweet, thankfully), this one is a winner.

Not Vegan! If you substitute raw sugar for white sugar it is though, and makes a decent  hot chocolate :) Regular refined white sugar isn't vegan since charred animal bone is used in the refining process. I would just go ahead and substitute raw sugar and maybe add a bit of agave nectar.

This was a good hot chocolate idea, I'd been looking for a nice way to make cocoa taste good. I altered it for an instant cup - not a saucepan.

Firstly, I'm don't like overly strong chocolate, so my mods were:

1.5 teaspoons cocoa
1.5 teaspoons white sugar (I'd use brown normally)
1/2-3/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
pinch cinnamon
micro pinch of cayenne pepper 


I filled half the cup with boiling water and the rest with soy milk

Very happy with result. It was the closest thing to a hot choc I have tasted so far. I'd never heard of adding cayenne pepper to cocoa, I had to try it - and if you don't over-do it, it adds that tiny bit of warmth. 

Overall, it was a very helpful recipe - I have found a perfect vegan hot choc, so thank you.

I was confused about the white sugar, since this is a vegan recipe and white sugar is not vegan. I used stevia.  I also used coconut milk to avoid possible GMOs in soy milk.

I made this exactly like the recipe stated. It was nicely flavored, but a little sweet for my tastebuds. However, my family really liked it. We've made it since with coconut milk and enjoyed that as well.

This is probably the best "hot chocolate" I've ever made even though it's vegan.  The soy milk I used said it was the original version yet I noticed it listed sugar in the ingredients and it was somewhat sweet.  I used cacao instead of cocoa, cut the salt down to a sprinkle and used agave syrup instead of sugar.  I also used my own homemade vanilla extract.  First I made a slurry with all the dry ingredients by adding the soy milk a little at a time until it was totally smooth, then added the slurry to the heated soy milk with the rest of the ingredients and whisked it all together. 
This completely eliminated any lumps.  Served it up steaming in mugs and it was delicious.  My husband loved it.  The Cayenne sounded weird but it was actually a nice subtle touch.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

Delicious! I prefer almond or cashew milk to soy. I usually substitute the vanilla flavored option and drop the vanilla extract from the recipe.

This is great! Thanks for putting it together.

Just going to mention for those folks out there who aren't used to cooking for vegans: white sugar is a no-go. Just swap it out for raw or cane sugar and your golden.

Too salty. Do a dash of salt and build from there...

I used vanilla unsweetened almond milk, and just a shake of salt based on other reviews. It was ok, but too cocoa-y.  If I make it again, I will use less cocoa.

This hot chocolate tastes very good.  The changes I made: used only a dash of salt and left out the cayenne pepper.  Thank you for the yummy vegan recipe!

This is delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe advises the first time and it was too salty. The second time I only used a pinch of salt and I also added a bit more soy milk and I liked it better this way. The cayenne makes it. Very good recipe.

I made this with almond milk, because that is what I had.  I also used stevia instead of the sugar.  It was fine except for all that salt!  I have no idea why you would put that much salt in this recipe.  I could not drink it, and will try again without the salt, or with just the tiniest pinch.

So good I couldn't wait to review it!  Used almond milk & Hershey's cocoa powder.  I did have trouble getting the milk to saturate the cocoa, so I could have benefited by putting dry ingredients into sauce pan first.  Used an electric whisk to froth it up.  Salt and cinnamon was a nice touch.  Didn't have the pepper so left that out, although I do like the chocolate pepper combo.

I used cashew milk because I can't have soy, but otherwise I followed the rest of the ingredients as written.  I felt it was a bit heavy on the salt (I don't know if that has anything to do with the different milks) so I added another pinch of cinnamon and cayenne.  The end result was delicious!  Nice and spicy...I will definitely be making this one again.

So far, this has been my best attempt at vegan hot chocolate. I followed the instructions pretty much exact- except I might have extra big pinch with the spices and used raw sugar instead of white. I loved the spicy notes and the richness. In the past, I think I made the mistake of using cheap cocoa powder. Don't do this! Just spend the extra money and get the good stuff. It's a treat so you want it to taste decadent.

Great recipe. I dumped all the ingredients into my vita mix and then blended till hot.  It made the hot chocolate nice and frothy. My husband thinks it tastes like chocolate abuelita.  It does not taste like hot chocoalte made with cows milk, but this hot drink is delicious!  Perfect for a snowy day like today.

I liked this recipe, but my family did not. The hot cocoa is pretty rich. I used almondmilk (personal preference).The cayenne gives the cocoa a good little kick, maybe a little too much for my taste. Overall, I'll probably make it again but maybe change the spices a little.

I tweaked this recipe a little bit because I thought 3 tbsp of white sugar was way too much. 1 1/2 tbsps of brown sugar would do! Nonetheless, I enjoyed my cup of hot cocoa. Thank you for this recipe!

The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half since I was just making cocoa for one. I found this recipe to be overly salty though. Definitely cut the salt in half! If you do that I'm sure this would be a delicious hot chocolate recipe.

Very good recipe, although it called for too much sugar and salt for my tastes.  I ended up cutting both by half, and it was delicious!

This recipe is perfect! Requires no tweeking. Super tasty. I prefer to use almond milk as it's the sweetest, but also use rice milk. (I'm not a fan of soy milk).
