very good, will make again.  The first reviewer mentioned that the recipe was to spicy.. don't add cayenne, use a cajun seasoning as the recipe calls for..

I'm from south Louisiana, and this recipe is SPICY!!!!  It was sooooooooo HOT, we couldn't even eat it!  Trust me, DO NOT ADD 2 tsp of cayenne!  Please cut down on it.  It is an absolutely delicious dish, don't get me wrong, just simply too much cayenne.  Next time, we won't be adding but maybe a pinch of cayenne, and maybe a little more cheese.  Hope this review helps yall!

Had a great taste, excellent base recipe. But I couldn't thin out the sauce enough, it was way too thick. I made the mistake of taking out some of the crawfish because I thought it was going to be too much. Oh well, I'll know for next time. Btw, I'm a New Orleans native and I approve this recipe- it's similar to the crawfish fettucine from Copeland's!

This was excellent and I'm not even a big fan of pasta! I did end up needing more half and half to thin the sauce down and more Tony's for seasoning but after that it was perfect! This re-heated the next day well too! If you have leftover crawfish from a boil you should really try this. The boil flavor comes through nicely in this! Definitely a keeper!

I used the leftover tails from our weekend boil, and it was amazing!  I'll definitely make this again.  I used Zatarain's Creole Seasoning, and substituted a can of Rotels for the tomato.  Not too spicy at all--just right!

Love this recipe! I've noticed that it tastes even better when you use leftover crawfish tails from a crawfish boil-they hold the flavor from the boil mix! If you do use just regular frozen tails, I suggest seasoning them separately with a little paprika, garlic powder and onion powder just to provide flavor. Also, Cajun seasoning does not mean cayenne pepper!!! Tony Cachere's works well and you can always make your own-I make Emeril Lagasse's  version and keep it handy at all times! I tend to add a little more cheese and half n half because I'm a "cheese head" and it's extra creamy! You have to try this recipe and add it to your collection! My Louisiana family and all of my Texas friends crave it when we party! Geaux Fettucine!

I tried this recipe today.  It turned out fantastic.  I cut back on the seasoningâ€¦I used only two teaspoons of Cajun Seasoning.  (I used Cajun Shake.)  I also used about 1 1/2# of crawfish.  Before today I had never made crawfish fettuccine.  I usually eat my crawfish boiled or ettouffe' but this was also very good.  We were hosting several couples at my house and they all liked this recipe also.
