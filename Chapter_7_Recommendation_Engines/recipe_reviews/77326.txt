I think the flavor is just ok, not really worthy to go through so many processes. The yam mix actually became so liquidy.(ps I do use condense milk.) When I tried to  spooned it over the plate . It fall aparts. NOt really impressive, sort of embarracing. Next time, I will do the traditional yam (por pimpkin) pie.

I can't believe anyone gave this less than five stars.  Everyone who has tried them absolutely loved them.

Loved it!  My daughter has a wheat allergy which makes finding a yummy gluten-free dessert difficult.  I replaced the all purpose flour with rice flour.  I also added a little of the orange juice along with the rind and cooked the recipe for a few minutes longer than recipe called for.  This was something the entire family loved.
