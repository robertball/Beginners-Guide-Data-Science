I love this. I seriously cannot stand the taste of deer meat at all. I dislike all gamey flavor. But this recipe makes it more than bareable. I actually crave it. Now, when I find out that my husband is bringing home 200lbs of deer meat, I don't cringe. And he likes it because I will actually fix deer for dinner now.

The soy sauce is overpowering. The deer tastes super-salty and super-tart. Perhaps reducing the soy sauce, and even the orange juice, and using something else? This recipe just doesn't do any justice for such a wonderful meat.

The orange juice/orange zest combo is too much for me.

Recipe was perfect-not salty at all. I marinated for approx. 10 hrs and turned the venison every couple of hours. A 1" steak took approx. 15 min. turning once for a medium-well.
