Definitely a keeper.  Made this dip the other night for some company I had.  Let me tell you, it was soooo simple to make, with little ingredients and the taste was yummy.  Everyone kept gobbling it up until there was nothing left to scrape.

Great base recipe... I modified it a bit... I added green onion, bell pepper and garlic while cooking the sausage. I used only one 8oz. cream cheese, and added about 1/2 cup sour cream and about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese... I threw in some jalapenos from a jar, and I used the "chili fixin" rotel...It was AMAZING!!!  I brought home an empty dish!!!

This dip was the first thing to empty at my work function today! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I made it exactly per directions.  It was mildly spicey..perfect for a large group. Next time I'm trying HOT sausage and HOT RoTel. I also made it the night before, refrigerated it and heated in the crock pot at work.  Perfectly simple and easy!

This is a great dip! You can make it very spicy by using spicy sausage and the spicy can of tomatoes with chilis. You can make it milder by using the mild can of tomatoes with chilis. Or you can use any combination of the tomatoes and sausage.  Whenever I make this there is never any left over!

This is easily the best dip I've ever had. The fact that it is so simple makes it second to none. Tomorrow I'm taking it to a pumpkin carving party and it will again be a hit. I used half mild & half hot Rotel to give it a little kick and it's perfect. Do it!!!

I ran out of ideas with all of the sausage I was collecting in my freezer. I came across this one and I tried a bite but being lacto intolerant- I handed over the rest to the bf and his guy friends. they loved it! I used hot italian sausage.

This is so easy and delicious, it is a must at any gathering!  I use 1 & 1/2 pkgs of the low fat cream cheese and it is enough!  (low fat because that is what I happened to have on hand).  My son doesn't like spicy, so sometimes I make it with the mild rotel, and he likes it!

Outstanding!  A friend brought this to a playoff game recently and served it with Stacy's pita chips.  I could NOT stop eating it and ending up getting too full for the chili my husband made :-)  I immediately asked for the recipe and will be keeping it in my "its a keeper" file.  By the way, Jimmy Deans now makes turkey sausage crumbles if you want to save some fat/calories and it still tastes awesome.  Thanks, Emily!

WOW... made this for a UFC party and got rave reviews.  The boys especially liked the sausage. Gives it something extra! I used two 10-oz. cans of the mild Rotel. Served with Frito's big scoops and there was none left at the end of the night. Will make again!

This is awesome stuff!  And as usual, I had to compromise with what I had on hand.  So this is what I used...1-14oz can Hunt's Fire Roasted diced tomatoes, drained and 1-4oz can chopped green chili's undrained.  Turned out delicious!   This is a great recipe and I can't wait to experiment with it, thank you Emily!  I bet this would be great over pasta :)

Very good base recipe.  I used spicy Italian sausage and added some cayenne and diced jalapeno to spice it up some.  I also used a little milk to thin it out some to make it more dipable.  I have also made this with spicy Italian turkey sausage and I liked it just as well and it was a little more health conscious.  Everyone always loves it.  Thanks so much.

To heck with football season.  If I wouldn't drop dead from arteries clogged with cream cheese, I'd eat this dip every day.  I like it with Fritos or Wavy Lays.  One time I even stuffed jalapenos with it.  I like it with extra tomatoes too.  Best dip ever.  Beats regular cheese dip anytime!

This dip is delicious! I add some jalapenos to spice it up, and if I need to stretch it, another package of cream cheese. Wonderful as is or with modifications. After cooking the sausage, I either microwave everything until melted and/or keep it in the crockpot. This will definitely be a regular.

I halved the recipe.  I used a 9.5 oz bag of Jimmy Dean turkey sausage crumbles (delicious and a time saver), a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes and 8 oz light cream cheese.  I threw it all in the crockpot.  What an easy and fast dip.  Delicious!  Noone would guess it took all of 1 minute to make!  Will definitely make this again and again.

I've been making this recipe for awhile and even my picky mother-in-law keeps requesting it.  My only suggestion is to use the Bob Evans Hot and Spicy sausage.  It's really not very hot but adds tons of flavor.  I like to use fritos scoops with it but that's just my preference.

Very tasty. I double it and used 1 regular pork sausage and one 1 pound hot. Served with crackers and chips. Kept it warm in a crockpot. Big office hit!

I L-O-V-E this dip! Everytime we have a potluck at work we have this, and pretty much fight over it.   However...I made it for a New Years get together this year...and nobody touched it. It was really weird...oh well...more for me!

This was just fair. I didn't like the flavor as is, so I threw in some diced jalapenos and a little bit of cheddar cheese to help it along - better, but not outstanding.

My favorite. I could eat this all day if the calories weren't a killer. I use spicy sausage though. I could use Rotel if I wanted it hotter but the spicy sausage is enough for us. This dip was the first to empty at a baby shower I gave and I'm making it for our carry-in at work in a few weeks. Can't wait.

I've been making this for years.  Even my picky 5 year old likes it.  I brown the sausage and then put all the ingredients in the crock pot on low for a few hours until cheese is melted and its warm.    Because we have children I don't make it too hot but I put a can of chilies in the bowl that the kids don't eat for an extra kick.

I used spicy turkey sausage and neufchatel cream cheese to lighten the load. With the spicy sausage, I used tomatoes without the jalapenos. Everyone loved it. This recipe is so simple and amazingly delicious.

Love this dip! Always a huge hit at parties! One time I accidently used the "chili starter" can of tomatoes and chilis. My boyfriend said it turned out even better! "Hot" Italian sausage works really well if you like things on the spicy side.

This is extremely addictive.  You can change the level of spice easily with different sausage as well as different canned tomato with green chilies. Once you start eating, you just can't stop.

I can't find the original poster of this recipe, but I used 1 original roll of Jimmy Deans and one hot. I threw in a half a roll of original Tennessee Pride (only because commenters were suggesting that brand and I like my dishes meaty). Two cans of original Rotel, (one drained and one not) and one brick of Philadelphia cream cheese. It was my first time making this. It was for a Halloween party this past Saturday, I didn't get ANY for myself!!! My crockpot was completely empty. To make matters worse, I DOUBLED the recipe!! Lol

I followed the direction to the T, and it was very bland, even for my omnivorous husband. Wasn't worth the time. May use it as a base recipe, but will add a lot more flavor next time.

In order to make it more waistline friendly, I used Neufchatel cheese and andouille chicken sausage.  I removed the casing from the chicken sausage and browned.  I also added an extra can of Rotel.  Try using the different types of Rotel flavors to give it a varying twist.

What a Wonderful Dip.....I LOVE it!  I didn't make any subs, but I did make a couple adjustments.  I had a 1/2 lb of pork sausage leftover from an earlier recipe so I didn't have a full lb.. So I only used 1 pkg of cream cheese but I did use the entire can of Rotel (Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies).  This gave a great consistency that I liked.  The heat was perfect for me, but if you like it spicier, just add some cayenne.

This was amazing.  I thought it was runny so I added 1 1/2C grated old cheddar cheese and it was perfect.  I needed it spicer so I used hot Italian sausage and chopped up some pickled jalapenos.  I am sure the recipe as is would have been wonderful too. Anyway it was a hit.  This makes a lot which is wonderful, most dips have to be doubled I find.

Used 8oz cream cheese, and 8oz shredded cheddar.  Also added a little crushed red pepper and cayenne for more spice.

This was an ok recipe, but not as good as I had anticipated. I think it would have been better with only one (1) 8 ounce cream cheese vs the two. I even added some shredded cheddar cheese, but still seemed to lack real good flavor. I will try again using only one block cream cheese and maybe hot breakfast sausage.

Made this today and my family gobbled it up.  I only used one pkg of cream cheese since that is what I had on hand, (without adjusting the other ingredients)...and it was just fine.  I think that if I had used another block of cream cheese I would have been able to also add green onions or other add-in's.  This was super simple and delicious, and will definitely make again.

This was easy and delicious.  I think it might have a thicker consistency and be even tastier if it were baked in the oven instead of heated on the stove.

I have actually never tried this recipe with regular sausage.  A friend of mine got the recipe and accidently picked up maple sausage and made the dip with that.  We have been making this "mistake" ever since.  It is a great unexpected flavor that empties the bowl every time!
