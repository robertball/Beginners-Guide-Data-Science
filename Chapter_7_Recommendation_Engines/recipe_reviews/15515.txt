I just made this for Christmas dinner for 8 guests.  All I heard was "WOW!!"  I used a 2-liter bottle of vanilla coke for a 12 pound bone in smoked ham.  I turned the ham over in the roaster every hour or so to evenly distribute the cola juices.  This saved me from having to stay in the kitchen to frequently baste it.  I skipped the step with the paste and additional cooking on a roasting rack.  This ham is very juicy, not salty at all, and very tasty.  When my guests heard how I was making the ham, there was a lot of raised eyebrows.  But when it came time to eat...let's just say I never heard them be soooo silent.  All their skepticism went away with the first bite.  Thank you for posting this recipe and the bellies of my guests thank you!!!!!

I made this ham for my in-laws at Easter this year.  What a terrific idea to add cola in the cooking process!  I did however tweek it a little.  We had 2 half hams that totalled just over 8lbs combined.  I scored the top of both hams and poured 2 cans cola over them.  (Two cans gave me about a half inch in the bottom of my big roast pan.)  I left the lid on and basted about every 15-20 minutes with the cola in the bottom of the ham.  I didn't make the recommended paste for our ham but rather did what I usually do when making a ham.  Mix together 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp dry mustard, 1 tsp yellow mustard, and enough real maple syrup to make a thick "slurry".  The ham was baked in total for 2 hours.  During the last half hour is when I brushed on the maple mixture, with the lid off. My partners scepticism about cola and ham together went away with the first bite he had!  I didn't tell our guests till after they were done that it was basted with cola...my mother and father-in-law had 5 plates between the 2 of them!  The cola was a tasty addition to my old recipe.  Thanks so much!

This recipe really is fantastic.  The ham was so tender.  I did follow the advice of others and omitted the bread crumbs.  The result was a beautiful, slightly carmalized, mustard sauce on the outside of the ham.  Also, I used cherry cola with a few garlic cloves floating in the pan.  I don't even like ham, and I loved this.  Thanks for the great recipe.

the boyfriend wanted cola ham for christmas as they did this often in his hometown in indiana. being from hawaii, i didn't want to get rid of my pinapple glaze. so i just made my pinapple glaze and added a can of cherry coke to the mix and it was really delicious! the addition of coke makes ham very good! give it a try!

I would've given this no stars if i had the choice...sorry!  The "paste" was too thick - even though we added more and more cola to it and it turned into what looked like a mortar!  The ham was dry and the "paste" tasted and smelled very bad.  Won't try that again.  Sorry, but i thought people should know...

The only ingredients I had on hand were cola, brown sugar and pineapple.  So here is my version. Marinate ham(8lbs) in cola overnite in oven bag but do not poke holes in bag until ready to bake. Turn bag a few times throughout the process to insure "even-ness". Drain cola and add pineapple with juice and rub ham with brown sugar. I only added 1/2 the sugar.  The cola is used to tenderize the ham and Boy did it!!!Delicious!!! This was the best Easter ham ever....

I followed this recipe for the first cooking period and in addition to frequent basting, I also turned the ham over hourly.  It still came out a bit dry.  For Aussies or anyone else eating this ham cold on Chrissy day, I'd suggest halving the initial cooking time then going on to the slurry step (minus the bread crumbs).  

The actual flavour was really good though.  The sticky glaze on top was yum-o

Made this for Christmas dinner. The ham itself was fairly nice and moist for the most part, but the paste was wicked thick (and goopey) and did not come out as a glaze, as the recipe mentioned. I was trying to duplicate a recipe a friend did for a baby shower, and while this one was not horrible, it wasn't the greatest cola ham I have ever had...this gets 2 or 2 1/2 "Noms"..."Nom Nom"...

DON'T use Pepsi! Tastes like a Pepsi on ham. We had high hopes for this on Easter weekend, but no one liked it and I was stuck with a ton of leftovers that I had to throw out. Will try again with Vanilla Coke, as that sounds preferable. But, so far, not a big fan.

I will make this recipe again but will skip the paste next time.  I ended up scraping it off.  I think it would have turned out better without the bread crumbs though.

I accidentally purchased a pre-sliced ham from my grocery, and I think that was a bad move... the slices pulled away from each other and it was dry towards the outside.  Next time I will  make sure to buy a ham that has not been sliced.  That said, the rest of the ham was SO moist and had great flavor, and so I will definitely use this cola-basting method again.  I also really liked how the glaze turned out, had great sweet-tangy flavor without being too sweet.  I took other reviewers advice and did not use the breadcrumbs, and I didn't miss them.

Tender and juicy.  A bit sweet, but that is what you expect when you cook with pepsi.  Unlike other reviews, I did not think the ham tasted like pepsi, only the sweetness of it.

I loved this recipe.  My son and husband didn't like the paste as well as I did.  I used a spiral cut ham and loved how the paste and cola seeped into the ham.

I made this tonight and my family just LOVED it!  It reminded us of HoneyBaked hams, but a lot cheaper!  I will definately make this ham again soon.  My only tweak was to use less powdered mustard and no Dijon-style mustard because my husband doesn't like mustard (but he doesn't know about the powdered kind in the recipe).  Thank you for this recipe.

I have been making something similar for years; using ginger ale, adding a small bit of ginger and skipping the bread crumbs.  This recipe turned out good, but family prefers the ginger ale.  thanks for posting.

Wonderfully moist, tender and tasty. I did not make the paste, just basted the ham in cola.  I marinated the ham in 12 oz cola in a plastic oven cooking bag for 2 hours. Threw out the marinade and put fresh cola in a baking pan. Cooked ham at 300d. Ham started to overbrown after 1 hour.  Covered ham with aluminum foil and started basting more frequently.  If I had a pair of turkey lifters, I would have turned the ham over.  Cooked for another 2 hours, lifting the foil and basting every 15 minutes, and it came out very tender.  Second only to a $54 honey baked ham that I once bought at a specialty ham store.

I tried this for christmas and it turned out great.  Nobody knew I used cola and the ham turned out juicy.  I will use this again at easter.  Thanks!

I tried adding more and more cola but I ended up having to scrape the stuff off the ham just to make it edible. Next time I will stick with the cola and brown sugar and leave it at that.

Disappointed. Used a spiral ham which I think was a mistake. Had to cut the cooking  time as ham was drying out.  I felt the glaze didn't.t do anything for the ham. Will not make again

I am lying here.  I did  not make it. I have noticed that a lot of these reviews talk about leaving "the lid on."  Too many people made the slow cooker ham and are writing the reviews for the oven baked cola ham. I will make the slow cooker spiral ham.

Made for family dinner.   Everyone loved it.  Took advice and turned it over every 45 min. Rather than basting.  Did not leave breadcrumbs out but used less than the recipe called for.
Next time will cut breadcrumbs in half.

Cooked this ham last Christmas, didn't do the bread crumbs route didn't sound good to me. But use my dr pepper over my ham and continued the recipe and it turned out good.
