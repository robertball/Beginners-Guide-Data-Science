Happy to be the first to review this and tell you how interesting, different and delicious this was - certainly not like yo mama's or my mama's egg salad.  I really liked it ! (Hubs not so much, I'm afraid, who thought it tasted weird.  Something in it he couldn't put his finger on, he said)  I had no roasted red peppers, but I did have pimiento-stuffed olives and red bell pepper.  Actually, I preferred that combo anyway because this was in need of some texture and crunch - which is why I also added green onion and celery.  Just can't have egg salad without celery.  I thought the curry might be too bold a presence,  but it proved to be very subtle.  There wasn't enough mayonnaise in my view, but I did like that it wasn't overly mayonnaise-y.  Still, it needed some creaminess and adding some heavy cream was the solution.  I enjoyed the blend of all the ingredients, but particularly the olives and capers.  Yvonnelong, this was some awesome good egg salad.

I am a traditional egg salad type of person, but since I love olives and capers I thought I would give this recipe a try. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. It was beautiful in appearance and had an excellent texture. For the red peppers I used roasted  peppers from a jar. At first I thought I wouldn't need salt because of the olives and capers, but it did need a touch. This is definitely a keeper of a recipe and will give variety to those days when a quick and tasty sandwich is in order. My thanks to yvonnelong - you are very creative.

Definitely different. I like to put curry in my egg salad but this seemed to be missing something. I added more curry, my husband though maybe more olives, I thought maybe some dill pickle relish might perk it up. I liked that it wasn't sweet. Will probably try again with some dill pickle relish.

Oh WOW! This is amazing!!  All the flavors I love and one bite! I made it exactly as written. I can’t think of a thing that I would change! I’m on a boiled egg diet and I’m trying to add little things to make it more appealing. Without blowing it. This blew my mind and my taste buds!

this is my all-time favorite  egg salad recipe. The flavors are incredible and it’s so nice to have something a little bit different, with a little bit a kick, and a more sophisticated taste.

Loved it but I did add green onions because I felt it needed a little something.
