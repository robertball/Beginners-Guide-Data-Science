I love bean salad and this was great. I did make a couple of changes though. I only used one third cup of sugar as I don't like it too terribly sweet. I added fresh garlic, the juice of half of a lime, about a cup of a good jarred brushetta and because I didn't have green pepper on hand, I used a small can of green chilies. I'm not big on cilantro or tarragon but added some spices of my choice. I really thought there was too much liquid at first, but after hours of marinating the beans soaked up the liquid perfectly. Yum!

Based on reviews, I too cut the sugar in half when preparing this dish. I probably should have used a lighter oil or less oil, too. The dish was just a tad too oily but still very colorful (I used light red kidney beans), very filling, and very easy. Will feed plenty. Does indeed get better with lots of time in the fridge. A meal all by itself. The dish, as I prepared it, deserved 4.5 stars. Next time, I will tweak the oil and produce a 5-star salad!

I have always kind of liked 3 bean salads, but they were just too strong. When I made this recipe I cut the sugar (I use Splenda) in half and also only used half of the oil. Since we have cilantro and tarragon in the garden I used double the recipe amount of fresh (more could be used to taste)herbs. This is the best 3 bean salad I have ever had. Love it!

This is a great summer dish. It just gets better and better as it sits in the fridge too! I left out the cilantro, onion and bell peppers though, I like it just plain beans. I use cider vinegar instead of red wine and it tasted fine and I think the proportions of oil/sugar/vinegar are just right for my taste. 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard is enough.

Very nice flavor.  I used 1/2 cup of olive oil and still found it to be a little too greasy.  Definitely use less oil than the recipe calls for.

This salad was excellent and I received raves when I served it on Christmas with roast beef.  The leftovers were still tasty days later.  It was EASY to make, with not a lot of chopping.  Next time, I will cut the sugar, vinegar, and oil down to a half cup because it seemed to make to much liquid.

My family RAVED over this bean salad.  We LOVE cilantro!  I used 1/2 cup light olive oil instead of the veg oil and substituted Splenda sweetner for the white sugar.  This was VERY good. The next day I ate some of the leftovers on brown rice for lunch.

Yet ANOTHER winner! I cut the sugar to 1/4 of a cup, used slightly less oil, and omitted the tarragon completely as I can't stand it. Even warm and freshly-made, it is delicious! I can't wait to taste it tomorrow after it's been marinading for a few hours!

This is really a five bean salad because I count the green beans and wax beans as beans too. I love it and it is requested every summer at our beach house getaway. I do make a few adjustments. I prefer romano beans to the black beans for this particular salad. Also, I find the sweet white onions, thinly sliced and slivered, much better than the reds. With those adjustments, for me and my large extended family, it is the absolute PERFECT bean salad. PS - You have to use sugar unless you have people who can't eat it. Sugar subs give it a funny taste.

A tasty salad with a nice variety of flavors and textures.  I modified the recipe by using thawed frozen green beans so they'd be firmer.  The 3/4 cup of sugar made it a little too sweet; next time I'll probably only put in 1/4 cup.  The 3/4 cup of oil made it a bit greasy; next time I'll probably put in just 1/4 cup, and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Celery would probably be a nice addition too.

mmm mmm mmm! I marinated it in a big freezer bag - works better than bowl, just flip the bag to mix a few times throughout the day  & easier to transport to a bbq/potluck I improvised a bit -used 1/2 the sugar -olive oil instead of vegetable oil -added 1 clove garlic -added black pepper -gabonzo beans couldn't find any - used chickpeas maybe thats what they're called here in Canada

I was looking for a Three Bean salad recipe and decided this was the one. I can't find yellow wax beans in my area but I did use, kidneys,cannelinis,northern whites,black beans and garbanzos, I followed others advice and used 1/2 cup each vinegar and olive oil. I only 1/3 cup sugar. This is a great salad and I will make it again.

This salad is fabulous!!!  I have ditched all my other 3-bean recipes in favor of this one... it has received high reviews from all our friends at parties and barbecues.  I changed nothing in the recipe.  Thanks, I love it.

I made this twice - once as written and once with changes that I thought were necessary to make it much better. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added 1 cup of chopped celery, added 1 teaspoon of salt and added 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. The rest I left the same. It came out less sweet and less oily than as written.

I dont even like 3 bean salad, but made this dish for my parents who love it and I tried it and loved it! I never would touch any bean salads before but this is awesome. I used white beans instead of the garbanzo beans and it was really good. My sister who was also a 3 bean hater wants to get the recipe.

This is the best three bean salad I've ever tasted.  I did leave out the green peppers because I felt this salad just didn't need it.  I served it at my Memorial Day get together and it got lots of compliments.

I made this recipe but without Green Beans or Wax Beans (just didn't have them on hand).  I also omitted the cilantro (lol.. I just saw this in the ingredients.. oops) and substituted Dijon Mustard for the dry mustard (didn't have that either).  But even with my minor changes, I know that the recipe was perfect as-is.  The DH didn't really care for it but he doesn't like dishes like this so his opinion doesn't count.. ;)  I could eat this over and over again and for a high fiber/protein, low calorie side dish, I couldn't have asked for more.

Overall, an easy recipe to prepare.  I thought it was pretty good, although there was a lot of sugar in the sauce (probably too much).  I thought the sugar might entice the kids to enjoy some new vegetables, but I had no luck.  The unanimously rejected it.  So, it was an OK adult dish, but not passable as a kid dish.

I have never made a bean salad before, never thought I'd even like one.  I made this one after having a similar one at a friends and it was so delicious!  I used olive oil, and only 3 kinds of beans.  As suggested, I cut the sugar almost in half and it was PERFECT.  My husband and I finished off the whole thing in a few days.

I made this for a company holiday potluck. it made a LOT of bean salad (I should have known, with 5 types of beans!), but about half was eaten, which I think is pretty good since there were a bunch of other salads there. I made this about 2 days in advance and it definitely tasted better the longer it sat in the fridge. I used apple cider vinegar and regular mustard, not dried-just make sure you use about twice as much as dried since it's not as strong. overall, it was pretty good. maybe a bit too onion-y for those who don't like their breath stinking all day ;)

Loved the foundation of this recipe - very colorful, great presentation.  Only a few suggestions - reduce sugar to about 2 or 3 tablespoons and use fresh green and wax beans.  I also used fresh cilantro and added garlic.  Really pleased with the outcome.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy to make.  I screwed up and bought red beans instead of kidney and it still tasted just fine.  You could probably cut the dressing down by a quarter or a half as I was pouring quite a bit of it off the salad after it marinated.

Tasty and easy.  Used Marjoram instead of Tarragon.  Next time won't use as much sugar; it's a bit too sweet when I would rather have it more acid.  Otherwise a great dish.

Pretty good . . .I cut back on the oil (used 1/2 c) and the sugar (also used 1/2 c) and didn't have wax or black beans, so I just doubled the green beans and the kidney beans.  I put this in the fridge yesterday afternoon and just stirred whenever I opened the fridge for anything else; left it in overnight and we tried it for lunch.  Not bad, but we both felt it was missing something--maybe salt?  I added about a teaspoon of kosher salt to the mix and we will try it again after it has had some time to sit.  It was a tad sweet for me, but it's also not too vinegary for hubs, so this is a pretty nice recipe.  I'll see if the salt helps.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my husband because he loves bean salad. He says it has to be one of the best he has ever had! I cut the sugar down and the oil as he doesn't like sweet stuff and it turned out great! Also used fresh herbs and just doubled the amount.

This bean salad was actually pretty good. We only used 1/2 cup each of sugar and oil but it was still a little runny. I think i could have been from the beans, too. make sure you strain out the juice so it's all gone. we left this overnight in the fridge so it was super good. substituted butter beans for garbanzo beans. delicious!

A very tasty dish.  I couldn't find wax beans at my local store so I omitted them.  I also doubled the recipe.  Next time I would use less sugar than called for.  I like things tangy rather than sweet.

I love this bean salad.  I put it all together, let it sit in the fridge for one day and then pour the excess juice off and serve it as a dip with lime tortilla chips.  Makes an amazing, fun & healthy appetizer (of course it is also excellent the regular way, too).

The absolute best-tasting bean salad I've ever made.  Sweet and zesty all at once with great colour.  Gets better the longer it marinades.  I would suggest, if you can, making it 2 to 3 days in advance.

I've tried a lot of three bean salad recipes over the years, and this one definitely tops them all.  I made the recipe as written except that I omitted the cilantro, and I thought it was *so* good!  Definitely a keeper -- thanks for the recipe!

Did not care for this at all. Took to a pot-luck and everyone agreed that it just didn't have much flavour. The cilantro just didn't fit with all the other flavours.

I thought this was a really good bean salad but it had way too much liquid.  I should have cut the liquid by half.  I had to drain before serving.  Nice taste though and guests really enjoyed at my last BBQ.  I would probably add fresh cilantro next time to it give more of a boost, but overall very good!  Will make again with those changes.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I just loved it! I followed the recipe pretty closely making a couple of little changes. I used Splenda instead of sugar and I added a can of drained corn! I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Yummy!

Very good.  I ended up with far more liquid than was necessary.  You could *easily* reduce the liquid portion by 25% and still have enough liquid.  I used granulated fructose in place of sugar and was pleased with how it turned out.  It wasn't as sweet as I expected, though still delicious.  It's a flexible side dish/salad that goes with almost anything.  I served it with "Uglies," another allrecipes submission.  Since so many cans of beans are used in this recipe, it's a good way to clear out some space in your pantry ... using beans that may have been sitting around for a long time.

I prepare this for a soup kitchen and it gets raves.  I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup.  As written, there is more liquid than needed.  Next time I will also reduce the vinegar and oil to 1/2 cup each.

I followed others advice and cut the oil and sugar down, using 1/2 cup oil and 2 and 1/2 tablespoons of the Splenda Naturals sugar/Stevia blend. Everyone loved this salad!  You could probably cut down slightly more on the liquid all together.

I made this as written, only doubled for a bigger batch.  I received many compliments and two people asked to take home some of the leftovers.  I think it tastes great as written.  My kids aren't big bean fans, but they liked this.  There was quite a lot of excess liquid.

This was really good!  The only change I made was reduce the sugar and oil in half and to add a can of fire roasted sweet corn.  I will definitely make this again!

This was a BIG hit at an annual family reunion this past weekend. I did tweek the recipe by omitting the garbanzo beans, tarragon and cilantro. The flavor was delightful and presentation of such a colorful salad was nice too. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make something for a gathering - it's a nice change and makes a great addition to any setting.

I think this recipe has possibilities, but I thought it too moist and soft. Yet, I cut back on oil and sugar. I would eliminate the black beans. I may be at fault and did not allow the dressing to cool longer.

This was a great recipe. Don't gross out, but I made it with Splenda instead of sugar (was on South Beach at the time). Couldn't find canned wax beans, so steamed up some fresh ones instead. My nanny went crazy for it, telling all the neighbors what a great cook I am. Now I've got to keep up with the rumors.

A friend gave me "this" recipe years ago and I lost it when we moved. I was so happy when I ran across it again. This is the BEST bean salad I've ever tasted. The only thing I changed was the amount of oil, I halved it, and I used red bell pepper and a pressed garlic clove. There was lots of juice but I just used a slotted spoon to serve it. Thanks!!!

This is the best - easy to prepare, healthful. My kids, 10 an 11 years old, LOVE IT and often complain if I have not made it in a while. A great Covered Dish idea.

This recipe was almost perfect.  I say almost because upon first taste, it just didn't have the zing I like in a good bean salad.  I added about 2 tablespoons extra sugar and then I added about 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar.  That made it perfect and man oh MAN! this salad gets better and better as the days pass!

Absolutely wonderful!  I made a big batch of it for a moms' weekend getaway.  It kept wonderfully, served a *lot* of people, and received absolutely rave reviews!  In fact, I think the flavor gets even better after it's been around a few days.  I didn't have cilantro and substituted parsley, and it was still wonderful.  Highly recommended!!

This salad is sitting in the fridge right now and I can barely wait until tomorrow to serve it at a party.  It was delicious even when it was still warm! I even got my finicky little sister to eat it and she loved it (great way to get kids to eat veggies). Since I'm out of town, and don't have access to the same goodies we have in the states, I had to adjust a couple things.  I added a can of corn and pinto beans.  I didn't have wax beans,dry mustard or tarragon, but I did use fresh cilantro and Badia Sazon Completa, and it tastes fantastic. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This salad is fantastic. I didn't put in the tarragon due to personal taste, and my red onion was rather large, so I only put in half of it.  I started out with less sugar and oil, tasting as I added more to make sure it didn't get too sweet or oily. By the time I was done, I ended up with the amount the recipe called for. I also used fresh cilantro instead of dried. Served it on July 4th for our BBQ and it was a hit.  Thanks!
