How do I love thee, Poetic Pumpkin Pie? Let me count the pieces we ate. This is a break from my traditional pumpkin pie recipe, and we loved the graham crust and the silky smooth filling. I followed the recipe to the letter, with one small deviation. We couldn't wait for it to cool, so I topped each piece with the whipped cream instead of spreading it over the entire pie. It was nicely set even while still warm. Beautiful texture. We are looking forward to another taste tomorrow. Great recipe!

Like the first reviewer, I'm not a huge pumpkin pie fan but my kids loooove it.  Making this recipe changed that!  I love the variation from traditional pie crust, and the brown sugar whipped cream is just the right topping. Everyone loves whipped cream in every bite!  Can't wait for more recipes from The Gift of Grub!

I just finished mixing this and I am already giving it 5 stars before even baking it.  My changes:  I used 1 cup steamed acorn squash and 1 cup steamed kabocha squash instead of pumpkin.  I love the flavor of both of those squashes more and they are much smaller to deal with and prepare than wrestling a big ol pumpkin.  The acorn squash is lighter in texture than the kabocha, so together the texture is a little different than straight pumpkin.  I also used half the condensed milk as our family doesn't like stuff that's too sweet.  Once I finished mixing, it was plenty sweet for our tastes.  I also used fresh grated ginger and 1 teaspoon prepared pumpkin spice.  I wish I had fresh nutmeg and cinnamon.  It would be out of this world if I had fresh spices.  I think the best part is the lemon zest.  It lifts the heaviness of the filling and gives it this really fresh, light taste.  I felt like the mix tasted just like fresh pumpkin ice cream and I was eating right out of the mixer!!  Can't wait to bake it.  I'm keeping the mix in the fridge overnight to let all the flavors come together.  I think it's going to be a hit!

This is a great tasting recipe. Love it! I did a few things differently... I did put the crust in the freezer to cool off faster like another reviewer. I am allergic to egg whites so I only used the egg yolks by using an egg separator and also adding two measurements of an egg replacer to make up for the loss of egg whites (it was perfect). I also added a little cardamom to the mix. For the whipped cream, I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. Overall, it was wonderful. Everyone loved it. I'll be making this every year. Thank you for this fantastic recipe. :-)

This pie was really good! Kind of a refreshing update to the original pumpkin pie recipe. I took it to my boyfriends family's thanksgiving at it was a hit! Only for me it took about ten minutes longer to cook completely through then stated in the recipe. I also had to cover it with foil so the crust wouldn't burn on the edges. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is a wonderful way to improve pumpkin pie.  I thought it took longer than 2 hours to make.  The pie has to cool before you can do the whipped cream layer, so give yourself time for that.  The pumpkin layer had caramely undertones from the sweetened condensed milk.  It was lovely.

I loved this recipe!!! To make it a bit faster I heated it to 425 initially and put the crust in while it was heating and when the crust was done I put in the freezer to cool it faster.

This Thanksgiving, I used a chocolate graham cracker crust with this recipe and it turned out really good. It's great with coffee, too. The baking instructions took awhile to get right for me though. I would always end up with a soggy center before. This time I let it sit in the oven after the oven turned off, until the oven cooled. It came out perfect.

This was good, but my husband said he prefers the regular type of crust instead of the graham cracker crust.

Quite delicious. My husband has never been a fan of traditional pie crust, so the graham cracker crust made him happy.  Also, we normally use non-dairy whipped topping, so I did add slightly more sugar and vanilla to the whipped cream -- it went over great. Thanks for a great recipe!

The pie overall was really good. The crust started to get burnt and I had to put foil on the dark spots of the crust. The filling of the pie was so good. I followed the recipe but I didn't get a chance to make the whipped topping but the next time I make this pie I am go going to try it.  Would highly recommend this pie for your next Thanksgiving meal!
