I mixed this up just as directed and was so pleased with it I'd do so again in a heartbeat.  This is an absolutely outstanding all-purpose spice blend that will do anything you use it on a favor.  I used it tonight on "Bacon Wrapped Barbecue Shrimp," recipe also from this site, but I won't hesitate to use it on just about anything.  This was truly excellent.

This is a very spicy rub and was on the edge for me; the men in my family all loved it. They are asking for more and again! When I make this again I will definitely cut the cumin wayyyy down. I used this on baby back ribs. I rubbed them down, sealed them in foil and threw them in the fridge for two days. I then threw them into a 350 oven for 2 hours. The meat was so tender it was all but falling off the bone. Great tenderizer! The ribs were good as is but we elected to go ahead and wet them down with barbecue sauce. Old habits die hard. I was a bit heavy handed with the rub and next time will use sparingly. This is a good rub and not your typical sweet, bland seasoning salt. This is an officially awesome rub that separates the men from the boys.

I've made this twice, and its great! I mix all the powders and put it in an extra herb shaker that I've emptied, then shook the rub all over country western pork ribs......let it marinate for a few hours and let it set on the counter for an hour to come up in temperature. Then I steam them for an hour and when I'm ready to go, I grill them with a little sauce on them (I've used both barbecue and caribbean jerk sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings) Both times they came out excellent! I will always have this on hand, especially during grilling season! :)

We rarely grill without it!!  We keep a big container in our spice cabinet.  It gives a sweet spice to steak and pork.  It also darkens the outside which gives it more of a charred look for gas grills.  Sometimes we'll add olive oil to the meat after applying the rub so the flames jump up and sear it.  Wonderful.

I have to agree with other reviewers the cumin taste in this is way too strong.  I halved it and still felt it was over powering.  If I make again I will quarter it.  I also havlved the chili power, but didn't find the rub had much spice so if I use the remaining rub I will add more.  I used the rub on steaks.  They did have a lot of flavor and were tender and juicy, so it has potential if you cut the cumin back.

This is absolutely the best rub I have ever made myself.  I doubled the recipe and use it on every meat I cook.  Not just for grilled meats, I use it on all meats, baked, fried, etc.  The only thing I will do different next time is cut the salt back slightly so I can sprinkle it liberally.  This stuff is GREAT!

We have tried this rub on a pork tenderloin, ribeyes, smoked turkey and a boston butt.  It is great on all of them - I highly recommend it.

I liked it, but it did have too much cumin.  Next time I will put 1/4 the cumin, otherwise the heat and spices were great!

I cut back on the salt and pepper a bit and increased the oregano a bit. We were supposed to grill chicken today but my husband is late today so I had to come up with a substitute. I tossed this rub in a cup of flour and coated my chicken legs in it, then fried it in hot vegetable oil, then baked it to finish it off and crisp it up a bit. HUGE hit, especially with my two boys. My youngest boy ate two chicken legs, which is huge for this kid who's pickier than any other kid I know. We loved it.

This was a very good rub.  I used it on a whole chicken that I put on my rotisserie.  It gave the chicken a really good taste.  I want to try it on some steaks next to see if it's just as good.

A great all-around dry rub.  Can be adjusted to suit your tastes.  Like others, I reduced the cumin -and left everything else the same.  Next time, might cut back on the black pepper, too.  Would make great little hostess gifts - put in a small glass jar with a 'Grub Rub' label.  Thanks for sharing!

Nicely balanced flavors make this rub a star!  I am glad that I doubled the recipe so I will have it on hand; I can imagine using it on various grilled meats and vegetables.  The only change I made was subbing smoked paprika for a portion of the paprika called for in the recipe.  Great!

Not sure if I rated this before, but I have to say that I have been using this "grub rub" recipe for years now, and it is my favorite dry rub!  Great for steak, chicken, everything!  Thank you, Johnny.

This was good, we skewered some large shrimp intertwined with bacon & gave them a nice sprinkling of this rub prior to grilling. Personally I'd cut down a bit on the cumin but other than that it's a nice blend that the hubs wants to try on his next smoked pork project. Very good though not overly spectacular.

Really good.  I cut the serving size by half of that listed but ended up doubling the brown sugar . . . just because it sort of smelled strong, like I needed a little more sweet [what's an extra tablespoon of brown sugar anyway?].  I rubbed the mixture over a pork tenderloin and kept it refrigerated overnight.  Next day we grilled it and at the end of the grilling time mopped it with Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar bbq sauce.  It was probably the best pork tenderloin we've had and we're sort of picky.  Add to this, my husband is expert at knowing just how long to get a sear on the hot side of the coals and when to transfer the meat to the indirect side which makes for an incredible juicy cut of meat.  Try this rub -- I had extra and will definitely try on other cuts of meat.  Cheers.

This is a very good barbeque rub with room to modify the amount of spiciness or sweetness to suit your tastes. First, I scaled this down a quite a bit to serve for only two people plus, I did not want to make a whole lot not knowing whether or not my family would like this or not. They generally do not like anything remotely spicy. So what I did was add a little more brown sugar and went real light on the cumin, paprika, black pepper, and omitted the chili powder. I used this for a shrimp dish. This ended in a happy surprise for me as my family actually liked the blend of the seasonings. I was pleased that this worked out since I was hesistant when measuring the ingredients. As for me, I like the flavors, thou, I would and could have used some "more" spiciness to the rub. I am more delighted that I finally found a bbq rub that the whole family can embrace and enjoy over meats, seafood, etc. Thank you Johnny!

Excellent rub. I did change two items.  I used granulated garlic instead of powder (more flavor) and reduced the black pepper to 1 Tablespoon.  Used it on a Tri-tip & grilled on the rotesserie. Very juicy.  Will use it on chicken & pork next.

DELICIOUS!!!  Made as is, the recipe is awesome.  Add 1 Tablespoon of Onion Powder to it and it's PERFECT.  I kept all of the other measurements the same except I cut the black pepper down to 1 Tablespoon or my kids would think it was too spicy.  I can't understand why everyone was cutting back on the cumin, I thought 1 Tablespoon was perfect and didn't overwhelm the flavors at all, even before I added in the Onion Powder.  Can't wait to try this on chicken!!

This rub was excellent, my guy and I loved it. We used it on steaks, let the rub sit about 2 hours then grilled them up.  Being the first time I was using it, I did take the recommendations from other reviewers and cut the cumin to 1/2 a tablespoon. It is a great flavor with just the right amount of heat, do not let the strong smell fool you (not the burn your tongue so you cannot taste other things heat).  Where we enjoy spicy things I actually may add a bit more heat next time, and try the original measurement of cumin.  We will definitely be using this again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Two of us really loved it, the third really didn't love it.

I have a feeling that I applied far too much of the rub to the meat.  I wouldn't change any of the ingredients or proportions but I would certainly back off on the amount used.

I am one of those guys who loves flavour, flavour, flavour however I am realizing that a house doesn't have to fall on you for you to enjoy a recipe.

Use sparingly unless you want to eat alone.

Loved it!

Very good dry rub! I used it for my london broil and grilled it....awesome base. For the paprika, i used half smoked paprika and half regular paprika. I had let the rub sit on the meat for an hour and I can smell the strong cumin but after grilling, I didn't find it overwhelming at all...everything blended very well....thanks

I took the advice of some others and cut the cumin way down. I think I used like 1/2 tsp. I did the same with the chili powder. My kids don't like spicy food. I also doubled the brown sugar. I cooked half the meat in the oven on low heat and half on the BBQ. They both were delicious!

This rub was great.   I didn't have the mustard, but used everything else.   I doubled the brown sugar to give it just a hint of sweet taste.    We rubbed down 12 thick pork chops and grilled them.  They were delicious!   This rub is spicy - might be a bit hot for younger children.  But my family loved it!!!   We served it with orange marmalade dip like Outback Steakhouse serves: 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 1 t. horseradish and 2 teaspoons stone ground mustard.  Mix together and refrigerate for a little while before serving.    It was perfect with the chops.  We definitely will use this rub again.

We've used this rub for years and years.  It was so good we've added it to our emergency 72 hour kits so our dinners can have some spice.  It's the only thing we used on our deep fried turkeys and chickens!

I thought it was too spicy; my husband loved it. I did add oil so the rub would stick to the meat, and that may be why it was so spicy. I am going to use it again because it has a great flavor, probably just reduce the amount of rub on my steak.

This just tated like I had thrown a bunch if cumin on the ribs---it was WAY to overpowering. Next time I may just omit it or cut down on it a little.

This is great on everything.  One exotic way to use it is on the Thanksgiving Turkey.  Inject strained Italian Dressing into the meaty parts, rub the rub all over the outside after patting the skin dry.  Then roast at 350 until done.

Delicious! This was an amazing spice rub. I mixed this up after reading another AR user comments for BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp.  I made this for as an appetizer for our Christmas dinner and sprinkled the spice rub over the shrimp then over the bacon. Delicious!!! I did it the cayenne pepper in half due to kids but next time I am going to make two batches, one spicy and one mild:) to use on steak and grilled shrimp.

There is love in this rub!  Delicious on our baby back ribs.  Makes quite a bit, too, enough for two racks well rubbed.  I prepared pretty much as written with exception of using celery salt in place of plain, and divided the paprika two TBSP sweet/two TBSP smoked.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe, tasty stuff!

This is a fantastic rub, and so easy to make!  It was fabulous on roast pork, and I can hardly wait to try it on grilled chicken.  This is now a staple in my kitchen.  If you try it, you'll love it.

This is potent stuff and really packed some flavor into the ribs I cooked low and slow for 6 hours before applying BBQ sauce.  The rub and BBQ sauce went rather well together as the spice from the rub complimented the sweet and smoky sauce.  Recommendations:  there is some mouth tingle.  For less mouth tingle, perhaps cut the paprika and black pepper back by half.  Oh, I traded a tablespoon of paprika from smoked paprika, yum. Will make again, with a little less paprika and black pepper next time.  Good rub, will have to try on steak.

This rub is a winner. Both my picky eaters ate chicken marinated in it. I diced the chicken, cooked it with diced onions and red peppers, and then rolled it up in tortillas. It was so good with sour cream!

Loved this!  Used it on pork chops last night and rubbed some on a steak that is going on the grill tonight.  Great combo of flavors-and all things I had on hand already.  Also liked that it made enough for several servings..........cause we are definitely gonna be using this a lot this summer!

I have done this rub on pork tenderloin and pork roast in crock pot with sauerkraut.  To do this cut the recipe in half, otherwise it would be too overpowering.  It really adds a lot of flavor.

I didn't have the dried oregano but the rub turned out fantastic anyway.  It held up great on the ribs throughout grilling and I didn't even need sauce on top.  I am so glad I found this.

Thanks Johnny! We made this to rub on a full size pork loin for our sons first birthday party. We wanted something different to impress the family and friends at the party, and this sure did! We did make one change since we had no oregano we used Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning. This recipe was so delicious it gave the pork the perfect flavor. We will definitely use this recipe again!

This rub was so flavorful.....I put the rub on a pork butt that I let marinate in the rub overnight in the fridge. Next morning I placed it in the crockpot on low for about 9 hours, shredded up the meat(which just fell apart beautifully)and added about 3/4 bottle of KC Masterpiece, served on potato rolls. Family loved it....sorry I didn't make your sauce, pressed for time.....but the rub was outstanding and will use this recipe again.

Well, I'm impressed. I used this on country style beef boneless "ribs". I had my husband grill the meat for about 16 minutes and then served bottled bbq sauce (KC Masterpiece original) on the side. This rub was perfect for the sauce, the flavors went together nicely. This was very very good. My teen complained "too much paprika". I'd used Hungarian paprika instead, maybe that made a difference?  I wouldn't change a thing. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks Johnny!
UPDATE 07/10/2011: Excellent rub! I found this hidden in a ziplock baggie in my pantry and used it for a brisket rub that DH hickory smoked for several hours. This made the best barbecue in all of south Texas! Thanks!!!

I was very hesitant about this recipe because I was missing mustard powder, chili powder, brown sugar and paprika. I used 1 tsp of cayenne to substitue for the heat of the chili powder and paprika and was afraid it would be too hot. I basted in mustard to sub for the powder and it helped the seasoning to stick, and I just used white sugar instead of brown. To my surprise, I got fantastic reviews. If this was good missing those ingredients, I'm assuming it'd be good when done correctly. I have to give it 5 stars for the praise it got me! The smoky cumin taste was a plus.

We Loved it!  What a nice alternative to a maranade!  It tasted just like a steak at a good steakhouse!  And I didn't even have any cumin, and accidentaly put in 1/2 tbsp of oregano instead of 1/2 tsp!  Oops! :)

This recipe is the best "grub rub" I've found. It's an excellent basic rub with great flavor and depending on how heavily it's applied can give a mild to spricy taste to chicken and pork. With the addition of some cayenne pepper you can "kick it up a notch" and really tingle your taste buds!!

Even though we loved this rub the first time we tried it, I have waited to review it to see if it was as tasty on other meats and poultry. Much to my surprise it was great on everything! I entertain alot and cook for my living, and I can't even guess how many people have already asked me for this recipe!!

When cooking for a particular family member I have to avoid all cracked peppers and things such as celery seeds (for medical dietary reasons) which means most  of my spice recipes or store bought premade spice mixes can't be used. This mix is easy and delicious when used on bbq meats or as a dry rub so I always keep a container of this spice mix in the cupboard.

This is so recommended. An absolute awesome Rub. 
From the measurements listed, I used this on 28 good sized chicken wings. Left them to marinade overnight in an airtight container.
The result after indirectly cooking on the BBQ, was the best wings we've had in a long time.

I thought this was really great.  We used the entire amount on a huge package of chicken wings from Sams club plus one chicken breast. It only marinated for about 45 minutes but since we used so much it was really flavorful. I went heavy on the cumin because I love it and less on the paprika.  I will do this again for sure but maybe not use so much of it.

It wasn't bad but next time I'll use less black pepper. It was very over powering. Overall the recipe was pretty good though.

This is a great rub for ribs!  I hadn't made any in a while so I started looking up rub recipes. This one is very similar to what I had done before so I tried it.  I didn't use the mustard. I exchanged it for Turmeric and I added some Marjoram. Brings out a good flavor  especially if you leave it on a few hours before you cooking

I made the rub exactly as written. Used it on sirloin steak, let it set on steak for about 45minutes, grilled it and we loved it. Was concerned maybe  it would be too peppery but was just great. Will use many times I am sure.

We were making Balsamic Roasted Pork (from this site) and as I was preparing the marinade, I noticed that we must have run out of our steak seasoning.  We tried this one and it was great- we didn't have paprika (it expired) and the hubby doesn't like cumin.  We did use fresh-cracked pepper .  If you need a delicious rub or steak seasoning, try this one!

It didn't taste bad, but I was hoping for more pizzazz in the rub. I'd probably add more chili powder, and use less cumin and paprika. Also, I would go lighter on the rub when I cover the meat.

I make a rub that's very similar to this, with the addition of about 1 heaping tablespoon of onion powder. I do have a word of advice:
Use a good paprika, IE Hungarian, in the big red can, sweet, smoked of hot ( which really isn't, but is a bit spicier). The paprika usually seen in mega marts, is bland and tasteless, adding little besides color to the party.
Also, I cut down on the black pepper

Tonight was my third time making this.  It's been delicious every time.  I put it on steak tips before grilling them.  We had the tips with baked potatoes and green beans.  Overall a delicious dinner highlighted by the spice rub.  Definitely our favorite!

Johnny's Spice Rub Haiku: "Too much cumin here. But otherwise, this is great! Used on some chicken." I made the recipe as directed, putting half in a small tuperware for another day, and rubbing the other half liberally on two chicken breast halves that I quickly browned over hi heat in 1 tsp butter and 1 tsp olive oil, then finished off in a 350 deg oven. A really nice rub that would complement any protein, and any method of cooking, but the cumin came through way too strongly, and I LOVE cumin. I'll definitely be hanging onto Johnny's recipe and saving it in larger tuperwares (or giving as little spice-rub-jar gifts), but scaling the cumin way back.

SO GOOD!  I used smoked paprika and it added a little bit of oomph.  We rubbed this on ribs and they were the best I'd ever tasted.  I've been looking for a long time for a good dry rub recipe...and this is it!

I thought this looked like a good recipe for a rub. I guess I must have put way too much on the meat. It was overpowering. My husband liked it, so I gave it 3 stars. I probably will not make it again as I did not care for it....Back to the search...

I had to leave out the paprika (mine has gone missing O_o). I also used onion salt in place of salt.  That was just a personal choice.  I also reduced the cumin down to 1/2 tsp.  This was also a personal choice. This was very spicy and OUTSTANDING!!!!!  I would personally give it 10 stars if I could.  I think I have found my newest culinary addiction to experiment with!  I will be using this recipe again.  Thank you so much for sharing it!!!!!  I used my rub on boneless spare ribs and oh holy delicious!!!!!!

I mixed this up and rubbed it on a rack of baby back ribs. Then I left it sit in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap for about 4 or 5 hours.  Then I made the ribs. I thought this was excellent. My husband on the other hand, thought that it was too spicy. I also liked the idea of it making twice as much so you could save half or give half away for somebody else to try. I loved this recipe, and I am saving it.

Theres a reason this rub is so highly rated! Its so easy but so good. I didnt have any paprika and added a touch more chili powder. It was very good but very spicy. I chose to use this on cubes of meat about 1.5in each. Dipped them directly in the rub and made a great side.

I used this on steaks, and we didn't think it added much flavor.  We've tried rubs before and liked them, so I think this combination of spices just didn't do it for us.

I love this rub. We love to grill and I've tried on chicken, beef and pork and it has always enhanced the flavor of anything that we've cooked. I was always a purist: just salt and pepper until now.

This is a great rub. I use it primarily for chicken and pork and it is great on both. Also works well for roasted vegetables too. Easy to put together and just store in a jar and use when needed. Quite spicy too!

I have been searching for the perfect rub for BBQ ribs.  I love this one.  As I was in a rush, I substituted 1/4 tsp ground red pepper and 1 tbsp white sugar for the chili pepper.  This was wonderful on ribs AND chicken.  Thanks for posting!

I grilled tri-tip steaks using this rub and was really pleased with the flavor. It was absolutely delicious and not too spicy at all. I will definitely use this again and again.

This is an awesome rub!  It seals the meat with a great crust and has a very potent flavor.  I used an extra hot chili power.

This is a great rub for ribs.  Everyone just raved about them, even the little ones enjoyed eating them.  They usually don't care for ribs.  J Gratiot

This is a "really spicy" rub. It leaves a kick that you don't immediately notice  I used it on ribs and chicken.  The chicken was sooooo moist.  I think the paprika coating seals in the moisture.  It browns very quickly.  My guests loved it.

This is a great rub!  I used the entire batch on one whole chicken and grilled it.  If you don't like food that's real spicey, try half the batch. I can't wait to try it on ribs!
