This was delicious. I used pre-made pesto since fresh basil is $$ right now. I used turkey bacon. Will definitely make this again

The idea of this recipe sounds like it would be tasty... But the flavor combo of adding the pesto is just too strange. I bet it would be great without the pesto.

These were delicious, but a little salty because of the broth and bacon. Because backing off the bacon would be sacrilege, I used water with half a bouillon cube the next time. Still delicious but not as salty.
