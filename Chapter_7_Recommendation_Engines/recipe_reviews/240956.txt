I make something similar when I can get fresh eggplant from the garden, but I never thought to add the red wine vinegar and it adds such a burst of fresh flavor.  I used wide egg noodles because I had them on hand and I doubt any of my eaters realized they weren't Italian and I used fresh mozzarella.  Delicious! and I know the leftovers I'm hoarding for my lunch will be even better. Thank you Debbie.

Very good! I skipped the buffalo mozzarella and just topped it with shaved Grana Padano®. Delicious! Will be making this again.

DELICIOUS!  Only things I did differently were based on what I had on hand: different shaped pasta and no fresh mozzarella.  Will definitely make this again and again!

This is delicious.  The only change I made was I added another garlic clove because we like a lot of garlic.  Also added some parsley because I think it brightens up tomato sauce.. Will be making this again because it is meatless and very tasty .

I'm giving this five stars because of the flavor and the versatility of this recipe.  I usually don't alter recipes but I had left over barbacoa that needed used up so I thought this recipe would be perfect to make a bolognese.  I did try the sauce before I added the beef and other ingredients and it was delicious on its own.

This was fairly easy to make and super yummy.  The hubby and the 6 y.o. were happy, and they requested that I make it again.

I had leftover homemade marinara.  Just added the vinegar and some leftover canned mushroom to the sauce.
Yum!

Incredible, easy and delicious!  My boyfriend and I loved it.  I listened to others and made 4 portions for just the two of us and was really happy we had leftovers :)

This is a delicious recipe!  Only thing I changed was the pasta. I used half regular and half whole wheat pene.  It was great as leftovers for the next two days.

This is an excellent recipe. My husband liked it, I loved it. I don't like to sit the eggplant with salt to dry up, I did it anyway. I followed the recipe except for organic cane sugar and worked very well.

Excellent, restaurant quality recipe!  I made 2 minor modifications to my taste: I doubled the amount of garlic and increased tomatoes (I used Pomì boxed chopped tomatoes 26.46 oz).  Outstanding dinner - my husband & son loved it.  I will definitely be making this again soon!

Really good! The only thing I changed is I used crushed red pepper in place of the black pepper, and whole wheat fusilli pasta that I had on hand. Could use more salt, but I'm trying to cut down so the recipe was great as it.  Even my 11 year old liked it. I will make this again.

This was pretty tasty. Loved the cheese and the eggplant. It did need more salt. I also would have preferred thin spaghetti or angel hair pasta, but thats just a personal preference.

This was delicious! I made this almost exactly as written too (which I don't normally do). I used regular fettuccini because that's what I had on hand. I served it with some chicken scallopini, garlic bread and salad. Such a good recipe!

This was a tasty meatless meal that we all thought was delicious.  The only change I made was to use chopped tomatoes because it’s what I had on hand and it worked out perfectly.

Simple with lots of flavor! Used eggplant from my garden and a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. Had fresh refrigerated fettuccine on hand so I used that.  Yum!
