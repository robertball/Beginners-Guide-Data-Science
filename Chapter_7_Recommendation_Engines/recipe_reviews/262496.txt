I had some butternut squash that I had previously cooked in my instant pot and cubed so I prepared the soup and cooked the other ingredients and added the squash in the last 10 minutes or so. I loved it. My husband thought it was weird. More for me.

This soup is FANTASTICALLY YUMMY. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. It’s sweet & savory. I followed the Recipe except I was short on celery and cut that and the carrots small so probably only had 1 & 1/2 cups of each on those. Really loved it, will make again. With some crusty bread  - Perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Only had about 2 cups  of squash, used 6 carrots, tossed in 1/2 a bag of baby spinach that needed to be used  and tripled the Italian spice and minced garlic (from a jar).  Seemed a little thin for my taste so ran about 1-1/ 2 cups of cooled chunks through the processor and it was WONDERFUL!  Opted for store cut squash rather than cutting up one myself. Made it last Sunday and got more squash today to make it again this weekend.  Very  pretty and yummy!

Easy to make.  I love chopping all the veggies!  (I used almond milk instead of 'real' milk.)
