I needed to use up a can of butter beans my husband bought a while back, so I decided to make this soup.  It was very good.  I did add a few seasonings to spice it up.  The fresh vegetables were done after cooking them for 30 minutes. Next time I won't boil them for that long and I will let them finish cooking while the soup simmers for an hour.

I cooked it without the meat and substituted a can of chicken broth, it was fantastic. Very quick and easy.

This recipe is so quick and easy, it's the only one i ever use. Instead of all the cans though, I use 6 cans mixed vegetables and chop a few fresh potatoes, carrots and celery. It makes a fairly nice size pot but don't last more than a day or 2 in our family of 6.

I made this yesterday and it was really good.  I did tweek it up a little in order to use up a bunch of different frozen vegetable that we had.  I made a double batch.  I cut up my own stew beef from a boneless chuck roast.  I cooked the meat in 2 qts. beef broth and 2 qts. water.  I also added cabbage and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  My husband did not have to add extra salt to it which was a treat.

This was very good.  The meat needed some spices.  Otherwise, the soup just tastes like the salt from the canned veggies.  I'm wondering if browning the meat instead of boiling it would make a difference?  Other than that, it was very easy and very filling (especially with some nice crusty bread)!

I thought it was alright. I added lemon, and a tiny bit of Tabasco sauce which definatly made it taste a lot better. Also, I added 2 bay leaves while I boiled the meat.

This could not have been any easier to make. I had no problem with the meat boiling dry but to start,  I put probably about 1/2 inch more water in it than the top of the meat when I started boiling it. I put the potatoes in 15 minutes after the carrots and onions to be sure they didn't get too mushy. Put two bay leaves in when boiling the meat and some black pepper as suggested by some.  My family loved this soup. My husband HATES spicy foods so he was thrilled with what some called "bland" as was my daughter who has stomach issues with spicy food. I personally like spicy, so I added some Spicy V8 to the soup I had and it was perfect for me. Easily modifiable to suit individual tastes, a bonus! This is a new favorite for my family because it was quick, easy, yummy and healthy! Can't get any better than that (unless someone else does the cooking for you, lol)!

I thought this was very bland.  I added tomatoes, and hot sauce and it was still bland.  Will try a different one next time.

The recipe was okay, the cooking process was a little frustrating to be honest. Not trying to bash, but I followed the steps as they were written, filled the water just to cover the meat as written and boiling it for 30 minutes on high heat, reduces your liquids, as it did mine. I could see, bringing it to a boil and reducing the temp for a bit, but to hard boil not just one round of 30 minutes, but 2 rounds was a bit much, but I kept at the directions as written and by the time I got to step 3, there was not much to drain off. I was consistantly adding water to bring the water amount over the meat and veggies. By the time I did get to step 3, the potatoes render down to partily mush, and I originally opened a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and used half but then ended up adding the entire contents of the can. This recipe to me would be a better slow cooker recipe then the steps it took to get to the end result. While it reminds me of my moms old fashion vegetable soup, we were always adding hot pepper sauce and spices to each bowl way back when, as this is what we did in the end of this recipe too. I'd try again only to be placed in a slow cooker and adding garlic, oregano, basil, possibly a bay leaf and some heat.
