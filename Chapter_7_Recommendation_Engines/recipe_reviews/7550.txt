I didn't even make the syrup cause I didn't have some of the ingredients, and this cake was AWESOME. VERY moist and VERY flavourful and SO simple. Nothing more than throwing ingredients in a bowl!

Simple and delicious!  I've made this cake for a luau party and for a company potluck and got rave reviews each time.  I topped mine with canned whipped cream and sprinkled it with pecans for presentation.

This cake was very good, and made even more delicious when I used the Cool Whip topping from the Mandarin Orange cake recipe from the site instead of the butter glaze.  It added the extra pineapple flavor that some have said was missing.  It is insanely easy to prepare, and comes out very moist.  My SIL said it was her new favorite cake!  I got rave reviews.

Loved this cake, my kids actually thought it was pineapple bread.  Took this to a church potluck and the dish came back clean.

I made this cake with fresh pineapple and used my blender to chop it into small pieces and I only had 8 oz of it, so I decided to use a tin of mandarin slices in light syrup which made up the difference to get 20 oz of pineapple.  I did not have evaporated milk and used half and half instead.  The cake came out great and the glaze was perfect!  Adding that tin of mandarin slices was such a hit!  I'll make this one again for sure.

i had a can of crushed pineapple, so i figured 'what the hey'.  i added some lime juice and zest i had leftover from something else.

wow! so rich and most and decadent, my boyfriend ate most of them that day, my friend consumed the rest the next evening.  when my boyfriend's mother was comming to town i asked what i could make her, he said 'make that pineapple cake again!'.

I am stunned at this cake,it taste more like pineapple bread. It is very heavy and dense, being an experience home baker over 36 years, I should have known better when I didn't view any oil, trust shortening or butter in the recipe. I did not due the sugary icing, trust me you would do better if you purchase a yellow cake mix and dump the pineapple in it.....will never make this again, a real disappointment ......

This was very good, quick, and easy. I liked the fact there was no oil in the cake itself, however, the icing made up for it with the butter. I also added 1 cup chopped pecans.

This cake was really great, and the glaze is by far the BEST part! I had to make it twice in one day because everyone kept picking at it. The second time, I added some pineapple extract and lemon zest, as the cake did need a little flavor boost. Still moist and yummy though. Make sure to use evaporated milk and cook the glaze the full 5 minutes. It's buttery-salty-sweet, which I just love!

One guest didn't like the glaze, said it was too buttery. She suggested making a glaze of confectioner's sugar and pineapple juice for a fresher, lighter taste.

This cake was very moist. I added one cup of sugar to the mixture instead of one and a half cups because there was sugar in the butter mixture already. The pineapple flavor is subtle, which I like very much. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This turned out really good for me!  I added a splash of vanilla and some cinnamon.  I also added a little bit of chopped peaches to the pineapple.  The cake wasn't too dense to me at all!  Instead of the butter topping i did a blueberry sauce topping.  yum!

This was a-maz-ing. Followed the recipe to the letter, even making the buttery sauce to pour over the top. Even my pineapple hating husband ate THREE PIECES. Incredibly moist and delicious cake. Next time, I'll add pecans as another reviewer did.

The cake was tasty and it's really easy to make, but mine came out very dense.  Almost like a pineapple brownie.

This cake was super easy to make and very quick which was a plus. I agree that this recipe needs a flavor boost. My favorite part was the icing. I don't think it was too sweet at all and only added to the moistness of the cake. I only had pineapple chunks so I threw them into the food processor and I was short on vanilla so I added a tad of almond extract to the icing. It was great. I think I might try this recipe with peaches and some allspice next time.

Next time I'll make and use about half of the butter sauce since it drowned out the pineapple flavor and made the cake WAY too rich and fattening.

Everyone liked it and a couple loved it...it is dense and moist...cooked longer than in recipe because middle was still soft- I did use fresh pineapple which may have affected it and added a touch of oil just since some seemed shocked that it didn't have any oil...Overall, would still consider it low-fat and would make again for this reason...might make some substitutions, like adding coconut or something (my son reading over my should just said "ewww" so maybe not, lol).

I don't really like pineapple, but my husband does and I had a stray can of crushed pineapple to do something with, so I made this.  The only thing I changed was that I was all out of regular sugar so I replaced all the sugar with powdered sugar (1 c gran sugar = 1.75 c powdered sugar).  My verdict, this cake was awesome!!!  and like I said, I don't really like pineapple!!

So easy to make.  Great snack cake.  Didn't bother with the glaze as we found the cake to be sweet enough without it.  Needs something else to give it a boost -maybe a bit of orange juice or zest or some other citrus fruit.  Would make again.

I'm aways critical of my own baking no mtter what anyone says so for me, personally, it was just ok BUT all the guys who ate it simply loved it - all the chicks I know are on diets. My brother in law put it in the toaster over the next morning and said it was fabulous. I only used maybe 1/4 of the sauce, next time I think I'll just use brown sugar. The cake is good without anything else and it's super easy to make and a nice change from chocolate all the time.

This is a tasty cake.  It's a little denser than I expected, and the syrup/glaze is very buttery, but all in all I would make this again.

I liked this fat-free version very much. I added 1.25 cups of sugar, and it was too sweet to my taste if you also use a glaze or icing. I will definitely repeat this again, but using 1 cup of sugar. You can always add more sweetness to the cake using icing if you are not satisfied. But the cake is moist and tasty itself. And I added 1 tsp of fresh lemon zest, people liked it.

We loved it, my hub had two pieces and he didn't think he would like it because he was wanting chocolate.  I frosted with homemade cream cheese icing.  Will make again and again, I like the fact that there is no oil.

This was a great and easy cake to make on a rainy day whim.  Kids loved it!  I did not have evaporated milk so I just made a butter and brown sugar glaze to top it with and it was good...I'll make this one again

This was a big disappointment after having read all the great reviews. This cakes tasted like a cobbler-without the juices the cobbler naturally has. It was very sweet with just a little pineapple taste and the butter sauce was WAY too buttery. The next day, even though the pineapple had settled more into the cake, the butter sauce had hardened on top and it was just a greasy mess.  I was completely unhappy with this recipe and threw it out.

This smelled GREAT in the oven, and I really wanted to like it. I agree with another reviewer, though: it lacked the pineapple flavor I expected from a pineapple cake. It just tastes sweet. It wasn't bad, but I will not be making it again.

I found this cake to be very easy to make, delicious and moist. I used EnerG Egg Replacer instead of eggs to make it vegan, and it turned out great, and used a vegan cream cheese frosting on it instead of the evaporated milk recipe listed - it was great - highly recommend.

This is wonderful!  I made the cake exactly as the recipe instructs (but used fresh pineapple)  and it  turned out beautifully.  I will definitely make again and will give it a shot with fresh peaches this summer. Thanks for posting.

I’ve made this a few times and enjoy it. It’s simple and good by itself and I don’t make the topping. The last time I made it I reduced the sugar from 1 1/2 cups to 1/2 cup and added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead. I enjoyed that option as well for a change.

After it baked through, and with glaze applied it was dense, rubbery and sickly sweet. Not good, not good at all.

So good! It is better the next day for sure. I added 1 cup almonds because that is what I had on hand. Im sure pecans would be just as good. Instead of the glaze I  poured 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk while it was still  just little warm.
I did not want it to get soggy.  I used 8.5 X 11 in  pan  &  cooked for 40 min was cooked perfectly

This was so easy to make and so delicious.  On the frosting I did not have evaporated milk so I used condensed milk and no sugar.  It was delicious.  Making again today using fresh pineapple.

Well I cheated this one big time. Lol. I used a pre made cake mix (with pudding in the mix) and followed the directions from here adding the can of pineapple with juice and 2 eggs instead of 3 that the box called for. It was so light and fluffy. I made the buttery milk syrup as is. Omg. I want to put it on everything now. Lol. So happy to find a yummy use for evaporated milk!! The kids and even hubby who is more of a fruit over sweets person all loved it!! My only problem is wanting to eat the whole thing lol.

I made this because I had some pineapple from another recipe. It's quick and easy and pretty good. I put the sliced pineapple in a food processor and since I didn't have enough white flour, I substitute with a cup of oats that I turned into flour. I also squeezed in the juice of half a lemon because the batter didn't taste like much at first. Oh and I cut the sugar to 1 cup and that was plenty sweet.

I just made this and absolutely love it.  I made two .  One for a party tomorrow and one to sample to make sure it's good.  It's really, really good.  It's not a light fluffy cake, rather a moist dense cake.  The Buttery Milk Syrup is fantastic!!  I thought there was a lot of it but when I tasted it I was glad there was so much.  I may top the party cake with raspberries to provide a tart counterpoint to the cake and syrup.  This will be a staple for me from now on.

Wow! This cake is so good!  You can't get any simpler and it's made with ingredients most of us just have on hand!  I did a coconut flavored  powdered sugar glaze on top and sprinkled with flaked coconut. Tasted just like a pina colada....great recipe!

My next door neighbor gave me all these cans of crushed pineapple that i had no idea what to do with until i came across this recipe. This cake is awesome to say the least. The only problem with it is that i've made it so many times i only have one can of pineapple left.

Very heavy and dense with a greasy topping, a disappointment after the good reviews. I'm trying to think of some ways to salvage this, but nothing comes to mind.

I agree with some reviewers who say this needs a flavor boost.  This was just ok for us.

I was very skeptical at first. But, the cake turned out really good.  I only had pineapple slices in a can so I had to chop it.  And, I only made half of the butter-sugar-milk recipe.  The cake is very sweet (maybe, too sweet).  I will definitely keep this recipe.  It's the best pineapple cake I've had.

This is the best from scratch pineapple cake I have ever tasted. I made this one for my mom and she already wants me to make another one for her.

This was good.  I had 2 14oz cans of pineapple chunks so I increased the flour and sugar by 1/2 cup and added another tsp of baking soda. Baked 3/4 of this in a pan and the rest in muffin tins. The muffins burned but I baked the actual cake for 35min and it was perfect!  Glazed it afterwards with the given recipe and substituted milk for the evaporated milk.  I may make this again.

YUM. I used two egg whites instead of each egg. I didn't have 20 oz of pineapple; i only had 8. So I used shreadded carrots and coconut for the remaining 12 ounces, and tripled the soda and added two more egg whites to account for the extra weight. Halved the sugar in the cake, and the butter on the icing. Walnuts. Cinnamon. I like this recipe - it puts the fat right where you can taste it, and doesnt waste it in the cake. YUM, again. My husband will be drooling when he tastes this one :)

Husbadn loved it but I did not.  Although a nice dense cake it certainly did not have much of a pineapple flavor which is what PINEAPPLE cake should have.  Also did not care for glaze the next day.  Overall not bad but not sweet enough.
