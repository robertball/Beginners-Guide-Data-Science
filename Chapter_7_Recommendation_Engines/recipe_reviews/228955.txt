These were good we ate them with soup and a grilled cheese for a light lunch. Easy and something just a little different it does make a ton of filling tho so we ate leftovers on crackers the next day.

I had to pick a Spanish  recipe for class, and I picked this one. I'm glad I did! I double the recipe, and had enough for 17 eggs with plenty filling leftover! My mom was scarfing it down. They were a hit in my class, and I would definitely make it again!

Tasty! Reminded me of tuna salad, and that's what I was expecting, so it was a good thing. Nice flavor and the smoked paprika was a nice touch. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe.  I double the recipe for a dozen eggs and I had a lot of the filling leftover.  I feel like it could fill another dozen eggs.  I do hate to waste all those yolks though.

These were delicious. I took them to a potluck at work and they were a hit.

Very tasty! I made a dozen eggs, so doubled the recipe. I am in Europe, and the tuna can was 170 g, more  like 6 ounces each, so I just used one 170 g can for the whole 12-egg recipe. For my taste, I could have increased the spiciness. But they disappeared at the party!
