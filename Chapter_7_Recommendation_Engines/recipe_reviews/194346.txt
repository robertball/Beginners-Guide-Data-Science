OMGOSH! Absolutely YUMMY Goodness! To help lighten the caloric load, I used the less fat Philly Cream Cheese, and seeing as I was L-A-Z-Y and not wanting to crush oreas (why waste a perfectly good cookie?) I bought already crushed oreo crumbs. I cut the recipe in half as I didn't need a 13x9 cheesecake to eat! :) For those wanting to know the equivalent of already crushed crumbs, I used 1 3/4 Cups for an 8x8 glass pan and used 1/4 cup melted butter. I also used parchment paper versus foil (my preference). Tip-pour the melted butter in first and let it cover the entire bottom, then put the crumbs in and press down all over to make an even surface. This is about one of the easiest cheesecake recipes around! and soooooo chocolately GOOD! ;) Thanks Philly!

This is YUMMY!  However, I messed up and didn't melt the chocolate chips and just added them so it was more a chocolate chip cheesecake, but oddly enough, it was GREAT! I then melted an 8 oz. bag of milk chocolate chips and spread it all over the top. Once it was refrigerated, it hardened and was a great top crust. One other variation was that I used the entire bag of Oreos and not just 24.  For both the semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips I used Ghiradelli brand.

This is an easy but amazing cheesecake that will satisfy even the most extreme chocolate craving. I made it for a graduation party today and it was a crowd pleaser. I did make two changes from the posted recipe: I put it in a 10-inch springform pan instead of the 9x13 pan, and I topped it with a drizzle of melted milk chocolate chips instead of using blueberries (because there just wasn't enough chocolate in it already--lol). 

The springform worked great but I did have to increase the cooking time to about 1 hour. I also used the water bath method (see cheesecake tips and videos on this website) and allowed the cheesecake to cool in the oven (oven off/door cracked open) for 3 hours before refrigerating it. It turned out perfect, with no cracking at all. For the improvised topping I used a half a bag of milk chocolate chips, melted and slightly cooled, then drizzled it over the top of the refrigerated cheesecake. This would also be pretty with white chocolate.  I will definitely make this again! 

This is only the second cheesecake I've ever made and it was unbelievably easy to make. If you're hesitant to try it, there's a Kraft Kitchen's video of it on YouTube. Happy baking!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made is for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it! While I followed the recipe almost completely, I did use reduced fat cream cheese (all that the store had, but a healthy change, too!) and I heated raspberry preserves in a saucepan and spread over the top just before serving. Yummy!

Amazing chocolate cheesecake.  Only change was I used a package of crushed chocolate graham crackers in place of oreo cookies.

Made this today with the intention of taking it to work and sharing, but I couldn't resist cutting into it.  It is SO GOOD!  Also one of the easiest cheesecakes I've ever made.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Will definitely make again.

During these times of cutting corners, and the fact that I am cheap, LOL. I used store brand cream cheese,cookies, chocolate,vanilla,margarine flour, eggs, and sugar.  Tasted GREAT!!  A family fave.

I have been making this for years and it is sooooo good! I have made these into cupcakes as well (makes about 24) and then pop the left overs in the freezer. Tastes really yummy frozen too. My husband loves this cheesecake and has it every year for his birthday.

Great, super-easy, super-chocolatey recipe! I have made it several times, I always follow the recipe exactly (I don't feel that there needs to be any revisions) and it always turns out perfect.

YUMMY! SOOOOO Good! The only thing is to make sure you soften the cream cheese. Trying to mix the cream cheese before it softens will kill your mixer! Oops! Now I have to get a new mixer! =)

Very good, and even easier to make!  Didn't have the rich chocolate taste I was after...I'm going to try covering it with a dark chocolate ganache next time.

2 Hints- They aren't kidding when they say line the pan with tinfoil. It just sticks to it otherwise.  Also, I think you should cook it until it's set pretty well, because I followed what they said and cooked it until it was almost set- maybe even a little beyond that- and it was still not hard enough after chilling over night to completely hold it's form after being cut and taken out of the pan.  Overall, though, quite delicious!

Absolutely delicious and incredibly easy. I added a little berry pie filling (the canned kind) as a topping, instead of the blueberries. I'm sure that sounds weird, but it was sooo good!

We loved it!  I used neufchatel (lower fat) cheese instead of cream cheese, and melted about 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of baker's chocolate.  It was fabulous!  and easy.

Excellent cheesecake.  Very, very rich and creamy.  I made it with a graham cracker crust because I didn't have the oreos on hand, and also baked the full recipe in a 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 and it filled it up quite nicely with a thicker layer for the cheesecake and a nice thin crust.

I made this In July for my son's b-day and everyone loved it. I made two and left out the blueberries. I was nervous, but thumbs up to me. Everyone ate both pies and left none for the next day. Proud of myself and thank you for a great recipe. I will make it again.

I love this recipe! It is absolutely the best chocolate cheesecake recipe I have ever made. Sinfully delicious. It was devoured quickly with plans to make more very soon:-)   The only change I made was to use 2 ready-made Oreo pie crusts rather than making my own Oreo crust in an 13 X 9. I baked these the same as I was instructed to do on the original recipe.

My husband REALLY loves this cheesecake recipe! However, to accommodate our dietary restrictions, we are Diabetic, I take walnuts or pecans and crush them, mix them with the butter, Splenda, and Agave or other sweetener, plus a dash of cinnamon, for taste, and make the crust. (You could add cocoa powder.) I bake it as the recipe requires but add a few more minutes. I substitute a combination of sweeteners for the sugar and add a little bit of orange zest, just because I like the hint of citrus. I use Bakers semisweet chocolate, a little sugar is ok. I like using a springform pan and always bake it with a pan of water underneath to avoid cracks. My husband cannot stop raving about it and he says it doesn't taste like "diet" desserts.

Loved this recipe. I will say don't use double-stuffed oreos it made it a little more chewier/crustier but still a perfect recipe. It was like a chocolate cream cheese brownie cake! Loved it!

I am 34 weeks pregnant, and had a dream I was eating chocolate cheesecake. I couldn't get it out of my head. I made this recipe, but I bought one of the Oreo cookie pie crusts (it was less expensive and more convenient than a pack of oreos), and halved the recipe - no way I could eat a whole 13 x 9 pan! After testing, i used 5 oz of chocolate, and it was delicious. By way of cheesecakes, its pretty dense, and could quench any chocolate craving!

My husband LOVED this. I used blackberries on top instead of blueberries. I put about 3 blackberries on top of each little slice and the contrast between the extreme chocolate taste and the fruit was definitely loved.

Fabulous!  I poured it in to two ready made graham cracker crust and served it cold.  The topping cracked badly so I will bake it in a pan of water next time.  My 84 year old mother has never liked cheesecake until now and she has requested another one immediately.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe but changed a couple of things.  My friend is allergic to chocolate but she can eat white chocolate so i substituted melted white chocolate chips for the baking chocolate and then i made a graham cracker crust instead of  oreo cookies!  DELICIOUS!  and to make it even better I topped it with more white chocolate chips for the last 5 minutes of baking.  top with caramel and die cause it tastes so good lol

I made this in a springform pan using water bath method. Increased cooking time to 1:15 which was perfect! Topped with raspberry pie filling which helped it from being over the top chocolatey. Amazing!!!

This cheesecake was SO amazing! It was so easy, and I baked it in a water bath so there was no cracking, it was perfect. I accidentally only used 4 oz of the baking chocolate because I didn't realize the bar I got was smaller than the one this recipe calls for. So it wasn't as chocolately as it was supposed to be, but it didn't taste like it was missing anything..it was great! The consistency was perfect! It was so smooth and creamy..exactly like a cheesecake is supposed to be. Instead of a 9x13 pan, I used an 8x8 because I wanted it to be thicker. I didn't need to adjust the time. 45 minutes in a water bath, then I left it sitting in the oven about an hour after with the oven turned off. So good!

Mmmm chocolate lovers beware! For me, it was a bit too much chocolate and the blueberries (however nice they looked) didn't help break up the constant chocolate. Make sure you have lots of whipped cream for the side!

It's AMAZING! I loved it so much!
If you use a spring form pan to make it, grease it well and cook and additional 15-20 minutes. For a marbled cheesecake, pour the filling into the pan first, then add the chocolate chips and stir them in.
One of the best cheesecakes I have ever made.

Made this  for family and friends and all agreed it didn't taste much like cheese-cake and could have been a little sweeter.  Mabey I did something wrong making it.
