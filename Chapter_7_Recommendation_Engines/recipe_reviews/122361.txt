This is a 5-star recipe with my alterations.  I put minced jalape√±o, cilantro, fresh ginger, & sesame oil right into the meat loaf mix.  Also, we did not care for the pineapple topping, so I mixed teriyaki sauce with ketchup and spread that on top. It came out very moist and flavorful.  Thanks for a wonderful and creative recipe!
*Note* Mine was fully cooked after 1 hour.

I really loved this! I made a few additions/changes. I used panko breadcrumbs, because I really like their crunch, added chopped fresh spinach and chopped red onion. I topped this with a mixture of ketchup, pineapple and a dash of soy sauce. This was soo good! I served with garlic green beans and really enjoyed my dinner!

Excellent turkey meat loaf! We especially loved the pineapple-jalapeno salsa to top it with. Very original and delicious. Only a couple things I might change next time... 1)add some chopped cilantro to the salsa 2)bake just 1 hr... time as given was too long.. at least in my oven. Thanks for a "keeper" recipe!

When I put this in the oven I held my breath, because I didn't think it would be very good.  I was pleasantly surprised!!  I LOVED this!!  I did modify some things (based on what I had available) but it was SUPERB!!  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Not bad at all.  Tastes better then it looks.  Not dry at all, very moist.  I ate this the day after I made it and it was good. (was working out while it baked and when we were done, was no longer hungry lol)  My b/f enjoyed it also.  The salsa was pretty good too, and I was scared of how that would turn out. Followed recipe exactly except I used 1lb of turkey and used slightly less breadcrumbs.  I still kept the seasoning amounts the same.  Baked for about 1 hr. Considering how healthy it is, we will probably make it again.

Really good and a nice change of pace. I used only 1 lb of turkey (my mistake) and subbed oats for the breadcrumbs and thought it was great! Hubby was skeptical but took seconds and said it was really good. We will make this again. Also, since I only used 1 lb it was done in 40 mins. Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I doubled the salsa and added cilantro to it. Used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute and it was perfect! I got chunk pineapple and just diced it and it worked perfectly for the salsa and the loaf. Thanks for the recipe. Like other raters I only needed to cook it for an hour to be done.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband doesn't particularly care for turkey meat, but even he liked this.  Make more of the pineapple mixture as you are sure to want more than the recipe proportion calls for.  Leftovers good cold for lunch the next day, or even as a sandwich.

This meatloaf is excellent! I changed a few things though. I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and 3/4 c. egg substitute and a 16 oz. can crushed pineapple. I let the oatmeal soak up the egg and 1 c. of pineapple. For the sauce, I doubled the ingredients and didn't have a jalapeno so instead used a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also heated the sauce in a microwave for 1 min. This was fabulous! I will make it again!

Delicious, so moist and the picante is something I would never think of, It is awesome! The only thing I didn't have on hand was soy sauce, inplace I used a Merlot Sauce(there is soy sauce in it..at least). I can not wait to make this again. Great recipe Frances!!!!!

Tastes ok and is definitely simple enough to make, but I am only giving it 4 stars because it's plain. Tastes the same as turkey loaf without the pineapple and all the other spices. The sauce is more like a relish and it doesn't complement the meatloaf very well.

I was suprised by how good this was. I was planning on giving any leftovers to my parents to take home since I hate turkey, but I really liked it and kept the leftovers for myself! I used panko breadcrumbs and 2 whole eggs and the texture was lovely. It is better the next day...and the salsa is better the second day. Next time I would double the salsa recipe and make it a day in advance. I would add more pineapple to the top of the loaf before cooking too. It even tastes good with ketchup when you run out of the salsa. It took mine less than 1 hour to register 180 degrees, so you may want to keep an eye on it while it cooks.

My family loved this recipe!!!  Awesome way to reduce fat with a Turkey recipe without sacrificing flavor.  I substituted Egg Replacer for the Egg substitute because my little one is allergic to eggs.  Still came out awesome!!!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone liked it.  I only had a pound of turkey but didn't realize I should have used less of everything else until it was in the oven. It was still really good and will make again.  I didn't have all the ingrediants for the sauce, no green onions or jalapeno's and I used lemon juice instead of lime but overall it was tasty and will make again, thanks!

This was really good. I do recommend that you double (if not triple or quadruple) the salsa called for at the end. It is really good on the meatloaf and also mixed in with some jasmine rice. The leftovers are not nearly as good without the salsa, hence 4 instead of 5 stars.

I was quite surprised by how this recipe turned out, it was delicous. My husband commented that it tasted almost like egg roll filling, but in a good way. I substituted bread crumbs with crackers, and since it's just the two of us, cut the recipe in half and baked in a muffin pan for mini-meatloafs. Great recipe!

The first time I made this, it tasted really awful, so I brainstormed and decided to make a few changes to the recipe. I remade it and it tasted extremely good, better than anything I've had before. 

I substituted egg for the egg substitute and sweetened crushed pineapple for the unsweetened crush pineapple. I added a cup of wet bread crumbs instead of dry bread crumbs and I added a teaspoon of lemon juice instead of lime juice. It turned out great and I've made it three more times since then!

This was amazing! The only change I made was to add ketchup to the pineapple before putting it on the meatloaf before baking.
