This is a really easy recipe that tastes great. We added some shredded carrots and chopped cherry tomatoes for color. The coleslaw is flavorful and refreshing.

Holy Cow! This recipe is amazing! i have been looking for a good coleslaw recipe and tried this one. I usually go with recipes with more reviews (this one only had 6 but 6 good ones) on this site but i went with my gut and made this one. My favorite coleslaw I've ever had, hands down! I used the pre-shredded coleslaw mix and it was perfect. Definitely use fresh basil and dill. Highly recommend it!

So delicious!  I used brocolli slaw and also didn't use the sugar and it was perfect for my taste- since I don't like sweet slaws.  Also I subbed half plain yogurt for half of the mayo and it was light tasting.  Will make all through summer!

This was a really nice change.  I love basil.  I did cut the sugar to 2 T., because I don't like sweet things.  I'll make this again.

Instead of just cabbage I also add carrott,celery & cucumbers...red cabbage adds a nice colour too.Flavours are great for this dressing,I didn't have 1/2 & 1/2 so just used fat free sour cream...& if ya like a lil kick add a bit of horseradish.This recipe is definately a keeper.

Excellent, I can't say thank you enough for posting.  I am tired of purchasing bottled coleslaw dressings and having them expire!!!  This dressing is number 1.  Everyone must try this out.  You will not be disappointed!  Since I did not have cider vinegar.  I used 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 apple juice.  Worked out great!

This is a great recipe! I did change a few things, I added shredded carrots and a dash of salt, cut back the suger to 1.5T and added 3/4cup mayo instead of a 1/2cup. I will definately make this again! quick and easy!

This was my first time making coleslaw, and it was great. My husband says he doesn't like coleslaw, but this was good. I added some chopped green onion.

I didn't really care for cole slaw in general, but I was obliged to make this to go with some pulled pork. I could not stop eating this stuff. I am converted. The fresh herbs give it flavor and aroma that's missing in plain cole slaw.

This was excellent as it was. I used fresh basil and dried dill as I didn't have fresh. The double batch bowl was empty. Nuff said.

It didn't taste like much at all. I love basil but it doesn't come through very well and this dish just doesn't work.

Loved this! I made this in a pinch and only had dried basil and dill, and it was still amazing! Can't wait to try it with fresh herbs. One note, make the night before- the flavors really meld the second day it's in the fridge.

This was good.  I used a bag of ready coleslaw mix, added some shredded carrots and a little extra cabbage.  It needed the carrots for color.  I only used 2T of sugar and probably used more like 3.5-4T of fresh basil.  I think it was a little too much because the basil is very prominent.  I will definitely use this again but cut back on the fresh basil or try some dried instead.  Thanks!

For a simple, no frills coleslaw this was great! the only negative comment I got was that I didn't chop the cabbage fine enough. The recipe said "Shredded" but at home I didn't have anythign to shred it with, so as a first time homemade (from a cabbage not a bag) slaw maker, I didn't cut the cabbage thin enough. So next time I will really chop it to get it as fine as possible!

This was very delicious! Followed the recipe except for adding in a few finely chopped green onions (I like onions in coleslaw). The flavors blended together wonderfully. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Used only one tablespoon of sugar (still plenty sweet for me) - loved the recipe and will use it lots.  Even added a bit of green peppercorns to one serving, liked it all the more.

I have to be careful not to eat too much.  This is great.  I used one head of cabbage and a carrot in the Cuisinart, half the amount of dry basil and half the amount dry dill.  I really think this is great.

LOVE this and could eat it all day! Everyone I've made it for has raved about it. I used red cabbage and about half the mayo to make it a little fresher, less sweet.

EXCELLENT.  The only diff thing I did was instead of using 1/2 c mayo I used a mixture of organic yogurt and light mayo.  I also only put in about 3 pinches of sugar.  Only after 3 hours of chilling it was fabulous - probably will be even better tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe June.

I liked it.  It's different than a typical coleslaw, which is why I wanted to try it.  I didn't love it, but I liked it.
