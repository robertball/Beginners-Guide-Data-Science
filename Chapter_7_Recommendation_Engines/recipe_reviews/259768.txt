Super easy to make but... I wouldn't call these fajitas. I did use homemade taco seasoning because I didn't have packet taco seasoning (but had fajita seasoning) and it works in a pinch. I also used a full 16 oz jar of salsa. I served with corn tortillas, and regular taco toppings. My taco loving family loved them.

I will most likely make it again. This is a good recipe when you're on a tight budget and trying to shelf cook. Its filling and you can reuse leftovers on nachos. I am giving it 3 stars because it's just okay it feels as though it's lacking something.

I added diced jalapenos and lime juice before cooking. This isn't really fajitas by itself but if you add peppers and onions after cooking it makes a really good fajita

My husband who is usually not fond of this type of dish loved it. Of course I did use the mildest type of salsa I had on hand. I do agree with that this is an easy dish with using pantry items.
