While I'm sure this bread is perfectly delicious on its own, the couple of changes I made took this to stand out memorable! First, don't beat the zucchini with the oil, sugar and egg. Just add it to that mixture, then stir in the flour mixture till blended. I used a full tablespoon of lemon zest, and added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Once the bread was done, I let it cool in the pan 10 minutes. Meanwhile, I made a glaze of 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice. I heated it till boiling to dissolve the sugar, then removed it from the heat. I removed the bread from the pan and brushed on the glaze, continuing to reapply it as it was absorbed. (Didn't poke holes in the top as I didn't want HOLES in the top!) This glaze made a beautiful, shiny top, and infused the bread with both moisture and incredibly delicious lemon zing! Outstanding.

We loved this recipe. I made a few changes, because I wanted to make it super guilt free. Used whole wheat flour in place of white, instead of the oil and white sugar, I used 1/4 cup honey (gave it a wonderful, homey smell and taste), 1/4 brown sugar (a little less...I don't like it too sweet) and added chopped pecans. I have also tried adding 1 1/2 cups shredded carrot, which also turned out great. Fool-proof, delicious and easy to make substitutions. I love it! Thank you for sharing!

Just as wonderful the second time I made it! Should have followed my own advice & doubled the recipe.Because I love lemon and cinnamon, I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. Thanks  REBECITA: a winner!

This is a great recipe, I have added lemon zest to my zucchini bread for years. The only changes I did make was to substitute the oil with applesauce and add a quarter cup of chopped walnuts. Still very delicious, moist and much less fattening!! Thanks Rebecita.

I loved this!  I made it as muffins, some mini (cooked 10-12 minutes) and some regular sized (cooked 20-22 minutes) In some of them I added pecans and craisins, some I used glaze on and some not, and added 3/4 cup grated carrot to the recipe once when I made it, substituted 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce once....good any way you make it!

AWESOME! What a great idea adding lemon zest. My hubby and I agree that this is the best zucchini bread we've ever had. I added a little vanilla and chopped walnuts to the batter, then made a lemon glaze to pour over the bread as soon as it came out of the oven. Out of this world!

I love this recipe. I added shredded carrot and also 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper to make the bread subtly spicy. Also substituted applesauce and whole wheat flour. This got rave reviews at a party I brought it to, thanks!

This is definitely a keeper!  I like alot of cinnamon so I used 2 teaspoons instead of 1.  I also used about 4 teaspoons of lemon zest and 2 Tbsp of lemon juice.  I thought this was a perfect combination and will make this often.  Great recipe!

My grandmother always used to make zucchini breads and I love the lemony flavor of this one!  I used half brown sugar and half white and added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter.  I also followed the advice of naples34102 and did a lemon glaze: 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. of lemon juice heated until just boiling to dissolve the sugar and then take it off the heat.  I made two of these - one for us and one to give to a new neighbor.

This was a very tasty zuchinni bread.  The lemon did add a nice flavor.  Even my 4 year old liked it, and he doesn't like anything.  I followed the recipe as directed.

This is THE BEST zucchini i've ever had!  I did some modifications and doubled the recipe for two loaves as one just isn't enought!  I put in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and i also zested a whole lemon (not sure how much zest that equates) and i also used the glaze that another reviewer used and it was absolutly HEAVEN!!!!  I also didn't sift the flour, used the whole wheat flour instead, baked both loaves together for about 20 minutes longer then the stated time and they came out soooo delicious and moist and wonderfully heavy like a pound cake, it was just PERFECT!!  I can't wait to make these again!

Too much zucchini!  The bread was too dense!  I was too lazy to dig up my old bread recipe and tried this one.  All three times I did and the bread did not rise.  The taste was good but it was like a dense brick.  I found my old recipe and it calls for 1 c of zucchini only.  I tried that and it came out perfect.

This was pretty good.  We liked the combination of the cinnamon/lemon flavors.  I was a little shy on lemon zest, so I added 1/4 t. lemon extract.  The biggest negative I see with this recipe is the baking time and temp.  At 325 degrees, my loaf was not even close to being done after 45 minutes.  I had to bake this at least another 15-20 minutes.  I would recommend baking this at 350 degrees and begin checking at around 45 minutes.   If I were to make this again, I’d add some chopped pecans or walnuts – didn’t seem right not to have that little bit of crunch.

A different take on your usual zucchini bread has several things going for it. First, the flavor is superb. The lemon is subtle, but you know it's there. Secondly, it's delightfully moist. I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda, as I'm always trying to cut down on sugar content. Used only 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I found that mine needed about 55 minutes to be completely baked through. It's true that this doesn't rise a whole lot during the baking process. The picture is an accurate portrayal of what you can expect.  Not a huge loaf, but as the saying goes, "Good things come in small packages." Unusual and fabulous!

We thought this was very tasty.  I baked mine in a bundt cake pan; it only made a short bundt cake, but this was the test batch anyway. For anyone who is wondering, double this recipe for a regular bundt cake or tube pan. I made some substitutions: I exchanged 1/4c. of oil for 1/4c. applesauce (used oil for the other 1/4c. to make a full 1/2c.). I put around 1.5 tsps of cinnamon, and I put however much zest a large lemon produces in it, minus a tiny bit that I used to make a glaze. I took the advice of reviewer naples34102 and made a glaze of simple syrup & lemon juice & zest and basted my cake in it after I popped it out of the pan. While mine did not make a shiny glaze like I was hoping for, what it did do was make a delicious tart layer of goodness on the outside of the bread! I will certainly make this again experimenting with carrots, apples, raisins, nuts, and orange-lime-grapefruit zests/juices/glazes! Thank you for an excellent zucchini recipe that is easy to love!

Spectacular!!! I added 2 cups of zucchini and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, as well as, a 1/4 cup of applesauce & 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil instead of the 1/2 cup of veggie oil. I also used an extra tsp of cinnamon and substituted the white flour for whole wheat. What a beautiful loaf this is! This is one to be used for many years to come! Thanks Rebecita! **UPDATE** I also tried using the zest from an orange and its wonderful!!

Tasty.  I used lime zest instead of lemon on accident (sneaky yellow limes). Still quite good.

I made a couple of changes to this recipe that still tasted pretty good.  Rather than using 3/4 sugar, I used 3/8 cup of the Splenda sugar blend for baking.  I also added 1/2 pint of blueberries.  I added the blueberries last, and lighted coated them with flour so they wouldn't all sink to the bottom.

I'm so glad I decided to make this! I wasn't sure if I would like lemon and zucchini together but it turned out really good.I decided to add blueberries to mine and I'm glad I did because they were delicious in this.The blueberries went really well with the zucchini and lemon.I used applesauce in place of half the oil and it still turned out very moist.I sprinked a little brown sugar on my three mini loaves before baking and my husband loved that.He kept asking me what I put on the top.I'll definately be keeping this recipe!

My family loves this bread! After reading the reviews, I changed a few things. We doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves. I used the zest of one whole lemon and added the juice of the lemon to the wet ingredients before mixing. I also used half oil & half applesauce to cut the fat. I did npt have any cinnamon, so substituted vanilla. Two wonderful additions were dried cranberries and walnuts - yum! I also threw in about 1/4 cup of ground flax seed to increase the healthiness. After the loaves came out of the oven, I drizzled them with a lemon juice/sugar glaze to give them that little extra touch. Delish!!!

I've made this a couple of times and everyone loves it.  The only variance I make to the recipe is to glaze the bread with a combo of 6 Tbls powdered sugar and the juice of one lemon while the bread is still warm.  Wonderful!!

Moist and delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  I did have to bake it a good bit longer and turn up the heat a bit, but the end result was wonderful.

This is delicious bread!  My co-workers raved about it when I brought some in.  The only substitute I made was 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 cup oil.  I'm sure that wouldn't cause too much of a difference in taste.  This will be my go-to recipe for Zucchini Bread!

This recipe was fabulous! I did use a whole tablespoon of lemon and I glazed it lightly. It made it a little more dessert like. Without the glaze I think you could serve it for brunch! Since I'm using my zucchini surplus I made 4 of these.  For 2 I added fresh blueberries (liberally) and it was even better!

Excellent recipe!  I've been making zucchini bread for many years and this is by far the best.  I doubled the recipe and added chopped nuts.  I'm making several copies of the recipe to pass around.  Thanks for sharing.

Lemon and zucchini, now you are talking! This bread is INCREDIBLE!!! I have added 2x as much zest but kept all other ingredients the same. I also use a cheese cloth to squeeze the extra moisture from the zucchini just after grading it. EVERYONE who has it wants the recipe! I make this bread when zucchinis are flooding the farmer's market in the summer. Also, it freezes wonderfully so you can have it later! YUMMY!

This is the best zucchini bread I have ever had. The only changes I made was to use 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and I used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour. It is excellent, thanks!

This is the BEST zucchini bread I've ever had!  Like the other reviewers, I added more lemon zest and the juice of one lemon.  It's very moist and light.  Perfect way to use up the extra zucchini from the garden (and actually the ONLY way I can get my kids to eat it!)  THANKS!

This was great.  I did not want to use so much oil so used half the oil and added unsweetened apple sauce.  Also, use Agave nectar instead of sugar and used half while flour and half whole wheat flour.  Really enjoyed this dish!!

A yummy zucchini bread recipe! I really enjoyed the citrusy component of the cake - so different from the recipes I've made before. I followed the addition Naples used too: dissolved sugar into lemon juice and used it as a glaze for the top...an extra pop of flavor that was quite a special touch!

Made it a couple of times, it's so good!!! I put a little more zucchini (like a little more than 2 cups) and a lot more lemon (the zest of 2 or 3 lemons... I really like lemony things ;) ) and a little bit of lemon juice... I omitted the cinnamon.  My mom loves this!

My grandchildren LOVED this -- even AFTER their Poppie told them that there was zucchini in it!  It is very light and flavorful.  I made it with half Splenda and half sugar because of dietary restrictions but it is still great!  The second time I used lime juice and zest instead of lemon and it was absolutely amazing!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great!  I printed this recipe off a couple years ago and I always make it this time of year.  I substitute butter for the veg. oil and it turns out great.  You can also add in some other spices that are typical 'pumpkin' spices.

I grow zucchini in my backyard so this is a fantastic way to use it! I made it a lot healthier by using egg substitute, substituting the oil with organic applesauce, and using organic whole wheat flour and sugar, and adding walnuts. The nuts and whole wheat give it a nutty flavor so you don't need all that oil. This healthier version has gotten rave reviews.

One of the best Z-breads we've ever made, and so simple! Light, not dense or doughy, holds together for toast, hint of lemon, just wonderful. I didn't have enough white sugar so 1/2 was brown sugar. Gave it a beautiful color. I also added 1/4 t.pumpkin pie spice because we love it. I would have put pecans in it but since my 11 yr. old daughter was making it, and said no, I didn't push it. :) This might be the only Z-bread recipe we use this summer! Thanks!

makes an excellent and moist loaf of bread. everybody who tried it liked it! Didn't have lemon zest, so used real lemon juice and a tsp of rind. Also added 2tsp vanilla just for fun. Lemon flavor was a bit understated still though. thanks for this new recipe!

I made two different zucchini breads this being the second I tried.  My husband ate some of the first and declared it delicious and then had some of this one.  This one was fantastic!  I've made it several times already this week and it disappears quickly.  I've never been a lemon fan but I really like this too.  Thanks!

My family and I loved it! We grow zucchini in our garden every year and always end up with tons of them. We all love zucchini bread so I love to try new recipes. I have to say this is probably one of my favorites so far. I also used honey in mine and the juice from one of the lemons, plus increased the zest amount. It added such a fresh, summer taste to it. By far one of the most most I've ever had! Thank you for sharing!

I followed naples34102 review, but added zest of one smaller lemon, along with vanilla extract.  Folded zucchini in at the end, instead of the beginning.  Gotta say, love the lemon flavor!!  Keeper recipe!!

Delicious, added extra flavor 2TBSP lemon zest, 1TBSP fresh lemon juice, half whole wheat flour and instead of sugar 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 Agave Nectar.  I baked 1 small loaf and rest muffins to which I added poppy seeds.  Muffins baked 20 minutes, loaf baked 45 minutes.  My husband said these are the best and no sugar.  thanks for recipe.

At the urging of so many reviewers, I added the juice of a large lemon.  I also used half white sugar, half brown.  Although I really liked the taste, I LOVED the texture.

I tripled the recipe, added 2 more eggs, used half peanut oil and half applesauce, 1/3 white sugar with 2/3 brown sugar. The 12 muffins came out of the oven about 15 minutes ago, 2 mini loaf pans should be ready in about 2 minutes. and 2 regular loaf pans in about 20 more minutes. I did drop the oven temperature to 350 degrees because I have the convection turned on. Just finished a very moist, scrumptious muffin. This recipe is a keeper. My mother usually glazes her zucchini bread but this one definitely does not need it!

Yum, so good!  Hubby liked it too.  Made as directed.  Love the lemon flavor, what a great addition.  Next time I'll make two loaves to help use up my abundant garden zuchini!  Thanks for sharing!

Completely delicious. Like others, I substituted applesauce instead of the oil. I also added a little nutmeg and vanilla extract. It turned out moist and full of flavor!

EXCELLENT!!! LOOK NO FURTHER THIS IS THE ONE!  I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour and added 2tbs water.  Also, reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and sustituted some oil using 1/4 c veg oil and 1/4 of greek yogurt....read other reviews and highly recommend a lemon glaze on top(1/2c granulated sugar and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice bring to a boil to dissolve sugar then remove from heat)

I used the rind from a whole orange as I didn't have a lemon. I subbed whole wheat flour for a third of the white flour and applesauce for half the oil.  I did add 1/2 tsp of allspice.I baked this for at least a half hour longer than the recipe stated, but then I was baking 2 loaves. While the loaf raised nicely and tasted very good, I didn't think this anything new or different.

I did half applesauce, half oil, other than that I followed the directions exactly. This was delicious and moist! I will DEFINITELY make again (especially I have a lemon tree and an overabundance of zucchini!). I did end up cooking it a bit longer than suggested, but I just watched it and waited til the top looked brown and did the toothpick test.

I made this just the way it was written, except used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar. It was the best zucchini bread I've ever had. The lemon really adds a nice touch.  I have a feeling I'll be wearing a hole in my mixing bowl with this one :)

I would actually give this recipe only two stars if it weren't for my boyfriend who is really enjoying the loaf. For me, it was too heavy on the oil and not enough sweetness or lemon. But that's just my taste. The loaf turned out well according to recipe, it's just not for me!

I made this with double the lemon zest and poured a lemon glaze over it while it was cooling. It came out delicious and very lemony, which is what I was aiming for(next time I may even omit the cinnamon). Thanks for this recipe- this is my new absolute favorite zucchini bread!

This is just the right combination of flavors.  I always make this recipe with the abundance of zucchini during the summer.  I cut the oil in half and use applesauce.  The glaze on top adds a nice tartness to the bread.  I have given this as gifts and everyone is always surprised to hear what it is, but they love it.

I wish I could review this without rating, because I made alterations which probably contributed to the taste. I used whole wheat flour, splenda, & applesauce rather than oil. It tastes strongly of the ww flour, sadly. Everyone besides me ate it and liked it.

Followed the recipe exactly but did put a lemon glaze over it after it was done. It was wonderful. My 10 year old daughter made a second loaf that we took to a party. Everyone commented on how good it was and they all loved the lemon in it! Thanks

Very Delicious. i made it for my family for breakfast and they all loved it. made one loaf with oil the other with apple sauce and everyone agreed the one with apple sauce was better and more moist. i didn't have and lemon zest so i splashed in some lemon juice and the bread was fantastic. will make again.

This was an interesting twist on zucchini bread, but I was expecting it to be more sweet and lemony, I guess like a lemon cake. I did add quite a bit more lemon juice and zest than the recipe called for, but still, a little bland. I used the lemon glaze, which I thought was the best part. I think I would add more sugar if I were going to make this recipe again. My coworkers seemed to really like it though, so perhaps it's just me and my sweet tooth.

This recipe makes a frangrant, moist, delicious bread.  I do not claim to be a baker, but recipes like this make it easy.  I did fold in 2 cups of grated zucchini after I blended the egg/sugar mixture as well as 1 cup chopped walnuts.  The only problem I had was with the cooking time.  I had to bake mine @ 325 for 55 to 58 minutes, it was not done at 45 minutes.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks!

Good and very moist.  I tried the lemon glaze suggested by another reviewer(thinking it would be an extra special goodness treat that way), but my hubby said that was the only part he DIDN'T like (and he likes lemon).  Otherwise, he said this was the best zucchini bread he EVER had.  I personally think I would've liked a little more zucchini and less cinn, but that's not a complaint by any means (also adding more zuch might make the batter too moist).

Instead of 1/2 cup of oil, I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce.  As others recommended, I added 1 tbsp of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  Also, I modified the sugar to 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. This zucchini bread came out moist and delicious with a nice hint of lemon!

This is wonderful! I added 2 tbl lemon rind and about the same of juice. My son didn't want to try it but when he had a taste of mine he ended up having 3 slices, saying it was the best zucchini loaf he'd ever had! Will be making more this weekend!

Wow! I really did think that I had the best recipe ever.. until I tried this one! I did what Naples suggested in a previous post and made the simple syrup what I brushed on until it was all absorbed. My husband LOVED this recipe and shared it at work~ And they loved it! Do yourself a favor and try this recipe. The addition of fresh lemon brings out a freshness in this bread that can't be beat!

Very easy, good bread. I took other's suggestions and used applesauce in place of oil, added extra cinnamon, and used 1 cup squash and 1 cup chopped apples. Very tasty.

This is a very simple recipe and can be altered easily.  I use 2 cups of zucchini instead of 1.5, substitute whole wheat flour for the white, and use organic brown sugar.  No matter which substitutions I have made, it always turns out great.  Thanks for the recipe.  I plan to keep this one.

Delish! I recommend adding more lemon zest and/or a tbsp of lemon juice if you want more of a lemon taste. As is, it's just a hint. Same goes for the cinnamon. And zucchini for that matter! I added walnuts and that gave it a nice crunch and increased the nutrition. Yum!

To those who had to cook it a lot longer/shorter....check your oven temperature.

Loved this recipe, my 2 year old did too. I am about to bring it to the nursing home for my grandparents!!! They will love this. I made mini loves instead of one big one, so they could be brought to family/friends. Each batch makes 3 mini loves.I also added about 1/2 tsp. of apple pie spice .  tastes great!!
  YUM YUM!!

This was excellent!  I also added 1 extra tsp of cinnamon, a couple drops of vanilla, 2 tsp fresh lemon juice, and topped it with a glaze of powdered sugar/lemon juice.  Even with the extra lemon, the lemony-flavor was pretty subtle.  Next time I will probably use even more lemon.  
Thanks for the recipe!!

Alright, I'm giving this four stars only because I felt it to be on the doughy side. "Not your Mother's Pumpkin Bread" still blows the pants off this recipe, But, I did like the lemony taste.

The lemon makes a nice change and went well with the yellow flecks from the summer squash that I used.  I did find myself wishing for some walnuts, though.

Turned out fabulous, but I did a vegan version since my son has a severe food allergy to egg. I subbed an overripe banana previously frozen then thawed for the egg (I do this often with baking of all kinds, it always works great). Then I increased the sugar to 2 cups to please the family sweet - tooth (we cannot relate to all the folks on here that say they don't like it too sweet!). Then used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup organic white because it's what I had around. I also left out the lemon because I didn't have any and couldn't get to the store, and even though everyone said it was the key ingredient, it STILL turned out delicious! Next time I will do everything the same except I'll plan ahead, get lemons, and make a double batch so that I have enough to share!

Great easy recipe. I made a low fat version using 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to replace the oil. I also used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar to replace the 3/4 cup white sugar. I calculated calorie count and 1 slice (remember serves 12) is 103 calories. It made 24 mini muffins, 2 muffins per serving.

It had good flavor but it was soooooo moist and thick  and it didn't taste done. I cooked it for 15 minutes longer than the recipe said but even thou it was in fact cooked all the way through it, it still had the consistency of dough.. Some people commented saying it was possibly too much oil but I haven't tried to make anymore so I I'm not quite sure...

This was a nice change from the normal zucchini bread I make. I really enjoyed the flavor the lemon zest gave. I doubled the batch, since I have a mountain of zucchini to use, and used 3 eggs by accident (that's what my other recipe calls for) I replaced most of the oil with plain yogurt, which makes a really moist yummy loaf. I also added 1/4 tsp of almond extract which really enhances the lemon flavor...I will be making this often!

Good, easy recipe for zucchini bread.  Sent a loaf with my husband to work and it got good reviews.  It probably wasn't my favorite zucchini bread recipes, but still very good.

This is a super moist bread, and very tasty.  I doubled the recipe, and used additional cinnamon, lemon zest, and lemon juice.  I also substituted honey and brown sugar for the white sugar, and used a combination of whole wheat and all purpose flour.  I also doubled the baking powder.

I made this using "one ball" squash from my garden last night, which I have in spades right now.  I doubled the recipe and substituted 1/2 c. of butter for half of the oil and the bread turned out delicious and moist.  I also used lime zest instead of lemon (it's what I had) and squeezed the juice from half of the lime into the batter as well to combat the strong squashiness of my one balls.  The doubled recipe needed about an hour in the oven.  I will definitely make this again.

This bread came out very moist and has a lovely appearance, i.e., the bits of zucchini and lemon zest make it look interesting.  My first loaf came out a bit flattish.  I may have over beaten the batter once I added the dry ingredients.  I'm not giving 5 stars only because I, too, found it slightly bland in flavor.  I'll definitely make this again, but will tinker with the cinnamon and/or lemon zest a bit.  Thanks for sharing!

This came out very moist and fluffy-I did add lemon juice because I didn't want to waste the rest of the lemon; which made it very lemony.  Just out of curiosity will try as written next time to see how it comes out with only zest. I might actually like it better if it were more subtle?  This bread is not too sweet and very good!

Wonderful results and yummy! I'm a fan of lemon flavouring and this is the perfect balance. I did decrease the zucchini to 1 cup only though just for personal preferance. Thank you for sharing this :)

So many great reviews! But I was truly disappointed. I should have substituted something different for the oil. The texture of the bread was just not nice, and the taste was just kind of bland. I followed the recipe exactly. I know there were many reviews that included changes, but I don't think this basic recipe is worth trying with alterations. I will try another recipe next time.

This is great.  I swapped a few things, I swapped half the oil for applesauce, used orange peel (plan on trying lemon next.)  Also, cut the sugar about a half a cup.  Yummy.  The citrus really showed this bread off to the max.  I plan on making this again.

This was just ok for me.  The lemon is good in it and it is moist, we just prefer our own zucchini recipe that I always use.  Just wanted to try something different.  I made it exactly like the recipe said.  It's a little bland.  Won't try again.

This is a favorite new find now that I've made at least 6 loaves. To start, I had to omit the cinnamon due to allergies, but I also cut back the sugar to 1/3 c. You could probably drop it further to 1/4 cup. I also added about an extra 1/4-1/2 c. of shredded zucchini, plus the zest of one whole medium lemon, and used canola oil with a splash of good quality extra virgin olive oil to equal 1/2 c. A bit of olive oil really compliments the lemon and zucchini. This recipe is surprisingly light tasting compared to most zucchini breads that rely on even more fat, sugar and spices that overpower zucchini as the feature ingredient!

I thought it was good, but the family didn't....I subbed 1/2 c of applesauce as other users did, and 1/4 c of oil....used whole wheat flour and it was very tasty!  The family didn't care for it though....

Thanks Rebecita for a wonderful recipe! I made minor changes: I used the glaze suggested by naples34102 and also increased the lemon zest as she suggested. I cut the cinnamon in half and replaced half the oil with unsweetened applesauce. The fat was not missed, which is great because I am not a fan of low fat baked goods. This zucchini bread is hard to beat! Update: I have made this bread several times and it always gets rave reviews. I have several friends that are very good home bakers and even THEY asked for the recipe! If I could give this 6 stars, I would!

This was pretty good, but my family all agreed plain zucchini bread is better.  The lemon and cinnamon together just didn't seem right to me.  I made two loaves and tried a lemon glaze over one, but it still wasn't lemony enough.  It just tasted like normal zucchini bread with lemon in it.  I still gave it 4 stars because the loaves disappeared quickly at the potluck I took them to.

This is simple, quick and easy to make. I had oranges not lemons and it was very good with that. I am not much of a cook, but can see I can make a spicy, or a blueberry version easily. I used 2 cups of zucchini as another reviewer said.

Very Tasty! The lemon was nice in it. I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chopped pecans to mine. (didn't measure) I think I'll make this next time I have people over. Again, very very yummy!

Can someone please tell me, is this bread supposed to be eaten with a meal or as a sweet something with a cup of coffee. It is very nice but it is sweet.

This was great the first time I made it, but something was off the second.  Did I add a couple tablespoons lemon juice the first time?  Might have overcooked it the second time because it was much moister the first.

I can't even count how many times I made this over the summer! So good. I made a few changes to make it healthier:

whole wheat pastry flour instead of white,

1/4c raw sugar and 1/4c honey instead of white sugar,

fill 1/2c with 2TBS canola oil and the rest with applesauce,

zest one full lemon and juice 1/2 lemon,

1tsp vanilla extract. Sometimes I also add grated carrot and flaxseed. So delicious warm out of the oven with a touch of butter!

We always have a bumper crop of zucchini so any appealing recipe is appreciated.  I (the kitchen-challenged husband) have made this recipe several times with excellent results.  

We live at 5500 feet and that may be why we've got to extend baking time 10' or so.  

Also, I added pecans to today's two loaves and they make a nice variation.  I could only find salted pecans in the grocery, so I washed the salt off before tossing them in.  

Finally, is there a reason to use a second bowl for the flour-baking soda-bakingpowder-cinnamon addition.  I just put them in the flour sifter and sifted directly into the first bowl.  Of course the lemon zest should be added to the first bowl, not the flour sifter.  ;-)

P.S. With the oil, the sugar, and the pecans this is *not* a low-cal production!

This is my fave zucchini bread recipe so far! I only changed the white flour to white whole wheat flour and didn't quite add all of the sugar. I had to use lemon juice since I didn't have fresh lemons and it still tasted great! Next time I'll try using applesauce instead of oil to make it even healthier:)

First let me tell you that I picked the biggest zucchini I have ever seen in our garden!  We thought growing season was over so we didnt bother with them anymore until three weeks later when we went out to rip out the plants!  It was 19 inches long and 14 inches around!!! With that said, I made this recipe!!!  Made just a few minor changes - I made muffins instead of the loaf and only baked them for 30 minutes.  I used apple sauce instead of oil (heathier), put walnuts on top before baking and when they were done baking and all cool, I put a lemon glaze on top!  DELISH!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

REDUCED FAT VERSION:  Great recipe! I used half the amount of oil and replaced it with applesauce.  You'd never taste the difference--plus, it increased the bread's moisture.  Easy to make and just the perfect hint of lemon.  Delicious!

Flavor is excellent.  Timer was turned off during baking, so I had no idea how long it baked.  Came out a bit undercooked.  I added 1/2 teaspoon allspice and the zest of an entire lemon.  Also used 1 Tbs canola oil in a 1/2 measuring cup and filled the rest of way with unsweetened applesauce.  Only used 1/2 cup sugar.  Love the lemon zucchini bread more than the orange.

This recipe is great. delicious and moist. So simple that my 9 year-old daughter likes to make it and take it when we visit friends. I've also tried it with lime zest and it's just as good.

I really love this bread!  The zucchini flavor is not overwhelming and the cinnamon and lemon zest add just the right touch of spice.  Really delicious!  I made this intending to freeze for later and my husband ate half the loaf as soon as it came out of the oven!

Nice twist on the old standby. I did add the juice of the lemon that I got the zest from. Didn't measure the zest, just used the zest of one lemon. Added a t of vanilla. Used the glaze that one of the reviewers suggested (the most helpful positive review). This is a nice gift bread. I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

Good recipie but as others have said, baking time should be more than an hour!  Also, I did not care for the cinnamon. Just like ketchup (aka sauce américaine), it covers up all other flavors. The cinnamon in this recipie overpowered the lovely flavor of the lemon zest (and I only used 1/4 tspn cinnamon and the zest of 2 large lemons). In a recipie like this, simpler is better. No cinnamon for me!

I made this recipe with gluten free flour, so I decreased the flour by 1/4 cup, added 1 egg, and decreased the oil by 1/4 cup.  I put the batter in muffin pans so I wouldn't eat the whole loaf in one setting.  :)  They were delicious!  I would agree with another review: I think I might add a little more zucchini next time. Two thumbs up!

PERFECT recipe!  I can't believe its not rated with 5 stars!  I've tried my hand at a few zucchini bread recipes and this one, by far is the best!!!!  The lemon zest adds the perfect essence of flavor and this is definitely the only zucchini bread recipe I will make.  Super easy and super delicious!!!  Everyone loves it!

Amazingly light and flavorful, the lemon gives it a unique tang and the glaze gets your attention! I've made it twice and had to double the recipe this last time.

For an orange-mint variation, I substituted orange zest for the lemon, doubled the quantity of zest, and added a handful of fresh chopped mint. Also gave it a squirt of lemon juice. Yum!! Thank you for this fantastic recipe--moist and rose beautifully.

Very good. I did add a tablespoon of lemon zest and also a couple of Tbsp. of fresh lem0n juice. Other than that I followed the recipe. I made muffins and baked for 20 minutes. I did add a lemon glaze as other suggested. I couldn't stop eating this.

I follwed the advice of another reviewed and made a glaze of 1/4 c lemon juice and 1/2 c sugar (boil until sugar is dissolved, then drip on bread until absorbed/covered). I think I may have left too much liquid in the zucchini because it needed an extra 1/2 hour to cook, but it was absolutely wonderful. LOVE the lemon with it!

Tried today.  Followed the directions and It is awful.  BIG waste of ingredients and time.  The only thing I changed was using splenda instead of sugar.  Will need to go back to old family recipe.

Fantastic!  I replaced most of the oil with apple sauce and used 1/2 wheat 1/2 white flour for a healthier version.  I made muffins instead of a loaf for easier baking and kept them in for about 16 minutes.

This is an excellent recipe just as it is. This is my go-to zucchini bread recipe although I usually make muffins instead of bread. I gave this recipe to my mother & she loves it too. Can't wait for zucchini season each year!

This was amazing! I followed suggestions that others made - don't beat the zucchini with the wet ingredients. Just add it to that mixture, then stir in the flour mixture till blended. I used a full tablespoon of lemon zest, and added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.

OMG, this is soooo yummy! I like my pumpkin/banana/zucchini breads to be super-moist and not too "bread-y," so I used 2 small zucchini (about 1/2 cup more than the recipe calls for) and substituted unsweetened applesauce for half the oil...I didn't measure the lemon zest either, just zested one whole lemon. YIKES! Utterly, sinfully, irresistably delicious! THANK YOU for sharing this recipe; I will never need to search for another! :)

I didn't have lemon zest, but this seemed like a good base recipe so I thought I'd give it a try.  I also liked that this is proportioned for one loaf.
I substituted brown sugar for the white, used 1/2 cup multigrain flour with 1 cup unbleached AP flour, and added 1/2 cup chopped frozen cranberries and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. My zucchini was about 1 cup drained, after defrosting (I grate it and freeze it in one cup measures when in season).
It took 1 hour at 350F to bake fully, in an 8 x 4 pan.  The loaf has a nice texture, not heavy or too dense, and the cranberries offset the sweetness, which I'm guessing the lemon zest would do as well.
I will definitely try this one again and use the lemon zest, and maybe throw in some blueberries or raspberries next time.

My kids love this zucchini bread and they are extremely picky eaters.   I do not keep lemon zest on hand, so i just add a little lemon juice to it.  Also, I have found that if I totally shred the zucchini in the food processor, vs just grating it, the bread comes out much moister.  I shred the zucchini so much that it looks like mush and you can see the fluids.    Makes the bread very very moist.   If you want to make this recipe even lower fat than it already is,  you can replace 1/2 the veg oil with applesauce and you can not taste the  difference.

This is yummy. I added the zest and juice of one whole lemon and threw in some extra zucchini, the extra moisture caused the need for a slightly longer baking time. I love the freshness that the lemon adds. Thanks.

I made this recipe for the first time and it came out so delicious. My 9 yr old son and 4 yr old daughter both loved it so much that I need to make more. Best of all, I did not have to let them know that zucchini was in the recipe. This is a recipe that I will never let go.

Outstanding! I doubled the recipe and next time I will make even more. I took some reviews into consideration and added the juice of one lemon to the doubled recipe. I also used 1/2 of the oil and replaced that amount with applesauce and same with whole wheat flour. I would like to try a lemon glaze but am afraid of the calorie count that adds. I dont think it needs it really but I do LOVE lemon

So yum! The bread is very moist. With all the zucchini in my garden there will be plenty of this bread in the freezer! I can imagine that even those who dislike zucchini will enjoy this cakey bread. I may try adding walnuts or golden raisins to the next loaf since I plan to make so much of it. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.

This was delicious! I'm so glad that I made a double batch because the first loaf was gone the same day I made it. I followed suggestions to increase the lemon zest amount to 1 Tbsp. per loaf. I also cut the oil by half and added applesauce to make up the difference. I put a lemon glaze on top, because my mom always had a lemon glaze on her zucchini bread. I used 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/3 cup lemon juice for the glaze, whisked together until smooth.

This is excellent! Works well with shredded yellow squash.  To lower the calories, I added 1 ripe banana, skipped the vegetable oil, added 3 TB olive oil and used 1/2 cup Splenda with 1/4 cup sugar.  I love the lemon zest, what a great idea.

Good flavor but the loaf is completely FLAT!!  It rose a little during the baking process and then immediately fell upon taking it out of the oven.  I'm no novice when it comes to quick breads and I honestly have no idea why it turned out like this; I question the very small amounts of leavening in the recipe.

My husband, two year old and I all loved this recipe.  It's the best zucchini bread I've ever tasted.  I didn't know how the lemon would taste in a zucchini bread but it is amazing! You must try this recipe!  Also subbed 1/2 of the oil for applesauce and it turned out perfectly.

Terrific!  I doubled the batter to make two loaves.  I made a few additions - used half brown sugar and half granulated, and added vanilla extract and lemon juice.  In addition, I basted the cooling loaves with the glaze that Naples suggested.  It is absolutely delicious!

A lighter alternative to my regular bread recipe. I did add a little bit more lemon zest. Delicious!

This had a really great taste, but I found it almost TOO moist! Could be user-error: I don't have a shredder/grater so I chopped the zucchini very finely, but still had some chunks. I suspect that if I had shredded it, it would have melted into the bread more and not resulted in a quite so sticky bread. Anyway, tasted good and I liked the lemon zest flavor. It added a subtle flowery aroma. p.s. my cinnamon-addicted husband LOVED this bread :)

Super moist and yummy! Just the right amount of sugar- not overly sweet. I didn't have any lemons on hand so I added a tbsp of lemon juice- next time I might add 2 tbsps because I'd like it more lemony (but that's my own fault because I didn't have lemons to zest). I also substituted half of the oil with applesauce (so I used 1/4 cup oil + 1/4 cup applesauce instead of 1/2 cup oil) and I'm glad I did because you'd never know I halved the fat. It's super moist! I will use this recipe all the time!

This is an absolutely delicious bread!  I used two teaspoons of lemon extract and the result was a light and lemon-y bread...not at all overpowering, which is what I was afraid of.  Thank you so much!

Wow..this was excellent! This was the first time I've ever used zucchini in baking. Absolutely follow substitution advice for less fat content; applesauce instead of oil made a big difference. And also used part brown sugar and honey in place of white sugar. Nuts would have been great but I was fresh out.

This was made into the lightest most flavorful muffins.
I used applesauce/oil mix and added zest as well as lemon juice
and made a lemon glace to dip them in while still warm
I gave them to neighbors,who asked for the recipe

I have made this recipe last year twice and this year about four times. It is a wonderful bread, I follow the recipe but loaves and bake for 50 minutes. Perfect. I have been asked for the recipe many times and everyone that tastes it love it! I just took out two more loaves from the oven and this time I added one tablespoon lemon juice to see if that would give it a little more lemon flavor. You can't go wrong with this one!

As my son is allergic to nuts, I replaced them with 3/4 cup frozen cranberries.  I also used brown instead of white sugar.  
GREAT recipe.  I will try this again in a double batch as muffins.

Fantastic!  I read some of the other reviews and did 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.  I did vanilla instead of lemon and the bread melted in my mouth. I doubled it and put in 4 mini loaves and the time was 10 minutes less than what it called for.  I also added a bit more zucchini.  I will make it again.

This recipe is very good.  For nutrition purposes, I do not like to cook with vegetable oil.  I substituted it with 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and 1/4 cup applesauce and it still came out very moist and delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe as my zucchini recipe from now on!

Yum!  What a great way to use up all of that zucchini growing in your gardens!!  The lemon zest really makes this bread special.  So sweet & moist the kids won't even notice that you snuck in some "veggies"!!

Pretty good. I did 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar. There is a very nice subtle lemon taste in this. If you are expecting a more lemon-y flavor I suggest adding in a bit of juice and more zest.

What a nice light option for quick breads!  I replaced about 1/2 the AP flour with white whole wheat, substituted half the oil with unsweetened apple sauce, used 1 tsp of lemon zest and a couple squeezes of lemon juice.  I did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer, but the flavor and texture were great!

This was tasty. I added a little coconut, just because I like it, and added less sugar. I baked this in my smallest round pan with the removable bottom and added a lemon glaze and pecans.
Would make again.

A great bread! Very moist! The only change I made was I used whole wheat flour. Maybe it was because I used the whole wheat but it was lacking the big lemon flavor I was hoping for. Next time I would add more cinnamon and lemon zest for bit more flavor!

Just made this today, loved this recipe! Didn't have the zest..substituted 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice, used 2 cups fresh grated zucchini and used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce instead of 1/2 cup recipe calls for. Didn't rise like I would have liked, (may have been the extra zucchini) so I may use more bk pdr next time around and less oil/more applesauce...but overall...an EXCELLENT recipe! (and nearly guilt-free!!!)

I've made this recipe with and without lemon, and like it both ways. When I make muffins instead of bread, I double the batch since it only makes about 9 regular-sized muffins. I add extra cinnamon and sometimes use applesauce instead of oil. My kids were skeptical the first time since this had a "vegetable" in it, but ate it up!

Tastes delicious! Only change I'd make next time is to double all the ingredients to fit in a 9x5 pan and to add more lemon zest.

This recipe is amazing.  I made a lemon glaze, put in some extra lemon zest, put in 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/4 c. brown, also subbed half of the oil for apple sauce.  This would be delicious even without these changes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread was soo yummy! Like a lot of others, I changed a few things to try and make it more healthy.. whole wheat flour instead of white, brown sugar and honey instead of white sugar, ground flax seed instead of the egg, a combination of yellow squash and zucchini, and 1/2 grapeseed oil + 1/2 apple sauce in place of the recommended oil.  For me, the amount of lemon zest wasn't quite enough to taste, so I'd recommend adding more.  Maybe it was because i used a lot of other stronger flavored ingredients, though. I'd make this bread many more times, especially because it's so versatile and easy to change up.

Maybe I was expecting too much because of the wonderful reviews, but I thought this bread was just okay.  It was very moist, and the lemon was a nice addition, but it just didn't seem like a good zucchini bread recipe to start out with.  My mother-in-law really liked it, but I won't be making it again unless she requests it.

This was good, but you could taste the lemon WAY more than the zucchini. I would make it again though if I wasn't looking for a very "zucchini-tasting" zucchini bread.

So yummy! Tastes light and has a great flavor.  I didn't change the recipe a bit, except to double it!  I loved having an alternative to add to zucchini bread aside from chocolate.  The lemon was perfect!

This passed my picky elderly fathers taste test with flying colors.  We loved it and I used a whole lemon zested and made a glaze of 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar with 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice. This is sooo good, thanks for sharing.

Excellent taste/texture! Followed the recipe to the tee.  I thought there would be too much lemon in this but it was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

this recipe is fantastic, i split the batch and added the lemon zest to one bowl and a cup or so of chocolate chips to the other. then i made a glaze out of powdered sugar and lemon for the lemon muffins, they were fantastic! the chocolate ones were soo good as well, i highly recommend this recipe.

I modified the recipie a bit but it turned out great. I used part whole wheat flour and substituted 1 tsp. each of lemon extract and vanilla extract for the zest. I also left out the cinnamon and made a glaze of 1/2 c. confectioners, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 tsp. light corn syrup.

Moist and delicious.  It would taste even better had I made a glaze.  I am anxious to try it with splenda and or applesauce to reduce the calorie content, because I ate SO much of it!!!

Really good but a tad bit dry - and my 7 year old who will not eat any veggies actually loves it. The lemon adds a good flavor to it.

Loved this recipe!  It is light and the lemon flavor is perfect. I also added a cup of chopped walnuts. My kids even liked this and they don't eat zucchini! Other z breads call for a cup of sugar but I think the 3/4 cup was just right - not overly sweet! Thanks Rebecita!!!

I've been making zucchini breads for many years and I found that this recipe was one of the best!  Great flavor and very moist.  While the bread was still warm I heated lemon juice (from the lemon I zested) and sugar in saucepan and brushed glaze over the loaves!  It made it even more lemony.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I took the advice of a previous review, cutting down the sugar to 1/4 C Brown sugar, 1/4 Cup Honey, and substituted whole wheat flour. They were dense and moist and yummy. And by 'they' I mean the miniature muffins I used the batter for. The cooking time is cut down by about half, and you have to be careful to mix the lemon zest very well or it will clump. They were a big hit with honey butter!

I loved this!  I made this recipe this morning after realizing I didn't have all the stuff to make my mother's zucchini nut bread. It  was really outstanding and surprisingly light.  As I see frequently here, I doubled the amount of lemon zest and increased the sugar to one cup (since I have a sweet tooth). I made it in an 8x8 pan and it took 55 minutes to bake.  I will most certainly make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome recipe! I used lemon extract instead of zest and half stevia/half sugar, and it still turned out awesome! It didn't rise as much as I thought it would have, but I think that was the stevia. The lemon flavor was an excellent idea. It really complemented the zucchini.

I have made this recipe a few times now, but I have modified it each time.  I leave out the lemon zest.  Instead, I add mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts to the batter.  This is a really moist, and tasty recipe!  The chocolate chips add another level of sweetness.  Enjoy!

I was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews.  I thought the lemon actually detracted from the overall taste of the zucchini bread.  The texture was very good and moist, though.

I used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil.  I used 2 egg whites and half sugar half splenda.  I also subbed 1 small box of lemon pudding mix for 1/2 c of flour.  I did not have trouble getting this to rise as some people did.

I am being premature, perhaps (as this recipe has yet to be tasted. . .in the oven, right now), but I am a big fan of it already. We LOVE lemon as an ingredient around this house, and the addition of lemon to zucchini bread is something that I have done as an add-on with recipes like this before. I went a little further, adding the juice of 1/2 lemon, as well. I also added a small container of vanilla yogurt, as the batter seemed a bit dry. I had doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves, and it seemed to "need something" in the doubling of it.

I really enjoy recipes for quick bread that stay true to the "quick" part of it -- a wet bowl and a dry bowl, period. I don't want to haul out mixers or sift (and I didn't do that part of this one, either). I want rustic and tasty. Let's see if this ones is the winner of all of the zucchini breads that I have tried over the years.

Moist and delicious. I used a half-and-half mix of whole wheat flour and white flour and it tastes great! Next time I think I'll try brown sugar instead of white.

I took the advice of naples34102 and used a full tbsp of zest and made her glaze for the top. This was outstanding! Plenty sweet for me. There's so much flavor from the lemon, but not too much and not bitter at all. I highly recommend this recipe with the glaze!

My boyfriend loves anything lemony and he loves zucchini bread (especially his grandma's).  I thought I could get a leg up on her by adding the lemon, and it worked.  He loved it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I added a more lemon juice and it needed more time in the oven.  But overall, wonderful!

Amazing!! I used 1T lemon zest and 1/2t vanilla as was suggested by another user, and it turned out completely wonderful! I will definitely make this again.

One of several kinds of zucchini bread I made at once, this was the favorite.

I added white chocolate chips to this bread.  I am a "bread" maker.  I love making and eating breads, this is by far the BEST bread I have ever tasted.

My husband and I love this recipe! As a matter of fact, I made it today for the first time, and it's already almost gone. I added a bit more lemon(just because we love lemon) and cinnamon and it turned out great. I will be making this again tomorrow to bring to a friend.

This is a great recipe. This bread has a really vibrant flavor. I did use a half whole wheat and half regular flour and it turned out great. Overall a delicious version of zucchini bread that I will use from now on. Well liked by everyone!

Excellent! Sweetened it up a wee bit with the lemon/sugar glaze when it came out of the oven. Made a great desert.

This tasted like regular zucchini bread to me. I could not taste the lemon at all. I even added extra lemon juice, but no luck. It was still tasty though.

The lemon in this makes it taste so fresh. I happened to not have vegetable oil so I used olive oil and omitted the cinnamon and it was still fabulous! It stays so nice and moist.

This is a great recipe.  I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil and it was very moist.  The other addition I made was to add the juice from the lemons.  I will make again.

This was really an excellent recipe!  I added some walnuts and also some shredded apples in place of some of the zucchini.  Because we don't like overly sweet breads, I also substituted demerera sugar.  My husband raved about it and won't quit nibbling...

This was very good. I added a 1/4 tsp. of lemon flavoring (I like lemon)and made it into muffins. The lemony flavor made it seem lighter than most Zucchini breads.

I think it was good bread.  I used whole wheat flour as well as apple sauce instead of oil for mine, but it could have used a little something.  I think some walnuts would have made all the difference.  I didn't find it overwhelmingly sweet as some did either, but my measurement was a titch short of 3/4 cups.

This is a great bread. I loved it when I made it as directed by the recipe, but have been making some changes each time have made it since by adding applesauce and whole wheat flour. I also added lemon extract while I had it, because I loved the lemony flavor of the bread.

Very interesting flavor for sure. I added the juice from the lemon as well as the zest for a more lemon-y flavor. It smelled amazing while it was baking. I also substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar. Very nice looking loaf.

I used egg beaters instead of one egg- 1/4 cup plus one Tablespoon.  I also used an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and another dash of vanilla extract.  I made a lemon glaze to cover the bread, which is what made it great.  1 cup of powdered sugar mixed with 2 T. of fresh lemon juice and 1/2 t. of lemon extract.  Delicious!

Loved this. I made into muffins and made some healthier changes, used 1/4c homemade applesauce and 1/4c canola oil, used 1c whole wheat flour and 1/2c white, 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4c white. Very moist and tasty. Will make again.

LOved this recipe. It is nice and moist and has lots of flavour. I thought it made a rather small loaf, so next time I will double it and make two loaves. I might also do as another reviewer did and add some lemon juice. Or I might make a tart lemon glaze for it.

This was pretty good. I substituted 1/4 of the white flour for whole wheat to make it a little healthier. Next time, I'll add walnuts, as well.

I made this while at the beach with friends. We ate the whole loaf in one sitting. I had to make another loaf the next day. Same thing. Best I've had. Easy to make. Excellent.

The lemon is delightful!  I added a crumb topping before baking (flour, softened butter and brown sugar with cinnamon), super duper!

Very good, but I thought it didn't have enough lemon zest.  I will definetly make this again but will be adding more lemon zest and perhaps a couple tbs of lemon juice.

Its so good! I tried adding a little more zest and lemon juice like others had mentioned. Wow definitely worth it. I also just melted a little lemon frosting  and drizzled it over the top and it looks as good as it tastes.

MMMMMM!  Delicious!  I made the glaze like some suggested, but next time i would do without.  I think it was plenty sweet and moist without it.  Glaze was too much for me.

I made this recipe for a friend of mine in Brazil. She is not too fond of desserts, yet she loved this one for its low content of sugar. She ate the whole bread in ONE DAY! She was amazed to find out that it contained zucchini (it is not common to use zucchini in Brazilian desserts). This zucchini bread is definitely a winner!

I did modify this recipe a bit: 1/2 c splenda, 1/4 brown sugar. 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of oil, and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour instead. I also made muffins. They were tasty but the texture was rubbery due to modifications. But, with these mods the recipe is 2 WW points per serving instead of 5. The lemon was a nice addition as well. Thank you!

Really easy and delicious recipe.  I had tons of zuchini and didn't know what to do with them.  This recipe was so easy, I was able to make 4 loaves in one night.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil and they came out extremely moist and delicious and not too sweet.  Will make this again.

Will definately make this again with all the frozen zucchini I have from summer! I used half whole wheat flour and used applesauce instead of oil and it was still super moist. I also made a glaze with more lemon juice, milk, and confectionate sugar. Delicious!

This is a great recipe!  The lemon really adds a nice touch.  My son loves it, and when my family was visiting I couldn't make enough of it; it's gone as soon as it's made.  Thanks!

This bread was very moist. Not quite as lemony as I expected, would make again and increase lemon a bit. Walnuts and a glaze would be great too. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the second recipe I tried, and my search is over. Not to dense, perfect consistency. I replaced some of the lemon zest with orange zest. I also cut the cinnamon and finished the measure in cardamom. Thank you.

This was great! Nice lemony, warm-spiced flavor. All I changed was subbing half the oil for cinnamon applesauce, putting in a touch more cinnamon, and using lemon-flavored Greek yogurt (with some milk to yield the traditional yogurt texture). I also did as another reviewer suggested and made a glaze with lemon juice and white sugar melted on the stove. I may have waited until the bread was too cool as it didn’t absorb very well and I had a ton of extra glaze. But since life handed me extra lemon glaze, I made lemonade! Just added water and ice cubes and stirred. Best lemonade ever. Happy baking (and beverage-mixing)!

I doubled the recipe since I wanted to make 2 loaves but then there was so much I ended up using a bundt pan.
I thought it was pretty good, it was moist and I had no problem with it rising. although my husband wasn't as crazy about it.
However, I did what a few other reviewers did and added a lemon glaze and it was too much lemon! I think that's what my husband didn't like. I'll try again next time but leave out the glaze and just make one loaf.

Very good...light and delicate.  A nice change from the traditional zucchini bread.  I wanted it to be a larger loaf so I added a little bit to each ingredient.  I also made the light glaze mentioned by many reviewers, it was a nice touch yet I'm not so sure it is necessary.  The glaze had such a light flavor that I bet the bread would taste the same without it.  At any rate, I will make this recipe again.

Wonderful flavor - husband loved it - even better on day two, doubt it will last to day three.  Did have to bake longer than called for - pretty dense.  Do add walnuts - can't wait to bring to a party or pot luck!

I  made this according to the recipe using Smude Sunflower oil for the oil ingredient.  We enjoyed this recipe and found it to be very moist.  The delicate flavor of the lemon was a new enjoyment for us.  I will make it again.

I followed the recipe with the one suggestion to add vanilla.  I couldn't decide whether I was supposed to fine grate the zucchini or regular so I did half and half.  It did have a nice crisp crust.  I would try again and maybe try the applesauce recommendation

I've made this several times altering the recipe to make lemon-blueberry zucchini bread.  I substitute vanilla for the cinnamon and add about 3/4 cup blueberries.  I top it with a lemon glaze made from powdered sugar and lemon juice.  It makes a great summer dessert!

I added shredded coconut and some pepitas (pumpkin seeds) for added texture and because I had them on hand.  This recipe is moist and delicious - the office loved it so much I have to bring it back for Christmas luncheon.

This was a lovely change from banana bread but because I had to switch out the flour for a gluten free blend, it makes it a little drier. I will need to play around with the recipe to make it more moist but overall, I kept the ingredients the same and will definitely try it again.

The lemon zest truly made the zucchini pop and taste fresh. I substituted applesauce for some of the oil and sugar. Wonderfully moist.

This was good. Doubled the recipe. Made the Lemon Glaze as suggested but probably would make a streusel topping instead next time. These are very moist and dense and the glaze adds to that texture a bit, although tasty. I used less sugar. I used a green zucchini and a yellow zucchini squash.  For regular  MUFFINS these need to bake 23 minutes. 20 was undercooked.

This was great! I never have added lemon to zucchini bread I doubled the recipe to make two loaves. One loaf  to eat and one to give.  I will definitely make again .  i did add some vanilla and made the glaze one of the reviewers had suggested.  It  probably would have been fine without the glaze but I love lemon.. The bread was very moist.  Needless to say it didnt last long.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. To me it was kinda bland. I added vanilla, lemon juice and extra cinnamon and it still didn't do much for the flavor.  It was dense and almost to moist but not in a good way.

I added walnuts and grated carrots.  I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes, but it still wasn't baked through so added another to minutes to baking time.  The prep time is more than 15 minutes because I grated the zucchinis and carrots by hand.  It's a great recipe, but seems to require more baking time.

This zucchini bread was delicious!  However, I followed one of the other comments and added lemon zest.  A little on the zesty side!
       This is definitely a recipe to try!

I LOVE this recipe. I tweaked it by adding a cup of grated granny smith apples and a cup of chopped walnuts. It baked perfectly and it was very moist!
I will make this again for sure.

This is DELICIOUS. To accommodate an egg allergy,  I subbed flaxseed. I also reduced the sugar a bit and upped the lemon factor. Everyone raved. Now I love zucchini season!

Loved this recipe. I quadrupled the recipe!  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup per loaf, cut the oil in half and substituted homemade sugar free pumpkin butter for the remaining oil, and split the flour to half unbleached white four, half ground whole wheat flour. Cooked beautifully, delicious!

I also made some changes and it turned out great . I doubled the reciepe added 1tsp of vanilla and accidentally added 1 tsp of baking soda( I was just so used to most of the recipies using 1tsp of baking powder) .I squeezed all the juice  &  zested  the whole lemon and used it all in the reciepe, plus I added  cup of frozen raspberries . My bread raised and is not overly dense. I baked it 50 min at 350 degrees .Its perfect :)

This recipe was a hit with myself and my housemates.  I doubled the recipe, and had enough for a regular-sized 12 tin muffin pan and 2 large muffins, baked at around 30-min. I also used naples34102's glaze - yum!! 

Next time I make these, I plan on cutting the oil and use apple sauce as another member had suggested, and add a few nuts.

The only thing I changed was adding a glaze on top. The author of the recipe was 100% correct in saying its perfect if you dont like a sweet bread. This is definitely not a sweet bread at all.  If you want sweet you will definitely have to add a glaze. It was very dense and moist.  For me it is a keeper.

I wanted less sugar so I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup honey.  I also added about 2 Tb freshly squeezed lemon juice. It turned out not too sweet but sweet enough, and with just enough zing of the lemon. Nice texture and weight.  It took me longer to bake but that is probably because of the honey substitution. Definitely make again.

I ended up making 2 loaves in one morning, as the first loaf was almost gobbled up quickly. However, I did make 1 small change , I added the juice of 1 lemon and the bread is very good  and moist.

Delicious and moist!  The zucchini I thought I had was not good, not I used squash and it tasted great too!  (Although we all agreed that "squash bread" doesn't sound as appetizing as zucchini bread.). I also juiced the lemons and mixed lemon juice and powdered sugar and made a lemon glaze to drizzle over top.

I made this with bananas. 3-4 instead of lemon. I also added half the sugar. (Splenda). It turned out great. If the batter is to thick I add a little water. It's so yummy!!!

let me start off by saying this is an absolutely delicious bread! i did make a few changes .i used 2 cups of zucchini and i could not find my cheese grater to grate my zucchini,so i instead chopped it into small bits. i combined my oil,egg, and sugar (i only used about 1/2 cup or less of sugar as i did not want this very sweet) first then folded in the chopped up zucchini after. i grated the entire zest of a small lemon into the dry mix and added the juice of the lemon into the oil-egg-sugar mix. i did the rest of the recipe as directed
i am in love with this bread! my only complaint was it seemed a slight bit chewier than id like. maybe because of my changes i needed to bake it longer.but it tastes incredible with plain cream cheese spread ontop of a slice. I will definitely make again! when i do remake i want to try to take out the sugar completely and see how it tastes. Id like a more savory bread personally, although as is this reminds me of carrot cake. a spice cake with a lovely hint of vegetable. its very good 

p.s. this bread will make your house smell like heaven!

This bread is good - nicely moist.  I really didn't care for the cinnamon with the lemon though - just my preference.  I made it a second time omitting the cinnamon and increasing the zest to a full tablespoon and it was delicious.

Family loved it.  I had a hard time zesting an older lemon but got enough for just a fresh hint.  Will keep making this and pass it down as a family recipe.  Only changes were a 1/4 cup whole wheat flour.

Excellent zucchini bread!  I did substitute the vegetable oil with coconut oil that I had melted down into liquid form .  I also followed the suggestion of a previous review and added the sugar and lemon juice glaze to the top after taking it out of the oven.   Took this to a bbq and received numerous compliments!

Loved it!  Made alternations (as usual :) 1/2 cup almond meal flour, 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 2 TBS lemon juice, chia seeds (think poppy seed crunch) and chopped pecans.  Yummy!!!

Overall good, but needs a little more lemon zest.  I added a little bit of nutmeg, extra cinnamon by heaping my teaspoon measurement and about 1/4 tsp. of vanilla, which were good additions.  

It seems like the bread could use just one more ingredient, maybe the extra lemon zest would do it.  

I baked the bread in three 5.75 x 3" pans at 350° for 25-30 minutes.

The best zucchini bread I have had. I did make a lemon icing to go on top with juice from one lemon, a tablespoon of milk and I started out with a 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and added more until the desired consistency. (I love lemon so it might be strong on the lemon).

We have a lot of zucchini and my last attempt at zucchini bread did not turn out well. This was delicious. I replaced half of the oil with applesauce and a third of the flour with whole wheat. I used a small rectangular glass pan and had to cook it more than 45 min. I was planning on putting a lemon glaze on it, but forgot and I am having trouble leaving it alone.

First time try with this recipe, and it was great! Hard to measure shredded zucchini and zest of lemon. I used two medium organic zucchini and zest of one entire lemon (plus some juice) and seemed to be just right. I doubled the recipe, used two 8 X 4 pans,  and it came out beautiful and delicious. Only problem was it's hard to wait to cut it and devour!

Made this recipe for Easter brunch because I thought it would be a nice, light addition to eggs and ham. It was ok, but I thought it was a little bland and sweet, despite the fact that I added extra lemon juice to try to give it some oomph. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Nice basic recipe to build from. This was a good way to use up the extra  zucchini from our CSA. I made them into muffins and froze some for later. After tasting the first batch I thought they were a little bland so I added a cup of dark chocolate chips. They were a hit! Next time I will also add some chopped walnuts.

Very good recipe!  I only slightly modified it by substituting apple sauce for oil and using 2 cups zucchini and 1/2 cup sugar.  I made mini muffins and they are not too sweet, packed with zucchini, soft on the inside and a nice little crunch on the top.  Perfect for breakfast!!

This is a keeper. This has become our new spring time bread that we keep on hand for the week. I loooove lemon flavouring so I do ad a pinch of lemon extract to zing it up a bit. The recipe is great as is too.

Fabulous recipe!  I didn't have any problems with the bread sticking to the pan, and followed the recipe exactly, with terrific results.  It was flavorful, moist, and the touch of lemon was delicious.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Great Recipe. I substituted half of the flour with wheat flour and it turned out great.

This was the best zucchini bread I've ever had. However, I would add alittle bit more lemon zest to it for extra flavor. Or maybe add some lemon juice?

Pretty tasty.  It probably would have earned five stars had I not tried to make it healthier with whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of oil.  Oh, well.  Still yummy!  Next time I'll try it as it was intended.

Disappointed in this recipe.  We found it rather dry (only baked for 30 minutes) and not lemony at all.  Would probably not make again.

This was AWESOME! I made it in muffin form and took them to work. People raved about them all day! I used whole wheat flour and they turned out super moist.

This bread came out delicious.  I used orange zest instead of lemon and replaced the oil with apple sauce.
