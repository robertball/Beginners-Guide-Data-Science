This was very good, but the batter ratio was off so only gave the recipe 4 stars. For each pancake I used 3/4 cup of flour to 3/4 cup of very cold water. This resulted in the right consistency. I will try tempura batter mix next time for more crispness.  I made a batch of the dipping sauce for each pancake. Didnâ€™t find Korean red pepper powder so substituted cayenne. It was the perfect heat and spice for the pancake. I think you could make this with meat rather than seafood. We added bean sprouts and matchsticks of red bell pepper.
