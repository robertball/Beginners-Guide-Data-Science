I'm kind of perplexed by this recipe. It's not what I think of when I think of Potato Soup. I only cooked mine about 3 1/2 hours on high & the potatoes are mushy & I have a very vintage slow cooker (they don't cook as hot as newer ones). I didn't have any celery so I used celery flakes. I do like dill, but didn't use the full amount. I used low sodium vegetable broth. I have to admit that I do like the broth. After taking a picture of the finished product, I'm going to go tweak it by mashing it up, adding a bit of milk, garlic and pepper.

We thought this recipe was fabulous! I haven't brought out my crock pot in seven years, but I did to make this recipe and it will become a staple in our house. I peeled 3 very large russet potatos and chopped them up, I also added some baby carrots to the recipe. I got tired of shuffling around my spices and couldn't find my dill so I added a garlic and onion seasoning I had. I cooked on low for 8 hours but it was perfectly done in 7 hours. The potatos and the carrots have great flavor and melt in your mouth!

Not what I consider potato soup, but very good nonetheless. This would be good for lactose intolerant folks.

Very similar my mom's recipe except doing it on the stop top we sauted the onions in the olive oil and used chicken broth.  The picture shows carrots and we alway add them for color but it is not listed in the ingredients.

I found using 2 onions really dominated the taste. Next time I make this, I will use just one onion and double up the celery and add some carrots. This has the potential though to be really good.

Edible but VERY, VERY bland. It needs something else. I'm going to try adding bacon.

I love this. I didn't start it in time so I put it on the stove and cooked it a bit faster. Once everything was cooked I put about 1-1/2 cups of the soup in the blender with about 1/2 c. milk and creamed it up and then added it back into the soup. My family ate it up, thank you for the potato soup that wasn't loaded with fat!!

I added carrots, bacon, and salt & pepper and everyone liked it. It was a good alternative to the think cheesy potato soups that I have made before. More like a vegetable soup.

I added a small package of frozen corn, some diced green pepper and a little bit of hot sauce.  I also used just enough broth to cover HALF, then after the veggies are tender, I mashed the mixture and added milk and butter.

I followed the recipe except I added carrots. However very very bland. Would try again making a lot of changes because it was very bland.

The dill adds a nice subtle flavor.  I would cut back on the onion next time. Depending on if you are using a vegetable stock or broth, you would need to add some salt.  I'm thinking this would be good to try with red skin potatoes.

VERY bland! 1 onion was plenty. I added baby carrots, salt, and pepper - this didn't help the lack of taste. 6 hours in the slow cooker is too much, mine was a very mushy consistency. Lastly, the olive oil contributed little.
