This was very good, but I think it would be even better without the bananas. I'd rather have more manadarin oranges and raspberries. The bananas got a bit mushy after freezing. This isn't too sweet, and the raspberries added just the right amount of tartness.

Wonderfull flavor combo! Use light or fat free cream cheese and whipped topping and drop the sugar down to 1/4 cup to shave off alot of calories without sacrificing any of the delicious appeal from this fruity dish.

This recipe was delicious with less sugar.  I also found that you need to take it out of the freezer an hour before serving to prevent "brain freeze"!  Our guests loved the flavour combination.  I would definitely make it again.

Had a few more mandarin oranges than called for so I only used 1 sliced banana. Also I didnâ€™t freeze it, just chilled it overnight in the refrigerator. Everyone loved it.

Easy and simply delicious, I used light cream cheese, light whipped cream and 1/4 cup of sugar to reduce the calories and it still was amazing!

This tasted great.  I couldn't find frozen raspberries in my small town, so I substituted a mixture of frozen berries.  Took it to school for our end of the year meal and  we all enjoyed it.

This was pretty good. It is very sweet, however. Almost a dessert, rather than a side salad, but pretty good.

I found this recipe because I was looking for a way to use up an abundance of fresh mandarin oranges. I also used fresh raspberries and just ripened bananas (still firm). I used nufchatel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese and the full amount of sugar.  It turned out awesome!  My bananas did not get mushy, despite being frozen.  It is such a simple, yet tasty and refreshing dessert/salad.  Will definitely make this again, especially during the summer months, and am eager to try it with different fruit combinations.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this for the first time. I didn't want it too sweet so I whipped two 8 oz cream cheese and added the juice from a can of mandarin oranges, then beat in a large container of cool whip and folded in the mandarin oranges, a small can of drained pineapple tidbits, two containers of fresh raspberries and two sliced bananas... I did not freeze it so I didn't have to worry about mushy bananas... It was a runaway hit at our Christmas party and there was none left...
