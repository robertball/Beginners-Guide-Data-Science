Wow, yum!  What a crisp, flavorful, refreshing salad!  It's so pretty with its pastel colors too.  This salad was an adventure for me since I've never had fennel or hearts of palm before.  Turns out I love both!  I used a shallot instead of red onion because I like that it's more mild.  Instead of peeling the grapefruit, I just cut it in half and scooped out the flesh with a spoon.  The gorgonzola cheese goes well with all the ingredients and the vinaigrette was not bitter at all.  I'm so glad I went out of my comfort zone to try this salad!

The most adventuresome dish I've prepared to date.  For culinary creativity, Jennifer deserves an "A."  Salad dressing could be halved.

I loved this salad. I only changed the heart of palm for artichoke hearts and the gorgonzola for feta because I had them on hand.

I love this salad.  I used white balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar which makes it a little less acidic.  Absolutely delicious.  I needed a break from regular green salads, quinoa salads, etc.  My husband loves it too.  I will definitely make again.
