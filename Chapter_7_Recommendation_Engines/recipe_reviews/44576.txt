I don't know about this one.  It is very similar to "Sean's Falafel" on this site, but with split peas instead of chickpeas (which is traditionally what falafel is made of), so I thought I would like it ("Sean's" is great!). But having never had split peas, I wasn't quite sure about it. My only changes were that I used parsley in place of the mint and baked the falafel at 400 for 10 minutes on one side & then 10 more on the other side.  It is very earthy tasting and a little dry.  If nothing else, it is a very filling and healthy snack (if baked, not fried).  That warranted an extra star.  I don't know if I'll try it again though.

I thought these were good. I modified the recipe slightly: After about 20 hours of soaking, the beans were definitely not mashable so I cooked them until they were an appropriate consistency and then proceeded with the recipe. The recipe makes a LOT of falafel and I added two eggs instead of one to get the batter to come together. I also added about 50% more of the spices than the recipe calls for. I deep-fried the falafel and they looked beautiful. I might try baking or pan-frying next time to cut down on oil. The falafel were very tender and crumbled easily. I thought the flavor was great. I had them in pitas the first day and atop a salad with dill-and-yogurt dressing the second day. Both very yummy.

Definitely won't make this again for several reasons. The peas are not mashable just by soaking. They have to be cooked. Even after adding more egg, the mixture wouldn't hold together. I added some bread crumbs which helped. The few that held together for cooking did taste ok but it was not worth the frustration.
