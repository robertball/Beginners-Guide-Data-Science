This definitely is an easy, yet impressive little dessert that's takes very little effort.  It's perfect when you don't have a lot to time but still want an after dinner treat.  The combination of almonds, berries and chocolate paired nicely. I used low-fat ice cream sandwiches and added a little whipped cream over top - YUMMY!

It's a good idea to convert a plain ice cream to a fancy ice cream sandwich.
