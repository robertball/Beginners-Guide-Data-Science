Solid recipe. Easy and tastes great. Word to the wise~don't use all natural peanut butter. I made 2 batches, one with all natural and one with regular everyday peanut butter. I will  not be using the all natural again for baking. My bad. Thanks for the recipe KBL. My family enjoyed.

It was full of her chocolate chips. I used a glass 9x 13 and they were very dark around the edges and thus took away from the rest of the brownies  which were delicious. I think the temperature for the glass pan was too high. Next time I’ll lower it to 350 degrees  and watch it . I did bake it for 20 minutes. My stove is only 8 years old so I don’t think that it was the problem. Except for that the rest of the brownies were good

This recipe is easy and delicious. If you need a chocolate and peanut butter fix, this ones for you. The only change I made was to add a few chocolate chips on top straight from the oven! Yum!!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time, I took them to a potluck because hubby and I didn't really need to eat the entire panful. They were that delicious, we would have. Anyway, even though there were plenty of other desserts at the potluck, we came home with an empty plate!

I followed the recipe exactly, made no changes. Its easy to make, is delicious, melts in your mouth! If you like chocolate chip cookies, you will like this even more!Have made it twice in a month. I will be making this often instead of the chocolate chip cookies.

I used natural crunchy peanut butter (Smucker's) but was a little nervous because of another review that said results weren't as good with natural peanut butter. Since I only buy natural, that was my only option. Turns out, I didn't need to worry! These are delicious! I also used semisweet chips instead of chunks. We love chocolate and peanut butter at our house and these were a hit. I will definitely make them again.
