What a great little dessert!  It's extremely easy and presents beautifully.   I do recommend letting this sit for atleast an hour to let the marshamallows soften.  I'm sure I'll be making this one often! I used 1/4 cup of sour cream.

Five Stars for kid appeal and ease. The taste is really good as well. I threw in an extra handful of marshmallows because we had a lot of kids here today and they liked it. The adults enjoyed it as well. Followed another review and chilled for about an hour before serving. We will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Quick and easy dessert to put together.  We liked it best after the flavors had time to together, rather than waiting for only 5 minutes.  This will be a great summer salad.

Quick, simple, pretty good. I didn't have enough sour cream so I used some marshmallow creme to make up the difference. The "sauce" turned a nice pink color, and this would be cute for a girl baby shower or Valentine's Day party because of the pretty pick color. A bit on the sweet side, because I added the sugar and my berries were plenty sweet on their own. I didn't taste them first as the other crops recently have needed the sugar. Anyway, great dish overall. Thanks!

Made this as a snack for me & the  grands. I used the fruity, pastel marshmallows & I used low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. Was very tasty...thanks for the recipe!

This also works with frozen strawberries and FF sour cream or greek yogurt.

Yum! Strawberries are at an all time low price - $1 for a 2 lb. container at most of the grocery stores around here (the ones that are selling them for $2.50 are out of their mind hehe!). I already had sour cream, marshmallows and sugar on hand, so this was a SUPER inexpensive treat! :-) Another bonus? I't's SOOO easy to prepare! I too served this in footed dessert bowls with a couple of fresh mint leaves as garnish (exactly like the picture!). This was a nice, light dessert to have after eating a heavy Italian meal (I planned to make dinner for my mom's Bday, but plans fell by the wayside; I already prepared dessert, so we had this when we returned from the restaurant). I want to add one bit of advice. BE SURE TO LET THIS SIT FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR!!! As Ms. Jaeger mentioned, your marshmallows should be slightly softened for optimal results. My only other suggestion would be to chop your strawberries. Although great as is, I do believe I'd like this a tad better had I done so. One more thing.... I was worried that the sour cream would be offputting, but to my surprise, it wasn't! Of course, any dair substitute would work - Cool-whip, plain or vanilla yogurt, etc. I think I might even replace the sugar with Splenda next time (I have a diabetic MIL "to be" and friend I'd like to share this recipe with). My parents commented on how delicious this was (score!). Thanks for making me look like a rock star, Valerie! This one's going to be added to my recipe box for sure. :)

this was really easy and with just a few on hand ingredients you can make a light dessert.  I added a little lemon zest to kick up the flavor.

We loved this, but only after I added about a tablespoon more sugar than the recipe called for.  Without it, this was a little too tangy for our liking.

i loved this dessert!!!! it was very quick and the out come was delicious. i followed the recipe exactly but i made it for 6 servings, it works fine!!! also, i ran out of marshmallows and only had one cup (6 servings require 1 and one half cups) so i put in every thing and i don't think it would make a difference exceptit would be less sweet.  GREAT RECIPE!!!!! MUST TRY!

This is a really nice and simple dessert. I used plain yogurt instead of cream cheese (just a preference), and added some whipped topping for a nicer presentation.
