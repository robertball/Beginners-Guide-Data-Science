These taste good, but they come out with a texture that is much more like a muffin than a cupcake.  It's quite heavy and dense, as the previous reviewer mentioned.  It's odd there is no baking powder, and that is likely why they are so dense: they don't rise.  Finally, I found the directions are unclear and missing steps.   

Overall, I'd say to give the recipe a try, but tweak it a bit and add baking soda to improve the texture.

These were just OK. Very very dense. They tasted fairly good but extreamly heavy.

I had some old Chai tea lying around that I found too mild to use for a Chai tea drink, so I was very pleased to be able to use it for this recipe. Having said that, I made these as muffins instead of cupcakes. I reduced the suger about 50 g (I used the metric scale when making them) and didn't add any icing. I found them to be super quick and easy to make. Great with a cup of coffee; I'll definitely try them again.
