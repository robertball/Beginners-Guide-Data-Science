I used Cherry flavored gelatin and omitted the nuts and fruit and these were a BIG hit at Christmas!  They stayed nice and soft in airtight containers for WEEKS!  Thanks Debbie!!

This is a good recipe that turned out beautiful divinity.  I used apricot gelatin to color the divinity for fall.

This recipe came out fine as far as texture, but still did not quite taste like all the divinity I have ever had.  Will keep looking for another recipe.

I used raspberry flavored gelatin. Beautiful pink color. I don't like divinity with nuts, so I omitted them. Held up nicely, easy to do. I will make this recipe again.
