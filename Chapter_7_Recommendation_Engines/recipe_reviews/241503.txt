Wow...wow this was good.  It does taste exactly like a pina colada.  It is so incredibly good.  I will definitely make this again

great recipe but for a lactose friendly version try using nut/soy milk, kefir (healthy bacteria) & chilled canned coconut as a substitution for the coconut yogurt and milk.  

also if you put the liquids in the blender first it helps to keep the blender from getting stuck without having to add more liquids.  also adding the frozen fruit slowly will keep the smoothie from becoming too thick too fast and therefore stalling the yummys to your tummys.

My blender really struggled blending the frozen fruit (maybe it's time I invested in a Vitamix?), so I had to add more milk which, unfortunately, diluted the flavor a  bit. Yogurt doesn't come in 8-oz containers anymore, so I used just one of the 5.3 oz containers of Chobani® coconut Greek yogurt (couldn't find toasted coconut vanilla yogurt) and a good dollop of Cabot® vanilla Greek yogurt which added quite a bit of tang.  I liked this smoothie, but didn't think it really was too close to a pina colada flavor (admittedly, that could have been a result of having to add more milk).  Toasted a little coconut which was a nice garnish and added some needed coconut flavor to the smoothie.  Next time, I will try only one frozen fruit.

This one is a winner.  Very tasty.   It's hard to get my husband to try new things, but he loved this.  He tasted mine and then wanted his own, so I'm glad I made more.  Easy to prepare, all ingredients on hand, will make this for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  It just works!

I've made this several times and we liked it very much.  The last time I made it I added about 1 rounded Tablespoonful of toasted coconut and we liked it even better.

Super yummy, we did find we needed to add milk to thin it a bit. But other then that this is so delish.

Didn't add any milk, and used canned pineapple chunks instead of frozen ones.  This was delicious! Great texture and really flavorful :)

I loved it!  The flavour of a pina colada without all the calories.

This is great as is but I kicked it up a bit and made it an adult drink. Was a huge hit, so refreshing for a summer cocktail
