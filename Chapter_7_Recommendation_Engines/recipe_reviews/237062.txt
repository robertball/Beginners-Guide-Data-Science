Hindelwadels of Syracuse developed the recipe along time ago.  We eat salt potatoes all summer in Syracuse NY, the salt city.

I know the recipe says it's from Syracuse, NY but when I lived in Italy, we ate potatoes prepared this way all the time.  They're even yummy served cold the next day! Make a batch at the beginning of the week and eat a few every day. Perfect for the summer when you want to limit how often you're standing in front of a hot stove. :)

I grew up just north of Syracuse, and we had Hinerwadles salt potatoes every summer, and every time we drive back, we buy some, because they really can't be duplicated. However, this recipe comes pretty darn close. As another reviewer states, you must NOT cut the potatoes. They are meant to be eaten hot, with melted butter on the side. Don't let the amount of salt freak you out; they are delish with melted butter and corn on the cob at a barbecue or clambake, and you just get a salty zing! before you bite through to the wonderful, soft center. I miss very little about living outside SYR, and this is one of them.

I was forced to use fingerling potatoes but it didn't matter. The potatoes came out perfect and it was so quick and easy!! I'm used to roasting potatoes which takes so much longer so I'm happy to now have this recipe in my back pocket.

This was the easiest way to get creamy, delicious baby Yukon Gold potatoes.  It's amazing, but the salt does not permeate the potatoes, just makes them really tasty.  I was originally going to present them the way Chef John did, then decided to pour the butter over all, to which I had added parsley and garlic.  Then over that I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese, and real bacon bits! YUMMY!

Loved.These. I made it for our family of four and really should have doubled the recipe since I was hoping for leftovers! I used red potatoes approximately the size of golf balls. We cut the potatoes into little wedges before drizzling the butter over (and we used unsalted butter, since the salt amount was perfect and I didn't want to push it).

My family loved these potatoes! I served them with the balsamic roasted pork loin recipe and roasted asparagus. It was a delicious meal.

Delicious - and sooo easy.  Just the right amount of salty - just make sure you used the amount of water called for in the recipe.  The most creamy potatoes I have ever had.

I was looking for recipes to make something different for company next  week. I tried this recipe on a Sunday night to see if it was any good before i served it to company. It was a Sunday evening snack, quick and easy. They were delicious. I might never make any other potato again. They aren't overpowering salty while you eat them but after your mouth and lips taste yummy still

i love all things chef John.  this recipe will now go into my weekly rotation for dinner for its simplicity,  speed of completion and because my husband couldn't exactly put his finger on it but kept saying how much he really liked them.  i took one star off because my son and i both thought they turned out too salty for our taste but next time I'll slightly adjust the amount of salt.  thanks for the great recipe!

I love this! It's fun to make it with others watching... like me the think it will be too salty but, it's not and we love it! You just have to make sure to us whole potatoes with the skins fully in tact.

The first time ever ate this type (the cooking method) of these potatoes, was when I met all my Yankee husband family. I had met this Mom right after we married. I being a southern girl never had salt potatoes. So your first trip North, I got to eat salt potatoes. SURPRISE...I loved them. My Mother n law had told the family, when returning home, "this girl can cook", so we got to feed her our best and they did. I brought  several bags home with us. Have not cooked any in years, so guess what this family is getting for part of Easter dinner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....

With all that salt, I was amazed at how perfectly delicious these tasted!  Potatoes with salt and butter--yum! This was so easy to make. Will be doing this recipe again.

Wow, these are amazing!  The outside is salty and has a snap to it when you bit into it, but the inside creaminess and mellow flavor cuts down on the salty outside and makes it perfect :)  We loved them and can't wait to make again and again!!

I'm always looking for a fabulous side to compete with my hubby's grilled ribeye steaks and this one did it! Exact to recipe. Be sure to use Kosher salt! Use the butter as well. This is a keeper!

Absolutely Loved These!  My husband said that this is his new favorite way to have potatoes.  I was skeptical when I saw how much salt was in the recipe.  Truth be known, if this had not been a Chef John recipe, I probably wouldn't have trusted it.  However, Chef John never fails!  Just be sure that you use kosher salt and not table salt.  I think that might have been the problem for the person who said that these were way to salty.

This was so simple and so good! We're making it again tonight. Thank you, Chef John, for a quick and tasty new way to prepare potatoes. It's great to have another variation in the arsenal.
