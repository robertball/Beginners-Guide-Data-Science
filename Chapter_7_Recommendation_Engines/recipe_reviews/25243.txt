I prepared these exactly as written, right down to the fresh bread crumbs. I did, however, ignore the baking time, as 20 minutes at 400 degrees is WAY too long!  I baked these for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, then hit them with the broiler for a couple of minutes.  Simply beautiful, delicious, fresh tasting, and a colorful addition to the dinner plate! You just can't go wrong with good, simple, fresh ingredients!

This is really good! But it definitly does not taste like pizza. If you like tomatoes this is definitly worth trying. I didn't make the recipe exactly as stated. I sprinkled on parmesan,then garlic salt/pepper,then sprinkled on dry Italian bread crumbs, sprayed with tops lighly with cooking spray (olive oil) then sprinkled on oregano. My husband loved them and ate almost the entire pan by himself. I plan on passing this recipe out to friends and family soon.

Awesome!  Just as the submitter states these do tastes just like pizza without the crust! After I cut the tomatoes I sprinkled them with a bit of kosher salt then started layering the rest of the ingredients. I didn't have fresh bread crumbs so I used italian style. I have to admit I just eyeballed everything.  I also used parmesan cheese.  On a couple of them I used some light mozzarella to really take them over the top! This dish is great as an appetizer or a side.  Thank for a great recipe!

I suggest cutting the tomatoes thicker than stated.  I mixed Italian style bread crumbs, garlic and the oregano and topped the tomatoes then sprinkled on some shredded parmesan, salt and pepper, and drizzled with olive oil.  I only baked for 15 minutes then set the oven to broil for just a couple of minutes to toast the tops a little.  Very tasty and a nice change for a vegetable side dish.

I think the cooking time on these needs to be adjusted. We cooked them as stated and they were mushy and too soft. If I make these again I will reduce the oven temp and cooking time.

Two words:  dee licious!!!  I made this for Thanksgiving for color and variety.  My only change was to use way more than a clove of garlic.  We're garlic lovers here, so I pressed a lot of cloves of garlic and sprinkled it on.  It was also very easy to assemble in the morning and I popped it in the oven after the turkey came out.  I doubled the recipe and overlapped the slices in a casserole dish, so it came out looking very pretty as well.  Thanks, Michele, for a perfect recipe!

I used Parmesan instead of Romano.  I used store bought Italian bread crumbs instead of home made and I sprinkled the top with mozzerella. It was great!  This recipe will be used again and again.  I wish I'd found it at the beginning of the summer instead of the end.  This is a keeper.

WOW I really liked this one.  Hubby took the kids bowling (well except the baby) so I scaled it down & made it for me, and it was even better than I thought it would be.  I used roma tomatoes (2) & layered it in a remekin (tomato, cheese, parsley, garlic, crumb etc.) until it was full & baked it in my toaster oven (for the sake of ease).  Very good light dish, can't wait to have it with homegrown tomatoes and some crumbled feta cheese!  Thanks Michele!

I arranged the tomatoes in a flat oven proof serving dish in an overlapping fashion. I used about a 1/2 cup of parmesan and mozzerella and baked it approximately 15 minutes. Then waited until just before serving to add the cheese and let it bubble and slightly brown. A great make ahead dish for a party.....beautiful and very good tasting, especially with vine ripened home grown tomatoes from the garden.

This was pretty good and I loved that it was healthy. I might add a little more cheese to it next time, but that is because I love romano cheese. I think it's a great side dish to make for dinner. I added Progresso's garlic and herb bread crumbs and that made it taste yummy.

Very yummy Michele.  I used Panko breadcrumbs along with some garlic and onion powders.  I also used some butter to hold the filling together and then drizzled the olive oil over each one.  I didn't have to bake mine quite 20 minutes...it was closer to 15, but I didn't want my tomatoes to be too soft either.  Definitely a keeper.

As simple, easy, appetizingly pleasing to the eye, I soo loved this. What really amazed me what that my 11 year old son, attempted, tasted and really liked these little guys. I think that floored me more then anything that he ate 4 slices. Now back to these little maters....I used Romo tomatoes, since I use a lot of them. They are always in the house. I also used Italian Panko Bread Crumbs in place of fresh. I mixed all my ingredients together but the cheese and olive oil. And did not add salt or pepper. Next time I think I will use shredded Romano to top instead of grated because you couldn't see the cheese on the top after baking but I know it was there, but could soo taste it.. But soo delish. Light, flavorful and simply awesome. Thanks I'll soo make this again and again..

Just ok...nothing exceptional.  I think if I make them again, I'll up the cheese and decrease the bread crumbs.  They smelled fabulous, but the taste didn't quite match the smell.  Good, just not outstanding.

Made this as a side dish when I had a beef/chicken/shrimp fondue party.  Everybody loved them.  I chose to serve these because they did not need to be piping hot and still tasted good even as they cooled off as we were cooking our meat in the pot.

Wow! This recipe is one of the best I've made from this site in a long time! It's super simple to put together, but tastes like a million bucks. I had no Romano cheese, so I subbed grated parmesan. Also, I was out of fresh parsley, so I used fresh basil instead. Other than that, I used the ingredients listed. I baked the tomatoes at 400 as the recipe suggests, but only for 10 minutes, to soften the tomatoes. The topping didn't seem done enough, so I popped the cooked tomatoes under the broiler for about 5 minutes to brown and crisp the crumbs. The end result is a deliciously soft, melt-in-your-mouth tomato topped with a crispy, delicious topping that is certainly reminiscent of pizza, except so much healthier! Thanks for sharing this recipe...I'd make it again and again!

I made these. They were good. I followed the 350 for 10 mins and broil for a few mins. They came out beautiful.  I did use garlic powder, a blend of parm/mozz cheese and oregano. I served on toasted thin bagels with a bit of light mayo and crispy bacon. Everyone is happy!!  TY!

Very good! I used a shredded blend of Italian cheeses and just sprayed everything lightly with olive oil cooking spray to save a few calories. Thanks :)

This was a great and delicious way to use up tomatoes!  I used roma tomatoes....I cut them in half lengthwise and placed in a baking dish just big enough to fit all the halves.  Then I sprinkled each half with parmesan, Italian bread crumbs, fresh chopped garlic, dried parsley, salt, pepper, and oregano.  Then I topped each half with shredded mozzarella and drizzled with olive oil.  I baked for about 20 or 25 minutes at 350, then placed under the broiler for another few minutes.  Magnificent!

YEAH, this recipe works!! Didn't make any changes, although I didn't have any olive oil on hand. That didn't mess it up at all but I will use it next time just to see the difference. The one thing that I will change is too not add the bread crumbs until the cheese has melted a little more thoroughly. The bread crumbs on top prevented the cheese directly under it from melting completely. A very MINOR problem so don't let that stop you from making this wonderful side dish. Served with "Creamy Pesto Shrimp" from this website. Exceptional compliments to one another. Thanks Michele!!!

Pretty good, but I don't know if I'd make it again.  It would definitely be better in the summertime, with fresh homegrown tomatoes.  Maybe I'll try it again then.

These really don't taste anything like pizza but they are pretty good just the same.  I used packaged bread crumbs but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

This was pretty good, only baked it for 15 minutes but it turned out just fine, but definately didn't taste like any pizza I've had. My two year old loved this, which was awsome. This would go well as a prelude to a chicken or seafood dinner.

Simple, healthy and good! It tasted like fresh tomato pizza. I'm bummed out that I didn't have any breadcrumbs or panko because I had just used it a few days ago, but it was still wonderful. I'm also shocked that my daughter really liked it knowing that she hates tomatoes....big big surprise...thank you so much!

These tomatoes were awesome! Instead of using dried oregano, I used fresh basil & they turned out great! Next time I think I'm going to omit the olive oil since the cheese has enough oil to flavor them nicely. We ate these on club sandwiches and it added such delicious flavor! Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it. It's so quick and easy to make.  I used mozzarella instead of romano and baked for 10 minutes only.  The tomatoes were hot and juicy and the bread crumbs gave it a crunch.

Excellent recipe! I used plum tomatoes, more garlic and I had cheddar, mozzarella, provolone, feta and parmesan on hand, so I used all of the above because more cheese just means extra goodness! Broiled them for only a few minutes and my guests mouths were watering.

These were really a great side dish.  I didn't have fresh parsley so substituted fresh basil and also added a bit of shredded mazzarello on top. No leftovers.

Very easy.  I served these with Cajun Chicken, which I highly recommend.  They did turn out mushy, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me.  My boyfriend hates tomatoes, but he really liked the top crust.  Next time I will make these for myself as a snack - but, with a lot more cheese.

This really did taste like pizza, I don't know if I likes that or not.  I was expecting a fresh tomatoe taste.  I definetly needed to add salt when done baking b/c it had a tart taste.  I used tomatoe and garlic feta cheese(since I made it with the chicken feta from this site) swiss and parm.  I think it was definetly better with more cheese and crumbs.  My b.f enjoyed which is a good sign since he usally doesn't like that sort of vegtable thing.  Overall I would make again.

I liked these baked tomatoes very much, but I agree with a previous reviewer that they needed a little more "kick" to them.  After I took them out of the oven, I added parmesan cheese and a little more salt and pepper.  When I baked them, I added more oregano that was called for and some basil.  It tasted great.  My husband loved them!  Be warned, though..  This is not a substitute for pizza, especially for kids!  Thank you for a great recipe, Michele!

Made this tonight by putting the Roma tomato halves in a muffin tin sprayed with canola then topping.  Easily modifiable and a tasty variant on the tomato side dish.  Will make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did use garlic powder instead of the real stuff. Next time I would definitely cook for a shorter time as these turned out mushy.

YUMMMMMM! Really good...i had a few leftover tomatoes and romano cheese that I did not know what to do with. Saw the great reviews and decided to try this recipe out. The flavors melded together perfectly. Healthy too, a great way to add flair to a boring vegetable!

Very Good!  Like pizza, you can top it with anything you want.  I had some leftover italian meatballs that I crumbled on top of the tomatoes.  I will definitely make these again.  I agree with previous posts about reducing the cook time or using thicker slices if you want a firmer tomato.

I made this as part of the "Oldest recipe in your recipe box" challenge.  This one has been sitting in my box unmade for five years.  I'm glad I made it.  It was very good.  Sometimes the simplest easiest recipes using fresh ingredients are delicious.  This is one of those.  It could not be any easier.  It looked and tasted delicious.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of fresh and parmesan cheese instead of romano since that is what I had on hand.  This would be great to make on a weeknight as a side dish.  I certainly won't wait so long to make this one again.

VERY GOOD!!  I did cheat on this one and used panko rather than the fresh bread crumbs.  I also went a little heavy on the Romano and just eyeballed the fresh parsley, probably adding more than called for.  Even though my result was five star, I do think the baking time and temp are excessive.  I baked mine for about 15 minutes at 350 and that was even a bit too long.  Next time I would cut that to maybe 10 minutes.  Also, remember that the ripeness of your tomatoes will dictate how long to cook them.  The riper the tomato, the more quickly it will turn to mush.

Like others suggested, I baked this for less time at 350.  I also used fresh oregano and a little basil.  It turned out pretty good; my family enjoyed them.  However, it made way too much, even with just three tomatoes, so next time I'll make half the recipe.  I think it would be better with mozzarella and more herbs next time, as well.

Good and different to do with all those garden tomatoes.  Next time I will put the cheese on just long enough to melt as.  The cooking time was too long.  I followed the other reviews and cooked it @ 350 for 10 min. then turned the broil on for just a minute to brown.

This was scrumptious!  I used parmesan cheese instead of romano, because romano is a bit too strong for me (I know, I'm a wimp). I topped the tomatoes with a little grated mozzarella and then I mixed the breadcrumbs, cheese, seasonings, garlic, oil and parsley all together before sprinkling it all over the tomatoes.  This was a big hit, and we enjoyed it very much!

I just made this for dinner and it was soooo good that as soon as I was done doing the dishes, I rushed to my laptop to rate it 5 stars. Since I was making it for myself, I used two tomatoes on the vine and lined them in a small baking dish. I sprinkled kosher salt right on top of the tomatoes, and then added the garlic and parsley. After that, I combined 1/4 cup of Progresso's Italian Style bread crumbs and 1/4 teaspoon of dried oregano together and used half of the mixture first. I substituted feta cheese  instead of the romano and then finished the dish with the last half of the bread crumb mixture. Sprinkled a little more feta cheese, cracked fresh black pepper and drizzled the olive oil. Put it in the oven at 350 for 10 mins. It was perfect! I plan on making this again for lunch tomorrow... Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is a great basic recipe for baked tomatoes. I halved my tomatoes, seeded them to remove the bitter taste of the seeds and extra moisture, and added as much of the toppings as I felt each tomato half needed. The recipe was so simple that I didn't feel the need to stick to the precise measurements of each ingredient. Tip: Fill each tomato pocket with cheese to make this dish truly resemble pizza, the healthier version. If you use fresh parsley, add it during the last 5 mins of baking otherwise it will burn. Other than that, this dish was delicious and very simple!

This is a delicious recipe. It's also a great way to serve "winter tomatoes" when it's off season and all the tomatoes in the grocery are bland. I served it with grilled flank steak. YUM!

A quick & easy recipe that is beautiful as a side dish to any meat. The romano cheese does wonders to this recipe. Thanks

I had some extra tomatoes from the garden and wanted to make something different, this was excellent.  My husband and I ate all of it and can't wait to have it again.  Easy and very tasty.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  It was great and very easy.  I have a million tomatoes right now and this will be a great way to use them as I am making it for a big family get together.  Thanks Michele for the wonderful recipe.

Let me start out by saying that I HATE tomatoes, but I made this for my fiance who loves them.  Well, we both finished them off and even I had seconds!  They were so good!  They really do taste like a pizza.  I didn't have any romano cheese, so I used parmesan, and I added some basil as well.  These will be made again!  Thanks!

i made this as a side dish for a dinner party i had, and the response was wonderful - even some of my guests who are usually very picky about whether they eat tomatoes loved it.  it was also relatively easy to make and then throw into the oven while i was cooking other things.

When this finished cooking I was worried that the tomatoes would be have a bizarre and mushy texture.  However, this recipe turned out fabulous and was a very unique and pretty side dish.  I garnished with fresh oregano for presentation.

Nice. The cheese ought to be the last topping so it can melt. I baked for 10 minutes then under broiler for about a minute Also used Panko since that’s what I had.

This is a great recipe!  Easily can be changed to suit individual tastes.  Make these all the time as a snack or side dish.  Even if I do not use the cheese or breadcrumbs / panko.  Just add more herbs or whatever you have on hand or strikes your fancy!

Even though the recipe is called Baked Tomatoes Oregano, I didn't want a strong oregano flavor so I went light with the oregano. I DID want a more garlic flavor, so using garlic powder, I went heavy-handed with it. Instead of the bread crumbs, I used crushed buttery round crackers (which I'd prefer over bread crumbs anyway) to which I added a few tblsp of melted butter just to bring it together; then added the garlic powder, a bit of pepper, and also added in a Parmesan and Romano cheese combo. I had some jalapeno cheddar cheese that needed to be used, so I topped half of the slices with some pieces of it (those were very good). I followed some of the reviewer's suggestions and baked them at 350 for 11 min and then broiled for a minute. Other   cheeses (such as mozzarella) would be great here, too. I can imagine these will be SO much better when the good, garden tomatoes are in season. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these to go along with my dinner tonight using Vine Ripened tomatoes sliced in half and stuffing them. They came out great and will definitely make again. Perhaps next time I'll slice the tomatoes as per the recipe instead of stuffing an entire half tomato. I ended up with too much breading and not enough tomato.

Really delicious with a bit of mozzarella added. Use the best cheese you can, and fresh herbs if they are avilable. It makes a big difference.

For such a simple recipe these were really good.  I also used parmasan cheese(not the powered stuff) and Italian breadcrumbs. I also just sprayed the top with olive oil.  Fantastic and tasty!

These were pretty good!  I did not use the olive oil (didn't need it and it reduced the amount of calories).  I tried reheating the leftover tomatoes the next day and it was not good but they were good when they came out of the oven the first time.  Next time I will high broil the tomatoes for a few minutes at the end.

I loved this but I did reduce temp to 350 and baked for less time and broiled to get the top crunchy.  Served this on a bed of fresh spinach and drizzled balsamic vinegar on it.  Very good and I can't wait for summer tomatoes to make this again.

Made these last night with delicious fresh orange heirloom tomatoes. They were small tomatoes, so I simply halved them and I substituted fresh chopped basil for the parsley and used fresh grated Parmesan cheese in lieu of Romano. I loved them, but my husband said that was a bit much tomato for his taste. Maybe if i had sliced them thinner it would have changed his opinion. If you're a tomato lover, you will love this recipe, though.

Flavor was great!  But the tomatoes very way too mushy cut into 1/4 inch slices and baked at 400 for 20 min as recipe directs. I will make them again but just cut in half as in the picture.  I used panko crumbs b/c I was too lazy to make fresh but they worked well.  Yummy flavor mushy texture except for nice crunch of the panko.

Scrumptious!! I scaled this way down and used one large heirloom tomato.....placed in a grill pan and cooked this baby on the grill.....the tomato was so tender and juicy and the topping of crumbs, cheese, fresh garlic and herbs was really good....will definately make again!

Pretty good.  I love tomatoes, so the recipe was guaranteed to please me, but it did need a little more flavor. I'll be making this again, maybe with a little more seasoning. I've seen a similar recipe that has fresh rosemary and lemon zest in it, and wonder if those would be nice additions.

Very delicious!  I love cooking with tomatoes so this was right up my alley.  It does have an Italian sort of flavor so I suggest serving it with the same type of main dish.

Ingredients list is good, but I changed the batting order. Living in New Jersey with the temperature near 90 degrees,  I made these on the grill.  Used a foil pan,  coated with olive oil, placed tomatoes, then 2 cloves minced garlic,  salt, pepper, oregano, parm/Romano cheese, sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on, then topped with  bagged mozzarella cheese,  sprayed olive oil over all. Placed on top rack of grill, medium heat until the Cheese melted and bread crumbs browned,  about 15 to 20 minutes. Skip the parsley,  never have seen it o  a pizza! Most of the ingredients came from my summer garden,  Farm to table! Delicious!!!

I only had cherry tomatoes and I didn't measure the ingredients. Definitely didn't need to be in the oven that long otherwise it would have been mushy. It was good but not a five star for me.

Turned out pretty good. A nice side dish for our fish. I didn't have everything but utilized what I had....no bread crumbs so I pounded some croutons left over from a salad mix (don't judge) and used the par cheese mix from the same package. I did cut fresh basil, oregano and parsley. I forgot the garlic ( not like me but it was a long day at work ) and didn't use olive oil either. I will do this again because it made such a lovely presentation. Thank you!!

It's alright! I mean you can't eat it alone! It's too much! Haha so I are it with some beef. It was good, but it's like the bread crumbs don't blend well, I mean they just kinda stay dry chillin on top of the tomato. But it was good with the beef. Went well with something else. Not alone! That's all.

We like tomatoes prepared this way very much. Using Romano cheese gave it the salty taste and the bread crumbs gave it the crunch. Great side for the very little effort. I used Heirloom Tomatoes purchased at the Farm Stand.

Absolutely delicious, a healthy and simple way to get that pizza fix. The only change I made was to cook it at 350 rather than 400 because I was afraid it would burn. Be sure to cut the slices thick! Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe was delicious!  I didn't use fresh bread crumbs or parsley but this dish still turned out wonderfully.  I also drizzled a little balsamic over the tomatoes, gave it a good twist :)

Wow, this was good! I started out with a delicious tasting tomato, so you really can't go wrong. Used homemade bread crumbs from a very yeasty Italian Bread, yum! I only had Parm so that's what I used. Very good!

This was a really good side dish. I cut my medium size tomatoes into 3 slices each. I used parmesan cheese and added in the tiniest bit of mozzarella I had in my fridge. Following other reviewers advice I baked these at 350 for just over 10 minutes. I've just realised now that I forgot to drizzle olive oil on these. My non-tomato eating youngest daughter tried one and then took a second and said she would eat these again. Thankyou Michele.

I hate to be the one giving a bad review here... but I just didn't care for this at all. My bf thought this was "OK," however. I didn't expect him to BEG me to make this again, especially since he doesn't care for baked tomatoes anyways (but he WILL eat them). As other's have mentioned, these DO NOT taste like pizza at all (but I can't say I expected them to...)!!! I used my tomato slicer to make thin, even slices, abt. 1/4 in. thick. I used 1 lg. tomato (which was plenty for 2 ppl. - IMHO, 2 tomatoes would be PLENTY for 4 ppl.). I used powdered Romano cheese & Progresso Italian seasoned bread crumbs since I couldn't find fresh at the store & didn't have any stale bread on hand to make my own. I also added ~ 1 T fresh chopped basil instead of parsley (I had it on hand, so why not?) & subbed Italian seasoning for oregano b/c I didn't have any avail. I overlapped my tomato slices in a round baking dish, sprinkled with coarse salt & fresh cracked blk. pepper, spread w/ Romano, breadcrumbs, garlic, seasoning & a drizzle of EVOO, baked @ 350 degrees for 10 min., then topped w/ shredded mozzarella cheese (to taste) & broiled for another 2.5 min. We served this w/ Creamy Pesto Shrimp by Loretta Buffa (thx. for the suggestion Bayou Gator!). Even though I didn't care for either, I must admit that they paired nicely together. Maybe this will float your boat, but it just didn't ours. Thx. anyways :)

Quick and easy...mixed the ramano with a little shredded mozzarella which added a bit more dimension.  I also used a little too much olive oil, so when it says a tbsp, it means a tbsp!  Overall, well received and would do again.

This was really yummy. Didn't cook it as long as it said to, and at a slightly lower temp just because I had other things in the oven at the same time that had to be lower. I just eyeballed all the ingredients, and added garlic powder instead of minced garlic. I'll be making these again.

I did not use fresh bread crumbs (lazy) and I think that affected the taste. Next time I will follow the recipe.  Otherwise, this is a great side dish to basil pesto chicken pasta.

This was very good with ripe tomatoes.  I forgot to put in the parsley and olive oil and it was still good.  My boyfriend had 3 helpings.  It would feed 6 as a side dish.  I served it with a shrimp & squash penne pasta.  Nice, light dinner for the summer.

I enjoyed these. Next time, though, I will slice the tomatos a bit thicker because they fell apart a bit when they were baked. Overall though, very good.

This was very good and flavorful. I used fresh oregano, reduced the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup, and increased the cheese to 1/4 cup. The fresh oregano is the key.

I used fresh oregano, it's what I had on hand.  I also only cooked them about 12 min.  They were hot but not mushy and the top was beautifully browned.  All of my kids (4 kids!) loved them too!

Pretty good.  A little tart for my taste, but that could've just been the tomatoes I purchased.

I made this last night and was not pleased with the way they turned out.  I even used vine ripened garden tomatoes but these were just way too mushy for me.  The flavor was pretty good but the texture was awful.

This was absolutely wonderful. So easy to make and it does taste like a pizza witout the crust.
