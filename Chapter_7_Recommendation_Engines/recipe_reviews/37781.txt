This was easy to make and very good.  I added a little bit of garlic and a bit more milk than the recipe called for.  It tasted better than some of the alfredo sauce I've had in restaurants.

This has to be the fasted alfredo sauce out there.  It did end up a little thick, easy to take care of with some extra milk.  You can also taste the cream cheese so it is not true alfredo, but as easy as it is, who cares.  It was a huge hit at our house and I will be making it again soon.

I really didn't care for this dish. It was way to thick. My husband added more milk to his. I will stick to the alfredo sauce that I usally make.

This is easy and quick to prepare. It is definitely better than restaurant Fettuccine Alfredo. I do add a little more milk than called for. I add crab or lobster meat. It is wonderful! I always have to triple the recipe so everyone can have a second helping and my husband can take to work for his lunch. A family favorite!

This is a great, easy dish to whip up!  My 2 year old loves it....I like to put it with tortellini instead of the fettuccine....It's a great fun dish that everyone will love!

This is sooooo good. It makes a pot full also. The only thing that I altered from the original recipe was adding precooked chicken, broccoli, and roasted red peppers(from a jar). It makes a wonderful pasta dish. Warm, creamy, and very filling.

This was way too rich for me.  Next time I would probably reduce the cream cheese by at least half.

Absolutely wonderful. I am a pasta lover. I've been looking for an alfredo recipe that compares to the ones in the resturants. This one tops them all!! We added 1 pound of shrimp to the recipe--It was delicious!!!

Two of my three boys wouldn't even eat it as it was too sweet and thick.  I am not sure why I tried this, as regular alfredo isn't that hard.  Definitely will make a real alfredo sauce or bechamel sauce for my pasta next time.  Don't waste your time; look for a real alfredo and save some money while you are at it...

Very quick to make. I added chicken and broccoli and it was really good. I also added some more milk to the sauce, as it is VERY thick. Next time I will omit some of the butter and cut the recipe in half...we had lots of leftovers and the sauce does not reheat well.

I was impressed with how smooth and creamy the sauce turned out.  I substituted cream for the milk, and added a half teaspoon of minced garlic.

My kids thought this was okay, I thought it was great.  I used a low fat cream cheeseskim milk  and margerine to cut down on fat.  Next time I'll toss in steamed veggies too.

Every evening I ask my family how many stars on this dinner, and tonight they all said 4 1/2. (Except my youngest son who said 800) So since neither is an option I will put 4. It is very good and very easy. We just added some steamed broccoli and an extra 1/2 cup of milk so it wouldn't be too think. Very Yummy!

I thought this recipe was very easy to do and you didn't have to feel as guilty after eating it - but using some lower fat ingredients might be a bit better.

This is such a quick and easy recipe! Very good even my kids loved it. I added chicken to the recipe. I cut chicken breasts in thin strips, fried in a skillet with lemon pepper seasoning and shazam! This meal was to die for!

Who knew alfredo could be this easy?  It had a very good flavor and was easy to make, but it does not reheat very well.

I used 12oz of fettuccine, and a frozen box of broccoli, and there was still plenty of sauce.  I would suggest adding more milk because the sauce is very very thick.  The sauce has a strong parmesan taste which sort of overpowers everything else.  Doesn't really taste like alfredo, but still has a really nice cheesy taste!  Not bad, especially considering how quick and easy!

I used some romano cheese that I had with the parmesan.  Also I added a little garlic.  The romano gave it an interesting tang.  I also added grilled chicken.  Son even took it in his lunch.  He liked it so much he was willing to eat it cold!!!

This is one fantastic alfredo sauce. I have made it several times, I add garlic or garlic powder and some white ground pepper as that is to my families personal taste.

I've never made Fettuccine Alfredo before, but this was pretty good. I ended up needing 1 C. - 1.5 C. of milk to thin it out a bit and found that it was too milky. Adding another tablespoon of butter took that taste away, though. 
In addition to the ingredients, I added about 1 tsp. of garlic powder and fresh cracked pepper. 
I also like some of the other reviewers made chicken. I boiled 2 chicken breasts until almost done, cut them up into cubes and sauteed them in butter, 2 bruised garlic cloves, 1 T. of garlic infused olive oil, and lemon & pepper. 
This is going to be another one to add to my recipe book. Thanks Kraft!
