This is very good. I did tweak it a little since we like things spicy. First, I doubled the recipe since I have a large oval slow cooker. I added some sauteed diced onions and bell peppers plus some chopped jalapenos (from a can) to the meat mixture. I also added jalapenos to the cornbread mixture. Also, 2/3 cups of milk for 2 packages of corn bread mix was not enough so I just kept adding until it looked like the right consistency. Finally, because the topping didn't brown in the slow cooker, I removed the crock and put it in the oven on "broil" for a couple of minutes. I will definitely make this again.

thanks everyone.. I also "tweak" this recipe. This recipe was given to me by a friend and what I do to tweak it.. I double the meat, double the enchilada sauce, add chilli powder & garlic powder and double the cheese. Sometimes I also add chopped green chili's to the meat mixture. Sure, its just as easy putting this in the oven however, I like cooking things in the slow cooker so I dont have to sit there and watch it... I can throw it in early and have it ready by dinner. Thanks for the reviews this is my first recipe submitted! :)

I made Sals' Red Enchilada Sauce (which hubby said smelled wonderful, and I didn't think to taste before I put it in the meat mixture) for this, then did everything by the recipe. I put a towel over the crockpot under the lid, to keep moisture from dripping back down onto the top. (Thanks to Scotdog? for the tip) There was more muffin mix  than the meat mixture. Hubby and I alone ate half of it. It has a good flavor, not quite spicy enough for us and the meat mixture tasted almost sweet to me. Not sure where that came from. Another crockpot recipe that I don't see any point to. This could be made faster and easier in a 13x9 pan and wouldn't be so hard to get out. Onions and garlic added to the meat while browning would help and maybe some cumin also. Next time it goes in the oven and I double the recipe for the meat mixture and maybe the muffin mix too. Thanks Brandy!

Brandy thank you so much for this recipe. Its a great recipe to easily customize to anyones likes and dislikes.    We cooked the hamburger as making taco meat added 1 can (drained) Ro*Tel and a choppd green and red pepper. Servied with extra cheese and sour cream once all cooked in the slow cooker.    I have both a large oval and stand up 5qt crock pot, i used my stand up to make this recipe and only needed the 1 package of cornbread, if using an oval crock pot i see needing the 2nd package of corn bread to make 1 layer on top.    Again thank you this was great!!!

This was good! My husband and I ate about 2/3 of the meal ourselves. However, like the others, I would double the recipe. It tasted more like chili, but definitely good. Here's what I did:  1 lb. beef & 1 lb. ground turkey 1 can original Rotel 2 cans of kidney beans 1 can of enchilada sauce (I don't care for it) 2 pkg Martha White sweet yellow cornbread mix 2/3 c. milk 2 eggs 4 tbsp melted butter 1 cup shredded 2% cheddar  I browned the beef and turkey with adding garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder. Once browned I added the rotel with most juice drained so the meat could absorb the flavor. Did that for 10 minutes while mixed up the cornbread, milk, eggs, and butter with the cheese. Put the meat mix in the bottom of the crockpot added the bean and sauce. Mixed up really well. Then, poured cornbread mix on top. cooked for 5 hours on low. warmed up nicely the next day in the oven on 400 for about 20 min.

I made a few changes, I added diced onion in the ground beef and used fresh garlic. I also substituted chili beans for the kidney beans. It didn't quite take the full 5 hours to cook, it was GREAT!

This recipe is a keeper.  I will make this often.  I tweaked it a little.  Someone suggested adding jalapeno peppers so I cut and diced two fresh.  I also sauteed an onion and 1/2 green pepper in with the ground beef.  I didn't have enchilada sauce so I used 1 jar of mild salsa and 1 jar of peach salsa.  It gave it a slightly sweet taste.  I also added about 1/2 cup of kefir (similar to sour cream).  This recipe is so versatile and wonderful!

I liked this recipe. I do think it needs more seasoning as it tasted kind of bland. My crockpot is pretty big so the cornbread layer was kind of thin so next time I make it I'll double the cornbread mix. Also mine only took 2 1/2 hours to cook all the way. So I threw it on warm to hold it for dinner.

Possibly a good addition to this recipe would be jalapino cornbread topping.  We also like things a bit spicier and will try this again w/the addition of some spicier spices along w/the jalapino cornbread.  I also think the type of enchilada sauce is a key factor as so many of the canned varieties are not very good at all.  At least the ones we have tried.  Homemade is so much better. I also think this recipe may fair better cooked in the oven.

This is a great recipe for the slow cooker and can be easily adapted to the oven - which is a plus in my cookbook!  I added diced onions and green peppers to the ground beef.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as it's written.  For the oven, I used a 10x10 corning ware dish, cooked it at 400 for 20 minutes and it was great.  With a salad, it fed my family of three heartily, but there were no leftovers the first time.  So, I will double the recipe next time.

Delicious..I tweeked it a bit. I used 1 1/2 lbs ground turkey and 2 boxes of corn bread mix. In my turkey I added a couple cloves crushed garlic, half a finely chopped jalepeno, half an onion, a can of black beans and my own taco seasoning. I stirred in the enchilada sauce. In my cornbread mix I added 1 egg , 1/3 cup milk, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 of a chopped jalepeno. It is so tweeked because I used 2 different recipes and combined the ideas. Lol I put it in the slow cooker onb medium /low for about 4.5 or 5 hrs and it turned out excellent. The leftovers are spectacular too!

This came out just as it appears in the picture and tasted great.  I used 1 lb grnd beef, 2 cans of beans (black and pink kidney) and a 1lb bag of jalepeno corn bread mix.  To the beef,  I ddded fresh green peppers, onions and garlic, cumin (a must), chili powder, 2 jalepenos and dash (or 4) of hot sauce.  After draining beef,  I added about 6T of Pace Chunky Medium salsa, which gave it some good flavor and 1.5 cups of enchilada sauce.  Next time I will  use more salsa and tomato sauce vs enchilada sauce from a can (yuck).   Cooked it on low for about 4 hours.  Really you can eyeball when it's done by looking at the cornbread, which for me had a nice hard crust on top and cooked solid.

Did not taste at all like a tamale, more like a bland, dry chili.

I used the oven method with a 13" x 9" x"3 pan @ about 380 deg.  I had many of the ingredients already in my freezer from over preparing for a batch of chili.  (That is how I found the recipe... I used the ingredient function:  ground beef, kidney beans) My beef mixture already had sauteed onions in it.  I added a can of whole kernal corn to the beef mixture as well as the corn bread batter.  I added a small can of sliced olives, a med size can of chopped green chilis.  I forgot to add the cheese, darnit!  Boy this was easy!  I'll be making this again.  I bet it's even better with the cheese!   I baked until the corn bread was golden brown.  Next time I believe I'll bake the basic ingredients about 25 minutes before I add the cornbread batter to the top.  I think it will be better.  I think it will also help the cornbread cook from the underside.

I doubled the recipe and it was good, but next time I will prepare the meat with actual taco seasoning to give it a little bit of a kick.  I found the enchilada sauce (I used mild) made it kind of bland.  I like it to have a bit more flavor.  It was still good.  I also added a can of corn for more veggies.

Made this and totally loved it!  I did add a few things here and there, mostly because I had them and wanted to use them.  This recipe is one of those that's a great starting off point.  For the people that gave low scores because they thought it could be made faster in the oven, or "didn't see the point" in cooking it in the slow cooker - can't just about anything made in a slow cooker be made a different way, faster?  I look specifically for slow cooker recipes, because I cook at work and don't have a stove or oven.  I never would have thought the cornbread topping would work, so I'm glad this recipe was here.  My family (we own a shop, so we are all here eating out of the slow cooker) gets tired of soup and soupy stuff, so I love seeing recipes for the slow cooker that have something different!

I did not care for this at all.  Yes, too bland.  But even with the added extras (I added diced jalepanos and some spices for heat) it was too much work for an end result of blaaahhh.

I liked this recipe a lot!  I have cooked it twice so far.  One time with the slow cooker (only needed to bake for 2.5 hours)  and another time in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  We like things spicy in my house so I seasoned the ground beef with taco seasoning and browned with onions. Then I  shaked some hot sauce into the beef/ bean mixture til I got the right taste.  My family loved it both ways.  I serve with corn that we spoon over the pie, and top off with more shredded cheese, and sour cream. Also, if you think it is too dry just use some more enchilada sauce.

I want to warn first time users of this recipe that it only took 3 hrs. on low in our Hamilton Beach slow cooker.  I also tweaked the recipe.  First I cooked and drained the meat.  Next returned the meat to the skillet  added a medium chopped onion, & one clove minced garlic.  Sauteed this until the onion was transparent.  We don't care for kidney beans so I substituted bush's mild chili beans. Added the enchilada sauce as directed & put in the bottom of the crockpot.  In small skillet I sauteed 2 T chopped red bell bepper, 1 jalapeno chopped(seeds removed), & 1/4 med. onion chopped.  Lastly I added 1/3 C frozen corn to th skillet & cooked it until just warm. Added the sauteed veggies to the cornbread toping mixture.  Topped the meat mixture.  Tweak it with what your family prefers.  Just be sure to check it as your crockpot may cook fast like mine.  I will definitely make it again.

I am going to rate this low even though I did make a couple changes that I don't think impacted the outcome negatively.  I did saute some onion and one clove of garlic with the meat and also added a touch of cumin and a cup of frozen corn.  With that said, I really think this needed more flavor and more heat.  Maybe some diced jalapenos.  I used jiffy cornbread mix since it was the only one I could find of that size and thought it was way to sweet for our liking.

This recipe is very tasty. The only thing I would suggest is not using a slow cooker to make it in.  It's so much better if you bake it in the oven. I bake it at 350 for around 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Usually I add sliced black olives and onions to the meat mixture. It's so good baked, because the top is nice and crunchy, which is especially yummy if you sprinkle some shredded cheddar on top before you bake.

Mmmmm, with some doctoring this recipe is great! I browned my lean ground beef with onion and spices (garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper). I added a can of Rotel, can of green chilis, can of corn and some salsa to the meat when I put it in the crock pot (no enchilada sauce- that sounded gross to me). It only needed about 3.5 hours to cook. I was worried it would be soggy bc of all the moisture in the crock pot, especially on the lid, but it wasn't. Served it with sour cream and shredded cheese. It's not a recipe I would put in the crock pot before work and let it cook all day, but it was great for a Saturday afternoon :)

I don't know if we did something wrong but this recipe was very bland. We served it on fight night and other people ate it so maybe it's just a matter of preference. Too bad because I like the concept.

I will try this again because I think the reason I wasn't a huge fan of it was my own fault.  It didn't seem to have enough meat for the amount of corn bread on top.

Giving this 5 stars because it's such a great idea but, believe me, we're the mild family, nothing hot and spicy - this was truly bland. I even added half a bottle of salsa and some chili powder to the mixture and it was fairly tasteless, I think the way to spice it up will be to add a packet of taco seasoning to the browned beef and simmer a bit. I will also add a whole bottle of salsa and more than a bit of chili powder. However, the corn bread rocked! I was a bit worried if the corn bread would get done, be gooey or hard as a rock. It was perfect and I really believe with some tweaking this recipe will become one of our favorites.

I ran out of time so I baked it in the oven.  Just bake it by the cornbread directions.  I liked the way the sweetness of the cornbread cancelled out some of the spiciness of the enchilada sauce.

Too bland.  Theres too much breading as well.  Need more meat and beans and a lot more seasoning as well as more pepppers to offset the amount of breading.  I also think it might be better to just mix it in and let it form more like a casserole rathern than just cooking accross the top.

I doubled this recipe. It came out ok. I forgot to add the cheese. I added that when it was dished out. To me it was a little bland. I think it could have used a little more spice to it possibly a little more sauce. My hubby enjoyed this alot. Pretty quick and easy though.

Loved this recipe! Did modify a bit, as others have. Sauteed onion, red bell pepper and half a fresh jalapeno pepper until translucent. Added beef to pot and browned. Added several shakes of Mrs. Dash Spicy. When browned, put beef mixture in crock pot, added a can of medium spicy enchilada sauce and one small can tomato paste. Also added half a bag of frozen corn and a small can of sliced black olives. I used 2 boxes of Jiff cornbread mix, 2 eggs and 2/3 cup of milk mixed, then added 1 cup cheddar cheese. I poured that on top of the beef already in the crock pot and put it on low for 4 hours. When it was done, I topped it with more cheddar cheese and more black olives and then put it under the broiler just to melt the cheese.

I found this recipe, & immediately wanted to make it with my own spin.
I am a Paramedic & we are never in the station very long so this was a perfect recipe & the guys loved it!
I used ground turkey instead of beef , taco seasoning, added a can of black olives, & a can of corn to meat along with the beans.
Topped with chopped green onions & sour cream.
Thanks we loved it!!

With a few tweaks this was delicious and there were no leftovers between my roommates and I. Plus, as a college kid, the ingredients are affordable and easy to have on hand. I fried the hamburger with onion and seasoned it with taco seasoning. I didn't have enchilada sauce so I used a jar of salsa. I added some cumin and red pepper flakes to make sure it wasn't bland. It only took about 3.5 hours in the crock pot and everything was great!Highly recommended.

There was too much cornbread:meat & bean mixture, too much garlic, and something was just missing. I knew I was not going to recreate a tamale, but I was looking for a flavor profile & this is close, but just lacking somehow. I want to try it again, but I'll spend some time picking apart my leftovers to come up with ideas to tweak it.

I made this exactly as written except that I doubled the cornbread portion as directed by other reviewers for my large crockpot.  The whole family liked it, but I thought the layer of cornbread was disproportionately thick.  Next time I will stick to one box of cornbread, and I will probably try to spice it up some more.  It was a little bland for my taste.

This is my husband's favorite!!!!  He asks for it at least once a month!  The only thing I do different is make it in the oven instead of the crockpot.  Delicious topped with green chiles and sour cream!

I made this for lunch yesterday.  We have been having over 100 temps for two months now and yesterday was our first cool front of the year so it was a nice 75 degrees around lunch and I thought it would be the perfect day for this.  I made this per the directions except I used fresh garlic and I added a can of corn.  Me and my son loved it.  My husband made no comment either way.  My girls said eww but neither even tried it.  They don't like things mixed together.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was so nice to throw the ingredients in the crock pot and while it cooked play games with the kids. Next time I make it though I will add the corn bread topping later or not cook it as long as it said to because the corn bread was dry!

Just a suggestion "Kitchen" staff. This is a good base recipe, but is bland made as is. Mexican casserole might be better title as you will need the extra onion, pepper, salsa, chilies,etc. to taste well.

I had high hopes for this recipe and I was sorely disappointed! It tasted nothing like tamales! If I make something like this again I will use shredded slow cooker beef, jalapenos & spices with tamale sauce and a masa harina dough and layer it. perhaps bake it in the oven. On a good note, the guys really liked it when I put it on a bed of crushed lime tortillas and lettuce with salsa ranch dressing and extra cheese.

Like other reviewers, I did not like the sweetness of the corn bread.  I don't like sweet things in general, but this didn't seem to "go" with the other flavors very well.  I would make this again, but I would modify some things.

I didn't do slow cooker method just baked in oven My husband loved the cornbread topping but I found it to sweet for my liking. I added taco seasoning to give it more taste it was really to bland for me with just the enchalida sause and beans. 2 stars basically it was chilli.

This was fantastic!  I doubled the meat, and added minced garlic and jalepenos.  I added chile powder and cumin to the meat while it was browning.  I also doubled the enchilada sauce.  I ran out of cheese, but I had tons of cheddar sliced cheese, so I sliced those up and put them in my cornbread.  I also laid a little cheese slice wall up between my meat and cornbread mixture.  I didn't have Jiffy, so I had to make my cornbread, but it was really easy: 1 cup of corn meal, 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, 2/3 cup canola oil, 3 1/2 tsps baking powder, and 1/3 cup milk.  It turned out so amazingly wonderful, I can't believe I made it!  I'll be making this one a lot.  :) And I can tell you, as I'm sitting here eating the leftovers, that it's still fantastic the next day.  ;) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe says- something rare for me!  It was very yummy, a definite keeper.  I don't think I would add anything to it, maybe have salsa as a condiment option.

I thank you for this. I will make this again, but I will not use the packaged corn bread mix, it was so sweet, I did not like it. I will make the crust using masa harina and peppers. I also liked it better with black beans instead of the kidney beans.

My husband loved this.  I threw in 1/2 of a red onion (chopped) & a can of green chilies - just to get some veggies in there.  Next time I may add a whole red onion, couldn't really taste it and we love onion.  Also, my slow cooker always seems to cook faster than it should, so it was done at least 1 hour early.

A great, simple-to-make dinner for those busy days.  The only change I made was adding some diced onions to the beef and a bit more cheese to the cornbread mix.  The kids loved it, especially served with some sour cream on the side.  I will make this again.

Followed the recipe as written and we enjoyed it, but all agreed that there was WAY too much cornbread! And we like our bread, but the ratio of bread layer to meat layer was just totally out of proportion, IMHO. Also, while yummy, this is really nothing like a tamale... more like a kind of Mexicali shepard's pie, with the cornbread replacing the mashed potatoes.

Loved this recipe, the only thing I would change though is I would double up on the meat, beans and enchilada sauce to the one part corn bread.  Other than that it was fabulous.  I served it with sour cream on top...yummy!

The hubby and I loved this dish!  The kids, not so much.  Next time, I would definitely double this recipe and be sure to eat it soon after it's completed, as it tends to get dry after awhile.  Thanks for a quick, easy and tasty recipe!

This was good, but I found it a little bland. I would add more beef and maybe pinto beans instead. The kidney beans were too large and even 5 hours wasn't enough to soften those guys up fully!  I even think refried beans would be awesome in this.  It also needs more enchilada sauce than what it calls for.... I would make this again but would add a lot of other things to it

Wow, talk about a great tasting easy to make dinner.  Smells great when it cooks, we almost had all of the ingredients to make it without going to the store.  Next time I will make it more spicey and a double recipe.  Its that good.

I made this last night for dinner and it was a huge hit.  The recipe itself sounded yummy but after reading the reviews I decided to tweak it a little also.  First I used mexican style cornbread mix which gave it a little extra flavor.  Also I added some hot sauce to the mixture to add a little spice & onion powder which helped and topped off with extra cheese and sour cream.  Also baked this recipe rather than using the crock pot and this worked great and cooked in less than 30 minutes.  We are adding this to our dinner rotation. My boyfriend and I both had seconds and there were still leftovers.

The only change I made to this was doubling up on the ground beef. In doing that, it was a little dry and I think adding another can of enchilada sauce would have been a good thing. Other than that, it was a nice meal. It's not hot at all which we like, so if you like hot, you'll have to adjust to your tastes. This worked perfectly in a 4 qt oblong slow cooker.

This one didn't do it for me.  In the words of R.M.Nixon, "I'm not blaming anyone!"  Mine turned out rather dry and bland after following recipe as offered.  I love good Mex food, including tamales, bu this wasn't it.

The flavor was good but it was really dry. After 4 hours on low the edges started burning. Don't think I will try it again.

This recipe is a great template.  You can add almost any ingredients you'd like to suit your taste.  We added corn, tomatoes, diced chilies and olives.  We also prefer a homemade cornbread topping, therefore we did not use the boxed option.  It really doesn't take much more time to make it homemade.  Thanks for this recipe.  We loved it and will use often.

Fascinating recipe. I followed it to the letter and ended up putting some hot sauce on the finished product for some additional zest. I'm not sure if I would make this as is again, it was a smidge bland for me, but this is a really clever base for future things. I didn't know you could make muffin mix in the slow cooker! 

My only major observation is this had an eerily similar texture to banana bread.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was dried out (probably overcooked) and bland. We doctored it up with salsa and sour cream and it was better, but I probably won't make it again.

I thought this turned out delicious.  It was very easy and so tasty.  The corn bread on top was sweet and the filling was tasty.  I doubled the corn bread but it turnedout to be too much.  I"m making it again and doubling the filling and keeping it a single layer corn bread.  I also added onions and other veggies.

Excellent .... I always add chopped onions and chopped garlic when browning ground turkey.  I added some Chili powder, too.  I used white kidney beans but next time I will used corn instead.  I was amazed how nice the corn bread turned out.  Totally, totally YUMMY.  We will be having this often.

Very yummy! -although I tweaked the recipe a bit based on other reviewer comments.  Others said the bread was too much compared to meat mixture. I didn't want to add more meat so added veggies. Added about 1/3 C canned (Trader Joes) corn, 2.3 oz can sliced olives, 14.5 oz can of Trader Joes diced & fire roasted tomatoes with organic green chiles.  As others I also sauteed onions with the ground beef and also threw in 2 frozen Dorot crushed garlic cubes (equiv 2 cloves).  Used 12 oz bottle of Trader Joe's enchilada sauce.  Also put shredded cheese on top of corn bread topping instead of mixed with it.  Digital crock-pot ran for 8 hrs on low, then on warm for another 2 (no delay start).  Family doesn't do too spicy & this came out perfect for us. Served w/dollop of sour cream to tame it when needed.  Will next try making it vegetarian w/Morningstar Mealstarters & will report back. :)

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as-is and it was only OK. Frankly, we just didn’t like the kidney beans. But I liked the enchilada sauce and thought the recipe might be worth a try with some tweaking. Instead of kidney beans, I substituted a layer of low-fat refried beans. I also cooked this in the oven because I was pressed for time. It was great - my husband and son loved it!

This was a huge hit, and even my boys, 11 and 7, went back for seconds.  That's hard to do because they are picky eaters.  The only thing I would change though is doubling the meat and enchilada sauce.  The cornbread seemed to much for the amount of meat mixture.  Will definitely be making this again.  I don't think my boys will let me forget this one.

Great and easy! Even my picky son gobbled it up! I took the advice of other reviewers and added a jar of Pace Picante sauce. (dumped the whole thing in by mistake-but it was fine!) I also subbed black beans for the kidney beans. While I will definitely make it again, I think I will tweak the recipe further.  I thought the ratio of cornbread (too much) to meat was off - so I will use 2lbs of meat next time. I would like to try 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef. My husband thinks that corn would be a good addition to the meat-so I will throw in a cup of frozen kernels. I think a can of diced tomatoes (with chilis) or a chunkier salsa would be a good addition. I didn't find that the cheese was noticible in the cornbread, I'd like to add it to the meat mixture instead. I cooked it exactly 5 hours on low and it was perfect. I think it's a great recipe and very adaptable to whatever you have on hand and your own preferences!

Really fabulous!!  I took another reviewer's advice and added a taco seasoning , (my own mixture), to the meat while browning in the frying pan.  I also used onion and garlic during that time too!   I added more enchilada sauce as someone suggested.  I didn't have to cook it in the slow cooker for the full 5 hours.  My corn bread seemed to set way before then.  It was delicous and there weren't many leftovers!!

I only didn't give it 5 stars because my topping never fully set up and I couldn't understand why.  I added jalepenos to the corn bread topping and green chilies to the mixture to spice it up.  It was a hit regardless of the doughy topping.

This recipe was good. It is great for a quick throw-together meal. I made mine with ground turkey instead of beef and think it lacked in the richness of taste. Next time will make it with beef. Good recipe.

My husband loved it!  I used turkey instead of ground beef, and I added a can of tomatoes with chili seasoning.  I was surprised how much the corn bread mix tasted like tamales.  This recipe will be one of my regulars.

My husband LOVED this..my 4 kids liked it too.  I added some black beans as well...and it had a more chili consistancy. the Cornbread mixture on tope was really good... but next time I'll add some more cheese.  It was NOT spicy...so..if you like spices add more...perhaps some green chilis or mexican spices.  We will definetly make this again.

I found this recipe today and I made it today.  I was impressed.  I had my reservations about it, but it was really good.  My fiance and two little picky eaters gobbled it up!  Thanks Brandy!  I did use Trappeys Ranch Style Beans instead of Kidney Beans, but other than that it was great!

this was wonderful- made it exactly as written and the corn bread texture was very much like a tamale texture. I think that is why it is better done in a slow cooker than in the oven. This will become a "go-to" meal for us. Tweaking it gives all sorts of flavor possibilities, but always in the crock pot and skip the towel- the falling moisture adds to the right texture to make the corn bread tamale like!!! Thanks Brandy

I made this last night in my oven @400 degrees for 30 minutes because I forgot to put it in the crockpot before I left for work.  It came out fantastic...I made the following changes: added diced onions to the ground beef while it was browning and then added Franks's Hot  Sauce to the mixture as whll as Chili Powder.  We each had seconds and there was enough left over for hubby to take to work the next day for lunch.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I gave this 4 stars, because there is nothing special about it, and I modified the recipe a bit.  I did not use the slow cooker, as I didn't need to be away from home all day.  It baked well in the oven, and only took about 30 mins.  I also browned the meat with onions & garlic to give it more flavor.  I think the corn bread to meat mixture ratio is too high.  I would cut down the corn bread next time.  My husband and 3 year old approved.

This has the potential to be a very good slow cooker recipe.  Made as is, with only the addition of a can or drained rotel, the end product was dry.  It had all the right flavors but the meat mixure need to be doubled as well as more moisture added.  Additional enchilada sauce and not draining the rotel would probably help greatly.   I also used black beans instead of kidney beans just out of personal preference.  Cooking time could have been shortened by atleast one hour but it would probably vary in different slow cookers.  Additional cheese would also be good if added in the final hour of cooking as well.  I will definately make this again with a few modifications.

Pretty good!  I followed the recipe exactly. Next time will add some things to make it spicer. I agree that it taste like chili.  The cornbread sucked up all the liquid so it didnt make good leftovers.

I made this as written with only two small changes. I added onion when the beef was almost brown, because we have onion in just about everything and I did not have red kidney beans as shown in the picture so I used white kidney beans. I divided the mixture into two smaller baking dishes, cooked both and froze one for another night, there is only 2 of us. I gave it only four stars because I think it needed something. May try adding green chilies next time, but will definitely make it again.

My family loved this football Sunday slow cooker entrée! I eliminated kidney beans, and replaced with canned corn. I also added diced chili peppers to the meat mixture, along with a can of Rotel tomatoes/chilis added to the corn bread in place of the milk.  Turned out great!!

So delicious and so easy! I used black beans instead of kidney beans and added a small can of diced green chilies. Since I can’t eat eggs I substituted a 1/3 cup of applesauce. It was a big hit for an office meeting.

Made the following changes: sauteed diced onion and garlic with meat and seasoned with cumin. Also added a few sliced and diced jalapeno slices to bean mixture with 1 cup corn. Like Mexican cornbread so used that instead for even more flavor. I like it spicy!

This recipe definitely needs to be tweaked,  with some extra spices.  It's pretty bland.  The enchilada sauce does nothing  for the flavor.  I did add onions,  but it didn't help.  I won't make it again.

This is a great recipe my husband and son really love it. I added corn,black beans, and green chilies turns out absolutely delicious  hardly ever any leftovers so you almost need to double the recipe.

This was very good. We had it for dinner and we liked it.  Enough flexibility in the recipe  to custom to your tastes.  I'll   make it again.

I hate beans so I omitted them and did spicy ground sausage and ground Hamburg. I added lots of course ground pepper, chili sauce, and cayenne pepper! So good!

Tweaked because I was following another recipe at first and bought total mild diced tomatoes & green chile, mixed beef with taco seasoning, 1/2 tsp cumin, can of black beans, can of whole corn, didn't have enchilada sauce-so added about a cup salsa, cornbread mix, (used 2 eggs, 2/3 cup milk)- turned out great! Would repeat trying original recipe.

This is decent for a slow cooker recipe that is different from the norm. Way too many beans... I only did 1/3 can... Also... It's a very heavy dish and is repeating on me. The taste was good though!

Simple to make and very tasty! Used turkey meat instead and added onion and a can of corn to the recipe. Purchased the spiciest level of enchilada sauce by accident and it wasn't too spicy, added nice flavor. Completely forgot to add garlic powder. I sprinkled a touch of salt to the top of the corn bread when it first went in to the slow cooker.

I made this recipe and it was outstanding. My boyfriend raved over it. I did tweet the ingredients-added jalapeños, onion, garlic and taco seasoning since I love spicy foods. This one I will make again!

The ground beef was too mushy and the cornbread turned into a crust, not a bread.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and should have added corn.  It also needs a lot more seasoning.  I do not plan on making this again.

I thought it was too bland.  Also, I think it would have been better cooked in the oven; then the cornbread would have been crispy instead of soggy.

Sorry to say we didn't care for this much, no flavor, Hubby added hot sauce he said that helped. Don't believe I will be making this again, very disappointed.

I made this on a cold rainy Fall day...it was excellent.  I too tweaked it just a bit.  I added chopped onion, jalapeno peppers from my garden and a clove of garlic instead of the powder.  The enchilada sauce seasoned it perfectly.  It was very good and I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Omit butter and cheese.  Cook fresh garlic while browning the meat.  Use pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  Use 19 oz can enchilada sauce.  Bake in oven at 350 for 30 min.

Very easy! I did add taco seasoning and also used chili beans cause thats what i had on hand. I was eager to eat and just baked it for as long as the jiffy package said the corn bread would take!

This recipie looked good but it missed the mark in several ways. the cornbread did not cook all the way through and I thought it may be my crockpot but I could tell it wasn't because the meat and beans were burnt. Secondly, the portions were innacurate. This would have fed 3 people at best, not 6, so I was dissapointed. Lastly, I used fresh garlic, chili powder, salt, pepper, cumin and it was still underseasoned. I would need to alter this a lot to make it again but I would rather make something else at that point.

With some modifications, this has fast become a favorite go-to for me.

Following other reviewers' suggestions, I double everything.

I also add sauteed onion, green bell pepper, olives and canned chopped jalapenos to the meat mixture.

Using medium spiciness enchilada sauce is worth the extra flavor, though it's harder to find.

Also, I don't really see much of a point in using the slow cooker for this--it's just as easy and way faster to pop it in the oven.

I really enjoyed this and I must add it was kid friendly. I asked the kids what they would like in it and they add kidney beans and corn..instead of enchalada sauce I used a can of tomatoe sauce and two packets of taco seasoning. I douple the reciepe. except fore the cornbread I only used the one box..did find out the edges in the crock pot didnt cook as well still was a little mushy after 5 hrs, but all in all I really liked this and so did  my family which was the best part they are the real judges of my reciepe finds.

My tweak was to make it Gluten Free.  I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Cornbread Mix.  I may make this vegetarian for a "Meatless Monday" meal by adding diced red and green bell peppers, black beans, red kidney, and pintos instead of the ground beef.

Cooking wise it was easy to put together and cook, but flavor wise it wasn't anything fantastic. It is okay if you fix it up with salsa, sour cream, and more cheese. I would be ok for a quick fix supper when you are busy. I think you could probably throw it in the oven and get the same effect with less time.

My family really enjoys this recipe. It was easy to prepare and the choice of ingredients is very flexible. We will mix in whatever vegetables we have in the fridge and it always comes out great. It is excellent with beef, but we often use ground turkey instead.

This dish was good! My hubby and I put a dollop of sour cream on top and ate it up. Only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because I think it could've had more veggies in it... I'll probably add mushrooms and corn next time.

My family LOVES this, and I have some picky eaters.  I love that I can triple the recipe without any ill effects. The only thing I don't triple is the corn bread portion.  That I simply double (it won't fit in my slow cooker otherwise. I also add onions- cooked with the ground beef, cumin, oregano and chili powder. Otherwise a great reciipe that I make often.

We made this tamale pie a few months ago as the recipe is in our smaller slow cooker. It was great. I am doubling the recipe for a weekly Sunday dinner we have with friends and taking this for Mexican night. I am looking forward to sharing it with them.

was just okay, not bad, just not what I was expecting.  The cornbread layer was delicious, but the meat and beans were just so-so.  Thanks anyway!

Good but not great - definitely agree with other reviews that the corn bread was too much in comparison to the amount of meat.  Next time, I'll double the meat for sure!

My husband loved this dish, me not so much. It was good but not excellent. I did change some things.. added olives, can of petite basil tomatoes, corn, and I used lean turkey meat already seasoned taco flavor. I also added a lg can of encillada sauce instead of a small can.

Simple, yet hearty dish! WOW...I have never made anything like this in the oven or the slow cooker, and my husband and I were very impressed. I have to say I did not expect to the cornbread to expand like it did! I did use the mexican cornbread mix, and that made it even better!!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of using the slow cooker, I baked it in the oven for about 25 minutes. We loved this and I will be making it again. Thanks!

We weren't very thrilled with this recipe.  The casserole didn't taste like tamales and just wasn't that tasty.  Everyone likes different things, I guess. We won't make again.

Very good. I baked in oven at 350 for 30 min. Instead of using boxed corn bread, I used Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe from this site and just added cheese into it. For the meat mixture, I also added Hot Rotel, green pepper, onion, garlic.

MMMMMMM this was so good and easy. I made my own enchilada sauce, used heinz chili style mixed beans and added some chopped jalepenos. They were out of cornbread mix at the grocers so I used stovetop cornbread stuffing mix for the topper and it was a huge hit with everyone.

Good for a simple recipe and I love the fact that it could be made in the crockpot. The topping came very nicely for me... I will definitely make this again but adjust it more to my liking (spicer) per other suggestions. Thanks!

Family loved this dish. Only change I made was to double it.  Leftovers were great too.

I've made this twice since the first time, once for a potluck and have received nothing but rave reviews!

This turned out nicely, and I would make it again. I omitted the beans and added corn and black olives instead. I also sprinkled cheddar cheese over the top of the cornbread, which tasted really good once it was cooked. I did not use my crockpot, I simply baked the pie in the oven at about 380 degrees for 30 minutes. This is a really simple recipe that comes out tasting great, especially with some sour cream on top!

This was a huge disappointment.  The cornbread was dry and crumbly, the flavor of the "meat" portion ranged from tasteless to downright unappetizing.

This worked very well for me in the crockpot.  I doubled everthing and used Jiffy cornbread mix.  I added green chilles, black olives, and used ground turkey with red pepper.  It was very flavorful and spicy (just like I like it).  My husband and I ate leftovers for days.  I will definately make this on a monthly  basis.  Very easy

Maybe I should have tweaked it like everyone else on it's own this recipe is VERY BLAH! Next time I will throw a jar of salsa or add jalapeno cornbread topping. It definately needed something.

This just didn't taste good to me. I ended up throwing it out. It might have been that the cornbread was too sweet (I did double the cornbread amount as some people suggested). I can't eat jalapenos so perhaps the addition of those would have tempered the sweetness. Don't know but I won't be making this again.

This was wonderful! I did modify it by using mostly masa instead of the corn meal- it was so close to a real tamale. I'll definately make this again.

I thought with the corn bread topping it was actually too sweet to be a tamale flavor.  I put some crunhed up tortilla chips over the top and thought it made it less sweet and I enjoyed the extra crunch! A dollop of sour cream on the finished product helped add to the combination of flavors.  I like the ease of putting everything in one pot and leaving it in the slow cook and hours later you have a complete meal.

This recipe was delicious and so easy to make. I did make some alterations, used ground turkey, and sauteed an onion with it. Also added a green pepper and didn't use beans as i'm not a fan. I cooked it in the oven at 400F for 30 minutes and it was perfect. Tastes alot like chili, my husband and I both enjoyed it and to be honest I don't think i've ever had a tamale. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this idea since it is similar to a dish I make in the oven. I adjusted a bit also. I basically doubled the recipie but only used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and then substituted one can of black beans and one can of corn for the kidney beans. I also added black olives and was very liberal with the cheese and sprinkled some on top of the beef mixture as well as added it to the cornbread mixture. Only changes would be maybe a little less cornbread and maybe a little more enchilada sauce. Other than that it was wonderful and I will make it again.

was very easy to make. I added in corn and yellow peppers. Turned out very pretty! Was good. Family liked it. A little bland for me. Next time I will add more seasonings. Husband put salsa and sour cream with his.

Thought it tasted too much like a chili than a tamale.

Very easy to make and FILLING recipe! This is a cross between chili & tamales.  The cornbread turned out delicious!  4 or 5 bites of this and I was so full I could hardly breathe.  Definately will be making again.  The only thing I tweaked is that while cooking the ground beef I threw in some chopped onion & chopped green peppers.  I served with chili cheese fritos and/or tortilla chips. Yummy!  Also, is used lean (93/7) ground beef.

I am usually "all about the slow cooker" But, I was afraid the corn bread would be soggy.So I cooked it in the oven and it was really fast and good. Of course I hid carrots, broch, green and red bell pepper in the meat. Gotta get the veggies in where u can. My kids loved this! It's a keeper.

Good simple dinner.  I used bison instead of beef to make it a bit leaner.  Hubby and toddlers all ate it with no complaints.

I took the advice of other reviewer's and added onion to green pepper to the beef mix while browning.  After reading that it was dry, I added more enchilada sauce. I baked it in the oven for 40 minutes at 375 and it was very wet.  The liquid wasn't absorbed by the corn bread and it didn't cook down.  It tasted good, but I can't imagine it was if prepared as the recipe calls for.
