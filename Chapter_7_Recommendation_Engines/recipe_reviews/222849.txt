Wonderful! I had to sub an Anaheim Chili for the Poblano as that's all I could find. Followed the recipe to a "T" otherwise - A delicious accompaniment to our boiled shrimp & crab cakes!

When corn is in season this recipe is in regular rotation in my house.  It is an excellent salad.  As with most recipes you should add salt to taste.  With a recipe like this one you also need to adjust the heat level to taste as well.  You can always add more of the chipotle peppers in adobo but you are going to be hard pressed to subtract!  Go easy on the pepper at first and keep adding until you are where you are happy with the result.

Very tasty! I didn't have avocado, so didn't use but I do think it would be a nice addition.

Made this to go with BBQ ribs last night and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except that I forgot to add the avocado. It was all ready to be added and somehow was still on the counter at the end of dinner. I will definitely make this again, with the avocado. I think the avocado would have added a nice creaminess that would have added to the dish but I loved it all the same!

I first saw this salad in Sunset and loved it!  We have it several times a month during the summer.  It's also an excellent potluck dish.  I substituted slivered sweet onions (Walla Walla) for the hotter red onion.

I loved this salad, it was gorgeous using fresh corn. I did not have chipotle peppers & simply added a small amount of smoked paprika. (I grilled the poblano peppers right over the burner on my gas stove)

I made this but used blanched corn on the cob kernels (ears dropped in boiling water steeped for 5 minutes off the heat). And I used 2 of the chopped chipotle peppers for spice. This recipe is pretty simple, & a wonderful blend of flavors.

Made this salad for a pot luck event.  Even doubled, it did not seem like that much.  Also, the prep time was greater than indicated on the recipe.  I added more salt as others mentioned.  Prepared the recipe as written with a little more cilantro.  It was totally awesome and the bowl was empty!

I've now made this 4 times at least and still love it!  As much as I love avocados, I left them out the last time and I actually liked it better--the grilled flavor of the corn really came out this way.   I agree with one other reviewer that more corn/peppers are needed in order to arrive at 3 1/2 cups of salad.  I use 5 large ears of corn, 1 large and 1 smaller poblano (3 Annaheim peppers were used the first time when poblanos were not available at the store), and 2 avocados.  The mixture provides a lot of sophisticated taste.  I would recommend adding salt to the corn mixture, not just in the dressing.   Otherwise, the flavors don't come out as much.  I use chipotle powder as well.  I use lime juice from a bottle and 2 or 3 Tablespoons is just about right. The recipe is easily cut in half.  Give it a try for a vegetable/salad offering that's different than the same old lettuce & tomato deal.

Wow this is fantastic!!!  Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum! Such fresh and lively flavors, only thing I did different was used 1 lime and 1 small lemon because that is what I had and didn't want to run to the store and also used 2 chipotle's. I will make this again and again :-)
