Good recipe. Rather than corriander I used italian spices. The flavor was very appealing. Holding on to this recipe for the future.

I could not locate my old standby Pork and Sauerkraut recipe so I found this one instead. It was very close to Grandma's recipe. I like caraway seeds which is not in my normal recipe. The caraway seeds gave it a little extra something special. I had to make ours without tomatoes (allergies) but I am sure that would have tasted delicious.

I have made this several times and we all love it. I do add extra sauerkraut as we really like sauerkraut. My mother in law makes something very similar. This is an oldie and a goodie.
