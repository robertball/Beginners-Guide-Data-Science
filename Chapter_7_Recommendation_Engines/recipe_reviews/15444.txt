Really think you need to add butter and/or olive oil to the mushrooms to add some more flavor. This was good but just basic.

This recipe includes 3 of my favorite ingredients: chicken cheese and mushrooms. How can you go wrong. Simple yet wonderful. Thanks to you Lyn.

I knew before I started this recipe that I was going to have to jazz it up a bit for our tastes anyway. I knew it would need more seasoning so I made Traci s Adobo Seasoning also from this site and seasoned the chicken with that no additional salt and pepper. I also changed the cooking process quite a bit which I believe simplified everything. First I sautéed my seasoned chicken in a little EVOO on the stove top until completely cooked through but still moist (25-35 min. as indicated in the recipe under my broiler would have produced burnt shoe leather). I transferred the chicken to a baking sheet lined with foil sprayed lightly with non-stick cooking spray topped with the cheese and popped under the broiler for just about 30-40 seconds not too long or most of the cheese will melt off onto the foil. I kept the chicken warm while I sautéed the mushrooms in the same skillet I had used for the chicken until nicely browned. Then I couldn t help but add a splash of white wine to the mushrooms and let it cook off almost completely. When plating I topped the chicken with the mushrooms and served. I might also add that I never sauté mushrooms or anything for that matter covered sort or defeats the purpose by creating condensation that will hinder the browning. A decent recipe but nothing noteworthy. I do think the Traci s Adobo Seasoning and my addition of white wine improved this greatly from the original recipe.

Tasty and easy to prepare. The cooking times are definitely too long though. Keep an eye on your chicken and don't cook as long as suggested. Otherwise a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I loved how easy & quick it is to throw together. I used chicken breast tenders sprinkled with a little garlic salt. The mushrooms I cooked with a tablespoon of butter then added a clove of minced garlic. When they were tender I added parmesan cheese. Then once I added the mushrooms to the chicken I used colby jack cheese. Great taste for so few ingredients! I will be making this on my late work nights!

This was a big hit with my family (husband and kids). I sprinkled a little poultry seasoning on the chicken and cooked the mushrooms with some butter in the skillet. Everything else was the same (although the chicken did cook faster than the recipe said). Very good easy and quick - thanks!

Very easy and tasty chicken! I like a little more flavor so I marinated the chicken breasts in teriyaki sauce for two hours. The sweetness of the sauce really compliments the cheese and mushrooms.

I substituted a mustard sauce for the cheese because my cholesterol is high. So good! Moist and the mushrooms were perfect! I even garnished with parsley and it looked mighty fancy.

Easy and good. Only thing I did differently was to season my chicken before I put it in the oven. Will def make again.
