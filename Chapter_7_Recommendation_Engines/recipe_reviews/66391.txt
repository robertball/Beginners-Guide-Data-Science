These were very tasty - BUT use very thin bacon - the fish cooks before the bacon is done.  I did partially cook my bacon - maybe I should have cooked it a bit longer.  I did some in the oven broiler and some on the grill -  either way I ended up pulling them out before the bacon was really crisp - but the fish was done.  This is solid recipe - well worth making again.  Next time I would make sure to have really thin bacon and I would season the fish with some smoked paprika.  Thanks for a great summer recipe.

Halibut wasn't in season so I used jumbo shrimp instead. I grilled them on my panini press. Easy and delicious!

Other than the fact that anything wrapped in bacon is good, this was nothing special.

It was good and very easy to make. My halibut got a bit overcooked, but the recipe was good. I would try to make it again. I also basted them in teriyaki sauce and used the pre-cooked bacon sold at the grocery store.

I thought it was a little boring. Maybe needs some garlic or some other flavor.
