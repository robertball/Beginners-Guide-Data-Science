I just made this mayo and I couldn't believe my tastebuds! The taste and texture are just like the store bought version (similiar to Hellmann's). I am so happy to have found this recipe! The mayo found here in Germany is not like the real stuff back home. This is the closest I will ever get. I used what I had on hand, substituting prepared yellow mustard for the mustard powder (I kept the same quantity), and sunflower oil for the vegetable oil. This recipe was quick and easy to make with outstanding results. I had my parents taste test it with the following verdict: my dad and I really liked it and both agreed that it is just like the stuff you buy at the store, but my mom, on the other hand, thought that it had too much lemon. So I would recommend adjusting the lemon flavour to your own taste. Thanks, Jillena, for this wonderful recipe. :-)

I was thrilled to find this recipe! I wanted a healthier version of mayo, but don't care for the healthier store versions. In reading the other reviews, I was cautious about the lemon juice, so I added 1 tsp at a time. I actually liked the 2tsp. I used stevia(trying to cut out sugar) and canola oil. Next time, I plan to try olive oil. When I took it out of the blender(mine's not the best of blenders), the mayo was a bit lumpy. I stirred it a bit with a whisk and it turned out nice and smooth. Best of all, it tastes great:) Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!****Don't waste your time trying to make with olive oil...it'll turn out bitter...trust me!!

Great recipe!  I tried making this in my blender; however, the consistency was too clumpy (I have a high-capacity Kitchen Aid blender).  I started over and just used my electric hand mixer, and the consistency was exactly like store bought.   Thanks so much for sharing!

This did not work out for me- probably because my blender only knows one speed- liquefy.  Mine came out separated, not smooth like it should.

I have tried a couple other recipes, but this is pretty close to Hellman's, which is my favorite mayo. It was super easy and will be made again.

Great for baking or mixing into Egg Salad. I used extra virgin olive oil which gave it an oily tast. But was perfect and much more healthy then store brand for my egg salad.

I just made this and it worked great! I'm alergic to egg yokes and lemons, so I was looking for a recipe that did not require yokes. I substituted lime juice for the lemon juice and used Macadamia nut oil. The lime is not as strong as lemon, so maybe next time I will use a little bit more....but very happy with the results.   I made this in my Kitchen Aid food processor (which I have reviewed on Amazon.com" - it's a terrible food processor - don't buy it! But I was able to make it work by using a piece of scotch tape over the drip hole - I simple put a tiny hole in the scotch take and it worked beautifully, and effortlessly! Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I will never buy mayo from the store again (they're all full of soy anyway - another alergy item).

I recently became allergic to egg yolk due to "bird egg syndrome"-- totally weird thing.... anyway! I love mayo and cannot have uncooked egg yolk (not even scrambled egss!)--- I JUST made this. It took about 30 seconds and is absolutely delicious. Takes and looks just like mayonaise. I didn't even use mustard powder.   Pumped to put this on a sandwich!

Great recipe.  Made it in my Cuisinart food processor, and it was super fast and easy!  I had made homemade eggnog for my son, so I had 10 egg whites that I need to use up and was out of mayo.  This was the only mayo recipe I found that used only the egg white.  May try it with olive oil next time and see how we like that.  Well one egg white down, 9 to go!

I have just started a Paleo diet and making my own mayonnaise was a challenge.  This is a fantastic recipe and makes the best tasting mayo I've tried so far. If you are worried about the risk of salmonella because of the raw egg, you can substitute pasteurized egg substitute (like Egg Beaters) and it works exactly the same...without the fear of getting sick. :-)

Have been looking for a decent egg white mayo recipe.  Happy I finally found it.  One tip to avoid the mistake I made:  letting food processor run in between measuring 1/4 cups of oil.  Turned out thicker (whipped butter consistency).  It tasted fine but the honey mustard dressing I used it in was thicker than normal.

Tried this out a few minutes back and it turned out great. I just found that the white of one egg was insufficient hence added another one. A little garlic to give it the Zing of an aioli.

The only change I made was to drop the sugar and replace vegetable oil with olive oil.  The changes I made were to make it friendly for chronic kidney disease.

It was wonderful,  I think the mustard powder is the perfect ingredient in this recipe.

Really easy to make. I had leftover egg whites from a hollandaise sauce, so decided to try this. If you like light mayonnaise, you will love this. If you're accustomed to regular mayo with a fuller flavor, this recipe won't fill the bill. We buy regular mayo. I made my husband a sandwich with the homemade mayo (without his knowledge) and he noticed the mayo had no flavor. Again, if you like light mayo, this is awesome and super easy to make!

Delicious! I used plain, regular mustard in stead of the powdered one, and less than a cup of oil (my cup spilled before I put it in the mixer ??). It still turned out great!

Because of food allergies (egg yolk and soy) I'll need to make my own mayonnaise. I did not use vegetable oil (because it's soy based) and despite the warnings of other reviewers, I used olive oil because I forgot to grab an alternative at the store. It's pretty strong. Plus, my blender didn't  work well with it so I switched to my food processor half way, which wasn't that much better. It was overbeaten and pretty stiff. Next time I'll use a hand mixer and different oil. Even so, it was fantastic mayonnaise. I'll make it again. I can 't believe how easy it is. Edit: With safflower oil and a hand mixer it turned out great!

Very good.  I add 1 T of sugar or honey and 2 T of white wine vinegar to make it taste more like miracle whip.

I tried the recipe today; my first batch did not emulsify, so I started over in my Kitchen Aid Mixer with the whisk attachment.  It came together like mayo in the store, but is has a funny after taste from the vegetable oil.  I put it in the fridge to get cold; maybe that will help the flavor.  It not, I will try it again with Canola Oil.  I also used the whole egg, but I can see that making a difference in the taste.
