Very good...I'm in Switzerland and they don't have chocolate chips (can you imagine?...Nestle is only about 40 miles away and they don't have chocolate chips!) so I used a Frigor Dark Chocolate candy bar and chopped it up into tiny pieces.  I thought it was just chocolate, but it turns out it also has a creamy hazlenut ingredient.  Anyway, the raw dough tasted EXACTLY like Ben & Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  I baked the cookies too long (a common problem of mine) so they were a little crisp once cooled, but my husband loved them and we think they'll go great with ice cream.  Will definitely be making again.  Oh - this doesn't make 3 dozen cookies....MAYBE makes 2 dozen...but more like 15 - 18 regular sized cookies.

They were a big hit among friends and family.  Actually, they go way too fast!  I might try making it in two different batches next time since they squished together during baking... check out the photo I submitted for the title.

Very easy chocolate chip cookie recipe.  My kids and husband love them.  It makes a very small amount, though, so I quadruple the recipe each time and keep some dough in the refrigerator for when I run out--which is very soon.

This recipe only makes 12-15 small cookies and is a little too too sweet. I would adjust and add less sugar.

Yum!! I actully changed the recipe a bit by making chocolate cookies. I was looking for a basic chocolate cookie recipe and found this one, deciding to try it even though it made chocolate chip cookies. Instead of using SOFTENED butter, I completely MELTED the butter in the microwave. When you mix the chocolate chips with MELTED butter, they melt, making the dough brown and chocolaty. When you bake the cookies, they will be chocolate instead of chocolate chip. That is my trick for making chocolate cookies! Thanks for the recipe, Barb!

Just to be different and to add a little more chocolate flavor, I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa to the flour mixture before adding to the sugar mixture.  If you do this, you might want to add just a little more sugar than the recipe calls for.

These cookies were good, a little softer and more cake-like than I am use to, but they settled a sweet tooth. I had to double the recipe to make enough cookies to last a few days for my husband and I. I also had to add a little extra flour to thicken it up so it didn't appear so much like pancake mix.

I always use this recipe for cookies. I modify it a bit though, to my own taste. I use 1/2 c of agave nectar, instead of sugar.  If I do use sugar, I use only white sugar, and add 1-2 tbsp of molasses, to make the cookies soft. My favorite cookie recipe for sure.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the cookies turned out flat and hard.  I wonder if they would have been moister if I would have used egg yolk minus the whites, and minus the baking soda.

Good but a little salty - I looked at "Best Chocolate Chip Cookie" and compared w/this one.  I ended up cutting salt in half & using only 1/4 tsp.  Also, I personally though it needed a little more flour, so I increased to 1 1/2 rather than 1 1/8 and liked the results a bit better.
I do like the method for this one - didn't care for the mixing of baking soda & water in the other recipe."
Thank you for the recipe!

My husband loved these, but I was disappointed that they didn't look like the ones in the picture.  Those look thick and chewy, whereas mine were thick and cakey in the middle, with thin crispy edges.  I think it could be because I reduced the sugar.  Next time I'll make sure to add the full amount of white sugar, as I believe that's what makes cookies chewy.  I think I'll also place mine closer together in the pan so that the edges don't flatten out so much.

Our favorite cookie recipe. We use M&M's instead of chocolate chips and get nothing but compliments on them.  They're great fresh, but are even better the next day.

These cookies were just okay. I make choclate chip cookies often and wanted to try a new recipe. I like chewy chocolate chip cookies and these were not. More cakey. I will stick to my Nestle toll house or Ghirardelli recipes.

Excellent cookies!!! Everyone in our household loved them! Next time I think we will make smaller cookies though, because they all melted together in the oven, and are so large.

Not so great--I really like chewy, not cakey cookies.  These were not really either...maybe I did something wrong, though.

These cookies are great! The recipe is very easy and never fails. The cookies come out soft and chewy and stay that way. The salt, was a bit much when I tasted the dough, so I added about a half teaspoon of sugar to keep the sweetness.

After reading a few reviews, I was skeptical to try this recipe.  But since I only had one egg in my fridge, and I was craving home baked chocolate chip cookies, I went ahead with this recipe.  I find them excellent.  It does make a rather small batch — about 15 cookies instead of 3 dozen.  But nevertheless, I thought they were very good.

Even a diehard liberal like myself can't find much to complain about with this recipe!  Like most chocolate chip cookie recipes, there's not much to set this apart from all the rest, but that's not to say these cookies weren't good eatin'. In fact, they were.

These cookies were the best. I liked that the recipe explained how long to beat. I think that made a big difference. These cookies came out wonderful!

Made per recipe.  Made 16 cookies.  Came out very flat.  Good though.  I would double the batch and roll into 1" balls.  Flatten these slightly.  Bake to golden brown , turning cookie sheet once 1/2 way through bake time. About 15 minutes.

I substituted the egg with, 2 tbl spn flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp oil mixed to a smooth paste. 
It worked pretty good and the cookies were delicious!

These were super yummy, but definitely does not make 3 dozen. I have about 14 cookies. Definitely making this again, but will double the recipe! Thanks!

I've eaten my share of CC cookies and this recipe majorly disappointed me. It makes 12-15 maximum not 3 dozen. For a variation, I added 1/4 cup coco powder - the raw dough was amazing but the baked cookie was pretty bad. I would make this recipe plus coco powder and just eat the dough. I know I know its not good for you but it hasn't killed me yet :)

I just finished making these;I needed Chocolate Chip cookies, and I needed them fast! They were so easy, and turned out really nice. Doesn't make 3 dozen, but it was the right amount for what I needed. The taste is nothing too exciting, but good. Will probably make again.
