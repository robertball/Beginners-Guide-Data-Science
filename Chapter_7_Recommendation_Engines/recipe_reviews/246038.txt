Unfortunately, no one cared for these muffins.  I was a little hesitant trying them because there was no leavening agent.  They were moist and dense as I expected.  A added a few chopped pecans on the top  to enhance the appearance.

Great muffin recipe.  I used coconut chips instead of shredded coconut.  Easy to make and very filling.

Delicious. I loosely chopped some pecan nuts and added them to the mixture for a bit of crunch.
