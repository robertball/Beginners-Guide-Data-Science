Delicious! These were cooked perfectly. I used 6 bl/sl thighs, but kept the sauce ingredients the same. After the thighs were cooked, I took them out of the slow cooker and stirred in a little cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce, which worked out great. Served over Jasmine rice and with a side of 'garlic broccoli' also from this site. The family cleaned their plates, so that makes this a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very easy and tasty.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I was short on time so I set my crock pot on high and it was done in 2 and a half hours.  Just for personal taste I added pineapple chunks, bell pepper and onion during the last 30 minutes.

My whole family Loved this recipe, even my ultra-picky little boy! It was super easy, was made with ingredients I always have on hand, and it tasted GREAT with no adjustments necessary to the recipe! I used 8 chicken thighs & also 9 chicken tenders so I could free up space in the freezer and there was still Plenty of sauce! I put the chicken in a dish when it was done, strained the sauce into a saucepan, skimmed off the fat with a ladle & heated the strained  sauce with some cornstarch to thicken, and then poured the sauce over the chicken. I served it with brown rice & asparagus--Yum!!! Thank you for the great recipe! It will definitely be a keeper in our house!

I've made this exactly as written ( I do use low sodium soy sauce even though the recipe doesn't specify), and for such minimal ingredients and effort, it is surprisingly very good as is.  Serve over rice or noodles with a veg. or salad on the side and it is a flavorful and very easy meal.  If you have a couple more minutes to spare on prep, and a few more ingredients in your pantry - I find this makes it even better- but just as easy:  Prepare as directed (I find you can use up to 6 thighs and still have plenty of sauce, and I use skinless thighs that still have the bone.) Add one - or more - or all- of the following to the sauce before pouring over chicken:  1 small onion chopped, 1 tsp. ground ginger, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  When done, if you happen to have any, add some fresh chopped green onion or scallions or parsley on top just before serving.  Some sesame seeds would also be a nice garnish.  But,,,,again, for such a simple recipe it is perfectly acceptable as is.

My husband loved this chicken! So did I. Nice delicious thick sticky glaze on the moist chicken. I served it with rice pilaf with broccoli bits & slivered carrots & sliced almonds, & green salads as side dishes. Because of Asian type flavor, the only additions I made to this already perfect recipe were I drizzled a scant teaspoon of sesame oil over top and sprinkled about a half tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds over the top too about the last hour in the slow cooker & the seeds made it look really pretty & appealing & added a slight nice crunch.
Thanks for the easy & delicious dinner idea & recipe!

Easy to make and uses pantry staples. Always a very good thing! I doubled the chicken thighs (but not the rest of the ingredients) and put half in the freezer for a quick meal when I need it.

I used what I had on hand which was bone-in chicken thighs, and I doubled the garlic because I love garlic.  The result was something the entire family, including 3 year old, loved!  The chicken was so tender and delicious.  Will be making again.

Love this recipe! I've made honey garlic pork chops and they were great so I figured I'd try chicken. I used 8 boneless skinless thighs and used about 5 cloves of garlic and low sodium soy sauce with a splase of rice vinegar and it is fantastic! My hubby doesn't really care for "asian" type food and my 2 year old doesn't like meat at all really and they both LOVED this. Hubby said I should of doubled the recipe because he loved it so much lol. Definitely keeping this recipe on hand!

Well i followed recipe, and all the comments advice. I used 9 thighs with skin and bone bc that what was in my freezer. I did honey soy sauce and ketchup. I put the garlic but used minced bc i didnt have fresh. I also added 1/2 cup sweet baby rays bbq and 1/4 cup brown sugar. And i also added red pepper flakes. (Thanks to suggestions of others)Cooked as recipe states...maybe a lil less time wasnt exactly timing it. Prob 4.5hrs. I then took thighs placed in baking pan. And the remaining liquid in pan i put in saucepan with cornstarch to thicken it up. I poured a lil over each thigh. Baked 15 or 20min on 400 degrees. It looked exactly like the picture. It was not too salty. The meat fell off bone. Served over white rice with seasoned and roasted brussel sprouts which i all cooked same time as the chicken in oven. So everything was done at same time. And it was very good. Its not like an award-winning chicken dish but it was packed with flavor, relatively healthy, super easy to make, other than slow cooker time it was quick to make. I will def make again. My boyfriend rates the chicken an 8 out of 10. So for a quick wed night meal ill take it and def make again!

I made this yesterday before I went to work.  I used 10 bone-in chicken thighs and still used the same amount of sauce, and there was still plenty.  I used coconut aminos instead of soy sauce (due to the sodium levels and because I'm overly anal with nutrition).  My husband went on for about 10 minutes how much he loved it... telling me that he can eat it everyday because it reminded him of fall-off-the-bone ribs.  Super easy and delicious!

I didn't have thighs so i used boneless skinless breasts and i didn't have basil either, but it still turned out terrific! I can't wait to try this on pork tenderloin as another reviewer suggested!

Fist I want to thank everybody for for writing reviews. Very helpful! I bought a tray of chicken thighs and wasn't sure how many to put in the crock pot (I have a large crock pot). I made the sauce and it was A LOT OF SAUCE! So I put all of the thighs I had, 12 total small thighs with bones and skin on. I like to cook with skin on because I feel that chicken is more juicy this way. I also made some changes to the sauce. I used low sodium soy sauce and substituted ketchup with BBQ sauce. A lot of people commented that ketchup flavor was too strong. I used 5 large garlic cloves and 1/3 cup of honey and 1 ts of dried basil. I cooked on low for 4-4.5 hours. My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was awesome!! Perfect for me because I am definitely a beginner at cooking. I used 4 bone-in thighs, 1/4 soy sauce to avoid being too salty, and 1/4 ketchup, and 1/4 sweet baby rays bbq sauce; 1/4 brown sugar, no basil, everything else the same. I topped it on a bed of rice with some sautéed kale & spinach with lemon juice and minced garlic. Delicious!

Good starter, but needs a little "oomph". Sauce was okay, but thin, so I thickened it on the stove with cornstarch before pouring it over the chicken. I used 8 thighs instead of 4, but kept the sauce ratio the same. Thighs were tender and juicy. Second time I made it, I mixed into the sauce 1 1/2 tsp. cornstarch, 1 tsp. ground ginger, and about 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper. The sauce was better, and thickened nicely in the slow-cooker. Might try crushed red peppers in it next time.

The crock pot surely has to be the work horse and best friend of those who work outside the home or are time constrained.  Nice recipe but too salty for our taste and the cooking time was too long for only four chicken thighs.  I will try this again with the low sodium soy sauce which should alleviate the problem and a shorter cooking time. Served with fried broccoli and onion rice,  both from AR.  Provided a nice balance of flavors between sweet, spicy and savory.  Thank you Myrna for the submission.

This was really great! It was so easy to make, and I literally only had to purchase the chicken because I had everything else in the pantry. Sometimes I find that slow-cooker sauces with a lot of soy make the chicken overly salty, but that was not the case here. I served it with brown rice, and I threw some onions and carrots into the slow cooker for an additional side dish. I'd recommend doubling the recipe, or at least doubling the chicken amount--this went really fast, and I'd have loved some leftovers to eat for lunch. I will definitely make this again!

Mine was definitely cooked enough at 5 1/2 hours on low. Tasty sauce; I would call it a sweet and tangy barbecue than leans more "tomato-ey" than most, but the basil gives it more complexity than that.  Easy to put together. The sauce   I almost always have to double the sauce in most recipes, because I like a ton of extra for my rice, pasta, etc.  But this had plenty of sauce on its own!!  Although it didn't REALLY need it, the sauce was even better when I took the advice of other reviewers about adding the slurry of cornstarch.  (I'm sure many know this trick.  But for those who don't, to avoid the cornstarch just curdling up in the warm sauce, you put about 1 tablespoons of corn starch in approximately 1/2 cup of water and whisk well.  Then adding a small amount at a time of the hot sauce to the cold mixture.  When mixture is more warm than cold, you then add it into the sauce.  You could increase the thickening effect even more by moving the sauce to a pan and bringing it to a boil.)  I used low-sodium soy-sauce.  It was great over brown rice.

I had 8 bone in thighs, took the skin off and even reduced the amount of soy/ketchup and honey to 1/4 each, I really didn't measure but certainly didn't need the amount of sauce called for, It just covered the thighs. Sprinkled the chicken with ground pepper, onion powder, paprika, dried basil, oregano and parsley. 
Cooked on low for 6.5 hours. It was perfect tender tasty chicken.

I tried this recipe today. Long before it was supposed to be done it was overcooked.  I used the exact mesurments and instead of making a glaze it made a soup.

Great flavor and so easy to fix- tasted like a dish you'd get from a restaurant! The only change I'd make is cooking it 5 hours - it was a little dry after 6 hours.

Good recipe and why all the fuss over being to salty?? Any one of the ingredients can be adjusted to personal taste....And you can do that BEFORE marrying the sauce with the chicken thighs? I plan trying this with butterfly pork chops. Cut back on the soy (add more the same way you can make screwdrivers stronger with more Vodka).... Half of cooking is with your nose and 'test' tasting.... maybe a little cumin and paprika....Vidalia onions??? Hmmm...and lots more garlic than BeccaLynn suggested.... I  eat garlic raw ;-}

I am sorry to be such a naysayer but I did not care for this recipe. My son and I like maple pork chops and the sweet/salty juxtaposed but I found this to be unappetizing at best. The ingredients together (for me) were not a good mix.

Not a fan, maybe my slow cooker heats too hot on low because the thighs were over cooked at 5 hrs.

This is so easy and tasty.  Of course I had to add my own touch which was 1/2 cup finely chopped onion and at the end I removed the chicken and thickened the sauce with corn starch.  Served over rice with steamed green beans. Husband is a fan.

I used legs since that's what I had available. Based on other reviews, I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup and cooked for 4.5 hrs instead of 6. Once done, removed chicken from crockpot and placed in casserole dish. Used cornstarch to thicken sauce, poured over chicken, and then broiled in oven until desired crispness.

I had to come back to this website to make sure I didn't make any mistakes! It was salty as all get out. It looked nothing like the picture. The only thing I did different was to use double the amount of chicken.

Just OK. First...I'm guessing the poster of this recipe used frozen chicken, because it does not need to cook for 6 hours. My unfrozen chicken was not only done, but over cooked at 3 1/2 hours. This recipe is not for the sophisticated palate. The ketchup flavor is VERY strong. I can see someone who puts ketchup on everything liking this. This is not a recipe I'd make again.

Followed the recipe, and found it way too salty (and I like salt). Before adding the sauce to the crock pot, I added brown sugar to the sauce to tone it down a little bit. The chicken came out tough, especially for thighs, and the sauce was still too salty. Not sure where it went wrong.

I am surprised this recipe got such good reviews. I followed it to the letter except added a little extra garlic. It was edible, but no one liked it. As another reviewer said, it was sooo salty. I had to pile on the plain rice to dilute the saltiness down enough that it wasn't so unpleasant.

This turned out just beautiful! So moist and tasty. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that I wanted to point out that it doesn't need to cook for the stated 6 hours. After 5 hours, I started to get just a whiff of burning, so I checked it and realized it was perfectly well done. I turned it off then and it was great. But had it gone for the 6 hours I'm sure it would have been burnt. I hate to use this rating to say this, but I really wish that cooks would rate the recipe AS IT IS, instead of as they adjusted it. Some cooks give a 5-star rating, but then go on to say the recipe as written was really bad. However with their adjustments it became a 5-star recipe. That confuses people who are looking for a recipe that is top-notch. OK, end of my ranting.

At first when I went by the recipe, I wasn't really happy with the taste of the sauce, so went back and read some of the reviews on the dish and came up with my additions to make it to my liking.  I added some brown sugar which was suggested and that happened to help with the taste.  I used 6 chicken thighs and cooked them 4 hours.  In the last hour, I added sliced onion, green and red peppers and it ended up becoming a delicious recipe.  I did increase the sauce by a 1/3 and had way more sauce than I needed which I will use amounts recommended next time.  I served it over brown rice.  So this is my take on this dish.

As a college student during summer, I don't have a lot of time to prepare fancy meals every night. This recipe was an excellent opportunity to rid the freezer of some chicken thighs as well. 

Several alterations however; I used a 1/2 cup of red wine leftover from a previous dish (it makes everything better), and instead substituted a small packet of soy sauce and added a half an onion. Before starting the crock pot, I put a small line of honey along the top of each thigh. Afterwards, a small flour roux made an unforgettable sauce that makes this dish blossom with flavor and kept it from being too dry. The only change I would make is to up the garlic to 5 good size cloves, as three didn't get me that divine subdermal layer that I crave.

Overall a darn good recipe to add to your arsenal, though I think each chef will want to play around to give it a personal touch.

I followed the recipe exactly. The resulting chicken looked fairly unappetizing compared to the pictures on here, but looks aren't the end of the world.

The tops of the chicken that were not submerged in the sauce got overcooked, dry, and tough. I cut those parts out, but the rest of the chicken tasted bitter. Girlfriend ate one forkful and wouldn't eat any more. I ate about half the thighs, but only in an effort to not waste food. I eventually gave up and tossed the rest.

I don't understand how so many people could consider this a 4 or 5 star recipe, even with some of the modifications they made. I wonder if I made a colossal mistake somewhere, but it's such a simple recipe that I don't know how I could have done that.

Fantastic meal, it worked out great..For anyone avoiding soy, there is an alternative for soy sauce that works fantastic, it is gluten free and soy free, it is called Coconut aminos, and no you can't taste the coconut, I have used it quite often, and is the best alternative to soy sauce, less sodium and no soy :-)
I did cut back on the amount of soy (coconut amino's, I think it would have been too salty otherwise..I used 1/4 cup not a half cup)

I also sprinkled a little sesame seed on top just to finish it off, and served with rice and carrots on the side...

I used low sodium soy sauce to cut the salt content. It makes a lot of sauce so next time I make it I will par all the ingredients back by 1/4. Otherwise, it was a great sauce to use with all sorts of meats and rice dishes.

I'm not a fan of chicken thighs or honey garlic sauce but this recipe looked so easy I decided to make this one for those in the house that do.  To my amazement - even I loved this!  It doesn't get much easier than this recipe (I made it as written except for adding extra garlic and about a teaspoon of chilis in oil to the sauce mix.  I hesitated on the basil, didn't seem to fit with the other flavours, but decided I should try it at least once and I'm glad I did).  I was impressed that the chicken actually comes out looking just like the recipe picture (I usually find crock pot meals aren't very aesthetically pleasing).  I served it with steamed broccoli in garlic butter and basmati rice.  We used the sauce on our rice (I noticed many reviewers thickened the sauce but I didn't bother and we were all happy with it exactly as it came out of the crock pot).  This will definitely be going into my regular rotation.  Using ingredients that are always on hand, it turns low cost thighs into an excellent meal that I can have completely ready in under 20 minutes in the kitchen.

It says honey garlic, but all you could taste was the salty soy and tomatoes/ketchup.  Also burnt char because the sauce stuck and burned to the edge of the crock pot.  And we ate after four hours on low.

Awesome! Cooked for 3 hours on high then last 2 hours on low. Probably only needed to cook for 2 hours on high. Added 2 TBS of cornstarch to water and then to the chicken to thicken. Next time, try adding green pepper, onion and pineapple during the last hour. Served with wild rice, roasted asparagus and Strawberry/Mango Mesclun Salad. Fabulous meal.

My husband and I really liked this recipe! The chicken was tender and delicious. I took others advice, I used 8-10 boneless thighs but did not double the sauce, it was enough. I was running out of time and cooked it three hours on high. My picky kids thought it was just OK, but they did eat it.

As per some other comments about the dish being salty, I put about 1/3c of low sodium soy sauce and a 1/2c honey.  I only cooked it with 3 thighs but will add a few more because they were so delicious! It was wonderful over Thai peanut noodles(left over take out) and steamed broccoli. Yum!

We liked this very much.  I especially liked the simplicity of this recipe.  But my chicken was half frozen, bone-in thighs and my time limited for slow cooking.   I  did it anyway.  Took about 15 minutes to have it in the slow cooker and that included the partial thawing time for the chicken in the microwave.  Using my high setting on the slow cooker, the dish was done in 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Chicken was tender and had great flavor.  I think I only made a couple of changes/additions:  using low sodium soy sauce and adding a half tsp. of crushed red pepper.  (I might add more red pepper next time as it wasn't at all spicy.)   I  served it with Basmati rice and a bag of vegetables steamed in the microwave.   Our granddaughter and her friend were very complimentary and my husband said the recipe is definitely a keeper.   So I will be making it again. Thanks for such a simple recipe.  UPDATE:  Made this again tonight but used country style pork ribs instead of chicken.  I did thaw the ribs, added 1 tsp. crushed red pepper and slow cooked on low for 6 hours.  The meat was tender without falling apart.  Served with last night's Basmati rice and glazed carrots.  My husband said he liked this sauce with the pork better and it was a totally different flavor.  So simple and versatile, truly a keeper.

This was super good! We dont like basil so left that out. And I used chicken legs since thats all I had. Put in crock pot for 5 hours exactly but put it together and let it sit in the fridge all morning first :) 
Only thing I did differently is the same as other reviewers and after the 5 hours of cooking I took the legs out, put on foil lined pan (about an inch deep), then I took the sauce out and put in pan and thickened with cornstach. I took a brush and basted the legs with the glaze and put in oven for a few minutes. then pulled out, basted again with the brush and put on broil for 2 minutes to get it nice and sticky and a bit 'crunchy' skin.
This was so good my husband said it was some of the best chicken he'd ever had. Served over white rice using the sauce spooned over it of course, with green beans. The ONLY reason this didnt get 5 stars from me is because im 7 months pregnant, it didnt fill me up for long, woke up starving the next morning, its most deff. a 'healthy low fat' dinner :) the chicken just falls off!

I followed this recipe word for word and found it very disappointing. The chicken was overcooked and the sauce justed taste like sweet catsup and soy sauce.

Cooked this tonight using low-sodium soy sauce and it came out great.  I think if we'd used regular soy sauce, it would have been too salty, so very glad we used this. The chicken wasn't thawing fast enough, so it was still partly frozen when I put the thighs in the crock pot.  Cooked on low for 3 hours and it was fine - meat was proper internal temp and was falling apart with a fork.  Then again, things always seem to cook fast in ours, which is a large crock pot brand "smart pot" with a heavy removable ceramic dish - 6 quarts i think.  

Some say the glaze was thick and sticky but ours was the consistency of water.  But that was fine - we just ladled some over the white rice we served the chicken on, and everything was great.  will definitely be using this recipe again!

I always use low sodium kikkoman soy sauce so I can control how much salt I want in a dish and it was a great way to go in this as well! Put frozen boneless skinless chicken thighs in with the sauce ingredients and it was perfect when I got home 6 hours later! was generous with the garlic and stingy with the salt and loved the final project! Some jasmine rice and steamed broccoli all drizzled with sauce that I thickened a little with cornstarch on the stove top made the meal. a winner for sure! thanks for sharing!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I did add 1/4 cup brown sugar to the recipe to round out the flavor a little. I also used bone in chicken thighs and this recipe still came out wonderful. I also love the fact that i had everything already at home. the less shopping i have to do the better.

The key to any recipe is to make it your own! After reading the reviews I used a little less soy sauce added onions and green pepper. Thickened the sauce and added pineapple chunks. Very good. It's on rotation when I do cook.

This was delicious!  My whole family loved it. I used a large family pack of boneless skinless chicken thighs, about 10 in all, and kept the other ingredients in the listed amounts.  I used Italian herb blend  instead of basil alone and low sodium soy sauce.  I cooked it on high for three hours in the crock pot and it came out perfect. There  was plenty of  liquid to spoon over the chicken so I served it over  jasmine rice and steamed brocolli in a bowl. So good and so easy!  I will keep this one in rotation. Thanks for sharing!

SO GOOD! I am a college student who is often rushing from one place to another, so crock-pot recipes are ideal for me. I recently made this for me and 3 other people. The only thing I changed is that I used 6 boneless chicken thighs instead of 4.  (I still made the same amount of sauce). All of my roommates LOVED this recipe. I also made white rice as a side. Delicious!

I didn't have basil and I used 8 chicken thighs and 5 cloves of garlic instead. I also ended up just cooking it for 5 hours instead of the 6. I think 6 would have been too long for my slow cooker and thighs because they were already a bit on the dry side. I would try 4.5 hours next time. 

Another thing is that it does taste borderline too salty. The flavours were strong in general, but I did find myself needing to mix the chicken and sauce with plain rice to make it more palatable. I think I would go with less soy sauce next time, maybe 1/3 of a cup. 

The sauce was the consistency of water. Next time, I would make less of it and add some corn starch to thicken it up. 

All in all, it was pretty easy, I think it's just a matter of tweaking it to my taste. I would make this again with adjustments.

This was okay. I think from now on when I see ketchup in a recipe I will steer clear unless it is for sloppy joes. This was very salty and just not that good.

Delicious, I substituted teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. Also added a little orange zest and fresh squeezed orange.. Recipe was awesome.

We did half recipe with 2 chicken breasts, only change was to use just one clove garlic. Slow cooked on low for 4 hrs. It sat in the unplugged cooker for about 20 min by the time we got the other dishes together. A little dry for my liking, no fault of the recipe as it could of cooked for less time. The missus liked it and that's all that matters.

It was very good! I'm a new crock pot user so I'm sure there's room for improvement however the next time I make it I think I'll switch the pieces around while cooking. The bottom pieces were more heavily saturated with the soy sauce and the top pieces weren't as flavorful. The sauce was perfect, I just need to tinker on the thickness component. My kids voted 5 stars so that's what matters!

I put eight thighs in the slow cooker before going to work, it literally took 10 minutes tops. When I got home five were gone. My two very picky eatting boys cleaned their plates and one went back for more. I barely got one thigh.....great recipe

this did not turn out for me at all.  My family did not care for it, nor did I.  I plan to try one more time in the future, but for now I have to give it a 1*.  I'll change my review if the next attempt comes out better.

Pretty good though mine did not look anything like the picture. I followed the recipe for the marinade except I reduced the soy which was good.  Added chopped onion, green pepper & pineapple in the last hour which was an excellent addition. Had to do what other reviewers said & add cornstarch to the sauce.

This was excellent, and so easy!  I used 8 boneless skinless thighs and there was still plenty of sauce.  I cooked it on Low for 3.5 hours and the chicken thighs were tender and falling apart.  We used the sauce as it was (without thickening it on the stovetop like others suggested) and it was great.  I served it with Quinoa (cooked in chicken broth) and Kale.  Everyone cleaned their plates!

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly, but I did use about  8-9 chicken thighs (this makes a lot of sauce). My chicken wasn't salty at all and had a nice slightly sweet flavor.. Best of all, this is so easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have a lot of mouths to feed. I use 12 chicken thighs, (with skin and bone in, they hold up better) 1 cup honey, 1 cup soy sauce, and 1 cup  ketchup. I also use a lot more garlic. And double the basil. It's the #1 choice in this house!  Love it!!

Easy to put together.  The house smelled great while it was cooking and everyone couldn't wait until dinner.  My husband who is not a fan of chicken thighs commented on the savory flavor.  This is a keeper.

This smelled so good when I walked into my house after work. The chicken was beautifully glazed and fell apart with a fork. It was a bit too salty though. I will make this again but I'll use low-sodium soy sauce and more fresh garlic.

The entire family loved it. I used 8 chicken thighs with skin. I made a few changes because my family prefers a more crispy skin so I browned the chicken in butter in a skillet first. To spice up the sauce a bit, I added 1/4 cup of sweet red chili. When the dish was finished cooking in the crockpot, I removed the chicken and placed in the broiler for 5-10 minutes to crisp the skin again. While the chicken was in the broiler, I thickened the sauce by returning it to the heat and adding corn starch.  It came out delicious. Three generations gave 2 thumbs up in the household, which is very hard to do.

Note to the critical reviews: As with most recipes, you have to thicken the sauce with cornstarch in order to get the full flavor.

I thought this was really tasty! I used chicken breasts because that was all I had on hand. I  also didn't have time to use my slow cooker so I turned in the oven to 400°, halved 3 large chicken breasts, sprayed my baking dish lightly with cooking spray, laid the chicken breasts evenly on the baking dish,   covered with foil and baked it for 40 minutes. I let the chicken rest for 10 minutes covered and it was very tender! I did what other reviewers suggested and lightly thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I served the chicken and sauce on brown rice with steamed broccoli on the side and it was yummy. I just wish I made a double batch of sauce, it tastes kind of like a teriyaki sauce and tasted awesome on rice. My family ate it all up and was scraping the dish for more sauce

YUM!!!  I made this today for my husband and 2 kids.  It was a hit.  I was told by BOTH kids that it was a keeper!  The only difference was I used chicken breasts instead of thighs - that's what I had.  Dee-Lish!  I shredded the chicken and served it  over white rice with a side of garlic green beans.   While it did make a lot of sauce - I didn't mind it.  Next time I'll just add a bit more chicken.   Will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is easily one of the best slow cooker meals I have ever made, and the fact that is super simple makes it even better! The chicken was super tender and the flavor is perfection.  I made it last night and today my husband asked if I would mind making it again tonight,  which has never happened before! Of course I don't mind because it is so simple and delicious! Thank you for such a great recipe that will become a staple in my house!

Such an easy recipe.  I used the same amount of ingredients for 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they were small.  I also added onion and green pepper.  Threw everything into the slow cooker at 11am and by 5pm it was ready to go.  The house smelled delicious all day.  Chicken practically fell apart - SO good!  I served it with rice.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

delicious!! I doubled the chicken and added diced onions to the soy sauce mix.  I also used more garlic, but I kept the sauce ingredients the same.  I also added red potatoes and carrots to the chicken, and cooked the whole thing for 7 hours on low.. wow!!!

I tripled the amount of chicken and sauce, and ended up with way too much sauce.  Next time, I would use double the amount of sauce, and even that might be too much.  I had hoped for a rich flavorful sauce, but like some other reviewers, I was unimpressed with the flavor of the finished sauce, which was lacking something and was thin.   I took the advice of another reviewer and added some other ingredients to the sauce, namely peanut butter, brown sugar, a little ground ginger and a little bit of hot pepper flakes.  I also added a tablespoon of cornstarch in a slurry to thicken the sauce.  With those adjustments, the sauce was quite good.  However, as written, I would not have liked this recipe at all.  I don't understand all the rave reviews.

I didn't care for this at all. The flavors were strange and did not go well together. After I tasted the finished recipe, I added some peanut butter, sesame oil and brown sugar to make it into a completely different dish which was actually quite good. I would not have been able to eat it as it was originally made.

Made it exactly to the recipe except I used bone in chicken thighs. Time was still right on. Easily the juiciest most flavorful chicken I've had. Great recipe. Made up some pork fried rice to put it on and I'll definitely be making it again.

I used low sodium soy sauce and I loved the flavor.  Had to make a double batch cause I used breasts instead of thighs but the taste  was still very good.  my only complaint is that the sauce did come out very thin but I just whipped up some quick rice and served it over that to soak up the juice.  Next time I might try what some have suggested  and simmer down the sauce after the chicken is cooked.  If I do I will update with my results.

Made this today with bone in chicken thighs-Was done in 5 hours chicken skin was limp and flabby even though I browned the chicken before putting in the crockpot-Sauce was bitter from the garlic-Saved the meal by putting the chicken to brown in the oven and strained the sauce and added brown sugar and boiled to thicken the bbq sauce-Will not make this recipe again-Very sad because I had high hopes-I don't see how anyone could make the glazed topping without resorting to some corn starch

Really, really good. Used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and doubled the ingredients, placed in crockpot on low for about 6 hours and it came out fall-off-the-bone tender and tons of flavor. Instant house favorite!

Excellent. Made just the way it is, with about 15 thighs in 2 slow cookers. Made the dressing for each cooker. Was simple and yummy and tender and everybody loved it. Leftovers were excellent. thank you!

I made this exactly the way it says to, except I used bone in thighs and it was absolutely delicious! I used the extra juicy sauce over white rice and that was also delicious! Will definitely be making this one again and again!

Very good! I used thigh meat but next time I'll use chicken breasts. I did add ground ginger and used low sodium soy sauce and part braggs. I mixed the sauce up in a small bowl and poured what I thought was just enough over the meat in the crock pot. I ended up using the rest of the sauce to stir fry up some veggies.

This recipe was pretty good! I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a little heat. I also put them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up! Husband and 4 year old gobbled it up!

Delicious and easy! Took the chicken out at the end and broiled it for 5 minutes to get it crispy (thanks to other reviewers recommendations) and added some corn starch to the sauce to thicken it.  Very good!

I tried this last night and it was pretty tasty. My slow cooker only offers HIGH 4 or 6 hours.. LOW 8 or 10. I put it on low for 8 hours. I honestly thought the sauce was supposed to thicken like a glaze. Maybe it is because of the extra two hours. Also, the chicken seemed a little dry inside. My fiance loved it but i guess i expected to be wowed! I did use boneless breast. Maybe this is why hahaha. anyways, it was good though. I just wasn't completely blown away. I wanted a nice thick glaze on it :(

Made nearly exactly as written. My wife doesn't like chicken thighs, so I used breasts instead.  Turned out perfectly.  About 4 hours into the cooking time, i shredded the meat and stirred it around.  I only cooked it for about 5 hours.  Was a little salty for our tastes.  Spread the meat and juice over a bed of rice, offset the saltiness nicely.  Will make this again.

My husband can't cook. Like, AT ALL. But I forgot to start this before I left for work so I called him and told him how to do it over the phone. Took about 5ish minutes and was super easy... and it is totally one of our FAVORITE dishes. OMG it was so good! I left the recipe as is for the most part. I used bone-in chicken thighs and added some green onions when serving over a bed of jasmine rice. Otherwise, honey and soy sauce, etc were all kept the same. Next time we will add just a touch of crushed red pepper to give it a little zing, otherwise won't change anything. I didn't need to add anything to thicken the sauce since it was going over rice. 
Thanks so much for the recipe, it was amazing!!

Really simple to make. Very flavorful and moist. The chicken fell right off the bone. Next time I will add a little chile paste for a slight spicy kick. Family really enjoyed it. Will make again.

These flavors do not merry well with chicken. The sause is overpowering. The ingredients would woork better as a beef marinade. The beef could then be seared and slow cooked with potato and carrot.

By far, one of the most amazing ways to cook chicken. I took advice from one other person who reviewed this recipe and added pineapples. I served this dish with cilantro and olive oil complemented jasmine rice. I will cook this very often. Also, fairly affordable.

Wow, this was great. I didnt change a thing with the recipe (I always try to do them all original the first go round) and it was delicious. Well, I did have to cook on high for 3.5 hours because of a time crunch, which I think is why the sauce is really thin, but it was fine anyways. 5 stars, will definitely make again, maybe with a touch more honey cooked a bit slower.

I made it as per the recipe. I didn't find the recipe too salty as others have said. Used 6 bone in thighs for the chicken. Cooked it on low for 5 hours and the meat just flaked off the bone. Served it over white rice and brocoli. Makes plenty of sauce. Didn't use corn starch to thicken before pouring sauce over rice as other have said. My wife thought it was a 5 star meal but it was only a 4 star for me. It was good.

#1. I am not a cook.   I seem to only collect recipes, and every great once and awhile I venture into the world of food preparation.    It helps if the recipe states “quick and easy”.
I made this, and my spouse kept repeating how good it was and how “surprised” he was.    A little too often !?
I’ll be making this again.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs but kept everything else the same.
It was so tender and the flavor was amazing! Served over rice.

Excellent dish.  This is the second time I’ve made it with six thighs.  Like other reviewers, I halved the liquid ingredients and doubled up the garlic.  I also replaced the ketchup with Sweet Baby Ray’s barbecue sauce. I cooked them on high for 2.5 hours and they were perfect.  The liquid really thins out, so I when they were done I put it in a small saucepan with a couple tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it.  Served over brown rice and quinoa with a side of steamed vegetables.

This was an excellent meal. Cooked with skin and bone in chicken thighs. Husband is stuffed and asked where did you get that recipe from? I’m going to use left overs for tomorrow on a toasted bun wit Parmesan cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and hot peppers.

This was delicious!  I added chopped chipotle chili's while cooking and made shredded chicken tacos with it.  Yummy!

Very disappointing.  5 hours and 45 minutes on low in a standard slow cooker, and the chicken was dry and stringy. The meat ended up with a weird gamy taste, and otherwise the sauce was super watery/oily and almost flavorless. Was so excited to try this and recommend to everyone.

Made exactly as is but with 6 bone-in thighs, skin removed. Did not increase sauce. It was a bit more than needed for eating but was ‘just enough’ for cooking.  I did not thicken the sauce and it was perfect for drizzling over the rice. Also used low sodium soy sauce. Definitely a keeper. Oh and added just a pinch of red pepper flakes.

The soy sauce made the chicken too salty for me. The flavor was not what I was hoping for. My husband didn't care for it either.

I loved how easy this was. As other reviewers have said, this makes more than enough sauce. I made this with 8 thighs. At the end of 6 hours, they were falling apart tender. I may try to cut the cooking time down next time I make this.

Followed this as is, really great basic honey garlic sauce.  Easy ingredients that are in most pantries. I can see how some reviewers felt they needed to add more spice.  I didn't find it too salty. The kids gobbled it up.
Definitely thicken the sauce with some cornstarch.
I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I baked it at 375 for 1 hour, turning over half way.  turned out great.

Six hours on low was way too long.  The chicken was overcooked.  Liked the tasted of the sauce though so will try again and watch till it's done.  Also, I'll double the amount of chicken and there will still be plenty of sauce.

Just walked in to the house this afternoon excited to taste this and we can’t even eat this. Everyone walked in and started gagging with the smell alone. I followed the recipe exactly. I’m not sure how this has gotten so many good reviews. I currently have all windows opened trying to air the house out. I thought it might just be one of those recipes that tastes better than it smells but nope it tastes terrible too.

Mine were in the slow cooker on Low for 5 hours.  They were a little overdone and not as tender as I'd have liked.  I really didn't care for the combination of soy sauce, ketchup & honey.  I won't make these again.

I will defiantly make this again! The whole family enjoyed it and we cut it up and used it in a Mexican tortilla soup the next day, which added a lovely flavor.
We didn't have any chicken thighs on hand so I used chicken breasts instead. I cooked it on high for about 4 hours and served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. 
I enjoyed the chicken (which was super tinder) but the flavor was a bit odd.

Great recipe-so easy and delicious.  Chicken falls off the bone.  I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to one cup of liquid to thicken it up.  Cooks perfectly for 5 hours.  At the 4th hour I added thawed broccoli florets and water chestnuts.   Served with a side of rice.

We love this in my house! It's a favorite and a go-to for us! I slow cook in the oven since the two men in my house eat like starved animals, so I have to cook up about 12 thighs to last for lunches the next day. I add extra garlic. For those who are soy/gluten free, I replace the soy sauce for Coconut Aminos. It's delicious and we eat this often!

I made it once, following the recipe.  The second time I made it, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, coated them in flour and I just used HP honey garlic spare rib sauce to cover them and let the slow cooker do it's thing. Easiest meal I've ever made.

My family and I really loved this recipe.  I made it twice in three days, both times with 6 bl/sl thighs instead of 4.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and the general consensus was it was fabulous, but heavy on the soy sauce flavor.

So I switched the soy sauce and honey.  I did 1/2 cup of honey and 1/3 cup of soy sauce.  I also cooked it for an hour longer.  The chicken practically melted in my mouth and the honey-garlic flavors were much stronger, with the soy sauce as a yummy additive instead of monopolizing the whole meal.

Flavor was meh, at best. Texture was repulsive. Might be okay with breasts, or grilled thighs. Interior of the thighs were just bland, boiled mush.

Wanted to love this  because I have been looking for a slow cooker, chicken recipe but... It was SO DIRED OUT AND OVERCOOKED even though I followed the directions exactly.
I thought it was impossible to overcook chicken thighs . :(

I don't understand. I followed recipe closely and my result was a watery, tasteless mess. Chicken thighs release a lot of water when they are cooked. In the end, the sauce was a diluted, watery mess. Fortunately I had some store bough sweet and sour sauce to throw on top to save the dish from being thrown away.

Family definitely enjoyed it! I filled a large crock pot. And used string beans and mixed vegetables it's what I had in the freezer. It was easy prep before work!
I used 1/3 less soy sauce and added Worcestershire sauce to replace the rest of the recipe. And extra garlic. Nice.

I had my teenage daughter put this in the crockpot while I was at work so it must be pretty easy to make! The flavor was good although I was s little worried how my family would like it because of the ketchup in it. (Half of them don't like ketchup).  But everyone ate it and there were no leftovers!

Delicious chicken!!! Only change I made was that I used 8 bone in thighs with the skin. There was still plenty of sauce for double the amount of chicken. I also did add cornstarch to the sauce afterwards to thicken it up to a nice "gravy" consistency. The family loved this chicken, I will be making this again!

There's nothing remarkable about this chicken but based on how easy it was to throw together using things I had on hand and how much my kids and hubby consumed without complaint, it's a solid 4 stars!   My 10 year old chowed a bowl full, my hubby had seconds. I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end like other reviewers recommended, which went really nicely over brown rice and roasted broccoli.

Added a a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and seasoned the chicken with a bit of grill seasoning. Also, thickened it after the fact with corn starch. Came out great. Served with jasmine rice that I doctored up with a bit of caramelized onion, peas and roasted, sliced almonds.

I used 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they were done in my slow cooker after 2 hours on high. But still nice and juicy. Made a sauce with the juices and cornstarch on the stove. Rice and broccoli went well with this dish too. I will make it again and add pineapple chunks to the finished dish.

Made it following the recipe with no changes. Just didn't care for it too much. Soy sauce was easily thing that made the flavor not good to everyone.

April 2017:  This recipe is easy and delicious. I covered the bottom of the crock pot with chicken thighs (15 approx) then added the sauce on top.  I added a bit more honey as I thought it was a little too salty.  Cooked  it 4 hours on high.   Delicious.

I've made these dozens of times, and they are always a hit. The first few times, I followed the recipe exactly except used more chicken. I found this was enough sauce for 8-12 thighs. This is such a flexible recipe! Over time, I've baked this instead of using a slow cooker. I've changed the proportions of ingredients. Sometimes I use 1/2 cup each of soy sauce, ketchup, and honey. Sometimes, I halve the ketchup and make up the difference with an Asian sweet red chile sauce, and sometimes I substitute the sweet red chile sauce for the ketchup completely. We like to add tons of garlic and we almost always add ginger. The Ginger People ginger-sweet red chile sauce is awesome in this. We've never NOT liked whatever we've done with this recipe. I've used bone-in, skin-on thighs as well as boneless. They are all great! Thanks!!

Loved this.  The meat was fall off the bone.  And the flavor was outstanding.  I made exactly as written except I added another garlic clove since that's just our preference, and a 1/2 c. brown sugar to balance the soy sauce.  The chicken looked exactly like the picture and there was plenty of the sauce for rice or potatoes.  We had mashed potatoes from the night before and I also added some green beans.  Perfect meal.   Thanks!  p.s. for those of you who said too salty, use reduced sodium soy sauce or just use less.

I was skeptical about this dish because of the mixed reviews but made it anyway. I used 9 boneless and skinless thighs. I used the low sodium soy sauce and the rest of the original ingredients minus the basil because I didnt have it. I cooked it for six hours and it turned out fine.  Will make it again with the basil to see if it makets a difference.

This was an ok recipe. Like many others, I found the sauce very watery. But, by adding cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water to the liquid and bringing it to a boil on the stove, it made a flavorful sauce. I didn't have any thighs, so I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts which were frozen. Just placed 4 of them (frozen) in the bottom of the slow cooker and covered with the sauce. Cooked for 2 hours on high and 2 on low. Served it over brown rice with a ladle

I made and was very very good.  Next time I will lighten the ketchup and soy a bit, eliminating a bit of saltiness.  I will definetly add either some pepper flakes or hot sauce for a bit of heat.  But for the first go on a recipe I like to follow exactly and make notes when finished, this a good one for the dump and go file.

This was just so-so. Smelled great while cooking, but was lacking in taste. Next time will add onion, ginger, and red pepper flakes as recommended in other reviews.

It came out really well and my family loved it!  I added some onions and bell peppers , like I read in some of the comments.  It helped diffuse the intensity/saltiness of the sauce and added great flavors to it.

I made this recipe twice.  The second time I followed the recommendations of others to reduce the amount of liquid and it still came out like soup.  It did not come out looking browned as it does in the accompanying picture either.  I won't be making this again.

Pass...taste was so off. Did not do the dance with this recipe. Truss. Too sour and not enough sweet to offset. I'm sure I could have modified it, but going off the recipe straight away, I found it to be a very strange flavor.

I made this recipe as directed except I used low sodium soy sauce and only 3 chicken thighs. Turned out great! My husband is very picky and not much of an Asian flavor fan loved it. We paired it with jasmine rice and an Asian vegetable medley. Super easy with ingredients I had on hand.

Too salty & bitter, even with low sodium soy. Maybe this would work as a marinade but not to slow cook meat in. Also, mine came out over cooked, 6 hours on low is too long.

Great recipe!  My daughter devoured it and o enjoyed it as well.  I didn't see any changes I'd make to the recipe.  Possibly a little more soy and garlic sauce but that's just for taste preference.

Crowd pleaser. Mine was done in 5 hours. I even threw in baby carrots under the chicken. Everyone in the fam loved it. I even shared the recipe with a friend. I will be making this again. Also, i used low sodium soy sauce to cut back on the salt since ketchup is salty too. But it was a cheaper meal to feed a bunch of people because I tripled the ingredients then went out for the day and came home to a wonderful smell.

I zipped  it up a bit. I added 1/4 cup bbq sauce,1 tablespoon chili sauce, 1 teaspoon ground ginger,  1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper,1/2 can of pineapple tidbits w/juice,3 chopped green onions and one red pepper chopped. I only cooked it for 4 hrs and the chicken fell off the bone. At the end I thickened the sauce with 1 tablespoon cornstarch.   Yummy

Haven't had much luck with new recipes lately...this ended that! This was so yummy :)I used 6 thighs and I used double the garlic and  I ,like other people , used cornstarch to thicken the juice up after....tried 1tbl but it only thickened a little  So  I used just a little more....I'm sure most people know how to add it but just in case this is how I did it....cold water mixed into the cornstarch in a small seperate container I removed the chicken ,put my slow cooker on high then stirred in the cornstarch mixture and stirred for a couple minutes.... Let it cook just a bit then returned the meat into the slow cooker and placed on warm and served... Was great with chicken stuffing drizzled the juice over the stuffing. Awesome!

It was pretty good. A little salty due to the soy sauce so I'm thinking I'll use reduced sodium next time. Quick, easy, family loved it.

I made this as written, using lower sodium soy sauce.  The salt level was not overpowering at all.  I cooked on low, for about 4 hours.  In the last 30 minutes I added some sauteed chunks of onion and red pepper, and some steamed broccoli and carrots.  Yes, there was a lot of sauce, but so delicious that I didn't mind.  I served this over a rice blend.  I will definitely make again.

I was really happy with how this turned out. I was a little skeptical about the ingredients but it was really tasty and the chicken was super moist. I used 9 bone-in skinless thighs with the amount of sauce in the recipe and there was lots of sauce leftover. I also added chopped green pepper, onion and pineapple during the last 30 minutes of cooking and it was a really nice addition to the dish. Served over rice.

My husband and I were both really disappointed in the results.  The tomato taste from the ketchup was to strong.  With so many other great, simple crockpot recipes out there, I can't see myself making this again.

Not good.  Sauce was thin mixed with the grease from the chicken. The flavor was bland and the meat was dry.  Would definitely NOT recommend!

Too much ketchup made it taste meh and honestly kind of weird. I recommend letting the honey and garlic be the stars to this. Lessening the ketchup would still leave you with plenty of sauce.

I followed another reviewer's suggestions and added pineapple chunks , sliced onions, and sliced green bell pepper, and also added  zucchini wedges at the last 30 min.  I of cooking. A also increased the garlic to 7 cloves, and eyeballed equal parts of the sauces it was delicious. 

I used my oven on 400 and wrapped it in foil the whole time , it took about 1 hour for the whole cut up chicken and veggies to be done.

I used this recipe in my electric pressure cooker and it was marvelous!  I didn't change anything about the recipe except the cooking time.  In my 8 qt pressure cooker, I used the Soup/Stew setting for 10 minutes.  Like the slow-cooker instructions state, I just threw everything in the cooker together.  I manually released the steam and, as others suggested, thickened the sauce after taking out the chicken using a cornstarch slurry.  I asked the Hubs if I should rate it 4 or 5 stars and he immediately said "FIVE!"  Served with noodles and winter mix of vegetables, steamed with garlic.  Yum!

Very easy to make with ingredients most people have on hand. My family loved it and want me to make it again. I used 10 chicken thighs and cooked them in a 5 L crockpot for 4 hours on high. The recipe makes enough sauce for the additional thighs I added. I cut the soya sauce down to 1/3 of a cup due to previous complaints is saltiness and added a teaspoon of minced ginger. I added sliced  onions and put the thighs on top in crockpot.

I have made this recipe twice now. Both times I have gotten nothing but good reviews from my family. What's most impressive is my "picky eater" eats it with no complaints. That's a win in my book! 
I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, and I   used basil from my garden vs dry. I also always use more garlic than suggested, we are garlic lovers in this home. 
Thanks for the recipe, this is a keeper in our home?

I changed the recipe to be a bit healthier.  I used Braggs Amino Liquid instead of soy sauce (which helped reduce the sodium and gave me a non-GMO soy flavor) and used free-range chicken breast instead of thighs.  The chicken was falling apart in 5 hrs and was thoroughly cooked at high altitude.  I steamed carrots in the rice steamer with the wild rice.  Fantastic dinner!!!

I've made this twice, first time I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was a bit too salty. Second time I used 6 boneless skinless thighs, and I used only 1/4 cup of soy sauce and added 1/4 cup of water. Cooked in my 4 quart for 4 hrs and 45 mins. My 4 1/2 year old, 3 year old and husband all LOVED it. Will definitely be adding to our recipe rotation.

I have  failed at a lot of slow cooker meat recipes. I made this one with seven thighs and kept the sauce ingredients the same - but only cooked it for 5 hours on low. It was awesome and the kids gobbled it up. I removed the chicken and added cornstarch to the liquid and served the gravy over rice with the chicken.

This was so good it's worth way more than 5 stars!!  I only had boneless chicken breasts, so I used them and cut back the cooking time.  2 hours before finish, I added just a few shakes of pepper flakes, and later slightly thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  My husband is already begging me to make it again!

I've made this twice now with very poor results. The chicken comes out over cooked, totally dried out. I've never had that happen with thighs before. It is possible that it's due to me leaving  it on the keep warm setting until we return from work but either way hubby and I haven't cared for the flavor.

Absolutely scrumptious.  I made 12 with skin on so broiled on high for 5 minutes before serving because I like the skin to be crispy.  No need to increase sauce.

Very easy with minimal ingredients, served this dish at a Halloween Potluck - everyone loved it and I am still getting requests for the recipe!  I doubled the recipe and it worked well.  I'm making this again today and will use the tips of others to add cornstarch to the sauce after cooking for a thicker sauce and will add pineapple chunks for my family.

Substituted chicken breasts and cooked a little longer to account for the size. The flavors were very good but it came out VERY DRY. it fell apart but there was no moisture in the chicken. Maybe it'd be different with dark meat.

This was very easy and straight forward to make. I used thighs with skin & bones (more flavor and the fat is easy to  get rid of later). I first put a decent crisp on the skin side of the thighs in a 12" non-stick skillet over med-high heat, also for more flavor. I put them in the slow cooker skin side down and then followed the recipe.  Next time I will try to shorten the cooking time because they were just a touch dry, probably because I jump started the cooking by starting them in a skillet? I used it for pulled chicken sandwiches and they were very tasty...

Very good.  Put a layer of chopped onion in 1 T. butter in bottom of crock pot, then arranged frozen chicken breasts on top.  Cooked on high for a hour or so then added honey garlic mixture.  Continued on low for about two more hours then removed lid for last hour to cook off excess juices.  Note: The cooking time noted may be for the older crock pots that have lower cooking temperatures.

I doubled this recipe before reading all the reviews. So after I did, glad I used low sodium soy, added brown sugar and small amount of Baby Ray's to offset the salt and ketchup. Tasted good, but was overcooked after 4 hrs. My crock won't set for less than 7 hrs on low. Since it was overcooked, I put it food processor chopped it up, divided portion and made chicken salad out of part and bbq chicken sandwiches out of the rest.

The chicken is very tender but the glaze didn't stick on my chicken and was basically a thin broth. I discarded the broth, shredded the leftover chicken, and added some BBQ sauce  for BBQ chicken sandwiches tomorrow.

This recipe was pretty good. The ketchup made the chicken more bitter than I would've liked, but overall it was really easy and tasty.

The sauce was much thinner than I expected and saturated the chicken, instead of creating a nice glaze like in the photo. It was way too salty and tasted more BBQ-esque than Asian. My husband hated it and I won't make it again.

I did not care for this. The cooking time was also off; it was done after 4 hours on low (my crockpot doesn't get too hot, and I've never had a problem with over cooking things in it).

My family really enjoyed this. I used 8 thighs instead of 4, but left everything else the same. There was plenty of sauce and enough for leftovers. I will make this again. It was not salty at all!

The chicken was fantastic! Moist and good flavor. I used half the recipe, but I used breast instead of thighs. Also my breast is already marinated with lemon garlic.

Great taste, sweet and savory. I substituted thighs with breast. Chicken came out slightly dry but the taste made up for it.

My only adjustment was using double the boneless thighs. !t is very salty. The chicken, however, was cooked perfect and It is so easy to make. I think I will try again with boneless breasts as I think it could be the flavor of the thighs I just don't care for. I am going to also add some pineapple as another reviewer did. It will add sweetness and a fresh flavor I feel this is lacking.

I wasn't able to get boneless, skinless thighs.  Used boneless skinless chicken tenderloins instead. And used 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. Cooked it on low for around 4 hours. So good!

We love this recipe!!  It was super easy to make and smelled delicious while it was cooking.  Mine were done after 3 hours on low in my crock pot, I guess its hotter than normal. I'm trying the sauce with chicken wings tonight, its going to be a favorite I'm sure.

not one of my favorites. The flavor was just not there. I followed the recipe exactly with no substitutions. I served it over rice.  it was very easy to make, but sometimes ease does not mean flavor.

This was very good! I doubled the amount of chicken used. I also doubled the amount of honey and basil but kept the rest of the ingredient amounts the same. The chicken was so tender that it was falling apart, and the flavor was great. My husband raved about this.

I needed to tweak the basic sauce recipe. 1/4 cup soy sauce. 1/2 cup ketchup. 1/3 cup honey. 1/4 cup brown sugar. Large onion sliced. I tablespoon red crushed red pepper flakes. 3 cloves chopped garlic. Cooked on high one hour and then on low for 3 hours. I used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs. Served with brown rice and roasted broccoli. It was absolutely delish!!! Don't forget to spoon extra sauce over rice and broccoli.  : )

I agree with the statements: 1/4 c soy, use cornstarch to thicken juices to make a true glaze. I added sesame seeds to garnish and ginger to the glaze.  PERFECT!  My crock tends to run hot, so my chicken only took 4 hours to cook on low.  I think 8 hours is misleading unless you are cooking from frozen.  My family loved this recipe.

AWESOME dish. And SO easy! I did tweak the recipe per other reviewers suggestions: halved the soy and used low sodium, boiled down the "sauce" and thickened before serving, added a little ginger to the soy/honey/ketchup mix and only cooked for five hours. And I didn't have bone in skin on thighs... so boneless skinless it was! The meal was absolutely fantastic, infused with rich flavor. A very nice blend of salty and sweet without being too much of either. This will become a staple in my household as everyone loved it.

This receipe is very easy to make, and it's good.  I almost doubled the thighs but kept the sauce the same, which I wouldn't do again.  Next time I'll cut the soy sauce down to a tablespoon or two.  It was quite heavy with the soy sauce and was more teriyaki than honey-garlic.  It did cook up soft and juicy and I served it with green-bean casserole and stuffing leftover from Christmas.  Thanks for sharing this receipe!

Topped it with toasted sesame seeds and doubled the sauce, thickened it with corn starch and used the sauce over brown rice and served sauteed veggies with it.

We enjoyed this.  I forgot to add the basil, but it still worked.  I also ended up cooking it on high for 3 hours because I realized I was going to run out of time.  Next time, I will try using half the soy sauce.  Some of the comments to change this up look like they would work to make it feel like a different dish - the pineapple and bell pepper, the brown sugar, etc.  Thanks for this recipe.  We will definitely have this again!

1/2 cup of Soya sauce is way TOO MUCH! It should be 2-3 tbsps of soya sauce.  Luckily I tasted the sauce before cooking with it, I had to re-ajust it with brown sugar and a can of pineapples with juices to cut the soduim.

These were good. My family loved them especially my husband. I thought they were a little salty. Next time I will used less soy sauce. I used 5 thighs and had tons of sauce left over i just put it over mashed potatoes.  It was done in about 4 hours on low. Will make again.

This is the first review I have written. But I just can't believe how much of a hit this chicken is! I made it last week. my husband is a very picky eater (no onions , tomatoes, etc...), so I am always trying new recipes. then my husband requested it again! we both love it. we even plan to make it for a get-together that is coming up! Absolutely love this chicken.

I thought this recipe turned out great.  I used 6 thighs and I added about 1/4 cup brown suger so that it wouldn't be too salty.  I also added some oregano and cooked on low for about 4.5 hours

Added more chicken thighs. Cut soy sauce in half. Still a bit too salty. Will try next with low sodium soy sauce. When done cooking I removed chicken and thickened sauce with cornstarch. Added chicken back to sauce and served over rice. Very good and will make again.

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have any garlic cloves so I just seasoned my chicken with garlic powder instead (along with a few other spices I love to season my meats with). Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'll be using it for years to come.

Absolutely delicious!!!!!  I used boneless skinless breasts for this and i loved and took some to my mother in law to share! I used a little more chicken and doubled the sauce for mine.  I also was short on time, I sliced the chicken width wise to make them thinner and quicker to cook, I let them cook 3 hours but probably only needed 2.  Meat was so flavorful.  I made rice with and spooned sauce over rice as well. Delicious!

Made it just as the recipe calls for and the whole family devoured it. I've made it with both frozen (I know, controversial) and defrosted chicken thighs, adjusting the cooking time. I sometimes use 2 lbs of chicken and 1.5x the sauce recipe and it works just fine. I have to adjust the cooking time by keeping an eye on it b/c the cookers don't all run at the same temp.

This was delicious!  The sauce is more of a glaze which was nice, however, once you cook it, it becomes thinner.  I wanted some veggies in mine so I added water chestnuts, red bell pepper, onion, snow peas, and jalapenos for some heat!  Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe!  Loved it!  It was easy to make and had lots of flavor.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce but otherwise used the ingredients as called for. I also used 8 chicken thighs and there was plenty of sauce for all eight.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch just before serving and it was a big hit. This is a definite keeper.

Ok, had tonight,added 1 can of pineapple chunks, drained about 2/3. My hubby loves pineapple! I also halved the amount of soy sauce and doubled the skinless boneless chicken thighs. 8 min at 15 psi in my electric pressure cooker. Served over cooked broken thin spaghetti that I put a pat of butter on. Poured the contents of pressure cooker over the spaghetti and.....DELICIOUS! I thought it was great for a quick and tasty supper! Next time, I think I will add some freshly grated ginger and serve over Ramen noodles. Thanks for a very nice recipe!

YA GOTTA TRY THIS!  Hubby ate seconds - he NEVER eats seconds, and the son moaned his way thru the meal.  Don't overcook; I did for maybe an hour and the chicken almost began to be tough.  Great flavor.  I opted for an easy meal after work and served this with rice-a-roni and cooked frozen english peas, thinking this would just get us through the evening.  My mistake - this was such a keeper!  Only change was using 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/2 cup. DO TRY THIS!  Thanks so much, Myrna!

FANTASTIC! Kids loved it so much they warmed some up for breakfast!  I might add some red-pepper flakes next time for a little heat. The suggestion of others to add peppers or pineapple sound great and I'll do it next time. I tripled the sauce ingredients and used the whole Costco pack of thighs - I think that's 30, and can freeze in the sauce - if the kids don't inhale it all first.  Enjoy!!

doubled the sauce and used three large breast cut into three pieces each.  came out succulent and tasty!  although my teenage girls found the taste a little over-powering,  next time I would cut back on the ketchup.

I made this recipe and it was a hit.  Was easy and all I did was start it in the AM and had my hands free all day.  Note:  Use the soy sauce with low sodium, otherwise it would be too salty.

I read the countless rave reviews and gave this a try.  I followed the recipe as many have suggested.  Here's my assessment- if you're used to really cooking and you consider yourself to have somewhat of a sophisticated palate, you'll find this mediocre.  I love the fact it's a no brainer and easy to make- but if you've ever used the sauce/marinade Soy Vey: it tasted almost exactly the same.  It was just fine...

I liked this recipe. I used boneless chicken breasts and it was a little dry.  Next time, more garlic and chicken thighs.

I followed the recipe exactly as is and based on that, would not make it again. I put it on for the specified time and it was burnt. A bit of water added to the slow cooker would help.  I also thought it had too much honey.

This was excellent. Read other review - doubled the garlic, doubled the chicken (used bone-in/skinless) thighs (about 8) and kept other measurements the same.   made with yellow rice/peas.   HUGE hit!

This was pretty good! Only thing I changed was I didn't have thighs all I had was breasts, came out great. I was worried it was going to be to salty as some of the reviews stated, but it wasn't at all. Will make again.

I liked the recipe. I used Low-Sodium soy sauce. I didn't have enough honey, so I used the honey I had, plus a spoonful of Peach Preserves. I also added a teaspoon of fresh ground ginger along with a little extra garlic. My only problem was that I think the 6 hour cook time is too long. The chicken was dry. Next time I'll try 4 hours.

This was delicious.  I had to make a few changes because I work long days and this recipe calls for it to cook for 6 hours.  I put my thighs in frozen.  Since I knew they would add water to the recipe I tweaked the ingredients a little bit.  I only used about 1/4 cup of soy sauce, (that was an accident, I ran out) I used 3/4c of ketchup and 3/4 cup of honey.  I also used 8 thighs and skipped the basil ( I did not have any) and cooked it on low for 9 hours.  It was fabulous.

I enjoyed this very much. It took almost no time to prepare and the sauce was really tasty--so much so I was licking my plate clean!  As for someone who thought it was salty, mine wasn't but the soy sauce I have is a low-sodium one.

This was such a great meal. I used low sodium soy sauce and added 1/4 of pure maple syrup with the honey and it cut a bit of the tang from th I will use chicken breast next time as the thighs are a lil greasy.

My boyfriend and I thought the 1/2 cup of soy sauce ruined this recipe. After I made it, all I could taste was the soy sauce, and nothing else. I probably will not make this again.

I added some finely chopped onion and sliced carrots. Had to add an Arrowroot slurry to thicken the sauce. Added some green onions before serving on a bed of mashed cauliflower. Yum!

I made this last night and it was delicious! My family loved it. I used 8 thighs instead of 4, with the same amount of sauce. I also used syrup instead of honey because that was all I had in my house. I also added carrots, green beans, and onions into the slow cooker with the chicken. I will definitely make this again =)

This has gotten onto my school day menu!  Makes a wonderful meal all of my kids love.  It is quick to prepare and for sides I just throw together some rice and veggies.  Goes great with the sauce!  I've made it with garlic powder when I'm out of cloves,  and even in desperation, I've used corn syrup in place of honey.  It always turns out great, and great For the budget too.

This was wonderful and toddler approved. The only modification I had to make was substituting the honey with maple syrup since our little honey bear was empty. I will be adding this to my rotation of slow cooker recipes.

I doubled the chicken but left the sauce as is, as many reviewers suggested. I had bone in/ skin on chicken, so I used that. Had it in the slow cooker for 6 hrs on low and it came out perfect, and the meat slipped right off the bone. I think I'd take the skin off next time as it looked soggy, but my husband suggested maybe putting it under the broiler for 5 mins before serving.

This was super good!  I used bone-in chicken (that's what I had on hand) and, after reading other reviews, halved the ingredients for the sauce.  It made just the right amount but will use original amounts next time as the sauce is amazing over rice!  I will make this again.

I did this with a whole chicken, turned out great, simple and tasty - slow cooker chicken is tender but can be bland, this is a good way to give flavour. like another reviewer, I thickened the sauce  with cornflour, as the juices made it runny. I did this on the stove top but  I think you can do it in the slow cooker if you add the cornflour slurry say half an hour before serving. A whole chicken might need more time or a higher setting (usual advice is 4-5 hours on High), and more fat will run off so you'll probably need to skim the sauce if you want to try this.

Wow was this good. Was looking for something to get going quick and come home to a meal. What an excellent recipe, delicious. The photo does not do it justice. Should have taken a photo served on a plate because it looked terrific. Had brown rice and corn on the cob with a nice salad. What a meal, hmmmm. Will take a better one next time as this will definitely be cooked again. Thanks for posting.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I didn't taste the honey or garlic at all, just the ketchup and soy sauce.  Also, the chicken was a little dry.  It wasn't bad and it was super simple to make using things that I usually have on hand in the kitchen, but I doubt I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I did first was brown my chicken thighs in a little hot oil to get a nice crispy golden crust on it. Then I tossed it all in the crock pot added the sauce. Chicken was tender, juicy and good but a little on the greasy side. The flavor just wasn't Asian enough for me. I think a little ginger & hot sauce would have given it more of that Asian flare. Not bad, but needs tweaking for my personal taste.

I love no brainer recipes that don't need a lot of a attention and result in deliciousness. The recipe is quite generous with the sauce. I used 6 bone in, skin on thighs, but i think i could have squeezed in a few more bits and still have enough yumminess to go around. I will definitely make this for my next dinner party. Oh, and i use soy sauce with less sodium, so maybe that helped reduce the saltiness that some people may not care for.

This was delicious! Everyone ate it, even my picky kids and my husband who doesn't usually like soy sauce. I was pressed for time, so I baked it, but I will be adding this to my list of regular slow-cooker freezer meals for the school year.

I loved this recipe as did all the guests at the pot luck dinner I took them.  I did not have 6 hours to cook them so I put them in a 9x13 pan and baked them at 325 degrees for and hour or so until done.  I then put thighs in the crock pot to take to the pot luck and everyone loved them. So if you do not have the time bake first then transfer to the crock pot to keep them warm and everyone will rave about them.  Thanks for this recipe as it will be used often.

I made a few additions, putting some chopped sweet potato at the bed of the slow cooker, and adding some some chili powder and some of the Emeril essence spice mix. It may have been my spicy additions that caused it, but it was a little too salty for me - I'll likely cut the amount of soy sauce in half next time.

The chicken came out really moist and flavorful. I used eight chicken thighs instead of the four. Recipe should be cut in half for the amount of chicken recommended.

I loved this.  Tastes like Chinese food.  After cooking, I put it in a bowl and mixed it with some stir fry veggies, then served it over rice.

This recipe was really good, i would maybe like to sweeten it a bit, or add a little less soya sauce. I will definitely try it again!

Delicious and super easy!  I followed the directions exactly as written and followed the recommendations of other reviewers by adding cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Served over rice with a side of broccoli.  The whole family (including a 4 year old and 1 year old) loved it.

I honestly don't know how anyone could rate this positively. This was probably the worst recipe I've ever made off of this site. The chicken was dry, the sauce was way too salty and sweet, and overall it was just bad. What a waste of ingredients. 

Make at your own risk!

The sauce had too much of a soy sauce flavor, the aftertaste lingered and it was not well liked by the family. I would be willing to retry it with less soy sauce, less ketchup, but more honey and garlic.

Loved the concept but, cut the soy and ketchup in 1/2 and it was still way salty. Added fresh ginger and some fresh squeezed OJ. My DH. Loved it. Should have topped with chopped cilantro and green onions but forgot. Not sure I will make again.

I'll be honest, I almost didn't make this bc of the soy sauce/ketchup combo. I read the comments, a lot of positive ones. A few people said they subbed BBQ sauce for ketchup.  I had 1 pack of thighs, which was 3 lbs, maybe 10 thighs. I used 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup each of BBQ sauce & ketchup. I only had garlic powder,  few dashes of sesame oil & a small can of crushed pineapple (I assume it was an 8 oz can) Cooked on high for 3 hours. Came out perfectly! I will have to buy 2 packs of chicken next time & double recipe. I'm glad I made it. Even picky teen had 2 helpings. We ate with side of rice & broccoli florets.

I had about 10 pieces of chicken instead of 4 so I doubled the sauce recipe. It turned out so good. This was another recipe I made for guests and everyone loved it. My kids also loved it so that's always super important. Might try it with skinless because obviously the skin cannot become crispy in the crockpot.

Tasted nothing like honey garlic. The soy was so over powering...my husband mildly liked it so will take it to work but ended up with a frozen pizza instead. Very disappointed.

It was salty, acidic and my chicken came out dry. But I will say that I had to cook on high in the interest of time. So, I will try it one more time per the instructions to the team and update if it tastes better. We'll see.

I've made this dish several times now and love it! I am very happy with how simple and easy it is to make. I even let some friends try it and they thought I was a professional chef after trying it.??

Instead of ketchup, I used BBQ sauce. Turned out well and family enjoyed it! Will keep this recipe for sure.

This was easy to do but the chicken came out mushy and although I love basil it gave this recipe an odd twang.

Delicious! My slow cooker tends to run at a higher temperature than average so I only put it in for 4 hours instead of 6. Additionally I added less soy sauce as I find the flavor tends to overpower others. Chicken ended up tender and the sauce was flavorful and had enough layers to satisfy both picky eaters and more distinguished older palates.

I have to agree with some of the others, the soy sauce was overwhelming and very salty. Not crazy about it, won't make it again.

Because I used bone in instead of boneless thighs this may have cooked faster! I really don’t know but although it was in lots of sauce, the meat was dry. Otherwise I really liked it and so did my husband. Next time I will try cooking for 4 hrs and then tasting it. I can always add more time if it isn’t quite done.  You can use low sodium soy sauce for those who thought it was too salty

This was only so-so.  Followed the instructions exactly, meat was way too dry. 

I think six hours is overkill, but it just isn't good enough to try again.

Sadly not very tasty, the ketchup and soy sauce together was just too much and made it taste like salty vinegar. Won't be making this again.

First of all, there is no way that you can cook this for 6 hours!!! I temped it after 2 1/2 hours and it was done. At first  I thought this was going to have an Asian flavor, but it turned out more like a bbq sauce. I did half the basil, thinking this was kind of a strange spice to add. Halfing it created a very slight basil flavor with an unique taste. I ended up slicing the chicken across the grain and serving it as sandwiches on toasted garlic toast, and topped in with a bit of tangy coleslaw. It was a great recipe served this way. Which is the only way I will serve it in the future.

I made this as my first slow cooker meal a few years ago. I'm still making it today. I pair it with jasmine rise and allrecipe's garlic broccoli, as suggested by Christina in the top comment. My girlfriend loves it.

Put this in the crockpot before I left for work at noon so the hubs wouldn’t have to stress for dinner. Made the sauce in a pan and heated it up, added cornstarch slurry. Poured it over the six chicken thighs (they we partially frozen) added some cut up frozen bell peppers, a dash of ginger and some dehydrated chopped onion. Cut the soy sauce in half. Set that baby on low, cooked for six hours. The family LOVED IT! Hubs only had to make rice and roast broccoli. Easy peasy!

It tasted very good. I made it but unfortunately when chicken soak in a slow cooker...my crockpot....it looked nothing like the savory chicken depicted on the all recipe pic. Bland smooth brown. I believe that was oven cooked in the pic because it appears roasted.

Stumbled upon this one when browsing with the picky fiance, and he thought it looked good. I made it with chicken tenderloins, garlic powder instead of minced cloves (just using what I already had), and baked instead of slow cooker... Still came out good and the picky eater loved it too.

I used my mini slow cooker 1.5 quarts - 3 chicken thighs and the same liquid.   You could cut down some on the liquid.   Hubby suggested replacing some of the soy sauce with teriyaki.   I only cooked it for 4 hours and it was well done.

Delicious and there was nothing left after we ate dinner.

Loved this recipe.   Even my picky eater 95 year old mother cleaned her plate!    Others have added a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce a bit, I may do the same.  Otherwise it was so good using the recipe.

This was very good.  I made the changes to only cook it for four hours on low and cook in oven at 400 for 20  minutes.  I used fresh garlic which I minced directly on the chicken and fresh basil sprinkled over the top.  I also added fresh molasses into the sauce; about a 1/3 a cup.  I didn’t use onion (garlic and onion are too much from the same family!).  It wasn’t too salty and was enough for six thighs.  This was very tender and I will definitely make again.

Very good! The chicken came out the perfect consistency. I liked the sauce, added more garlic but had to substitute some of the soy sauce because I didn't have enough.

I used the whole package of 12 boneless skinless thighs which just fit into my large oval slow cooker. The sauce recipe was plenty for the 12 thighs. I added 3 Tbs of cornstarch that I mixed with 3 Tbs water at the end & turned it up to high to thicken.

I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. The chicken fell apart easily, but was still very dry. Not sure what I could change to fix the issue.

This recipe is perfect! I already had reduced sodium soy sauce, so that works great for those who have issues with salt. This is by far the best chicken I've ever made. And it turned out soooo juicy.

Well worth making. This makes a lot of sauce so I would at least double the amount of chicken. I also thickened the sauce with some cornstarch. Lastly  it doesn't take as long to cook as the say. At least an hour less.

I tripled the recipe. Only had 1 tsp of basil. Other than that I followed recipe to the T.  The thighs were way too salty. (maybe should have used low salt soya sauce).  I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar and it was better.  On top of the basmati rice was again a bit better. I will try this recipe again.  But I will use low salt soya sauce and cut the quantity in half.

This is great & easy!  Did use 9 skinless chicken thighs, did not change sauce except 5 garlic instead of 4 & 1/4 C of honey...did as others, thickened sauce after chicken done.  Second time around, I added cap of "smoke" & oh, what a great taste also.  Used low sodium soy sauce.

This was good but not great. I think if I were to make again I would add more garlic and honey. Made as written but with 4 garlic cloves and we could taste the soy and some sweetness but not the honey garlic we were looking for.

Used 8 boneless thighs (they were small).  Cooked these in the instant pot instead of crockpot.  Sautéd the thighs in 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Added the sauce over the thighs and cooked on high pressure for 10 min.  Slow release for 8 min.  The meat fell apart!  Delicious and much quicker than the crockpot...served over jasmine rice with a vegetable on the side.

I have made this recipe several times, following the recipe exactly and it has been delicious each and every time. This last time though, I used a multi cooker (like an Instant Pot). I put the sauce together the same way and added the chicken. I cooked it on high pressure for 30 minutes and it was done! The family agreed that it tasted even better, as if the flavors were infused into the chicken all the way through! Delicious!

Just loved it!   I used bone in, skin on thighs and cooked it almost 8 hours.  I added 1 teaspoon mustard powder.  I followed advice and thickened the sauce with corn starch for the last hour.  Fell off the bone and was incredible!  I’m saving the sauce to use on my next victim!   Kildare r be easier or yummier!??

It seemed over-cooked at 6 hours on low.  Actually tasted almost burnt and chicken was dry.  It smelled wonderful cooking, but was disappointed in the final result.  May try again, but will cook it for less time.

SO, so good! I used an instapot instead of a slow cooker. Set pot for 13 minutes and let it vent on it’s own. I also added 1 tsp red pepper flakes for some heat. Served over white rice and served w/sautéed green beans. Will definitely make this again!

This has been in my saved recipes for a while...Minimal, staple pantry items thrown in a crockpot, what’s not to love? I had a tray of 12 small, boneless, skinless chicken thighs but numerous people commented that increasing the amounts was not necessary and that turned out to be true. I had misgivings about using ketchup so ended up using BBQ sauce instead. As always when using soy sauce in recipes, I use the low sodium version.  I also added about a tablespoon of crushed red pepper to spice it up. As others suggested, after 5 hours in the crockpot, I put the sauce in a saucepan and added cornstarch to thicken it up which I drizzled over the chicken and some brown rice. I would make again but it’s not one of my favorites.

Came out great! I used low sodium soy though. Used thighs and breast on the bone. Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hrs on high. Removed chicken and added corn starch to sauce to thicken. Would make again and even add some veggies at end

Very tasty. It was very easy. I cooked the bone-in, skin on thighs on high in my slow cooker for 4 hours. Chicken was perfectly done.

I just made this tonight after seeing the video a few days ago & knowing I had all the ingredients in my pantry, and I LOVE chicken thighs vs breast.
I placed my frozen 4 thighs & 2 breasts in my crockpot, made the sauce, and poured over chicken.  Set it for 6 hrs on low as the recipe states.  When it was finished, my crockpot had about a 1/2 inch of liquid sauce in the bottom and my chicken looked nothing like the picture.  It was not a thick glaze but more of a liquid soup.  Sooo disappointing.  The only thing the sauce did was perhaps infiltrate the meat, but EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF MEAT was totally dry, even the thighs.  The breasts were even worse.
I don't know how this recipe failed as I followed every step correctly, but this will not be a keeper for our family.  Very disappointed.

Made in my Instant Pot. Added pineapple tidbits and some juice and used frozen chicken thighs. 15 minutes, then 15 minutes natural release. I then removed the chicken to an oven proof dish, and thickened the sauce with cornstarch on Saute. Placed the sauce in the dish over the chicken and baked at 450 for about 10 minutes.

Super easy and super delicious!! I can't have the gluten so I changed out the soy sauce for liquid aminos and we couldn't even tell. My husband who doesn't like thighs, ate 3 pieces and raved how good it was! A must keep for the weekly meal rotation!!

Awesome! I used bone-in thighs but removed the skin. They were ready after 4 1/2 hours on low. Then I thickened the juice with corn starch slurry. Nothing was left!

Followed the recipe exactly (unusual for me).
My  Husband is a diabetic so a lot of times I have to adjust.'
THIS ONE I DID NOT have to do anything to.  
It was delicious, my husband 
LIKED IT!!!
Only thing was my slow cooker on low is more like on high so I have to use an instant read thermometer to keep track of the temperature.
Caveat: I did reduce the sauce to about 1/2 and used it for a glaze.
This is a keeper for us.

I doubled the sauce recipe with 12 chicken thighs. It was an easy work night meal. It missing a little depth though.  Maybe next time I'll add in some sliced onions and peppers. One thing I will say is 4 to 4 1/2 hours on low in the crockpot is enough for us. When chicken is in the crockpot so long it becomes so tender it's almost mushy.  we like our chicken to still feel like meat. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used 8 pieces of boneless/skinless chicken thighs and legs (2 sections from the Costco package). I used low sodium soy sauce and reduced that to 1/3 cup. I used BBQ instead of ketchup (I think someone mentioned it in a review, not sure though). Anyway, it was delicious! I may cut back a little on the honey if I use BBQ again next time. It didn't taste too sweet at all, but that adds up to a good amount of sugar. I had a cup or more of the sauce left over and froze that. Not sure what I'll do with it... maybe use it as a marinade for grilled chicken? I also used the leftover chicken on top of my salad the next day. 
Overall very delicious and VERY cheap recipe. Thanks for posting it!!

I really don't understand the hype for this.I even followed the tips to add; more thighs, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and substitute coconut Aminos for soy sauce,add corn starch at the end and cook for 4 -4.5 hours. YUCK, YUCK, YUCK. i will delete this and never cook it again.

I made this as the recipe suggested and then thickened the sauce to pour over the chicken and rice. I also added broccoli. I think next time I’ll cut back on the soy sauce and the ketchup as it was a tad salty. Overall, my kids liked. I’ll make this again.

I followed the recipe except that i had 8 thighs. there was still plenty of juice, which was on the thin side. this was ok, as i put it in the cooked rice to add flavor. however i think i should have added some chili paste to kick it up a notch. next time. Also the chicken was done after 5 hours on high. good slow cooker recipe.

It was better warmed over the second night.
I kept the juices from cooking and made a sauce, reduce and add roux to thicken, with mushrooms, nice addition

This recipe was a huge disappointment. We tried it in our new crockpot. It  just did not taste well. My kids refused to eat it, after the first bite.

I didn't change a thing...but in my slow cooker they only took 4 hours on low (6 thighs).  Glad I checked it when I did, they were falling off the bone and delicious!

I increased the sauce recipe by half for six, rather than four, thighs; didn't have to do that after all - there was plenty of sauce, which I thickened with cornstarch and served it as a gravy over the thighs on white rice.  Definitely a keeper recipe - simple, and yummy!

Just a little mention - I would use slow cooker liners to save on mess/cleanup instead of aluminum foil as mentioned, as it has been strongly suggested that tomato products (in this case, ketchup) leaches the aluminum out of the foil, and contributes to Alzheimers.  I've seen the black residue that has come off on the food when I've covered lasagna!  Otherwise the recipe is AWESOME!

Followed the recipe to a tee....need MANY MORE chicken thighs as there is SO MUCH SAUCE... I don’t even like honey barbecue but this was awesome. I think and the sauce with flour and water and sprinkled sesame seeds on when serving. I did not roast the seasame seeds.  Chicken is extra tender

What is a substitute for soy sauce if you are allergic to soy? I agree it is a bit salty; double the chicken and keep the sauce ingredients the same.

I was out of soy sauce and substituted beef broth. Otherwise it might have been a 5 star dinner. My husband gave it a thumbs up and it will stay in the rotation!

This was very easy and tasty!  My husband loved it!  I found that the cook time for 6 hours was too much. I would say 4-5 hours on low would be enough. I also thickened the gravy with flour and it

I logged on at 1pm and was eating dinner by 6:30. I followed the recipe exactly, for ingredients. Cooked on high for 2 hours, and low for 3 hours. I removed the thighs , added a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken juices, turned back to high for a few minutes and dinner was ready. Served with a brown rice/quinoa mix with dried cherries, and broccoli. It was a quick delicious meal that had tender, moist chicken. Definitely a keeper.

I added a half-cup chicken broth to make it a full cup.  The recipe turned out perfect.  Meat fell off the bone.  I recommend rice or pasta as a side.

I used my InstantPot to cook the chicken using the trivet. It was falling apart tender. THEN I made the mistake of removing meat (as suggested) but when I reset to Saute to thicken the sauce, the temp was very high and I put the chicken into the pot. Toughened the chicken. The flavor was good but my mistake as a new InstantPot user and just a fair cook.  Yipes.

I added one onion chopped medium and one cup of baby carrots to the bottom of the crock pot. I also included several slices of fresh ginger and used about half of the honey the recipe called for. In addition, I used low sodium soy sauce and no sugar added ketchup. I served it with roasted cauliflower and a tossed salad for a quick week night meal.

Perhaps my slow cooker was  too hot , but at 6 hours the meat was firm and dry. All we could taste was the sauce. Not for us.

I have made this recipe 3 times so far and EVERY ONE of my 3 picky teenagers loves it. The only thing I did differently was add 1/4 cup ketchup instead 1/2 cup, and 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  The trick for our family? Pull the chicken out and shred it in a bowl, serve with the sauce on the side. Didn't love it as much when I put the sauce over the top before serving.  We eat this with a microwaved bag of sticky rice and a salad on the side.  Sooo yummy!  Is now part of our regular menu.

Followed the recipe exactly, although a little more generous with the basil ... it was SO good, the kids gobbled it up with smashed potatoes and greens on the side. I used bone in maryland cuts with skin on and the chicken was falling off the bone! Superb. The smells throughout the house really got the appetites going!

I browned the thighs in olive oil in a cast iron skillet and then baked it for an hour at 350 degrees-same ingredient, just added Mannix Ground Vanilla to bring out the flavors.

Made this for the Monday Night Football crowd, Was a big hit! I added some Maple syrup and cayenne pepper sauce to give it a little kick, next time will add more... 
After the chicken was cooked, removed it from pot and added cornstarch to thicken, just a bit... 
Smash hit over rice.

Such a great and easy recipe. I had chicken breasts in the fridge so I used them instead. Paired with fried potatoes and used the extra sauce to cover them. Will make this again.

I cooked in a 400 degree oven for 40 mins instead of using the slow cooker due to it being too late in the day to use my slow cooker, and I really wanted some honey garlic chicken. It turned out great!

It's a nice everyday recipe that goes well with rice and a vegetable. I've made it several times. I don't usually have any basil and it tastes just fine. The sauce is a bit thin, so as others have suggested, I like to add some cornstarch to the sauce mix before I pour it over the chicken. Also, I've used different pieces of chicken, sometimes thighs, sometimes breasts.

Absolutely loved this dish!   So easy to make and it looks and tastes like it took much longer.  Someone else commented they were disapointed, but I've made this a few times and really like it.

I made it according to the recipe, but my husband and I found the taste odd. I really don't know how to describe the flavor, but I didn't like it at all, and he will eat anything but doesn't want me to make it again.

I would give this 5 stars for flavor. Minus 1 star because 6 hours was way too long cooking time causing the meat to dry out. Lots of sauce. Did not do it today but next time I would be tempted to do what others suggested and that is to thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry after the meat is cooked.

Very easy and tasty. I put it in the pressure cooker on high for 11 minutes (12 if frozen), and it comes out great.

It was delicious! So tender, even on slow cooker high for 3 hours. Used 9 chicken thighs and there was still almost too much sauce. Might reduce it next time.

First time with this recipe I thought it was too salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce.  Aside from the saltiness it was  an okay will try again.

Super easy and the sauce was yummy. The skins were slimy but tasted good.  I might stick them under the broiler for a minute next time.

Smelled amazing.  Tip, if you run out of soy sauce like I did, worechester sauce works as well. Use big thighs. I had small thighs and mine were done cooking in 3:45 hrs on low.

I made this just as the recipe called for in ingredients but due to time constraints put this all in my pressure cooker for 15 minutes on low pressure letting pressure drop slowly .  My picky grandkids loved it over rice with broccoli as a veggie.

Easy to make any my family loved it. Will definitely make again. I broiled the chicken to crisp it up a little while I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch in a sauce pan for a couple minutes.

We've made the version of this recipe that was featured in one of their magazines and it was for 8 chicken breasts. The ingredient amounts were a little different - 2/3 cup soy sauce, 2/3 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup honey, 4 cloves garlic, 1 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper; put the chicken in a plastic bag, pour the sauce mix in, massage the bag and let sit for at least an hour in the fridge, then grill them. Best grilled chicken I've ever had. I recommend using all the sauce in the bag, just get a rubber brush and brush it on while it's on the grill.

I used 8 chicken thighs as was done in the video. Followed the recipe exactly. Ended up with a watery cooked chicken dish that had so much sodium in it that the rice I added to it afterwards still couldn't make it palatable. Nothing like the photo or video even remotely!

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this came out tasting like a basic BBQ sauce. I had in the crock pot longer than the recipe calls for (nearly 10 hours) so the meat was infused with flavor, but the meat was a bit dry. Rather than thicken the sauce, we used it "au jus style", dipping the meat. It was tasty, but my next time will be on a day when I'm staying home and can limit the cooking time.

I made this in my 6qt oval crockpot. The only changes I made were using 6 thighs and low sodium tamari in place of soy sauce because that’s what I had. I cooked it for 6 hours on low as directed then left it on warm for about an hour until we were ready to eat. This is so quick to throw together and was delicious and tender! We had enough sauce that I could have easily used 4 more thighs if I wanted. I will definitely make this again!

These were ok. The flavor wasn’t as impactful as I thought it would be.  And the sauce was super thin. I’ll make then again because they did taste good over rice and broccoli.

It was easy for a very busy mom. While cleaning house I put it in the oven to cook. The kids came in asking if we were having Chinese for dinner. Put it with some fried rice. Super easy inexpensive Chinese dinner.

I was looking for a quick recipe and this fit the bill. I tripled the recipe for our family of 7 (only doubled the sauce, but added extra seasoning) and used a 6qt slow cooker. The meat was tender in four hours on high. The sauce was more watery than I expected or preferred, but maybe some of that was due to the extra meat...?? Nevertheless, it was very tasty served over white rice with a side of Asian cole slaw and fresh, crusty, homemade bread, and my family loved it!

I followed the recipe as written but doubled the sauce and did not cook as long, about 4 hours in my slow cooker.  The sauce took on a burnt smell and the taste also.  I think maybe a store bought barbecue sauce is what I will try next time.

These were pretty great. I didn’t have fresh garlic so I used powdered garlic. (Don’t ask how much. I just poured lol). I didn’t have a slow cooker and wasn’t about to wait 6 hours. So I put it in the oven, covered it on top with foil and cooked it for about an hour. It tasted great.

Make this about once a week now. Its perfect! I make a side of cauliflower rice or regular rice and mix extra thigh sauce into it on my plate. I use 6 big chicken thighs instead of 4 so theres leftovers and it comes out amazing each time. I use fresh basil instead of dried otherwise I dont change a thing with the sauce directions! I also take the chicken thighs out at the end and add a bit of cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.

Never will I make this recipe again. The chicken dried out; the flavors fought each other, and we struggled to eat one thigh. FAIL! You would think with so many reviews it was something you could work with. Wrong! Now I understand why so many reviews had to  drastically alter the "recipe". Do yourself a favor and select another tested recipe before you waste all the ingredients like I just did.

Can't beat the ease of this recipe. Either reduce the sauce amount or add extra chicken since there is plenty. I slow cooked it for 8 hours and added onion and chopped pepper for the last 2 hours, then served over jasmine rice.

Considering the title includes honey and garlic I expected those to be the dominant flavors. Especially since i used twice as much garlic as called for. Or, after reading the reviews maybe a poor excuse for teriyaki. Instead, the predominant flavor was ketchup. I guess if you have kids it might make a good family meal but overall I'm counting this as a recipe fail.

Used only sugar free ingredients, a honey substitute, a sugar free barbecue sauce, braggs liquid aminos (soy  sauce sub),  and grilled. Would have  been better if I had saved some of the sauce (not as a brush-o on the grill) to use as a sauce. If I didn't substitute, I couldn't use even a fraction of the recipes on the site.

This is actually a great and very simple recipe. I've changed a few things up over time, but the basic premise is spot on. Like many, I upped the number of thighs as the BS thighs shrink to nothing, so for a family of 4 (3 men) I use 12. In the past I've subbed chili sauce (the one in that cute glass jar) for the ketchup, and I have some habanero honey I'll use when I make it again tonight. I make a coconut jasmine rice (recipe somewhere here on AR), and I tell you, my men eat like they've never seen food. Makes me happy. I think I'll toss in a bunch of green beans and snap peas toward the end this time, too. 4 hours on high, 6-8 hours on low. Voila!

I was not swept off my feet by this recipe.  Around the 3rd hour I noticed a "done" smell in the kitchen, so I checked the temp of the meat and it was done, in the verge of being overcooked. I can't believe the recipe called for 6 hours on low. No way! Or perhaps my slow coroner's low temperature is higher than normal. At any rate, I think this might have turned out better had the chicken soaked in the mixture for 30 minutes or longer to absorb the flavors.

This was delicious. Served with roasted caulifower. Browning the chicken is essential, though. It keeps the juices in the individual pieces so that it doesn't melt into mush in the crockpot.

Its very tasty but reduce the cooking time. Going the full six hours seriously dries out the meat, even while submerged. I did this again yesterday with 10 boneless/skinless for 5 hours and were at 190 degrees after hour 4 on low. Had to turn it down to warm to time the rest of the meal. Tip:  use reduced sodium soy sauce. SO much tastier.

I used 10 pcs of chicken thighs (bone-in) with the same amount of sauce ingredients from the recipe. Still turned out saucy enough to drizzle over Jasmine rice. Easy to make. Delicious!

I added barbecue sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's), a tiny bit of salad dressing, some sugar, and cut down the soy sauce amount. I was a bit skeptical at first,  but when it came out of the crock pot it was delicious, and everyone loved it! The reason I dropped a star is because I really only roughly stuck to the recipe, and mostly followed advice from the comments, and also tried a few of my own things. I also didn't have any garlic or basil-- so in reality my dish came out quite different than most will.

2nd attempt:  I doubled the sauce for these, and I used drumsticks since that is what I had.  I might have only used half the ketchup, but whatever changed, I had two moms ask me for the recipe.

1st attempt: Too strong of ketchup taste.  I would eliminate or drastically reduce the amount of ketchup if I made these again.

I like this website so much that I ordered the magazine and will soon renew.

I do have a problem.  I tried to find the "honey-garlic Chicken Thighs" by Myrna in the june/july magazine on line and was unable to find it.  

Also it might be nice to be able to look up recipes by cook

6 hours is way too long to cook these thighs. I stopped the cooking at 4 hours low, otherwise you get dried out shreds of chicken. Good taste, though.

I followed the recipe as written, but my family found it to be rather bland.  Something seems to be missing but am not sure exactly what.  Perhaps a pinch of red pepper flakes might do it...

This is a very good recipe.  I followed the directions exactly.  I served with brown rice and pea pods.  When I took left overs to work, one of my co-workers was ogling my dish and saying, "That looks so good, where did you get that?"  When I told her I had made it in the crock pot, she said, "Who cooks like that?"  Gave her the recipe and sent her on her way!

I marinade my chicken, both thighs and breast, with this for as little as 20 min or as long as 12 hours before grilling my chicken. Always comes out great! This is a family favorite and made multiple times over the summer.

WOW!! This was AMAZING! And it is sooooo simple. I did a couple of adjustments; used 4 bone-in thighs w/skin, only added 1/4 c. ketchup, 4 cloves garlic and ground pepper. I only cooked it about 3 hours, I may have a hotter "low" setting. Was SO good and my roommate LOVED it!! We served over rice. :)

Easy and delicious. I’ve made it with chicken, but tonight I tried pork chops! I think it’s better. Bone in. I just browned them quickly with some garlic powder, salt and pepper sprinkled on.

I always ease up on garlic. I am so old I consider the modern day love affair with garlic to be aberrant. If you read pre 1980 cook books garlic is rarely mentioned except in Italian recipes. This is such an easy recipe and a little of the sauce with rice as a side dish is good as well. Our salad came from our garden - great easy meal.

I'd say this is "just okay". A bit tasteless and I hard a hard time getting the sauce to thicken enough. I did 5 chicken breasts and cooked it on low for 4 hours. It was a bit overdone.

My husband loved it, and I liked it fairly ok. I didn’t see the bad reviews until it was already marinading in my fridge to dump in the crock pot the next day, so it was with trepidation that I took my first bite. It tasted alright, definitely palatable. I had doubled everything (chicken and marinade). It was a bit salty but not horrible. Definitely not the pinnacle of fine cuisine or anything, but I was exhausted and needed a super easy crock pot recipe for dinner and this fit the bill. I cooked it 4 and a half hours on low at the suggestions of others and the meat was super tender. Next time I’m this low on energy I might make it again.

It tasted good, but the flavor was very strong and salty. I could only have one or two pieces before I found the flavor to be overwhelming. The sauce was too strong to use, don't just pour it straight over your rice without tasting it.

Made this for a big family dinner, everyone loved it!  Even the finicky kids.  We doubled the sauce and used 12 bone-in thights, no leftovers.  Went perfectly with rice and oven roasted rainbow carrots.

Made this following recipe exactly.  I had 8 chicken thighs, but increased the sauce by just 1 1/2, and there was plenty.  I served with brown rice and roasted Brussels sprouts.  It’s a keeper!  Thanks for an easy and tasty dinner option

This recipe turned out incredible, and it was so easy.  I used low sodium soy sauce and reduced the cooking time to 4 hours.  The chicken is sweet and saucy, and it reheats well.  Definitely a new favorite.

REDUCE COOKING TIME...

Was far from what we expected.  We followed the recipe
exactly and the chicken was dry.  The sauce wasn't thick and it had ok flavor.  Not sure what needs to be done to fix this recipe.  Don't think I will be making this again...  extremely dry..

I have made this recipe many times over the last several years. It is one of my husbands favorites. The only change I make is I cut the soy sauce back to 1/4 cup when using regular soy sauce and I add a few whole garlic cloves into the crock pot as well.  Sometimes I'll throw in a couple quartered vidallia onions. I've made it with thighs, quarters, even whole chicken. It's also good with rabbit as well, but watch for bones. If using bone in chicken the meat falls off the bones. Delicious recipe!

Awesome recipe used red onions, a gang of garlic and used a dozen chicken wings to coat the bottom with 6 thighs on top slow cooked for 6 hrs and all turned out excellent!

This was the first time I made it and I followed the directions.  I did add more honey than it called for though because the soy sauce would be overpowering.  We all liked it but I cooked it for 6 hours on low and it dried it out.  So next time I won't cook it as long.

Easy, simple recipe! I read the other reviews and used 8 chicken thighs instead of 4. There was more than enough sauce ;). My family approves !

This was a nice change from the usual chicken dishes. It had a delicious asian aroma and taste. I added fresh carrots and string beans. I will definitely make it again!

Tried this for the first time tonight - not sure what exactly it was that we didn't like, but we had to throw away, couldn't eat it. Thinking the combination of everything with the ketchup just was not good for us.

Very good recipe.  Only change I made was making rice noodles and broccoli and put the chicken and sauce over the noodle mixture. Will make again and again.

I made this to use up some chicken thighs  I had frozen. Since my wife doesn't like dark  meat I was worried that she would not like it. She actually loved it! I was shocked! 
The only  thing I would do differently is to be a little lighter on the soy sauce for my taste.  I made stir fried rice with it so maybe the soy sauce in the rice is why it seemed a little heavy on the soy sauce. I will make it again maybe over white rice.

Easy, minimal ingredients, budget friendly, flavorful.  What's not to like.  Based on another review, I tossed in a bit of chopped onion I had in the freezer and some red pepper flakes because I like spicy things.  Used 8 boneless/skinless thighs since someone mentioned freezing (and I love things I can freeze to make a busy weeknight easy).  Had lots of sauce, served over white rice - what I had on hand.  The only "complaint" I might have is my thighs fell apart. And they were huge!  I would prefer they remain intact if serving to company, but hey!  That's not much of a complaint, is it?

Made this last night .  Followed the recipe to the letter, but my glaze turned out to way to thin.  The only thing I can think of is that the chicken juice thinned it out.   I gave it a 5 stars , because the flavor was incredible.   The chicken turned out so flavorful and so very moist we actually could cut it with a fork with no problems.   Definitely will make again.

This will be a regular dish for us.  It can be made in the oven at 425 for 30 min in a cassarole dish with the lid on. Skinless boneless breast works just as well.

made for dinner tonight with some rice and fresh green beans. family enjoyed it. very easy. next time I will either substitute the ketchup or use less and there is a heavy ketchup flavor that could be taking away from garlic and honey...thanks for great easy recipe.

I loved this recipe!  The only change I made was to use chicken thighs with skin on and with bone in.  I just prefer them that way.  For that reason, I cooked a little longer.  They came out tender, juicy and totally delicious.  I served with ginger infused sticky rice,  roasted asparagus and an Asian style simple salad.  DELICIOUS!

I cooked 6 thighs for 5 hours and they were overdone. Good flavor and will try again with less cooking time, like 4 1/2 hours maximum.

I like this recipe a lot. I have made it twice. Didn't really make any adjustments. My only tip would be to watch out for the time. I did it on low for 4.5-5 hours instead of 6 and it turned out great. I guess this also depends on your crock pot. Enjoy!

I made the recipe as directed. My husband normally doesn't like to eat poultry with it cooked in honey or any other sweetner - but he gobbled this up.  I just didn't tell him I used honey!!  It was great - I loved it and so did he.  I served the sauce over mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.

My picky eaters all loved it and my husband had 3 pieces!  The only changes I made were to use 12 bone-in chicken thighs (there was still plenty of sauce) and add 2T of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and it was delish!

Use low sodium soy sauce
Add 1/2 cup OJ
1 can tomato paste...

and most importantly Seer the chicken thighs before putting them in the sauce/crockpot.

YUMMY!  Fell off the bone, juicy throughout.  I used the low sodium soy sauce and 2/3's of what the recipe called for.  I heated it up again in a pyrex dish covered with foil in the oven at 350degrees the next day.  STILL YUMMY

I love this one, though I tend to cook the chicken in the oven for an hour at 375 versus using the slow cooker. Also like to let the chicken marinade for at least an hour, ideally two hours.

started with original recipe and used low salt soya.  Added half a large sliced onion and some red and yellow peppers in a large dice.  Also added some chilies with 2 T. of molasses. a T of brown sugar, 1 T Wooster,used only half ketchup and the other half barbecue sauce and after cooking poured the sauce in a pot and thickened it with a slurry.  Turned out great.  Everyone enjoyed it with the changes for our taste. Don't use crockpot that often but I will use this again.

Way too salty. I will reduce the soy sauce by half next time. And chicken was overcooked. Reduce the cook time by half also and it should be perfect. It was easy and inexpensive. Worth giving it another try.

In my opinion, if I make this again, I will add a little more garlic and thicken up the sauce a bit so that it coats the chicken, rather than the thighs just sitting in the sauce.  Also, I think marinating the thighs overnight will add a little more flavor to them.

I will say this, it does not need to cook for 6 hours on low. Four hours will do the trick. It over cooked and dried out my chicken. The sauce had a little bit of a burnt taste to it.  Trial and error. Next time I know what to tweak.

I was sick, so set this up in the crockpot and started the rice cooker up for my husband. He raved about it, absolutely loved it! (And told me he gave it 5 stars.) So easy to make and the sauce makes for a non-boring chicken that is moist and tender. I used regular thighs with skin and bone, so cooked on high the first 30-40 minutes, then low for 5 hours and the meat was falling off the bone. Will definitely make again.

Delicious. After they cooked in the slow cooker I placed them in a glass pan and broiled them in the oven to given in some crispy  pieces on the top and give it a better look.

I jazzed it up a little by adding grated fresh ginger and about 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  Other than that, I didn't change anything.  It was superb.  Served with basmati rice and fresh kale.  Yum!

I found this recipe on another site and made it for the first time this week.  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.   My recipe called for low sodium soy sauce  and fresh, chopped parsley instead of basil (which I don't like!).  I toasted the sesame seeds in a small skillet and served it with green beans and rice.  Delicious and was better the next day!

YUM!! These were wonderful! I used 6 thighs but the same amount of sauce (I used reduced sodium soy sauce). I cooked them on high for 1 hour and on low for 2 more. I'm definitely going to make these again.

Hubby liked this well enough so giving it one star more than I would have if speaking for just me.  I couldn't eat it.  Chicken was way overcooked and the sauce was way too strong.  Just didn't like it. But as I said, hubby ate for both of us so giving it 3 stars. Will not repeat.

This was incredibly salty, despite having used low sodium soy sauce.  Flavor was one dimensional (boring).  Despite having values of never throwing away food, we couldn't eat the leftovers.

I made this as written, but with skin on, bone in (that’s what was on sale). It came out very tasty, and my hubby even said I should write this review with five stars. Add to that the ease of putting this together, and I’ll definitely keep this in our rotation.

This was an easy recipe to throw in the slow cooker. In the end I did finished it off under broiler for 10 to 15 minutes to crisp up skin. I drained the fat off the sauce before I thicken it with corn starch. This is something I would make again using chicken thighs.

Thought it was really good and will probably make it again with a few tweaks.    All four kids ate it which is saying something, but none of them loved it.    Only thing I change dis added two more thighs since we are a bigger family, so I made extra sauce which I didn't really need.    I  transferred the sauce to a pan and thickened with corn starch.

Easy to make & everyone likes it. I’ve made it several times. The recipe is very similar to my friend’s Sunshine Chicken recipe which she first marinates for a couple of hours, adding 1/4 cup of oil to the sauce ingredients, & bakes at 350° for 45 minutes.
 The baked chicken has a slightly different texture  but is equally good. I use dried basil & low salt  soy sauce. Served it over quick cooking brown rice. Added sheet pan oven roasted broccoli florets. Instead of salad, I put out a plate of raw cut-up veggies, carrots, celery, etc. — whatever was handy in the frig.

Good flavors.  Easy preparation.  Like others, I used more chicken than the recipe listed: 5 thighs and 5 breast strips.  Plenty of sauce which I thickened. Served with rice. Next time I'll add vegetables at the end of the cook time as other reviewers suggested.  Broccoli or green/red peppers and onions would work with the flavor profile which I can't quite put my finger on; is it Asian or barbecue?  At any rate, it was good.  Thank you for sharing!

This was horrible.  Too salty, not enough sweetness to the sauce, it was very unbalanced.  I have a heap left over to "doctor" into something else.  Won't be making it again.

Awesome flavor for a recipe that’s basically ketchup and soy sauce and takes 5-10 minutes of prep time. It makes a really delicious sauce that tastes like a teriyaki sauce. I cooked it on low with frozen, boneless, skinless thighs for 4 hours and it turned out great. I used reduced sodium soy sauce. Definitely going to make it again!

If you double the “sauce” you can make about 3 pounds of (boneless/skinless) chicken. I like to combine thighs and breasts. Add some ginger and a tablespoon of brown sugar. I (break up and) throw in the chicken FROZEN. Cook on LOW for four hours. Then, remove the chicken (I like to break it into smaller pieces) and crank up your crock pot to HIGH. Sprinkle and whisk in some flour (just a little at a time so it’s not lumpy). Add the chicken back in... yum! Great recipe!

I used 4 bone-in chicken thighs then removed the skin & bones and shredded the meat.  Also added 1 onion chopped, 1 bell pepper chopped and 1 can crush pineapple 1 hour before it was finished.  Served over oven baked brown rice and garnished with sesame seeds.  Super!

I just made this today and It was quick and easy. It came out delicious and I'll definitely make this time and again. I followed the recipe as written and I  just added a little Sriracha sauce for a little added heat. Don't hesitate to make this recipe!

I liked this dish but my husband did not.  I checked the crockpot at 5 hours and it was very done...probably only needs 4 hours on low to cook.

I did not feed this to my family after I tried it myself straight out of the slow cooker. There was no honey/garlic flavor at all; the sauce tasted like a steak/meatloaf type sauce. It worked terribly with the chicken thighs. I used low sodium soy sauce too, and followed the directions to a tee. Would not make again. Very confused by the positive reviews...

I added sauteed peppers and onions minced garlic a little bit of Pineapple and some lemon juice. This is the second time I made it and it turns out very well every time I made sure to use the low sodium soy sauce.

The recipe looked really good, but I may have over cooked it. It was a bit dry for my taste, but the sauce was really good. My family said it was really good and it was a keeper recipe.

We traditionally get Chinese take-out for Christmas Eve dinner, but this year I opted to cook, and this turned out to be a Tasty dish! The sauce initially tasted too salty, so I added more honey and some brown sugar to cut it (I also added some red pepper flakes to give a little kick). When it was close to finished I added red onions, bell pepper and pineapple.  When it was done I thickened the sauce on the stove with cornstarch - served over Jasmati Rice...DELISH! Thanks!

This is a good base recipe but needed some add ins for better flavor and texture. I used 8 boneless skinless thighs and started with half the amount of soy sauce listed and then added a bit more at the end. The amount needed could vary quite a bit depending on what brand you have on hand. Lachoy or kikoman are gonna taste like salt bombs compared to some other brands. I added garlic powder, a drizzle of sesame oil,  1/4 tsp of Chinese 5 spice, some diced onion,  about 1/4 cup brown sugar  and a couple heaping Tbsps of chilli garlic sauce. Mixed well so chicken was coated then sprinkled a Tbs of  cornstarch over everything and mixed well again. If you bought your crockpot after the 90s it will cook much hotter on low so either cut your cook time back to 3 1/2 HOURS  (checking at 3) or set it at warm to cook. Mine comes to a simmer at warm.

The recipe looked delicious. As I was preparing it, I was so excited to taste the scrumptious looking chicken.

When it was cooking, I could only smell the overpowering soy sauce mixed with the Ketchup.

When it finally came out of the pot, I was disgusted. What met my eyes was black looking logs that looked like brownies. It tasted even worse. 

My mother who has cooked Taiwanese meals for generations, told me that soy sauce is generally used with tablespoons and not cups, as that is way too much sodium. 

I will give this recipe again, but instead of the enormous amount of sodium, I will try less of everything (except the chicken of course)

Great and simple. Substituted chicken breast for thighs to make it healthier. I used less soy sauce to avoid making it too salty. Added some sirrahchi for a little mild heat. The results were marvelous!

This was delish!  I was at work so my chicken cooked a little bit longer than it should of, but it was still delicious. I used chicken breast, but followed the recipe exactly - the sauce is great.  I paired with plain brown rice, green onion garnish and the Buttered Parmesan Brussels Sprouts from the recipe of that same name.  I will def. make this again.  May try a different protein like beef or tofu next time.

I'd use half the amount of ketchup next time and call it perfectly delicious!

Really easy and tasty. In my slow cooker I think less than 6 hours works better.

Really good dish for very little work or ingredients! Used 1/2 low sodium and 1/2 reg soy sauce. Next time will go with all low sodium. I do think all regular soy sauce would be way too salty. Sauce did not "glaze" but I thickened with corn starch and served over Jasmine rice. Will most definitely go into "The Folder"!

A New Favorite!! My family and I practically licked our plates clean. Added potatoes and carrots to the chicken in the Crockpot to make a complete meal. Also did not have dried basil to add. So incredibly yummy! Looking forward to making it again!

Very easy and tasty.  I've added 2-3 more thighs and used a 3-quart slow cooker.  Made it twice.

I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs which resulted in a greasy sauce. Very tasty all the same. Next time I will use skinless!

I doubled the amount of chicken thighs to 8 but kept the sauce ingredients the same per the advice of other reviews. I found it to be very good and easy, but too salty. I am making this again but cutting the soy sauce in half (I use tamari) and adding 1/4 of vegetable stock.

I, too, feared this would be too salty from the amount of soy sauce, but was proven wrong!
I was definitely drawn in by the apparent ease of the recipe, and the flavors blended wonderfully. I went with from-frozen, boneless, skinless thighs (wish I had put in MORE!) and left the recipe basically unchanged. I added only a little dried chopped onions instead of the green (just to hide from my very picky household,)  and used pre-minced garlic rather than chopping whole cloves.

I shortened the time by cooking on high for 2 hours, then low for a little less than one additional. That gave me time to prepare the accompanying  Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes (from this site.)
I also thickened the remaining liquid with a cornstarch slurry, and have much sauce/glaze remaining. With the wonderful flavor profile, I WILL be using it again soon. It would be great over plain white rice, as flavor, but I had prepared cheesy rice for this meal.

Thank you for sharing, thumbs up from us!

I followed the recipe exactly. After 5 hours on low in the crockpot (recipe says 6) the chicken was already over cooked and very dry.  The sauce never turned to a glaze. It just got soupy. And when we went to eat it, we found it way too salty. (And I love salt!)  We overall didn’t care for this and I’m not sure what I could do to improve it so I won’t make it again.

6 hours on low was WAY too long in my crockpot. Chicken was totally overlooked and tastes almost burned. There was no salvaging them, had to throw it all out. Maybe cut the time in half? Not really sure what I did wrong but I am open to suggestions. Looks great in the pics!

Very easy and delicious.  I served with a side of brown rice and a salad.  I remover the chicken and added 2 T of cornstarch mixed with water to the sauce (after the chicken cooked) to make a thicker sauce.  Will be making again and maybe swap the honey for orange juice and add ginger. But the recipe is great as is.

Love this.  The cornstarch slurry definitely helped.  I added some red pepper flakes for the sweet/hot dynamic.  I think I am going to throw in some mushrooms next time.

Made this in a 7 quart slow cooker with like 8 chicken thighs on high for 3 1/2 hours. Added ginger, chili powder, turmeric, and some black pepper because one of my girls has come down with an upper respiratory virus and thought why not. And this was DELICIOUS! Everyone loved it! Served it with beef flavored rice and a blend of cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots since that is what I had on hand. Favorited this because it was so good!

Easy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe and set  the slow cooker on simmer for 8 hours and it was perfect!  A home run with adults and kids.  I used the liquid as sauce served over rice.  Added benefit is that it's healthy with not a lot of calories.  Definitely will make again!

My Sister in law is deployed for a month and I get the pleasure of cooking for my brother and the kids. My brother called and said, "So you think you can cook, that was delicious" I made the following changes based on reviews.
Added water in the bottom of crockpot
Used Low sodium soy sauce
Cooked on low for 4 hours
I am 2 for 2. I made the  jamaican curry chicken for them the night before. My sister had taken out some thighs before she left, therefore I had to come up with ways to cook them. They loved both recipes. I love this site

The chicken cooked really well. But we hated the sauce! Weird since we love all these items separately. Maybe since it was a ketchup based sauce....my husband is not a picky eater and he scraped off all the sauce to just eat the chicken and sides :-( fail.

5 stars for being super fast & easy and calling for all things I had in the house already.  I added lots of broccoli the last 45 minutes or so and this was an outstanding addition even without doubling the sauce!  We served with rice.  Good but it seemed to missing something to take it to a full 5 stars. I'm tempted to make again with chicken breasts to health it up a bit.

Made with 10 boneless thighs and added 1 teaspoon dried oregano, some pepper flakes, extra garlic and some dry onion flakes.  Also removed the thighs at the end of cooking and thickened the sauce with some corn starch and put the thighs back for 15 min, turning the crock-pot on high. I used low sodium Soy Sauce as well. 
Cooked on high for 20 min, then turned to low for 4 1/2 hours before removing thighs and thickening sauce. Meat was very tender, falling apart. 

I actually thought it was a little under-seasoned, so next time will rub the thighs with kosher salt and pepper before cooking, and some extra pepper flakes and increase the dry onion and maybe add some ground ginger,  but overall it was tasty. Paired the meat with white rice and roasted garlic green and white beans, and baby carrots.

I made a few changes to mine, combined two recipes into one. I added minced ginger to the sauce and a pinch of red pepper flake. Served over quinoa boiled in low sodium chicken broth and low-sodium soy sauce. Will make again and again.

Excellent. The only change I would make would be to use reduced sodium soy sauce the next time. It was a little too salty for my taste.

This recipe was delicious!!! I used 6 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, seared first and then set in the slow-cooker on HIGH for 5 hours. I didn't have ketchup so I sub'd 1/2 cup tomato sauce, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 Tbsp white vinegar. Perfect Sunday hands-off dinner! Will definitely be making again!

I reduced the ketchup and soy sauce slightly and added a cup of water because others said it was so salty or tasted like ketchup. I think a half of cup of water would work better. I also used 6 cloves of garlic. Served it over Jasmine rice after I thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Was very tasty. Would make it again.

I added toasted sesame seeds to it, and cooked it in the oven, using breasts. Any cut of meat is great! I slice my chicken up into strips so that the flavor covers more square inch of the meat. Enjoyed it!

well, since hubby expressed how much he liked it twice while eating, I'll give this 5 stars.  Also 5 stars for ease.  I added the ketchup, honey, (2x) garlic and soy in glass measuring cup and poured over the thighs in the crock pot.  Viola.  Done and done. The last hour of cooking I put in some sliced onions.  When we were about 15 mins from eating I took the chicken out and turned the crock pot on high and added a slurry of pineapple juice and cornstarch.  The sauce thickened up quite nicely.  Served with green beans and quinoa.  Will make again.   Thanks for the post!

This was a very good change for us since we have chicken quite often. My family loved it as there were no leftovers to warm up the next day!

This was super easy and super tasty!
I browned the chicken first in a little butter and olive oil before transferring it to the slow cooker.
I also added thin sliced yellow onions, about teaspoon of red chilli flakes,  maybe a teaspoon of white pepper and the juice from half a lemon to the soy/ketchup marinade. I poured most of the marinade over the chicken and then used the remaining marinade and about 1/4 cup of water to deglaze the pan I browned the chicken in. Then poured the pan drippings into the stock pot.
It was so delicious served over rice. Next time, I will serve it over garlic fried rice!

As a lifelong vegetarian who is just starting to learn how to cook meat, I appreciated how simple this recipe was!

The sauce seemed excessive, so you could probably either reduce the sauce quantity or significantly increase the chicken quantity. It felt wasteful pouring out all the sauce at the end, so you could also follow the suggestions of some other reviewers and thicken it with cornstarch or something.

I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce was very thin.  I used 6 fresh boneless chicken thighs so not sure what happened.  Toward the end I added crushed red pepper, sliced red and green pepper as well as onion.  I tried to thicken the sauce with cornstarch but not much luck probably would have had to take it out of the crock pot and simmered on the stovetop.  I ended up serving it with sautéed broccoli and garlic over lo mien noodles.  Flavor was what you would expect from the ingredients but nothing really to write home about.

This was pretty good, but not great. 6 hours was WAY too long. If I were to make it again, I would definitely check after 4 hours. My daughter loved the sauce - on rice. It wasn't the best or the worst thing I've made, but it was overcooked by following the cooking guidance.

Instead of thighs, I used chicken breast. Other then that, I didn't change anything about the recipe. It was good but I feel that it needs a little
Something extra. I might add pineapple to it next time as another person suggests. I'll def be making this again though... perhaps with pork

I didn't really care for the flavor--ketchup and soy sauce don't quite go together.  It was okay, but I don't think my family will ask me to make it again.  I used 5 chicken breasts and there
was plenty of sauce--too much and I ended up dumping it down the drain.  If the flavor would have been more favorable I would have served it with the rice I made.  If the sauce was toned down with some broth or something it may have been better.  On the up side, the meat was nice and tender, thanks to the slow-cooker recipe.

This is delicious and easy!  We make it on a regular basis.  I use the left over chicken in my green salads for lunch.  One change I made recently was to add less ketchup 1/8 cup and added in some orange juice.  Super yummy!!!

This was an easy recipe to use as a starting point. I added an onion small bag of peeled carrots and a can of water chestnuts to the chicken before pouring the sauce over it. I also doubled the recipe but used only 1/2  a cup of honey instead of 2/3, as would have been required if I had doubled the honey as well. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch by making a slurry with 3 TBSPs cornstarch and 6 TBSP water and mixing that in for the last 15 minutes of cooking. I put the crock pot back up to high for those 15 minutes.

Made this last night and the family loved it.  It was super easy and I had all the ingredients on hand, except the chicken.  I did use the low-sodium soy sauce because that is what I always buy.  I think the regular soy sauce is too salty and that may be why some reviewer said that it was too salty.  At the end, I removed the chicken and added a cornstarch slurry to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.  Served it with brown rice and steamed veggies and poured the sauce over the chicken and rice.  So good!

I generally follow a recipe precisely the first time I make it and did so this time, even though I thought it had way too much soy sauce in it.  I was right - it was way too much soy sauce!  In addition, the sauce did not cook down into a "glaze" on the chicken but instead produced a lot of liquid.  I removed the chicken when it was about done, put it in the oven with a little of the sauce to keep it from drying out and then reduced the sauce on the stove top for at least half an hour.  It was still not thick enough to be called a glaze.  My husband requested that I not make this again and wasn't particularly interested in eating the left-overs.  I doubt I'd even try altering the recipe to make this one a second time.

This was such a quick and easy recipe! I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the basil and it turned out great. I also put in an extra thigh.  My crock pot runs hot so the chicken was done in 5 hours.  I will definitely make it again.

Based on some other reviews, I thought I'd give it a little zing with a few drops of Tabasco.  I don't know if that was the problem, but I expected the dish to be sweeter.  I also added some green peppers and onions.  My husband liked it, though.

Delicious! I kept the sauce ingredients as describeb but I used 6 bone-in thighs with the skin and cooked it in a 7 quart oval crock pot on low for 6 hours. These were cooked perfectly. The meat just fell off the bones.
I strained the sauce and sprinkled  the strained out minced garlic  over the chicken. I then used some of the separated grease from the strained sauce and some flour to make a rue. Then used the rue to thicken the sauce to gravy constincy.  I served it with steamed rice and fresh steamed broccoli.
This was delicous the first day but it did not re-heat vey well the next day.

Chicken was tender, everything else was terrible. TO MUCH SOY. If I dare make this again I will cut soy to at least half. I could not taste the honey or the garlic. It was almost inedible.

I read reviews and decided to cook less than time stated. Maybe took only 3.5  - 4 hrs cooking time, on low. Just make sure you check on it. I also used thighs with bones, that's how I noticed it was done, meat falling off the bones.

Came out moist and perfectly tasting. I added more thighs and couple of breasts. Everything else stayed the same. Paired with steamed white rice and sautéed sugar snap peas.

Prepared this exactly as directed and the chicken was so dried out that it was inedible. The sauce was good, but  6 hours was way too long.

This was very good & so easy. Think next time, might let the chicken marinate in the mixture for a while, maybe overnight. All & all, very good!

This was yummy and I was able to make it with pantry items I always have. I used 3 packages (of the 6 package bag) of CostCo chicken thighs which would be about 10 thighs. I decided to double the sauce and I could have gotten away with not doing so. My crockpot tends to run hot and I set the timer for 6 hours on low but at 5 hours it was a little on the overdone side and next time I'll cook it for 4 1/2 instead. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was a hit!

My family loves this recipe. However, I prefer to use the natural & crunchy peanut butter than the smooth PB. I have a friend of mine that wanted to try them. Tragically, he is allergic to bananas, so, I substituted the bananas for natural unsweetened apple sauce. Ever since he raved for these pancakes.

I did not like this at all. I feel the cook time was far too long and the chicken was burnt and had an awful salty taste and the meat had a horrible texture. I won't be making this again.

Not a big fan. Followed recipe exactly but soy sauce seemed to dominate the flavor. I would also advise leaving the Basil out, it doesn't blend well with the rest of the ingredients.

I followed everything exactly and it turned my crock pot into a burnt mess. I have had it soaking for 3 days and may need to toss.  I think the sauce would have tasted lovely and would have done better on stove top for about 45 min.

Not a hit with my family. I should have gone with my gut feeling about ketchup being a major ingredient. I like salty things, but this was WAY too salty. I'm thinking that an oriental five-spice seasoning might have helped rather than basil as well. Not a recipe that I will use again.

Though the skin was soggy, the chicken was moist and tender, and the sauce was very good. Would have preferred the skin to be a little crispy, but otherwise had a great flavor!

Used chicken breasts and cooked on high for two hours.  The sauce never really thickened up, probably because I didn't cook it as long as the recipe calls for.  Made a slurry with corn starch (1 tsp) and that helped.

It came out pretty salty, so next time I'd use low sodium soy sauce or less of it, and I'd add sesame seeds at the end.

This recipe was so easy to make.  The chicken was falling apart and juicy.  The sauce was great over everything.  The chicken was served with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  I used chicken with bones and skin, and I put in a few extra cloves of garlic.  I will make this again.  It was delicious. Thanks.

Turned out great! Added a little bit of chilli flakes and used chicken breast. Cooked it for a little longer because of the thickness of the breast but it turned out fall off the bone tender! Super easy

I would reduce the soy sauce and increase the honey and garlic.  It was a bit salty, even with low sodium soy sauce and didn't really get the honey or garlic flavor.

Chicken  was overcooked and had a bad flavor.  Did not care for it at all.   The only change I made was to exactly double the recipe since I needed more thighs.  Perhaps this was the problem.   I had to salvage the chicken by adding bbq sauce and making shredded BBQ chicken.   It was then edible.

The chicken cooked to tender pieces in about 4 1/2 hours on low heat.  I would definitely change the sauce, however, by reducing the 1/2 cup of ketchup to 1/4 cup—it was way too vinegary!  I also added sesame oil, crushed sesame seeds and a dash of soy sauce & ginger marinade to the sauce marinade before pouring it over the chicken.  It gave it a more Korean flavor. Next time, I would probably reduce the amount of sauce, too—there was  a lot of extra sauce. Overall, great & simple recipe!

This is a great sauce to cook with.  Instead of using a slow cooker I put the chicken and sauce in my Instant Pot for 8 min. at pressure and served as a rice bowl.

This was awesome. It's the first thing other than soup and chili I've cooked ina crockpot. Even my super picky eater liked it. I did make one adjustment. It says to cook on low for 6 hours. When I checked mine at 5 hours, it was falling apart so I turned it off then. There were some leftovers but it reheats well also

This was wonderful and soooo easy!  I used the same amounts listed, mixing in a bit of fresh basil with the dried. I only had thighs with bones and skins and they came out great-the meat fell off the bones once served and was divine.  I served it over white rice and there was plenty of sauce to scoop out of crock pot over the rice. This is for sure a family favorite now.

I loved this. After decades of cooking you run out of things you aren't sick of. This is so easy and flavourful I'm happy to add it to the rotation. We didn't find it too salty but I did add a small amount more of honey and spiced it up a bit with a sprinkling of red chili flakes. Super easy.
UPDATE: I think that being too salty depends on what type of soya sauce you use. They are not all the same. A good Chinese soya sauce tends to be less salty and thicker. The Japanese version is quite a bit saltier and watery.  That has been my experience.

The flavor was terrific, but the cooking time was way too long. I cooked it an hour less and the chicken was very dry.  Will make again!   Oh, and I used someone else's idea about adding cornstarch to make a thickened sauce--good.

I followed the recipe but had about 4 lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it worked out fine.  I was hoping it would be a little sweeter though.  Still it was good enough for the husband and kids to enjoy.  The sauce seemed to thicken by itself, so I didn't add any corn starch or anything.  I think I might just experiment with a little more sugar next time to make it a little sweeter though.  I served it with simple jasmine rice and garlic green beans.  Oh, and I did speed up the cooking by turning it on high in the last hour.  It was like 3 hours of slow cook time and 1 hour on high.

I like to try a recipe exactly as written the first time, so that is what I did.  I had more chicken thighs on hand than the recipe calls for (I had 8 smallish ones), but otherwise followed the sauce recipe exactly.  The chicken was well cooked in 5 hours on low.  The sauce was very watery/greasy, and so I removed some of the oil with the lettuce leaf method.  Then I cooked the sauce in a saucepan with a cornstarch slurry, and added red pepper flakes to give it a bit more punch.  It wasn't "fine-dining", but it was tasty.  I will make this again for my son, who loves dark meat chicken, because it is super-easy, and I like the fact that  you can just fix it and forget it.

I really wanted to like this. But it wasn't good. I made with 8 thighs and cooked 3.5 hours in crock pot and 20 minutes in the oven at 400. However, I don't think it would have been good no matter how I cooked it. It drives me crazy when people give it 5 stars but made 10 changes. So I was trying to make it just as the recipe states. but the sauce looked watery and the chicken looked plain. That's partly why I put it in the oven. In any event, it was very salty (and I love salt) and the flavor was mediocre at best.

Made just as recipe reads except I used low sodium everything and added a cap-top of Rice Vinegar to mixture.  I am a big rice vinegar fan.

This recipe is a huge hit in my house! I always make it with low sodium soy sauce (based on other reviews) and the one thing I do that isn't mentioned in the recipe is I make it a day or two ahead of time and let the chicken marinade in the sauce...After a day or two, I cook it in the crock pot as directed and it's absolutely delicious! I've made it a few times now and it's always a hit!

This one was awesome. I made 2 batches of sauce the second of which i added towards the end of cooking and because its a thon sauce and i wanted it thicker i added a bit of flour to the srcond sauce batch. I also used chicken breasts and shortened cooking time a bit. I didn't have basil so i thyme! Worked great, love this one.

This was a great start for the recipe, but I had to make a lot of changes.  First I reduced the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon and the ketchup to 1/4 cup.  I used 1 big spoon full of pre-minced garlic ( from a jar).  I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste. I omitted the dried basil because I din't have any . And I used 1/2 cup of honey ( I used Nature Nate's Raw &  Unfiltered Honey from Costco)  All said and done it came out great and my husband LOVED IT!  I will definitely make this again.

I am a novice cook. I absolutely love crockpot recipes. This was delish! I made some changes based on the comments- I used low sodium soy sausage and substituted BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. I cooked I on high for 2 1/2 hours on high. Received rave reviews!

I took other reviews suggestion to use lower salt soy sauce.  Before cooking the sauce it was very salty, but after cooking it was just right!  Th chicken was dry, so next time I'll check the chicken after being on low for 2 1/2 hrs.  To add more Asian taste,  I added 5 spice powder.   I served it with brown rice and also broccoli.

The smell walking in the house from work was amazing. The taste, not so much! I followed the directions and the end result was yuck as my daughter said. The soy sauce was overpowering and the honey was burnt. I had this cooking on low for the 6 hours. Not posting a picture due to it being in the trash!

I didn't have boneless but saw another reviewer used this type too, so I tried it.  Dellicous..  If it's possible to get an answer here, I'd like to know if the leftover sauce can be re-used or would it have too much chicken grease in it? Thanks for sharing!

Added dried cilantro (did not have basil) and 1 tablespoon ground szechwan peppers. Slow cooke d for 4 hours, not 6 hours. And, simmered sauce to thicken after chicken was removed from cooker.

This was really, really good. It didn't turn out with the nice crust as shown in the picture but was delicious anyway. I did as others suggested and thickened the sauce at the end.  Only change I made was cooked chicken only four hours. Thighs were small and they ended up perfectly cooked in that amount of time.

I left the thighs on the bone.  The cooked meat becomes very tender and falls off of the bone.  I also doubled the recipe so we are sure to have left overs.  I thickened the left over sauce with corn starch to be spooned on before serving.

Meh.  I was expecting more flavor.  I made it as directed except I added a few bone-in chicken breasts. I might repeat the recipe for a baked version.  It would benefit from caramelization.

Awesome. Used tenders but thighs is the way to go. Would add fresh scallions and peanuts on top when serving. Could also do with pork and steak. Served with rice noodles and was amazing. Make for my family. So simple and yummy.

This was quite good and could not have been easier to prepare. This chicken appeared to have come off the grill rather than slow cooker.  The only change was that I didn't need to cook the meat near that long.  I am more experienced in the kitchen now and I am mindful of overcooking.  There is a lot of fluid and the amount of meat could be doubled.  I used a pound of thighs.

This ended up tasting like a good sweet and sour sauce chicken. I cooked cubed chicken breasts on the stove and used the sauce for a stir fry because I didn't have time to use the slow cooker. From other's suggestions, I reversed the amounts for the soy sauce and the honey, using a low-sodium soy sauce. Upped the garlic to 5 cloves. Added powdered ginger and red pepper flakes to sauce. When I tasted the sauce before cooking it, it didn't taste that great, but the taste improved once cooked down. Added frozen veggies, onions,  and a can of sliced pineapples at the end. I would make this again!

I have to copy another review - Delicious! We loved the way this receipe turned out. Next time I make it I am going to use chicken breast and try adding the cornstarch to the sauce as another reviewer suggested. This is a keeper - Yummy.

Good! Appreciate the easy prep and on-hand ingredients. I used about 3lbs of chicken thighs and legs, cooked on high 3 hours, and ate over egg noodles. Sauce was on the verge of too salty for my taste, so might try low-sodium soy sauce next time. Nevertheless, I am freezing the leftover sauce to try in a future stir fry meal ;)

Way too salty … maybe use less soy sauce. DO NOT cook for more than 6 hours. 
Overall, not good – I won’t make again. Needs major help.

It was dry & not as good as I'd hoped. My husband and daughter didn't like it at all but I was happy because I was starving and it's always nice to come home to a ready made dinner. Next time I'll tweak the sauce a bit (maybe add more garlic and some brown sugar, not sure) and use bone in chicken with the skin and throw it under the broiler after to crisp up the skin.

I made it exactly like the recipe said. It was far to saltly.  6 hrs on low , overcooked. It was, I don't know, bland? Bland, salty and overcooked. Terrible waste of chicken.

I cut down on the soy & ketchup, added brown suga, bbq sauce, ginga, scallions & splash of oj. Added carrots & Applewood smoked bacon pieces & ends to the pot. I coated the chix w Sazon & seared them skin on/bone in.  The last hr left, I added a slurry to thicken. Along w a bed of jasmine rice & all of it on top of course w roasted garlic asparagus on the side & a big glass of red wine made a killer meal.

I baked it in the oven for an hour to an hour and a half and threw some potatoes in with it. Everyone loved it. I did use low sodium soy sauce but most of us added a little salt for the potatoes so regular soy sauce might have been just as good. We had it over jasmine rice or just with the potatoes.

I followed the recipe precisely, and it was totally delicious. My family thoroughly enjoyed it with Rice. I will make it again, and again. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I made it using boneless chicken breast and used the other ingredients listed . As stated in the other reviews, it was a bit dry. Everyone liked it, but nothing special. I may make it in a while from now. I didn't like it enough to share the recipe with anyone

I  did not make any changes to this recipe.  I think I'm not a soy sauce fan.  The grandson did not like it, husband said it was good.  Just not that impressed.  Sorry, I'll ry another recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the directions, except I used 9 small thighs, and the sauce was completely soupy. I decided to take others' advice and strained the sauce into a pan and added cornstarch to thicken. I then spooned a little sauce back onto the thighs and put in the oven on 450 for about 20 minutes. It made the  sauce stick to the thighs, but I still did not like the flavor. I used low sodium soy sauce, so it was not too salty, but all I could taste was the soy sauce and the ketchup. I couldn't taste the honey or garlic. I won't be making this one again. Sorry.

It was simple and easy, however I did add green pepper to the mix and used Cajun style andouille sausage because I like spice but other than that good recipe.

These were very good, and I took Christina's tip (adding cornstarch to the gravy) . We had it with white rice,toasted bread, and roasted parmesan carrots.  Healthy and tasty!

I love salt and soy sauce so much that when I make bloody Mary's, I pour myself a shot of soy sauce by itself and drink it down. I enjoy it that much. Now that you understand my palette, or lack thereof, I found this sauce inedible. Not too salty. Inedible. Huge difference. I'm sorry to leave such a negative review but I felt this was really important to share.

I made this and used Autumn's suggested extra ingredients - ginger, onion and red pepper flakes. I also used low sodium soy sauce.  I used smaller thighs and was able to put 9 thighs in a 4 quart crock pot and there was plenty of sauce.  I cooked on high for two hours and low for about another two hours -  The chicken was was right temp at 2 hours but I felt like the onion (small chopped) needed a little extra time.  The sauce was thick enough for us, but if you want more of a glaze then straining and using cornstarch is a good idea.
Wonderful flavors, easy to make and quick to cook.

I don't like to make changes the first time I try a recipe, out of respect for the submitting Chef!  I have a severe allergy to honey and substituted Maple Syrup.  This was really good, my husband & I both enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again!

Delicious chicken recipe. I cooked it low and slow in the crock pot (8 hours). The longer the chicken cooks the more intense the flavors so I HIGHLY recommend using reduced sodium soy sauce, I'm glad I did. The chicken came out looking just like the picture. Some reviewers said they had to thicken the sauce with corn starch, I think that was probably because they cooked it for a shorter amount of time. My sauce came out nice and thick, not too thick though. I served with brown rice and broccoli and topped the chicken with additional sauce and toasted sesame seeds. Yummy. Leftovers tonight yea!This is a definite keeper.

I had higher hopes for this recipe. Although there were tasty elements to the food, the chicken became dry and over cooked. Six hours of cook time on crockpot "low" setting is to much for this dish.

This was a terrific recipe for chicken.  I have now used it on thighs, legs, and breasts.  Thighs were the best.  It is easy either in the slow cooker, or just in the oven.  My family loved it.

Made this for dinner last night and it was good, not great. My first impression was, it certainly needs no salt... the soya sauce was the reason for that. I used chicken drums to make this. The sauce needed thickening too, which I did not plan on having to do. Cooked on low 5 hours...I will pass making this again and try some other slow cooker recipe.

It would have been nice to have an approximate weight of the chicken. I used one package, more than four but fit in the bottom (one layer) of the pot. Six hours was way to long. Good flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly, however the thighs were so overdone as to almost render uneatable; perhaps they were too small; the flavor was not too bad;

Soy sauce made it too salty. I have eaten soy sauce in several foods but this was so salty I really did not want but just a half of the thigh.Sorry but I guess soy is not for me.

Definitely will make it again but with a little less honey as we found it a bi tweet for our taste.  I have a newer slow cooker and find it only takes abut4 1/2 hours to cook any kind of meat on low.

It was OK at best.  I used regular soy sauce and it made the chicken too salty.  I would recommend increasing the honey because the soy sauce overpowered it.

Chicken was really flavourful and tender. 

May cut back on the soya sauce next time I make it.

The meat was cooked very well, not overdone but did not care for the flavor. I think it was the basil. I added ginger and five spice to the finished sauce, thickened it with a little corn starch and served over rice which was more to our taste.

Since I had them on hand, I made it with bone-in chicken thighs, otherwise I followed the recipe.  The chicken turned out strongly flavored of soy sauce with a hint of honey.  The garlic, ketchup, and basil disappeared!  The chicken was black and dried out.  The "glaze" was thin and watery.  No, I won't make it again.

Just delicious! I did not find it too salty at all but I did use low sodium teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce and I did not slow cook it. I cooked it in the oven and based the chicken.  I then cut up the chicken in pieces and dipped it in the sauce.  Very tasty!

I'm not an expert chef, but I do have a culinary background. This recipe seemed strange to me, but it had good reviews so I tried it.  I'm sorry I did. It didn't taste like honey or garlic. It tasted like salty ketchup. I used low sodium soy sauce too. Very disappointed.

Excellent sauce, used bone in drum sticks and wings, very good. This will probably make some great wings. Used an Instant Pot, which worked great.

I just made this again, but  deleted the basil and used pork instead of chicken.  Worked well, and with pork it was tangy rather than sweet.  We will def make again.

Good flavor, though I would agree that it's a bit salty.  I also used 6 thighs, and there was plenty of leftover sauce, which I thickened with cornstarch.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I didn't start dinner in time to use the crockpot so I did mine in the oven (350 degrees, covered for about an hour.  Might not take as long if the thighs are small but mine were big.) So perfect.  Served them with rice and a fresh green salad.  Yum!

Yummy quick and easy chicken recipe. But next time I will use low sodium soy sauce. On the salty side for us. Served it with  brown/wild rice blend and it toned it down.

I've made this 3 or 4 times and we like it. Instead of regular soy sauce I use low sodium and only 1/3 cup, the rest of the soy sauce I make up for with white wine. If using thighs you'll want to use 8 instead of 4 because 2 thighs, not 1, is a serving .  I took 1 star off for skimpy serving size.

This cooked a lot faster for me than specified as I have a larger crock pot.  Seemed like ingredients didn't have enough time to mix and mingle.  Served it over Brown rice.  May try adding pineapple as one review suggested.  And green onions on top.

Chicken skin was soggy. Sauce was okay, but not really good. Wouldn't make again.

Delicious! Next time I'm going to drain off the cooking juices and add some cornstarch to make a sauce. Served with rice and green beans tonight. Definitely a favorite!

The sauce was very good.  I found the chicken thighs to be a bit dry, so am wondering if the low setting on my slow cooker is too  hot.

Used a bay leaf and less soy sauce. Served it with roasted brussel sprouts and garlic potatoes. Cooked the whole chicken and nothing was left. Yes I will cook it again.

I doubled this recipe except on the honey. Probably only added 1/3-1/2 C honey and then zested two mandarins into sauce and squeezed their juice into sauce. And I splashed a teaspoon or so of Frank's Red Hot into sauce. I also browned the chicken before adding to crockpot. So far it's still cooking! Looked amazing going in :) I'll come back to tell you all the verdict!!

First let me say that I am rating this based on its concept. I had to make substitutions because there are certain things I can eat. For example I used chicken breast and I had to use coconut amino instead of soy sauce. All in all it came out great. Sufficient heat, I did have to use a bit of salt as the coconut amino is not as salty as the soy would have been. I was very skeptical since this doesn't call for seasoning the chicken, but I resisted the urge to do so, and was pleased!

Let me start with saying, I am not a fan of dark meat AT ALL!  My husband is so I thought I would give this recipe a shot!!  This recipe is so yummy !!! I mixed all of the liquids together, heavy on the garlic added garlic powder and carmelized onions.  Put a little bit of the sauce in the bottom of the crock pot put 6 skinned bone in thighs, the thick side down and poured the rest of the sauce on the thighs!  Cooked in low for 4 hours!  The sauce on the chicken was glazed and the meat fell off the bone!  This is the only way I will eat chicken thighs! EVERYONE loved it even my picky husband!  I will make this over and over again....and it's so EASY!  Thank you for sharing !

I absolutely love this flavor! I would like to say that I made this recipe as written, but I guess technically I didn't. Since I used chicken breast ribbed meat and marinated it for about a whole day; give or take an hour or 2. Also, I didn't poke holes in the chicken. With that being said, I do prefer thighs and drumsticks; and believe that this would have been even better if I had used thighs.  I did not thicken or even use the sauce and it was still delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I loved the taste but the cooking time is to long because the chicken was dry. I made the recipe with chicken legs, skinned and separated the drum from the thigh. I also enjoyed them cold the next day for lunch with a salad. I was thinking easy summer lunch.

Very good.  It only needed 4 hours to cook.  Great flavor, not salty at all.  The sauce gave the chicken a nice glaze.  Then I put the chicken under the broiler for 10 minutes to give it a crust.

It was a good base, but the sauce came out extremely watery no matter what I did. I added some jarred, minced ginger, decreased the soy slightly because I read reviews that said it was too salty. I also omitted the honey and used about a 1/4 cup brown sugar. It was very good and my chicken actually fell apart in the slow cooker. I stir fried some veggies and cooked some rice. There was more than enough sauce to coat it all.

I followed this recipe pretty much as written except doubled the chicken because 4 thighs are not enough to feed a family of 4.  I did not double the sauce because there was still enough to cover 8 pieces of chicken.  I always use salt-reduced soya sauce.  I had fresh basil available.  The chicken was alright on the outside but dry on the inside. The sauce was just okay.  I have tried many fantastic chicken thigh recipes over the years and this was not one of the better ones!  We all ate it but no one in the family loved it enough to warrant making it again.

The chicken was sort of OK, but the sauce was not edible.  Had to throw the whole thing out.  It was just a greasy mess and tasted awful.  The only thing that I did differently was to use bone in chicken thighs rather than boneless ones.  Will not make again.

Super simple and what a great taste! I used 8 thighs as so many other recommended and I have plenty for leftovers. I served it over white rice but I could also see pasta, egg noodles, or quinoa working well too. This will be a regular dish from now on.

I stacked this with mashed potatoes: mashed potatoes on the bottom, covered with a little bit of the sauce, chicken placed on top of mashed potatoes and covered again with a little more of the sauce.

Excellent!!!

Was very easy to make.  Once I started the recipe I realized I was out of honey so substituted agave syrup instead.  Turned out great.  I used 10 chicken thighs and there was plenty of the sauce for all.  Served it over mashed potatoes one day and the leftovers (which were also yummy) over rice.  A definite keeper .

The taste was very good. Not too sweet or spicy. I did add pineapple chunks, pepper strips and onion at the last hour. Unfortunately the chicken fell apart. This did not make for a nice presentation. I might try bone-in chicken thighs.

Did not care for this at all but then again I am not a fan of dark meat. I was looking for a chicken thigh recipe that my family might enjoy, but this one wasn't it.

Flavor was good, but the chicken was very dry...even though it was swimming in the sauce. Made a gravy with the sauce that helped a little, but not sure I would make it again.

Won't make again.  It was watered down from being slow cooked.  The sauce tasted good, but once you get into the chicken, it lacked flavor.  My family didn't care for it.  Bummer!

This was really good, but the only thing I changed was omitting the basil. I had nine chicken thighs boneless and skinless but I also trimmed them to avoid extra fat. The amount of soy sauce was perfect, didn't want it salty.  Put some rice in the rice cooker and steamed some veggies, easy supper!

This dish was most delicious, but when I smelled it cooking and tasted it, it screamed PULLED CHICKEN BBQ so I shredded the meat (I started with 6 boneless, skinless thighs) with two forks, skimmed the fat off the top of the sauce, returned the shredded chicken to the sauce and sent my son to the store for buns. It was absolutely wonderful served with raw veggies and ranch dressing dipping sauce.

This is indeed a very easy to make dish. I think I just don't like ketchup. The taste didn't work for me. Too tangy and too sweet. But if you like ketchup, this must be a good dish for you. It's so easy to make. So if you don't like it (like me), no big deal.

This meal was very easy and I used pantry staples. My family and I enjoyed this recipe. I am a huge slow cooker lover. 
We had the meal with steamed rice and steamed veggies. With the leftovers I made a really delicious friend rice.

Very disappointed. Flavor was bland. Sauce was too liquid.

I cooked 8 thighs and used the amounts of ingredients for 4 thighs hoping I'd have thicker sauce.  No such luck...

Sorry I have no suggestion to improve this...except try another!

This recipe was so easy and the taste, fabulous!  I only reduced the soy to 1/3 cup so it was not too salty tasting, and added a tsp of ground thyme.  Will definitely be making again!

This was absolutely icky.  I cut the garlic down from 3 cloves to 1.  But maybe the thing that doomed it was that I used liquid aminos from soy instead of soy sauce.  When I use the aminos as just a seasoning, it tastes just like soy sauce, so I thought it would be fine.  At any rate, the chicken was overcooked and the sauce was soupy.  Neither my husband nor I wanted to eat it.

I had 6 chicken thighs and next time I will double it to 8 chicken thighs. Plenty of sauce.   The sauce and all instructions were excellent.  The recipe was super delicious and I can't wait to serve it for a party of four!

Made it per the recipe. 

For my palette, I found:
1. The chicken was a bit too salty (use less soy and use low sodium soy)
2. The overall flavor was a bit too sweet (reduce the honey - 1/3 cup is too much)
3. The meat was tender slow cooker, but the dish was done in 4-5 hours, not 6
4. I had to reduce the sauce - too wet to be served either on the chicken or rice straight from the SC.

I won't make it again, since it was just "OK" for me; on to other and new recipes.

My family liked it well.  My kids liked it really well and Jason liked it more than oregano chicken.  I thought it was okay.  I separated the chicken and cooked the sauce with a cornstarch slurry (1/4 c water and 2 T cornstarch.) I reheated the chicken in the oven for a few minutes.

It was very good and quite easy to make, but the soy sauce made it a bit too salty for me. I ended up adding some extra honey to balance the saltiness, and it tasted better in my opinion. Disclaimer: I don't like salt, so if you do, it's probably fine as is.

This si probably the first All Recipes recipe in which I didn't care for the flavor or texture. The thighs were soggy due to the liquid produced during cooking. The skin was not crisp. The soy sauce and ketchup gave it a metallic taste. I am surprised at the rave reviews. At first I thought I did something wrong but it's a pretty easy recipe to follow. Maybe it just didn't work for my taste.

No changes made. Just found the soy sauce flavor to be way too much for my liking. Maybe I used too much? Flavors would seem more balanced if less soy sauce in my opinion, tasty though,

Mine didn't come out nicely browned like the picture. There was way too much liquid and truthfully, we weren't crazy about the flavor. I don't think I'll be making this again unless I can tweak the recipe somehow. Maybe more a sweet/sour taste.

Since there was so much sauce, I used 14 boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I read other reviews and cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 5 hours, instead of 6 hours. It came out perfect (with still plenty of sauce leftover). I didn't put any corn starch to thicken it and although it was a little watery, I didn't mind. The thighs were served it over white basmati rice. My husband rated it a 'A'! I will definitely make this again! The only thing I would change next time is using a low sodium soy sauce.

We loved it. I used one recipe of the sauce with 9 thighs and it seemed just right. I made mine in a skillet on the stovetop. It didn't take long and came out great.

This was very good but seemed to missing something. Maybe it needs ginger. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch, I'll try reducing it next time to concentrate the flavors before thickening. I also put a glob of siracha on mine, adding some red pepper flakes during cooking will be good too.  It tasted much better the next day. Definitely a recipe work tweaking.

No changes made but it was 'cooking' for abut 9 hours due to my work  hours, (6 hours recommended). This did not effect the outcome.. So easy and nice flavours, I will make again.

Spray the slow cooker with cooking spray.  Clean up was easy. 
I used 8 smallish, boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Mixed up the sauce using 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder,  1 1/2 tsp. dried basil, 
2 T brown sugar. Same amount of soy sauce (low sodium), ketchup and honey that is in the recipe.  Poured this over the thighs and topped the whole thing with about 1/2 bag of frozen mixed pepper strips. 
This was done perfectly in 3 1/2 hours on low. Thickened the sauce in another pot by mixing up 1T cornstarch with 1/8 cup cold water. Whisk it into the sauce and heat to a simmer.  Pour over the thighs. 
Served it over rice.  Easy, peasy and very good.

As is, the sauce was pretty sweet and very "tomatoey".  With some additions it turned into a great dish.   I added onion flakes, additional soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes until the sweetness was cut.  Even then, I wish I hadn't added the full amount of ketchup.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce for a few hours and sautéed in a pan until the chicken was almost shreddable.   Will make again with the additions.

I used 5 thighs w/o bone and they were done after 2 hours. Chicken was very dry. I was home all afternoon and had read the reviews so that is why I checked it. I put the slow cooker on warm for the remaining hours before dinner but even that made the liquid boil. I added water and turned it off. I have a fairly new slow cooker.

Simple and absolutely delicious.  Hubby loved it.  Adjustments in cooking time may have to be made.  I cooked for 4 1/2 hours on low and chicken was nice and moist.  This recipe is quickly becoming a favorite of ours.

I followed the receipe except instead of 4 chicken thighs I used 8 small ones.  I thought the 6-hour cook time was too long and the chicken was over done.  Next time I would cut the cook time down to 4 hours instead of 6.

I made this last night and it was fall apart delish!  I doubled the chicken thighs and stayed with the same sauce measurements that recipe called for and there was plenty of sauce.  I will definitely  make this again!!

This came out great. I am always at work so I don't have much time to cook and I especially don't want to once I get home. I threw this into the slow cooker before work and came home to an amazing meal. It was cooked perfectly when I followed the recipe exactly... didn't change a single thing and it was awesome. I served it with quinoa and kale and my boyfriend and I both devoured it! This will be a new go-to recipe for sure.

Sorry but this was way too salty, the soy sauce was too overpowering and I couldn't even stomach the smell. I followed exact directions and it was soupy and the chicken was very dry. Anyone who tries this I would recommend starting with 1/8 cup of soy sauce and adding to taste.

I made this  recipe using some of the suggestions others made.  I used low sodium soy sauce, added some pineapple chunks and red bell pepper in the last hour and thickened with a little cornstarch.  My family loved it!  My grandson wants me to make it for his birthday dinner, the ultimate complement!

Excellent flavor! Entire family loved it. I only gave it four stars because I believe the recipe is a bit faulty. First of all,  I used 6 thighs....but found with the amount of sauce that I could have cooked 8 or 10 and had plenty of sauce. Also, after reading other reviews I watched the time carefully. at 3 hours 45 minutes the chicken was done. If I had cooked the entire 6 hours it would have been ruined. 
I added a bit more fresh, ground ginger and some sesame oil and 2 tablespoons very very teriyaki bc I was short a bit on soy sauce. Wonderful flavor.

I gave 5 stars for the ease and versatility. It's perfect for  a Tuesday meal. I would maybe cut a tad back on soy sauce but it's good as is also. And 6 hours on low was too long for my boneless/skinless thighs. 4-5 would've sufficed. Still was great though!   Next time I'm definitely going to try adding ginger or.... maybe some Thai red pepper for kick. Definitely will make again! Served with jasmine rice and asparagus. Note to self: Sesame and celery flavors may be good also. Maybe cashews.

It was okay.  Too salty despite using low sodium soy sauce.  Followed directions and cooking time but the thighs were dry and somewhat tough and not as flavorful as I thought they'd be.  I'll probably try again but increase the honey in it. And decrease the cooking time.  It was an easy meal for preparation though.  I served rice  and broccoli with it and used  the sauce over the rice.

I made this dish according to the recipe, as far as ingredients.  I didn't have time to cook it in the crockpot, so I browned the chicken with the garlic in olive oil,  then put it in a glass casserole dish, poured the sauce over it and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.  It came out moist and very tasty, and was great for a quick dinner.  I served it with yellow rice and salad. The only thing I changed, as far as ingredients was to use low-sodium soy sauce.  I'll definitely make it again!

Tastes great! I used a whole chicken instead of just thighs (because that's what was in my freezer at the time) and it turned out great. Whole family loved it :)

My family LOVED this and the recipe is now in our Family FavorItes collection. I put half the sauce on for the first half of cooking and added the remainder for the last half.  I also drained off the excess "watery" fluid that accumulated at the beginning. We served ours with Jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Next time I think we'll serve it with egg noodles. The ingredients are staples in our pantry so this recipe works real well for our family. An easy to put together meal. My family & I highly recommend this recipe.

I love how simple and easy this recipe is.  It reminds me of the Hawaiian Shoyu (Soy Sauce) Chicken. I used skin and bone-in picnic pack from Safeway which contained both thighs and legs. Did not need to adjust other ingredients and it was delicious. The only thing I would change is to reduce the cooking time. Low 6 hours on my slow cooker was a little too long.

Made as in recipe.  It's BBQ Chicken.  Not bad, for BBQ chicken, you you really need to call it that.  As it goes, and all-right BBQ sauce, but there are better.   I liked it okay.  Picky wife didn't.

This recipe is delicious and super quick to make.  My two young daughters and my husband loved this meal.  I served it up with new potatoes seasoned with thyme, rosemary, salt & pepper, tossed in olive oil and baked in the oven, with roasted red, yellow & orange peppers, with zuchini, tossed in olive oil and baked in the oven as well.  We drizzled the sauce from the chicken on the baked potatoes.  So yummy!

The ingredients are kitchen staples, but the quantities were to excessive. 1/2 cup of soy sauce was way to salty. I ended up cutting the salty taste by adding pineapple juice. The "juice" was not thick enough to use as a sauce.

This recipe was extremely easy 


to follow and simple to prepare.   I used two extra thighs, and increased all ingredients by 25%, and added a bunch of scallions from the start of the cooking process.  I feel they complimented the flavors well and helped produce more sauce..  I also thickened the sauce using Cornstarch, and used low sodium Soy Sauce instead of full sodium.


Will definitely use this recipe; as altered,
 again.

I am recently divorced after 34 years & like a knuckle head I never cooked (maybe why?).  Never had too. (She should have been a chef) Now that I am a slow cookin fool I have used this recipe many, many times. I have a rice cooker that I use & the last 30 minutes stir in cooked rice & tons of different fresh vegetables to the slow cooker (grass, all colors of peppers & zucchini, cukes, brocc, water chestnuts, green beans, pea pods) I leave it in the air tight slow cooker in the refer &  I take a little bit out every night for the week! Good Stuff!

I made it per the recipe except I didn't have thighs on hand so I used boneless breasts.   I only cooked for about 4 hours and the chicken was done.  Tasted good and I served the sauce over brown rice.  Will probably make again.

I made no changes, and it turned out perfectly.  I also made it again with chicken tenders, and that was even better.  You would think it would have been too sweet, but it wasn't.  I realize that can be a highly individual thing, but my husband does not have the sweet tooth I do, and he loved it.

Best thighs I've had in a long time. Cooked for only 5.5 hrs. because they were small. Opted to use 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup oyster sauce to cut down on salty taste. Served with mashed potatoes. Awesome !

I added three good shakes of cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch and tone down the ketchup taste. I also used fresh basil and parsley.

I don't have a slow cooker, so I baked the dish in the oven for an hour at 300 degrees. I, too, found the sauce too watery and thickened it with corn starch after the thighs were done. Very good! Oh, and I used light soy sauce, so it was not too salty.

This was good but a little too salty for my taste. Maybe next time I will try and cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup chicken broth. I used bone in thighs. The meat was so tender that the bone easily pulled out.

My picky 1 year old and 4 year old both loved these! I halved the soy sauce (if I'd had coconut aminos I would have used that instead), and used 8 bone in, skin on chicken thighs. Removed thighs after pressure cooking, instead of slow cooking, added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I could have broiled the thighs for a few minutes to crunch-up the skin and maybe thicken the sauce by basting with it. A fantastic, easy recipe!

My Rival slow cooker might be too hot on low but even using twice the amount of chicken it was overdone in six hours. In spit of using lite soy sauce, it was so salty it was inedible.

Easy and delicious! I used 6 bone-in chicken thighs instead of four. In the interest of saving a few minutes in the morning I wisked all the sauce ingredients together the night before so I just had to lay the chicken in the slow cooker and pour the sauce over them just before leaving for work. The only minor change I made was the addition of about 2T ghost blueberry hot sauce. Since some people wrote that 6 hours was too much I set the crock on low for 5 hours. The chicken was perfect. I understand why some people think its too salty but both hubs and I were fine with the amount of saltiness in the finished dish. One of the other reviewers mentioned coconut rice so I went with that. It was a good compliment. I'll make this again. Thanks!

It was too salty for my family's taste   I had to brown sugar to the chicken.  It does have a good taste and was easy to do.  Reduced soy sauce  would work better otherwise a good dish to eat with rice.

Chicken was cooked after only 4 hours- no need to leave in for 6 per recipe.  The sauce was not very tasty.  I won't make it again.

After I plated chicken I poured over the sauce and threw it under the broiler (low heat).  Next time I will add some roux to the sauce to thicken it up a bit before I put it under the broiler again.

I thought this dish was super easy to make and delicious.  Made it as directed, except I had 9 chicken thighs.  It was falling apart.  I put the sauce in a pan, brought it to a slight boil and added wondra flour to thicken it.  Very good.

Loved it! Its easy and quick to make as well as delicious! My partner loved it as well making this a win-win!  I did follow other reviews using 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs. I also added corn starch as others suggested to thicken the sauce at the end. To do this I removed the chicken thighs, whisked the corn starch with cold water to blend (otherwise corn starch will clump when mixed into anything warm) and poured into sauce mixing well until I got my desired consistency. Served chicken with sauce over brown rice. Definitely will be making this recipe again!!

tasted like bbq chicken-waste of good expensive honey.  If I ever make it again I would definitely leave out any tomato products, especially ketchup.

I cooked in crock pot as directed, it came out over cooked, almost dry for thighs! Way too much soy sauce, I was expecting to taste the honey. If I try again will cut down on soy sauce and increase the honey.

My apologies to the chef, but this was just terrible.  Followed ingredients to the letter but cut down cooking time based on reviewer input.  Thighs were wonderfully fall-apart tender however the smell and flavor was so awful we could not eat it.  I pulled out all the chicken to give to my dogs as treats.

I made this twice and it was amazing. I made it in the slow cooker and in the oven for a larger crowd. Everyone enjoyed it and raved about the taste! I have a Ninja 3 in 1 slow cooker, I lightly browned the chicken, then  added the rest of the ingredients. When it was done I put the chicken in oven on broil for a few min, it was crispy and had lots of flavor. Both times when I removed everything  I added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce..

I tried making this recipe twice. The first time I made variations and none of us like the way it turned out. The second time I stuck to the instructions strictly thinking that maybe I had missed something and still it was disgusting. I will not make this again.

Super fantabulous! Very tasty. I did BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and just did 1/4 cup soy sauce due to some reviews saying it was salty because of the soy sauce. One review says to use corn starch to stiffen the sauce but dont think it helped that much. The meat was very tender and just fell off the bone as I used bone-in thighs. I also did the skin-on thighs which was cheaper as I dont mind skin-on chicken. Overall Id do it again with the modifications I mention. I did go 5 hours on low.

I made it exactly according to directions.  I used half thawed chicken breasts (large ones!) The directions said for 6 hours, well, I checked in 5 and they were burnt.  The directions I had said to cook for 6 hours on high.  I don't think I'd make it again. As I only eat chicken I really wanted to love this.

Made with chunks of cut up carrots on the bottom of slow cooker along with more chicken.  Dash of sesame oil & of course more garlic for my families taste.  Last hour lots of mushrooms & made a slurry with corn starch to thicken.  Served with salad & rice.   Great recipe !

I just don't understand posters that say it was too salty or it was overcooked. Use low sodium soy sauce for one thing and also check the chicken after a couple hours to see if it's cooked. Mine was done in 3 hours. It's not rocket science.
That being said I had to leave when I put it in the crockpot and when I came home about 3 hours later it was done so I didn't have time to do anything else to it. Made it exactly as it was written. Husband said the sauce was "Ok, not bad" and I thought it was pretty good but I think I'll leave out the basil next time. To me it just gave a weird taste. I also didn't have any garlic so I had to use granulated garlic so I'm sure that had something to do with the final result. I will try again though using plenty of garlic and maybe add some green peppers to it.

Delicious! Doubled the garlic b/c we LOVE garlic. I was worried it would be very salty, but it wasn't too bad. There was a lot of sauce & it was a little runny. Next time I'll halve the sauce (or use double the # of thighs), and  use low sodium soy sauce. My 1 & 3 yr olds were licking their plates lol and everyone wanted me to make it again the next night.

Made this recipe and along with being incredibly easy (I am so culinarily challenged there should be a picture under my car when I park), the flavor was amazing.  After reading the other reviews, I felt safe to increase the amount of chicken to 2 packages of skinless, boneless thighs and there was still ample leftover to use for a gravy when mixed with corn starch slurry.  Making it again today, increasing the amount of chicken again, so we can repurpose it all week.  Ideas right now include over roasted eggplant, quesadillas, and some type of stuffed pepper.

I used Honey Barbecue Sauce, sweet basil, minced garlic,  cornstarch (added 30 minutes before I turned off the slow cooker to thicken the sauce), and 2 boneless chicken thighs. I cooked it on high for 3-1/2 hours. The thighs were tender and tasty. I served it with kamut and mixed vegetables. I would cook it again..

I cut up a whole chicken and thickened the sauce with corn starch. I also used lite soy sauce, but used the same amounts as stated in the recipe. It was excellent! I definitely will make again.

Added more chicken To reduce amount of soy sauce per serving. Added a little water to thin. Good but a bit salty.

Made as is and will make again! So easy, had all the ingredients at home and  all members of my family loved it - even my picky son, and my husband who doesn't ordinarily like chicken thighs. Well done!

I would use less soy sauce. Too salty for my taste. And I would cook it for less time. 3 hours on high in the crockpot was too long.

Absolutely delicious. Like one other reviewer, I added chopped onion, pineapple, and red pepper (not green). It was served over rice and delighted my husband. It's a keeper!

I made it pretty much as written with the exception that I used lite soy sauce.  I also cooked it on high for 1 hour, then low for 4 hours because I didn't get it started until later than I had planned.  But it worked out because the chicken was perfectly tender.  I put it on a broiler pan and browned up the skin just before serving.  My guests were fighting over the crispiest thighs!  It is slightly sweet, and with the lite soy sauce, not too salty.  Will make this again and again.

Delicious!  Whole family loved it.  I used skinless drumsticks and it worked well. All items were in my pantry, and it was quick and easy.  Doesn't seem like a slow cooker  meal. I served it with jasmine rice and green beans.  I will definitely make this again.

This had everything going for it- ease of preparation, delicious ingredients, and easy to find staples on hand.  Where it fell apart was in the slow cooker.  When I followed the recipe exactly as written, I came home to an overcooked sauce with dry chicken in it.  I guess I could always make it again and see what happens if cooked for a shorter period but, as it is written, it definitely does not work in my slow cooker.  The family was very disappointed and so was I, since much potential!

The directions state putting the chicken in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours.  Too long...the chicken dried out.  It tasted great but the texture was poor because the thighs were too well done.  I'll most likely shorten the cooking time to 5 hours the next time.

LOVE this recipe...I always double the amount of chicken, but nothing else...if you are going to be away from home for MORE than 8 hours, I highly recommend using FROZEN chicken thighs, still cooked on low! I serve it over jasmine rice, and with steamed green beans tossed with a little sesame oil. YUM! It is now a staple in my picky eaters' house!

I prepared this as written and it burned in the crock pot at 6 hours on low. It was inedible. I might try it again, but cook it only about 4 hours on low. Very disappointed.

Yuck!! When I poured 3/4 cup soy sauce in the measuring cup for 6 servings I thought my that is ALOT of soy sauce. To no surprise it was too much soy sauce and very salty. I added additional ketchup and 4TBSP brown sugar to tame the soy sauce flavor which helped. Beware of soy sauce ratio!!!

Really good. I would suggest seasoning a bit with salt unless the chicken thighs were already stored in salt water.

The first time I made it exactly as written. The second time, I added ginger, crushed red pepper,  green onion, and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. It was good as written, but very good with some tweaks.

Probably one of the worst seasoned chicken I ever made in my life.  I made it EXACTLY like on the recipie.  Probably should have altered like others said.

This is undoubtedly the easiest recipe.  It came out tender, moist and downright good!  Very tasty chicken. The only change I made was to use 10 thighs. I did use the same amount of sauce. Sure will do this one again and again!

Delicious! I loved the sauce. I didn't change a thing. It was not too salty but it was very, very easy and quick. My husband wants to use the sauce for his bbq ribs. Amazing!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I planned my dinner to be served after 5 hours in case it got done early. 
Well, I bet it was done in 3 hours! We were out of the house when cooking.  
They shrunk down to little medallions and were dry and overcooked.  I used my 4 qt. Slow cooker on low setting. I cooked 6 pieces. 
It smelled so good.  I was really looking forward to it. 
I will not make the chicken this way again. But, I will try it on stovetop or in the oven. And, a much, much, shorter time. 
And it was too salty.  I thought it might be, so I used low sodium soy sauce.  Still too much.

Mine came out very salty and overdone but I think it was just a difference in slow cooker settings and type of soy sauce used.  I will try it again and make adjustment.

Wonderful.  This was the second time I made this and it turned out great.  My mother joined me for dinner and she loved it.  Because of her condition with high blood pressure, I used low sodium soy sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  This is a keeper.

Made this tonight, and the chicken was delicious, tender and juicy! I didn't have the garlic cloves, soy sauce or chicken thighs, but substituted- 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce and two chicken breasts. Since time was short set my crockpot on high and 2 1/2 - 3 hours later chicken was done, instead of  the full 6 hours recipe called for. Definitely will make again.

I used 12 BL/SL thighs. I didn't double the recipe but should have (ran out of soya sauce). Super delicious. My hubby and 2 year old love it. Made it with sautéed veggies and rice.

Very good.  Simple.  Not doing back flips but good recipe.  Will most likely make again.  I may try something besides ketchup.  Perhaps tomato paste (with additional seasonings?) as ketchup could have made it too sweet for my tastes.

Very good, only had boneless breasts and they dried out more than I would have liked due to me over cooking. It made a lot of sauce which was very good also. Will make again!

Chicken was moist and delicious! Minimal effort with pantry staples for a delicious meal! It tasted nothing like what I had anticipated, much more like teriyaki chicken than honey garlic. Still yummy!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it's way too salty!  I made it exactly the way it was written.  I did give it 3 stars though because it's a quick and easy recipe and I'll be trying it again in the future with some revisions.

I made very little changes according to my personal tastes, followed it pretty close.  But definitely back off on the cook time.  I used 12 thighs and only cooked for 3 hours on low.  It was delicious and will assuredly make it again.

This was great! Made it exactly as written.  The only change I'll make in the future is to reduce the soy sauce a bit - maybe to 1/3 cup?  just to take the saltiness down a touch.  But the chicken was really tender and this was so easy to make!  Garnished with fresh cilantro.

This was so good and so easy!  I made just a few changes.  First, I added Greek seasoning to the chicken as I added them to the crock pot.   I also added some sesame seeds and fresh broccoli the last hour of cooking, so I would have a one pot meal.  This was so good, hubby said "make this again!".  Thanks for sharing!

This did not take 6 hours, more like 3.5 on low and it was not good. Tried to salvage it by adding some sesame oil and red pepper, but it was not enough to fix the taste. I thought with all the 4 and 5 star reviews it would be much better. Rare that a highly rated recipe from AR disappoints, but this did.

Wow, this was really good. Everyone in my house loved these. Here is what I did differently. I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I browned the thighs in a little olive oil first. Then put them in a stoneware pan with the sauce and baked in oven at 375 for about 45-50 minutes. Delicious. Served with naan and baked potatoes and a salad. This is a keeper and I know I will make this again.

This isn't quite a Teryaki sauce, not Korean BBQ sauce, not traditional BBQ, it's hard to put it in a category. I guess that's why there are so many alterations mentioned in the comments.

I never 

I tripled the recipe so we could eat it for lunch the next day, and I am glad I did.

Delish! Made to the recipe but used Italian seasoning, had no basil. Served with wild rice.

This was too salty for my taste but my husband loved it so I might try it again.  I'm thinking maybe low sodium soy sauce or the addition of some brown sugar would help. I liked someone's idea of pineapple. I also served it with rice and broccoli, thickened the sauce with cornstarch.

The picture that is used for this recipe in NO WAY represents the finished product - I am very disappointed on that level.  The flavour is good and the meat tender and tasty but there is too much liquid. I disagree with some others in that I did not find it too salty and the ketchup flavour wasn't prominent.  I quadrupled the amount of meat but left the rest the same.  IF I use this recipe again, I'll finish it off in the oven to give it a better presentation.

This turned out AWESOME! The only thing I would do different next time would be to  cut the Soy Sauce in half. It was a nice mixture of sweetness and tart. But the amount of Soy Sauce   slightly overpowered the sweetness of the honey. Other than that it was GREAT!

Followed the directions to a T even making sure I used the right size crock pot. Stopped half way through because I could smell it was going to have a burnt taste. Meat really dry and stringy. Disappointed!

The soy / ketchup / honey is just a gross combination.  So gross.   It smelled okay while in the crockpot, but the taste was disturbing on so many levels.  I made the recipe as written. The entire family scraped off as much "sauce" as possible and tried to eat as much of the chicken as we could stomach so it wouldn't go to waste.

It's not often I find a highly rated recipe on AR that I don't like, but this is one of them. I made the dish exactly as described, even the size of the crock pot. The chicken was inedible. My husband ate it so it wouldn't be wasted but neither me or the kids could eat it. It was entirely too salty - all I could taste was soy sauce and ketchup. Plus, after 5 hours I turned the temperature from low to warm for the last 1-2 hours and the meat was severely overcooked: tough and dry. I will not make this again.

I made this according to the recipe. Three people tried it an none of us liked it. We threw the leftovers in the trash. Greasy, soggy ,  and definitely not tasteful. Sorry to give a poor review, but honestly we did not like it at all.

This was pretty good for chicken. A little too sweet for my taste but still good.  I used the marinade amounts as written but used 2.5 pounds of chicken thighs and it was still plenty enough liquid.   Cold leftover chicken was good the next day too!

I tried this recipe as written first.  It made too much sauce for the amount of chicken. The chicken was dry-too long cooking time. The worst part it was just too salty for me, even using   Low sodium soy sauce. 

I made several adjustments that made it a pretty good dish.  Here are the changes:
1. Cut soy sauce by half. 
2. Add 1 extra clove garlic
3. Add 1/4 c. brown sugar to sauce
4. Cut one dozen baby carrots in half-add on top of chicken
5. Add 1/4 yellow onion cut into rings to bottom of pan. 
6. Add 1/2 of a large red pepper diced on top of chicken. 
7. 2 hours into cooking pour a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks (juice and fruit) over top.  Stir in. 
8. Cook a total of 4 hours - the first two hours on high, the 2nd two in low. 
9.  Serve over steamed rice.  

I have served it with both thickened sauce and thin. Tasty either way.
I understand my version is not the same recipe -but if I were to base the rating  on the original, it would only receive 1 star.

This is a good recipe but I made a few modifications. I upped the amount of honey (by taste), seasoned my chicken with seasoning salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder. Towards the end I added brown sugar to take down some of the soy sauce.

Used bone-in chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand.  The flavor was good, the chicken pulled right away from the bone.  I only tried one serving and I put it over egg noodles with some of the sauce which was very thin.  I may add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce for the rest of it.

I hate recipes with fake photos.  The photo obviously was cooked some other way because a slow cooker would not make it all brown and crispy on the top!

this recipe came out great.   it was so easy and the chicken was very tender and full of flavor. Considering the other reviews, I added pineapple and peppers the last 30 min. I will definitely make this again

I have friends asking for the recipe because they liked it so much! I ended up using bone-in chicken thighs and the meat was falling off the bone. The only thing that I recommend is using low sodium soy sauce, adding green onions and serving the chicken over rice.

I used my canned tomatoes, which have less salt and more flavor...in my opinion. This recipes might be better when I have garden fresh Basil- 6 months from now.

I was hopeful that this would turn out well, but alas, it didn't. After a couple of hours in the crockpot, I could smell the sauce and it was already unappetizing. The chicken was so soft, like pulled chicken. The flavor kind of tastes like a burnt, salty honey (but not like crispy honey like on a dessert). But it wasn't actually salty. It was weird. I tried to eat it, but it's just...not appetizing.

I made this using chicken breast instead of thighs. I don't use thighs. I also added brown sugar. It turned out really and well and I loved the flavor.

I didn't have 1/2 cup of soy sauce ( I used 8 packets since I didn't have a bottle) and I added roasted sesame oil. Later I added some water and rice to make it more a stew than a dish since the thighs broke up in the cooker. I liked it but my husband didn't. He only likes fried chicken wings if he's to eat chicken.

I thought this quite good - here's what I did with 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs which I trimmed for fat. I have a large crockpot - so the # of chicken thighs should be equal to what covers the bottom of your crock pot without too much bunching up and no overlap. It turned out great, and I cooked at 2.5 hours high. In the last 1 hour I added a diced bell pepper, 1 8 oz package of sliced mushrooms, and 1 medium onion chopped. I finished by broiling the thighs themselves on high for 5 minutes, and put a slurry (roughly 1/8 cup cornstarch with cold water, whisked until smooth) of cornstarch in to thicken the sauce.

-8 skinless boneless chicken thighs
-1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
-1/3 cup ketchup 
-1/3 cup honey 
-6 cloves garlic, minced
-1 full teaspoon ginger paste (or fresh ginger, grated)
-1 half teaspoon ground white pepper
-1 full spoon chili garlic paste

I doubled the amount of thighs and sauce and it was really good. I made the sauce a day ahead so the flavors had a chance to really meld and it was delicious!  I served mine with jasmine rice and the men in my household went for seconds! Thanks for a tasty easy crock pot dish!

Easy and tasty. I grated about 1 1/2 tbsp ginger and added it to the pot for some more flavor. Worked like a charm.

I think this would have been alright with a substitute for the basil.  It gave it a weird taste.  With all the soy sauce, maybe 5 spice would have been a better choice in my opinion.

I just made this tonight abd it turned out great, I gave it a 5 even though i used other reviewers suggestions because it really tastes great! I used 4 whole chicken legs, used just a little bit less sauce, used low sodium soy sauce, minced ginger and garlic! Personally i think ginger is a must in asian cooking and having jarred minced garlic and ginger is time saving! I cooked it on high for 3 hours, thickened sauce with corn starch to my desired consistency! I have been struggling to find good slow cooker recipes, I hate how food turns out soupy and mushy but this is perfect!

This recipe is delicious and could not have been easier. I used 6 chicken thighs and probably could have used a couple more. It probably depends on how large the thighs are. I had a late start and cooked them on high for almost 3 hours. They were tender and amazing. I will definitely keep this as a staple!

The umami flavors in this dish are amplified by pairing it with Star Anise Mead from Prairie Rose Meadery in North Dakota -- in fact this mead is terrific with just about any umami-rich Chinese or Japanese dish, especially soy-and-sesame-oil preparations that are generally difficult to find good wine pairings for.

Doubled recipe but left soy sauce at 1/2 cup only and used low sodium.  Added a little black pepper.  Tasted good but sauce is watery so you may want to thicken it if serving over rice.

This was very good. My family enjoyed it. It was easy to make with ingredients I usually have on hand. I added sesame seeds to the sauce . I served it with fried rice & streamable mixed veggies. I will definitely be adding this to my list of good, easy to prepare meals.

Like another reviewer, I made this following the recipe exactly. The sauce was thick when I mixed it but it cooked up to a soup. And you can't make this before going to work and putting in a full day because your chicken will get dry. This might work better on the stovetop.

This is really good.  I've never been a big fan of chicken thighs, as I'm more of a breast and wing guy.  This recipe may change that.  Like the video suggested, I used 8 thighs; otherwise everything else was the same.  I will definitely make this again.

Chicken thighs only took about 4 hours on low to be done -- so keep an eye on them! I served over brown rice and added an Asian veggie medley (water chestnuts, broccoli, carrots and sugar snap peas). Easy and delicious!

Use low sodium soy sauce. Made 6 thighs probably could have done 8. Will make again because it's very easy. Added everything to the cooker before bed or off to work.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I just happen to have six thighs and it worked out perfectly. I did add a drop of toasted sesame oil to give it a Asian flair. I served this over white rice and a side vegetable. I would make again.

Loved it.  I used 1/3 c. Soya sauce, 1/4 c ketchup, 1/4 c  Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and spicey BBQ sauce, 1/3 c honey, .garlic, 1/2 tsp ginger and chopped up a small onion. Added cornstarch to thicken at end.  With 5 chicken thighs which were a good size, it took 5 hours on low to cook.  It makes lots of sauce.

I make this all the time! My fiancé hates chicken thighs, and this is the only version he will eat! I use bone in thighs if they are on sale and get the same delicious result. I use low sodium ketchup and soy sauce, and serve with sesame seeds sprinkled on chicken. A keeper for sure!

I have this in my crock pot right now and it's all done and on warm. I sneaked a taste and omg! !  It's extremely tasty and tender. The only changes I made was to double the sauce as I had more chix thighs and no fresh garlic on hand so I used scallions on hand. And imo, low sodium soy is the way to go. (Always on hand! ) Will definitely make this again! !

I think it would of been delicious, unfortunately our slow cooker burnt the sauce and turned the chicken into leather! ??
Possible reason is our slow cooker is a 5 qt, not a 4 qt, which means maybe we should of put it on a longer cook cycle (8 or10 hours) which would use a lower temperature?

I am always looking for a easy chicken recipe that tastes like you slaved over the stove. This is that recipe. Simple and delicious. I used low sodium soy, I always do when I cook. I also added fresh pineapple.

So many great reviews, it's got to be good right? Made this recipe exactly as written, it was awful. My kids and I couldn't eat it. Threw away the remaining chicken. The flavor was bizarre, a sweet, sour, tangy taste. I'm sorry to say, this was the worst thing I've made in the past 15 years.

Best honey garlic chicken I have ever had!!! The sauce slowly cooks in all the way to the bone of the chicken so it's the chicken is juicy and tasteful with every bite. I did use chicken with bone and skin as I do like to peel my meat off the bone and do enjoy eating some of the skin as well! I made so much of it and yet it was all gone within 24 hrs!! ?

This was WAY too salty. I might try it again and cut the soy sauce in half. It also overcooked. Not a good recipe to set up in the morning and leave all day. Better to start this after lunch. As it turned out it was barely edible. Maybe next time I'd add some veggies to add interest. Potatoes might be good to soak up some of the liquid, which came out very watery.

I made these for dinner last night. I did not use the crockpot since I was home and with the winter chill in the air it was nice to have the oven on.
I used boneless breasts. I marinated them in the sauce for about 6-8 hours then baked them in the oven at 350.
I did not use all the marinade, just drizzled a little on the top. Only suggestion use foil or a disposable pan.

When I made this I doubled the recipe and used my larger crock pot.  I reduced the cooking time about an hour and a half, as this newer crock pot seems to cook hotter, and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  I substituted half Braggs Aminos for the soy sauce  and removed the chicken after cooking and thickened the sauce with cornstarch, I then replaced the chicken, broke it up and served it over rice.  I personally found it a bit salty, although still tasty; my family loved it and second portions were had by several.  It was a quick (minus cooking time)  and easy meal to feed a larger group.  I will make it again, probably completely substituting Braggs Aminos for the soy sauce.

VERY GOOD!  I used garlic powder as I didn't have fresh garlic, added brown sugar, and thickened with cornstarch.  I tasted as I prepared so it was to our liking.  Served over rice and broccoli, it was delicious!  I will make again and cut down on the soy sauce to make it a little less salty.  Thank you, Myrna, for sharing your recipe!

It turned out great! The meat fell off the bone on the plate and really tasted great with the sides (couscous and broccoli). I only had it in for about 5 1/2 hours and that was plenty. Any more and I think it would have been too dry. Will definitely make again!

Made exactly as the recipe was written.  I find it a little too heavy on the soy sauce, although the chicken was well cooked.  Didn't care for the taste, won't make this one again.

Well, this is the first time I've ever rated a recipe negatively. I think I can now say that any recipe that calls for catsup should be suspect. I believe this recipe reminds me of consuming fresh zombies basted in a broth of their own squish. You contemplate digging your tongue out of your mouth with the sharpest knife you can find. You wonder to yourself - is it just me? I guess it could be so... After a great deal of thought I would have to say -  do yourself a favor, walk away from this recipe as fast as you can. cheers!

This was awesome! I put some fresh broccoli in during the last couple hours of cooking and served with rice. Also thickened the sauce a bit with cornstarch. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly like it is. It is good but I feel it a little salty. I will make it again but with low sodium soy sauce or less amount of regular soy sauce.

Absolutely delicious. Didn't have much time so cooked mine on high for 3 hours. Couldn't find boneless, skinless chicken thighs at my local store so removed the skins myself beforehand. Chicken falling off the bone, perfect. Huge hit with entire family. Very simple to make. Perfect for a day when you are busy or out of the house. Highly recommend. I served it with basmati rice and sugar snap peas sautéed in garlic and olive oil.

My husband and I both love this dish. I used bone-in chicken thighs and the meat fell off the bone. The only small change I would make is using a little less soy sauce, but that is only for personal tastes. I will definitely be making this again. It would make a great "company" meal.

I often laugh at the comments that say things like, "even the pickiest eater loved it."   My 10-year old son is the PICKIEST of eaters, and I've failed to impress him with countless recipes.  

HE LOVED THIS RECIPE!!  I made it 'as-is' (no changes), and he ate up every bite.  Everyone in my family loved it.  In fact, I'm making it again tonight.  :)

It was easy -- that's the best part. And you can pair this with a lot of different vegetables and starches.  However, the flavor is a bit too sweet, the quantity of sauce is simply too much, and overall, it's fine but not all that interesting.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this recipe was and how tasty the chicken came out. I used the leftover sauce to pour over a little Jasmine rice. The recipe was a little sweet for me so I think I'll half the amount of honey next time, but will definitely be making this again.

SOOO yummy... I added some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  I also cooked it for only three hours on high... turned out amazing.  Read to add a little cornstarch which thickened the sauce up nicely.  Definitely remaking soon!

 Loved the sauce! Thanks.

This is super super yummy! I used 2 lbs of thighs out of the case. They were HUGE, so although it was 6 pieces, I think they would have equaled 8 smaller pieces that you might typically find in pre-packaged meat. 

I followed the measurements exactly. I also added fresh ground ginger (Maybe a generous tablespoon).  There was plenty of "sauce" and I served it with Jasmine rice.  I've made this several times and it's always so easy and tasty!

This was good, but I was disappointed that it did not taste more like a traditional honey-garlic flavour. I even doubled the amount of fresh garlic and added a teaspoon of garlic powder! I may make this again, however, as it was very simple to put together with ingredients I always have on hand. The flavour was good, not outstanding. The family ate it all, had seconds even... no complaints.

Not good at all. Way too salty and the chicken came out black from the soy sauce. Perhaps I did something wrong but I followed the recipe verbatim and I couldn't even eat this dish.

The first time I made this, it burned the chicken and crock a little. The second time, I doubled the recipe and the increased liquid made a huge difference and was perfect.

This was such a great recipe! Delicious and easy to make! I thickened the sauce with corn starch, as I saw other reviews that recommended this. I added raw broccoli and mushrooms to a baking dish and baked the chicken with everything in the sauce for about 50 minutes at 350. Turned out great, I will definitely be making this again!

I followed the instructions exactly as noted and it came out delicious! The only thing I did that was not in the directions, was I made a slurry of corn starch and a little bit of water and added it to the sauce after the chicken was cooked to thicken the sauce. That's it!

Simple and wonderful! I had a fleeting moment of worry as I removed the chicken from the slow cooker that I hadn't salted or peppered, then remembered the recipe didn't call for it! There's plenty in the soy sauce and ketchup. It was quick, easy, and my husband and I both loved it! If only I could have printed the recipe to work from so I didn't have to soil the screen of my phone. But the Allrecipes phone app doesn't allow/provide it. ??

Fairly good, but lacked something.  I added some sriracha when I reheated the leftovers and that helped.  Maybe adding some dried red pepper would help?

Made it the first time, per the recipe, and it was a huge hit - even the leftovers were outstanding. I just made it again, but substituted the honey for Sweet Chinese Chili Sauce,  and it really brought the oriental flavor to the party. Going to try it next with chicken wings!

This was delicious and so easy!  I just put everything in the slowcooker and mixed the ingredients with the chicken very well.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours.  I used the same amount of sauce and family size pack of boneless chicken thighs.  I added an extra garlic clove and black pepper.  Next time for an extra kick, I would add a little bit of crushed pepper flakes.   I give this 4.5 stars only because I need the extra kick to my dish!  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe!

The chicken was very tender, but the soy sause was overwhelming.  My husband and I felt it needed  more sweetness. I served duck sauce on the side for dipping which helped, but I wouldn't make this dish again.

I did use ground pepper, onion salt ,basil, oregano and parsley on top of the chicken. Used 5 1/2 thighs. Used more garlic that I chopped up. Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and low sodium soy sauce.  Stir once or twice to make sure sauce is covering chicken or edges will get browned. Made with brown rice and steam broccoli as it was suggested by others. Very happy and husband enjoyed it!   It was not salty. Might try the 1/2 cup chopped onion next time, will make again.  Cooked for 4 hours on slow.

First thing I have made off this site that was horrible.   Ingredient measurements are way off so the sauce was like soup and I even used 6 chicken thighs instead of the 4 that was posted.
 Glad I used a slow cooker liner because it was easy to pull the bag out and throw it straight into the garbage.

We made this over the weekend and served with couscous and veggies. Very tasty.  We are going to try adding different ingredients - sesame seeds, onions, etc -just to dress it up to look even more appetizing but it is easy and came out yummy with minimal work!

I was looking for a quick, easy to throw in the crock pot meal so I gave this one a try and it didn't disappoint! I use the frozen boneless, skinless thighs and I use 6 per meal and double the recipe for the sauce. It probably doesn't need doubled but I like the meat covered by the sauce. I didn't change any of the ingredients or add anything else, it didn't need it. My whole family loves it!

All the 5 star reviews had me excited for this one, as it is very easy to throw together. I made the recipe as is. In the end I took out my chicken and slightly thickened the sauce to spoon over the chicken and rice I served it with. It was very bland! I tasted it and added more salt...still bland...so I added more sweetness with another bit of honey...still bland...so I added a few Tablespoons of purchased teriyaki sauce, but it was still just so bland. Not disgusting or offensive in any way, and my kids did eat it, but my husband and I were not impressed. I will keep searching or a tasty chicken thigh recipe.

So good!  The only thing that was different is I had bone in thighs.  Cooked a little less time and was perfect!  So tender, fell off the bone when we ate.  Made it twice in the last couple weeks.

This was really good, but I did make 2 small changes based on the reviews I read.  Don't cook it for more than 4 hours in the crock pot.  Any more than 4 hours would have resulted in dry chicken.  I also used low-salt soy sauce, which was perfect.  We will definitely have this again!

If you like honey -teriyaki  barbecue, you'll love this.  Just a bit too sweet for me, hence the 4 stars. I'll cut down on the honey or add some vinegar next time. I used 6 boneless, skinless thighs and didn't thicken nor strain the sauce, yet it was still perfect for  the rice.

Very good.  I used 1.5 times the recipe for 14 thighs and there was lots of sauce.  Also added 2 tsp. Dijon mustard and 1/2 tsp. Chili pepper flakes and some fresh ground pepper.  Cornstarch slurry at the end is a must.

I was excited to make this. It used so many things I already had on hand and it sounded like it would be delicious. My chicken turned out pretty well. It was a little dry on top, but not as dry as other commenters mentioned. My problem was the taste. The combination of ingredients didn't work for me and I couldn't finish the meal. I do recommend low-sodium soy. I used it and it was still pretty salty.

A delicious slow cooker chicken recipe.  Just thicken the sauce a little at the end and serve with basmati rice. An easy recipe to make that everyone will enjoy.

Made this for the 1st time ... followed the recipe, but felt there was a lot of sauce.  After cooking for 3 hrs., because of the smell, I felt I better check the meat .. glad I did.  It was at 165* so turned the pot off, but left meat in for another 45 min.  And, there was a LOT of sauce.  Next time I will do like others, and add more meat, or make less sauce.  We felt the flavor was wonderful, not too salty (low salt soy).  May be helpful to also add the wt. of chicken used.  Will make again with these adjustments.  Served with rice and fresh vegies.

This is a great easy recipe!  I had all but the thighs on hand so that was all I had to buy.  I put it all together just like the recipe said and cooked it on high for 2 1/2 hours like another reviewer suggested.  They came out very tasty!  I served it up with Basmati brown rice and sautéed vegetables.  Terrific quick dinner!

Not really my cup of tea. However, my family enjoyed it immensely, hence the three star rating. To it's benefit, the texture was incredible and it was visually appealing. To anyone worrying about the strange mix of ingredients, I assure you they work well together despite how I felt about the final meal.

I doubled the recipe.  The next time I make it I am going to cut the soy sauce in half and add pineapple juice to make up the difference.

Solid recipe. A little more garlic doesn't hurt, and be generous with the dried basil.

Awful, very salty, think this may be from the overpowering taste of soy sauce. Couldn't taste honey or garlic - which you would expect due to the name of the dish. Kids and hubby didn't like it either.

This was a very solid recipe! I made it with eight chicken thighs. I expanded the recipe a little bit since it only called for four chicken thighs. I added some baby carrots since I had them on hand.  I removed the chicken thighs and put them in a glass dish and broiled them for five minutes to crisp up the thighs and it made a huge difference, I believe.  It did look exactly like the picture on the recipe. Some  of the reviews said it was too salty, but it would only be too salty if you kept adding the sauce to  other side dishes. I had quite a bit of sauce left over, but I did not use it.  This recipe could be used for any number of meats. It's a keeper!

This was pretty good the first go around, but I would make some alterations for next time.   First the sauce is too salty and there's WAY WAY WAY too much sauce at the end.   Either add 3X on the chicken or cut the sauce in half using maybe low sodium soy.   I probably doubled the amount of thighs (since 4 thighs is not that much) and still I had a pool of leftover sauce.   It's not a show stopper, but it's easy, which is probably why it made the "best of 2016" recipe list.

It really is a great recipe and very simple. You can bump this up to 6-8 thighs and add a bit more of each ingredient and it's still great! Just make sure chicken is submerged in sauce.  I've also made this on the stovetop with great results. Just browned the chicken ahead of time..  Great served over noodles or rice or quinoa, or polenta of all things!!!

This recipe is delicious, just found it made way too much sauce for so few thighs. I would cut back on the sauce next time and just do them in the oven.

Very good and I would make again. Only complaint is that it was pretty salty, maybe next time I will use a little less soy sauce. I had doubled the sauce to serve over rice.

I don't understand how it looks so browned in the picture. Is there a step missing where you put it under the broiler after the slow cooker? It didn't brown at all, looked nothing like the picture accompanying the recipe.

The whole family loved it. We set the crock-pot on high for 2 hours and then on low for 2 hours and it was falling off the bone. Lots of flavor. Served this with Uncle Ben's brown rice with and frozen green beans. Easy!

Barely edible-- so salty!!  And I LOVE salt!!  This was gross!!!I followed the directions exactly.  It was awful- I ate it because I was hungry.  Thank goodness I made jasmine rice (without salt) on the side to minimize the salt taste!! EGH!!!

Very delicious, the meat fell right off the bone. Every one in my family loved and it was very easy to make. I finished working while it cooked and checked on it periodically. I did add  twice the amount of honey to cut down the salt. Very good recipe!

This did not go over well in my house.  I don't think the large amount of soy sauce was good.  While it cooked, the house smelled awful- that should have been a sign!  We will not make this again.

We liked it - easy, tasty using five skinless, boneless thighs and one beast half.  Cooked on high for four hours.  Served over rice with side salad.

Followed the recipe exactly adding ingredients without measuring . Used breasts and thighs and brought to work for a group lunch. Simple and easy to make and very tasty. Don't need to change anything! Thicken the sauce and serve over the chicken.

Super easy, and very tasty, but I need to work on the timing in the crock pot, they were on low for 8 hours and came out a bit over done.

I am not a big cook but have been trying slow cooker recipes. I followed the directions for 6 servings exactly and wasn't impressed. The sauce was very bitter. My husband ate it but I didn't like it. I think it was the soy sauce that made it really bitter. I was expecting a more sweet chicken but didn't get that.

Oh gosh, I've been wanting to try this recipe and finally did last night...I could not have been more disappointed. I followed it directly and was horrified at the results. There are much better chicken thighs slower cooker recipes. I suggest you try one, bit certainly not this one.

This isn't *sensational* but it's tasty and very easy - it fits the bill when I need to throw something in the crockpot in the morning and have it make itself for dinner.  I sometimes throw a few carrots in, as well.  I always use boneless/skinless chicken thighs, and serve over rice.

Quite good. I used low sodium soy sauce, a nice dollop of garlic paste instead of mincing the garlic, and I didn't have basil so I left that out. I also used bone-in chicken thighs. The family liked it a lot, it's a make-again.

2nd time making it today.  The first time we were at our Daughter's and with no crock pot we did them in the oven with sauce over them the last half hour.  Today I have them in our slow cooker and added lemon zest to the sauce.  I'll be using this sauce on pork and chicken over the grill next summer!

Definitely NOT good. I ate most of it because I hate to waste food but this was very much NOT good. On low chicken was overcooked around 5 hours. The thighs would've tasted better with just salt and pepper. I won't be making this again.

This was unfortunately, just mediocre. I'm not sure how to make it any better, but it was too sweet and as with a lot of slow cooker recipes not crispy for my taste. Would not make this again

My wife requests these chicken thighs quite often.  I usually adjust the quantities upward, as these make a good meal to share with others.  They are always moist and flavorful, and they melt in your mouth.  The flavor from the sauce is wonderful, and these are especially good as leftovers, if there are any!  The batch I am in the process of making consists of (6) chicken thighs, which is the smallest batch I have made.  I usually make between (12) and (18) thighs at a time, but I have not had to increase the amount of sauce, which is why they never come out looking like the photo.  If you want to make a chicken dish that people will request on a regular basis, this is it!  I think I will thicken up the sauce, as some have requested, and spoon it over rice.  This recipe is a keeper!

I slow cooked 6 chicken thighs and followed the  recipe as written.  It turned out really soupy and the chicken was over cooked.  I added corn starch to thicken the liquid but it took so much starch that it made the chicken and sauce taste starchy.  I'm so disappointed.

Totally disappointed.  I followed the recipe.  I always use low sodium soy sauce.  It tasted ok, but was done WAY before the 6 hours.It looked NOTHING like the picture.  It was falling apart chicken in a soup. I'm looking for recipes that I can put on in the morning and they are not dust  when I get home 10-12 hours later.  I'll keep looking.

I made this dish using my pressure cooker. I seared off the meat, added the sauce, & 25 minutes later, dinner was served! The sauce was tasty & the meat was very tender. This will be added to our regular dinner rotation.

I have been using all recipes for several years now and have never found a bad one...until now.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I cooked eight pieces of chicken instead of the recommended four.  I put in the slow cooker on low for six hours.  When I got home, the smell was terrible.  The chicken was charred so badly we couldn't eat it.  I think the flavor of the marinade was good, but I would recommend baking the chicken in the oven instead of using the slow cooker.

Giving it 4 stars because I found it a bit dry even though I cooked it for 4-1/2 hours which is a lot less than the written time.  Next time I'll cook it for only 4 hours on LOW and see how it turns out.  Other than that, it was good and I followed the recipe as written.  However I did add a mixture of corn starch and water to thicken the juices.  Did 2 TBS corn starch to 1/2 water but will add more corn starch next time to thicken it just a bit more.

This was the best dinner and so easy!!! I substituted balsamic vinegar for  the soy sauce (because I didn't have soy sauce) and also added some apple cider vinegar and it was so delicious! I will definitely be making this again!! I loved that I didn't have to cook the chicken thighs before I put it in the slow cooker! ( I used 12 boneless, skinless thighs). thank you All recipes for posting this recipe! YUM! My entire family loved it! I served it with broccoli, carrots over rice-soooooo good!!

Spectacularly easy, and very tasty! I did 2 batches of this, and am storing the meat for future use - some with the sauce over rice in individual-sized freezer containers, and some for use as its own dish with veggies/soups on the side. Thanks for sharing this one!

The flavors were great and I have a slow cooker that has a probe that you set for an internal temp of the chicken and then it switches to "warm" mode so as not to over cook chicken. I used breasts instead of thighs. My disappointment was that this recipe didn't make a glaze. It made a soup. It was purely liquid. I was hoping to not have any additional work on the meal with it being a crock pot meal. But I had to take the "soup" out of the crock pot and heat it with cornstarch on the stove to thicken it to a glaze, brush it onto the chicken, and cook in the oven to set it. I did put carrots and sliced baby reds in the crock pot with the chicken as well, and added some green beans the last 30 minutes. Served over quinoa.

Made this exactly as described and set slow cooker on low for 8 hours until the chicken thighs were fully cooked through. I made a side of basmati rice cooked with 1/2 water 1/2 chicken stock as well. Big hit with everyone, even my 4 year old.

I cooked it almost exact except for a few things. I used 4 cloves of garlic, a spritz of Sirachia , 3 tbsp of flour, and some parsley. I also used 6 thighs and cooked it only for 4 hours. It was very juicy and a wonderful sauce.  Definitely a  keeper.

I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  This might be the easiest and quickest slow cooker recipes I've made.  The chicken tasted great and because it was so quick and easy to make I give it five stars.  I will make it again.  Did I mention it was really quick and easy?

This is a great recipie and so easy to make.  It smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  I don't like ketchup so I used a bet less than called for.  Also I added crushed red pepper,  parsley,  and rosemary after the chicken was cooking.  This recipe is definately a keeper.  Can't wait to make it again.

I was not very pleased with the sauce or flavor. I followed the recipe except for the fact I substituted bbq sauce for ketchup, hoping to add more flavor. I was not impressed. Best of luck to all who try this. Happy Cooking!

I took lots of tips, including chopped onion, ginger, red pepper flakes (spice is excellent in this). And an hour before it was done I drizzled it with sesame oil and added sesame seeds. I even used bone-in thighs, and the whole thing was incredible. Thanks for the recipe AND for the tips!!

If you love salty, tender chicken then this is it. It was so easy and I didn't change a thing. I served it over rice. Delicious!!

Very good, very easy to make.  I thought it was going to be sweet and it was not.  Very balanced flavors.  I had a lot of liquid left over last time so next time I will use a few more and I do not think it will take away from the flavor at all.

I agree with other the other reviewers... this recipe is overwhelmed by the taste of soy sauce and is very salty.  My boneless thighs were overcooked on low in 3 1/2 hours based on meat temperature gauge so be sure to check. Won't be making this again.

This is so easy to make.  I follow the directions exactly, except that it is usually done around 4.5 hours instead of 6 even on the low setting.  The chicken turns out so moist, it's delicious.  It's become a "go to" recipe!!

Followed the instructions. It was pretty dry after being put in the fridge. Advice is prolly to eat it right away. Won't make the chicken again but the sauce was great to go on veggies or rice

This was so good!  I used 6 thighs but kept the sauce the same.  It makes lots of sauce, but it turns out 6 thighs don't go very far when you're looking for something to eat throughout the week too.  Next time I'll make this with 4 or 5 chicken breasts; I think it would be just fine and would make a little more meat.

This was good.  As others recommended, I thickened up the sauce after it was done cooking, to pour over the rice.  I liked how easy it was and using normal staples in the kitchen.  I cooked on high for 4 hours and it did seem that the chicken was a little over done, as they were a little dry.

Waaaay too salty. Can't distinguish any flavors in the sauce except for the soy sauce. Recommend cutting back on the soy and increasing the honey, garlic,  and ketchup. Also, such a small amount of basil makes it completely indistinguishable.

Few modifications I made: used bone in/skin on thighs. Meat was falling off the bone - didn't even need a knife. Cooked on high for 2:30 instead. Chopped a small white onion and dropped in with chicken from the start. Added a shake of red pepper flakes to the seasoning/sauce. When it was done,  I put the thighs skin down in a medium hot frying pan to sear the skin and make it crispy (took less than a minute). Added cornstarch to sauce at the end. Served with jasmine rice and the garlic broccoli recipe on here (roasted in oven).  Whole family scarfed it down including my 1.5 year old! Enjoy :)

Meh, I followed the recipe exactly and I find it to be seriously lacking.  There are much better recipes on here.  The fact I can go to the store and buy a Honey Garlic sauce that tastes much better than this did is pretty sad.  I definitely won't be using this recipe again.  First time I've been this disappointed in a recipe from this site that is rated 4+ stars out of 5.

As others mentioned, it does come out a bit soupy but can be thickened up easily. While the overall flavor is reminiscent of teriyaki, the soy is too prominent and the garlic non-existent. I will try this recipe once more but will half the soy, add two more cloves of garlic, some red pepper flakes, and maybe a tablespoon of brown sugar so the sweetness comes out a bit more. 
Chicken in a slow cooker is always fall apart. Ain't nothing wrong with that.

I doubled the recipe, it made a lot of sauce! Served over rice with green beans as the side. My usually picky toddler gobbled this up! It's a winner and I will definitely be making it again! Next time I'll try with chicken breast and see what happens!

This was so easy and delicious.  This was a nice surprise for my husband.  He loved it! (so did I).  I would make this again!  I was late in planning the dinner so I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it was fine.

3.5 stars. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender, which you'd expect from slow cooker chicken thighs. But the soy  flavor was overpowering to me. I ate it, but I'm not in a hurry to make it again. One of my kids and my husband really liked it, but my other two sons complained. They ate it, but don't want me to make it again.

I noticed that the flavor was a little strong on the first night, but the chicken tasted perfect on the following night as leftovers. Overall, I think it was a great recipe but I will probably play with the ratio of sauce to meat a little more in the future. The only concern I have otherwise is that the cook time did allow for a little toughness on the edges of a couple pieces of the chicken.

Would have been great if t wasn't for the ketchup. I was skeptical about adding it but with such great reviews I decided to follow the recipe exact. Big mistake! Don't add the ketchup, it's all you will taste. Definitely not a honey garlic flavor.

Excellent!  Made it twice!  I added a few extra thighs and used the same amount of sauce mixture. Only had to cook it 3 1/2 - 4 hours.   Otherwise they would have been too dried up.  Very very moist!  Will make again soon!

The cook time was a bit long.  I stopped it at 4.5 hours on low and it was slightly overdone but still really good.  I also added some carrots and they were cooked perfectly and were delicious in the au jus.

The first time I made this recipe I followed the ingredients and instructions. Since I have a kid who is allergic to soy, the second time I made it, I used a soy substitute and I got rave reviews from my whole family that it's much better with the soy substitute! The recipe to the soy substitute is http://allrecipes.com/recipe/92873/soy-sauce-substitute/

Did not make any changes however the next time I make it I will use less soy sauce to adjust the saltiness.  Otherwise I really enjoyed it along side a baked sweet potato.

Made exactly as recipe said except I cooked it on high for first two hours and then low for two hours for a total of four hours.  It was awesome!  Family loved it.  Served steamed carrots with it, which were great in the sauce.

This was cooked perfectly, meat falling off the bone, sauce thick and sticky and delicious. A big hit at my house! Will definitely make again. 6 hours on low in the crockpot was just right.

Note: I used chicken leg quarters and removed the skin and was out of ketchup so I substituted with tomato sauce/vinegar/sugar.

I made this the other night, and did not like it at all.   I left it in the crock pot longer than anticipated, due to work schedule.   The dish had a off burnt garlic taste, and the dish was not burnt.  I will try it one more time,  just to be fair.

Was disappointed with the sauce. More liquid then glaze for me. Although the sauce was good, was missing something to make me think it wasn't out of a bottle. Chicken tender but I always cook in crock pot so that was a given.

Absolutely amazing! I used low sodium soy sauce and I thought it was perfect.  Hubby thought it was still a little salty so next time I'll just use less soy.

This was good ! My husbands review  was keep the recipe. I would use less soy sauce next time. I added some orange marmalade to reduce the taste of the soy sauce . Next time I will reduce the soy sauce and add a spoon full of marmalade.

It was ok... I cook the chicken on low and I felt it was over cooked. I did add some pineapple which I thought was a nice flavor and texture. I think next time I will add some veggies.

Made this tonight...4 bone in thighs, cooked on low for 3 hours, perfection! Recipe could definitely use a little kick so maybe some red pepper flakes, as suggested next time. Even my little one, the chicken nugget girl, practically licked her plate clean! Great, simple, delicious recipe

I made the recipe just as written, except used chicken breasts.  Did not like it.  The chicken was too dry and the sauce unusable because it was too greasy.  Will not make it again.

For something with so few ingredients, it came out surprisingly delicious. Used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, then removed from the bones and shredded on a plate. Poured the sauce into a fat separator to easily pour the sauce without that layer of chicken grease. Served with plain white rice. Next time I'd probably double the sauce - we all like a lot of sauce.

Not sure if I cooked it wrong, considering I followed all the directions.  But it was definitely too salty and did not look anything like the pictures.  But it didn't taste awful either.

While my butcher didn't have chicken thighs, he had a dark chicken roast. I made the recipe as specified, but cooked it in the oven at 260 for three hours.  I sliced it the next day and reheated it in the sauce and it was amazing!!

This was awesomely delicious the only change I made was instead of a slow cooker I baked it at 450 for about 50 minutes turning them at half way. The whole family devoured them in what seemed like seconds.

A great, easy recipe!  We aren't crazy about Asian food but hubby agreed to try as it sounded like a nice change of pace for a busy weekend dinner.  I only had 2 chicken thighs but halved the other ingredients, though I used low sodium soy sauce.  Didn't cook as long due to less volume.  I removed the chicken to shred for tacos.  Amazingly tender and moist!  As one topping option I also had drained crushed pineapple.  I will be making this again very soon and will double the original recipe to freeze some for a another meal!  Thank you Myrna for sharing this amazing recipe!

Perhaps my thighs were too small. They absorbed too much of the sauce and cooked in only 2 1/2 to 3 hours on low in my slow cooker. The chicken tasted okay but too much soy taste. Will try again with one half the sauce recipe and see how that turns out. I did like having all the ingredients handy.

Very good and not too salty for our palate. Served with fried rice. I added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. My picky wife (picky BC she has a sophisticated palate and rarely likes 3-4 ingredient dishes) really liked this.  I'll make this again and shred the chicken and make spicy Thai tacos.

I really liked this. It was easy to make and has good flavor.  You could use this chicken for other recipes, not just a main dish. I'm going to cut it up and try it with homemade eggrolls this weekend. As a main dish, I would like the sauce to be thicker. I would also cut the low-setting cook time by 1-2 hours.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I believe it would have been good had I not messed it up!  Here's what not to do:  Don't use breasts unless you add more moisture;  Don't use a large crock pot unless you double or triple the recipe.  Trust me on these points...things did not go well.... :)

I made this and i was not impressed. Per the reviews I replaced ketchup with bbq and only added 1/4 cup soy sauce. The flavor on the chicken was lacking. The sauce itself had flavor but It wasnt a complex exciting flavor that ignited my taste buds. Plus, I did not taste the garlic flavor at all.

This was so easy and delicious, I used 6 large drumsticks, and doubled the garlic, didn't have basil so I left it out and used low sodium soya sauce.  Also threw in onions and mushrooms.  Everyone loved it and will definitely make it again.

Not a hit with my husband, way too salty.  It was just okay for me too.  I think I would have enjoyed it more as a grilling sauce, since slow cooking chicken in the sauce made it way too salty and rich.

This was an easy recipe to make and I was able to put everything in the crock pot before work, even with mincing fresh garlic it didn't take too long!  However, the sauce was pretty strong and overpowering when it was done (this may also be due to a little over cooking since it cooked during my work day). Next time I make it I will add some chicken broth to make it less intense. Easy to make and great for a quick recipe- so I will make it again!

Perfect way to have Asian chicken!  Loved the sauce. I took the lid off the crock pot with 2 hours to go to thicken the sauce. It was great chicken the sauce was not over powering on soy sauce or honey. Just the perfect blend of ingredients.

This is simple and my family of  picky eaters were happy with it.  I used Kung pao sauce for half of he soy sauce and it satisfied the need for something to add depth of flavor. I agree with the folks who added brown sugar because mine came out kind of sour. I'll add that next time because  I'm  definitely making it again.

Cooking for one, I halved the recipe and foil wrapped the ingredients for easy clean-up in the crockpot.  
I was pleased with the results - 2 meals for me.  However thought the taste of the soy sauce overpowered the rest of the ingredients and will reduce that further the next time.

I Did not make any changes other than I added 2 more thighs.  Was not impressed as the chicken was  overcooked.   There was plenty of sauce etc, but it was dry even with the bone in.

I followed the recipe as directed.  It turned out very well.  I thought it was a bit on the sweet side, but my husband, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, really liked it.  My son and his fiancee' also enjoyed it.  It will make a good "go to" recipe.  I put it together before leaving for work.  No muss no fuss.  Just my kind of crock pot recipe!

This was tasty, albeit salty, and way overcooked. I may try again using the low sodium soy and maybe just 4 hours.  I loved the ease of the dish.

We followed the recipe as directed but cut down the cooking time to 4 hours based on the suggestions here. Chicken still came out a bit overcooked and the flavor was just so-so. My family gave it a "C" and I agree  -- edible but not memorable.

Made it according to recipe. It was totally done after only 4 hours on low. It would have completely killed and too dry if cooked 6 hours. Overall the family really like it. Unanimous thumbs up.

I made it as given, but doubled it because of the number of thighs I had, figuring I'd freeze the leftovers, which I did.  My only  comment would be that it was a little salty for our taste, but I had only regular soy sauce on hand (that someone else picked up at the store for me).  I usually buy low sodium soy sauce, so next time I make this I will use the low sodium soy sauce and I think it will be great.  My husband loved it even though he agreed it was a bit salty.

I threw this together and shoved it in the oven instead of making it in the crock pot the next day as I had planned to do - and it was great!  Big hit -  I used bone in thighs as that's what I had on hand, used the same amount of garlic but otherwise  halved the sauce, used less salt (I always use less salt in recipes)  cooked it covered at about 375 for an hour in the oven, then uncovered it for a little while.  They were overcooked, so next time I'll shorten the time.   I also put some baking potatoes and a cut up wrapped in foil butternut squash in the same oven,  so viola, a simple tasty dinner with almost no hands on time.  There was enough sauce for 6 thighs in my opinion.  Not sure if I'll ever get around to trying it in the crock pot, but I'll definitely be making this again.   Next time I'll grate some fresh ginger in the sauce, it seems to need a little something zesty, although it's good as is. Looks pretty too, which is always a plus.

I am a teacher in Beijing, China. And this recipe reminds me of a lot of dishes that I can find in small restaurants. I changed two things. First, I found a package of drumettes in the market that I go to so I used them instead of chicken thighs. I kept the recipe as stated and the only other change I made was to pop the drumettes under the broiler for about 10 minutes. This was supposed to be my quick lunches for the week, but it was all I could do not to eat them in one sitting! Very savory and delicious!

I used 6 bone in skin on thighs, and same amount of sauce ingredients. I don't have a slow cooker, so I cooked it in the oven on 325° for about 1.5-2hrs, then high broil for about 10 min to crisp the skin. Served it with Jasmine rice and fried cabbage.. Family loved it! I also strained the sauce at the end and thickened with cornstarch, for rice gravy. I didn't use it, but those who did really liked it

I made this following the instructions listed. I made only a few changes which include half of a sweet onion, a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger (but could up it to 3/4 tsp next time), 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes (but could increase it to 3/4 tsp next time). It only took a little over 3 hrs in the crockpot on high, I took it out an broiled it for a few minutes after spooning some of the sauce in it. I thickened the sauce remaining in the crock pot with corn starch & used my stick blender to cut break up the onions. I served with baby peas & brown rice & a nice red blend of wine. Very good, both my BF and family enjoyed it. Will be making this again.

Sorry, but the ebd result was Odd flavors that didnt go well together.  Couldnt taste the garlic or honey, just ketchup, soy and basil....very unappetizing combo. i ended up tossing out the sauce and tried to save the chicken with yoshita's.

Very good! So simple to make but very tasty. I added a couple  teaspoons of Chinese garlic chile paste to spice it up a bit and served over Ramen noodles along with corn and peppers on the side. I will be making this again very soon!

I got a late start so I cooked this on High for 3 hours instead of 6 hours on low.  The chicken was melt in your mouth tender, the sauce was to die for, and my husband had THREE pieces of chicken.  This recipe is a keeper at my house!

This sounded so good I made a double batch using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. It was not good at all. It was really salty and greasy and not sweet at all, even though I used a little more honey than the recipe called for. I ended up throwing it all out. Don't bother with this one.

Quick, easy and delicious! I did add more garlic than the recipe called for only because we love garlic, and like a few others, I thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end. I'm giving it 4 stars because although it did have an amazing flavor, it was quite salty. I will most definitely make this again but cut the soy sauce measurement back some.  Thanks for sharing!!

Followed the recipe but added corn flour to thicken sauce as others advised. There were empty plates all round, even from the picky eaters.

Not sure if I have an extra hot slow cooker or if it is bigger than most but followed the recipe and took them out with 45 min left on the timer and they were wayyyy over done :( (dry and starting to burn). Was definitely on low. Use your judgement and don't trust the time!

I really wanted to love this recipe but first I had only cooked it for 3  hours. the chicken was overdone and the sauce was overpowering. Very strong. Will not make it again.

I followed the recipe to a "T" but  the chicken was in the slow cooker for about 9 hours.  Unfortunately the sauce and chicken was burned.  If I had only left it in for the 6 hours as stated in the directions, it may have turned out ok.  My advice is keep and eye on this in the slow cooker after the 5 hour mark.

Taste was fantastic!  I used a whole cut-up chicken, skin & fat removed, but same amount for sauce. When chicken was done I removed from crock & thickened the sauce slightly with cornstarch. I then shredded the chicken & put back in sauce. Great over toast, baked potato or rice!! My husband was s bit leary of trying it but he really liked it. Will definitely make again.

Superb recipe, I added 2 tbsp of corn starch at the last hour to thicken up the sauce.

Was a HUGE hit!!

NOTE: I ALWAYS use low sodium soy sauce to cut down on salt intake

Loved this recipe.  It was so easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I did use six boneless skinless thighs and doubled the garlic.  It was terrific.

I made this the other night and, although we liked the flavor, the chicken was pretty dry.  I don't see how that can be because they were sitting in all that yummy juice.  Also, I put the entire thing together in a crock-pot cooker bag and put in the fridge overnight to make things easier in the morning.  Don't see how that could make a difference, though.  Also, I put it on around 7 a.m. and set it to switch to warm after 6 hours.  I got home around 5:30 pm so it was in there quite a while.  Maybe that was the problem.  Any suggestions?

I haven't made this yet but by the looks of the picture, you must have put them in the broiler after the slow cooker to get that crisp top.

After reading other reviews I added extra garlic, crushed red pepper, and ginger. When the chicken was cooked, I gradually stirred in flour for a thicker sauce. With those changes, the recipe was spicy-sweet with a nice sticky sauce.

Absolutely love this recipe!  The first few times I have made this, I doubled the sauce because I always had at least 8 thighs.  There is no need to double the sauce as one batch of sauce is plenty for 8 thighs.

Use low sodium soy sauce, my husband is sensitive to salty food and he loved this dish. I served over mashed potatoes, but next time I think rice would be even better. I did what another reviewer suggested and thicken up the sauce with some cornstarch to use lightly as a gravy.

Made this for my family while I was at work.   So simple/ easy to make!   Smelt wonderfully.   Came home ready to eat some and it was all gone.   Family loved it!   I will make again soon for them and myself. I did use boneless skinless thighs and lite soy sauce.  Thank you so much.
2-15-17. I have made this wonderful recipe several times now.  Always a perfect hit.   I do double the recipe every time.  I also take some of the sauce and poor it in to a sauce pan.  I add some floor to make a roux.  I pour roux back in to crock and mix it up.  This makes a great sauce to have on top of rice or mashed potatoes.  This is one of my families favorite recipes on this sight!  Love it.

Well received by even my pickiest eater! I served over white rice, alongside corn on the cob. I will definitely make this again, perhaps with a little extra garlic.

Too salty!  I suggest using half the soy sauce and adding pineapple to complement the dish.  Otherwise, it was a good dish.  I served it with sugar snap peas and basmati rice.

With my mother in the hospital, I had used up many of my quick meal ideas. When I saw this on Facebook, it seemed a good recipe to try. With this in the crockpot and rice in the cooker, I was able to time the meal for the hour we would arrive home. Aroma was great as we walked in the door and my husband loved it. With definitely add this to my list of favorite crockpot meals.

Excellent!!!! I used liquid amino acid instead of soy sauce. Still a bit too salty for our taste so less next time. We used 8 chicken thighs but kept same ingredient amounts. Sooo easy. I'm so thankful. Thank you!!!!!

Less ketchup, light soy to reduce the saltiness(medical reasons not taste) boiled in chicken broth or Better than Boullion. Small amount of unsalted butter keeps it from sticking if your work day is longer than the 6hr cooking time. Splash of rice wine vinegar. Dash of Red pepper Flakes. 

Seasoned the chicken with Garlic Powder prior to adding the broth. At the end pour the wet mixture into a bowl. Put back iin cooker. Chop green onions and add to chicken. Cover (can also add 2 or 3 green onions to broth while cooking. Will start to thicken and sauce will stick to chicken start by adding a tablespoon of butter to keep from sticking and to help sauce adhear and baste with sauce in bowl until ready to eat or cook off in oven for 15 min. Remember to baste so it seals in juices and doesnt dry out. I use breast and tenders along with thighs. You could use all cuts or a whole chicken too. Yummy. The honey helps ot adhear really well so you dont have to use the oven. Moist...keeper.

I made a few tweaks to this after reading reviews and it was awesome. I used six thighs but kept the sauce the same.   I used low sodium soy sauce and cut the amount in half.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  I also added in one green bell pepper sliced.  Put it on high in my crock pot for 3 1/2 hours, took the chicken out of the sauce, added corn starch in to the sauce to thicken it and drizzled it over the chicken on the plates.  It was a huge success and everyone loved it.

This was a great slow cooker recipe, even better that I had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  I only had chicken breasts and made a few of the changes recommended in the reviews - I added some red pepper flakes, ginger, black pepper, and a bullion cube.  After 1.5 hrs on low and 1.5 hrs on high, I removed the chicken then thickened the sauce with some flour and served this dish with brown rice and vegetables.  Yummy!

Was so simple and easy to make. Was surprised at how good it was. I took advice from other posts and used a slurry to thicken up the sauce and poured over the chicken and rice.

Delicious! Took it out of crockpot, poured a glass of wine, put sauce on stove to thicken,  warmed up brown rice, steamed peas, poured sauce over everything, refilled wine. Yum! Easy dinner after late night dance class! Will make this again!

I doubled the ingredients in the recipe and cooked on high for approximately 4 hours in my slow cooker. I checked the temperature of the chicken thighs to make sure they were done. The finished dish turned out great! My family really enjoyed the honey-garlic chicken with a side of basmati rice. So easy!

Everyone I've made this for loves it. I make it just as described mixing cooked rice right in to the sauce before serving. Don't know that I've ever made any dish that is as universally liked as this dish. Even my kids ask for it.

I enjoyed the salt level in the recipe. My kids don't even eat dark meat and ate it. I added some of what others added to perfect it.  So I doubled all the sauce stuff ketshup soy sauce honey garlic and the herbs. I added pepper flakes brown sugar as well. After cooking I put chicken in oven for 30'min drizzled sauce over the top. While chicken is cooking I added cornstarch to cold water mixed and added to thicken sauce.  Had wonderful taste. Don't add chicken tenders of course that will get hard.  I also used like 8 thighs and I cooked on high to get it done quicker. I served with chowmein noodles.  My noodles taste like panda. Good recipe. Soy sauce noodles brown sugar white pepper butter cabbage ginger garlic minced it's a really good dish.

I used 1/4 cup honey and low sodium soy sauce for ten small thighs. Was delicious. Will be in the rotation for sure. Can be adapted to make a meal for a lot of people on the cheep when served with a staple like rice.

I did as a few previous reviewers suggested, thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I did decrease the ketchup a little bit and added some Siracha to add a little bit of "kick".  I served with brown rice and steamed broccoli as a "bowl" . This is a keeper

Best crock pot chicken recipe yet and SO easy!  Entire family loved it.  I only had low sodium soy sauce so I used that.  I doubled the recipe.  Had frozen COSTCO bone in thighs that I just threw in the crockpot topped with the other ingredients.  A DEFINITE regular recipe in our house!  Thank you!!

These were just okay. It has a lot of potential....but just wasn't my taste as is. I will probably make them again with less ketchup and more honey to see if I can tweak it!

We did it with chicken breasts, turned out very dry. Maybe cooking it with thighs or cooking for less time would have resulted in a better finished product.

Turned out pretty well. We used 1/3 cup of low sodium soy so, we can control the salt level. The skin and bones were removed from chicken thighs at the tail end of the cooking and the chicken was shredded & returned to the crock pot to absorb the sauce. We thinned the sauce out with 1/4 cup of apple juice to create more of a thin, saucey consistency. It was quite tasty with white rice. The key is to skim the fat off of the sauce before returning the chicken to the crock pot. We ommited the basil. This recipe is easy to tweak & prepare. Happy cooking!

The actual dish is super good. But you have to change it up a bit...I would definitely put in less soy sauce and only the low sodium option.  Also, I would only put in a bit of ketchup. Have the thighs cook 4 hours instead of 6.

Very good.  I used 9 boneless skinless chicken thighs. They were frozen when I put them in cooked on low for 8 hours and they were perfect. The only changes I made to the recipe is I added 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar and about 1 tbsp of sesame oil to the sauce. The whole family loved it and we'll be making it again.

My kids want me to make this again, so it is a keeper.  I used a 1/4 cup of lite soy sauce only because that is all I had left in the bottle.  It turned out great.

My hubby and son rated this a 10. We rate our meals 1-10. I made the following changes: 1/ 2 cup honey on accident....,Liquid aminos instead of soy sauce , 9 thighs instead of 4, 5 garlic cloves instead of 3. No need to increase sauce when you add more thighs because it makes alot. I made basmati rice and sautéed broccoli with crushed garlic. This meal was a huge hit.

As a full-time student and full-time single father, it truly is no wonder why a crock pot is a blessing. I made this recipe last night because I happened to already have everything on hand it called for and let it cook all day, with the pleasing aroma stoking my sister's and her husband's envy. I always try to follow the recipe without any modifications on the first attempt and this recipe, as is, was just as good, although next time I might add some crushed red pepper. The thigh meat falls right off the bone so easily, and the sauce was delicious. I enjoyed this with some steamed vegetables. All in all, a pretty decent dinner.

I've made this a couple of times and I really like it. I modify it a little: I add a squirt of sriracha hot chili sauce to the mix. Crock pots differ, and I've found mine cooks this properly, on low, in about 4-and-one-half hours. I like to add a bunch of broccoli florets for the last half hour or so. I've made it with skin-on thighs, too, which makes quite a bit of liquid, which I mix with brown rice. Probably not great for the fat content, but I don't use it all, just a bit. I've also made it with skin-on chicken breasts, and it's good too, but you have to be careful not to overcook.

I had my young adult son make this today and he's one that will follow the recipe to the tee! We used bone-in thighs and I made fried rice to go with it (recipe found on this site). These were so delicious and so tender, fall off the bone tender! He/we decided that when we make these again we will use less soy sauce since we had so much sauce left over and it was a tad salty for me.

I used chicken quarters (pulled the skin off myself), as they were on sale, and used more garlic (can you ever have too much garlic?).  Thank goodness our teenage son wasn't home.  I put 5 leg quarters in the crockpot and my husband (who hates chicken) came for a second helping!  I put the crockpot on high for about 3 hours and the chicken was falling off the bone.  I served it with garden tomatoes, cucumbers and green beans. Yes, I will make this again!

My wife made this last night and it is now one of my favorite dishes.  It only took 3 hours to cook on high, so watch it carefully as 6 hours would be too long.  She made white rice to go with it and it was a perfect match.  The chicken fell off the bones and the sauce was so delicious, we could have eaten that with the rice by itself.  DELICIOUS!  Do your self a favor and make this simple recipe for your family.  Do your family a favor by making this delicious dish for them.  Everyone will be happy!

A quick tip to elevate this recipe to a whole new level of deliciousness... Brown the thighs in a pan with 2 Tbsp oil over high heat for 2-3 minutes per side. Then add them to the crockpot and follow the recipe as written. I read several reviews and can't believe no one mentioned this easy tip! It adds so much flavor to the chicken and the sauce.

Excellent.  The first time I made it, I used 8 chicken thighs and did not change the sauce - delicious but I was told there wasn't enough for 4 people!!  Making it again today with 15 chicken thighs and I did increase the sauce slightly.  Served with rice.  Easy and delicious

This was fantastic. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I couldn't taste the garlic or the honey. I added more garlic and honey and even a little bit of brown sugar. I usually make more for next day lunch.

This is a keeper! Made this dish yesterday and served it to my husband who is not crazy about chicken.  He hasn't stopped raving about how good it was. I sautéed onions and the chicken thighs first. Then transferred to the slow cooker. Added all ingredients and pineapple chunks and cooked on low for 6 hrs.  Will be making this again for sure!!

Family absolutely loved it! Ran out of soy sauce mid measurement, so swapped with a bit of terayaki and it turned out amazing. Decreased cook time, and finished under the broiler! Served over jasmine rice with stir-fry veggies.

I added 2 more tbsp of honey, 1 more clove of garlic, a few drops of worcestershire, tsp of Italian seasoning, and then corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce. I would make it again but I would only put maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup of soy sauce, 1/2 cup is WAY too much for my family. Served over rice, with a side of steamed corn.

I put in half the amount of soy sauce and it wasn't salty at all, turned out great! Put over white rice with the extra sauce! Will make again!

Made this dish for family and they loved it.  Adult grandson liked this over the chicken pot pie I didn't make.  Served it with steamed rice and mixed veggies.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe. No one has ever accused me of being able to cook, but this was too simple to screw up! Cooked 6 thighs with the quantity of sauce in the recipe and had enough left over to add a gravy thickener and spoon it over the rice. I'll be making this again!

It was really good! I deviated from the recipe a bit: I used 6 chicken thighs instead of 4, and added some cayenne for a little kick. I also defrosted my chicken before hand, so it was done cooking in 2 hours on low. It might take 4 hours if the chicken is frozen, it seems. I also reduced the amount of soy sauce and ketchup to 1/4 cup instead of 1/3 cup, and the saltiness level was perfect. I served it with some steamed broccoli and bread, and it was a hit for my dear boyfriend! I will made it again :)

Family loved it, even my super-picky 12 year old. Like others, I added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce when there was about 1 hour left, to thicken it up a bit. Will definitely make it again.

I found this recipe at dinner time, so I didn't have 6 hours for a slow cooker. Instead, I gave the thighs a hard sear in a cast iron skillet, then transferred them to a glass baking dish, poured the sauce on top, covered with foil so the sauce wouldn't splatter in the high heat, and baked at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes. Delicious!!!

To be fair, my husband really loved this dish.  My son and I thought it was just OK.   I used low sodium soy as suggested by others reviewers.  Frankly, I just wanted it a little sweeter.  I think I may try it one more time and add some brown sugar to the sauce.

I made this recipe with 6 bone-in thighs.  I cooked it on high for 5 1/2 hours and then thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.  Very easy & tasty!

I used four chicken thighs but cut back on the soy sauce and the ketchup, per other reviewers who stated it was "salty."  I certainly do not appreciate salty foods!

I used 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup honey, 1 tsp dried basil but doubled the garlic (just because I love garlic).  It was still A LOT of sauce in the crock pot.

In the last 1.5 hours of cooking (on low), I added a whole cabbage (cut lengthwise-for presentation) into the crockpot and placed the cabbage on the bottom (so the cabbage would cook faster) and set the thighs on top of the cabbage.  There was still enough sauce to not allow the thighs to dry out.

Having read other reviewers, I opted to cook only about 4.5 hours on low and the thighs were definitely cooked, but not overcooked so they were not dry, unlike some of the other reviews.

The thighs (and my cabbage) had good flavor but I still did think it was on the "salty" side, which is why I had the idea of putting the cabbage into the crock pot (so it would soak the sauce up a bit and have some vegetable on the side to go with the chicken).  I also made cous cous which my kids love.  They ended up simply mixing the chicken with the cous cous and cabbage and it was perfectly tasty!

I will definitely make it again but will reduce the soy sauce, ketchup and honey even less next time.  Maybe I'll add some fingerling potatoes to serve on the side as well...

I used my cast iron Dutch oven.  I cooked this in my regular kitchen oven at 350 degrees for 90 minutes.  Also, I used siracha catsup instead of the regular catsup.  It was delicious.

Really great recipe but I didn't cook for 6 hrs, 2 hrs on high was long enough.  Any longer would've made the chicken dry.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, came out great!

This was really easy to prepare, and tasted EXCELLENT! Started late, so put on high, and was ready in about 3 1/2 hours... As another reviewer mentioned, added cornstarch (removed chicken 1st) to thicken sauce... The hubby and I loved it! Will be making this a staple recipe.

I was out of honey so I substituted molasses.  I added canned sliced mushrooms. I served it over brown rice.  It was very good but next time I am only going to cook it for 4 or 4.5 hrs.  I also think this sauce would make a very good barbecue sauce on it's own.

My new go-to rice bowl recipe.  Moist and flavorful chicken.  I used the full value pack of boneless skinless thighs, omitted the basil.  Brown rice in the rice cooker, vegetables in the steamer and it was a yummy dinner for all ages.

1.  Used bone-in thighs (8) without changing glaze amount.
2.  Cooked on high for 3 hours
3.  Microwaved glaze for 1 minute before pouring over chicken.

I liked that I had the ingredients and that it was easy.  I left the skin on a couple of the thighs since this showed pictures with the skin.  I got home and realized that my slow cooker hadn't been plugged in, so had to cook them on high for 3 hours, and they were fine - totally cooked through.

What I didn't like is that, like so many slow cooker recipes, I ended up with chicken-thigh soup.  The meat ends up boiling vs. roasting.  I think if I made this again, I'd try it in the oven so that the glaze really sticks.

I loved it. Apon completion I placed the chicken in a casserole dish and set aside. Meanwhile To the broth, I added a teaspoon of garlic powder, a pinch of brown sugar, and a pinch of kosher salt for more flavor. I also added flour to the broth for a savory gravy to pour over the chicken then serve.  I used 10 skinless chicken thighs (bone in) with the same variation of ingredients.  Still came out very rich in flavor and amazing. I will definitely make this Again!

This was absolutely disgusting... The recipe called for 1/2 cup of soy sauce... That was the worst mistake ever. The chicken was black and didn't look appetizing at all. Not to mention it was extremely salty! Worst dish I've ever tried

I made it , but with regular chicken thighs, not boneless/skinless. It was wonderful! Next time I'll either do 6 or 8 thighs. There was ALOT of sauce, so I don't think I'd need to change those amounts.

This recipe was OK, but nothing special.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, but kept my eye on the chicken's temperature and the sauce's concentration.  As others have reported, the thighs were fully cooked after two hours and twenty minutes.  The sauce was thin but not watery, and I can see how it would become too salty if allowed to over concentrate.  I figured this was a case where the slow cooker just wasn't the right choice for this meal so I decided to give it another chance.  

I made it a second time, but this time I just used it as a guide to make a stir-fry.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cut them into bite sized pieces.  For the sauce I replaced the ketchup with an equal amount of Sriracha, and added a little fresh grated ginger.  A quick stir-fry, a little cornstarch slurry to thicken, and I had a great honey sriracha chicken.  

I'll definitely keep the modified sauce around, but as for the recipe as written?  Not going to bother again.

tried it for the first time and it was a big hit with the kids. I must say chicken haven't tasted so good in a long time. Kids said it won't be my last time cooking it.

This has become a favourite recipe when I'm going to be out all afternoon.  I follow the ingredients as listed although I put in 1/4 tsp dried thyme, a lot more garlic and hot chili flakes.  I also use low sodium soy sauce to cut the salt down. 

Like many others, I buy boneless, skinless thighs (my new go-to protein).  I saute an onion first for a few minutes, add the garlic and cook for another minute or two.  Then I add 12-16 boneless & skinless chicken thighs (no change to sauce quantity - there is plenty) and brown them.  Then I pour everything in a slow cooker and simmer for 1.5 - 2  hours.   Serve with basmati rice and your choice of veggie.  My family loves this dish.

This recipe is readily adaptable to other types of chicken pieces. I used leg & thigh with skin on . I covered for 30 min and then removed the cover for a further 30 minutes.

It was way too salty. To save this recipe, I would cut the soy in half, add tomato sauce along with the ketchup, add ginger and sesame, add a little more honey and a lot more garlic. I also followed someone's suggestion to then thicken the sauce with cornstarch over the stove and that was a good improvement. I would not make this recipe again unless I made some serious changes.

I have made this twice, the first time exactly to the recipe. It was good but sweet. The second time I made it with bone-in chicken thighs and added 1 T Sambal oelek and it was great. The kick from the Sambal toned down the honey nicely.

The chicken was moist, but the flavor came out bitter. I increased the thighs to 8 and changed it on the  system and followed those ratios.

I, personally, think 6-8 hours on low is way too long.  The chicken was a little on the dry side.  I even turned it to "keep warm" at 5 hours and it was still dry when I took it out at the 6th hour.  Otherwise, the flavor was awesome and was great over a bed of rice!

I made this recipe and the smell in my house was so yum, I knew it was a winner recipe. I made it exactly as written only thing I had a problem with was that the thigh meat was a little dry , the flavor was exceptionally delish. I cooked it low 6 hours my crockpot is an older model with glass lid . Anyone have any suggestions for the meat? I ended up shredding it and made pulled chicken and they ate it up lol. It's just I want to eat it whole with a side of rice and veggies . Thanks for the awesome recipe .

This was just o.k. - we ate and enjoyed (we were hungry), but I might try again and revise some the ingredients.  My crock pot seems to cook very strongly (even on low) so it seemed done in a few hrs. so I turned it off and reheated before serving and it really seemed to be overcooked.  The basil or garlic flavor did not come through like I would expect.  I "might" try it again, but 
not for awhile.

This was such an easy recipe and delivered great results.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Next time, I believe the chicken thighs only need to be in the crockpot for 4.5 hours.  When the thighs have been cooked too long, they tend to taste a bit dry.
I also followed another reviewer's suggestion by taking the cooked chicken out of the crockpot and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.
I will definitely be making this recipe again.

There was no flavor to the chicken, the sauce definitely requires thickening & it may be a good option for braising but not for  slow cooker.

It was delicious and made my house smell awesome! I used my nesco roaster oven on 350° for an hour and a half and it come out perfect! Nice n juicy! I did make a few changes. I used 1/4 cup ketchup 1/4 cup of soy sauce 1/2 cup of honey about 1/2 minced garlic. After about 45 minuets I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch mixed with two tablespoons of water to thicken the sauce. Came out awesome and my family loved it! Would definitely make it again!

I decided to use the sauce recipe but because of limited time, I baked in the oven. I put the chicken and sauce in a baking dish and covered with foil and baked at 350 degrees for an hour. Then uncovered and basted every 15 minutes for another 45 minutes. So very tender and moist!! Great flavor! Thank you for sharing!

This was yummy. It's cheap to make. I left the bone on so it would be moist. The sauce I cut in half bc I ran out of honey and there was still plenty, even extra that I spooned over noodles. Yum!

Really good recipe. The only thing i changed was that i used bone in and after it was done I put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Tasted great. Will make again.

Made it. Loved it.  Made a huge recipe with 14 boneless thighs in my slow cooker.  Everyone loved them.   I was mixing together the broth, and after tasting it, took a risk and added one different ingredient.   I added half a cup of smooth peanut butter.  Also, used lite soy sauce.  What a difference! It was subtle, and delicious. Just thought I'd throw that out there.

Made a few small changes but love making this in the slow cooker so it's ready after work. I use 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 3/4 cup of sweet Teriyaki instead of all soy sauce. Add a few 1/4 of brown sugar and a pinch of red pepper flakes.

It came out ok, but in the future I would lessen on the ketchup and honey as it was a bit to sweet. It also reminded my household of a sweet Chicken Adobo!

My house full of boys LOVED it! It has now become a regular meal at our house which no one gets tired of. I like to season and brown my chicken thighs which aren't skinless first then throw it in the slow cooker on low. It turns out perfect and always on point.

we like this recipe. my only issues is that it there is a slight burnt taste and lots of sauce leftover. it is more than likely my poor skills in the kitchen. 
  it is a great recipe one i have used many times.  I am not a fan of thighs,great in soup, but very good use of them with this recipe. thank you!

I made this recipe as directed.  My 5 and 3 year old who love all the ingredients in the recipe wouldn't touch the chicken or sauce (on rice).  The chicken was falling apart, however it turned out dry.  I would not make this again.

Was a little salty and greasy.  Would cut back on the soy sauce and use boneless, skinless chicken breast next time.  Did thicken the sauce and used over rice.

Pretty good and very easy. I found it a bit sweet and my chicken fell apart turning it into pulled chicken, which worked out just not what I was going for that evening. I will keep this around but just plan on making sandwiches or wraps with it.

Aside my crock pot being smaller than what was called for (mine is 2 1/2 quarts, but still worked perfectly), I had bone in chicken thighs on hand. The meat was falling off the bone and it was amazing. I served it over Jasmine rice and veggies. I'd definitely do it again!

This was very good and easy!  Didn't have soy sauce so I used a Soy Sauce Substitute recipe from this site (molasses, balsamic vinegar [didn't have balsamic so I used 5 parts regular vinegar to 1 part sugar], ginger,  garlic powder, & water).  Used 10 small boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Seasoned the chicken with sea salt, garlic powder, and pepper.  I was a little worried reading through reviews saying the dish was too salty after I already had it in the crockpot, but it was fine with my soy sauce substitute.  Also squeezed the juice of 1 orange while cooking and thickened the sauce on the stove with corn starch as others recommended.  Also added some oregano, rosemary, thyme, and garlic powder to the sauce.  As others stated, cooking time was actually around 4.5 - 5 hours on low.

Sprinkled with sesame seeds and served over Jasmine rice with roasted butternut squash and onions.  I really enjoyed it as did my husband and will definitely make it again!

I would cut down on the soy sauce just a bit. The first time I made it, it was a tad bit too salty for me. This time I am using low sodium soy and also added in potatoes to soak up some of that salt. 
Last time, I took the "drippings", mixed it with some leftover rice and fried it in butter and cracked an egg on it. Made some really delicious fried rice. Now that's 2 meals in one recipe!

Some reviews were saying its too salty. I didn't have a problem, but I used low sodium soy sauce both times I've made it and only put about 1/3 cup in. It does make a lot of sauce, so you could add extra chicken.. or we use boneless skinless chicken breast and shred it up once its done and put it on a roll. It's so good as a sandwich. :)

I. was not excited about the crock pot version. I would try the recipe again by baking it in the oven.

I loved this. I don't have a slow cooker so I did change it to bake in the oven at 375 for 1 hour.  I broiled it at the end to thicken the sauce and carmelize it a bit.  I added onions as well as doubled the amount of garlic.  Came out great and couldn't stop eating it.

Simple I used 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup soy sauce low sodium. Stuck it in the oven at 365 degrees for 50 minutes, basking every 15 min. and then add addition 2-3 min on broil. Watch it because it burns fast! I also added a bit of ginger powder as well as red pepper flakes. cooked only 3 thighs, next time will make more when there is a sale.

Overall very tasty, but I did make the following adjustments:
Added only 1/4 C of soy sauce
Used 8 boneless/skinless thighs
Added a bit of poultry seasoning and smoked the chicken for 1 hour first.  Then put in slow cooker for 4 1/2 hours on high.
Served with brown rice, snap peas and water chestnuts.  I also topped with finely chopped green onion before I served. The sauce is not thick, however it does give the chicken a great flavor.   We don't like a thick heavy sauce so this was perfect.  My sweetie and I have happy bellies!!

This was good but the sauce tasted a little burnt. Maybe the slow cooking time should be reduced to 4 hours?

The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender, but the sauce was bland. Will  try again and tweak the sauce, which needed a little spicy heat and maybe tomato paste instead of ketchup  (husband swore he got a touch too much vinegar  because of it.)

To salty, and I had it cooking in slow cooler on low, for the amounted time while I was away, and it was dried out and near burnt.  So disappointed.  I should have been home watching it.

I made this with no changes or adjustments and it was very easy and just delicious! However, I think the cooking time was too long. Next time I will decrease it by an hour. The recipe made enough sauce that you could easily add more chicken or use bone-in chicken with the skin if you wanted. Looking forward to playing with this a little next time

Made it with some changes:

used 2 boneless breasts, two thighs and 4 small legs - we wanted leftovers.

Added 2 Tbsp of "Anything Sauce" (get this in Nashville, TN), 2 Tbsp of Wasabi - we like spicy dishes.  Used pre-minced garlic. Everything else was the same in the recipe.

Cooked on high for 4 hrs, low for 1 hr.   Chicken was very tender, fall off the bone, moist.  My hubby loved it and so did I.  Will make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this a couple times because it is so easy with limited ingredients and the flavor is great.  The last time I made it, I put in a bit of crushed red pepper to give it a little spice to the sweetness and loved it! I served it over white rice and everyone seemed to really like it.

I made this today with 8 chicken thighs and the same amount of sauce ingredients. It was great! I love being able to put it in the crockpot and forget it. I also cook for a halfway house every month and I'm going to try this in the oven with larger quantities!

The more I ate the more it grew on me.  Ridiculously easy to make.  4.5 stars.  Mine was done in 5 hours.  I threw in broccoli and carrots towards the end but would not do the broccoli again.  Too soggy.

Mr.Mom here...lol...and I'm in love with my slow cooker. I made these the ither night and...WOW....what a hit. We all loved them and it sooooooo easy to make. Even better, was that all the ingredients needed are commom staples. I made it with only one pack of frozen boneless/skinless chicken which only contain ten (10) pieces, which was not enough for a family of five...yea, THREE BOYS....gonna hit lotto just to keep food on the table...!!!....lol....Anyway, and we all agreed that it was a def repeat dinner. Actually tasted more like Briscket than chicken.

Didn't have the exact same quantities of ingredients and used Sriracha instead of ketchup and it still turned out delicious. My girlfriend adored it.

Awful.  Yes, it was too salty (and I used low sodium soy sauce), but it had a bad taste.  I thought the honey would make it sweet, as well as the ketchup.  But it just tasted bad. Won't be making this again.

Always gets raves!  Use Low Salt soy sauce and I add a splash of rice vinegar at the end with green onions.   We use 2 pkgs of the Costco boneless thighs and keep the sauce amts the same - except for that extra garlic but we are garlic lovers!
Easy easy prep - no browning - makes it fast to do as leaving the house, but you don't miss the browning.  Put the thighs in frozen and they come out great.

Maybe use BBQ sauce instead of ketchup next time.  I doubled the sauce and used 12 bone-in thighs, on low for 5 hours, then "keep warm" for another  3 hours.  Maybe less soy, because it was pretty salty, even with low sodium soy sauce.

In a spur of the moment decision, I shredded the chicken, added half a box of cooked pasta and an entire jar of Alfredo sauce.  Will try again with one of my home-made Alfredo sauces and maybe some chopped broccoli.  Only gave it a 4 star due to salty taste.  Otherwise a new favorite!

I did not care much for the flavor of these thighs, too much soy.  My husband likes soy and he did not eat these very enthusiastically for all that.  I did use lo Na soy but used the recommended amount.  The thighs were overcooked.  I used six thighs as recommended by others.  Maybe it would have been better with only four thighs.  I did thicken the sauce with the cornstarch slurry as suggested by some.  Perhaps the type of honey might make a difference.  There are so many kinds of honey and I have found they have distinctly different flavors.  That stuff you buy off the shelf is not very good quality honey.  I used an orange blossom honey thinking that would go great with the chicken and soy but maybe I should have used something stronger!

This is an awesome recipe! Even my kids loved it. I did make some additions, but only because of my personal preference (tbsp grated ginger, one onion, one bell peppers, tsp chilli flakes). I know that the original recipe would taste equally fantastic!

It was a little strong but still had a great flavor. I had added 6 chicken thighs because they looked a bit small, and that still wasn't enough. I'll be adding at least 8 next time.

This is a good and easy recipe. We cooked 6-8 thighs and there was plenty of sauce to go with it. Check your slow cooker instructions as not all slow cookers are alike.  6-8 thighs were done in 4-1/2 hours in my slow cooker.

De-lish! Followed exact instructions but used low sodium soy sauce.  I served with brown rice, braised cabbage and steamed broccoli. Sprinkled the final dish with cashews. This is a keeper!

My husband really enjoyed it.  Some of the reviews stated it was a bit salty, so I cut the soy sauce to a 1/3 of a cup and ketchup to 1/4 of a cup.  I added 1/4t of black pepper, 1 lb of potatoes and 3-4 carrots, sliced.  It was a great meal.

Nice flavor, very fall-off-the-bone tender.   Cooking time too long even for 7 bone-in thighs which made them a little dry.  Plenty of sauce which I also thickened with cornstarch in a saucepan.  Husband loved it, I liked it.  Will probably make again for him.

These are always great.  Use low sodium soy sauce.  I also added fresh ginger root, green onion,  a little red pepper flake and siracha sauce and a splash of sesame oil.  They tend to be very "soy sauce" tasting of you don't spice it up a bit.  Let them marinade for about 30 mins prior to cooking.  Turn out awesome!

Delicious!  Definitely a lot of sauce.  I had 6 pieces of chicken  and still had a lot of sauce leftover.  Will make again and add more meat.  I recommend adding siracha  if you want it spicy.  Yum!!!

I made this in my pressure cooker and used 10 thighs.  The smell was amazing and my 12 year old son loved it.  I put over jasmine rice.  I did not brown the thighs before I cooked.  I just threw everything in the pressure cooker.

I added a little brown sugar. 
This recipe is basically the same as putting a sweet bbq sauce in the crock with your chicken.  I made it like a Chinese dish with some fried rice and it worked out very well if you like the meat shredded.

Very tasty and easy.  I made this for 70 people, so I scaled the recipe up.  It was a hit!  There ended up being way too much sauce though, so next time I'll make it with less.

I made this recipe precisely with no substitutions and honestly, it was disgusting.  It was bitter and just - gross.  I will NEVER make it again.  Neither I nor my husband or three kids could choke down more than one bite.

I thought even with low-sodium soy sauce it was too salty for my palate.  Some citrus juice to help correct it made it better for my taste, and I think it was better served with abundant rice.

This was delicious and very easy.  I used chicken breasts because my thighs spent one too many days in the fridge and were bad when I went to use them.  I ended up sung a 3 pack of breasts that was about 2.4 pounds, and I cut them in half.  I think the sauce was enough for even more chicken if you have a big family.  I would go as far as 3 pounds.  I whisked together the sauce the night before and put it all in a big ziplock with the chicken in the fridge overnight.  I didn't think it needed the full 6 hours but use your judgement.  The sauce thinned out in the crock (no surprise, everything in the crock gets watery from condensation).  I ladled out a little of the watery sauce into a saucepan and boiled it on the stove to thicken it, but I don't think that was necessary.  Even though the sauce was thin, I think it was an ok consistency to pour over the finished chicken served over rice.  

Next time I make this, I may add just a little shake of red pepper flakes to give it some heat.  It was pretty sweet, but my kids and my husband loved it.  I just put a squirt of sriracha on my serving and it was fine like that.

This was "good". I followed the recipe.  I'll keep it as it was real easy but if something better comes along, I'll discard it. I tried this again but baked it in the oven and liked it much better. I felt the crock-pot method watered down the sauce too much. It is a nice tasting sauce if done in the oven and it doesn't get watered down.  I put a double layer of foil on the pan I used to bake it in.

It has to be simple or I won't bother.  This was super easy.  I used 10 chicken thighs but there was plenty of sauce for more.  I'll do 15 next time.  I doubled the garlic (because I automatically do that with every recipe).  I made a big wok of stir fry veggies.  Plated the veggies with the chicken on top and drizzled with some sauce.  Fairly healthy and totally yummy!

By far the BEST slow cooker recipe I have ever made! I would suggest after it is done, making a roux and thickening the sauce to put over it all and just put the chicken on top of brown rice!

Nice and easy recipe, although not something I would write home about.I used tomato paste instead of ketchup. Also added some fresh ginger root & chopped onion flakes. Slow-cooked, then placed in oven to broil. Will serve over Basmati rice & some veggies.

Perfection! I cook 8 thighs instead of four (but keep the sauce the same) and I use low sodium soy sauce - which I highly recommend for this dish to keep it from being too salty. Yummy!!

I LOVED this recipe!! It came out SO good. My entire family enjoyed the meal and I can say that we will be making it again. It didn't take very long to prepare, the ingredients weren't too complex, and their wasn't a huge mess to clean up after. We did leave the chicken in the pot for about 6 hours and 30 minutes to 7 hours instead of just 6. I did this so the chicken would fall off the bone and it did. I recommend trying it this way!! Try it you will not regret it.

Tasty and easy. I used approx double the quantities given and it fed us for lunch the next day too. Gives a sweet brown sauce, almost with a hoi-sin vibe, and the chicken is moist and tender. The sauce goes in the pan as a thick glaze, but comes out very runny when hot,  so you could stir in some cornflour at the end for a thicker sauce. Use a low-salt soy sauce to avoid it getting too salty. I only needed to put it on low for 4.5 - 5 hours or so, I think the 6 hours stated would have overcooked it.

Great flavor.  I ran out of soy sauce and could only add 1/4 cup, but decided to add 1/4 cup of chicken stock so I wasn't short on liquid.  I added cornstarch to the sauce at the end and it tasted great on top of the chicken.  I will use this again.

The whole family really enjoyed  this dish! e have a large household so I doubled the recipe for the sauce and used about 16 pieces of bone-in, skin on chicken thighs (that's what was on hand). Changes made were using more chicken and using half soy sauce and half aminos for a lower salt content.  Since we used skin on chicken, about 20 minutes before serving I put the chicken on a baking tray, added a lil cornstarch and water mixture into the sauce to thicken it some, drizzled it over the chicken and put it in the oven at 400 degree's to crisp up the skin. Came out looking just like the picture! The guys all used the sauce with their rice as well.  I will definitely be making it again. (Served it with steamed broccoli and cauliflower)

It was too salty (even with low sodium soy sauce) and just tasted weird. I can't imagine how I could have screwed up this recipe with so few ingredients. The chicken was also really overcooked.

Everyone loved this. Ran out of soy sauce so I filled the measuring cup with teriyaki sauce along with it. Turned out really yummy.

Made this over the weekend.  I feel the 6 hour cook time was a bit much.  The chicken was way over cooked.  I think a 5 hour cook would have been enough. I'd use low sodium soy sauce next time, as the final outcome was a bit salty.  Family liked it though.
Next time I'll make the stove top version.
I served it with potatoes au gratin and a broccoli coleslaw.

I made couple changes as suggested in some of reviews. 1. Lessen the soy sauce to 1/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup in the recipe. WHAT A MISTAKE!   It s now too sweet . I don't get why so many said it s too salty. The honey should balance it off. 2. I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I really didn't see the sauce thicken much.
4 stars because the meat came out tough and too much fat using chicken thighs. 
Mine came out like in the picture and I am very bad at cooking.  I wouldn't change anything  in the recipe at all.  If you want to use more chicken thights, there s no need to double the ingredients for sauce.

Amazingly delicious! It was definitely overcooked with a 6 hour cook time on low so I'll adjust that next time for sure. 
I was a bit skeptical about the spice choice but tried it as written other than the amount of soy sauce and it went well. I used 1/4 of the amount of soy sauce called for because of the other reviews and I'm seriously glad that I did. I used 6 chicken leg quarters cleaned and skinned to lower the fat and have a more economical meal. Because it was falling off of the bone, I went with the flow and just deboned it and just made sandwiches for lunch with a whole grain bread and added light miracle whip. Yum! 
I'll make this again for sandwiches and save on the deli meat chicken prices. This recipe tasted fantastic, was economical, and had ingredients I usual have in my cupboard instead of exotic or unusual ones. I'll try it over rice with some veggies for dinner sometime as well. Very versatile recipe. Thanks for posting it.

I love this recipe. Its so good. I did do things a bit differently though. The recipe (as written) looked to sweet, to salty, and a bit low on garlic. Here is what I did and it was perfect. 

I reduced the honey to 2 tbsps plus 2 tsps. I upped the garlic to 6 cloves. I also added about 1/8 tsp of 5 spice seasoning. I used low sodium soy sauce the first time and just reduced the amount of soy sauce down to a 1/3 cup the second time. Both adjustments worked great.  I switched out the chicken for skinless goose breast the first time I made it and then skinless duck the next time I made it. Both the duck and goose were wonderful. Also I just want to say that the duck I did in a clay pot cooker. Soaked the clay pot and lid then popped it in the cold oven and set to 400. It took longer then I expected but turned out so great. The last 15 to 20 minutes I removed the lid and basted with the glaze drippings in the pot. Absolutely going to be making this again.

I was expecting a much richer interplay of flavors, but this dish ends up tasting pretty flat.  Somehow the combination of fairly strong ingredients like soy sauce and garlic doesn't really do the job.  In the end, this chicken is just meh.

Easy & flavorful.  Thanks to other posters, dropped the soy sauce & ketchup to 1/3c each (kept the rest of the sauce the same), 8 thighs, & cooked for 2 hours on high & thickened the sauce.  Will make again, but will drop the soy sauce further to 1/4c.

I wanted to like this recipe but it was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a yummy sweet honey glaze and it was nothing like that. It was very watery. I had to whisk the sauce down with flour after it and the flavor tasted more like a brisket recipe and not like a honey glaze sauce. I made this recipe with 3 lbs of boneless breasts in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours... The chicken was a dry and the color of the meat came out brown so from a presentation perspective it wasn't great.

Easy, delicious and tasty! I didn't have the time, so cooked stove top and was still tender, moist and yummy. I had some leftover sauce and saved (froze) it. Used it on stir fry shrimp and broccoli...made yet another fabulous meal. Think I might just have to keep some of this sauce on hand!

I made this last night and it tasted amazing! I found it makes quite a bit of sauce and I used 14 boneless skinless drumsticks. I thickened the sauce with a cornstarch slurry about 2.5 tbsp and a tsp or 2 of water. I will be making this again.

This really was not a good meal. We are very good home cooks at my house and none of us enjoyed the meal. I try to more fit into a lettuce wrap with the dish was so horrible. I put the chicken and Asian rice lettuce peanut sauce and kimchee. I think it's just disguised the bad chicken taste.  Don't make this recipe if you're good home cook.

Pretty good and simple.  I used light soy sauce since I noticed this recipe used quite a bit. Also Instead of basil, I used ginger.

this was a great base recipe to play around with so that it suits your tastes. I made the following changes after reading some of the reviews: 

-- spread a diced white  onion in the bottom of the slow cooker before the chicken. 
-- used 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. 
-- for the sauce: 1/3 cup honey, 1/3 cup low sodium gluten free soy sauce, 1/3 cup ketchup, 6 cloves chopped garlic, freshly grated ginger, few teaspoons of brown sugar, 2 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
-- cooked on low for 4 hours
-- after cooking, removed chicken and added a cornstarch slurry to the sauce to thicken (maybe 1 tsp cornstarch dissolved in a big splash of water).

served everything over brown rice, with roasted broccoli on the side.

Good! However, I'm one of those who made adjustments.  Only used 1/4 cup of both low salt soy sauce and BBQ sauce (instead of ketchup). I did add about  2 tsp brown sugar. I actually baked it in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes, turned, then baked another 20 minutes. I poured off the very runny sauce and added a little corn starch and heated it in the microwave (I was hungry and in a hurry!), stirring well till it thickened, then spread it over the chicken. Tasty!

This is terrible. I typically cook on my own and don't use other recipes. It tastes like sweet soy sauce.

Added an onion, 1 tsp ginger and a bit of siracha after reading through the reviews. Used Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce. Also threw in some pineapple towards the end. Turned out okay. The chicken was moist but the flavor wasn't that great. Wanted to broil in the oven as some reviews suggested but the chicken was falling apart. Probably won't be making this again.

I love this dish and make it all the time. The flavors of the dark meat with the simplicity of honey, soy and ketchup make a powerfully flavorful dish. Served with wild rice and salad, it is a wonderful evening meal to come to after a hard day's work.

This is fantastic.  I made one somewhat large change, due to my tastes.  Subbed out 1/4 cup ketchup for 1/4 cup Sriracha.  If you like heat, it's great.  You still get the sweet and savory from the soy/honey, but the additional ingredients of Sriracha add a ton of flavor.

I just made this with legs and thighs, bone-in and skin on.  As other reviewers suggested, I used low sodium soy sauce and went a little lighter on the ketchup (used about 2/3 of what was called for).  I checked it after 5 hours and the meat was cooked so I took it out and thickened the juice with flour.   It's fabulous.

I was so excited to try this recipe since I love thighs. It made a nice sauce that I thickened with corn starch. Followed the directions and used low salt soy sauce because people complained about saltiness, but my chicken was rubbery. My family did not care for it much. Probably won't make again.

Followed directions exactly. The results were overly salty, so overpowered by soy the taste was bitter.

I was glad I read all your reviews and made these adjustments. A lot of people said it was too salty and dry so I used half of the soy sauce  recommendation , half the ketchup, added 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, prolly 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili pepper flakes, and added a cup of water. I used 9 in bone with skin chicken thighs and didn't double the sauce. Their was plenty of sauce leftover. After cooking in my croc pot for 3 hours on low I had my husband put on warm until I got home about 4 hours later. Next time I will have him just take the chicken out because it was a lil dry but I added some of the sauce after I added some flour and water to thicken the sauce in a sauce pan and it was good. Sauce was good enough to add to the white rice. I also broiled the chicken for a few mins to give it that crispy flavor and look. I served it with white rice and steamed carrots and my family loved it. I have a picky husband too and was happy to see everyone's plate cleaned.  I will make again and like I said the only adjustment I would do is take the chicken out of the crockpot instead of letting it sit on warm for a while.

Awesome chicken! I used the 3 chicken breasts I had on hand and turned the rest of the broth into a vegetable stew (potatoes, carrots, and onions). This recipe is sweet and garlicky, resembling a teriyaki taste but with a pot roast consistency. The chicken melted off my fork like a pot roast. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Good dish. After cooking,  the sauce was very thin and did not stick to the meat but the flavor cooked deep into the chicken and was still delicious. If I do make this again I will probably use cornstarch or flour and seasoning to thicken the sauce, re-glaze the chicken and finish it off in the oven for 10-15 min.

This was  good. I followed the recipe with the exception of using reduced sodium soy sauce, chicken breasts, and garlic powder as these were the ingredients I had on hand. I served it over rice. It is even better over quinoa.  I put the chicken breasts in frozen and thickened the sauce/shredded the chicken towards the end.  The last time I made it I added mushrooms and 1/2 an onion. It was yummy. Easy and filling.

I used low sodium soy sauce and added 1/2 cup Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I still found it lacking in flavor.  I meant to add onion, peppers and pineapple at the last 30 minutes, perhaps that and some brown sugar would've helped.  I will not make it again to adjust ingredients though.  It's just wasn't that good.

Excellent! Changed it to 8 bone-in chicken thighs and doubled the garlic and basil. I also added about a cup of sliced baby carrots. After only 5 hours, chicken was falling off the bone. Served it with quinoa. Next time, I'll throw in onions as well.

Great recipe. People keep asking me to make it again, or they ask for the recipe. The only thing I do different is that I do not use all the sauce. I pour a little on the bottom of the crock pot, place the chicken in, and then coat the chicken with a little more of the sauce.

Ive made it several times. Ive tweeked it and came up with the following. I like to remove the skin and leave bone in. I use equal parts Soy, Bbq, Hoison, Ketchup, and Honey to equal 1 2/3 cups liquid. Added more garlic and some chili pepper flakes. Left on low for 4 1/2 hours then removed from slow cooker and broiled in oven to caramelise the sauce. While they were in oven I added a bit of cornstarch to remaining sauce and put cooker on high. Placed chicken on a bed of coconut rice anf drizzled sauce over finished product. Great recipe.

I had a bigger crock pot and just got some chicken thighs with bone, so I piled in 12 of them with skin removed.  I did not double the quantity of liquid, but there was still quite a bit at the end of cooking.

I prepared the chicken in the evening and allowed it to sit in the liquid (in fridge) overnight.  In the afternoon, about 5 hours prior to dinner my wife turned it on.

I followed the advice of some and used low sodium soy sauce.   The chicken was not salty at all, in fact it kinda lacked some taste.  It was just quite bland.

I followed some recommendations to thicken the sauce with some corn starch, put some over the chicken (I still had quit a bit left), and broil the chicken it for a bit.  The color did get a bit nicer, but the taste was still quite bland.

To be honest, I didn't get past making the sauce. It was the right consistency, and I followed directions to the T, but when I tasted the sauce, it was SO INCREDIBLY SALTY. 
I tried to lessen the saltiness by adding corn starch, water, lemon and more honey...it was better but still far too salty for my taste.

Not a huge fan. Even with a couple more thighs than called for, the sauce was too runny for my taste.  But most importantly, WAY too salty from the soy sauce. Next time I would either switch to a lower-sodium option or change up the ratio so there's a more balanced teriyaki taste.

The chicken was good, but I made 2 changes.  I only added 1/4 cup soy sauce.  Otherwise it would have been way too salty.  I did add cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce which gave it a sticky consistency.

This wasn't good. I followed the recipe to the letter and have the same complaints as a few others: I just got a thin, runny soup, no glaze, and the soy taste/salt totally overpowered everything. I made this for our anniversary dinner and figured that it was a slam dunk even though I'd never made it (just based on the reviews and ingredients).

I have made this with both chicken thighs and drumsticks several times each, and it is always amazing. Suggested changes for those who like it sweeter: instead of 1/2 cup of ketchup, use 1/4 cup of each ketchup and BBQ sauce, and add 2-3 Tbsp of brown sugar. Using low-sodium soy sauce doesn't hurt, either. Goes great with either mashed potatoes or rice.

Quick and easy recipe. I used 5 chicken breasts (a few of mine were on the small side) and added a small can of crushed pineapple as suggested by another reviewer. I also cut the soya sauce putting in 1/4C instead of 1/2C. The chicken turned out moist and went over well! Will make this again.

Very good flavor with minimal ingredients. Too salty with regular soy sauce-  used some brown sugar to help curb the saltiness (in addition to honey). Next time will cut back on soy or use reduced sodium.  Otherwise, quick, easy & tasty.

I made this tonight and my partner really enjoyed it. I used low sodium soy sauce and a little bit of Mae Ploy Sweet Chilli Sauce for some heat. I served the chicken over brown rice. The sauce had a TON of flavor. I would definitely make this again. Some bites were a little too salty so I'll probably scale back on the soy sauce next time.

The meat was almost falling apart when I took it out. It melts in your mouth. A little too salty and sweet but just needs a little tinkering to my taste. Next time going to try to add some Sriracha and low sodium soy sauce. Otherwise fantastic. Paired it with couscous and green beans.

I cooked it a really long time so the sauce got very thick and lustrous. I used double the chicken, but kept the sauce ingredients the same. We cut it up and ate it over rice. My husband, who is from Trinidad, thought I had made one of his native dishes- brown stewed chicken- which I took as a major compliment.

Excellent recipe, and I made it exactly as per the recipe except for one thing...which was doubling the number of chicken thigh pieces (skinless but bone in because I was too lazy to bone it). My 2 year old gobbled it up. A couple of reviewers thought it was too salty, and this might be because they used light soy which has higher sodium content than dark soy sauce. Also, I haven't tried it yet, but it would work to cut the soy sauce to a 1/3 cup instead of using a full 1/2c if people are worried about their salt intake.

First rule - never use a slow cooker while you are still in the house...  the divine smells will drive you crazy!  When first put together the taste of the sauce was perfect. Unfortunately, as reviewer Brian discovered, with the slow cooking the salt became predominant and rather ruined the end results. I used 1/4 c low sodium soya s and 1/4 regular soya.  This sauce replicates VH's Honey Garlic Sauce, which I love, so am ecstatic to have found a recipe from scratch. Will definitely be making again but either not in a slow cooker or adjusting the soy somehow - what a shame as this is a marvelous recipe!
I had also added 2 legs and all had skin & bones - and some were even still partially frozen but no problem - 4 hours on high - they were fall off the bone!  Thank you Myrna!

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this in the oven because I wanted a sticky type chicken without having to thicken the sauce.  I only used one-half the amount of soy sauce.  I baked my chicken first to about 145 degrees and then siphoned off the juice.  I poured and basted the chicken with the sauce and continued cooking until the meat fell off the bone! It was the best ever!  I served this to approximately 50 homeless shelter residents and they are now my best friends! I would definitely make this again!

I used a spice mix I already had available, some basil in it but also Cinnamon... I think it made an interesting variation. The sauce became a glaze when I upped the heat to finish it in time. I'm glad there are leftovers! Hubby may have not been crazy about it but he didn't turn down a second helping either!

I found the soy sauce too overpowering.   I used 6 thighs- the sauce is more than enough.  My picky son LOVED it, so I will probably make it again, but with 1/2 the soy sauce.

Used a bulk package of boneless skinless thighs.  Made 1.5 times the sauce and it was more than enough.  Very easy, tender and yummy.  Served over rice.

I actually used 12 thighs.  Lots of sauce for each of them.  They were fantastic.  I can see that adding pineapple and a little onion and some peppers may add a different twist and I may try that soon.  I highly recommend this receipe.  Low Sodium Soya Sauce is also recommended.

I was a little skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews about it being too salty but I used low sodium soy sauce and followed the directions and added some extra garlic and had 6 boneless skinless thighs.  I also only cooked it for about four hours and it turned out delicious!!!  It was way too easy to be that good.   I'll be making it again for sure.

Good base, however, even though I used reduced sodium soy sauce, it was extremely salty. After cooking time was done, I transferred some of the sauce to a small saucepan and corrected the saltiness by adding water to taste. I then added corn starch to thicken. The resulting glaze was very good.

This was very good and very easy. I put frozen chicken breasts into the crock pot with the sauce and cooked on low for 6 hours. I used low-sodium soy sauce and did add 2 additional cloves of garlic, and thought it could have used another, but we like garlic in my house. Served with wild rice and sautéed cauliflower and broccoli, and it was a great meal. Even picky kids ate it. Thank you!

Update - my husband commented on this recipe three days after we had it! 

I did make this again, and it was very good, BUT I used regular soy sauce and thought it was very salty. It is MUCH better with low-sodium soy sauce.

This was the first meal I made in the crockpot, it smelled delicious! When I opened the lid 6 hours later I was kinda unimpressed on how the sauce looked, I should have added corn starch to it but I was just so hungry I didn't care. The chicken looked amazing!!! I used bone-in chicken thighs and it fell perfectly off of the bone! It tasted okay, the ketchup was too strong I guess. But overall, it was an okay chicken. Definitely different, but with the ingredients I had on hand it was as good as it was going to get. Basic.

I didn't have time to slow cook these today, so I baked them for about 40 min at 350-375.  My family loved them.  I can't wait to try these in the slow cooker sometime to compare.  yummy!

I made this with eight bone-in chicken thighs.  I did not double the recipe.  I used good quality honey, reduced sugar ketchup and just the regular sodium soy sauce. 

 I cooked it on high for three hours and on low for another three hours after stirring it up and adding a cup of water halfway into cooking. It tasted amazing!  I spooned the sauce over white rice and served it with zucchini.  My picky four and six year olds both closed their eyes and said "Mmmm" when they had their first bite. And my mom asked for the recipe. Success!

I had a whole chicken, added a little chicken bouillon. So good, I gave the simple recipe to my son, who is in his first apartment and doing his own cooking. Used the same as a marinade on pork chops on the grill. Happy Happy.

Pretty good, even using skin/bone-in thighs! I might season it a bit more next time, and I think I could have added more garlic. Very tender and yummy though!

Followed the recipe and not only was it overcooked (I even dropped it to 5 hours instead of 6), the flavor was awful.  I threw it out!!!  I  usually try to stay away from recipes that call for premixed  ingredients liked canned or boxed soups, ketchups, etc   I need to stick to my rule.

I have made this dish twice this week. It is super easy and a huge hit in my household.  I ran out of soy sauce and substituted 3/4 cup of bottled teriyaki sauce marinade (there are a number of varieties in the grocery store). It was thicker than the soy sauce so it made a nice, thick sauce without extra steps.  I also increased the garlic by about one third and could easily put in more without it being too garlicky. Cooked for 6 hours on low and it was fork tender.  This will be one of my go-to weeknight dishes.

Used more chicken and low sodium soy sauce. Turned out great! Might try adding a bit more garlic next time, feels like it needs just a little more zing.

Made this last night for dinner exactly how the recipe said and my picky husband loved it! He said to add it to his list of only pizza and hot wings. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

It was just "OK" and tasted like teriyaki chicken. Nothing spectacular.

Very good.... I'd probably give 4.5 stars, as it didn't knock my socks off.  Still, I'd make again.  So easy and quick.  Used about 4 boneless thighs and 2 boneless breasts.  Cooked on low until done, about 4 hours.  (SC cooks hot).   Shredded and served with carrots and potatoes.  Would make a great Asian taco with shredded cabbage, green and onion and maybe drizzle of teriyaki sauce or soy sauce.  Next time I'll crack fresh black pepper over it.

This made for an easy entrée using ingredients I had on hand. No complaints there.  I doubled the chicken but did not really double the sauce. More wasn't needed. My one complaint is that there's no way the chicken will look like the photo using the instructions provided.  The photo looks like they might have boiled the sauce down to thicken it and poured it over the cooked chicken.  If you put that under a broiler you'd get the caramelized crust shown.  Otherwise the chicken just looks like it was simmered in a dark liquid.

Basically this is homemade honey bbq sauce.  To lower salt and make it gluten free, I used low sodium Tamari instead of regular soy sauce.  I also baked mine in the oven for a crisper skin--I don't have much luck with crispy/gooey in the slo-cooker.

This was great. It is naturally gluten free as long as you use g/f soy sauce, so I really liked that about the recipe. I did substitute one can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil for 1/2 of the ketchup. That seemed like a lot of sweetness with the honey and ketchup. By using the flavored tomatoes it didn't water it down. It was perfect. I served it over rice, and my husband added his mandatory red pepper flakes, and we were both happy. Great for leftovers too.

This chicken is delicious. So easy to do too. I add a little more honey than the recipe calls for as a matter of personal taste. We serve it over rice with red and green peppers. Great everytime!

I've made this a few times, both with legs and thighs. (I personally like it a little better with legs, but that's a personal preference) I've cooked it both with skin, and skinless and I liked the flavor much better when I take the skin off. I also add onion powder, oregano, parsley, black pepper, and paprika (per another reviewer) to the chicken before adding the sauce. Gives it the extra flavor it needs. Chicken is tender and tastes great. And so easy to throw together.

Not a hit with the family.  The sauce tasted like something was missing, but we couldn't put a finger on what it may need.  I doubled the recipe since I got an amazing deal on bone-in thighs that I needed to use so we have a bit of leftovers.  I won't be making this again, but it may just be not for us as many others seemed to really enjoy it.  It was OK, but it went together and in the crockpot so quickly--a HUGE plus in my book!!  Thank you for submitting this recipe, Myrna!!

Used 6 pcs. of bone in chicken thighs. It was finished an hour before the cook time was up. I checked for doneness and it fell off the bone. My husband insisted I save the sauce for a marinade. He lived it.

This recipe was good. I used 6 chicken thighs and also added some brown sugar.  The sauce did not thicken up so I had to add some corn starch to help it thicken.  I had soy sauce, but it wasn't low sodium, so I used less soy sauce and added some water to it so that it didn't have such asalty taste.  I also added a few chopped onions and some mushrooms.  Great meal!!

I used bone-in thighs because that's what I had.  It was great, chicken was very tender.  Doubled the sauce because I cooked 7 thighs, and also added some cornstarch to sauce at the end to thicken a bit.  Served with rice, broccoli and butternut squash.  Everyone liked it.

Super simple and delicious.  Like some others, I used 8 chicken thighs instead of 4 and there was still plenty of sauce left over.

I made a few changes based on what I had in my pantry and a little bit of inspiration. I didn't have fresh garlic or straight basil, so I used garlic powder and Italian Seasoning. I also added some ginger and tinkered with the proportions – – I ended up adding a little more ketchup and honey, if I recall correctly. After the thighs were cooked, I removed them and added some cornstarch to thicken it up. about 10 minutes before serving, I added the chicken back in along with some slightly undercooked broccoli and turned the crockpot off. I it served over jasmine rice and called it "Vaguely Asian Chicken", LOL. Everyone liked it, and it's a tough crowd at my house – – a toddler, a kindergartner, and a 40-year-old man who are all very picky. ;-) I will keep tinkering with it and probably change it up a little bit every time I make it. I am making it again tonight and I am adding some toasted sesame seeds and serving it with string beans. I love that it is a versatile recipe using pantry staples!

Tried this today......loved it. I read some of the reviews and followed some of the suggestions. I used 6 boneless thighs, cooked it on high 3 1/2-4 hours. After cooking, took the thighs out and added cornstarch. I also didn't add the basil cause I didn't have any. I used low sodium soy sauce. Served it over Uncle Bens rice in a pouch.

Did not turn out great. The sauce was an odd combination of ingredients, but since the reviews were so positive I gave it a shot. I did use low sodium soy sauce, and chicken breasts instead of thighs. I tasted the sauce with about an hour to go, and opted to add some BBQ sauce and onion to try and salvage it.  It didn't help much.

I agree that these were too salty, even though I did cut down on the amount of soy sauce used.  It was edible but would not make again.

This is really easy and Very tasty!  I changed a couple of things for personal health reasons.  First I doubled the recipe since I had 10 thighs.   I used 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce, and 1 1/2 cups water, 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup agave nectar.  it was really good, and the chicken was falling apart it was so tender.  Next time the only change I will make other than those listed here.  Is to cut the basil back just a bit. It was a bit strong for me.  Thank you for sharing your recipe it made a really nice EASY dinner for us tonight.

Wonderful!  I used 4 breasts, and cooked them 4 hours on low, and they dried out a bit.  I think I will try 3 1/2 hours next time, but there definitely will be a next time!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very popular. I was out of honey so I substituted 1/2 cup maple syrup for the 1/3 cup honey. The dinner guests thought it was better with the syrup.

Very good! I would do 3/4 cup soy sauce as it was just a little salty for me,  and I made a roux if 2 tablespoons flour,  1/4 cup cold water and gradually stirred it in.  Thickened the sauce right up! Will make again!

Simple and delicious with ingredients always on hand!! I used 9 skinless, bone-in thighs with the recipes given amounts for the sauce...plenty of sauce!!! It was easy to take out the chicken when done, and pour the liquid into a small sauce pan...stirred in some cornstarch mixed in cold water to thicken. Served over Jasmine rice. Loved it!

It was very easy to make and had good flavor the whole family enjoyed it. I didn't feel the name resembled the flavor well I would have called it honey teriyaki chicken but it was still good either way.

I really liked this recipe! Yes, it is a bit salty, but not overly so if low salt soy sauce is used. This would be a great dish for a potluck as it is easy and quick and is really pretty once it comes out of the cooker. This will be on our weekly rotation! Thank you! :D

This recipe is amazing!!!  I'm not all that fond of dark meat, but chicken thighs cooked this way are absolutely delicious.  I tried it out on my son and his family and they loved it, too.  This recipe is a keeper and will be one of my go-to recipes in the future.  I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  So good!!!

My whole family loved it. I usually have issues with my chicken getting too dry when making it in the crock pot but this was perfect! I took a tip from a fellow reviewer and put it on high for 2 1/2 hours instead of the 6 hours on low. Thanks for the recipe!

It had a very strong soy sauce flavor to it. If I make it again I would half the soy sauce.

As another said, it was very salty. I'd probably cut the soy sauce in half and use low-sodium soy sauce. That way it'll be thicker as well. Also, it was fall-apart finished at 5 hours. I imagine 6 would have been way too long.

I made the mistake of leaving the skin on the chicken pieces. The layer of fat under the skin liquified and made it a bit greasier than I would have liked. I drained off the fat as much as I could and wished in a bit of flour and it turned out just fine. Will make this for my family again.

This was a pretty quick dinner idea. I used 6 thighs, the same amount of liquid, and about double the garlic.  I cooked it on high in my crockpot and it was done in about 2 hours.  The thighs were fairly small.  I would fix this again but might add a little crushed red pepper.

I made this for a group of junior high kids and regretted having to give it away. It smelled wonderful! I tasted it when thickening the sauce (like other reviewers suggested) and wished I had made enough for myself. The kids loved it too!

My family loved this recipe. I do recommend using more chicken. I had 5 people eating and it was so good that everyone was left wanting more. Hubby recently made this and had to substitute pizza sauce for the ketchup (didn't have any) and it was still yummy!

I wasn't as impressed with this recipe as I thought I'd be.  I thought it would be sweeter than what it was, and it is really salty!  I even used low sodium soy sauce.  Probably will not make again :(

Really disappointed in this recipe! I was excited to find a simple/ tasty slow cooker recipe, but it turned out FAR too salty and not tasty at all! My girlfriend and I both didn't like it at all

I had never cooked chicken in the crock pot before.  All I had were regular bone-in thighs, so that's what I used, but I would advise against that because they came out very watery and greasy even though I drained the liquid after it had been cooking two hours (I didn't add the sauce until after I did that, but it still ended up very watered down).  The chicken tasted good though, so I think I'll try it again the right way.

Instead of using the crick pit, I baked this chicken and it was awesome (didn't have 6 hours to wait!). 

Even better as leftovers because the favors got to marinate!!

Not really four-star taste, but definitely four (or five) for ease of preparation, which is worth plenty, in my book. I wouldn't serve this to a group of adults (to put it mildly), but it is more than adequate for a weekday family supper.

Turned out really dry despite soaking in the sauce.  The soy sauce really makes it salty and I used low sodium.  Not a good recipe and my kids wouldn't eat it.

I made one small tweak, I like alittle tang- so added 1/3 cup Italian dressing. tastes like bbq chicken, but better!

This is a great recipe. Made it a few times already. Wanted the change up a little bit. So the third time instead of adding honey I added hot sauce about 1/8 cup. Instead of ketchup I added 1/2 cup BBQ sauce.  Turned out well since I love spicy food. 
Edit:  Also, the third time I made it with chicken thighs with bone in. Made a few cuts on the surface for flavour to penetrate.

It was done and burnt way before it was suppose to be done. I followed the recipe, and don't know how everyone got such different results.  Also it didn't have much taste, I'm not sure what it is missing, maybe brown sugar.

Mixed reviews on this recipe between my husband and me. He would give this recipe a 5; I give it a 2. My reason for a 2 is the very salty soy sauce taste; I am not a big soy sauce fan, while he is. It had too much soy sauce taste for me. I loved the ease of making it! The house smelled great as it cooked. I did not have chicken thighs and used breast meat; I do think it would have been better with thighs as it did not have that 'melt in your mouth' consistency with breast meat. We had it with white rice. I gave some of my chicken to my husband and then mixed the sauce still left into the rice and it cut down on the soy sauce flavor a lot for me. I would probably make this again since my husband really liked it.

I made this with 10 thighs, did not add any extra ingredients like others said & it tasted fabulous! I used lite soy sauce & maybe that's what made the difference? My 14 yr old ate 5! Will def make again!

I had 12 thighs and 2 1/2 hours. I tripled the sauce recipe, but only used 1/2 of it in the slow cooker. I thicken the rest of the sauce with corn starch. I turned the thighs on high and it came out great! The thighs were tender. I served it over rice and steamed vegetables

It was delicious. I only had 1/4 cup of soy sauce, so I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar.  I only had 3 hours to cook, so I cooked it on high. The chicken was very tender and yummy! Ate it with Quinoa, tomatoes, avocado slices and steamed broccoli.

I made this yesterday, and it was a hit with the whole family!!  I disagree with those who have commented that it was too salty, and I even used the recommended amount of Soy Sauce.  I made two small additions to the recipe:  I added 1 small diced onion, and about 1/3 Cup of Sriracha Chili Sauce to add a little zip to the sauce.  The Sriracha gave it a nice Spicey/Sweet contrast, and it was not too spicy.  I was also impressed by how easy this recipe is! I will definitely make this again!!  :)

I added double the chicken and there was plenty sauce. I added sliced onions. I also steamed julienne carrots and zucchini and added them at the end. I only cooked it for 3 hours and that was plenty. Thickened a little with corn starch. Delicious over rice.

I made this tonight, it was great! After 5.5hours, I lifted out chicken and mixed in some cornstarch to thicken sauce, then I added pineapple chunks and cooked another 15 mins while I cooked up rice and steamed broccoli. Excellent.

I only had chicken breasts on hand for the meat. So I decided why not chicken never dries out in the slow cooker. This was very good and I will make it again. Next time I think I will use a whole cutup chicken in the sauce, as there is a whole lot of sauce. Thanks :)

I put this in the slow cooker yesterday (Sunday) and let it cook while I went out to get my nails done and see a movie. Came home to a great meal! Surprisingly it tasted amazing. I say surprisingly because I'm a new cook and when adding the minced garlic. I realized I was using the measuring spoon for tablespoon not teaspoon. So I added more garlic accidentally. So I ended up adding more honey so that the garlic wouldn't over power everything. This meal was so simple to make and tasted so good. I ate it with white rice and carrots. Thanks for the recipe!

This was super easy to make. It was a bit too salty for me, so when i make it again I'll decrease the soy sauce and add a bit more honey. Maybe a little more garlic too.  It was super yummy though. The chicken (I only had chicken breasts on hand) was super tender and very juicy. I made some rice as a side dish and the honey garlic glaze was great to pour over it. I'll do veggies with it next time.

This came out pretty good. However, I did add some Chinese five spice because I felt it needed more flavor. I think it's a nice base recipe though.

Kids wouldn't eat it. I didn't like it either. I followed the recipe exactly. I found the chicken to be dry and flavorless except the salt.

It's ok. It's sweet and the sauce is a little strong. I made it as described and served over white rice. Probably won't make it again.

Very good recipe.  I read some other reviews.  I doubled the thigh count to 8 and used only half of the soy sauce to cut down on salt.  Then allowed individuals to salt to taste after serving.

Incredibly good! The tender meat resembles barbecue.  Served it over jasmine rice. I used drumsticks (skin removed) and browned them in the pot before slow cooking to enhance the flavor.  I also whisked a spoon of cornstarch into the finished sauce as another reviewer suggested to thicken it. Wow!

This was very tasty, even though I cooked it for a bit too long. On the last hour I added baby potatoes to the sauce and these were amazing as a side dish.

This was very easy to make, which is nice, but the glaze was bland. Luckily I had served this with a garlic tossed spinach so we had some flavor on our plates.

The soy sauce was a little over-powering. I will make it again but adjust the sauce proportions. Had the left overs the next day shredded in flour tortillas with some other fixins which cut down the saltiness from the soy sauce.

My very first time cooking boneless thighs and they were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly - only I doubled it. They were done after about 5 hours and were swimming in fat. Wouldn't want to use the drippings but the thighs were really good as is. I was careful not to turn or mix them at all while they were cooking and the sauce made a nice glaze. Will definitely make this again.

GREAT recipe. Added one bag of baby carrots to the bottom of the crockpot first. I may add a second bag the next time because they soaked up the sweetness and tasted almost glazed. Added diced scallions to the liquid mix and doubled the garlic.  The result was a HUGE success over white Jasmati rice.

This was delicious! Much better than I expected and so quick to make. I followed the recipe pretty much, except I used boned thighs and drumsticks since that's what I had, and added more honey since I thought it would balance out the salty soy sauce out more. Also, I used light soy sauce. I cooked for just 5.5 hours and it was falling off the bone. The sauce was a bit thin to start, so I added some corn flour and it went into a lovely, sticky sauce! I had it with some basmati and it was a lovely meal! Definitely recommend this :)

So easy and tasty. I added a little cornflour (1 tablespoon) to make the sauce a little thicker (personal preference) and served with sugar snap peas shallow fried in sesame oil and steamed baby carrots over the rice cooker for ease. I garnished with dry fried sesame seeds. Beautiful dish.

The soy sauce for me personally overwhelmed all the other flavors. I will tinker with it but I'm cutting the soy sauce down to half a cup next time.

I made this following the exact directions, but was not very pleased with the results. The chicken was burnt after cooking on low for 6 hours. We also didn't taste the honey or the garlic, even after I added a little more honey than the recipe called for. The flavor was mainly soy, which was way too overpowering for me. I won't be making this again, unfortunately.

Absolutely delicious. Cut the soy sauce to a third of a cup due to saltiness, used bone-in chicken thighs (4 pcs), which could've easily been 8-10 thighs instead. Upped the garlic to a couple extra cloves and added in a couple bay leaves because why not. Chicken was falling off the bone and great over rice and broccoli.

This recipe was fast and easy. Had good flavor and I would make this again since I always have honey and ketchup in the house. I used drumsticks since I didn't have chicken thighs.

I do not try a lot of new things, and this was my first time cooking with honey or soy sauce.  I have to say I am thrilled I tried this!  Everyone in my house loved this.  I threw carrots in with it, and made enough that there should have been leftovers, but every last piece was eaten!  I love that this was a slow cooker recipe.

Ketchup and soy sauce are definitely the predominant flavors, as they are the main ingredients.  The chicken thighs were falling/shredding apart after 4 hr, so lift them out carefully with a spatula instead of spearing them with a fork like I did if you want a pretty presentation.  I will be serving leftovers as picnic fare BBQ shredded chicken sandwich with potato salad.

This was so easy and delicious. One thing I changed was cooking for 7 hours instead of 6 hrs and 15 minutes and added about 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/2 cup. This was to go easy on the salt. It's still delicious. You can top it off with black pepper and it'll season perfectly. I like to eat this with steamed white rice and steamed broccoli.

this recipe was not the most flavorful, but it was quick and easy.  paired with biscuits and a vegetable it made a quick dinner that was kid friendly.  i don't know if the chicken thighs I had were unusually small, but I tripled the number of thighs and left the amount of sauce the same and it was just right.  would have been much too much sauce with the stated number of thighs.

We loved this quick and easy recipe. Thank you. Tried it again with pork and it was just as delicious. Small alterations were: added 1lb of baby carrots, used crushed garlic and increased the amount because we love  garlic, and used low sodium soy sauce. Try this one gang!

I decided to use low sodium soy sauce, which my husband said made it not be as flavorful.  Also, I broiled the chicken the last 30 minutes, which I hoped would make a good crust...it didn't.

This was a hit with my husband. Served over brown rice. This recipe seemed to call for a bit too much soy sauce, which seemed like it would be incredibly salty. So I only used half of the sauce mixture. The other half went into a freezer bag with more chicken, a quick prep meal for another night!

Even after cutting the amount of sauce, it was  still a bit salty. Next time, I will add a bit of water & a little more basil.

Flavor of sauce was very good, although a little on the salty side. I used "less sodium" soy sauce, too. I will probably cut the amount of soy sauce back and try to find a substitute.

This recipe was really easy and I liked it, but it was not a wow.  That being said, I did use tomatoe paste instead of ketchup as I was trying to cut some of the sodium from the recipe which may have impacted the taste?  If I tried it again I would probably use apricot or peach jam for sweetness and to increase the flavor instead of honey.  To me honey tasted sweet but not flavorful.  There was TONS of sauce which I think I will try and use up by making with crockpot meatballs.   Thanks

Did everything the same, except subbed thighs for tenders.  Maybe that's why it was burnt when I pulled it out the pot?

Super simple!  I doubled the recipe and used breasts instead of thighs!  I doubled the garlic (we love it ), some of the honey I used had cinnamon in it, and I added diced onions!  My dinner guests, all family, loved it, even the picky 7 yr. old!  My girls both asked for the recipe!  Both of them use this site also, as I had already recommended it to them. One had the recipe added to her fav. list before she left! Thanx for the ever so easy recipe! I will definitely use this one again, and may try some of the additions others have suggested!

This was one easy peasy tasty recipe. I put it together sunday night and turned on Mondau before work. I didnt measure anything I kind of just eyeballed the ingredients it was pretty good. I liked that it was quick and simple. I served this with green beans and potatoes. I'd make this again, but not regularly.

Deliciously moist chicken.  Makes plenty of "marinade" so don't feel like you have to double the ingredients for more chicken.

I just made this tonight and it came out AMAZING. Thank you so much for sharing :)  We used Boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs, but did everything else just as instructed. Really was delicious!

Loved it, tasty and easy to make.  I used boneless skinless chicken and put it in the crockpot on low for 5 hours and it was perfect.

The soy sauce was very overpowering making it extremely salty. The sauce was more like a soup than a glaze. I will try this recipe again but I will cut the soy sauce in half and double the garlic and maybe throw in a little brown sugar.

Before I make something new I ask myself two things - Is it easy to prepare, and do we have the ingredients?  Well this one fit the bill.  It uses ingredients that everyone should already have, and it was simple to make.  More importantly, it tasked great.  My whole family (2 adults and two young kids) loved it.  I doubled the whole recipe - chicken and other ingredients.  This one will be a family staple.

SO I did everything according to the recipe, except I put in 6 thighs and there was still a ton of sauce. After the chicken was done I put the sauce from the crock pot into a pan and boiled it down a little and added more honey to make it slightly sweeter. I made this with rice and broccoli and turned it into Chinese food.

This was a big hit for a hungry crew at a potluck. I quadrupled the amount of chicken thighs and doubled the liquids. In the future, I'll probably use a lot less liquid...the sauce was thin and I want to go for a thick, sticky version.

First slow cooker recipe I've tried...I followed to a the letter but left it on warm for a few hours before serving and the chicken was black and pot full of grease, still edible, but too salty. I will say since it's my first time I should give it another shot... think next time I will use low sodium soy sauce and serve right when done.

I followed this recipe exactly. I am having a hard time with this recipe. Prep was easy but I did not expect so much watery "sauce" in my finished product nor did I expect the boiled consistency of the chicken. I had to finish the sauce on my stovetop as I did not have cornstarch on hand, and I had to finish the chicken in the oven...

I love the flavors together. So delicious. However i used chicken tenderloin. I sautéed the chicken and then pour the sauce over ther chicken. I let that cook then transferred it to a baking sheet. To thicken the sauce I add a tsp of flour and then I brushed it on top of the meat and let it bake for about 15 mins. It was so good with the perfect amount of crust on top.

It was tasty for my first attempt, but I will be tweaking things going forward.  First, low sodium soy sauce is a must.  I also might experiment with brands of ketchup for flavor.  Also, I would add some pineapple to this dish.

This recipe is fabulous!! There are only a few pieces of advice I would offer. Firstly, save your money & use bone-in thighs. The meat is so tender, it will fall right off the bone. I remove the skins, as I don't like that much added fat. I cooked at least 8 thighs using this amount of sauce. Once the chicken is cooked, I remove the chicken & thicken the sauce with a tablespoon of corn starch & water. Serve it over rice or with noodles. Plus, we keep any left over sauce & use it later in the week for a stir fry.

The chicken was fall off the bone yummy. I used skin on chicken thighs and I noticed the skin was very salty. I couldn't even eat it. I would do this recipe again but I will add more honey.

This should be called "soy sauce chicken."  The honey and garlic were completely overpowered by the soy sauce.  It was all I could taste.  The chicken did turn out tender.  Would not make this again.

This was an excellent, extremely easy week-night meal.  I used bone in, skin-on thighs.  The flavor was very good & everyone gobbled it up.  I had 7 thighs & the amount of liquid was fine.  Served with jasmine rice and steamed veggies.  (My only reason for not giving this 5 stars is because I have had other teriyaki sauces that are better. But this recipe was faster & ready to eat after a long day of sports).

Great taste. I used (halved) boneless chicken breasts. Only had to cook 4 hours. The yummy smell woke me up. Great sauce/recipe; will cook again!

This recipes is way too salty for my taste.  I even tried low sodium soy sauce to decrease the amount of sodium, but that didn't help at all.

I will admit that the family liked it a whole lot more than me.  Pros: It was tender and a decent flavor. 

Cons: The soy sauce is too overpowering.  And i would go with a few more thighs if you have a family of four like i do.  They reduced in size quite a bit after cooking.

Not a fan!!  Was looking forward to making it and was disappointed.  Saving grace was we tasted it toward the end and added brown sugar.
New to using a slow cooker but the other recipes we tried have been delicious.

This is definitely one my new favorites.  I was making a list for the store and the only thing that I had to buy was the chicken.  Everything else was in the pantry.  The chicken was so moist that it was falling off the bone.  I served it with zucchini and couscous.  It was delicious.  I was telling my co-workers about it and started drooling!  So easy; will go in the regular weeknight rotation.

easy & fast & tasty , however if you want it to look like the picture I think you need to broil it at the end . I used boneless chicken breasts and cooked them on low for 4 hours. Makes plenty of sauce to put over rice or potatoes. the family loved it

This recipe taste good but looked ugly.  I used 2lbs of chicken strips and the meat came out very dark.  Once I convinced everyone to try they enjoyed the flavor but was put off by its appearance (children).

I made the recipe as written, and found that six hours on low was about an hour or so too much.  I don't know if I should have used a smaller crockpot (I used my 6 qt) or if I just needed to reduce the time.  It was okay, but I'd only make it again with some alterations.  Thanks for the easy idea!

This was such a success with all 4 of us that I am prepping another batch for the freezer. I added fresh sliced mushrooms, and next time I will add fresh diced eggplant. I served it with quinoa made with bullion.

5 stars for easiness of preparation, but the chicken was dry and the sauce wasn't groundbreaking.

Delicious! But I do have to admit that I didn't cook this in the slow cooker. I had the intentions to but time passed too quickly so I followed everything to the letter and popped it all into a Pyrex dish with Pyrex glass lid and cooked in the oven for 1hr10, took the lid off then cooked for a further 15-20mins at 180c (fan) while the rice was cooking.. It was yummy and even my son who is an extremely picky eater ate the lot and asked for more... Oh and I used low sodium soy sauce and the salt level in this meal was spot on!

Next time I make it I will add some chilli to please my fiancé who loves spicy food.

For 6 chicken thighs, used 1/4 cup less sodium soy sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, and 1/2 of 1/3 cup of honey. Used same amount of garlic and basil. Baked at 375 for 20 minutes followed by 5 min broil. Used for chicken salad and tasted great!

Fine, but not great.  I think it needs more to be good (maybe some brown sugar and some sweet chili sauce).  Honey can be a nightmare to get out of slow cooker, make sure to spray the crockpot with nonstick first.

In deference to all the comments that said the 1/2 cup of soy sauce made it salty (and the fact that I didn´t have enough at home) caused me to only include about 1/4 cup in the final recipe. To balance, I included a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Otherwise, all was the same. 

I did not enjoy the flavor of it at all. The flavor of the ketchup almost entirely overwhelmed the honey. My husband said he liked the flavor, so perhaps it was just me. I probably won´t make this again, though.

Fantastic.  I used 10 chicken thighs with the bone in and kept the rest of the recipe the same.  Cooked for 5.5 hrs on low and then removed the liquid.  Kept the chicken on warm till ready to serve.  I reduced the liquid to 1/3 and served it over the chicken.

Very tasty!  I read a couple of reviews that said it was too salty, so I erred on the side of caution and used low sodium soy sauce.  It was perfect!  Big hit with my husband, too.  I'll make this again.

I am the first to admit that I am not a good cook. I followed others advice and I cut the soy sauce in half then I followed the recipe. I cooked the chicken for 5 hours and to my surprised it was very good!

This was very bitter. A bit oily as well. I used chicken thighs with bone in and skin on so that would be why but the sauce was terrible. The chicken was delicious and moist so I will do it in the croc pot again but next time I would use a different sauce for sure.

Very quick prep, most ingredients around the home. SO Delicious! Juicy and flavorful. A new family favorite and staple. A definite go to recipe for the working woman.

Excellent and easy recipe for this rookie. I have prepared it twice, both times using chopped oregano leaves for basil, and frozen chicken thighs with bone in and skin on. Used four thighs the first time, but six the second time while keeping the recipe the same with the same great results. Mahalo! (Thanks!)

Well, we ate it all, and it wasn't bad, we just weren't blown away. We ended up with a bit of a scorched flavor that we didn't enjoy and while the chicken itself was falling apart the flavors just didn't blow us away.

Delicious and easy. Added chopped carrots, celery and onion to the mix and thickened up the gravy by adding a flour and water mixture during the last 15 minutes. Thank you for sharing!

I didn't have time to get this in the slow cooker so I cooked in the oven on 325 like another reviewer for an hour but they weren't quite done so I turned up to 400 for a few minutes. I will definitely do the slow cooker next time bc the flavor didn't get soaked in the chicken good but the outside was great and I added chicken legs to the recipe as well. I think next time I would add some brown sugar and maybe some more honey but my family loved it! thanks for sharing!

I increased the ingredients to 50% more since I added 4 more thighs. Didn't need to do that there was enough sauce as it was. I basted the chicken every so often . Favor was not great.

Excellent!  I served over rice, the reserved liquid makes a great sauce!  I'm going to try it with wings next time, as an appetizer
