This was excellent! The only change I recommend is waiting 10 minutes or so to add the green onions on top. As you can see from the picture, mine got a little too brown in the last 10 minutes. Next time I might add some crumbled bacon but it was still excellent as written.

For those that said there is nothing in the instructions about mashing please read the entire instructions.

I agree with Kel - nothing in here about mashing the actual potatoes in the pot and when they are added to the other ingredients.  Sounds like a good recipe but it's missing a step or two!

This was delicious and I like make ahead dishes, but since it is so very rich, I wonâ€™t make it too often. I skipped the cheddar on top as it seemed unnecessary.

Made this for Christmas dinner side dish instead of the traditional mashed potatoes. It was a hit with everyone that came.

I made this the day before serving it. I wanted mash potatoes but didn't want to be stuck in the kitchen when company was here!  It was good, but not great. I prefer my potatoes a little creamier. I would try a little extra milk/butter/cream cheese next time. I did make the recipe as written, with the only changes being I added more cheese on top and I didn't use the green onions.

I made this as a replacement to the mashed potatoes my ex wife used to make for Thanksgiving. It turned out great but that may have been too much garlic. I liked it but a couple of people commented on the strong garlic flavor. I told them that garlic was the first word in the name and we laughed. I'll lighten it up a bit next time they are here but otherwise it's going to stay like it is.

I never make changes the first time I try a recipe. This stands as a five-star recipe without changes. I took it to Thanksgiving dinner and it went very fast.

These mashed potatoes were really good however a little dry, next time I will add a little more milk, otherwise delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Was a great Christmas side dish to a standing rib roast.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Might become a Christmas menu tradition!
