I thought would be great to serve with our ham this weekend but we found it absolutely horrible.  We ended up throwing it out.  Mustard and whiskey don't go together at all.  I even used very quality whiskey and mustard at it still had a jarring taste.

This just tasted absolutely odd with the whiskey. I just did not enjoy it, sorry.

I was hesitant about making this recipe based off of the reviews but I am glad I did. Husband gave this a big thumbs up and said that whiskey and mustard pair perfectly together. I did end up adding another tablespoon of mustard to thicken it up and I am glad I did that too. I think it needed the extra bite to it. I used this with ham croquettes and it was delicious!
