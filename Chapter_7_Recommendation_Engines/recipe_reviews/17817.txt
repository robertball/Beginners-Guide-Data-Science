Good banana flavor, moist, dense.  A winner!  I used 4 very large very ripe bananas, which mashed = 2 cups, and the cake turned out perfectly.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon salt, for as an experienced baker, I know baked goods taste best with a bit of salt added.  Note however that I only baked the cake for 45 minutes in an oven calibrated to 350 degrees via my trusty oven thermometer.  I have found that substituting 1/4 cup of the butter with applesauce does not change the flavor or texture of the cake one iota, and does cut down the fat a smidge.  I also didn't put the topping on, as I don't like really sweet toppings.  A cream cheese frosting would be lovely.  I love this cake unfrosted -- a great and healthy snack cake, and a yummy breakfast alternative too.

This recipe was great!  My husband raved about it, which he never does!  I followed everything exactly except I added a little salt and only used 3 bananas because that's all I had.  I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting and it turned out perfect!

I made this cake but did not put the icing on it and I froze it for a month before I used it.   The cake was moist and received rave reviews by my guest.  You could not tell it had been frozen.

I decided to try this recipe after apparently misplacing my usual family banana cupcake recipe.  I cut this one in half and made 18 cupcakes and baked for about 15 minutes.  It's a great basic banana cake recipe, very fluffy, although I guess it didn't "wow" me.  I like that it uses sour cream instead of sour milk, because I've always hated the pain of remembering to sour some milk with vinegar an hour before mixing.  I skipped the topping and used plain chocolate frosting because I didn't have the topping ingredients on hand (and I'm not sure it would work with cupcakes...).  This recipe DEFINTELY needs some salt, which I planned to add on my own but forgot.  Perhaps using salted peanuts in the topping would have made up for this though.  It doesn't quite have the depth of flavor that a usual banana recipe with salt would have, but that would be easily remedied with a teaspoon or so in the full batch.  When I tried it plain it almost seems to have a baking soda aftertaste (maybe just a hint?), but with the frosting it was undetectable.  Considering how light and fluffy these were, I'd say it was just the right amount of soda and powder without being too much.  The big plus, which I consider to be the "make it or break it" for any cupcake recipe, is that this cake came out of the "wrappers" (baking cups) very easily - no sticking.

This was THE best cake!!  I think that the best way to eat this cake is after it has sat without being touched (only frosted) for a day or two.  Then it is the very best moist cake in the world!!  My family and I love this recipe!!

I love this recipe! The cake is fluffy with a mellow banana flavor and the topping is sooooo yummy!  I used pecans instead of peanuts, mini choc chips and added some coconut.  The topping came out sweet and crunchy with a great flavor.  A really different and delicious recipe for using ripe banana.  A keeper.

This should be called "The Best Ever Banana Cake". It is the best Banana cake on this site! Others masquerade as banana bread, but this is a light airy cake, perfect texture! Great if you have a ton of bananas to use up, I used 6 bananas in this. The only thing I didn't do was add the peanuts and sugar to the topping. Looking at reviews it didn't seem to go over well with some people, but the cake portion is absolutely perfect and deserves 5 stars!!

8.12.13 ...https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17817/banana-cake-viii/ ... I tried this years ago & truly thought I'd already rated it. It was by "Carolyn" then, but it's the same recipe.  I've tried 18l (no exaggeration) recipes, & so far, this is the best one.  It makes a nice, big cake; fills the pan.  I didn't do the topping though. 7/12 'Finally trying again. Decreased sugar to 1c. Subbed wheat flour for a half cup white. Used a stick of omega3SmartBalance & 2T marg. I don't think with fattening sour cream, that much more additional fat is needed to make a good cake.  Also, it's kinda weird to add so little sour cream alternately with flour - so I didn't. :)  'Added it to the bowl & gradually added the flour mixture. Added 1/2t salt & didn't do the topping. It's done at 35min. Maybe it was done earlier. 'Haven't tried it yet. 8/12 'Tried w buttermilk instead & baked in 9.5x13.5.  Good size, doesn't mound so much.  Done in 45 min. 8/13 24 cupcakes in 20 minutes. I lessened fat more by only using 1/2c butter.  Of course, I topped with cream cheese frosting.  :D  Not that these are low, but could maybe have made 18, but I'd rather have'em stay in the liners & not bake on the tin - if ya know where I'm going ... ;D

Really good but check your cake as mine took less time to bake (about40mins)and add a pinch of salt, I skipped the peanuts, mixed the chocolate chips into the batter and added 3/4 cups of shredded coconut to make it extra moist and reduced sugar to 1 cup.  Served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.    a lot of bowl licking!  Thanks

I found this cake, dense and moist, which is a pleaser. I was disappointed with the topping. I used pecans as some other users had noted and found that the pecans kinda burnt, not bad, but a bit. Neither the chocolate chips, nor the sugar melted and I even covered it with foil in the last 20 minutes to prevent it from burning. If I make this again, I'll put the choco chips IN the batter and add some butter to the topping and cut it like you would the topping for an apple crisp. I also used 8 bananas and used coconut oil instead of margarine or butter. I used yogourt instead of sour cream and cut down on the sugar. The cake was perfect!!! The topping was a little off, all in all, still a crowd pleaser.

I only made the cake as I am allergic to nuts.  I used a sour cream frosting that was in the cupboard and added banana flavoring.  It was great!

Just what I needed.  I was making a layer cake, so I omitted the peanuts, mixed in 3/4 C. chocolate chips, put peanut butter frosting between the layers and then frosted the outside with sour cream chocolate frosting. Yum.

I love banana cake, and have tried so many recipes!  This one is by far my family's favorite.  I usually make a cream cheese frosting, but since this one has the nut/choc chip topping, it saves a step-super quick and easy.

I submitted the only picture so far... as you can see, I made mine as cupcakes. I did had 1/2 tsp of salt to the main batter. It took almost 25 minutes for cupcakes.  Keep an eye on these.  Reading the reviews, I couldn't decide between the topping in the recipe, cream cheese or blueberries - so this way I could make a few of each.  Poured into cupcake pan and topped.  For the cream cheese I mixed in powdered sugar then pushed it into the batter so it was a filling in the center.  My kid likes the chocolate topping best (w/o peanuts), my husband the cream cheese and I love the blueberry (I used fresh).  The batter recipe is great, just experiment with what topping you like.

This was a great dessert.  Next time I make it I may lower the sugar to 1 cup.  I found it quite sweet.  There is enough sweetness in the bananas to make up for it.  My husband has already asked for it to take to work and share!  I also iced it with a cream cheese icing.  MMMmmmmm

You see the problem with finding bananas for 15 cents a pound is buying too many and watching them go overly ripe on the table!  This cake is the perfect solution!  I made it w/o the topping and it was so good.  I also reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and used buttermilk instead of sour cream.  You can't even tell.  You can put squares into lunches boxes or put a little cream cheese frosting and sprinkling of chopped walnuts on top would also be wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

The topping is really nice (what's not to like).  The cake part itself was fine, nothing exceptional.  Actually, a tad dry for some reason.

This was okay. It wasn't bad, just not that great.  If your looking for a basic banana cake recipe that's easy to make, then this is the recipe for you! Since the cake is so thick (height wise), I would recommend making a layer of the brown sugar/choc. chip mix halfway through the batter and then top it with the brown sugar mix.

Very good and moist. Especially enjoyed the topping. Next time will add an 8 ounce can of drained, crushed pineapple, a cup of coconut and a cup of chopped walnuts just because I like these things.

I made this recipe for my co-workers and they loved it. In fact one of them said they did not take a breath between bites and had to have seconds.

A very nice banana cake with an interesting 'frosting'.  A bit rich so next time I will sprinkle with the brown sugar-peanut mixture and then drizzle with MELTED chocolate chips.  Not as messy either.  I advise trying it for a change from plain old banana bread!

Made others and to date, this is the best one!  I don't use the toppling.  Also, don't change a thing, as it is perfect as is.

Giving this recipe 5 stars because it DESERVES it!! Yes the cake did take longer to bake BUT, that is not a recipe issue, ovens cook at different time frames depending on altitude & ovens.
This cake is moist and very tasty! I even forgot the chocolate chips this time but will remember next time, I'm sure. Chocolate chips will just give it more WOW factor and it already has plenty of that. I used walnuts instead of peanuts because that is my preference. I will definitely make this again & probably more often than I honestly should, :-) because I tend to buy too many bananas for the purpose of making muffins. I think this recipe just booted my muffin recipe out of my kitchen for awhile & we will now have this wonderful banana cake !! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it's a KEEPER!!

Tastes good but I think the 50-60minute cooking time is too long.
The amount of sugar for the topping is a little much too.

I made this cake for a gathering and everyone liked it.
But there was a bitter taste in your mouth after.
I can only guess that it was from the baking soda?
As much as we liked it when we were eating it,i could 
never make it again,because of the nasty after taste.

Light and delicious! I cut down to 4 bananas due to previous reviews that the cake was too dense and more bread-like. I also added 1/2 tsp of salt. I opted to make cupcakes instead of a sheet cake and the recipient yielded 27 cupcakes. I cooked them for about 18 minutes. Topped with creamy chocolate frosting from this site. Delicious!

I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the chocolate chip/nut topping and it was absolutely delicious. I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Great way to use up old bananas. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent! We always have bananas getting too ripe and didn't want to make bread again so I tried this.  Very moist and tasty.  Didn't change a thing, wouldn't change a thing.

A great cake!  The cook time is WAY too high.  I would follow what other reviewers suggested and decrease the time to 40 mins.  Mine was a little overdone, but the strudel topping was amazing!  I didn't have peanuts in mine, and I really didn't miss them.

The only reason I'm giving these four stars, instead of five is because I changed them a bit... I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce.  Then, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown.  Used buttermilk instead of the sour cream.  Mixed the mini chocolate chips in.  Didn't bother with the topping, and made into cupcakes.  Yield: 39 full size.  Check at 13 minutes!!  (Topped with Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting and animal sprinkles for kid appeal) YUM!!!

This is a nice change to the ordinary banana breads that are out there. I think the only thing I would change would be the peanuts to walnuts. Only because my daughter likes walnuts with her banana breads. This is a moist cake with a balanced flavor of banana. VERY GOOD receipe.. I definate keeper. Thanks!

This cake is wonderful! I didn't make the topping, I frosted it with cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips on top (I have a sweet tooth!) It's really, really good! Thank you!
