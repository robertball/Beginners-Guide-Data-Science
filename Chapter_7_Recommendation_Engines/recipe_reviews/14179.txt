I really liked the combination of chicken, cashews, celery, and fruit. However, the dressing was too bland for me and the almond flavoring just didn't seem to work. I would make this again, but I would add curry to the dressing instead of the almond flavoring.

My family loved it.  Left out the apples, added more pineapple tidbits, added a lg. can of mandarin oranges and glazed the nuts.  Didn't use the almond extract added curry powder instead.  Good the next day too.

This was such a big hit that anytime we have family get togethers everyone wants me to bring it. So much for potatoe salad. Thanks for this great recipe and for the great reviews I got for making it. Linda

Fabulous recipe!! My only addition to this recipe was green grapes.  If you're going to make this a day ahead, wait to add the cashews until just before serving so they stay crunchy.  I served this at our 30th wedding anniversary open house and people raved about it.  I will make this often!!

I took this to a "salad supper" and it did not go over well @ all.  It was too sweet and the almond extract gave it a funky flavor.  Even though no one told me that they didn't like the recipe it was pretty evident when more than half was left.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Excellent -- I took the advice from other raters and it was prefect! Here’s what I did: 3 cups cooked pasta shells, no cashews, 2 full chicken breasts, 6 oz pineapple tidbits, 1/2 cup reserved pineapple juice, 1 big red delicious apple (peels on), 1/3 cup celery, 1/3 cup carrots (shredded with a serrated knife), 1 can mandarin oranges, 1/2 cup red grapes, 1 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, 3 tablespoons mint flakes. I also used the remaining pineapple juice and the mandarin orange juice to boil the pasta. Good stuff, very pretty! Update: Didn't like next day...

This is a refreshingly different chicken salad. The almond extract adds a wonderful flavor that enhances the apples and the chicken! Thanks for sharing, Maggie!

VERY GOOD! I would add more pasta than it calls for. I used red apples and no almond flavoring.. EXCELLENT!

This recipe leaves a lot to be desired.  The flavor, consistency, color, everyone ate a very small serving, but no one took seconds.  I usually get rave reviews on my dishes from my friends, but NOT THIS ONE.  I definitely wouldn't do this again.

I made this recipe today for my fiancé.  He loves it but he said more nuts.  I used clementine oranges instead...Very good salad.  It would be a great recipe for picnic.

My family loved this recipe.  I was a little skeptical about the almond extract, but added it anyway.  The flavor of the dressing was great on the salad.  I don't usually care for pasta salad, but this one is very tasty.  The celery & mandarin oranges are critical to the salad for color.  Everything else in it is white and not very pretty.  I used fat free mayo and will probably leave out the cashews next time to make it very low fat.

I gave the recipe 3 stars because two of my guests loved it.  I didn't.  I used Perdue already cooked chicken and that may have been the problem since the flavor of the chicken did battle with the mayo/pineapple juice.  The toasted cashews are a MUST to make it edible and I added extra pineapple, extra pineapple juice, red seedless grapes and yellow apples (unpeeled).  It was a lot of work for something I don't want to eat.

Yum!  In an attempt to reduce calories I used low fat Miracle Whip.  I've made this following the recipe exactly, and also made it at the last minute, having to make a few substitutions (almonds instead of cashews, etc).  It comes out awesome every time!!

Pretty good, though my 17 month old wasn't thrilled.  Modified a few things: no cashews (my daughter can't eat them) or celery, added more chicken (canned - got lazy), pineapple, oranges, apples, dressing.  Makes a ton!

I absolutely LOVED this salad that I made for a potluck family reunion!  Others loved it too.  I think the almond extract makes the whole recipe and gives it a very unique flavor.  I doubled the recipe and used Light Miracle Whip, 3 different kinds of pasta, added grapes, and i added a handful of freshly chopped mint leaves.  Delicious!  I will definitely make this many times in the future.

Wonderful, refreshing salad!  I added a little salt after tasting it to balance out the flavor, because it was pretty sweet.  I also used fat free mayo.  Great recipe!

Thanks for the great recipe! I made this for a family potluck and received many requests for the recipe.  I made this when grapes aren't in season and added raisins.

This pasta salad is a welcome change from the routine tuna macaroni pasta salad! Everyone's taste is different and the recipe is easily customized. I omit celery and add finely diced sweet red or orange pepper, or alternately a handful of chopped dried cranberries, just for some colour. I also use a little mandarin orange juice in the dressing for added sweetness. I usually take this salad to family barbecues and some have commented that this is like dessert!

I was transferred to another office several months back, and they are not permitted to have a microwave, so I needed to come up with new things for lunch.  This has been a staple of mine!  I make it regularly, and I don't get the least bit tired of it.  I omit the almond extract, I don't like the way it makes the recipe taste.

This is a great recipe.  I added more pineapple and more mandarin oranges than called for, and also some chopped parsley for color.  I couldn't find Gravenstein apples, so substituted another variety.  Might try leaving the apple peel on a red apple, for additional color.

Delicious!  I made it with Louis Rich Carving Board Chicken so that made it even easier.

I sprinkled with Mrs. Dash and paprika and baked then for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees instead of cooking them.

We thought this was very good!  I made a partial batch and could have added a little more chicken to it.  When I had cleaned up everything, taken a photo, and consumed the salad, I found the bowl with the cashews in it that I accidentally left out of the salad!  I followed the recipe otherwise--including the almond extract, though going just a little shy on that.  I would definitely make this again!  The only thing I felt it was missing was a little color.  The next time I would at least leave the skin on the apple and maybe add some red bell pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's awesome! I had it at a baby shower and everyone was asking for the recipe. The almond extract is what makes it great. I use Granny Smith apples. I've never seen a Gravenstein apple in the store.
