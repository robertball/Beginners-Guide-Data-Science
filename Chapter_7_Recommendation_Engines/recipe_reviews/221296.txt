These were quick and easy and made a great summer dinner.  I love using the panini press to make quesadillas so I don't heat up the kitchen. I just used enough alfredo sauce to coat the chicken mixture - didn't want it soupy and messy.  It was perfect for us!

I'm sorry this just wasn't for us. I made it as stated in the recipe, but the flavor combo didn't work for us, and it was a lot of trouble to make -  It didn't look very appetizing after mixing in the alfredo sauce either - I think I would leave that out of the mix and just add some on top of the filling (or leave it off all together), but I won't be making this again.
