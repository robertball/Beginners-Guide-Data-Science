I brought this to a potluck and the dish was scraped clean. Everyone loved it. I used one cup of Monterey Jack and one cup of Gruyere for a little extra flavor. Next time I may try adding a bit of gorgonzola.

Many thanks to Giovanna!! This is fabulous I just served this at our Easter dinner (with ham) and everyone in my family enjoyed it most had seconds. We are all pretty much onion lovers anyway but never have I had onions fixed this way. I followed the recipe to a tee I did strain the onions because there was quite a bit of liquid in the pan that I thought should not end up in the sauce...glad I did it was just perfect!!!

This recipe rated 5 stars with me - and I'm a hard marker! It came out of the oven hot and creamy - slightly browned on the top. The family raved about it - even my daughter who dislikes onions. Used Ritz crackers rather than breadcrumbs. I think the secret to making this dish is to cook the sliced onions with a gentle saute first - take your time! When they start becoming translucent - thats when they are ready. This receipe will be a keeper in this house.

I made this for a famly dinner three Chrismas's ago. I've been asked to make it every Chrismas since and I believe everyone in the family has asked me for the recipe. Over the years I have tweaked it a bit to my own liking. I double the white sauce and don't add the cheese to it. I layer the cheese in with the rest of the layers ending with cheese on top. If you like onions you'll love this!

We love onions but found that when made according to the recipe this one comes up short. The cheese sauce was a little gooey from the flour and when finished baking the onions were not cooked enough. Perhaps I need more details in the directions about what to expect at various stages. All is not lost though as I may try it again with my own little tweeks like carmelizing the onions first and thinning the cheese sauce.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. It was fast easy and absolutely delicious. The only thing I would add the next time would be a touch of paprika or cayenne to add a little zip.

I made this without any changes and it was pretty good. I think my wife liked it better than I. Next time instead of using bread crumbs I will use Ritz Cracker crumbs instead. That will give it a little more pazaaz!

I thought this was good maybe a little bland but husband RAVED. I used some ailing garlic tostini as my seasoned breadcrumbs. Will definitely make again but might try to "doctor" a little.

I've made this twice. First time cooked onions as directed and the whole thing was runny. Second time I put the onions in the crockpot overnight drained them and then made the casserole and got rave reviews. Numerous people asked for the recipe. I'll definitely make again!

So amazing! Everyone loved it this Thanksgiving and is requesting that I make it for Christmas as well. The only thing I changed was the milk to half and half. It made it rich and wonderful!.

I wouldn't want this for an everyday dinner of a meat and just one or two sides... too rich. But as one of several sides for a holiday meal or pot luck dinner it's very good. We served it for Christmas dinner this year and everyone loved it. (My nephew suggested making it the base for a ham casserole which might be an idea worth experimentation.)

This recipe was so delicious. It was cheesy warm and gooey.I couldn't stop eating it!:) It is a wonderful side dish for any occasion. And would be excellent with bite size peices of chicken in it as well.

I liked this recipe. I didn't need to make any changes and I don't think it needs any but it didn't make anyone in my house "ooh" and "aah". I will probably make this again but it is not going to be a regular feature at my house.

This was very good. It had a rich onion texture without the staunch of a strong onion. I baked a tad bit longer and then let sit to soak up the flavor. There were no leftovers. I will make this dish again for church or dinner at home.

We enjoyed this. The only thing I did different was to use a little less flour and added garlic powder to the cheese mixture. Next time I think I will only put the breadcrumbs on top.

I added garlic to the onions and drained them before layering them in the casserole dish. I served this with ham instead of my usual macaroni and cheese. They were wonderful! One of our guests suggested putting the leftovers over grilled burgers--which I'll try tonight!

Turned out great for a TG gathering! I made this gluten free by using GF flour and crunching up some Nut Thins to use as bread crumbs.

Absolutely wonderful! Served it with beef tenderloin and it was just perfect. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix. Thank you Elizasmum! We'll be doing this again.
