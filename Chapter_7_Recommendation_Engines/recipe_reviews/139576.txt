OMG, Im surprised to see this recipe here.  I did this a long time ago and I thought it tasted really good with regular hot dogs too.  I folded my tortillas like an envelope and cooked it in a pan with a little butter.  Makes it a little crispier (but not dry) than cooking it all in the micro.  It's very good as a school lunch or to the beach/picnic.

I'm not a fan of sliced sandwich cheese, but really liked it!!!! Next time I'll try with shredded cheese.

Iâ€™m on day 4 of my journey to vegetarianism lol and I was trying to find creative ideas for a quick and simple, meatless dinner. This was perfect! I used a tortilla and split it in half, threw it on my stovetop grill, added a slice of cheese on each half, grilled 2 veggie dogs, and voila! A simple, meatless dinner! Served with carrots and hummus on the side!

This recipe is for vegetarian hot dogs,   but you can use real meat.

I followed the recipe as-is, except for the sliced cheese. I didn't have sliced cheese on hand, and I just realized shredded cheese contains animal rennet, so I used cream cheese. Sounds weird, but turned out great.

Quick and tasty. I microwaved the hot dogs but instead of microwaving the tortilla I tossed the butter into a frying pan and toasted them on the stove. Easy lunch. I did not use a vegetarian hot dog.
