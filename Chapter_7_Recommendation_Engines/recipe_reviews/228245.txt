Very good and easy.  My daughter and I did it together and everything was already in the cabinet. I didn't have jars available but just used other glass storage bowls and I think it was even better because they could keep on marinating.  I'm sure we will use this recipe again and again. Thanks!

I love this recipe.  I'm still new at pickling, and have basically followed the recipe.  I'm using the apple cider vinegar and added a little garlic and some homemade hot pepper flakes .  They come out sweet and zesty.  Will be trying more pickling!!

Make sure you take the rind of full size (not pickling size) cucumbers. It's edible but can be a little crunchy. Not pickle crunchy. These are good. We're enjoying them and they likely won't last three weeks!
