I gave this recipe a 3 for a base recipebut made changes.  I saut√©ed one onion with 3-4 minced garlic with 1/4 cup olive oil.  I added a bag of frozen cut green beans ( Romano are the best but hard to find where I am). Once they change color I add a can of herbed diced tomatoes salt and pepper to taste and more cinnamon.  I also add half a can of rinsed chickpeas for protein.  Let simmer 15 mins to the flavours can meld.  You can serve this warm or have it cold just add more olive oil to your liking.

I used canned green beans. I wasn't thrilled with the recipe to be honest.

I make this dish often with a few changes .. First brown lamb shoulder or pieces of lamb.  Add onions, brown,  and garlic.  When meat is browned add enough water to stew meat.  When meat is tender add fresh green beans,.  Season with salt and pepper. Add  tomato sauce or paste, whichever u prefer and a pinch of cinnamon.  Cook until green beans are soft and sauce has thickened.  Serve over rice.
