The texture of these muffins is nice. especially since they don't require any oil or butter.  I added 1/4 tsp salt and decreased the poppy seeds to 1/4 C and it was still a LOT of poppy seeds.  I didn't really like the flavor of the orange extract in these muffins- at the very least I think I'd add some zest if making again.  Also, the batch made 22 regular-size muffins rather than the 12 the recipe states.

This recipe needs some adjustments.  The texture was good, but 1tsp each of baking soda and baking powder was too much - it was the main flavor of the muffins.  3tbsp of poppyseeds was about right, so 1/2c would probably be way too much.  I did substitute 1tsp lemon juice and 1tsp orange peel for the orange extract.

I made these according to the recipe. They were heavy and rather bland in flavor.

I rate it 4/5 stars because you could really taste the orange flavor and it was very sweet but we made a few mistakes that didn't make it taste very good.

Not much taste.  Stale after one day, because of the low- fat content.  They were much better right away, warm from oven,  but even then, could have had more taste.

Good flavor but needs some butter or oil in the batter. They stuck to the cup cake paper. I added raisins & chocolate chips.

The only change I made was lemon extract instead of orange, because it was what I had in my cupboard.  These are very good!
