This was very, very tasty - so that earned 5 stars; however the consistency was off (very, very runny)and that earned it 3 stars.  Together we get 4 stars.  I will make it again and thicken it with a roux next time.

The dish will not be runny if the sauce is left to simmer for the full 8 min.  No chance it could be runny if using heavy cream and simmering.  It was a nice, smooth sauce. I added sun dried tomatoes and a precooked rotisserie chicken to save on time. Omitted red pepper flakes and white wine for kids.  Still quite good.

Reading this recipe it sounded heavenly.I skipped down to the nutritional values and knew I could not add salt.It had a lot of spices to make up for this.I could lighten the fat using light cream and less cheese.I forgot wine so added low salt vegetable broth as needed to thin the sauce it didn't need much .The sauce thicken as promised.I cubed the chicken.Served with a green salad this was delicious!!!

Tweaked this a little for a lower calorie result.  Giving 5 stars because it's a great starter recipe. It was easy to make changes to fit my family's tastes

This was really good! Though I did modify slightly to make it come together easier, as the instructions made things more complicated than they needed to be... I combined the seasonings with a 1/4 cup of flour and dredged the chicken cutlets after pounding them thin; I also steamed the vegetables, instead of boiling and blanching... I didn't have mushrooms, but next time I'll definitely add them. The cream sauce was delicious and thick like an Alfredo. A very easy weekday dish to prepare. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely loved it! My whole family thought it was great! I grilled the chicken only because we've been in the grilling mode lately, and ladled sauce and veggies over chicken and pasta..  I am sure it is great as written too!  Added a bit of cornstarch at the end just to thicken a little.  Will definitely make again! Thank you!!!

This is delicious. We did everything pretty much according to the recipe, though we did include a yellow summer squash in addition to the zucchini. We also included a red bell pepper and used half and half rather than heavy cream. It is excellent.
