Hello everyone I am the original poster of this recipe. and i just wanted to say that I have never added a can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers. its always just been a can of diced tomatoes and then a jar of green salsa. I dont know why that was added to this recipe.Just wanted to let you all know. thanks Glad you guys are liking it.

Fabulous!  Spicy, filling and healthy...not to mention easy!  Kids had a hard time with the spice, but after they added some cheese and crushed chips they were good to go.  I used Rotel Mild tomatoes with chilis.

OMG!  This is absolutely delish but I did make some changes. I used one can of garbanzos along with one can of the white beans.   In addition, added 2 cloves of minced garlic and doubled up on the cumin because I wanted to actually taste that smokey essence. To thicken it up a bit at the end and to add more of the salt factor I added some Queso Quesadilla. It adds an amazing background flavor along with a little creaminess.   Served with sliced avocados and corn bread. Serious comfort food.

One change - I've made this a couple of times and at the end I add either some tortilla chips, about a hand-full, or some cornmeal. It helps thicken it up a bit. Overall, a really good recipe. My husband actually asks for it - very rare for a guy whose stock answer to the question "What do you want for dinner tonight?" is "I don't know..." I get asked to make this about once a week and I don't mind at all because this recipe is fantastic. It's also inexpensive, especially if you start with dried beans, use a bullion cube instead of canned broth, etc.

I needed something quick to throw in the crockpot and come upon this recipe. I had everything but the green salsa, so I improvised with what I did have and threw in a can of ranch style beans with jalapenos. I upped the oregano to 3/4, added a packet of dry ranch, and added some garlic for flavor. Put it on high for 4 hrs, and came home to deliciousness! Served with shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and warm flour tortillas. It was awesome! Would recommend to anyone. I'm sure if mine was thrown together and improvised that the original version with green salsa is even more delicious.

I made this for our office 'chili cook off' Halloween party. I followed the recipe almost exactly and made a double batch. The only thing I changed was the amount of chicken broth. I used about a can and a half because I like my chili a little more chunky. I also used 'chili ready' tomatoes instead of diced with peppers (which I think are still about the same thing anyway). However, mine didn't turn out like the rest of the pictures show. It's definitely more on the red side rather than white like it looks here. After adding the cheese and sour cream to my bowl, along with crushed tortilla chips, it looked more like the picture. I turned my crock pot on at 9pm and left it on low. At about 6:30 the next morning I stirred it up and turned it to warm. The taste- AMAZING! I was actually surprised because I've never made chili before so I didn't know what to expect. Super easy and super tasty. Mine isn't that spicy (probably because I didn't use the rotel tomatoes) but I don't prefer spicy anyway. Definitely a great recipe!

Do you need something to clear your sinuses?? This'll do it!  Whew!  That's some mighty tasty stuff!  My general impression of this recipe is that it is an excellent and very versatile 'base' to start with; you can easily modify it with lots of different additions to make it *just like you like it*. The flavor and consistency reminded me more of tortilla soup than chili, but the beans make it chili. It would be excellent with any kind of 'Mexican' or Tex-Mex foods like tortilla chips, sour cream, avocado, black beans, etc. or cheeses like cheddar or Monterrey jack. I admit that I'm a wimp when it comes to all things spicy-hot, and I hate onions. Obviously I skipped the onions, and I also used mild Rotel and only a small 7 ounce can of salsa verde. That made the spice just right for me--very tasty but not overwhelming.  I love cumin and oregano so I really heaped them up in the measuring spoons. Otherwise I prepared it according to directions and loved it. Its not something I'll make once a week, but I'll keep it in the recipe box to make every once in a while. It's good comfort food, and incredibly easy and versatile.

Crockpot Chicken Chili Haiku: "This didn't 'wow' us. Green salsa overpowered. Soupy and so-so." I will try any variation of chili, and this recipe's only non-disappointment was that it was easy to have in the crockpot b4 work, but upon serving, we realized that the entire jar of salsa verde was just too strong, and that, coupled w/ the broth made it entirely too watery for us, resulting in using a slotted spoon. Happy to have given it a try though!

First off, I'm rating it 5 stars with my changes, because I've only made it this once:
I bought petite diced tomatoes, and rinsed them before adding, I also used 3 cans of white beans,  1 lg can of white hominy, and half a pound of frozen white corn. At the end I added a little water, and some cayenne pepper for heat.  Toppings were sour cream, cheese, diced avocado, chopped cilantro and Fritos.  
It was delicious and we are now ditching our old chili recipe in favor of this one.  Everyone agreed this was amazing!

Excellent!  This recipe is a much lighter and not as heavy as traditional red bean, chili powder type chilis. Skip the chicken broth if you want it really thick.  I added just 1 cup of broth which at first seemed watery until I removed the chicken, shredded it then put it back in---it was perfect!  Also added two cloves of minced fresh garlic.  I used as much no salt ingredients as possible; beans, tomatoes and corn.  The salt in the green salsa was plenty for the whole recipe. Also used diced tomatoes and not the rotel type to keep the spice down.  Doubled the cumin to ½ tsp as many reviewers suggested, a must and used a mild Green Salsa Verde from Trader Joe's that is actually mild.  This chili was not the least bit spicy which is how we like it.

This is yummy! I've made this recipe several times and my husband calls it tortilla soup vs chicken chili because  we like to squeeze half of a lime in it and also garnish it with cilantro,  avacado, tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream!

We did not care for this recipe. The recipe, which I made as presented, was bland and soupy. We ate it over rice, with cheese, sour cream and avocado.

Tasty, but I omitted the corn and added some jalapeños and added avocado after it was cooked for some more flavor. I would skip the salsa Verde next time,  it makes it soupy with the tomatoes too. The flavor seemed only a little bland without some added spice and texture.

we've used it a bunch of times with some minimal changes.  we used real tomatoes and green chilies  (using the cans of it really made it way too salty for our taste), tripled the cumin and added garlic and lots of cilantro.  we also prepared our own white beans.  but absolutely delicious!!!!

This was my first time using a slow cooker and I must say that this recipe made it a great experience. I followed the recipe but had to add some cornstarch to thicken it up...it was way too soupy for my taste,otherwise great and tasty recipe.

My husband made this recipe based on the simplicity, ingredients and the star rating.  He used skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead only because we had them on hand (I know that adds some calories and fat).  This recipe was fantastic!!  It's definitely a keeper!

Following the directions exactly, it turned into soup. I removed about 1.5 cups of liquid (you can probably just leave out the broth) and then it was pretty good. The spice level is spot on and the flavoring is pretty good.

Gave only 3 stars because it was SO spicy.  Even our friends who like spicy food thought it was just a tad hotter than necessary.  However, made with a 1/2 jar of Salsa Verde, or less would probably be great.
Then it would definitely warrant 4 stars.

I would give this 6 stars if I could. One of the best recipes I have ever tried on here. I used 1 can regular diced tomatoes (as the original contributor said in a comment) and substituted 4 tablespoons of dried minced onions for the fresh onion (less cooking odor).  My wife and I killed this in one dinner plus lunch the next day.  We couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks Starr!!!

As much as I don't like rating something that I don't follow to a tee I decided to rate this based on the changes I did. Instead of 2 cans of white beans I used 1 can of white and 1 can of black beans just due to personal preference. I also used a can of cream of chicken soup rather than chicken broth just to make it a little creamer/less runny. I also used ground cilantro rather than oregano. I think this recipe was exceptionally good and was very quick to put together. I served it over white rice with fiesta cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips on top. Loved it..I would definitely make it again

I barely ever make a recipe exactly as it's written. Get over it. haha My husband likes soups and chili that are meaty so I used 3 chicken breasts instead of two. I would agree that you need at add 3 Tbsp of cornstarch at the end to thicken it up. A few tsp of lime zest really perk it up too.

The flavor is good, but the soup is very thin. If I made it again I would add more beans, corn,  and cornstarch to thicken the chili.

It was good and I'll make it again. The following are changes that I will make for my own reasons. Fire roasted corn drained because the batch I made was a little to watery for me and I think the fire roasted taste might be nice. And add another can of beans plus one chicken breast.

I actually loved this recipe. It's very flavorful and my kids ate the whole pot that evening, however, it is more like a soup/stew than a chili. I didn't bother to thicken it because it turned out great as a soup, but I wouldn't make it as a chili unless I added something to thicken it. Also, I would suggest using low sodium chicken broth if you don't make your own, and rinse the white beans. It was a tad salty.

I didn't have diced tomatoes with chilies so I added two small cans of mild green chilies. The flavors  just get better over time.

This is a good and easy recipe. I made this without a crockpot and it Was better and thicker. I used all the ingredients as stated without any additional salt but with a 3 pepper mix fresh ground. I sautéed  the onions and I added garlic until  just a little bit browned, cut the chicken into small chunks and added into the onions and garlic with double the cumin ,dried oregano and sautéed until chicken was cooked thru. Then I added the green chili and tomatoes and let simmer.  Then I added the beans and corn, salsa verde and chicken broth. Brought to a boil on medium high then turned to med low and let simmer for 4-5 hours. In the last 30 minutes I added 1/2 cup queso  quesadilla this added a nice creaminess to it, server it with sliced fresh avocado and tortilla chips.  If you have the time I recommend this as an alternative to the crock pot. I got a lot more flavor and the house smelled amazing All day!!????

I used chicken thighs. They have so much more flavor. I upped all spices to 1 teaspoon each and added 1 teaspoon minced garlic.  After tasting, it was soupy, so I added 1/4 cup cornmeal to thicken. Also it was a little bland, so I added another teaspoon of oregano and salt and 1/2 teaspoon thyme. It turned out great!

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I'm  a wimp when it comes to spice so only used half the bottle of salsa verde and my husband who likes spice thought it was just right;  I did too.  Will definitely make again however next time I will add some green pepper and/or change one of the cans of beans to black beans because it needed a little more color.

This recipe has really great flavor, and is so easy to cook! Note that chicken chili will be more "soupy" than meat chili. My picky kids loved it so I will definitely make this again.

This was a good recipe, but I heeded other reviewers advice regarding how spicy it is.  Instead of Rotel, I used plain diced tomatoes. The salsa verde provided enough flavor and kick for our family.

I make a lot of soups and chilis, but this one won't make the cut for a repeat appearance.  We all gave this a solid "meh" rating - flavor is pretty mild (too mild for our tastes), and I can't explain it, but think the appearance is unappetizing.  I added some additional spices (after tasting it), but it just wasn't obvious to me how to doctor it up further.   (I'd say normally we are a middle-of-the-road spice family:  not afraid of spice, but we don't go overboard.)  I imagine the brand of salsa verde could make a big difference in the flavor, so maybe a different brand would change the outcome.

It was good. More like soup rather than a thick chili which I was hoping for. Probably could’ve done without the chicken stock maybe...it is spicy so if you don’t like spicy stay away from this receipe

Made a ton so I could freeze some.  Chicken breasts, thighs, either would be good.  Might be a bit spicy for some but we love it.  Frozen batch was even better

I used leftover roasted chicken and added two more spices; cilantro and paprika. Also left out the salsa (personal preference). This was a hit for a cold winter night. Served in soup bowls with mexican cheese on top.

This was really good! Instead of using the slow cooker, I used the electric pressure cooker. I think the flavor that really made it was the green salsa. I’m going to use that more often in other recipes!

Was wonderful. Very simple, but great flavors. Served over rice with a dollop of sour cream. Will substitute black beans for the white to see what that does next time.

We made this with extra oregano and cumin.  Very soupy added cornstarch to thicken but next time will decrease broth.  On night two I added 1 1/2 adobo pepper that made the flavor pop.  Will make again.

Simple and delicious!! I have made it 3 times in the last month  and am always sorry when the leftovers run out.  The only change I made was due to my preference for tiny white beans.  I served it with sour cream and cheddar but it can just stand on its own without any accompaniments.  SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!

I drained the tomatoes, and used 1/2 regular, 1/2 with peppers, and also maybe 1/3 of the broth. I even strained off the salsa a little. I used probably 2 - 3 times the cumin. I also added probably 1/2 a sandwich bag full of crushed tortilla chips after I shredded the chicken and returned it to the pot. The consistency was great  for chicken chili, IMHO, and not "soupy." Nor was spicy at all. Thanks to the commenters below for these suggestions.

I followed the recipe and found that it was just a little bit too bland for me, but by the time I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top it was Fantabulous!

Made recipe pretty much as directed and it was delicious! Only changes: I cut up and added a couple of red potatoes, only because I had them and needed to use them up. It was also rather thin, and I wanted thicker chili, so I added arrowroot powder in water as a thickener. This will be a make again recipe!

Easy to put together and my husband loved it.    I used a mild rather than spicy salsa verde and doubled the cumin.  Our store was out of avocado, so I served it with a sprinkle of 4-cheese Mexican blend, a big dollop of sour cream and fresh cilantro.  I think I'll try adding a little lime juice to finish next time.  I will definitely make this again.

I’ve made this a couple times and love it. I wanted to make it yesterday morning but had no cutlets, so I picked some up and made it last night in the instapot instead set to chili for 18 minutes and it came out perfectly. Also, this recipe freezes really well for those who like to meal plan.

I made this with just diced tomatoes since I don't like much spice.  I did mix 1\4 cup masa flour into 1\2 cup water and mixed it in at the end. Delicious with cheese and sour cream.

Family loved it!!  I did leave out the diced tomatoes w/chili because my family doesn’t like tomatoes.  I also only used 3/4 of the can of chicken broth so that it was a little thicker.

Like another poster, are used one can of garbanzo beans and one of white beans. I mashed up a ripe avocado with olive oil salt and pepper then added some of it to my bowl of chili, it was delicious!

This has been a huge hit every time I have made it. It is so versatile that you can spice it up any way you want by simply adding to it. I usually will put a 16oz jar of  white cheddar  queso or Monterey Jack queso (the dips) in the last 30 min of cooking or add a variety of bean (black, garbonza).

Oh My Delicious! I did read the reviews while creating this delish meal. I used two cans of white beans (instead of one), added crushed red paper flakes and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and half cup of milk to thicken. Served with shredded cheese and sour cream. Enjoy!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was excellent. It was a nice change from the tomato-based meat chilis I've made before. I will keep this in rotation.

it was delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe but added extra cumin,  garlic powder, and chili powder as we like our foods spicy.  it had more of a soup like consistency than that of chili so I added some corn starch before serving.

We loved this dish! I used pinto beans instead of white and two large chicken breasts instead of three. This made plenty of food! I tipped the lid on the crock pot for a half hour to thicken it up a bit. We served with Fritos, cheese and sour cream. Delicious! I will be making this often!

I accidentally bought a can of small red beans so that plus one can of white beans went in. Other than that i made no changes. This was awesome and made more than i expected.  I served it with sour cream and shredded cheese. We loved it.

It was really good and easy to make. I had like 7 million pounds of chicken to make and this was one of the ways I made 2 of the chicken breasts. Did it as is and turned out awesome. Served with rice and cheese and all the deliciousness.

Yum and simple! I made it exactly as written and served with nothing and we loved it. I used no salt corn and beans. I’ve made it many times and it is easy to change up. Want it less soupy? Reduce the broth. More spicy? Add cayenne or hot peppers. Less spicy? Skip the chili’s and use regular diced tomatoes. Serve with tortilla chips, grated cheese, sour cream avocado.

5 stars with my additions. first I used my favorite salsa (about 2 cups) I also added a can of cheddar cheese soup. I doubled the Cumin and  finished it up by making a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up at the end. IT WAS AMAZING !! I also cut my chicken into chunks, but that's my personal preference.

I was a bit confused about the actual number of chicken breast halves but decided to use just 3 chicken breast halves. I did lessen the chicken broth by 1 cup after reading other reviews. Reading reviews I also listened to the person that submitted the original and DID NOT use the rotel diced tomatoes with green chili but used just dice tomatoes (fire roasted). Turned out great! Served with cornbread, avocado, cheddar cheese and rice for those that wanted to thicken it a bit. Great easy recipe.

Fabulous! I used about 7 oz of the salsa verdi and 8 oz of chicken broth. I used diced tomatoes and a can of green chilies. I rinsed every thing to avoid a salty taste. (Including the tomatoes and chilies and corn. It is exactly the right consistency and sooo good with sour cream!

I read through all the reviews prior to making the first time.  Given some comments regarding the soup like consistency, I eliminated the chicken broth completely and utilized all other ingredients exactly.  The result was a delicious chunky chili which my husband and son loved.  I served it over rice.  A big hit with my family!

I didn’t use the entire jar of salsa verde as I’m not big on spicy. Added a bit of wondera flour mix to thicken. Turned out great. We all really enjoyed it. Our add ins were cheese, chili Fritos and sour cream. Yum!

Whole family loves this one. I make frequently in rotation and have made for many events as well. Always a fav.  I caramelize the onions for added yum if I have time.  Little extra bouillon for flavor also. Frozen chicken breasts put in whole and solid only takes a 4-5 hours. Once they over cook they are tough.

As is, this was too watery and needed something (3 stars as recipe is written). It's a good start.  I like it better with 1/4 broth, more pepper and some chili powder.

Love this! I make it about 1x/week in the winter! I substitute shredded rotisserie chicken & just make it on the stovetop, starting by caramelizing a diced onion. I add an extra can of diced green chilis too.

I was really low on chicken broth so I reluctantly used beef broth instead with the small amount of chicken broth that I had and lo and behold it was fabulous! I also happen to have on hand a home a jar of green chili salsa so I added the entire jar into the recipe. Very very good and I ate leftovers for days.

Easy to make and delicious but I will admit I added garlic, cayenne, chili powder, tripled the cumin, and left out the broth.  It was a family hit!

I made a few modifications and everyone, including two picky kids,  really enjoyed it.  I used plain diced tomatoes, only 4oz of broth, a little less cumin, corn with poblano and red peppers, and added minced garlic.  It cooked in the Crock-Pot for 8 hours and the chicken was perfect. Will add this one to my favorites.

Family loved it and would make it again. Substituted a can of diced tomatoes with green pepper and added a small can of diced green chilies. Also added another can of white beans. Needed to thicken it with a bit of cornstarch

This recipe is excellent and very easy. I turned my crockpot on high for the first two hours, because I needed it done in four hours. I also used a can of green enchilada sauce and some spicy salsa. Very good, I will definitely make it again!

This is really good! My first time making chicken chili, so I used this recipe for the great reviews.  I never thought of using salsa verde in this way!  For the two cans of beans, I chose a can of northern beans and a can of white butter beans. I enjoy more tomatoes in my chili, so I got a  14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and then a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with chiles. Other than that, everything was by the written recipe. This is delicious with sour cream!!

Very tasty. Definitely will make it again. I made some minor tweaks. Used fire roasted tomatoes and added garlic powder.  I understand what people were commenting about the broth. It was a little brothier than "regular" chili, but not by much. If you like your chili thick, reduce or omit the broth.

I made it with regular salsa, chili beans, black beans, and more spices. I added taco seasoning, chili seasoning, tabasco, and garlic.  We like spicy. We served it with buttermilk biscuits, honey butter, and apricot jam to be the sweet along with the spicy. Thank you Starr for sharing!

Tastes great! I've made it twice and have used chicken breasts for one recipe and pork sirloin for the other. Both are very good. I added Rotel's Diced Tomatoes with habinaros and also some cilantro to give it a bit more flavor and kick. It's so easy to made real quick in the morning and ready for me when I get home from work.

I cooked the chicken in the broth, spices and tomatoes in the crock pot for 4 hours. Then  I shredded the chicken and added the beans (kidney and navy), frozen corn, more spices and more diced tomatoes an hour before serving. It a nice chili, just wished I would have added some "heat" to the mix. Next time.

Not only is this recipe delicious, it is so-o-o-o easy to make.  The second time that I made it, I used Ro-tel diced tomatoes with green chilies;  equally as good.  I will continue to use this recipe, many times over.

Loved this recipe. Since my husband and I are not spicy food eaters, I used fewer Chiles. It still had a little kick but not overpowering. What surprised me was my bean hating husband loved it. I  think the secret to this recipe is the oregano.

I added two cloves of garlic and in addition to chicken broth, I put in a can of cream of chicken soup. I used the green salsa and petite diced tomatoes but I left out the green chilies. I used both great northern and black beans (because I love black beans). After it cooked all day, I added a little rice and stirred in a small tub of sour cream.  I took this to work tonight and they lapped it up!!! it was very good

This made an awesome dinner during the Seahawks wild card game. Yes, it is a bit watery but as it set after cooking it did thicken up. The changes I made were few: I doubled the cumin to .5 tea and I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. I also cooked on high for 4.5 hours instead of low and slow. I served it over white jasmine rice with shredded cheddar and sour cream. I will make this again.

It's delicious as is.  For healthier options I used low sodium broth and eliminated the corn.  For extra flavor I used Mild Italian Ground Chicken from the farmer's market.   So delicious we went back for seconds!

This was a good recipe for ease of preparation, but it was far too spicy and a little too "soupy" to enjoy. I will make again but tweak the spiciness and add less salsa.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I made it for work yesterday and it was a big hit.  I made it again today for my husband and he loved it.  I made a few changes to up the flavor.  I added one tablespoon of garlic, two teaspoons of sea salt, changed the oregano to two teaspoons and increased the cumin to one teaspoon.

I did make some changes. Added about half a tube of polska kielbasa ring sausage to make it extra meaty. 
used a can of green chiles AND a can of diced tomatoes with chiles.
no slasa. chicken taco seasoning packet. no broth, just water. and i cut the raw chicken into bite-sized chunks. added a golden pepper. 
also, i used half great northern beans and half navy beans just for some variety. 

took like ten minutes to prep. its in the slow-cooker now. we'll see how it turns out after work.

This turned out AMAZING!!! So much flavor and I love spicy food! I measured by eye how much cumin, oregano, and pepper that I wanted. I put two dashes of salt and cooked it on HIGH in the crockpot for 4 hours! Will definitely be making again and it's perfect for this time of year! Great with butter toast :)

This was SO good. It was a little thin for me so I thickened it with corn meal, I added celery  chopped very small, and red sweet.pepper also in small dices. We are a family who loves deep flavor so I added a ton more oregano   When I served it I topped the chili with shredded cheese, fresh sweet peppers and crushed cantina style tortilla chips.

I made this but was concerned with only 5 servings so I used 5 chicken breasts. 2 cans of tomatoes 2 cans of white sweet corn 22 oz of low sodium chicken broth, real snipped oregano and a little more cumin. Kept the green salsa the same and the beans as well as just one onion. Also threw in a tiny bit of fresh garlic. It filled the 6 Qt crockpot and everyone loved it. Will make again the same way.

I made this exactly as the recipe shows. It was super easy and my wife and kids loved it which they don't like spicy food. I thought it was a little bland and not spicy at all so I added a generous amount of red hot to my bowl and that made it much better.I will defiantly make again.

I have made this exactly as it says. It is a very delicious recipe that I wouldn't mind again. However, to make this a regular part of my cooking, I add my own twists. I always cook my crock pot recipes for 10 hours or so.  It just makes the spices work together a lot better.  I usually don't use this website as a verbatim cookbook. I use it as a base that I add to, and that's what I would recommend to everyone else to get the most out of sites like these.

I doubled the recipe. I added 2 cans of black beans drained along with 2 tsps garlic salt, 2 tsps chili powder, 1 extra tsp cumin and an extra can of chopped green chilis. Served with cheese, sour cream and avocado slices. So delicious!

Family loved it.  The only thing I changed was the tomatoes..just used regular diced tomatoes because of the comments about spicy.  It was perfect but chicken had to be boiled after being in crock pot for 10 hours.  So..next time I will cut up smaller and mix in.

I love it during football season with a sweet cornbread. I make mine extra spicy with fresh garden jalapeños and probably some extra cayenne. No one has complained so far!

Made this for myself and my boyfriend with a few flavorful changes. Very filling. After the changes to the recipe it was very good! Plenty to last a couple days. Changes to recipe / additions:
-1 additional can  of beans (pinto)
- Added corn - extra 1/2 can
- Used 1 can "hot" rotel & 1 can "original" rotel
- 1 packet taco seasoning 
- Extra cumin (roughly 2 1/2 tablespoons)
- 3 teaspoons of chicken bouillon & 3 cups water - - instead of chicken broth.
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic
- 2 strips bacon (already cooked)
- 2 extra chicken breasts (five total).Served with: 
- Diced jalapeño 
- Tortilla Chips
- Cheese.The bacon, garlic and taco seasoning add nice flavor to the recipe. 

Enjoy!

Very nice, has a little kick to it. Be careful to drain all the liquids from the canned vegetables. The chicken broth, green salsa, and diced tomato add enough liquid. Otherwise, you'll get more a soup than a chili.

This was very good, easy to prepare and will make again.  I followed the recipe exactly (maybe a bit more cumin was added) and the jar of salsa verde was pretty spicy so it really perked up the dish.  At first it was a bit juicier than I like but once the chicken was shredded that wasn't an issue.  My son really enjoyed this when he dropped by unexpectedly and talked me into fixing a care package w/cornbread for him.  This was my first experience with spicy chicken and white beans being called 'chili' but an old dog can learn a new trick once in a while.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and for the always helpful/interesting reviews. Viva Allrecipes!!!

It turned out watery for me. After tasting it I added about 8 oz of pepper jack and mozzarella cheese and let it melt in and it tasted a lot more substantial and really delicious. Adding a big spoonful of sour cream would probably have the same effect. I would make it again but with the cheese.

I made it with just the green chilies and tomatoes, and put less broth . And left everything else exact to the recipe. I love it and make it at least twice a month.

It was easy to make; however, it was VERY soupy with the full can of chicken broth and green salsa. More of a chicken bean soup than a chili. I drained half the liquid and it was still ok.

I made this using what I had in the cabinets and it turned out fabulous!  I didn't have salsa verde so I used jalapeño hot sauce.  I only had one can of white beans so I added a can of garbanzo beans.  I followed some reviews and added garlic and extra cumin and everyone loved it!  I love Allrecipes.com because you have options with a recipe.

Loved it.  Only modification we made was to add a can of collard greens for a little extra vitamin action. Even the picky child ate it without (much) complaint.  Due to a late start, I cooked on high for 2 hours and low for 3 hours, and it was perfect. Will make again and again-thanks for sharing!!!

I love this chili, and it's been a hit every time I've made it for a potluck.

I like to add a jar of sliced jalapeños to give it a little extra kick and sometimes I substitute Bush's White Chili Beans.  So easy and so healthy.

A huge hit.  I did use the can diced tomatoes WITH green chile peppers and it had an excellent kick to it.  My whole family loved it.  I loved how EASY it was.

Oh my gosh this was SO DELICIOUS! I made one little change, I added chopped red bell pepper because I like that flavor in chili. Served it over rice and sprinkled on cheddar cheese --- WOW. this dish is scrumptious.  I made a big batch and put it in single serve containers for the freezer. A week of yummy dinners. Thanks so much for sharing it!

This was a great recipe!  I have a friend who owns 2 restaurants and she claimed it was the best chicken chili she had ever tasted!!  Very easy to make, I am NOT a star cook, and it was easy.  I took the review advice and thickened it a bit.  I'm gluten intolerant so I used about a 1/4c of a gf flour mix and organic flax meal.  I also upped the cumin and oregano.

Made this tonight and it was sooo good! I thought it may too watery but once I shredded the chicken and put it back in the crock-pot it was perfect. I did use Rotel. I served it with sour cream, shredded cheese, and tortillas chips. Even my son that hates corn loved it. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

Excellent!  It was easier to simply use 2 cans of tomatoes/green chilis for a total of 20oz. I also doubled the oregano and cumin. I used 1 can each of garbanzo beans and black beans as another reviewer suggested instead of white beans. I think it's up to you as the flavor is in the stock. Topped with white cheese. My co workers LOVED this recipe!  Just the right amount of spice. I used Costena green salsa and an off brand tomatoes/green chilis-regular spice.

Made this yesterday. I didn't use the green verde sauce.. used everything. I use two cans of Rotel fire roasted tomatoes. I did add some good olive oil to the pot before starting the cooking process. I added paprika, a little cayenne pepper. With using the spices and Rotel. It has a nice kick to it!  Easy to make.I cooked mine for 4 hours and used forks for the chicken, put it back in for 30min. I used 1/2 can of Organic corn. Will make this again!

I love the flavor and ease to make. Doubled the recipe except used only one jar of salsa verde based on other comments. Did use diced tomatoes and green chilis. Not too spicy, would rate it a mild on the spice scale. Because of a late start I cooked it 2.5 hours on high, shredded the chicken and we ate in 30 minutes with tortilla chips, cheese, sliced avocado, sour cream, fresh cilantro, and green onion.

This was Amazing! I used grilled chicken (we had it leftover from the night before) So I think that added a smokey flavor. And I did add one can of ro-tel tomatoes. The chicken broth made it a little watery and my crock-pot was overflowing a little.  
We ate it with crunched up tortilla chips, sour cream & avocado toppings! Delicious and very filling. This is a keeper!

I listened to other reviewers about it being too soupy but I didn't want to cut out the chicken broth (for some reason) so I drained the tomatoes(used regular like the original poster said in a review) and added a can of black beans in hopes it would thicken it up enough.  It still came out more of a chicken tortilla soup but on a chili rainy day it's perfect! I omitted onions, added onion powder and as far as the seasoning I used what was suggested but I didn't measure I did all to taste. (These recipes always seem to be under-seasoned) Even though it came out soup it was still delicious and we will be making it again!

Original recipe was ok. It was not spicy  at all , the second time I made it I doubled the spices and added in a fresh chopped serrano  (seeds and all) and it was perfect! I also pre-season my chicken in Cajun seasoning , salt , pepper,  and a honey garlic rub. After the changes its a 5 star meal!

Delicious Delicious Delicious - I didn't even have all the right quantities of ingredients - only half of the salsa verde - but it was still wonderful.  Next time I'd add more beans to make the chicken stretch further.  Enjoy!!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but mine turned out way more like a soup than a chili. The taste was great (spicy!), and I paired it with some lime tortilla chips, but it was more on the liquid side than I wanted.

This is a great, easy go to recipe. I used a can of diced tomatoes and sliced up fresh jalapeño from the garden. We like it spicy and are to three jalapeño. We may even push it up to four! Next I want to try all fresh ingredients!

This was amazing! I used petite diced tomatoes. After shredding the chicken it really thickens it up. Kids love it too!

Excellent!  Found it fairly mild but that's OK when trying to please all different "heat" tolerances.  My daughter loved it as is and my husband just added Cholula.  Everyone's happy!  (I made this as the individual who originally posted said, using  tomatoes WITHOUT chilies.  Using the kind WITH chilies would definitely add some heat.)

My only mods were to use 4 chicken breasts, 2 diced cloves of garlic, and double the amount of cumin. Really glad that I didn't add any salt at all. This is great!

Delicious! I used mild green salsa and after reading about the diced tomatoes with green chilies I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1/2 can of diced green chilies.

really good, simple recipe.  I used two large, frozen chicken breasts and put them in the crock pot still frozen. I was able to get this meal together before leaving for work in the morning.  Crushed chips, sour cream and diced avocado on top, and it was delicious!!

This was good but next time I will only use 1/2 the amount of green chile salsa, it was overpowering. And I added cilantro. I followed the recipe and it was not soupy at all. It had chili consistency. I think maybe trying 1 can of white beans and 1 can of black beans would make it more colorful. Also the white beans are very soft and get mushy which is ok for chili but the black beans would add more texture and compliment the chili.

I'm always looking for make ahead dinners on a workday. This recipe was easy and delicious! After reading other reviews, I made a few minor changes. I added a can of black beans and substituted canned corn for frozen sweet corn. I also increased the spices to taste as I thought the amount listed was too small.

LOVE it! It had a little kick to it, but just the right amount. Even my weak husband said it wasn't too spicy for him. Looking forward to making it for company and potlucks.

So easy and so yummy! The only change I made was to add a can of black beans. It turned out very flavorful without being too spicy. We topped it with cheese and served it with tortilla chips.

Very good & very easy to make! I was cooking for two people, so I cut the recipe in half...adjusted my recipe for 3 servings and used common sense. I took other reviewers advice; I did use (Chi-Chi's mild) salsa verde as directed and I don't think it was overpowering at all. You could cut salsa verde in half to prevent too much heat/spice (salsa verde is basically just green chiles anyways). We also only use Dei Fratelli Seasoned Diced Tomatoes in our house and those have a small amount of mild chiles, then I doubled the garlic, and also only used half the chicken broth called for (which was a perfect amount of broth to give it the right consistency, which you will notice once the chicken is shredded after about 5 hrs of cooking and put back into the pot). I then also doubled the cumin. Keep in mind that cumin & green chiles are key flavor ingredients in white chili/chicken chili. You can play around with both to give more or take away heat/spice as preferred. I rated this 5-stars! Terrific recipe... made it much easier than my previous recipe that was extremely time consuming... soaking beans, 99 different ingredients, yada yada yada... this took very little effort with the same result in flavor... it really was amazing and we were pleasantly surprised... and we are very picky!

Very good 'chili' served over rice.  Nice balance of ingredients and textures.  Not too spicy and not too bland.  Excellent with tortilla chips and slices of avocado.  Will put this in our regular rotation. Good stuff!
