YUMMY!!! I love these! I did mine a little different, I did it on the stove with a candy thermometer and boiled until it reached 240F. I also reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup maple suryp, SOOOO GOOOOOOD. when I was mixing it after boiling it started getting stiffer after about 4ish minutes so I just poured it out in a pan and voila!

Super! As a French Canadian from Quebec I've been looking for this recipe. Tasted just like I remembered it.  I think I've made 8 batches over the summer. Thank you for a little taste from home!

My whole family grew up with this (although we call it Sucre Creme), since my dad's family is French Canadian.  My grandmother always made this on the stove.  Trust me when I say that you will either love it or hate it.  Sometimes she would throw in a few chopped walnuts, but usually we enjoyed it plain.  Also, sometimes it wouldn't work, or sometimes on purpose, she would have it runny (about the consistency of honey) to put onto toast.  Man, this stuff brings back memories & it is so delicious!

This is super easy to make but I am still trying to figure out the perfect time with my 1500 watt microwave. First time, I cooked too much - second time, not enough but the taste is still fantastic. Just working on the consistency of the fudge!

When Cecille D. says "sugar fix," she *really* means it! This stuff is easy and delicious, but VERY sweet. Try shaping it into small balls and rolling them in chopped pecans--YUM! I didn't mix my first batch long enough, so mine came out just a little grainy in texture--I'll watch that next time.

I just completed the recipe and it's awsome. I only cooked the sugar mixture in my 1200 watts microwave for 9 min. I followed the recipe and my sucre a la creme is hard but not too hard. Make sure to use a big microwave container, mine did overflow a little.

I have been looking for this recipe for over ten years.  A friend's mother made it when I was younger and wouldn't give up the recipe, wonderful, uber sweet and oh so dangerously addictive.

I'm not sure what I did wrong.  The taste is good but it was practically impossible to cut into even pieces (it just kept breaking).   Kinda tastes like maple sugar candy, but not sure that is what it is supposed to be.

Not sure what I did wrong since the recipe is extremely simple, but my fudge turned out quite runny - just the opposite of another review.  But really, who can go wrong with something this sweet?  Suggest possibly adding maple syrup to the mix to give it that unique flavour and also in keeping with the Quebecois theme.

This was my first time making this, I doubled the recipe and put it in the microwave for about 20 minutes, stirring thoroughly every five minutes. I let it cool for about 5 more minutes and then used the hand mixer for about 8 minutes. It was immediately starting to set, but when I tasted the mixture, it was still a little grainy. It set within fifteen minutes and I suggest to stir it a little longer. It kind of reminds me of caramel fudge.

My dad is 78 and he learned this from his mom(Chibougamou, Quebec). LOVE sucre creme!!! We use 2 cups white sugar, 2 cups dark brown sugar and one can of Carnation evaporated milk. Since I'm not a baker I love the ease of buying exactly what I need... One pound box if each sugars and a can... Gotta love it. We never used a microwave since they didn't exist when grandma made it and they didn't have a candy thermometer. This is how we do it.... All in one large saucepan, set heat to med-high. Stir constantly! You eventually want a constant rapid boil. When it has boiled for several minutes( how long depends on humidity and elevation) drop a few drops into a fresh cool glass of water. If drops falls apart at all it is not ready. Keep refreshing glass of water and retest every 30 seconds ( have someone help because you must stir constantly!)... You don't want to see anything flake off or fall apart. Then constantly run cool water in sink as the pan sits in the sink and again stir constantly(do NOT get any water in the pan... This is an important cooling phrase). Once it starts to get tough to stir and sugar granules start to almost crystallize, it is ready to pour and spread onto a buttered dinner plate. We add chopped pecans for fun in final stage sometimes. Place in fridge and cut into squares about five minutes later. Put back in fridge for 30 minutes.  Ours is never  a true fudge consistency, but a bit grainy from crystallized sugar. We consider this candy not fudge.

This stuff is delicious, and tastes almost exactly the way my grandmother's did. A couple notes though, the same rules that apply to making fudge apply to this. It won't work if it's too humid out, remember that it takes patience and lots of time stirring, and it's going to take the enamel off your teeth it's so sweet. Maple syrup works really well in this, take out some of the white sugar and remember that you're adding a liquid so it's going to take a little longer to cook and solidify.

Yummy!  I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted 3/4 cup 1/2% milk and 1/3 cup real butter.  I also didn't wait the 5 minutes cooling time because I missed that in the directions and it still turned out wonderful!

I don't think I get to use the word "Explode" enough when I'm cooking.  I don't know what it was, maybe my microwave or the kind of cream - but it took only 2 minutes to happen.  The stuff I licked off my fingers after cleaning the microwave tasted very good.

You need to add an egg sized nugget of unsalted butter to the mix. Yummy this recipe is a tradition in many french canadian families during the holidays.

Interestingly, the 'sucre a la creme' that my grandmother made when i was a little boy was more of a sauce than a fudge...she'd put it in a little bowl and we'd dip fresh-out-of-the-oven bread in it.  So utterly decadent...

I grew up in a predominantly French-Canadian city and love Sucre-a-Creme, but have never been able to make it competently.  I love this recipe, it was easy, hands off and took the guess work out of candy making!  Thank you for this fabulous recipe.  This makes the Christmas baking roster!

Don't stick a hot glass bowl in cold water.  Chances are pretty good that the bowl will shatter.  That might work with a metal bowl, but a metal bowl wouldn't work for the microwave.  Don't even try plastic.

2011.09.26 - I used Angele's stovetop-maple version, and it was delicious, though not easy to pick up.
2016.09.26 - Five years later, second try!  Per Angele, used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup (with the original 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup heavy cream), boiled until it reached 240F while stirring a couple times, then removed it from the heat and whisked it for a couple minutes until it seemed stiffer (maybe 2 minutes?) before pouring it into my 2nd largest red top Pyrex.  It's in the fridge now, so here's hoping it sets up nicely!  Leftover dribbles in the pot taste like maple caramels.

This recipient tastes delicious and is very easy to make but I suggest using a stove top to cook rather than the microwave. I made a batch in the microwave and left the batch in for two minute and it overflowed making a large mess  and half the batch gone. Hope this advice helps.

Seems to work for the most part until step 2 comes around. How are you blending for 4 minutes? Mine turns into a crumble after mixing for 1.

I haven't tried this in microwave, always on stove-top. Growing up in Ontario we called this 'Maple Cream'- even tho it more often had vanilla than maple flavoring, and sometimes walnuts. We used to beg Mom to make it, and it's still my favorite home-made candy.

I grew up in quebec all my life and I make this every couple of weeks ( I have a really bad sweet tooth) as for this recipe I don't like the consistency of the white sugar or heavy cream. 
IT IS NOT FUDGE.

Followed the instructions exactly and two minutes into beating the mixture it turned crumbly abruptly.  Less cooling time before beating?  Less beating?  Less microwave?  I'm not sure whe I went wrong but I'm left with a crumbly mess ??

I'm a Quebecoise and have always LOVED sucre a la creme. I moved to Ontario 10 yrs ago and haven't been able to find it here. They have fudge but no sucre a la creme.
This recipe is EXACTLY how I remember it. I followed the recipe and it was perfect. Just perfect.
Thank you for sharing.

An absolutely perfect sucre a la creme!  Cooked 8 minutes in my microwave.  Used 35% cooking cream NOT whipping cream.
