It was delicious! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and everyone loved it! Finished the cake about 4 hours before serving and turned out wonderful. I replaced angel food cake with white cake. The frosting is very light and not too sweet (just the way I like it). The only problem was the cocoa mixed with strawberries made the cake look an ugly brown - not very pretty. I made it the second time, without the cocoa. Instead of scooping out the middle, I made 2 8-inch cakes and layered them on top of the other with frosting & strawberries in the middle. And instead of MIXING the frosting with strawberries, I just frosted the cake and placed the strawberries on top of it and around it. Some rasberries and mint leaves in the middle to garnish. The second time was the charm!

Due to the fact that I was having Easter dinner for fourteen people, I did a lot of cheating with this recipe. To make my life a bit easier, I bought an angel food cake from the grocery store and used chocolate flavored cool whip. I also mascerated my strawberries and filled the center hole with them for an even prettier presentation. Light, refreshing and a perfect dessert after a big dinner. Thank you so much Carole!

This was delicious. Here's a variation..something a bit different; Alternate pieces of angel food cake and sliced strawberries on skewers and serve with dip such as whipped creme and/or chocolate. People jump on these at my parties!

I took out the cocoa, and added a little vanilla to my whipping cream instead. I also just put my strawberries, which I sliced, on top instead of folding them in to the whipping cream. I also added some blueberries for color on the outside of the cake. Looked and tasted great.

Love it!  This was a hit both at work and at home.  Next time though I'm going to experiment a little.  I'd like it just a bit sweeter and would like to taste more chocolate.

I enjoyed the strawberries in the middle and on top of the cake, but the frosting was not good.  There wasn't enough flavor to it.

I just made this for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved it.  She wants me to bake another one for her and her friends.  The fact that it is not too sweet was a hit!

I made this cake with some modifications and it was a huge delicious hit!  First:  I just used a white cake mix baked in a bundt pan (for about 36 minutes).  I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream with both strawberries and blackberries macerated in some splenda (what I had on hand) for the filling (with cocoa/confectioners' sugar as called for).  To frost, I used 8 oz of cool whip mixed with a tablespoon of vanilla and topped with my remaining macerated fruit.  DELISH!

I did not like this cake at all.  It was not sweet enough and the coco gave this recipe a bad after taste.  I will not make this one again.

I thought long and hard about the special dessert I should make for a multiple family birthday celebration.  Taking into account individual tastes ranging from a two-year-old and spanning three generations, this cake could not have been more perfect. As I watched my granddaughter dip her finger into the yummy whipped cream frosting and ultimately shove the angel food cake into her mouth at the same time I doled out a second helping to her granddad, I knew I had made the right choice.  I wouldn't change anything about this cake, except I think I might use blueberries in the filling just as a surprise.

This was really good and super simple with a store-bought cake.  I think a homemade one would have presented better but I didn't have the time.  I concur that the light chocolate flavor is decadent!

I put in 4 tablespoons cocoa and sugar, and when I made the "tunnel" I took the cake pieces, crumbled them, and put them in the filling.  Delicious!

This was a big hit for my granddaughter’s birthday.  It would have been more delicious with made-from-scratch angel cake.  I used a mix.  Instead of cocoa powder, I added some strawberry gelatin powder to the whipped cream.  It made the icing a pretty pale pink.  The cake was light and perfect for summer.

I made this for a friend's birthday and it was a hit! The changes I made were to use vanilla instead of cocoa powder and I used 2 loaf pans because I didn't have an angel food cake pan.
