These were the BEST fried green tomatoes I've ever had in my entire life.  I followed the directions EXACTLY and they couldn't have been any better.  The batter stuck perfectly, and held up really well.  This was my first time making these myself, and I had NO problem whatsoever - in fact, I had NEVER even friend anything before and I STILL had no problems.  For all you "first time fryers" my sister gave me this tip:  to tell when the oil is hot enough, dip a wooden spoon into the oil and look to see if bubbles form around it.  If bubbles form, your oil is ready to fry in.

Loved these tomatoes! Used only egg whites to ensure they came out super crispy and crunchy. Egg yolks can make fried foods a little greasy and sometimes soggy.

The directions to cut the tomatoes so thick is definitely wrong in my opinion. I find they will not get done or tender when cut so thick! 

I've been cooking for 54 plus years, but am still willing to learn. I now cut mine very thin (about 1/8th inch), salt and pepper them and simply flour them in SELF-RISING FLOUR and fry them in very hot Peanut oil -- A few at the time and very quickly. They are great and CRISPY!!! Drain them on several UNCOATED (cheap) paper plates.

Having lived in North Carolina for the last 16 years, I've had these tomatoes in various southern restaurants. This recipe was great in flavor, but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  After the first batch, I made some changes and found them to be exactly what I was looking for.  The flour made the breading too soft. I reduced the flour by 1/2 cup, which made equal parts flour, cornmeal, and breadcrumbs.  This gave the tomatoes the crispness that they needed.  Again, the flavor was great!  I received many compliments and will continue to use this recipe.  Thanks!!

These were delicious - I had a recipe that didn't call for breadcrumbs and there were quite a bit of seasonings but I can't find it.  Until I do I will surely be using this one.  Here's a no fuss no muss tip that I use whenever I am breading things - I just simply pull out a long sheet of wax paper and put it on the counter next to the stove - line up the flour, next the cornmeal and breadcrumbs (you can mix it with your hands on the paper), put the breaded tomatoes on the end.  Roll up the wax paper when you are finished - the only plate you have is the egg mixture!!!!  I love wax paper to cut down the mess. Thanks for sharing the recipe Diana.

I was having a tough time with the ingredients sticking to the tomato.  I tried again using only egg, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper and when cooked the tomatoes was fully coated and delicious

Made this for my husbands birthday in April.  He is from the South we live on the West Coast and he thought they were great.  I served them with a dip made out of dijon mustard, a bit of mayonaise, some horseraddish and a dash of red wine vinnegar.  The were even good cold as leftovers the next day.

We loved them!  I used egg & fat-free buttermilk to dip and added cayenne to my corn meal mixture.  When I turned them over to cook on the second side, I added fresh Parmesan cheese to the cooked side.

Fried Green Tomatoes have long been a family favorite. But these are incredible. We have never tasted anything soooo goooood!! We made the sauce the one lady recommended and I just can't say enough about them. This recipe will be handed down for years to come.

I sliced the tomatoes 1/4 inch thick.  I decreased the flour to 1/2 cup and mixed it with the cornmeal and bread crumbs (I used Panko).  I also added to the flour:  1/8 teaspoon cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon onion powder.  I dipped the tomato in the flour mixture, then the egg mixture, and then the flour mixture again.  There was only enough flour mixture for ONE tomato (6 slices) and way too much egg mixture left over.  Next time I will double the flour mixture and half the egg mixture. A bit on the salty side...and I am a salt LOVER.  Next time I will decrease the salt to one teaspoon.  Otherwise, very crispy and tasty!  I dipped mine in blue cheese dressing...YUM!

Oven fry by using a spraying veg. oil and baking at 400 for 45 mins, flipping them half way through. This recipe is really good and authentic just as written. (I live in Alabama!) This is the recipe I follow except I let my tomato slices marinade in buttermilk for a couple mins and omit the eggs entirely.
Tip: Replacing the bread crumbs with panko bread crumbs or using all panko to batter in makes for incredible fried green tomatoes.

This is an excellent recipe that I've used several times.  This recipe (and many others) recommends slicing the tomatoes and discarding the ends.  This is because the breading does not stick to the shiny smooth tomato skin on the ends.  Green tomatoes are not always easy to come by, and I hate wasting food.  I roughen the ends with a cheese grater and the breading sticks just fine.  In fact, my wife says the end pieces have more flavor, like the end cut on a roast.

Almost identical to the ones at the "Irondale Cafe" formerly the whistle stop from the movie "Fried Green Tomatoes" I live not far from there. A trick they tole me was to drain them in a colander standing up instead of laying down, and they will stay crisper longer.

Another way is to place the sliced tomotos into buttermilk first then flour then egg wash then the breading,  buttermilk adds moisture for the flour to stick to.  Also put S&P into flour not breading.

Wow!  These are great!  I never had fried green tomatoes before, but after watching the movie (again :) I had to give them a shot.  Very delicious!  I changed it up a little by frying in bacon grease instead of oil - enough to cover the bottom of the skillet and come up 1/4" or so was plenty.  The best part of this recipe is the coating technique:  wet (tomatoes) into dry (flour) into wet (egg/milk mixture) into dry (cornmeal mixture)  Worked like a charm!  I was totally impressed with how well the coating adhered to the mater slices.  YUM!  Thanks, Diana!!

I love these cooked very crispy; tomatoes can be either true green or slighty-ripe red. Cornmeal is the key. In these broadened days, substitue Panko (Japanese style chunkier blend) crumbs for traditional bread crumbs, and use cornmeal not only with the first dredge but the last one as well. Follow the path: seasoned flour (add the cornmeal), egg/milk mixture, seasoned panko crumbs (add cornmeal again). I really hate the smell of hot oil/frying, so I don't "bathe" foods in inches of oil...at most, use about a 1/4 to 1/2 inch, make it HOT, and get it out of your kitchen asap once you're done with the tomatoes. (I'm not from the South where frying is more common; I often use an electric skillet in my garage so the oil smell doesn't settle in the house. But Lord knows I love fried foods!) Great side dish - and one contributor added a dipping sauce I think is great: mayo, dijon, horseradish and a bit of red wine vinegar....good stuff.

Wow!  I made this recipe with red tomatoes because a few under ripe red one were all I had on hand.  I substituted Panko bread crumbs but the rest of the recipe did as directed.  It was absolutely delicious.  I have posted photos.  Thank you for this recipe, it was easy to make, the coating adhered well.   I will be making them often!

These are great!   I live in Mississippi where fried green tomatoes are on many menus, and we love them.   The 1/2 inch is too thick for us so I sliced them about 1/4 inch...perfect!

WOW! I never anticipated that these would taste so good! My mother-in-law, who has tasted just about every fried green tomato the south has to offer said these were by far the best she's ever tasted!  I took advise from a few reviews, and adjusted it as so- I used italian bread crumbs instead of regular, I just used egg whites, and sprinkled the tomatoes with romano cheese and cayenne pepper while frying them. Absolute perfection! Thank-you for this recipe!

I have made green tomatoes a few times in the past and always come away with a soggy, greasy mess, so this recipe was a great change.  The tomatoes were crisp and light and really easy to make, although our fingers did get really gummy and there was a bit of a mess on the table.  I baked them rather than frying just to try and they were perfect, crunchy on the outside, tender on the end side and not at all greasy!  I am giving this four stars, though, because we did think the batter was pretty bland.  I added garlic powder, onion salt, and italian herbs to the cornmeal bread crumb mixture, and in the last batch we made, I als put a few shakes of hot sauce into the egg mix, but it still needed something else.  I will have to play around with the seasonings, but other than that, this was a great recipe.

I have to say I have never had fried green tomatoes as good as these...the picture is just what they look like and they taste as good as they look. The only changes I made was I cut the tomatoes about an hour before cooking and sprinkled salt on one side of them (to extract the moisture out of them which makes the breading stick better) and after I cooked them I sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan cheese. I also made sure the oil was very hot-cooked on medium high heat. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they were awesome. Will definetley make these the same way again and again!! If you haven't tried these your missing out. Thank you so much for sharing such a great recipe!!!

This is my new go to recipe for friend green tomatoes! I have tried quite a few recipes with mediocre results. The crumbs held on so well and the tomatoes were perfectly cooked. I did make a mock buttermilk out of convenience and it worked fine. I also followed others suggestions and cut the tomatoes smaller, or about a 1/4", and I used half the amount of flour and it ended up being the perfect amount with no waste. I didn't use the full amount of oil. I heated about 1/4 inch of oil in a non-stick pan on medium and it worked great. Thank you, and I look forward to making this again next year before some of my tomatoes turn red.

This recipe is much like the one my mother always used, except she used firm red, rather than green tomatoes.  When the tomatoes were done, she put them on a warming tray and added a cup of milk to the remains in the frying pan, flour to thicken and salt and pepper to taste.  This makes a wonderful gravy for the tomatoes.  The gravy ingredients can be adjusted depending on the number of tomatoes.

My first time making this recipe, I followed it to the letter and the tomatoes were quite good.  The second time, I made the following additions/changes and the results were excellent:  I used panko bread crumbs; seasoned all breading components (flour, egg mixture and coating) with salt, pepper and a pinch of seasoning blend (I used my own, similar to Emeril's "BAM"); and I shallow-fried in 1 1/2 cups of vegetable oil instead of deep frying.  I served the crispy tomatoes with a spicy buttermilk ranch dipping sauce.

Sounds delicious but I make mine different. I mix flour, cornmeal, eggs,milk, salt & pepper together & make a batter. I slice the tomatoes the same thickness & salt them 1st & let set 20 min. It takes some of the bitterness out of them & draws out the liquid. Pour off any liquid & dip in batter & fry in hot oil or bacon grease. They are very good!

Excellent. Used on green tomatoes, yellow squash, cucumbers, and mushrooms with great success. Keep the basic process/ingredients but feel free to change up the seasonings - use Cajun, or Old Bay, or Italian, or whatever you like. Nice crunchy breading but not too heavy.

This was s great recipe! I omitted the cornmeal and salt and used Italian breadcrumbs. I also added a package of Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch dressing mix to the breadcrumbs for a little more flavor and it did not disappoint. it was very tasty..will be making this again :)

My husband had never heard of them, but he ate three or four fried slices before I had to pull them away from him.  The greeness is important, the tomatoes must be almost pinking up with the inside juicy already.  Too unripe, and they are bitter and give you a tummyache!

These are good!!I made them just as the recipe calls for the first time, I made them again with the advice of a local restaurant and used finely crushed saltine cracker crumbs instead of corn meal and bread crumbs.  I added a dash of garlic powder to taste and the 2nd time around, they were awesome :)  Good way to use up those tomatoes from the garden.  I made a cajun mayo based dipping sauce to go with them.

Well this was my first time making Fried Green Tomatoes and I have to say I was impressed!  Well written instructions. I followed the recipe exactly using Italian bread crumbs (what I had on hand) a cast iron skillet  for frying.    I ate these with a bowl of chilli and enjoyed a nice cold beer!  Will definitely makes these again!  Ohhh.....and if you haven't seen the movie you should watch it.....FANTASTIC!!!!

This was great.  I added granulated garlic & onion to the flour along with a pinch of cayenne.  I only used egg whites and used heavy cream instead of milk to help the corm meal stick.  I used 3/4 cup of corn meal and 1/4 cup of panko.  The suggested sauce by another review was great.  1 cup mayo, 1 T dijon, 2t red wine vinegar, 2 T horseradish (I added cilantro & red onion too).  After the tomato is cooled slightly I top it with lump crab meat, drizzle the sauce over it sprinkled with diced sweet red pepper.  YUM!  I will be serving these at my restaurant as next week appetizer special. Thanks Diana!

Made this just the other night as I pulled all the remaining tomatoes from the vine. I made it as the recipe called for except I fried them in olive oil and cut back on the flour to 1/2 cup and it was plenty.  They were crispy on the outside and just done on the inside. Great recipe....I think I ate too many and so did my husband. Thanks!

Salt the slices and rack them to drip on paper towel (or lay on paper towel) to remove some of the moisture and bitterness. Allow a pelicle to form before coating with the egg. Then dredge and recoat with breading mixture. These can be preped and frozen on cookie sheets, bagged up and fried from the freezer which gives the best sealed breading of all!

This makes the perfect breading! It stays together and browns beautifully with a delicious crunchy texture. I used panko for the breadcrumbs, and we sliced green tomatoes and eggplant. Both fried perfectly in canola oil. This is now our breading for fried treats.

Yum!  This was great!  I've never had these before, but have always wanted to try Fried Green Tomatoes (after seeing the movie, naturally).
The only thing that I did differently from the recipe was to use seasoned breadcrumbs, and substitute buttermilk for the milk (because that sounded good to me!).

This recipe was great!  I added a little more salt after frying because the flavor was lacking a little but all in all- a great recipe!  Oh, and I used fresh, firm red tomatoes from the farmer's market and it still turned out yummy!

These were delicious! I added S&P to the tomatoes first then added more to the flour. I've had issues with bland tomatoes in the past but these didn't have that problem.

Excellent recipe! Next time I will double the pepper (used coarse pepper) and slice the tomatoes 1/4 inch instead of 1/2 inch. I used bags for the flour and cornmeal mixture. I found floating the slices in the egg mixture and then gently turning them over works better than trying to dunk them. If you like yours more crispy try first sprinkling them with salt and wrapping them up in a paper towel for 15 minutes... it leaches off a lot of moisture.

Mmmmmmm yummy!  Made these again today; skipped the corn meal and used panko bread crumbs so I still got the crunch I was looking for!.. Awesome!.. If you are skeptical and think these sound weird but like other fried veggies like zucchini or tempura you will most likely love these!.. :)  I find the green tomatoes that are fully grown but still green are the juciest and best flavor!

These are the best fried tomatoes I've ever had!  Wow!  I had no trouble with the batter like some reviewers.  I did add red pepper flakes for some heat and took Milon's suggestion for the dijon sauce.  These were just terrific!  They were even good cold the next day.  I can't stop thinking about them!

Loved this recipe.  I have never tried this or made it before and had some huge tomatoes in the garden theat would not turn red so I tried this out. I made the pre-mentioned dip to go with it to. Perfect.

I cut the tomatoes thinner (about 1/4 inch), as the 1/2 inch thick maters were too thick for me. Instead of bread crumbs, I mix self-rising flour with the corn meal and add plenty of seasoning salt, pepper, and a bit of cayenne. I fry them up in about 1/4 inch of oil. Salt after the last flip, while the oil is still glistening. These are great when well salted and/or with some chipotle ranch. Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

Just like you would get in a restaurant. I didn't add quite as many breadcrumbs as stated in the recipe and did add a little garlic powder and cayenne for extra zip. We will make these again and again.

OMG, these are fantastic!! I made these using some unripe Roma's in my garden and we used crushed saltine's instead of cornmeal.  They were really, truly OUT OF THIS WORLD!  We made a little relish I guess you could call it of diced ripe tomatoes and orange bellpepper with finely diced jalapeno and a splash of cider vinegar with salt.  It was an addictive combination.

Crispy and delicious!  I followed this recipe as written, but only used enough oil to pan fry--no where near a quart.  They turned out better than I remember my mom making.  I don't think it matters how green the tomatoes are.  Mine were as green as green could be and they turned out great.  Thanks!

Really yummy! realized I had no eggs (yikes!) at the last minute so substituted just whites, and it was still yummy. Added a little bacon grease to the second batch, but couldn't tell a difference. Served with several sauces/sides for dipping that people could mix and match.
1. Fresh lemon wedges
2. Tabasco
3. Old bay for dipping
4. Sauce of mayo, pickle relish, dijon mustard, lemon, tabasco and garlic powder
YUM!

These were awesome!  My boyfriend, who crinkled up his nose and said "I hate fried green tomatoes" as I was preparing them, practically inhaled them when I served them with chicken and mashed potatoes!  I took the advice of a few of the others who rated this recipe, and added more seasoning to the breadcrumb mix.

I had never had fgt before.  I picked tomatoes from my garden for this recipe.  I used parmesain bread crumbs.  I wasn't expecting them to be that good, but when I tasted them, they were delicous!  I also fried up some pumpkin blossoms this way but the tomatoes were better.  I will make this again!

Those aren't green tomatoes in the video, the recipe appears to be for tomatillas which are more close to gooseberries than tomatoes. As someone pointed out they are cut too thick for actual green tomatoes. The recipe is very basic. Not even buttermilk instead of milk, no real spices, no justification for kosher salt. -Wow!

This is a good general base recipe, but if you're like me, you'll want to experiment with it and make it a little less bland. Also, you can cut the flour in half and still have plenty, and add a little more cornmeal. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk. After all, what's a southern recipe without buttermilk? I used some Creole seasoning as well. I also fry mine in bacon grease, instead of just oil. Everybody has a different taste, and this recipe will be good if it is left well alone, but GREAT if changed up just a bit. Fried green tomatoes are pretty forgiving, so don't be afraid to experiment!!!!!

Made this just as written, but halved the ingredients for just the two of us. Delicious, but we wanted a sauce to dip them in. Ranch dressing did the trick for us.

Delicious!  I was a bit skeptical because I've never had them before, but they turned out awesome.  They were crispy with a nice crunch from the corn meal and perfectly sweet.  If I knew how good they were I would have made them all summer with our tons of tomatoes!

These were awesome, with a few changes:  I used egg whites rather than whole eggs, since I read that the yolk can give that eggy taste and make them soggy, and I used cream instead of milk (I had no milk); I also used Cabella's Mt. Man Bourbon Rub seasoning with the salt and pepper, adding a little extra cajun seasoning too into the flower; I used panko breadcrumbs, and it gave it a nice extra crunch.  We did both green and red tomatoes, and everyone raved!

Great! We did follow a tip from Paula Dean... cut the tomatoes and put them in a strainer with salt on them, let them sit for a half hour. We did do some this way and some just cut and breaded. The salted toms were the bomb! Loved them with some ranch dressing!

This was my first attempt and they were fabulous--a big hit at home and our church pot-luck. One older gentleman at church said they were much better than the kind his wife, herself an amazing cook, makes.  The horseradish/mayo-based sauce another reviewer suggested adds some nice zest.

My Gosh!  I have never had fried green tomatoes, let alone made them, and decided to now since I had some under ripe tomatoes in my garden.  They are fantastic!  I will definitely be making these again, and I'm from New York!  Five stars!

Just made these and they sucked! The batter was grainy and gritty and crumbled into the oil.  I used peanut oil and cooked on med heat as stated, the batter was mushy and oily even after draining and then pressing with paper towels.  These also need seasoning, what a waste of beautiful farmers market tomatoes :(

Very disappointed!  The gritty cornmeal was an unwelcome taste and texture.  Flour alone does a better job.  I can't nderstand how folks can like this recipe if they have tasted fried green tomatoes without cornmeal.

I have 14 tomatoe plants this year, so I thought we would try something new (for us) this was great! We also had fresh sun tea as suggested. I thnk I may add some herbs from the garden next time just to change it up, though this recipe is perfect the way it is!thank you so much!

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I've tried making FGT several times, but never by a recipe, but i found some perfect tomatoes in the farmers yesterday and knew i had to come here and find a good recipe, well this was it!!  Didn't change much about the recipe except for adding 1/2 parmesan/romano to the breading portion of the recipe.  They were fantastic, my fiance said he'd help with the frying, he sure did, taking them from the fryer to his belly!  I only bought 2 large tomatoes so we didn't have much, but i will surely be getting more tomatoes this week, fantastic!  Sprinkled with Garlic pepper grinder when first removed from the oil, besides that, nothing needed to be adjusted, just YUM!!

These are a fall treat and I have made several batches in the last week.  I cut the flour in half and added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika to the dry mix. Egg whites worked better than a whole egg. The finished product was really crispy even though I pan fried thm in about 1/2-inch of olive oil instead of deep frying. As suggested by another reviewer, I substituted sour cream for the milk, as that is what I had and it was fine.   Perlacita de Gunajuato

It was my first time making fried green tomatoes and they turned out awesome!!! I did what others suggested and used only egg whites and halved the flour. Also I mixed the flour in with the breadcrumb mixture. To ensure that they stayed coated I dipped them in the dry mixture first, then the milk/egg mixture, and then back into the dry. Also I added some butter to the frying oil for more flavor. The coating turned out so crisp and perfect! This recipe really is foolproof! I would like to try it with zucchini and onion rings. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used buttermilk in place of milk,seasoned Italian breadcrumbs, added ground thyme to the mixture and fried zucchini in addition to the tomatoes- they were wonderful!!! My veggie-hating 6-year old fought over them with his siblings- great recipe! :).

I made these 2 nights ago and other than adding some cajun seasoning to the mixture and used some bacon grease, I did as recipe stated. These were a big hit. I don't think I cut them as thick as the recipe stated; but they weren't too thin. I love these!!!! A good southern staple!!!

Oh my gosh! These were so good! The tomatoes need to be green just turning pinkish or pale orange or slight reddish color. I used a lot less salt and only enough oil to fry in skillet. I didn't need all that oil. Amazing!!

Although I didn't follow this recipe to a T, I'm giving it 5 stars because my first batch of fried green tomatoes ever turned out so yummy! My husband cut the tomatoes about 1/4" thick; they got perfectly crispy. I also skipped the breadcrumbs and cornmeal and instead used panko breadcrumbs (which stuck to the tomatoes very well). Otherwise, didn't change a thing ... flour, egg/milk dip, panko seasoned w/S&P. I never knew they'd be so delicious and almost a bit lemony! We're making for our first dinner party as a married couple; it'll be a fun surprise for our guests!

This was great.  Hubby and I have never had FGT before, but they're now a favorite.  I added lots of salt and pepper, and omitted the cornmeal (just ran out).  But the italian breadcrumbs helped add flavor too.
Delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

I like this recipe, but made a few changes.  I used a cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper and I also added some parmesian cheese to the cornmeal\flour mixture.  I also sliced my tomatoes very thin,(personal preference) and fried them until very crisp.  Recommend highly!

I made these for supper last night and they were really good.  Now keep in mind that I have never had them but my husband was born and raised in Texas and knew them well as a child.  He said "You nailed it Baby!"
I only gave 4 stars because I did adjust the recipe after reading many reviews, for our taste and health and for the amount we were making as well.  I used 1/2 the flour called for, used egg whites instead of whole eggs, used crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs or panko, and added cajun seasoning to the cornmeal mixture.

I did not fry these and they turned out delicious.  I did tweak the recipe though.  I used half Reg. Panko and half Ital. bread crumbs, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mixed them together in a pie plate, then I put approx 1 cup of buttermilk in a pie plate next to the bread crumbs. I used med. sized tomatoes, sliced  1/4 in. thick  put  a few slices in the b.milk and dredged them in the crumbs be sure to coat them good, I pressed down kind of hard to get it to  stick. I sprayed butter spray on one side and put that side down on a cookie sheet covered in parchment paper.  I used the C. Sheet that has a double layer. I sprayed top side with butter spray (pam) and baked at 22 min. on each side,  bake at  400 degrees, yes 400.  They came out nice and crispy and oh so delicious, just as good as fried but with no grease!   I will make this my go to recipe from now on.

This was a total hit!!! My mom, whom has had MANY dishes of FGT in her life said these were the best she has ever had. She said they beat the "bang bang shrimp" at BoneFish, a local fancy restaurant, where everyone says that the shrimp is the best appetizer ever. I got lots of "wow, goodness! so good! these are awesome!" They hardly stopped showering me with compliments. This is the first time that I have ever made this dish, and I don't cook often. Easy to do, and very difficult to mess up. Recommended.

These were delightful!  I didn't add any milk to my eggs - just whisked them without it.  I sliced my tomatoes rather thin, as that's how we really like it.  Added some garlic and onion powder to the cornmeal and bread crumbs and we enjoyed them as part of a summer veggie supper.

Made the first four to recipes exact directions except I did not add the milk (none in the house at the time) and they were a little bland for my family but were crisp and the breading stayed on. The texture was perfect. Added some garlic powder, onion powder and some cayenne pepper to the breading mix and the rest were excellent! Looking forward to the next batch! Thank you for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!!! I found that I edited the recipe a bit.  I used italian style bread crumbs along with panko too - it made them super crunchy!! I also didn't slice them quite as thick.  When serving I used balsalmic vinegar drizzled on top and it was amazing.

AMAZING.  When the cajun restaurant down the street shut down, I nearly cried because I loved their fried green tomatoes.  These are even better!  I cut the salt back to about a teaspoon, and sliced the tomatoes about 1/4", but kept everything else the same.  My husband was over the moon!

Easy to make and yummy dipped in some ketchup hit with a few splashes of franks red hot.  It was a fun way to use up some end of season green tomatoes.

The recipe was very good. I didn't hate the orginal instructions/ingredants. However, being slightly bland I thought I'd livin it up by slicing the tomatoes thinner and adding garlic powder and Cajun seasoning and seasoned salt. Enjoy!

Fantastic recipe!  They were so pretty and delicious.  My husband made them using just egg white (he whipped to soft peaks) instead of whole eggs because he thinks breaded things work better with just the white.  My 6 year old, tomato hating, son said these were the best tomatoes ever and had two!!!

This was very good...I read the reviews and only used 1/2 cup flour. I had four medium to large red not quite ripe tomatoes....hard to find green in FL. The crust was very good... nice and crispy, I had a lot left over, could've done two or three more tomatoes. I mixed the flour, cornmeal and bread crumbs together, dipped the tomato slice in the egg mixture and then dredged in the flour mixture then fried in bacon grease. I had no problems with the coating staying on the tomatoes. I scrambled the left over egg and had enough for my husband and I to eat....so maybe one egg would've been enough and a 1/4 C milk. Would love to try it with green if I can ever find them.

This was as bland as bland can be.  I've never had fried green tomatoes so maybe just don't know what they should taste like.  Had to add a few shakes of hot sauce to even eat them.  My two stars are for well-written instructions.  Although, one egg would have been enough.

Y-U-M!  This was the first time I've ever tasted fried green tomatoes so I have nothing to compare them to but they we're so delicious!  I see no need to look for other recipes.  The only change I made was using egg whites instead of the whole egg.  It made it crispier.

These were very good! I followed the recipe exactly (wish I would have read reviews first, I did not think to add Parm cheese-I love it!)and mine actually came out looking like the picture! They were nice and crispy/crunchy on outside, tender on the inside!

These were great! I made some changes based on suggestions: added italian bread crumbs instead of plain, a little bit of flour to cornmeal mixture, as well as cajun and adobo seasoning and less coarse ground salt (to balance). I also let them stand in the crumb mixture while cooking the others which covered them with extra breading(extra crispy) Served them with a mayonaise, dill weed, lime juice dip inspired by a friend's visit to a southern food restaurant. They were delicious! Note: look for these tomatoes in farmers markets... didnt see them anywhere else.

My first experience with Fried Green Tomatoes.  They were really good and I was skeptical of the leftovers, but was pleasantly surprised.  Great served with sour cream.

These are great as is but even better with a shrimp, butter and garlic sauce.  They serve this at a local school fair and that booth always has a long line.  they are delicious.

I've been frying green tomatoes for many years and always had a problem keeping the batter on.  This recipe is great because dipping in the flour first solves that problem.  Other than slicing my tomatoes a bit thinner and using Italian style breadcrumbs, I followed these directions.  They turned out perfect...my husband will attest to that!

This is an excellent recipe - I've been making fried green tomatoes for years now, and this is the best I've made (and I'm in the South).  A few things I did differently... 1) slice the tomatoes about 1/4 inch or less thick. 2) laid them out on a plate to dry them out a few minutes and sprinkled with garlic salt and pepper.  I've found if you mix this into the breading you don't get enough seasoning. 3) I used a fry daddy only because it's easier.  4) Only used egg whites to prevent sogginess - something another reviewer suggested and it makes total sense.    The amounts of the ingredients were perfect - This is a terrific recipe, thanks so much Diana!!

These tomatoes are great! I changed the flour also to 1/2 cup and actually mixed it into my cornmeal. Dipped in egg whites and double dipped in cornmeal mixture. It turned out great. I will use again!

These were fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have regular breadcrumbs so I used panko (japanese breadcrumbs).  They turned out perfectly tender and WONDERFULLY crispy!  One word of warning... cooking them in cast iron will make them cook much quicker on the outside... use stainless instead!  mmmmmm

I've never eaten green tomatoes, fried or otherwise. I found these to be very flavorful and delicious. I used firm, green tomatoes and followed the recipe and they turned out great. I ate the tomatoes with pizza sauce and sour cream. Both dips tasted great with the fried green tomatoes.

I'd never had fried green tomatoes before, and this was a great first experience! Didn't have cornmeal, so just compensated with more flour and bread crumbs. The only change I would make would be to reduce the salt a bit. Served with pizza sauce and parmsean cheese.

So delicious!  I tried fried green tomatoes many  years ago with just a basic breading and was disappointed, I really didn't like them.  But I'm growing tomatoes and some unripe ones fell off the vine and I didn't want them to go to waste, so I thought I'd try again.  This coating is amazing, and they are just delicious.  I would cut back on the salt a little bit next time.  I took someone's advice and also lowered the flame to medium low after putting the tomatoes in the oil, and they came out perfectly!!

These look really good, but for the best fried green tomatoes or fried squash, all you need is an egg/milk mixture,and corn meal seasoned with salt and pepper. They're perfect!

I really feel that the coating for these deserves high marks. It was crispy and added just the right crunch to the texture of this dish. I also added some parmesian cheese to the top while they drained on the paper towels. However, something was just missing (for me) in this recipe. Hey, I guess I'm just not a fan of the flavor of fried green tomatoes, but I will certainly be using this coating method for other frying in the future. Great job!

I've tried batter-frying without much success in the past, but these tomatoes ended up with a perfect crust. I used a small sauce pan with olive oil on medium heat, checked the oil with a wooden skewer (look for bubbles), and once the first tomatoes were in, I turned the heat down to medium-low to finish frying the rest (it was a small batch of two servings). I wasn't sure about the olive oil, but the results were excellent. Thanks, Diana!

I thought this recipe was great! My husband and two year old son also loved these. I only did one thing differently and that was that I used olive oil. There were too many for the three of us as we could have eaten just these for dinner! They really were great!

My siter and I grew up watching the movie "Fried Green Tomatoes" and always wanted to try them.  We live in Southern California so they aren't popular here but we found them at a local restaurant when we were kids and loved them.  Now, when I can get green tomatoes at our farmer's market, this is the recipe I use to make them.  I've even made these and gotten a 5 year old to like them.  That's saying something.

These were really good...a little bit too salty for me but I loved the crunch. I only used about a 1/2 to 1 cup of oil though..not necessary to use a whole quart if you fry them in a skillet.

this was the first time i had green tomatoes. i had no clue how to prepare them and ended up using some very unriped hard green tomatoes. i didnt understand that they were supose to be just a tad under unripped. anyway even tho the tomatoes were pretty hard once cooked it was still pretty good. i can imagine how good it will be next time when i use the proper tomato

This was my first try with fried green tomatoes and they were delicious!  Word of caution: be careful that you brush off any excess salt before frying-mine were a tad bit salty, but still very good.  Thank you for sharing!

This was really delicious!
 I used fresh tomatoes from my garden. I used tomatoes that had a slight tint of red to it so that it will have a bit of a sweeter taste. Also, I did not cut the tomatoes into .5" thick; that is a bit too much. I also deep fried the tomatoes. They came out delicious!!!!!!!!!!

I fixed these last night and they were pretty good.  The only problem is that my husband and I thought that they were super salty.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of regular, so maybe that had something to do with it.  I will definitely try these again, but I'll probably only use half the salt.

YUMMY! :) I used some green tomatoes from my garden and sliced them really thin. I also "double dipped" into the egg/milk.  Basically I repeated the dipping process. Instead of regular bread crumbs, I used Italian style. I also fried some squash from my garden using this same recipe. I used olive oil. It was very good. I will DEFINITELY make this again. Even my hubby loved it, and he's not usually a huge fan of "good ol' southern cookin'".

These were phenominal!!!! I followed the recipe for the most part, I omitted cornmeal(I didn't have any)and replaced it with italian bread crumbs. I also added a pinch of cumin and a dash of garlic salt to the breaded coating. 
 I will be making these again, my family enjoyed them and were upset that I hadn't made more! :)

These were great! Just made these tonight. Doubled the cornmeal mix & added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. Will add more cayenne next time. Used zip-lock baggies & threw them away for quick cleaning when done. Will make again!

These were great! I just finished scarfing  them all down.  They reminded me a lot of healthy chicken fingers. :)  I had been looking at big bowl of green tomatoes from my garden for about a week now, and decided I should try something new.  
I did make a few alterations.  I used sunflower oil instead of bacon oil and egg whites instead of eggs.  
While these may not have been true to the southern tradition they tasted great to my northern tounge. :)

I think I'll use this breading method from now on, as the stuff actually *sticks* to the tomatoes! I'm not sure why someone reviewed to make the flour equal to the cornmeal and crumbs, as the flour is just a pre-dip.

That aside, there were pros and cons to the recipe. The oil wasn't hot enough for my purposes. Too high and the tomatoes don't get soft before they burn, but on medium heat the tomatoes don't brown too well. Once I turned it up to medium-high, they were perfect. Also, I think I'd add more flavor somehow. Some garlic and something a little spicy, like cayenne pepper or cumin. The original recipe, while crispy and lovely in texture, was a bit bland, in my opinion.

EXCELLENT!  My husband is from the South, and he said "These are perfect!" when he tasted them.  What a neat flavor...my first time making them and eating them.  I should have done this months ago when I had tons of green tomatoes!

I soaked the sliced tomatoes in some white vinegar for about a half an hour at room temperature before dredging and frying them.  Once again, I showed up my Southern-born and bred boyfriend who thinks he knows how to cook all things "country"...  He says these are the best fried green tomatoes he's ever eaten, and I have to agree with him!  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks, Diana!

very good, but I guess I'm in search of something more reminiscent of my mother's fried green tomatoes in Pennsylvania...maybe it's a local style.  Worse yet, I can't describe what I'm looking for very well.  Anyway, this recipe was quite good.  I began slicing thin, as another reviewer mentioned, and compared it to thicker slices...thicker cuts were better.  Preserved more of the tartness and texture of the green tomato. Yummmmm.  The cornmeal/bread mix is a good idea; the breading lightens the density of the cornmeal nicely.  Also, I added salt after cooking as well.  If I don't ever find exactly what I am looking for, this recipe will be the stand-in.  Thanks for sharing.

Didn't have kosher salt, don't know if that would have made a difference.  I thought they were a bit bland but I will probably try it again this year with ALL the ingredients called for!

After renting the movie 'Fried Green Tomatoes,' I just had to find the recipie.  I was not disappointed - these were yummy!  They go best with a Southern accent and a slice of lemon pie for dessert.   :) Laurie

I love fried green tomatoes.  I always make a mess, but it's worth it.  I've found that
bacon fat is the best frying agent (although not animal-friendly or heart friendly), it
gives the best flavor.  Also, I tried crushing up club crackers instead of bread crumbs
and added them to the cornmeal and I added a dab of butter to the bacon fat.  Yum!!!
Also, I like to use green tomatoes that have a little red on them.  I can't wait for 
summer to make them again!

I recently had for the first time the fried green tomatoes in Atlanta. As soon as I got home, I began the search for the recipe. This one was easy to make and delicious and it's the one I'm passing on to all my friends to try, as it's not usual to have fried tomatoes here! Great option!

The milk egg mix is way to thin for the recipe and that messes up everything. Added an extra egg and that helped but I would have cut milk down to maybe an 1/8 cup. The coating is pure personal preference, so If you like corn meal you'll like this and if not, not so much. I'd have just gone with bread crumbs alone or a flour/corn meal mix.

These were delicious. I made them for a group and got rave reviews. It was too much flour and not enough cornmeal mixture for me. Too much egg/milk too, but you need to be able to submerge them I guess.

These were great! I was nervous about them getting burnt, but let them go! The crispier the better! I've read some recipes that call for sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes, but I thought seasoning to taste with salt and pepper was just fine. I also liked the 3 layer dipping-helps the breading really stick.

First time having green tomatoes. Followed the recipe, they came out a bit mushy. I cooked them till the coating was nice and brown.  But never ate fried or deep fried tomatoes, not sure if thats how they were suppose to be.  I also had a Zucchini, sliced just like the tomatoes.  Yum yum, I guess due to the denser meat then that of the tomato, was favorite.

Perfectly delicious! I added a few shakes of garlic powder and paprika to the flour along with the salt and pepper. I also added parmasan cheese to my bread crumbs. Plus, I make sure to salt them a little bit right after I take them out the frying pan. These were "stupid" good!! Just as fabulous, if not even more so, then any I've had in a restaurant.

I have nothing to compare these to as I've never even eaten a fried green tomato before, but we loved them!  A co-worker was leaving for vacation and still had many tomatoes on the vine so he picked them and brought them to work in case someone might want them. I brought a few home and found this recipe.  They were quick and easy to make. I had a couple packets of "Honey-Baked Ham savory sauce" in the fridge so we used that as a "dip".  That really made these delicious!  Hubby ate the left-overs the next evening and declared them still tasty!

Excellent.  To actually double the flavor - after you dredge and before
frying....sprinkle Lemon Pepper on both sides.  This does actually double the flavor.  It is outstanding.

first time making these. Had some green tomatoes from my mother in law's garden. Absolutely sublime. Delicious. Wonderful crunch, sweet flavor inside. Nothing like it. 

i would suggest slicing them a bit thinner. I added old bay seasoning to the flour and i found the flavor complimenting the tomatoes. Used panko bread crumbs and crushed them up with the corn meal. I saw in one of the reviews a suggestion of self rising flour. I'll look into that someday.

I've made these fried green tomatoes 3 times after recently finding this recipe. My family goes nuts for them! This is the best recipe for fried green tomatoes bar none. I made a sauce to go with them out of Herdez salsa, Veganaise and Texas Pete hot sauce. Delicious! The only variance that I made to the recipe is to cut the tomato a quarter inch thick instead of the recommended 1/2 inch and also added extra pepper

These were very good. Didn't change a thing in the recipe. I did use 1 green tomato, 1 red that was mostly ripened and 2 yellow tomatoes that were just ripened. Delicious!

I love them but add a teaspoon of splenda to my egg and milk mixture to tone down the bitterness of some different kinds of tomatoes

First time I have ever made fried green tomatoes. Everyone loved it! I overheated my oil so the first few were a little extra toasty on the outside and not quite cooked through on the inside. I suggest that if you are a relatively inexperienced 'fryer', as I am, that you devise a way to test your oil temperature before putting all your tomatoes to fry (either by testing one or actually using a kitchen thermometer). Since the tomato slice is quite thick, you may need to leave it frying a little bit longer to make sure it cooks all the way through. Once I got the temperature just right, they were crunchy on the outside and tender juicy on the inside: fantastic! I made these right after watching the movie "Fried Green Tomatoes." They go together perfectly! The thick slices are so much more satisfying than thin.

Very good, but very salty. Will definitely try again with a quarter of the salt.

I just used eggwash,no flour, and substituted panko bread crumbs,and added some other sesonings, and they turned out AMAZING!!! . Served with a mix of sour cream and ranch dressing on the side to dip in and they were a huge hit!

THE BEST fried green tomatoes are what this recipes provides!  I am a southerner now living in Colorado and really appreciate a great fried green tomato (or two or three or...) now and then.  These are the best I've ever had... even when considering some really great southern restaurants I've been to.  I followed this recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE.  but i changed a couple of things because, being from Mississippi, even though we LOVE to eat, one WHOLE green tomatoe per person was a bit much.  I used 1/4 cup italian breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup of cornmeal, 2 pinches of coarse ground salt, 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper, and 1/2 c APF, 1 egg, 1/4 milk and 2 lg, not extra large, but large green tomatoes cut 1/4 inch--everybody knows a half inch is too thick!  Y'all, these were better than my grandmothers!  mmmmmmmmm

Hard to get the mix to stick to the tomatoes, but even with the crumbling, fried outer shell, it still tasted terrific.

I had never tried these before and they are really good.  I did however add a little parm cheese to the cornmeal mixture.  I also followed another posts recipe for a dipping sauce of sour cream ranch dressing and hot sauce.  I would make these again but I think I would like to try a sweeter dipping sauce like a mango chutney or something like that.

Thanks to all of your comments I took some learning from each of you. 
I went with 1/4 inch  thick slices, (will go a tad thinner next time). Sliced, salted & let rest an hour before serving. Used equal parts corn meal, flour, seasoned bread crumbs, and some salt & pepper.
I used seasoned flour, egg white & milk, then the corn meal, flour, bread crumb blend.
3 minutes a side was perfect, and they turned out great and the coating held perfectly. The only thing that was missing was some flavor. The tomatoes were sweet (I was concerned about bitterness) but still a little bland, so I made a sauce of horseradish & mayonnaise, and that hit the spot.
This was a good base recipe, thank you for posting it.

These were fabulous! The 10- 12 people at the family dinner I made them for loved them and they were gone in 15 minutes!  This includes the 24month old birthday girl and a 6year old !!  I follow many of the tips other reviewers offered: S&P added to the flour, whipped egg whites,some cayenne and seasoned salt to the cornmeal/panko coating.  I also salted the sliced tomatoes and let them sit for about 30 minutes.  I fried two large tomatoes and 4-5 small tomatoes; we all liked the small chip like tomatoes best!  I also made the suggested dip with thousand island dressing.  The tip for testing the temp of the oil with the wooden spoon, worked great!!

Made this yesterday for the first time ever and the recipe is very good. Thanks for the tip about using egg whites! The coating browns up nice and crispy. Varied it slightly by adding some brown sugar crumble to the final dredging - yum!

I have never made fried green tomatoes before, but I have certainly eaten my share. These turned out PERFECT!!!  They were super simple and fantastic.  My aunt doesn't like them usually.  I had to keep her from eating the whole plate.  Excellent recipe.

Great batter! I subbed wheat germ for the breadcrumbs since I don't keep them around. Instead of frying, I "oven-fried" (baked) mine at 425 F. Not quite the same as frying, but they still turned out fantastic!

This recipe is a keeper! I made it as is except for a few changes - I fried them in peanut oil, and only needed a little oil for pan frying.  I also added some seasonings to the corn meal/bread crumb mixture: Lawry's seasoned salt, a dash of onion powder, freshly ground black pepper, and paprika.

Very good! I dipped mine in buttermilk instead of milk.  It's richer and helps the dredge stick so nicely! Yummy!

This recipe is fantastic! Per another review, I omitted one of the egg yolks. Also, I fried the tomatoes for a good 20 minutes. The result is a perfectly soft interior with a crispy exterior. Delicious. Even my 2 year old devoured her portion!

This was my first time eating fried green tomatoes and they were really tasty! The batter has lots of crunch and would probably be great for any number of other foods as well. My only substitution was whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.

I loved these! I've made these before with a different recipe (cornmeal) and I hated them! But I was determined the batter was to blame. So I'm glad I searched until I found this one. Yummy!

Great recipe. I've always had trouble getting the flour to stick through the frying process. Dipping in flour first, then egg, then cornmeal was a great idea. They turned out great!

Excellent recipe.  The coating stayed on, and they were just fabulous.  I am experiencing mild depression now that winter is coming and green tomatoes are almost a thing of the past.

We loved these tomatoes!  My teenage granddaughter ate with us, and announced that she didn't like any kind of tomato. After we encouraged her to try them, she ate four!  I made the dipping sauce as recommended by another review.  Added a little cream to make it a better consistancy. Will definitely make them again...maybe tomorrow!!

I LOVED this! I added a small handful of corn grits (Polenta) to the bread crumb/corn meal mixture! So good! I didn't have regular plain corn meal, so I used a box of Jiffy!! I made this with my 2 year old little guy and he asked for more!! A quick sprinkle of sea salt while they're still hot- man, this is the way to begin Fall!!

I've never made or eaten fried geen tomatoes before, so I wasn't sure what to expect...I LOVED THEM! I halved the recipe because I only had 2 tomatoes, cutting them about 1/4" thick, added garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture and added some hot sauce to the egg mixture. They came out so nice and crisp! I had no issues w/ the breading coming off at all. Great flavor and very addicting. It's a shame that I can't get green tomatoes all year round, but this will be a definate repeat recipe for the times when I do! Thanks for sharing. :)

Although the breading held nicely, the egg taste detracted from the tomato taste for me.  Perhaps just using beaten egg whites alone may help.  Prior to trying this recipe (exactly as stated), I've always simply floured the slices with salt and pepper then fried them in butter.  I prefer the taste of my method more.

This was a first for me. My hubby and I don't like fresh tomatoes but decided to grow them this year. I had a ton of green tomatoes since my plant is done for the season. I did half bread crumbs with half fried onions. They were good dipped in ketchup.

Made this the other night with fresh picked green tomatoes out of our garden.  Very simple and VERY tasty!!

I hate to admit that even thought we LOVE fried green tomatoes, we didn't have a recipe to make the batter.  NOW WE DO!!!

This recipe was amazing. I have eaten fried green tomatoes all over the south and these were the best! 

I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a little sour cream with the milk and egg. I also added Tony's cajun seasoning to the breading.

Amazing!!!

These were great! If it weren't for recipes like these being on the internet, I would still be making food that people had to cringe and smile over. Hey, I grew up on canned and fast food ;) *I used stone ground whole wheat flour and they were still amazing (it's not even close to making this healthy, but will still make them tasty for newbies)

i followed this recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  the flour to liquid to cormeal combo kept them juicy on the inside, crisp on the outside.  i think the slices were about 1/2inch thick, didn't get too soggy or squishy but were still completely cooked.

I love these!  I cut down the flour by 1/2 cup, and instead of milk soaked them in buttermilk. My daughters love them, but like them a bit sweeter. So, I add about a 1/2 to 1 tbsp of white sugar and once they have fried sprikle while hot with a little sugar. They eat them up!

My first time ever having fried green tomatoes. I am terrible at frying things (which is probably a good thing). The proportions of this recipe were perfect. I experimented with the thickness of tomato slices; I like mine thinner. Now I just need a good sauce for the next time I make this.

Yummy! I ad-libbed this with cornmeal mix (cornmeal and flour in one) combined with an equal of bread crumbs, and red pepper, garlic powder, S&P. Dredged the tomatoes in dry mix, then wet, then dry again. They came out flavorful, crispy, not overly greasy. These are the best I have ever had!   Serve with buttermilk ranch dressing.

These fried green tomatoes are wonderful!!! I followed the directions and added a few changes. I added 1tbs cayenne pepper to the mixture of bread crumbs and cornmeal. I also let the batter sit on the tomatoes for 10 mins before frying them. Turned out absolutely amazing!

This is a great receipe but to make it even better I use garlis croutons in place of the bread crumbs. My mother in law raves to everyone about them!

I had a few tomatoes that accidentally got knocked off the vines so I decided to make this recipe.  My husband (who thought he didn't like fried green tomatoes) really enjoyed them as did our son.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.

These were beyond fabulous.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  First of all, I had only tried fried green tomatoes once before.  Now I'm in love.  This recipe was perfect.  I used panko bread crumbs because that's all I had and I wanted to ensure crispiness.  The flavor was wonderful.  I really appreciated the tip under the reviews to use wax paper for the flour and breadcrumb piles.  Easy cleanup!  I'll be making these over and over again!

FANTASTIC!!!  The only changes I made was to use egg whites instead of the entire egg (I just don't love egg yolks) and I used panko bread crumbs.  These were perfectly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside---yummy!!!!

Just perfect.  At least once a season, I have to make fried green tomatoes, and this is the way I like to do them.  I use the same dredging method on a number of meals, so it is pretty easy and something one of my daughters can help with.

Disclaimer: We are not big fans of fried food, so my review may be a little schewed!  I had a ton of green tomatoes, so I had to use them up.  These tomatoes were pretty good, but not our favorite.  One change I made was I used flavored breadcrumbs.  We might use the recipe again next year, but I'm not sure if we really even like fried green tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe (the tomatoes and corn meal mixture parts only) and sliced the tomatoes 1/4 inch thick. It turned out great! I'll definitely be making this again.

I thought these were really good and I don't think I would change much except a little less flour, and don't use as much as the recipe calls for because you just throw out extra.

This was my first attempt at this. My husband has wanted me to make them for a long time now. He loved them, but I wasn't especially fond of them. I think I would like them better without the cornmeal & just use flour. But he loved them, so thats all that mattered.

Wonderful!!  We loved these.  The only thing we did different was add some hot sauce to the egg/milk mixture and some cayenne to the cornmeal/bread crumb mixture, because we love them spicy.  We plan to use the leftovers tomorrow for BLTs.  I did have a ton of egg left over, so next time I will probably only use one egg and crack another if need be.

I made this recipe as written - except I sliced them about a 1/4 inch thick - and it was absolutely delicious.  Perfectly crispy and just the right amount of spice.  Big hit with everyone.

These were quite bland for our taste; think slicing the tomatoes 1/4 inch instead of 1/2 inch would help but I will try again substituting garlic salt for the kosher salt and add a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning.

I halved this recipe, used yellow heirloom tomatoes (salted for 15 mins on a paper towel), fried them, topped with a little bit of freshly grated parm, and served with Annie's Goddess Dressing on lettuce. Such a great dinner.  I also added chili pepper and smoked paprika to my four mix.

This was great  - I never made them before but lost my plants to the tomato blight and had a ton of green tomatoes to cook - they came out perfectly.  I deep fried them after I did the breading.  I let them sit for a few minutes before cooking and they came out wonderfully.

Never had fried green tomatoes so I have nothing to compare this recipe to. It tasted great even though I'm not a cornmeal fan. I'll keep trying different recipes to see which one I like the most.

Never had Fried Green TOmatoes before, and if this is how they are supposed to taste than I likely never will again.  Very bland and bitter.  I prefer much more flavor.  Maybe I should have tried them thinner sliced like many reviewers state, but at this rate I likely won't bother.

Tomatoes really only need to be about 1/4 inch or less thick.. the thicker they are, the longer they take to cook, the more likely they are to have the corn breading burn. Corn breading very good. I have never had fried green tomatoes before, but my boyfriend from Mississippi has. He loved them, I loved them after I threw some ranch dressing on top. Great chance to use up some end crop of tomatoes before making the green tomato relish (on this website)

This recipe turned out wonderful. The tomatoes were delicious. I used 1 egg instead of two. I used plain bread crumbs and corn meal which I seasoned as much as the flour with garlic/pepper seasoning and a little onion salt. Here's something to add: I put crumbled feta(mediterranean) cheese on top . My husband loved them. As one also said, you can use tomatoes of all colors. SOme of mine were yellow. Bon appetit.

These were great! I made them for my husband as we had a ton of tomato plants in our new home, and he loves anything tomato! I am not a fan of tomatoes, but even I really liked these! I have always wanted to try Fried Green Tomatoes and I'm glad I chose this recipe. I did use italian breadcrumbs and I thought the flavor was wonderful. I would like to try them with the traditional batter also, but this recipe is a definite keeper. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they really are best fresh - if they sit too long or get cool they are pretty soggy.

I'm not really a fried green tomatoes fan, but my husband loved these!  He liked the cornmeal coating rather than the batters that restaurants usually use.  He did say that 1/2" was a little thick ... some slices that were closer to 1/4" were better.  (I do have to add that frying just makes a mess everywhere ... I know why I hardly ever do it!)

I grew up watching Fried Green Tomatoes with mom and have ALWAYS wanted to eat them. A few years ago I tried to make some and they were AWFUL...so I tried this recipe with some trepidation, but they turned out DELICIOUS! Even my friend that doesn't really like tomatoes enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is my first time making or eating fried green tomatoes.  They were good.  Reminded me of deep fried pickles.  Easy to make too.

First time making and even eating fried green tomatoes, and these were the Bomb! Ha! With leftover tomatoes from my garden, I was able to create a nice side dish for dinner. The recipe was easy to follow, but I did substitute whole wheat flour and (peanut oil – all I hand on hand) and they turned out nice and crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside: Perfect :-)

I have never made fried green tomatoes before and was pleased that these turned out very well.  They're a little messy when applying the coatings, but the coating stayed on really well and I liked the crunch of the cornmeal.  My only complaint is that they were a little bland compared to ones I've had in restaurants, and I would add more pepper next time.

I liked them, but husband and son did not.  I think they're not used to the flavor of green tomatoes.  In any event, a fair amount of work and mess for an okay dish and leftovers go soggy.

Great flavor.  Easy to make.  I cut back a little on the salt (just a personal preference).  Will make these again.
Thanks for the recipe.

GOOD...I loved the first bite, crunch, then a tangy green tomato inside.  I might use Italian bread crumbs next time and use a little less salt.  BUT we liked these very much and will make again.  :o)

Perfect fried green tomatoes!  Great crsipy texture and excellent flavor.  These were pretty salty, which is how I like my fried green tomatoes, but those who don't like their food too salty may want to decrease the amount of salt a bit.  Also, I used extra virgin olive oil, and it was excellent!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were a good start but the breading seemed a little thin, i'll have to expirement with that a little.. The breading did not fall off when I cooked it though, which was really nice. Overall this is a very good start.

Excellent!  We made two changes and it was perfectly suited for our tastes.  We used buttermilk(gourmet, NOT low fat) instead of regular and added Ritz crackers to the crumb mix.  Simply the best fried tomatoes EVER!

Great breading technique. I sprinkled some of Emeril's Original Essence on some of them before serving for those who likes them spicier but they are also good with just the salt and pepper.

This is a great recipe for Fried Green Tomatoes... but we fried ours in a mixture of 1/2 cup bacon grease and 1/2 cup oil in a large pan (this fried up about 15).

These are the best Fried Green Tomatoes I have ever made.  The dipping in flour than the breadcrumb mixture made the coating stay on better.

I just made these... halved the recipe.  I had never had a fried green tomato, and my husband is from the south, and had been licking his chops as soon as out tomato plants sprouted some greens, and he loved these!!  The best he ever had, he says!

I am a newlywed and my husband wanted some "good ol" home cooked food like his mom used to make him.  He has always loved her fried green tomatoes.  What an awesome compliment it was to hear him say..."these are better than Mom's"!  I found that, although a bit messy (that's the fun), they were incredibly easy and not greasy at all!  Bravo on making a new meal for my growing recipe book!  Thanks!

I had never tried fried green tomatoes before but had always wanted to.  Well, I don't need to look any further for a recipe.  This one is fantastic. I even tried it with some of my fresh zucchini and loved it.  I didn't have any corn meal so I had to substitute Jiffy corn muffin mix but it worked great.  Will definitely make these again and again.  Thanks!

Made with gluten free flour (king author measure for Measure brand) and gluten free panko bread crumbs (4c brand) and stone ground corn meal. It came out delicious! The crust was thick and crispy and the tomatoes were soft and tangy. Yummy!

They were delicious and yes I did make a change I only had Italian Bread Crumbs i used that in place of just Bread Crumbs and they were delicious. 
I would use the same change when I make them again.

Made these a few days ago. I have tried different recipes before without the breading staying on well but this worked great and was delicious. The only change I would make would be to slice the tomatoes 1/8" to 1/4" thick max. 1/2" slices were to thick in my opinion. But other than that they were great!

These are fantastic. I added a bit of cayenne to the bread crumbs and used a half and half mixture of cornmeal and panko. I also used buttermilk rather than plain milk.

They were so popular with my family that I was begged to make them again a few days later (when a storm blew down a tomato plant and left us with green tomatoes again).

I love fried green tomatoes!!! I usually just coat them in cornmeal or in Italian breadcrumbs, but decided to do something different today and chose this lovely recipe and I'm so glad I did!!!! I followed the recipe, except used seasoned breadcrumbs. They were great and everyone in the family asked for seconds. The prep was a little messy, but well worth the extra effort. Thank you for this wonderful dish. Now I just need to get my hands on some more green tomatoes so I can make them again..

I followed the recipe exactly but used green Roma tomatoes.  I really believe the corn meal helps hold the fried product together better.  I a d my family had never had them before. We added a dipping sauce of jalapeño ranch dressing.  Raves!

Just made this and it was fantastic!!!  I love fried green tomatoes and this one hit the bullseye.  Will definatley use this one again.  I can not say how good this was, but it reminded me of when I was young and my mom made it.  I have tried making this before and it never came out quite right.  This was perfect. I used an iron skilet and cooked outside on my grill.  I think that works best, keeps heat out of the house and somehow, just cooking outside seems to make everything taste better!

We made this and instead of milk and eggs, I used buttermilk which is thicker and adheres to anything better. I also added a dash of cayenne peppers which made this with a little bit of a kick

I loved this recipe! It was perfect comfort food! I did double the cornmeal and bread crumbs, but I like a nice thick crust on my fried green tomatoes! Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was the perfect fried green tomato recipe. I made it with the exact ingredients but sliced the tomatoes thinner. My husband would have liked them thicker, so I will follow the recipe exactly the next time and see how they turn out. I also made the suggested sauce with the mayo (1/2 c), Dijon mustard (1 tbsp), horseradish ( 1 tbsp) and red wine vinegar (1 tsp). It was the perfect compliment. Thank you all!

When I made this all I had was Italian style bread crumbs.  They were very good.  I have made these in the past and they never turned out but this one turned out wonderful.  I also sliced them a lot thinner and that made a big difference.

I used equal parts flour and corn meal, as suggested by other reviewers.  I made sure to cut the tomato slices very thin.  They were easy and delicious.  I topped them with fresh crab meat.  An amazing summer dinner!

My tomatoes have just barely started turning pink, and with all the friends I had coming over for MemDay, I had to find something to do with them. I'm so glad I found this recipe! I sliced mine about 1/3" thick instead of a full 1/2", used almond milk (which worked perfectly), and panko bread crumbs. Seriously great recipe for some good old fashioned fried green tomatoes.

These were honestly the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had, but I just used the recipe as a rough guideline and winged it. I was out of cornmeal, so I ground some tortilla chips and added those to panko. And instead of using eggs, I mixed the milk with caesar salad dressing. Lastly, I seasoned the tomatoes with Cavender's Greek seasoning and Whole Spice brand sea salt and malt vinegar. Oh, and I was out of vegetable oil, so I pan fried these in about a quarter cup of olive oil, flipping each side.

Try this recipe using cracker meal instead of the corn meal mixed with bread crumbs. The batter is lighter which allows more of the tomato's flavor to come through.

This recipe was delicious!   I changed two things;  I used buttermilk and panko bread crumbs.  I also halved the ingredients because I was cooking for two people.  Could have served 4 but we didn't let them go to waste!  Served with a remoulade sauce and a horseradish cream sauce.  Tasty!  Thank you for sharing.

I love to cook and making things easy. After looking at every comment I went this route. Tomatoes have to be super green. No tinge of pink. I only fried one tomatoe and cut it 1/4 inch thick. I omitted egg because batter doesnt stick as well with egg and milk. On a wax sheet of paper pour 1/3 cup of cornmeal, flour, seasoned breadcrumbs. A dash of garlic powder, seasoned salt, and mix together. soak tomatoe in milk, PRESS into the mix and really squish it there. PEANUT OIL a must. Heat on high and when its ready carefully lay the tomatoes in there. dont move them around. when it gets a nice brown color then carefully turn over. cook and then transfer to paper towel. I made a dip suggested on here of mayo,mustard,vinegar, but I added spicy ketchup. yum

Very good and easy to follow recipe! Although green tomatoes hold a lot of water, the second time I made them I let them sit out for awhile to let some water drain off...it was better a the second time!

My family loved the recipe. The only adjustment I made was I used mushroom batter instead of cornmeal because I was out of cornmeal. I also doubled the recipe for my large family. They all loved it. I will definitely use it again.

This is excellent!  I have never had fried green tomatoes before, but had an abundance of them in the garden this year, so looked here for a recipe, and found this.

Here are some minor modifications I made the second time, which solved that problem:

I sliced the tomatoes and laid them on paper towels on a platter. I salted them lightly. Before frying them, I dried the tops with another paper towel.

I reduced the amount of milk mixed with the eggs to about 3 tablespoons.

Because we like spicy food, I added a teaspoon of cayenne to the cornmeal mix, and when the tomatoes were served, I topped each slice with a spoonful of red salsa.

This recipe is a 5 star as printed; I am just adding my changes if someone is looking for a slightly different taste.

Love the breading! I think 1/2" slices are too thick, though. I cut mine about 1/4 to 3/8 " and they seem to get done as the outside got brown. I do double dip the slices in the milk and breading and that helps it to stick. The tomatoes keep coming this fall so we will make this often. I will try using buttermilk next time.

I've never had fried green tomatoes, (though I read a book by that name) but this year my tomatoes did not ripen before the first frost so I picked them all and hunted for recipes.  This one was the BEST!  juicy tomatoes inside crispy crust...mmmm.  Next year, I'll pick the tomatoes green just to use this recipe.

Loves the way my tomatoes came out so I decided to try pork chops using the same recipe! Wow came out delicious. I didn't have cornbread mix so I just omitted it.

Followed exactly as written except used seasoned breadcrumbs, since that's what I had on hand. Scrumptious! Fried them in canola oil and topped with a bit if Parmesan cheese.

My first review ever and I use allrecipes quite a bit!  Fantastic got some fresh green  tomatoes at local farmers market and cooked them the same day.  My only change was to use some smoked bacon drippings together with the vegetable oil. Oh so yummy and to top with remoulade that I made as well.

I have never had Fried Green Tomatoes, but I have heard about them so much that I really wanted to try them. These taste great! I did add some cayenne and I really liked that; gave  it a bit of a bite. I especially appreciated one hint of the wooden spoon in the oil to see if it's at the right temp. (if you do that and bubbles come off the spoon, it's ready.) Yum!

Never had fried green tomatoes before, perhaps I'm just not a fan of them in general, but this really didn't taste good at all. They did look beautiful, and the batter worked perfectly, crunchy and it stuck to the tomatoes well, but ultimately the cornmeal was too hard and gritty, and even after frying them, green tomatoes are simply sour. Fried+sour is not a combination that appeals to me whatsoever. So three stars for the recipe coming out as it should (I think), but I really didn't like this at all and my husband and I threw away most of what we made.

I had trouble with the cornmeal ending up in the pan of oil and burning up. This created a mess and it stunk. But the actual fried tomatoes tasted good. I'm just not sure about the cornmeal.

This is the first time I have ever had green tomatoes or fried green tomatoes. A bad storm hit and some of my unripe tomatoes fell off the plant... I thought it was really good and crispy. The cornmeal gave it the added "crunch" and my husband and I liked it quite a bit. I cut the tomatoes into 1/4" thick like most other reviewers and just eyeballed the flour, cornmeal and bread crumbs portion. Also, I used Panko bread crumbs as that is the only bread crumbs I have.

Just made these exactly to the recipe - fantastic! I sliced some thinner, some thicker. The thinner were more like chips, very crispy and tasty. The thicker ones were more like a vegetable side dish. Both were yummy. Add a bit of salt, some lemon juice at serving, and stand back - the family will devour!

The recipe turned out great! Crunch on the outside, soft on the inside; however, I had a major problem that I don't think I can blame on the recipe. The tomatoes turned out extremely sour! I've only had fried green tomatoes once before and I don't think that is how it is supposed to be.

This is one of the best recipes I have every tried.  I didn't use any breadcrumbs (don't like the crunchiness) and I seasoned them before flouring.  My kids ate them all up and asked me when was I cooking them again.

This is the first time I have ever tried these.  A friend from the South loves them so I always gave her my end of season green tomatoes, but this year I had so many that I decided to try them.  This recipe is good.  I changed a the spices a little.  It was crisp and tastey.  The tomatoes were a bit tart, but that wasn't because of the recipe.

I used seasoned bread crumbs like others mentioned, but I thought it was too overpowering for these. If I made again I would use plain bread crumbs and add my own seasonings. Otherwise, these weren't too bad.

What a great breading for this!  I made some of these thick and some thin and they each had different good points.  I prefered them thinner, but I'd recomend trying both to see what you like.  Oh, and I'm allergic to eggs, so I made it without.  That way you don't actually have to measure out either the milk or the flour.

Very good for my first time making it. Had a little struggle making flour stick on tomatoes but used a fork which helps. I let it soak on paper towel then transferred to a cooling rack to crisp it up as it cools off. I paired it with buffalo wings and green onion and celery and blue cheese dip. Bloody Mary tops  off this yummy dinner,!

The breading stuck well to the tomatoes.   However the tomatoes were tasteless.   They were Quite hard, maybe they were not done enough or maybe it was the kind of green tomato I used.    I couldn't cook them any longer without burning the breading.

I followed this recipe, but made a lower carb version.  Swapped out flour for almond flour and used flax seed meal instead of corn meal. I picked the green tomatoes, but waited too long to cook them.  All 4 had just a spot of color to them, and the flavor was incredible.  I also added just a pinch of garlic powder to the dredge.

I made these for the first time ever!  I'm really proud of the way they turned out.  I bought Rothbury's croutons and smashed them up to use as the bread crumbs.  They tasted great and didn't even need any dip!  (Although I did use Ranch dressing.) Yum!

Very easy way to use up unripened tomatoes.  These are bvery good and at 1/2” thick they are meaty!  Used Ranch/Franks hot sauce mix to dip them,

These were AMAZING!  My husband has always made fried green tomatoes in the past but I wanted to try.  I didn't have corn meal but had a box of Jiffy muffin mix.  I used it in place and they tasted great.  I added some pimento cheese on 1/2 of them before they were completely cooled and it was pretty tasty too.  Will def make again

Made with combo olive oil and bacon drippings. used alternative milk ( oat milk) because I am lactose intolerant. Maybe could have used more salt, but they were tasty none the less.

This was the first time I've ever tried fried green tomatoes and one of the VERY rare times I followed a recipe exactly.  Delicious!  Even my husband loved them and he doesn't really like tomatoes.  Now I have a use for all of the green tomatoes left over from our early fall.

This is a delicious treat made exactly to the recipe! Tastes just like my Grandma used to make!
My daughter didn't like the crunch of the corn meal, so we made a batch with corn flour. They had the same delicious taste with less crunch for sensitive teeth :)

They turned out great.  I didn’t add milk to the egg and I used panko instead of bread crumbs.  This made them very crispy on the outside, but juicy on the inside.

I will make again.  Instead of dredging in bread crumbs separately,  I mixed all dry ingredients (bread crumbs,  salt,  pepper, flour and buttermilk cornmeal). I coated in flour mixture  first, then in egg/milk,  and last in flour mixture again then fried.  These were perfect.  Restaurant quality.  Love the recipe!

I hate to review a recipe I made changes to but I didn't have the cornmeal or the bread crumbs.  I improvised and crushed club crackers in my food processor.  Using 1 C flour and 1 C crushed club crackers I also followed someone else's suggestion to use only the egg whites instead of the whole egg. . My fried green tomatoes turned out super crispy, not at all soggy. I will definitely make them this way again.

No changes necessary - an absolutely delightful dish. I did serve it with a tangy, chipotle enhanced remoulade, however. I will certainly make this again!

I made these for the first time in my life, tonight, and this recipe is DELICIOUS! I'd give it 10 stars, if possible! I used some large heirloom variety green tomatoes from my garden, and my entire family LOVED every single bite. This recipe and its companion dipping sauce is a surefire keeper! I didn't have corn meal on hand, so used plain bread crumbs instead; I also didn't have buttermilk so used regular whole milk instead - both substitutes created zero problems. These truly are the Perfect Fried Green Tomatoes! Enjoy!

I made the recipe exactly as it is written and used one big green tomato and a couple of firm red tomatoes.  I sliced them a bit thinner than recommended in the recipe and I let them sit on a paper towel for a long time before frying to get some of the moisture out.  They turned out GREAT!  Made them for a Southern Summer dinner party theme and I couldn't be happier!

I was looking for a good fried green tomato recipe and this is it! Delicious crispy outside and once they cool, you can pick them up and eat them with your fingers. The only thing I’d do different is add salt to the tomatoes before I put them in the flour and add a little more after they are finished frying. This is my new go to recipe

I agree with the other reviewers that 1/2 inch is way too thick.  I would suggest slicing them 1/4 thick.

These fried green tomatoes were the best I've eaten in a long time. My husband (who usually doesn't like fried green tomatoes)  loved them! I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of unseasoned and coarse black pepper instead of ground.  They were great! I think that I will use buttermilk next time to see if that makes a difference. I will definitely make these again, and again, and again.

These were amazing. This was the first time I’ve made fried green tomatoes at home but I wanted to use some of my farmer’s market produce so I gave them a shot. This recipe is great. I added some paprika and a dash of cumin to the cornmeal mixture, though I’m not sure it was enough to affect the flavor. I also did what another reviewer suggested and used egg whites (4) instead of whole eggs. The tomatoes came out super crispy and just delicious. I may end up eating them all by myself. I’d give more than 5 stars if I could.

I made as directed. Came out perfectly. I added salt at the end and ranch dressing to dip them in, I think.next timeI'll slice them a bit thinner,  but other then that they were really yummy, and I also paired  my green tomatoes with a  cherry limeade. So good.

The breading was awesome (I used the breading for onions rings and they came out great!), but the cut is terrible! I had to finish my tomatoes in the oven to keep people from getting sick. Cut them 1/4 inch thick and fry quickly, and you should be good.

These were soooooo good. The only variation that I did was to to add a ranch seasoning packet to the cornmeal/ bread crumb breading. The ranch flavor gave it an extra kick that my family loved.

These fried green tomatoes were good, however I followed the suggestion from Ripemango to oven fry them at 400'F for 40 minutes on an oiled baking sheet and omit the eggs.

A little too salty, but otherwise a great recipe. I recommend you let the fried product sit about 5-10 minutes after removing from the fryer to let them soften internally as they continue to cook. Also, make sure you drain them well.

These were so delicious!  The coating stayed on nicely. The only thing I would do differently is to slice them thinner or lower the flame so they can cook longer w/o burning. They were a little hard inside. I served them with a Cajun sour cream/mayo. I will definitely be making them again.

The recipe is good PROVIDED you slice the tomatoes 1/4" thick and not 1/2" as the recipe calls for.  1/2" is too thick and the tomatoes will still be totally raw and hard when the coating is well browned.  A little garlic powder and a dash or two of paprika in the coating helps the flavor.

I absolutely loved these. It’s a quick and simple recipe, but with super crunchy, flavorful results. I always read the comments, slicing the tomatoes to 1/4 inch and reduced the flour to 1/2 cup. Next time, I might serve with a garlic sauce instead of ranch dressing, but they were certainly tasty alone!

I did make the original recipe. I read soooo many of the reviews.  I liked the original, but because I'm...me, I tweaked.  Sliced the tomatoes, added salt and put them on a rack for 30 min. and let them drain off liquid.  Wiped them off/patted dry as possible, then seasoned the tomato directly - salt, pepper, and a little SUGAR! Seasoned the flour with onion powder, garlic powder, and a little Old Bay.  Used Panko with corn meal on the last step before frying.  Topped with fresh grated parmesan and parsley. Rave reviews from all that tasted it at an event.

Tried the mayo sauce that was mentioned.  Good. Again, I tweaked with the addition of onion powder, a squirt of Italian dressing and a hint of sugar - if  it's southern, it probably has a little sugar somewhere.  I posted a pic. Thanks for reading.

Great recipe! My family like it as well. I did have to re-dip the tomatoes in the egg was after the first breading to making it really stick to the tomatoes. 
I will be making it again.

Love this! Quick, easy and not that many ingredients needed. I even used this recipe to fry zucchini. I did find using a plate for the flour to be annoying so I used Tupperware.

These were delicious and juicy! I followed the suggestions from a review and added garlic powder and onion powder, less salt, and sliced thinner. Everyone raves about these fried green tomatoes!

I thought they had a great flavor. I found that there wasn't enough of the bread crumb mixture to coat both of the tomatoes, so I added another 1/2 of what the recipe called for to the mixture. I also added garlic powder and used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper because I love the warmth of it. I used almond milk instead of cows milk, just depends on your preference. I will definitely make these again, thank you.

These were amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and my family loves them.  I kept them warm on a rack over a sheet pan while I finished frying all the tomatoes.  I served them with goat cheese sprinkled in top.  Absolutely delicious.

I made it exactly as the recipe called and it was delicious. I’ve never had these before and I didn’t know what to expect flavor wise. It had a little tart from the tomatoes and savory from the breading.  Very tasty.

I agree with some of the reviews that this is sliced way too thick.    One very important step is to salt the tomatoes prior to preparing.  This makes a huge difference (it will help the half inch thick ones though).  You will have WAY more luck, better end product and more delicious. Don't slice them too thin like one comment suggested.  It will taste like batter and you will get minimal flavor of the fried green tomato. Also, as a side note, the video definitely is showing tomatillos and not green tomatoes.

These were good but I did add more flavor as they were a bit bland.  Also Cut them a bit thinner, the bigger cut as suggested was a bit too firm by the time the crust was done.  Thinner cut and more spice/herbs and it was wonderful.  Good base recipe to tweak.

This is the first time I made fried green tomatoes.  I have lots of tomatoes to use, so I thought I would try this recipe. 
These are awful. Bland, no flavor, although they were crunchy. The directions are easy to follow  though and they looked like the picture. I won't waste my time making these again.

Excellent recipe. This is the first time I fried green tomatoes. My wife and son absolutely loved them. I used Italian rather than the regular bread crumbs. Additionally, I sprinkled the fried tomatoes with Parmesan cheese.

These were excellent. I did have a hard time getting the coating to stay on, some spots it's like it just wouldn't cook. Not sure if it's user error or the recipe. In any case it was still delicious.

Loved it, made as per recipe except I added cayenne to flour and to bread crumb mixture and used buttermilk. I served it with a spicy buttermilk ranch dressing and topped it with Parmesan, delicious. I'm not clear why people are cutting back on flour, it's used to allow milk mixture to stick.

Didn't make any changes. Perfect the way it was. But will probably make it with almond flour this week as my daughter doesn't tolerate gluten very well. I'm sure it will still be delish tho. Gunna make some for my Yankee cousins. Wish me well.

I made no changes to this recipe.  I have made it twice and love it.  Use green tomatoes not any that are slightly pink.

They were good, but not the best I have made.  I did make a slight error following the instructions, so I plan to try again tomorrow. 
I prefer tomatoes, not ripe, but with a slight blush. They seem to have more tomato flavor when fried

Very good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used Kentucky Kernel Seasoned flour in lieu of regular flour.   Be sure to cook in a well preheated iron skillet for best results. 
 I mix peanut oil and butter.  Fantastic!

I made this, added Tony's Chachere's creole seasoning to the tomatoes before dipping them in the flour and then topped with grated Parmesan cheese after frying and they were delicious!! I love all recipes!! Also I cut the tomatoes thinner than the recipe called for and they taste better that way!

These were great. I did not cut the tomatoes as thick either and by mistake I mixed all the dry ingredients together and they turned out just fine with a nice thin crispy crust. I would add more salt the next time.

There are only 2 of us so I just cut the recipe in half easily. I did read reviews and took a bit of others advice on cutting back on the salt and adding a bit of garlic powder and onion powder. I did find the flour could be cut back on also. These fried up easily and quickly and I had no problem with the batter sticking to the tomatoes. I did cut them a little thinner though than instructed but it's all personal taste. I had a ranch salad dressing which paired well with this. First time making this and it won't be the last. Hubby actually enjoyed them too!

Very, very good recipe. I used the last of my garden tomatoes (10 small"ish") before the anticipated frost. Definitely discard the ends. Overall a good recipe that will not disappoint. Let cool before tearing into! Did not change anything besides using a deepfryer. I need to look up some hints for the breading process as I made a significant mess and the wash "seeped" away from the areas my crumb coated fingers touched after the dunk and before the crumbs. Kept well and tasted just as good, if not better, the day after cooking. Nice crispy coating. Use all the salt listed, these are tomatoes after all.

Turned out great. I made the mistake of not serving immediately, so they'd lost the crispness, but I did taste one right after cooking and it was absolutely delicious.

This recipe was easy to follow but a little messy.   Before when I made fried green tomatoes I used an egg first then a cornmeal, flour salt and pepper mixture... it was just as good and not as messy.

These are great with a light and very crispy crust. I used seasoned bread crumbs and cut the tomatoes a little thinner than 1/2". Also didn't use a quart of oil!, but they were still perfect.

One or more people apparently misread the recipe as I noted in their review about changing the recipe. FYI, you don't mix the flour, cornmeal and bread crumbs. The tomato slice is dredged in flour to dry the surface of the tomato so the egg wash will stick, Then you drag it in the cornmeal and bread crumb mix. 
Great recipe. Can add some garlic for extra taste, but just a hint so not to overpower the tomato.

Delicious!  Didn't even bother with corn meal and they were still wonderful.  Instead of adding salt like the recipe suggested, which seemed like a lot of salt, I just salted and peppered the sliced tomatoes as that draws out some of the liquid.  Then lightly dip in flour, egg mix and Italian bread crumbs and fry in a small amount of coconut oil, not enough to come up the sides, just enough to cover the bottom of the tomatoes.  If you don't cook them too high, they will soften without getting too dark.  They were tender and had a light coating.

My very first time making fried green tomatoes. I usually avoid the dipping+dredging+frying foods because it's time consuming, but  these came together surprisingly quickly. Followed advice of another review to use only egg white. Batter stuck perfectly and they fried up beautifully. I do feel there is a bit of flavor missing, just not sure what would fit..... But definitely delicious.

These were really good! After reading some reviews did not cut 1/2 thick more like a 1/4. Used 4C seasoned bread crumbs made with Pecorino Romano Cheese! Will make again thanks for the recipe!

I'm hooked! I patted the tomatoes dry before flouring and used panko breadcrumbs. Yummy, even without a dipping sauce.

Used almond meal instead of corn meal.  Coating stuck nicely to tomatoes.  Sliced 3/8" thick as well.  Boiled some hot sausage and put it in marinara sauce then on top of fried tomatoes.  A little shredded Parmesan on top and served this for breakfast.  Really flavorful and unexpected at breakfast.

These were good, but I think next time I'll do as others suggest and reduce the flour. Also need some spice besides just S&P, just not sure what yet. Thanks for a good basic recipe!

I had a few tomatoes that were getting ripe but splitting due to heavy rain, so my tomatoes were red instead of green. They were delicious.

This recipe was awesome! Texture was great and quantities were perfect ratios for tomatoes : dredging mix. Of course I never follow a recipe exactly. I reduced the flour to a half cup and mixed it in with the other dry ingredients. I also added 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1-1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the dry ingredients. I then dipped tomatoes in the cornmeal dredge, eggwash, & cornmeal dredge again. These were a huge hit with everyone and the whole plate disappeared quickly. This will be my new standby.

I found 4 areas to improve.  1:  slice the tomatoes thinner.  Maybe 1/4 inch for a crisper product.  2:  Go with conventional salt.  The course salt gave me a salty crunch occasionally, which detracted from the tomato taste.  3:  The amount of bread crumbs/cornmeal needs to be doubled.  I ran out 1/2 through the process.  4:  List the oil temperature.  My first pan temp was too low so I ran it up to medium heat on my largest  gas burner.  I also made the dipping sauce from Chef John's recipe.  Very good.  Thinking it would also be great for onion rings/petals.

Having finally found green tomatoes, these were delicious!  Crisp yet tender, just a little bite of sour.  Yum.  The photo resembles a battered dip which is also a good idea.  

I made mine gluten free by using cornstarch and GF bread crumbs.  Otherwise, everything else was the same.  Flavorful recipe.

I made these and followed the recipe perfectly. They were excellent! I even made a tangy and creamy dipping sauce out of equal parts mayo and thousand island dressing and a dash of Old Bay seasoning. Delicious! Even my husband who doesn't like tomatoes loved them :-)  Will definitely be making these again!

We absolutely loved this dish...and yes we did sit down with tea and watched the sun set.

The only thing we did different was use corn muffin mix instead of a flour and corn meal mix.

PLEASE READ SO YOU DONT DO WHAT I DID! LOL
 I give them 3 stars but was my fault.  I bought a medium coarse cornmeal and it just wasn't right. Too grainy and hard - so just want to let people know not to make that mistake (especially if you don't have a clue about southern cooking, like me).  Get a fine ground cornmeal. I am from California, I rarely fry things (although I love fried green tomatoes and Southern food = yummmmy). I think I really have to blame myself for this outcome.  When I just used breadcrumbs, omitting my coarse cornmeal, they were very good but the breading did not stick as well once I cut into them to eat.
Thank you for this recipe, I will try it again with a fine cornmeal and try to get back to rate again.

Made it two times in the last two days.  I used whole wheat flour and whole wheat bread crumbs.  Crunchy on the outside, perfectly cooked inside.  Best I ever tasted!

These were very good.    Hubby loved them.  :)  They were easy to make.   I did slice mine about 1/4 inch.  Didn't want them to be too thick.

These fried green tomatoes were a big hit at a Hot Dog cookout for some senior residents in The Woodlands, TX.  I used small green tomatoes and cut them less than 1/2 " thick.    I had no milk so used 2% buttermilk which may have coated them better than milk.  The frying went very quickly because I may have had the oil too hot.  Anyway I will make these again for sure.  I like the suggestions from other people.
Did you see the movie?

I made this pretty much according to the recipe BUT... I had no plain breadcrumbs so I used italian and I had no milk so I used greek yogurt.  I've only just started to fry things, so i was a bit afraid of this, but it came out really well. This is a keeper for us.

My husband raved over these.  Instead of bread crumbs I used cracker crumbs from Ritz crackers I had on hand.  I didn't use near as much oil to fry them in as it called for, but just enough to cover the bottom of my electric skillet.  I've made them twice already, and will definitely make them again when I have green tomatoes.  I think the cornmeal really adds something special to this recipe.

Made these this morning for my parents. They never had them before as they just moved to Texas from Southern California. The only thing I did differently was salt and pepper the tomatoes themselves, cut back on the kosher salt, and added smoked paprika and garlic powder to the cornmeal mixture. The batter stuck perfectly and they fried up nicely. Way better than the ones I had at an Oklahoma restaurant last year. Hard to find green tomatoes at the supermarket, so when these were found at the farmers market yesterday, they were bought. Will be made during the summer as that's when the market is in town. Fantastic recipe

Good recipe.  I agree with others than they should be cooked longer and cut smaller though.   I also salt and pepper the tomatoes themselves.   One tip to get the coating to stick is to bread them well, and then stick them in the fridge for 15 minutes or so to cool.   I've never had the breading come off doing that.    When frying I never deep fry them in that much oil.  My family has always just pan fried them with a bit of oil.  Adding some if necessary towards the end.

I added a little paprika to the dry ingredients for a little extra flavor. Also, make sure to put down A LOT of paper towels for them to drain on or they'll get soggy quickly.

Since I suffer from hypertension (high Blood Pressure) I did not put in any salt.  I live in Cincinnati Ohio (5 years now, live 45 years in SE Ohio (country))and I am a resident/manager of  a sober living group home.   They guys never heard of fried green tomatoes, so I made them.  My mother use to make them all the time.  They guys in the house loved them.

I use bread crumbs with Italian seasoning for a little extra zip. I love making these and even enjoy getting messy during the process. I have made these many, many times, including at my recent giant family reunion full of opinionated foodies from the deep south and everyone is always happy with the resulting yumminess.  This is one of my favorite summer dishes to make every year.

I would definitely make this again. I have never made fried green tomatoes before , nor have I even had one ! My boyfriend and I made these in conjunction with  BLT's .. it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and I used white cornmeal (since it didn't specify which type). I used 3 large green tomatoes and I changed the oil out about halfway thru because it looked burnt.

I love this recipe. I used what I had on hand; Buttermilk, Italian bread crumbs and deep fried them at 365 degrees.

I used red tomatoes for this recipe and they were awesome.  I like mine with green Tabasco Sauce and a cup of ice water.

This turned out beautifully. First time I have made fried green tomatoes and my husband said they were better then anything he's had in a restaurant. I did use canola oil and a bit less in general

Spectacular recipe! I love the maters thick because they don't get mushy after cooking. I used a scant amount of oil in the pan so they were not greasy. I mixed some mayo with cucumber dill and hot sauce to dip them in.

Just finishing my batch, OMG these are AWESOME! I followed the directions, and actually added about 3 teaspoons of The Pampered Chefs Garlic and Herb Rub. Wow!! The coating holds beautifully, and they came out perfectly brown and crispy! Definitely will be using this recipe for ever. Thanks!

I made a few modifications and it delivered the best FGT I've ever had. Replace bread crumbs with Nutritional yeast. Replace milk with buttermilk. Creates better mouth feel and adds a slight pungent flavor. Cook over medium high with grapeseed oil. Nom.

This is the best recipe for fried green tomatoes. I have made them a few times and every time they are great. I changed nothing except I slice the tomatoes a bit thinner (maybe 3/8"). Also, I will only use Panko (Japanese style) bread crumbs.  They always stay crisp.

Wonderful recipe! Made these last night. Such an easy process and they turned out amazing! My mother loves fried green tomatoes and these were her favorite! Made it exactly as the recipe stated, did not alter the ingredients at all. Not soggy one bit, nice and crunchy, I will be making them again with this wonderful recipe

I made this today and my husband loved them! My neighbor gave use 3 beautiful, large green tomatoes so I sliced just one of them (only my husband eats them) and split the ingredients in half except the milk and egg mixture.  Very easy to do and they turned out beautifully.  I will definitely try this recipe again before the end of the summer.

This was so fantastic! I followed the recipe almost to a T with the exception of some tiny suggestions from reviews: omitted the egg yolks (crispier batter), only used 1 and 1/2 tsp of kosher salt, and used 1/2 cup of flour (1 full cup would have been wasteful overkill). I also used Italian style bread crumbs for more enhanced flavor. These were SO delicious and the batter stayed completely in place. I've made fried green tomatoes for years and this is the first time I've ever been successful at not having the batter fall off while they cook. My husband made a simple dip for them too using sour cream, dill weed, dill relish, lemon juice, grated cucumber, and salt and pepper. Seriously the best batch of fried green tomatoes I've ever made! This is a definite keeper for my family (who as tradition makes a batch of these every summer and watches the movie while we eat them). Thank you! :)

Made these last night and LOVED them. I had never had fried green tomatoes before, but everybody but my youngest child loved them. I used seasoned bread crumbs and they addded a nice flavor. I served them with spaghetti. The kids ate all the spaghetti, so I had my tomatoes with sauce over them...I will make these again foresure!

So, this was my first time cooking fried green tomatoes, and it was quite good! I did add 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp paprika to the cornmeal with the salt. I tried slicing them 1/2" thick and 1/4" thick, my husband and I much preferred the thicker tomatoes; the thinner tomatoes got soggy quickly. I did also use this breading recipe on bias-cut 1/4" thick zucchini slices, and it was SO good! Try putting them on a nice, crusty loaf of bread with a little lettuce and cucumber and your favorite salad dressing for a great sandwich.

Pretty bland and the corn meal was to much dry crunch so after trying the first few I remade the flour mix without the corn  meal and added 2 tablespoons of garlic salt and 2 tablespoons of Cajun spice to spice it up and give it more flavor.

I *just* made these and I they were great! I had jumbo eggs so I took out one yolk in order to avoid a weird texture. I used crushed corn flakes for the bread crumbs and I used corn bread mix instead of corn meal because it's all we had. It worked perfectly although I ended up having to make more bread crumb/corn meal mixture because I ran out about 3/4 of the way through. It was probably because I used too much on each slice.  I used melted Crisco shortening for the oil. But they were great! Thank you!

I tried this recipe several days ago. The tomatoes were wonderful! The only things I changed were  using Panko crumbs, peanut oil, and slicing the tomatoes one quarter of an inch thick. Will be using this recipe from now on!

I've never made this before but I loved it and it was delicious!  I followed the advise of others and only used a half a cup of flour.  I also only used the egg whites instead of the whole egg.  This recipe had plenty of flavor and I can't wait to make this again sometime!

Yum! Served with lemon basil mayo (just put a squirt of lemon, few sprigs of basil, into some may in the magic bullet), on toast as a sandwich.

My suggestion to those who feel they are too thick to be tender enough is to put them in the oven after frying them. Set to  350 for 20 minutes or so.

I cut thinner slices, and used Panko instead of bread crumbs, but I admit the recipe is fantastic!

I changed the bread crumbs to "Old Bay Dip and Crisp" seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled them with powdered sugar when they came out. My daughter went out and picked more green tomatoes and said "make more daddy"

I just did this with these revisions: 
• used pre-packaged egg whites & low fat cultured butter milk
• used panko breadcrumbs & yellow cornmeal. 
• in the egg whites, added buttermilk, kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper & garlic powder
• to the flour, added: Lawry's seasoning salt, onion powder, cayenne pepper
•added to the breadcrumbs & cornmeal: Mrs. dash table blend seasoning & lemon pepper 

Fried in Crisco pure vegetable oil. Came out OUTSTANDING.

Tried this recipe but used suggestion of equal parts flour/cornmeal/bread crumbs (although I didn't have  any bread crumbs on hand so I used parmesan/Caesar croutons) and they were awesome. Even my sister, who hates tomatoes, ate 3, will be making these again. Thanks for posting! ??

These were super good, the only issue I had was that there wasn't enough of the breadcrumb mixture for all six tomatoes.  Also it was slightly too salty for my taste so next time I will cut back to 1 tsp.  Other than that they were very crispy, and the thickness of the tomato was perfect.

These are some of the best fried green tomatoes I have ever had.  I sliced the tomatoes a little thinner than the recipe called for (just a preference), and accidentally threw the bread crumbs in with the flour mixture.  I ended up dipping the green tomatoes into the flour/breadcrumb mixture, then egg mixture, then flour/breadcrumb mixture again before putting into hot oil.  They turned out great!

Never made FGT before today but our market had some beautiful green tomatoes and I'd always been curious so I jumped in today.  Recipe was very easy to follow and we gobbled them right up. Husband requested I make these again. Great recipe!

I use egg whites (Thank you Susan) (use 2 eggs whites for every 1 egg) and since I didn't have cornmeal I used Jiffy Cornbread mix. I've tried making FGT before and have never been successful but these came out Awesome!!! My family was way impressed and I will be making these again.

First time making fgt's and this recipe was the right choice! Perfectly crispy and flavorful crust, tender on the inside. Awesome! Will make again for sure. Followed technique exactly, but I did slice the tomatoes only 1/4 inch thick and was able to use the stumps by roughing up the skin with my knife so the coating would stick a bit.  Used green tomatoes from our garden, Panko crumbs, added a little butter to the oil. My kids loved them, especially dipped in ranch!

These were really good.  A keeper recipes. I cut the recipe for two and perhaps my tomatoes were a little large and ran out of the drye batter ingredients.  I liked the slight tucker cut than I used previously.

Previous attempts to fry green tomatoes did not go as well as I hoped, so I went looking for a recipe. This one fits the bill! Only change I made was to cut the tomatoes in 1/4 inch thick slices. Yum!

Very tasty recipe but I modified from the start based on many of the reviews. I subbed buttermilk for milk; Panko for breadcrumbs; peanut oil for vegetable oil and used it sparingly; added some garlic and herbs to the breadcrumb batter for a bit for kick but other than that followed the recipe but I did find it took more crumbs because I had more tomatoes although I had plenty of egg and milk.

I cut the tomatoes roughly about a 1/4". I did a few at 1/2" and they were fine also but they did take a bit longer to cook.
I ran out of the bread crumb recipe early on and had way too much egg left over- that was fine because I made more tomatoes than the recipe called for so I ended up using all the egg by doubling the bread crumb mixture and adding an additional 1/4 cup flour.
I subbed Panko for bread crumbs because in my experience breadcrumbs tend to be more soggy and absorb oil and I wanted these fried tomatoes to be as crispy as possible. I don't use bread crumbs for frying anything.
Several comments mentioned the batter being bland so I added some powdered garlic and Italian herbs.

Not much to this, just dunk in flour, egg mixture, bread crumbs and fry. Yummy!

They were great served with homemade chili!

I really enjoyed making these. Thanks for the recipe!

Don't discard the ends! I chop them up with a little onion and a touch of garlic and dash of lemon juice if you like it, and either do a quick sizzle or a minute or two in the microwave and it makes a great fresh salsa for sprinkling on top. feeling decadent - toss in a taste of EVOO or butter ;-)

Have never made FGT before and this recipe was so great.  I actually did not even following the instructions and put all the dry items together.  I did use garlic breadcrumbs though.  Yummy.

Made these with fresh green tomatoes picked from my daughter's garden. Used 1/2 cup of flour as suggested. These are delicious, crispy, tangy & beautifully encrusted. Some of the best I've ever tasted!

FANTASTIC!!  I had leftover batter and crumbs, so I sliced up some onions and made onion rings.  I'll be using this recipe to fry up everything known to man!  :D  Great recipe.

This is the first time I have ever made these and they came out so good. They had a nice crunch and the coating stayed on well for the most part. I made a few changes though. I didn't have corn meal but i did have a box of Jiffy corn bread mix and I just mixed some of that in instead. I also had almond milk instead of regular milk. I accidentally mixed the corn meal mix with the flour instead of the bread crumbs. I also added some garlic powder to the mix. Despite my changes, these were so tasty! Kind of sour and crunchy and juicy at the same time. I will be making them again!

I thought this was a great recipe.  If you like your fried food really crispy, they you'll like this recipe!  I took other reviewers advice and upped the flavor--I used italian flavored breadcrumbs, and then after mixing that with the cornmeal, I added the salt and petter as directed, but also added garlic powder and onion powder.  I also couldn't find green tomatoes so I just found the least-ripe red tomatoes I could, and it was still a hit.  It was also so easy/fast to make.  After you slice the tomatoes and set up your three dishes (flour, egg mixture, bread crumb mixture) it goes so quickly!

this recipe is awesome - except since I did not have flour AND cornmeal I used a cornbread mix, dipped in egg wash, then flour/cornmeal cornbread mix (with added salt and pepper) and, since I had no breadcrumbs - i used crushed triscuits (i'm sure any flavor would work but I had roasted garlic) - so egg wash to cornbread mix to egg wash to crushed triscuits - so wonderful I mixed leftover coatings for "hushpuppies" - in retrospect some chopped onion in the leftover coatings would have perfected them

These were incredible! They were a little hard but that may have just been because I sliced the tomato to thick.

This is the second time I made these and I think they came out better with the deletion of the milk.  I used two egg whites because I didn't have any milk. Using the whites with out the yolks makes the corn meal/panko crispier.  I just added pepper to the panko mixture without adding salt.  I cut the slices about 1/4" thick.  We both agreed we like my homemade remoulade better than the Boar's Head I used.

This is the best tasting fried green tomatoes I have done and ate.. Even my picky husband tasted it and never stop eating them Incredible!!! I follow the recipe but I did used a small box of corn muffin mix instead of the corn meal and less thicker tomatoes slices since my husband did not want them mushy. fried them to a dark golden brown came out tasty and somewhat a crunch to the first bite but delicious instead of mushy... LOve it already made them twice!!!!

As I read this recipe I thought how ggod the batter would be for fried onion rings. As someone suggested, I used egg whites only. I  eliminated the bread crumbs. I cut the onions 1/2 inch thick, soaked them in ice water for 20 minutes, drained them in a colander and towel-dried them before frying. They come out very crispy and delicious. You could add other seasonings to the cornmeal such as garlic powder and some cayenne. I hope you enjoy these as much as my family does. Have a blessed day .... Betty

The flavor was good but the cornmeal/breadcrumbs fell off the tomatoes. Next time, I will pan fry them the same way I do eggplant. Flour, egg and breadcrumbs only.

EXCELLENT recipe. Next time I'll use a little less salt. The only thing I did differently was use unsweetened yogurt instead of the milk.

My father-in-law was craving some fried green tomatoes 'just like when he was a kid'. I was surprised to hear him say that these were the best he had ever had! Instead of the normal bread crumbs I used Panko bread crumbs and they turned out amazing!

This was the first time I had ever had fried green tomatoes and I did not have a difficult time making them at all. I followed the recipe exactly andI enjoyed these a lot. I really liked them with Ranch dressing:-) I will definately be making these again.

The best FGTs I've ever made! The only change I made was using cornflake crumbs instead of mixing cornmeal and bread crumbs. Yum!

Fabulous! My first time making these. I have always loved them and I was a little scared. The only thing I did differently was, since I don't keeo regular cows milk around very often, (we drink soy milk), I used a few tablespoons of sour cream with the egg and a splash of water. My kids who are 6 and 9 also devoured these!

I prepared these exactly according to the recipe (only cut in half because we did not have or need that many).  I thought they were pretty good, and the baby liked them.  But my husband and older children did not care for them.  I think it was because the tomato turned out to be very sweet and they didn't like the sweet/salty combination.  Thanks!

These were really good. The only thing I can really add to this is that I did prefer mine cut a bit thinner. The thicker ones had just a bit too much bite to them.

I have never had freid green tomatoes before, but I would probably not make them again.  The recipe was right on with the ingredients, and I love the "crispness" from the corn meal, it just was not a flavor I would crave.  I bet these would be good on a BLT

I agree with one of the other reviewers to make the recipe with equal parts of flour, breadcrumbs, and maybe a slight less amount of cornmeal. But that is only because I don't like the texture of the cornmeal, but it gives it good flavor.

These were excellent.  I haven't had fried green tomatoes since I was a kid (my mom made them at least once a week) and these are different than the way my mom made them, but they were still delicious. Make sure the oil is hot before you start frying them.

First time I've ever made these but mom-in-law gave me a bunch of green tomatoes  so figured it was a good way to use them.  Everyone loved them, they were so good served with a little sour cream.  I reduced the salt because I used seasoned bread crumbs and then kept them warm in the oven until serving time.  I served them with chicken chili as a side and they were delish!

I'v never had fried green tomatoes so I didn't know what to expect. It has a neat taste but I'm not sure I personally like it.

Very good! I have been trying to find a recipe that I like for fried green tomatoes for years! Good dipping with ranch dressing or a dijonnaise with horseradish too.

Oh......yummy! I followed the directions to a tee and found I had quite a bit of flour left over. Would use less next time. But the tomatoes came out beautiful. Not soggy and lovely and crisp. Just like my mom made when I was a kid. I will be making these again. Thank you very much.

This is by far the best fried green tomatoe recipe I have tried.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I just used some captians crackers I had in the pantry and they worked great.  I also added some garlic and it was supurb!

This was my first time eating fried green tomatoes so maybe its not this recipe, but there were just okay.  I think you could fry anything in bacon grease and it'd be good.

This was o.k. I grew up eating FGT at the original Whistle Stop Cafe. (The one from the book and movie.) I was looking for something along those lines(no cornmeal based batter). but these were ok.

Used semolina as I did not have corn meal, turned out excellent. Tomatoes were great. Tomatillos also were fun. Thanks for the recipe.

This was the first time I had tried fried green tomatoes.  The breading was nice and held together pretty well, but I didn't care for the tomatoes, personally.

We thought this was great and used up a few of my pre frost harvest.  I did add more salt & pepper afterwards to "season" the top.

Fantastic!  I only had one tomato, so I scaled the recipe back, followed all the directions and enjoyed a fabulous green tomato with a crispy coating of cornmeal and breadcrumbs.  The only addition I made was to use garlic and herb seasoned bread crumbs.  Yummy!
