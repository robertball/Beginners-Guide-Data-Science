My family loved this.  I added a bit of salt and it was a hit.  Not sure what the 1st reviewer was expecting, as their comments were not very helpful.

I made these for my son and he loved them. I did need to add a little salt to the meat mixture -  as the other reviewer mentioned. Thanks for the recipe!
