Okay, this is my third time making this marinade and I've decided no salt is required. With the salt in the soy sauce and steak seasoning there's already plenty. FINALLY I'VE GOT IT JUST RIGHT.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm, this is great!  THIS IS 1ST REVIEW I'm not a rosemary fan, so instead opted for 1/2 T. tarragon and 1/2 T. thyme. I wish I had read the reviews before making, don't get me wrong this has exceptional flavor, but way way way too salty. I could practically feel my ankles swelling. I'm wondering if maybe it should have been 2 teaspoons of salt rather then two tablespoons? With the soy sauce (which is already salty) it was a bit of a salt overkill, but I will definitely make it again, and again and again, just cut back the sodium.

While no marinade will ever compare to using no marinade at all, this one was particularly excellent. Given that the marinade ingredients were very similar to the seasonings Hubs uses for his grilled steaks, I kind of suspected it would be.  I used fresh rosemary rather than dried and eliminated the salt completely. The salt called for was not only unnecessary, but extraordinarily excessive, which is why this recipe falls one star short of perfect.  Otherwise, a rich and flavorful marinade that definitely complemented, rather than overpowered, our steaks.

This was excellent!  I just put dumped the marinade into a Ziploc, put the steak in, sealed and turned every now and then.  I didn't like the idea of pricking the steak because I didn't want to loose ANY juices so I found that marinating over night or at least 8 hours worked great.  I also added some liquid smoke and replaced half of the Worcestershire sauce with red wine, just my personal preference.  However, I don't think the salt and pepper are necessary in the marinade, just add it later after cooking if desired.

Wow these soaked up the marinade and were so good!  Took the advice of other reviewers and left out the salt completely and used low sodium soy sauce.  I added a little brown sugar.  These were great!

Ohhh Boy this one is salty!! Just looking at the recipe and knowing that steak seasoning and soy sauce are both extremely salty I did not add the 2 tbsp of salt listed and it was still way tooo much... and I love my salt.  I am going to try this again since I did like the flavour but I'm going to eliminate the steak seasoning and use low sodium soy.  I think it'll be what I was expecting then.

TERRIBLY SALTY! The steak were tender by marinating, but completely unedible---which is more than disappointing when you're working with steaks that cost 10 bucks a piece. I would also not use rosemary--unless it is pureed. The rosemary was tough like pine needles in this dish.

This was the greatest tasting steak I have had in a long time.  I purchased a T-Bone and only left it merinate for an hour and a half but man it was good.  I did take the advise of others and left out the salt.

This was good.  I would reccomend halfing the salt and adding two tablespoons of brown sugar, whaich would make this recipe a true five star.

Some of the best steaks I've ever had! Because I didn't have steak sauce, I used BBQ sauce - it added an amazing flavor to the steaks. The BBQ sauce must have aided in cutting down the salt that everyone else complained about because I thought they were perfect!

Made for dinner tonight...absolutely delicious.  I reduced the amount of salt (per the advice of other reviewers).  Hubby loved this...and asked me to make again and again.  Thanks for the post.

Way too much salt for us.  Could not give a higher rating because of that and the method of cooking the meat.  For the salt,  I cut back to 1 tsp instead of the 6 tsp (1 Tablespoon = 3 tsps!)   Should have cut out the salt entirely as previous reviews suggested. Also, I appreciate there are many methods that people swear by to cook a steak but prefer to flip a steak during cooking.  Not just cooking one side for 10 minutes then cooking the other for 10...   I work in catering and one chef told me about "molecular gastronomy" and the principle behind turning meat often while cooking it. From what I have been taught if you cook the meat for too long on one side you force the juices right out of the meat.  Watch the meat next time you bbq it on the one side for half the cook time.  You will observe juices collecting on the top portion of the meat - then turn the meat and drop those juices into the bbq.  The idea is to turn the meat before the juices start escaping from it to keep it inside and keep the meat as tender as you can.  I use a timer and turn every couple of minutes.    Used to drive me nuts to see cooks flipping steaks like they had some nervous tick!  Now I see why.

OK, I'm going to give you my secret for perfect steaks time after time. :-) Marinate as directed (the marinade given is a good one minus the salt and reducing the soy sauce to 1/4 cup), but then  cover, and grill steaks over medium-high heat for a total of about 10 minutes for a 1 inch steak for medium-rare, adjusting time according to thickness or to your desired degree of doneness. Grill about 2 minutes on the first side, flip and, watching for flareups, finish cooking for the remaining minutes.

This was great!  Amaris, you should be embarrassed at your rating.  You obviously did not try it.  You just gave it the lowest rating because you have an opinion.  The rating is different than a review.  Your low rating brought this rating down and for what?  Your opinion?  Some of us do not buy "cheaper" meats and love a new flavor.

Oh My Goodness! This was SOOOO Delicious! 10 ++++  Tender, juicy, savory and just absolutely awesome! This steak marinade will be stored in my recipe box ASAP. The only minor change I made was to eliminate the salt called for. Instead I used a teeny pinch of Hawaiian Rock Salt. I also had FRESH rosemary that I used as I always try to use fresh herbs. The aroma is so wonderful and marinade tastes so good I couldn't wait to eat this. I marinated for only 5 hours in a plastic ziplock bag and I am sure it would have been even better if I had let it marinate longer.  I sauteed some "Herbed Mushrooms with White Sauce" and ate this with rice. I was full, happy and satisfied thinking when I will eat this again!!

2 tablespoons of salt was WAY too much.  One teaspoon would have probably been enough.

Excellent.....I made some changes though.  I eliminated the salt completely, used low sodium soy sauce and 25% less sodium montreal seasoning which I only used 2 teaspoons of and I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup, which was plenty.  I also reduced the pepper to a teaspoon and added 2 tbsp brown sugar.  Folllowed everything else exactly.  I marinated the steaks in the morning before work, so they sat about 12 hrs...absolutely delicious!!

This marinade made the juiciest, most wonderful steak house quality ribeyes! Marinated 3 hours simply because that's all I had before the dinner hour, and think it would be even better if marinated overnight. The flavours were subtle, and although I typically prefer to let a good cut of steak stand on its own, I will use this marinade again and again.  I used low sodium soy sauce, omitted the extra salt and pepper, and had no A1 so i substituted a little Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce. The steaks were perfect, no extra s&p needed after serving.

I used this minus the steak sauce as a marinade for NY Strips.  I only had time to marinate for 45 minutes.  It was wonderful!  I usually don't add a lot to a good steak and this was not overpowering. I used the leftovers to make a great steak salad.

Absolutely magnificent; deserves Guy Fieri’s key criteria for meat on TripleD: the meat is tender, full of flavor. I left out the salt completely and halved the soy sauce; used Montreal Steak Seasoning, which already has a lot of salt in it, and marinade them in a Ziplock bag for 20 hours. I suspect that the quality of the cut and how they’re grilled has a lot to do with how well this turned out. I spared no expense on the meat, and my husband is fantastic on the grill. Next time, I’ll use fresh rosemary.

This marinate made the best steak I've ever had.  I did leave out the salt and rosemary as others did and substituted barbecue sauce for the A1, and did not find it salty.  Absolutely delicious--thank you very much for sharing it.

I was really just looking for a marinade and stumbled upon this recipe, it's an EXCELLENT marinade!!  We are beef cattle farmers, and I am always looking for new ways to spice up our top quality meats and this is definitley a winner!  My only difference, I did NOT add the salt as I find that all of the other ingredients have their fair share.  Will definitely use this marinade again and again and again...:)

This was great! I just mixed the seasonings in a bowl, put the steaks in a baking dish, allowed them to marinate in the seasoning for about a half hour in the fridge (that's all I had), and baked the steaks in the oven, in the seasoning. It was great! My hubby told me to save this recipe, he loved it! I did omit the salt and I didn't have any steak seasoning, and it was still good!

This marinade is delicious! I think the fact that the recipe called for steak seasoning could be the problem with all of the complaints about too much salt. I used seasoning without salt and did not have a problem.

It is salty because the ingrediants almost all use salt i.e. Worcestershire, salt, steak seasoning and more steak sauce...don't get me wroong as they are all good but togeather they produce too much salt and...btw anchovies (salt) to boot...but it's a good recipe to start with just add one of the sauces...happy 4th

As recommended, I did not add any of the salt to the recipe.  It was absolutely great.  My family loved it.

For the true steak lover this had too much other than steak flavor and was too salty. Omit the salt when you make the marinade.

Wow.  Let me say it again, wow!  I will preface my review by stating, emphatically, the LTHs have always been firm proponents of "naked" steaks.  We love great red meat and see no need to "sully" it w/extraneous stuff.  However, I've been on a trying new recipes kick and decided to give this a shot w/our first delmonicos from our fresh side of beef.  I followed the recipe to a "T", including the salt (though I did use sea salt as it's all we have/use) and leaving out the steak sauce because it's just not something we buy/use.  Oh, and I halved the recipe for 2 steaks.  Awesome.  Both Mr. LTH and I commented multiple times how great our steaks were (in part to this stellar marinade and in part to Mr. LTH's stellar grilling skills).  The only change I'll make when I use this again (and we WILL be using this again) is to reduce the rosemary because I'm just a rosemary fan and the flavor bordered on predominant.  Many reviewers mention the salt.  As a general rule, I salt each bite of steak as I eat it.  I had no need for the salt shaker w/these; they were seasoned perfectly (I double checked w/Mr. LTH, as he's not a saltaholic, and he confirmed they were just right and not too salty).  THANKS, MACAW06, for showing me there's more to life than "naked" steaks...

Made for the 1st time tonight...DELISH!  I hadn't read any reviews, but by looking at ingredients, ignored the salt and used low sodium soy sauce and it tasted great.  Let it marinade overnight until the next evening and was perfect.  We will put this in our regular rotation. Tender!!!

Used strip loin steak. Replaced the rosemary with Italian seasoning blend and omitted the salt. Tasty, but I think the brand of steak sauce I bought isn't as good as A1 (which was unavailable when I went to the store). A little salty, so I will try cuttng back some of the other salt components.

AMAZING Recipe!!! My husband loved this recipe. I would recommend leaving out the salt because the soy sauce & steak seasoning is enough sodium & added ground red pepper for a kick!!  I also used this marinade on pork chops. Great as well my husband use to love my fried  porkchops were his fav now he only wants them cooked  this way and not to mention its healthier!!!!!

This was great.  Used the Marinade for kabobs.  My husband can't wait to try the same marinade with Chicken.  This made our Memorial Day wonderful.

I followed the advise of many others and didn't add any salt.  I coupled this with the "Grilled Baked Potatos" by Todd Schultz.  Wonderful combination

This was great! Great flavor, easy to make, served to dinner guests & everyone loved it. Omitted salt completely, used reduced sodium soy sauce, was able to marinate for about 8 hours. Cooked on a George Foreman grill for 7 minutes @ medium setting, and my steak came out perfectly medium cooked. (I wasn't able to afford rib eye steaks, and this worked wonderfully on a less expensive cut of beef.) My boyfriend wants me to use this marinade for hamburgers now, too. :) I'm thinking pork chops, chicken....

This recipe has waaay too much salt! I should of read the reviews before I ruined 2 expensive steaks. There was no way I could eat the steak - it was so salty. I'm not sure I would make this again but if I did, I would omit the salt and the steak seasoning, and use only 2 T of soy sauce.

This was great with rib eye steak.  I was only able to marinate it for 3 hours but it was really good!  I followed the advice of others and left out the salt and used low-sodium soy sauce.  This one is a keeper.  I plan on using this on london broil as well.

Most marinades that I use are simpler to prepare, but this one ended up being well worth the effort.   One of  the usual benefits of a marinade is that a cook can get away with using a cheaper cut of meat,  so I thought a true test would be to  try it out on  thick cut sirloin steaks.  They turned out wonderfully tender. I left out the salt and onion,  but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. The steaks marinaded for a little more than 24 hours.  I will definitely be preparing it again, my family can't wait.

Oh man, were these good!!! I am going to be using this all summer! It has all the ingredients I use but never thought to put them all together! I put everything in a gallon bag, added my New York Strips and laid on the counter for 30 minutes to come to room temp (important not to grill cold meat). Grill over direct flame to 130 degrees, take them off, cover with foil and let sit for 5-10 minutes. Even my husband, who doesn't care for marinades, thought they were the best! Thank you, thank you!! P.S. I use flavored olive oil and I do not any additional salt.

Awesome! The best steak we ever tasted.* Thank you for this yummy yummy recipe. This despite the fact that this is my first recipe after subscribing and didn't know to read the review and trusted the salt measurement. Our next try will be even better as too much salt was our only complaint and now we know to read the review first. So MELT in your MOUTH!

I would definately omit all additional salt the next time I make this...   I made this for father's day dinner for my dad, my neighbor & my husband.  The men didn't seem to mind the saltiness of it, the women noticed it was a bit too much.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and only used half the salt the recipe called for, but would adjust for our tastes next time by omitting the salt all together.  Otherwise, was a huge hit and definately gave the delmonicos (I used a prime cut, thick steak) a unique twist.  Was a hit for our dinner party!

Since I dont like ribeyes (nothing but fat). I chose the fillet over it. I have to say that I like to taste the meat but I had to try this "Fork Tender" marinade. Do not waste your time or taste buds on this marinade! A completely dislikeable taste and wasnt fork tender at all. I use salt, pepper, and garlic rubbed on before I grill and it makes it fork tender! too much salt takes the moisture out of steak and with all the salty stuff in this marinade.

I was expecting a phenomenal steak..  Everyone has different tastes and maybe this is just a recipe I did not care for.  After reading the reviews, I lowered the salt.  I cut out the 2 Tbsp of salt and used low sodium soy sauce.   It was still terrible.  This is the first negative review I have ever left for a recipe on AllRecipes.com .  I agree with several reviewers below.  If you do not enjoy the flavor of a good steak you may want to try this recipe.  It is a total waste of a good meat.

Great recipe! Didn't even measure the ingredients, just eyeballed and threw everything in a Ziploc bag. Also added some dijon mustard because I thought it would go well and add a little extra something. Marinated about one hour. These were delicious.

The recipe calls for discarding the marinade before cooking. I found that if I actually rinsed the steak off before cooking it was absolutely wonderful and the meat had absorbed the correct amount of the marinade. If I did not it was too salty (and generally too over flavored).

Holy Moly this way salty! I wanted to eliminate the salt but I ran out of soy sauce after adding only 2 tbs so I only put 1 tbs of salt and it still came out super salty. But...it was still yummy. My 7 yr old son couldn't stop tasting the marinade after we blended it :) will make again only leaving out the salt next time.

I made 1/4 of this recipe yesterday and marinated a huge NY strip steak for about 9-10 hours.  Our steak was close to a pound, but 1/4 of the recipe was plenty of marinade.  Based on other reviewers, I didn’t add any salt, and I used lite soy sauce, but we still thought it was too salty – and we like our salt.  I used fresh rosemary and processed the marinade with my emersion blender, which made this a snap to put together.  I will definitely make this again, omitting the salt again, but I’ll also cut the steak seasoning in half, as it is loaded with salt.  This complimented the flavor of the meat beautifully without overpowering it.

I made several adjustments (per other reviewers recommendations) and while very flavorful, the result was still WAY TOO SALTY!  Griller beware!  I halved the soy sauce, halved the salt, and used only 1 T steak seasoning.  Next time I will use only 1 T soy and omit the additional salt altogether.

I have to say, this marinaded sauce is good to any kind of meat. I didn't have steak, so i used pork chop and it tastes soooo good, but did actually cut half of soy sauce and changed BBQ sauce as A1, cause A1 and Worcestershire sauce would tastes abit same, also i didn't put any salt. Anyway, it turned out really good. Will defintly make it again.

The best marinade ever...definitely let it marinade overnight.  And for those of us with no outdoor cooking space, this does just fine on an indoor electric grill.

The flavor might have been really great if it weren't for the SALT!  Holy cow!  Between the soy sauce and the steak seasoning, it really doesn't need any more.  My husband ate his steak, but mine was basically inedible.

My husband, son and I all LOVED this steak!  Rarely do I find a recipe that all three of us give 5 stars to, but this one is it!  I followed the recipe exactly without modifications, although we did use organic soy sauce and Worcestershire.  Wonderful flavor, very juicy and tender from marinating.  My husband told me over and over again last night how amazing dinner was -- this is how I know it's a big hit!  I will be using this recipe over and over again, thanks!

OMG! This recipe is really great.  I marinated the rib eye steaks for about four hours and then grilled them.  The flavor was absolutely amazing, and the steak was so tender.  Based on other reviews I omitted the salt, but added rosemary garlic salt. Other than that no changes were made.  Thanks so much I will definitely make this again.

These were amazing!  I followed other reviewers' advise and left out the salt - I'm glad I did, they were still a little on the salty side.  Made this with rib-eye steaks as well, and marinated for two nights.  Tender and delicious!

The marinade was ok.  My family liked this, and it cooked pretty well, but it wasn't outstanding.  To give this 5 stars would require me wanting to make it again, and make it for friends/family - and I don't.  Sorry...

This was amazing!  We made it for Father's Day. My husband, son, and father absolutely loved it.  We used reduced-sodium tamari in place of soy sauce (was all we had).  We also eliminated the salt as recommended by other reviews.  My husband, by habit, almost doused his steak when done with A1 sauce when I told him to stop and taste the steak first since it had been marinated over night.  He loved it and didn't use any additional condiments on his steak.  Thank you for sharing.  Will be using this recipe again in the future.

Cut way back on the salt and didn't use the steak sauce because it is not something I normally keep on hand.  Was good, but would probably cut back on the rosemary or leave it out all together. In my opinion, a juicy steak is less about the marinade and more about the cut of the steak - you have got to buy steaks with some marbling - and be sure not to overcook them.  Searing them on a high heat first also helps.

I have made this twice. Both times at work and I was told they were the best steaks they have ever had! They were great and so tender. I could have cut them with cooked angel hair pasta but I used a knife.

i used this as a starting point for 1.75 lbs of bone in pork chops.. i scaled the amount down to two servings.. i was worried it would be too pungent (which is a strange worry for me as i love pungent foods) and too salty so i made the following modifications.. used low sodium soy sauce and only 2 T of it, omitted the salt, pepper, and onion.. reduced the steak seasoning (i used montreal) to 1 T and reduced the steak sauce to 1 T.. i should have halved the garlic bc i felt it over powered just about everything else.. i know you're not supposed to modify everything and then give a rating but i went with my gut feeling and knew this was going to be way too salty/strong like most everyone else complained about

This was absolutely delicious, but my family agrees with many of the other reviews that this is extremely salty. That is the only reason for 4 stars. We will definitely be making it again, but will reduce or eliminate the salt.

I just made this for one one and a half lb. rib eye. I only used one tablespoon of salt due to the amount of meat I had. I didn't have A-1 so I used ketchup.. Talk about delicious!!!!! OMG!!!! YUMMY!!!!

We have steak for dinner 1 night of the race weekend during racing season as one of the racer's provide them for "their" dinner night.  We had some unused steaks from a race weekend and decided to try this marinade recipe.  This is the best marinade my boyfriend and I have used or eaten outside a restaurant-prepared steak.  We made it our own after reading the reviews by deleting the salt and rosemary (personal taste), changing the pepper to 1 teaspoon, adding 2 Tablespoons brown sugar and subbed 3 Tablespoons dried minced onions for the fresh which I let soak in the sauce for 5 minutes before covering the steaks.  They marinated for 6 hours before we cooked them and they were OUTSTANDING!!!!!  We hope to make this the marinade used at the races now too!

I left out the salt, steak seasoning and steak sauce, and cut the soy sauce in half, and this was perfect. Very good marinade for steak.

First time making this recipe. I love it! I read reviews about not adding the salt required. However,  I felt I should of had added to it. I will definitely save this for my future steaks marinades

I almost gave up on my ability to make a great steak, until I came across this recipe (and I’m a prtty good cook). I can say THANK GOODNESS I found it, and in time for a 4th of July weekend, too! I marinated my Angus Rib-Eyes on Saturday night and cooked the steaks on Sunday early evening, so they marinated for nearly 20 hours. I only put ONE TABLESPOON of salt and ONE TABLESPOON of steak sauce (and I cooked 58 oz of steak, while the recipe calls for 40 oz). These were soooooooooooo juicy and beautifully colored (two of the reasons I was going to give up on cooking steaks at home). I pan seared them first, about 3-5 minutes a side, depending on each steak’s size (I was cooking for adults and kids, so sizes varied) and then grilled them (coals completely ashen, low fire) for about 15-20 minutes (medium well, about 170 degrees). Perfect!

I took others' suggestions and left out the salt and the steak seasoning, and used low-sodium soy sauce.  Very tasty with those changes, and I can see how it would be unbearably salty without them!  Made kebabs with peppers - very good on the grill, nice smoky flavor without masking the meat.

This recipe was good because I read previous reviews and omitted the salt. Even without the salt my son thought it was a tad bit salty. I like salty foods so I didn't mind but next time I will use reduced sodium soy sauce. I did use reduced sodium steak seasoning (McCormick's Montreal). Also, I marinated for 3 hours and the flavor definitely soaked through.  I recommend you try this recipe but definitely omit the salt.

Tasted ok, but a bit strong, for my liking.  I mean, you're talking DELMONICO RIB EYE!  They don't NEED marinade!  If you're reading this, and you have say, a regular steak in your fridge, then definitely use this recipe.  I felt this stuff was far too strong for such a fine piece of meat.  My guest quite liked it, but I would have rather cooked the steaks plain, with just a touch of salt.  For cheap cuts, use this.  For the good stuff, go naked.

Major YUM! I had to change the seasonings slightly-1/2 the salt , pepper, & steak seasoning(I have the spicy version), & skipped the rosemary because I detest it:) Excellent!! Def one to make again & again! We ate leftovers on paninis-mmmmmmm.

Some of the best steak I've ever eaten! After reading some of the reviews complaining about the salt I did only add one tablespoon of salt. I did not find it too salty at all. I would not recommend leaving out the salt entirely, it had the perfect amount of flavor.

I love the recipe except for the salt. You can try using a touch of Caribbean seasoning instead. just a touch.

This is an excellent marinade.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and omitted the salt.  I also reduced the black pepper to about 1 and half tablespoons.  It made the ribeyes juicy and did not overpower the taste of the meat.  This will be my go to marinade for steaks.

absolutely delicious. had the steak with a baked potato and asparagus. i definitely took into consideration about not adding the salt and the other reviewers were right. the salt wouldve put it overboard. DO NOT ADD THE SALT! this is absolutely a keeper. good job

This marinade is very tasty.  We use it with a variety of grill meets.  We are not heavy salters, so I do leave out the 2T of salt and I scale back the soy.  We are using this marinade today in fact for our 4th of July BBQ!  Yum!

Used T-Bones and marinated in plastic storage bag for 4 days!.    Tender and ever so flavorful. Very highly recommended for a different steak.

Delicious!  I didn't use the added salt as many commented on the saltiness of the other ingredients already in the recipe and it was perfect  The marinade was tasty without overpowering the steak flavor.

I would give this 5 star because I didn't follow exactly. I didn't add the salt like so many viewers suggested but everything else I followed and it was AMAZING!!!  Thanks for the recipe, no reason to look any further for another one.

SO great... tender and tastey (even cooked medium well to well done). I substituted 1/4 of a 1/4 cup of garlic powder and 1/4 cup dried onions and it was still really good on a t bone! NOTE: skip the salt altogether.

Wow, what a fantastic marinade! After reading several reviews, I decided to leave out the salt and am glad I did.  Also we aren't big pepper fans so I left this out as well since there is plenty in the steak spice and A1 Sauce. With these two adjustments, I would give the recipe five stars.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

As many others did, I omitted the salt completely.  I also substituted the steak seasoning for Montreal steak seasoning.  With those two minor changes, these steaks were fantastic.  Spices and flavor in every bite.  Due to the weather, I even cooked them on an electric grill inside, and they were still tender and delicious!!   I let them marinate overnight (Everything should marinate overnight!!!!)  Very happy with the results!  I'd recommend them to anyone!

This is the best steak marinade I've ever made. In fact, I've made it for every steak I've cooked since I got the recipe. One thing: it makes much more marinade than you need for the amount of steak specified. Use less, it's just as good, plus you can store some for next time. And there's always going to be a next time with this marinade.

Very delicious! This marinade gave the steaks a mouthwatering flavor and smell. I cut way back on the salt(used about 1 teaspoon only) and pepper and left everything else the same. I will try this on other cuts of meat too.

Thanks for this recipe !!!  I took some advice and left out the additional salt. Also, I did not have any steak seasonings so I used Mrs. Dash.  These steaks were very tender, very juicy, and very delicious.  No doubt- we will make this again!

This marinade has single-handedly gave me a reputation of having the best grilled steaks EVER.  This is my go-to recipe for grill marinades - it never fails.  It is complex and very flavorful. I can't say enough about how great this marinade is - I even make up larger-than-needed batch so that I can use the extra for other meat dishes later on.

Wasn't sure what to expect since I don't like onions and this calls for quite a bit, but this recipe is ridiculously delicious.  Definitely way salty enough without any extra salt.  We also hate rosemary and left it out with no problem or detriment. Served on top of white rice, it's the easiest thing to keep in the freezer to pull out the night before. Grilling keeps the house cool in the summer so it's a win win win.  We used a really cheap cut, round steaks, which was tough, but still delicious. UPDATE: Made this with ribeyes (like this recipe really calls for) bought from Costco, and they were seriously out of this world.

Per other reviewers, I used this marinade for a lesser cut of meat (a large chuck roast steak) that was on sale.  I marinated overnight in a ziploc bag.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and left out the salt.  However, I did not have low sodium soy sauce.  The result was a tad salty still, but still edible.  For the steak seasoning I used the Montreal kind which has a decent amount of salt in it as it is.  Overall, I did not like the taste of the marinade even if I took some more steps to reduce the extra salt content/taste.  I really wanted to like this, but I will not attempt again.  Aside from the saltiness, it was a mish-mash of flavor, nothing stand out or good about it.

This is a great recipe, but WAY too much salt! I will use it again for sure, but cut out half the salt if not eliminate it all together. With the soy sauce and steak seasoning, I don't think it needs 2 tbs salt. Maybe this is a typo? Great flavor! I used tri-tip

Served this with Filets instead of Ribeyes and it was by far the best steaks we have ever had.  Added about double the Worshisier as called for, and substituted seasoned salt for the salt it calls for.  Was GREAT!

Wow!  That is all I can say.  Made this for the family and everyone loved it.  Given that there were many reviews that called for less salt, I decided to add four tablespoons of honey.  Perfecto!  Will use this for Ribeyes, T-Bones and Sirloins going forward.

The flavor is SOOO good, the only drawback is the salt. I saw reviews suggesting to skip it, but as a salt lover (I salt hot dogs and potato chips to give you an idea) I thought I would just do the recipe as-written. Way too salty. Other flavors are so good, I'm still giving it a four star and will try it sans salt next time we grill out.

Have made this marinade numerous time and it is delish!  Makes the steaks very flavourful, like you would order in a restaurant.  Have only made the steaks in the oven so far, but can't wait to try it out in the summer on the BBQ.

I just made this for dinner and it was fantastic. I did leave out the salt and it was perfect. My husband only likes tenderloin steaks and after 25 years of marriage I finally got a "Wow this is delicious!) from him on a non tenderloin steak! Thanks for a great recipe, I will use this again and again!

I omitted the 2 tb. of salt and this was still INSANELY salty.  Even if it hadn't been I think the flavor would of overpowered the beef which is what you want to taste when you buy rib-eyes.

I loved this recipe!! I didn't add the salt (not needed), but thats the only change I made. I marinated the steaks for 3 hrs the first time and 24 hrs the second time (the longer the better). It turned out AMAZING! It's better than ANY Steak House!

Good marinade.  I have made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and it was waaaay too salty, and I even used low-sodium soy sauce.  The second time I made it I omitted the salt altogether, and even so it was a little salty for my preference, but still quite good.  One thing I learned from my two experiences is to allow plenty of time to marinate.  I used the exact same cut of meat purchased together both times.  The first time I marinated it nearly 24 hours, and the steaks were nice and tender.  The second time I only allowed about 4 hours, and the steaks were definitely tougher.  We just purchased a grill and so grilling steaks is new to us.  I will probably keep searching for a marinade that we totally love and can give 5 stars.

My steaks turned out good and I had good reviews from the family. However, I didn't read down the comments in time to omit the salt. With all the other ingredients containing salt there was NO need for 2 TBS salt. Would recommend little or no salt be added. Overall very tasty without being overpowering.

I cut out the salt completely.  With the worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, AND seasoning, that's plenty of salt!  I also used only 2 tsp pepper.  I had no steak sauce and subbed BBQ sauce instead.  And for some reason when I was writing this down I forgot the onion and rosemary.  Ooops!  Still turned out fine though.  I added 1 tsp each of dried basil, parsley, and thyme.

Okay, I left out the salt and pepper because so many of the reviews said it was salty.  The steak seasoning I used was Montreal.  Halfway through making the marinade, I realized I didn't have enough rosemary so used basil and thyme to make up the difference.  I only marinated my london broil for 2 1/2 hours, but it turned out delicious!  I cooked the remaining marinade in a pan on the stove and we poured it over our steak and rice.  This marinade is truly amazing (surprisingly, I think the rosemary-basil-thyme made it even better), probably one of the best things I've found on Allrecipes.  I'll be writing this recipe in my favorite recipes book too.

A big hit in our family.  I followed the recipe exactly, marinated about 4 hours.  And was promptly requested by the steak lovers of the household to not change a thing and to make them please, please, please for Father's Day this year.  I served them with baked potatoes and grilled corn on the cob.

This recipe is great!!! As a steak lover I thought the marinade was wonderful. I DID leave out the salt and added a bit more onion and garlic to the blend. YUM!!! You can actually use this marinade on any type of steak. I bet it would be phenom on a flank steak!!!

I loved this.  The marinade was easy to make, I just dumped everything in the food processor whole and ground it up for a minute or so.  I thought it looked unusual but it smelled great.  Covered it and left in the fridge for 12 hours.  After dinner we talked about how we could eat this every day!  Next time I will try with a more tender cut of meat.

I've scaled this recipe up a couple of times for parties and it has come out great. To make it a little more affordable I used sirloin. Both times I got many requests for the recipe and I was told by some this was the best steak they ever had. Some opportunities for improvement: the soy sauce and steak seasoning has plenty of salt so don't add anymore. I also used 2/3 the garlic because people would be talking to each other and there is more than enough flavor.

Excellent!  I took the advice of some and omitted the salt, but kept everything else the same.  Will definitely make again.

We enjoyed this steak marinade. I didn't add any salt to it, or steak seasoning, as I was afraid of too much salt.  We just added our own salt and pepper after grilling, that worked out well.  I would use this marinade again.

This recipe sound similar to the one Ive been using for @ 20yrs. I use a whole bulb of roasted garlic & 3tbls. of roasted garlic teriyaki sauce,instead of the soy sauce. I also use thyme instead of rosemary. Anyway i tried this one &it is VERY,VERY GOOD. Either way you wont be disappointed

Best steaks I ever grilled. Yum! I ommited the salt, used low sodium soy sauce (that's all I ever use), and used Mrs. Dash instead of steak seasoning. Thanks!

This marinade was WAY too salty.  I will try this again though because I think if you omitted the extra salt and used low-sodium soy sauce then the ribeye would have a good flavor.

This is my favorite marinade now. I was a little iffy on it with the mixed reviews but tried it anyway. This is awesome! My husband loved it. We used T-bone steaks and Montreal seasoning. The only thing I did change was cut the salt and soy sauce in half. This is very delicious and soaks into the meat so well. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this marinade tonight for a bunch of friends and everyone loved it.  I made it for 6, so increased all of the ingredients, which made me end up with SO much extra.  I probably didn't need to do that.  Also, I heeded the salt warning from previous reviewers and eliminated the salt and the steak seasoning all together.  I added 3 tbsp of brown sugar and 1/4 c. of BBQ sauce to sweeten it up a bit - it was a HUGE hit.  I'll definitely make this again!

I used low-sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt (Wow, really? 2 Tablespoons???)since the main ingredient in my steak seasoning was salt.  I even cut back on the amount of that too.  I'm giving 4* based only on my tweeking.

I was wary of trying this on an $$$$ steak, so tried it with porkchops scaled back to 1 serving. What a great flavor! We had both strip steaks (unmarinated) and pork chops on the grill and the marinated chops were far and away my favorite!*edit* I didn't use the salt that is called for. Didn't miss it!

Almost wonderful. My only issue with this recipe is that it is very salty. I used low sodium soy and omitted the extra salt, but for some reason or another it was still salty. Possibly my steak seasoning? Definitely taste before you add the extra salt!

Well, after ready all the other comments, I did not add any salt, and marinated in a sealed ziplock bag for about 5 hours. Steaks turned out wonderfully juicy and flavorful. Only thing I will do differantly next time is not walk away from grill...the marinade caught fire on one of the steaks, so one side was black, but steak was cooked perfectly other than that. Awesome!!

I used cheaper ball tip steaks, but they still came out so tender you could literally cut them with a fork! For the steak seasoning I used “Montreal”, and I seared the steaks in a hot cast iron pan and then popped them under the broiler for a few minutes until they were about 145 degrees. They coasted up to 150 degrees while standing. The only thing I would change is to omit the salt next time. I love salt on steak but these were a little too salty even for me. I think the steaks probably get enough salt from the soy and Worcestershire sauces anyway. Otherwise excellent flavor and I’m sure with a little less salt this will be a great marinade I’ll use a lot.

This was delicious! We didn't add the additional salt and it was perfect.  Please note as another review said, the steak does not maintain its "meat" flavor, but still sooooo juicy.

This marinade is absolutely delicious and flavorful.  I have tried this on a variety of steaks, and they all turned out juicy and tender.  I always have to make extra, as the steaks go fast.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It will definately go in my recipe box.

I loved this marinade. I changed a few things...didnt add the salt, used dried onions instead of a real one and replaced the rosemary seasoning for minced ginger, and it was GREAT. Also, I used this marinade in the slow cooker with pork chops, just added a little terriyaki marinade and they were absolutely to die for!!

Had a very nice flavor, but way too much salt.  Need to cut it out, but not sure how to do that while keeping its amazing flavor.  Would definately make again, just a little differently.

I used the marinade on kabobs on it was okay. I was not terribly impressed but my boyfriend said he really liked it. I have been searching for the perfect marinade..this was a little heavier than I am wanting. However, very easy to make. Don't worry about chopping the garlic or onions if you are using a food processor or blender, it will do the work for you.

This was GOOD!  I didn't chop the onions or mince the garlic, just put everything into my mini-processor and gave it a whirl.  Cut down a bit on the salt, and left out the steak sauce.  I only had time to marinate the steaks for maybe 2 hours and they turned out awesome.  Served with dinner rolls and grilled white corn on the cob.  Keeper.

This was very good!  The only changes that I made was that I didn't have any steak sauce, & I used Montreal Steak seasoning (a little spicy).  I used it to marinade a couple of chuck steaks, which are known to be a little tough, but not with this marinade!  I will definitely use this again!!

This is the first time I have made a marinade from scratch.  Awesome recipe!  One of our friends is watching his sodium intake so I made a few revisions...eliminated extra salt and used Ms. Dash instead of steak seasoning.  The steaks were sooo flavorful, and I only marinated for 3.5 hours!  This is definitely a keeper!

Made the steak with butchers cut rib eye steaks and was extremely tender. I kept the salt and loved it. The salt gives it a great added touch but I can see where people might find it salty. Either way award winning recipe.

This was very tasty.  I did what others suggested and eliminated the salt.   While I love rosemary, I am not fond of it with beef, so I substituted oregano.  The steaks were very tender and tasty.

This is the BEST steak I have ever eaten!  I was sort of leary about it at first, because some recipes taste good to some, while others leaves a lot to be desired..........but this one is the BEST ONE EVER!!!  You won't go wrong, but I did take the advise of the others and cut down on the salt.  I also added some Kitchen Bouquet.  But it was still WONDERFUL and the steaks were amazingly tender.

This is some of the best steak marinade I have ever made!!! The only thing I did was reduce the salt drastically, and also reduced the soy sauce. I used filet mignon steaks instead of ribeyes. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't use any steak sauce or onions because I didn't have any at the time.

Two words... UN BELIEVABLE!!! It wouldn't matter if you marinated intestines in this stuff - it would still taste like perfection. I can honestly say I've never eaten a steak with my fingers, but it just took too long to cut it with a knife and fork. Hands down the best thing I've ever tasted. My husband did cut the salt down to 2 tsp - may have been a mistake in the recipe calling for 2 Tbsp. Will definitely use this for every cut of steak and chicken too. You ROCK Macaw06!!! You made my summer!

This recipe was ok, but not great. I thought the marinade overpowered the steaks a little too much. I gave it three stars because a couple of people said they liked it, but I really didn't care for it. Sorry.

My husband said, "this is the new recipe anytime we have have steak." Really good. I also left out all the salt. Soy sauce is plenty salty already. Only marinated the steaks about 30 minutes (I can never plan ahead that far) and they were still great. I'm sure marinating for the full amount of time would produce awesome steaks.

When I made this recipe I was concerned about the amount of salt in it so I decreased the salt from two tablespoons to two teaspoons.  It was still so salty my family could not eat it.  Can't even imagine it with two tablespoons of salt.  I certainly won't make this recipe again.

I am not a steak person, so this recipe is wonderful to me!  I really liked it and the steak came out very tender, had to cook in oven as it was raining, but still very flavorful and tender.

OH MY GOSH! This tastes just awesome!  It was too salty for me, so next time I will reduce the amount, and maybe even eliminate it altogether. I used "Famous Dave's" Steak and Burger seasoning, which has quite a bit of salt in it already, plus the steak sauce and worcestershire sauce have salt too. It's vadalia onion season here, which gave the marinade a bit of sweetness. yum. My husband just had the last steak for lunch today and said it tastes even better the day after.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Was way too salty.   The "2 TB of salt" was too much, considering the salt in the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce.

I had planned for this for Father's Day, after a short 4 hrs to marinate. It developed into a much delayed dinner. Ended up in marinade for 48hrs+. We both agreed, it was the best. Excellent. The steaks were so tender & flavorful, we can't stop talking about how great it was. Thank you for posting. YUM!!

Wow! Can’t wait to make again. I was feeling lazy and didn’t want to clean my food processor so I just chopped my onions super fine and put all ingredients in a plastic container and marinated for 24-hours. My husband hates marinades on steak but always orders the Delmonico at our fancy steak restaurant so was really happy that he loved my “at home” version.

This was good, but I left out the steak seasoning and the salt.  I could not justify the salt and steak seasoning along with the soy sauce and steak sauce . . . talk about a sodium overload.  Could that possibly be a typo?  Since I wanted to make a marinade, not a rub, that's what I went with.  I did add a bit of Mrs. Dash--no salt in that--and this steak was enjoyed by all, including my 3 1/2 year old.  We used some of it in fajitas, and that was delicious.   I'm making again this week.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family’s favorite steak Marinade. I use on NY strip or petite sirloin too. Even chicken. I Do NOT add the salt. Sometimes I broil in the oven. I usually use powdered rosemary ( about half as much as called for) using crushed rosemary is more like chewing pine needles to me . Low sodium soy sauce works great too!

Made this marinade for the first time for family company.  Exceptional taste! 
When I make this again, I will reduce the salt.  I doubled the recipe, but only added less than one tablespoon salt.  The steak seasoning I used was the Canadian Steak Seasoning, and I feel that has a good bit of salt in it as well.  
But this was out of this world.  I only had a little less than 3 hours to marinate, but it worked out very well.

Cooking this steak for 10 minutes per side will ruin it and turn it to charcoal.  Depending on thickness 4 to 5 minutes per side will bring it to medium rare which is what you want to achieve.  The steak will be way too salty so I wouldn't marinate it for more than 1 hour with soy and olive oil only. Serve with brandy flambed Portobello mushrooms sauteed in butter and olive oil.

I followed this recipe for our Fourth of July cookout! They marinated for 24 hours and were tender and flavorful. Will definitely make again!

First things first. A marinade is not a topping or a seasoning you cook with the steak. It is to be discarded. The marinade on the steak should be rinsed dried with paper towels THEN broil it.  It is tender delicious and NOT salty.  This was excellent and I marinated it for a full 24 hours. Stop using the marinade as a cooking item and you will get a delicious broiled (rare-medium) steak you will be proud of.

This is my most favorite steak marinade out of several that I've tried, and I almost never use anything else now! This one has all the right flavors for me.

The first time I made this recipe, it was really good. But like several other reviewers said, it's already very salty from the steak seasoning and soy sauce. I have left out the salt every time since then.

That said, I've made this marinade at least a dozen times since I found it a couple of years ago. As good as the original is, I have tweaked the amounts of a few of the ingredients.

I use 1 1/2 T McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning, about 2-3 T of A1 sauce (this is the only thing I ever use A1 for!!), 2 T dried rosemary, several large cloves of garlic (I don't measure it), and one whole medium yellow onion. I keep the oil, Worcestershire, and soy the same.

This always delivers a tender, very juicy steak that gets nice grill marks, even on my electric grill! I made this tonight for some 1" New York strips, marinated them for 2 hours (that's all I had time for),  and cooked them medium-rare. PERFECTION!! Thank you so much for a great recipe!

Very sorry but my family and I did not like this marinade. I added no salt and used low-sodium soy sauce and this was still ridiculously salty...also, way too much olive oil.

Wish I would have read the reviews before I made this.  It was definitely way too salty, but the overall taste was delicious.  I will definitely try this again without the salt and maybe adding some brown sugar.  It is a good marinade, it just needs adjusted a little.

This is such a great recipe. The steak seasoning I use has salt in it so no extra salt is needed. Be careful on adding the salt the soy sauce adds a lot of salt as well.

I pared this recipe down to 2 servings and out of necessity, had to change it a little bit...I didn't have steak seasoning, so instead, I added 1 Tbsp of Lawry's seasoned salt, 1 Tbsp of garlic powder, 1 Tbsp onion powder (still added fresh garlic and onion that it asked for as well).  We ended up letting it marinate for over 24 hours...more like 31 hours, so I'm sure that made it even yummier :-)  Even before the hubby had the steak, he kept commenting on how good the marinade was, and he absolutely loved the end product.  Thisis the second time I've made this (the first time I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have a food processor at the time, so everything wasn't well blended and it ended up just tasting "ok") We will definitely make this again - blended, definitely!!

I cut the recipe in half (only cooking 2 steaks), ommitted the extra salt and pepper and substituted bbq sauce for the steak sauce. The marinade had a good flavor and the steaks came out tender and juicy. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the marinade overpowers the flavor of the steak itself. I will make it again, but I won't use as much marinade/marinate it for as long as I did (I made it this morning and cooked when I got home from work).

Delicious!  Keep in mind that 10 min/side may be WAY overkill depending on your cut of meat - the Delmonico's available at my local store weren't very thick, so about 4-5 min/side on a grill set to 450 was perfect to give me steaks that were still a little pink in the middle.

This marinade was pretty good. But I think if you used the full 2 tablespoons of salt called for it could end up being a disaster. I eliminated the salt all together since worcestershire and soy sauce is plenty salty on their own. I did, however, use low sodium for those also. I would have used fresh rosemary if my herbs had come in yet because I think fresh is always best but I did use crushed and I didn't have the full amount of steak seasoning, maybe 1 teaspoon is what I had and used. Marinated for a good four hours and grilled over a charcoal grill for better flavor. This was good but not the best marinade I've had.

This one is a keeper!  
I don't usually like Rosemary so I almost didn't make this marinade.  Boy am I glad I did!  The flavor is amazing.  The steaks turned out wonderfully tender with the perfect flavor.  I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the salt.  I also halved the soy sauce. I didn't have steak seasoning so I used some garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added 1 tbs brown sugar.  I read one comment about the rosemary being "like pine needles"- I think they missed the fact that you are supposed to crush it up first.  Try this marinade - it is amazing!

This recipe is awesome.  I use it monthly for our steaks.  I thought the recipe as written was a little salty for my taste so I now use light soy sauce and omit the extra salt.  I use Grill Mates (McCormick's) steak seasoning which has salt in it....which might be why I thought it was salty when I tried it the first time.  Thanks for a great recipe  Hubby wants his steaks cooked this way everytime now.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I have ruined so many steaks, you would not believe the casualty count!  Using this recipe, I made my first non-ruined steaks, and they were beyond delicious!!!  

I did modify the recipe slightly:  

--I left out the salt
--I only marinated the meat for 1 hour at room temperature
--I cooked the steaks for only 5 minutes per side

Next time I might try overnight.  (I personally thought it could use a little bit less salt, but my family said it was perfect and don't change a thing.)  I don't know why the big difference in cooking time, but more 5 minutes per side made them a perfect medium, just the right amount of pink in the middle.  

Making it again tonight and I can't wait till it's ready to eat.  

Thank you for redeeming my steak-grilling reputation!!!  I am hailed by family and friends as an excellent cook and baker, but with steaks I was horrible.  I now have my confidence back!  :)

This is the best steak marinade, bar none, that I have ever used. I usually prefer my steaks without any adornment, but this recipe has converted me. BUT . . . do NOT use the salt called for. You don't need even a pinch of salt in this recipe due to the addition of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce, both of which are quite salty all on their own (which is why I use the low sodium version of both sauces).
I have used this marinade on many types of steak, all turned out juicy, tender and super delicious (as long as you leave out that salt!) lol

This is a great marinade recipe.  It has quite a lot of ingredients, but using a blender helps speed things up.  I prefer to use HP Sauce rather than steak sauce, which is a little too vinegary for me.

I used one third of the salt but all the salt would have been fine. These are fantastic!  The marinade looks like breading when you put it on the grill.  Highly recommended.

Very easy to make and my family really liked this. I did not pierce the steaks as they were fairly thin and I didn't want the juices to run out when they were barbecued. thanks!

Excellent marinade.  I made the recipe as written, except I left out the salt.  I must say, however, that we all lightly salted our steaks after tasting...so next time I will add the salt to the marinade.  I marinated our steaks for 4 hours.  Delicious!  I will definitely use this again.  Very "steakhouse" flavor.  No one at the table used any dipping condiments...and that's saying something!

My husband, teenager and I loved it.  I only used about 3 grinds of salt--it's just how we roll in our household.  I used White Worcestershire as that is what I had on hand and did not have any steak sauce and it still came out wonderful. I only had 1 1/2 hours for marinating so I just flipped the steaks once in while for good coverage. I used a grill pan in the house (our bbq is broke)  I will definitely make again.   THANK YOU

First of all, as written, this recipe is way too salty.  But that's an easy fix!  Just omit the salt and this recipe is a winner!  We us this marinade on tri-tip roasts, one of our favorites!  Just be sure to 'prick' the tri-tip a lot to get the flavor inside and if you can leave it in the marinade a bit longer, it's that much better.  It's great sliced and used for tri-tip sandwiches, yummy!

This is an excellent marinade but I did change it somewhat. I followed others advice and left out the salt & pepper since we usually add our own at mealtime. We didn't need to add salt, it was perfect. I also didn't have rosemary so that didn't get added. I only added 1 tablespoon of steak seasoning. Next time I make this I will increase it to 2 and will add some brown sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke. I marinaded the meat for 12 hours before cooking. The steaks were so tender. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.

I LOVED this recipe and would recommend and make again!!!  My only suggestion would be next time I make since all of the ingredients combined have so much salt I would omit at least one tablespoon of salt or the salt altogether especially since the steak seasoning already has salt in it.  And I like salt and would be fine with making this change next time.

Good recipe but I followed the advice of other reviewers and did not add the salt content and was very happy I didn't as it was salty enough.  Any more salt, and I'd feel my ankles swell.  LEAVE OUT THE SALT!  Bon appetite!

Definitely the most tender and delicious recipe for steak. I didn't use salt and pepper. Followed the rest of the ingredients exactly, lightly pricked the meat with a fork and marinated 3 hours. Cooked medium rare and it was still juicy.

Tried this last night and it was AMAZING. Me and my boyfriend both agree- best steak we've made YET! Although I did alter the recipe a bit. I was out of minced garlic so opted for Garlic Powder with Parsley instead (also added a little extra since we LOVE garlic). My boyfriend hates onions so I left them out. I'll be trying this again with the minced garlic but I think the garlic powder gave it a better taste. :)

Such delicious flavors that complement a steak so well! I halved this recipe and left out the salt, pepper & onion, mixed it all up in a bowl and marinated 3 filet mignon for about 30 mins. I saved a little marinade and while it was grilling, kept basting the steaks with it. The flavor was great and the steak melted in my mouth. Even my 2 year old had some, he never eats steak! I will try it with a rib eye next time and marinate longer. Thanks!

I should have read the reviews before making. Extremely salty is putting it mildly. Cut out the salt and it probably would have been delicious.

We used this recipe with some organic steaks we had, and it worked very well.  It seasoned the steaks nicely and there wasn't a gamey taste.  This is definitely a keeper.  We used the full amount of salt and it was fine for us. Even my husband who doesn't normally salt his food thought it was great.

This is a great marinade! The only thing I changed was to leave out the 2 tablespoons of salt. I put everything in the Magic Bullet and blended it up for about 30 seconds. I only had about 2 hours to marinate but it still turned out wonderful! I will definitely make again!

The only thing I find wrong with this recipe is the salt content of the maranade makes the steak to salty. For anyone with high blood pressure or heart problems it is a killer. The soy sauce is a salty item and the amount in the recipe is not needed and then again to add more salt makes it way beyond enjoyable.

I loved how simple this was to measure out real quick and throw in the blender. I marinaded the steaks overnight with this mixture, and grilled for dinner the next day. It's one of the first times I have actually wanted to eat my steak without any sauce or anything...it was fantastic!! We will be using this recipe for our steaks again, soon!

This would be a 5 star recipe if it weren't for the salt. Lucky for me I read the reviews first and cut the salt out completely and used low sodium soy sauce. I have also substituted the soy sauce for root beer and the taste is the same without the saltiness.

This is one of the best steak marinades I've ever had.  Too salty...well...yes- I will reduce the salt next time.  HOWEVER, although the marinade tasted very salty, the steaks tasted PEFECT.  I watered down the unused marinade and reduced it and used it as sauce for the steak.  I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe, and used a blender.  I don't know what it is that makes it happens, but this marinade seemed to infuse my (2 inch) steaks like no other marinade!  I will definitely make this again!  I used montreal steak season for that ingredient.

This marinade is wonderful - I didn't use as much salt as called for in the recipe.  I had it for a birthday dinner rather than going out and was told it was "Steakhouse Good".  I used NY Strip, but wonder how it would do on a cheaper cut.

I haven't even eaten the steaks yet but so far, the taste of the marinade is amazing.  I used minimal salt and used low sodium soy sauce. I LOVE IT. I made an extra batch of sauce to put on top of the steaks when they are done cooking.  LOVE IT!!!  I'll review it again after I actually eat the steaks.   :::::::::::::::::::Updated Review:  I simply love this recipe. I use the marinade for chicken, steak and pork as well as a side dipping sauce for any meal but especially for fondue. There is nothing bad I could say about this recipe and I couldn't think about any changes that were needed. It is very robust so beware if you are more comfortable on the blander side of thing.   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Tonight I ran out of rosemary so I substitued thyme and the recipe came out just as great.

Delicious recipe, but do cut down on the salt.  Omit the two tablespoons and use low sodium soy sauce.  Great other than that.

The marinade was awesome! I also used a bit less salt, per other reviewer's, but the flavor was so good and everyone raved!

This is a great recipe.I didn't have an onion,so I just used dried minced onion(about a tbs.),and I used the Montreal Steak Spice that has no salt added,so I didn't find it too salty at all.It tasted great,if anything,I would go a little easier on the pepper next time,but if you like a little spice,it's perfect!

Wow!!  This is one of the better recipes I have come across for steak marinades.  Once these hit the plate, you can leave the A-1 sauce in the fridge because you will not need it.  I added a few extra fresh herbs in the mix to kind of counter the saltiness and also just for fun.  I made some grilled shrimp to go with the steaks, and it turned out to be an amazing dinner.

Pretty good Marinade. I only rated it a 4 since it was extremely salty. I cut the amount of salt suggested in 1/2. Next time I will not add any salt. I also used unseasoned meat tenderizer since I didn't have hours to marinate my round steaks. With the tenderizer I only marinated it for about 1/2 hour and the meat definitely absorbed the marinade in that short period of time.

We  really enjoyed this marinade.  Used it on sirloin as the rib-eyes at our store didn't look too good which is odd because they are usually great there. I did only use 1/2 tsp. salt as most of the ingredients are already loaded with salt and onlt one tsp. black pepper. My only other change next time will be to marinade them longer for a deeper flavor.  I marinaded for about 6 hours next time I'll try 10 -overnight.  Also, I like that it all goes in the food processor, I think it really blends the flavors well!  Thanks for the recipe.  We love it.

Made these last night. Our oven has been out of commission for 2 months so I did it on my indoor grill. This was great! I have been using my grill to cook everything and this was hubby's favorite bar none. Thank you!

Anyone who does not like this recipe has not made it properly! (Having a good piece of meat helps - rib eyes are not fatty if they are good pieces of steak.) When we first made the marinade, we were a little unsure because it does have a strong smell. But this was one of the best dinners we have ever had! The marinade and the steaks were very tasty, tender and perfect. We will definitely be making this again!

This marinade had a very STRONG flavor, but I loved it.  We marinaded a slab of beef filet all day and roasted in the oven until medium rare temperature.  it was FANTASTIC.  I also ommitted the salt and added a touch of hot sauce.

It's a nice marinade, but it really over powers the taste of the meat.  I let it marinade for 5 hours.  Maybe next time I'll reduce it to one hour.

This was so easy to toss together and it made the steaks moist and juicy.  We live in Wisconsin and it is only 18 degrees out tonight, so I was hoping that this was worth braving the cold for.  It is definitly our new marinade.  Thanks for posting it!

I have tried many marinade recipes before and I didn't like them all, BUT this one is so special, my bf and I love it so much and he begs for more !!!! The steak was super tender and juicy, it melted in my mouth mmmmmmm.... I omitted steak sauce as I didn't have any and only added a lil pinch of salt.. I strongly recomended this recipe... Thank you so much for sharing :)

I made this a few months ago when it was still warm enough to grill outside.  The steaks were fantastic.  I did cut back on the salt, used a reduced sodium soy sauce and Mrs. Dash Mesquite steak seasoning.  The flavor of the steaks was great.  I can't wait to have them again!

I always have to double up on ingredients like garlic, worchestershire, etc., because I find the majority of recipes to be bland. This marinade is AWESOME,as is. i don't find it to be too salty at all. I think it just actually flavors the meat the way a marinade should.

These were just okay to me. They were juicy, but the flavor was just too much. I think i'm more into simple steak, just on the grill with a little salt,pepper, and garlic. I think if you're into marinated steak, that this is for you, but for me, I couldn't taste my steak, just marinade.

These were very good, seasoned so much that you do not even need steak sauce when eating. I did not think that they moistened the steak up however and I left the salt out all together because I know it can toughen steak. Of course it could be because we cooked the steaks on the grill. Despite this we will definately make them again with all different cuts of meat!

I made this marinade for my husband and he said it was the best steak he ever had. I only used 1 tblsp of salt and I  used moose steak.

Yum!!  This marinade was fantastic!  I used fresh rosemary instead of dried, but followed everything else with great results.  I loved throwing the whole recipe in the blender; it saved on finely chopping and it whipped the oil in to almost a foam that soaked in the steaks great.  Definitely a keeper.

I cut the recipe in half and used a 2 lb. london broil-terrific!  I used a little less salt and lite soy sauce, otherwise wouldn't change a thing!

I thought this recipe was delicious. I just made a few changes...

I did cut down on the salt since the soy sauce has a ton of salt already and the grill seasoning I use has salt also.

I did not have steak sauce so I substituted ketchup.

Lastly I used sirloin steaks, but upon opening the package it wasn't the best sirloin I've ever bought and i thought it could really use some tenderizing, so I added a splash of lemon juice for the acidity to tenderize. I didn't taste the lemon juice at all and in fact after testing it I added another splash just to be on the safe side. I don't think it affected the taste at all.

I marinated the steaks overnight, threw them on the grill the next day. Everyone loved them. The marinade was just enought to season and tenderize without overpowering.

The steaks were very good (I marinated them overnight), but next time I'll eliminate the steak sauce.  It over-powered the rest of the marinade.

The marinade was good, but it took the steak flavor out of the steak. 
Which was different for us.

Our first grilling of the season... yum!! Take others' advice and cut back on the salt.  We omitted it altogether, and didn't miss it.

I made this recipe tonight and I thought it was good.  I omitted the salt because of the sodium in the Worcestershire and the soy plus the salt present in the Montreal Steak Spice.  I did enjoy it a lot and my steaks were tender.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll make it again.

I made this last night and just couldn't believe how awesome the steak tasted!  The best steak marinade I've ever had!  The cook (husband) way overcooked the steak, I like mine rare and it was well done, but it was great anyway because of the marinade.

I made this steak for my wife on Mothers Day and we both loved it!  I cooked the steak rare and served it over top of pasta with Bechamel sauce , and with Martini and Rossi champagne to drink.  The tastes complimented eachother very well.  Great Recipe!

This recipe is a keeper! Everyone in my family loved it. We did cut the salt back to 1-2 tsp. I also didn't have steak seasoning so I eliminated that. I only had time to marinate 2 hrs. It still turned out wonderful. I had leftovers the next day thinly sliced on a salad for lunch. Yummy!

Had good taste but was too salty. I used half of what the recipe ask to use for salt and it still had to much between the soy sauce and other ingredients.

My hubby made this for my birthday and it ROCKED!  A lot cheaper and better than any other steaks we have eaten at any other restaurant!  If you aren't big on salt, then I would advise cutting it down a little, but we weren't really bothered by it. A definite keeper!  THANKS:)

I made this recipe for my husband and my mum and dad. I came home for lunch and prepared the marinade and covered the steaks. I followed the recipe exactly but did not have any steak sauce so I omitted it. It was absolutely delicious and the aroma was fantastic! I will definitely recommend this recipe to my friends.
