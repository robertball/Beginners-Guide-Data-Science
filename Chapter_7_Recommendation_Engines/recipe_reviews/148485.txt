I made this for my first time hosting Thanksgiving.  Parents, boyfriend, and friends LOVED it.  Definitely make the challah from scratch if you have time (I use the Michell Jenny's Challah recipe on this site). Excellent!  Thanks!

It was a little too doughy following the recipe exactly.  Next time I will use more vegetables and less bread.     I cooked half of the stuffing inside the turkey, and half was baked as recommended in the recipe for our vegetarian friends.  Both turned out great.
