I really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the sauce (did the white wine version) and added 2 tsps minced garlic and 1/2 tsp ground ginger to the veggies (personal preference).  The veggies I used: broccoli, carrots, peas, celery, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts.  I always have to cook water chestnuts a little longer than recipes state - I still like them crispy, but they need a little extra time imo. I also let it all simmer together for a few minutes at the end.  The sauce was thick and flavorful!

I love this recipe!  Super fast.  I made my own few adjustments though: I seasoned the meat before cutting it up and soaking it for about 5 minutes in soy sauce (only 5 tblspoons), sugar, water, red pepper flakes, and garlic. I then took the meat out of the sauce, added the cornstarch (only 1 tblspoon), then cooked the meat in half of the sauce.  I then added my veggies (used the frozen kind in the bag), covered, and simmered the dish for about 4 minutes.  I then added the rest of the sauce and let it sit for a little bit.  Absolutely delicious!

I used the apple juice because I didnt have the other two options. I wasnt sure about using it at first becuase I dont like fruit with meat but you couldnt taste the apple juice after it was cooked at all. I also used flour instead of cornstarch and it turned out great. The whole family loved it.

HINT:  How to thin slice meat for this kind of dish.  Put it in the freezer for a few hours (check often) and when it's partially "stiff", it's time to slice.  Much easier than with fresh meat.
Hope it helps?

Really liked the sauce!! I followed the advice of others and used half the sauce, minus the cornstarch, to marinate the steak for a few hours. Then doubled the sauce to cook the meat and then added the cooked veggies.

Very much like I make it but where's the seasoning?
Since I discovered Penzey's '5 Chinese Spice' my stir-fry has been out of this world.  
I usually make stir fry out of left over steak; that way I get two meals out of one steak!

And Basmati rice is so much better than plain white rice; more protein and so much more flavorful.

This isn't heavily seasoned but I liked that - I want to taste the beef tenderloin I used and I wanted to actually taste all those wonderful fresh vegetables. Didn't use the sugar at all, and reduced the soy sauce by a third, replacing it with beef broth to compensate.  Instead of white wine, apple juice or water I used rice wine (mirin).  I added just enough of that mixture to coat the meat and reserved the rest to add to everything at the end.  As the submitter suggested, I included a variety of vegetables to use what I had in the fridge - mushrooms, yellow and green bell peppers, onions, zucchini and yellow squash. I added fresh, minced garlic to the vegetables as well.  I love stir fries. First of all, they taste good.  And if you're careful not to use too much oil, if you have a little piece of meat in the freezer (1/2 pound serves me and Hubs with leftovers) and a few vegetables in the fridge, you can put together a nice, nutritious meal in less time than it takes to cook the rice.  (I have to confess I don't care for pea pods, carrots or water chestnuts, explaining why I had none of them laying around to use)

I made this last night with red wine as the liquid for the sauce and the addition of tri-color bell peppers...wonderful, fast, easy, adaptable recipe!  The kids and husband all loved it.  I'll be making this again for sure!

This is a great recipe. I also doubled the sauce. Next time might even triple it so that there is more to drizzle over rice or noodles. I also used garlic with the veggies. Instead of pork I used pork tenderloin as that's all I had on hand and marinated it in half the sauce for about an hour. It was great. You really can't go wrong with this recipe. Its definately a keeper. Also, I added a teaspoon of oyster sauce to the sauce and it was really great.

Very good basic stir-fry recipe that you can easily alter to suit your tastes or ingredients on hand.  I used Sherry as that's all I had and it tasted great.  Also, if you like your dishes a little more seasoned-up, you may want to add some cracked black pepper and some red pepper flakes like I did.  Very good and I'll put this one into my regular rotation.

This recipe turned out well for me.  I bought a bag of pre-cooked beef strips and used broccoli, sliced bell pepper, and cut up roma tomatoes for the vegetables.  When I was mixing up the "sauce" portion, instead of using sugar, I put in a little bit of ginger and some garlic powder.  Mmm...very good!

This is an excellent - and quick - stir fry. The sauce is very good, and acts as a good thickener for the finished product. My only real complaint is that 6 Tbsp of soy sauce is too salty overall - even with the veggies. I've made it twice now, and the second time, I altered it slightly: 5 Tbsp of soy, and I added a large crushed clove of garlic to the meat sauce. The garlic really punches up the flavor, which I found slightly bland the first time around. I served this with brown rice for everyone else, and I ate it on a bed of cold, fresh iceberg lettuce (to meet my low-carb needs). It would also be excellent with some slightly undercooked cabbage. Overall, though, it's a great dish, and will be a part of my regular cooking regimen. Well done!

Very good. Was much more flavorful using Jasmine rice.  Jasmine really gives any rice meal extra flavor.

made this for dinner earlier this week, taking out the water chestnuts and peas and just adding broccoli and carrots.  my kids are so picky they wouldn't eat it, but my hubby liked it a lot.  it came together super quick which is great for me on a busy weekend coming home from work and trying to throw something together.  thanks!

Best sauce I have ever tasted.   The only change I made, on the advice of others, was to cut back on the corn starch.   I wanted a little more sauce so I made l l/2 times times the amount using low sodium soy sauce, apple jucie and sugar, but sayed with the 2 tab. corn starch.  It was just right.  Added l tea. minced refrigerated garlic to sauce.  For the veggies tonight I used broccoli, red pepper slices, onion slices, fresh sugar snap peas, and sliced water chestnuts.  There are so many variations of veggies to use that I can't wait to experiment with this recipe.  But the sauce I will never change.  It is a definite keeper.  Thanks Tere.

This was not as great as the stars indicate.  I used different veggies but my problem was cooking the meat in the sauce.  When you dump it al in the pan to cook, the suace clumps up making it to thick.  I had to add some beef broth to keep it from burning.  I think it would have been better to coook the meat without the sauce, adding the sauce after the meat had cooked.  I am surprised that no one else had this problem...unless I was doing somethign wrong.  Perhaps cooking at a low temp.?  But stir fry is supposed to be at a high temp. So I won't be making this again.

I made the mistake of doubling the sauce, as suggested by others.  This was NOT a good idea as it just turned into a salty gooey mess.  Stick with the original recipe and just maybe add some garlic and ginger.

This was a great base to any stir fry. I agree with other posters that the sauce needs to be doubled. I did 1 1/2 because I had a little less than a pound of meat and I found it still needed more sauce.  I also added a clove of minced garlic to the sauce along with a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes.  My husband and 3 year old daughter loved it too!

I used rice wine vinegar, some sesame oil, little ginger. Some said to double sauce, I would be careful doubling soy.  Add some soy sauce back at end to avoid over salting if you do decide to double.

This was very good, my kids even ate it!
I boiled my beef for about an hour and a half with some stir fry seasoning and onion first so it wouldn't be tough to chew.
I also added more veggies and a little less soy sauce. Served on hot brown rice.  Had lots of flavor and will for sure make again

This is a really great, easy recipe for stirfry. I only made a couple of modifications. The first was substituting mushrooms for water chestnuts, because I hate water chestnuts. The second was using brown rice instead of white. The next time around I think I'll let the marinade soak in for a couple more hours, but I definitely plan on making this again.

Equally good with leftover roast, pork, chicken and shrimp. We like to add a bit of hosin and/or oyster sauce. But you can really fly in any direction with this tasty guide! Thanks

I took people's advice about marinating the beef beforehand, and man am I glad I did.  Also, I used Balsamic vinaigrette instead of wine, it turned out fantastic. Definitely one of my new favorite recipes!

Based on other reviewers comments, I doubled the recipe for sauce. (I never add sugar as it ruins the flavor and adds too much unwanted calories to our diet.)  I marinated the beef in the soy and wine (had to use sherry because I was out of white wine) for about 15 minutes.  Stir fried minced garlic in a little oil, then a using a slotted spoon, moved the beef to the stir fry pan and cooked.  Removed the beef and set aside.  Added some ginger and some frozen Asian vegetables, the water chestnuts, and some bamboo shoots to the pan.  After the 4 minute of covered cooking, I stirred the cornstarch into the soy mixture and added to the vegetables.  When the sauce boiled and thickened, I returned the beef to the pan and heated through.  My husband said it was "awesome" and that the meat and sauce were perfect.  Will definitely cook this again and pass it along to my daughter in Dallas.   Thanks for a really good recipe.

The sauce is great. I used apple juice. I omitted the peas and water chestnuts, and added garlic powder and ginger. This was my third time making this. The first time, the cornstarch was like glue. By the time I added the vegetables, there was no sauce to coat them with. The second time I made this, I threw out all of the excess marinade, cooked the beef, made the marinade again, and added it at the end of cooking. For anyone that's not familiar with the power of cornstarch: cook beef, toss in vegetables, take the pan off the stove, add cornstarched marinade (coating everything), then return to the stove and stir till sauce thickens. This time, 3rd time, I cooked everything on medium-low, nice and slow, and it turned out fine, but I liked the way it turned out the second time better.

My family and I absolutely *love* this stir-fry!! It's such a versatile recipe since you can add any veggies you have on hand.

1 thing that we do is semi-freeze the meat before slicing it, so we can get it alot thinner which we prefer. We also like to let the meat marinate in the sauce for several hours in the refrigerator. 

Now my 22 year old son loves to treat the family by making this for us! Thanks for such a *yummy* recipe :o)

Good Recipe - especially for substitutions - I didn't have carrots or snowpeas - used green peppers and onions instead - added a little stir fry sauce to the veggies for just a little more flavor.  Thanks for posting!

This was a great recipe. My husband and daughter enjoyed it.  I used more soy sauce than the recipe about double the amt. also I added some seasoning salt to the beef to give more flavor.

My family of 6 absolutely loved this recipe. Including two 3 yrs olds. I used the apple juice recipe because i had no wine on hand. I also browned the meat in half the sauce and added the other half when i added the veggies.  I mixed round steak and pork chops together because i didnt have enough of just one. It turned out great. I will cook this definetely again. Thank you.

my kids love this! its easy and so good. the only thing i did different was use a different meat. i used the carne picada instead of stir fry meat. it worked so much better cause the meat was smaller and sorta ground. had a chinesse friend tell me i did a fantastic job on it. that made me feel good. the nice thing is this recipe is a base so you can play with it.

I followed the recipe except for the water chestnuts (I didn't have any). It was delicious. The next time, I added minced garlic and ginger to the soy sauce mixture. I also used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and added a can of baby corn. Outstanding!

Simply the best beef stir fry I have ever made!  I can't believe how tender the beef was.  I agree with the others that it is easy to alter the ingredients to your taste and to double the sauce.

This was so easy and flavorful! I used Shrimp instead of beef. I used green, red and yellow bell peppers along with mushrooms and red onion. I also added garlic to it. It was so easy to make and I will be making this again! Thanks for Sharing!

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I used white wine and nobody liked the flavor, which seemed sour.  The next time, I used apple juice, which was significantly better but I still didn't love.  Not sure if I will be trying again or not.  One plus is it was easy and fast to prepare.

i wanted to give five stars but I added an ingredient... Kens Honey Teriyake to even out the soy sauce flavor... BUT thats only bc i'm not a huge soy sauce fan.  I think the recipe was great before I added the Honey Teriyake, but i liked it better with it.

This stir-fry was really good and I have not made many so I made some mistakes.  If using frozen veggies - don't stir-fry them first.  Became soggy.  I did marinate the meat in garlic, ginger, a little agave syrup instead of sugar and teryaki sauce.  I should have used more garlic to tenderize the beef.  I did the rest as the recipe states and I was very pleased.  I did double the sauce and used basmati rice!!!  Yumm  Cooked in Sesame Oil!!!  nice nuttiness

Very simple and healthy meal to make, and my kids loved it!! I followed the recipe and also added garlic salt to the meat when it was cooking. I also substituted the pea pods for frozen peas and the regular onion for frozen vadalia ones as a shortcut. Will definitely be making again and again!

I agree with a few other reviews in feeling that this sauce is too heavily dependent on soy sauce. It tasted ok and it wasn't too salty by any means, but the flavor was very one note. I used white wine as well.

I used white wine for the broth.  I sauteed the broccoli and carrots first, then removed them and added the beef for a few minutes.  I then removed both, did the sauce then added it all back in to thicken up and stirred well.  Kids thought it was ok, hubby LOVED it.  I added more fresh garlic and some powdered ginger.

I loved this. It had great flavor. I did make a few changes. First I was being lazy so I used frozen stir fry vegetable. As I was cooking there did not seem to be enough sauce for me so I added 1 cup of beef broth. Next time I will increase the cornstarch and apple juice and keep the cup of broth.

I doubled the recipe so I had to use two different pans to hold everything.  But it still came out perfectly.  And that glaze is to DIE for.

I've made this twice and each time I've used whatever veggies I had on hand.  I substituted red wine for the white wine, brown sugar for the sugar and chip steak for the beef round.  I added a clove or two of garlic and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Very flavorful and super simple!

I could take it or leave it.  I followed general recipe, but listened to advise of others and made some changes by doubling the recipe for sauce-only using 2 tbsp corn starch, substituting splenda for sugar, used low sodium soy sauce, and used wine (instead of water or apple juice).  I also used frozen bag of brocolli stir fry as I didn't feel veggies would impact the recipe's basic flavor.  I thought the sauce's consistency was perfect.  I felt the sauce was too salty for my taste, and therefore, didn't care for it.  My 3 yr old said it was yucky and wouldn't eat it.  If I try it again, I will not double soy sauce amount and will only use water or apple juice next time...maybe that will help.  I had high hopes for this recipe with all it's good reviews.  To each is own.

Doubled the sauce but used 8 Tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce + 2 Tbsp. water instead of soy sauce.  Also, used 1/2 Apple Juice cocktail, and 1/2 Water; Added 2 Tbsp. Minced garlic & a dash of ginger.  Used 1 bag fresh california stir-fry veggies & 3 handfuls fresh green beans.  Cooked veggies for 2 min & added 2 sliced cooked steaks & sauce.   Next Step: Try white wine instead & soy sauce.  Also, will add fresh mushrooms & peppers.

Loved this!  I was looking for a gluten-free, high protein, low-fat beef dish and this is it!  Quick, cheap, and delicious!  Doubled the sauce, and added 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger.  Served over brown rice.....yum!

I made this last night very good. I added a little Szechwan Chili Sauce to the meat when it was browned, [we like a little heat] I browned the meat first then started adding my veggies. I just threw them in, I didn't take them out and cook them one by one. I bought the pea pods, but I forgot to put them in. Well next time.

I love the ease of this recipe but I want to recommend to everyone to use Low Sodium Soy Sauce.  I used regular and found it way to salty and I'm a salt lover.  My daughter wouldn't eat it and my husband could barely choke it down which also says a lot because he will eat anything put in front of him.  With that being said I gave it 4 stars because it is still a wonderful recipe and I will be trying it again with the Lower Sodium Soy Sauce.  Other than that no changes are  necessary. Oh, and I doubled the sauce too.

Great resource for a stir fry! Just a couple tips I thought may help. I think marinating the beef is crucial in this recipe (I marinated for 2-3 hours). Also to achieve thinly sliced, tender meat (especially when using cheaper cuts) I suggest putting it in the freezer about 20 minutes prior to slicing. This makes it much easier to slice thin. I also always make sure to cut against the grain; this helps to combat chewiness. I did double the sauce as well as added fresh ginger and lots of garlic. The only other suggestion is to blanch broccoli and carrots if you're using them for just a minute or two before throwing them in the fry.

I absolutely loved this! I was a bit iffy about apple juice, but I did have some I had to get rid of and the taste was just phenomenal. I had a ton of over ripe veggies and they tasted great in this recipe! I also served it over chinese noodles instead of rice. Delicious!

While cooking the meat in the prepared sauce mixture did make the meat very tender and moist, I did not care for the imparted taste of leaving all the liquid that cooks out of the beef in with it.  Next time I think will prepare some sauce for use as a marinade without the cornstarch, cook the meat and drain, then add a fresh sauce mixture with cornstarh for the final cooked sauce.  I used chicken broth as that is what I had on hand, and added 1/2 t of white pepper.  Overall thought it was very good minus the one issue I had with it.

Really great recipe. I made some substitutions with what we had on hand (celery, pea pods, onion & sweet red pepper) as well as adding minced garlic,ground ginger, marinating the meat for an hour and making extra sauce. It would have been good as is as well - one point is that this isn't at all spicy, even with the garlic, so if you want a "kick" you should add some additional heat yourself. We added crushed red pepper flakes to the end product. Thanks for the recipe! It is a keeper.

This is a wonderful stir-fry recipe that lives up to its name.  The dish remained moist, and was delicious served over brown rice.  My husband had thirds (very unusual)!  The only variation I made, at his request, was to add mushrooms.  You must try this recipe!

We loved this recipe.  I used pork because that is what I had on hand. I sautéed my vegetables for about 15 minutes and kept them separate from the meat.  Also, I used a whole onion instead of just 2 tablespoons.

Big hit with the family.  After the kids took their servings I added a bit of chili paste to the rest to spice it up for the adults.  The only thing I would disagree with is the 10 minute prep time.  If you're cutting all these veggies and meat, it takes alot longer.  If you buy everything washed and cut you might be able to throw it together in 10 minutes.

I made this recipe mostly as posted.  I mostly doubled it, but only added 1.5 of the sugar and cornstarch.  It still turned out wonderfully and I was glad I didn't totally double it.  I used broccoli, water chestnuts, sliced red pepper, chinese baby corn, plenty of sliced onion and fresh sugar peas.  YUM!   We had company over and they loved it - even had seconds!  Will make again.  Thank you for the recipe, Tere!

I really liked this recipe, but my kids didn't so much.  I'll try it again though I think they were just having a bad eating day.  I did add a little ginger as other reviewer suggested and let the meat marinate about an hour or so.  Then I steamed the veggies a bit so that they would be softer.  I also stir fried the meat with the marinade and added a little water.

Husband loved it and said it was like the restaurants. I didn't particularily care for it much. Then again, I hate my own cooking. Others love it, i just hate my own cooking. I did add all of our favorite vegetables and a hot pepper as we like our food spicy.

I marinated the steak overnight in half the sauce. I sauteed broccoli and carrots in garlic infused olive oil and then added the marinated steak. I let all of that cook together until the steak was cooked through. Served over a bed of rice.
The only thing I would do differently next time is add more seasoning.

We made this recipe as written, using white wine.  Once everything was prepared we mixed the stir fry with cooked angel hair noodles instead of rice.  It was delicious!  There were no leftovers :(

I had thin slices of rd stk that i sliced 1/4 in. against the grain as a reviewer suggested. I marinated meat in sauce using red wine and no cornstarch for 1 hr. I added teas. of ginger, crushed red pepper and garlic to oil and then added meat without sauce. Removed meat and added green pepper, onion, snowpeas. oil and stir-fried and then added a package of stir-fry vegges. Added 1 teas. cornstarch to marinade and poured in and added meat back. It got plenty thick and was delicious. I added Ramen noodles drained and mixed in. I will make this often. Hubby loved it. Thanks for sharing Tere.
Made this again tonight using 1 sliced zuchini,1 thin sliced gn.pepper & 1/2 onion,2 thin sliced carrots & celery & 8 oz sm. piece frozen broc.&califlower. Removed thin sliced sirloin from mainade with slotted spoon, browned meat, added marinade, let it thicken then added back veggies. This sauce has the same taste as the one used on beef and broccoli dish at my fav chinese restaurant. Husband doesn't like Chinese food, but he loves this & wants it more often.
I love the versatility of this recipe! I made it for a third time using white zinfandil, left over ribeye, frozen stir-fry vegies adding fresh sliced gn.onions & gn.pepper & celery,& mushrooms. Delish again!

First of all I doubled the sauce, using the apple juice.  I’m not a big fan of broccoli (okay, I hate it) so I decreased the broccoli to one cup (because my husband loves broccoli).  I added a sliced bell pepper, sliced fresh mushrooms and bean sprouts.  I also used a small Vidalia onion, sliced.  After heating the 1 tablespoon of oil I added 3 garlic cloves, minced and 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger; cooked for a few seconds to release the flavor.  I then added the sliced onion and sautéed them for about one minute.  Then I added the remaining vegetables and followed the recipe.  It was excellent, defiantly a recipe to add to my book!!

Fabulous!  My family loved it.  Our store didn't have frozen pea pods, bought frozen edamame and shelled them and used those.  Perfect!

Very Good!! Thanks for posting.
I thought that this recipe would be salty because of the amount of soy sauce, but it really wasn't. All in my household ate this and liked it (including my kids and father).  I will make again.

Did not have white wine or apple juice and didn't want to use water.  Chose apple cider vinegar instead.  The flavor was excellent!  Added more vegies than just the ones listed.  Will use this as my only beef stir fry recipe.

If you're looking for an easy, flavorful beef stir-fry, look no further!  It definitely delivers as promised!  Next time, I will double the sauce/marinade, but other than that, it's perfect!

Really liked the flavor. Would never have thought to put wine in it. I didn't use so much soy sauce though. Too salty. But I'll be using this recipe again.

Excellent stir fry!  I made a batch of sauce (minus the cornstarch) and added 1 teaspoon of minced ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I let the meat marinade in the sauce for 4 hours.  Then I discarded the marinade and made a double batch of sauce (with the minced giner and garlic powder) and put the meat in the double batch of sauce.  I cooked the vegetables in sesame oil - I added mushrooms to the mix.  I added peas rather than pea pods.  There was plenty of sauce and the taste was delicious!  I served it over hot white rice.  My preschooler loved it!

This was great1 My whole family really enjoyed it. We did take the advice of some reviews and added some Garlic, ginger and cayenne pepper. We used Broccoli, water chestnuts, Red and Green Bell pepper, Mushrooms and Snap peas. We also used Sesame oil to sautee the veggies in. Worked out really great! Thanks for posting this recipe! We will definitely make it again!

This was excellent! First, I made the sauce as a marinade and placed the beef in it for a few hours (adding garlic and ginger as well as extra soy sauce). Then made a second batch for when I cooked it (added it last, since the beef was plenty juicy from the marinade). I didn't have any peapods, so I used broccoli, shredded carrots and added mushrooms with garlic and green onion. So tasty! We definitely experiemnt with and try again the next time I'm craving beef stir fry!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The sauce was very tasty. I agree with other readers that marinating the beef for several hours in the sauce would be good. I added garlic to the pan before adding the veggies. I will also double the sauce next time and keep some seperate to add to the veggies before serving.

My boyfriend and I loved this dish.  He suggested we puree an apple (peeled/cored) instead of the wine or apple juice.  It added a nice texture and flavor to the sauce.  We also used honey instead of sugar.  Placing this recipe in my favorite file.

Great recipe - I added baby corn, used fresh pea pods, and grated a little fresh ginger.  Also used grape juice instead of apple and tossed the vegetables in a little sesame oil when frying.  Brown rice for health!  Way better than a restaurant!

What a great recipe!  Tastes like you ordered it from a chinese restaurant. 
My husband is so picky and really not much of a veggie eater and he raved about this.  My two young kids also loved this.  
I served my stirfry over rice stirfry noodles.
Thank you, thank you for this recipe!

Very easy to make.  I liked the original flavor, but wanted to experiment.  I added some orange marmalade after beef was cooked, gave it a nice hint of orange.  Family really liked the flavor and they hardly ever like anything.  Still could not get them to eat the veggies though.

Very good and easy stir-fry.  Next time we would definitely double the sauce and add some garlic and ginger.  My husband made this himself...way to go honey!

Great family receipe.  Based on other reviews I doubled the liquid and I used 1/4c applejuice & 1/4c red wine because I happened to have both.  Instead of just dipping the meat in the mixture I let it maranate in it while I cooked my veggies.  The receipe never said to pour the mixture in with your veggies after your done dipping the meat so I just poured it down the sink. I think next time I might triple the sauce and add it to the veggies & meat and let it cook all together for a minute.  This stirfry had great flavor just not enough liquid as I like a good amount of sauce.

Excellent recipe and aptly named.  Only reason I didn't give this recipe five stars is because I like a bit of heat.  The addition of 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper or 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper gives this recipe the needed kick up to five stars.

Tasty but too salty.  I would use low-sodium soy sauce next time.  I also used red wine since that's what I had.

Very easy to make which is great for a week night! We used chicken and it was just as good! Easy to add spice for your own level of heat. Officially on the meal plan rotation :)

This was pretty easy to make. I used skirt steak instead of round. Also substituted olive oil and stir-fry or wok oil instead of vegetable oil. I decided to use fresh snow peas instead of frozen. I would recommend eating any leftovers pretty soon. The mixture gets soggy after a couple of days in the refrigerator. We will definitely make this again.

This was really good! I doubled the recipe for the sauce (as per other rating suggestions), but I shouldn't have doubled the cornstarch (my fault, dumb mistake)...so I just added some beef stock to thin it down a bit. I used Sutter Home chardonnay, and I omitted the onion & carrots & added an orange bell pepper sliced into strips because that's what I had on hand. The veggies were cooked perfectly, and my husband & son said "Keep that recipe!" One small serving of leftovers, but only because my sister made us homemade egg rolls to go with it. We'll be making this again...thank you :)

Delicious and really easy!  I used a frozen bag of stir-fry veggies that included everything on the list.  Much easier than chopping all those fresh veggies!  Doubled the sauce too and it came out perfectly.  Better than our local takeout place!

I made this using only good quality ingredients. I skimped on nothing. I used the wine, instead of apple juice. What a difference. When my husband stated "we need to make this more often", believe me I will. Greaaaatt Recipe!

Good, simple stir fry! Would be a "5" if it had more seasonings, which I added (garlic, ginger, onion powder, and sriracha).

This recipe is five stars if you double the sauce.  I have been making this for years and it has been such a hit!  I add a can of pineapple and use the juice of the can instead of apple juice.  I also add ginger to it.  YUMMY!

This was excellent and the sauce had a great flavor.  I marinated the meat in the sauce as another reviewer suggested.   I also added sliced celery, green and red pepper strips, button mushrooms, garlic and red pepper flakes.  It is easy and can be adapted to whatever vegetables one has in the 'fridge.

Turned out pretty well. I have made a similar version of this but without the corn starch. Sauce came out thicker (obviously) but rather tasty. Might try adding some teriyaki sauce next time to sweeten it up a bit.

This was a tasty meal! The only pitfall is the veggie got a mushy when I put them to the side and kept them warm and the beef was a bit chewy. I'll try again though :-)

Tasty and easy to make.  I made a couple of adjustments based on what I had on hand...used stew meat cut into thin strips and used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies.  It turned out great!  I will make this one again.

OK .Not using the cornstarch is a bad Idea,because it tenderizes the meat.That's why you let it stand for a few minutes.This is a great Stir-Fry.

This was my first attempt at a stir-fry without the help of a store-bought packet.  It was super easy and oh so good.  I added a bit of garlic and ginger to the marinade and a few more veggies (red peppers, mushrooms) and even my two year old gobbled it up.  Highly recommend!

Definitely double the sauce (use low sodium soy sauce) and it is awesome!

This was very tasty and I will make it again. The only changes I made were that I used frozen stir-fry veggies, and I added cranberry juice to the sauce. Thanks for a delicious dinner!

Easy, Tasty, and you can put whatever veggies you want in it!  I think next time I will make a little more sauce so there is enough to put on the rice.

I didn't have time to read reviews but did the following:  I added a few Tablespoons of brown sugar & doubled the amount of apple juice.  I cooked the meat in the entire liquid mix.  I cooked on a low heat for several minutes longer to help moisten/soften the meat.    I have two picky eaters - one ate this up & the other preferred the meat with no sauce (I always make some to be on the safe side).

Needed more sauce. The flavoring was good, but I will use a different cut of meat next time. Used a frozen bag of 'oriental veggies' and served with brown rice and cream cheese rangoons.

Great recipe for a crowd.  I made this when the family came for my sons b-day.  I quadrupled the recipe and used his favorite veges-onions, peppers and snow peas.  I used the wine but like others I added extra liquid.  It was a huge hit, with everyone asking for the recipe (even my older brother who is an expert cook!)

We tried this a few weeks ago and LOVED it!  My husband isn't too keen on trying new things and sticking with it, but it's a keeper in our house now.  I didn't have water chestnuts when I made it the first time and I added mushrooms.  Regardless everyone including our 18 month old couldn't get enough of it.

I doubled the sauce recipe and marinated the beef in it for a few hours. I heated the oil and used a slotted spoon to remove the beef from the marinating bowl. I stir fried the beef and added the chunks of onion to it. cooked til brown and added frozen veggie blend. I then poured the sauce in the wok and heated veggies through til sauce thickened. I found it didn't have enough liquid so I added another 1/4 c apple juice with 1/4 c soy. I cook alot, always trying new things. My husband said this is one of my best yet! raved about it with almost every bite (: yummy, thank you for sharing

FANTASTIC!  And easy!  I added yellow and red peppers on super sale from grocer (2 for $0.98), minced garlic and ginger, 1 T fish sauce, some sake, and mirin, used white wine.  I love this sauce.  I did not double the sauce and added more veggies.  I love the corn starch in it to help the sauce stick.  Toddler loved it too.  REALLY GOOD RECIPE!

This recipe was really great - the only things I did different were to add a bit of extra brown sugar, 2 cloves of garlic, and 1/4 tsp of ginger to the sauce to give it a bit more zing. I also doubled the recipe of sauce, which was a bit much, so I'll 1.5 it next time. I used broccoli, onions, red peppers, snap peas, mushrooms, and bean sprouts and it was a really nice combination. Thanks for a good one!

made this for dinner to use up fresh veggies... used snow peas, carrots, green pepper, onion, water chestnuts... doubled recipe and made everything exactly as recipe described... didn't care for the taste of the sauce at all, the soy sauce flavor was overwhelming and masked everything...

This is delicious!  My husband and I have very different tastes and so it's always hard to find  meal we both enjoy- this was it!  I used frozen veggies I had on hand, doubled the sauce, marinated the meat in the sauce, added black pepper, crushed red pepper and ginger, and added noodles at the end instead of rice (the reason I needed more sauce).  I don't always love Food, but this is amazing!

Oh, my gosh!  This is wonderful!  I was looking for an idea for left over steak.  Found this.  I doubled (at least!) the sauce.  Used garlic powder, ground ginger and cayenne pepper (both ground and red pepper flakes).  Also ~ the only juice I had was apple/raspberry.    Used frozen 'california blend' vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and zucchini) and frozen baby green beans.   then, to top it off, i was out of rice!!  Served it with cooked spaghetti noodles.  picky daughter asked why i don't make it more often.  We will add this to our meal rotation!!!  REALLY REALLY EASY WITH LEFT OVER STEAK AND FROZEN VEGGIES!!!  thank you!

i added a teaspoon full of "better than bullion" beef flavor and about an extra half cup of your choice of liquid...apple juice, wine or water and poured over yellow rice which then turns this into a 5 star recipe

Excellent, easy recipe.  Ingredients are pretty much standard in my kitchen.  I used the wine verson, but still added water to the sauce as it was beginning to clump up. Also added chopped garlic & red pepper flakes and doubled the sauce recipe.  Was a little shy of beef so I added shrimp, it went very well.  Used flour (out of cornstarch), worked just fine. I used frozen veggies (broccoli, peas, baby corn, carrots, onions, red/green peppers).

I found the recipe to be very salty. HOWEVER this could be because I doubled the sauce mixture, as suggested by many reviewers. Apple juice may combat the saltyness better, I used white wine. My boyfriend thought it was fine but I had to add sugar on top, which sounds weird, but it made it really tasty. We also added yellow, red, and green peppers, yellow onion, about 1 tablespoon ginger, sesame seeds, bean sprouts and three hand-fulls of of unsalted cashews (which also added some sweetness against the salty.) BE CAREFUL CHEWING THIS MEAL! It may be because we used fresh sugar snap pea pods and not frozen, but I literally choked two times trying to eat. I love them but they are very stringy and the meat isn’t so easy to chew either (we used fresh stir-fry beef which I also choked on.)

I liked that the recipe was so easy, and the sauce was good but not great. I had bought the round beef the grocery store had packaged for stir fry and while it was more tender than I expected, of course would have been better with fillet Mignon cut up in strips.  I'm going to try it again and see if I get better results.  I got home late from work and was starving so I didn't read any reviews for better results.

THe sauce kind of threw me off. I am not much of a fan for cornstarch. The sauce had a weird texture..it's probably just my quirkiness. So only 3 stars from me.

Delicious.... I followed the recipe for the most part, I used apple juice. And for my vegetables used a frozen mix of red/green peppers and onions, and also added snap peas and fresh onions. Turned out great, will be using this often!

Good recipe. I had to use more flour/cornstarch b/c I used frozen veggies that I did not thaw and drain before hand. I would recommend definitely using low sodium soy sauce, if not, the stir-fry is too salty for my liking. yum. I will make again.

I added ginger and garlic. Cooked the meat mixture first then added all my veggies so they all had the yummy flavoring. I also substituted Braggs for the Soy Sauce - so it was Gluten Free.

Very good! It's a nice clean versatile recipe. Garlic & crushed red pepper was added and I used a different mix of veggies (brocc, onion, red pepper, celery, water chestnuts). Totally double the sauce and reserve half for when you take the veggies off the stove to set aside. Next time, I wanna add fresh ginger.

I made this recipe exactly as is. It was just O.K.  Needed a little more flavouring. Ginger maybe, garlic etc. Also, I would scale back on the cornstarch next time.  It made a sort of gravy instead of nice sauce. Way too thick for the veggies. Will try again with some modifications.

Really liked this recipe. I used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine or apple juice (didn't have any) and doubled the sauce to use as a marinade for the beef. I added to it a tsp of ginger garlic paste and a tsp of hot chili sauce. The veggies I used were broccoli, mushrooms, shredded carrots, bean sprouts and sugar snap peas. I also added some cashews for crunch since I'm not crazy about water chestnuts. I'll definately make this one again.

I made this recipe exactly as called for and must say that I was disappointed. Very bland flavor, minimal amount of sauce.  My son barely ate his portions worth and he is normally quite the meat eater!  Not this time though! I will not be making this again as there are too many other excellent recipes that I'd rather try.

Was looking for something quick and easy to stir fry and found this recipe. Used veggies I had on hand-yellow and red peppers,zuchini,squash,and the pea pods are a must! Followed advice and doubled the sauce-came out awesome-cant wait to make again.

YUM!  We really enjoyed this recipe! I  used low-sodium soy sauce and white cooking wine and thought it was a bit salty.  I would recommend using regular white wine to decrease the salt.  Delicious flavor!

I made this with one of those ready made, handy dandy stir-fry veggie packs. The sauce needed a little something extra - I added minced ginger from a bottle, some garlic powder, and a teeny splash of sesame oil. It still needed something else, but I don't know what. Oh, and I think this would be way better served with noodles. This was ok but I wasn't entirely happy/full after eating it.

My family and I love this stir fry! I follow the recipe and it turns out great. I will say that like it more with wine than appple juice or water. This dish is also very quick to make when using frozen vegtables.

The sauce for the beef totally made the dish. Everything was perfectly cooked and pre-cut brocolli florets made the dish even  quicker. Definitely one to make again and again with whatever veggies I have on hand.

Very easy. In the meat marinade, I also added garlic powder and a bit of ginger. Once the meat was in the wok, I added beef broth and a small amount of rice vinegar. It was very quick and easy!

Good Recipe.  Made with London Broil/Round steak.  Sliced meat super thin while frozen.  Used 1/3 less soy sauce.  Used chinese cooking wine for the liquid.  Marinated overnight.

This was good. I found that the veggies needed more time to soften so I microwaved them after cooking for about 4 minutes. Used Brocolli, carrots, green beans and scallions. I added some garlic and ginger to the meat. I added all of the sauce to the meat, let it marinate for about 30 minutes and cooked the meat in the sauce. The sauce was very thick so I added some beef broth while cooking until it thinned to my liking. Family liked it and so did I. Will make again. Thanks.

I just wasn't that crazy about this. The veggies were good, but I always seem to find this kind of meat to be a bit tough. I would have enjoyed this more with the addition of some spices to kick it up a bit. Thanks for the post!

This was terrific--- I followed other users suggestions and doubled the sauce. I added some cayenne pepper to add some heat to it. I recommend using tenderloin as the beef. Its more expensive, but is worth it!

This was pretty good. Not spectacular - but very good. It had the "expected" stir fry flavor to it. And, it felt really heathly eating it! Chock full of vegetables. My only complaint was the time it took to prepare - I wasn't in the mood this busy weekday night. But, the family (even the kiddos) gobbled it up and it was a very satisfying meal.

This was a pretty good recipe.  It seemed that the vegetables needed a little liquid to cook in, but it worked out anyway.  The meat wasn't very tender, but that could have been the beef that I bought, not the recipe?!? I used onion, broccoli, green pepper and garlic.  The sauce did have a good flavour.

Everyone in the family liked this one - they all said it was better than take-out.  Cooking the veggies like that was perfect!  Just crispy enough.  I used low sodium soy sauce but I think I'd like to try it with the regular soy sauce.  I ended up having to add a little salt to my plateful.  I also think I'll try chopping up some garlic and mixing it in with the meat before I add it to the sauce next time.  Very good - thanks for a great recipe!

The sauce is very tasty! I add a little bit of crushed red pepper for a kick.
