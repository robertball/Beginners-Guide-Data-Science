WHOA - before you make this - I think that the amount of cumin and chili powder is reversed. (I think it should be 3 T Chili Powder & 1 T Cumin) Besides that I think that this recipe needs onions -the bell pepper didn't seem to fit quite right especially without the onion. I hope the submitter steps in and if the recipe is incorrect asks AR to correct it. In the meantime - beware and make the corrections yourself. *** UPDATE - there is no way you will need 4 cups of water unless you plan to cook this down all day or want Chili Soup.

I thought it was delicious; I omitted the green peppers since, it isn't one of my families favorites...YES, the cumin and chili powder are reversed (easy fix) I always use more chili powder than whats called for. The recipe openly suggests to use whatever ingredients you may like; I did just that, I used kidney beans, black beans, Mexican corn, I cooked an onion in with the ground beef. Last but not least, a big squeeze of tomato paste from the tube.....: )
