Try adding the sugar during the boiling stage of the water; very smooth results. Our family has made iced tea like this since I was a child.

I didn't have the orange pekoe tea available and used regular tea bags.  It turns out great...very refreshing!  Great for BBQs!

I love iced tea, but I found this to be a little
tart, like a cross between iced tea and lemonade.
I would recommend reducing the amount of lemon.

I use 5 regular individual sized tea bags (liptons) or 3 family sized in 2qts of water. I steep for only 5 - 10 minutes. This helps the sugar dissolve easier since it is added when it is verh hot. I then add 3/4 to 1 cup of sugar and omit the lemon. Hey, I live in Southern USA, we don't call it "Sweet Tea" for nuthin'! lol! I serve with lemon slices when I have them. I have an abundance of mint out in the yard that I gather and wash and then pour the tea over a sprig of it in the summertime. Ahhhhh :-)

Great recipe for iced tea!  I love the flavor you get from using the orange pekoe tea bags! I added 1/4 tsp. of baking soda (a little tip I picked up from another recipe to cut out the bitterness) I cut up some fresh lemons and fresh oranges and added them to the tea as well. Very refreshing!

I adjusted this recipe a little - I used 5 tea bags, the whole amount of sugar, and half the lemon. It was still a little too sour, so I added lots of ice cubes and a little more sugar. After this adjustment, it was really yummy - tasted like the bottled kinds you buy in the store! Very easy to make.

This stuff was great.  I only used half the amount of lemon juice, because that was all I had, but it was a big hit.

For all the 5 star reviews I was expecting something really extraordinary here, thinking maybe it was that ideal ratio between lemon juice and number of tea bags or something. This was good, but just average brewed iced tea. Certainly nothing unusual or special.

Great recipe!!  I used gunpowder green tea.  You can pick this up at any natural foods store where you can buy tea in bulk.  I also added some honey and reduced the sugar.  It turned out great.

I've been making 2 batches of this every other day. 16 cups, 6 teabags...we love it but I did have to adjust sugar to 1/2 c and lemon to 1/4 just to suit our taste....very refreshing. I never made iced tea before

This is how we've made iced tea for as long as I can remember.  I didn't let my tea bags seep the full hour since I don't like a strong tea taste and I just heated my water in the microwave.  I've also used different flavor tea bags and it's always good.  Thanks for sharing.

What's not to like?  It is a delicious tea.  My taste is for less lemon so I used less.  Also used splenda instead of sugar.  Be sure to mix the sugar or splenda in while the tea is still warm otherwise it leaves lumps.

We love the citrus iced green tea they sell in the stores (you know the brand), can't keep it in the house. I was looking for something close or something I could easily change to suit my needs, and this was it. I used 5 green tea bags, and cut the lemon juice down to 1/4 cup since I was using the bottled lemon juice I had on hand, added the sugar while the water was still hot so that it disolved faster. I haven't lugged home any of those heavy jugs of tea from the store in months, this tastes wonderful, and I'm sure is even better for us then the bottled stuff. Thank you.

I made this the other day and it is delicious! I will definitely be making this often and will probably never buy iced tea mix again. The only change I made was I used Barry's Gold Irish tea bags as it's the only tea we drink and I always have plenty on hand.

I never made iced tea before. This worked great! I used 1/4 lemon juice and it was just tart enough. For those who aren't sure, reg. tea such as lipton, red rose, etc., is orange pekoe. Orange pekoe is a the most widely used black tea.

this was so easy and it came out great!  i used different types of flavored teas (lupicia peach melba and lupicia jardin sauvage), but stuck with the receipe exactly otherwise.  my family loved it!  especially my stepson, who is not allowed to drink caffeine (i used decaf tea)!

We like it with the steeping method but adding 1/2 cup sugar and a splash or two of lemon juice. Thanks!

Delicious!  I mix black tea with a couple of fruity tea bags to make a light and refreshing fruit tea.  No lemon needed in that case!  I used half the sugar.

A simple and great way to make iced tea!  Turned out wonderful!  If you find your iced tea has a bit of a strong or bitter taste, add a small pinch of baking soda - this usually takes the bitterness away.

OIrange Pekoe is a term to describe what "grade" a tea leaf is. There is only one true "tea".  True tea comes in various grades. White, Green, Black Oolong, and their various flavored brothers and sisters (Earl Grey) come from the same plant, which is called Camellia sinensis. Pretty much every store will have the grade of tea which is referred to in this recipe. One of the most famous brands would probably be Lipton as that is their staple tea.

This was a good recipe but I made some mods and adjusted it to my own preferences. I used 3 bags of Green Tea, steeped for around 1 1/2 hour. Used no sugar or sugar substitute and squeezed some lemon in it (about 1/2). Nice and refreshing, and beneficial health wise too. I will be using these measurements for chilled green tea from now on! For sweetness I may add fresh blueberry juice or POM juice in the future. Updating: After a few days of this sitting in my fridge I have come to the realization that this tastes like the iced teas find at Starbucks (I'm personally a big fan of the unsweetened ones in the summer)! Again a keeper for sure, the measurements and timing are perfect!!!!!

Great drink. The high amount of lemon makes it taste liek Arnold Palmer (half iced tea and half lemonade). I make a lot and bottle it in empty water bottles to save for later.

Makes a great Iced Tea.  I did, however, cut the sugar back to only 1/2 cup (the 3/4 was WAAAY too sweet for me).

This is a great basic iced tea recipe. I used this for an idea of proper proportions but made it as sun tea instead and it was perfect. I will be making this again often, thanks for the recipe!

Seriously the best Iced Tea recipe I've tried yet! I did not find this too sweet or too sour and actually tweaked it slightly by adding 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of lime juice - delicious!!

I liked this drink, but I thought it tasted more like juice than tea.  I decreased the sugar to 2/3 a cup and the lemon juice to 1/4-1/3 a cup.  I did use regular black tea because I already had some.

I thought this was good. I like a strong tea with lemon and lots of sugar. If you like black coffee or tea, you may want to cut on the sugar but I had to increase it!

I grew up with ice tea in my house. My Mom use to make it during the summer months. But you need to have fresh lemons...it taste so much better that way. My Mother sometimes would add lemons, limes and oranges in the pitcher. I drink it now all year long...I don't add the sugar but use about 2 to 3 wedges of fresh squeezed lemons.

I used early grey. It was very good. For someone with a massive sweet tooth, I would even cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. Too sweet....

Great Iced tea.    I am currently nursing so the caffeine is not good for my little one.  I substituted regular tea for decaf and it worked just fine!

I really enjoy this recipe! I have tried several iced tea recipes on here and this is definitely my favorite!  I tend to use a few extra tablespoons of sugar, and since Earl Grey tea is all I have, I use that instead of orange pekoe and it turns out great!

Tasted great! I used 1/4 ReaLemon instead of fresh juice. The first time I made it, it took quite a while until the tea had cooled enough to chill in the fridge. So the next time I made it, I sped things up:  I boiled only 2 cups of the water, dissolved the sugar and steeped the tea for about 5 minutes. Then I filled my pitcher the rest of the way with cold water from my filter jug and added the lemon. It was cool enough to put in the fridge right away. I didn't have icecubes, but that would have made things even faster.

a little backing soda can help the bitter or tart taste if you add it to the water before you steep the the tea  I use a 1/4 teaspoon but some areas water is more or less acidic which will have its affects on the tea made

I loved this recipe, and I thank you. The only thing I did different the scound time, was use 1/2 sugar and I did put suger in when I took off the heat. I love the McDonald's Ice tea, now I do not have to buy anymore. I thank you again.

I made this to the recipe yummy-next time I would cut down on the sugar or cut it out altogether. Loved the flavour, not bitter tea tasting. Served with cut limes and lemons. Will surely make this again.

This was nice and refreshing on a hot summers day. However it was way too sweet and the amount of lemon juice overpowered the tea. I've now made it a few times (it never lasts long at my house!) and now make it with 5 teabags, boil the water with the sugar and steep it for 20-30 min then add 1/4c lemon juice. I really like it with Earl Grey tea and am going to experiment with fruit teas

I love iced tea!.. I used 5 bags, allowed mine to steep for about 20 minutes and it was great!  I omitted the lemon juice but put sliced lemons on top!  I used "Sugar in the Raw" Perfect for  hot days like today!  Thanks!

I noticed this tasted alot better if it sits for a few days. I did double the tea bags and half the lemon juice. Which it was still alittle sour. I would only make this again if I had nothing else in the house to drink. Was just okay for me.

This recipe was a bit too tart for our liking.  But good none the less. I made these changes: I used 8c hot water and microwaved it for 5 mins.  Added two tea bags and let sit for 30 mins.  Then I added 1/4c each of lemon and lime juice and 3/4c sugar.

This is a 5+. I have made a few batches of this, and have to fight my son for it. The only thing I changed is that I use 1/2 cup of sugar, and I don't steep for and hour. 5 or 10 minutes is more than enough.
To me it sure tastes like the Iced tea I get from Starbucks and I can afford this one!!!!
Thanks so much!

This is really good. Since I didn't have fresh lemons, I had to use bottled juice (ReaLemon) and I was very pleased with the result. I will certainly make this again.

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe except for the lemon juice (left that at 1/2 cup).  After the water had boiled I added the tea bags, lemon juice & sugar.  I covered the pan and let it steep for 2 hours.  Loved it!

I halved this recipe except that I still used 3 tea bags.  Also, I used green tea instead of black and combined lime and lemon juice so I could use up an extra lime I had.  Turned out great!

This was really easy & is super yummy!
I used fresh squeezed lemon and it really makes a difference. You may need to add more sugar depending on your sugary preference. It's inexpensive and fun to make. I'll certainly be making this Iced Tea all summer long!

I was looking for an Arnold Palmer recipe I could make in my electric iced tea maker. I followed the manufacturers instructions for 2 quarts, adding the sugar and lemon juice to the pitcher before brewing. I'm pleased with the results.

Wow, fantastic! I used 4 Twinings Pekoe Orange tea bags since I like a strong tea. I followed the suggestions to use less lemon juice, so I used slightly less than half a cup. Next time, I will use less sugar. It's a little sweet for my taste. I would like to taste the tea more.

The orange tea with the lemon juice gave this tea such a wonderful citrus taste. It was great. It overflowed my 1 liter pitcher, so have a large pitcher.

Very good and It does taste like arnold palmer tea. I decreased sugar to 1/2 cup and we like  a stonger tea taste, so I think I will use more tea bags ( I  use red rose).  I imagine any tea bag  will work. Its   easy to make and I  plan on making this again.

Overall this was great! I didn't have the orange tea bag that it inquired in the ingredients, but I used a different type that also worked! It was very refreshing and would be great for a BBQ.

It is a very, very hot day today.  I just came back from a walk with my 2 year old in his stroller, up hill most of the way...let's just say this is the best iced tea I have ever tasted!!!  It has just the right hit of lemon.  I took the advice of adding the sugar when I removed the pot of water from the stove.  I immediately added the lemon and let the whole thing steep for 1 1/2 hours.  Will definitely make it again!!!

I've made this iced tea twice so far and I don't think I'll be having iced tea any other way. I did make a few modifications from other's suggestions. I only put 1/2 cup of sugar, about 1/4 of lemon juice and I put 5 tea bags for 30min. I added the lemon juice and sugar after the water boiled so everything would dissolve easily. I think I might add a fruit tea bag next time to try something new.

This iced tea is awesome!!  It is always in my fridge during the summer.  Instead of the amount of lemon juice it calls for in the recipe I just juice one lemon and it is perfect.  I mix the sugar and lemon juice together then pour in the boiling water, drop in the tea bags, give it another stir and let it steep.  It is soo easy and so good!

I have made this several times exactly as the recipe is written, at first it was a bit bitter but as one person wrote if you let it sit until the next day it  is very good. No more mix for me. Thanks for the recipe.

I added 3/4 cup of baking Splenda instead of sugar while boiling.  I also used the juice (and pulp) from 1 1/2 lemons for the 1/2 cup lemon juice.  I steeped with 5 tea bags for 45 minutes.  Very tasty, and low-calorie too.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added sugar to the boiling water ending with smooth results. Added 1/2 cup of sugar and only 1/4 cup of lemon juice...yum. You only need to steep for 5-10 minutes. One hour is a bit much, for me anyway. The longer you steep tea, the more bitter it becomes. It's a great tea and doesn't need my adjustments. I adjusted it to my taste because I will be the one drinking it. Is there anything special about this recipe? I don't know, because it is only tea, a mere three ingredients. What would make an extraordinary tea?...lol. I'll never buy store tea again for sure.. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a huge success at our bbq's. I edited it a bit. I squeeze half a lemon and a hole lime into the sugar then poor the boiling water on top of the sugar lemon/lime mixture and mix well, steep 2 orange pekoe bags and one peppermint tea bag for 10 minutes. Then chill, once chilled we cut up the other half of lemon and throw it in the iced tea. YUMM!!

We are going to try green tea and use honey as a sweetener, and play with the steeping times a bit.

THIS IS IT. Since where I live doesn't sell ice tea with the flavor that I want, I decided to try making it on my own. And this recipe is exactly how I wanted it to be! The fabulous mix lemon juice and tea is just perfect, and so is the amount of sugar. 

Tip: Any type of tea works great. I grabbed the Earl Grey tea bags I had at the time, and they taste just as amazing. But you might need to throw in an extra bag or take away a bag depending on what kind of tea you're using and if you want the tea flavor stronger. 
The ratio of sugar is just right, I don't recommend reducing the sugar, the tea will taste bland and sour. 

Made it numerous times and all my family enjoyed it.

I've made two batches this week and love every drop! I followed the recipe except I substituted stevia for 1 cup of the sugar (I leave a little sugar in for the body to digest) and it tasted fantastic. The only thing I really noticed was it needs to sit for at least an hour after you add the lemon and sugar to blend the flavours.

Great recipe for the proportions. I use left over tea, DH makes a full tea pot in the evening. I put left over tea in a pot in the morning, (minus the tea bags they’ve already steeped overnight) add sugar bring to simmer at medium-hi heat whisk until sugar dissolve.  Remove from heat let cool add lemon. Refrigerate & enjoy.

I made 2 servings and made it with 2 regular tea bags. I mixed in the sugar right after boiling the water and while steeping the tea bags in order to ensure the sugar dissolved (as other reviews recommended). 

I like my iced tea strong and sweet and this was exactly that.

Nice ratio of water to tea. I may be stripped of my Texan passport because I don't like sweet tea, but I made this without the sugar. Thank you for the recipe.

A favourite in our household for sure. 

I make two modifications:

- I switch the sugar for Splenda (and generally only 1/2 cup)
- I use Green Tea, which I found takes the bitterness out of the final taste

After I tried this recipe, I started increasing the water and decreasing the number of teabags.  I am using 28 cups of water and 4 teabags.  When the bags are steeped for so long, I found no need to use so many bags.  It could possibly be the quality of the tea...

This tasted like store bought! It was great. Only change was to use fresh lemon to taste, and steep 3bags for 45 minutes, mix and steep 1 new tea bag for an hour while chilling. Thank you!

I started with blueberry tea and 1/2 cup of sugar. It was too sweet, so I added 1/4c. lemon juice, and it was PERFECT! Delicious!

Been making ice tea for decades, letting it sit for no more than 30 minutes with a timer to remind me to finish it. Pour into bottles and into the freezer to chill faster. End of day what's in the bottom goes into the freezer creating its own tea cube(ice cube). I use a 1 gallon size bag(Sams club).

This is an "Arnold Palmer" that is a tea and lemonade hybrid.  Use one half cup of simple syrup instead of sugar for a clear and refreshing treat.  Be careful not to squeeze the tea bags.  Squeezing the bags makes for very cloudy tea.
