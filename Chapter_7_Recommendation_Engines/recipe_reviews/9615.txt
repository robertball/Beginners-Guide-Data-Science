These are very, very good and healthy!  I used chunky applesauce instead of the oil and spiced rum instead of vanilla.  I also added about 1/3 cup honey and another 1/2 cup of oatmeal, and left out the dates.  They were SO easy and SO quick!!  They didn't make a big mess of my kitchen either; no flour or milk or whatever to spill everywhere.  I will definitely make them again!

My children love these cookies!  I have made them with other dried fruits, chopped apples, even mini chocolate chips!  I've also baked them in a bar pan for quick soft granola bars.  Use parchment paper or grease pan--the banana caramelizes leaving a sticky residue.  This is my favorite kid snack recipe!

This is a great recipe, the cookies were moist, chewy & very sweet despite being sugar free. The texture is really good. I used chopped dried apricots and raisins instead of dates.  They don't spread so you need to flatten them, they turn out the same shape they go in.  Make sure you add some spices to it like cinnamon and nutmeg.  Loved these, And I don't feel as guilty!

This was a very good recipe. After reading the comments below I added 3 diced apples, 1/4 cup of walnuts, 1 more cup of oatmeal, 1 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg, used the applesauce instead of the oil, added 1/4 cup of coconut, 1/4 cup of wheat germ and 1/2 cup of honey. I also reduced the heat to 325 and the time to 15 minutes. It sounds like it was a lot more work but I found it absolutely delicious and the apples made it VERY juicy. I also greased the cookie sheet with Pam. My son (4) helped me make them and I had to put him on "time-out" for reaching onto the cookie sheet on the stove for another while I wasn't looking. I guess they're good!

These cookies are my favorite healthy treat! I too substitute the oil for applesauce and add nuts, cinnamon, cranberries and raisins. I am not a big fan of dates so I leave them out.  I have made these at least 10 times already using all different sorts of dried fruit combinations. They are even good with dried blueberries. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

These are great little healthy cookie bites.  Bananas and dates make a great sweetener and if you add a bit of cinnamon, cloves, allspice (or whatever), they end up tasting like little banana bread bites.  Very good.  Very addicting.  

If you like your cookies sugar-sweet or crispy, then they aren't for you.  Sweetness relies on the ripeness of the bananas and sweetness of the dates (so they could be very sweet or only mildly so).  Cookies turn out soft.

I loved them, and will definitely make them again.

What is with all the negative reviews on this recipe?  I have been a "health nut" for many years, and this is the FIRST healthy cookie recipe that was actually good!  I did follow others' substitutions and additions: 1/2 c applesauce instead of oil Added: 1/3 c honey 1/2 c oatmeal 1 tsp. each cinnamon and nutmeg 1/4 c walnuts  The batch made 25 cookies, and here is the nutritional information that I calculated: 88 Calories 1g Total Fat 0 mg Cholesterol 1 mg Sodium 19 g Total Carbs 2 g Dietary Fiber 2 g Protein

The one thing to remember here is this is a HEALTHY cookie.  I put nutmeg, cinnamon and extra vanilla in mine and used dried cranberries and dates. They burn very quickly so keep an eye on them. I think I'll try pressing them into bars with mini chocolate chips next. I took them to work and they were inhaled!

These were pretty good...although the oil was a bit much...I would definately subsitute for applesauce.  Since these cookies don't spread when they bake, I would also make the shape you want as an end product initially...I would also make the dough balls smaller so they bake crispier.  This was a fun recipe though!  Great for college because the ingredients were pretty available.  Thanks!!!!

I would not recomend serving these cookies to anyone other than infants, toddlers or children or people who are diabetic or dieting. I "doctored" these up with cinnamin, cloves, 1 tsp of rum extract and used raisins instead of the dates. They were pretty blah anyways. Great recipe for babies just learning to eat on their own, my 1yr old liked them.

It's so hard to find cookie recipes without refined sugars or artificial sweeteners in them.  I tried these cookies and my boys LOVED them.  I added some chopped apple and cinammon to the recipe and they are a huge hit!  Thank you!

These cookies are fabulous.  Excellent as a "breakfast cookie."  I made them exactly as the recipe stated and I loved them, my mom loved them and a diabetic co-worker loved them!  I am going to try them again with some raisins and walnuts.
There are many suggestions to add sugar and chocolate chips etc, but that sort of defeats the purpose of this cookie... 
Quick, easy, healthy and a new favorite at my house.  Thanks!

An extra note...  Now that I have made over 10 batches of these in the last week, I have perfected a few things...  I use 1/2 dates and 1/2 raisins because I love raisins.  I also added a half a cup of chopped walnuts.  Once the oats have sat for 15 minutes I roll the oats into walnut sized balls and put them on the cookie sheet. Messy on the hands but turns out a nice uniform cookie.  Then once all the cookies are on the pan I squish them with a spatula.  They don't spread so you can fit lots on a pan and they come out nice and round and perfect looking.

Awesome recipe especially if you are watching your sugar.  But if not, eat them for breakfast!!

I'm shocked no one has explored the obvious: add peanut butter! There's no better combination than banana and peanut butter. Except if I had done as other's suggest and also use mini chocolate chips! I used 1/3cup peanut butter instead of oil and they were delicious. I also used raisins instead of dates. My toddler LOVED them and so did I.

After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to alter this a little bit and I am very pleased with how they turned out! I used 3 cups of rolled oats, but I ground one cup in the blender first, and used some of the oat flour to assist me in chopping the dates. (They can be very sticky when fresh!) I used coconut oil for both flavor and nutrition, and also added 1/2 cup chopped raisins and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, for more sweetness. I highly recommend adding 1/2 -1tsp salt! This might be why some thought the cookies tasted flat. Also a good shake of cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp cardamom. They turned out sweet enough to satisfy our family, including my 7 year old daughter, who generally hates granola bars. Baked at 325 F, convection, for about 17 minutes, until browning at the edges and on bottom. I will make these again for sure, and will experiment with other dried fruits. Very moist and snack-worthy! (:

the thing about calling something a "cookie" is that people expect dessert.  To me, this is not really dessert.  It was very tasty, but in a "healthy" way, you know?  However, rolling it into a pan and making "energy bars" would conjure up a more accurate image in my mind.  

I dressed this up by subbing peanut butter for the oil.  I added an egg for cohesion, and chopped pecans and choco chips for taste.  I did add salt, because I could see how bland it would be without it.  You just don't realize what salt does to the taste of a cookie!

I will make these again, as I see plenty of options and potential as healthy energy food for my hiking and biking.  I envision dried cranberries, coconut, bran, wheat germ, etc.

For a healthy cookie recipe, I don't have too much to complain about it as written. It's a good little snack and plenty sweet. I used craisins instead of dates since we're not big fans of the latter. I think it would be much better with the addition of cinnamon, so will do that next time. Thanks for the good start for a healthy cookie option!  :)

Wow, so happy to have a vegan cookie that even my teen daughter and her friends like!    I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars because it's the best cookie I've ever eaten, but it is a great way to cure the cookie craving without white flour, white sugar, eggs or dairy!  Very good in it's own category.  I followed one reviewer's advice and ground half of the oats to try to improve the texture.  I did use oil, and the cookies were not crumbly or difficult to work with at all.  Adding a pinch of salt and your favorite spice is a must. I also added walnuts which, in my opinion, are very important to give some crunch and improve on the gooey, oatmeal-ish texture of the cookie.  I also think the dates are a very important ingredient for sweetness and texture, and don't think other dried fruits would give as good of a result.  There have been lots of comments on how long to bake the cookies, but honestly, it didn't seem to matter much to me.   Some I cooked much longer than others, but they all turned out moist. The recipe made about 20 cookies for me.    Thank you so much for sharing this healthy treat!  They're almost gone already.

I used applesauce after reading the other reviews and added white chocolate chips. I agree with the reviewer who said the banana taste was a little strong, but they are pretty good and I think I will try them again with regular chocolate chips. I used very good dates, so they weren't as good as the dates by themselves which is why I only gave 3 stars. A real oatmeal cookie lover might like them better, I'm a chocolate chip girl but wanted to try them to use up some bananas.

I love this recipe! It's like the foundation for a healthy cookie.  For a healthier version, I used vanilla yogurt instead of oil. I also added milled flaxseed, dried mixed fruit and pecans. There are so many ingredients you can use. You can't feel guilty about eating a lot of these!

Very easy to make and they have a great flavor.  My husband and I have enjoyed these on several occasions, sometimes substituting dates for the cranberries and adding walnuts as well as plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg.  They do need to be formed in the desired shape as they do not spread when baked.  Delicious either way!  Thanks K.Gailbrath!

I made a few changes as others recommended, that I would recommend you follow. I did not use dates, I added 1/2 cup of oats (so used 2 and 1/2 cup of oats in total), I added 1/3 cup of honey, used 1/3 cup of apple sauce instead of oil, and used 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla. I also added 1/2 tablespoon of ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Very good!

These were surprisingly good. They're what I would consider a breakfast cookie and naturally ...and lightly, sweet. Like others, I replaced the oil w/ unsweetened applesauce, used about 1/3 rainins/craisins in place of dates as well as adding 1 sm apple chopped. In addition, I added about 1/4 cup chocolate chips. I wasn't sure they would hold their shape, but w/ a bit of pressing together, they did. Baked at 325F for 15 min. They were soft, chewy...and my chldren LOVED them. Yay! a healthy cookie that they'll eat! They're moist, so I wouldn't let them sit in a container for more than a few days or I suspect they'll mold. However, mine didn't last more than 24 hrs. ;) Will definitley make mulitiple times over. :)

First of all after reading all the reviews, the one thing that comes to mind is Parchment paper. The cookies do not stick if you line the sheet with parchment. I subbed applesauce for the oil, added cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allsopice and ginger. I also added about 1/4 cup wheat germ and used cranberries instead of dates. The cookies are not pretty but very tasty for what they are....a NO SUGAR healthy cookie.

These were very good. I did take the advise of other posters and added 1 ground up apple as apple sauce instead of oil 3c oats (1.5 of which I ground) 1/3 c of peanut butter a small handful of mini ahité chocolate chips 1/2 c brown sugar (made it just sweet enough) and 3/4 c pecans. baked as as bars same time and temp. But let em sit in the oven for a bit to cool off and finish hardening.

Not bad for a healthier snack. Definitely a keeper! So versatile!

I loved it


They were soft n chewy

I'm really trying to like these. I made them exactly following the recipe except for switching out raisins for dates. I didn't have any dates. They didn't stick together, just kind of fell in a puddle on the cookie sheet. I also checked them at 18 minutes & felt they were overdone. The second batch I cooked at 325 temp for 18 minutes. Next time I'll play around with adding the applesauce that many have added & making them into a bar recipe. They would also be good with the addition of my homemade pumpkin pie spice. Not sure I'm digging them all that much as written.

I was looking for a healthy cookie recipe that I could share with my family, that didn't contain loads of fat and calories and still tasted good. This was not it! I'm usually pretty optamisitic when it comes to eating healthy food, and I can find the good even in the less tasteful of foods, but this was not good!

I give this a 5 star due to the taste and overall nutrition.  This is MOIST, so do not expect a crunchy cookie. I used the 3 ripe bananas, vanilla extra, 1/2 cup honey, added cinnamon to taste, salt to taste, subbed applesauce for oil, omitted dates, used 2 cups oats, and added 1/2 wheat germ.  These do not spread, so you must pat down to desired thickness.  Next time I will add mini chocolate chips.  Will  also try somehow adding peanut butter as well.

I have to say that I really, really enjoyed these cookies :)  I LOVED the simple, few and healthy ingredients used, though admittedly, I did throw in some chocolate chips as I knew my boys would not touch them otherwise!!  I increased the oats by one cup, which I felt was needed, and based on a couple of other reviews, I did reduce the oil by half, but used half unsweetened applesauce in its place.  Be sure to flatten your teaspoonfuls, otherwise, you'll end up with cookie balls!!  Super yummy!

Yummy. I read everyone's reviews and thought I would have a 50-50 chance of a decent cookie. I substituted applesauce for oil and added dried cranberries, raisins, pecans, and walnuts. I omitted the dates. I really was pleasantly surprised. After I put the cookies in the oven, I kicked myself for not adding spices or brown sugar. The cookies do not need sugar. The raisins and cranberries sweetened the cookie. I will make these cookies again. They were super easy to make. Also, a great cookie for those of you who do not want to break your new years resolutions with sweets.

These were yummy, but I did make a few modifications out of necessity.  One cup of dates seems like too much, and I omitted them because I didn't have any.  I used 1/2 oil and substituted the remaining oil amount with natural peach applesauce, threw in a few white chocolate chips to balance the sweetness as well as some pecan pieces.  These end up being like portable oatmeal, and would make great quick & easy breakfast cookies.  Next time, I'll try maybe 1/2 cup of chopped dates, or dried apricots.  This is my new favorite way to use up ripe bananas!

I used quick cooking oats and these turned out not cookie like, but more like a health bar. It was pretty good considering it is health food. I found them pretty sweet despite that they didn't have any sugar. Instead of 1 cup chopped dates, I used 1 cup of a mix of dried chopped dates, pineapple, raisins, and figs.

Didn't really taste like anything..My 21 mo old daughter ate them,just fine.  I did not care for them.  Good for kids I guess.  Probably will make again as they are easy and she ate a few of them so far. (like to give second chances) Just kind of tasteless for adults maybe.  Like to make things that we both will enjoy eating.  I am not one who needs lots of sugar or lots of seasonings and spices in my food to enjoy,sooo go figure.  (I don't eat everything bland either! )

I made these with quick oats, chopped figs instead of dates (didn't have dates), peanutbutter instead of oil (great flavor), added 1/2  cup chopped semi sweet chocolate, and 1/2 cup chopped peanuts (to boost the peanut flavor.) Even with the additional ingredients, batter held together well. I formed them into 30 flat, round cookies and baked for 20 min. Nice banana flavor,  not overpowering. Nice cookie to make for vegan company!

Delicious healthy cookies! I substituted sugar-free applesauce for the oil, added honey, extra oats, and dark chocolate. The cookies browned nicely on a Pampered Chef stone.

These are definitely great for breakfast on the go.  I added a few chopped strawberries (and some extra oats) and  pecans.  I also threw in some ground flax seed for good measure, and to make them even more healthy.  As other reviewers note, they're not super sweet.  I'd never serve them as dessert, but for breakfast on the go or a quick snack, these fit the bill.

Amazingly sweet and addictive, esp. for such a healthy dessert. I agree they are not the crunchy, crispy cookie type. Instead, they're moist, soft, and chewey. I changed the recipe for 1 dozen cookies, but used the same amount the spices: 1/2 cup very ripe mashed banana (1 large banana), 3/4 cup rolled oats or other rolled grains (I used mixed triticale, oat, and rye flakes), 1 Tbsp oil, 1/3 cup mixed chopped dried apricots and dates, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp ground ginger, and 1 tsp ground cardamom. The ginger really brought out the sweetness of the bananas and was a nice break from the usual cinnamon/nutmeg combination. I also threw in some chopped nuts, but they didn't seem to add much as the oats are already chewey and crunchy. Mine only took about 17-18 min to bake.

Loved it - reminds me of banana bread bites... only reminded me of a cookie in shape only.  I read the reviews and I have to add - QUIT thinking these are cookies. Do not bring a platter of them to a party, do not make them for your bakesale and by all means do not bring these to a cookie exchange. The lack of sugar, flour and fat should be an indication that you will be setting yourself up for disappointment.  If you want cookies, make cookies with all the fat and sugar you want. If you are looking for a healthy breakfast or snack alternative these were delish!! I subbed 1/2 cup dried chopped dates for fresh that I further chopped in my processor. I also subbed 2.5 TB coconut oil for the veg oil and added 1 tb of triple seed mix (hemp, chia, flax) & a shake of cinnamon. I cannot wait to make these "bites" again.

These cookies are delicious.  They taste a bit like banana bread with a similar texture.  I substituted 1/3 unsweetened applesauce for the 1/3 cup vegetable oil.  I also added some chopped pecans, dark chocolate chips, golden and regular raisins, and dried cranberries to the second batch.  Absolutely delicious!

full points for health factor. use p.butter  instead of oil and you have basically a no sugar (xcept for what is in the fruits and p.butter),no flour, eggfree, butter free and preservative free cookie. i used a lot of nuts- sesame, almond and pnuts for crunch. added coconut essence, chopped apples and prunes, dried cranberries and few raisins. don't forget your cinnamon powder! just pack with your favorite fruit combo. i did reduce the bananas to two so it wasn't as chewy as my first try- i liked it better this time. to add even more crunch add the slivered almonds on top the cookie after you have shaped it, push it in just a bit so they wouldn't fall out. i did find i needed it to cook a little more because they were bigger and i wanted the bananas to carmalize. looking forward to trying new combos!!!!! the kids will love them.

Surprisingly good, and the kids love them. I wasn't sure these would work out at all, but I tried them out of sheer, morbid curiosity. They don't really taste like cookies to me. I'm not sure what they taste like, but they're not bad and I can't argue with the "healthy" part. The kids like them more than I do, but that's probably a good thing.

Made as written except used currants instead of dates (didn't have any). Also, added a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor...oatmeal can be a little bland.  Baked as bars instead of cookies. Husband really enjoyed them.

I absolutely love these cookies. You can sub in any combination of ingredients instead of the dates. I put in 1/2 cup chocolate chips chopped up, 1/4 cup almonds chopped, and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. I think the chocolate chips are a must. I took other reviewers' advice and used half applesauce and half vegetable oil. The texture reminds me of fiber bars that you can purchase more than a cookie. I loved having a snack in the cookie jar that was guilt free! I think next time I will try making them as bars.

I gave it a four star because I didn't like it with the oil. I modified the recipe and substituted applesauce for the oil. I used 2 1/2 cups of oats 1/2 cup applesauce and added a 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1 tsp. cinnamon. I also cut the cook time to 12 min. I like the cookies moist. I make two batches every week and eat the cookies for breakfast it's like eating a bowl of oatmeal in the form of a cookie. These go great with a cup of coffee

I am not a fan of dates, so I added 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 cup sugar.  These came out wonderful!  Much better than I expected, and they are still pretty darn healthy.  Next time I am going to replace the dates with chunky peanut butter, YUM!

Yum!! I'm always on the lookout for healthy yummy treats, and this one didn't disappoint.  I subsituted the oil for 1/2 cup applesauce, and since i didn't have dates i used prunes, cranberries and sunflower seeds. I also added an extra tsp. of vanilla, 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I cooked them for 15 minutes only, and the result was soft chewy deliciously sweet cookies!  If you're a fan of healthy sweets, you'll love these.  I'm excited to try them with dates, or maybe figs and lemon juice + zest instead of vanilla.  Will definitely make these over and over!

I was looking for a recipe that would allow me to use my two leftover bananas; most banana bread recipes called for many more than two bananas, but luckily I found this cookie recipe!  I omitted the dates (didn't have any), used quick oats instead of rolled (didn't have any rolled oats), added one tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/8 tsp. ginger, and a few pinches of salt.  I added some sunflower seeds to half the batch for some added texture/healthiness.  Next time I will substitute applesauce for the oil, but these were great how I made them.  Thanks for a great (and thankfully healthy) cookie recipe!

Delicious and nutritious! I added pumpkin pie spice and some cinnamon which spiced the cookie nicely. I didn't have dates, and instead I used dried cranberries (yum, yum). To top it all off I thought that diced apple pieces would work great and boy, oh boy, did that make all the difference. My new favorite GUILT FREE cookie!!!

These are excellent! I recently quit sugar and these relieve my sweet tooth instantly. I added a couple shakes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground cloves and raisons instead of dates. Next time I will flatten them before they go in the oven.

A great recipe, although I substituted peanut butter for oil, ommitted the dates, and added a handful of chocolate chips. A wonderful healthy treat! Although next time I will flatten the dough on the cookie sheet being that they do not spread at all, and are a little too chewy in the center

AMAZING!  These are so good!  They taste just like banana bread.  I did add a little more than a quarter of a cup of chopped walnuts as well as some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Oh and I didn't have dates so I used raisins instead  I will be making these again, and again, and again!

These were good but not pretty. I used really ripe bananas so they pretty sweet and I also substituted raisins because I didn't have any dates. Overall if i can get my kids to eat them this recipe is a keeper just not one I'd hand out.

Well, after being on a super strict diet, these cookies tasted absolutely fantastic to me. Mind you I had been deprived of anything even remotely close to being called a cookie for about a month. They didn't seem as scrumptious to my family or friends however, they complained of the lack of flavor. Definitely add lots of nutmeg and cinnamon. I also added mini chocolate chips to mine as well as raisins instead of dates. Also, they burn pretty quickly so you may want to keep the time in-between 15 and 20 minuets. Overall, I think its a great snack cookie that you can't feel to guilty about eating!!

This was a good recipe.  I am on a "no sugar added" diet so they were great.  My husband tried one and said "hmmm...dry but moist".  The outside gets a little dry if you let them brown but the inside is very moist.  I think it makes it seem more like a cookie.  He has had 4 or 5 within the first hours after baking and says he likes them.  I substituted dried apricots for the dates but everything else was as written.  I used VERY ripe bananas, I don't know if that helped the sweetness or not.  The cookies tasted like a very sweet banana to me.  I will take others advice and try some cinnamon and/or nutmeg next time.

More cake like than cookie. Nice and sweet without added sugar. My three year old loves them. They make a good breakfast treat. I followed other reviews and used applesauce instead of oil. I also pressed the cookies into the shape I wanted before baking as suggested since they will not rise or spread.

I added 1 cup of peanut butter and 1 cup of chopped pecans. I put them in muffin tins instead of cookies, and used oat bran instead of rolled oats because I had that on hand. Delicious, made them for church yesterday, already have calls asking for the recipe!

I have made these cookes twice.  Once according to the recipe, and the next time I made some changes.  They were excellent and super easy both times.  

The second time I made them my kids wanted chocolate chip cookes, so I substituted the chocolate chips for the dates.  I also added an egg (to add some protien), and used the Canola Oil with DHA and Omega 3 to make it a little healthier oil.  The egg gave it a slightly more cakelike consistency, but the kids gobbled them up!  

Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Used fat-free plain greek yogurt in place of oil, dried cranberries instead of dates and added a pinch of salt, 1Tbs of Splenda and 1/3 cup unsweetened coconut to counteract the tartness of the yogurt. Made a very sticky dough... but an incredibly tasty, higher protein, lower fat chewy cookie. Very very good! will definitely play with this one again!

These were wonderful!!  When done, I kept mine in a airtight container...which made them "gushy".  Does anyone think these need kept cool, since they don't harden like regular cookies?

These cookies are pretty yummy- even my picky eater ate several!
I used an extra cup of oats, added 1/3 cup honey, a dash of cinnamon, and used applesauce instead of oil. Instead of dates, I used chocolate chips.
I forgot to let them sit for 15 minutes after mixing, so I'm not sure if that changes anything, but the texture was slightly rubbery. I'll let them sit next time and see if it makes a difference.
 They are chewy, just sweet enough- and healthy, what more could you ask for? Perfect for an after school snack.

great base recipe. FAST, EASY, only 5 ingredients. vegan. what's not to love? 
i will use this a lot and will experiment with options. my inaugural batch was made with applesauce instead of oil, and instant oats instead of rolled, plus i added cinnamon, a tiny bit of nutmeg (which i will leave out next time), craisins, a few walnuts, and some choc chips. everyone (except me) loved them. i don't like dried fruit in cookies/breads, so that's where it lost me. but i bet if i leave out the dried fruit and just use nuts and or choc chips, it would be great. thanks!

Great alternative to sugar-filled cookies.  I love the base of banana an oatmeal.  Next time I will try applesauce but the oil worked nicely.  I used prunes instead of dates and added cinnamon.  They are like little oatmeal bites and I love them!  They are a little too rough in texture for my toddler, who doesn't have molars yet but when she gets them, this will be her sweet instead of cookies.

I always have a batch of these in my freezer. Over time, I have adapted the recipe to include more nutritional value by deleting the oil entirely and adding pureed vegetables (sweet potato, squash, carrot, etc.). For a special treat, I omit dates and add dark chocolate chunks or coconut.

I love banana, so I was intrigued by this recipe, but was skeptical that a cookie made with so few ingredients would be good. I was pleasantly surprised! I think the addition of nuts, craisins, coconut or chocolate chips would be excellent in this also. Thanks for a keeper recipe! :)

I only used 2 bananas and it worked well.  Used applesauce instead of oil.  Used 1/2 cup craisin and 1/4 cup raisin.  Added pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Next time: adding 1/2 cup craisin and 1/2 cup white chocolate.

Yum!  I made granola bars instead of cookies.  I customized this to what I had on hand.  I used dried cranberries and mangoes and per other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also added some pecans.  Instead of vegetable oil or applesauce, I used chia gel (1 tsp chia seeds + 1/3 cup water...let stand about 10min until it becomes a gel texture).  Thanks for sharing your recipe. I don't usually like butchering recipes then rating them, but I had to work with what I had and I just loved the outcome.  So good and good for you!

These vegan cookies were terrific!  I used dried blueberries instead of dates (my family loves blueberry/banana combo) and applesauce instead of oil.  Also spiced it up a tad with cinnamon, clove, allspice and ginger.

This is most definitely a 5 star recipe!!! Easy, quick, simple and DELICIOUS!! I made these with my kids and followed the recipe, except for using raisins instead of dates to cut time and the texture and taste are both AMAZING! Who ever knew that sugar-free cookies could taste so good!

I subbed the oil for apple sauce, and added some nutmeg and Cinnamon. I have to say, it was amazing, will defiantly make often.

OMG...these are to die for.  I made them with apple sauce rather than oil...added two table spoons of oil so they wouldn't stick and used trail mix.  These are the perfect healthy breakfast cookie.  I make them every sunday and bring them to work for a no guilt snack:)

Omigosh, I love these cookies!    Just like everyone else, I did make a couple tiny changes, but I can't say for sure if that had an effect on the final product.  With modifications, it's a 4.5.  Without, it's a 4.    First, I pureed the dates in with the oil (I used olive oil) and banana.  I also added in nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon, and chopped walnuts.  Finally, in regards to the "gummy" comments, I added in some baking powder.  (I 1/3'd the recipe, and therefore used 1/4 tsp of baking powder.  For the full recipe, you'll want to use 3/4 tsp baking powder.)    Mine weren't gummy a-tall!  They were dense, but moist, slightly sweet, nutty, banana-y, chewy, and fantastic.  Not cakey.  They are not sweet, just for fair warning.  I put a drop of agave on one when I served it to my Amor.  They were like mini banana-bread cookies.    I definitely recommend these.

These cookies were good, but need a few additions. This is a good base recipe to begin with and get creative. I did the following-  1) Added  cinnamon, as suggested by so many reviewers - it's a must.  2) I added coconut flakes to half the batch and compared with/without. (1/4 cup) I think it is a lovely addition! 3) A little honey helps too. (2tbsp) * tip* these were very sticky and even though I used parchment paper, they still stuck to it. I found the key was to move to a cooling rack immediately after removing from oven. With the few additions, they've become a crowd pleaser in my home. Thanks for sharing!

This was different. I think making them in cookies would have been a better idea than what I did - spread in the bottom of a loaf pan. They are very moist so you need to make them somewhat small to cook through. The flavor is good, the texture is not really cookie-like, but it's a different use for old bananas which we ALWYAS have lying around for some reason. Also, I used diced apple instead of dates because that's all I had.

I just have to update my previous review.  My husband and I both make these up, only now we double the batches and freeze smaller amounts in tight containers.  We have never put dates in them, but make them with craisins, golden raisins, bits of dried apricots, lots of pecans, and bananas.  The most recent double batch made were my husband's creation of one batch with 1/2c honey, bananas and lots of English walnuts, and the other half was with pecans, apricots, and craisins and bananas.
We are always trying to eat healthy and this recipe is a favorite or ours for that little bit of sweet flavor without sugar.

I was looking for a healthy sugar free yummy snack recipe for my 10 month old. This is perfect! I made small size cookies perfect for little hands! he loves them! I've made them many times already. I've also substituted applesauce for the oil to make them even more guilt free:)

If I could give it 6 stars, I would! It's absolutely awesome. I finally found a dessert that I can make that's healthy! I used REALLY ripe bananas and it actually was too sweet even though I didn't add any sugar. The dates were sweet as well so next time I won't use as ripe of the bananas. I also don't use oil so I used home made apple sauce instead. The downside of these cookies is that they are very high maintainance. It takes a while to spread on a cooking sheet making sure they are round (they come out just as you spread them). Also, it takes LOTS of time and patience to get them off the sheet without breaking them. You probably won't have that problem if you use oil instead of apple sauce. I don't use oil so I will continue using apple sauce - it's totally worth it!

I used applesauce instead of oil, and old fashioned oats that I pulsed in my Magic Bullet.  Also added 1/2 c ground flax.  My 10 month old thinks these are DELICIOUS.  I really don't care for them, but its a finger food for her.

These cookies make an easy, healthy treat for me, my husband, and my 1 year old daughter.  I don't usually use as much oil as the recipe calls for, just enough to be able to stir the batter.  We make them all the time!!

YUM!!
Just baked these half an hour ago and have already eaten 1/3 of the batch!

Porridge oats work fine if you don't have rolled oats, and I added chopped Brazil nuts for crunch and 1 tsp cinnamon. YUMMY CHEWY little cakey bites, can't believe they're so tasteful without any sugar!

The dates + ripe bananas make these "cookies" a bit too sweet for my taste. But that didn't stop me from eating them! I did add (b/c I had no spices or vanilla) some hot chocolate mix powder, which gave them a slight choco-taste. I think it was a good idea, although the vanilla that's called for is probably just as good or better.

for the fact that they are healthy-sugarfree-lowfat, they are good. i wouldn't refer to them as cookies though, maybe granola bites. definitely include spices like cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg. i added a 1/2tsp. of vanilla, sliced almonds, craisins for flavor and added chunkiness. nice and chewy.

Ditto with what everyone else said!  I used chopped dried apricots as I do not like warm dates.  The cookies are better in small balls rather than a larger cookie.  I added a pinch of salt, a dash of cinnamon and a tablespoon of honey.  I guess it seemed too easy just as it was!  Super for kids to help with!

I made these with my 4 1/2 year old son.  They turned out tasting so good and chewy, like granola bars, we loved them.   They were all gone in about two days (if that long).   We ended up making really about 4 dozen little balls at least, they had to cook a few minutes longer to get the brown around the edges, and I loved how there were so few ingredients and no eggs so my son could enjoy helping as much as he could.

Made these last night! From reading the other reviews, I did go ahead and use applesauce instead of oil and raisins instead of dates. I then added apples and cinnamon. They actually turned out very yummy!! The only thing I was unsure of is how to store them afterwards? After amount 45 mins the crisp of the cookies turned a little mushy. So, I went ahead and placed them in the fridge overnight and then this morning I popped one in the microwave just to see how it would taste. The crisp was definetly gone but they taste MUCH better warm(trust me, I tried it cold...yuck)!! Hope this helps. Thanks for the recipe!

Being a health nut, I got very excited about making these cookies due to raving reviews.  I really wanted to like these cookies but, they were just not as good as I wanted them to be.  Don't get me wrong, they are not bad tasting, they're just not what I consider a chewy cookie would taste.  These are, however, a great alternative for dieters, healthy eaters and infant/toddlers.  To my surprise, my 16 months old daughter who does not like cookies too much, loved them!  I will definitely make these again but, know what you are making, don't expect these to be of a cookie-cookie in which people are commonly used to.

These were okay.  The taste is decent, but not phenomenal.  It's good that they are easy to make and don't make a mess, though.  If I make them again, I'll probably try chocolate instead of dates.  That might help the taste a bit.

Okay so I also used:
raisins and walnuts in one batch,
almonds in another batch,
and peanut butter instead of oil.

I didn't think these cookies were sweet enough...they were tasty but just not  doing it for me as a "cookie' should.

I ended up dipping the bottoms of these cookies in melted chocolate candy coating  (used for making candy).

Next time I will probably add some butter and brown sugar....we shall see.

I understand this is a banana cookie, but know the banana flavor seems to overpowers whatever you add to it; chocolate chips, fruit, or nuts.  I like bananas, but I think next time I might just add 2 bananas instead.

This is a very different cookie, so different it's hard to rate.  If you want healthy this is it but we thought the banana taste was a bit overwhelming.  Also, it needed something more but we are not too sure what.  Maybe a bit of sugar?  Or keeping it healthy a bit of honey? It's a recipe worth trying but jazz it up a bit.

These were very bland. I even tried to jazz them up and add peanut butter as someone suggested. These cookies were not even worth eating.

I grew up on health food before it was even in vogue (50 years ago).  So I know you can make tasty, healthy snack food.  I followed advice to substitute with applesauce and made three different versions.  One,  as written except for applesauce substitution.  One with chocolate chips added, and one with nuts, dried apricots, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg added.  All three versions were equally uncookie-like.  The rubbery consistency in all three batches and bland flavor ...I couldn't give them away in my house.

extremely healthy and very versatile recipe... I definitely recommend applesauce instead of oil... after that just use a little trial and error and make them to suit your own likings... my first batch I divided into thirds using raisins in all of them... one used oil... next I used apple sauce and the last I added cinnamon and a little salt.... the ones with the apple sauce were actually more moist... other things I might try is pressing into a pan and making granola bars... also chocolate chips might be good as well as any dried fruit.. walnuts might also add a little crunch and help the texture... add extra oats as needed... and honey if you would like them sweeter.. also lower the oven temp to 325.. you can't go wrong with something as all natural as these... no sugar added....

I subbed out the oil for applesauce. Occasionally hubby uses the store bought lil cups of applesauce, and one of them is sufficient for this recipe. I needed a hit of chocolate though, so coated the bottom of the cookies with 72% cacao dark chocolate for the health benefits. A definite keeper :o)

If i ever make these again (though it's not likely), i will definitely reduce the amount of oil, maybe substitute it like some suggested. They tasted almost fine before baking... Not so good after.

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup raisins and a 1/2 cup walnuts in place of the dates. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. I then added some flax, cinnamon, nutmeg, and dark chocolate.

I had to make a lot of alterations the first time I made this. Here they are: used applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg, 1/4 cup of coconut flakes, 1 small diced apple, two handfuls of roasted peanuts, 1/2 cup of raisins, 1/4 cup of honey, 3 cups of oats, 2 ripe bananas, and 1 T of milk. I feel like I created a whole new recipe that's why I'm giving it 3 stars.  To me it just tasted like granola and not much like a cookie. The consistency was a a tad bit rubbery. The batter was delicious and the cookie was okay. Be aware that the cookies are impossible to shape into balls and they also fall apart. It would be better if you put them in a pan and made granola bars. I don't think I'll  be making these in the future.

I used diced apple instead of dates and also added cinnamon.  So yummy!  It tasted like oatmeal, apple, banana bread pieces.  I made them as a gift for my diabetic mother, but I can imagine they would be a big hit with the kids too.  Easy, yummy, healthy!  What more can you ask for?

Wonderful recipe! I may try the applesauce substitution for the oil next time. I also may had some walnuts, I think a little bit of crunch would be nice.

This is a really great basic recipe that you can change to suit your tastes.  For those who don't care for bananas like me, after they cooled they didn't taste like bananas.  I used peanut butter instead of oil and used dried cherries instead of dates.  I also added 1/3 cup of chocolate chips.  I'm so glad I found this recipe.  It's nice to have a healthier sweet that isn't too sweet.

SO GOOD! This is just what I was looking for. I wanted to start eating healthy but I find I get sugar cravings and hungry by mid day. This is perfect cause theres no added sugar and it's so healthy. I only made one modification which was dried cranberries instead of dates cause it was what I had on hand. I actually made an account here just to rate this recipe!

I made a half batch - they may be healthy, but everything in moderation... I kept eating them because "they're healthy"! They're good - but I could see that they're not for everyone. My bf wasn't a fan...they just weren't appealing to him. If you're a health nut or just want a treat that's a little more nutritious than a cookie, this is a great match!

They were just okay.  The taste was bland and the texture was gluey.  I added extra spices, but it still probably isn't worth making again.

I made this recipe and my whole family loved it (including my very picky 20 month old). I added chopped apple, dried cranberries and some walnuts to make them go farther and baked them in a greased baking dish. This made them into soft, granola-like bars instead of cookies.

Besides the fact that I added a cup of chopped walnuts and used golden raisins rather than dates, I followed the recipe.  These are good but would probably really be better if using applesauce in place of the oil.  I think the flavor would be enhanced by that addition.  While these look like granola, they are very soft.  Thanks for the recipe.

This received great reviews from the family. This is what I call a dump recipe - the recipe is great as is, but if you have leftovers of stuff you can dump it in here and it is just more greatness. I used apple butter instead of oil, a touch of honey, instant oats instead of rolled and put in a bunch of spices like cinnamon and allspice. I baked them as bars instead of cookies. They were very flavorful and chewy and made a great on the go breakfast!

We LOVE this recipe!  And I don't hesitate to say "yes" when my kids ask for more!  This was the first time we made these and made it exactly as the recipe said.  We used large bananas, so had to bake the cookies for about 30 minutes.  Next time, we are going to experiment and add spices and other ingredients!  I think pecans would taste great in these!  I'm so excited to have found a healthy cookie recipe that is also easy for my kids to make and experiment with on their own.

I love these cookies. They're almost like chewy granola bars. I think this recipe is a good base. You can pretty much add whatever you want into it. I usually add chopped walnuts, raisins, and cinnamon. I'm sure any dried fruit would be fine. Next time I will try craisins and almonds. I've also made these with chopped pieces of apple and applesauce as well, and they turned out great.  I also don't put any oil in it because it just makes it greasy. I make them into really small round bite sizes by rolling in a small ball and squishing flat with my palms. Then, I bake them at 300 degrees for about 15 minutes. These don't flatten out when you bake them. They stay the same size, so you don't have to worry about leaving spaces between each cookie.

Amazing...sooo good with applesauce instead of oil, a few dark chocolate chips, dried prunes and apricots, and a dash of cinnamon. So healthy and definitely satisfies my sweet craving! Mmmm

I really love cookies but im on a diet so I made these cookies thinking they would satisfy my craving for a cookies. I would not say they satisfied my craving at all. By the time you doctor them up to make them good the calorie count will be much higher. On the brighter side..MY husband loved them and so did i few of my friends!!

Excellent cookies.  I halved the recipe and added a handful of dried cranberries and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Yummm.  They are excellent right out of the oven.  Next day, not so much.  That's why I would recommend making only 1/2 the recipe.

I made these for my kids at the beginning of the school yr for snacks... My 5 yr old absolutely loved them! He even made a point to take 2 everyday to school for his mid day snack.  On the second batch I did drizzle them with honey after they came out of the oven for a little sweeter taste. Will def make them again!

The consistency was gummy and it barely had any banana flavor. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. A waste of good ingredients. The only reason it got 1 star was because they made my house smell fabulous while baking.

I have made these cookies a couple of times and find them to be delightful. I have not used dates, but rather substituted them for dried tropical fruit bits that I diced finely. The tropical fruit adds just the right amount of sweetness. I have also used dried cranberries and prunes, which wasnt quite as sweet but still delicious.

For ease of recipe and use of no refined sugars or artificial sweeteners I give this recipe 5 stars! For overall taste as written 4 stars...not much flavor. But I do think that this is a very versatile recipe that has a tremendous amount of potential for adding ingredients per your liking. Definitely things like cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, pieces of dried fruit, nuts/seeds, fresh chopped apples, pears, peanut butter, and even chocolate or carob would make this a very healthy and quite tasty treat. Both my kiddos kept asking for more! Thank you for a wonderfully healthy cookie recipe for my family!

I made these cookies tonight and they turned out delicious. I read the other reviews where some people thought they we'ren't very sweet. The key thing to remember here is that you're replacing sugar with natural sugars such as bananas and we used raisens. Our tastebuds are so spoiled by sugar that when we taste something without it, we feel it's not sweet enough. Know that what you're putting into your mouth/body will do you good. The only thing I wish it didn't have in it was the oil but whatever...we can't have it all. :-)

A very tasty, healthy cookie!  The whole family loved them and they were simple enough that the kids could do most of it.  I added 1/2 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice which was great.

I loved these. I was on a granola bar kick a few days ago, and I made these for myself as a healthy granola bar replacement snack. Halved the recipe and shaped into bars. Used applesauce instead of oil and they held together absolutely wonderfully. For me, this is a keeper. I may not need to buy packaged granola bars ever again. These are not overly sweet and do not taste like a dessert cookie, but I love them and they suit my purposes quite  well. Thanks!

This recipe wasis absolutely delicious and nutritious! I also substituted the applesauce for the oil, and added some diced apples, a little sweetener and cinnamon.  I highly recommend this recipe, not only due to it's nutritional value, but also because it is easy to personalize.  Just think of all the many combinations that can be made with the basics of oatmeal, bananas, and applesauce!  You could add a different kind of applsauce, as Walmart has many flavors. The combos from the fresh or dried fruit also let you be creative, while not compromising the nutritional value.  I give this recipe 5 stars!!

I love how guilt-free these are... although I added a little guilt ;) I'm sure this recipe would have been fine on it's own,  but maybe a little bland. These taste to me a bit like a granola bar type cookie. So, if you're looking for a fix for your sweet tooth, you won't find it here- think HEALTHY. I have a hard time not changing recipes, so here is what I did: added 1/2 C. flaked coconut (sweetened), 2 T. ground flax seeds, 1 C. semi-sweet choc. chips & 1/2 C. toasted chopped walnuts, 1 teaspoon cinnamon; I also reduced the oil a bit and added some applesauce to make up the difference. The cookies LOOKED like they had more chocolate than they really did because of the dark date pieces. Next time I might try adding some peanut butter and mini chips instead of the regular choc. chips, that sounded good. They don't crumble too badly, just a little on the edges if the cookie isn't shaped properly prior to baking.

The batter tasted good, the cookies smelled wonderful, the finished product... so disappointing. The texture was unpleasant and the cookies were almost tasteless. My toddler wouldn't even try one.

Healthful, yes. Tasty, maybe. The texture is not cookie-like or cake-like. Somewhat gummy. BUT, if you must watch your sugar intake, this is okay. I added nuts for crunch. Next time, I'll replace the oil with applesauce as suggested. It's better than no cookie! And, it's a better way to get in your oatmeal quota.

Absolutely delicious.  Don't expect a normal cookie because these don't even have flour!  I added 2 teaspoons of Splenda and used 1 1/4c sultanas and they were sweet enough.  I also upped the vanilla to a tablespoon, and added 1/3 c of peanut butter.  Great warm from the oven.

Simply delcious. I am always looking for egg free/wheat free items.  I used banana's because I had a ton of em on hand, but I used honey in place of the dates and applesauce in place of the oil (I was out).  If ya do what i did you'll have to add about a cup more oats to the mix to make the cookies "stiff".  My kids loved the batter sooo much i almost didn't have anything left over to make cookies with by the time i got done washing off the cookie sheet!!!

Wonderful! Everyone loved them and they looked so pretty! I did have a problem with burning and ended up cooking them at half the recommended temp., but they were very, very good! No one believed they were sugar-free either!

Awesome and delicious! I substituted apple sauce for the oil to cut out even more calories. I also put 1 cup Special K Chocolatey Delight instead of the oats to add a little healthy chocolate flavor - yum yum! Will def make again!

Very yummy! I added all sorts of goodies to my "cookies" and made them into energy bars. I added chocolate chips (SO good with bananas!), wheat germ, wheat bran, and some walnuts. This is a recipe you can really experiment with because it doesn't have any leavening in it. I'm going to try it with applesauce instead of oil next time!

I so wanted to like these, but can't even guess how to improve them. My husband said, "How can you not like these?!" He's less sensitive to the gummy texture and bland flavor. Obviously these cookies get a very mixed reaction, so you may want to try a half batch.

Great cookie. I used raisins instead and added coconut and cinnamon. My kids loved it. Very healthy and delicious thanks.

This is a good base recipe for a healthy cookie/cereal bar, however needs some doctoring.  I found it best adding applesauce instead of oil, cinnamon, dried cranberries along with the dates, and a few scoops of low sugar appricot preserves.  Also, in my opinion the baking time is too long and the longer you bake it the more rubbery they become so you may want to cut the baking time down a few minutes.  I had never imagined a healthy cookie so thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was awesome, especially considering it had no refined sugar in it!

I made it as written, substituting applesauce for vegetable oil and adding very generous amounts of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. I also shaped them like cereal bars instead of round cookies. The result was plenty sweet, maybe even too much so for my taste, so I might reduce the dates up to 1/2 the amount next time. The texture didn't bother me. I haven't made it without the spices, but I feel like they really brought the tastes together and were necessary.

These should be thought of as healthy fruit and oat bars.  I made these for my parents who were on a diet and my mom just loved them.  I did add cinnamon, allspice, salt, an egg white, and coarsely chopped walnuts to the recipe.  To prevent the problem of sticking and falling apart, I lined a pan with aluminum foil, sprayed it with Pam and made the recipe into bars instead.  This is a great healthy dessert or snack and can be easily changed to include your favorite fruits and nuts.

A very satisfying sweet snack. I added some pumpkin pie spice and extra cinnamon, and used raisins instead of dates. Think of this as a chewy granola bar instead of a cookie, and you won't be disappointed.

Very Good! However I made a few changes to this recipe. I used vanilla yogurt instead of oil. Added about three tbsp of honey. Also used rasins, dried cranberries,dried blueberries,dried pinapple,and slivered almonds to a total of about 1 cup. Plus about 1 tsp of cinnamon. I also flattened them out. Delicious and gooey.

These went over well at a bake sale, marked "SUGAR FREE".  They're more like granola bars than cookies.  I used raisins instead of dates.  Next time I'll add a generous dash of cinnamon, too.

They should not be called "cookies" because it's misleading and could be disappointing to some, but I thought they were a delicious healthy snack. They're more of a chewy oatmealy granola bar type texture. If you don't think they are sweet enough I encourage you to put a little more dates in. I made 12 servings and I substituted the oil with applesauce (1 to 1-1/3 ratio)! I am certainly going to make these again, maybe I will try some ginger/cinnamon and maybe raisins and nuts this time!

Healthy and tasty, absolutely loved the texture of these, will be making again and again and again. The only alteration I made was that I used applesauce in place of the oil. Thanks for sharing such a healthy alternative to chocolate chip cookies (and quicker too)!

These cookies are great little snacks.  I like to use peanut butter (instead of oil), cinnamon and honey in them for a little different flavor.  If you make them small enough you can mix the little treats with milk for a tasty breakfast!

These were yummy!  The children devoured them like candy - didn't even wait for them to cool!
I did substute a tin of fruit salad in place of the dates and added a 1/4 C raw sugar.
Will certainly make them again.

I think you need to grease the cookie sheet, if you use apple sause to substitute oil.  Mine got all stuck to the sheet, and had a very tough time removing them.  I added a tsp of honey, but next time I think I'll add more, or use brown suger to make it sweeter.

These cookies are  GREAT!  I praise you for putting his simple, quick recipe up.  I do not eat refined sugar (or aspertame), or dairy and it is always SO hard to find cookies recipie, much less GOOD ones! For anyone that is a health freak like me, I rcommend these.  If you're looking for something sweet though, I don't.  My dad disliked them because they were too plain for him.

I tried these cookies and loved them!  I have made them a number of times for friends and co-workers.  They are so easy and healthy.  I made them even healthier by using Sunsweet's Lightbake as an oil replacement.  I also like to play with the ingredients for new combinations.  I use only 1/2 cup of dates and a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for added color and zing.  I add a teaspoon of honey, too.

Bananas and oatmeal -- two of my favorite foods! This was so quick and easy, and I left out the dates, added some marshmellows and they were gone within two days! My boyfriend and puppy LOVED them, too. A perfect snack at anytime of day.

Great to find a cookie recipe with no milk, no nut & no egg -- which my son can enjoy. It so easy to make & very tasty. My only problem is not breaking the baked cookies when removing them from the cookie sheet, maybe I should try removing them after they are completely cool or slightly grease the sheet.

I love this recipe! I make a batch every weekend! Instead of dates though I add chopped almonds and cranberries. I also substitute the vegetable oil for applesauce. The last batch I made I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and some vanilla protein powder. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good and so simple to make! My two-year-old twins love them and have been devouring them the past two days and my two teenagers liked them too. I love that I can call them a cookie for the little ones and know that they are a healthy snack. I took the suggestions of other posters and used applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. I also used raisins instead of dates (didn't have them). I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon for flavor and, while they taste very good as I made them, I might try adding 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg next time. This is a keeper recipe!

I was really optimistic that these would be awesome.  While baking they smelled amazing but turned out tasting just so-so.  I used applesauce instead of oil and added quite a bit of cinnamon and they were still very bland. I'll try it again with more spice and a pinch of salt next time. On a side note, these make great healthy homemade treats for my dogs.  They love them!

These turned out great.  I doubled the batch.  I used steel cut oats.  Instead of oil I used almond butter. I used 1/3 c raisins 1/3 c craisins 1/3 c apricots and because I doubled it, for the second cup of fruit I used 1/3 c raw cashews, 1/3 c pistachios, 1/3 c dates.  I added about 1/4 c honey and a few tablespoons of 100% cocoa powder.  I baked them for 1 hour at 350 in a glass dish.  The bars were very much like good granola.  Very filling.

I made these out of curiosity. No, eggs. No flour. No sugar.   Taste = good.  However the cookie was delicate - meaning they want to fall apart.  Disclaimer - I live at high altitude.

OK I read about half the reviews.. I DID change the oil to applesauce.. THESE ARE super good and easy. If you are even contemplating this recipe its cause you don't eat cookies often from a package... These are guilt free and gluten free( I used gluten free oats) Don't be scared of this recipe..sometimes too many reviews that have been changed before even made ruin it for me... These are delicious if this is your thing..

I came across this while looking for a healthier use for my over-ripe bananas than traditional banana bread.  The comments were really helpful - I used natural peanut butter and chocolate chips instead of the oil and dates, cooked on parchment paper (no sticking), and the cookies are delicious!  Healthy, not too sweet and perfect for freezing.  Thanks for publishing!

These are healthy and taste good1 However they are much better with semi sweet chocolate chips. I like how they are not too crumbly and very moist.

Oh! This was such a nice change up for my normal bowl of oatmeal in the morning! I used raisins because it's what I had on hand. However, I'm sure the dates would be terrific. And this was so easy!

Amazing little bites. My son has not stopped asking me to make them. I make these all the time now. I add chocolate chips and substitute apple sauce for the oil.  I chill the dough during its 15 minute rest time.  This helps when I drop them onto the baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

I am a health nut who doesn't care much for salt or sicky sweet cookies, and this recipe looked very good. I followed other viewers advice and subbed the oil for applesauce, added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and even a tablespoon of organic peanut butter because I love it. The cookies taste is okay... but I found the texture of it to throw me off as it was gluey. It is not something that I recommend you trying unless you can somehow find a way to change the texture.

They're just ok. I did as other reviewers suggested and replaced the oil with applesauce. I also added about a quarter cup of ground flaxseed, a teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt, and about a cup each of dried cranberries and mini chocolate chips. The texture was a bit too rubbery for me, but I still ate them for breakfast with my coffee. I guess I prefer traditional oatmeal cookies that are crispier around the edges, but those aren't as healthy! Next time I may go back to the oil to see if that improves the texture.

Awesome recipe! I've been looking for something like this for a long time.  Made bars out of them:  I added 3 c. oats, 1/4 c. wheat germ, 1/2 c. dried blueberries+1/2 c. chopped almonds (instead of the dates), 1/4c chocolate chips, and 1/3 cup coconut oil!  Came out fantastic!  Next time I will spread in a longer pan for crispier bars.  Using a 9x13 pan makes chewy bars.  Drizzled some honey on top before and after baking.  Grrrreat!

This was terrific! I also read many reviews before baking. I also made changes. I did not have enough oatmeal on hand so I used 1 cup of oatmeal plus 1 cup of almond flour. I also added some walnuts, raisins, an egg, one teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of ginger. I used parchment paper. I forgot to press them down, so they were little lumps. But they were DELICIOUS little lumps!!! I'm hoping they will last in the mail to my kids. I hope this is listed in a gluten free recipe catalog somewhere! Perfect!

These are great as is...  I've also tried it with pureed frozen mango and strawberries (was out of banana) and dried mixed fruit - and they turned out great as well!!  Next time I will try not using the oil and use apple sauce instead as others have suggested to make it even healthier..

Great recipe!  I spruced mine up with  1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup ground flaxseeds.  Yes they are not overly sweet but considering the average american eats too much sugar, be thankful these don't have any of the white stuff.  :)

Healthy Banana Cookies is my go-to recipe for overripe bananas. I place brown bananas in freezer until I collect three or four. Let them thaw overnight in refrigerator and they are ready in the morning for baking.  Substitute different dried fruit for the dates to add variety.

These are great! I've made them at least 10 times now. Perfect kid snacks. I used coconut oil to make them tastier/healthier. I've also used raisins, cranberries, chia seeds, nuts, every time they have been amazing!

These cookies are actually tasty, the bananas really gave it a great taste. I too substituted some applesauce for one banana. I added almonds, which gave them a nice crunch. Great healthy recipe!

These are so good.  I used whole grain milled oats and craisins in place of dates.  I ate the whole first batch by myself.  I'm going to make some more and try different fruits instead of the banana.  I did find the banana left a small stain on my cookie sheets.

I love these cookies! I make them all the time. My two year old and husband love them too. Sometimes to make them that much healthier I will sub the oil for unsweetened applesauce. This recipe is genius and awesome for the diet!

I was *delighted* when I saw this recipe, because I've been wanting to make breakfast cookies--something to replace store-bought granola bars.  However, this recipe was my starting point and not what I actually made.  I'm sure they are delicious, but I didn't make these exact cookies because of substitution.  Thank you for the starting point, the instructions, and the baking time!  :D

This is my new favorite recipe! It's VERY versatile, and the dough is okay to eat. I felt okay even having a few with my breakfast. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added shredded coconut. It was so delicious. I can't go back to making any other kind of cookies.

They were great!!!! and smelled great, but what I did differently was I replaced the vegetable oil with more mashed bananas to make it healthier, I didn't have dates so I didn't use them, and I added 1/2 cup of roasted peanuts

Substituted in chocolate chips (for a slightly unhealthy twist) and added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  These turned out absolutely amazing!

Not what I'll be using my overripe bananas for anymore.  Granted, I did not put any dried fruit in, and I do think that would make them slightly better, but still not worth the time and effort.

Super sweet treat when your watching calories and want to maintain a healthy diet. I did substitute the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and added a touch of honey, a shake of pumpkin pie spice and half a scoop of my whey protein shake powder. Toddler did not like them but everyone else did!

I didn't really like these... but if I'm going to eat cookies, I want them to be sweet, and these were not.  However, all my "healthy friends" LOVED them! They are a great treat if you are trying to eat something healthy... but far from a cookie!

I love these cookies as an healthy alternative to just making banana bread from yet again. I usually just replace the oil with applesause and add cinnamon but a variation I make sometimes is to replace the oil with peanut butter and add a cup of flaked coconut. Yummy!

These cookies were just okay and I doubt I'll make them again.  They weren't done after 20 minutes and I ended up doubling the cooking time just to get the edges to brown up.  The middles of the cookies still seemed raw and cold like they need to bake longer.  I cooked a few until they were crunchy and they were a little better but still not great.

I really liked these cookies. I made them with cranberries instead of dates, with applesauce instead of oil, and added a dash of cinnamon. 
The banana flavor really came out nicely and had a "banana's foster" kind of flavor. My husband and I like to eat very healthy and this was a great option at only 40cal per cookie. Obviously they aren't as tasty as a big chocolate chunk brownie or something, but for a healthy alternative I really enjoyed them! 
Compared to a bad for you cookie I'd give 3 stars, compared to most health food I'd give 5 stars, so I settled on a 4 :)

I guess the key word is healthy. They weren't bad, but you can't expect a traditional cookie taste.

I have a horrible sweet tooth and I am so happy I tried these. I made a little batch to taste and I LOVE them!! I didn't have dates, but put in some plain sunflower seeds and they gave it a nice flavor too. Can't wait to make my first real batch!

Excellent!  Finally a cookie that makes me excited when my kids ask for another. These are great as is and would be just as good with any dried fruit you want to sub. The second time I made them I used raisins and added 1/2 cup chopped almonds and 2 Tbsp of maple syrup.  I also substituted coconut oil and they were heavenly!  A bit like eating baked oatmeal but they still give you that "I just ate a cookie" feeling.  I might add a handful of chocolate chips next time just to convince my 8 year old that they are WONDERFUL cookies.

I knew these were going to be good, because I kept eating the dough raw before I baked them.  The raw dough is so good that I would eat it as a raw vegan desert on it's own.  I don't have that much else to add to the other 500+ reviews, except that when my mom makes these, she uses good olive oil in place of the veg oil.  They still taste good and you can taste the olive oil at all.

I'm giving these a 4 because I changed the recipe and maybe if followed as written they would have been better, I considered giving them a 3.  I added wheat germ and flax seed, substituted apple sauce for oil. I also baked in bar form for a longer time period.  They are tasty for such a healthy snack but are not very sweet at all. I think I could have added more dates, or maybe honey to enhance the sweetness enough for my kids to eat them.

We are all trying to eat more healthy in our house and until now I've felt like my hands are tied not being able to bake my usual "goodies"! I also substituted part of the oil with applesauce. Great recipe - HEALTHY, fast, easy and delicious!

Great for young children if you don't want them to get hooked on refined sugar in their earlier years.  I substituted raisins in mine, as I did not have dates.

Not something I would personally eat, but my  1-1/2 yr old seemed to enjoy them (as well as our shih-tzu). I used Quick Cook oats, but was 1/4c shy of 2c. so I used a packet of Cinnamon & Apple Instant Oatmeal. I also used applesauce instead of oil. I adjusted the time to fit my oven (10-12mins). The cookies were moist, but not much flavor. I would definitely recommend using some sort of dried fruit for the added sugar to improve taste. They are a great on-the-go snack/breakfast for a busy toddler!

I love these cookies!  Super easy to make and so healthy.  I didn't have dates so I used raisins instead!  I also added flax seed approx 2T just to increase its fiber.  Next time though I will cut the oil down to 1/4 cup.  With three ripe bananas I don't think you need that much oil.

I made the recipe as written but left out the dates. I think my kids would have liked it better with some chocolate chips or some extra sweetness. I baked it in a 8x8 pan, increased baking time and cut into squares. I would make this recipe again and experiment with different ingreidents.

Fed these to a bunch of guys from church.  They went over great!  Very easy to make and sweeter than you would expect.  They do not keep well though - got moldy in a plastic container in about a week.  The molasses cookies I made the same day are still good.

i liked this!  i did do some of the changes that were suggested like substituted applesauce for oil, substituted raisins for dates, added cinnamon and cloves and 1/3 c. agave nectar.  then baked it in a square pan (about 25 min) ... did not come out dry ... but the opposite, moist and chewy.  will make again .... ( also tasted it before i baked ... it's yummy that way too!)

Very good!! I worked around the oil though, adding natural peanut butter and a couple egg whites instead to help everything stick... I also pureed the bananas and dates in the blender for a consistently sweet taste and added cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and walnuts.

I enjoyed these.  I cut the recipe and used two very ripe bananas, one cup of old fashioned oats, 1/4 c. no sugar added applesauce, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I baked them at 350 for 15 mins, really good. Next time I'll add nutmeg as well, and perhaps a little Stevia.

This is a very VERY healthy cookie.  Husband liked it but I did not.  Do NOT add peanut butter as an option...Wasted a lot of good ingredients.  Only gave it 2 starts because husband liked it (he is a health nut).

giving this a 3 because my husband and daughter liked it, my son and i hated it. if you were to make oatmeal with too little water, so it's really glue-like and thick and dry...and then add dried fruit to it, that is what this tastes like. my husband has irish in his blood and likes a thick, pasty oatmeal...i on the other hand, prefer my oatmeal a bit on the wet side...it could use some extra sweetness...maybe more honey, or a honey glaze? don't know...but won't make this again...

These are delicious!  I added a dash of cinnamon, about 1/4 cup of splenda, a little bit of flaxseed,  and an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I also subbed applesauce for the oil, which I think added to the flavor.  These cookies aren't exactly your decadent after dinner dessert, but they are a great sweet treat as a snack or for breakfast.  YUM!  Can't get over the banana flavor... better than banana bread!  Btw, I added chocolate chips to some, but I think I prefer without.

This was easy and a lot healthier way to use my ripened bananas than banana pudding! Since I didn't have all ingredients on hand, I used tips from other reviews and realized that the possibilities with the original recipe are endless!  Thanks so much for sharing this keeper!  As you can tell with all the exclamation marks, I am excited to have a tasty treat that is healthy and guiltless :)

4 stars for healthy cookies, but they were definately not for everyone.  My 5 year old liked them, and I thought they tasted much better the next day.   I was amazed that you could make cookies this way.  I did have the urge to add brown sugar but resisted.

These were so yummy! I substituted the oil for apple sauce and used craisins instead of dates. I also added a little bit of nutmeg for some spice. It turned out so tasty and I didn't feel guilty at all while eating them. I definitely recommend giving these a try!

Definitely need to bake longer, and the cookies are super moist so they molded after a couple days. They do taste good straight from the oven though, delicious with ice cream!

These cookies are like a cross of banana bread/cookie/granola bar. Delicious with just the right amount of sweetness from the bananas and dates.  They were nice and soft. I added some chopped almonds, a bit of ground flax seed and a little oat bran. I was out of vanilla so I threw in some almond extract and a bit of cinnamon. Great way to use my very ripe bananas.

I made these this afternoon. They turned out alright. I used apples instead of dates, apple sauce instead of oil and after my first batch came out of the oven I decided they needed some more sweetness. I added some raw sugar to the rest of the mix. I also added some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. They were a lot better after the alterations!

Only wish I had more dates and bananas to make a second batch! Yum! I added a little shredded coconut & some flax seed. I also added a pinch of salt. The bottom of my cookies got a little dark after 15 min but they were done by then so I was able to pull them out.  I really like them and so does my husband (the true test!).

These are too good to be true!  I've made them many times already.  I always used 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil.  I've added various extras such as dried cranberries, raisins, coconut, cinnamin, flax seed, almonds, pecans.  I make them tiny and somwhat flat.  I refrigerate the batter for 15 minutes before I bake them.  They are delicious!  I forwarded this recipe to lots of people I know and many of my friends have tried it and like it as well.  Thank you for a great recipe and keep them coming!  ~Did I mention that being the messy cook that I am how nice it is not to have to mess with flour or sugar.  A+++++

These were pretty tasty for being such healthy cookies.  I used applesauce instead of oil, and I added about 2 Tablespoons of honey.  They were really soft, not exactly normal cookie texture, but for the health factor, they were great!

These cookies are AMAZING! I decided to do a little experiment where I would be vegan for an undetermined amount of time. Craving something sweet (since I couldn't eat my usually chocolate), I found these cookies. While at first they tasted a little bland, I came to looooove these cookies. Now I always have a batch in the house!

good healthy treat! I also used applesauce instead of oil, added some diced pears, raisins, and cinnamon and nutmeg. I will probably add a bit of honey next time I make these to make them a little more like a dessert treat.

I used applesauce in place of all but 1 Tbs of oil. I also used chopped walnuts instead of dates. Good healthy way to use up over ripe bananas. I do think this recipe may benefit from a small amount of salt for flavor though.

I make these almost every week! These cookies are a great healthy snack, i usually keep the oil out and add honey. I change it up, too, with dried cranberries and mini chocolate chips. They taste so good!  (and are great for my digestive system)!

I will be throwing out the "buttered loaf pound cake" I purchased at the grocery store yesterday; because with a slight modification (raisin, date & walnut instant oatmeal) plus some extra pecans (simply because I love nuts), these cookies are the absolute best!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were okay.  After eating 2, then 3, the flavor grows on you.  And yes, these are more like chewy granola cookies than standard egg and flour cookies.  They actually taste wonderful if you are dieting!!

Rather good. I am a health fanatic so i used applesauce instead of oil which made the cookies a bit gummy. I think I would probably add 1/4 cup flour if I were to make these again. Overall good alternative to fat laden, high sugar cookies.

I like this one!  I don't add the oil I just use applesauce. Also I don't make them as cookies I put it all in an 8x8 dish that I line with foil and bake them. They come out like chewy granola bars.

Yep, it definitely is a healthy, sugar-free cookie!  It's still pretty good though.  I did follow other reviewers' suggestions (adding honey, cinnamon, raisins, and cranberries) and it did add more flavour!  I will probably be adding more cranberries and honey the next time I bake them.  Took me about 15min and they were just on the edge of burning. So I'm thinking maybe 13-14min for next time.

This is my go-to cookie recipe, though I do add about 1 tsp each cinnamon and pumpkin pie spics (i love cinnamon!) and substitute applesauce for *most* of the oil (about 1 tbsp still gets in).  Tastes like tiny banana breads but without the CUPS of refined sugar and shortening/margarine that similar cookie recipes call for.  You can also vary the 1 cup of add-ins; I've put in white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts, dried cranberries and chopped pecans, and a medley of raisins.  Yum.

SO So delicious!  I LOVE these cookies.  I added cinnamon (1/4 tsp) and honey (1/2 tsp) and SALT (1/4 - 1/2 tsp.)  The salt was a necessity! It gave them that buttery flavor without the fat!  These were graet! Thanks!

Loved these.  Surprised at how sweet they were.  I'm going to see if I can get away with a bit less dates next time.  Baked some of them in mini muffin tins and that worked great, too.

I guess I'm destined to be a junkfood-junkie.  I made these with such hope that a cookie could be "healthy".  Considering all of the positive reviews, I must've done something wrong. The only redeeming quality of these was the horrified faces that my 9, 7, and 5 year olds made after trying them (they made very funny faces.

Love this recipe!!  I did make a few changes.  I used applesauce instead of oil.  I only had quick cooking oats  and two bananas so I used them, and the cookies turned out fine.  I also added 1/2 cup ground flax (flax seed meal), 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, and a handful of coconut.  The dough was a little dry so I added more applesauce (eyeballed).  My cookies browned on the bottom an dnot the top.  So, for the second batch I used the broiler and browned them slightly on top.  Perfect!!!

I liked these a whole lot more than I expected to and was not expecting to leave a 5 star review. I am not big into health food, but these are yummy. I did of course make them a little less healthy, by adding 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 a cup of walnuts in place of the dates, but still these are good for you. I also added a few heaping tablespoons of peanut butter which I may increase next time to give them more protein and a peanut butter/ banana taste. Other reviewers have mentioned this but I didn't read them before making: these cookies will not spread AT ALL so flatten them out before you put them in the oven. Oh and also...my banannas were not ripe, so I called my mom to ask her what to do. She told me to put them in the microwave. I did, for about 45 seconds or so. It worked great and they mashed easily!  I'll be sending these to my little sister at college, and hopefully they'll be a good study snack for her.

These are amazing! Like most cooks on allrecipes.com, I couldn't help but modify the recipe, since I thought that the amount of oil suggested was too much and the dates' sweetness would take away from the banana's flavor.  I used 3 very ripe bananas, 1/3 cup small blueberries, 1 1/3 cups rolled oats, 1/2 cup quick oats, 1 teaspoon real vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon grapeseed/ extra virgin olive oil, 1 teaspoon honey, pinch of sea salt. I cooked them at 325F for 20 minutes on a greased pan (the first batch was hard to take off the greased foil). I like to get them as they're just starting to brown underneath. These are best hot out of the oven, and are meant to stay soft and chewy, so the term "cookie" is a little misleading.  I made a small batch without salt or honey or oil and they still came out wonderful and tasty! How's THAT for a healthy cookie? =) But keep in mind, I've been eating a very healthy diet for the last half year so my taste buds are very happy with less salts and sugars.

The cookies aren't bad, but could use a little tweaking. I had trouble getting mine to harden/get past the original doughiness. They weren't bad as gooey, slimy balls, but were a little messy and left hands sticky. 

They were a little bland and the amount of dates was a little overwhelming. Next time I'm going to use half the amount of dates called for, add a little more vanilla, and a pinch of salt. 

I also used organic rolled oats which I think didn't soak up as much moisture as generic oatmeal. Next time I will try Quaker instant oatmeal with the hope of cutting back on the moisture factor. 

I like the simplicity of this recipe and definitely approve of using fruit rather than sugar to sweeten. Good idea, I just think I need to adjust it to meet my own personal preferences.

For a healthy snack, this is a great recipe. I did make a pretty big addition though and added 1 heaping tablespoon of natural peanut butter, as well as a tablespoon of maple syrup, raisins instead of dates, cinnamon, and some ground flax seed. I'll make them again for sure.

These are great healthy cookies.  I can't believe the reviews that say they don't have any flavor.  How can anything with bananas and dates in it not have any flavor?  I did add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of freshly ground nutmeg the second time I made them.  But the first time, they were fine without the spices.  Do put 1/2 to 1 tsp salt in - anything with this much oatmeal needs salt.

Tasted like I was just eating raw oatmeal held together by a cooked banana...which I guess I sort of was. The texture was just weird...oddly chewy.  Wouldn't even think of making these again.

I made these awhile ago, and they are not bad for a healthy cookie. I think they are a great snack to take to work. It sure is healther than eating a cookie made of lard and sugar.

As written I would give this recipe 3 stars. With some tweaks I give it 5 stars. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, added dried apricots, dried cherries, raisins, and sugar free chocolate chips, 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (because I'm lazy and don't feel like measuring everything out), and I cheated and added 2 Tbs. brown sugar. They were fantastic.

I made these last nite. I added applesauce and an egg to substitute the oil. They didn't taste so great last night but after soaking in over night..it tastes much better. They aren't the BEST but they aren't the WORST either. I can see health fanatics enjoying this.

Hmmm...I have to say that they are growing on me!  The first bite was ok as the texture is a bit oily.  But the flavor is surprising!  It's now the next day and I like them better. I think extra spices are a MUST (I used allspice and cinnamon but it's really per your taste.) Given the fact that there is no refined sugar/flour I have to say that this one is a keeper.  Next time I will reduce the oil and figure out a way to fix the texture.  **UPDATE**  I took other reviewers suggestions & cut back on the oil & added 1 egg.  This did wonders for the texture!  They came out soft, but MUCH less greasy.  Yum...it's back up to 4 stars!

I used applesauce instead of oil and 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips instead of 1 cup dates. Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg. Had to cut the cooking time in half from what it says in the recipe. I and my husband both like them. They're a good alternative since we're both trying to eat healthier. With the chocolate chips and the bit of sweetness that comes from the applesauce, we don't miss the refined sugar and other junk that's usually in cookies.

4 stars is fair. These cookies were a nice change for me. I took a few to work and offered them to coworkers that I new would appreciate "sugar-free", and they seemed to like them enough to ask for the recipe. I used raisins instead of dates and added apples like previous reviews did, and can see how Walnuts would add another texture and flavor that would make them even better. I will probably make again,because I have so many diabetic relatives that would love them.

Wow, I really must be a slave to refined sugar. I found these very blah.  They definitely taste healthy, but they're not especially tasty in my opinion.  I don't like dates, so took the advice of other posters and added diced apple instead. I also substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I added several shakes of pumpkin pie spice too.  These smelled delicious while baking.  In an effort to tempt my kids to eat them I piped icing (confec. sugar and milk) onto them but my kids still didn't like them!  I don't have a dog, but perhaps the birds and squirrels in my backyard will enjoy a winter treat. Thanks anyway. Other posters seem to have enjoyed these, so I'm not dissing the recipe. But I think this will appeal more to the hardcore healthy eaters out there.

I can't believe that these are actually 'healthy'! I used raisins instead of dates, though - very good. These cookies taste a lot like muffins, very moist and flavorful.

i was looking to use up some bananas and i dont eat sugar or white flour so most banana breads are out. i found this and loved it. if you aren't looking for the typical lump of flour sugar and butter associated with the title 'cookie', these are for you, plus they are easy peasy! i used currents instead of dates, and added a pinch of salt, cinnamon, and a dash of a ginger/allspice/clove concoction i use in my oatmeal. fab.

These were a real surprise. It's the first time I've done any baking without sugar so I had my doubts but these were great. They held together beautifully (no egg required )and were a  really tasty guilt-free treat, that I'm sure I'll be making again and again. I used 2 tsp of cinammon and I definitely think some spice is required. I used a mix of dates, prunes and apricots simply because I didn't have enough dates. As long as the bananas are over ripe and therefore sweet I don't think it matters too much what type of dried fruit you use.

Delicious and healthy! I, like most, added a few touches to make this recipe my own, including: 1/2 t almond extract, 1/2 t salt, 1 t baking powder, 1/2 c shredded coconut and replaced the dates with raisins. They came out great! Very tasty and sweet too. Mine were done at about 16 minutes.

I only had 2 bananas and added one diced apple.  I used raisins instead of dates, too....the flavor was sweet for no sugar added, although the mixture was kind of hard to scoop into cookies--it kept on falling apart.  I will definitely be making these again.  A great guilt free snack or breakfast option.

Terrible cookies. Not sweet enough, but the worst part is that they don't hold together, but fall apart. they do stick to the cookie sheet (which makes it even harder to get them off in one piece)I am surprised at the number of good reviews this cookie recipe got. I liked the ease with which it went together and that it had very few ingredients. But, it just didn't work.

These are the sweetest sugar free cookies I have ever tasted!  I have a son that is a year and a half old.  I do not let him eat refined sugar and other sweets.  I am always looking for healthy treats that he can enjoy.  I made this recipe as a Valentine treat and he loved them!  He kept asking for "MO MO!!"  I used Canola oil rather than Vegetable oil.  I highly recommend this recipe for toddlers! * Be sure to use VERY ripe bananas and use the dates rather than raisins if you want a sweet cookie!  These are great!  You can also add chopped walnuts or pecans for older kids.

I think these are pretty yummy for a low fat snack, and my boyfriend says they taste like banana nut bread.  If you think they're too soft, chopped pecans will give them a crunchy texture.  The best part about the recipe is that there are no eggs, so you can eat some of the batter while it's resting.

I loved them, my kids and hubby wouldn't touch them. Next time I will use bananas that aren't so ripe that way the banana flavor won't be so potent. I used 1/2 applsauce 1/2 sunflower oil for the oil.

I let my 3 year old help me make these. She had a great time, as did I. The cookies, though, came out quite rubbery, but still had a great flavor! We used VERY ripe bananas, applesauce instead of oil, put in raisins instead of dates and added a bit of cinnamon.

Sorry, but made as the recipe states, I thought these left a strange taste in my mouth.  My husband, who said he has never had a bad cookie, won't even eat them.  It seems those who did like them "doctored" them quite a bit.

Tastes very good, but there was something lacking in this recipe.
Cinnamon, perhaps?
Because the bananas and dates are rather dull; although good, too.
Very very chewy and moist cookie.
In Quebecois, would be called a "gallette" if it helps anyone.

I used raisins instead of dates. I also used quick oats instead of rolled because that is what I had on hand. I made them bigger than suggested too. I am going to try them with pecans and cinnamon added next time.

At first I wasn't to crazy about these cookies. But if you put them in the refrigerator, after they cool on the cooking rack, it brings out the flavor. My diabetic friends just love them.

The cookies were VERY moist and easy to make, but the actual consistency seemed a bit soggy.  Next time I would add more oats, as well as MUCH more cinnamon and nutmeg b/c the taste was a bit lacking.  Overall, though, a good cookie that I enjoyed eating.

Weren't too tasty.  Sort of globby and bland.  However, my 14 month old seems to like them, and they're pretty healthy, so she can have as many as she wants!  ;)

Bleah!  I thought they were incredibly bland; my wife doesn't like sweet things so she liked the flavor ok although they gave her stomach cramps.  I substituted applesauce for oil, added about 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg, substituted dried apricots for some of the dates, greased the pan, and pressed the dough balls down to flatten them.  At least they didn't stick to the pan.  I baked them for a diabetic friend but I'm not sure if he'll want to eat them or not.  I tried adding some brown sugar before baking the second batch; still pretty grim.

Mild tasting, easy to make, cookies do not spread out while baking; I made them larger. Also turned down the oven to 325 degrees the final five min. to get a softer cookie.

I don't what I did wrong but these turned out pretty awful. I dropped them by teaspoonfuls and they came out the same exact shape they went in. Also, they stuck like crazy to the cookie sheet, even though I greased it the second batch around. I had to flatten the subsequent batches with a spoon. They tasted okay, nothing to rave about. But my mom who doesn't like sweet things thought they weren't that bad. Maybe I'm just a bad cook when it comes to sugarfree things. They sure smelled great and I was disappointed.

Good recipe.  I made two batches.  The first time I followed the recipe, and the second time I replaced oil with applesauce and dates with raisins and diced apples. I like the second batch better and would definitely recommend using applesauce instead of oil.

I am so surprised how good these are! I did substitute the oil also, and used part applesauce and peanut butter to make a full 1/3 cup. Also, I used raisins instead of dates only because that is what I had. I have been eating cleaner have eliminated sugar from my diet, but I do, at times miss something sweet. This cookie hits that spot!!! Thank you so much for this wonderful healthy recipe!

I’ve made 3 batches of these delicious banana oat cookies. I use either dried dates or apricots.
My teen age  son loves them. I like they don’t have added sugar . Great source of Fiber and really easy to make.

I made these last night for my husband who is trying to cut down on sugar. I substituted chunky (homemade) applesauce for the oil and they were delicious. I used golden raisins and you can easily add butterscotch or chocolate chips if you like. Vary your spices too with cinnamon or nutmeg, yum! Loved the texture.

I made a few changes based upon what I had on hand plus other people's tips and comments. Here is what I specifically used: 3 ripe bananas, 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, 2 teaspoons Captain Morgan sliced rum, 2 tablespoons honey,  2 1/2 cups old fashioned oats and 3/4 cup mini toll house chocolate chips. I used a one tablespoon scoop and flattened the tops just a little on the baking sheet. Baking time was about 25 minutes. DElicious, guilt free cookies.

I flipped through several elaborate recipes for breads and cakes that seemed like far too much work and was drawn to this the short ingredient list for these cookies; there was be plenty of opportunity for improvisation. I dumped the fab five into a bowl (oats, dates, bananas, vanilla, and coconut oil) and then remembered my flaxseed meal. And what about those sunflower seeds? How about the cashews? I didn’t forget the pumpkin seeds, either, and I added a little honey just in case. I cracked in an egg for posterity and spread the mixture evenly across my pan. Bars are fine for me; cookies are way too much work.

The verdict: Next time—and there will be a next time—I’ll omit the honey but leave the kitchen sink. A crowd pleaser, I had to warn friends not to eat too many. These fiber-filled cookie-bars are as “moving” as they are delicious.

I love to make this when I'm trying to eat healthy and I have some over-ripe bananas that I need to use. I do make a couple of variations based on personal taste. I use dried cranberries instead of dates, and I use unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil. Sometimes I will add a teaspoon or so of cinnamon also. The last time I made this, I used a handful of chocolate chips in place of the cranberries, and my 10 year old daughter LOVED them! There are tons of ways you can change up this recipe to make it your own. I'm glad I found it... it's definitely a keeper!

This was a good basis for a great recipe. I omitted the oil for applesauce, added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg as suggest by other reviewers and added an extra 1/2 cup of oatmeal to bring it to the right consistency. I love the way these cookies turned out. I think next time I will use dried cranberries or blue berries for a little more sweetness.

Chopping dates takes long (if you know a more efficient way than cutting them on a cutting board, plz share!)...but everything else is a breeze! Couldn't believe how good they tasted with this much simplicity. I am going to reduce the amount of dates next time to see if it reduces the sweetness, because even though bananas & dates are the only source of sweetness, they can get a little too sweet for my liking. Maybe that'll also reduce the dates chopping time.

They tasted more like a mix between fried banana and oatmeal. I made them with the intention to bring them to a party, but after tasting one after baking I decided that I couldn't because they really aren't party food. They are more of a breakfast granola bar-y type food.

I used raspberries and blackberries and 1 cup of oat clusters verses two cups of just oats. They turned out pretty good. It is a neat texture.

I really love the concept yet they did not bring much flavor.  I used other reviewers suggestions and sub'd peanut butter and raisins and added cinnamon, gr. ginger and flaked coconut and I still thought they were a little bland...yet it is a great idea and I will keep playing with this.  thanks so much.
UPDATE. I refrigerated them and after a few days the flavor improved...so I am adding a star. Really great, fast, healthy breakfast.

Good recipe. Make sure the bananas are really ripe so that they are sweet. I used applesauce (unsweetened) for the oil and dark chocolate chips instead of dates, though I'd like to try them later because I love dates. Good as bars too.

This is a good recipe to change up all kinds of dried fruits.  I always add a little cinnimon to bring it all out a bit more.  I would really like this with nuts, but, of course, this brings up the calories.

I tried this recipe because I recently started a diet, which means no conventional desserts. But this isn't a conventional dessert; the only sugar is what's naturally in the bananas and dates! When I eat these I feel satisfied, not deprived. Even my non dieting family loves them! They are very easy to make and taste very good. I like to make a double batch and bake them as bar cookies for the same amount of time.

I don't much like dates, so I put in a small bag of dried berries and nuts mix. Applesauce instead of oil too, and a sprinkle of coconut powder and Mixed multi floral pollen seeds. It's delicious!

I omitted the dates and subbed chocolate chips.  These taste more like chewy granola bars than cookies.  If this was a granola bar recipe I would give it 4 stars.  Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS but NOT LOW CALORIE - These cookies very tasty and seemed extremely healthy since you cut out the flour, butter and sugar of regular cookies... Howver, beware! These cookies were small and they pack over 150 calories per cookies due to the vegetable oil used and the calorie content in the oats and dates

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I had to make some adjustments to make this a 5 star recipe.  I made this recipe TWICE and think I have finally perfected it:

1) Instead of oil, use 2 lunchable size applesauce (per other reviewers, thank you!)
2) use 2 cups oats and 1 cup low fat granola for more crunch, because this cookie is very soft.
3) for my personal preference, I added a diced apple, raisins, 1/4cup walnuts for more flavor and texture since I don't like dates.
4) bake at 350 for 30 minutes...I shaped my cookies into normal sized cookies, so they needed longer baking but trust me its worth it!

Overall, this recipe is a great foundation and very easy to tweak to your own liking! Love this recipe, I will always use it :) My boyfriend who doesn't like to eat "healthy" actually devoured these cookies!

These just were not my thing, I used the applesauce that others suggested and added cinnamon but they were very bland. They also had a weird texture that was hard and chewy. A lot of people seem to love them and they are cheap to make so I say give it a try you might love them too. I think maybe adding some other fruit might give it a little extra flavor also.

Took some top reviewers' advice and substituted unsweetened applesauce for oil, spiced rum for vanilla, chocolate chips for dates (not as healthy but worth it for me!). Also threw in some cinnamon and nutmeg. Four stars for a great base recipe! This isn't your typical ooey gooey, super-sweet cookie so don't expect it!

Delicious, And so easy! I did a couple small changes - used 1/4 cups of raisins and 3/4 cups of dates. Also added in 1/4 cup of pumpkin seeds. In addition I added in 1/2 cup of Orange Juice for sweetness. Came out fantastic. I will be making these again. And again. :)

These are great! They stay soft for quite a while. I made modifications; rather than water I added vanilla and I also added dried cranberries. Would definitely make this again.

I make a version of these cookies that uses applesauce and 1/4 c almond milk in place of the oil, and add raisins, dried cranberries and pecans.  No flour, no added sugar and no dairy.  These cookies were a different kind of sweet than I was used to but grew on me quickly....they are great for breakfast with some almond milk!

We really liked this cookie.  I did substitute walnut oil for the vegetable oil and I also added 2/3 cup ground flax and an additional 1/3 cup oatmeal.   With these changes my cookies ended up crispy on the bottom and soft and chewy in the middle; the way we like them.  If you like a real crispy cookie, I wouldn't add the additional ingredients the way I did.   My cookies only took about 15 minutes to bake.  I'm thinking next time I may bake them as bars instead of cookies.   I really like this recipe as it is so flexible and easy to change to your family's likes and dislikes.   BUT, again, these are a healthy cookie so don't expect anything real sweet.   Thank you for sharing, K, I'll be making these often!

Not bad as far as healthy cookies go. I used sweetened cranberries instead of dates. and would also consider adding semi sweet chips if you want a little bit more of a "cookie" taste.

These were great!  Loved having a healthy option for cookies.  My husband even loved them - snatched a few right out of my hands.  I used applesauce instead of the oil.  If you do this, make sure to grease the cookie sheet!  Going to try to add some spices like other reviewers recommend the next time I make these.  I have a feeling these are about to be a common food available at our house.

My hubby and I ate them all! We used chocolate chips. Next time I'm trying the apple sauce version and I'll probably bake them as bars, as you definitely do have to keep an eye on them so they don't burn.

Very yummy and way healthier than regular cookies! I agree with one reviewer-- these are not the typical dessert type cookies. However, that being said, they still turn out pretty sweet without any additional sugar. I did the following: used total of 3 cups of rolled oats, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves and substituted oil with 1/3 c homemade applesauce (recipe on allrecipes: apple sauce). YUMMY! PS- the more ripe the banana, the sweeter the cookie. Next time I plan on using a green banana and see how that tastes!

I'm giving these cookies four stars because I made revisions based on other reviews. I mashed three bananas, stirred in 2.5 cups of oats, 1/3 cup of honey, 1/3 cup of cinnamon apple sauce, 1 diced apple, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Next I lined a baking tray with wax paper, sprayed it with Pam (the first batch I didn't spray Pam and they were a pain to get off without having the paper baked on the cookie), and shaped my cookies on the sheet (they don't spread as other reviewers noted). Baked at 350 for 20 minutes produced soft, chewy, delicious cookies. As you can see from the photo I made small cookies for a company potluck, the reviews were great.

These were exactly what I was looking for! A healthy cookie that tastes good, not too sweet, but still a great snack or breakfast on the go. I used raisins, craisins, candied ginger, coconut, and nuts. The sky is the limit when it comes to flavor combinations! My teenage boys liked them too.

Chewy, tasty, filling, and healthy. The brilliance of this recipe is not just the wonderful cookie it makes but also the versatile use of healthy ingredients to do so. I look forward to exploring the endless possibilities of turning to fruit in place of refined sugar and eggs in my desserts.

I was so excited to find a low sugar recipe for my diabetic husband but was very disappointed with this recipe.  Even though I baked them much longer than the original recipe, the inside remained completely mushy... not a desired consistency.  Would NOT recommend.

this is an awesome base recipe. i had been looking for something i could make for my one year old for breakfast that's quick, easy, and healthy, and this works perfectly. I didn't add the oil, i just threw in an extra banana, and i didn't have dates, so i just chopped some spinach and carrots and mixed that in as well. i thought it would be pretty plain, so i also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and a little allspice, and it turned in to a super healthy breakfast cookie- you can't even tell the vegetables are hidden in there.

I love these cookies!  I followed suggestions and used applesauce instead.  I  made two batches; in both I added about two heaping tablespoons of peanut butter when mashing the bananas (so yummy!)!  In the first batch I also substituted the dates for dried cranberries, since I had them around.  They were a little tart, and couldn't really taste the peanut butter over it, but added a great kick to the cookie!  In my second batch, I didn't add the cranberries at all, and added a bit more peanut butter.  Thanks to Elvis Presley for the amazing peanut butter/banana idea!

I would definately throw in some walnuts or even chocolate chips and use apple sauce (but not too much) instead of oil. The cookies definately grow on you. Not too bad for "healthy cookies"

I didn't have dates so I used apricots instead.  My toddler gobbled these up and begged for them, but I didn't think they had enough flavor for adults.  Could be great with some modifications!

I tried to like this but mine were to gooey rather than being chewy.  I followed exactly minus the oil;  I added applesauce instead.  I might try the recipe once I figure out what it's missing...maybe I need to add brown sugar.

utterly HORRIBLE! pity I wasted my bananas on these, they were so bad. I would definitely suggest adding some of the extra ingredients mentioned in other reviews otherwise all your going to get is a gross tasting spongy mass of oats,dates and banana.

I think these were great, but took off one star because they could use a little more spice. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a tad of ginger. Also added raisins, wheat germ, flax seed, and chopped walnuts. And to make it healthier, as other reviewers added, use applesauce instead of oil--worked perfectly. Overall they are a great tasting cookie and a really healthy alternative.

My 11 year old daughter wanted me to give this recipe 5 stars.  She needed a healthy treat for Valentines at school so we made these (substituted chopped raisins for dates) and pre-shaped them into hearts by pressing the uncooked batter into a heart cookie cutter.  They held their shape when they were baked.  Yummy results!

I made a lot of changes to this based on other reviews, so I want to warn others what to watch out for.  I did not have dates or raisins, so I replaced with chopped apple.  Really needed the extra texture and sweetness a dried fruit would have added.  I also substituted apple sauce for the oil, which I think was okay.  Texture was good, but despite adding honey, cinammon, and allspice they were missing flavor.  That being said, my 2 and 4 year old still ate them up for breakfast.  I will make them again, just didn't love those changes.

Not your real cookie but good for a change.  I used other reviewers ideas to sweeten things up a bit.  I used 3 cups of oats, 1/2 apple sauce 1/2 oil, 1/4 cup of brown sugar and used chocolate chips instead of dates.  Nuts would also add a good flavor for the future.    
I like this recipe overall especially for those who are having to watch their sugar intake.

My kids and I love this recipe, but always make it as bars. It is super versatile by adding whatever dry fruit or nuts I have on hand. You can also add a dash of fiber powder to up the fiber count. Thanks for sharing!

Ew, these are icky. They need some sweetness, sugar, honey or something. I used very sugary bananas and applesauce (not oil) and raisins, but that didn't help much. I was making them for a friend's house but now I'll have to find a way to make them better before I go - maybe drizzle glaze over the top. Less healthy but yummier for sure.

These only turned out okay. No one really liked them and they tasted bland. Sorry but I won't be making again.

1st time we made we forgot to add the vegetable oil and it was gross.  The 2nd time we remembered but substituted raisins and cranberries for the dates.  We also added 1 chopped apple and some cinnamon and nutmeg.  We added some chocolate drizzle to the cookies after they were fresh out of the oven.  They were delicious.

I liked this recipe since it was so easy, I modified a few things: added cinnamon and some sugar, added 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of dates.

I am also going to try this recipe with apple sauce instead of banana to make it apple cinnamon flavor and see what happens :)

Delicious!  I used someone else's custom version using honey and apple sauce instead of dates and oil but I added just about everything!   I put in coconut flakes, chocolate chips, raisins, sunflower seeds and flax seeds.  An amazingly healthy snack for my daughter but still so yummy!

Great cookies.  I make them very often, vegan, gluten and wheat free, no added sugar.  Can even eat them for breakfast, dessert or snack.  So easy and inexpensive.  Couldnt ask for a better cookie.  I also add 1 tbsp flax seed in 3 tbsp or so of water in the blender then mix into the recipe as this acts as a binder and they can come apart after cooking without this.  Also I add cinnamon and then figs or raisins or dates.  Any kind of nut.  Great recipe!

These are great cookies! I used dried strawberries instead of dates and 1/2 of apple sauce instead of the oil, so I made them even healthier! They are very nice and smooth; they just don't look or taste like a regular cookie, so cookie lovers will be disappointed, like my wife and kids. I think that many cookie lovers expect either a chocolaty or sugary taste, and these will be left with the feeling that something is missing. But I am amazed that you can actually fix cookies without butter, flour, shortening and, most amazingly, sugar! These are actually good for you!!! You can eat them not only without a guilty feeling, but knowing that these are good for your health: full of vitamins and antioxidants!

sub'd 1/2c apple sauce for the oil, rasins for dates, added 1/2c pecan halves, bout 2oz sunflower seeds, 1tbsp honey, 1/2 tbsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnimon, lil nutmeg, and pinch of salt. The BF said they taste like "babyfood". They came out like a meaty banana nut cookie, bet if I cooked them a lil hotter or longer they would have been crisper...I like!

My whole family adore this recipe for me they don't hold together as cookies so i bake like a cake and always double it and add dried cranberries and use applesauce instead of the oil the first time i made them i used oil and it was too oily so i changed to applesauce after reading about it here and my son, my husband, nieces, everyone te3ars them up. Going to introduce them to my family from Cali at a baby shower can't wait for their reactions.

This is a very good cookie! It helped curb my craving for chocolate chip cookies. Not quite the same, but close enough! I followed the directions, except I substituted applesauce for the oil. I also used raisins and chocolate chips instead of the dates. I would like to try chopped apples next time. I was able to get 32 cookies using my Pampered Chef scoop. I baked them for 15 min. If you do Weight Watchers, 2 of these cookies = 1pt!

These were okay. I added chocolate chips instead of dates, and also added some walnuts. Even with the chocolate, the cookies weren't very sweet and didn't have a lot of flavor. Maybe they would be improved by adding a little sugar?

I have to say, I was impressed. My son is a diabetic and has sworn off sweets. He was a sweet lover. The carbs and sugar content in here is doable. I made them for the first time and used the dates but used applesauce in place of the oil and just sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg in for added flavor. I tried one cookie and it was sweet, moist, chewy, very flavorful. The banana wasn't overpowering. This mixed up and baked up in no time. This should certainly satisfy any sweet lover's craving as well as a healthier version of a cookie. Would highly recommend it. I also used parchment paper which releases the cookie completely with no problems. I would definitely recommend using it. Cleanup is a no brainer, just rinse and put the pans away.

I love these! I did everything except that I only put 2 bananas (only because I didn't have enough) and I also substituted the oil for ground flax seeds. You can't taste the difference!! Being a health nut, I really like these. A lot. :)

These are wonderfuland my kids gobble the first batch up before I can make the second. I use dates or chocolate chips and applesauce (slightly less than the called for oil) instead of the vegetable oil and I feel like I am eating a cookie but they are actually really good for you! I always double the recipe and usually make it in a 9x13 pan and cutting them into bars. Super easy. They make a great snack for the kids and me.

MAKE THESE COOKIES!  Easy, easy, easy -- and deeelicious!  :)  And VEGAN.  Oh, did i mention EASY?  I made some minor changes:  I ground the dry oats first, in the blender.  I halved the recipe.  Don't do this, if you don't have to.  I used raisins instead of dates (only 'cuz i didn't wanna use up my dates; and i used about half the amount of raisins that half the recipe called for -- it was plenty; if using dates, that may be different).  And i greased the cookie sheet first (because someone had recommended it).  It yielded 12 cookies.  I measured the cookie dough at approx. 1 Tbsp.  AND i flattened the cookies out before baking, per someone's recommendation.  Easy, easy.. and lots of suggested variations from other members on here.  I will make these again.  THANK YOU!!!

As far as healthy snacks go, this one is definitely a winner. I love the limited use of ingredients and the fact that these are completely egg and dairy free. I also substitute the oil for unsweetened applesauce and leave out the dates so that my 9-month old can enjoy them with me.

Very good.  Not amazing, but good.  They taste mostly like a mashed banana, with a little oats to hold it together.  They did hold together surprisingly well for not having any flour or eggs, and cooked up nicely when flattened on the pan.  I would probably prefer a banana cookie with flour to this one though, in the future.

I love these cookies...I did add pecans,raisins,nutmeg,and cinammon to them....the pecans really give them a more banana bread taste! Unlike most of the reviewers I didnt feel they needed sugar..thought they were plenty sweet. What a great recipe!!!

I loved these, but I love health food and no one else was interested in them.  I used applesauce instead of oil and honestly I think that improved them.  I also used raisins because that is what I had, but I bet they would be better with the dates originally called for.  These are not really cookie cookies.

These taste really good, the dates add all the sweetness, no sugar needed at all. I added a pinch of cinnamon. I would have like those better if they were crunchier. But its a definte healthy alternative.

Excellent recipe!!  I was a bit sceptical as I have never made a cookie recipe without flour or eggs but this is great!!  I did add a couple of things.....1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp ground flax seed, and instead of dates (didn't have any) I used craisins.  10 minutes after they came out of the oven we ate almost half.  The one thing I will do next time is reduce the oven heat to 350 for 20 min.  I have a convection oven and they were a bit over done around the edges and a couple where a bit soft in the middle. Thanks for the great recipe!!

OK,  these were alright, too soft for me, I was looking for something a bit more crunchier, Defenitely healthier, and I used raisins, so this gave them the sweetness of a cookie.

AMAZING! Switched the dates for craisins. Also added a tsp of cinnamon. I let them sit over night, which enhanced the flavor. Brought them to work and was worried that they'd be "too healthy" tasting for people but, surprisingly, people really enjoyed them! Had numerous people ask for the recipe and were shocked to find there was no sugar or flour in them! Definitely recommend!

What a fantastic idea. I actually only used banana, rolled oats, and apple sauce instead of oil, being they were the only ingredients I had on hand. I also added in some cinnamon for more flavor. I have to say I absolutely loved these, because they satisfy my craving for sweets but I don't have to feel guilty about it! Makes a wonderful breakfast. I can see why these wouldn't be for everyone though. Simple but great! Thanks for the great idea.

Great Recipe. Make sure you use teaspoons and not tablespoons... (like I did) and it should turn out fine. I never knew you could make cookies like this!

I really liked these!  My kids haven't tried them yet, but I added chocolate chips in half the batch for them to eat.  Otherwise I left out the dates, added more oats, substituted the oil for applesauce and added an apple.  Very yummy!!

This really isn't a "cookie", it's more of a "granola bar-ish non-sweet treat".  The word "cookie" in the title is misleading.  As someone looking for a delicious but diabetic-friendly treat, this was very disappointing.

Easy/healthy/quick recipe. Ingridients are almost always on hand. You can put any fruit/nut/spice combination in it, very forgiving recipe.  Makes a great mid-day tea snack!!!

Took a lot of the suggestions listed, I added craisins and chopped walnuts and they turned out perfectly...I like them.  My 18 year old son did not...not sweet enough for him and anything that may be healthy is not on his radar. :)  Made this for my sweethearts nine year old son who is borderline diabetic...sending through the mail so hopefully he'll like them. :)

really good!!! Instead of dates I used dried fruit bits ( comes in a bag on the baking isle) this gives great variety of all dried fruit. I used 1/4 cup of oil instead of a 1/3. Added some chopped almonds and a little coconut. doubled the vanilla extract and added some cinnamon. Yummo~

I give 3 instead of four stars because even with VERY ripe bananas, it definitely needed a couple of tablespoons of honey or something (I used Agave nectar).  My kids loved it and I liked something sweet that was pretty healthy. . I didn't have apple sauce to lighten it, but overall if was an ok recipe and I will make it again. Thanks.

I think you could add some carob chips to make them sweeter, but I like them. I'll try them with applesauce next time to make them even lower in calories. Also, a prior reviewer mentioned that you should turn them at about 7 minutes: this is good advice. If you don't, they'll burn.

I am very much into eating healthy and every once in a while desire a snacky treat. These accomplished the task. However I do not think I would serve them to anyone, nor would anyone else in my family eat them. I did use olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and I did try to jazz them up a bit by adding 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and a handful or two chopped walnuts and they still lacked flavor. I do think they have potential with a little more tweeking. I think maybe raisins would have lended more sweetness and texture than the dates. Just my two cents.

This are quite yummy, especially for a healthy snack. The only thing I would recommend is to flip them at seven minutes because the bottoms of the cookies tended to burn when I didn't. Other than that, love em. Keep coming with the healthy recipes!!

These are surprisingly delicious.  I actually made two batches this week.  The first batch I made exactly as the recipe states, the second batch I substituted applesauce for the oil...both batches were fantastic.  I don't see how you could possibly get 36 cookies out of one batch, I think I got maybe 18-24, max.

I too replaced the oil with applesauce. Used mostly dates and a few mini chocolate chips. Next time I'll add a tad of salt, as they taste pretty flat, but pretty darn good for the calorie content!

I substituted oil with applesauce, and dates with honey. The cookie is kind of rubbery and a little sweet, but that's what you get for wanting to cut calories.

GREAT! I changed the dates for raisins and sprinkled a little little bit of brown sugar over. So delicious and healthy!

Love these cookies! I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil and they turned out great! I also added nuts to give it some extra crunch. I didn't have dates on hand, but threw in some craisins and spices. I have made them 3 times and have used different nuts and spices in each batch using the oats, bananas, vanilla and applesauce as the starter. I am just amazed that these turn into cookies! No flour, no sugar...amazing! Thanks!

These are very, very good and healthy! I used chunky applesauce instead of the oil and spiced rum instead of vanilla. I also added about 1/3 cup honey and another 1/2 cup of oatmeal, and left out the dates.

I think these are probably an acquired taste . . .they definitely are a healthy cookie!  I will take them up to bf's parents for Christmas since they are both diabetic.  They are crumbly but not so bad if you try not to think of them as cookies but as a granola-y snack.  I used cranberries instead of dates, and I like other reviewers suggestions to add cinnamon and nutmeg.  I didn't this time but think it would help with the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Okay... I would definitely add some honey or sugar to this recipe. I made it as the recipe is laid out and they were pretty tasteless. There was no flavor. So I added just a little cinnamon and sugar and that helped a lot.

I love this recipe!  I was looking for a sugar free cookie recipe without artificial sweetners.  And this one is great.  It's mildly sweet and super easy to make.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and substituted applesause for the oil, thereby making them even more healthy and they turned out perfectly.

I only had one banana, so I made the recipe for 12.  I was out of rolled oats, so I used almost 2/3 cup oat bran instead.  I didn't have any dates either. I did, however, add 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, and a handful of chocolate chips.  They taste good with a chewy, gooey texture.

These were extreamly tasty and easy as well as versitile. I couldn't fine dates in my grocery store so i replaced them with dried, chopped apricots. Had abit of trouble making them into cookies (they just fell apart on pan) so i pressed them into bars. Add abit of mini chocolate chips and this is perfect. Next time I will be trying apple sauce instead of oil but the oil version is good if not so good for you. Husband (who wouldn't eat right if he had to) loved them and son just doesn't want to stop eating them, haha. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Very good.  Used raisins instead of dates and substituted apple sauce for oil.  Need to use parchment paper to bake though, I ran out on one pan and they stuck badly.  My 4 year old loved them too.  Great healthy snack to use old banana's for.

Worst cookie ever.  Rubbery texture, tasted bad, a waste of good ingredients.  I went to throw them out 5 days later, and they were moldy.

These were great!!!  I, too, substituted applesauce for the oil.  I didn't have any dates around so I threw in dried cranberries, pecans and a little cinnamon.  I was amazed at how good they tasted.  And this helps with my diet when I struggle with my sweet tooth. I feel guilt free having them. Wish there were more recipes like this.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I followed the recipe almost. I took some others advice and used half oil and apple sauce. I also added cinnamon. They were different for sure. I did like the fact I was eating a healthy cookie. They were sweet and no sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

These were REALLY good. Cookies turn out VERY moist, so if you're looking for something crunchy, you're better off with a different recipe. Nevertheless, cookies were very tasty and were gone right away! Thank you.

These cookies were amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, but i substituted the dates for some dried apricots. I also added in chopped almonds and all natural coconut flakes. These are great at satisfying that sugar craving because there is no guilt in eating them at all! My family really enjoyed them and I must say that i will definitely make these again:)

Not really a cookie, more like a gob of sweet dough but they work for being no fat.  I used applesauce instead of the oil and mixed in some honey, raisins and chopped up prunes.  They were good tasting but the texture leaves a lot to be desired.

I was excited to try these--I had some leftover bananas and was tired of banana nut bread.  I left out the dates because I had none, used apple sauce instead of oil, and added cinnamon; for half of the batch I added chopped apples.  They baked in 22 minutes and were certainly healthy, but not very flavorful.  I was baking them to give as a gift, which I still did, but I decided to make some chocolate chip cookies to go with them just in case.  Maybe next time I could try adding nuts and more spices.

Egg-free, dairy-free, oil-free, and almost fat-free (if you used applesauce)!This is probably the healthiest cookie recipe in the entire world.  Here are some changes I made: 1/3 cup applesauce instead of oil, 3/4 cup raisins instead of the dates, and I added 5 tsp. of honey. I made about 17 cookies 3-inch in diameter, and they come up to around only 90 calories each with no fat at all!! If you're a health freak, you'll love 'em, but I don't suggest offering it to anyone else because it does taste a little rubbery/not-so-cookie-like. The bananas were a little bit too much (I used 3 medium) so next time I think I'll use 2 and a half. Also I will try adding cinnamon and peanut butter! Great recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

they came out rubbery and wet on the inside.  I'm all for healthy foods and all, and I was hoping these would be good, but it seems you either like 'em or you hate 'em.  Now I'm mad that I wasted my bananas.  Will not make again.

mmmmmmmm So yummy.  The only thing I did differently was substitute chocolate chips instead of the dates.  SO yummy.  My children love them too so that's all that matters.  I love not adding the extra sugar into them.  I'm ok with a few choco chippies though :)  I'll be making these a lot.  I'm going to blog about this recipe today too, it's THAT good. http://pluckymama.wordpress.com/

I am giving this recipe five stars because it is a great recipe to build from.  Even if you add little things you aren't supposed to (like sugar or chocolate chips) it's still much healthier than many of the other cookies out there.  It isn't meant to taste like a sugary treat (obviously) so think of them more as slightly sweet fruity oat bars...lol.    These were the changes I made to the recipe: *I used two bananas instead of three.  I only had two or else I would have used all three. *I diced up a small granny smith apple in place of the dates. *I used a 1/2 cup more of rolled oats. *I added a tsp of cinnamon. *I added a little less than a 4th of a cup of honey. (I would guess) and finally *I added three tablespoons of chunky peanut butter. I really enjoy these cookies as a healthy snack.  You can do so many different things with this recipe.  It keeps me from digging into the Oreos or other junk food goodies that are brought into the house.

These were, what I can only describe as a very pleasant surprise. Chewy, but not overly, just enough natural sweetness from the banana and dates. I made up a batch for an upcoming kayaking/hiking trip and I already 'tested' them on my husband, lol. (I put three chocolate chips per cookie on the tops of the ones for him). They passed that test and seem to be storing very well. ***Mixed in some natural un-sweetened coconut into half of the next batch I made(for me) and white chocolate chips on the other half, right on the top again(for him). We ate the first batch before the trip this week, lol.  Thanks to the poster, and to those making them, have fun changing up whats inside them, I may try some pumpkin puree next in place of the bananas :-)

I set out to find a recipe that used the four over-ripened bananas I had that were on the verge of being thrown out.  I was hesitant by the lack of flour and sugar in this cookie, but thought I'd give it a shot.  After reading the reviews, I did throw in some cinnamon, mini chocolate chips and used raisins instead of the dates, because I didn't have any dates, but these came out FANTASTIC.  Good thing they're healthy though, because I can't stop eating them!

As an adult, I wouldn't make these for a party unless you have a lot of health conscience people attending.  But, for an option for a healthy snack for the kids, I give this five stars.  My children LOVE these cookies.  I added 2 TBS crunchy peanut butter, and a dash or so of cinnamon and nutmeg to add flavor.  I also used raisins instead of dates.  I didn't substitute the applesauce for oil, but I do that a lot in breads and really enjoy the way in turns out, so I will attempt that next time.  This is great for the little ones!!!

For healthy type cookies, these are great. I added an egg, walnuts, coconut, almonds, a chopped apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I also cut the oil back to about 2 tbsp. I chopped the dates and simmered them in about 1/2 a cup of water until I had a thick date 'syrup', and added that to the mixture. These cookies are plenty sweet, filling, and very tasty! Thanks :)

These are amazingly easy, healthy and delicious!  I'm preggers and try to satisfy my occasional sweet tooth in healthy ways, and this is perfect.  I did sub milk choc chips (naughty) for dates, and subbed applesauce for about 1/2 the oil.  I MUST freeze theese because I can't stop eating them.  YUM...Thank you!!!

I am a sweet freak that is trying to eat healthier.  I thought I would try these even those my husband did not want to try them at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out delicious.  Simple and tasty and even the stubborn husband came around and enjoyed them also.

I changed it up to add: 2.5 c. oats a little more than 1/3 c. applesauce 1 tsp. cinnamon 1/2 t. nutmeg 3/4 chopped raw pecans 2 TB. wheat germ 2 tsp. vanilla  ...no oil, no salt (not needed at all). I flattened the cookies out before baking, and they came out perfectly. They are a smash with my family.

These cookies are virtually flavorless -- the banana flavor is ever so mild and there is very little sweetness to the cookie.  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because my toddler LOVES them, which makes me a happy mom considering how good these cookies are nutritionally.  I omitted the dates and added a cup of finely ground walnuts instead.  I also filled a 1/3 cup measuring cup about halfway with unsweetened applesauce and then topped it off with canola oil.  Next time I will add flaxseed and wheat germ to increase the nutritional value even further.  These cookies do not spread, so be sure to drop enough dough to make the cookies the size you want them once baked.

These were great!  My trainers and others workout friends are always looking for "Zone Friendly" snacks.  No sugar, no flour!  I used applesauce instead of oil and then I added some cinnamon and pecans.  I also didn't use dates because they tend to have a ton of sugar. Very soft, will make again.  This recipe is a great base for all sorts of new snacks!!

We were really disappointed with these.  I only had 2 bananas so I added some peeled, diced apple and used applesauce instead of the oil.  Once we added the rest of the ingredients, the mixture would not stick together so I added 1/2 cup of natural peanut butter and baked as directed.  My husband took one bite and did not care for them. They had absolutely no flavor. I can't even see how they would be good even if I had not added the peanut butter.  Seems like a great idea for a healthy cookie...maybe I will try again and play around with the ingredients.  Thanks anyway "K.Gailbrath"!

I made these today, hoping they'd be good, but they are completely tasteless.  I added a few spices and I don't know, they have a strange taste, like they're going rancid or something.  This comes from someone who loves plain bran buds.  In fact, I made bran muffins the other day without any sugar and they were WAY better than this, so it's not like I have a sweet tooth.  When I first ate them I thought maybe they'd be OK if I added some sugar next time, but then after eating a few I realized there will be no next time.  It's like eating some strange oat concoction...and I do like oats too.
I'm a dietitian so I love making healthy things, but you don't have to compromise flavor this much for something to be healthy.

I run a nutrition group and made these cookies with a group of diabetics.  They were tasteless. Our diabetic friends deserve flavor and these have none. There are lots of wonderful, healthy recipes out there and this is not one of them.

Very easy to make.  Here are the changes I made:  4 bananas, 3 diced apples, 1/2 cup toasted pecans, 1 cup applesauce, 2 tbsp melted butter, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg, 1/4tsp allspice, 1/2cup honey, 1/4 cup coconut, 1/4cup flaxmeal.  I baked one batch as listed above and the kids would not eat them.  Even after I let them cool before putting another in the oven.  I think it was a texture thing, they like all the ingredients seperately, but not in this combo.  I added chocolate chips to the rest of the mix and they ate a few of those.  This does taste very sweet even with out the chocolate chips.  I do miss the little crunch from other cookies.  I do not think I will make them again simply because it is not healthy for me since I am the only one eating them!

I'm acutally impressed! Somehow Banana and Oats can make a somewhat decient cookie base without flour and sugar. I added cinnamon and substituded liquid egg for the oil, as well, i didn't have dates so i used Raisins and Coconut. Turned out as a soft of moist muffin idea. TIP: These don't "rise" so you can place them close on the cookie sheet.

Great and tasty recipe!  I would use Extra Virgin Olive Oil next time, and I would probably only use 1/4 c. instead of the recommended 1/3 c.

You will feel very tempted to add sugar in because that's exactly whats missing and it will taste very much so. I resisted adding any though, since they are supposed to be 'healthy', hence the naming. Don't expect these to miraculously taste like the regular sugar enriched cookie because they're not. They would definitely appeal to people who are used to sacrificing some taste for lower calorie foods. Otherwise, they're really not intended to be baked to satisfy the taste buds. However, I did find it pretty hard to stop popping them into my mouth! This recipe REALLY produces 36 cookies! Mine were about 1.5" wide. Preferred them a bit less soft so I liked the batch I baked for 35 minutes the best. Overall, liked this recipe because its really simple, easy and for healthy cookies, they're really not half bad at all.

Being health conscious, I have avoided cookies but was very excited when I found this recipe. I made it exact to test it and found the texture different, but not unpleasant. As we eat a lot of bananas, I usually have them go beyond ideal ripeness before we can eat them all. Now I'll be buying in excess to make sure I can make these! Looking forward to varying the recipe. They also tasted better and better as they cooled. It was hard not to eat the whole batch!

Great healthy treat recipe.  It is not a traditional cookie, but it certainly satisfies my sweet tooth without the guilt.

Recipe is fine as written, but I substitute applesauce for the oil and add a handful of Craisins, pecans, mini chocolate chips, and a spoonful of brown sugar.   YUMMMM!

i made these cookies with a few alterations and they were amazing! i didn't have dates on hand, so for the dried fruit i used chopped dried plums and craisins (about 1/2 c. of each). i didn't use as much oil (to save calories), and added honey to taste, about 4 tbs or more. i will definitely make these again!

These taste healthful, which they are. The natural sweetness proves that you don't always need to add sugar to everything! Maybe next time I'd use craisins (which have added sugar, oh well) or raisins.

I love this recipe right now because I am trying to change the way I eat. I love it.  It gives me something sweet to eat without feeling like I totally blew it.  I also gave this recipe to my mother-in-law who has high cholesterol (b/c this recipe has none), and she LOVED it! Thanks for the recipe.

These work great for getting my toddlers to eat their oatmeal in the morning. I give them these and they think they are getting to eat sugary cookies for breakfast. The taste, of course, is not as delicious as a regular oatmeal cookie but it is a wonderful healthy alternative. I ground up half of the oats in the food processor to make them less course. Thanks for the recipe.

Really good cookies.  Might sound surprising to make cookies like this, but they do have a slightly better taste than the typical sweet cookies...maybe its just that they're better for you too!  Also very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, except that I added some cinnamon, which topped the flavor off nicely!

I WANT to love these, but I just don't.  I added raisins, chopped apples (which I highly recommend) and cinnamon and in the second round, salt.  Still, something is missing.  I am going to keep trying them in hopes I crack the code.  The banana/oat base is just too appealing to pass up.

I'm a huge fan of this site, and I have found hundreds of awesome recipes...unfortunately, this wasn't one of them. I took some of the suggestions to add other spices, but these still tasted like an old protein bar. They had a bad consistency, and I don't think we'll be making them again. 

I love the IDEA of something healthy and simple like this, but I just think the flavor and texture left much to be desired.

Excellent! I put dried cherries instead of dates the first time. But I like it better without either and just add nuts. I don't use the vegetable oil, but 3 tablespoons of milled flax seed and 2 tablespoons water. 1/2 a teaspoon of light margarine sometimes. But these are EXCELLENT!!!!

Great recipe, I added some changes, I used un-sweetened applesauce instead of the oil, added 1tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. ginger, and 1/2 c. chopped walnuts.  The first batch I dropped by teaspoonfuls & baked for 17 min. turned out good, next batch I made cookies twice as big and flattened out baked for 15 min, turned out great.  I will definitely make these again & experiment with other ingredients, too.  I thought they were just the perfect sweetness.  Thank you for a healthy cookie!

Made these cookies for my co-workers (we are a total of 12 DIETITIANS!) and everyone raved about them! I didn't have dates, so instead I added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips.  I also wasn't sure whether to use regular rolled oats or quick oats, so I used half of each and the cookies turned out fine. I also added 1/4 cup ground flaxseeds to boost fiber and omega-3. These are a delicious alternative to traditional cookies made with loads of butter and sugar!

I got this recipe from a friend and have been making these cookies nonstop. To make it even healthier I use 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce and just 1/8 cup oil. Add some cinnamon and some unsweetened cherries and they are fabulous for me. ( the rest of the family prefers the unhealthy choc. chip cookies!)

Delicious! I love healthy treats, and these definitely are healthy and tasty! I made some changes to suit my tastes. I used chopped raisins, craisin, and walnuts instead of dates, replaced the oil w/ 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and added some extra vanilla and cinnamon.

These cookies are delicious! To make them a little more healthy I switched the vegetable oil for apple sauce.  I also added sliced almonds, dried cranberries and raisins. Nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon really go a long way! Totally tasty and also nutritious!

I tried this recipe and unfortunatly i have found it bland, maybe it's because i like sugar to much, it just did not work for me. Maybe if there was spices added.

Yum!  This was the perfect treat for my twin toddlers.  I tweaked the recipe a bit, adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I also used raisins rather than dates.  A very moist and tasty cookie.

I'm not a banana person, but knowing how healthy they are I'm always trying to find recipes to make them more palatable. I made these exactly as written and thought they were very good. More muffin like than cookie tho. Next time I think I'll add a few spices to jazz them up a bit. Thank you!

I made these for my father, who is diabetic and he really loved them. I added walnuts to the recipe. As for me, i don't care much for dates, but I love the oatmeal and walnut taste.  I thought that the dates had a very strong scent and taste, but if you like dates, then these cookies are for you.

As is, I wasn't the biggest fan of the recipe. But then I replaced the fruit and vanilla for a quarter cup of chunky peanut butter and mini chocolate morsels. If I have applesauce, I'll use that instead of oil. If not, I just skip it and figure that the PB does alright. They always come out delicious! It is my favorite recipe, and best of all it's so easy that you don't even need to follow a recipe or measure anything once you've made it a couple times.

It's important to store them in the fridge once they cool.

These cookies came out wonderfully moist and chewy.  I rated these "5 stars" because this is the best tasting cookie I have ever eaten that is without artificial or real sugars, and guilt free.  I split the recipe into 1/3's and made 12 cookies.  I left the dates out and added a sprinkle of salt.  I really enjoyed these and will make them again and again.  They are naturally sweetened, and if you looking for a sweet cookie, these are not for you.  These also did not stick to the pan.  I used non-stick spray on a cookie sheet.

I used dried cranberries, threw in some brown sugar and allspice. All I can say is yum! I didn't bake them quite 20 minutes so the middle is a little more cookie-like. A great snack and the boys love them!(They shaped up fine, not a hint of falling apart, and we just picked them up off the cookie sheet)

I used applesauce instead of oil and chopped prunes instead of dates (nobody even notices they're not raisins and they are sweeter than raisins if you've never tried them). I think I could have cooked these longer to give them a crispy outside. I flattened them per other reviewers comments. I plan on taking some of these to my dad. I don't know how well these are going to hold up at room temperature though...I think I may have to freeze them or at least put them in the fridge because they are really moist...especially on the bottoms.

I think this was a hard one to rate...I mean really...how tasty can healthy be?? The fact is these cookies have NO SUGAR and NO refined flour either!!! I never had dates before, not bad...added a few shakes of cinnamon, and did half granola and half rolled oats.  Tasty and sweet enough for "healthy".  BUT THIS IS MY DILEMA....recipe makes 36...I only got 19.  SO I MADE TOO BIG, and this could be why some other reviewers thought they were chewy or gummy or gloppy.  I personally did not mind the texture, they were not far off from granola bars (check on the sugar content in those babies). I don't think you can always replace oil with applesauce...but I will try the next time I make these.

These were horrible. I'm so sorry for being so frank, but these cookies were a diaster. Sugar may be bad for you, but cookies without sugar or just aren't cookies. Healthy doesn't mean sugar-free. low-fat, etc. it means to get the most nutritious version of foods as possible, and these cookies were a waste of my time and calorie budget.

These are a really good recipe, but I changed it a little. (Making it less healthy...Oops!) I added a couple shakes of cinnamon and a little less than 1/3 cup of sugar. Also a couple dashes of salt...like I said making them slightly less healthy :) . I agree that one should flatten them before they go in the oven.

I made these into bar cookies by cooking them in a 9x11 glass pan.  They make a great sugarless snack or breakfast treat.

They were ok, but really nothing special.  I don't normally make "healthy" cookies so maybe that was the issue.  I used only 1/4 cup of oil and they still seemed too oily for my taste.  I added dried cranberries and omitted the dates (perhaps the dates would have made the difference).  Oh and I also added cinnamon which went very well with the bananas. 
Thanks..

These were SO good. A definite hit with me and my family. I didn't have dates or canola oil so I substituted dried cranberries and grapeseed oil. Maybe that was the trick!! I also chopped the cranberries into small bits before. Very YUMMY! and only  1 pt. on Weight Watchers!!

These cookies are great...however, I made some changes to the recipe:  used applesauce instead of the oil, for the oatmeal I used the instant oatmeal that comes in the individual packets (6 packets equals 2 cups) No one in my family eats the regular nor the cinnamon and spice so I used them in this recipe.  Although it is not recommended to use instant oatmeal in making recipes, I thought that it turned out okay.  They were a little on the soft side, but still really good.  I made my cookies a little bigger than suggested.

This recipe is fantastic. I used raisins instead of the dates because that is all I had and they were also very good. If you want a great and healthy snack for the kids or the diabetic, this is it. I will make this often.

This is a quick, easy and tasty recipe that I discovered when searching for sugar-free desserts to bring to a company Christmas party.  They were a blast!  Also, due to their ingrediants, they are perfect for a *nest* alternative to the old coconut Easter concoction.  Just use a spoon to sink in the middle and they're ready for marshmallow chicks or candy eggs.

A little too moist. I wonder if adding a bit more flour would make these more enjoyable. The taste is good, though a little bland, and the dates come off strong.

These cookies were pretty good for a "healthy" dessert.  The batter was way more flavorful than the cookies were after baking.  It was a very easy recipe to throw together quickly also.

I made these with the applesauce and raisins.  They were pretty good, but they tasted healthy.  Also, they don't end up crispy, so as long as you don't expect that, they're good.

I do not think most children would eat these cookies! HOWEVER, me and my boyfriend made them and we liked them.  We added a little bit of cinnamon and sugar to our cookies though. I think they are good to make for snacks or a picnic.

There's not much taste to them, but there isn't any sugar or butter, so it is 
expected.  I added raisins, chopped walnuts, 1 chopped apple, and used apple
sauce instead of oil.  You can eat it for breakfast since it's so healthy!

Let's start with they are a healthier alternative to a plain cookie. I substituted cherries for dates. I added extra oatmeal, cinnamon, and dark chocolate chunks. I also sprinkled them with a little turbinado sugar before I popped them in the oven. It's a great way to use up ripe bananas. Kind of an alternative to a granola bar. Keep in mind that at some point if you add too many things you take the healthy right out of them. I didn't think they needed the chocolate. I will definitely make them again.

Didn’t have dried fruit so I ended up adding about an 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup oats, 1/3 cup of pecans, and about a 3/4 cup of keto chocolate chips.

It was delicious! It did have a gummy texture. Not sure if it was just mine. But over all still good. I’d say let them cool completely so that it’s not so gummy.

My 5 year old didn’t like it but my 10 year old did!
She said it reminded her of banana bread lol

Stuck with everything but added cinnamon, almonds and chia seeds and switched the dates to cranberries. This is kid approved and diabetic friendly. Enough sweet to last me until my next meal.

I replaced the dates, which are high in sugar, with frozen cranberries (cut in half) and it was amazing!  Thank you.  This is my new go-to breakfast or quick after-school snack for the kids.

I usually follow the recipe the first time I make it, then make adjustments. This time, however, I had some apples I had to use up. I added them to this recipe as well as some cinnamon and nutmeg. I also increased the oatmeal to 1 cup. I followed others suggestions. I think it would've been great as is! My daughter has celiac disease, so next time I'll substitute for gluten free oats.

Strong banana flavor and an excellent combination of flavors!  My bananas were not very ripe though, to avoid the overly sweet flavor and falling apart too easily mentioned in the comments.  Actually I can understand why it wasn't sweet enough for some; I'm just glad to have found a healthy "cookie" recipe filled with fruit and no added sugar.

It was great but instead of putting in dates I put in Choc. Chips and a bit of cinnamon.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and used quick cooking oats. I also added 1 cup slivered almonds. Once done, I sprinkled the tops with Splenda powdered sugar.

I switched up the recipe to make it EVEN HEALTHIER and it was delicious. I added 2 whole bananas, 1 cup of traditional oats, and about 1/2 cup of chopped dates. I was worried they would turn out dry since I didn’t use any oil, but they were PERFECT. Keep your eye on the oven, though, as these were done in about 15 minutes. Great recipe!

I don’t like it when people leave reviews after changing  the recipe, but I didn’t have dates so I added a tablespoon honey and a tablespoon brown sugar.  Did the rest of the recipe as listed. They were great!

Good-looking cookies, flavor was okay, I added mini chocolate chips to the batter. I didn't like the finished product that much, and I actually preferred eating the dough raw which is okay because there's nothing in there that can't be eaten raw. Would not make them again.

I made these and added some cinnamon replaced the dates with Raisins.  There were way too many raisins, I'd probably cut it down to 3/4 to 1 cup next time and maybe try dried cranberries instead.  They don't have a lot of flavor, so I may try adding some applesauce or honey or brown sugar, until I find the right flavor.  Overall, it's a pretty good cookie.

To the basic recipe, I added 1//3 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/4 c. diced almonds, and 1/4 c. chopped pecans. Also, I used light olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I baked them for 20 minutes at 350 degrees because I prefer the cookies a little drier. I entered these cookies into the local state fair and won first prize!

Made these added pecans for some crunch. Very good I baked a 1/2 a batch a little longer for a crunchier cookie. 
Super easy even for kids to make. Enjoy

These are okay, very bland and not tasty at all. My kids (ages 7,5 & 2) did not really care for them but I was looking for something healthy & quick to make for their school lunches. They are quick & easy to make. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used raisins instead of dates. Personally I really liked the idea of using mashed bananas & oats.

These were pretty tasty! However, the first batch I made were a trifle over-cooked, and the dates tended to scorch. I cooked the next batch for 15 minutes only and they were fine.

EDIT: I made these again and completely followed the recipe (no maple syrup, no extra dried fruits, specified amount of oil) and they turned out perfect. No burning and they baked in20 minutes. 

These cookies were slightly bland,burned on the bottom halfway through baking, and never firmed up and took way longer than the specified baking time.I used half a cup of dates and added chopped apricots and dried cranberries. I added 2 tablespoons of maple syrup (and ommited some of the oil so it wouldn't be mushy-which didn't work).They taste much better cold that hot out of the oven and lasted for almost a week in the fridge. When I make these next time, I'll double the amount if spices and add a small amount of flour to prevent them from burning again.

I halved the recipe as I was making them for myself. I substituted the oil for half apple sauce and half pure peanut butter. I also replaced half of the dates with chopped 76% dark chocolate, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. 
I got 10 big 'cookies' out of this, although may have overcooked them slightly as they turned out more chewy than soft and chewy. I also worked out the calorie and sugar content per cookie (for the halved recipe plus added/substituted ingredients) and calculated it as 130 kcal and 11g sugar. So these definitely aren't healthy when it comes to sugar content!   Of course if I'd stuck with the oil or used all peanut butter in place of the oil, or replaced all of the dates with dark chocolate, this would have drastically reduced the amount of sugar to around 4.3g per cookie, which is about 1 tsp and 11g+ less than a traditional cookie of the same size. I think next time I will try that as these don't taste all that sweet to me anyway considering! 
However, they are definitely more nutritional than traditional cookies. I quite liked them as a satisfying alternative when I'm trying to be healthier.

3rd time making this recipe. Very good. I made  them as listed using coconut oil. I did not use applesauce as many did because there is enough sugar in the dates that are in the actual recipe.

Anything that is supposed to be healthful catches my attention.  I cannot have too much sugar or fat and am always looking for some kind of baked goods that I can enjoy.

I cut the recipe in half for the first try; got 16 cookies.  I substituted chopped walnuts for half the dates and used only 1/3 the oil, substituting equal parts applesauce and fat-free plain yogurt for the rest.  I also added a little cinnamon.

These came out very chewy--not in itself a bad thing, but I had hoped for just a little more crunch.  I froze them and like to nibble on one straight out of the freezer.   This may sound crazy, but it makes a cookie last longer for me.  I will make them again.

I think raisins would work just as well as dates.

These are so simple and tasty! I sometimes substitute raisins for the dates, it depends what I have on hand. I've even added chocolate before, though that makes them a little less healthy. :-)

They're more like oatmeal "granola bar" snacks than cookies. Tasty, but not quite sweet enough to be called cookies.

I used cranberries instead of dates and definitely add some honey. They are pretty bland so I agree with a lot of comments made. My husband didn't like them but I didn't expect him to:)

We're having cookies and hot drinks tomorrow at church.  There are a couple of ladies who are not allowed sugar.  I just took my first batch out of the oven.  I sub'd the oil with unsweetened apple cause and added raisins and craisins to the batch, long with chopped walnuts, and omitted the dates.  I also added half a teaspoon of salt.   I didn't measure the cinnamon, or the pumpkin pie spice I added.  They smell delicious, and taste even better.  Who needs sugar!!!

I personally LOVE this recipe! This recipe has endless possibilities, I mean you can add in Chocolate chips, nuts, fruit. I added in chocolate chips, and subbed the oil for applesauce, but I did end up adding about a tablespoon of canola oil just to kind of moisten it up a bit. I let the batter sit about 15-20 minutes, tossed my cookies in the oven and they came out wonderful! By the way these don't spread so even better! This recipe will be going into my book, thank you for sharing!!

These are okay. My husband liked them and I was looking for something for my dog to replace sugared cereal. She spat one out when I first gave it to her, which is not uncommon for the first time she tries something. She finally did gobble it down and looked for more.

Just made these cookies.  I was sceptical since this recipe had no baking powder or baking soda, etc...  But wow!  Impressive!  I added ¼ cup coconut, ¼ cup walnut pieces, 1 tsp. Cinnamon and used raisins vs. Dates.  I think I’ll add salt next time.  Super easy recipe and healthy!  Love it!  Thanks!

Perfect  to share with my diabetic gluten-free in-laws. These are super easy. It's more of a "healthy banana muffin" taste, but in a nice bite size. I didn't have dates; used raisins. Quite tasty.

I wanted a nice snack for us while fishing but not loaded with sugar. This is the snack!! I didn't have apple sauce but using the oil worked out good. I  added almonds, cherries, raisins, sesame seeds, honey, cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time I bake these I will probably add mac nuts.

I added frozen blueberries after the dough was ready. The trick is to put them in while frozen so they don't get too runny as they bake. If making two batches, put dough in freezer to keep berries frozen, and just add 2-3 minutes to cooking time. If blueberries are large it may take a little longer. I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon as nutmeg and blueberries are a great match.

So, I didn't make exactly as written, as we do not like dates and we subbed applesauce for the oil.  Used dried blueberries and cherries in place of the dates.  That being said, these cookies became dog treats after one bite and, at that, my dogs were quite hesitant to eat them.  The flavor was awful and the consistency of the cookie was just gross.  Sorry, but this was a train wreck for us.

These were awesome! I read the reviews and added everything mentioned.....went crazy! Used 4 organic bananas, 2-1/2 cups of quick gluten free rolled oats, 1 cup of dried cranberries, 1/3 cup natural peanut butter, 1/3 cup raw honey, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. organic nutmeg, 1 tsp.organic cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup organic chocolate chips. Baked at 350 for about 20 minutes and made about 60 cookies. YUMMY! Will make again and again! :)

LOVE this simple quick recipe. Just found the recipe that night and whipped it up. It's so delicious and perfect for parties or dinners. I just eyeballed the ingredients. Not a huge fan of dates so I chopped up some almonds, and added a few semi-sweet chocolate chips. PERFECT and delicious.  Defiantly making again :)

I made this recipe 3 times and loved it.  I only had quick 1 minute oats on hand so that is what I used.  I then used 3 very ripe bananas, oil, vanilla, and instead of dates (I didn't have any) I used dried cranberries.  My family loved them.  I put them in a ziplock back and the next morning they took on a banana bread consistency which I liked.  I have also tried substituting the cranberries for apples and cinnamon allspice but didn't like them as much as the dried cranberries.

Super yummy. Added mini chocolate chips and coconut. Next time will try swapping applesauce for the oil for fewer fat calories:)

I used dried cranberries instead of dates and added chocolate chips. Didn't really like the flavour or the texture but my bananas might have been too ripe.

These cookies are excellent, and moreover are not filled with sugar. I reduced the vegetable oil to 1 tablespoon, and also cooked them in sheet form to reduce the work of making them into balls.

Love how easy it is to make this recipe. Coconut oil gives a good flavor, as did adding spices like reviewers recommended. Next time I'd add chocolate chips for a little decadence.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written except for one addition: chopped pecans (I love them!). It was very easy to make. My husband who is a picky eater did like them. I thought they were sweet but not overly sweet. They were soft too. The best part is that I didn't feel guilty when I ate 3 in a row :)

3rd time I've made these, and I've made modifications each time for my personal preferences. This time I used 3/4 cup of dried cranberries instead of figs, 1/3 cup of plain Greek yogurt instead of vegetable oil, and added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. I love how they turned out. I avoid added sugar and fats (vegetable oil), and like being able to grab a healthy snack when I'm hungry.  The previous time I made these I used a whole cup of dried cranberries, and I thought that was too much so cut it back to 3/4 cup this time. If you are looking for a "sweet fix", this is not the cookie for you. If you are looking for a guilt-free healthy and filling cookie, this is for you...

After reading the comments here, I replaced the dates with peeled, chopped Granny Smith apples (1.5 small apples per recipe), added 6 oz of chocolate chips and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts.  I made one batch with oil and another batch with apple sauce to see the difference.
What surprised me the most was that the batter doesn't hang together well when spooning out for baking. Of course, there is no flour or egg in the recipe, so that shouldn't be surprising. 
My batch with applesauce hung together better than the one with oil. 
Both batches tasted really good to me, and very little different  from each other. In fact, they tasted so good  I ate way too many of them and gained a pound or so. Since I made them as a healthier alternative to sugary holiday cookies, I didn't completely meet my goal.  LOL.
The cookies after cooling were very moist, to the point that they didn't hold together well in a storage tub as individual cookies, they were more like moist granola macaroons. They were so moist, in fact, that I worried that they might require refrigerated storage. 
If I made them again, I'd reduce the chocolate chips down to 3 oz per batch and the chopped walnuts down to 1/4 cup.
I'm still looking for my perfect low sugar oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.  I appreciate AllRecipes for always including nutritional information on all of the recipes.
My recipe made about 50 small cookies. I calculated the following nutritional information. (Sorry, I left out the fat calculation.)

Super easy to make!  I substituted applesauce for the oil and added craisins and walnuts.   A dash of cinnamon and a splash of sugar free honey.   They are delicious.   Will look for more recipes like this sugar free winner!

I love these cookies, & they turned out great!  I  used apple sauce like other people  instead of oil.  I also added dark chocolate  chips, peanut butter, honey, flaxseeds, raisins , & pecans to mine.  However, you can make them many different ways  according  to your preferences.  Be sure to spread them out in the shape you want before baking because like others have said, they won't  spread unless you do.  My husband likes them too, & I  love the fact that they are healthy  unlike other cookies.  They make excellent breakfast cookies!  I  enjoyed reading  the other reviews  and found them to be very helpful also.

This recipe is a great starter.  I decreased the oil by half and used a shredded granny smith apple.  Instead of the dates, we enjoy any variety of dried fruits, esp cranberries.  Nt are a great addition as well.

I really wasn't a fan. I added walnuts, applesauce, honey, a little coconut oil, almond and vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, chopped dark chocolate chunks. I felt these cookies had decent texture, however, they lacked flavor (to me).

These taste great! I modified the recipe though. I swapped out the dates for raisins and apricots, and the oil for unsweetened applesauce. Then I added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts and a teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg. I find that when I bake them, they come out a bit too moist - probably because I think I may be making the cookies bigger than I'm supposed to. To help them cook more thoroughly without burning, after baking all the cookies, I put them back on the cookie sheet and put them in the oven at about 200-250 degrees for a while until they came out a bit less moist.

Great recipe, no sugar flour egg (oil) My vegan grand daughter will love these! So did I, I substituted the oil for apple sauce and added extra sultanas and half a teaspoon of salt,  they need to be flattened out. I made a double batch, being fairly moist I don't think they will keep, I might try and freeze some.

When I bake I make no changes unless I don't like the results then I would the second time. These we so delicious, I did use a Tablespoon instead cause they seemed too small. After cooling I put them in a Zip bag. The next day they were so moist !! Next time I may use other than raisins like dried cranberries.

Its a great healthy cookie recipe.  I gave it 3 stars for the taste. I added the raisins , nutmeg, cinnamon, almonds, and choc chips based on other reviews.  Its not that it was bad, but I am more used to a sugar in a cookie.  Its a great healthy snack!

This is a great recipe for those that are trying to watch the sugar intake.  I slightly altered the recipe and added cinnamon after reading the reviews.  If you use foil make sure you grease it or they will stick.
The kids ate the first six while they were still on the cooling rack!

These were amazing! I used 2 cups steel cut oats (all I had in my cabinet) and only 1/4 cup of the oil. They turned out soooo good and were naturally sweet using 3 ripened bananas. I also added some cinnamon along with the vanilla extract, and the smell of them cooking made my mouth water. This is the best "healthy" cookie I have ever made. Next time I will substitute apple sauce for the oil, just to see if that makes them even better!

Add a teaspoon of cinnamon and cloves and turned out fantastic!  Much chewier than expected.  Will definitely make again.

These are true to their name, HEALTHY.  They did not have a lot of flavor, however I think it is a terrific bas to add nuts, spices, fruits to perfect to one's own tasting.  I wasn't too thrilled with the end product,  however I am very excited to try these again adding some suggestions of other review.  I rated it four stars for potential.  I think it can very likely be a five star recipe.

For a mom who feeds her kids sugary treats only about once a week, these were perfect!    I love that they are sweetened with fruit and my kids think they are the bees knees.  Will definitely be sending in my daughters lunch box.  She's gonna go bananas! Will be great for a nice energy boost while I am at work too.  Love these cookies!

I made this as a way to curve my sweets cravings in a healthy way! It was quick, easy, and I didn't need to go out and buy anything! I will say it was a little bland but definitely worth it to make. You could easily add in little chocolate chips or anything else you would want right into the mix so its very easy to make a variety of different flavors!

My husband loved these as is the first time I made them, the second time I did go against the no sugar  part of the recipe and added a tablespoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 honey  and some extra oats to thicken it more. This resulted in him wanting to charge  his friends for them instead of sharing them for free ??

I am so glad I came across this recipe. I make these at least once a week, but I use melted coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil, and I just put all ingredients in my food processor and run it for about 20-30 seconds. Then I usually add about 1/2 cup organic dark chocolate chips and pulse a few times. Using a medium size cookie scoop, I place on a cookie sheet, flatten with a fork and bake. My family loves them, and they take all of about 10 minutes to make. Thanks for the recipe!

This will be my third time making this cookie. 
First time I made this recipe, I baked half of the dough as an original cookies and to the  other half, I added Brazilian nuts for crunchiness.

As a reasonably healthy gluten, egg and dairy free treat, (thereby being allergy and vegan friendly), these cookies are pretty good. That said, they beg for a little sprucing up. Chopped nuts or a teaspoon of cinnamon would be nice additions and still nutritious. Mini chocolate chips would also be worth a try. I probably won't make these cookies again as written but will try some variations.

This makes for a great pick-me-up for the middle of the day! The downside is if you want to add sugar the recipe, you might as well make traditional cookies. This is because dried fruit and banana's are LOADED with sugar, adding any more sugar would actually make these less healthy than regular cookies. But I added a small apple, 2 teaspoons of flax seeds, dried papaya, raisins 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a dash of ginger and ground cloves. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. Thanks for sharing!

Not bad at all. Had some ripe bananas I needed to use and came across this recipe. Substituted oil with coconut oil and they turned out pretty good. Nice and chewy with a bit of crunch with the outside oats crisping up.

I tried these cookies, I used raisins instead of dates and had some left over chocolate icing put about a half cup of that in . tasted good.

it is a  good way to use up bananas that are browning.  I would've used cinnamon but I couldn't find any

It's pretty tasty. I added half a lemon worth of juice and zest. I also put a dash of Himalayan salt  (my preferred salt). Next time I make it I might put in some nuts or seeds. Sliced almonds would be a great topping. I also thought about some coconut oil, or maybe sauteing in coconut oil. 
I don't see why I couldn't replace the veg oil with coconut oil right?
Also, this is my kind of dessert. I don't like excess sugar and regular dessert cookies. I like cookies that have natural sugar, and aren't too sweet.

Didn't care for them as cookies, but the second round I baked them in a muffin tin and they were a big hit in this form.  Might add nutmeg next time.

This cookie will be a constant in my kitchen because I have decided to replace as much of my daily intake with low sugar recipes.  These cookies are extremely healthy. I use applesauce instead of oil and instead of dates I add 1/3 honey and an extra 1/2 C of oatmeal like YEKHEFAH does (thank you for the modifications, YEKHEFAH!)

I used the original recipe, no substitutions (besides the fact that I used chocolate chips instead of dates). They tasted very delicious and I did not feel bad about nutrition when I ate them, however they did not hold together that well and crumbled when I tried to eat them, which might not have happened had I used the applesauce and honey. They were super easy to make, so for the time I put into making them they were very worthwhile. I would definitely make them again, especially with the recommended substitutions.

LOVE IT!  I did use applesauce instead of the oil for health reasons and I threw in some pecans and tsp cinnamon. Perfecto! I'm trying to do the whole "clean eating" movement that's going on and I must say, this fits the bill. My husband went crazy over a healthy cookie. That's a miracle.

These are the best banana cookies I've ever made. They are great to bring to playgroups and/or get togethers where there might be allergies. They are always a huge hit!!!!!

I added cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested by others.  They were very easy to make. Next time I think I'd add mini chocolate chips.  I'd make them again!

Delicious and amazing! I used mango (perfect combo with banana) instead of dates and added cinnamon, extra vanilla and a bit of lime juice. They're filling and taste nutritious and healthy. All my friends loved them (and they're not healthy nuts at all), making another batch right now!

Yummy! Instead of dates, I used dried cranberries.  Didn't add any extra honey or sugar.   The bananas were sweet enough :)

I LOVE this recipe. I use the original recipe, only substituting any combination of dried fruit for the dates (no likey dates). I've added all KINDS of yum-yums to these. My favorite add-ins are ginger and allspice, flaxseed, coconut and slivered almonds. I almost always  add a little honey and a pinch of salt. 
They're better the longer you let the mix set before you bake... and you HAVE to watch the time so they don't burn. :)

Kind of bland. I was trying new recipes and came across this one. I added nutmeg, honey, coconut flakes, cinnimon, vanilla, and a teeny bit of brown sugar. These are like hit your face banana flavored and its hard to mask that, even with a tbsp of brown sugar. If you are really desperate for something sweet (and youre on a diet) and love bananas, these are your cookies.

Wow! This recipe has really been beaten up for a high expectation level it would be the perfect oatmeal "cookie". The word "cookie" is more symbolic, it is a sweet treat you can grab like a cookie BUT... you have to appreciate it as a healthy alternative. First of all, your bananas HAVE to be really ripe and soft; almost mushy. The bananas offer plenty sweetness, and yes, you need to like bananas to enjoy this recipe! Also, Please do not use steel cut oats. I have been making baked oatmeal for years changing flavors, nuts and dried fruits. I thought this sounded like a nice change and it exceeded my expectations! I used melted coconut oil for the oil and raisins for the fruit and had to put them away to stop eating them! In the future I will perhaps use applesauce or nut butter, adding spices and nuts and changing up the fruit, however, I am very happy to have found this recipe I can adapt and make my own with time. Thank you, K. Gailbrath, for sharing!

I like how simple and healthy this is, though I found it to be too oily and used about half the oil.  A variation that I liked better than that: same quantities bananas and oats, 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter, 2/3 cup chocolate chips.  No oil, but greased cookie sheet with really thin layer vegetable oil.

These were excellent, and so simple to make! I took advice of other reviewers and ground up half of the oats which improved the texture, and made it easier to chop the dates when I sprinkled it on them. I also added 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice, and replaced vegetable oil with 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 applesauce. I thought these cookies were very sweet and need no added sugar. I forgot to add nuts, but will do so next time. A delicious healthy treat.

Soft, chewy, healthy cookies. I used diced apples and raisins instead of dates, substituted applesauce for the oil like others have said, added honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Really good! Not crazy amazing, but pretty good for such a healthy recipe. I feel like a lot of healthier cookie recipes are not that healthy so it was nice to find a decently healthy recipe. I like that it has banana and oats. It's also so easy to make. Thanks for sharing. :-)

Came out a little dry (probably my fault) and obviously it's not very sweet but they still taste good. I used raisins instead of dates and didn't have vanilla extract on hand so I'm not sure how much that affected the cookies as well. I was hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews but for those who do not have a strong sweet tooth, or just really can't have the sugar, these are good.

Not the worst no-refined sugar dessert I've tried.  I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix.  I chose no added sugar applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  The taste was not bad...I would recommend using very ripe bananas to add to the sweetness of the cookie.  Mine were a tish not quite ready, but I didn't want to wait.  The sweetness level could be improved just using very ripe bananas.  Otherwise they turned out great. As someone who is trying to cut down on sugars because I want to (an admitted taste-struggle!), I think some of the people who left negative reviews probably are hoping for something to be as extremely sweet as a refined sugar dessert. Nothing wrong with this recipe, no-sugar is just an adjustment for the taste buds.

I am not a baker, I hate baking! So this recipe is right up my alley. I changed a few things, as I always do with "cooking". I used rasp. noosa yogurt, a little peantut butter, no oil, and some granola and oats. Plus the cinnamon and nutmeg. Turned out to be a chewy little snack! Will definately make these the next time I have ripe bananas around!

Yummy! Switched 1/3 cup applesauce for oil and used raisins instead of dates. . I also added 1 teaspoon each of nutmeg/cinnamon and 1/3 cup of honey. Recipe made about 15 cookies. My wife loved them but I didn't care for them that much.

My rating is for my alteration: you can make the same recipe leaving out the oil and they are REALLY healthy then! (I also omit vanilla). I call them 'breakfast cookies' and are not only a great snack but also good for breakfast on the run. I usually mix 1 banana, 1 cup of oats and mix in either Craisins or walnuts. So good and my toddler loves them! Google '2 ingredient cookies' for origins

I made this recipe today, didn't have dates so used double the amount of sultanas. Also used more vanilla and added sesame seeds.   They were absolutely delicious and I would recommend. I am going to add chopped nuts next time.

Added a couple tablespoons of PB2 peanut butter for a subtle peanut flavor. Also decreased the dates and added some mini chocolate chips. Pressed into a pan for granola bars. I was  hoping for a crispier product but yet were still good.

This recipe is very easy and offers room for tons of variations and additions. I added cinnamon and nutmeg, used applesauce instead of oil, and added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Very tasty as a light dessert or even a grab and go breakfast.

This is a delicious recipe. So simple, so adaptable! Made first batch with 1/4 c coconut oil. Second with choc chips, same oil, hemp seeds, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Planning an oatmeal/raisin/coconut one next. Yum!

Thank you K. for this wonderful recipe. I really wish people would think about what they are mixing up before they complain. I go to a daily  meeting and bake something at least once a week to bring. Many of the people are diabetics and to have bigger challenge a few are vegan. This recipe fits the bill! So versatile as well. I do  substitute apple sauce for the oil. I add spices, raisins, coconut just whatever I have on hand. Thank you again.

I just didn't get the feel of a cookie. More of a homemade energy bar. They didn't hold together. Not bad tasting, just not what I expected.

We really like this one, but instead of figs we use golden raisins. I've done it both ways and like the raisins better. I am freeze any old bananas and then take them out and let them thaw a minute then peel them and cut them up into big sections. I let them sit in a bowl for a while till they warm. I use this method for making banana bread, pumpkin banana ice cream, etc.

This is absolutely delicious and healthy! Instead of putting some oil I used 1-1/2 cup applesauce instead. I have no available dried fruits so I replaced it with 1 cup chopped cashew nuts.Mine came out moist and chewy.

I love this! I changed it up a little bit by adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts, about 1/2 a tablespoon of cinnamon, and almond extract instead of vanilla extract. I also formed them into bars. You want to press them down to size before baking because they don't set. I will be making these about once a week because they make perfect healthy snacks! They taste just like a banana but muffin :)

They maybe weren't the best in the world, but still pretty good when baked a few minutes more. I added cranberries instead of dates.

Great for a healthy cookie. Granddaughter loves them. Did add spices as suggested. Since they are so moist keeping them in the refrigerator is a good idea.

I change this recipe up every time I make it and it always turns out great!  I do substitute the vegetable oil with coconut oil, which gives it the texture of a very moist banana bread.  Next time I'm mixing in spiced rum and cloves with the walnuts and cinnamon that are must ingredients for me.   Thanks to all who share their recipes and recommendations!

I made these for my husband to take to work with him for snacking. I am continually told that I need to make more! They are very easy to make and I love that the ingredients are so easy. The only bummer is that EVERY kid who has tried them are not fans! For kids, I recommend skipping the dates and splurging with some chocolate chip or chocolate drizzled on top!

I love these.  I added chopped pecans. They are not super sweet, so I added a little honey to the top before biting in to this warm deliciousness.  Enjoyed with a glass of cold milk. Yummy.  And healthy too!

I substituted cranberries for dates which gave them a bit more flavor as well as a little cinnamon and nutmeg. I think I will try the applesauce for oil and dried apples next time. Not a lot of flavor, but when you have diet restrictions they are a "treat" you don't have to feel guilty about.

The low rating is probably my fault. I uses apple sauce instead of oil so maybe that's why they turned out tasteless. Either way they need spices like cinnamon and nutmeg or peanut butter. I will try them again but they need improvement.

I thought that this recipe was very good for healthy cookies. It seemed to lack some sweetness to it; but again, it is a healthy cookie. I would use really ripe bananas to make them sweeter. I definitely will make again when I need a healthier alternative.

Thought these were okay.  Will definately add cinnamon next time for extra flavor and maybe use other fruit besides the dates.

I honestly didn't like these. I don't know if I overcooked them or what... I  just don't like the texture or flavor. I cooked them for the time said, but they seem dry, or chewy, but not a good chewy.

If you are counting "points" for weight loss these cookies are 2 points each.  They taste OK and would only make them again if someone is on a diet.

Very simple to make with few ingredients. Soft chewy cookies. I used peanut butter chips instead of dates this attempt and it was an excellent choice as the classic banana-peanut butter combo boasts. Next time I may include bran buds to add additional texture.

I doctored this up using other people's tips.  Applesauce instead of oil, more oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, dried cranberries and some chocolate chips.  I also used a packet of Splenda.  I calculated each cookie to be about 75 calories.  They were just okay, not terrible tasting...just not great enough to warrant that high of calories.  DH and son thought they weren't anything special...said they needed more chocolate chips and they tasted like bananas....ha.ha.  Won't make again

These were good and surprisingly sweet. I split the recipe into two batches. In the first batch I followed the recipe, and in the second I substituted applesauce for the oil and added a few chocolate chips, and they both turned out well. Fresh out the oven, these were delicious and a little crispy. The cookies did become mushy after the first few hours, which is why I gave this four instead of five stars. Me and my one year old loved these, but my five year old and husband hated them.

I also added a bit of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg), about 1/4 cup honey (although it's probably delicious without) and about 1/3 cup more oats.  These cookies are spectacular.  I work too hard at the gym to ruin my meal plan with sugar, butter and white flour.   These really satisfy a sweet tooth and are so easy and inexpensive to make--a winner!

Changed review from the below - i finally found the combination that i liked. Cranberries substituted for dates,  1/3 pure honey,  1/3 applesauce (substituted for oil),  1tsp cinnamon,  1tsp brown sugar. Mixed all dry ingredients, then added liquid,  added bananas last. 


OLD REVIEW --I am the only one who likes this in my family.  Added 1/2 pecans, no dates - but cranberries, 1tsp of cinnamon, 1tsp of nutmeg (will not add again), 1/2c honey, and applesauce in place of the oil.

I loved them - my mom did not.

They are super easy to make and you can pretty much add whatever you like.  I did half cup dates and half cup apricots, and also subbed apple sauce for oil.  They taste a LOT like bananas, so I think I will def sub peanut butter for the oil next time.  I'll keep making them for sure!

Loved this recipe....healthy and yummy!!!  I read the reviews and substituted the oil with applesauce, added coconut and nuts and a little sea salt.  You can do many variations. Definitely let the batter sit for 15 minutes.  Family is already demanding more!

I have been making these without the oil for quite a while.  The are super healthy and taste great.  I have added cinnamon, nuts, or put a few chocolate chips on top of each before baking.  You can really mix it up to your taste or what you have on hand.

This is a easy and great recipe for sugar free especially since there is no artificial sweetener added.  They actually taste like an old fashioned cookie.  I made them several times using the exact recipe and my husband just loved them. I changed them up by substituting the veg oil for cocunut oil  and a pinch of sea salt- they were wonderful!!!

I was looking for a sugar free cookie recipe and came across this one.  It is excellent!  Moist & yummy.  Really great as a quick breakfast on the run with my commuter cup of coffee.

I've made this twice. Honey is a nice addition to this recipe but definitely substitute the coconut oil for the vegetable oil.

These were good once I doctored them up.  Otherwise they were bland.  I added chocolate chips, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  I know the chocolate chips make them less healthy but they tasted better.

I just made this recipe, and I love it! I did substitute the oil for the same amount of natural applesauce, and I added a sprinkling of cinnamon and allspice. Really, really delicious! I highly recommend these cookies. My husband, two teenage kids and son-in-law liked them. I made them very small -- bite-sized. I'm going to try adding coconut tomorrow when I make them again. :)

As far as healthy cookies go these are top notch! The first batch I made using the exact recipe, substituting apple sauce for the oil. For my second batch I added in some shredded coconut and chopped pecans, and used the fruit/veggie applesauce. They also turned out very good.

Overall a great recipe if you're looking for a healthier alternative, but need that sweet tooth fix!

I absolutely love these cookies! My boyfriend first made these for me as a surprise because I am such a health nut and it's hard to find cookies that fit my "picky-ness". When he made them he used 2/3 cup of applesauce instead of veggie oil and he added thick shreds of coconut, SO GOOD. When I made them though I added a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract and they turned out GREAT (that is in addition to the vanilla extract, not in replace of).

Guiltless cookies for the young and old and everyone inbetween! I substituted raisins for the dates and added walnuts. I used canola oil but next time will sub applesauce for the oil. Use ripe bananas and they will be sweet enough to satisfy. I find the nuts help with the texture.  Skip the cookie aisle in the store and make these instead.

I just made these for the first time. I used greek yogurt instead of the oil and mini chocolate chips instead of the dates and YUMMY!!!! They did not spread at all during baking so next time I will flatten them a bit and spray the pan with cooking spray.

These were very good and easy. Unfortunately the children were not at all fans. 

For best texture, avoid "ball like" spoonfulls and allow the dough to flatten a bit before putting in the oven.

These were realy good and soooooo easy to make.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating, is that I think they could use an extra ingredient to realy enhance the flavours....such as cherry or almond essence.  I'll try adding it next time.

This is a great recipe and can be tweaked easily to go with whatever you have on hand. I've tried different combinations of dried fruit & extracts (cranberry/orange w/maple extract) (blueberry w/almond extract) and have added coconut flakes much to our eating pleasure :)  Kids also loved them and hubby too!

I really liked these! Although they are much more like a flapjack than a cookie, that's for sure! I used extra virgin olive oil (that's all we had), 2 bananas and added some cinnamon and other dried fruits, and I thought they were delicious! Quite stodgy but I put that down to me not using the right ingredients, but even so the stodginess is quite moist so they're lovely to eat. I'd make them again, definitely!

These aren't bad at all.  They just may be what Will satisfy my yearnings for a little something after supper.  I had no dates but plenty of craisins.  Also, my batter was pretty runny but that might be because I put the bananas through the food processor. I might add a pinch of cinnimon next time...... Hope they freeze OK.

These cookies are awesome! I am on a no flour-no sugar diet and these are a great treat. My brother-in-law is diabetic and loved these healthy cookies. It is hard to find cooky recipes without aspartame or other artificial sweeteners. Thanks for sharing!

Very Good! I also replaced the oil with applesauce and used low fat granola w/raisins cereal instead of oats and dates. I've made them with oatmeal and raisins also. I make them in a 9X13 pan and cut them like brownies.  You can really make your own with this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

What a simple, awesome recipe!  I no longer need to buy granola bars at the store!  I used applesauce instead of oil, quick oats instead of rolled oats (I ran out of rolled oats) and added some milk chocolate chips and a few raisins.  My kids LOVED these!!!!  I only made one batch in case they didn't like them, but looks like I will be making a triple batch tonight!  Am also going to make them as bars in my stoneware sheet pan.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These cookies take some getting used to. I did not like the first one, the second one was not too bad. I kept telling myself they were healthy...  I even added spices like other reviewers suggested. Won't make these again.

Instead of vegetable oil I used non-sweetened strawberry applesauce.  Instead of 1 cup of dates, I combined crasins, coconut and chocolate chips to make 1 cup.  The finished product was good, but not great because the banana/oat part of the cookies were too bland.  I'm pretty sure adding honey (like many others reviewer did) would correct this problem.

A great healthy, soft, and chewy cookie. This definitely needs the teaspoon of cinnamon other reviewers refer to. I also replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and added 1/4 cup wheat germ, a handfull of sunflower seeds, some coconut, and 1/2 cup honey. I didn't have dates in the house. We call them Banana Monster Cookies because you can throw just about anything in them. I am waiting for my bananas to over-ripen so I can make again...this time with mini chocolate chips and craisins.

I recommend adding some cinnamon! As others have said they are a soft cookie, but with the dates and banana they are naturally sweet and a healthy treat. I used olive oil and would probably use a little less next time, or try them with applesauce.

These cookies are delicious!!  I am so glad to have a great cookie that is not full of sugar!  I used unsweetened dried blueberries (Trader Joe's) instead of dates and they are wonderful!

I used about 1/4 cup canola oil and added tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. These taste to me like little bites of banana nut bread which I like but I must admit that they do have that taste of a "healthy snack" Too bad we couldn't add chocolate chips without adding extra calories! Will make a good morning snack to run out the door with but not something I would crave when my sweet tooth is aching.

I tried these using applesauce instead of oil. I was not very excited after eating them. I won't be trying them again. :o(

I tried them again.....
This time I used the oil, and added raisins and pecans. I also made them into bars as another review suggested. They were much better. They are now on my staple when I'm dieting. Thanks.

My husband absolutely LOVED these.  He couldn't believe that they don't have any flour or sugar added.   He thought I was kidding when I said that they are actually a healthy treat.  I will definitely make these again.

I wasn't especially crazy about these but I also didn't follow the recipe exactly so my 3 star rating may not be totally fair. In keeping the "cookie" healthy, I used applesauce in place of the oil, added walnuts, chopped apples, used raisins along with the dates and increased the oatmeal as well as adding cinnamon. They came out edible but not really what I was hoping for.

Really good healthy snack, not so much a cookie though.  I did sub Sunsweet Lighter Bake for the oil, used dried cherries (that's what I had on hand) and slivered almonds.  Took the advice of a few other reviewers also and added a dash of cinnamon and some sugar free maple syrup to the bananas for sweetness.  Very yummy!

My friend calls these "cancer patient cookies" hahaahaha. Apparently she feels like she's eating hospital food. eh. The bananas I used were not very ripe, so the overall cookie was not sweet at all. I made another batch with some brown sugar and pecans. I would suggest adding some kind of nuts in these cookies because they ARE rubbery and you might appreciate the crunch. I also replaced the oil with apple sauce. I didn't mind though, I felt healthy eating these and didn't feel bad about grabbing 4 cookies. It's just a nice snack to have around without feeling bad (you actually feel pretty good for making such a healthy choice!) just don't expect a normal cookie.. haha. Add some stevia or honey in there to make it sweet if you want to!

I just tried this recipe. I dont like dates so I used chocolate chips instead. Kind of defeats the whole healthy thing but the were AWESOME. They were better than my grandma's banana chocolate chip cookies with less than half the calories.

OK. My husband RAVED about these!!! He actually used the word "fantastic". After reading several reviews, I chose to add nutmeg, cinnamon, 1/2 c white chocolate chips, a dash of salt, and 1/2 c craisins in place of dates. They taste good, but are very soft and easily fall apart. I would make them again. I wonder if powdering half the oatmeal would make a difference. I will add walnuts, I think, next time.

Nutritious, yes.  Delicious, no.  I made these with a couple of the suggestions of other reviewers, using apple sauce instead of oil, spiced rum instead of vanilla, and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  They turned out so bad, my 1 year old vegan nephew wouldn't even eat them.  Perhaps if I had have used oil they would have been better, so I can't really give this a low rating, but I REALLY wouldn't suggest using apple sauce.  And I would suggest adding a little salt, as well as perhaps a little honey or sugar to sweeten.

Yum.  These are very tasty and guilt free.  I didn't have dates so I used 1 cup of diced apple.  I think it would have been better with dates.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup maple syrup.  Great vegan cookie!

If you plan to make these, I would suggest reading lots of reviews and making some of the changes suggested by others (ie adding cinnamon, other spices etc) because unfortunately, these didn't have much taste to them. They didn't taste bad, they just kind of lacked taste. I think they definitely needed some sort of sweetener - honey or maple syrup would work great and would be healthier than refined sugar. I will probably give these another try with some changes, because I like the idea of a "healthy cookie".

I would give these cookies only 3 stars if they weren't so darn healthy! I had no dates so I used prunes. I also substituted some peanut butter for most of the oil and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall they were just ok, but I liked that they used up my overripe bananas and satisfied a craving for baked goods without being full of sugar. That being said, I will probably make these again, maybe adding some nuts for crunch.

Great for toddlers!! My youngest boy loves it! I add "Rice e Mixed Fruit" baby cereal and wheat germ. Also I substitute the oil for apple sauce (with calcium)and the dates for raisins.  I love it because it's home made, natural and a good source of iron. Now that I know the consistency I use only one banana at a time and bake every other day.

Wow I am surprised! I did add 1/3 cup of honey a little cinnamon sub raisins for dates and I splashed some imitation maple flavor in just because I had it. These are so good! I know my husband will approve and they are so healthy. Someone looking for a very sweet crunchy cookie wouldn't like these but I think they are a great snack when you want a treat but don't want to throw your healthy habits out the window.

I was skeptical...I mean there's no sugar here!  But my picky and sugar-hungry teens ate them and actually told me they were good.  They're strangely addictive.  I will definitely make again because we're getting awfully tired of banana bread to use up the old bananas.

These healthy cookies are great! I definiltely think it's important to add to the recipe and make them your own! I added chopped apples and raisins, instead of dates. My kids loved them and I love knowing that they are eating a healthy snack/cookie! Next time I make them I am going to try a few more new add-ins!

Not sure if it was because I used really over ripe bananas or quick oats, but my cookies turned out bad tasing and tough-chewy. Adding semi sweet chocolate chips wasn't a good idea either because the flavors did not mix well.

I really like the texture of these cookies.  I didn't add oil, used applesauce instead.  I added 2 tablespoons of reduced fat peanut butter for more flavor and 1 almond on top of each cookie for crunch.  My Vegan Mom loved them.

Definitely healthy. And I love healthy. I thought they tasted goof and my toddler loved them and helped me make them... These probably wouldn't fly with someone who is not into healthy eating, though. I made them with apple sauce instead of oil and used a small handful of dried cranberries instead of the cup of dates.

I made these with my 1 year old nephew and 3 year old niece in mind. Considering the simple ingredients and no added sugar, these were not bad.  I halved the recipe and added extra banana so I could leave out the oil.  Instead of vanilla I put in a dash of clove and nutmeg.  I baked them for 7 minutes at 325 then another 13 at 350.  They were moist and not rubbery at all.  They tasted pretty good too. The sweetness came from the banana and apricots and dates that I added.  I probably wont make these for myself but I think its a healthy treat for kids.

I had family over for a healthy dinner, and I made these for dessert.  They were a big hit.  I made them without any changes and I didn't think the oil was too much.  Next time, I think I'll try a tangier dried fruit like cranberries or appricots.

Personally, I really liked these. I added a little coconut and cinnamon. I'm into healthy eating, so I don't mind the little differences that might happen when you leave out "bad" ingredients. These were very slightly rubbery (maybe my fault?) and I would hesitate before I offer them to others. My 16 month old grandson loves them!

Very tasty, healthy, soft and chewy. Used applesauce instead of oil, 1 tsp cinnamon plus 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and craisins. I even forgot to put in the vanilla and they were still good.

Tasty and a cookie I can feel good about eating! I used only 1/4 cup of oil and upped the oats to 3 cups. I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon. I also added a pinch of salt to bring out the natural sweetness of the bananas. This cookie is not overly sweet. The combos of fruits, nuts, chocolate, etc. add-ins are limitless. I'm going to make these for my diabetic mother-in-law for mother's day.

Overall not a bad recipe.  Keep in mind it is a Healthy Cookie.  I took another reviewers suggestion and added 2T of crunchy PB to the mix.  I also added a small amount of cinnamon/sugar to the top before baking.  I will be using this recipe again.

This is a great recipe for the kiddos, I'll keep it for when I have some of my own! :) I added a good number of fruits and spices. Don't go easy on the cinnamon! I sweetened it up with about 1/3 cup of honey and used applesauce rather than oil. Yummy but a little too soft and gooey for the adults in my family.

Usually I agree with reviews but not this time. These "cookies"  taste terrible & have an awful texture. Am giving them a one star rating because I have to to post but especially for the hilarity they caused as I watched my "will eat anything hubby" struggle (unsuccessfully) to swallow. Sorry.

Dosen't look pretty but taste great. I took the advice of others and added my own fruit, I did use olive oil instead of applesauce because I didn't have applesauce it turned out fine. The cookies lasted one day!! kids ate it up. Will use again and again

I'm not usually so harsh but these were not good.  Tried them without modifications.... I then modified as per some reviews; added some cinnamon and nutmeg...Not even adding chocolate chips could save these.

these were really good! i substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil like the previous raters - so i gave this a four since that's not how it was originally written. mine turned out a little dry but i used half rolled oats and half spelt flakes - so i think i would increase the applesauce.  my hubby has already eaten half a dozen!

Wow!  These are great!  You would never know they had no sugar.  My kids devoured them for breakfast.  I followed recipe exactly.  Next time I might experiment and try adding peanut butter instead of oil since I like the flavor of PB with bananas.

Very easy.  Used raisins instead of dates and applesauce instead of oil. Added about 1/2 cup of mini choco chips.  very chewy - kinda like oatmeal.  I also want to try these with apples!   Update - nobody ate them except my 1 year old!!  Maybe with apples or something.  Still 3 stars becuz it is so nutritious and I thought they were ok.

I think the name "cookies" is deceiving. These are more like baked oatmeal bars than the warm, gooey cookies you expect. I substituted applesauce as well, and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, craisins, chopped apples, and a couple tbl of agave nectar to help sweeten. The kids weren't fooled into eating these, but I enjoyed them as a healthy alternative!

I love these cookies.  I have made them as the recipe calls for and they are yummy.  I have also made them with: chocolate chips, nuts, raisins, sunflower seeds, milled flax, ...  They are a good base for adding whatever healthy stuff you want.  They make an excellent healthy breakfast cookie or snack.  My kids who are 3 and 6 love them!  I additional note:  They may take longer to bake.  I just make sure they are beginning to brown on top.  I also always use my stoneware to bake them on.

id rather just have a bowl of oatmeal with stuff in it than these cookies, it tastes the same and has the same texture. Also the dates must add a lot of volume because i had 18 small 2 inch diameter cookies and the recipe says it makes twice that many cookies

I must admit that when I first tried these, about an hour after baking, I was disappointed. I thought they were pretty bland. The next day-I tried them again and found them to be a really satisfying snack. We gobbled them up pretty quickly. My four year old loved them. These are not your typical oatmeal cookie so don't expect the same sweetness. I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe. I used a large jar of baby food bananas AND a large ripe banana. (I needed to get rid of the jar of baby food) I used applesauce in place of the oil and threw in a handful of walnuts since I usually enjoy that flavor combination. I will certainly be making these again and I think the next time I will try it with chopped bananas. A wonderful guilt free HEALTHY snack.

I thought these cookies were fabulous for being "healthy".  I took the advice of some other members and did the apple sauce and raisins instead of the oil and dates.  The were a hit!  Thanks!

First I will start with saying the only reason this got any stars at all is maybe it was opperator error on the taste of these.  They were so aweful that I couldn't even finish one & I threw the rest in the garbage.  I did as others say, added cinnamon, nutmeg, & applesauce instead of oil, which I do in all my baking recipes & it works out great.  I did use raisins instead of dates b/c I don't like them, I also added a few chopped walnuts for protein.  I am a total beleiver, if you follow a recipe, it should be comparable to others feelings on it.  Recipes are easy to do!  The only thing that could have been wrong with these is if the bananas weren't enough.  Unfortunately, the recipe says 3 bananas.  That is not a measurement since bananas are differant sizes.  I have a banana bread recipe that also says 3 bananas...or 1 cup.  So, if my 3 bananas weren't what the recipe maker didn't have in mind, that is the only problem their could be.  I didn't even both making the entire batch or sharing them with my family since i couldn't even stomach the one I tried.  YUK!!!

I liked the ingredients for this recipe, but unfortunately they don't taste good after they've cooled down because they are not soft anymore, and eating them warm tastes better, more like banana bread.

These were good, but they needed some tweaking. Instead of the oil I used applesauce, and instead of dates I used raisins. I also added 1/3C honey and 1/2C oats as suggested in someone else's review, which I think was a good idea. I added maybe 2-3t cinnamon and a pinch each of nutmeg and cloves because otherwise the cookies were a bit bland. I think they would have been better (sweeter) if I'd have used more banana, but I only had one ripe one, so I added one and a half diced apples in place of the other two bananas. I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 3, assuming they'd be better with more banana like the recipe calls for.

These are great! I've mixed in all sorts of things and always, the turn out wonderful. My favorite is chopped up apples instead of dates and pumpkin puree instead of oil. I've also mixed in a cup of Bran.

These are so easy to make and very yunmmy! I didn't have dates so I used raisins, added 2 teaspoons of all natural peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of apple pie spice and then substituted oil for unsweetened applesauce. They turned out beautifully when I put them on foil to prevent sticking like othes suggested. Great for a quick breakfast treat when I don't have time for a bowl of oatmeal!

I have never written a review but I felt the need.  I am always looking for healthy snacks or ways to get my three toddlers to eat nutritiously.  I made these with the applesauce substitution and my oldest two refused to eat them after the first bite.  I waited excitedly while my one year old took a bite said mmmm made a face, looked at it, and threw it at me!!!! I understood why after tasting them.  Sometimes we should just let kids be kids and not rob them of their cookie experiences, I guess!!! I would say, with the apple sauce, minus perhaps the raisins, it would be good for babies just starting to eat solids.  Too bad!

I made some changes based on other reviews.  These were weird looking, but good right out of the oven after the changes.  I subsituted 1.5 cups of raisins for the dates-no dates on hand plus no chopping to do. I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 T Pure maple syrup, and subsituted 1/2t almond extract for vanilla for more flavor.  Next time I might add some cinnamon and more almond extract.  Don't know what they'll be like when they've cooled, but now they are good and mostly guilt-free!

Not bad for a healthy cookie! I added 4 scoops of soy protein and turned them into my own Siegal Diet Cookies. I will freeze them and have a 4 or 5 a day like on the cookie diet.

These were fantastic! Make sure to mince those dates really fine and mix them in well. Also I added a cup of chopped walnuts that really took it up a notch:) Some people may think they aren't sweet enough but to me they are perfect.

I took other suggestions & used applesauce instead of oil, altho did splash a BIT of oil in also.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins & didn't add any extra spices... all that said, not a big fan of these at all.  weird consistency, kind of rubbery.  I might try them again, tweeking a bit (and back to raisins & cinnamon).  I hope it works too, love the IDEA of these, just not the cookie itself so much.

I stumbled accross this recipe looking for banana bread cookies. WOW oh wow. I LOVE it. I used raisin instead of dates and it worked out just fine. I think I will be reading through the reviews for other options.  They are so healthy to top it all off. You can't do any better with a cookie than this!

I love bananas and i love oatmeal, but this just didn't do it for me.When you are baking the cookies they smell so good! When I bit into it i was so disappointed!! Even though there was a lot of banana in it, the flavor was so bland! I even put cinnamon sugar but that could not save it. I would not make this again, it was rubbery, bland, and just not satisfying. I suggest to just eat a banana or oatmeal instead. Please listen!! I read everyone's reviews, but I'm used to eating healthier food so I had high hopes. It just doesn't work

I love these cookies! They are so healthy and delicious! I didn't used any oil after all! I only used banana and added some (1 tbs) Maple syrup, some rum extract, added some almonds (chopped)and a little bit of custard (liquid). My plan was to add applesauce but wenn it came out of the microwave, they turned out being dried.. just added them, baked the cookies and I love it! My recipe holds about 12 cookies.
Thank you very, very, very much!

I was really excited to try out these cookies. I didn't have any dates so i used apples instead and instead of the oil i used apple sauce. They turned out really well, Crispy on the outside and warm and oatmeally on the inside. I would recommend eating them fresh out of the oven because I found they tasted soggy when they cooled. Next time I plan on trying chocolate chips instead of the dates...mmm cannot wait!!

After reading a few reviews, I decided to make a few changes to this recipe.  With these changes, it turned out great! Even my picky 2 year old like them.   I added about 1/2 cup of grape nuts to add some texture, used only 1/4 cup oil and added about 1/4 cup or so applesauce.  I added cinnamon, raisins, and a tablespoon or so of raw sugar.  They turned out great!

These taste more like banana bread, then cookies.  I added chocolate chips and a little cinnamon sugar since I was worried they would be to bland.

I just made these cookies and have decided to make another batch. Be sure to double up on the portions these cookies won't last long. So healthy. I can't believe how tasty they are but yet very little ingredients.
You can also add some nuts.

These cookies are a healthy way to fill a sweets craving. Plus they're great for vegan and lactose intolerant friends.
I switched out the oil for Smart Balance Lite buttery spread(contains omegas and flax) and used semi sweet chocolate chips.

I made these into bars as other reviewers suggested.  These tasted like a bowl of soggy oatmeal baked in the oven...  I wasnt expecting it to be anything other than it was, given no extra sugar, flour etc... but the texture was just too much for me... Very soggy, and i even baked for 40 mins.  I'd rather toast up the oatmeal into a granola and make bars from there...

I really liked these and will make them again.  At first I was a bit unsure as they are definitely different from a normal cookie with flour and sugar- but they certainly satisfied my sweet tooth.  I added 2 tbsp olive oil instead of the called for amount of oil, substituted half the chopped dates for dried cranberries and added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice - YUM!

I've made some pretty unusual stuff before, but cookies with no sugar? I was a little doubtful about how these would come out. But they came out delicious! I don't see the use of the oil in the recipe though. My dough was verging on too watery with just the mashed bananas. I also added a pinch of nutmeg, but I think I'll add something more next time, maybe some walnuts? Awesome, thank you!

They're definitely healthy, but I don't know what else to say about them. They aren't chewy or crunchy. In fact, they taste exactly like hardened oatmeal with raisins. I might as well make oatmeal with raisins next time. Nevertheless, the recipe wasn't a complete flop, which is saying something, since I'm a novice cook. Alterations I made: chopped a square of Dove's almond and cranberry chocolate, mixed it into the batter for two cookies. Those turned out yummier than the rest. If I ever make these again, I would substitute applesauce for the oil.

I really wanted to like these and I didn't.  They just tasted weird.  I'm glad I scaled the recipe down to 12.  My toddler was happy enough to eat them but they aren't for us.  Only thing I added was some chunky apple sauce and some raisins.  I won't be making these again.  To be honest, unless there is a reason why you can't have flour it's pretty easy to make a regular banana oatmeal cookies healthy when you make the right substitutions.  They would turn out tastier than these.

I thought these cookies were wonderfully delectable.  I did not cook them as long as the recipe called for, just enough so they still held together.  They were soft, and really tasty!

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but, I felt compelled to do so with this one.  As a Lifetime WW Core follower, I am always searching for healthy alternatives.  I made these with bananas and fresh blueberries.  I was very excited to try one but I did not care for this at all.  Thank goodness I only made 24 cookies and wasted 2 bananas.  The oil amount (3 Tbsp) was excessive.  I could not get them off the cookie sheet.  I am beside myself and wish I hadn't wasted my time making these-that is how horrid these were.  Next time, I will follow my own instincts as to what I make.  I had a feeling they would be too oily and chewy-weird, but I gave them a whirl anyways.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!

Very good healthy cookie recipe. I made a few changes:
-Like other reviews I substituted applesauce for the oil
-I add raisins, toasted walnuts and pecans, and dried apricots
-Added more nutmeg and allspice
Tastes like soft granola!

I will definitely be making these and freezing them to keep on hand. However, as stated in other reviews, these cookies are not sugary and sweet tasting. I guess I thought they would be a little more naturally sweet than they are, but they are good none the less.

Overall, I liked these cookies.  I used raisins instead of dates, but aside from that I didn't change anything.  They were rather difficult to keep together before and after baking, though.

This is a good standby for healthy snacking.  My bananas weren't very ripe, and I think they helped hold the shape of the cookies I formed.  I used half raisins and half prunes for the dates, because that's what I had on hand, and whizzed them in the food processor to chop.  I tossed everything else in the recipe into the food processor on top of them and combined it that way (not over-doing it), and it was super fast.

Tastes pretty good. The word "cookie" seems like a stretch though - they are more of a muffin top or breakfast bar or something. Adding some kind of sugar might make the "cookie" have a little more crisp. If you add dried fruit, make sure to cut into pretty small pieces - I cut apricots into ~6 pieces each and my husband thought they were way too big. We will probably experiment more with this one later. Great way to use up clearance bananas!

These are not a typical cookie.  Mine turned out to have a different texture than a regular cookie, but they weren't bad.  They were just different.  I could definitely get used to it knowing that they are healthier than a typical cookie.

Because these cookies are sweetened by fruit alone, I must give them five stars. They came out moist and delicious - similar to banana bread.  I had to change the recipe a bit because I recently moved to Italy and have not yet been able to find oats!  So, I used plain bran cereal instead.  I also threw in one egg, half chopped apple, half cup of flour and only a dash of oil. For additional taste and texture, I sprinkled the tops with chopped walnuts just before baking. Definitely a great recipie.

I can't believe it - I actually like these!  I am so addicted to sugar and flour, and having been trying to cut back, so finding tasty snacks is a challenge.  I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and a little ginger.  I used dried apricots because that's what I had handy, and added chocolate chips.  Turned out great!  Next time I will try them with dried cherries.  Thanks :-)

I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup chunky applesauce, 1 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla, 1/2 cup raisins, and because I like things sweet I added a sprinkle of splenda. I also chopped up some glazed walnuts I had in the cupboard. 

Next time I won't halve the recipe and I'll add more nuts. There will definitely be a next time.

found this recipe to bew AWESOME!  As some of the others, I also omitted the dates, and added:  an egg, almonds, pumpkin seeds, shredded coconut, raisin, chocolate chips, and a bit of sugar.  I also added double the oats!  Turned out great!  My kids ate them up!!

These are fantastic! I have mixed it up a little and used them more as bars than "cookies." They are a good base to add whatever you like. I have added different things such as cranberries, walnuts, carob chips and coconut (I also found out that I HATE carob chips). In some batches I omitted the oil altogether and used applesauce. They taste great to me, but I am used to sacrificing some things for the sake of health.

I'm not sure how my family will like these.  I made them while everyone (except the baby) was at school and work.  I feel good about eating them, and the taste was good.  I added allspice, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice.  I'd like to try to substitute applesauce for the oil as others have suggested.  Thank you for a cookie that you don't have to feel guilty about!

wow. I cannot tell you how impressed I am with these cookies. My son has about 12 major food allergies, and this is something he can eat! I did add 2tsp.cinnamon and about half a tsp of pumpkin spice, and 1 tbsp of brown sugar. I don't think I'll add the sugar next time, they're sweet enough without it. I will be making this cookie around the clock. What a treat.

Pretty good for a healthy treat!  For the oil, I used about 1/4 cup of "lite" applesauce and 2 TB. of Smart Balance oil.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and might add more next time and might try adding some honey.  I also added about 1/2 cup of pecan pieces.  I baked them for 12 minutes and sprinkled with a sugar free "sugar" and cinnamon blend.

These "snacks" are a healthy alternative to cookies.  I substituted the oil with unsweetened applesauce and added some cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor.  I shared this recipe with my weight loss group and it was a success!

Wow!  What an easy and HEALTHY recipe!  I had all the ingredients at home except for the dates.  Instead I substituted dried orange cranberries plus a dash of cinnamon.  I think I have found a great thing to grab and go for breakfast.  Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are very bland. I did add raisins to them and that's all I can really taste. I added some spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) but you can't really notice. I think we'll eat them anyway since we hate to waste food and they're not altogether horrible.

Great recipe.  I feel good letting my toddler eat them. I use butter instead of oil. On my second batch I used two bananas and 1/3 cup applesauce and they came out great.  I also chopped the dates so they would distribute more evenly throughout the cookie.  I spooned the cookies on the sheet while waiting for the 15 min sit time and all was fine.

This recipe was great! I didn't have dates on hand, but I had frozen blueberries so I used those instead. Almost gave it a more "muffin" like feel rather than being like a cookie. But I'll ditto what other people are saying: definitely came out very moist and are sweet enough to satisfy. :)

Nice idea, but these just did not turn out for me. I tried twice to make sure the first time wasn't just a fluke, but both times they were weird, rubbery, and tasteless, even with the addition of cinnamon and salt. If I want a healthy sweet with these ingredients, I'd rather just make granola bars or a banana bread with applesauce in place of the oil. For a healthy cookie, try the yogurt chocolate chip cookies (on this site) instead for something that actually tastes like a cookie.

I thought these were great.  But I went into it knowing they were healthy "cookies".  My fiance- not so much.  He thought they were good but was expecting something else.  I ate them all and made another batch the next day.  I used raisins instead of dates and really ripe bananas so that there was no problem with sweetness.

I left out the dates. I was surprised at how delicious these cookies were.  My bananas were not extremely ripe, which I think helped the dough stay together. I did not need an egg. Definitely add some cinnamon and maybe cook another 8-10 mins then directed. Be prepared for a strangely textured cookie. I will absolutely make them again!!

I found these not at all sweet or all that great. I did add cinnamon and it probably needs a very small amount of salt too.

I needed a recipe for my sister who is allergic to wheat so I made these.  But I took out the dates, added an egg and some extra oatmeal.  After they had cooled I dipped the tops in some semi sweet chocolate.  They are amazing but don't keep for long so make sure they are eaten within a couple days or they go soggy

These are awesome! I would recommend trying all different types of dried fruits. I like cherries. If you want to add some chocolate to satisfy a craving mini chocolate chips work great.

Yum. I decided to make these into bars instead of cookies, because of all the reviewers who said they had trouble shaping and moving the cookies. Like many of the others, I didn't have dates and opted for diced apples instead. I also added some cinnamon, allspice, Splenda brown, and mini chocolate chips. They turned out yummy and addictive. I'll definitely make these again and experiment with different add-ins.

If you think of this more as a breakfast or snack option, it's not so disappointing.  I thought it was quite good, although not at all a cookie.  I added molasses and some cinnamon.  Easy healthy grab for breakfast, I think!

These came out quite good. I added some leftover granola cereal, instant banana oatmeal mix and cinnamon to the mixture. These would also be good with some coconut added. I baked these for 15 minutesand thet came out nice and chewy. Good cookie to bake on this rainy day!

For a "healthy" cookie - I think this is a terrific recipe!  (These are not your typical "sugared down" cookies!) I did add a bit of Splenda (2 Tbsp) and cinnamon.. they are good and good for you!  They are better "flattened" out a bit to cook more evenly, only takes 16 or 17 mins to cook.  Next time I'll try walnuts too!

These are edible but not that great.  I tried them because I was craving a cookie but I didn't want all the sugar and fat.  They turned out rubbery and pretty bland.  But what can you expect with a diet cookie?  My girls (ages 6 and 2) ate them but I think that they would eat anything labled as a "cookie".  Oh and I replaced the oil with yogurt so maybe that's where the rubbery consistancy comes from?

These cookies were great! Very yummy despite being flour and sugar free. Also very simple to make. I also used raisins instead of dates. Delicious treat without feeling guilty.

I made these for Christmas along with my regular baking, and everyone loved them. I have diabetes and found I could fit a couple into my daily meal plan.  They're wonderful - moist and delicious.

These were terrible! I had high hopes since it seems hard to find recipes that don't have a ton of sugar added. But these were inedible. My three kids- when offered a cookie separately, all refused to eat more than one bite. I threw the rest of the batter in the trash. They were very gluey and tasteless. The healthy cookie search continues

I thought these were good. They aren't traditional cookies, since they have no sugar, butter, or eggs, so they are a little different, but I thought they were fine for what they were. They were much better and more cookie-like the next day. I used cinnamon also.  I think the dates are really important for the sweetness and texture, so I'm not surprised the people who substituted raisins didn't like the cookies as much.

Not impressive. I subbed raisins for dates and peanut butter for oil. These weren't that great. I was interested in a healthy grab-on-the-go morning snack. These won't be made again. Thanks anyway.

I don't know if it's because I didn't use the dates or raisins (my dad just wanted plain), but these turned out really bad for me. They didn't spread, so they stayed in lumps, and they just tasted like regular oatmeal.

Those cookies are great!! I love healthy food, but it is always hard to find recipes to make healthy cookies. Those are certainly one of the healthiest cookies I've ever made and they taste delicious! thanks for this great recipe!

like most people, i was a bit disappointed given the reviews.  something was simply missing.  I replaced the oil with organic cherry applesauce and also substituted the dates for golden raisens and added cinnamon and a little extra vanilla extract.  the cookies were ok, but they were definately bland. not what i was expecting.  i might make them again because they crave my sweet tooth to an extent. and i usually don't care too much about flavorless "healthy" food--which is exactly what these cookies were.  on the contrary, my boyfriend loved them and ate a whole pan!  but he admitted he wouldn't have eaten them if it weren't for the raisens.

So, I read the reviews of this cookie before making it and thought I'd like it since I like healthy foods, but no.  I didn't like it one bit, neither than my husband and he eats everything.  I even followed all the recomendations on what to add.  I would not reccomend these, even if you usually like healthy cookies.

This cookie tastes alright, but I was disappointed given its high rating. It is definitely not a viable alternative to a "non-healthy" cookie.

I thought I'd love these cookies because I love all things banana and date, but they really just didn't do it for me. I wish I would have liked these since they're such easy and low calorie cookies to make, but I just didn't enjoy the flavor or texture of them at all.

Pretty good.  I am going to try applesauce instead of oil next time.  Really easy to make and very healthy.

These were alright.  They had a very fruity taste, which might be due to the apple sauce in place of the veg oil.  Good for a healthy snack though!
