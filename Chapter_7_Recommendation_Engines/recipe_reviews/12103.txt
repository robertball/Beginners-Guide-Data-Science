This pumpkin pie is the best recipe I have ever made.  The condensed milk makes it so sweet and the perfect consistency.  I made 3 other recipes before I found this one.  My search is over, it has been added to the family cookbook.

Great recipe.  I did make 2 changes.  First, we don't like our desserts overly sweet, so I only added 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  It had plenty of sweetness from the sweetened condensed milk.  Also, I added a pinch of salt to help bring out the flavors.  I added this to my recipe box and will be making it again for sure!  Thanks!

This was my first time ever making a pumpkin pie.  It turned out wonderful.  My uncle thought I bought it.  The only thing I would not do is brown the crust ahead of time.  Mine got too brown.  Other than that, this recipe is a keeper in my family!

This pie has good texture but is sickening sweet. Overpoweringly sweet. I would not recommend this pie.

Very nummy, creamy and rich pie!  "Two YUMS up"  :)

My 8 year old had a blast helping me, then when it cooled enough - - she gave everyone a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

UNBELIEVABLE.  No one in my family actually eats pumkin pie by choice.  But at Thanksgiving everyone smiles politely and takes a piece because it is tradition.  This pie disappeared off everyone's plate including my 7 yr old and 4 yr old.  What my children are most looking forward to at Christmas dinner is another pumpkin pie.

This has become the favorite pumpkin pie of my family, friends, co-workers, etc.  I use fresh pumpkin, instead of canned, which makes it even better!

This pie turned out delicious. The ingredients yielded a little more than my 9-inch pie pan would hold so I used the rest of the batter to make muffins. I will definitely use this recipe next year!

This pie was very easy to make, and turned out great!  Plenty of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and days afterwards.  It's rich, so you can't eat too much ;]

There is no way I would make this pie as written, much less eat it. I like sweets, but a can of condensed milk plus 3/4 cup of sugar, is way too much to sweeten one pie. Makes me cringe just thinking about it!

I have tried to find the best way to cook the pumpkin to make a proper puree for these recipes and everyone seems to think I have a grandmother that passed this part along
