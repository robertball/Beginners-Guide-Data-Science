Although there is no such thing as "Salmon Yakitori," since "Yakitori" roughly means "cooked bird," this recipe still works well with fish, too.

altho this recipe didnt really have any reviews, i was excited to try it as i like the flavor of those marinade ingredients. i had my salmon marinated for a day and was even worried the salmon would be too salty/sweet. i was also worried about the possibility of the salmon burning black as that's what happens w/sugar when heated. when i cooked it per the recipe directions, my salmon did burn/turn black and it wasnt even cooked all the way through! tried to salvage it to make it at least edible by covering it and letting it sit so it cooks, but well, pretty disappointing :(

I used this recipe to marinate the salmon and some mahi mahi. I then grilled the fish. My boys scarfed it down.  So Yummy!!

This was very tasty with a hint of sweetness. I cooked it on medium heat so it wouldn't burn and it turned out great. Will make again.
