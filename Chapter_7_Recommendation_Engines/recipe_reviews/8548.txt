I rubbed the chicken with fresh garlic for a few minutes before seasoning it.  The chicken itself tasted fine, and the sauce was good over rice, but the bell pepper turned very sour and bitter as it soaked up the liquid.  I usually mix a bit of water in with the lemon juice and wine, so I think that's why I found the flavors too strong.  Still, I would NOT use a vegetable with its own strong flavor (like green bell pepper) for this recipe: try celery or potato instead, and keep the bell pepper for fajitas or salad.

OK for a quick dinner. I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked for 35 minutes.

I made this without the onions and peppers, as other reviewers suggested, and it turned out wonderful. Very moist and delicious served with rice and vegetables. And with prep time of just minutes, who can complain?!

I made this recipe with some chicken breasts but omitted the bell pepper. It was delicious! Just a hint of the lemon flavor, was really nice but I may try it with just a touch more next time. Will be making again!

Why has this been waiting for a picture for 13 years?  I cooked this UN covered for about 45 minutes - the onions were crispy and delicious.  I omitted the bell pepper but would use red and yellow peppers next time.  I used a seasoning blend adapted from Heather's Fried Chicken, this site, which is a combo of  2 tablespoons black pepper, 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon paprika, and 1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt.  Just barely sprinkled the chicken with the seasoning.  The juice makes for an awesome gravy.

This is a little bit on the bland side for me, but my 26 month old absolutely loves it (especially the "juice" as she calls it.) I make it with bone-in chicken pieces (thighs usually), and I chop the onion and bell pepper into quite large chunks so that they don't get overcooked and mushy. We have it with steamed broccoli and egg noodles. My little one gives it two thumbs up! Thanks, Audrey!

My family loved it. Bell peppers were yummy with it I used Red but I think all of them would be good. Served with “squished red potato’s” and we also had a side of green beans and dinner rolls. 
 Yummy easy dinner

This dish was easy to prep and delicious!! I make the dish exactly per the recipe.  I read about the green peppers turning out bitter, I did not have that experience but I did slice my green peppers very thinly to allow to cook through. I served with rice, which most often, I substitute the called for water with chicken broth, and green beans.  Fabulous! Definitely earned a spot in my go-to dishes.

We were looking for something different, and this was it.  It was a really good meal.  I didn't have lemons, but I had limes.  The meal wasn't bland, like some reviewers stated.  I don't know if this will be a standard menu item, but we will definitely make it again.
