At first, I giggled b/c the cream of mushroom soup and the red wine made a purple concoction.  As the chops cooked, everything turned a dark gray.  Anyway, I will use less red wine or none at all next time.  That was quite strong in the flavor.  This is a good easy meal, if you aren't a fancy cook.  Just, go easy on the wine.   Mashed potatoes go really well with this dish.

I made this but tweaked it quite a bit.  First I seasoned the pork chops with cajun seasoning and then pan seared them for about 3 minutes on each side.  Then I put them in the crock pot with the cream of mushroom soup and 2 cloves of chopped garlic.  I 86'ed the wine because I just didnt have any on hand.  I let the chops cook then about an hour before they were done I added sliced button mushrooms....served it with mashed potatoes and it came out great!

We will try it without the red wine next time. That's all we tasted was alcohol. Do not use the low fat, low sodium...if you do, add plenty of salt and other seasonings to make up for it. Was not impressed.

I LOVED this recipe.  My husband put pepper on the chops and pressed them into the cooker.  Then followed the recipe as directed but instead of red wine he used ammaretto.  We served with mashed potatoes.  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.

I love this recipe for a super easy weeknight dinner. I had to add peper, but that was it. I love that it wasn't too salty, since pork tends to be a salty meat. You could do apple juice or cider if you don't like red wine, but I loved it as-is!

I really tweaked this recipe a bunch. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, but I did have 1/2 a tub of ranch chip dip. I didn't have red wine open, so I used white wine. I added a shot of Worshestishire sauce b/c I like the flavor. I did everything else pretty much like the recipe (I think). I kept the sauce & passed it to my mom who used it as a base for a chicken dish as well. My hubby & 19 month old liked it too.

I received this recipe from a good friend.  The recipe is simple (actually took me longer to take the cork out of the wine bottle than to make the dinner!!) and tasty.  I made my in the oven at 350 degrees and cooked for 1 1/2 hours.  Yummy!

i wanted everyone to know that i did try this recipe and found it to be a good easy meal.in avoiding the red wine over taste to the dish i added a whole large 15 oz can of the mushroom soup as opposed to the regular sized can it calls for and we had no taste of the wine at all other than just the slight hint for flaver to the sauce itself...this seemed an easy work around for those of you who thought the wine too much or would like it for seasoning but not to make the pork "drunken" hope this helps...try it again or if you use it try this to see what you prefer.it really isnt a bad dish

I had only four hours to whip this up in the crock pot so I put it on high for 6 chops. I added Worcestershire sauce to the mix because it goes so well with pork. We adore garlic so there were five smaller cloves minced instead of just two. I also like spice so I added some Montreal steak spice and put the pepper all over the chops. I finely chopped onion and the mushroom (to hide it from the 12 year old) and topped the meat with it and poured the sauce over it. It made such a lovely juice, I strained the liquid and made a gravy from it. Both dad and son gave me thumbs up. Deelish!

Very tasty as is.  Also tried it with a little less wine (1/4c) and added dried rosemary.

I used 5 boneless pork chops, two cans of cream of mushroom soup, pepper, two cloves of garlic, one can of mushrooms, and a splash of Moscato - what I had on hand. This was delish! My husband broke up the chops and I served them over mashed potatoes with a side of noodles. This would be great over egg noodles but I didn't have any on hand. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

I couldn't find red cooking wine so I used Pompeian Marsala Cooking wine. Also my chops were regular cut not thick. The flavor was awesome. The chops were tender but not to the point of falling completely apart. I made gravy with the juice.

WOW! Definitely a winner in my family. We didn't even need a knife to cut the chops, they were perfectly tender. I served them with mashed potatoes and broccoli normandy.

Used two cans of soup, a small amount of water and then the wine all mixed together. Added potatoes, mushrooms. Salt and pepper to dish before pouring over the sauce. Baked at 175c for less than 50 mins.

The recipe was great the wife and kids loved it. I made a few changes. I sauteed the mushrooms  with red wine, minced garlic, and butter, and served on the chops before spooning gravy over them.
