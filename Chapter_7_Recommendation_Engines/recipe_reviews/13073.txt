We enjoyed this at my house and it was simple to make.  I was worried about it being too spicey for my kids so I used mild picante sauce.  DH & I might have liked a little more zip but it still had a nice flavor and the kids liked it.  I added some chopped smoked turkey from my freezer and about 1 cup of black beans along with the corn and picante sauce.  I also used a bit less corn than called for.  This is a very rich dish but a nice winter warmer.  Leftovers the next day were very good too.  The second time I made this, I wanted to use my crock pot.  I combined all ingredients from step one in the crock and cooked for several hours.  I did the cream cheese step an hour or so before serving.  It worked great.

LOVED LOVED THIS CHOWDER!! I didn't have frozen corn so I used 2 14.5oz cans (drained). This recipe can EASILY be modified. Next time, I might add some shredded chicken or a can of black or northen beans but I made it as is (with the exception of using additional corn) and it was great! I had no problems with the cream cheese and it was great in this soup. Will make this again and again! Thanks Cathy!

As written this didn't work for me. The texture was odd and then if I stopped stirring for more than a few seconds the cream cheese would separate. I wouldn't exactly say bland but it lacked something so I added a little bit of Velveeta and that did the trick. As written I have to give it a 3. Adding Velveeta bumped it to a 4.

This chowder was quick, easy and absolutely delicious.  I omitted the margarine and used ultra-lite Philly and it came out great!

OOOHhhhh my gosh, this was good!  I added garlic to the onion, and a can of black beans to the soup.  This was the BEST soup I have ever had.  I crushed some tortilla chips on top, and was as happy as a clam!  It is almost gone, I have to make it again!

A really good soup that is quite different from anything else.  The cream cheese adds a wonderful creamy texture.  It was great served with hot homemade corn bread.

I added some cubed cooked chicken.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T".  I might use less cream cheese next time.

Yummy, great tex-mex flavor.  I used tomatoes with green chiles in place of salsa.  I also added cooked chicken and northern beans(what I happen to have).  Really great with corn bread.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

This hit the spot on a snow day! Although I added the following: 1 cup diced potatoes, 1/2 can garbanzo beans, 4 oz of Mexican Velveeta, cayenne pepper, and garnished with Cilantro leaves. yumm! This made a lot, but very nourishing and filling! Even my husband and the kids liked it.

Have made this a million times and still love it.  The best part is the next day it can serve as a dip as well.  Leave it cold and dip with some corn chips (scoops)...Great!!!  Recommend to everyone!!

This turned out to be very good, but I made a LOT of changes.  First I sauteed onions (1/2 cup) and 2 cloves garlic in butter.  Then I added all the spices and 3 large diced potatoes along with garlic salt and chicken broth.  When tender, I added the corn, more spices, milk (1 1/2 cups) and cream cheese.  The cream cheese was too overpowering, so I let it sit at the lowest temp for 1 hour and it was perfect!

My husband, who loves Mexican food, went on and on about this soup.  He couldn't get enough of it! I, who like Mexican food, thought it was very good, though just a tad too hot for my taste.

This tasted great and was so quick and easy.  I only made minor substitutions based on what I had on hand. I didn't have enough corn so I threw in some mixed veggies, needed to use some cream so I used that (6 oz) in combo with a bit of milk, vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and a little extra cumin and chili powder.  Delicious!  I served it with "jalapeño bread I" found on this site.

Excellent! My husband is a picky eater and he absolutely loved this soup! I made the soup exactly as the recipe said and I added some black beans to it as well... I though it would go well with the Tex-Mex theme. It turned out absolutely delicious. And it is especially good with crushed corn chips sprinkled on the top.

This was alright. I think the flavor of the soup really depends on the salsa you use and I'm not a huge fan of salsa soup (same for my boyfriend). I'd make this again but I'd omit the salsa and use fresh tomatoes and cook them with the onion and add some hot sauce later on - I think that would make it spicy and more soup and less salsa like.

I changed the recipe slightly:  I cooked chicken in broth, diced it, and then added it to the soup after adding the cream cheese.  It was excellent!  I will make this again and again.

This was very good and so easy to make.  I did make one change and that was to use beef broth and increase it to two cans.  It came out the perfect consistency for me.  My only regret was not doubling the recipe so I'd have more leftovers.  Will definitely be making this again.

This is a great, simple recipe that has terrific flavor.  I added black beans to this which made it even more delicious!  The recipe makes quite a bit so I was able to freeze some and can bring to work for lunch.  Thank you for sharing!

This was really good, it tasted better after I let it simmer for a while to let the flavors blend. I also added some garlic salt. The kids ate it with no complaints. I will make this again. Thanks alot!

This is really yummy!  I added a can of black beans as other reviewers suggested and thought it turned out great.  I used light cream cheese, and we crunched up tortilla chips in the soup.  I will definitely make this again and would make it for company :)

I like adding a Mexican flair to some traditional soups & stews, so I figured this was right up my alley.  I was not disappointed.  I used low-fat margarine, cream cheese & milk, and it was great.  Finished up the leftovers the next day and it had grown on me even more by then.  It'll probably be even better made in the winter. :-)

Good flavor!  A little too much onion especially if you're using a salsa with onion.

This is one of my staple dishes. It freezes well so you can double and store. You can omit the chicken broth and make a great dip. A great winter comfort food! Serve with cornbread for a nice meal.

Nice texture to this.  Also good with a can of black beans mixed in.  Hubby ate the whole thing, with a few splashes of hot sauce, over the course of a day.

I was really disappointed with this recipe after having read all the rave reviews.  I found the soup to be goopy, unappetizing and distasteful.  The cream cheese which I thought would be the central highlight, in fact, made it undesirable combined with the salsa/picante sauce.  It also looked messy and tasted like the ingredients was thrown in for a cheap meal.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I only used 1 cup of salsa, because that was all I had left, and the flavor was great!  I used light cream cheese, which blended in just fine.  I also added a larger can of canned chicken, which seemed to be a good amount.  Love having this quick and easy recipe on hand now!

This was good, but it tasted a lot like salsa.  If I had made it thicker (more flour, less broth/milk), and added chicken and black beans, this would be great as a creamy enchilada stuffing.

I thought this soup was ok, but my bf liked it. I think it just wasn't quite right... Maybe it was too thick for me? I think next time I would puree half (or more) to improve the texture. We'll finish the batch, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

THE SOUP WAS VERY GOOD. I CHANGED THE SERVINGS TO 6. I MADE THE RECIPE JUST AS DIRECTED. I ADDED A FEW SIMPLE INGREDIENTS. I ADDED SOME CHOPPED RED PEPPER AND COOKED IT WITH THE ONIONS UNTIL THEY BOTH WERE SOFT. I USED PACE PICANTE SAUCE (MILD). ANY MEXICAN OR TEX MEX DISH CAN'T BE WITHOUT CILENTRO, SO I ADDED ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS AT THE END OF THE COOKING PROCESS. THE 6 SERVINGS CALLED FOR A WHOLE BOX OF CREAM CHEESE(8oz) BUT TO ME THAT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE TO MUCH AND I DID NOT WANT TO OVERPOWER IT'S TAST WITH CREAM CHEESE, SO I ONLY ADDED HALF, WHICH WAS PERFECT. AND AT THE END I BLENDED WITH A IMMERSION BLENDER JUST A COUPLE OF TIMES. TURNED OUT GREAT.

I added some chicken, jalapenos, and black beans while cutting out the onions - the salsa took care of that.  I also used no-fat cream cheese so it seemed healthy as well.  Thanks a bunch!

I made this last winter, but I forgot to add in the milk.  I also added shredded chicken.  I cooked it in a slow cooker, and that worked well.  Even with forgetting to put in the milk, it was still yummy - but more like a dip.  I am making it tonight for our Christmas potluck (this time I'll add the milk!)

This tasted really good!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the last two directions are very unclear and need to be rewritten.

This recipe is so easy and hardy!  Great to use up leftover corn on the cobb.  I make this alot and will omit the chili powder and cumin and rely on the flavor of the salsa to carry it mildly. Love it!!!!

This is a great soup.  Just enough spices!  I did add a little more corn.
