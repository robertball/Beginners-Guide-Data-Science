Great easy dinner! I took other review suggestions: used jar spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup. I also cooked the meat with worchestershire sauce (dad's secret weapon in pasta) and added minced garlic. added italian seasoning, paprika and onion powder. Came out delicous and husband loves it! Tastes great served with garlic bread and a salad.

FOCUS: if you use a jar of spaghetti sauce you just made plain ol' spaghetti. most of the reviews werent helpful at all. oddly enough the ketchup works. i didnt have a garlic clove so i used garlic powder. hubby and toddler both ate it all up. no leftovers.

This was suprisingly very good.  It contains such simple ingredients, but in the end they blend together nicely.  Very easy to make and very tasty.  I recommend you try it!!!

My family really enjoyed this and it was easy to make.  I did use spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup and substituted italian sausage for the ground beef.

At first, I wasn't sure about ketchup in spaghetti but wanted to try this recipe as written and ended up really liking the tang!

This was very quick and easy and my family loved it.  I used a jar of pasta sauce instead of ketchup and replaced the peppers with mushrooms.  I also used mozzarella and parmasean cheese instead of the cheddar cheese.

Very good casserole.  Used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I used mozzerella and parmesean cheeses but will try cheddar next time.  A creative little take on plain old spaghetti night.

Great recipe!  I stuck with the ketchup, because I wanted to follow the recipe as it was for the first try.  It turned out great!  Thank you, we will definitely be having this again...

Simple combo of flavors and texture....fast and easy recipe. I used the spaghetti sauce and added fresh herbs and garlic....good flavor but will try layering (as other suggested) next time to prevent the cheesy brick on top. Will also add a more sauce.

This is a delicious recipe for serving a lot of people spaghetti. I followed the recipe pretty well, but I used 1 jar of spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup (yuck) and mixed shredded sharp cheddar cheese, mozzarella, and fresh grated Parmesan. It's so yummy this way and a favorite of everyone's!

Not my favorite; however, I plan to make again.  I have a picky 4.5yo eater who loved it.  I used the sauce instead of ketchup.  Next time I want to try half sauce/half ketchup.  Also, I'd like to try with Velveta cheese because I think it will melt better.

Everyone in the family really liked this recipe..it was quick and easy to make so I liked that! Only problem I had was the cheese didn't melt right and that made it hard to cut up and eat. I think I will layer the meat, pasta and cheese next time like a lasagna. ??

I didn’t have peppers or onions but it was still really good. I always cut the pasta amount in half. It would have been dry if I hadn’t.

One of my husband's favorites.  The ketchup instead of the spaghetti sauce gives a hint of sweetness and the cheddar cheese gives it a wonderful 'non-italian' spaghetti dish.

Was so amazed by this dish!  Made exactly as stated except for half sharp cheddar cheese and half Velveeta cheese.  It was so good!  Will make it often.  Thanks for recipe!

Only thing I did different was I tossed the spaghetti in some sauce before adding it.  I also added some on top.  We made it for a fundraiser and put it in 10X18 pans.  Froze the meat and assembled it after we cooked the spaghetti.  We had so many compliments.  We will make it again next year.

I don't know whether I had too much spaghetti and too little sauce. I did add some orange and yellow peppers and mushrooms to give it a better taste. Also put a tablespoon of Worcester sauce in the ground beef while cooking it.  Plenty left over so have frozen some for later and hope it turns out OK.

Quick and tasty. I did use spaghetti sauce since I had a jar open in the fridge that I needed to use. This would be a great way to reserve any leftover spaghetti :)

Eh....it was good, I used the ketchup as recipe said and kind of regretted it, it was a little too sweet for my tastes.  So, if I made it again, I would use spag. sauce as others did.  I didn't use the pepper and didn't miss it.  If I were to add anything else it would be mushrooms.  I also used mozzerella instead of cheddar and I would use it again, I love mozzerella.

Not bad, Iwas surprised, I think the next time I will try spag. sauce, it is nice because most of us have the ingredients on hand. Seems unusual to have the spag. on top, but it works?? I guess

This was just ok.  Used ketchup like the recipe called for otherwise it would just be plain old spaghetti.  Not bad but not great.
