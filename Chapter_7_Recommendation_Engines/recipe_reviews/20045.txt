We all really enjoyed these!  My kother-in-law gave me a great tip to make this recipe easier:  Put you cabbage head in the freezer, and freeze completely.  When you take it out and it thaws, the leaves will be wilted and very easy to work with, eliminating the process of boiling the cabbage---one less step!

5 stars (if you follow other reviewers' advice).  I am so glad I read the other reviews, because they turned out perfectly!  I, too, steamed the entire head of cabbage first, added some garlic powder to the beef mixture (I used 1/8 tsp - perfect!), doubled the sauce (a must!), and baked at 350 (covered with foil) for an hour, instead of using the slow cooker.  The only things I would change include using 3/4 tsp. pepper (1 1/4 tsp. was too spicy), and increase the onion to 1/2 cup for more flavor (which I did, and it was great!).  I measured exactly 1/4 cup for each roll, and I ended up with 10 rolls.  If you are pressed for time, you can substitute 1 Tbl. dried minced onion for the fresh onion.  The second time I made this, I sprinkled some salt on the rolls before adding the sauce, and that helped give it more flavor.  One more note: be SURE and use VERY lean beef - you don't cook the meat before rolling it into the cabbage leaves, so there will be no way to drain off the fat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is really just okay, but could be tweaked to make it better.

The sauce recipe needs to be quadrupled, because even a double batch leaves the rolls pretty dry.  I would also add a little tomato sauce to the ground beef mixture, and a little garlic and maybe a little mustard powder.

Also, you should know that the easiest way to prepare your cabbage is to core the head, and steam the entire thing.  If you try to peel the unsteamed leaves, you are going to tear them.

my 5 star rating is for this recipe as written.  I would give this 10 stars with my changes as it can be totally out of this world awesome with the alterations! I've been taught (by several Polish ancestors) to use half ground beef and half ground pork for tender, flavorful golumbki.  I cooked the rice in water with 2 beef bouillion cubes added to it. (don't add extra salt to the meat mixture though.) To the meat, I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. The pepper may seem like a lot but makes this dish sing! (well, it made my family sing...)  I tripled this recipe with great success.  If you're going through the trouble of making golumbki, make enough to freeze another meal or for a family gathering.  THANK YOU for asking us to boil the cabbage leaves rather than freeze them.  (Tripling this took 2 heads of cabbage and made about 48 rolls.) It makes all the difference between tender edible cabbage leaves or rubbery ones to boil the cabbage leaves.  My family has always taken rinsed, squeezed out sour kraut to lay over the prepared cabbage rolls.  Pour the tomato sauce mixture over all this and top with (uncooked) bacon slices.  No, this is not for the faint of heart fat free consumers, but for the people who want traditional cabbbage rolls (golumbki) that they and their kids will gobble up and ask for more! One more thing, this dish freezes well, so made in large quantities is nothing to fear.

THEY WERE AWESOME, I THINK THE BEST I EVER MADE. I FOLLOWED MOST OF THE REVIEWS, AND MADE MY OWN ADJUSTMENTS. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE ADDED 4 CLOVES OF GARLIC AND USED A COUPLE OF SHALLOTS INSTEAD OF THE ONION. THE SAUCE I MADE WAS 1 28 OZ CAN OF DICED TOMATOES AND 1 28 OZ CAN OF CRUSHED TOMATOES, WITH 3 TBSP OF BROWN SUGAR, 3 TBSP OF LEMON JUICE AND 1 TSP OF WORCESTERSHIRE. I COOKED SOME IN MY CROCK POT AND SOME IN THE OVEN. THE ONES FROM THE OVEN TURNED OUT THE BEST. THIS RECIPE IS A DEFINTE KEEPER.

These were great...just like I remember my Mom making.  I did double the sauce and baked them in a 9x13 casserole dish for 1 hour at 350 deg instead of using the crockpot.

This recipe is excellent, I looked at the reviews and other recipes and made a few alterations; my family loved them.  I quadrupled the sauce recipe.  And I used 1# of hamburger and 1# of spicey italian sausage.  I ended up with 2 casseroles (one for the freezer).  Also, I steamed one head of lettuce and it went to long and ended up a mushy mess.  I found a video on the internet with a different technique for the cabbage leaves and I'll never do it another way.  Get a very large pot of water and bring up to a small boil; as you're waiting for the water to boil core the cabbage head with a fairly wide margin at the top and take off the outer leaves that are dirty. Once the water is hot, place the cabbage head into the boiling water.  After about a minute or so, the outside leaves will start to separate from the head; approx every 45 seconds a leaf or two will separate.  As they separate remove them from the water into a pie tin or bowl.  This is fail proof and the leaves are the perfect softness to roll with ease.

I doubled the sauce also, and it was super. The batch I made produced more than 12 rolls (I guess European cabbages are smaller?) but it was still delicious. 
Something I'll try next time is chopping the remainder of the cabbage and placing that in the bottom of the pan, rolls atop it, to allow for people who really love their cabbage. The juices make everything taste fabulous.

i was shocked! being of ukranian descent and having married into polish heritage, i'd had 'piggies' as many times as i've had haluski but had no idea they were so simple! started them yesterday AM before we cleaned our basement and by the time we needed a break they were done! my husband LOVED them (and that's saying something) and my 3 y.o wolfed his down, eating even the cabbage! this one has earned its place in my recipe basket!

No problems at all with recipe.  Of course, I've made this type of recipe before and knew how to properly cut the cabbage leaves.  You need to trim the "spine" of the thickest center part, in order for it to cook, and to bend, when you roll them up.  They were so delicious!

Made these tonight from company and everyone like them.  I quadrupled the sauce too and I baked them covered with foil for 1 1/2 hrs at 325, then uncovered for 30 min at 300.  They turned out great!

Very easy reipe to adjust to be more authentic.  One, absolute must is to sub at least half of the ground beef for ground pork.  Two, if more liquid is needed, use beef stock rather than additional tomato sauce.  Three, prepare double tomato sauce for extra to be served on the side or with leftover (if there is any).  Four, prepare sour cream sauce (white sauce) for over the top when served: one part full fat sour cream, one part canned tomato sauce, one part sweet hungarian paprika.  Thin slightly with beef stock if necessary, add salt and preferrably white pepper to taste.  Sometimes I like to use smoked paprika in this sauce if I have it.  This white sauce really makes the recipe for me, and it doesn't have to be heated, just mix and serve in a gravy boat.  Also I don't use a crockpot (you want it dry enough after baking that it will hold its shape on its own-- then add more sauce on your plate) for this, I like to bake in a 350 degree oven in a 9x13 dish (as many rolls as will fit per dish, every head of cabbage is different, and since this recipe is so time-consuming I make alot when I make it) for 1 hour and a half.  Oh yeah, one other thing is I agree to reduce the brown sugar just slightly in this version (and get plain tomato sauce, not the seasoned variety otherwise it ends up tasting like spaghetti sauce).  Enjoy!  I hope this helps.

My boyfriend loved this recipe. It was WAY to much pepper for my taste...I reduced the amount to 1/4 instead of 1 1/4. Also, I quadrupled the sauce. Very good.

If you're making Polish cabbage rolls (galumki), 80/20 ground beef, white rice, s & p, add some sauce to the meat/rice mixture before rolling up and bake covered for at least 1-1/2 hours at 350.  The cabbage is cored and boiled (add a little cider vinegar to the water).  The sauce I use is 2 cans each of tomato soup and stewed tomatoes (chop them up) and bring to a boil, pour over rolls before baking.  The sauce is sweet, not savory.  Very good "piggies"!  Leftover (small) cabbage leaves can be chopped up and fried in butter, then add cooked noodles, S&P (haluski or halupki).

This is my favorite childhood dish from my grandparents farm. Our version is more savory (no lemon juice or brown sugar) but with the layering of sauerkraut and crushed tomatoes (grown on the farm and canned of course). Cabbage shortcut - microwave the entire head for 2-4 minutes depending on size. Let it cool a couple of minutes so you can handle it. The leaves just peel right off. Quick and easy.

MMM comfort food! I grew up in an Eastern European family and we had plenty of cabbage rolls over the years. My mom used to boil them in canned tomato soup and they were always bland and boring. Here is my variation on this recipe which is a great one, just needs a couple of additions. Use the slow cooker..boiling in a pot makes mushy rolls and baking them is good but you have to baste with sauce often..time consuming! I cut the core from my head of cabbage and boiled it for about 8 minutes. Put it in core side down first, then halfway thru cooking flip it over using a big spoon. That way when you dump it into the strainer it'll fall with the core side down and the water will drain out the bottom thru the core. I used half ground round and half ground pork, a cup of uncooked white jasmine rice, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 small onion, 1 egg, salt, pepper and lots of chopped fresh dill. Dill is the secret! I also used 1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 1 15 oz. can diced tomatoes and added the other ingredients listed (lemon, brown sugar, salt and pepper) and again, more chopped dill. Place half the sauce in the bottom of the slow cooker. When your cabbage is cool enough to work with peel the leaves off one at a time and put an oval meatball at the stem end. Fold the sides over and then roll the meatball burrito style. No need for string or toothpicks to secure, just put them in cooker seam side down. Cover with remainder of sauce and cook on High for 5 hours making sure ro

We loved this dish- with some modification.  I followed recommendations made by others and doubled the sauce, and added a little water.  I upped the seasonings quite a lot, and used 1/2 fresh polish sausage (homemade) and 1/2 lean ground beef.  I think this recipe would have been quite bland without those additional seasonings and changes.  Will make again.
Here's a tip by the way- don't bother to boil the cabbage.  Just put the cored cabbage in a pie plate, loosely cover it with plastic wrap and microwave it for 5-6 minutes.  It steams perfectly and cuts way down on time and hot boiling water.  The leaves just peel right off.  If the inner leaves are still too stiff, stick it back in the microwave for an additional 2 minutes or so.  Super easy.

For easy whole cabbage leaves..cut the root end off the head, then plunge the whole head of cabbage in a pot of boiling water. As the leaves soften- lift the head with a long handled fork and peel the individule leaves of one by one.

Perfect for the pressure cooker, I used this recipe in my pressure cooker, made the rolls and covered with sauce and 1 cup of water for extra liquid and pressure cooked over med heat for 15 mins. Tender perfectly done and easy. Loved it.

I used 4 lbs ground beef, 4 cups cooked brown rice, 2 large onions grated, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 4 tsps pepper, 4 tbsps minced garlic and 4 tbsps Worcestershire sauce for meat mixture. For the sauce I used tomato sauce, tomato paste, ketchup, V8 juice, brown sugar, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Needed 2 heads cabbage.

This is a good, reliable reference recipe, one you can put your own spin on and still feel confident about its basic structure.  That said, I added fresh garlic and parsley, and cooked the rice in beef broth.  I used a multi-purpose steak type seasoning in lieu of just salt and pepper. As for the sauce, I skipped the sugar and lemon juice and used my own tomato sauce put up from my garden, about three cups worth – plenty to spoon over the cabbage rolls as well as for the garlic horseradish mashed potatoes I served them with.  Rather than the slow cooker, I baked them in the oven, about an hour and 15 minutes, covered, at 350 degrees.   I had extra meat mixture which I just rolled into Porcupine Meatballs and baked alongside the cabbage rolls.  This was nothing fancy, just plain good old–fashioned comfort food, but do add some seasoning.

It was a good recipe to start with as a base, But I always tweak to my families tastes. I added a little more brown sugar to the sauce to cut the acidity and make it sweeter it because that is how I have always had it.I used brown rice and ground turkey and I also added a little extra tomato sauce to cover multiple dishes and I froze a couple of pans for later. They turned out really well.

A GREAT recipe for bachelors who drink while cooking.  This Polish / Ukrainian dish went well with a bottle of Riesling (didn’t the Germans conquer Eastern Europe?). I, also conquered, was very, very liberal with all ingredients. I quadrupled sauce, added diced tomatoes, added chopped carrots and bell pepper.  Lebanese friends suggested allspice, too.  What the heck, it’s almost Ramadan. Cabbage head was boiled 8 minutes, cored side down first 4 minutes, cored side up for the last 4, as per advice from another cook's comments, so as not to scald myself when dumping in strainer for draining.  Good idea.  But I should have boiled about 5 minutes longer.  I also baked at 350 for 1 hour rather than slow cook.  I didn’t eat until the next day, so it was really tasty, like everything that spends the night in the fridge.  Men, you can't screw this up unless you drink an entire bottle of Riesling and add way too much pepper, salt, lemon juice or Worcester sauce.  So take it easy.  Or you can screw it up if your woman cooked it and you offer up no compliments or refuse to eat it "cause it aint meat ‘n taters". Again, take it easy. Don’t be a total pig.  PS: my kids balked (nay, gagged) at the very description. And it looked even worse.  But tasted GREAT!  My advice: consider this an NC17 rated dinner.  But by all means, use this recipe as a skeleton and then go wild and crazy with your spices, sauces, wine and intuition.  Note: the total pig side of me is objecting to my last sentence

These rolls were great...I doubled the batch, and should have added just a touch more sugar, but it was easy to add it right before serving.  I can say that Ive made cabbage rolls before and the only thing that was a little 'off' in this recipie was that the cabbage itself was too soft for my liking.  I think the next time I make these, I shall bake them.  Good flavor...the whole fam. liked them.

I made this into a casserole. I steamed the chopped cabbage. I then put half of it into a casserole dish, topped it with the meat mixture, added the remaining cabbage. I topped it all off with double the amount of sauce mixed with 1/2 cup water. I baked it until it was all tender. Turned out great.

This recipe was excellent!! I did listen to other people's reviews and doubled the sauce recipe (and really I found that, that was the perfect amount).

I added some garlic cloves on top and threw the "scrap" pieces of cabbage on top (just to add even more moisture), and the cabbage rolls were absolutely perfect.  The worst thing you can do to a cabbage roll is make it dry and tasteless. These cabbage rolls were full of sooo much flavour and moisture, I would have to say I have honestly never had any as good as this.  Even my husband was impressed (and that takes a lot! lol) 5 stars all the way! I will definitely be making this again!

When making cabbage rolls mix all ingredients together in a large bowl, cover and put in fridge overnight to let all flavors mingle.
Instead of steaming or boiling cabbage a much easier way is to put cabbage in your freezer for two or three days thaw and use.

This is a wonderful recipe!  As someone suggested earlier, I added a package of onion soup mix to the hamburger.  It was wonderful!  Also (thanks to my grandmother), the cabbage leaves came off a lot easier once I steamed the head of cabbage in boiling water.  They peeled right off!  There was no need to boil them again afterwards.

I've made this several times, and it's always a hit. I double the sauce portion, as we like a lot of tomato sauce with our cabbage rolls. The recipe is easy, and I freeze the cabbage the day before, as the leaves will be wilted when thawed- no reason to have to boil the cabbage to soften the leaves. Thanks for a great recipe!

Although these were good they were way too sweet for my taste. I grew up eating more traditional cabbage rolls that were cooked in tomato juice but like to try different versions. I would make these again but not use so much brown sugar

i'm sure this is ok as far as cabbage rolls are concerned.  i did use the advice of using a28 oz can of diced tomatos and 28 oz can of tomato sauce for the rolls.  it was too much sauce as far as i was concerned.  Doubling or at the most tripling the sauce recipe is plenty.    Do add 1/8 t garlic powder.  these are bland enough, i cant imagine them without the garlic.  and the cabbage - i would recommend steaming the entire head of cabbage for your leaves.  made them  much easier to handle.  i just cant get past the texture of cooked cabbage, a bit slimey for my taste.  I even chopped the extra cabbage for the bottom of the pan to lay the rolls on.  I dont quite know how people got so many rolls out of this recipe unless you make them meatball sized. wow that would have been even MORE cabbage per roll  Not for me.  i made 6 serving sized rolls with this recipe.  they were a bit better the next day.  basically these are porcupine meatballs wrapped in cooked cabbage leaves smothered in tomato sauce.  ok but nothing spectacular.  they are what they are.  just not my thing i guess.

This was delicious, but there wasn't enough sauce.  Next time I'll try doubling it. Otherwise, great flavor! Thanks.  Edited - I made this again and used a 29oz can of tomato sauce and tripled the other sauce ingredients.  It was the perfect amount of sauce and the flavor was amazing.

I made these last night and they were a hit, even with the little one that doesnt care much for cabbage. I took the advice of some of the other commentators and added 1 tsp mustard powder & 1 tsp onion powder. (Could have used more as I doubled the recipe). I aslo doubled the sauce at first and added 1 can of petite cut tomatoes for the 1st 12, then I also added to the remaining sauce 1 can of rotel tomatoes,(for some spiciness) 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp worchestershire & 1 tbsp lemon juice for the 2nd 12. I also cored and steamed both heads of cabbage for easier handling and to save time. Both were absolutely delicious. Will definately make these a part of our dinner rotation!

These are great cabbage rolls.  I made twice-the 2nd time making because I wanted to use the base meat/sauce in Stuffed Bell Peppers too but give them that extra kick that was a little creamier! (Use Red, Green & Yellow peppers if you decide to do that) Use fresh minced garlic or garlic powder in your sauce.  Double, even triple your sauce and freeze leftover to use later for cabbage rolls or stuffed peppers!  Use Swanson' only low sodium chicken broth to cook your rice for more flavor (store brand broths & soups have too much soidum-check the labels).  Reduce the pepper to 1 teaspoon.  Buy a microwave steamer like Tupperware!  You can cut the spine out of the cabbage, sprinkle with some salt and steam in 5 minutes if you don't want to use freezer method (which is a great way) as an easy alternative if you're ready to cook right away!  You can omit the egg if you want, it will still bind.  For a variation you can also omit the milk and stir in a bit of cream cheese or sour cream and as it melts, it binds the mixture.  I used Campbell's tomato soup instead of tomato sauce as a variation.  All this adds for more calories but the end result in flavor is delicious.  As a certified chef that teaches creative cooking for the homemaker it's fun to see how you can make a fantastic recipe even better using your imagination & different ingredients.  Make a double batch of cabbage rolls and freeze 2nd batch since you are going to the trouble.

This is a family fav(we're polish). I make this even simplier by shreading the cabbage and making the meat into big meatballs.  I also use canned tomato soup in addition to the tomato sauce.

OFF THE HOOK GOOD! I only gave 4 stars because a bit of tweaking. I added garlic powder to the ground beef and onion mix. And I also almost quadrupled the recipe. I used 2 (15 oz. cans of sauce), 4 tbsp. brown sugar, 4 tbsp. lemon juice, 4 tbsp. Worcestershire. This was the exact flavor I remember from when my mother made it when I was a child. But she made it in the oven. I will be keeping this in my recipe box forever :)

I made these tonight for dinner and both my husband and I loved them.. I did make a couple changes..I cored the cabbage and then just boiled the whole thing for about 3 minutes..making it easier to pull apart.. I only like brown rice and my husband isnt a rice fan at all so I did not put any rice in it at all .. I doubled the sauce mixture... I added about 1/2 teasp of Garlic Powder to the beef mix, extra onion, a splash of Heinz 57, 1/2 teasp of minced garlic and a handful of the French Fried onions from the can.. to make up for not having the rice and for extra flavor..They were absolutely delicious..My husband had no idea that this was my first time making Cabbage Rolls.. Definetly a great recipe!

This sounds alot like my mothers recipe except the portions are totally different. I have made this many times and I always have lots of leftover sauce. So here is my sauce recipe and I hope it helps everyone who says theirs turned out slightly dry. i use 3 cans tomato sauce, 5 Tblsp. brown sugar, 5 Tblsp. lemon juice, 5 Tblsp. corn starch and 1 can of water (use tomato sauce can.) And we place our cabbage rolls in a cake pan, pour sauce over rolls, cover with aluminum and bake on 350 for about 2 hours. Hope this helps!

I've never made or eaten cabbage rolls, and I didn't have any time-honored family recipe to compare this to, so admittedly I am no expert here. But both my husband and I thought these were very good. Of course, I followed a lot of other reviewer's advice, and did a lot of alterations...I cored and boiled the whole cabbage before peeling the leaves, doubled the sauce, added to the meat 4 cloves crushed garlic, 1 tsp mustard powder, 1/2 pkg onion soup mix, and took the pepper down to 1/2 tsp. And I placed them in a 13x9 inch dish, poured the sauce over, and baked them at 350 for 1 hr. Not the most attractive dish, but nicely flavored in a comfort-food kind of way. I'll definetly repeat these.

very good!  took some of the other's suggestions and doubled the onions, doubled the sauce and added a pinch of garlic powder to the meat mixture.  Hubster ate almost the entire pot and my 2yr old had 2 :D  next time will add a layer of sour kraut and maybe even triple the sauce.  doubling or tripling the sauce is a MUST!!  UPDATE:  adding sauerkraut on top of the other additions I mentioned knocks these out of the park!  YUM  this is a recipe I can't wait to make again!!

This was pretty easy and very tasty; I'm a little iffy on the texture of cooked cabbage (in *any* recipe), but my husband really loved it. I used half ground beef and half ground pork and replaced the white rice with brown. I reduced the salt and pepper to 1 tsp each, doubled the onion, and added 1 tsp garlic powder to the meat. I increased the sauce by using 1 16oz can diced tomatoes, 1 16oz can tomato sauce and also quadrupled the Worcestshire sauce but only doubled the lemon and tripled the brown sugar. I mixed about half of the sauce into the meat mixture and topped the dish with sliced mushrooms before adding the rest of the sauce. I also cooked them in the oven instead of the crockpot (covered with foil, 1-1/2 hours at 350). It's a little more labor intensive than I would prefer, being lazy, but it makes a pretty large amount.

These were so good! I planned on having these for dinner tonight, and realized at the last minute that this was a 9 hour slow cooker meal. They came out delicious cooked on high for 3 hours. The only change I made was to use garlic salt instead of plain salt. Finally, something my picky son would eat! He even said he liked it, even the cabbage. The kid ate a vegetable! Definitely a keeper. (my son, too!)

I love cabbage rolls, and this recipe fit the bill.  Like others, I quadrupled the sauce,added 1/2 lb of italian sausage to the hamburger, and used minute rice.  Turned out great.  Ended up with 16 rolls, ate 4, and froze the rest with my new food saver.  I'm going ice fishing this weekend with a friend who loves cabbage rolls and told him I'd be bringing a little surprise.

You may have to be of  Russian heritage to love this.  I could never get tired of cabbage rolls.  If I'm lazy about it I just make the meat mixture, form it into balls and place on top of raw sliced cabbage in the crock pot,  pour sauce mixture over all (I add  2 oz of raisins )TY for sharing the recipe.

I, like others, opted to cook in oven versus the slow cooker of r1 hour at 350.  I did forget to cover pan with foil which made the cabbage rubbery (my mistake).  The recipe was good, but the meat mixture itself needed more spicing up (onion powder, garlic, ect...)  I also doubled the sauce as suggested, even with doubling, I probably would opt to triple next time.

A nice basic recipe for cabbage rolls. No need to pre cook the rice, and I grated the onion instead of chopping it. I used 2-28 oz. cans of tomato sauce and put dried bay leaf on top of the sauce before baking. I used a combination of ground beef and ground pork, and had some of the meat mixture left over and made them into tiny meatballs and added them to the casserole dish with the cabbage rolls. I also sprinkled the cabbage leaves with salt before putting the meat mixture on and rolling them up. When I cooked them in a pot on top of the stove I always had to use tooth picks to keep the rolls from falling apart, but with baking them, no need to do that.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! So does my husband and 3 and 4 year old boys. I follow the suggestions made by others and triple the sauce. A must! I make them all year around and just wrapped 3 dozen for New Years dinner with my family. As I have every year for the past 3 years. I always cook mine in the over at 350 for an hour or so. DELISH!

These are the best cabbage rolls I have ever made! I followed some of the other reviews and tripled the sauce. I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. Absolutely delicious!

My mother was of full German heritage and she used to make this dish. I like this recipe a lot and followed it pretty closely. I doubled it and it used about 2lbs of ground beef and maybe a little extra rice because it made 20 rolls, with meat mix left over, which I used to make little meatballs for Asian noodle soup with the cabbage broth cooked down. I added 4 cloves of garlic and a pinch of Italian herbs to the meat. Two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce more than covered the rolls and the recipe for the sauce was especially delicious.

FREEZE the cabbage, old polish trick. Let it thaw, absolute easiest way. Double the sauce or it will come out too dry. I used ground turkey. Also add a little horseradish to the mix if you like it. I married into a polish family.I impressed my in-laws with this recipe so much they bragged about it to my husbands grandparents, who are from Poland, and now I'm required to make it every Christmas!

The meat flavor was very good, I did what the other reviewers suggested, I doubled the tomato sauce, I put them in a crock pot for 8-9 hours, the cabbage seem like it was cooked away, next time I will try putting them in the oven and baking them instead, I also froze the cabbage like some one had suggested, was so much easier, the leaves was so easy to work with, I will always do that, thank you so much for that suggection.

This recipe was excellent! I used about 50% more rice and ground pork instead of beef. I also doubled the sauce and was glad I did or I wouldn't have had full coverage in the crock pot. As someone else recommended, I froze and then thawed the cabbage instead of boiling it. I had no problem rolling them. Great recipe!

One reviewer says to freeze the cabbage head to wilt it.  DO NOT do this.  You will end up with very tough and chewy leaves no matter how long you cook them.  Also if you do them in the oven put a layer of the outer leaves on the bottom to keep the rolls from turning dark or burning.  If you cut the spines off the leaves you can use these also for the bottom.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The sauce was burnt to a crisp all the way around the slow cooker liner, burnt on the top of the cabbage, and yet the rolls were raw in the centers.

This was excellent. It was quick and easy to make and tasted outstanding. My husband doesn't even like cabbage and he ate the left overs for lunch the next day. One hint: if you core the cabbage and stick the entire head on a fork and in boiling water, the leaves just peel off.

Helpful hints: I boil salted water in a large pot, core the cabbage and drop it in the boiling water. As the outside leaves soften I peel them off with tongs and set them aside to drain and cool. Then I sort them into stacks of small, medium and large leaves. I start with the large leaves and stuff and roll them, then stuff and roll the medium leaves and layer them on top of the larger rolls and if the small leaves are too small to stuff, just layer them on top of the rolls in the crock pot. I pour quite a bit of tomato JUICE (not V8) over the rolls to cover them, and if you like lemon you can squeeze lemon on top of that! Thanks for posting. Delicious!

Yum! I'm a HUGE fan of "piggies" so I knew I'd like these. My hubs isn't, but he's basing his opinion on a (distant) childhood memory. No surprise, my hubs wasn't a fan. :( And while I was, I wasn't a fan of the texture. There's just something about slow cooking ground beef that I don't like (I have the SAME problem with sc meatballs). I liked everything else about these, so next time, I'll change the cooking method (maybe on the stovetop) and hope for the best. NOTE #1: Everyone has a different opinion about what to do with their cabbage. Some freeze the entire head, then thaw it (the idea is that the leaves will soften as they thaw). Others suggest simmering whole and some remove the leaves FIRST, then simmer for a minute or so (until softened). I am a traditionalist at heart. I cut the bottom off my head of cabbage (just enough for it to lie flat) and simmered until the leaves fell off, one by one. I wanted to freeze mine, but I've heard this produces rubbery rolls. Furthermore, removing the leaves beforehand is nearly IMPOSSIBLE (they will rip before you are able to remove them!). NOTE #2: As Avon Lady suggests, be SURE to remove the thickest part of the "spine" of each cabbage leaf. Otherwise, they will not roll easily! Other than doubling the sauce (a MUST), adding a can of diced tomatoes and topping with a layer of (drained) sauerkraut, I made no major changes. Pierogies and steamed peas rounded out our meal. Thanks for sharing, BJ! :-)

OMG, it was so delicious, although I listened to others but quadrupling the sauce and I cooked it in the oven at 325 degrees for 1.5 hours and everyone LOVED them! I also used can tomatoes and I crushed the tomatoes with a fork and my hands.
Next time I am going to add more ingredients like garlic and more onions

Recently had a little Polish lady teach me her recipe. One of her secrets is to slip slivers of fresh garlic in between the rolls before cooking- she bakes these in a roasting pan, actually. Also, she uses slices of bacon in between the layers as well. Yummy!

I add about a tsp of garlic to the beef mixture; for the sauce, I increase the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, double the worcestershire and add a heaping tsp of red pepper flakes for a sweet sauce with a bit of a kick. I always cook these in the oven: 350 for an hour covered with foil, then remove the foil and continue for about 20-30 minutes....perfect every time

These are great but one suggestion for any meatloaf/ground beef - add one small grated potato to the meat mixture, it will ensure that the meat is never dry.

This was terrific! I tripled the sauce so I could place some in the pan before the rolls and add some to the filling. It ended up being the perfect amount! I prepared mine in a 9x13" pan and baked at 350 degrees for one hour.

I lived in an area of Canada for seven years, where no potluck was complete without cabbage rolls, but have never made them myself until now. This recipe sounded like it would taste right, and it did!  I made a couple of simple changes though. I steamed the cabbage head first which made peeling off the leaves easier. And after reading a few reviews I ramped up the flavor of the meat filling with a teaspoon of garlic powder and extra onion.  I also doubled the sauce.  I baked them in the oven for an hour covered (at 375) and another 10 min uncovered to let the sauce thicken.  My husband is not a cabbage fan and he went back for seconds!  I loved them!

I was so excited to come home to a wonderful meal that others had raved about.  This was a big dissapointment.  The rolls were very soggy and it just was not good at all.  I followed the repipe to a T (even doubling the sauce as per other reviews) I would not recommend anyone wasting their time on this.

These cabbage rolls were so fantastic! What made them best for me, after years of searching off & on for a great cabbage roll recipe, was that 1) the instruction to boil the leaves to make them easier to roll = excellent! and 2) the sauce. I tripled the sauce. Absolutely love the sauce. It was right on with the sweet and sour flavor. If you triple the sauce, you'll have enough for the cabbage rolls and noodles or rice on the side. It looks like a lot, but it gets eaten! The only thing I did different, was to bake the rolls at 350 for an hour, like other reviewers mentioned, and I added some garlic powder to the meat mix. Didn't hardly change this at all - IT DOESN'T NEED IT. Gorgeous, flavorful, heirloom recipe... omg, all I can say. Keeping this for a lifetime.

These were pretty good. I used brown rice instead of white and half ground turkey and half turkey sausage for the filling. I also added more onion, three cloves of garlic, a bit more worcestershire and doubled the sauce. I left off star because I think this would have been pretty bland without the changes I made and also I can't imagine  making this without doubling the sauce.

I would like to add that V-8 (low sodium also) works really well with this recipe AND the best part is, that it adds alot of extra veggies to the meal with great taste!  Your kids will never know if they are picky eaters!

Being of Polish descent, I watched Grandma make these for years. Add a small amount of tomato paste to the beef/rice mixture just enough to coat,also when layering tear apart canned tomatos pacing a section on each roll, and poring remaining liquid over rolls, keeps them very moist Makes great "Golumpki"

Wow!  This dish took me back to when I was growing up and my mom was still cooking for my family and me.  I thought it was fabulous.  As mentioned earlier, I made more of the sauce (actually quadrupled it) so that it would cover the rolls in the crock pot.  I also added Mrs. Dash (Table Blend) to the meat mixture to ensure that it would not be bland.  I think it came out perfect.  I think I will try to use ground turkey next time to make it even healthier.  Thank you!

Family loved this recipe.   Will definitely make for years to come.   Just microwave the cabbage and the leaves will peel easily.   Definitely double the sauce.

WAY more tasty than I even thought they would be!!  They sounded so good and so easy, so I went ahead and made them tonight,  even though I had something completely different in mind for my ground beef and Italian sausage.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the addition of a half pound of sausage to the mixture and doubled the sauce.  I also added some diced tomatoes and the rest of the cabbage, chopped up, to the sauce.  Would be delicious with or without the additions.  This recipe is a keeper, for sure!  Thank you for sharing.

I made these last night and they went ovr VERY well, thinking I'd have some for left-over lunch today.NOT!!!! I did make a few changes, I put the cabbage in ice cold water for 10 minutes so the leaves would pull off the head easily. I got this tip off another recipe. I also par boiled the leaves for 4 minutes, then drained and cooled them before stuffing. I also cut back on the sweetness of the sauce!!!! These are so good!! Had garlic cheese bread with them and that's what was for dinner last night!!!!!

YumYumYum!! This is my first review though I have used dozens of recipes over the years. After trying this I couldn't wait to share it's deliciousness !!! This came out terrific! As a first time cabbage roller, the steps were easy and quick! Used my electric skillet and it was still great! Definetly double the sauce because it is wonderful! Luckily I am the only one in my house to eat cabbage so I have leftovers for lunch! can't wait!

my father grows cabbage and its always VERY LG heads. Instead of parboiling the cabbage head, i fill the sink w warm salt water and let the head of cabbage for 2-3 hrs. I then core the head of cabbage and the leaves peel right off in whole pieces. I then make everything else stuff the leaves and bake everything. The cabbage rolls come out nice and tender and its delicious.

Very Good! I followed the recipe exactly except instead of rolling up cabbage leaves, which I'm not very good at) I layered the cabbage and beef mixture in slow cooker and poured sauce over all. I also left out the rice (personal preferance) & added cracker crumbs and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to beef mixture.  Next time I would increase sauce to 1 1/2 the amount. I also cooked it on auto for 5 hours as I didn't have 9 hrs. to wait.

J'ai bouilli le chou en entier pour faciliter la preparation. Cuit au four 1 heure, mais le chou etait encore coriace. Laisser cuire plus longtemps ou faire a la mijoteuse. J'ai triple la sauce tomate, worcesteshire et jus de citron, mais seulement double la cassonnade sinon ce sera trop sucre. Excellente recette. J'ai eu 14 cigares au chou.

I know that I'm personally not a fan of simple meat, tomato, rice flavor so I automatically added some extra seasoning. There's no way it would have gotten above 3 stars for me as written due to that but I wanted to try a recipe without egg due to allergies. For the sauce I used a can of Italian seasoned tomatoes and a large tomato, both pureed and cut back on the sugar to 1/2 tsp. I also used brown rice because I never buy white and added a little diced green pepper. I have never peeled cabbage leaves before but they came off with little difficulty after coring. I only filled 8 leaves and they weren't overstuffed. Two left me full with no side dish for dinner. Cooked on hi for 4 hrs and low for 1-1.5 hrs and even the ribs were tender. With those simple changes I will make this again, thanks.

A wonderful base recipe, but i did give 4 stars just because i made some changes. First I doubled the ground beef, used 1 tsp each salt and pepper. I omitted the milk, and used 1/4 cup sauce instead.   I also tripled the sauce, using 2 cans tomato sauce and 1 can pasta sauce, added some chopped garlic and fresh roma tomatoes but only used 1 tb brown sugar.I found that to be just right, not too sweet.   Definitely use leftover cabbage to cover the rolls so they don't dry out. I pour 2/3 of sauce over rolls then remaining sauce over the layer of cabbage. I then cooked them in my oven at 325 for about 2 hours. The time would depend on how big you make your cabbage rolls.   They were so delicious- specialty stores/restaurant that sell cabbage rolls don't even compare.

Three words...too much pepper. I used the calculate button next to area that says how many the recipe serves, and changed it from 6 to 10 servings. So, I assume that even at 6 servings the amount of pepper called for was too much. I used twice the amount of tomato sauce (putting 8oz. IN the meat mixture)so it would be more moist. Aside from that, this was soooo good. Cooked it on high in the crock for 4 hrs. Then left it on warm til we were ready to eat, about an hour later. Next time I make this I'll probably cut the amount of pepper called for in half.

Having made many different cabbage roll recipes, this one was not a fave for me. It was the sauce. I am not sure which ingredient didn't taste right for me. Regardless, the recipe should call for the sauce to be mixed in with the beef mixture instead of just being poured on top, to avoid dryness. I always mix my beef with the sauce to roll, then pour the remainder of the beef mixture and sauce on top of all.

I chose to make these for St. Patricks day.  I wouldn't say my family loved them, but they ate them without complaint.  My 12 yr old said "it's just meatloaf wrapped in cabbage, big deal", but I enjoyed them very much.  I followed the recipe closely except I baked mine in the oven (350 for an hour) and I added a little of the sauce to the meat mixture, but then of course I was short on sauce - so I just poured a can of Tomato soup over the top.  Next time I'd add some of the tomato soup to the meat and mix the remaining with the sauce (or just double the sauce).  Also, if baking in the oven like I did, cover to keep them from drying out.

Make this with some tweaks from other reviewers.  I froze the cabbage 2-3 days then defrosted & had no problem separating the leaves.  I also added &/or changed 1 large onion, chopped, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 3/4 teaspoon pepper & tripled the sauce.  I also baked these covered for just over an hour.  Very tasty!

Just like my grandmother used to make for us at Christmas every year!! A true recipe that reminds me of home, and one I certainly never get tired of. I left out the brown sugar because I don't like my cabbage rolls sweet, but these still ended up tasting really yummy, especially served with some homemade bread :)

This is pretty much a standard cabbage roll recipe and very good; however, I used petite diced tomates (24 oz. can plus added water) rather than tomato sauce as I'm not fond of the tomato sauce taste.  I also mixed sausage doubling the recipe (I've also used ground venison to fix c rolls but not this time), also added garlic salt as we love garlic in this house.  Cooked in 1/2 the time on high in my large slow cooker.

Awesome really, really good, even my picky kids ate this one. I cooked it in the oven at 300 for 2 1/2 hours because I did not have time to put it in the slow cooker and it still turned out great!

My husband loved this.  I think I used too many outer cabbage leaves and some of my rolls had a real "wang" to them.  Be sure to use the tender inside leaves even though they are smaller! I agree, double the sauce. Overall, a keeper.

This was delicious! I added few drops of tabasco and a little of cumin to the tomato sauce. Also added pressed garlic, ground parmesan and thyme to the meat mixture. Used ground chicken. Definitely will make again soon.    Thanks!

Based on the comments, this recipe has been circulating for over 10 years!  A lot of people have used this recipe and it is consistently a winner.  I will continue to follow a few suggestions (increase sauce amount and freeze cabbage head).  I am also going to try using ground lamb, feta cheese and a bit of curry powder (3 flavors that I love) on my next go around.

I usually don't rate a recipe unless I make it exactly as written but in this case I made an exception. I made 2 very minor changes. First, I drained a small bag of sauerkraut and put that on the bottom of the crockpot. Instead of using lemon juice in the sauce I used the drained sauerkraut juice. I did double sauce recipe. I cooked on low for 9 hours. Outstanding!  Just like mom used to make!

This was my first time ever making cabbage rolls.  I used this as a base recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used half ground venison, half ground beef.  I added extra onions, 4 chopped cloves of garlic, and ground thyme to the meat.  I had to exempt the egg because I did not realize I was out until I went to add it to the mix.  Worked fine without the egg.  I used half tomato sauce, half marinara sauce and tripled the sauce.   Next time, I will make more rice to have as a side.  I will also put a thick layer of chopped cabbage leaves down before laying the rolls down.  I boiled the cabbage head and took off the leafs one at a time.  I also made my rolls a little thick.  Next time I will use half the meat in them so I get more cabbage to meat.  Great base recipe.  I also cooked this in the oven.  350 for 1.5 hrs tightly covered.

This recipe is a keeper! Even my daughter who doesn't like cabbage admitted that these were good! I used the method of boiling the entire head of cabbage and pulling the leaves off as they became tender. That worked pretty well for me. Can't wait to make these again!

These were good. I did double the sauce and added garlic. I also double the recipe because I had a couple of cabbages from my garden I needed to use up. I also gave some to my neighbor who him and his son loved them.

This came out flavorless in the slow cooker, although the sauce was pretty good prior to cooking it.  This recipe is probably salvageable if not made in a crock pot.

5 + stars: the other reviews were very helpful.  I tried both frozen and steamed cabbage; i preferred steam.  I also tripled of sauce - combined with diced tomatoes and baked it for an hour instead of using the slow cooker. Delicious......  Will try it again.

This is the best cabbage roll recipe ever!  Even my mom asked ME how I made it.  :-)  I did change a few things to fit my diet and needs.  I omitted the rice.  I also used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage.  I also added a can of stewed tomatoes on top for extra juice. YUMMY, and fairly low-carb this way.

This was the first time we made cabbage rolls and they're were very yummy!!  We will be doing these again!  

One thing though, you need to double up the sauce portion.  We found that some of the cabbage was not covered and dried out.  And make sure you line the bottom and the side of the slow cooker with the left over cabbage so the bottom doesn't dry out.

I cut the bottom off of the cabbage and placed the whole head in boiling, salted water for about 10 min.  This made it easier to remove each leaf.  I chose not to use the crockpot and, instead, placed the 12 cabbage rolls in a 9x13 baking pan.  After pouring the sauce over all of the rolls, I left it uncovered and baked it for an hour and a half at 350.  They turned out very pretty and very tasty.  Cooking in a crockpot would probably make the cabbage leaves more tender, but either way, this is a keeper.

Excellent! Even my 7 year old ate them and loved them. Next time I will cut down or omit the brown sugar in the sauce. It was a bit sweet for me!

These are really, really good! I doubled the recipe, using 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground pork, and tripled the tomato sauce. Delicious! Will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe :)

Have finally mastered making cabbage rolls that are tender.  I added about 1/4 tsp. garlic powder to the meat.  Doubling the sauce is a good idea as suggested by others.  Easy to make in a slow cooker.  Won't bother looking further for a better recipe.  This is it!

Really good!  I was a little lazy, so instead of wrapping cabbage rolls, I layered the steamed (for 15 minutes) pieces of cabbage and the meat mixture.  I put a thin layer of jarred tomato sauce on the bottom of the cass. dish first, then put a layer of cabbage on this, put the raw meat mixture (followed the recipe--but added some thyme) on top, and a layer of more steamed cabbage on top.  (UPDATE --PLEASE NOTE: I mixed the lemon juice, worchestershire sauce, brown sugar, rice, onion, salt, pepper, thyme, egg and milk in with the meat mixture.  I also added another tbsp. of worchestershire sauce to the mix the second time I made this--SO GOOD!).  After assembling the layers, I then put some more jarred tomato sauce on top and some "Italian Accents" whole tomotoes on top.  Baked at 375 for 1 hour, 30 minutes.  In last 15 minutes, I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top to melt.

Instead of cooking the cabbage rolls as instructed,  I threw all the ingredients from the filler and the sauce into the crockpot on low and I added some chicken stock as well.  This is because I used uncooked rice.  When I got home from work, I boiled the cabbage and rolled them right before serving.

These turned out good.  I served them with "Mike's mushroom bread" and "Tomato and Avocado Salad" (both from this site).

Excellent. My husband loved these. The only changes I made were to add garlic/onion powders, omit the fresh onion, and I also doubled the sauce. I would probably at least triple the sauce next time because some of my rolls did get a little scorched on the sides. Thanks :)

Yay, now I have a fabulous recipe for the slow cooker. Was skeptical about cooking them so long but the timing was right on. Shared them with my neighbor and she loved them too.

These were great. Followed ingredients exactly except I reduced pepper to 3/4 tsp & added 1/2 tsp garlic powder & tripled onion to 3/4 c. I only had 9 good (untorn) cabbage leaves, so I put 1/3c meat mixture in each and that worked! Increased cooking time in 350 oven to about 1 hr 15 min to be sure larger rolls would be done. DEFINATELY DOUBLE THE SAUCE-- A MUST!!!! I'll definately make these again!
Update 8 YEARS LATER!: I still make this frequently,  have found it to be forgiving,  can swap white or brown rice, add fresh garlic to meat or sauce mixture...double the sauce from original recipe and you can't go wrong. Enjoy!!

good basic recipe, but what my mom always did so not to waste, was shred remaining lettuce , about 2 c. and add it to the sauce. I used 1 28 oz can sauce and 1 28 oz can of plum tomatoes w/ juice (make sure to cut up the tomatoes.) You can also sprinkle 1/2 cup of rice in the sauce. When all is cooked through, every bit of this dish is finished. Don't be afraid to spice up the sauce also. I include garlic in almost everything!

This recipe is great.  I also doubled the sauce.  However I do not use cooked rice.  I put in a handrful of raw rice and it cooks in the meat and juice.  Much easier and done perfectly.

This is the BEST cabbage roll recipe I have ever made.  I followed the ingredients, extactly. I also used the cool trick, that NANCYSELL123 suggested.  It really does work.  The secret to this great recipe is the sauce.  I didn't cook in the slow cooker, instead I bake it at 350 for an 1hr and 1/2 with foil.

I couldn't find extra lean beef at my local store, so I ended up using Jennie-O lean turkey. I added minced garlic, and next time will add more seasonings to the mix because it needed a touch more, but still good!
***Update: Do not listen to the review about freezing the head of cabbage! The first time I made this, I just quickly cooked the leaves in a small amount of boiling water, and it worked just fine, but this time I decided to try the freezing thing. It's a bust. Do you know how long it takes a head of cabbage to thaw? The first couple leaves were fine, but the rest wouldn't peel off without breaking, so I had to steam the whole head anyway, and STILL left leaves toward the middle that were still partially frozen, and wouldn't peel off properly. I ended up having to toss some of the mixture out because I couldn't get enough useful leaves out of the head of cabbage. Just steam them from the beginning. Freezing is definitely not worth it.

Freezing the cabbage was a GENIUS idea!  HIGHLY recommend doing that!  The recipe itself was great.  Next time I will make more of the sauce mixture and add it to the inside of the rolls with the meat as well as add some garlic.

This was good!  And I don't like cooked cabbage!  Only changes I made, after reading the reviews, was I added 3 Tbsp tomato paste to the meat mixture and tripled the sauce.  Oh, and I added a drained can of Sauerkraut in the bottom of the crockpot.  My hubby loved it!

I don't have an oven so I steamed mine. They took about 25-30 minutes for the cabbage to steam through. I chose not to make the sauce as I was steaming them. Then I realized it would have been nice to have it so I'll make it next time. I used half ground beef and half ground pork. The flavor was great. Very moist.

Loved this recipe.. reminds me of my grandsma's recipe.  I also quadruppled the sauce and added more onion that I grated to the meat.  I cooked on high in the crock pot for 8 hours.

Great recipe- the only changes i made were coring and boiling my cabbage first as well as adding a couple pieces of bacon (diced) to my ground beef while frying.  I also used a 28oz can of stewed tomatoes that i blended with my hand mixer. The sauce was plentiful and tasty. I cooked mine covered in the oven at 350 for an hour.  I've always thought these would be too difficult to make myself- NOT ANYMORE!

Absolutely fantastic! Just like at the german restaurant. Wonderful taste - I made them in the oven because i didn't have time to use the crockpot. Boiled teh cabbage leaves then wrapped the raw meat mix up, covered it with extra cabbage leaves and threw the tomato mix on top. Baked at 375 for 45 minutes. Husband loved it too :)

I steamed the cabbage in my electric steamer, best way ever to remove cabbage leaves, it keeps them intact and preserves nutrients. I added fresh minced garlic and more worcestershire. I use low/no sodium tomato sauce and leave out the salt (dietary restriction) . Next time will use 1/2 sausage to give it more flavor, will also use less rice. 1 1/2 T - 2 1/2 T. meat added to each cabbage piece depending on the size of the leaf. Overall, delicious, easy to make.

YUMMY!!!  This turned out much better than I thought.  I boiled the whole head of cabbage for about 5 minutes.  I took it out and cut the stem off so the leaves just fell off the head.  I trippled the sauce and it made plenty, enough to have on my mashed potatoes.  My 7 and 11 year old even ate this one.  I will for sure make this again. thanks BJ for a great recipe!

These were excellent! I cooked them different. i baked them in the oven because I didnt read the whole recipe that you had to slow cook them. so after i assembled them it was to late to throw them in the crockpot. i will make these again and slow cook them next time. aside from baking them i didnt change a thing.

This was very delicious. I did changes though. I wanted to make it faster and easier, so I omited the egg, milk ect. that was added to the ground beef. I cooked the beef with onion and 1 chopped garlic clove and garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste. I boiled the cabbage as suggested and doubled the sauce. I felt like the sauce needed a little something, so I added garlic powder and pamesan cheese. I covered with foil and baked for 30 min on 350. Delicious :) Thanks BJ.

These were the best cabbage rolls that we ever ate! After 30 yrs of marriage, my husband said that he never knew I could cook like this. Wow. Thank you!! I used half hot sausage, half lean ground beef, and followed the reviewer's suggestions for baking. For sauce, I used 1 can of V8 with the brown sugar & lemon juice as review suggested. Yum, what a keeper!

So good!! I only changed a couple of things, I used Lawry's seasoning salt in place of sal and pepper and added one and 1/2 minced cloves of garlic to the meat mixture and 1/2 clove minced to the sauce mixture.  Plus I doubled the tomato mixture and added about 1/2 cup of beef broth to the tomato sauce mixture. These were fabulous, the only draw back is my house smelled like cabbage all day! but they were soooooo tasty!!

This was awful. I like all the ingredients so it's not like I don't like cabbage or don't like Worcestershire Sauce. It just tasted bad.  As I was eating this I thought, this tastes like what I imagine people in war torn eastern Europe would eat on Christmas.  Huddled around a fire, exposed to the elements on a dreary day, shells exploding in the distance and a bowl of cabbagy beef gruel in your lap.

This was a big hit in my house. I doubled the sauce. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I substituted a bit of molasses and soy sauce. I also used brown rice instead of white rice. 
I had a hard time coming up with a side dish for this, but with a little research of online restaurant menus I settled on mashed potatoes. It was a good match. 
This recipe will definitely go into our rotation. Thanks for sharing.

These were awesome after a little tweaking. My very picky, cabbage-hating friend even loved them! I browned the beef with 4 cloves of garlic before mixing it with the rice etc. I took others advice and added garlic powder, mustard powder, minced onion and a few spoonfuls of the tomato sauce topping. I also substituted 2 shallots for the 1/4 cup minced onion. I only got 8 or 9 leaves from a head of cabbage (I'm new at this and they kept tearing!)but it worked out beautifully, just the right amount of filling. I doubled the sauce, which is a must. My husband said he preferred less cooked cabbage, but that's fairly impossible in a slow cooker. Everyone really enjoyed them, and I'll be making them again soon.

These were awesome!  The kitchen smelled sooo good while these were cooking.  I used to make these years ago, but never could get the sauce quite right.  This was perfect!  I dbld the meat mixture and will use it to stuff green peppers, bake and freeze for a night that I don't have time to cook.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not sure where some folks went wrong on this recipe, but it turned out just fine for me. I cooked the onion w/the ground beef and added minced garlic. I would recommend decreasing the amount of pepper and doubling the sauce. The next time I make this I think I will make some extra sauce to spoon over the rolls when reheating. It really is delicious. Thanks for sharing!
UPDATE: I have made this a couple of more times and decided do make a deconstructed cabbage roll to save time stuffing and rolling. Boiled roughly chopped cabbage separate and put everything together like stir fry/goulash including the sauce. Made extra sauce on the side to drizzle over the goulash and served with warm buttery corn muffins. This has become our New Year’s Day meal that we all look forward to.

What a great recipe ! I was looking for something quick to fix tonight when I stumbled upon this crock pot recipe.
So, since I didn't have 9 hours to wait,
I put it in the oven instead. I had read some of the earlier reviews and decided
to use a little more tomato sauce
and it came out just right.
This recipe is definately a keeper
and so easy.

They cook up beautifully, they're pretty easy to prepare (time consuming though), but I have had better cabbage rolls.  I tried doubling the sauce as many suggested.  An absolute.  We had just enough after doubling.  Couldn't imagine how little would have been there without.  I found however the pepper flavour was to much, and the lemon a little strong.  But they cook BEAUTIFULLY again I say.  I am going to keep the recipe, and tweak it, probably add garlic, reduce lemon juice, things like that.  It's a good place to start till you get what you want.  They are good, but not what I was looking for exactly.  But I liked using the crock pot.  :)

Great recipe...BUT IF YOU WANT IT EVEN TASTING BETTER THIS IS WHAT I DID: One small box of DIRTY RICE. This is a rice that is already spiced with great flavors. ALSO I add some BROWNING AND SEASONING sauce to the tomatoe soup mixture. ITS SUPER!!!

This was terrible.  I was really looking forward to these all day (for the directions had me cook them for 8-9 hours which turned out to be way too long).  The cabbage was soggy, the meat mixture dry, and there was not enough sauce.  My husband and I threw these out and got Chinese.  Sorry, to be so negative, but I hate the thought of others wasting thier time on this recipe.

This recipe has become a staple at our house.  It takes a little bit of prep time, but the outcome is very impressive and gratifying.  The leftovers are great too!  It's very important to use EXTRA LEAN ground beef, since the fat stays in the dish instead of being drained off.

These are little individual meatloafs wrapped in cabbage! Anyone who likes cabbage and likes meatloaf will enjoy this recipe. I did add herbs and garlic to the meat mixture for extra flavor. I also took the advice of a reviewer and steamed the cabbage ahead of time, which had to be done repeatedly (every few layers) but I can't imagine how to peel off the leaves without tearing them if it's not steamed first. Aside from that part, the rest goes really fast.

This recipe is great but I quadrupled the sauce part as other review suggested. It was amazing. I have made it half a dozen times already. I am the only one that eats it. It lasts me all week. I eat this by itself and it is very satisfying.

I made these this past weekend and thought they were great. I made a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand.  First, I used a rice mix of brown, long grain and wild rice instead of white.  Also, I had some shallots to use up and added 1/4 to 1/3 cup of those plus two cloves of finely chopped garlic to the beef. Taking the recommendation of others, I also doubled the sauce but added about a teaspoon of steak sauce to it for a little extra zing.  These were very good! I will definitely make them again.

Great idea. I did these in the crockpot and it worked out great.  I did put the cabbage in the freezer as suggested by another reviewer and avoided boiling the cabbage.  IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM.  THANK YOU FOR THAT SUPER TIP!!! I will never boil cabbage again for cabbage rolls.  I also reduced the pepper to 3/4 tsp as suggested by another reviewer.  I kept this sauce as is but my Mom would use tomato soup and I like it better but kept this one as some people may like a tangier version.  If cooking in oven, I would double the sauce, if using the crockpot the crockpot generates enough water so I found the measurements listed from BJ sufficient.  I used 93% hamburger. I am updating this post as I tried this recipe in the oven and will never do that again!  One hour is NOT enough cooking time.  I could not serve them and ended up throwing them in the crockpot the next day.  I won't use the oven method again.  This is a keeper the crock pot way!

Delicious! My husband went back for seconds, which is always a great sign! I precooked the beef, onions mixture and added garlic (3 cloves) and a green pepper and skipped the milk and egg. I also doubled the sauce and cooked in my oven at 350 for 1.5 hours.

The filling was sorely lacking in flavor/seasoning.  I'm thinking it could use a good amount of garlic, more onion, and perhaps even more salt....and something else, not sure what yet. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I too cooked the cabbage first so it was easier to roll. I sautéed up onion and garlic and added it to my meat mix along with some Italian sausage. Added some spices and upped the flavor. Crock pot the first time, came out good, trying it in the oven this time bc I don't want to wait till tomorrow to have it. Thanks for sharing!

My family said 'these are your best yet!'.
I made some changes due to the fact I usually cook with a lot if spices/seasonings.
For the sauce I used  28oz of diced tomatoes & 1 can of tomato soup. Added extra brown sugar & worsestershire. Added 6 bay leaves .
The meat: I added some of the tomato sauce, extra onion, 4 garlic cloves & 1/4 teaspoon of allspice (I will use 1/2 tsp next time). 
So good!!

It was too late in the day to cook these in the slow cooker, so I baked them at 350 degrees for about 1 hour.  The filling I made exactly as written, but slightly modified the sauce.  I substituted El Pato Salsa de Jalapeno tomato sauce to give it a little kick, and added some freshly-chopped ripe tomatoes which needed to be used up.  I’ve made a number of stuffed cabbage roll recipes and although OK, always thought they were a little bland.  That Mexican-style tomato sauce really made these incredibly tasty, my husband said he’d give them a “10.”  This will now be my go-to recipe.

Amazing! I loooved it. The leftovers reheated seemed even better day 2.. I will definately make this again. I think it would even be great to prepare and freeze for future quick meals. Crock pot worked great, no burning, everything was cooked evenly. Amazing meal!

I have made this a few times, but have baked it in the oven and doubled the sauce, because we like more sauce. The first time I made it, I did what some have said and put the cabbage in the freezer, big mistake, the cabbage was tough and was terrible. Since then I have boiled it, which came out great.

This recipe is just okay if you follow it to the T, which was what I did. I felt like it needed more seasoning. So, if I make this again, I will definitely tweak it to my liking.

Made this for the whole fam last night. Followed recipe except for a couple of tweaks.  Used ground venison since that is what we had and took other's advice to cut back on black pepper, but added 1 small can Rotel's new sauce to sauce recipe. Baked in the oven and turned out delish! Will definitely make again!

This is a well known recipe in South Africa, where it is known as "grandmother in a blanket." I often make it for my family. Often I would leave out the rice, and pour beef stock over before baking it in the oven or slow cooker.

I made these, however, I chose to eliminate the sugar, lemon juice,and Worcestershire sauce. I  added extra tomato sauce, about a 1/4  cup, combining it with the meat mixture.  I cooked my in a large pot on the stove top about 1 1/2 hours on med heat, slow boil. If I have extra cabbage leaves, I shred them and add  them with the rolls. They freeze well, too, that is, if you have any left!

These came out so yummy, but I did follow the other reviewers advice and tweaked the recipe. Doubled the sauce, added extra garlic and onion. I also put paprika, parsley and cumin in the meat mixture. I did not pre-cook the rice (but did pre-boil the cabbage).

Another thing I decided to do was add cubed red potatoes to the bottom of my slow cooker, before adding the cabbage rolls. I pull a little sauce over the potatoes and then start to fill the slow cooker with the rolls. Topped it off with the remaining sauce. I used Classico Tomato Basil sauce with the Worcestershire sauce and Lemon Juice mixed in. I omitted the brown sugar from the recipe.

I have a newer 7 quart Crockpot and cooked on High for 4 hours and Low for 2 hours. Served it with Egg Noodles.

SO DELICIOUS! Definitely making these again!

Amazing!  I've never had a cabbage roll before so I have nothing to compare to but this recipe is awesome!  Defintitely double the sauce.  I also followed the suggestions of other reviewers such as boiling cabbage, adding more onion, garlic powder and some seasoned salt. I baked at 350 for hour.  My family of picky eaters devoured these and can't wait for me to make them again!

I have a Large (I think its a 6 quart) slow cooker.  I doubled the recipe, quadrupled the sauce, and CHOPPED the cabbage.  I formed the meat mixture into balls (using a bag of frozen, steamable microwave white rice). Then used a half head of chopped cabbage spread on top and then poured the sauce on the top of that.  I cooked it on HIGH for 5 hours.  It came out really yummy.  Good comfort food for a cold day.

This was pretty good! We're usually not huge fans of cabbage but I will definitely make this again. I followed other reviewers' advice and 1) Steamed the cabbage head so I could remove the leaves easily 2) tripled the sauce 3) shredded some of the remaining cabbage in the sauce 4) used the oven instead of crock pot (1.5h covered and 0.5h uncovered). This makes just enough for 3 adults (4 rolls each).

Very good. I added a can of rinsed black beans to the mixture for a hit of lean protein and fiber. Also, I should have bought a bigger cabbage, because by time I had used up all the filling i was working with the teeny weeny inside leaves which was not ideal.

These were good but I felt they were lacking something. We thought the meat mixture could have used a little more flavor, maybe some garlic, and we weren't a big fan of this red sauce at all. Next time I'll use a whole different sauce recipe.

I messed this recipe up and it turned out awesome. I added brown sugar and worcestershire to hamburger and a little sauce when I realized what I did but turned out great. Used ragu instead of tomatoe sauce though. Crock pot for 6 hrs. And to previous raters... Awesome idea to microwave head of cabbage.. works wonderfully. Thanx.

I made these cabbage rolls using the recipe without changing anything.  I also made these the other night using the recipes as a base, and adding shredded carrots. Italian Sausage rather than beef. 1/2 cup minced onion. 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, and a 28oz can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano.  Added Louisiana Hot Sauce to the tomato mix.  Cooked for about 1 hr in the oven at 350 degrees.   Both recipes got remarkable comments.  Everyone loved it and requested it be a regular around the house and office.

These are the BEST cabbage rolls I've ever had!!  Only changes were the salt and pepper - just sprinkled some on meat mixture to taste - and used 1/2 680 ml no name tin of tomato sauce (just over 8 oz.) for 1 recipe of sauce .  The amount of meat mixture in this recipe are bang on for a large head of cabbage.  I make two separate batches of meat mixture, use two large heads of cabbage.  Pile up 1 recipe cabbage rolls in large slow cooker and cover with 1 sauce recipe then pile the 2nd recipe rolls over sauce and cover with another sauce recipe.  Cook in slow cooker for 8 hrs on low.  They turn out absolutely perfect.  Freeze for a couple weeks for flavors to meld.

Absolutely delicious!  I cooked my rice with fresh herbs, and I added a handful of yellow raisins to the sauce, as suggested by a friend.  Separating the leaves of the cabbage was a bear, and I'm so glad I did that and parboiled the cabbage the night before.  The rest of it was easy, and everyone just loved it!

These were fantastic!  I doubled the sauce recipe, like prior reviewers, and also added a little garlic powder and seasoning salt because the sauce as stated is just a little too sweet for me.  We had no leftovers.

Not only was this the first time making stuffed cabbage, it was my first time eating it as well. It was a hit! I made it as directed except I did have to double the sauce. I don't know how it would work if you didn't double it. Seemed like it covered everything perfectly doubled. I baked mine at 375 for about 45 min.

Labor intensive and marginal taste so only 3 stars.  It definitely needs more seasoning.  Way too bland for my family.

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except I quadrupled the sauce (28 oz) using diced tomatoes. I also baked for 1.5 hours at 350 F.  These are the best cabbage rolls I've ever had!  Even the kids enjoyed them!

I added garlic and doubled the sauce as others suggested. I popped it in the oven at 350 for about 50 minutes, covered with foil Next time, I might put a teeny bit of sauce inside with the meat mixture. Otherwise, delicious!

It was hard to get past how completely unappetizing these looked!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY..made no substitutions or adjustments.  As for taste..they were really bland and the texture was very unappetizing.  I checked out the photos others took of their rolls, and they look the same.  This recipe needs lots of help..I can't figure out what everyone else is tasting???!!

I guess I am a little bias, there is a restraunt here in Minneapolis that is famous for its cabbage rolls and I am on a quest to find a recipe like they have...these were good but kind of bland to my palate.

I followed the recipe exactly, so they turned out how they were supposed to, but they were just so bland! Not much flavor, super boring, and only one mushy texture.

Yummo! I tweaked it a little. Used beef flavor rice a roni, mixed that with my cooked ground beef. Rolled them up and put sweet & sour sauce down the centers of the rolls and baked. Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

So great!  Our first time making these, and they turned out wonderful.  The recipe makes no mention of how to separate the cabbage, but lesson learned: core the cabbage, put it core-side down in boiling water, and continue to turn it to cook evenly as the leaves fall off. Pull the leaves out of the water, and dry them off.  :)  They froze really well-- we just put them into Ziploc baggies and they make a great meal.  They still take about an hour from frozen, maybe an extra fifteen minutes or crank the temp up by 25 degrees.  If there's leftover cabbage, shred it and put it in the bottom of the dish to cook in the sauce.  So great! :)

These were pretty good, but I think I would change some things if I make these again.  I've never had cabbage rolls before this, so I don't have anything to compare them to, but I would add more onion, more rice, and some garlic powder.  I would also double the sauce.  I might also add some Worcestershire sauce to the meat.  I baked these covered at 350 for an hour because I don't have a slow cooker and they turned out fine.

very good, but follow suggestions to double or triple sauce recipie. I used 1 lb bround beef and 1/2 lb hot italian sausage. Also added 4 cloves crushed garlic, onion powder, oregano, basil, parsley to the meat mixture and to the sauce I added 1bout 1/2 to 3/4 can of tomato soup to extend the sauce a bit. Family loved it - cant wait for the leftovers!

Like previous reviewers, I made a lot of changes to this recipe.  I added 3 minced garlic cloves, mustard powder, and about 1/4 can of tomato soup to the meat.  I tweaked the sauce, too.  My sauce consisted of 4 cans of tomato soup, 2 cups water, 4 tbsp brown sugar, 5 tbsp lemon juice, 5 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, and lots of cracked pepper.  The sauce ended up sweet, tangy, and was just thick enough to coat the cabbage rolls perfectly.  My boyfriend raved about how good it was...the altered recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is very good...however there are a few things I did to tweak it and make it even more amazing!!  First you NEED to double the sauce..also I added a large can of diced tomatoes.  I then added much more brown sugar just because I like it sweeter.  When mixing the ground beef mixture I added in addition- minced garlic, italian seasoning and a mixture of mozzerella and parm. cheese.  I then cooked in oven at 400 for an hour covered.

These are very tasty - do need the extra sauce- I also would add that if the rice is cooked, these can be baked in a 350 degree oven for an hour - for a quick meal!

This was my first attempt at making cabbage rolls. As it is, I give this recipe four stars. After reading some tips and a couple tweaks of my own it is a five star favorite that I will make again. I cut the pepper in half and doubled the onion and sauce like everyone sugested. I also added a nice handfull of sausage (1/3 - 1/2 lb.) 1/2 C of coarsly sliced mushrooms, 1/2 C of sliced zuchinni and 1/8 tsp. garlic powder. Wow, these things were the bomb and I wished I had more when they were gone! I will try puting the excess cabbage at the bottom of the dish next time. I had some left over meat mixture that I added a beaten egg to along with a big handfull of crushed ritz crackers, put into a bread pan and spread a mixture of ketchup and heinz 57 on top, called it meat loaf and baked it rite along with the cabbage rolls. Neither pan made it past the second night.

I thought this was great.  My husband probably would have given four stars...his family made his more spicy/less sweet.  I had never eaten cooked cabbage before (don't like the smell).  Glad I tried these.

My mother in law is famous for her cabbage rolls. I couldn't find her recipe so I used this one... it was close by I had to make a few adjustments. I used ground turkey instead of the ground beef and used italian ground sausage so my husband wouldn't miss the beef. I doubled the tomato sauce like others here have and also added a 32 oz bag of saurkraut. A litte on the bottom of the pan under the rolls and the rest on top after the tomato sauce was added. I also cooked it in a 9x13 glass dish covered with aluminum foil on 350 degrees for 1 hour. I probably should have removed the foil for the last 10-15 minutes, but my husband said it was the best he has ever eaten... better then his mom's!!!  Thanks for the recipe and all the comments. They helped tremendously.

This was very good. I baked mine in the oven at 350F for 1 hour covered, and 30 minutes uncovered and it came out great. I doubled the sauce to pour on top, which tastes great. Next time I would still double the sauce, but use half mixed in the meat, and half poured on top. They seemed a little dry inside to us.

This is the second time making these and we just love them! I love crock-pot cooking! Some time savers are to separate the cabbage leaves and wash, stack loosely and place in a plastic bag and freeze overnight. The thawing process makes them plyable and no need to boil. Run hot warer over the frozen leaves to speed up thawing. No need to cook the rice if cooking 8 hours in slow cooker. For the sauce I used 2 cans of tomato soup with the lemon juice and brown sugar. I did not have any worchestershire sauce so I used a few shakes of A-1. Made mashed potatoes and apple cobbler and we had a great Sunday dinner. Cant wait for leftovers tonight!Will make this again.

This is very similar to my grandmother's
recipe as far as contents, but she NEVER
cooked the rice before mixing, and she
always cooked them on the stove top,
first bringing to a boil, and then a
slow simmer for about an hour.

I kicked it up a bit by adding a little Italian sausage to the ground beef, and extra seasonings. I also cooked them in the slow cooker (great).  They were a little "loose" right from the crock, but the left overs -- after being refrigerated -- WOW!  They were much much better the second night -- they firmed up very nicely and stayed more together after reheating in the microwave.  Huge hit -- can't wait to make them again!

Very Good base recipe. Used Meatloaf mix instead of plain beef. Also used tomato soup for extra broth as I served mashed potatoes toped with the broth.Lastly I threw in a bag of sourkraut something my mom always did with her piggies (cabbage rolls). I like the zesty taste the kraut adds

This recipe was delicious. The only thing I will do differently is double wrap the rolls in cabbage because we love cabbage and found it was lacking. Other than that the meat is so good and it turned out perfect in my slow cooker.

I agreed with the other reviewers, this recipe was a lot of work...for a fairly bland dish.  I also had problems with the cabbage falling apart and getting mushy. I somehow think that this recipe is not condusive to cooking in a slow cooker.

I had one unsuccessful attempt at making these years ago but this recipe was great. I did have a hard time preparing the cabbage leaves - used one of the other reviewers suggestion of coring then steaming the whole head which did help. I added one teaspoon of garlic powder to the meat and used 1/2 cup of minced onion instead of 1/4 cup. Also doubled the amount of tomato sauce. Baked it sealed with tinfoil for 45 min. Everyone LOVED it.

Do not make this meal if you are pregnant and/or strong smells bother you.  The end product tasted fine, but the smell of cabbage and all of the other things cooking all day made me so sick, I had to put my crockpot in my basement and try to air out the main floor.  My husband thought it was funny, but when he went down in the basement, he understood why!  By the time it was done, I could only eat 2 bites.  It does taste a lot better than it smells, I just couldn't do it.  I think it would have been pretty good if I were not pregnant and very sensitive.

My family really enjoyed these. I tripled the recipe for the sauce since my crock cooks hot and tends to burn things. However, I think doubling the recipe would have been plenty. My children thought it was a little spicy so I think 1 1/4 tsp. black pepper may be a little much for us. Oh, and in response to some of the other reviewers question about whether or not to cook the meat first. This is suppose to be like a steamed meat. That is why it is cooked so long on a low temp. Put your meat in raw so it sticks togeather when done.

Absolutely wonderful!  We just got our first slow cooker and I found this recipe after searching the site for crockpot recipes.  I had never made cabbage rolls before, but these turned out exactly like the ones I remember eating as a kid.  My wife loved them too, although they were a little too pepper-y for our kids.  But I will definitely be making this again.

Am I to understand that you don't brown the ground beef before you cook these?  I did, and they turned out fine, so I'm anxious to try it again properly.  Either way, looking forward to making it again, doubling the sauce and adding spices (garlic, onion soup mix) to the meat. 

I've never made these before and I think this is a great recipe to begin with!

I liked this recipe a lot. It was very tasty and easy. I made 3x the sauce, and I sauted the beef and onions together. I also added a little garlic and parmesean cheese. My husband really enjoyed it-and surprisingly so did my 4 year old son(whos diet consists of PB&J and Mac& Cheese)Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe, thanks! The only change I made is stirring in some sour cream into the sauce and it was absolutely delicious!

At first when I made it my husband liked it ok, but I didn't. My husband took it to work and told me it was awful. It's so bland. I really want to try it again and see if I can do something better with it, but the thought of wasting good beef makes me not even want to do it again.

This recipe was pretty good, but I made a few changes.  The sauce was BLAND, so I spiced it up a bit with a little garlic, soul food seasoning and some marjoram (personal preferance).  I also doubeled the amount of sauce, because the amunt in the recipe wasn't nowhere near enough.  Was simple but a bit time consuming to make.  One thing I think is simpler, is to bail the ENTIRE head of cabbage for  about 7 minuted then plunge into ice water, this seems to make removing the leaves in one piece a LOT easier.  My family loved it, and I will absolutely make this again.  Also, could be easily adapted to a stovetop simmering-type recipe. :0)

YUCK!  I am sorry, this recipe is not good.  I remember loving my Mom's stuffed cabbage as a kid, with the ground beef, rice and tomato sauce, with lovely green leaves, and tender and fresh tasting.  This was brown, and soggy, and blech.  I was so excited to try this recipe, but so disappointed with the results...I followed the recipe to a T, as I had never made this before myself...I will never use this particular recipe again and unfortunately do no recommend it!

Wonderful! Upon reading the reviews, this looked like one of those recipes that is "better the next day". So I made it the day before we were to eat it, and heated it up the next day, along with making some mashed potatoes as a side dish. I also increased the amount of sauce, as per a previous suggestion, which worked out well.

For as long as I can remember we have had cabbage rolls every single Christmas.  When you smelled the "Lushties" cooking, you knew it was Christmas Eve!  A MUST add to this recipe is CINNAMON!  Trust, me, it MAKES all the difference. 
My grandmother also used finely chopped celery and ground pork.  My Mother used V8 Juice in addition to the tomato sauce.  It gives it the extra necessary liquid that they need to cook.  I always use seasoned salt for good flavoring.  My aunt always cores the head of cabbage and then places it in the microwave in a big bowl with a little bit of water, which helps to make the softening process a little easier.   I never pre-cook the rice.  It will cook in with the meat and absorb the flavors as it is cooking, which is even better.   Lastly, use some of the leftover cabbage leaves to line your crockpot or baking pan which helps prevent sticking.  Mom always made these on the stove in a big pan, but I have also baked them and slow cooked them.  In our family when you have learned to master the cabbage rolls, it is a rite of passage!  Hope these tips help!  Enjoy!

After reading many of the reviews for this recipe i gave it a shot.  Making more sauce a must.  Cooking in the oven I believe was also a must.  I would add one other perhaps a  horseradish  sauce to put on top of each roll when served.

You just can't go wrong with cabbage rolls. I layered this recipe in my crock pot starting with half a head of cabbage, the meat mixture, half the sauce, the remaining cabbage and then the rest of the sauce. I used half ground beef and half ground turkey,  added  a teaspoon of  Worcester  to the meat mix, used brown rice and doubled the sauce.  It all disappeared!

This was amazing! Best I've ever tasted. I took Patsy Hennessy's advice and doubled the sauce. I used water instead of milk, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I tried freezing the cabbage instead of boiling it. It was in the freezer all night, but it was the size of a volleyball, so only half of it froze. It worked, but later I dropped the rest of it into boiling water. That seemed to work better. Especially after I turned the cored cabbage upside down and submerged it to get the hot water into the center leaves. The balance of sweet and savory was perfect in my opinion. Definitely will make again!

Only changes were that I used ground turkey instead of beef and added 4 cloves of garlic. I cooked the rolls in an electric pressure cooker for 18 minutes. They were superb!

I make these often and my husband loves them even though he's not a big fan of cabbage. It's my favorite vegetable so it satisfies my craving. I usually prepare these and cook one batch for dinner and freeze the other half. There's only two of us eating so we get two meals out of this recipe, with leftovers! Fresh lemons aren't readily available where we live here in the Midwest so I substitute red wine vinegar. These are great in the crock pot and in the oven.

I followed some suggestions by other reviewers. I added onion mix to the meat mixture, used a mixture of beef and pork sausage, added one small jar of minced garlic from produce department to 4 pounds of meat.  I decided to make a lot of the mixture and freeze for later.  These really turned out great!

I made these today and they were awesome. I messed with the recipe a bit and poured a can of fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes on the top of them along with the recommended sauce ingredients. I also added a cap full of apple cider vinegar to the sauce as well. The only thing I'll do different next time is add the vinegar and maybe a green pepper to the meat mixture. I will definitely be making these again.

Fantastic.   Took a little bit to prepare, but the entire family ate this like we were going to the chair.  I opened the fridge the next morning before work and died a little inside when I learned that my wife took ALL of the leftovers to work.

Amazing! So most and delicious. I through mine in a Dutch oven and put it in the oven for three hours at 250. The longer you can cook them the better the flavor is but it cooks in an hour thoroughly.

 I also added 1 teaspoon of cumin, half a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 3 tablespoons of parsley, and 1/2 of cayenne pepper to the meat and rice mixture. I used 1/2lb of ground lamb and 1/2lb of ground beef. Good base recipe but add whatever you want to spice it up!

This was so delicious and worth the time to put it together. I will make it again and double the recipe to freeze a portion. I used the suggestions of adding beef broth to the rice cooker, garlic powder, half ground beef and half ground pork, and then top the whole thing off with strips of bacon. Just wonderful and spicy from all the pepper. My only problem was getting the leaves off the cabbage in one piece. It came off in shreds. I boiled the cabbage as instructed but did it after taking the leaves off the head. It was a pitiful presentation with little chunks instead of rolls, but nobody cared because is was so good.

The sauce was decent, but the filler was bland. For the effort involved I probably won't make it again. On the other hand, if you don't mind the effort to form the rolls, beef+rice offer a lot of options to experiment with spices.

Made these with ground turkey and they were so yummy. I even forgot to add the rice so I just dumped it on top and came out fine. I used wild rice!

Made it pretty much as described (used a little white sugar because I didn't have brown on hand) and it is delicious! Every crock pot cooks somewhat differently, and I cooked it on high for about 2 hours to make up for lost time, and then on low for another 2-3 hours. It's yummy! Also, whoever suggested freezing the cabbage is a genius! No need to boil the leaves beforehand.

I wish I could give 4.5 stars. Very good, but I still feel like there is a little bit of room for improvement... I'm just not sure what because it was my first time making AND eating cabbage rolls. My boyfriend loved them and took them to work the next day. I definitely recommend this recipe! Only thing that I didn't like was that the sauce was pretty liquidy... Maybe I should have cooked it for an hour without the lid. Oh, and do steam the entire head of lettuce (as another reviewer stated) as it is easier this way to remove the leaves without tearing them.

So Saturday, I got an email from allrecipes featuring this one for cabbage rolls. I read some of the reviews, applied the suggestions of other cooks, and they turned out really great! Modifications: I prepared the cabbage by peeling of the outside leaves, cutting out the core and putting it in very hot/boiling water. The leaves came off the head without tearing! And, I added garlic to the meat, which is a MUST, and I doubled the sauce. Oh, and I didn't have any lemon juice, so I substituted half as much apple cider vinegar. I also cut up the rest of the cabbage into bite-sized pieces and threw it in... Terrific meal! I'll definitely make it again!

I made these for my Polish mother-in-law and my husband (who has eaten her family's recipe his whole life) and I got 2 thumbs up. She gave me a few suggestions based on her recipe. I do double the sauce recipe. I layer the rolls,sauce and sauerkraut in the crock pot this way.. little sauce, rolls, more sauce, sauerkraut then next layer of rolls, sauce, sauerkraut. End with sauce. Sometimes I sneak in brown rice instead of white and my husband never notices.

Yum, this is very good.  Like many other reviewers I doubled the sauce.  I also used fresh garlic because I love garlic.  I also cooked it in the oven otherwise I would have been eating at midnight.  Thank you to Merkleda (post from 2/3/09).  So easy to cook the cabbage. Definitely a keeper!

Yum!!!!
I always thought cabbage rolls were really difficult and time consuming to make! Not so!!
I took the advice of another reviewer and froze the head of lettuce then let thaw to make the leaves easier to work with-WHAT A TIME SAVER!!! As I put them into the slow cooker I thought "as long as they taste ok this is the way to do it"-freezing the head of cabbage IS THE WAY TO DO IT!!!
I also use ground turkey or chicken because I can't eat red meat-this works out perfectly-and I add extra rice to make it a bit more economical.
I don't like when people change so many things about a recipe then say 5 stars but I feel the changes I've made are more for saving time/money and the original would be even better.
*Note I do like non-stringy (very soft cabbage) cabbage rolls-like well boiled cabbage-that is how it turns out with the freezing method.

Loved this! Doubled the recipe itself and used most of my head of cabbage, and doubled the sauce recipe using Heinz roasted garlic tomato sauce. Added extra brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and lemon than the recipe required. Made a great sauce!

The doubled recipe plus doubled sauce took up most of the room in my 6 qt slow cooker, and after taking them out there was a LOT of watery leftover sauce in the pot. I wouldn't make more sauce than I did unless I was going to put it on top of the finished rolls when I pop them in the oven to reheat.

I used a stock pot to blanch my cabbage, and before putting it in I stuck a kebab skewer through the core, which made it SO easy to put in and out of the pot between peeling off leaves. No splashing boiling water and gave me something to grab that wasn't hot while peeling my leaves.

Excellent - will make again. Next time will take advice and freeze/thaw the cabbage & will make more sauce. 5 stars with those changes. I also took a shortcut and substituted a micro pkg Seeds of Change Quinoa & Brown Rice instead of the white rice. Will definitely do that every time as it made it healthier and gave it good flavor.

Wow! I used this basically as a base recipe with just a few small moderations. Nothing that would have changed it much though. The only thing I changed was the sauce. Oh and baked for 1 hr 45 mins @ 375 cause I was in a rush for dinner. First time I have ever had cabbage rolls and have a very picky husband! This was delish!!! So good that I'm making them 2 days in a row and doubled the recipe! Sooo glad I got curious about trying these!! This is going to be a frequent meal for us!! Thanx so much!! Would give it more than 5 if I could!! ??

One tip: After the cabbage leaves are steamed, it makes it easier to roll them up, if you trim out the tough stem portion of the leaf.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was pretty good. My only critique is that there was very little sauce. I will definitely make this again, just doubling the sauce next time. I made extra cabbage rolls and froze them without sauce. I can't wait to see if it was worth it!

Not enough sauce.  Followed the directions for the slow cooker and the cabbage was so overcooked that we could hardly taste it.  They might be better baked in the oven for a shorter time.

This is a decent start to what could be a great recipe.  The actual meat needs more flavor/spices to make it pop a little bit.  I would also double the sauce recipe.

Wonderful!!!!!!!  I hate to say it but I did change two things.  We used a local bulk pork sausage instead of hamburger and I am a mother of three with spontanious cooking and needed things done in 1 hour instead of 8 so I simmered mine in a stovetop pan for nearly 45 minutes.  Was so good I can not wait to make again...with my own twists!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was very good. As others suggested I did double the sauce and I agree it would have been rather dry had I not. The only other changes I made were to use ground turkey instead of beef and to add some garlic powder to the meat mix. Served with mash potatoes. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was really good. Thank you Saltair4 for the tip about freezing the cabbage.  I wish I had known this years ago.  We might have had stuffed cabbage more often.  It worked great.  I did use more sauce.  Instead of canned tomato sauce, I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and it could still have used more sauce.  But it worked great in the slow cooker.  Thanks again.

Great recipe.  My mother always cooked her cabbage rolls in water for awhile so she could drain the fat and then she added the sauce and continued cooking.  She also froze her head of cabbage, thawed and the leaves were ready to go!

These were good. I quadrupled the sauce, as others suggested. I also cooked in the oven, as I started late and didn't have 9 hours for the crock pot. I cooked them 1.5 hours at 350. They tasted good, but I didn't think the cabbage was cooked enough. I ate these a lot growing up (never made them) and the cabbage usually is soft, and the meat is soaked through a little with the sauce. Maybe you need to cook them in the crock pot to achieve this. I ended up putting them back in the oven for another 45 minutes, and they did get better.

Yummy yummy!  I did a few things different.  I did this on the stove over low heat for about 2 hours, which did result in all the liquid being sucked up (my fault) so the only thing I had left was a can of diced tomatoes with I threw in there and cooked until heated through. We LOVED this!  Very flavorful, and the texture is great!  Thanks!!

great recipe! I loved the flavor! I added a little of the Russian twist to it with a 1/4 cup shredded carrots and a tsp of dried dill weed to the meat mixture! gives it a little sweetness to it!

After reading reviews, I did the following:  added minced garlic to meat; doubled sauce recipe, and baked (covered with foil) in oven.  I baked at 325 since I was also doing rice pudding, for 1.5 hours.  The sauce is quite tasty, and I did use a lower fat ground beef.

I made this for my mom whom is a chef and it was a hit. I don't measure anything exact and used homemade spaghetti sauce in the meat mixture tripled as well as some garlic I just adore garlic and topped with more of my special spaghetti sauce witch I added sausage to I blanched the cabbage for 5mins it saves time and baked 325 for 1 hour then 30 minutes at 350 as someone else suggested even my 1yo and 4yo devoured their share :)

These were very tasty using the tips from another member, thanks!  I added garlic powder, 1/2 onion, and tripled the sauce.  Perfect. Using the 1/4 cup measure made it easy to stuff.

Never had cabbage rolls before until I tried this recipe the other night.  I thought these turned out pretty good.  My husband and I enjoyed them very much.  I did not cook these in my slow cooker, instead I cooked them in the oven @ 350 for an hour.

Vegan version:
Sub 2 medium baked or nuked potatoes and 1/4 cup of oil for meat, egg, and milk. Used jar of spaghetti sauce and tripled sauce ingredient recipe. Baked at 350 for 1 1/2 hours covered with foil in glass casserole dish. Last 10min removed foil. Excellent!

These are fantastic. I doubled the recipe for the sauce the second time I made these, because I felt there just wasn't enough the first time around. 

Enjoy!

These were great, and super easy! I followed the advice of previous reviewers & they turned out super! Adjustments: Double the sauce, add garlic to beef mixture (I used fresh), extra onion and sprinkle salt on rolls before adding sauce.

Definitely read reviews! I modified the recipe in the following ways: 1. using instant rice instead of cooked rice (saved time and turned out the same) 2. added 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the sauce mixture to the meat mixture to add more flavor and help the rice cook. 3. Used 95% lean beef still delicious. 4. Quadrulpled the sauce. I used a 15-oz can of tomato sauce and a 15-oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes for some spice. Added minced garlic (2-3 cloves) and about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.

I had extra meat mixture so I put it into greased muffin tins and poured sauce over them, cooked for 30-40 minutes and my hubby actually preferred these over the cabbage rolls because the meat cooked in the sauce, and left a nice little crusty top. YUM.

My husband's grandmother makes these (she calls it Sarma). Hers are great, but these were just as good. Next time I might add a little less sugar as the sauce was a little too sweet. Great recipe.

YUM!  After 13 years of marriage I finally saw my husband eat cabbage!  Not just eat it either, but go out of his way to get more on his fork per bite!!!!!!!!!!  
    I only changed two things.  1) I used a wild rice blend that I had on hand 2) I also used steak sauce in place of Worcestershire sauce since I discovered that we are out of Worstershire.
   I also, cut the pepper back a bit due to other reccomendations!  YUM!

I made all the adjustments and it still seemed a little bland to me.  It definitely needs more salt somewhere along the way.

This was so delicious! Instead of slow cooking I, too, put it in the oven at 350 for about an hour. I layered it in my dutch oven. Sauce, cabbage rolls, sauce, cabbage rolls, sauce. Plus 1/2-3/4 cups water. I also doubled the sauce, used instant brown rice (cooked first) and ground turkey.

I too am glad that I looked at other's reviews before starting.   I found that freezing the cabbage made it easier to take off the head, and then I boiled the leaves.  I used lean hamburger but added garlic salt to the recipe instead of salt.  For the sauce I used to cans of tomato soup, undiluted, and added honey and worcestire sauce to that.  I placed of layer of cabbage in the bottom of the crockpot and layered the cabbage rolls and the soup mixture.  Started the crock pot out on high and then dropped to low after 2 hours for another 2 hours.  My family loves them.

So good that even my 13 year old daughter went back for more!  Use ground turkey and brown rice to make them even more wholesome.  I'll add more veggies to the stuffing mix next time.

This was a thumbs up from my husband and kids! I took advice from others, and put 1/4 tsp garlic powder in the mix. I also doubled the recipe so I could freeze 1 pan of them. I also baked mine @350 for an hour. Yummy!

Fantastic!  I made them up last night (Sunday), put them in the crock pot, put them in the frig overnight, then put them in the cooker early this morning and they were done when I got home from work!  I love having dinner ready when I get home!  This is a delicious recipe.  The only thing that I changed was that I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested.  Great Recipe...thank you BJ!

Company was coming, so I doubled the filling recipe.  Cored & boiled the cabbage.  Next time I'll try the freezing approach.
I used one can of tomato sauce, 1 can of condensed tomato soup and 1 cup of salsa and 2 diced fresh tomatoes.  There was some filling left over, which I stirred into the sauce.

Very good, followed recommendations, doubled the sauce, 1 tsp pepper and baked it too. Will make it again. I spiced up the hamburger with garlic, Worcestershire and thyme.

I gave 4 stars because of revising it to my tastes, or I should say what I learned from my grandmothers. This is a traditional staple for my background at the dinner table. I cooked mine in the oven on 350 for an hour. I also doubled the sauce and added garlic to the sauce. I added Worcestershire sauce to both the sauce and the ground beef. From my grandmother's recipe, you add sauerkraut to the bottom leaves before placing the rolls down and then add sauerkraut after adding the sauce and then cover it with cabbage leaves. I then lock it all in with foil. Overall, a family favorite and will be passing it down for many more generations.

I enjoyed these but the family not so much. If you like traditional cabbage rolls then you'll like this recipe.

I think this is a good recipe, my husband thinks it is great recipe.  I did double the sauce, very glad I did.  Next time, I will make this with a little less pepper.  There is only 2 in our household, so I didnt cook the other 6 cabage rolls.  I stored them in the freezer for another meal, hoping they will come out just as tasty.

I have been making this recipe for over 20 years and it is the best.  The flavor is always good.  You can either use the crock-pot or the oven.  My mother used to use the oven to bake these and put some ketchup in the sauce, she was of polish ancestry.  I use more tomato sauce then recipe calls for.  These are also called Swedish Cabbage Rolls.  When my children came all along all 4 really like them.  They are great served with butter mashed potatoes.

This was...ok.  I made no changes other than to double the sauce and used cooked brown rice.  This dish would probably benefit from the addition of garlic to give it more flavor, as I found it somewhat bland.  Maybe we're just not cabbage roll fans?

Not sure what I did wrong, but the leaves were still kinda cruncy (grandma told me I should have boiled the longer before stuffing them)  And the filled was to "gummy"  I may try it one more time and see if I do a better job.  I did cook it in the oven rather than the crock, I was afraid it would get "mushy"

I normally make my cabbage rolls in a skillet on the stove and I should have known cooking cabbage for 8 hours would be a mistake. The cabbage was WAY over cooked! My whole house smelled...well...like over cooked cabbage, which is a horrible smell! The insides needed more spices as they were really boring. The best part of the recipe was the sauce. It was great, but it should have been doubled or tripled. Next time, I'll cook these on the stove in a skillet like I normally do, with more sauce and more spices in the meat.

I'd give this recipe as is 4/5 stars. I did what others suggested, added 2 cloves crushed garlic,  extra onion, doubled the sauce with a little extra sugar, and put a tablespoon of sauce in each one before i rolled them. I usually don't like cabbage rolls but these were excellent!! and the whole family loved them!! thanks

Absolutely delicious, made in oven, on 350, covered with foil for 1 hour.  Main tip is double or even triple the sauce for dipping.

This recipe is definitely delicious. I followed other reviewers and baked in the oven at 350 for over an hour.  The cabbage was still a little crunchy.  Next time, I will try this in the slow cooker...like the recipes suggests.

I like mine saucy so I used 32 oz of tomato sauce and 1/4 cup lemon juice with 1/2 cup brown sugar. I didn't have time for the crock put so I just used the oven like other mentioned and they were pretty good, served with mashed potatoes and used the sauce kind of like a gravy.

I loved this recipe and will make it again. The flavor was incredible and I have used several other recipes but this one was the best. The only thing I did different was bake it covered in my oven for an hour and a half. Might make double the sauce next time as this made it a little dry. Or if I have time I will do it in my crockpot as that keeps everything juicy.

Flavor of this was ok. I think I must have baked too long because I could barely taste the cabbage. Was a lot of trouble and not worth it to me. I did love the sauce. I doubled it as suggested. Dish was ok. Will not make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Advice: For best results with the cabbage first look for the flat head type, than put head in freezer till ready to use, then put head in hot water for a few minutes to defrost.  a)It will allow you to seperate leaves without tearing. b) The hard spine will be easier to trim. Also chop up the rest of the cabbage and spine cut aways, and add them to the bottom of the cooker sauce

I really liked this!  And my family did too!  I thought that cabbage rolls were more of an Asian dish, so I tweeked it a bit.  I didn't do the tomato sauce mixture and I didn't cook it in a slow cooker.  Instead, I precooked the beef and stuffed the cabbage leaves as directed, minus the salt.  Then I put them in a big 12" saute pan with about 1/2C of soy sauce.  Covered it and let it simmer for about 30 minutes, turning the rolls 1/2 way through.  Fantastic!!

These are great!  Just like I remember from home.  I followed other suggestions and added in some garlic to the hamburger mixture.  I also doubled the tomato sauce recipe and it was perfect.  I'd recommend using the extra cabbage leaves on top of the rolls when you put them in the oven.  Mine took over an hour at 350*.

I fixed this today; after slow cooking so many hours I must say I was disappointed in the final product.  instead of tomato sauce, use tomato soup; much better..the proof is in the sauce.

This recipe is VERY GOOD.  My husband and I will make this often!  I made a few changes for my own taste.  I doubled the filling to make 24 rolls (although still use 1 1/4 tsp. pepper-I agree with another reviewer that it was a little peppery) and quadrupled the sauce.  I also added a 4.5 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms (chopped up) and 4 ounces of tomato sauce to the filling.  I baked in oven at 350 degrees for 1 hour covered in foil, removing foil for last 10 minutes.  It took two 9x13 pans for amount I made.  I placed some sauce in bottom pans before layering rolls in and then poured rest of sauce over them.

I thought this was amazing. I made mine a little different using soy sauce, spaghetti sauce and tomato soup. Lots of sauce! It was very good : )

Quite tasty!  The boyfriend was originally skeptical, but after the first bite right out of the slow cooker - he said it's like meatloaf (in a good way).  It's flavorful and the cabbage lends a nice sweet/sour quality to the dish, and the sauce is really good.  I lowered the pepper to 1 teaspoon, and that's pretty much all that's needed - I can taste the burn that would come on with more.  I didn't put onions in my portion, and I can see what the onions did - a vidalia just melted in and added some other sweetness which overall just adds a great quality to the dish.  They melted right in.  I'll add onions to it all from now on.  Also used brown rice instead of white to be healthier and thought that was great too.  Hardly noticeable.  That overnight freezing of the head of cabbage is such a neat trick!  I just need to take it out of the freezer longer than a night for it to thaw all the way to the middle by cooking time.  The cabbage gives off a lot of liquid when cooking, so I recommend doubling the sauce which otherwise becomes so watered down it's unrecognizable.

I had never had cabbage rolls, but needed to use this head of cabbage I had.  Firstly, I am not sure how you all peeled off nice intact cabbage leaves.  I tired about 6 times and just had a mess.  So I switched this from a crockpot recipe to a casserole.  I julienned the cabbage, placed in a 9x13 pan, drizzled a little soy sauce (I really didn't know what it was going to taste like), then proceeded with the beef/rice mixture then the sauce mixture.  I needed to add a little water, but in 30 minutes at 350 I had a really nice casserole!  It was easy and cheap I've made it twice so far like this manner.  Kind of sloppy in the bowl, but nevertheless, moderate in carbs and filling.

This is the first time I ever ate or made cabbage rolls.  I made the following changes after reviewing the reviews: doubled the sauce, added 1 can of tomato paste to the sauce.  Used lean ground turkey, added 4 cloves of garlic fried with 1 medium onion, garlic powder, mustard powder (random sprinkle).  I baked it at 375F for 1 hr covered with cabbage and foil, then another 15 minutes without the foil cover (baked it in a 9 x 13 baking tin).  I served it with samosas and cottage cheese.  It was pretty yummy and authentic tasting but sooooo much work to make cabbage rolls from scratch!

These were good, after I followed the reviews of others.  I added 1 tblspn of garlic powder, 1/2 cup chopped red & green peppers to meat mixture.  Then to add some flavor to the sauce I added 1 chipotle pepper and about 1 tablespoon of the adobo sauce from it also.  Then I added 1 tspn cumin, 1 tblspn chicken powder, and 1/2 cup water.  Cooked in the slow cooker for about 5-6 hours on high.  This was my first time tying cabbage rolls and I thought they were great.  I will make these again.

i am sure that somehow this was my fault, but mine did not turn out good. i think i may have overstuffed the cabbage leaves with too much meat mixture or something but they were not good. giving it a four due to it being all the things i love, and since i think i goofed it up. be careful with the stuffin of the meat! :)

I think overall this is a great recipe. I did alter things a little though, the first is I never cook the rice, before stuffing I mix it right with the meat and it is always cooked and has a nice consistency. If you get a large head of cabbage it is fairly easy to remove the leaves before steaming and once steamed trim the thick stem down. I also just cook in an oven at 350 for about 45 min, they come out delicious without too much fuss (the meat would probably be very tender but I really don't pre plan things enough to wait hours for dinner). The best part of this recipe is the sauce, it can make or break cabbage rolls, and this is one of the better sauce recipes I have found.

ok! Sometimes I get tired of being the one who rates a 5 star recipe badly. Maybe I am a picky eater. I don't know. Anyway! I made these two times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Exactly as written above. No changes. It got 2 stars, because the meat was bland and dry, the cabbage was a PIA, there was too little sauce, and it was a PIA to cook the rice. Too much work and it didn't taste very good.   This time, 4-5 stars.  I read the reviews (DUH!) and followed other reviews advice. I added onion soup mix to the meat, quadrupled the sauce, (all ingredients, was delicious), added uncooked rice, cooked in the oven at 375 for one hour instead of the crock pot, and best of all, I used bagged shredded cabbage.  EASY! I spread cabbage on the bottom of a glass baking dish, rolled the meat into balls and placed them over the top of the cabbage, placed more shredded cabbage on top of that, and added sauce all over the top. DELICIOUS!!!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, was because the meat seemed the tiniest bit bland, even with the onion soup mix. I think next time I'll try minced garlic, or even adding some of the sauce to the meat mixture before rolling into balls. But I will definitely make it again like this. SO EASY and good!!!!!

Was very good. I'd probably give it a 4 but since everyone else raved/devoured it I allowed myself to be out-voted. The husband dislikes cabbage but it doesn't really tasted of cabbage and he liked the flavors. The 3 yr old and 18 month old devoured it.  I reduced the pepper to 3/4 tsp, added 1 clove garlic, used about 1/4 cup chopped onion, and pureed 2 cans of chopped stewed tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. It was very good.  I boiled 12 cabbage leaves as directed. I couldn't really pull them off the head without them tearing. I was a little concerned about it when I rolled them but the end result was fine. Maybe steaming the whole head would help.?

Not bad, I've forsure had better, but if your having trouble with getting the cabbage off, the best method is to freeze the cabbage, the leaves will almost fall of, the best way! And you dont not need to precook the rice! but make sure you have lots of tomato juice and baste them.

These were excellent-I prepared it the way it is written the first time & then changed it a bit the second & we loved them even more.  I added minced garlic, ground sausage, & lots of fresh parsley to the hamburger & used a can of tomato soup instead of the tomato sauce~served with crusty bread ~ I swear it is one of the best  meals ever!

I added a bit of green pepper and added the tomato sauce and other spices directly to the ground beef mix. I then wrapped the meat with the leaves and add a can of spaghetti sauce to the top then baked in the oven at 350 for 1 hour covered and an additional half hour uncovered. They were yummy!

As far as cabbage rolls go, this was good.  Honestly, I'd rather make meatloaf for work involved.  Also, neither my husband or I grew up with cabbage rolls so there is no nostalgia factor there either.  I doubled the tomato sauce, as suggested by other reviewers.  We thought the sauce and rolls were bland and the cabbage flavor was lost-that's probably due to my slow cooker.  I think it runs too hot and overcooks items.  If you love cabbage rolls, this recipe is probably for you.  Also, how can so many 5 star reviews be wrong?  :)

I made these for an annual Christmas party that I host each year for co-workers.  These are probably the best cabbage rolls that I have ever tasted.  I had more compliments and was even asked where I had purchased them.  I certainly don't want to loose this recipes.

Tasted great especially for a cold and dreary day. I made exactly as is with the exception of cooking on high for about 3 hour then low for 3 hours. Served with "Orange Glazed Carrots."

These were terrific! My whole family loved them! I used ground turkey instead of beef as it is much leaner. I also used 1/8c dried minced onion instead of 1/4c fresh onion. I doubled the sauce as recommended by other reviewers and I'm very glad I did. That way there is enough sauce to pour over the rolls once they come out of the oven. Delicious!!!

Delicious!  I read the reviews and used a large can of tomato sauce, extra brown sugar and less black pepper.  I didn't have time for the crock pot, so I used a glass baking dish and baked them covered at 350 for 90 minutes.  So good, almost better than my Nona's!

Very good, I made this with ground turkey instead of beef.  The meat mixture is great, the sauce is a little sweet.  I would recommend making 3x the sauce, but only double the brown sugar.

I love this recipe, but I like to make it easier. Freeze the cabbage like the other reviewer said, then mix the hamburger meat and UNCOOKED rice, salt and pepper. Wrap it up in the cabbage leaves, lay them in the bottom of the crock pot pour two cans of tomato sauce on top and water to cover... Just as good and a whole lot easier....

5 stars for sure! I made this for my daughters 19th birthday. It was loved by all. As suggested I doubled the sauce which was perfect. I placed in 350 deg oven x 1 hour then took lid off 300 deg x 30 mins. We did not find the pepper was "too spicy".Served with parmesan cheese on the side. It was a hit.

Yum! I did double the sauce and used a mix of pork and beef. added a little saurkraut on top and baked in the oven. great job on this one! thanks. adding to my comment March 5, 2012 I have both frozen and boiled the cabbage for this recipe and find that boiling is a much better method. I made these EXACTLY as the recipe says last night and the cabbage rolls were delicious! Tweaking a recipe is always fun and although I recommend to follow all recipes exactly as written the first time and then tweak I very rarely follow my own advise.  Happy cooking!

Fabulous recipe, I followed the suggestions about making more sauce and we thoroughly enjoyed every last kernel of rice, hamburger and sauce.  Thanks for sharing.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is my dh's favorite meal - and this did *not* disappoint!  I'm making it for the second time this wknd for my friends baby shower.  I do tweak it a bit.  8oz of tomato sauce is no where near enough sauce, but then again I cooked these on the stove top rather than the slow cooker.  I used 2 or 3 15oz of sauce to almost cover them.  I also used minced garlic - that's a given in this household [!!].  I let them cook on the stove top for a couple hrs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  They were divine!  I served with mashed potatoes and a green veggie.

We loved this recipe.  Had a little pizza sauce to use up so it went in also, and had to add plenty of garlic.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Thank you BJ for posting this!

These turned out wonderful. My sweetheart and I marveled at the taste. I used brown rice, otherwise, the recipe was as written. I will make these again.
Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe needed serious adjustments, but the end result was quite good. For the mixture I used 1 lb. Italian sausage and rice with the egg, two minced shallots and five cloves of garlic along with salt and pepper. For the sauce I mixed one 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and one 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes (both with juice), one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, 1 T. sugar, 2 T. lemon juice. 2 T. Worcestershire sauce, 1 cup of milk, 1 T. apple cidar vinegar and 2 T. melted butter along with 1/2 cup of onions and 3 cloves of minced garlic, plus a dash of cracked pepper. I also recommend serving over rinsed kraut and mopping up the extra sauce with Polish beer rye bread!

The pepper was too much, and sauce too little. In the future I would add some condensed tomato soup and a touch of cloves to the sauce. Also, we prefer to make our cabbage rolls with hot italian sausage rather than ground beef. Thanks ladies for the tip of freezing the cabbage it helped speed the prep up! Anyone have tips to keep the cabbage from disintegrating in the crock pot?

FABULOUS!  Can't say enough great things about this recipe.  The only real change I made was using 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce and 1 15 oz can of Hunts Meatloaf seasoning tomato sauce as the sauce to pour over the top.  This will be a regular at our house!

Used this recipe as a guideline, as I'm a lazy cook. As other reviewers had suggested, I put a head of cabbage in the freezer and thawed it on the counter overnight. The leaves were wilted and easy to handle. I doubled the original recipe I substituted 1 lb. medium pork sausage for half of the meat. For the sauce, i used 1 can of condensed tomato soup, 1/2 soup can of water, and 2 tbsp worchestershire sauce. This made an adequate amount of sauce. I also added a tsp of minced garlic and a tsp of italian seasoning to meat mixture.  I cooked this in the crockpot on low for 8 hours.  This was delicious, and I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow. One "funny" thing however, the cabbage leaves did not cut easily with a fork.

I must say it was very very good.  I did add garlic and some breadcrumbs and I also sauteed the meat for just a few minutes so that it wasn't completely raw.  The filling still held together nicely and because I did this, they were done in only 6 hours on low.    Also, if you freeze your cabbage and then let it thaw out over night you can eliminate the boiling step because the cabbage will be wilted and perfect for rolling.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is faboulus.  I however did double the sauce and added a bit more brown sugar and added about 1/2 cup of water.  I also cooked my ground beef before, added the rice, milk, and egg.  Then stuffed the leaves.  Then I placed them in the crockpot and cooked them on high for about 4 hours.  Excellent. !!!

Very bland.  I grew up in a Polish family and these were a staple at family gatherings.  I doubled the sauce even without reading the reviews.  I like my sauce thicker, so I added some cornstarch to thicken it up.  I also boiled my cabbage before rolling.  Sorry, I won't be making your recipe again.

I personally loved these, big cabbage fan that I am (it's the Irish in me!)  Husband liked the filling (the Iowa farm boy in him)  I doubled the sauce and added garlic to both the meat mixture and the sauce.  I also added oregano, basil and marjoram to the meat to give it more flavor.  I really liked the fact that you put them in the crockpot too!  Will make again

If you like tender meatloaf and cabbage, this is the recipe for you. I have never had any sort of stuffed cabbage dish before, so I didnt know what to expect. Very Tasty. Probably the best "meatloaf" recipe I have had. A little more time consuming than other crockpot recipes that I have used. I have 2 folders that I put recipes in. One folder is the "good" folder where I keep my favorite recipes. The other folder is the "Maybe next time it will be better" folder. Recipes that dont make either folder get put in the trash. This recipe goes into the "good" folder.

Some notes:
I used Kosher salt. No adjustments necessary.

I didnt have any onions at the time, but I did have a handful of shallots. No complaints.

Cooked it on low for 6 hours. I felt that if I cooked it any longer, it would have burned (I have a Rival Programmable 5.5 quart crock pot).

One head of cabbage is not enough. After using the useful leaves, I had half the meat mixture left over (plus a handful of cabbage bits, that will be put aside for stir fry).

Truly a great dish, reminiscent of the cabbage rolls my grandmother used to make.  I did add a can of diced tomatoes and garlic to this recipe.  I also chopped up the extra cabbage (with more chopped onion) and put it in the slowcooker before pouring the sauce over.

I have been making these for a while and we really like them. I do add garlic and tad of mexican oregano to the meat, also cut back on the pepper. I usually double or triple the meat and make about 24 large rolls and freeze half. I always double the sauce for a single batch, this is a must!
Edit on 3/2011; The meat mixture is very good in bell peppers also. I don't double the sause for them using 3 peppers cut in half, bake at 350 for 1 hour. I also always add at least 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp (abt) italian seasoning.

My first attempt at cabbage rolls and these were great!  I added a pressed garlic clove and garlic powder to the meat mixture.  Used regular sugar in place of brown as I didn't have any on hand.  I used a 150z. can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato soup for the sauce mix...also added a dash of cayenne to the sauce for a little kick.  Got rave reviews from everyone here for Sunday football.

At first I didn't think these would be a 5-star, but I had to do something with the extra cabbage.  I didn't use the regular old tomato sauce but instead a can of flavored tomato puree(to add a little zing).  There could have been more sauce so I will double the sauce part of the recipe next time I make them.  All in all they had an excellent taste to them and if you have someone who doesn't like cabbage, they can scoop out the inside and drizzle on some sauce.  Excellent!

I really loved this nummy recipe. I added a can of tomato soup to the sauce. I only made 8 nice sized rolls and the amount of sauce was perfect and the soup made it a nice consistency. I baked it for an hour covered at 350 and then uncovered for another 25 minutes or so. This is what I call true homecooking.

So easy, and quite delicious.  Some may say that they are a bit plain, but that is exactly the way I like them.  I did not double the sauce because I do not like sauce that much, but I can see how people who do would think that there was not enough to go around(especially if you bake them). I will definitely add this to my favorites!

LOVED IT!  Even my kids - ages 14, 6, 2, and 1 ate it.  The husband doesn't like cabbage but he loved this meal after he took the cabbage off.  Thanks BJ for a great and EASY recipe.  I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent!  My husband does not like rice or cabbage or ground beef for that matter but he really liked this one.  I didn't have tomato sauce so used ketchup.  I'm glad I didn't double up on the sauce because as it cooks more liquid came out of the cabbage and beef and the rolls were not burnt at all.

I loved putting this together in the morning and having a wonderful dinner when I came home. My 16 month old daughter and I loved this, my husband thought it was a little bland. We both agree next time we will double the sauce and maybe add a little more Worcestershire! Yummy!

Taking in mind that many people said they needed more liquid, I increased the amount of sauce by 50%. Still not enough. This recipe needs more sauce than indicated!

The first time I made this, I found it a little on the dry side.  The second time, I added 3 times the amount of tomato sauce, and it was wonderful.  I served it as a side dish at Christmas and it got rave reviews.

The only problem I had with this recipe was that when I put it in the crockpot there was not enough liquid and it got a little burnt on the edges.  

These were very good and got snatched right up at a church potluck.

My husband just went on and on about these cabbage rolls, I finally had to tell him "OK,OK, you love it already!"

The next time I make these rolls, I will cook in the oven. I don't know if its my crockpot or not, but the rolls were starting to burn and dry up.

I loved the taste and the ease of this recipe. However, I did not have time to use the slow cooker, so I simply cooked it in the oven.  I had a small cabbage from our garden that had very tight leaves, so I cut out the core and boiled it whole until I could peel the leaves apart. Then I boiled all the leaves a little longer. The small inside leaves I used too, by cutting them up and placing them in the bottom of the pan to help  prevent any sticking or burning (as suggested in another review). I will use this recipe again as it turned out  so well, even the rice worked out! This recipe "uncomplicated" making Cabbage rolls and would recommend it to anyone who has had difficulty before or  making them for the first time.

I guess if you like German /American  style cabbage rolls you would be satisfied. Been taught to make cabbage rolls by my Hungarian grandmothers and mother. Used much more onion  and plenty of garlic and the ingredient that makes it all come together..sauerkraut !!

I made this with a few adjustments, I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork with 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder. I also removed the leaves from the cabbage as they came off while boiling. For the sauce I used a jar of Newman's Marinara a can of tomato soup and 1/2 can of water. I put some leftover cabbage leaves in the bottom of a large crockpot added some sauce then layered the rolls in the pot it made 15 rolls covered with the remaining sauce and set on low for 8 hrs.
Definitely a keeper I have friends that are Slovakian and they thought it was like back home.

Good recipe for stuffed cabbage. Still searching for stuffed cabbage just like my husband's grandmother used to make. This was delicious though! I sub'd ground turkey in place of the beef, but followed the recipe as is. Felt something was missing in the filling, but couldn't pinpoint it.  TIP: Bring large pot of water to boiling, core cabbage and add to boiling water for a 2-5 minutes. Place colander over bowl and place cabbage in colander. Leaves should be pliable. Boiled rice (1/2 cup rice to 1-1.5 cup water) for 10 minutes, strained, and rinsed rice under cold water. I doubled the sauce and felt it needed more. Baked (covered with foil) in oven @ 350 F for about 1 hour. In the slow cooker, there would not have been enough sauce. If making this in the slow cooker, definitely triple the sauce. Recipe yielded 10 rolls from a large cabbage. Used remaining cabbage leaves on bottom of baking dish. Will be adding to meal rotation! Thanks for sharing!

I made these mostly following the original recipe but incorporated my mother in law's style of adding a few slices of fried bacon chopped up to the meat mixture. I love the sauce which to me totally highlights this dish. I did not cook them in a slow cooker, instead I baked them in a glass baking dish covered in foil. I basted them frequently with the sauce. I will be making them again.

I always like my food spicy so I added 2-3 teaspoons of my dried serrano peppers to the sauce and poured extra  on them.  Very easy to make!

So darn good! The meat mixture is about the same as any stuffed cabbage roll but OH THAT SAUCE!! I could have drank it all by itself. I did not put these in a crock pot but baked them in a 350° oven for one hour. I doubled the sauce and may have to triple it next time. I wasn't sure about that much brown sugar but it was perfect. The recipe made exactly 12 rolls. So delicious and it was so hard to only eat a few. Will definitely make again and again.

I cut the core out of cabbage and then placed core side down in microwave safe bowl filled halfway with water. Heat for 3 or 4 minutes or until leaves are easy to peel.  Much easier and faster way to heat cabbage.  Very good recipe and will be making again.

This was really delicious. The only difference is I added 2 cans of tomato sauce. This is a dish I always serve with rice and I wanted enough sauce for serving. Of course the sauce picks up flavor during cooking. Really good and flavorful.

Yum yum.  I added the extra can of tomatoes, but wouldn't do it again.  Was not necessary and would be better without it. The extra cabbage leaves under and over the rolls made it very moist.  Just don't try to eat the extras-they are just for insulation from burning.  They are wonderful.

I too added lots of extra sauce.  I let the leaves steam for about 7-8 minutes and it was perfect.  I added 1 Tbsp cumin and paprika, 1tsp of all spice, and 5 cloves of garlic.  It was delicious!

Made this with some changes after reading the comments. Increased amount of tomato sauce. Used a can of crushed tomatoes 28 oz and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. Blended them before adding to casserole. Will add some of tomato sauce mixture to meat mixture the next time for more flavor. Cooked in oven for an hour at 375 covered with foil. Family enjoyed it and it's a keeper. Thanks for sharing

I used a mixture of ground beef, ground pork, and Italian sausage.  Also, I did not have 8-9 hours, so I used a steamer in my Martha Stewart Dutch oven with a couple cups of water under the steamer, and cooked 45 minutes, slowly simmering the sauce in a saucepan on another burner.  IT COULD NOT HAV?E BEEN BETTER!

Made these for my christmas dinner , this was my first cabbage roll experience. I used ground Turkey instead of beef and used brown rice instead of white. added a bay leaf to the pot as well. Cooked on high for 2 hours and then on low for 3 and they turned out perfect. froze the leftovers and will be eating them tonight along with a salad. Will use this method again..its nice that it frees up oven space. the lemon juice in the sauce is a must !
UPDATE OCT/9/17
made these again with the beef as written and brought along to thanksgiving dinner . They were great.

Been making these for decades, but never saw a recipe without sausage added to the beef!  I mix half beef and half sausage, usually italian sausage, but any sausage works.  Also, I use tomato juice, or diced canned tomatoes for the tomato sauce.

Prefer to use 1/3 pork with beef, also freeze cabbage-great tip-best rolls are deveined leafs-precooked beef mix-drain fat-I k
like to add a couple racks of ribs to bottom of pan covered in saurakraut-cook 2 hours in oven at 350 cover completely in tomato juice-test one at 2 hours to see if tender-if not 1/2 hour more-enjoy.you might also enjoy lazy man's cabbage rolls-chop cabbage up and and cooked mixture-cover in tomato juice and cook same time-cover pan in tinfoil for easy stirring.

I made a couple of changes. I added several cloves of my homegrown garlic and baked the rolls in the oven at 350° for 50 minutes instead of 9 house in the slow cooker. I steamed the head of cabbage for 15 minutes to loosen the leaves without tearing. These were a big hit with our family and the few leftover rolls were even tastier the next day.

Excellent - this was my first time, but, I made changes.  
First, boil the cabbage more than 2-minutes, the leaves need to be pliable, so you need to let it boil long enough to make them pliable enough to wrap - it might have been 20-30 minutes. Next time, I also may try sour cabbage, it is available here (Canada) in supermarkets, but when I looked, they all sold out. With this cabbage, no need to boil the cabbage and the sour cabbage is a different taste.
Second, I didn't use the recipe sauce, which looks good. I used an Italian pasta sauce and the outcome was FANTASTIC. The flavors were really exciting - lots of good comments. I grew up with cabbage rolls and my Mom would make a rather plain tomato sauce, without any exciting spices - this variation was really something. Basil, oregano, garlic and tomato sauce.  Now - the recommended sauce recipe does look good.
Notwithstanding, the 9-hour slow cook makes a tender, extremely flavorable meal!!

Made per listed recipe.  I really enjoyed this, but i can see where adding tweaks for more sauce would be an improvement.  I used the suggestion on freezing and then thawing the cabbage head as opposed to boiling the leaves.  That worked GREAT!  Saved a lot of time and hassle.  I am not sure that the 30 min prep time assessment for this recipe is accurate.  Took me longer and I didn't even boil the cabbage, but maybe I am slow.  I suppose that making it a second time would speed things up a bit.  

Overall it was really good!

I  thought it was a great meal, but needed a little more zing in the sauce.  I added a bit of siracha and it gave it what I needed.  I will make it again though.

I never had made cabbage rolls before but these ones were my first and I loved them. I wish there had been information about how to prepare and peel off the cabbage leaves included in the recipe but I did manage and then went looking for the information elsewhere.
All in all, they turned out well but they will be easier next time, I am sure. I will be making them again!

The recipe was easy to follow and tasted pretty good. I think I'd zip up the meat filling by adding some seasoning and garlic. I didn't cook them in a slow cooker, but stovetop on low for about an hour. Worked just fine. As a plan-ahead hint, you can freeze your head of cabbage (with the heart already removed), and then thaw the day before so you can avoid having to parboil the cabbage for rolling. Works great! 

I'd make this again (and spice up the filling with garlic, Worcestershire sauce, maybe some fresh rosemary, thyme, etc.) But this was an excellent basic recipe from which to start.

I had been craving cabbage rolls and this recipe satisfied it very nicely!  The tip on softening the leaves made the rolling super easy.  

I didn't change a thing!

Used 1/2 93 percent lean beef and 1/2 80percent pork. Forgot the milk and egg. Didn't miss it. Used vinegar in place of lemon cause I didn't have any. Wrapped and froze additional meals. Can't wait to cook those!!!

I made this dish in two separate pans, one with changes and one without.  Prior to filling each leaf, I steamed the cabbage to make sure the leaves didn't tear while pulling them apart.  The one without changes was good, though a little blander than I would've liked.  The second dish, i added garlic into the meat mix, made the rice with beef stock,  and added a little tomato sauce into it; I also layered the bottom of the pan with sauerkraut as another used suggested.  Even with the changes, the second dish would have been alright, but the sauerkraut added that flavor making it great!

The sauce for these was awesome!  I quadrupled the sauce and still could have used more.  Also, we used quinoa instead of rice, half ground turkey/half beef,  and it was delicious.

My family loved this dish, next time I make this it will need to be doubled as there was no left overs. 
I used turkey burger, and also mixed pork sausage into the mixture.
I didn't use the slow cooker instead baked in the oven, only think I would change if you decide to bake in the oven to reduce cook time is possibly steaming the cabbage or boiling a couple minutes longer as mine was slightly under cooked.

I actually vegetarian-ized this recipe by subbing the beef with 1 lb tofu (added 1 T onion powder and 2T garlic powder and crumbled) and skipped the milk. I also added chopped mushrooms (about 1/4 cup). I did use an egg, but a flax egg would have worked just as well. I only put it in the slow cooker for 6 hours, and even that was a bit too long (lost most of my sauce)! Next time, I'll go for 4.

Still, they turned out amazing! Great base recipe to play around with making easy, vegetarian or vegan cabbage rolls!

Loved this recipe and used many of the suggestions from other reviews.  

Best suggestions:
-quadruple the sauce recipe to have enough to cover all of the cabbage rolls
-core the cabbage and then let it cook in the boiling water for 2 minutes; leave the cabbage head in the pot and peel off leaves one by one, super easy!

My husband and I loved it. I followed some of the reviews that were posted and here's what they were: added 1 28oz can of diced tomatoes and 1 28oz can of crushed, 4 cloves of garlic, about a tbsp of garlic salt, 3 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp lemon juice. We baked it in a 9x13 casserole dish (wasn't quite tall enough so spillage happened) for 1hr at 350 F.  
Suggestions: make sure you use a medium to large head of cabbage, because mine was so small it yielded only 8 and two of them fell apart! If you are boiling it cut the base out so you can peel the leaves back easily and it boils/soaks all of the leaves.  And lastly, you might want to season the sauce with more than what is posted because it may taste a little bland and ALL tomato.
10/10 will eat/make again.

These are fantastic, after reading reviews I used ground buffalo, it is much leaner than beef and higher in protein too! I also baked covered for an hour at 350°. My husband also really enjoyed these, my kids however didnt even give them a chance! But I will be makeing these again!

I really liked these, they taste like what my grandmother made. So simple and good! Food doesn't need to be fancy or trendy to be delicious. I will double the sauce next time, but even still, these were perfect as is. I prefer to blanch the leaves as the recipe directs, and the salt and pepper seasoning is just right.

Came out great, added the dill and did pork sausage as part of the meat.  I used a mixture of V8 and crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  My husband said it was just like the Sarma his Grandma used to make.  Kids loved it too!

I'm sorry to say that the flavours in the recipe were just way too basic and didn't satisfy my craving for a good cabbage roll dinner.  The sauce was too sweet and the whole dish was way too bland.

I've never had stuffed cabbage before.  My mom was over tonight for dinner and I wanted to try something different.  My husband threw out the idea of stuffed cabbage so I searched the website....this recipe is absolutely delicious!  I used the "Best Marinara Sauce" along with this recipe and baked it in the oven as others recommended.  It's now been added to "My Recipe Box".  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe a while back. I doubled the sauce and add extra garlic and spices to the meat but even with the extra help it was still bland. However what was most disappointing was the bland tomato sauce. I made this in the crockpot, maybe the oven would have helped the flavor? The sauce would improve greatly with more seasonings and maybe some fresh herbs to boost the flavor.  I feel like the concept has potential and like the idea of a slow cooker meal, but neither my hubby or boys liked the meat/rice combo or bitter soggy cabbage leaves---so sadly I'm outvoted.

The sauce was completely dried up on top of the cabbage and burned around the edges.  The filler was essentially flavorless....I did 8 hours on low, in a crockpot that we use all the time for other recipes.

This is recipe is great.  Haven't had cabbage rolls in years, and this hit the spot.  I did follow others suggestions and 3x's the sauce, and added a touch of garlic powders to the ground beef.   Can't wait to have left overs for lunch today.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It was delicious.  It was very simple to put together and using the slow cooker was a bonus!  I made them, turned on the cooker and the house smelled great all day.  My entire family yummed these up (even the baby!).  This will be a staple in our home from now on.

It was a lot of work stuffing the cabbage. The tomato sauce was bland.  Next time I think I will make "deconstructed cabbage rolls" and use red cabbage for a better color contrast.

This recipe done many times my favorite. I make it with 1/2 ground beef 1/2 ground pork, the pork with the tomato sauce with brown sugar makes it a little more sweat taste, no need for any toppings like sour cream as some recipe I do add.

Definitely not a favorite around our dinner table and seemed to be lacking in seasoning.  Tomato sauce was too runny for our liking.  Will try a different recipe next time.

As written, this recipe is a bit too dry and bland. It gets a ratings (and flavor) boost by doubling the sauce (or even tripling it which I like to do to have extra to spoon over mashed potatoes), and adding some fresh minced garlic and a bit of basil to the dish. My only other change is personal preference - I use ground turkey in place of the ground beef to keep it leaner and healthier without sacrificing on flavor.

We just love cabbage rolls, our Mom used to do then often.  When I find a new recipe, I will try it. It is our family all-time favorite, we did a huge batch, we let it cool then we freeze, we always drop some to our parents who can't cook much any more.  It was hard not to eat too many.  Our parents are in their 80's and they loved it also.  Thank you for sharing.

Needs more flavor as is but with additions it's pretty good.  My Russian/Ukrainian side was satisfied.  This is also a a good recipe to double if you want to freeze for later.  Put half in a freezer bag with plenty of sauce and you've got a meal for another day!

I really liked this recipe. Next time, I will remember to reduce the amount of pepper I just forgot this suggestion from others! I may also chop off the remnant cabbage and make a bed to put the rolls on and then pour the sauce. I may also not really double the recipe's sauce. Mine came out with too much of it. My 4 star rating stands mostly for the pepper content which I find too peppery for my taste and my stomach can not handle it well either.

I love cabbage rolls, and I really enjoyed these, although because of dietary concerns I had to omit the brown sugar. However the fiance wasn't completely hooked. So next time I substituted cayenne pepper (to taste) for the brown sugar instead of simply omitting it, in order to give the tomato sauce the little something it was lacking the first time around. He absolutely LOVES them that way! 

A note on the amount of sauce: people have commented that there is not enough sauce.  That is entirely dependent on the dish that you use. If the cabbage rolls fit snugly into the dish with no extra room then you will have plenty of sauce.  If you have open space then no amount of sauce in the world will keep your rolls from drying out.

I took in a number of reviewer suggestions (ie, increased the onion, added garlic powder, doubled the sauce, baked at 350 for 1 hr) but these improvements didn't help me any. The filling seemed mushy and bland, we needed steak knives to cut into the cabbage, and the in-your-face tomatoness of the sauce dominated the whole thing. Sooo many reviewers recommended baking, but I can't help but wonder if the slow cooker would have been better. This recipe seems to need so much punching up and fine tuning to turn out well, I think you're better off starting somewhere else.

Excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I put it in the slow cooker on high for 5.5-6 hours (as opposed to low for 8-9).  They came out very moist and tasty...I serve with a little hot sauce to add flavor.  I disagree with some reviewers that you must double or quadruple the sauce.  I don't like my stuffed cabbage soaked in tomato sauce and the amount the recipe calls for is just enough sauce to give a light coating. Of course if you want a lot of sauce you should make more, but I don't think its a 'must'.  Very happy with the results...will make again.

This recipe was delicious.My vegetarian daughter was visiting so reluctantly I used those non meat crumbles.It was a fun recipe.. peeling and stuffing the cabbage.I added a bit extra sauce to the recipe and the stuffing mixture.My daughter never had stuffed cabbage and informed me she didn't think she'd like it.Just the opposite she went back for seconds!My thanks to the contributor.

I had high expectations of this recipe, but it was only good, not great. The proportions of the sauce, meat filling and cabbage leaves seemed perfect to me, which is pretty impressive. But I just felt that the filling made the dish taste like meat loaf wrapped in cabbage leaves. It really needed something to spice it up. If you make this, I would suggest looking at other comments for suggestions. Maybe a ton of garlic? Chopped celery? Fresh dill? I'm at a loss, but it definitely needs something.

My wife doesn't like cabbage very much but she loves these. I add about 1 tsp of caraway seeds, and put lots of Parmesan Asiago Romano cheese blend on top at the last 15 minutes of cooking time . I baked mine in the oven at 350 for about 1 1/2 hours  but the cabbage was still a little tough. 2 hours would probably be good. Still very good

I've never had Cabbage rolls so I have no idea what they should taste like. I followed the recipe, except I tripled the sauce recipe. I did not want dry cabbage rolls. Once they were in the crockpot, I sprinkled salt and pepper and then poured the sauce.  These were....eh...OK. Kinda plain, not very exciting. They weren't terrible or nasty, but they weren't anything I would make again.

I agree with the others -- the sauce needed to be doubled.  I also used 1/2 lb ground sausage and 1/2 pound ground beef to give it a little extra flavor.  This was a great recipe.  Definitely making it again.

Awesome. As others have stated in their reviews, doubling the sauce is a must. I used brown rice cooked in chicken stock. went with Italian herb ground turkey and added 3 cloves of minced garlic, pinch of smoked paprika, 1/8 tsp of dry mustard, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/3 cup of chopped Italian parsley, and backed off on the salt and pepper to 1/2 tsp and 1tsp, respectively.  Topped it off with 2 cups of sauerkraut and a small strip of bacon on each roll and baked 1 hr at 350 in a glass pan covered with foil.  Discarded the bacon, garnished with Italian parsley sprigs and served - was a big hit! Also try this dish on a smaller scale cutting the cabbage leaves in half and stuffing with 1-2 Tbs for a fabulous finger food appetizer.

These were received most enthusiastically by my family. I did add a pinch of garlic powder as some had suggested, and did double the sauce as well. One mistake I made was add the brown sugar to the beef- and whoops, could not take it out, so just mixed it in. Not sure how much of a difference it made, but it did taste wonderful!

The entire family enjoyed this!! One of the kids even had thirds. I cooked mine on the oven at 350 for an hour as other reviewers have mentioned. The hardest part was getting the head of cabbage to release its leaves for me, but the praise from my hubby & kids made it all worth it :-)

I haven't had my Mum's cabbage rolls in years, but I think these are better. I've made these several times now. Each time I doubled the sauce. Last time I used a lovely tomato sauce (strained tomatoes, actually) from Italy which made them spectacular. I cut the core out of the cabbage and boiled it whole, and the leaves peel right off without ripping. I also read a review (thanks, Avon Lady Lisa) that says to trim out the thick part of the leaf which makes it easier to roll. I baked them in the oven for an hour at 350, covered with foil, as suggested in another review. I love these cabbage rolls.

As other advised I added garlic powder and mustard powder and cooked in the oven for an hour.  These are delicous and great leftover!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but for a couple of things.  (1) the meat mixture is pretty bland so next time I will add something other than salt and pepper and (2) I changed the sauce and used tomato soup but still added lemon juice; none of the other sauce ingredients and it still was not enough.  I read several reviews and followed the advice of boiling the whole head of cabbage first.  This worked out very well.  I also cut out the hard center of each leaf and this made for a perfectly folded "pouch".  This is a great basic recipe that screams for your special touch and tweeks.

I found the meat mixture with the cabbage tasty but the rice turned out too mushy.. thinking that cooked rice gets overcooked with 9 hrs in a crockpot.. wondering if I should have used raw rice?  Suggest serving with plain yogurt as a topping instead of sour cream.  Excellent!

Based on taste I would have given it 3 stars but I chose 2 because of the effort.  I had really high hopes but felt very disappointed.

AWESOME! Doubled the sauce like many others did. Other than that, didn't make any changes. Tastes just like my grandma and grandpa used to make. Brought back great memories. Thanks for a great recipe :)

Loved this recipe! I am on WW and figured this would be low in points and it was.  I got 10 rolls out of it with each roll being only 3pts and 2 rolls was all I need for dinner.  I had never tasted stuffed cabbage before so I had no preconceived notion of how this would taste.  However, my husband is Polish and he loved it as well and gobbled it up.  He said the only difference was that this sauce was sweet whereas his mothers sauce was not.  I did take other reviewers suggestions when I made this.  I added some garlic powder to the ground beef as well as a little of the tomato sauce mixture.  I also used brown rice and I doubled the sauce.  I also doubled the brown sugar but next time I will use less.  I cooked it in the crockpot for about 5hrs.  My only trouble was with the cabbage leaves.  I couldnt pull them off without breaking so I put the cabbage in a pot of boiling water and that seemed to work well.

My grandma used to make cabbage rolls for me, and they were my favorite!  Now she's gone, and I have been wanting to try making them myself.  This recipe was almost exactly what I was craving!  The only changes I made were to include beef soup base when cooking the rice, and I doubled the sauce.  It was delicious as is, but the next time I make it, I might add a little bit of the sauce to the beef mix before rolling it up.  Fantastic recipe, though!!

The sauce really makes this dish...although I used a 29 oz. can and multiplied the lemon juice, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce by 3-1/2. Also, the cabbage leaves need to be boiled much longer, more like 5 minutes. Mine were too hard to handle when rolling, and were tough when the dish was finished. I baked it at 350 for 1 hour.

Quadruple sauce at a MINIMUM.
use half pork sausage half ground round
core cabbage head and place entire head in to be steamed- leaves fall off.  Do not freeze cabbage- makes leaves rubbery

Instead of ground beef, I boiled 2lbs. of chicken breast with just enough water to cover. I sauteed scallions and garlic and added it to the shredded cooked chicken. I then followed the recipe adding milk, egg, salt and pepper, then the cooked rice (which I used half white/ half brown-and half water/ half chicken broth). Excellent!

I thought this was ok. I ate a lot of cabbage rolls growing up and I don't remember them being sweet. I think if I try this again I will o it the brown sugar or just use less. And the directions should state to par-boil the whole cabbage to losen the leaves.

This is a keeper...I followed other reviewers and doubled the sauce, which is delicious!  I also added about 5 garlic cloves (minced) - personal preference and had to use lime juice because that's what I had on-hand...oh, and I used ground pork because that's what I had. Baked covered for an hour @ 350.  Perfect...my 5 and 3 year old boys loved it!

Guido gave this 4 stars, about 3 stars more than I would give. Made it almost exact but changed up: shallots instead of onion. Savoy cabbage instead of cheap kind. Add-ins: garlic, salt, 1 jar Barilla onion & garlic pasta sauce. Salt, it needed lots of salt. I also used ground turkey but honestly, I'd do it again because it goes in raw, I don't want the rolls swimming in cow lard... Un-tasty. My man was VERY happy.  Oh yeah-I covered with foil and baked one hour. No biggie, cabbage was so tender. It just needs more seasonings. I'll do it again, anything for Guido.

I thought this was very good for a base recipe. I used shallots, onions, and garlic, as well I used Quinoa instead of rice. We are hunters here, so I used half ground elk, and half ground pork ( I partially cooked the pork in a pan with some garlic, then drained off the excess fat) I also added fresh dill, parsley, and basil. They turned out fantastic!

Definitely triple or quadruple the sauce recipe or it will be on the dry side. The sauce was a little sweet too, so maybe go light on the brown sugar. My parents usually just use canned tomato soup and it turns out great. I might try that next time!

Very good & easy ... but didn't read the reviews first. Should've followed my gut feeling about the equal parts of salt & pepper! Way too much pepper!!! Will definitely make them again with some modifications!

Everything made as original recipe, only issue is getting cabbage off without tearing, should have froze entire head first so it comes off without tearing.

I was not impressed with this recipe; I found it to be very labor intensive and dry.  I will try this again but make adjustments.  One tip I read and tried was to use uncooked rice; maybe that would have worked had there been more liquid.  All in all, not one of my favorites.

I grew up eating "Pigs in the Blanket" but no one makes the sauce like my mom.  She browned the gravy and added it to the water the cabbage was cooked in for a few minutes to soften the leaves. Anyone make this Polish dish like this? Hard for me to use tomato sauce.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars only because there was WAYYYYYYY too much pepper in this recipe.  I'd advise cutting the pepper down half.  I cooked mine in the oven, on 350 for an hour and a half.  Texture came out great, also, make sure you double the sauce.

First time making cabbage rolls, and I found them to be a little bland. Maybe this is just how they are supposed to be, but I will make again, next time adding a little extra spice. Maybe cayenne?

I like the recipe and even subbed in some sweet ground pork into the ground meat but i only gave it four stars because the sauce recipe definitely needs to be doubled or even tripled. I had to get really creative with my sauce to double it and i wish i had known in advance.

need some input here, first time making these, the meat and sauce were very good, but the cabbage leaves were very tough, difficult to cut and chew. I cooked these for 1 hour at 350 degrees, covered , in the oven instead of the slow cooker. I used the freezer method with the cabbage. Anyone else who used the oven for this recipe have the same problem with the cabbage?

Great basic recipe to start with.
Baked 1hr covered at 375 F.  Came out wonderful.
Added more spices to meat:  rosemary, oregano, paprika, parsley, garlic powder and garlic salt (in lieu of salt)
Added more spices to tomato sauce:  oregano, salt, and pepper.

Used other reviewers idea of blanching entire head of cabbage (after you core it) in boiling water.  Worked great!
Will definitely make again.

Great recipe, just like Babcia's!  I doubled the sauce and filling recipe and just cored and boiled 2 whole heads of cabbage, since mine were on the smaller side and I wanted to fill the crock pot.  I also put a layer of leaves down first in the bottom of the crock pot.  Great recipe!

I did try this tonight. If you have heart trouble do not put all that salt in. It was uneatable. My husband loves sweet and sour cabbage rolls we didn't even taste the sweet or sour. Making it in a slow cooker for 8 hours was long and it needed more grave. Very disappointed.

I didn't have any ground beef so I cooked my rice with some beef bouillon and substituted cooked beans for the meat.  Texturally, I would have liked some more crunch and less mush (I don't think that would have been completely fixed by the ground beef), but the flavor was quite good.  I'll make them again

tip for the cabbage.. Instead if boiling in water to soften, core the head and put in plastic bag and microwave on hi for 11-12 min.  Cut the back of the cabbage leaves to make rolling them easier. I also use equal parts of pork and hamburg.

These are great.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and made the following changes:  decreased pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, tripled the sauce (we love sauce in my family), added two cloves of minced garlic to the meat mixture and doubled the onion.  I also did not have any lemon juice so substituted apple cider vinegar.  The tip to freeze the cabbage instead of cooking it was a good one, though I forgot to budget in time to defrost the cabbage and had to use the microwave to thaw it out.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really good, but I have had better. Going to keep searching for the recipe to keep forever. This one too juicy, not "saucy". Maybe could have used a little more rice too? Not bad though.

Perfect just the way it is! My husband raved about it and wanted me to save this one. That rarely happens. The one thing though is to make sure the cabbage is cooked well before trying to roll. If it isn't, the leaves break. It needs more like 4-5 minutes.

i have tried this recipe a number of times and it always turns out perfect! the only thing i changed was adding some dried oregano, basil, and garlic powder to the meat and sauce mixture....this is a personal preference, by no means a necessity. :) great recipe, thanks for sharing!

We really liked this, although my husband asked for more seasoning next time, he thought the mixture inside the rolls was a little bland (couldn't even tell there was meat inside). I'll definitely make this again, but add more salt and likely some garlic and onion seasoning.

4 stars as is (too spicy with the pepper).  5 stars with a couple changes.  As suggested by others, double the sauce, add 1/2 cup onion and use no more than 1 tsp pepper.  Then you get excellent cabbage rolls.  I've tried others, and they usually get the sauce all wrong.  The sauce here is perfect.

I changed this recipe a bit. I cooked the hamburger and drained it. I excluded the egg and milk on account of not having 8 hours in a crock. I added 3 cloves of garlic and 2 tbsp of oregano and 2 tsp garlic salt. I did not use their sauce recipe but used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and put some on the bottom of the crock first then alternating layers of rolls. This recipe was SO GREAT! My family all went back for seconds. Definitely a KEEPER!

Good and easy, though a little bland.  The second time I made them, I added garlic, onion, and some other seasonings and it helped.

Have used this recipe for a couple of years now. My uncle who hates cabbage rolls actually ate these and enjoyed them. I usually always go by recipe, did double sauce.  I did however tonight put a little colour in it, I had some left over tomato in fridge and green pepper and yellow zucchini, so diced up a bit of each and it was really good. Froze half as only 2 of us.

Added a can of diced tomatoes and doubled the other sauce ingredients.  It was still lacking a bit.  Otherwise not too bad.  If I make it again, I will add more cabbage to the bottom of the crock pot as per reviews.

Instead of white rice I used spanish rice and it adds a bit more flavor.  I use half white half spanish rice, but if you wanted more spice you could just use spanish rice.

These were pretty good. I used real onion instead of minced and put lots of garlic in the beef mixture. Baked these in the oven at 350 for about an hour and ten minutes. Sauce was sweet and a little tangy....filling was great. I would make these again =)

These are the bomb!  I stayed as true to the recipe as possible for me and doubled the meat, added an envelope of onion soup mix (omitting the need for any more onion), replaced the milk (1/2 cup for double batch) with the juice from 28 oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cups of uncooked instant rice, salt & pepper to taste. For the sauce, I crushed the whole peeled tomatoes with my hand & used another 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 6x'd the brown sugar, lemon juice and worcestershire sauce. I baked them covered in a 350 degree oven for about an hour...a definite keeper in this household! Thanks to BJ for the wonderful sweet and tangy tomato sauce!

This is a wonderful recipe! This is my first attempt at making Cabbage Rolls, and it came out fantastic! The only thin I would change is the amount of pepper.  It was a little too peppery for my taste, but it was very, very good.  My husband enjoyed them as did I.

This recipe has potential. I froze the cabbage head and let it thaw out in cold water to make the leaves easier to peel, but when the meal was cooked, the cabbage was still too chewy. Maybe this works if you use the slow cooker, I used the oven. I did double the sauce but quadrupling would be better. I added freshly diced tomatoes to the sauce and used a whole onion instead of just a 1/4 cup. Next time apart from boiling the cabbage instead, I think I will add more garlic powder or fresh garlic and more sauce. I think I will cook it longer too, because the ground meat was not cooked enough for me. Overall, it is still a good recipe.

Really good.  Based on other reiews I cut back on the pepper a bit.  I don't have a slow cooker so I covered them with foil and baked at 350 for about an hour. These are a great "make ahead" dish.  I prepared them several hours before cooking, just covered them with foil and into the fridge.

Very tasty. Made per the directions and the only changes I would make are to definitly double the sauce, and add some garlic and more salt to everything! We love garlic and salt in our house!

I made these last night and they turned out great, especially since I've never made cabbage rolls before.  Based on other reviews I did make a couple of small changes.  I added some garlic powder to the mixture and some Mrs. Dash as well (we're watching our sodium intake).  I also used the process outlined by other posters for removing the leaves from the cabbage.  First I cut around the core of the cabbage and then placed in in a pot of boiling water.  Within about a minute the leaves started pulling away and it was pretty easy from there.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for about an hour with double the sauce and it came out perectly!

I grew up on this recipe and this is a great version of what mom made.  One tip I remember that I'll pass along is to microwave the cabbage before rolling.  Makes them much more pliable and easy to do.  We served it with mashed potatoes.  The tomato sauce mixed with the potatoes is so good!

This is a great crockpot recipe!  It is too time consuming to roll the meat in the cabbage so I just layered the beef mixture with some raw cabbage leaves and then topped with the sauce mixture.  I don't cook my rice as I use 1/2 cup Minute brand brown rice from the boiling bags instead.  It turned out great!

Ok but needed more flavor.  Didn't like the sweet tomato sauce with it.  Add would bake instead of using crock pot next time.  My whole house stunk for two days.

I took this recipe and used it as base to work from.   I used 1lb of hamburger and 1 lb of italian seasoned ground turkey.  I had enough meat leftover to make 12 more and would have had to double the sauce.  I cored and boiled my cabbage to make it easier to peel off the leaves in one piece without tearing.  After making the rolls I placed them in a coverd baking dish and baked for 2 hours at 350 degrees, which was perfect. Next time I will make sure to double the sauce so that I can use up all the meat. This is definately a keeper with the added changes.

I give it 5 stars, but with the following changes.  Triple the sauce recipe and add garlic to the meat mixture.  I baked mine in the oven at 375 for 1 hour 15 minutes and then another 15 or so with the cover off.  They were delicious and easy.  My first time to make them!

Rice and meat mixture was great, but the sauce was more tangy than I'm used to (not the traditional Manitoba taste, usually made with tomato soup).  Very good, but I won't make again.

Outstanding!!! I've eaten cabbage rolls my whole life and have made them for my family for the past 40 years. I make them with a sweet and sour sauce and sometimes with sauerkraut, but this beats them all.  I didn't use the worch. sauce and I used white basalmic vinegar instead of lemon juice but left this recipe as perfect as wriiten. Thanks so much and my family thanks you too.

Very good.  DH is giving it the 5 stars, I would have to go with 4.  Just seemed to be missing "something"....just not quite sure what.  Overall a very easy dish to make.  I took in some of the leftovers to work and a coworker gave it a 5 also....hence the 5 stars after all.  :()

This was surprisingly good.  I've never made these...never even heard of them, but i ran across the recipe and it had great reviews i decided to try it. I cooked in the crock, tripled the amount of sauce, and added one can of tomato paste to thicken.  I wish i had added some garlic powder to the meat mixture, but  otherwise it was very good.  Being Italian, i questioned the sauce with it being quite plain..but it was excellent.   I had to serve it over *something*, so thankfully I had some leftover brown rice which worked great!

This recipe was good, but not like what I was remembering my grandmother making.  At first bite, it tasted exactly as I remembered, but the more I ate, the sauce just tasted a little "off".  I think it had too much Worcestershire sauce in it.  Like others, I quadrupled the sauce, however, I don't think all the sauce ingredients should be increased proportionally.  I would limit the sugar and the Worcestershire sauce.  Also, it seemed a little bland after a while.  I will probably look for my grandmother's recipe for next time.

Okay I'm really tired of people who rate recipes stating not enought seasoning or too much of something else. I look at recipes as guidelines and adjust to my own taste. I never made cabbage rolls before, but these turned out pretty darn good!  I used italian sausage for meat mixture and sauted my onion. Used one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, doubling the rest of the ingredients for the sauce with the addition of minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Poured a little sauce in my meat mixture befor rolling and topped with the remaining. Used the baking method, and YUM! These were a hit at home as well as at work.

I like the idea of putting the cabbage in the freezer. I always boil the whole head of cabbage. I would suggest cutting out the core of the cabbage first to make it easier to get the leaves apart.  I use tomato juice to cover my cabbage rolls instead of soup or sauce.

This was my first time making any type of cabbage roll. I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce, increased the onion, decreased the pepper, and boiled the entire head of cabbage for 5 minutes. The only thing I will do different next time is to actually triple the sauce and half the meat.

These are delicious cabbage rolls! I added fresh chopped onion to the meat and onion & garlic powder, along with a bit more Worchester sauce. The sauce is wonderful & simple & the only thing I will change next time I make it is to double it.

Yum-O!  I only made one change and that was to add an additional tablespoon of worchestershire sauce and a can of campbells condensed tomatoe soup.  I only added those because I like a lot of sauce on mine.  Excellent recipe.

Super! I steamed the cabbage as some reviewers suggested (10-15 mins) and cooked the cabbage rolls in the oven for an hour instead of the slow cooker. This was the first time ever making cabbage rolls and was very excited! Don't forget to double the sauce!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I'm pregnant and it sounded good so I made it. My 2 yr old son ate 3 rolls! It was easy to make too. I pulled off a few cabbage leaves then decided to cook the whole head in boiling water, it was easier to pull apart. I used a whole onion which is like 1/2 cup & threw in a good healthy pinch of red pepper flakes in the meat mixture. I used exactly 1/4 cup in each leaf and got 13 rolls (I might have had more than 1lb of beef). I did not have tomato sauce so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, sauce was thin but the chunks of tomato and flavors worked well and I followed another reviewer and sprinkled salt over the rolls before the sauce went on and I baked it 350 in the oven for 1 hr covered in foil just like some others.

Great week night meal.  It makes a lot too!  Great way to stretch the buck!  We had this for dinner twice and still had enough left over to bring for lunch.  I didn't use the lemon juice because I didn't have any.  Other than that, followed it exactly and it was very good.  I will double the sauce next time because the recipe as is definitely doesn't make enough.

Made this for my bf who was nostalgic over his mom's cabbage rolls. I am a vegetarian, so I can't rate the taste, although they smelled great and my bf loved them. I used fresh garlic, extra onions and maybe added a little more spice but really followed the recipe almost 100%.

Enjoyed this recipe.  Thought it would be harder to make than it was since it was my first time.  I read other reviews which really helped me.  I added a half lb of italian sausage to the ground beef & also doubled the sauce recipe.  Didn't cook it in the slow cooker...put them in a baking dish, covered them with the extra cabbage leaves & they turned out perfectly.  I will add this to my recipe collection!

The flavor in this dish is pretty good, but I changed the way it was set up. Instead of wasting time rolling up all the cabbage, I just cut up the cabbage, and after I boiled it, I just put it in the bottom of the crockpot, put the meat on top, then the sauce, then some cut bacon.  So it was almost like a casserole, it saved alot of time and trouble, and was still very tasty! HOWEVER, the whole head of cabbage is way, way too much for this method of cooking.  So I removed a majority of the whiter cabbage.

I made these the other night for dinner and loved them. My husband thought they were the best cabbage rolls I have ever made. I did use the freezer method for the cabbage. It worked great and was so easy. Just through the cabbabe in the freezer the night before you are going to make this recipe, the following day take it out and as it starts to thaw, you can peel the leaves right off.

First of all I do not know how to core cabbage so it was really difficult to pull the leaves off in whole pieces to boil.  I ended up piecing the torn pieces together to roll.  Quadrupled the sauce as recommended from one of the other reviews and put it in the crock pot to go.  They came out good, but the filling need a bit more umph for my taste... will definitely try again!

This was a great starting point! I had cabbage sitting in my fridge and I wanted to find something to do with it so when I saw this recipe was for the slow cooker I was sold. I did follow others instructions on freezing the cabbage and that worked great. I used cooked brown rice made in chicken broth and added a tsp of minced garlic to the mix. I didn't have any plain tomato sauce so I used jarred 4 cheese sauce. I also doubled the recipe but I would recomend layering the sauce with the rolls and using extra suace. My whole family had seconds. It is going to be a favorite around my house. Thank you for the great recipe!

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  First.... a crock pot dinner should not take this much work just to get into the crock pot.. The point of a crock pot is to put it in and go. You have to cook for about 30 minutes before you get it into the crock pot... not helpful when you're working. Secondly, it says to cook on low for 6-8 hours. 6 Hours would probably be the best, at 8 hours, you pretty much have sludge to eat.  My family could not figure out what they were eating. I love cabbage, but I won't make this again.

This was good.  I did not salt the meat, and I should have.  With a little salt and pepper right on top, it was great.  We ate the leftovers too. Also very easy. I did double the sauce as suggested in other reviews.

This is a delicious basic recipe for cabbage rolls.  I added garlic & red wine to the meat/rice mixture, & used petite sirloin ground up in my processor. I added some grey poupon mustard to the sauce which I tripled.  Cooked covered with foil in oven at 325 for 90 mins., then lowered heat to 300 for 30 mins. with foil removed.  I agree with other comments that this would serve up well with mashed potatoes. This is real COMFORT FOOD.

I did change to brown rice. After reading reviews I thought I'd try adding carrots, celery and green pepper. It was GREAT and healthy! Thanks for the recipe and the great reviews. This will be made for potlucks where I want a healthy dish.

This recipe was VERY close to the one my mother used when I was a child; I thought it turned out just great.  I baked at 350 for 1 hr and 15 minutes - superb!

This was a very good recipe. My kids of course didn't like it due to its appearance. The sauce was pretty sweet,so if you're looking for something not to sweet reduce brown sugar. I also doubled the sauce, I think I might triple next time. These were alot like a mini meatloaf rapped up in cabbage. Have fun!

I really liked this recipe.  I followed others advice and doubled the sauce.  I misread the recipe and put two tablespoons of worcestershire sauce (instead of two teaspoons) and we loved it.  I tried cooking the cabbage in the microwave per another reviewers suggestion and didn't like the way it turned out so next time I make it I will go back to steaming the cabbage in a pot.  I also baked the rolls at 350 degrees for an hour.  To save time I used Uncle Ben's precooked brown and wild rice that comes in the microwave pouch.  Thanks for the delicious recipe

Made these for my husbands(who said i don't like cabbage at first) St. Patricks Day lunch at work and they loved.  I too, baked in the oven at 350 for one hour.  Due to my husbands high blood pressure and fish allergies I used Ms. Dash table blend for seasoning instead of the salt, pepper and left out the worcestershire sauce. Great recipe! Thanks!

I have made these twice. The first time I reduced the pepper to 3/4 tsp. as recommended by others. It was still too much pepper. If you're going to make them with the black pepper, try 1/2 tsp. The second time I omitted the black pepper completely. Instead, I chopped up one small green pepper. These turned out delicious. The sauce is good just as it is, but I did double it and that was plenty. The cabbage rolls were served with baked potatoes a fruit salad and they were a hit with our family and we don't even like cabbage.

This recipe was great ! Some suggestions by other reviewers need to be followed.I cooked my cabbage rolls in my slow cooker, which tends to run hot , so 6-61/2 hours was plenty of time on low. I doubled the sauce as suggested , but next time will triple it. I added 1 heaping tsp of minced garlic and about 1/2 cup of chopped onion to the filling. I also used a heaping 1/4 cup measure when filling the cabbage which resulted in exactly 12 perfect sized rolls.
My mom made these when we were growing up all the time but, this was my first attempt.
Thanks for a great recipe :)

This was so good-  I followed another posters suggestion of squeezed, rinsed kraut and bacon on top, baked at 350 for 1.5 hours. I did double the sauce and next time will probably quadruple it-  I like sauce. The sauce was really good even though it may seem like a strange concoction. Overall, my husband loved it, I loved it- Thank you!!

Really good recipe! However there is a much simpler way to get the leaves nice and pliable without burning your fingers! Put your cabbage in the freezer and leave it there till the day before you are going to make the cabbage rolls. Take it out and leave it around 24 hours in a colander in the sink. Works great and then the kids can help roll their own!

I had a tough time with this recipe. It did help to freeze the cabbage and let it thaw before taking the leaves apart. And I doubled the recipe for the sauce but I used 3 packets of Equal instead of brown sugar. I followed the suggestion from another review to cook it in the over at 350 for an hour (I don't have a crock pot), but my cabbage still came out tough. It ended up tasting like meatloaf wrapped in cabbage. I don't think I'll be making this again.

These are totally AWESOME!!!! Even better the next day. I made 2 batches of the sauce for 1 batch of rolls and was so glad I did. I will triple the sauce the next time for 1 batch of rolls. I only got 8 rolls out of one recipe, so maybe I made them too big?? I did put 1 fresh onion into my hamburger as I fried it and did not use minced onion.

I think these are perfect w/ only minor adjustments.  Increase the sauce (if you like it saucy, like I do) & add soft bread crumbs to the meat mixture.  Otherwise, don't change a thing.  DELICIOUS!!  A very traditional cabbage roll!

I was looking for a meat dish to take to a pot luck and thought this would be a good choice because it is cooked in a crockpot.  I had never made cabbage rolls before but found that this recipe is very easy.  The only thing I would add is to boil the entire head of cabbage after carefully cutting out the center stump.  It made removing the individual leaves easier. The sauce was good, but I might want to double the sauce next time, if I wanted a lot of sauce.  The meat was delicious, and most of my family just ate the meat mixture inside after taking it out of the cabbage leaves (you know kids).  Over all, I would make this again because I myself loved it.   The only reason I gave it a 4-star is because it has been years since I have tasted any other cabbage roll recipe and I have nothing to campare it to as to being the BEST.

This was the first time I ever made cabbage rolls and I was surpised at how easy it was.  These tasted good, the filling was good, but I thought the sauce was a little too sweet.  Everyone else liked them a lot.  I think it may have just been me!  I'm going to try these again but tweak it a little.  Great recipe overall though.

How can you not give cabbage rolls 5 stars?  This is almost exactly like the recipe I always use. For some variation, instead of plain cabbage leaves try sour cabbage wrapped with bacon, or grape leaves canned usually in a jar-from your local italian grocer (gives a very different flavor than  the typical recipe but amazing)!

This is the first time I've made cabbage rolls.  My cabbage was a little tough around the thicker part, not sure why.  The meat mixture was a little bland for our taste but it was still a good dish.  Thanks for submitting your recipe!!!

Okay, easy. I used a precooked brown rice from Trader Joe's as well all organic and fresh produce and homemade stewed tomotatoes in place of tomato sauce. Added some extra seasonuing to the beef mixture as it was a little bland

Yum - I used prego tomato sauce w/a little worchestire sauce and beef broth.  I rolled uncooked beef/rice into cabbage and placed it in the crock pot - I set it on 6hours and viola... it was ready.

I love this recipe, The first time I made it exact.  This time I made small variations.  I didn't use a slow cooker, roaster and oven instead.  I added a pinch of cinnion to the meat and for the sauce I added extra sauce and used the stuff with herbs and spices already added.  The meat turned out nice and moist, not at all dry and the sauce tasted great.  I will recommend to all my frinds.  Thanks for the great recipe. :)

I really want to give this a 4 1/2 star. These were great, but I will do some slight personal adjustments. First off if being done in the slow cooker the ones on the bottom will be more likely to fall apart then the ones on top. I might suggest a little less pepper too! Aside from this we loved them.

I made these, I accidently used double the rice but it as still good.  I also added a can of tomato soup in with the mix.  I also added garlic, though next time I will leave it off.

I don't care for cabbage but these were wonderful.  Even my 5 year old loved them.  I made them again for work and everyone raved about them.  I will definately keep this recipe around.

Turned out well but a lot of work.  Will probably make again but only if we have the time set aside.

Where is the egg or what holds this meat together?  Not a success for me.  Maybe I missed a step.

this recipe was okay. i followed other people's suggestions and added lots more seasoning. though i found for the time to make this i didn't think it was worth the trouble. my boyfriend is slovak and his mother's cabbage rolls are unbelieveble. this was just okay.

I thought this was just OK, but my kids (three years old) gobbled this up.  I added Heinz 57 to mine and it was better.  (I like things spicy, though)

These are just like my grandma used to make when I was a little girl.  I followed others advice and boiled the head of cabbage whole.  This kept my leaves from falling apart.  I also put extra salt, onions, garlic and added green peppers to the meat mix.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I pureed canned diced tomatoes and I was pleased with the result.  The pureed tomato mix was chunky enough so it didn't all fall off my cabbage rolls while baking.  These were the best I've ever had!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I took the filling recipe and used it, but I bake mine in the oven with tomato soup over it until it is bubbly. I am Polish and my grandpa used to make this at least once a week at my request. These tasted just like his. The are slightly time-consuming, but the end result is sooo worth it. Thank you. :)

I followed the advise of others and used more tomatoe sauce.  If you don't like spicy don't add all the pepper. It was excellent.

I should have read the reviews before I cooked this.  Did anyone else notice that 1 1/4 tsp PEPPER is way too much?  Too spicy hot to eat.  I will try it again sometime with 1/4 tsp pepper.

Very good!I added some diced tomatoes with green chiles (for a little more spice) and added garlic powder and a tad bit of mustard powder to the beef misture. I used minute rice to save time. I baked it at 350 for 1hr. My husband doesn't like cabbage but he ate the meat and thought it was very good. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was missing something.  I took the advice of quadrupling the sauce and also mixing in an onion soup mix into the ground beef when browning.  I also added galic powder for more flavor.  I even steamed the head of cabbage for an easier time with the leaves.  I'm not sure what happened but it didn't go too well with my family.  The meat filling was great - perhaps it was the sauce all together.

These are really excellent and almost exactly like what my mom used to make for me as a kid.  The only thing different that she did was to use a V8 juice to blanch the cabage in.  It give it a lot of flavor, and you don't have to cook it in a slow cooker for hours, you can just bake them in the sauce like in this recipe, or you can even steam them with the V8 juice.  Delicious!

Great slow cooker recipe!  I prepared mine the night before to give them the "next day flavor" when cooked.  Steamed head of cabbage before peeling.  I used ground turkey & also a pinch of nutmeg & 2 tbsp. of the tomato sauce in the meat mixture (no onion for me!).  I made the sauce x 4 with tomato puree (for consistency).  Sorry, but this is not an Italian sauce/recipe & needs no basil & oregano!!!  These rolls freeze very well.  So yummy, thanks!

Considering I've never had a cabbage roll before in my life, I thought these were o.k.  My husband seemed to like them a lot so I will probably make them again in the future but I will follow others' suggestions and double the sauce.  Also, I bought a small head of cabbage which made it really tough to remove the leaves.  I would buy a larger one next time.

Great! Will double the sauce next time and the whole recipe so we can have more leftovers! The filling could be more falvorful - next time I'm adding an extra can of tomato sauce to the filling mixture.

All I can say is YUM! This is a great recipe.  The sauce is absolutely delicious with the cabbage rolls.  I doubled the sauce, but next time I will make more so that the rolls are nice and covered.  A definite keeper.

These were good. When I told my boyfriend what was for dinner, he was like "eeww" but when we ate, he had seconds! I doubled the sauce and added less than half to the meat. I will make this again!

This recipe was great!  I baked in the over versus the slow cooker.  My husband didn't think there was enough "kick" to it, so we ended up adding some red pepper to the recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  This was my first attempt at trying to make cabbage rolls and these turned out fantastic.  I boiled my cabbage for a few mins. before I put in the meat mxture.  I was able to  peal off the leaves without them ripping.  As per the other suggestions, I doubled the sauce so it would cover the rolls in the cooker.  I will be making this again very soon.  In fact, my husband asked if we could have it again the next night!

I didn't realize I was out of tomato sauce and used condensed tomato soup instead.  Plus I double the sauce mix per other reviewers suggestions.  They turned out great and even my husband who turns his nose up at the thought of cabbage went back for more!

I used ground turkey,brown rice, added parsley and let meat mixture sit over 
night. I thought rice was too overdone, but hubby said it was great, and he doesn't
even like cabbage rolls. Doubled sauce too, made the house smell fantastic. Thanks for
sharing.

I loved this dish.  I thought it was very authentic tasting.  The meat mixture needs a little more seasoning than listed in the ingredients. My children and husband did not like it.  That was okay, I have been enjoying the leftovers.

I quadrupled the sauce recipe just to make sure there would be enough of it. There was. My husband liked these. I am just not a cabbage roll fan. I ate one but didn't really care for it. They were fairly easy to make. The sauce tasted pretty good.

This is wonderful recipe and one that I will most definately use for potlucks. This was too easy.  Great for using up left over rice.  I prefer my sauce a little less tangy and will use garlic and basil next time.

These cabbage rolls were a hit with my family.  I didn't care for them very much, but the rest of the family ate them all up and can't wait to have it again.

I sort of made this my own but we really enjoyed this dish! Trying to keep with the recipe, I used 1/2 lb Beyond Meat for the ground meat, cooked wild rice for the white rice and kept the sauce amounts as originally called for....adding garlic powder to the meat mixture per reviews. I also used a suggestion of adding a layer of drained sauerkraut to the top which was fantastic! Baked in the oven covered at 350* for an hour then uncovered for another thirty minutes. Made 7 cabbage rolls, served with garlic-horseradish mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. WOW! thank you!

Really juicy making this in the slow cooker. Not dry at all.  I added cabbage leaves to the bottom of the batch, in-between the cabbage rolls and on top.

I made per instructions but added a little garlic powder and paprika to the meat.  I think next time I would use 16oz of tomato sauce.  We like sauce! Very god.  I think my husband ate 4 of them.  Also was easy to make.

I might have gone a little heavier on the onions, and instead of using a crock pot, I used my Pressure Cooker, cooking for 60 minutes.  This recipe is an absolute winner in our home!

Cabbage rolls can be on the tame side of taste, and this recipe carries on the tradition. Could use more salt and more tomato sauce. Oh, and more taste.

I made this like the recipe stated just added some garlic and I baked it @325 for around 45 minutes until a least 165 degrees. I put some of the extra leafs on top so it wouldn’t dry out.  It turned out great. I’ll be making this again Thanks for the recipe

The recipe is fine, other than your suggestion to use extra lean ground beef. Cabbage rolls is not a diet food, and the fat [and flavor] is an essential component of the dish.

Loved this recipe. But, adding garlic and a third cup of tomato juice to the sauce mixture is what made it really pop for me. The sauce itself and that much brown sugar is a little too sweet and acidic for my tastes.

Yummy and easy. Perfect with no change. Second time I did add half pound hamburger; half pound pork sausage instead of one pound of hamburger, red pepper flakes along with garlic powder. Double the sauce is great advice. Keeper recipe for sure:)

Followed the recipe and it came out really well.  Cabbage leaves got a little dark as they were not covered totally by the sauce which I will increase next time.
It's a keeper.

boiled the whole cabbage and peeled off the leaves. Also, used brown rice and didn't even notice the difference. Double the sauce and baked for 1.5hrs at 350. Turned out perfect!

I found the meat mixture did not have enough seasoning for me. i will use this as my base and add my own seasonings next time. i also found the sauce more on the sweet instead of savory side, so i will change that as well. recipe not bad but for me tweeks are necessary.

This recipe is good, easy-to-make and healthy.  If you have never made stuffed cabbage before, I recommend starting  with this recipe for your first time.  Then modify it to your taste each time thereafter.

For myself, I found the meat to be drier than I prefer.  So I switched to 80/20 ground beef and used uncooked rice which absorbed the juice.  You can also use a ground beef/ground pork combination for even more flavor.  I reduced the pepper to 1/2 tsp instead of 1 1/4 tsp.  There wasn't enough sauce to cover all the cabbage rolls in the CrockPot.  So I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce.  It was the perfect amt the second time around.

I used uncooked quinoa but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  I had never used hamburger this way in a slow cooker and it turned out  great - nice flavor and texture. Will do this recipe again.

Added a half pound of sausage and some garlic powder along with a little Italian seasoning and extra tomato sauce. Think even more tomato sauce would be better. Added four ounces more this time. 
Generally yummy and will make again.

I would definitely make this again.  I will use more cabbage next time - it adds to the juiciness.  I will also add more sauce.  My family loves this recipe.

I thought this recipe was delish! Even my husband, who is a Southern Chinese and usually finds my western food disgusting, ate it up and asked for more. 

I would say you def need to double the sauce and topped with bacon in the crock pot.  I believe the bacon added a delightful smoky flavor.

I cut the cabbage at the stem and peeled off and boiled only the leaves I was going to use, there was enough meat mixture to make a little more than 12, I also tripled the sauce, it turned out great and seemed to taste even better as left overs .

I actually did not like these at all. I did them in the slowcooker but it almost tasted as if the tomato sauce that was on top had burnt. I did add extra per other reviews but I also see that alot of those people cooked them in the oven and not slowcooker. will try oven next time.

Decent recipe but it won't make enough sauce. I tripled it and it was barely enough... I would search for better cabbage rolls recipes out there, this one is very average.

I have always loved cabbage rolls, but never made them.  I did what others said to do in their reviews, doubled the sauce and also added petite diced tomatoes.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I was sure that my husband was going to say that he did not care for it, but he actually loved it.  Now, he normally does not eat left overs, but ate more cabbage rolls for lunch the next day.  This is a winner.

I made the healthy version, with ground turkey and brown rice. I added extra veggies to the meat (shredded carrot and diced celery), followed other reviews' suggestions to double the tomato sauce, and baked at 350F for 1.5 hours. They came out so good!

I've long wanted to recreate this family favorite that my Polish Grandmother used to prepare, but unfortunately never wrote down.  After considering all of the suggestions and testing more than a few, I settled on the following, which produced a dish that closely mirrored that which I remembered and received a unanimous thumbs-up from the family! (My apologies to those from whom I borrowed ideas without proper credit.) 

#1 Instead of boiling peeled leaves, I recommend that you, “Get a very large pot of water and bring up to a small boil; as you're waiting for the water to boil core the cabbage head with a fairly wide margin at the top and take off the outer leaves that are dirty. Once the water is hot, place the cabbage head into the boiling water. Once the outside leaves start to separate from the head, remove to a dish or bowl and check that the stem area is soft and pliable. Depending on the cabbage, you may need to help the peeling process along. “

#2 I cooked the rice in water with 2 beef bouillon cubes added to it. (don't add extra salt to the meat mixture though.) To the meat, I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and increased the onion to a whole medium. (My family are big onion fans.)  This increase turned out well and didn't overwhelm.

#3 I replaced the 8 ounces of tomato sauce with two 29-ounce cans of No Salt Added, Crushed Tomatoes and doubled the remainder of the sauce ingredients.

These were delicious! I listened to another reviewer and did half sausage/half lean ground beef and would do this again! We were able to double the batch using a full head of cabbage, so that was perfect. Honestly, I doubled the sauce, like a lot of people were suggesting, and this seemed like a waste. There was way too much sauce this way and we ended up throwing most of it away after dinner.

I made this but used many of the helpful tips from subscribers; made more sauce, used a combination of tomato soup and tomato sauce, added some of the tomato soup to the meat mixture.  Also sauteed onions before putting into the dish and also used some ground pork.  I appreciate the guidance from this recipe and other subscribers.  The dish was pretty good and hubby appreciated the effort.

Delish...double the sauce and boil the whole cabbage head and remove leaves as they soften.  The freezer method makes tough cabbage...not pleasant.

I followed to recipe but I add seasoning and minced onion and a dash of garlic while I cooked the ground beef  to add more flavor to the beef I will make this again. I made enough for two meals and froze it and the sauces I will be cooking this in the oven at 350 like one review said instead of the crock pot.

Very very yummy! Will be making this again sometime soon. I made just a small adjustment and doubled the amount of sauce/brown sugar/lemon juice. Had enough sauce to pour over some boiled potatoes to go with the cabbage rolls. Delicious! Thank you!

I did not use lemon. I doubled the sauce. By using one can of tomato sauce and 8oz of marinara because I did not have any more tomato sauce. I sprayed my Crock-Pot with cooking spray. Then ladled one scoop of sauce on the bottom it did not stick. Everyone loved it my neighbors , my boyfriend and my son and I. I'll definitely make it again. 
The sauce did not taste good when trying it before it was cooked, I was worried. But after cooking it was delicious.

Followed recipe even though I thought there wasn't enough liquid, and I was right.   Tasted like it was missing something and it was dry.

This was fantastic! The only change I made was to QUADRUPLE the sauce (as other commenters recommended).  My husband always complains stuffed cabbage is too bland, but this one isn't. He loved it!

My husband really liked these cabbage rolls.  I quadrupled the sauce as the other reviews noted.   I revised the sauce slightly by adding 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce & a little onion powder.  I also added some granulated garlic to the hamburger & rice mixture.  Next time,  I'll add some chopped parsley to the meat mixture for some color.  I made an extra pan of rolls for my freezer.  Thanks for the recipe.

I put the cabbage in the freezer and then thawed it the next day. The leaves are pliable. I used uncooked minute rice and placed the rolls in the crock pot. Turned out great!

I followed the advice of others. I steamed the whole cabbage head and pulled the leaves off. I added 3-4 shakes of garlic powder to the meat mixture. I doubled the sauce recipe then added a large can of diced tomatoes. I thought I had onion but it turns out I only had shallots and I really didn't want to go back to the store but it was still very good. My husband was surprised at how much he liked it!

Taste every bit as wonderful as my Hungarian friend's. She did always shred the cabbage, however, and place the cabbage rolls on top of the cabbage for an extra treat.

It was kind of soupy from being cooked in a slow  cooker.  I will use this recipe again, but I will adjust it to bake in the oven instead.  In order to bake it in the oven, the sauce will have to be 
 doubled as the oven will cook the sauce down more than a crock pot.  

The sauce was good as was the filling.

Being of Polish descent, I found these (golumki's!) to be very good. Putting the cabbage head in gently simmering hot water for 5-6 min helped to easily remove the leaves, 3-4 at time.  Then place cabbage back in water and repeat. I baked them in the oven at 350degF for about 1 hr 10 min, lining a 13x9 pan with cabbage leaves (outer and inner). After pouring the sauce over them,  I also topped them with more cabbage leaves, then covered with foil. I would double the sauce the next time and would use very lean beef, as the excess fat accumulates in the pan. I cut way back on the pepper (seemed like a lot) and added a little garlic and onion powder to beef. Very good now, but they're  always better later. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as written and everyone loved it. I have since modified it to better fit my family's tastes. Also, i remove the core of the cabbage and boil the head (core side down) for ten minutes for easy removel of leaves, keeping the pot going to continue with a few minutes of boiling as needed to loosen more leaves. Easy! Thanks for this easy and delicious base recipe.

It’s a very good recipe, but I agree with some of the reviews it needs a little extra. I added garlic and salt to blanch the entire cabbage head and peeled the leaves off and placed them in a colander. I also added more seasoning to the meat mixture, smoked paprika, a pinch of chipotle powder to bring a little heat to the filling. Plus a little red wine to build a deeper flavor profile, no more than a splash.

It was very good. I cooked them in the oven. Cabbage is not too fresh at this time of the year. The leaves are not as green as earlier this Fall.

Try it you will like it.

This was good! I was concerned about it being bland but it wasn't at all. I used 3 cans of tomato sauce. I added minced garlic to the filling. I did use a lot more onion than called for, just because i already had them diced. Next time I'll freeze extras.

We enjoyed it and my husband doesn't even like cabbage!
I like that it's so easy to cook in the crockpot.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it was a little bland.  Maybe I'll add garlic or more salt for flavor.

I liked recipe the old way I did them. Brown hamburg first and mix in a good homemade spegetti sauce and cooked rice instead of milk and egg mixture. Baked in oven for hour.

I made a couple of changes and some mistakes with this recipe.  First, I thought it would be easy to remove cabbage leaves.  It's not.  I got some whole leaves but a lot of lesser pieces.  So, I ended up with more of a "cabbage roll stew" than individual cabbage rolls.  After it was too late, I found videos on You Tube showing how to easily remove leaves.  Take note.  My first change was I substituted riced Cauliflower for the rice to reduce the carbs.  Second change, when I went to use Worcestershire sauce, I couldn't get the cap off the bottle, so I substituted steak sauce.  Oh well.  I honestly haven't tasted the results yet, still cooking, but I'm hoping for the best.  If it turns out ok and I want to make it again, I'll try to do it right.

Good for lowering calorie intake.   The rolls were a bit bland for us but I did cut the pepper to about half so that might have been why.  I just thought it seemed like a lot of pepper.  But flavor could be enhanced by adding more onion, garlic and your favorite herbs and/or spices to taste without significantly changing the caloric value.   I did double the sauce and added about a fourth cup to the meat mixture, pouring the rest over the finished rolls.  They were not dry at all.  My hubby had never had cabbage rolls and sprinkled one with a little Parmaesan and one with his favorite hot sauce.  He preferred the hot sauce and bonus, it didn't add any calories.  We both enjoyed the dish and will be having it again.

Excellent!  I doubled the sauce batch, but don't know if it wouldn't need anyway.  Could even use 2 or 3 extra cabbage leaves.  Pepper might even been too much.

I read other reviews here and I added extra tomato soup. I had an Italian style tomato soup and I didn't have onion salt, so I added extra garlic salt and chopped onion. I was afraid they might fall apart in the crock pot, but they didn't and turned out perfect. I never liked stuffed cabbage before to be honest, but my husband requested the dish, so I tried this and I have to say it was absolutely delicious!

I've made these before and they're yummy,however, preparing them this morning (half asleep), I accidentally combined ALL the ingredients in with the meat. It's in the crock pot for now. Hoping it's still edible :(. Anyone else do this before? :)

Very good filling and the sauce is awesome, though you do have to double it to have enough to keep things moist. I was disappointed in the cabbage itself... for some reason it did not become tender.  If anyone has advice on that part please message me.

Loved it! I made this for St. Paddy's Day. We're vegetarians so I made it with Trader Joe's Beefless Ground Meat (made w/ wheat & soy) and it was SO GOOD! You'd definitely would need to triple or quadruple the sauce mix though. I mixed some sauce into the meat mixture to give it more flavoring.

Made this recipe as written. The only change I will make for next time is to double the sauce ingredients. Didn't feel that it had enough for my liking. I also only made 6 rolls since my cabbage leaves were huge and I had to double the amount that I stuffed them.

I really struggled to get the cabbage leaves off to use as wraps... so much so that I ended up just chopping up the cabbage & making soup instead - ha!  What I did end up with, though, was very good.  (I added tomatoes with Italian spices) Thanks for the recipe!

For a healthier option, I used ground turkey and white basmati rice. I steamed the entire cabbage for 30 minutes. For those who have problems with dairy I used the Lactid 2% milk.   I added 50% more rice. I doubled the tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Instead of regular salt and ground pepper I added paprika, Bosari salt (you can get at Whole Foods), and cayenne pepper to both the meat mixture and the sauce. I put just a dash of Bosari salt in the sauce. I added garlic powder to the meat only. I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour. My husband and I loved it. I made a total of 14 cabbage rolls.

I did change the ingredients to the ones I have used over the past 45 years;  however, I have never used a slow cooker to cook them.  What a difference not to have the oven on.  The cabbage rolls came out beautifully.  I will be using this method in the future.

Made this in a 5 quart oval cooker. Did need double sauce due to the cooker size. Worked out terrific, will definitely make it again!

These were pretty good although I wasn't as wowed by them as other reviewers seem to be.  The instructions were good, and they were easy to make.  I make 1.5 times the sauce but would double it at least next time (maybe triple).   We also found them to be lacking in salt - I would do at least 2 tsp in the meat next time, maybe  more.

This was delicious!  I made the full recipe for just my husband and I and we ate this for lunch and dinner for the next 2 days and still didn't get tired of it.  I only made a small change and added more tomato sauce and a small can of V8.

Excellent!  Working with cabbage was a bit tricky, but by steaming the cabbage head, it was easier to get the leaves off without ripping them.  I used venison burger, which is leaner, & I browned it to reduce the slow cooker time significantly.  I added minced garlic with the onions & also made 4x the sauce.  Was fantastic!  Have already shared the recipe with others

Good but I've had better.  Mine definitely didn't look as nice as the picture once they finished cooking.  Willing to give it another try; maybe I won't cook it as long next time.

I quadrupled the meat and used half ground pork, half lean ground beef.  I added minced garlic and thyme to the meat mixture.  I used 2 large heads of cabbage which I cored and put the whole head in boiling water. (You just peel the leaves as it cooks)  I got 36 rolls total.  I froze enough for two more meals.  The day I make them I cook them  in the oven 325  for 11/2 hours covered and 30 min uncovered.  The frozen ones go in the slowcooker all day on a workday.  I just use spaghetti sauce because its easy for the work nights but the sauce would not be hard.

This recipe is really good, I have made cabbage rolls in the past but they were a little different, the brown sugar does it in this one.  I also made these in my power pressure cooker and they are fantastic.

I made this for Super Bowl yesterday and took to a friends house.  They turned out really good, however, next time I make them, I will add some garlic and some spices to the meat mixture and triple the sauce.  I put some plastic wrap over the cabbage and microwaved for 6 mins (large head of cabbage), it was so easy.  The leftover cabbage I stuffed in between the rolls in the pan.  Delish, thanks

Made this in small roasting pan, covered, in 300 degree oven for about six hours yesterday. Basted with water a few times throughout day. Turned out awesome. You can definitely do these without a slow cooker if you don't have the full 9 hours.  Great recipe. Took to a dinner and everyone loved them. 
Tip: To get your cabbage leaves to release from the head turn with tongs in simmering water and peel leaves off as they go limp. This also eliminates the need to boil the leaves for the two minutes!

We like things a little zippy around here so I used 1/2 hot italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef.  I also used spicy pasta sauce as the base and put everything else in from there. It was awesome and my family gobbled it up!

Cooked as is and was terrible! Absolutely inedible. Cooking time was way too long and the recipe calls for way too much pepper. One more thing. If you have to change everything about a recipe to make it worthwhile you should not be rating it four or five stars. IT COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF A RATING SYSTEM! Very misleading and disappointing.

My husband and  I both loved these "cabbage fillings" as his mom used to call them.  She was a wonderful cook and we hadn't had any of these since her passing years ago.  What a treat to put them on our plates, cut them open and have them be exactly what we were hungry for!!  My crock pot is a large one, so the only change I made was to use a bit more hamburger, a bit more of the rice and other ingredients; then I doubled the tomato sauce recipe that gets poured over the cabbage rolls once they are in the crock pot. There were fourteen of them and they were gone in two days!!

My mom was German and my dad was Polish/Ukrainian. I grew up on cabbage rolls. I love this recipe. It was a hit at Christmas and New Years. Great card playing fare. I used St. Jacobs sour cabbage(fermented
). The flavour was outstanding.  I cook mine in the over at 325 ,low and slow for a couple of hours..I like my cabbage cooked well. I found the Sour Cabbage cooked up nice and soft .

I used equal parts of smoked bacon, breakfast sausage, and ground beef. Out of this world! I also tried a tip I heard, freeze the cabbage first, then once thawed, the leaves were very easy to roll. Didnt keep burning my fingers.

I used half pork and half beef.  I really loved the zesty tomato sauce.  To prepare the cabbage I corred it and boiled it for 10 minutes.  this was enough to soften the leaves but some of the inner ones were still too crispy to roll.  I would probably boil it a bit longer next time, or try the method one other reader used pulling the leaves off as they come away from the core.

I cored and steamed the cabbage for about 15 minutes.  It made it very easy to pull the cabbage leaves apart.  I also cooked the cabbage rolls in the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hour.

Of course I made some changes. The cooks who did not like it did not adjust it to their families tastes. For Heavens sake, you know what you like! Add it!! To complain without trying seems kind of narrow minded to me.  I adjusted it with some pork sausage and hot peppers. Some extra garlic and a bell pepper. Adding some Asian seasoning and it was great. So it wasn't German, it was still very tasty!! Even cabbage rolls in Germany are sometimes a bit bland...

This was really delicious. I mixed lean ground beef with ground Italian sausage. I also steamed the cabbage the night before and wrapped in paper towel and plastic bag which went in frig overnight. Easier to handle cold to make the cabbage rolls next morning and put in slow cooker. This was really easy and we will make again. I would add more tomato sauce or some liquid next time to make it the 8 hour slow cook time.

I have made these as written and give them 3 stars. My family and friends like my old recipe better and I get rave reviews. I mix the hamburger ingredients pretty much as written also but use 2 pounds. I change the sauce. Sounds cray but I use 2 cans of tomato soup, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 small can of sauerkraut with juice squeezed out and 3 ginger snap cookies crushed. Simple and taste great.

I only gave this 4 stars since my husband and son didn't like it.  However, I thought it was delicious!  The only modification I made was to double the sauce.

I also boiled the whole cabbage head in salt water with half a cup white vinegar and salt. that gives the cabbage the pickled taste. in eastern Europe for cabbage rolls we use pickled cabbage. I cook the rice and I cook the meat first too, then mix it together with rice. trust me, it's much better. I put in a deep dish and bake it in the oven covered for an hour. nothing like it!

Very happy with the end result.  Based on suggestions, I tripled the sauce recipe. To me, the meat-to-rice ratio seemed high, so I will likely double the rice next time.  Made 13 rolls.

I made this recipe, and made enough to freeze for later. I followed other  recommendations, added minced garlic to the meat mixture, quadrupled the sauce. It was still very bland! So I decided to use what I had made, and make it work. When I pulled the first freezer meal out, I added ALOT of caraway seed to the top, and alot of pepper, as I'd backed off on the pepper after reading the reviews. My favorite saurkraut has caraway seeds in it, so I knew I'd enjoy it. I then stuck it in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes, as I too didn't use the crockpot. At the half hour mark, the aroma was starting to get everyone interested. When done, they were awesome! What should have made two meals was gobbled up.

I thought it was ok. In all fairness, I did tweek it subsituting the rice for small bites of potatoes and carrots as my mexican mother  had made for me growing up. I added garlic powder and cumin to the meat. To the sauce I added a small can of El Pato hot sauce.  It was still not as good as my mother's, but it was decent.

I have made these twice and was pleasantly surprised to find a) I like cabbage rolls (didn't know that prior to these), 2) they weren't too hard to make & 3) not overly time consuming given the outcome.  First time I didn't alter the recipe but  2nd time used ground turkey (93%) & 1/2 stick of andouille sausage -- I think I liked the turkey/sausage best while my husband liked the straight beef.  Will be making probably weekly for the rest of the winter.

I boiled the entire cabbage for a good 5 minutes before I started peeling off the leaves as someone suggested.  I also used a 32-ounce can of crushed tomatoes and a 32-ounce can of diced tomatoes to ensure lots of sauce.  They were both "garlic and roasted pepper" flavored.  I  put sauce on each leaf before stuffing and baked at 350 degrees for one hour and fifteen minutes.  My husband said this was his favorite thing I had ever cooked!

I made these using ground turkey instead of beef. I cut back on the salt and should've done the same for the pepper, it was a little too much for my taste. I also only cooked them in the crockpot for about 6 hours on low and that was plenty of time for them to cook and absorb the sauce.

Used ground turkey and baked in oven instead of slow cooker as quite a few reviewers recommended.  However, otherwise made as stated. Was a very good recipe.  Would definitely  make again.  Put in recipe book!

Added 1 can (28oz)of crushed tomatoes and 1 can 15 oz of diced fire roasted tomatoes.  So glad I added extra sauce after reading other reviews. It was delicious and we ate it for 2 nights in a row because it was great!  I will make this again!!

My husband was not a real fan, but my son and daughter-in-law loved it.  I like it and will make it again, but I will probably play with the recipe a little more.  I did use a few suggestions of other reviewers.  I doubled the sauce and used half ground beef and half spicy sausage.  I also used the extra meat mixture and left over cabbage by putting it in the pan first then the rolls on top and the sauce on top of that.  Definitely a keeper, thank you so much for sharing.

My family LOVED this recipe. I did make changes; the sauce was doubled and I gave up on the rolling and chopped the cabbage, so it was more like a cabbage casserole. No wrestling the roll around the plate, just nom nom nom.

I made it for the first time and it turned out perfectly!  I followed the directions carefully except I had a hard time getting some of the smaller cabbage leaves off the head, so I ended up rolling them into something like balls.  After about an hour in the crockpot my office was smelling wonderful (yes, I took my crockpot to the office because I was taking dinner to my elderly parents after work).  I knew that this would be either the best thing I ever made in a crockpot or the greatest disappointment.  It was by far the best!  The first thing my co-worked asked this morning was how it turned out, and they both want the recipe!  I will be making this on a regular basis.

I followed this recipe as written except for adding parsley flakes, garlic powder, and extra tomato sauce, and prepared it the night before, then put it in the refrigerator.   Added the cabbage rolls to the crock pot the next morning, and poured the sauce over all.   (I do think the cooking time in the crock pot could have been reduced to 7-8 hours instead of 8-9 hours, though.)   Very tasty.   My husband absolutely loved it and so did I!    This recipe is definitely a "keeper".   Thanks!

I think this recipe was great but it was missing dill, dill and more dill!! Also as another person said, layer some strips of bacon over them for even  more  flavor.

Easy to make and delicious.  Only change I made was substituting minced garlic for onion.  Hubby loved it!  Oh, I did double the sauce as other reviewers recommended.

Outstanding. The wife loved them.  I recommend you look through the reviews for some helpful suggestions. I  nuked the cored head of cabbage for 6-7 minutes. Great results. I used 1# venison burger which is very lean along with about 4 oz. of ground pork sausage. Since I baked my rolls in the oven in a foil-covered cake pan for 1 and a half hours at 350 it was necessary to double up on the sauce due to the large surface area.. I Zip-locked the leftovers in 2-roll portions with sauce and froze them for future quick lunches. I sprayed the pan with Pam making clean-up simple.

This recipe I and my husband loved---The next time (I will make this again!) I'll triple the sauce! As good as it was (I'd doubled the sauce my first time), it definitely needs more sauce. I'll still give it 5 stars!

I used the "freeze the head of cabbage" technique and when defrosted the leaves were perfectly wilted.  I doubled the sauce and shredded any extra cabbage and put in the bottom of the slow cooker.  Made the 12 cabbage rolls and poured all the sauce over.  Nice to have extra sauce and cabbage to serve on the side.  Also a spoon of sour cream on top makes them even better!

I used half ground pork and half ground turkey since I don't eat beef. Also spiced it up a bit by adding a canned Chipotle pepper and some of its sauce.  I also added some tomato paste and extra tomato sauce.

We really enjoyed these cabbage rolls. 
They are very different from the ones my mom made. My head of cabbage gave me 24 leaves so I had to double the meat mixture and made the sauce with 2-28oz cans of tomato sauce,1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup of lemon juice and 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce. I also cooked them on the stove for about 3 hours.

This recipe is very easy to make and is quite tasty! My husband added some hot sauce to his  I added salt and pepper, but those were the only modifications. If you can get past the appearance and the smell, you will enjoy these :)

I used lemon juice from a container of preserved lemons; it gave it a nice spicy finish. Next time, less sugar and add raisins. Also need to make more sauce with an additional can of diced tomatoes.

I admittedly messed up the recipe, but  I made adjustments to recover.  In short I mixed milk and egg into the sauce instead of the meat.  But everyone enjoyed it, and I would definitely make this again.

Some points: 
1) I think the black pepper was a bit overpowering. 
2) There is not enough sauce in the recipe.  I ended up doubling the sauce amount, and it  was about right, perhaps a bit much, though.
3) I used extremely lean ground beef of 90% lean.  It did not release enough liquid to help steam the rolls.  I would use ground beef of 80% or 85% lean next time.

This was  very good and easy.  However  I  steam the cabbage to soften the leaves.   I tried the hint about putting the cabbage in the freezer once, and it was like rubber. We couldn't even chew it . So, that method did  not work for me.

Delicious. I would recommend using Savoy cabbage, as it is softer and absorbs more flavor. Easier to handle, as well. I added cooked bacon to my beef mixture, and that brings it to another level.

I use a mixture of sausage and ground beef and add diced bell peppers and onion, uncooked rice and a can of Campbell's tomato soup.  Also, if you want a never-fail sauce, try covering your rolls in Hot and Spicy V-8 juice.  As it cooks, it thickens and makes an easy, perfectly seasoned, delicious sauce!  I add the V-8 as needed to keep them moist and also, cover the rolls with any unused cabbage that I've shredded.

I was looking for an easy slow cooker recipe and came across this one. I was skeptical that my family would like it and they all loved it so much we had no leftovers! The hardest part of this recipe was separating the cabbage leaves from the head. After about the fourth torn leaf, I cut around the stem and put the whole head (stem side down) in the pot of boiling water for 4 minutes. Under cold running water the leaves slipped right off and I was back in business. Although it doesn't look like much sauce, don't double it! The slow cooker will thin out the sauce as it steams making more than enough sauce to spoon over the finished dish. I added a couple cloves of chopped garlic to the beef mixture and used instant rice (otherwise the prep time would be more than 1/2 hour!) Cooked to perfection and very tasty! Definitely making again.

Made this, but omitted the brown sugar (I am diabetic).  I enjoyed it, but it needed more flavor. The next time I added a small can of sauerkraut sprinkled over the rolls, sliced up some kielbasa on top, and the flavor was perfect.

My husband loved these.  I thought they were okay.  I used half Italian sausage and half spicy hot.  They had a great flavor.  I froze the cabbage overnight and the leaves came off easy after it defrosted.  I did have a hard time rolling them so next time I need to watch a video lol.  You do need to double the sauce.

I have made this several times, the first I followed recipe exactly & it was very good.  I got the bright idea to change up the meat so I added an 8 ounce can tomato sauce to the extra lean ground beef, a pkg. of onion soup mix, 1/3 Cup of shredded italian cheese, the worchestershire sauce and black pepper.  I add no salt as the soup mix is salty.  Then proceed with cabbage as others have stated.  I place the rolls in my slow cooker seam down.  I pour 3 cups of spicy V8 juice over all & cook for 3-4 hours on high.  Delicious!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I added an extra can of tomato sauce and then just before I served it I put a little bit of tangy catch up on the top there's just not enough zest in it to me without the extra flavor.

I made this using Chinese cabbage .  I pretty much followed directions. I've also used ground turkey which is very nice also. I love my crockpot but I prefer this baked in the oven. I pour a good marinara or spaghetti sauce over rolls. Bake it until done and for a final touch I melt mozzarella cheese on top. It's so good!

This is outstanding. I double the recipe to have extra, and the I make four times the amount of sauce. I also put sauerkraut on each one of the cabbage leaves before I put the meat mixture down. I bake them a 350 for one hour with foil on top. Delicious!!!!

These turned out great. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste , so I think I might top the rolls with a little sauerkraut next time. I did add twice the sauce, as some other reviews suggested. I also steamed the entire head of cabbage as others said, and it was much easier to peel the leaves. I didn't have time to try the freezer method.

The filling was good, the sauce was good, but the cabbage was tough and couldn't even chew it enough to dare swallow it.  Don't know what went wrong, but won't be making this again.

I loved this recipe, but I did make a few changes because I felt it needed more spices/herbs, and I think others were right to quadruple the sauce, because I did, and felt like any less sauce would not have been as good.  I added garlic to the onion and sautéed that before adding it to the meat. I also used grass-fed lamb instead of beef, because of the spices I wanted to use in the dish. I added turmeric while sautéing the onion & garlic, as well as parsley, salt & pepper. I added cumin, a dash of cinnamon, & red pepper flakes to give both filling and sauce a little kick. (I thought the sauce tasted too sweet before I added the red pepper flakes) it turned out awesome! Although, next time I make this, I'll add a little corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up a tiny bit. I served it over white rice and topped it with various squash, onions & heirloom carrots, with some 21 season salute!  I love veggies... And it gave the dish more color. Also, a sprinkle of parsley on top. Will definitely be making this again... Healthy and beautiful. (Pretty easy, to boot!)

Like other reviews I also doubled the recipe. ALL OF IT lol I used the left over meat mix and put them into stuff bell peppers ;) I did put 1/2 TSP of Hungarian sweet Paprika. I did make a mistake and put the table spoon of each brown sugar, lemon juice, ETC in the meat mix :/ so I add the remainder to the tomato juice sauce. It turned out Wonderful!! Good recipe thank you for sharing.

Excellent. I've made it to the recipe and found it to be great. Now when I make it I use crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, add washed and drained sauerkraut on top, and for the meat I use 50% ground buffalo and 50% ground pork. What I'd really like to do is inject the rolls with the sauce before cooking, so they'd be more moist, but I haven't got there yet.

MADE A FEW CHANGES: I too boiled the entire head of cabbage. It broke off a lot easier and didn't peel and split! Instead of ground beef I used ground venison (deer). People who cook with it know how lean of a meat it is(more lean than the leanest beef you can find). I also used a garlic and onion tomato sauce. It turned out wonderful! I will be making it again!

Delicious only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the amount of sauce wasn't nearly enough I had to double the sauce and even add some water to the slow cooker during my cooking so it would stay moist.

My husband is not wild about cabbage rolls but really liked these. I loved them. The brown sugar makes it. I took a few suggestions from the reviews, making 4x the sauce, adding 4 cloves of minced garlic to the meat mixture, cooked the rice in beef stock.  I also sliced the remaining cabbage and placed it in the bottom of the pan and added some sliced onion, salt and pepper.  I covered it and baked it in the oven at 350 for about 2 1/2 hours.  Definitely make this again!

Made this exactly as directed. It was good, but not great. I felt like it needed more seasoning. I think next time I will add a little more salt and pepper, and maybe a little garlic to the meat, and increase the brown sugar and the lemon juice in the sauce (or maybe keep the lemon juice the same and add a little cider vinegar). 

I think it was cooked in less than eight hours in the slow cooker. I might try it in the oven next time, because I will make it again, with the tweaks noted. Even my kids liked it, so definitely a keeper!

UPDATE: Almost three years later, I did, in fact, make it again, without realizing I had made it before. I did make it in the oven, as other reviewers suggested, and was very pleased. I steamed my cabbage in my Instant Pot, which made the hardest part of the process, getting usable, pliable leaves, very easy. I also tripled the sauce, but I think doubling it would have been fine. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers: adding garlic, and putting the extra cabbage, chopped, in the bottom of the casserole. It was still excellent, but something was missing. I think next time I may add some onion soup mix to the meat, as others recommended. I may also use canned crushed tomatoes instead of sauce, and let the cabbage rolls cook uncovered for the last few minutes.

The only adjustment I made to this recipe was to just cut the head of cabbage in half and boil it so that the leaves come a part and are easier to handle once they cool. I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it. There were NO left overs. I would love to make this again. And double the sauce recipe, mine was nearly cooked off and I had to make a second batch half way through cooking. Maybe next time I'll make 2 and a half more for sauce.

Used brown rice, half ground turkey half ground pork, added garlic to meat mixture.  Layered crock with leftover cabbage at bottom.  I put the rolls in frozen and the sauce on top (doubled as others requested) was also frozen, then added a can of tomato soup because I was paranoid after reading other reviews.  Cooked it on high for about 6 hours.
My kids INHALED it and so did we!  Will definitely be making this again.

These halupki are delicious.  I used venison instead of beef and they came out moist and delicious.  I didn't put in as much pepper as the recipe call ed for. I would suggest using a larger can of sauce as there was not much liquid left in the crockpot when done cooking.

We really loved these; it was a good, middle-of-the weak main dish. I wouldn't serve this for guests, not because of the taste but because it's just more like serving guests meatloaf.  I followed the advice of a few of the other reviews and I'm glad I did: triple the sauce amount and add garlic and spices to the meat mixture. I'll definitely be making these again!!!!

I freeze my cabbage first and the let thaw for a whole day, it's very easy to get the  leaves off. It only took me 2 hours to put them together, for about forty rolls.

Wonderful recipe. This is my husband's favorite dish!

 I decided I didn't want to mess with the whole process of rolling them so I took a look at the stuffed cabbage casserole on this site and just did everything that they did only using THIS recipe .  I couldn't see where an egg would be useful in this method so I left it out.  I did use the milk, but realized after the fact that I could have left that out as well.   I chose to use brown rice to bump up the nutrition and fiber and used a bit more Worcestershire sauce.  DELICIOUS!   
My husband told me that he actually prefers them this way now because they are easier to eat this way!  YAY!

It's a keeper!

Just made these and they are absolutely WONDERFUL!!! I love all the flavors this recipe has to offer! I'm not at all skilled in the kitchen, but I'd like to find a way to make the Cabbage a bit crispier? It's just a texture I'd prefer and the only thing I'd attempt to change. I WILL be making these again! Thank you so much for sharing!

Made these and just want to share with you the tip from my Mother.  She chunks up potatoes and the leftover cabbage and spreads that on the bottom of a) slow-cooker or b) deep dish roaster and that helps with the grease cooked off from the burger and also gives you a.one and done meal! We love our cabbage rolls and I doubled my batch and triplex the sauce mix, perfect.  Thanks for always being there and filling in the holes, like the lemon juice,  I forgot all about the lemon juice. :)

I put the rolls atop 2 large cans of sauerkraut to which I added black pepper corns and caraway seeds. I also added a large  clove of garlic to the meat and rice mix. It was even better than I expected as my family has made Pigs-In-A-Blanket for New Years Eve for decades .

Wife is about to start working so I need to start helping out at the house. This was my first time cooking and we both loved it . As others state make double the sauce. I used half of the salt and half of black pepper and sprinkled a little bit of garlic powder.

Really liked this. It's basically meatloaf... but thought it was good. Double the sauce and add extra Worcestershire sauce.   Next time consider adding some more herbs to the meat (ex. thyme, rosemary).  I used 12 of the bigger leaves from 1 head of napa cabbage but not much cabbage flavor/texture is left after cooking so I'd suggest double-wrapping the meat scoops next time with 2 leaves each (so two small heads of napa cabbage).  Toss the remaining small leaves into the slow cooker - don't throw them out.  A generous 1/4cup scoop of meat into each leaf resulted in 12 cabbage rolls.  Steamed the rice and at the same time steamed the leaves so they were pliable (instead of boiling. Another reviewer suggested freezing them to make them pliable instead of cooking).

I didn't think I would be that excited about these, but they are quite good.  I also didn't expect that both myself and my husband went back for second helpings.  There is something very "home-y" and genuine about this food that is really terrific.  
The one negative is I didn't feel I had saved any time by using the slow cooker.  After cooking cabbage leaves and rice, mixing up a sauce, and rolling up each leaf with the mix--well I had dirtied quite a few dishes and it took me an hour.  This is a lot to do to in the morning to get dinner ready later.  However, they are very tasty.  I might just try baking them next time.

My husband has been asking for stuffed cabbage for years and I finally decided to make it for him.  This recipe seemed easier to put together than I had remembered.  My plan was to double the sauce as others had suggested, but when I shopped I bought (2) 16 oz cans of diced tomatoes, and forgot the tomato sauce.  It still worked out just fine.  Next time, I will use an 8oz can of sauce and 28oz can of diced tomatoes.  I really liked it with the tomatoes.  I cooked it on the stove top, covered for an hour in the morning.  For dinner I just reheated them in the microwave.

Used condensed tom.  soup instead of Tom sauce.  Doubled the recipe but still needed more cabbage.  Seems like a lot but cooks down.  Left out worchestershire.   Cooked in oven for 1.1/2 hours on 400 degrees.  Needed more sauce with extra cabbage.  Made it lasagna style.  Turned out great.

5 stars with suggestions from other commenters. I cooked covered, at 350 for an hour. Cored and steamed cabbage in 3” of boiling water for three minutes to easily remove leaves. Increased onion, added garlic and a few basil leaves. Also added in about 1 1/2 c of spaghetti sauce to provide more. 1/2 c of that went in the meat. Excellent!

Made it in oven. Lined bottom of 9x13" pan with some added cabbage and a little sauce so the rolls did not stick and clean up was easier. Also covered with a few extra cabbage leaves under foil the night before church. Then popped it in oven an hour before leaving for church and kept it warm until after church.

I doubled the sauce due to others that reviewed the recipe, but really should have tripled or quadrupled the sauce. I ended up with 16 rolls and had to double stack the rolls in my Rival slow cooker. All the ones on top were somewhat dry. The edges were starting to burn even on low because there was not enough sauce. But even then all the rolls on top were still good. The ones on the bottom, in the sauce were excellent.

Wonderful recipe!  I used a 50/50 ground beef and Italian sausage mix to add in a bit more flavor. I also cored the cabbage before putting it in the boiling water, and one by one the leaves peeled off easily (go to YouTube to see how this is done - so easy!)  I quadrupled the sauce recipe because my family loves sauce with our cabbage rolls.  And finally, I baked at 350 for 1.5 hours instead of using the slow cooker.  It was amazing!  I will definitely be making this again and again!  Thanks!!

I made several changes so this is not a review of the recipe. I just wanted to get an idea of what to do. Also, I wanted to emphasize that I boiled the whole head of cabbage as someone suggested. As each leaf cooked, it basically peeled itself away from the rest of the head. This is an endorsement of that procedure. I gave it top rating because it came together well and because I could not honestly downgrade it. After all, I did change things.

I, like most, doubled the sauce.  Excellent recipe!  I did the cabbage by doing corned beef and cabbage one day and the next, used the leftover leaves.  I've always wanted a great recipe leftover cabbage and this is the one!

I Grow Swiss chard, so instead of cabbage I use the chard. No pre boiling. Instead of crock pot, I put it in a big pan cover with foil and bake at 350 for about a half hour .delicious!!

It was great!! I made this with quite a few changes! I used green and purple cabbage for extra color.  I basically doubled most of the recipe!! I used 1 1/4 T. of seasoning called Swamp Dust instead of salt.  I used 1/2 lb. of ground turkey also.  For the sauce, I used canned spaghetti sauce with mushrooms.

With the suggestion from other cooks to double the sauce, this turned out very nicely. It was my very first attempt at making cabbage rolls. Next time, I'm going to freeze the cabbage head first as boiling was messy and time-consuming plus some of the leaves tore. Hubby says it's "amazing ", he definitely loves the sauce!

Definitely a very good basic recipe, but try including tips like using Savoy cabbage and freezing it before using. Also, try adding 6 to 8 gingersnaps crumbled into the sauce. It disolves when cooked and adds nice flavor. That's how my Grandmother used to make them! Also, double the sauce if you want any for rice!

Great easy weekday dinner. I agree with the other reviewers - it needed garlic and additional sauce (I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes that I puréed with a stick blender before adding the other ingredients). I also used ground turkey to save some calories and fat but I don't think it impacted the flavor much and prevented the rolls from being oily.

These were delicious! Like others I also wanted more sauce so I used a 14 oz. can of tomato sauce and also added a can of "diced tomatoes in sauce" (I love tomatoes and will use any excuse to sneak them into a recipe if I can.) They were pretty soupy which is OK by me but may be too much for others. I think next time I will keep the diced tomatoes but only use the 8 oz. can of sauce as in the recipe. Notice I said "next time" ... I will definitely be making these again!! Thanks!

Everyone has their own way of making these.I do not use any salt,just pepper.I do the rice in low sodium beef broth and cabbage the same way.I use ketchup and mix a little bit sour cream and pepper.And I use brown rice instead of white.And bake them and serve with some good rye bread.

I have been making this for years.  One of our standards during Christmas. Thanks for the tip about wilting the cabbage in the freezer first. That's the worse part, getting the cabbage ready. I do cook my meat first so I don't have to worry about the fat/liquid issue.  Also I throw a can of sauerkraut over it before I bake it.  I don't use a slow cooker because I feel they fall apart to easily.  I bake in the oven.  BTW this freezes well, so you can make enough for another meal on down the road, or take to a friend.

Treid these last night. I think it's a great base for a recipe.  Given the fact I made changes to suit my own taste, I gave it a 3.  
Added additional spices to my meat mixture, as well as my sauce.  I like bold flavours, so the basics just don't cut it for me.  I also had a massive head of cabbage, so I used half a cup of filling per roll.  They were huge, but sooo good!  I also cooked them in the oven rather than slow cooker.

This was a great recipe! I did change a few things which is why i'm giving it 4 stars. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 tsp of garlic powder to give it more flavor. I also used a can of san marzano whole peeled tomatoes and mashed with my hand for the sauce, thus making 4 times more sauce because I wanted more and I wanted it to be chunky. It was fantastic! And just as great the next day as leftovers. I will be making this again.

Cabbage Rolls II Haiku: "Bit of work to make. But really worth the effort. Should've made double!" I followed the recipe's ingredient list exactly, only baking 350 for about an hour, partially-covered, due to not having the slow-cooker time available. The only things that I wish I'd done differently was add some minced garlic, and prep more for leftovers or for freezing b/c I felt like it was a quite a bit of work for the 12 rolls that fed 3 of us (one of whom was a 6 year old), but SHAZAM, we obliterated them all!

My husband loved these!! I added a can of diced tomatoes and doubled the brown sugar, lemon, and Worcestershire sause. I also cut up the unused cabbage and added it in with the diced tomatoes. Great recipe! Easy to make!

These were good but I did triple the amount of sauce as recommended by another reviewer.  The saucier a dish is, the better I always say.  I usually tend to taste the metallic flavor from canned tomatoes, so next time I'll use sauce from a jar.

I guess cabbage rolls are an acquired taste.  My kids have not yet acquired this particular taste!  But, my husband and I like them!  My cabbage leaves were a bit tough.  That's most likely my error and no fault of the recipe.

Delicious! Just like my Grandma makes :) I used ground Turkey instead, and A1 instead of Worcestershire, I also added Sauerkraut to the bottom of the slow cooker.  Next day's left overs were just as good! Will definitely make more next time to have bunches of left overs :)

Smelled bad, looked bad and...didn't taste too good. Really awful mushy texture. I used spaghetti sauce with a can of tomato paste added and I'm glad I did, because otherwise the blandness would've been intolerable. Thing is, I can see this working with a LOT of tweaks. But I'm not sure it'd be worth the effort.

Definitely a remake. Used half beef and half pork. Doubled the sauce and will add a bit of it to the stuffing next time. Also, we found that for us, the recipe makes four servings when served with salad.

This was my first shot at cabbage rolls and it turned out great!! This is another one of those recipes that you can think of a million different ways to do it!! It's delish, as is, though. Loved it!! I wasn't thinking and did coleslaw as a side dish. It was a stinky evening at my house, too much cabbage!! LOL

This is a very good basic recipe.  I only tweaked it a little to make it a bit more flavorful.  I added 2t of Worcestershire and 2T of Parmesano Reggiano to the meat mixture.  I also simply baked it in the oven, covered with foil, at 375 for 20 minutes.

Made vegetarian with veggie beef crumblers and organic Worcestershire sauce (normal has anchovies). Also used 4x sauce and baked, 350 for 1 hour, as recommended from others. The cabbage is near impossible to get 10 large leaves from without ripping them. I wound up putting the head in boiling water once for each leaf to soften it. It's kind of a pain, the frozen option is probably better.

This recipe was great. I did take the advice of some others that commented here, and I tripled the sauce. My cabbage leaves were huge, so it didn't make 12, but it did make 6 large rolls, and that was plenty for us. I added the 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder, added more onion, cut the pepper in half, and I chopped the remaining cabbage up and put it in the bottom since the BF loves cabbage. Also, instead of boiling the cabbage (I was afraid that would make the leaves too soggy)I followed the advice given here and just put it in the microwave for 4 minutes and the leaves were super easy to peel off, and didn't get soggy at all after being in the crockpot.

There wasn't enough sauce.  Too much lemon in the sauce.  Too much pepper in the hamburger.  I am going to try a different recipe next time.

This is the 2nd cabbage roll recipe I've tried in a month & I am never cooking cabbage rolls again. Both of them got 1 star, but the other recipe did have a much better flavor than this one, more tomato sauce was added. Both of them I couldn't eat, neither one cooked all the way through.

These were delicious, though I was outvoted by the family to omit the tomato sauce.  I'll get my way next time, as they were a bit dry without it.  I must admit I added a half pound of ground pork to the already perfect mixture, only because that's how my father made them for years.  This is a classic cabbage roll recipe that you can't go wrong on!

I looooove my moms cabbage rolls she always made it for me so when I moved away I really really missed it. I decided to try this recipe and I'm glad I did! It tastes just like my moms sarma. It does need a bit of help though. I used kisili kupus. (Sour cabbage) it's important to cut off the spine of each leaf. I used half extra lean ground beef and ground pork like my mom did. I put a small can of tomato sauce right in the mixture and a bit more onions and 3 cloves of minced garlic. I didn't use that much black pepper either. Mixed it with my hand and I rolled em up and put them in the slow cooker. I put a bunch of water in there too enough to submerge the rolls. I cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours and half way through I made zaprska in a pan (heated some oil and fried some flour for a minute then put paprika in it) added that then added a tall can of hunts tomato sauce. But i had to put more water in cuz it soaked up almost all the water! It definitely needs this help. Otherwise it would get 5 stars but tastes so good this way with mashed potatoes. I made quite a bit like 18 I think. I got a small head of sour cabbage. Thank you for this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious! Exactly what I was looking for. I made the recipe exactly as-is with 80% lean ground beef and it turned out fabulous. Next time I will try doubling the sauce but this recipe is great. We had to fight over leftovers! XD

I added 1/4 tsp. granulated garlic and used spaghetti sauce, since I did not have tomato sauce on hand.  I baked it an hour coveted on 375 and later 325 for 30 min. uncovered.

Wanting to try this for awhile now, it left my family underwhelmed. I was let down by the sauce, and that's the main reason I wanted to try this recipe! I doubled it per popular suggestion and still found myself doctoring it up with more brown sugar and worcestershire, as well as onion/garlic powders. I used a can of Campbell's Tomato Bisque soup for the base and laid all 12 rolls over that in a 9x13 baking dish. Used savoy cabbage without any issues, used the 90-second rice in a bag, cooled. Used 1/2 lean hamburger and 1/2 Italian sausage, well-seasoned, and only 1/8 cup milk. Baked covered tightly with foil at 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes. This dish has so much potential, so I'll definitely do this over with some major tweaking. I appreciate the basic idea of this dish and will use it as a springboard to cater to my family's tastes.

This recipe was ok but a little bland and maybe a little too sweet.  I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce.  I added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes to the 8 oz can of tomato sauce and mashed the diced tomatoes up a little bit, and then added the lemon juice, brown sugar, and Worchestershire sauce.  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture and I used ground turkey instead of beef. I baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour instead of making it in the slow cooker as one other reviewer recommended because I was pressed for time.  We do like cabbage rolls so I will try this again, but next time I will add more spices and less brown sugar.  I will make it in the slow cooker too, to give the flavors more time to blend.  This recipe has potential but in my family's opinion it needs just more of a spicy flavor to it.

It's okay but could be much better.  I not only doubled the sauce but added a 14oz can of diced tomatoes.  i love black pepper but There is too much black pepper, it drowns out the other flavors.  I would recommend using less black pepper and added additional onions and some minced garlic in he meat mixture.  Also could use a little more rice as well.  I used brown rice.

I chose this recipe because I needed to use the cabbages in the garden. I doubled the sauce and cooked everything on low for 8 hours. I should have quadrupled the sauce so the filling didn't taste so dry. I intended to use slices of sour dough bread to sop up the liquid sauce, but there wasn't any sauce.

I did not care for this recipe. There was not flavor in the filling and the texture wasmushy.  There was not enough sauce, and I should have read some of the reviews before making it.  Sauce needs to be doubled or tripled- mine started to dry out after a few hours and had to add water.

These were super easy to make and tasted great. We did have to add extra liquid to cover all the cabbage rolls. Next time I am going to make a double batch of sauce for the same number of cabbage rolls.

My husband loves stuffed cabbage and this recipe is the best so far.  I only added 1 extra tbsp of brown sugar and 1 extra tbsp of worcheshire sauce and 1 tsp of tuscany herb. This gave a meaty light sweet taste ending with a hint of bite from the extra worcheshire sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! Tasted great. The sauce was amazing! The only thing I added was 1/8 tsp garlic powder to the meat and I double the sauce. Next time I might even triple the sauce. I loved it and my husband who doesn't like cabbage even liked it!

Made this recipe twice and have enjoyed it each time. It's a little time intesive but not hard, and kinda messy to prepare. Worth the effort tho. Fortunately I put it together on a Sunday night for Monday's slow cooker meal. I would have been crazy frantic if I tried to tackle this after a long day at the office. Great dish!!

Funny....I thought I followed the directions exactly, but I guess I didn't!  I just noticed another reviewer caution about using a lean meat since the meat isnt' cooked before stuffing the cabbage!  Well, this is the 2nd time I am making it, and I cooked the meat both times before stuffing and it is still delicious!  I doubled the recipe and made 16.....and quadrupled the sauce quantity (I had just enough with a single batch the last time, but prefer more.....then I placed in 4 portioned out freezer dinner containers that I can pop into the crock pot.  This worked well the last time.  Also STEAMED the cored head of cabbage this time, and it was much easier to work with than boiling.  I didn't notice this the last time I made it, but tasting the meat stuffing mix....it tasted VERY peppery!  I am hoping once I cook it in the crock pot, the sauce will tone it down....that is what prompted me to look at reviews after I made it, I wanted to see if others said the same thing, and they did!  If it tastes as good as it did the first time I made it, I'll continue to use the stated amount of pepper in the recipe...just beware...you can always add more to taste when serving!  This recipe is very tasty!

As a vegetarian I used morning star veggie crumbles and it was simply delicious!!! My dad loved it!! (Hard to please when it comes to vegetarian dishes!). I used 1/3 of a cup for the filling and it was a perfect size!

Great, easy recipe. As other reviewers suggested, double the sauce so there is some to use after they bake if you cook them in the oven. There may be enough sauce if you crockpot them? I wanted something quick so in the oven they went. Another review hint I used was to cover the rolls with extra cabbage, worked well as the rolls didn't get too dark, and it saved some tinfoil. no problem taking off the leaves when the cabbage boiled, I cut around the center before cooking and as the leaves cooked off, I pulled them out of the pot with tongs. this recipe made 7 rolls for me, my cabbage was pretty big and we stuffed them pretty good. will make again

Tried it, the whole family enjoyed it - with the addition of various sauces. The recipe for the sauce should be doubled or even tripled. The recipe given did tend to dry up a bit. My husband recommended making the rolls without the sauce and adding an Asian twist and using soyaki sauce (from trader joes) in the slow cooker for the last hour or so with it next time. Also, I should have listened to the other reviewers about freezing the cabbage first. It was a true lesson in patience to get the cabbage leaves of the head intact - i wont be doing it that way again! Will try it again. Good base recipe - lots of potential.

I have tried this recipe exactly as written as well as tired it with a few of the modifications that were suggested by other reviewers and I just can't bring myself to like it as much as other cabbage roll recipes that I've tried; sorry. I think it may be the lemon juice in the sauce, there was an odd tang that I did not enjoy. Great cheap and easy meal idea though!

I had never tried cabbage rolls but allrecipies emailed me this and it sounded so good and easy I had to try it. And I'm sure glad I did! It was easy to make (the most difficult part was fishing the hot leaves out of the boiling water I may try the freezing idea next time.) 
Here are the few tweeks I did:
I hate onion so I went with onion powder
I added garlic powder (my personal taste)
My tomato sauce was in a 16oz can so I doubled the sauce (which I'm glad I did)
I also added lemon pepper and garlic powder to the sauce
And I only had regular ground beef so I reserved some of the sauce and when they were done I served them in a dish that would drain the grease off and put the reserved sauce on top.
The results were great! I love recipes that leave room for the addition of personal taste. You can easily add other ingredients to make this your own personal dish.

These were great! Of course I tweaked it alittle.  Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey and instead of white rice, I used brown.  I added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, upped the onion to 1/2 to 3/4 cup and omitted the salt. I tripled the sauce but only added 2 tablesspoons of brown sugar.  The flavor was amazing.  We really enjoyed them.

These were very good. My dad loved them and said they tasted very much like his grandmother's. I would make them more often if I could get my kids to try them but they are a lot of work for just me.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH SAUCE TO COVER THE ROLLS!!!!  I made the mistake of cutting the recipe in half and followed as written...needless to say 6 rolls + very little sauce + 9 hours on low in the crockpot = crispy burnt mess!  I did manage to find a few edible bites which were very good, but next time more sauce!

This so good.  I double the sauce recipe and put a layer of sauerkraut on the bottom of the dish.  It creates a sweet and sour cabbage.  I also cook it in the oven.  So tasty.

This was the first time I've made Cabbage Rolls and they turned out excellent. I took the advice of some others and put extra cabbage leaves on the bottom to soak up the juice and extra for people who love cabbage! The sauce needed to be doubled which was a must also, but you can change up the sauce to your liking, I added to tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes to make the sauce a little chunkier. I also made more cabbage rolls then what the recipe yielded! All together a great recipe and will make again!

sorry, i don't know if i just didn't follow the recipe right or what but while these were edible i found they took way too much time for something that was kind of bland.

This was great.  Only giving 4 stars b/c it needs tweaked a bit.  The sauce is easy and perfect for this dish, but an 8 oz can is not near enough.  I used 2 15 oz cans and it was perfect.  I am going to try freezing the cabbage next time, b/c it is very time consuming - but in the end worth it.  I would also season the meat quite a bit before cooking (onions, garlic, etc).  I used 99% FF turkey and it worked well.  Cook time was right on, I assembled the night before and put on in the morning.  Served w/mashed potatoes.  YUM! Definitely making again!

I made 9 rolls out of this recipe. I also added some spices to the meat mixture. These were nice and saucy so I will definitely be making them again. As well, they freeze and recook so well!

I made this tonight, following the directions except no rice, and baking on low for 3 hours with extra sauce per others' suggestions.  I thought it had a lot of potential, but needs some kind of flavor zooom.  I'll try again.

These are delicous! Thuogh I did take heed and doubled the sauce (you must), add a little extra meat and had to cook them in the oven for time's sake. These are also great becuase you can easily modify some of them to fit other dietary needs if necessary. I left out rice and milk for some and my guest who had them loved them too!

Another easy and tasty slow cooker recipe!  I substituted brown rice and ground turkey for the white rice and ground beef.  I also left out the milk which I didn't notice was missing at all; still very moist.  To make extra sauce, Ijust added one can of tomato soup to the regular sauce recipe (although I didn't have lemon juice so omitted it).

It was very meat-centric. Next time, I will add more spices (I did add oregano and onion powder) and make the rolls of meat smaller, maybe even double cabbage. Easy recipe, though.

This recipe was a great starting point but as written it was way to much pepper. I cut back half on the pepper and added oregano, basil and some garlic powder to the meat mixture. Before boiling the cabbage I removed the core and it peeled away quickly enough. We found the sauce ample enough and quite tasty. 8 hrs in the slow cooker was a little long but they turned out very tender and delicious. Well worth all the work.

Delicious!  I did double the sauce, as many other reviewers suggested.  That change made it a 5 star recipe!  Instead of cooked rice, I used uncooked Minute Rice, which reduced the prep time.  I also used dehydrated onion, and would suggest putting a small amount of sauce in the rolls as well as over.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Excellent!  We added 1 link of hot Italian sausage to the 1# beef and used spanish rice instead of white-- and for the sauce used 1-28 oz. can  Hunt's zesty and spicy spaghetti sauce plus 3T. brown sugar, 3T lemon juice and 3 tsp. Worcestershire.  We did use about 1/2 onion diced instead of the minced onion. This has layers of flavors and has some heat, but mostly lots and lots of flavors.  Served with mashed potatoes. Awesome cool weather meal!! Enjoy--

OMG!! This is SOOOO GOOD!! I doubled the sauce and baked for an hour @350 instead since I didn't have 8 hrs to wait.  I could still feel the texture of cababage.  I'd definitely make it again and will use a slow cooker to see how tender the cabbage would be.

This is a great basic cabbage roll recipe. Boil your cabbage leaves and they will peel easily from the head of cabbage.  I also followed other reviews and added some garlic powder for flavor. Very Tasty! Husband and kids enjoyed...thank you for sharing!

Based on other reviews I made a couple of slight changes to this recipe. I add 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, doubled the sauce recipe, and cooked it on 350 for an hour in the oven. My family found the meat bland, even with the changes, and the cabbage leaves were hard to cut. I probably won't be making this recipe again.

This Recipe called for to much pepper and not enough Tomato Sauce.  Needs to use more brown sugar.  Wasn't sweet enough for me.  Also,  mine were starting to burn after 6 hrs in the crock pot.

We loved this recipe.  I forgot the brown sugar in the sauce(hubby is diabetic), and I used diced tomatoes - fire roasted. I also added garlic powder to the rice water. These are fabulous.  As there are only 2 of us, I ended up with 8 rolls.  Definitely worth the work.

The meat mixture needs something more; salt and pepper alone wasn't flavorful enough.

I loved this following the recommendations. I added garlic, used onion flakes for time, and used a jar of spaghetti sauce to encourage my 4 and 7 year olds to eat it. Perfect! The freezer method with the cabbage was brilliant. I am shocked at how easy this was, and it can be altered to different tastes using various herbs and sauces. Thank you!

I really enjoyed this one. I used onion soup mix for flavor instead of the minced onion. Put in the oven on 350 covered for an hour and doubled the sauce. This was my first time making cabbage rolls and I had so much fun rolling them! :) Will make again.

Tastes great and easy to make. I too used less pepper than called for because I know we don't like strong pepper taste. Other than that, followed exactly.

used canned marinara / pasta sauce, whole bottle. Added nutmeg, pimenton de la vera, herbes de provence and some bbq sauce to the tomato sauce. Cook in 350 over for an hour instead of crock pot

I made these for Easter dinner and was a bit disappointed.  These were no where near as good as my mom's or mom-in-law's. The cabbage rolls themselves came out great but we didn't care for the sauce -it tasted more like barbecue sauce.  Next time I make them I will use tomato soup rather than the sauce that the recipe calls for and will also use a mixture of beef/pork and perhaps some paprika.

These are Great! Reminded me of my Polish grandma's recipe. Only change I might make is to cut down on pepper (just my preference). Otherwise, great recipe.

Loved it!  Didn't change anything.  I tried cabbage rolls 30 yrs ago, and they didn't turn out.  Finally brave enough to try again, and sure am glad I used this recipe.  Family and friends loved them and wanted the recipe.

We really liked the way this turned out.  First off we doubled the reciep, and then increased the amount of onions by half, and increased the sauced ingredients by half as well.  Furthermore instead of making it roll based, it was layered in a lasagna like fashion.  We changed out the beef for bison preference.  All in all it turned out great.  I thought it could used a little kick so ate it with some hotsauce.  This is a tastey recipe!

Tasty! Wrapped cabbage has a nice texture and the flavor makes the meat so moist! the only thing I changed was instead of ground beef I used lean ground turkey.

Made these little beauties for the extended family - could have made 4 times the recipes and there still would not have been enough!  Absolutely wonderful!  Instead of tomato sauce, I used tomato soup and just put them in the crock pot on low all day! I also made the rolls and froze them on a cookie sheet ahead of time - the cabbage still had a little bite to it, but the meat melted in your mouth.  I am sure I will be making this again and again!

I doubled the sauce, used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to freeze and then thaw the cabbage to allow the leaves to peel off easily.  I didn't like this much the day I made it, but for some reason, I really liked the leftovers.  However, it was difficult to eat the rolls without them falling apart.  I think I would prefer a recipe with the same ingredients but layered with shredded cabbage so it's easier to eat.  Also, the sauce got very runny.  Maybe this was my fault because the turkey wasn't lean enough, but I'd rather not pay more for extra lean turkey.  If I make this again I might try using tomato paste in place of some of the tomato sauce or undercooking the rice so it will absorb the juices.  This recipe has a lot of potential, but I won't make it again without changing it.

To quote another reviewer..."HOLY BLANDNESS" This was very bland even after I added just a little amount of spices that other reviews said to. I think this recipe could be great but it needs a lot of help.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe! I made it one evening after I had leftover rice. I was hesitant about the worchestershire sauce and the lemon juice but it made the perfect sauce, perfect flavor - just delicious! I might add another can of sauce on top next time just so I have extra to pour over the cabbage rolls when I serve them next time. GREAT recipe!

Very tasty.  Would've been better if I had basted the rolls with sauce while they were cooking--some parts of the cabbage were a little too chewy.  Flavor of meat inside was very good.  Like others, I made these changes to the recipe:  steamed the whole head of cabbage first, tripled the sauce (I think doubling would be perfect), added 1/2 teas. pepper and this was plenty, used ground turkey instead of ground beef.

I used 90% lean ground beef and doubled the recipe for the filling.  There was minimal grease in the pot.  Based on other reviewers, I quadrupled the sauce.  Good thing I did.  These were great, had enough for 4 hungry people (we each had 3 to 4), plus enough for lunch the next day for all of us.  All of us liked it a lot.  The only 'weird' thing was the meat was pretty compact in the cabbage.  I do not know if this is because I used a 1/4 cup measure and scooped the meat tightly, or because that is just the way it cooks.  Still delicious though.  Definitely gonna do this one again and again.

Excellent, although I customized this recipe quite a bit. For 1.5 lb. extra lean ground beef, I upped the other meat ingredients and added 2 cloves of garlic minced and 3/4 c. chopped parsley. I tripled the sauce, substituting white vinegar for the lemon juice and added a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes. Baked covered at 350 for about 1 hr. Needs to rest for about 15 min. Made 15 rolls. There are lots of ways to tweak this recipe to suit differing tastes. Using leftover rice, this was not difficult or time-consuming to make.

Holy Blandness!  I don't normally do reviews but this one I had to, this recipe got such good reviews I thought it would be great, but it was incredible bland. I did follow the suggestions to add extra onions to the meat mixture and to double the sauce and add some salt on the rolls before putting adding the sauce, but still it was a huge disappointment…

I would steam the whole cabbage first next time, and add garlic powder to the meat mixture. I would also eliminate the brown sugar as it gave the sauce a sweet taste I didn't like. Double the tomato sauce though.

I have always made my cabbage rolls in a pressure cooker so was not sure about baking them.  I layed them in a singe layer in a large dish, sliced the remaining cabbage in about 2-3 inch slices and layed on top of rolls.  I doubled the sauce ( which was very tasty) and poured over all.  I baked it covered and an extra 20 minutes to allow for the extra cabbage.  Delicious!!  Will definitely make again.

Funny how after all these years of trying this and that and I mean a lot of challenging recipes, I'd never made stuffed cabbage.  So, this was my first experience at making them and it was so easy I just couldn't believe it.  They were a big hit with everyone and I didn't change a thing.

This recipe was delicious! I used diced tomatoes instead, so that I get some of the flavor but so I could scrape them off easily for my picky eaters.  But I think the tomato sauce would have been better.  I was hoping for leftovers, but there was none.

Easy recipe.  Tasty.   Made as shown but quadrupled the sauce as recommended by the other reviewers and then baked them for 1 hr at 350 instead of using the crockpot, but it was good. I will make again.

All in all, this recipe was very good.  The meat could use way more seasoning and the recipe does not call for enough sauce.  I tripled the amount of sauce and still didn't feel like I had enough.  One user mentioned cutting up the rest of the cabbage and putting it in the crock pot below the cabbage rolls - I didn't do this because I thought it would make too much liquid in the pot,  but next time I think I will.  If anything it'll help stretch the sauce.

Use a can of tomato soup with the brown sugar and lemon juice.  Put the worcestershire sauce in with the hamburger mixture.  Add one teaspoon of dijon mustard and one teaspoon horsdradish to the hamburger mixture as well.  Brown the cabbage rolls prior to putting them in a slow cooker or in the oven.

Used 1/2 lb pork & 1/2 lb beef.  The filling stays together really well.  So Yummy, especially on a cool fall day.

We all loved these... I still haven't mastered the art of getting cabbage leaves off without tearing, but they're good, none the less. Added some worces. sauce and brown sugar.

I was pleasantly surprised by how good these were.  I halved the cabbage/filling (6 rolls instead of 12) and doubled the sauce.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to both the filling and sauce.  Instead of using the crockpot, I baked the rolls in a glass dish covered with foil for an hour at 350 degrees.  I found it very difficult to remove the raw cabbage leaves without mangling them.  Next time, I will try one of the methods suggested by other reviewers (freezing or steaming).

Rather than use white rice, I switched for brown rice.  It turned out great except a bit dry.  There wasn't enough sauce for the rolls. I would double the tomato sauce portion of the recipe and keep half of it to add about 15 mins before you serve.  That way it'll be nice and moist.

Excellent flavour, not difficult to make.  I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted the meat with veggie ground round and it turned out great.  I would definitely recommend using twice the amount of tomato sauce.

I thought these were kind of boring.  I added minced garlic to the beef mixture and doubled the sauce.  I cooked them in the oven for an hour and ten minutes at 350.  I won't make them again.

Never had cabbage rolls but these were really good.  Since I didn't have very lean beef, I cooked it before stuffing the cabbage leaves.  Changed the texture (from what I can see in the pictures) but was still good.  Might have to follow another reviewer's suggestion of freezing the cabbage to make the leaves easier to remove next time.  I ripped quite a few!

Good recipe!  Used frozen cabbage method to soften cabbage (freeze then thaw head) worked real well, will use for Runza so not have to steam so long.  Also used Greek seasonning & reduced pepper (still had bit of bite)  Slow cooked it.  Originally, doubled sauce (used 15 oz tomato sauce can) by end of slow cooking time, sauce cooked away.  So, made 2nd batch of sauce, another 15 oz can + double brn sugar/sauce/lemon. WIll make again, probably not a staple,but will make/enjoy again.

This was an awesome new recipe at our house.  My husband was just trying to keep an open mind and ended up wolfing down 3.  I did some altering with what I had.  I reduced the pepper and salt, I used evaporated milk for the milk  and used 1 10 oz can tomato soup instead of tomato sauce ( I was afraid it may taste too metalic)I even used minute rice and 5 minutes in prep and 8 hours later we have a winner!!! A new favorite.

Great recipe! I would maybe give it 5 stars, but I tried cooking the cabbage in the microwave as someone suggested and it turned out somewhat chewy. Would recommend boiling cabbage, otherwise it was yummy!

These were awesome!!!  I used tips from lots of the past reviews.....First I cored and microwaved the cabbage until the leaves came off very easy.  I doubled the recipe and used half ground pork and half ground beef, also added garlic powder.  I used brown rice but didn't have enough tomato sauce to quadruple the sauce so doubled it and added a can of tomato soup near the end of baking (350 for 1.5 hours).  My family loved these, I will definately make again SOON.

Instead of making it into rolls I altered it to a casserole.  I did increase the sauce, onions and added garlic.  I still found it lacked a little flavour and needs more adjusting.  I cooked it in the oven at 350 for an hour and it could have still used more time.

Eh...i was really hoping for something great b/c of the ease of use in the slow cooker, but even after adding some garlic powder and a dash of woretshire (i know i slaughtered that spelling) to the meat, it was just bland.  meat was bland, sauce was bland.  hubby loved it tho and said he'd "allow" me to make it once a month.  i will probably try again as a base recipe, but add in my own preferences in the meat and sauce.

I too read the reviews before I headed to the kitchen.  Here are the things I added/changed: I used ground turkey for the filling and added finely chopped carrots, mushroom and one clove of garlic.  Also, I doubled the amount of sauce and baked in the oven 350 for an hour. This one is a keeper! PS- My husband made a yucky face when I told him what I was making for dinner. He ate 6 of them!!!

These were pretty good. Missing some flavor though. I think next time I'd use a  really good marinara sauce to go in and on top on the rolls. Inside I added a lot of garlic, with all other ingredients. But I definitly think next time a pasta sauce will add flavor it needs

This recipe was okay, but I thought overall it was kind of bland and the tomato sauce was too sweet for my preference. My mother used to make cabbage rolls when I was young and used spagehetti sauce instead, which I prefer as it adds good flavor but isn't overpowering. For the meat mixture I increased the rice and onion and added in some garlic and parsley which seemed to help a bit. I baked these in the oven this time around and they came out good.  Next time I make this though I'll try the crock pot method and use my homemade spagehetti sauce instead with the additional changes I made.

I used soy crumbles in place of the beef.We like our food with more spice. Perhaps sour kraut and/or Old Bay would do the trick! Like others, I doubled the sauce to have enough.

This is the only way I've ever gotten my husband to eat cabbage! You HAVE to at least double the sauce. Next time I will probably triple it as the inside comes out a little dry. Tasty, but dry! Overall he did enjoy them and I might be able to talk him into making it every few weeks. I will make this again.

Simply the best golumbki recipe!  My polish boyfriend thought this was the best out of all the golumbkis that I have made!  I tripled the recipe because we eat a lot of these.  So I used about three pounds of hamburger and about four cabbages!  I also used four cans of tomato sauce! We love this sauce, it is what makes the recipe.  I parboiled the cabbage (messy but worth it) rolled them up and doublestacked them in a roasting pan.  Put them in the oven on 350 for about 2 1/2 hours and they were wonderful.  I really think the milk makes the filling really soft! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good Cabbage rolls, but you gotta be in the mood for simple flavors. I too, boiled the whole head of cabbage. Much easier!

Great recipe.  Took others suggestions and put 8 oz. drained sauerkraut over the rolls before pouring sauce over which I increased by adding 1 can diced tomatos.  Also used brown rice as I had leftovers from day before.  Will definitely be a regular recipe.

I love stuffed cabbage. I always steam the head of cabbage in the microwave, removing a thew leaves at a time. Also something I learned from my German Father in law, put just a small amount of sauerkraut on the cabbage before adding the meat mixture. I did increase the sauce.

As written, I give this four stars. Five with my changes: as other reviewers have stated, core and steam the whole head of cabbage. The sauce should be at least tripled, and I didn't add brown sugar (we don't really like sweet sauces). The biggest thing, though, is my Polish grandma's trick: once the rolls are in the pan, cover the whole thing with either the remainder of the steamed cabbage (chopped) or sauerkraut. This gives you that awesome cabbage-y juice that you can dump all over your mashed potatoes.

I added steak spice and a minced clove of garlic in the meat and put bay leaf in the sauce. I took some people's advice and put the rolls in a baking dish and covered with foil and baked in the oven at 375f.
It was delicious!

In all fairness, I can't review this as it is. 

I followed the other reviewers recommendations (cutting the hard parts from the leaves etc., and using more sauce.) 

The filling seemed right -- with the addition of 1 tbsp crushed garlic that is. 

The sauce, I don't know because I used homemade tomato sauce, not from the can, and then forgot entirely about the worcestershire, brown sugar, and lemon. (whoops.)

Bottom line, still very tasty. 

Next time I will not remove the harder center veins from the cabbage, because cutting them out made them virtually impossible to roll. I just boiled for 3 minutes and rolled them easily. 

I will try adding the sugar and remaining ingredients to the tomato sauce as well as it may have given it more flavour.

I also followed another reviewers instructions and cooked this in the oven for 2 hours @ 350 degrees covered. 

It changed my husbands mind about cabbage rolls. Will now go into the rotation.

The flavor was wonderful and we enjoyed stuffing ourselves right down to the design on our plates.
However, since cooking is not one of my favorite things to do I found making the cabbage rolls difficult.  The filling kept falling out because the cooked leaves would tear.  Very frustrating!!!  Told my husband enjoy these because I won't be making them again.  In spite of my short comings the recipe is great.

These were actually really good. I was kind of skeptical while in the process of making them. It was hard to roll with cabbage that I had on hand. I about 9 rolls made and still had quite a bit of filling left over so I put on top of the rolls in the crock pot. I also added 2 small (baby) cans of tomato juice and a regular size can of tomato sauce to the sauce mixture as they looked really dry before that. They turned out really good and I will plan on making these again. Husband loved them too:)

These were okay. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and white wine to the mixture. I did not have the lemon handy. I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of tomato soup. It lacked flavor, but we still had a good dinner.

These were very good.  I loved being able to put them in a slow cooker.  I didn't remove the hard spine from the cabbage leaves and wish I had.  The spine made them rather difficult to roll up.  Season the meat mixture to your taste (I added some garlic powder and Old Bay) and you'll really enjoy these.

This was good...I made 1/2 with rice and beef and the other with stuffing and beef. People seemed to like the stuffing one better. I added the sause in the cabbage rolls with some mustard and garlic. You also have to add sause intill the rolls are covered. I can see eating this twice a year...its a little too much work for me, Other than that my family loved them=) Thanks

We loved this dish.  For cabbage lovers, it's a great twist.  The only problem I had was with removing the leaves from the cabbage head.  It was difficult to do without tearing. I'm curious as to how it would work to actually boil the entire cabbage head a few minutes before attempting to remove the leaves. I also doubled the sauce topping, and it came out just perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the first recipe I made in my new slow cooker.  I liked that it was pretty quick and easy to make and the cabbage leaves were forgiving even when I ripped big holes in them (note: cooked cabbage leaves are as fragile as wet tissues!).  I used ground turkey and the resulting rolls were very nice and tender, but I didn't care for the sauce.  Too sweet for my tastes.  Unfortunately, these sat in the fridge and were thrown away after a week.  I'd like to try it again though with a slightly different tomato sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added more onion than stated, as well as a few minced cloves of garlic; however, the filling is very bland. For the sauce, I used 2/3 pasta sauce and 1/3 stewed tomatoes.

I ended up with a little too much water in the bottom of my baking dish.  The flavor was great though.

This recipe is really good! I only had to make 1 change and it was to add more tomato sauce. I also cooked it on high for about 3-4 hours instead of on low as suggested.

These were good, but did not compare to what mom used to make.  I used dirty rice instead of white and used some V-8 in the sauce.  Everyone in my family loved them. My husband suggested next time just cut up the cabbage and cook it all together with the rice, sauce and ground beef.  That would definitely be easier!  I think next time I will try that.  Overall, these were good, but a little too much trouble.

I liked this dish, although I found that I had a lot of meat left over for some reason.  My husband wasn't too fond of the dish because he felt the sauce was too sour.

We used the recipe exactly and it was TERRIBLE! The rolls on the top and sides were burnt to a crisp and the ones that weren't burnt were so bland. I looked forward to this all day and I am so incredibly disappointed.

I can't really give this a fair rating because I cooked this on the stove top rather than in the crockpot. I also altered the recipe, using boiled, shredded cabbage and adding that to the rest of the mix. Nevertheless, it was a great combination and next time I will try it as written.

I work nights and am ALWAYS looking for crockpot recipes.  My hubby said he enjoyed it.  I sleep through dinner, so I ate it for lunch later.  It was good the second (first) time around for me.  I wish I had gotten more sauce, but that could have just been my hubby not putting it in the container he put my lunch in.  Anyways, we'll make it again!

My husband and kids were not impressed with this dinner.  I 3x the recipe so I had no problems with sticking or rolls being over cooked.  Just not a winner in my home.  I thought it was okay.  Maybe my family would have liked it more if it had been more of a sweet and sour sauce?

This was my first time trying to make cabbage rolls and this recipe was an easy one to follow, although it seems I need more practice rolling!  I started them a little late in the day so I put them in the slow cooker on high for 4 and a half hours and they still turned out fine.  Also I had doubled the recipe and had more meat mixture than cabbage leaves so I made a nice little french meatloaf with the leftovers.  Good recipe!

made these with a few tweaks as other reviews suggested, doubled the sauce, used some fresh garlic and cooked them in the oven.  However I'm going camping with the family so I'll try them in the crock pot and I'm sure they will be just as yummy

I thought these were very good the only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is that the meat mixture was TERRIBLY bland and that was even adding some extra stuff too (garlic, more pepper, onion powder, Alpine Touch seasoning) Maybe I just chose the wrong seasonings but with adding the extra sauce ( I doubled the sauce recipe and then added about 4 small cans of Spicy V-8 juice) it was fine.  Very, very good.  Baked covered at 350 for about 45 minutes and then uncovered for last 15 minutes.  Sauce was a little runny but I'm sure that was because of the V-8.  Will make again!

My picky husband LOVES this recipe.  Wild rice instead of white or brown rice makes all the difference.  The next time, I'm just going to shred the cabbage and layer it under the meat filling.  Boiling the cabbage and removing outer leaves after boiling is too much work.

This was ok, but not as good as expected.  I followed the reviews and used onion soup mix.  I made the mistake of using the whole packet and it was way too much.  Next time I'll use 1/2 packet.  I also added some garlic powder and made a couple of stuffed green peppers and some cabbage rolls.  I doubled the sauce like everyone suggested, but i also put v8 juice in the bottom of the pan.  Will definately make this again and tweak a little.  Recipe was a good base.

I thought these had pretty good flavor...I omitted the lemon juice and sugar, and used soy sauce instead of worchestershire sauce (didn't have any), and steamed the whole cabbage in the boiling water as a couple of other reviewers mentioned.  That tip alone made making cabbage rolls a lot easier.  Husband didn't care for it, but then again, he is not a big cabbage fan.

These are a HUGE hit over here!  My mother just asked me to make them in a smaller version as Christmas appetizers.  Yummy!

This was delicious!! As per the suggestions of others, I doubled the sauce ingredients. It was perfect! I can't imagine not doubling it, there was just the right amount of sauce to spoon over the cabbage roll when served!

Time consuming but worth it to have a nice warm dinner when we got home. My only complaint is the lack of flavor, these were pretty bland... I would make this again, however adding tons more salt, pepper, spices, etc.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Added saurkraut to bottom of pot, laying rolls ontop, and placing bacon ontop of rolls. They turned out ALMOST as good as my oma's cooking! Thank you for sharing.

Bland with a capital B! I even added extra spices than what the recipe called for and it was still barely edible. However, my 2yr old liked it with lots of ketchup

This was wonderful!  My husband raved about it, and he's really picky.  THe flavor was good, it was nice and moist, and it was easy.  The only problem I had was peeling the cabbage leaves to make them able to stuff, but that was no reflection of this wonderful recipe.  I also doubled the sauce recipe, as noted by an earlier reviewer, and my family found these to be moist and tastey.

This was very good.  I took everyone's advice and doubled the sauce.  It had a little too much black pepper, so I am going to reduce that amount next time.

We made this the other night and we really enjoyed it!  I decided to double the amount of sauce.  I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day!  Next time I'm doubling the whole recipe!

My husband and I just thought this dish was OK.  We thought the rolls were kind of bland, but I will make this again, only with more seasoning in the meat mixture next time.  It was definitely a quick dinner.

The flavor was ok I guess, but I didn't really like the dish overall.  It came out kind of soggy and bland.
