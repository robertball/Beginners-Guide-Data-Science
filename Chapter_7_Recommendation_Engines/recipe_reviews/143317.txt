This recipe was so easy to make.  It tated awesome....The only thing I did different was I didn't mix the cocktail sauce in with the crab meat and cream cheese. I figured not everyone likes cocktail sauce, so I put that and sweet and sour sauce in seperate bowls that way people that dip the ragoon in what ever they perfered.  I higly recommend this recipe for any party!!!

Drop the cocktail sauce, chop half a bunch of green onions, add a half teaspoon of garlic powder along with a pinch of ginger and you have a winner.

This was just wonderful. My roommate and I couldn't stop eating them. My only regret was not buying two packages of crescent rolls!  Very easy to make healthy if you substitute cream cheese and crescent rolls for the fat free/reduced fat variation! I will be making again!

I thought that they were missing something, definitely need something added to them.  I would not recommend using your lump crabmeat for this recipe, use it for crab cakes instead.

Dear wife and I made these together and fell in love with this recipe. So easy to make that she's already added cream cheese, crab meat & crescent rolls to the grocery list for next week. The only thing different we did was fine chop some green onions to the mixture. Next week can't get here soon enough.

Served them up for dinner tonight. So good! I left out the cocktail sauce, added in finely chopped onion and used imitation crab meat. Turned out great! I really rolled the rolls out to almost twice the original size and since I halved the recipe, was able to easily divide the mixture in the bowl into eighths, so no leftover crab mixture. That made them more a dinner size serving. The ratio of crab to cream cheese was higher than I've had in restaurants, but we liked it better this way! 2 T onion for the half recipe.

I added a teaspoon of chopped garlic and scallions.Left the cocktail sauce for dipping. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. My friends loved it! Only reason for not getting 5 stars is that I altered the recipe.
