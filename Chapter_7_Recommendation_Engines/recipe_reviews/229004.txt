THIS IS A PERFECT RECIPE FOR FRESH LATE SUMMER PEACHES TOO.  SPRINKLE SOME CINNAMON OVER THE TOP FOR A MORE FALL FLAVOR & A NICE FINISHING TOUCH.   I MADE IT FOR MY HUBBY'S POKER GROUP OF 7 GUYS & I WAS LUCKY TO SCRAPE A TINY SERVING FOR MYSELF.   THANKS FOR SHARING...WONDERFUL & EASY!

I would recommend this simple recipe for pretty much any type of fruit.  I always hate when people give reviews but then change up the recipe...but, yes, I did that same thing with this one.  I used strawberries instead of peaches, and it came out WONDERFUL.  LOVE IT!

I make this recipe often for an assisted living home.  I melt the butter in a microwave and then drizzle it over the cake mix.  Then drag a fork lightly over the cake mix to evenly distribute the butter.

I used peach slices in light syrup and a boxed white cake (that's what I had on hand), and only half a cup of butter. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on both the peaches and on top (next time I'll just add it to the peaches). I probably could have evened out the cake mix better, as there were a few spots that stayed powdery, but they vanished when you scoop this somewhat messy cake out. 

Easy, fast, sweet, and the hubby enjoyed his evening snack.

This is amazingly good and so easy to make! I had to keep mine in the oven for about 50 minutes before it turned golden brown. (But that may be just my oven.) I think this would also work well with just about any flavor of pie filling. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The butter sat like globs on top of the cake mix.  The cake mix was still powdery after baking for nearly an hour.

Great recipe! I too am guilty of tweaking! I used Spice Cake, Lucky Brand Lite Peaches and sweet potatoes. Seasoned with a pinch of salt, loads of cinnamon, and a little dark brown sugar. Melted Lite Bonnet Butter (one stick) drizzles over the cake topping and baked for 20min. When I checked it at 20 some buttered parts were browning (majority) and a few other spots were still powder. Solution was doing a water mix with a little brown sugar and pour a little less than half a cup over the cake in and around the dry areas, let it back 20 more minutes, and perfection!!!

This recipe is perfect for my lifestyle! I'm a busy collage student but I try really hard to make a home cooked meal as often as possible and these cake/cobblers are the perfect final (and my favorite) course! I made this just like the recipe only I added fresh Strawberry's and doubled the peaches and it was AMAZING! my family is asking me to make this (or variants of it) for every gathering we have now! Oh andi also used Betty crocker French vanilla cake mix, I highly recommend it :-)

So easy, and delish! We made one with a can of crushed pineapple and 4 sliced peaches and loved it so much we made it again last night with a big jar of peach preserves. So easy, my 9 10 year old daughter made last nights and was so proud of how it turned out!

I made this last night. It was pretty good. I would've added a little brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the peaches if it were MY recipe. but this was tasty enough. Some of the peices of cake were rather hard and crunchy but I welcomed that contrast in textures. Next time I'll try this with a crumb cake and the additional items I mentioned above. This is a keeper!!!

I was confused by this recipe at first because it does not state whether you mix the cake as stated on the box or if you just dump the powder on top. I saw some reviews that talked about the powder, so I just went with that. I have made this twice. The first time I used the pan size recommended and one large can of peaches and dumped the whole bag of (white) cake mix on top, sprinkled a little cinnamon. The taste was really, really good. However, the cake mix was mushy and soggy in many areas, and then crumbly in others. A lot of mush in fact, more much than peach. The second time, I used a slightly smaller dish, doubled the peaches, forgot the cinnamon, left maybe a half a cup of (yellow) cake mix out, and poked it a little with a knife to get the powder down into the peach juice. I thought the second time was much better. I thought the cinnamon was missed, the flavor cake mix made no difference, and there was less mush. I think next time I will omit even more cake mix, having just enough to cover the peaches and definitely add some cinnamon. It's not a perfect "peach cobbler" which is what we've been calling it, but it is good!

I have made this before and it's great! I have found that I like to melt the butter for the top though -- it's easier! This time I substituted canned apricots for peaches (had A LOT of apricots) and it was really good too!!

This is a GREAT and EASY recipe. This is my second time making it and the first time was a learning experience. Like most are saying it was too sweet and had dry spots but we still ate it. This time I used half of box of cake mix and one can of natural juice and one can of heavy syrup peaches and I also frozen the butter and grated the butter to cover the mix.  It turned out PERFECT!

Made as written the 1st time and it is very good.   Here are improvements I made with additional bakings: melt the butter and drizzle it so it has better coverage. The finished cake can have some powder on top, so after a few minutes (about 10) take the pan out of the oven and drag a fork through the powdering patches to spread out.  You could probably also drizzle more butter on those spots if needed.  I have made it with peaches in light syrup, also very good.  (I use the cheapest canned peaches I can buy.)

This was much better the next day. I made mine with one large can of peaches, draining off half the liquid before dumping in my pan, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, one box of yellow "butter" cake mix and I did what others suggested by placing a stick of butter in the freezer beforehand and grating it over the cake mix making sure everything was covered. NOTHING about this reads "cake" but it's rather more of a "Dump Crumble" as the top gets pretty crisp and crunchy. Next time I will do as other reviews suggested and prepare the cake mix before pouring over peaches for a more "cake-like" dessert.

I will definitely make it again.  I used frozen peaches since I had no canned peaches on hand.  I sprinkled cinnamon over the peaches first.  I've made cherry dump cakes before and had the pats of butter melt unevenly, so I tried melting the butter and drizzling it over the cake mix, then swirling it around with a fork to distribute it and mix it together.  This turned out much better  for me.  I think I will try this with apples at some point.  This is a wonderful pot luck dessert!

at 35 minutes the cake wasn't even set, butter was floating on top. it was jiggling.  

I had to continue baking for 20 more minutes.  

I let it set for 15 minutes and it set up better. But not what I expected

I'm not going to make it again

Made no changes--turned out great--you should cut the stick and a half of butter (my choice) or margarine thin enough so you will have 3 rows lengthwise on your cake --if you have a window to see thru on your oven--check to make certain no floury areas remain,  if they do, melt a touch of butter and cover it though with three rows of butter dabs there is not much chance of it.  only thing that happened was that I thought the  cobbler/cake mix part was not crusty enough--then I recalled that since I moved in with daughter and her family, in UT (alt-5100 ft) i should add a tablespoon of flour to any cake mixes or recipes that I prepare.  I have also make this for Church Dinners with a 1/4 of sugar sprinkled on top for sweetness but at home I usually use ice cream or whipped cream so I don't do that.  My late hubs preferred with sugar and cinnamon mixed together and sprinkled.  this simple recipe can probably be altered in many ways--but I don't think pears have the right amount of sweetness but will be trying with fruit cocktail. . .might even try with pie filling though I think it would take two cans.

This was a hit.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and melted the butter and drizzled it over the top.  We used a can with light syrup and it tasted good.  I’ll make this again!

I do wish these cooks, with such lovely recipes, would state whether the cake mix they spread over the fruit was directly from the box, or made into the cake batter first.
I made a bundt pan dump cake last night, but not knowing which cake mix was spread, just dumped the peaches into the prepared batter of the cake...2 cans--15.25 each. It came out marvelous, with a cinnamon/sugar 'frosting' I spread on top in the last 20 minutes of baking.

I use recipes as a guide, but then alter them to my own tastes. I have made this as the original recipes says.  But the top was powdery and dry and did not turn out well.  So I modified it and it is EXCELLENT!  I use a large (29 oz.) can of sliced peaches in their own juice, but I cut them into smaller pieces.  Then I added about a cup of frozen blueberries.  I only pour in about half the peach juice.  Then I sprinkle the cake mix on top of the fruit.  I melt 1/2 cup butter and add the remaining peach juice to the butter.  I pour this over the top of the cake mix.  It is thoroughly saturated with the liquid.  Then I sprinkle it with cinnamon.  I bake for about 50 min. It is more like a cobbler, but it is FANTASTIC!

I used three cans of peaches as some have suggested, but the syrup of only two of the cans. I had to cook the cakes more than one hour to try to thicken the  fluid, and by that time it was still liquidy and the cake was dry and tough.

Looked easy enough for my son (Teen that doesn’t like to cook) to do so I had him make dessert. Everyone raved and gave him a boost for cooking. He believes the cake may have been a little too soggy so he suggests using half the liquid (and we agreed). He’s already looking forward to making it again!

I have make this for family and friends, everyone loves it!!  I’ve done it with apples too!  That may be my favorite. I also add cinnamon to whatever fruit as it needs a little “something”. And don’t worry about the dry spots, they mix in when you serve it and it is just incredible!  Add some vanilla ice cream and you have a heavenly dessert!!

I made this but added 4 medium fresh white peaches, a can of peach pie filling, as well as the canned peaches. I used 11/2 T. cornstarch and sprinkled cinnamon sugar lightly in the bowl and mixed it up well. Put in a baking pan and dumped the cake mix on top and put sliced butter oats all over the top. Served with whipped cream.  FANTASTIC!!!!!  TRIPLE PEACH DUMP CAKE

I have never made a dump cake before, and hubs wanted something sweet. The only ingredients I had was a 28 ounce can of sliced peaches in heavy syrup, and a cinnamon swirl coffee cake mix, and organic coconut oil spread. Here's what I did; I melted the coconut oil spread until melted in the microwave, mixed in 1/4 teaspoon of butter flavoring that is used to flavor frosting. I mixed in a full capful of real bourbon vanilla into the peaches with some of the heavy syrup drained off in the bottom of a 8 x 8 sized glass baking dish. I mixed the dry cinnamon brown sugar topping into the cake mix ,and poured that on top. I finished it by pouring the coconut oil spread on the top and with a fork, swirled into the dry cake mixture. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out more like a chewy fruit crisp, but not at all dry and powdery as some reviewers mentioned theirs was.  We liked the taste pretty good. Id like to make this again except, using cherry pie filling and yellow cake mix with melted butter.

This is a delicious recipe.  For a less sweet alternative I used frozen fruit which was just as good.  Lastly, for the adults I sprinkled each serving with a tsp. of peach flavored bourbon ; -).  Let's just say there was nothing left.

My hubby found the recipe so we got the ingredients and I put it together ..... very simple , I have made something similar but in a slow cooker . What I did a little different was I used a little bit more butter on top . I basically covered the top with small cubes of butter . And added cinnamon on top at the end of baking .

I liked it, it turned out great. Only thing is they was some dry cake mix so when I make it again I may mix it. To distribute the batter and the peaches . Use the extra cake mix and butter on to to make a crust. 

I did add cinnamon onto the peaches too.

I am in the process of making this right now, I only had a LEMON cake mix, I'll let you know how this turns out.
