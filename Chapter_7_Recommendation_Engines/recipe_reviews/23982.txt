I liked this recipe. This is the first homemade tomato sauce i've attempted. I did puree it afterwards and it thickened up. It's easy and you can add what you like to adjust taste.

I made this while babysitting one night. The parents had left some nasty frozen chicken strips for me to make and I just couldn't feed them such junk. Both girls just loved this! I left out the onion (cuz they didn't have one), but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I can't wait to make this for my fiance'.

I made this recipe because I'm vegetarian and wanted to use up tomatoes from my neighbor. I thought I would make it and freeze it. But, it was so good that I ate some as soon as it was done. This will not make it to the freezer!

The sauce was great!! We used a large can of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes since that's what we had. We also blended the sauce at the end instead of leaving it chunky. Oh and we used 3 cloves of garlic since we like garlic :). We'll be making this again!

This was pretty good sauce. I let the green pepper out as I don't like the flavor, but everything else I kept in. I simmered this for a bit longer than 20 minutes to get it thick, but the flavor turned out pretty tasty served over wagon wheels.

Some of the best sauce I've had in awhile, and very simple to make. I sub'd 1 serrano pepper diced for 1 small green bell pepper diced which kicked up the heat a bit and made for quite a delicious meal. Spicy!

This is a great recipe! I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, double the garlic because I love it, a little extra tomato and fresh basil and oregano instead of dried. I also added about a cup of diced baby bella mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and garlic. I blended the sauce in my food processor after cooking for a while which thickened it up. So yummy and highly recommended!

FANTASTIC!  I strongly dislike tomatoes and onions, but needed to use up the ones I had received in my weekly co-op.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted 1 tbsp fresh basil for the dried.  I pureed the sauce after it had simmered for awhile and the result was truly the best pasta sauce I have ever had.

Not terribly impressed. Edible but not spectacular. Came out very watery, had to add cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

took some others advice and doubled the garlic + added mushrooms.  Also put 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne in there to spice it up a bit... we just love spicy food.  Depending on how spicy you want it I may recommend 1/4 teaspoon and build from there.  Awesome love the fullness of it, the liquid soaks through to flavor the noodles and the solids give you a great topping for your spoon fulls.

This is a great, simple, fast recipe for a delicious pasta sauce.  I used 2 red peppers and blended everything after cooking.  Great taste and texture!

I've made this sauce a few times and it always turns out great. After simmering, it has too many tomato pieces in it along with the other stuff, so i had to puree it in my blender. still, very yummy! thank you Diane!

I love this recipe! I've made it several times and couldn't seem to get the consistency of the original photo with just using tomatoes so each time I've made it I used 1 small can of salt free tomato sauce. Besides that small issue, everything else is PERFECT. I refuse to use bottled sauce from now on. This was super easy and tastes fantastic! I eat it over spaghetti squash.

Good starting base for a sauce, like a few people said I blended it up to make it more saucy which helps. I think for myself I would add more peppers and maybe chilli but all in all its a brilliant, effortlessly easy bass to make!

Loved it. It was divine. The recipe came out perfect. I used Village Farm's "Heavenly Villagio Marzano® Tomatoes." To get a thick sauce you have to use plum tomatoes or, if you use regular tomatoes, you have to allow time to boil the sauce down. This recipe will be one of my favorites!

This was alright, but I had to add both salt and more herbs. I liked the thickness though.

Made it exactly as it said and loved it. It's not super thick or anything, but it tastes amazing and it coated all of the noodles regardless of not being thick.

I made 2/3 of the recipe and still had more than enough for three portions (I used two cans of diced tomatoes - probably too much).
It wasn't ready after 20 minutes of simmering on medium-low heat (tasted rather raw). I had to increase the heat and give it another several minutes. It tasted really good after that.

Pretty bland.  I needed to add some sugar to the tomatoes I used.  Had to reduce for a looong time.

I recently decided to go vegan, and this is my first attempt at making a pasta sauce, period. I don't really cook often, so I was surprised at how wonderfully beautiful the sauce turned out. My eyes nearly popped out of their sockets when I taste-tested the sauce during its simmer. Thank you so much for posting this!

This was very good. I used tomatoes from my garden that I had ripened off of the vine. We doubled the pepper and garlic, but otherwise followed the directions. After we cooked it, we added 2 tsps of Splenda to sweeten it. On top of whole grain spaghetti, it was a very tasty lunch.  As soon as I have more ripened tomatoes I'm going to make it again.

This was pretty good.  I wasn't sure what kind and size of tomatoes to use and I think I may have used too much.  It tasted rather "tomatoey".  I added some extra spices and it turned out good.
