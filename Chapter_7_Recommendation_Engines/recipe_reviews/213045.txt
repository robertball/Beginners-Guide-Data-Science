I am the originator of the recipe.  When I make my sauce, I use 2 Tablespoons (not teaspoons) of vinegar.  It gives it just the right kick!  Enjoy!

***If you want to bake them instead of frying*** DO NOT use 1/2 c butter- it makes a huge mess!! I had to blot them off, put them on a new pan and then cook them some more so that they were edible. If you are going to bake them use only 1 tablespoon butter- bake at 375- 350 for around 15- 20 mins. I also added some onion in my mixture.

This recipe appeared too good to be true to wait until game day so having all the ingredients on hand we did a preview! I had saved half of a rotisserie chicken from my fav grocery store which cut waaaay down on prep time.  Followed recipe didn't change a thing and it is beyond delicious. The vinegar and hot pepper sauce gave it just the right kick.  I saw one grand child with one in each hand and wanted to take a photo but had to wait for batteries to be re-charged and by the time I got back to the camera, there were not enough wontons left on the platter to take a decent photo!  Ranch dressing was the nibblers choice and I was informed that this could be a Super Bowl tradition any ole time I felt like it!!

I love love love to make wontons. they are such a perfect/easy appetizer! These were great, i did make a few changes. I did not use the vinegar or butter. I just use franks red hot buffalo sauce. I also put some blue cheese and ranch dressing in the mixture along with some shredded cheese. I do not fry these either,  i brush some olive oil on them and put them in the oven at 475 for 10 minutes! they come out awesome!

Wow - these are worth the calories! I used only 1/4 cup of butter, and it didn't hurt the final product at all. I also sprayed the wontons with Pam after stuffing, then sprinkled with kosher salt and baked at 375° for 15 minutes. Served with blue cheese dressing - fantastic, everyone really loved them! Next time I try these, I will combine the cream cheese with the chicken filling before stuffing the wontons. Great recipe, perfect for watching football!

These were great.  I made them for a party last night, and everyone brought an appetizer, mine was the first to go. I made them the night before and baked them for 10 minutes, then refrigerated over night, then at the party, I baked them for 15 minutes. YUM

So good!! Just made these for a potluck today! They where the 1st to go! Only thing I did different was that I didn't have time to let the sauce sit an hour so I just added the chicken right after it was done and I didn't fry them, I baked them at 350 degress for 10-20 mins. Will deffinatly be making these again very soon!!

I just made this for a family get together and it was a hit!  I used 1/2 the butter, no vinegar and baked them for 15 minutes at 400.  We dipped them in bleu cheese dressing.  It made a lot, so the extra dip I baked and served with tortilla chips and it was awesome as well.

I used this filling to wrap in phyllo triangles along with the spanikopita ones on the Smitten Kitchen site.  They were a huge hit and not so hot that the kids couldn't enjoy them.  (Use more hot sauce and less butter to make them hotter.)  I used Frank's Hot Sauce, which is THE sauce to use for buffalo chicken.  I also increased the amount of chicken in each triangle and, since I was using phyllo, I baked them at 375 for 25 minutes.  I'm going to have to make these for every party now.

This is great! I used the recipe exactly how it was and we loved it! 1/2 tsp of each is not enough filling. I had a bunch of room left in the center, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Great job!

Fixed with the intent to bake rather than fry. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and reduced the butter to 1 T. The butter is needed to firm up the sauce, but I think it could be reduced to 1 tsp and the sauce refrigerated for an hour. 1 T still made the won tons greasy. I sealed the won tons with water instead of egg and they stayed together. I placed them on parchment paper, which helped crisp then up. I also sprayed with olive oil non stick spray. I baked at 375 degrees for 10 minutes, then turned them and baked another 10 minutes. They were only slightly soft and I think with less butter they would be even crisper. The flavor a were wonderful, but a bit spicy for me. My husband thought they were just right. They were a real treat and I will definitely fix again. Thanks

I tried to make these a few weeks ago, but could not find wonton wrappers (I live in Northern Ontario), so I wrapped the insides with rice paper (I submitted a picture of it) and baked them for about 10 minutes, they were yummy! When I visit my parents in Toronto next, I will find wonton wrappers and try the recipe again!!

These were fabulous!  My whole family loved them; we ate them as a main dish.  I tried baking one batch and decided to fry the rest because the baked ones were a bit tough and chewy.  I definitely put enough olive oil before I baked them, too.  I cut the butter by half, as some recommended, otherwise made exactly as directed.  I was also careful to measure the amount of chicken in the wonton wrapper and it worked perfectly.  Don't like how time-consuming it is to make, but it is worth the outcome!

I took the idea of chicken wontons and ran with it in my own direction. I used a pre-made buffalo sauce mixed with a little bit of sour cream and a bit of ranch dressing mix with the shredded chicken.  Then, I sprayed my muffin tin and lined with wonton wrappers. I filled the wrappers up with the buffalo chicken mixture, topped with a sprinkle of shredded cheese and baked it in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  They turned out nice and crispy.  My husband and I both enjoyed them.  We ate them with celery, ranch dressing, and mac and cheese.

As my 14 year old picky daughter said "These are amazing!" I have made these twice and they were gobbled up each time. I did not bother chilling the sauce. I added the cream cheese to the sauce and roughly blended together. Then I added chicken and let it sit for about 10 minutes. This worked perfect. Make sure you only use a tsp of filling as noted otherwise it comes out the sides. I also just used water to seal wontons. Thank you so much for this recipe! I was thinking of a lot of other fillers that would go well with the wontons!

Very good, but very hard to accomplish.  I admit that it was my first time trying to work with wonton wrappers, but I failed completely at this recipe.  I actually filled about a dozen wrappers and tried frying them, but they refused to stay closed.  We ended up wrapping the filling up in crescent dough and baking it.  The flavors were awesome, but if you have never worked with wonton wrappers or something similar, I do recommend using the crescent dough idea.

My husband LOVED these.  I wanted to use up the rest of my rotisserie chicken and this was just the ticket.  I didn't bother letting the sauce cool for an hour--just a few minutes in the refrigerator.  Also, I added the cream cheese in with the sauce just to speed things up.  Baked instead of fried.  Too zippy for me but will make again soon for my husband.

I made this with a group of middle schoolers and it turned out great!! They loved it so much and everyone was asking for the recipe. The only hard that was part with kids was the obvious frying, but besides that they had fun trying to form the wontons. I used Siriachia (sp?) sauce as the pepper sauce and still had a really good taste to ours. Making it again for the family today and am anticipating the same reaction

I made these for my families annual christmas eve get together and they were a hit!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My only complaint is that they seem to lose some of the filling during frying.  I would like to make these again, and try baking them.

YUM! Made exactly as written and dipped with HOMEMADE HIDDEN VALLEY DRESSING mix. I think I may have eaten the whole batch practically on my own!

these were very good,  I also made them in to potstickers.  cut the butter in 1/2, didn't use egg to seal just water.  then for potstickers, heat metal pan over mid/high heat lightly oiled place the wontons in the pan w/o over crowding. cook for 2 min. after 2 min pour a small amount of beer into the pan an cover tightly for another 2 min remove and serve

I made these tonight and the boyfriend and i loved them. i made them with half chicken and half tiny diced carrots, and used franks red hot sauce instead of pepper sauce and butter and they were SO GOOD. fortunately, the recipe made about a million of them so we have extras to freeze.

These are fantastic! I had Buffalo Chicken Rolls leftover so I chopped them up and mixed in the creamcheese. Baked at 350 for 10 minutes. Delicious!

These were fantastic!  Really super easy to make and totally satisfied my craving for buffalo wings which is great since I dislike chicken on a bone but love the spicy chicken taste! :)  I baked them instead of fried them and they were still wonderful.  The second time I made these, I used egg roll wrappers instead of wonton wrappers which tasted the same but saved me a bunch of prep-work time.  Thanks for the idea and recipe!

I brought this recipe to a play off party (stored in a crock pot with a paper towel under the lid so the condensation would not make the wontons soggy).  They were gone in 20 minutes.  Rave reviews.  I will definitely make these again and might try - just out of healthy curiousity - baking rather than frying.

I made these for a Packer party and they were a hit! First I deep fried them at home and then finished them in the oven at my hostesses house. I also add a little bit of sour cream and about 3 tbl of dry ranch dressing mix. It gives it a little zip.

If a way to a man's heart is through his stomach -- these will SURELY win your man over!  I made these for our weekend "cards crew" and ALL the guys raved.  In fact, they're STILL talking about them!  The only change I made -- based on an earlier suggestion -- was to mix crumbled Danish blue cheese into the softened cream cheese (Neufchatel).  On request, I served with chilled ranch dressing for dipping.  Definitely a new house favorite!  Thank you, Cookin' Fool!!

These were wonderful!  I mixed the softened cream cheese in with the buffalo sauce, which worked well.  Also, I made both triangles and the wonton ball shape... the ball shape was much better.

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but it didn't turn out how I hoped. We couldn't taste the hot sauce. It was just like chicken with cream cheese once they fried up. I might try them in the oven next time and see if it holds the flavor better.

We love buffalo chicken wings and this had good flavor.  I liked the vinegar in the sauce.  I added some diced celery, and baked instead of frying.  As many commented, I found there was too much butter.  I would cut it in half next time.  It oozed out all over the cookie sheet.  I don't know if I would have had different results had I fried the wontons as the recipe called for, so that may have impacted my results.

Hit of the party.  Make these often! True Buffalo Wing fans will only use Frank's red hot for this one or any chicken wing recipe.  Use less butter for increased hotness, use lots of butter for the general population.

I really can't say enough good things about these!  I would eat them all the time, if they weren't so bad for me.  Why does something that tastes so good have to be so bad for you?  I used a little less butter, but I have tried baking wontons before and they are just not that good.  I didn't read the directions very carefully and completely skipped over the part about letting the sauce rest for an hour, but it seemed to work out just fine.  I served with ranch dressing.  Amazing!  If I could give these more stars, I would!  Thanks!

Great apps for Packers' Game Day!  I had 10 people ask for the recipe and the wontons were gone by half time.  As stated in some other reviews, cut the amount of butter at least in half in your going bake.

Whoa, these are really good.  I wasn't sure what to expect, the recipe was so different from what I normally make.  I had some left over wontons from a soup I made a few weeks ago and I needed to use them for something but didn't have enough for more soup.  Some of the wontons edges were kind of hard, so I threw away the hard parts and some of these ended up bite size.  But I loved them.

I'm really impressed.  Thanks for the recipe.  Really glad I have it in case I have left over wontons again

Delicous!!!  Slight Substitution. Thought I had enough hot pepper sauce required (Tabasco) 1/2 cup,  but realized I only had 1/4 cup of hot pepper sauce so I added 1/4 cup asian hot chilli pepper sauce. (WOW!!HOT!!!)  I loved it.  Some members of my family were sweating.  Served with ranch as one reviewer suggested.  We had this for a main course with zucchini on the side.  Recipe ingredients definetly enough for a party for we had lots leftover to make for another meal. Thanks

Messy but yummy!  Might have purchased the wrong size wontons as we ended up with a good amount of filling leftover and about 1/3 of the cream cheese as well.  We put the "leftovers" together and microwaved on low...made a great dip for Bugles tonight.  Thanks!

This is the first recipe I have reviewed, I cannot say how much my family loved these!  They are time consuming, but WELL WORTH the effort.

These are awesome!   A little time consuming to wrap the wontons, but so delicious.  A bit hit.

I used one rotisserie chicken (white and dark) plus a large can of chicken but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written which was super easy. 

I made 40 wontons and still had leftover chicken! Our football guests raved. The teenage boys asked for  if we had any leftovers to take home. I will absolutely make this again.

fantastic recipe, I used my air fryer at 370 for 5 minutes and brushed some egg on the outside for that perfect crunch

I fried them in a deep fryer. Only takes about two to three minutes with oil at 350 degrees. I threw in immediately after wrapping won tons and they held up perfect, no need to refrigerate or freeze. I did half the batch in standard triangles, saw on you tube “how to fold won ton “ videos... you can get more filling in with other easy techniques, folding opposite corners up to the middle, then do the same with the other two opposite corners... kinda like a hersheys kiss pyramid shape. I liked that better

Pretty good for starters... Over the course of evolution I cook the chicken in a vinegar/water/wing sauce mixture (I prefer the pressure cooker...) and add wing sauce to cream cheese, garlic powder and onion powder. (all to taste) Instead of using egg to act as a glue, moistened fingers and water will seal the edges like nothing else and is much easier to apply than brushing on egg. Deep frying makes them impossible to resist eating while cooking.

These are very good, I deep fried them, and I just used water to seal the edges instead of egg whites.  Simple to make also, just a bit messy once the wonton wrappers start getting wet but worth it for the end product.  Thanks for the recipe

I baked instead of fried and they were still very greasy. They were tasty and we liked them but I would never bring them to or serve them at a party. Just too oily.

Took these to a cookout last night and they were a hit.  I also baked them but I will try cooking in oil next time.  Served with carrot sticks and blue cheese dressing. Yummy!!!  (to save time I did buy a rotisserie chicken and use Texas Pete wing sauce)

Not the easiest app to make, but it is very tasty.  Get ready for a mess then enjoy some good finger food.

YUMMM, we made these with egg roll wrappers instead of wonton wrappers (not a big difference), and WOW! Yummy, yummy! This is the kind of junk food that we like! We will definitely be making these again! Surprisingly, they weren't even that greasy, and I was concerned that they would be super vinegar-y, but they were perfect after we fried them!

Very tasty! These were a big hit for our Superbowl Party. I used water to seal the wontons instead of egg white- just a personal preference though, I'm sure egg whites work well, too.

No one cared for this at all. The pepper sauce overpowered.  Very disappointed for our super bowl party.
