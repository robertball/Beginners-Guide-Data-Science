This recipe is a great base, however it needs some extra seasoning. I switched out spinach for cilantro because I didn't have spinach on hand. I would make this again!

I used chicken broth instead of water for more flavor and everybody liked it.  This was a side to baked salmon fillets.

Awesome. I substituted Olive Oil for butter, and unsalted Chicken Broth for water. Also I squeezed some fresh lemon juice over top when I seasoned my portion since I can't get enough of acidic foods, then ate the lemon while I ate the Quinoa. Most people probably would find that unappetizing, but I could eat lemons for days.

Definitely making this again. I think I'll use a smaller garlic clove. I used a large one and it was a bit too much.
