Great Gluten Free recipe. I used four large chicken breasts.  The amount of coating could have been cut in half, butI saved it to the fridge to use on fish with the same concept.  Also, I used light olive oil rather than butter, conserves calories, and serves the purpose with no loss of flavor.  Wacky me also just forgot to take off the skin, and it still worked great... so much for healthier.... Kid and hubby loved it tasted like the store bought kievs, they said... great... a compliment that it tastes like store bought... oh well.  Meat was juicy which is not always the case for breasts.  Enjoy.

So happy to have found this Taste of Home recipe again!!  Lost the mag in a move and have very much missed it!  It's a staple again in our family.  The parm cheese really adds an extra something, the seasonings are just perfect.

The flavor and texture was good, and it complimented the alfredo pasta I served it with very well.
 
For whatever reason I didn't get that nice gold color. I'm not sure if I needed to let it bake longer, or if I needed to use more butter.

To the lady that said about saving the leftover rub for later use, I don't know if that's a good idea, especially after dipping raw chicken in it. Not sure if it is, but I'd be careful.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  It browned up very nicely.  However, there was an overabundance of the potato flake mix which I think cut down on the flavor.  I will try 1 1/2 cups of potato flakes instead next time.  Otherwise, a very good recipe!

This was VERY good and very moist.  My children and husband gobbled it up.  Though, to cut out on the fat, I melted 1-1/2 tablespoons of butter and coated each chicken with a basting brush and then dipped it in the coating.  Worked great...though I only had a 2lbs chicken too so you may want to use a little more butter for a bigger chicken.  I also had a lot of leftover coating (I had cut it down too because of the smaller chicken) but maybe because I didn't actually dip the chicken in butter?  Anywho....it was great! Will definitely use again!!

My husband declared this 'A good bird!' which is his highest chicken compliment. He had no problems eating golden baked chicken even as left overs for three days in a row. Enough said.

i love this recipe for being a much healthier alternative to frying chicken in oil, but it still gives you the same crispy coating you want!  very easy to make, my changes were to use skiness boneless chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken, and instead of dipping the chicken in butter i used egg whites (again to help the nutrition counts).  my kids devoured it and so did my hubby and myself.  thanks!

We liked this a lot!! I had a little more than 4 1/2 lbs of drums and thighs. The amount of potato flakes is much too much. I threw more than half of the mixture out. It was easy to get together once I got the skin off everything. Ewwwww. I hate that job.  It browned nicely.

This was SO GOOD, and SO EASY.  I can not believe how well this turned out.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe states...the only difference is that I put it under the broiler for about 3 minutes on low to get more color....delicious.  Thanks for the post.

Tasty and easy recipe.  I thought this recipe would be similar to baked chicken using Panko, but the texture was closer to fried chicken than any other recipe I have used.  This recipe is worth making the trip to the store to buy the potato flakes.

This was excellent.  The breading can get really mushy so make sure to remove the chicken after baking and dry it on a paper towel.

We didn't like the flavors.  It reminded me of when my mom used to put Shake and Bake on chicken once in a while when I was a kid.  The chicken was juicy though.  I won't make this again.

I didnt get the nice brown crispiness, but went back and read about the broiler tip.  Also we tend to like a little more spice. I feel it is a great basic to build on.   I think I will try with a spicy marinara on the side next time. Good recipe.

I scaled the recipe down to 2 and used 2 chicken leg quarters separated. The breading and butter amounts were perfect for that amount. Very good. Didn't have to flip the chicken. Served with Baked Cheesy Cauliflower and Roasted Potatoes and Greens also from this site. A delicious Sunday night dinner.

I just made this for my family and I used "butter flavored" potato flakes and a little less pepper than you called for but even my 11 yr old who eats NOTHING was actually making "yummy noises" while he ate 2 pieces. I have to say it is nice to have a meal without having to keep eat... eat... EAT! Thanks for sharing!!

this was OK. I tried it because i wanted a new backed chicken recipe and saw this one. i'm just not crazy about it. it tasted a little too cheesy for me, from the parmesan cheese. I only made a half recipe. over all it was good but don't know if i will make again.

Made this tonight for a very picky family, and it's a definite "will do again."  I might alternate some spice mixtures, but the base recipe makes the juiciest baked chicken, even breasts stayed exceptionally moist.

Flavor was good, but some of the breading was really mushy from the potato flakes.  Probably won't use this breading again.

I actually used this breading on haddock and it turned out excellent, only changes I made was I replaced the melted butter for lemon juice, then baked it at 500 degrees for 10 minutes on a wire rack.

Simple and easy. The whole family loved it. I used fresh pre-shredded parmesan that I ran through a food processor to get the grated texture. Mine had the beautiful golden color. It would be nice if this recipe included the nutritional info.

Used chicken breasts cut up into strips. Only had garlic mashed potato mix so I used that, omitted the garlic salt and just added a little salt. I also added minced onion. Instead of dipping in butter, I used egg whites. Also, after baking time finished I sprayed with cooking spray and broiled on low for 5 minutes. Served with Jack Daniels Honey Smokehouse BBQ sauce for dipping. Was delicious!! I am going to try it as sandwich on onion hamburger bun with the same BBQ sauce because the flavors went really well together. Thanks! This one is a keeper.

Husband liked this - I used a cheddar flavored instant potato mix. He liked that cheese flavor. Has requested to make it again. Only negative is that the edges of the chicken was a little tough - so I guess next time I'll reduce the cooking time by 5 minutes.

This was easy. I followed the directions exactly and my chicken came out golden brown. I am giving it 4 stars because that is what my family's ratings averaged out to. I gave it 5 stars, my kids gave it 4 and my husband gave it 3 stars. I would recommend giving this one a try. If my husband had liked it more, I would be making this one every week.

I too didn't get the lovely gold color, perhaps cooking longer may have been needed.  Good recipe, very mellow and the Parmesan makes it quite yummy.  Thanks for submitting! :)

I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and this recipe was great! No calories like fried chicken but almost the taste.  My Honey said "give this one a 5 star rating!

This chicken was absolutely delish!!!  The only different thing I did was to dip chicken into egg not butter.  The coating stayed on and it was juicy definetly not greasy...Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Having Celiac, I am always on the hunt for good, easy gluten free recipes that don't use expensive specialty products. This tasted really really good! My husband and I loved it. I didn't give it five stars only because it was kinda greasy. I think the next time I make this, I will try dipping the chicken in milk or buttermilk instead of butter.

Looks GREAT and taste Great! I think I would check on it a little sooner to see if its done next time.  I also will make sure I use salt.  I used Garlic Powder, not salt, thinking it was going to call for salt later. Then I forgot to put in Salt!  SO, I will make sure I use some salt next time, but it was healthier that way!

I used 4 lbs of split chicken breast, and found this to be a fabulous recipe! My kids, ranging from 22 years to 5 years old, cleaned their plates. 
It only took me about 5 minutes to prep, because I just kind of guesstimated the spices. Also, it went more quickly because I put a thin layer of the dry mixture in the pan, then layered the chicken on top. Over that I brushed 1/4 cup melted butter, then covered with the rest of the dry mixture and patted it into the chicken. I baked in convection for 40 minutes. It was Ah-mazing!!!

Excellent! Been looking for a good recipe for baked chicken and this one by far is the best. Did not change a thing except I had no onion powder, so I eliminated it.

Added a generous helping of crushed red pepper flakes to dry mix.  Lightly coated the pan with olive oil.  Baked at 425 for 25 minutes and turned for another 25 minutes.  Delicious and tender with a crunchy brown skin.  To check on doneness, cut into thickest part of meat and sure it is all white to eat. I turn off the oven and finish cooking it low and slow for another 10 minutes, remove chicken from pan before it cools and soaks up the oil.    Great baked chicken. - Dale

This was an amazingly good recipe!  So much better then basic baked chicken (using bread crumbs)!  I only used half the amount of butter and found it sufficient. Loved it!

It has both a great flavor and crunch.  I used this for skinless breast and thighs for a healthy alternative to fried chicken.

I made this for my kids tonight, and we all really liked it!! I saw some reviews saying it made too much coating, and I am guessing they don't realize it is for 3 chickens. This site allows you to scale it down (which I did)  to make enough for only 1 chicken and it was perfect! I will definitely make this again! Thank you for sharing!!

It did bake up golden and I like the flavor of this chicken, but my husband wasn't a big fan -- said it was "okay." I baked 45 minutes -- it was very moist. As others noted, there was a lot of the breading left over.

This was OK. I wasn't the biggest fan of the potato flakes. It was a bit powdery to taste. Maybe it is because I rolled it in the butter and flakes twice. I wanted a thicker coating. It was thicker but not very good. I like the use of bread crumbs better.

Very good recipe for crispy baked chicken.  I added a little zip by adding some hot sauce to the egg dip.  I also added about a teaspoon and a half of cracked pepper and herb seasoning.  Very, very, very good!!

It was good, but nothing to jump up and down for.  It did have flavor, but not much of one.  I had mixed feelings about the potato flakes, but it did work together with the other ingredients.  This dish probably won't be fixed again for a real long while.

I need to cook gluten-free now, so this recipe is a godsend.  It had a great real breaded taste and texture.  I scaled it down and I think the spice calculations for 4 servings were a bit off as it was a little bland--so be careful.  But DH loved it anyway.  I plan to try adapting some other breaded recipes to potato flakes.  Thank you for a great idea.

Excellent baked chicken. Fast to put together. I added 2 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp minced onion then brushed on the chicken using 2 tsp melted butter with 1/4 c olive oil. Excellent. Will become a family staple. Thanks!

Just ok. The flavor was bland for our taste, could use more seasonings and then it would be much better. Love the idea it is baked and not fried.
