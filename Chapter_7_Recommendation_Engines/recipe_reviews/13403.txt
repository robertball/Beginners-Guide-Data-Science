I love this recipe!!

This recipe can be made into the condensed form by using 1/2 the amount of liquid required to make a standard batch, then frozen. 

I make this entire recipe up, ( into liquid form) and can it in pint sized canning jars. Ready when I need it, without the mixing, and no defrost time.

Very awesome alternative when you are out of "cream of" soup.  Tastes just the same in a recipe.  I prefer it without the basil as it doesn't go in some recipes.  Use 1/2 the water if you are using it to replace a canned soup in a recipe.

Great recipe! We mixed all ingredients accept chicken bullion powder, then added 5 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 lb of chopped wild Hen-of-the-Woods mushrooms. Once it cooked down to the consistency we wanted, we pressure canned it (5 pint-sized jars) at 10 lbs for 25 min. Wonderful flavor!!!

I have been using this recipe for at least 15  years from a heart healthy cookbook.  I've found it is best to heat the water in the microwave to not quite boiling, stir in the mix and then cook on a lower power level til thickens.  This is MUCH lower in fat and salt then canned cream soups.

This has helped as I can now make so many of the recipes that call for condensed soup. My daughter has Celiac disease and most of the store soups have wheat in them. Thanks so much.

This was a very good soup base.  Can't wait to try it with different recipes.  Only thing I would change next time is to reduce the thyme to maybe 1/8t.  It just seemed to come through a bit stronger than I had wanted.  Otherwise a very good mix.

I used this in place of onion soup mix to make a roast then thickened to make gravy.  My family didn't even leave a drop for the dogs!

This gluten-free recipe works for me!  I am so very glad to have a substitute for the condensed cans of soup that is still almost as easy as opening a can.

This was exactly what I needed. Next time, I'd like to play with the spices a little. But, it's a great substitute for canned condensed soup. Thank you.

LOVE IT! I never seem to have canned cream soup on hand when I need it!  This was a perfect sub.  It is more versitle, and it is lower in fat than that canned crud! It is not a staple in my kitchen!

Using this recipe for several years now. I omit the bullion, and use whatever base I want when making it-chicken broth, mushroom broth, or whatever.  Or I just add over a liquid  stew and it tightens it right up and makes a gravy.   I store the powder mix and add the liquid  when I need it. Quick easy and delicious.  Then I can use broth water or whatever liquid I want depending on what I am making.  Often use liquid from sauted mushrooms as part of my broth, for example.  Great for green bean casserole!

Excellent flavor.  I used 5 cups chicken broth and canned this.  I divided the chicken broth  and kept back 1 cup cold broth to mix in the cornstarch and then added it to the heated mixture.  I also added minced dried wild mushrooms.  

I have also used this recipe as it was intended as dry condensed soup and mixed with liquid as you need it.   Again, very tasty and convenient.  Much better flavor than store bought canned condensed soup.

I tried this, and it was just okay with me.  I'm not sure what herb it is that ruined it for me, probably the basil, but when I used this to make my favorite hash brown casserole, the flavor was way off and the casserole virtually ruined. This mix may be okay with some casseroles but is not really a substitute for the canned.

I left out the thyme and basil so that it would be more versatile.  Although this was good, it was still pretty salty.  Next time I will reduce the chicken bouillon powder.

Perfect for using in recipes that call for condensed cream of ____soup.
