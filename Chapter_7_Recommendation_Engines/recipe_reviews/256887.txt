For this to be a chef John recipe I'm surprised. This had a great flavor, but it turned out slightly watery. Aside from cutting my bread into cubes (just changing the shape to fit my soup crock) I made no changes. I think the broth amount could be reduced without impacting the taste.

*Always watch Chef John’s videos before preparing any of his recipes!* I used chicken broth in place of vegetable as he did in the video and instead of using a full slice of bread, made some homemade croutons to top the soup before broiling. Don’t be shy with the amount of cheese you top the soup with!

I added small pieces of celery and broccoli so the soup would have does tenders nibbles of veggies. 
And since I trying to lower my carbs consumption, i didn’t complemented with the bread.
But the soup by itself was amazing!

Such a yummy recipe to use up broccoli!

The accompanying video mentioned using 3 lbs of broccoli and adding more liquid at the end to thin out the thick soup. So I also used 3 lbs of broccoli, as that is what I had, used 7 cups of chicken broth, and increased the whipping cream to 3/4 c.
To finish off the individual servings in the oven, rather than a slice of toast, I placed some Twistos on top (dill and garlic flavoured), and topped it with a mix of shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese (it's what we had on hand). 
It was delicious . . . The Twistos got a little soggy, so will try the toast next time.
