I went through so many of these chocolate cake recipes, and this one was soooo good! Everybody wanted to know what it was that made it so moist and delicious, and I told them it was the mayo! This definetly gets two thumbs up!

My cake fell apart so I made a trifle out of it. The coffee flavor was indiscernible so I layered it with cherries and chocolate pudding to make a black forest sort of dessert.

I like a lighter, spongier cake.  This one turned out very heavy and dense, coffee flavour a bit overwhelming, the brand of unsweetened chocolate I used did not blend well into the batter.
