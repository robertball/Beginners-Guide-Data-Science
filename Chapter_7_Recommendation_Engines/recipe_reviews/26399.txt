I wasn't expecting the corn to add such sweetness to the soup so it really needed tweaking with salt and pepper to taste. I used 8 chicken legs in the soup which worked well. This was just great for a rainy day like today. After I took the photo I couldn't help but add some risoni soup noodles to make it more of a meal instead of just a broth.

This soup was very good. I sauteed the onion with olive oil in a pressure cooker and added the water, and all the vegetables including a couple of stalks of brocoli and cauliflower and cooked for 20 minutes. After straining I saved the chicken, the broth, added a couple of carrots, frozen corn instead of creamy and fresh cilantro. Delicious, I like the fact that is a broth base recipe.

This was a great recipe! I just added 1/2 a packet of dry chicken soup, which tends to be salty, to balance the sweetness of the corn. I also browned the chicken in olive oil and crushed garlic before adding water to add a flavorful base.

Maybe this was too simple for me, it lacked something and was very bland. I  added some chicken bouillion to it and more salt and pepper. Even with the  modifications after trying it as submitted, I won't be using it again.

I've made this recipe several times and it's one of my favorite soups. I leave the onions in though, and just fish out the peppercorns and bay leaf. For me, the shredding of the chicken is a lot of work, because I think the soup tastes better if the pieces are very thin, but it's so worth it.
