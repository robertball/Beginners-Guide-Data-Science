We made this tonite as an appetizer for dinner.  Took the advice of some others and skipped the heavy cream - also skipped the mayo (I just don't really like it).  Instead of baking it the whole way, we also microwaved the cream cheese, sour cream, etc together until it was heated through and smooth, then put it in the bread and sprinkled the cheese over it, threw it in the broiler for a few minutes until the cheese got melty and bubbly.  MMMMMMM it was good.  I looked away, and the whole loaf, bread and all, was gone.  Also the store didn't have sourdough, so I used pumpernickle. Easy to make, easy to eat, easy to clean up (ya eat the bowl!) Can't beat that!

I started with this recipe, but then veered off a little bit - added an extra half package of cream cheese and sour cream, cut down to about 2/3 cup for the mayo and heavy cream, and used sharp yellow cheddar.  I misread the directions the first time and mixed in 2 tablespoons (not teaspoons!) of Old Bay so it was a bit spicy but still good.  I've made it once with crab and once with shredded chicken, and it's tasty either way.

This was a 10 star dish.  Served it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner and the whole family dug in.  Loved the bread bowl, but was also great with those new scoop style tortilla chips (next time I'll get the reduced salt ones tho').  Definitely a keeper, will make again and again!

This recipe is a hit! I lightened it up by substituting low fat mayo and Neufchatel cheese for cream cheese. I also doubled the amount of crabmeat (2 lbs). It seemed that it would be too thin with the heavy cream, so I left it out completely. With these changes, I would give the recipe 5 stars, but it definitely needs thinning. Also is served well with club crackers.

If this receipe could get more than 5 stars, I would give it that much more. I've been making this for ten years now and has made me famous for it. I have friends willing to travel 8000 miles for this one, and I will be making it for Memorial Day weekend.

A great crowd-pleaser, Joelle! I have served this one at several parties and everyone raves about it. The combination of seasonings really gives the crab flavor and extra zing! Thanks for sharing!

I took this dip to a football party, and it was a hit!  There was nothing left over.  Instead of canned crab meat, I used real crab meat and added just a little more than the recipe called for, and it was perfect.

I had high hopes for this dip based on other reviews but found it to be WAY too soupy after it was cooked.  Wish I had read some of the other reviews that said to leave out the heavy cream - maybe that would make a difference.

This was delicious, although I realized after the party that I forgot to add the mayo!  I did add a little extra horseradish for more zip and used one 15 oz can of crab clawmeat (from the refrigerated aisle of the store) instead of the small cans of lump meat.

The dish wasn’t bad but I would call it good ether. The dip was forgettable and kind of boring. As a Marylander I was disappointed in the flavor.( I don’t like spice but I needed more flavor) I took this dish to a cook out and baked it off in the hostess oven. HUGE fail, it made a mess of her oven. The dip bubbled over. I was disappointed in my choice of recipe.  The recipe is also super expensive to make, there is no way that many different kinds of cream and cream products are necessary.

Yummmmmmmy! This was very good, even with my using lowfat ingredients. I wont add as many artichokes next time (and there will totally be a next time) because my kids discovered that they hate them. Haha, it was great, thanks!!

I really really wanted to love this recipe.  I love crab dip and I love artichoke dip, so I figured this couldn't go too wrong.  Also, my daughter's name is "Joelle" so I took that as a further omen and made this for Christmas to bring to a friend's house.   Way too rich with hardly any crab taste.  I did not care for this recipe.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner and it was perfect.  I wasn't sure if everyone attending would like the artichoke hearts so I left them out. Also, I baked it in a baking dish and then served it with a variety of crackers rather than the hollowed out loaf. Absolutely delicious! It was devoured in a very short time.

I have never made anything in my life other than microwave dinners.  My friend Joel made an artichoke and crab dip once, and he was going to make another one for our holiday party, but then he couldn't come.  He is a lazy guy and didn't send me his recipe, but I found this one among 3 or 4 others on the Internet.  I made this with no trouble at all and it was a ROUSING success.  Every person who tried it wanted the recipe and could not believe that I made it.  I listened to some of the reviews and went a little heavier on the cream cheese and used about 1/2 of the amount of heavy cream.... was excellent!  …better than the best crab dip you can get at the best places in Maryland.

Great dip!  I took it to our happy hour tonight at the clubhouse (Active Adult Community) and everyone loved it!  I used the packaged imitation crab (1 lb.) and everything else except the heavy cream, but I mixed in the cheddar cheese and seafood seasoning and just took it in the 9 x 13 baking dish, since I didn't have the sourdough bread.  Folks were wanting to eat it with a fork. It was delicious - thanks for sharing.

This has been a huge hit at parties and gatherings for me. People love it! They will ask "who made this, it is so good". Now everytime I am invited somewhere I am asked to bring the dip.

Not impressed at all. Followed it to a T. My husband even agreed it was pretty gross. We tossed it after a few tastes. It was to bland and to creamy. I think the cream cheese ruined it. I have had A LOT better. Dont waste your money on making this.

Ths is the best hot crab dip recipe I have ever made or tried. I use Tony Chackerie cajun spice as I prefer it over the other, but that's just a personal preference.

I thought it was a bit runny, but re-heated really well. I also thought it was too garlicky (and that's rare for me) so next time I will use less garlic and more artichokes.

Didn't love this recipe.  It would have been better with real crab.  It's also a lot of work and the dip at Costco taste better.

VERY soupy.  I would recommend not adding any of the heavy cream, cutting the sour cream in half and doubling the artichokes.  THEN see if it needs anything else.

This is a very good recipe. I've made it 5-6 times already. The first time I made it just as directed. But I didn't care for the Old Bay seasoning. The second time I omitted the Old Bay and added more garlic and some Red Hot sauce. It was fabulous!! I've been making it this way ever since. It's a standard at our family Christmas party. Thanks!

Great recipe, and the horseradish is the perfect touch. I used Wye River Crab Seasoning instead of Old Bay and this turned out great! Thanks much.

This was a great dip. I did skip the heavy cream. Also next time I make this I will add more horseradish. It will add a little more zip, which I would like.

Made this for a Halloween party, and while tasty, it didn't look all that appealing in the casserole dish. I would definitely go for the bread bowl next time. Was worried the bread bowl would not keep it hot, but it actually tasted fine at room temp. Also the bread will help to keep any extra liquid from puddling-Maybe I didn't drain my crab or artichokes well enough.

This was good but not the hit I was expecting it to be for our Christmas party.  Real crab would have been better than canned.

Overall this was very good. It was a little bit to runny for my taste, but we ate it as an open faced sandwich on asiago cheese bread. (VERY GOOD) So I bet if you ate it in the sourdough breadbowl as recommened it would be even better. Very good though.

Very good, except next time I think I will mix the cheddar cheese in with the cream cheese because left on top the cheese stuck together and had to be broken apart. Great recipe though. Thanks.

We enjoyed this dip for lunch during an all day movie fest.   Sweet, creamy, briney, just a wonderful blend of flavors.  I used imatation crabmeat because I'm allergic with low-fat cream cheese, non fat sour cream, lite mayo and evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  We don't like layers of cheese on top of dips so I mixed the cheese in before baking.  Instant hit!

I tweaked this recipe a bit: I didn't add white cheese and I used all fat-free ingredients and added hot sauce and jalepenos to make it spicy!  Great with a loaf of sourdough on a cold night.

This is very good, but VERY SOUPY. It falls off the bread!! I use real can crab and double the cream cheese and omit the sour cream. Also, I mix in the cheddar and bay.

This is definitely a 4 star crab dip.  However, I made it with a 1 pound can of Phillips Crab Meat and used low fat everything except the cheese.  I did add a little extra Old Bay seasoning to the mixture--not just on top to give it a little more taste.  I have had several people ask me for the recipe.
