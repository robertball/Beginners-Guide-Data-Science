This is my FAVORITE recipe from this site.  I've made it at least 10 times.  It's wonderfully versatile.  I used whole wheat flour and egg replacer (I'm vegan).  The last time I made it, instead of using ground ginger, I grated in about 1/4 cup of fresh ginger.  I've also used this recipe with grated carrots instead of zucchini...and grated apples (using cinnamon instead of the ginger).  Also, I usually cook it in my ring pan.  The last time I made it, I used whole wheat pastry flour so it'd be lighter...added a glaze to the top and took it to a potluck...it was scarfed up!

This was the first time I've used another recipe for zucchini bread instead of the one I received from a friend years and years ago - and it turned out wonderfully!!!  My boyfriend almost ate half a loaf himself and told me that this was the best my zucchini bread ever tasted!  Definitely 5*'s and recommended for all to try!

This recipe is fantastic. I used craisins instead of raisins and also added grated orange peel - and hoo-boy-howdy - it was great. Thanks for the recipe - its a keeper!

One of the best! So easy, little prep time and delicious! 
I had so many compliments just from my first prep. 
The clove really makes it--just be sure you don't get too much.
Stays moist for days IF it lasts that long.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!! Even better then my grandma's which I love and enjoy making. I did make some changes. Instead of the ginger and cloves I used 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and instead of the raisins I put in 1 cup chocolate chips. You have got to try it that way it is to die for even my kids ate it like they couldn't get enough.. Thanks for sharing a GREAT recipe!!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe. Try substituting Crasins (dried cranberries) or currants for the raisins.

Excellent recipe!  I used dried cherries rather than raisins and half brown sugar and half white sugar.  Increased the zucchini a little bit- very moist.

Excellent!  The first zucchini bread I have ever made/had.  The kids loved it too.  Made the recipe as stated except for omitting the walnuts to make it school lunch friendly (no nut/peanut products allowed at school).

Great recipe...thanks!  perfect amount of gr. ginger and gr. cloves.  I made a few revisions to make it a bit more healthier:  Replaced 1 c. white sugar w/ 1 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. veg. oil w/ 1 banana, 2 eggs w/ 2 egg whites only, 1 c. white flour w/ 1 c. whole wheat flour.  I also used golden rasins (chopped)  Recipe still came out super moist and a bit more heart healthy.

This bread is absolutely delicious!  It is so moist, and the spices make it so tasty.  The first two loaves I baked were gone in four days, and the second batch is just as popular.  My kids love it.  Great recipe!

Love it with butter!  I added a little grated carrot and did not really measure my zucchini because I like a lot of zucchini in my bread.  This recipe baked well and my family loved it!

I added some cinnamon to the mixture and baked it in two round cake pans, then I frosted it with a can of vanilla frosting to which I had added some raisins and coconut.  It was delicious, but next time I'll only bake it for about 45 minutes.

Yummy, this bread is fantastic, although I did tweak it just a bit.  I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, omitted the oil, added 1/3 cup water instead and used a generous 1 tsp of ground ginger.  I baked it for roughly 45 mins in a 10 inch bundt pan.  It turned out to be quite a dense cake, almost pound cake like but oh so yummy.  A definite KEEPER!

This did not come out as moist as I thought it would be but was still tasty.  Of course I didn't have the right sized pan which may have contributed to it being dried out.  If I did want it really moist what should I do?

mmmm... very delicious! I added allspice instead of clove and ginger.The allspice still gave it just enough clove taste making it a very nice touch to the bread.

Mmm, delicious! By far the best zucchini bread I have ever made! I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar and added about 2/3 cup of rolled oats. I cut the recipe in half and made it as muffins (it made about 10 large muffins that rose beautifully) to send to my brother at college in PA. They survived the trip and my brother loved them. Thanks for the post!

This is very good: I added a little cinnamon (and left out the raisins) and it tastes very cinnamon-y.  Good for people that don't really want to notice the zucchini,   It was moist and yummy.

This is almost exactly the same as my grandmothers recipe.  I use 1 cup white sugar and 1 Cup Brown sugar, also my grandmother added 1/4 C. Wheat germ.   Its a sweet taste of my childhood, my kids love it too, with a little cream cheese.

You're right.  This recipe is very different than all the other zucchini bread recipes.  I'm sorry, but my family didn't care for this one, esp. the raisins.  It was very moist; I would give it that much, but we didn't care for the ginger taste; seems to dominate the overall taste of the bread.  We will stick to the other traditional recipes.  Sorry.

This recipe is just wonderful!  The spices added a yummy twist.  I will make this again!  My children actually ate this bread...even the anti-vegetable 11 year old!

Love this recipe! It was easy and delicious. I left out the walnuts and added finely chopped Bacon instead. That's right, BACON. And trust me, it was amazing!!!!
My only problem was that it was super crumbly... which I'm not sure how to fix. But it was so good, I didn't mind picking up handfuls of crumbly deliciousness and shoving them into my happy mouth. =)

fabulous!  The texture was great and it was very moist, we added nuts too, unfortunately, the kids weren't big on it, maybe next time I'll add chocolate chips, then they will devour it:-)

I have made this for several years now.  I add a dash of cinnamon and allspice.  Also don't add raisins or walnuts.  Gonna try rum soaked raisins in next batch.  Awesome.  Now a family favorite!

Love this recipe. Moist and full of flavor. I add more ginger and cloves, also tastes good with chopped dates instead of the raisins. A hit with everybody.

This recipe was very easy to follow. It turned out well for me. The taste for some folks may be difficult to overcome for those who compare it to a "traditional" tasting zuchinni bread made with cinnamon and/or brown sugar. However, a few more raisins, a little melted butter and it is still a very yummy treat.

Very good.   I substituted "pie spice" for the spices in the recipe.   First loaf wasn't even cool before it was devoured!

Great recipe! I did make a few adjustments by substituting applesauce for the oil. I added a dash of nutmeg and cloves. The best part of my adjustment was buttering the bottom and sides of the pan and coating it with crushed walnuts. Simply amazing!!

I loved this recipe.  Moist, easy, and tasty.  I used brown sugar for 1/2 of the sugar requirements, and added some cinnamon. Made 1 loaf with nuts and one without and took to a pot luck.  Both were equally received and enjoyed with most being gobbled up even though there were other options.

Really liked the lightness of this.  I made mine into muffins.  I took the advice of others and reduced the sugar - should have left it in.  I also did not drain the pineapple, plus I added 1/2 as much more of the spices and added 1/2 as much of ginger to add some depth.  Ate one with butter and it was pretty darn good!
