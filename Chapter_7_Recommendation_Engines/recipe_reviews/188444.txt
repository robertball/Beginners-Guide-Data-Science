YUM!  I loved the combination of flavors in this!  I didn't have jalapeno peppers so I left them out but then it seemed like it needed some spunk so I added a little hot sauce.  Also, it says salt to taste, just FYI, I used a little salt when I cooked the rice and then added one tsp. salt to the whole mixture.  I diced the green pepper and onion very small to keep them small in proportion to the main ingredients. This is a keeper!

Excellent! Light, refreshing, and  delicious. Only minor changes: I used a can of Mexicorn and omitted the onions out of preference. Thanks! :)

This is a wonderful salad! The combination of flavors is great; the lime gives the salad a wonderfully light, refreshing taste. Because my family doesn't care for spicy things (and because I didn't have any!) I omitted the jalapeno peppers, but this is still a very tasty, easy to make salad. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but I thought it needed some oomph, so I added some nice, vinegary hot sauce. I made a few minor subs based on personal preference: quinoa for rice, roasted Hatch green chiles for jalapeno (they're hotter and more flavorful), and green onions for white. I'd add some red wine vinegar and avocado if I made this again. Nice, hearty dish.

I omitted the rice and replaced the kidney beans with another can of black beans and served as a salsa with homemade tortilla chips. I took home an empty bowl and many requests for the recipe. It is really a great for taking to a picnic or party because it still tastes great at room temperature. Because I hate chopping jalapenos I used a small can of chopped green chilis and it turned out great.

This salad is very good, and has provided a basis for me to personalize it to my tastes. I didn't have any jalapenos, which I'm assuming would have added an extra punch. I made mine with black beans and pinto beans (not kidney), frozen thawed corn, red pepper in addition to the green pepper, 3 limes instead of one, 2 tbsp. olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, 8 oz. Monterey Jack Cheese cut into small cubes, 1 can of sliced olives, and 1 tsp. sea salt. Next time I make this, I will add the jalapeno and use green onion instead of a regular onion, and maybe more cheese. Tomatoes and avocado could be added as well. There are so many possibilities with this wonderful salad! 

Also, this salad does have the potential to be dry. Tonight on my way home from work I bought a bottle of Newman's Own Light Lime salad dressing which I added to this salad. It was delicious and added a nice sweetness. I also plan on trying this with the cilantro-lime dressing by Lin on this site.

I think this salad is SO great.  You can add or subtract items based on your pantry and it will always work.  Like I was out of corn one day!  If you had the wonderful opportunity to have Galllo Y pinto in costa rica for Breakfast, it is very similar to this dish.  If you have any left overs try it with scrambled eggs in the morning!

One word - YUM!  So light and simple; this will be a summer staple for us.  My daughter - a fairly picky 11 year old, loved the salad before we put in the rice, and commented that it would make a wonderful salsa - I agree!!

Nice blend of flavors!  Even with the jalapenos, I thought it needed some "oomph", so I kept doctoring it til I was happy with it.  Great side dish!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was delicious.  I used fresh corn instead of canned (just because I had it in the fridge).  Everything else was exact.  Great family salad, very healthy.  Rice adds body and fills you up, beans are so good for you.  Lovely fresh flavour.

This is a pretty good recipe, though next time I might add a little evoo.  The changes I made were minimal: 1) used a single serano pepper insead of 2 jalapeno's because the store was out 2) Upped the cilantro to 1/2 cup because I love the stuff 3) reduced the rice to 1 cup to cut back on some of the carbs 4) only used 1/2 of a red onion 5) accidentally omitted the lime zest, 6) subbed 2 tsps of garlic powder for the minced garlic (and next time will probably actually add even more 7) omitted the salt 8) added in some cracked black pepper.  This is a fiber rich meal that is great for me when I am flying because it travels well & I can eat healthier as opposed to picking up a burger during a layover.  However, I still prefer the Nutty Brown Rice Salad on this site ALOT more than this recipe.  Thanks though for sharing!

I made this with black beans, pinto beans and garbanzo beans, cilantro, jalepeno, corn, onion and rice.  It is delicious.  We ate it spooned into tortilla chips, but would have been good as a salad or in a burrito as well.  I'll make it again.  It was fast, easy, healthy and tasty.

Wonderful salad and simple to make.  Plan ahead and cook the rice a day in advance.  

This is a wonderful, healthful salad to pack for lunch, high flavor, high fiber, low calorie, and very satisfying.  It'll be even better when the fresh garden produce comes in!

I made some minor changes to suit our tastes. I used parsley instead of cilantro and skipped the onion. I used granulated garlic instead of the fresh and used only one jalapeno. I added some fresh tomatoes and black olives for more color and taste. The lime juice wasn't quite enough flavor for the dressing so I added some olive oil and extra cumin. That pulled everything together into a delicious and healthy dish.

This is a good basic recipe but needs a little more "dressing."  I made it with just a few subs:  pinto beans for the kidney beans, no lime zest, green onions for chopped onion.  I don't believe these changes would change the basic taste.  It really needed some dressing so I added more lime juice and a couple dashes of olive oil (probably about 1/4 cup).  I probably added more cilantro than called for.  It is very good and healthy.  I will be making this again with my changes.

We put this in burritos with some refried beans (ya, a lot of beans) and sour cream. Seriously, this was amazing. It tasted just like take out. I skipped the cilantro due to personal taste, used a bit of oregano instead. Thank you for the recipe!! Note: this makes a lot of food.

Excellent salad. Easy to make. I only used one jalepano since I had kids eating it as well and they loved it! It is great to make the night before and just grab and go if you are bringing it to a party. Pretty presentation.

Delicious!!  I added a little more cumin and left out the jalapeno peppers.  Put in a flour tortilla with some blackened chicken for lunch!  Absolutely yummy!  I'll be making this again for sure.

This was excellent! I was out of limes so I used cider vinegar, and it turned out awsome. It's got so much nutrition packed into one dish that I might end up just eating a big bowl for lunch. Thank you!

I followed this recipe to the T, only omitting the jalapenos. It was missing something...maybe more lime juice. Maybe needs the addition of tomatoes?

Excellent recipe! Healthy and delicious. I used pinto beans instead of kidney and 1 red pepper cause that's what I had. Also used grilled fresh sweet corn instead of canned.  But this is my next carry-in dish for sure!

This was awesome, although I did add some things. I added tomato and feta cheese, and also used just a dash of cumin, black beans, and chick peas instead of kidney, subbed white rice. Surprisingly yummy.

This salad looks very pretty and tastes good, but not great. It definately needs a kick. I added extra lime juice and some diced tomatoes and a bit of crushed red pepper, but it still needs a little something else.

When my wife, who shuns all spicey hot foods, took her second serving spoon of this salad, I knew you had a winner!  It is a great taste and high in protein. This could substitute for a meat in a summer meal.  We'll do this one again.  It is my policy to make a new recipe by-the-book the first time, then adjust if it seems necessary.  I will double the Lime juice next time.   Rick in Raleigh

Very good base recipe for those who like to experiment and a solid recipe as is for those who don't. (I switched green onion for regular onion and added about 1 T each red wine vinegar and olive oil to make more of a dressed salad.  I'll try it without the added liquids next time but it still tasted great.)

Awesome flavours in this bean salad! I used chili style kidney beans for more spice, a chopped red pepper, canned chilies for the jalapeno peppers and two tablespoons of lime juice.

Love it... with minimal changes. I used 2 cans of Black beans instead of kidney. Used green onions, green chilies (instead of jalapeno). Added chili powder, onion powder. Used 2 limes, dash of balsamic vinegar and EVOO for the dressing. Definitely let it sit overnight. My co-workers loved it :)

This isn't a bad dish; very fresh tasting, but I felt it was bland. I added more lime juice hoping it would flavor the dish but it didn't help. I like the ingredients a lot so next time I'll try to come up with a different dressing.

Very fresh and light. It would be great without the rice too as more of a dip or with quinoa. I added some tomatoes and ate it with blue corn chips. It needed that extra crunch. Delish!

As someone who can only take cold lunches to work, I look for as many "salad" possibilities as possible. This is a fantastic addition to my lunch and tons of leftovers for more lunches or to serve guests as a snack! The taste is incredible! Yum!

This is a very flavorful recipe that is easy to fix, a nice balance of plant proteins, and not high in calories.  Perfect for someone like me who has an abundance of fresh jalapeno peppers growing and is looking for good ways to use them. When I cut up the hot peppers, I wear disposable gloves to keep from getting the hot on my fingers.  Since I did not have a fresh bell pepper, I used some pickled from a jar and that added a nice flavor too.   I used brown rice as directed in the recipe and was pleased with the result.  For variety, the next time I make it, I will try another whole grain rice such as red or black, both available in Asian markets.  I might also try adding a tablespoon or two of oil to the salad.  This salad will be one that I look forward to bringing to a potluck at church especially during periods of fasting from meat and dairy.

A favorite with our family.  I've taken it to pot lucks and it's always a hit.  Nice vegetarian dish.  The cilantro really gives it a fresh taste.  Left out the jalapeno peppers and added sweet red pepper for color.  With or without the rice, it really makes a nice dip with with scoops.

This doesn't seem like it would have a lot of flavor, but it's delicious!  I add a little bit of olive oil and salt for fullness of flavor, and it is a favorite side dish for our family.

This was an excellent salad!  I used quinoa cooked in a vegetable broth, instead of brown rice, and added a can of green chiles and one red bell pepper.  I also added one lemon, juiced, and topped it off with slices of avocado.  My husband loved it, and I have a hard time getting him to trade quinoa for rice!

I love how this recipe uses all whole foods. I used 1/2c. each of dried black turtle beans and red kidney beans (soaked overnight then boiled 1 hour). Allowing the flavours to blend over a few hours (or making it a day ahead) adds a whole new dimension to this tasty dish!

It is difficult to get our kids to eat veggies, but not with this salad. We make the salad more or less according to the directions and enjoy it very much. We have also taken this dish to church for a pot luck where it was very well received. Sorry we don't have any suggestions, but we strongly recommend you give it a try.

For the healthiness of it, I wouid give this recipe a 5, but the flavor was a 3, so I gave it 4 stars.  I did add 2 tbspn EVOO and about the same of balsamic vinegar.  Definately could use some more herbs.  We had it with chicken and veggie kabobs and it was a very healthy gluten free meal.  :)

Nice flavors throughout.  Can get a little dry with the brown rice.  I recommend adding a little oil/vinegar/hot sauce to add some moisture and jazz it up a little bit more.  Great healthy lunch idea.

Absolutely wonderful, light and low fat! I just used black beans since I had bought an 8 pack at Costco and was looking for black bean receipes and found this....Let sit in the fridge overnight, excellent lunch with rotisserie chicken.

I have used a version of this recipe that uses a can of finely diced chilies and a dressing of olive oil, red wine vinegar, 1 tsp. each minced garlic, chili powder, marjoram and ground cumin.  The extra red wine vinegar, marjoram and chili powder helped increase the flavor.

I love bean salads and this had great potential...but you seriously need to at least triple the dressing and I also added some olive oil....very dry otherwise and the rice just soaks up any liquid so I highly suggest to make a light dressing with the fresh lime juice, olive oil, etc. Thanks!

This rice is very flavorful, the only thing I thought it needed was some more juice so I think that next time I would use 2 limes instead of one.  This recipe is highly recommended.

Good way to use up leftover brown rice. Wonderful with diced avacado (coat with lime juice to keep from turning brown) and served as a side dish with sliced beef or BBQ chicken. I usually use frozen corn to cool it down quickly. Don't forget the gloves when handling jalapeno peppers. Very healthy!

Not disappointed.  I lacked kidney beans and lime juice, left out jalapenos completely, but added fresh ground pepper and some chili powder.    Lime juice would definitely have gave it more oomph and rounded out the flavor, but it still turned out tasty!    Perhaps reviewers who call this recipe bland don't usually eat or like the taste of fresh vegetables...

Made this for a huge crowd (scaled recipe up to feed 50) and was really easy to assembly even at that size.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I did change the recipe a little. First, I found the Jalapenos added a nice brightness to the dish but not really any noticable heat, so I served the dish along side a bottle of our favorite hot sauce, letting the guests add heat if they wanted. Also, I added advocado (as another user suggested) and added more fresh lime juice -tossing the avocados in some of the lime juice to keep them from browning.  When served the recipe got rave reviews and I sent the recipe home with a bunch of people.

This is so good! I used white rice and all black beans due to what I had on hand.  I also used canned jalapenos and frozen corn.  I added some chili powder and it was fabulous! I highly recommend this recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Had to substitute coriander for cilantro; added juice of second lime; substituted about 4 Tbsps of Tex-Mex spice for jalapenos & added some chopped red pepper.  Used sea salt & added some freshly ground black pepper.  Turned out really well.

Simple, easy and delicious! I doubled the lime and cilantro, used half of a med. onion, and left out the garlic and salt. Next time, I will consider using only one jalapeno pepper. This was great with guac, wrapped in tortilla!

I think this would have been wonderfully yummy as the recipe was written, but for my own preferences I followed the recommendations of many of the reviewers. I used two limes, green onions and added some tomatoes. I also used only one jalapeno, but since I chopped it so fine I think two would have been good as well. I read the one reviewer complaining about it being bland. You MUST let this sit in the fridge for an hour. The difference is astounding.

Surprisingly YUM!  Used red pepper instead of green, green onion for the white onion.  And, added a little olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Did not have jalapeños, so added a few drops of smoked chipolte tabasco. Makes a TON.  PS:  Also, to make it even quicker to put together, used Trader Joe's frozen brown rice - just heat, cool and mix it all together.  Will make this again and again!

Just made this recipe and it turned out great. Light and refreshing, as another reviewer put it. I omitted the kidney beans and added a frozen Mexican-style mix of corn, peppers, onions, black beans and spices, then added a diced avocado and threw in a little chili flake. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted so bland and dry. So I added in extra cumin, extra lime juice, garlic powder, chili powder, lemon pepper, and even some italian dressing. After those additions, we enjoyed it much more and it was edible.

I love this, I cant stop eating it. I've made this for friends at work for Cinco de Mayo. I'm not sure if I should serve this hot or cold with tortilla chips and a side of sour cream. I did omit the kidney beans and just went with black beans. Definitely use a fresh squeezed lime over the top. Delicious!!

1st time I made it, we liked this, but it just "needed something."  Tried some left-overs with a little Tiger sauce, and that was good.  Heated some left-overs and added some shredded rotisserie chicken and cheddar cheese, and it was a lot like a Chipotle burrito bowl... very good.  Heating reduced the cilantro flavor, so added a little more fresh cilantro after heating.  2nd time I made it I used Jasmine rice, and it was great!  No other changes needed.

This is a great, fresh-tasting salad for the summertime.  We made it for a party, and I think it may be a "love it or hate it" type of dish.  I love it!  But if you're not into beans and rice, you probably wouldn't!  

We thought it would also be good as a burrito filling, which is how we plan to eat our leftovers!

I made this salad over the weekend for family and friends.  I got mixed reviews from everyone, but mostly positive.   I think for people that are not fond of lime will not like this salad.  The changes I made were:  2 1/2 cups orzo,used pinto instead of kidney beans, I used a one pound container of Pico de Gallo for all the other ingredients and I used Paul Newman's Lite Lime salad dressing.  Very refreshing salad.

This salad is great..a day or two later.  It definately needs to chill in order for the flavors to blend.  My family loves it warmed up and with sour cream.  It's great.

Very nice salad - I added extra spice as we like it hot.  We really enjoyed, but my favorite so far on the site is the Santa Fe Rice Salad.  This is a close second!

I found this recipe when I was looking for a rice salad, so I used the white rice I had in my fridge.  I left out the onion since my sweetie doesn't like raw onions and used the Resers black beans with lime and jalapeno.  I did add some lime juice to give it a fresher taste and it was a big hit!

Delicious and simple.  It was perfect on top of some spinach with some crumbled tortilla chips sprinkled on.

I made this to take for lunch and it was really good and filling. I did scale the recipe down for just one serving. I used 1/2 cup instant brown rice, 1/2 can each of black beans, kidney beans and corn, with some diced onion and green bell pepper, kept the 2 jalapenos and used the lime juice in the lime thing, some garlic powder cayenne and salt/pepper. Great lunch! Will make again, Thanks.

Good but a little dry.  Maybe I should have used more lime juice like some others suggested.

Not a lot of flavor as is - may take the suggestion about using Chili Powder to spice it up...it definitely needed something extra.

I've made this recipe twice this summer. I have to swap out the cilantro for parsley and added a dash of Chili Powder to spice it up a little. But is really good on hot/humid summer days.

Very good and different! Not hot like I thought, kind of bland, but good! I added it with salsa and leftover roast beef sliced to make a filling for soft shells. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the japapenos and it just seemed bland. As someone else suggested, I added another lime, but it didn't seem to make much difference.  I made it for a cookout and took most of it home.

I don't know how anyone made this and could eat it.   I've made it several times, thinking I messed up something, nope, still the same.  Pretty hard and what I did eat, the egg was the main flavor.  Hard pass for me but I'm glad others liked it.

Great as is! I also did a lower carb version for my husband using no rice, diced avocado, grilled corn from the day before, and red onion. It’s a great recipe you can do anything with.

I found this to be pretty bland; there were not enough herbs and spices for the quantity of rice and beans.  It is fine for take-to-work lunches since it is healthy and filling.

Excellent, as I did a bigger batch I'm not completely sure of the quantities for each ingredient, but I tried to follow the recipe as much as I could. I approximately doubled the recipe for a BBQ of 60 persons and I still have left over. it's very filling! I will make it again for sure and I wont change a thing. btw I'm not a spicy person but keep the jalapenos, it's a must and its not too much! thanks :)

Excellent easy recipe. Will definitely make again. Makes a huge amount but flavours are better as time passes. The only thing I did different is I only used 1/2 a jalapeño as my granddaughters were going to  be having some as well. Great recipe, great flavour, thank you.

This was wonderful! Very light & refreshing! I will definitely save this recipe & make it again! 

I tweaked mine a bit by zesting & juicing 2 limes instead of 1, and I used a red onion instead of yellow for its sweetness. I added extra cilantro leaves (I didn’t chop mine), and since I like things a little on the  spicy side I didn’t remove the seeds from the jalapeños. This was great!

I have made this numerous times. It's fresh, healthy and filling. The recipe makes a pretty good sized bowl full and the ingredients aren't expensive. I usually use just black beans and I always seem to like mine with extra lime juice, occasionally I add a drizzle of honey to offset some of the acidity of the lime.

Did not make any changes to recipe. Easy and very good. Onion and lime were both very small so the flavors were very mild. Excellent side dish. Preferred to serve warm.

So simple, and really delicious.  I love that the only "dressing" is lime juice.  It isn't laden with fat, and the taste is fantastic.  I made it for a ladies get-together and everyone wanted the recipe.  I make it for my family and leave it in the refrigerator, and they rave about it.   Quick chilled salad that is a crowd pleaser.

Definitely healthy...but like some others shared - it needs some oomph.

My family really liked this!  It was fresh and light.  I added a little more lime juice and cilantro, other than that I made the recipe as directed.  I will make this again!

For fun individual servings I made mini taco salad bowls by using  tortillas and baking them on an upside down muffin tin. Once they cooled I spooned in the salad mixture and topped with chunky salsa.

This can be served cold or warm.  However, I noticed that after I added the rice that it absorbed all of the moisture making this dish somewhat dry.
I did add more lime juice, a chopped up avocado and taco seasoned ground beef which added some flavor.
This recipe is good enough to make again but maybe with a few possible changes... such as instead of mixing in the rice, make spanish rice and do a layered dish with the rice on the bottom and the beans served on top with a handful of tortilla chips on the side with a spoonful of sour cream and spicy salsa.
The possibilities are endless!

Very good!  My daughter has become a vegan so we're looking for recipes that are healthy and filling (not to mention tasty).  This recipe is perfect!!!  I did add some olive oil as it seemed like it might need a little more liquid.  I also used dried cilantro as I couldn't get any fresh :-( (I'm betting it's amazing with fresh cilantro!).  Since my kids do not like spicy food, I only used 1 jalapeno and it's barely noticeable so I might use 2 the next time I make it (and there will be a next time).  Served it over sliced fanned avocado with another few squeezes of lime.  Delicious!!!

My rating includes some minor changes based on preference and comments in some other reviews-1) used orzo instead of brown rice, 2) went light on cilanto, 3)added a sprinkling of salt and 4) added some Newman's Own Lime dressing to make it more it more moist. This recipe make a huge amount so be careful! I served it to my Book Club and they all loved it. I will definitely make this again!

I originally got this dish from my mom and both of us have been making it for years. It is always a party hit! Though I love cumin, I-ve made it both ways and prefer this recipe without it. I just dress it with the lime juice, olive oil, salt and pressed garlic. I don't  put in jalepeno either - but it would probably be a nice addition for those who like some heat!

This was a really easy recipe and tasted great!!
I didn't use jalapeno peppers and couldn't find any brown rice so I used couscous, which was still good! I also added sesame seed oil, avocados, and tomatoes, and I was told it tastes good warmed up too. Next time I make it, I will make brown rice and couscous separately and use the vegetables as a "topping," so we can try it with both. :)

Just made this and gave it a taste.  It's VERY good! Better then I thought it was going to be. Can't wait to try once the flavors marry a bit. Made this to go with my tamales with mole sauce. UPDATE - MY HUBBY AND I ARE IN LOVE WITH THIS SALAD! I ATE ON A WHEAT TORTILLA FOR BREAKFAST. I WILL BE MAKING THIS A LOT. SO GOOD AND SO FRESH

Very very nice!  I eyeballed all the amounts and went by look and texture.  I really don't understand why people add red wine vinegar to this??..why hamper the taste of lovely fresh lime!  Anyway I digress.  I did add fresh tomatoes and avo at the end, and served with a few taco chips.  Definitely a keeper.

GREAT combination of flavours, unluckily out of corn and lime, so substituted lemon. Added red wine vinegar as someone proposed and a little extra virgin olive oil.  Thanks!!!

I just used black beans as I halved the recipe and didn't want to open two cans of beans. I think it would benefit from more than one hour in the refrigerator to better develop flavors. I might add a bit more cumin, cilantro, onion and lime next time--and there will be a next time--just for personal preference. I garnished with diced tomato, slices of avocado and a wedge of lime.

Really delicious and simple-to-make summer salad. I used a red pepper instead of green and only had key limes, so used four.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Yummy.

This is really good, but does indeed need doctored some to heighten the flavor. I added evo, red wine vinegar and Tabasco. It's great alone, spooned over an avocado or in a tortilla with other fixings. Next time I'm going to add a diced tomato and chicken breast.

I added a good splash of red wine vinegar and substituted bottled line juice as I did not have a fresh lime.  Great yummy  side dish that no one would suspect  as a diabetic recipe.

this was a good starting point.. i used what i had on hand as always.. leftover white rice and great northern beans.. added a bit more garlic and some chili powder.. also added more lemon (no limes) and wanted more acidity so i splashed some of the leftover "juice" from the curtido i had made.. forgot to add the onion but didn't feel it was needed at this point.. ty for the recipe

This is chilling in the fridge now. Early taste tests indicate it is absolutely fabulous, even better than I imagined. A wonderful taste of summer in the winter and a side that should be able to take a little heat in the summer. Thank-you so much for sharing.

It was a nice light side dish, but surprisingly bland considering all the spices and flavors that are in there. I threw the leftovers in quesadillas with cheese and sour cream and those were fantastic. But as a stand alone dish, it wasn't great.

It tasted like one of chipotles burrito bowls... Which I love... the only thing is that it was pretty dry. I forgot to add garlic and cumin, but I added some spicy chicken for my husband who ended up LOVING it. I slopped on a ton of sour cream and I only gave four stars because of the dryness. Next time I might add more corn and beans. The beans and corn tasted awesome!! :D

Great basic recipe! I used 2 cans of black beans and added a can of tomatoes (that included cilantro and jalapeno). I also added two seeded tomatoes, subbed green onions for the onion, and made the dressing separate. For the dressing I used the juice of two limes mixed with garlic olive oil, 3 cloves of minced garlic, cilantro and my favorite Mexican hot sauce along with the cumin. I also added some Marisco's Mexican spice to the salad. This definitely needs to sit for a while to let all the flavors meld together. I'm glad I made it the night before my BBQ (unfortunately I keep taking a spoonful every time I go into the kitchen!)

Very good.  Needed salt, but otherwise a nice salad.

Loved it! But I must admit I changed it up a bit, mostly because of my two kids, so left out the jalapeno peppers, added more lime juice and garlic salt, also I used regular long grain rice.all in all, it was delish! :)

If you want a little extra zing, try adding a can or two of Rotel.

I really love this recipe.  It seems so healthy, flavorful and has such a nice crunch.  It made a lot and I have happily eaten it everyday for lunch this week as well as going great with our burgers the first night.

I did not have any fresh jalapeno peppers so I used some from a jar of pickled Jalapenos that I had in the refrigerator.  My family loved it.  This recipe is so good and good for you.  I highly recommend it.

very good - only used one can of black beans and didn't have any jalapenos - it did need a bit of playing around with the spices to perk it up a bit, and it was a bit dry so I added just a bit of EVO - will def. make again-

I served this at a BBQ and my guests loved it! I made it pretty bland (no onion, no jalapeno, no green pepper, and no lime zest), but it was good with tortilla chips. For my lunch today, I added my leftover grilled chicken, to make it a meal. One of my guests took some home to put on burritos. Overall, this recipe is very EASY, very YUMMY, very HEALTHY, and very VERSATILE. A+ in my book!
