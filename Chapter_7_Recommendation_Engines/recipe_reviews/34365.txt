I'm a bohunk and grew up on my mom's stuffed cabbage and this is a close second and much easier!  I did brown the ground meat with some onions first and added lipton onion soup mix after.  White, uncooked regular rice worked fine.  I added  1 can of tomato soup and 1/2 cup water and poured over top of the layers without stirring.  Came out great!  The only thing I'd change for next time is add some sourkraut on top and use one more can of soup for more sauce.  YUMMY!

I used lean ground beef, cooked it w/ 2 onions and tons of garlic powder, basil, paprika, and white pepper, then drained it. In the crock pot I put the meat mixture, 1 can Itailian style tomatoes, 1 large can of Hunt's low sugar spag. sauce, 1 roasted red bell pepper, and the cabbage cut into large strips. I turned it on high for 2 hours around 1 pm. By the time I got back, the cabbage was done, so I just kept it on warm until 30 minutes before dinner. I cooked 3/4 cup of buckwheat groats w/ and egg white and 1 1/2 cups of water and added it to the beef and cabbage. My husband was so surprised when he came home! My daughter, who is not a fan of cabbage, has eaten this for lunch & dinner for the last 2 days, and is having the last bit for lunch today as well. It is hard not to over cook the cabbage, that is why I kept an eye on it, otherwise it would have turned to mush. I don't know about not cooking the meat first either...I think the recipe would turn out way too greasy.

I have made regular golumbkis for years and found this recipe so much easier. I had no trouble with the rice, as other people said they did. I also added a few cloves (6-8), which gives it a spicer flavor, and made it taste like my mother used to make.

This is a GREAT alternative to making Golabkis.  I love my mom's Golabki recipe but realistically it takes too long and their are a lot of dishes to clean.  I modified this based on my mom's recipe and others suggestions.  Used Meatloaf mix instead of beef for more flavor, added cooked bacon (the missing key flavor if you ask me!), cut cabbage in thick slices verses shredded and used two cans of tomato soup and one can of water instead of tomato sauce.  Cooked on High for 4-5 hours and my uncooked long grain rice turned out fine.  The key is to make sure you have enough liquid to cook the rice.  We can now have the taste of Globki's more than 3x a year!!  Note: This does come out quite mushy so texture wise you don't get the browned cabbage like when rolled and baked but flavor is great.

Yummy. This is real comfort food for a rainy day.  I added garlic powder and a little seasoned salt. I used brown rice instead of white. I mixed the cabbage the last 1/2 hour so it was not mushy.

I made this in the oven since the electricity here isn't reliable enough to cook in a crockpot.  I added a tsp of cinnamon to the tomato sauce and baked it covered at 350 degrees for an hour. It came out perfect -- good flavor, not overcooked or undercooked.

I've seen a different version of this meal which included 1/4 to 1/3 cup brown sugar which makes it really yummy.

Contrary to another review, my rice would not cook.  Next time I'll use instant, or cook it alone and add it at the end.  Other than that, my husband and I loved it (it was really good with corn bread). (Ignore my "kid friendly rating", my children don't eat ANYTHING).

My family really enjoyed this. I did brown the ground beef first with the onion. Then I added a dash of ground cloves, and a bit of brown sugar (about 1/3 cup), per other readers' suggestions. I used brown rice, and it was fully cooked after 6 hours in the low setting--a minor miracle, because my rice never seems to cook properly! This was a great way to simplify the original cabbage rolls! It saved me so much time, and the family loved it. Thanks! :)

This was very quick and easy to put together. I would make it again if I were craving cabbage rolls and didn't want to fuss over the real thing. Tthe rice got very mushy. I would probably add it later on next time. My husband like it a lot.

I grew up on my grandma's golumbkis. She would spend hours making them. My husband does not like golumkis so in the 16 years that I have been married I never made them because of how time consuming it would be for just me. When I came across this recipe I was so happy because it sounded so easy. Then I read the reviews and got a little sad becuase I didn't think they would turn out. After all how could something so easy be good. Well I decided to make them after all. I made it exactly as stated. This was awseome. I had no problems. This was just as good as my grandma's but a lot easier. Thank you for posting.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Golumbki is one of my favorite things that my mother-in-law makes so I was excited to try this. I followed the advice of some of the reviews. I browned the meat with some onions, garlic, salt, and pepper. I also added two cans of tomato soup with half a cup of water on top as sauce. Also, I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. It turned out great! My slow cooker is actually a fast cooker because it was done in 4 hours on low.

Tasted a bit like cabbage rolls but missing something flavor wise.  We did as others recommended - used minute rice and added it with 2 hrs to go before mealtime, and the rice turned out fine.

I make this exactly as the recipes calls for and I can't get enough of it. My rice always turns out perfect and the cabbage is melt in your mouth tender. I have it about once a month and I don't even mind eating the leftovers!

Aside from burning to the walls of the crockpot a bit, this turned out (just) alright in the end.  I had to add a can of beer and a can of tomato soup because it was a pretty thick consistancy by the time I got home.  They also helped to make it a bit less bland and.  The beer, in particular, really helped add flavor and depth.  I don't think I'll make this frequently, but I'll probably give it another go next October.

This is a recipe that should have been better than it was. Maybe more tomatoe juice would have helped, it was a bit dry.

There was just something missing with this recipe.  I'm not sure what it was.  I followed the recipe to the "t" (As I do the first time I try any recipe), and mine turned mushy and kind of sour or rotten tasting.  I wish I knew what to add to give it some flavor....I ended up dumping it down the garbage disposal.

This is a great tasting recipe.  I used meatloaf mix, (ground beef, gr.pork,gr.veal) in place of just gr. beef. This is what I use when I stuff cabbage and worked great for this recipe also.

I put everything in the crock pot this morning, stirred it and left it til my son got home eight hours later. He stirred it and turned it off. It tasted okay, but the texture of the rice and cabbage was too mushy. I think it would have been better if I was able to add the rice and cabbage later in the day so it would not have over cooked.

Very good! I adopted this recipe by browning the ground beef with the onion and some garlic before putting it in the slow cooker, and adding several tablespoons of vinegar and some water.   I also chopped the cabbage into chunks instead of shredding it .  I used short grain  rice and it cooked up very well.  This had a very goo flavor to it and was very easy to make!

Pretty good! Will try the following mods next time to give it more flavor: 1 TBS dried onion, a few shakes each of garlic powder, seasoning salt, and pepper, 3 TBS worcestershire sauce, a 26 oz can of mushroom pasta sauce, 2 TBS brown sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice, an 11 oz can of tomato juice, 1 cup uncooked instant rice, and ½ head of cabbage

Way yummy! I added some brown sugar and used brown rice, and used turkey burger to cut down on fat. And, I didn't have time to do the slow cooker route, I just put it in a big pan on the stove and simmered for an hour and a half. Great recipe...thanks!

My husband and I did not care for this recipe and that is putting it politely. Sorry Christine. We won't be using this one again.

This wasn't at all what I expected it to be.  Bland and mushy with rice that was crunchy. Sorry.

I give it 5 stars, although I did tweak it a little bit. Instead of 28oz of tomato sauce, I used 1/2 tomato soup and 1/2 tomato sauce. I also chopped the cabbage into chunkier pieces, because my family loves cabbage and shredding it would've shrunk it down too much. I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours to save time. The taste was so close to my mom's cabbage casserole recipe that she makes in the oven, but with way less work! My boyfriend, 6 year old son and I all loved it. I added a sprinkle of worcestershire sauce along with tabasco when I ate my serving. My boyfriend added worc. sauce to his as well. Great time saver, thank you! :)

Great flavor and really easy to make.  Definite crowd pleaser.  I made this for my wife and 1 year old son, both of whom loved this dish.  Only adjustment I made was to pour 3/4 cup water after reading reviews about crunchy rice.  I used Bismatti and it turned out perfectly.  I even had enough confidence in this recipe that after trying it just once I committed to making it for this years big Christmas family feast.  I KNOW it will be enjoyed by all!

The flavor was good, but the texture was mushy. I suggest adding cooked rice after the meat and cabbage is done.

Not sure if this is good or not.  Never had cabbage rolls before so I have nothing to compare against.  Flavour was fine but the rice seemed to get overcooked both times I made it.  If I was home, I would have added the rice later.  It was easy at least! Will make again.

I made this for the first time for our Christmas Dinner with my family. I was in a rush and put in the entire package of meat without measuring. I know it was more than I needed. I was tripling the recipe.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe came off with no problems, however, I did not care for the taste of it.  Followed the directions to the step, rice was perfect, shredded the cabbage, did not make any alterations what so ever. The flavor was too far out there for me.  I have polish relatives and am very familar and know what it is suspose to taste like. I think everyone should try it as we all have different tastes.  Good Luck.

I guess I'm not a cabbage fan.  I read the reviews and was very excited after reading all the reviews, but this one was disappointing.  The recipe was easy to follow and very easy to prepare.  For me it turned out very dry, even after I added a cup of water.  Will not try it again.

A very good cabbage roll casserole! I used 1 LB ground beef, 1 TBS dried onion, a few shakes each of garlic powder, seasoning salt, and pepper, 3 TBS worcestershire sauce, a 26 oz can of mushroom pasta sauce, 2 TBS brown sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice, an 11 oz can of tomato juice, 1 cup uncooked instant rice, and ½ head of cabbage. I browned up the meat, drained it, and added the next 5 ingredients. I then poured it into my 3-quart slow cooker and mixed in everything but the tomato juice, instant rice, and cabbage. I cooked it for around 4 hours on low, then added half the tomato juice. 2 hours later, I added the cabbage, rice, and remaining tomato juice. Around 45 minutes later, it was done but not overdone! My husband HATED the last cabbage roll casserole I made, but he really liked this (he likes adding a little extra lemon juice to his serving). Thanks for sharing, CSANDST1!

We have made this many, many times.  The only change I make is to add lots of hot sauce since we like things spicy, and I spread a can of undiluted tomatoe soup over the top before cooking to make it a bit richer.

This came out SOOOOOO good.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was because the rice was a bit undone after 8 hours.  I made some more and just added it in and you hardly noticed.  I also tweaked the recipe a bit - used ground turkey (don't eat red meat) and browned it first with chopped onions, pepper, salt and garlic powder.  I used a bit more sauce than called for and threw in some garlic cloves.  I did not stir it up before I put the heat on.  It was SO tasty and much easier than the traditional stuffed cabbage leaves recipe my grandma used!

This sounded so much better than it actually ended up to be.  Nobody liked it (even my husband who'll eat anything.) The flavor was bland, the rice was crunchy and it was overcooked.  If I were interested in trying it again, (which I'm not) I'd use Minute Rice and wouldn't add it or the cabbage until much, much later.

Wow! This was delicious we both ate 2 bowls!  I did use the very lean beef so the grease was minimal, I noticed a few reviews talked about that.  I love that I had to open, dump and there was a meal in my crockpot, no pre work. I  opened a can of tomatoes instead of sauce so I used the large can of diced Italian tomatoes and then about 1/2 can of tomato sauce.  I also forgot to put the rice in so I made and then stirred it in.  I put some parmesan cheese on top of my serving.  Very good!

My family loves this recipe so much i always double it so i recommend a large crockpot.. these are my alterations for this recipe: i cook the hamburger and onions together on the stove, drain and then because i doubled this  recipe i added 2 pks of onion soup mix, 2 cans of (regular size can) Italian diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup brown sugar, garlic salt, and tomato sauce.. i did not shred the cabbage i cut in strips..  i never add rice in the crockpot until the last half hour of cooking.. i repair my rice on the stove to make sure it cooked threwly...i hope my recipe helps :) enjoy

The rice just sucked up all the moisture and left a gooey tasteless mess. I even used Fire roasted tomatoes and added another cup of water. It did not help one bit.

It was pretty easy to make.  The slow cooker had the house smelling good.  But it was pretty bland, needs something to make it a bit more interesting.  Will not be trying this one again.

Unfortunately, this was a bust for my family.  Even my husband (who loves cooked cabbage) didn't like it.  I was disappointed, since when I looked at the ingredient list I thought it would be something we liked.

I decided to take a chance, despite the other reviews, and see if my rice would cook, but it simply would not.  We ate it, even though the rice was a bit "crunchy", and the rest was "mushy", but I will not make this recipe again. Since we liked the taste of the ingredients together, I may try a different version.

For me, this one is a keeper!  I don't add the pepper till serving time ... because I like LOTS of pepper on this.  And I forgot to add the rice when cooking, so I'll serve over steamed rice.

The reason I give it a 4 is because my small children really liked it.  Also, my friend's extremely picky 1-year-old really liked it too.  I thought it tasted OK, but didn't look like it would be good at all.
