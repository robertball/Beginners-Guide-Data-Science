I've made this several times and my family loves it!!!! I use Doritos instead of the tortilla chips.

used bison, bc we had it.  was pretty good, but didn't hold shape very well.  I'm not a big velvet fan, so will try it again with more chips & shredded cheddar.

These were tasty, but a little greasy/soft. If I made them again, I'd add more crushed tortilla chips to see if that cuts down on some of the moisture.
