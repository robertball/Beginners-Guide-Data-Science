I'm going to be honest and admit that this DIY sous vide method sounded hokey to me but I am here to tell you that it works and it works beautifully. I followed the recipe to the letter and these were by far the most tender steaks I have ever made. This will be my go to for ribeye from now on. 5 stars all of the way!
