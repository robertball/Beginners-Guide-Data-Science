This cheesecake was AWESOME! My boyfriend is in love with the sweet potatoe cheesecake we get here at Glady's Knight Chicken & Waffles Restaurant. He asked me to try and duplicate it, well this one came out better, sorry Glady's! I did add a few ingredients to enhance the flavors. 1/2 c chopped pecans and 1/2 tea cinnamon to crust. I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tea cinnamon, 1/4 tea nutmeg, 1/4 tea ginger and 2 tea  vanilla to filling. I used 2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes (definately bake the potatoes adds flavor). Don't over beat the filling and put a shallow pan of water on the rack below the cake for a flawless cheesecake w/o cracks every time. Baked 1hr 10 mins in 9" pan, removed from oven immediately when center was almost set. This cake is super rich and delicious, absolutely worth the effort. If you love cheesecake and sweet potatoe pie, you'll love this cake. Will be making this often.

With a few modifications, this was an excellent cheesecake!  I added some flavor(nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice) to the sweet potato puree, as if I were making a sweet potato pie.  I also cooked this in a waterbath, which added to the silky texture.  And finally, I added a bit of cinnamon to the topping, which was the perfect touch!  Great recipe for those who love sweet potato pie!

I thought this recipe was great. I just made a few modifications. I treated the sweet potato puree like the filling for a pie. I added cinnamon, a squeeze of lemon, a drop of vanilla extract, and a tablespoon or two of butter (sinful I know). I made if for Thanksgiving (with the topping) and Christmas (without the topping) and the family loved them both. I think this will be a new holiday favorite!

This was a great starter recipe.  I did add some cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of allspice to the puree.  I also omitted the pecans from the topping.  The recipe did not call for a waterbath but I used one anyway.  Before I added the eggs, I tasted the mix and decided I needed a bit more sweet potato because the flavor was a bit weak. I ended up putting about a third of a cup more potato puree.  This for Christmas dessert and it was a huge hit.  My first ever cheesecake was a definite success.

Tried this because it sounded interesting. Loved the flavor and made it as directed with the exception of adding cinnamon and nutmeg. Really, really good! Thanks for sharing.

Excellent cheesecake! For the crust, I used a combination of graham crackers and vanilla wafers and did not add any additional sugar. Instead, I added a little cinnamon.  I used a full cup of sugar in the batter and, like many other members, I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I've never made sweet potato anything without these seasonings. To me, it would have been bland without them. I was afraid the pecan topping was going to make the cheesecake too sweet but it was perfect.
This recipe goes into my permenant files.

I am a cheesecake purist, I love the taste of plain cheesecake, so the feature picture shown for this sweet potato cheesecake is misleading. It shows what looks like a marbled type cheesecake the kind a purist like me would like, pure cheesecake with small swirls of sweet potato, not the full on blended kind like this recipe suggests. As I started to create my cake I realized that there was no way I was going to combine the delicious delicate flavor of cream cheese with the heavy, fleshy sweet potato. So what I did was strain the sweet potato through a strainer (kept the fleshy part for pie) and took the smooth sweet potato, added cinnamon, nutmeg, and white sugar, all to taste, and smoothed it at the bottom of the pan over the crust THEN I put the creamy layer of cream cheese over that (omitted the pecan topping concoction) baked it in a water bath and it came out PERFECT! The best of both worlds without mixing them up.  My 4 star rating is for misleading picture and mixing sweet potato with creamcheese. But TOTALLY 5 stars for the cheesecake recipe itself!!! AND, taking a tip from another commenter, rather than using graham cracker crust, next time I will try a biscotti crust. Yum!

This was a very good cheesecake!  I only made one change, I seasoned the sweet potato puree with about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and nutmeg.  It is very rich, as most baked cheesecakes tend to be. This makes a very large, deep cheesecake.  The topping is a necessity in my opinion, it really complements the flavor of the cake.  I cooked three medium sweet potatoes, and had plenty of puree.  I will probably make this again during the holidays.

This is a great twist on a traditional Thanksgiving dessert.  I made several changes, starting with a gingersnap crust rather than a graham cracker crust.  I whirred commercial gingersnaps in the blender and then sieved them through a flour sifter.  I added 1/4 c butter as recommended for the graham crust, but no sugar. In the filling I used 2 packages 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  I made yogurt cheese by draining a nonfat thick Greek style yogurt for 24 hours and subbed that in for the third package of cream cheese to reduce the fat even more.  It still had a great taste and texture; I didn't really notice any difference.  As others suggested I added pumpkin pie type spices (vanilla, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon).  I tried reducing the sugar, but this is one recipe that is not overly sweetened and I ended up using the full amount.  I mixed all filling ingredients except for the sweet potatoes and reserved some plain filling.  I used this plain filling on the top to create marbling (it didn't work great because of the thickness of the filling, but it still looked good).  I made the praline topping, cooking it to 180 degrees F on my candy thermometer and served it warm on the side, rather than pouring over the top.  I baked in a water bath; it finished in about an hour and 10 minutes.  I used a 10 inch springform, but next time I will use a 7 inch because it's only about an inch and half thick and I like a loftier cheesecake.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I added butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the sweet potato puree, which seemed to work out well. I also only used 1/2 cup of pecans in the topping (that's all I had), but it still tasted great. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

OMG!!!  I had never even heard of this recipe before but I couldn't get enough. It is so unbelievably good. I did add a touch more sugar(maybe a 1/4 cup) and I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a few pats of butter to the sweet potato mixture. I baked the potatoes but I don't see why boiling them wouldn't work either. I also used just a regular store bought graham cracker crust just to save time and it was still crunchy and delicious with the cheesecake. You must try this recipe because it is wonderful!

This was a nice experiment but I don't think I will make it again. Most of my guests thought it was good but some ate it and didn't want to touch a second bite! And I don't think people would have eaten it without the pecan topping (which is amazing, btw)... Taste and texture are okay but this makes avery heavy dessert. Not everybody is ready for that kind of cheesecake!

I have eaten at Gladys Knights which is why I LOVE this cheesecake so much.  AFter I left ATlanta I looked for recipes and this is the second I tried and the best so far.  Like other users I added cinnamon, nutmeg and butter to my fresh puree before mixing with the cheesecake mix since I was looking for an authentic sweet potatoe pie flavor.  (I didn't do that with the other recipe and it wasn't as tasty.) I also saved a step and used caramel ice cream topping and pecans.  Delightful!  This is my go to recipe from now on.

I found this recipe for my husband to try and it turned out great. He added nutmeg and allspice like he was baking a sweet potato pie and he used only two packages of cream cheese instead of three. You can also buy a deep dish graham cracker crust if you want to skip a step. It's just as good as making your own from scratch. During baking, he sat the cheesecake in a shallow water bath to retain moisture.  This cheese cake was great. It was not too rich and not over powering in taste. The praline topping really set it off. A good, good recipe!

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake.  The recipe was simple to follow and the results were fantastic.  I didn't add anything not in the original recipe but I may try that in the future.  I took it to a holiday party and it was a success.

This was my first cheesecake ever and it was absolutely a hit!  My friends and family could not stop raving about it!!  I personalized the crust w/ 1 tsp. Ground Cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. Ground Ginger.  The sweet potato filling needs 2 tsp. Cinnamon, 1 tsp. Ginger and an extra 4 tsp sugar to balance that out.  Other than that this recipe is AMAZING!!!!

This cake was great.  The texture is perfect.  The taste of the sweet potato was too subtle, however, and could use a little more flavor.

I cheated a bit and used two 9-inch pre-made graham cracker pie crusts and canned sweet potatoes. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the filling and cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping. (Not too much nutmeg, because it can be overpowering.) It came out very good....a nice change from plain cheesecake. The topping was excellent and really brought out the sweet potato flavor.

We loved the recipe.  Instead of the graham cracker crust, I made this with a ginger snap crust.  In addition we added a little sweet potato to the filling.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars because I used a pre-made graham cracker crust.  I also added nutmeg, cinnamon, lemon and vanilla extracts to the sweet potato puree to give it some flavor.  It's a great recipe though.  My family loved it.  My sister in law actually offered to pay me to make her one. This is now a family favorite.

This is/was my first attempt at making cheescake and I absolutely LOVE it and so do my children...I am a little new at the baking thing so I would have liked to know how long to cook the brown sugar/butter concoction for the topping! Im a lil challenged! LOL There is so much to be thankful for at Thanksgiving, this cheesecake reminds me of that. Thanks for this recipe thanks cutie pie for the tips on what to add to really jazz it up. I'm not a fan of nutmeg or ginger with sweet potatoes so I omitted that but I did use nutmeg for the crust in the mini cheesecake cupcakes I made with the extra filing I had for the kids...I'm sure it'll be a hit my children love it including my 11 month old. Happy Thanksgiving, Allrecipers ; )

I've received RAVE reviews for this recipe.  I made this into cupcakes for my daughter's birthday party, and people are still talking about them.  My only suggestion would be to bake the graham cracker crust for only 5 minutes (instead of 10 min) to avoid burning or overbrowning the crust when you cook it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year (2011) and it was a HUGE hit!! I had run out of pecans, so had to substitute crushed walnuts, but it turned out very well.

While the cheesecake was very good, the sweet potato flavor was way too weak for me, and I put in the full 2 pounds. Next time, I will decrease cream cheese to 2 pkgs to hopefully get a stronger flavor. I also added 2 tsp cinnamon, a must need. The caramel topping is excellent, although it also does cover up the sweet potato flavor. I didn't bother leaving it in the oven for an hour after cooking. I cooked it like my favorite cheesecake recipe - I added 2 tbsp cornstarch to the sugar (mix so not lumpy) and cooked at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes, then cool.

Fantastic - my first time cooking with sweet potatoes and making cheesecake - it was a definite hit! It was a little crumbly near the edges. Added a little allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the sweet potato mixture.

Delicious!  I would absolutely make again.  There's only one thing I would like to have clarified; mash the sweet potatos instead of of puree them.  Puree involves adding a liquid to the sweet potato which could change the consistancy of the recipe.  It's not too sweet and not too "sweet potato-y".  Perfect.

This was the first attempt at making a cheesecake. I must say that it turned out really well. I did follow some of the other reviews and added cinnamon, nutmeg. It tasted just like a sweet potato pie. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again. Okay. This cheesecake could use a lil bit more sugar maybe 2 cups of sugar. And it doesn't have to bake for an hr. maybe about 50 mins. Please remove it from the oven when cooking, because the crust gets really dark. Thank God it didn't burn!

I agree with the above reviews in that the recipe is good, but leaves it wide open for variation.
Spicing it up is always a good idea. My selections were lemon zest, cinnamon, ground ginger (just a pinch). I would add nutmeg if I had any.
I think ground cardamom would work nicely in the crust to make it extra festive. I should try that next time. And there will be next time, I am sure.
Baked for about 55 minutes over a water filled roasting pan. No issues, no cracks.
As for the topping, I had to improvise because this cake goes to a school Thanksgiving feast, and they forbid nuts of any kind.
I used 2 packages of fresh cranberries, sugar, 1 lemon juice, cooked them all together, and added a bit of butter and cream in the end to make it look silkier and not like jam.
Great post, thanks!

This was very good. I made my crust with ginger snap crumbs...definitely a keeper! I've made this with spices added, and without...and I actually prefer it WITHOUT. With the ginger snap crust, and a dash or two of cinnamon in the caramel topping (I totally cheated with some Kraft caramels and heavy cream), it's perfect! I preferred a little more sweet potato. Do not over-beat the filled. Make sure the cream cheese and sweet potato are well blended first before pumping too much air into the other ingredients (for a smoother texture, and no cracks on top).

this was a success with my family for thanksgiving. However I do think that the recipes filling creates more than what the pie filling can hold. I would reccomend cutting the wet ingredients in half. I also added nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger to my topping to create more holiday flavors.

This recipe is so wonderful!  I made it last year for Thanksgiving and it was such a hit, my family has requested it again this year!  I did make a couple changes, but they were small.  I used crushed ginger snaps for the crust rather than graham cracker crumbs.  For ease, I used jars of sweet potato baby food and added a little cinnamon, vanilla extract and ground ginger to the puree.  Also, 15min before the cake was finished baking, I added a layer of sour cream and sugar mix to the top like a sort of frosting, then I swirled in caramel sauce so it had a marbled look.  I placed the pecans around the edges and in the center decoratively and then finished baking.  Very, very good!

This recipe made a very delicious basic cheesecake that filled up the entire springform pan. Would definitely make again.

Things I did differently: Baked sweet potatoes in microwave, scooped out flesh and whipped them with a hand mixer - came out nice and smooth. Added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a splash of molasses to the filling.

I'd argue heavy cream doesn't do much for the texture, and it would be okay if you omitted it. I did not make the praline topping, as the cake is already super rich, but did serve it with a homemade eggnog flavored whipped cream.

Nice, reliable recipe!

This recipe was a hit for Thanksgiving.  My family was so negative when told  about the cheesecake that I had brought.  They hadn't heard of this kind before.  Once it was served, all chattering stopped!  My grandmother "THE COOK" in the family asked me for the recipe.  Only thing I added was a little nutmeg and cinnamon.  Thanks for shutting up my family!

This is a great recipe! I've made it for Thanksgiving 2yrs running and have gotten nothing but praise for it. I do agree the sweet potato taste is very subtle as written, so next time I'll use the suggestions of the other reviewers. Overall, it's still a great recipe.

This was a solid recipe to work off of. I never made a sweet potato anything before so it came out good for first timer in the sweet potato category. Like everyone else, I added the nutmeg, cinnamin, and a little bit of ginger powder to the mixture. Agree, that it would have been bland without it. Also, I used ginger snaps and graham crackers for my crust. I also add walnuts to the food processor to add a nuttiness to the crust and it really makes it taste good. My husband is very critical of food and always gives me honest feedback and said he could eat the crust all day. The only complaint would be that the cake cake out a bit dry. Not sure what I could have done to make it moister. Also, I made this for a bake off and it didn't win because they said they could not taste the sweet potato. I think it's there and it's subtle but maybe add more next time. Topping tasted great with it.

I'm sure it is good as is, but I added 1.5 t of cinnamon, 1/2 t of nutmeg, 1/2 t of all spice, about 1/4 c of maple syrup (and reduced sugar amount). Even for the topping I added maple syrup and put less brown sugar. Also added bit of starch to thicken the topping. It was very good! I wish I had pureed sweet potato better as I could see few chunks here and there..lol Oh well, next time it will be closer to "perfection"! :D

spectacular - after eating at Gladys Knight's and trying her version, I had to make my own. LOVE Cutie Pie's moderations - thanks so much - this is a hit! And, it is even better than Gladys's (if that can be possible!)

Like other viewers, I added cinnamon and nutmeg to give more flavor. I also used cinnamon graham crackers for the pie crust. Absolutely love the glazed pecans! This is what makes the cheesecake and can be used to top off other pies, which I intend to do with just a plain sweet potato pie :)

I cheated as well and  used 2 pre made crust, that way I could have one cheesecake with the topping and one without for my friends who dont like/allergic to nuts.  I also used 1 pack of reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream as well as seasoned the sweet potatoes with vanilla, cinn & nutmeg..with all these modifications the pies were a hit! thanks!

This recipe was cut in half and poured into a store bought gramcracker pie shell. Gingerbread coffee mate creamer was substituted for the heavy cream.  The sweet potatoe was a faint back note. More could be added to increase the flavor. Over all very good. This was baked inside a 9/13 pan containing an inch of water to keep the cake from cracking. Will be making again.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I will do differently next time is leave out the topping. It was soooo good with so I wanna try it without even though I am sure it will still tast very delicious. My husband and everyone who tried it liked it so this will definitely be a keeper. Thanks Marabalet for posting it.

I wanted to make something to really dazzle my family on Thanksgiving and this recipes was just the thing. I added finely chopped pecans to the crust for a bit more taste. The topping was the most essential component though, it looked amazing. Thanks!

This was my very first attempt at making a cheesecake or using a springform pan. I made a few changes, but nothing major. I didn’t put the nuts on it since I’m not a fan. I used a 9.5” springform pan and lined it with parchment paper (sides and bottom, this made it super easy to remove the cake). I used pure cane sugar and added in some almond extract as well. It also took a little longer to cook for some reason, which was fine. I let it chill in the refrigerator overnight and it came out perfect. 
My daughter and son-in-law thought it was great even though they are big fans of sweet potatoes. 
For my first try, I think this was an excellent recipe to use. Even though I didn’t follow it to the letter, it provided an excellent starting point for me.

I added a pinch of vanilla extract and lemon juice it adds flavor to the sweet potato and cream cheese. Otherwise, this an awesome recipe. The cook timing was dead on. Will be repeating this recipe again soon.

Good base recipe. I used canned sweet potatoes for the purée and seasoned it with a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and I tiny bit of allspice. I skipped the topping in the recipe and instead candies my pecans and sprinkled them on top. FANTASTIC

Made this as is. The topping is very, very good. The texture wasn’t as smooth as, say, a New York style cheesecake, but it was still very, very good. I also prefer, in the future, to leave out the pecans, but that’s just a matter of taste.

OMG as a person who loves cheesecake and sweet potato pie this was awesome!  Like other reviewers I "seasoned" the sweet potato mix before adding to the cheesecake (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and butter).  It was a definite hit @ Thanksgiving. My bf suggested that next time I half the topping to swirl it thru the cheesecake instead of putting it on top to better incorporate the flavors.  WARNING: this cheesecake is very rich so if you don't like cheesecake or prefer those no bake versions then this might not be the recipe for you

I've made this recipe twice. Once exactly according to the recipe (good but not great) and again this past Thanksgiving with some changes. This time I used crushed gingersnap cookies as a crust and instead of mixing the sweet potato puree into the cheesecake mixture, I layered them.  My family loooooved it and actually fought over the last few pieces (all in good fun of course). Next time I will double the sweet potato layer and reduce the cheesecake layer by half. I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger into the sweet potato layer and about a tsp of vanilla into the cheesecake. I did use a water-bath and also let the cheesecake cool for an hour in the oven as instructed. I made the sauce without nuts due to family allergies. It was very good and set up quickly.  This recipe as is is pretty good but it doesn't become 5 star good until adding in the changes I made this year.

Very good.  Serve with fresh raspberries and whipped cream. I used two Graham cracker pie crusts.  Cut cook times by 15 or 20 minutes.

I made a few changes. Instead of adding the sweet potato puree into the cheese mixture, I layered the sweet potato puree,on top of the cheese mixture. This gave me three distinct flavors and a tri-level appearance! from the graham crust, cheesecake layer, and a beautiful vibrant orange sweet potatoe color. Also I prepared the sweet.potoes as.if I were making a pie,  with ground cloves, cinnamon,  nutmeg , brown sugar and butter. My family is still raving!

My family loves this cheesecake. It is a request for every holiday now. I might get locked out if I showed up without it. I have also made this for work and it is a big hit there as well

I don't love cream cheese in my cheesecake, so I substituted ricotta cheese for a more Italian-style cheesecake. It came out beautifully! I made the following changes based on the recommendations in the comments here: 

Used 3lbs of sweet potatoes and 2 packages of ricotta cheese (16 oz) for more sweet-potato flavor. 

Added fresh minced ginger and cinnamon to the graham cracker crust. 

Added pumpkin pie spices and vanilla extract to the sweet potato/cheese filling. 

I did not include the pecan topping, and didn't miss it at all! The cake was very flavorful without being too sweet. 

I baked this in a 9" pie dish, not a proper cake pan. I covered the bottom and sides with crust. I was afraid the graham cracker would be too crumbly, but it turned out great!

After i followed all the directions i tasted and added an extra 1/2cup of sugar (to taste), some of the comments added more sweet potato but I was happy with the faint flavor. I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla, couple shakes of ground clove, nutmeg and ground ginger. I wanted to cook in water bath but didn't have a pan big enough but not really needed since the glaze goes right on top no one could see all my cracks. I did cook longer than an hour it was more like hour and a half but I was checking every 10 mins after the first hour. I like a thicker cheesecake and texture wise it was great after I let it set properly (I was eager to try and cut too early)
Enjoy!

After following the directions for the cheesecake, I tasted and was VERY disappointed.  It had NO flavor; all I could taste was the cream cheese.  I added additional sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract.  It was a BIG.

This is my most requested Thanksgiving dessert. It is so amazing. It's a bit deceiving for the prep time because you need over an hour to bake and puree the sweet potato but it is so worth it. I bake and puree the sweet potato ahead of time and put it in the fridge. This way I only have to make the cheesecake the day before Thanksgiving which is super quick with the sweet potatoes all ready. I have to make two of these every year and I even have friends asking me to try and save them a slice!

OMG!!! This is a great recipe. I made this Christmas 2013. It was a home run with the bases loaded! Great taste if you really love sweet potato pie & cheesecake. The Carmel pecan topping was easy & carmelly, wow i know how to make Carmel! Just make sure guests enjoying don't have nut allergies. If they do serve the Carmel on the side. Thanks so much for sharing.

Excellent recipe!  A lot of times, recipes do not translate well to the plate, but this one is fantastic.  The flavor is mild but delicious.  I am so glad to have a nice recipe for sweet potatoes.

I followed it to a T, there are many reviews where cinnamon, burned, vanilla extract have been added, personally that to me tastes too much like a pumpkin cheesecake. If I would've wanted a pumpkin cheesecake, I would've made one. Nothing wrong with that, but I really wanted the taste of the sweet potato to stand out and not let be overwhelmed by anything else. So I followed it to a T and very happy with the results. I did however, boil the potatoes. Seemed much quicker that way.

The only modification I make to this recipe is adding nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger to the sweet potato puree and also using a water bath.  I am consistently asked to bring this to functions. This is a fantastic recipe.

I prepared this recipe exactly as stated in the ingredients and it looks just like the picture on the recipe page! I was pleasantly surprised that it does not have a "veggie" taste, just a great cheesecake.
