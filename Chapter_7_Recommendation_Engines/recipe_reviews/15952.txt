This is my all-time favorite cookie!!  I am always getting requests for them... they are "my signature cookies".  My recipe is different only that I use 2 eggs instead of 4, so if you are short of eggs...I'm telling you they turn out awesome with 1/2 the eggs.  I let them cool and top with a dollop of chocolate frosting - boil 6TB butter, 3/4 c sugar, 1/3 c milk for a minute, remove from heat and add 3/4 c chocolate chips, stir until thickened.  You must try these cookies!!!  Update for those having trouble getting the cookies off the waffle iron...you might want to give your waffle iron a spray of Pam before you drop the cookies on, after you make them a couple of times you won't need that.  Also, I use a Pampered Chef cookie scoop and drop into each compartment.  Have never put chocolate chips or nuts in them, I wouldn't suggest it though.

I've been making these cookies for years. I've never added nuts to mine.  I also add more cocoa, probably close to 3/4 cup.  I use a large family size waffle iron (not belgian) and drop one tablespoon full onto each section to cook. I always make a chocolate glaze, sometimes with mint, and after the cookies have cooled, I dip the tops in the glaze.

This is an awesome way to make cookies!!! I really liked these, easy to make and wonderful flavor. I did add caramel chips, and walnuts. My kids rated these 5 stars, my husband says 4, I gave these 5 due to ease and flavor. I took these to a ladies bible study and they went over well. I will definately be making these again.

I have made these cookies for years.  However, I use 1/2 cup softened butter and 1/2 cup crisco and I omit the nuts.  I chill the dough and it seems to work better - cooking for about 2 1/2 minutes each time.

I was not impressed with this cookie.  It was dry and lacked flavor.  Maybe this would be a good breakfast waffle with fruit but as a cookie it was very bland.

I've made these several times, ALWAYS a hit!  Simple to make.  I too would recommend a quick spray to the waffle iron with Pam before dropping them, worked like a charm.  After coming off the iron, I drizzled them with a simple confectioner's sugar & milk icing and they were even better!!

Did not care for the texture of these cookies.  Not crispy at all.  Kiddies were highly anticipating these and were left wanting.  Sorry, will not make these again.

Followed the recipe completely but did not like these at all. It was a mess to work with and hard to get off the waffle iron. The dough is like brownie mix and thick. We ended up breaking them up in small pieces and putting vanilla ice cream on top to use them up.  I thought the grandchildren would think this was fun to do but I won't make again. I will make brownies instead as it is a lot less messy and much better.

I gave it 5 stars with a few modifications. Substituted 1/4 cup more cocoa for flour, added 2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 cup of mini cinnamon chips. The 1.5 minute cooking time is right on  medium heat.

Very easy to make (once you figure out your waffle iron, of course) and lovely taste. Kids love them and I make them for bake sale as they are fast and easy to make. Try adding cocoa to just half of the batter and then add a spoonful of each colour! Makes lovely marble like effect.

A little tricky...either  kind of hard to get off the waffle iron without falling apart, or if you leave it on longer, it gets a little dark and crispy. Still tastes good though! Quick and easy, but hard to stop eating!

Just made these cookies - I was in a bind-needed something really fast and good.  These little cookies were the answer.  I will make again even if I have time for something else.

Great, easy recipe!  I add a little extra cocoa powder and mini chocolate chips in place of the nuts.  The chocolate chips are a mess to clean off the waffle iron, but I love the chocolate-y flavor!

I agree with the previous reviewer. These were very messy and would not come off the iron. I greased it well too. I gave up and made drop cokkies out of them. I will not make them again.

These cookies were not what I was expecting.  I made them exactly according to the recipe.  They turned out bland with a firm cake-like texture.  I was expecting a crisp cookie.  My kids were expectantly waiting to try the new cookies.  They were disappointed.  I ended up cooking the rest of the batch on a cookie sheet to speed up the process.  I will have to serve them with ice cream to use them up.

These cookies are delish! I found this recipe in search of a cookie like this that runs in my husbands' family. These are even better! (Which even he admitted!) I used 2 eggs as suggested from a previous reviewer. They turn out having the taste of a brownie, with a chewy, yet crunchy texture. I have to admit when I started making the cookies I was discouraged, as they didn't want to come off the iron. However, I soon discovered the trick is to turn the waffle iron over and drop them out onto a piece of wax paper.  These disappear quick!

Not a lot of flavor. I followed the suggestions and added extra cocoa powder, but I think they could use some extra sugar.  They were easy to make and very pretty in my heart shaped waffle iron, but I just didn't love them.

My husband says these taste like cake without the icing. The fam really liked them.  I would add some additional flavoring such as anise or peppermint or almond next time.  Will make again but will add a little more flavor next time.

I have a friend who has an awesome waffle cookie recipe, but she was out of town. I tried this one instead and it wasn't as good, but it was still yummy! It was almost like chocolate cake or brownies. I am at a high altitude and everything turned out great!

Good rich cookie, nice and chocolatey.  Kids loved them.  I used a cookie/ice cream scoop and got about 30 cookies.  I found that the easiest way to get them off the iron is to stick a fork right across the iron heating squares straight through the middle of the cookie and lift up.  My iron needed two minutes a batch.

I cooked these for 2 minutes in the waffle iron. I did some right after making the batter. The rest I did the next day, while the batter was still cold ( thank goodness for the Pampered Chef cookie scoops!) and did them for 2 minutes also. This yielded a still slightly gooey brownie in the middle ??

batter at first seemed too thick-with just 2 eggs-but the cookies cooked up very well.  I added the 3/4 c cocoa as mentioned in another person's rating, and they tasted pretty good.

These are a very easy cookie to make.  I only make them at Christmas time and my family and friends look forward to them.

I use a small round waffle iron that quarters the waffles and I sift the flour and cocoa.  I don't believe it works well on a Belgian waffle maker.

I warm my waffle iron on medium heat for about 5 minutes so that it is good and hot.  Always spray the top and bottom with some type of cooking spray.  When I feel it is hot enough I put my test ones on and cook for 2 minutes, that way they are good and done.  Maybe even over done.  From then on I put the dough on the waffle iron on medium heat and leave on for 1 minute and 15 seconds, yes I do time it.  Using a fork I separate along the lines of the waffle iron and then lift each one out using a fork.

I cool them and store over night the next day they will be moist.  I mix a chocolate frosting and spread over the waffle cookie and wait for my family to finish them off so I can make more!!!

I only made 1/2 a recipe to see if we liked them. We did. They were really yummy!  I doubled the cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Kiddos thought these were great. Quick and easy. 
We made 4 at a time. One scoop in the middle of each waffle section.

Yummy!  After I burned the first batch (waffle iron set too high--woops!) I got the hang of it.  Very cute, quick, and so easy!  I will definitely try again.  I used some leftover canned vanilla icing--just popped in microwave to melt and then drizzled over the cookies.  The icing mentioned by another reviewer sounds great.
