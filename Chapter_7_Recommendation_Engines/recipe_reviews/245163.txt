Really good and energizing! Instead of brown sugar and peanut butter, I put 1 tablespoon of maple syrup :)

This shake seemed to throw all but the kitchen sink in it...berries, peanut butter, AND cocoa. I don't usually think of those three being in the SAME shake or smoothie, but this one tasted pretty good. I used a very small banana I happened to have in the freezer (had the intention of using just half a banana instead of the entire thing anyway) and stevia instead of the brown sugar.

Great after my evening workout.  I left out the cacao powder and peanut butter.  I added chia seeds and kept it simple with frozen bananas, almond milk, green protein and milled flaxseed.  It also satisfied my sweet tooth that normally hits me after the gym.
