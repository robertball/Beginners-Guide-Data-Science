Actually, no, it doesn't take that long, and I do it by hand... I guess it just depends on how efficient you are in the kitchen :) They don't have to be perfect matchsticks! I think the general concensus around here is not to rate things you haven't actually made, but thanks for the feedback.

Great recipe! I included fresh jalepeno since I like the heat. Also, for those concerned about the raw onions, you can reduce the effect by cutting to a very small dice instead of matchsticks, and soak it in the dressing while you cut the other ingredients so it loses some of the raw bite.

I have made this about 5 times without changes and it is a terrific recipe.  Everyone who has eaten it has asked for the recipe.  Trader Joe's sells mango and jicama spears that make the preparation really easy.

I made this yesterday and it was wonderful. Ordinarily my husband detests mango and this kind of food, but we ate nearly the whole salad between us. The very little left over will go into fish tacos for today's lunch. Unfortunately, my jicama proved to be rotten internally, but I substituted carrot with great success. I served the salad with jerk pork tenderloin and a hot black bean casserole. I can't wait to serve this salad to guests. I hope that I can find more recipes from this same source.

I loved this salad, so fresh and tasty with just the right amount of hot punch. First time I ate jicama too, will make it again adding some apples and cucumbers.

Made this last night for dinner and my Husband and I loved it.  Great crunch and very fresh and tangy.  Served it with cold colossal shrimp and it was the perfect light dinner for a hot summer evening.  Will be making this all summer!

I went to Trader Joe's to get their Jicama Mango Slaw, only to learn they have discontinued it...so I looked up this recipe quickly and got the ingredients while still at the store.  Except this recipe is way better than theirs!  Only change I made was to also add some shredded cabbage, to make it a little more slaw-ish.  I plan to serve it with shredded pork tacos (carnitas) and think it will be a great compliment, whether on the side, or in the taco.

I served this with fish tacos last night. My family hadn't had jimica before. My son described it as 'apple meets celery.' Having the mango, jimica, jalapeno and lime together was a great flavor. The salad kept really well overnight.

I have made this salad multiple times, and it was always appreciated.  I admit that I throw in a bit of extra mango because frankly, most people enjoy a bit of extra of that.  The lime brings a nice refreshing flavor to it and the red pepper adds another touch of color.  Worked well for a recent potluck, as well as other previous events.  I will definitely make this again.  You may end up with three potato salads at a potluck, but rarely will you end up with multiple mango/jicama salads.  :)

I make this all the time. If you cant find good mango, you can use Mandarin oranges in their own juice and omit the honey.   You can also add a pinch of salt.  Sometimes I omit the onion.

I made this for a barbecue dinner with a large group of friends and was asked for the recipe, so yes we all liked it. I did follow other reviewers suggestions and reduced the salt by half and doubled the cayenne.

Made it for dinner tonight.  Hate to be the only one who rates it less than 5 stars, but, we thought that it was just OK.  I probably won't make this again.

I make this every year on Boxing Day. Everyone loves it- even the kids. What’s really nice is that jicama doesn’t brown when exposed to air, so I can peel and slice all of the jicama (the hardest part) a day ahead of time. Note: don’t add the onion until just before serving.

I’ve made this recipe now a dozen times. I love it each time! I do add avocado, and just use lime juice, no honey or cayenne pepper. Maybe one of these days I’ll try that. Delicious recipe, thank you!

Very tasty and light. Good summer salad to have ready to go in the fridge. Goes will with tacos. My honey and I highly recommend.

Followed suggestions to cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and honey to 1tbsp. Added a granny smith apple -- really brightened up the flavor. Only added 1/3 of the red onion and 1/2 of the cilantro.

Very good, and it will be on our Thanksgiving table. The only change: reduced the honey to one tablespoon. Otherwise, the other flavors are masked.

I got an unexpected mail order produce box  last week including 2 jicama, 1 mango, 3 limes, and a big bunch of parsley. I found this searching for jicama recipes, and decided it was a perfect match. I doubled the recipe, using frozen mango to make up for the difference. I used ripe mango and cut the honey in half.  My husband and I are not fond of cilantro, do I used a mix of parsley and basil. Since I was one lime short, I added about 1 tbs waste and the rind of one lime. I also decreased the salt ro a dash. I skipped the pepper because I currently have laryngitis and need to avoid spicy foods. Great mix of flavors. We're having it as a side dish tonight, and it will be snacks for the rest of the week.

Awesome!
I did replaced Jicama with turnips, as my grocery store was out of jicama.

Everyone loved it!
I think I will try adding a tiny bit of jalapeno next time for color and spiciness

I made a few changes in proportions, 2 mangos, yellow sweet pepper, red pepper flakes, 5 spice, cinnamon but have all listed ingredients in there except cayenne. I like this receipe.  Faster to use very sharp paring knife to peel mango and jicama skin.

Made this delicious salad for a party and it was a hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The time it takes to cut up a fresh jicama is worth it.  Made it a second time and it stayed fresh and crisp for 4-5 days. Next time will be trying it in fish tacos!

I made this to put on top of pulled pork tacos. My husband really enjoyed it as did I. I used jalapenos instead of red pepper. I added red pepper flakes, upped the lime and lowered the honey. I will try to lessen the honey more next time. My mango was very ripe and it was very sweet. I minced the onion as well. It was very very good though.

Excellent!  I cubed my mango because it was ripe and not firm enough to matchstick.  I added a handful of dried cranberries for extra color and because they needed to be used.

delicious. i didnt do this, but you could easily add either black beans or edamame to give it some protein and make it more like a meal. flavors are on point. i used lemon instead of lime (what i had) & it was still really great

I thought it was fine but it didn’t ring my bell. I think it would be better with ripe rather than hard mango.  I like all of the elements, and the dressing was tasty, but the salad as a whole just seemed to be lacking.

I bought my first jicama, and didn't have a clue what to do with it. Did an ingredients search and it lead me to this recipe. Very tasty and refreshing. Perfect for a side dish on a hot summer night. Tonight we are having this as a side to pulled pork sandwiches. Would be great with fish tacos too!

I substituted mint for celantro and also added some sorrel that I had on hand.  Also used maple syrup for honey.  No Cayenne at the moment so I used red pepper flakes.  All the tastes blended nicely to have a refreshingly special salad.  I think it was important that the mango was not over-ripe.  My husband asked for seconds!

Sliced the jicama on the mandolin using a higher "French fry" cut. My jicama was huge! Used just one red bell, and only about 1/3 of the onion.  I am presenting the salad tomorrow, so I didn't dress it quite yet. I will update this review after the office comments.

Lots of flavor, color, and crunchy texture! We ate it as a side with Cuban Steak. I think it would be fantastic with seafood, maybe grilled shrimp with this salad as a side. I saved it as a favorite and plan on making it again.

I just made this. Very delicious and refreshing. I made in matchsticks like the directions say. Next time I will chop it like the picture instead. I am pretty good with the knife and it still took a while. Definitely worth though!

Perfect salad for hot weather.  Worth the trouble of cutting up the jicama.

Very refreshing! Great flavor. I just made a few changes: 
Instead of cutting everything into matchsticks - I cut them into cubes. Instead of using fresh mangos, I used frozen mango chunks & I omitted the onions because I hate raw onions! 
I'll definitely make this again.

My stepdad tried it to be polite cause he knows he doesn't like jicama... But he actually loved the salad. I served it as a side with ceviche and was perfect.
