I have been so busy eating I took a long time to get to reviewing this recipe. :P   I wasn't really expecting much with it being so simple and using easy "on-hand" ingredients.  THIS PIE IS AWESOME!  We have already made 3 of these!  We tried black cherry kool-aid first, and is was super-sweet, so the next time we used pink lemondade kool-aid, it was lighter but still really sweet.  Last night I used lime kool-aid and it was perfect.  Light and not too sweet, but hubby and my son still want to try grape, and orange flavors.  Good thing its still early in the summer! Two of my friends are already using the recipe also, calling it a cheater key lime pie recipe.  Thanks for a great, quick, easy summer recipe!

Yummmy!!!  Fast and easy.  We did Lemon-lime first.  Then orange. The Lemon lime was a great Keylime knock off.  The orange pie, I added 4 oz more cool whip and it tasted just like a dream sickle... OH MY.. I wonder how it would turn out if you froze it to make something like a Icecream cake...Hummm.

this was a hit.  I made my own crust and used a 9x13 pan.  I used the lemon-lime flavor koolaid.  I used a flower cookie cutter as a template and sprinkled pink sugar in it to make cute pink flowers on top.  I had requests for the recipe.

Quick and easy.  Not bad with Lemon-Lime flavor on a Graham cracker crust.  A fun summer treat!

I made this recipe as stated and it was great. I used lemon lime kool aid and it does taste like a key lime pie. Can't wait to try other flavors! I think I will make this one for church. Thanks for the super simple recipe.

I haven't made this yet but will make it this week. Cute story as to how I got the recipe:  My friend and her 3 yr old daughter were at the grocery store yesterday.  An elderly man who was stocking shelves stopped them and was being very chatty and friendly and said, "I know something your little girl would love. It's called a Kool-Aid pie!"  He told her how to make it, she bought the ingredients right then and made it as soon as they got home. The whole family loved it and she gave another friend and me the recipe last night.  My kids will LOOOVVVE this! Thanks!

I thought this was just okay. Maybe it was the flavor I used...strawberry.  It tasted okay but it looked exactly like silly putty! I might try it again with lemonade flavor.

I first made this pie in 7th grade Home Economics class and I still have the recipe 30 years later!  A nice light, refreshing summer treat.  Easy enough for the kids to make.  Lemonade flavor is awesome.

Will never make this again. It was like soup in a pie crust. Way too sugary.

I just made this. I couldn't find lime drink mix so I used lemonade flavor. I used fat free whipped topping and added about an extra four ounces of it. This was a big hit with my kids...my hubby fell asleep before he got to try it. So easy and now I want to try every flavor to see which is our favorite. We all loved it. Perfect summer dessert!!

I used Strawberry coolaid, and followed the recipe exactly.  Sooo good. I don't really like graham cracker crust, but the filling was tasty, and fun.  To be precise, though, I thought it was okay by itself, but delicious when paired with fresh blackberries. Everybody loved it. :)

This was good but very sweet.  I used cherry cool-aid. If I made this again, I would probably follow another reviewer's advise and use lime and turn it into a quick key lime pie. It was fun for something different but nothing to right home about.
