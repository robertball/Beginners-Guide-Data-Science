Excellent recipe! Chicken stayed juicy, it was well seasoned and quick to make. I used it over a salad.

I needed a quick weeknight dinner in this 90+ degree heat that had me not wanting to go near the stove. However, this was so quick and easy! I’m glad I found this. I didn’t change a thing and it came out perfect. My husband came home late from work and was surprised I cooked. He loved it also. I paired it with lemon-pepper angel hair pasta. I will definitely be making this again! I’m sure my grandchildren will also love this dish.

Super easy and not a lot of clean up - makes for a good weekday quick meal.  It seems like a very versatile recipe too.  I followed it as written, which was good, but you can see how you can change the spices used to make it an almost new dish each time.  I will definitely make this again!

This is delicious! Easy to make. Spices are just right! ( I didn't have Cajun Seasoning so will purchase it today and make this recipe again. Even without the Cajun seasoning the meal is delicious!

I used yellow curry powder instead, since that’s what I had. Also used dried chopped onion instead of onion powder. Again, because that’s what I had. It’s still cooking, but smells amazing. I’m topping it on steamed Wild rice, steamed spinach on a pita wrap. I’m so anxious to try it.
