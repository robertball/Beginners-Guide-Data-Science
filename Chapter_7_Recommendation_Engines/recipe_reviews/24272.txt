Good recipe, though I replaced the oil with butter and used less flour.

Another reviewer asked why the baking soda bath is necessary: Old world Germans used to dip their brezels (pretzels) in a solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) and water before baking. Lye is a very strong and caustic alkaline. Because most people aren't comfortable mixing lye and water to make pretzels, baking soda - a much weaker alkaline - is now used in most pretzel recipes.

Once the pretzels begin baking, a 'Maillard reaction' occurs. This is a chemical reaction sortof like carmelization, which allows the exterior crust to become a deep rich brown color. The reaction accelerates in an alkaline environment, which - you guessed it - has been provided by the baking soda bath. The baking soda, and resulting reaction, is also responsible for the unique taste of a pretzel.

Without the baking soda bath the pretzel exterior ends up pale/white, and taste more like bread. This baking soda / lye bath step is paramount in making a pretzel a pretzel.

I have gotten into baking breads, etc. since my wife bought a baking stone. This recipe is very good. The pretzels didn't last long. 

Here's what I will do next time I make a batch:
After dividing the dough into 12 pcs., roll the dough out into a rope at least 20-24" long. The dough will expand. 

Spray "I Can't Believe Its Butter" after I place the pretzels on the sheet and sprinkled coarse salt. I tried this on 3 pretzels from my first batch and they were better tasting. 

Use a rack that's up higher in the oven to prevent burning of the pretzels bottoms. 

Make sure my wife stands over me to supervise.

WOW!! These pretzels are absolutely amazing.  They were soft and chewy on the inside, awesome flavor, with that great authentic thin "pretzel" crust on the outside.  I spooned the melted butter over them after baking which soaked in and was just perfect.  My husband described them as "heavenly", haha, never heard him use that one before!  Next time I will bake at maybe 415 or lower to keep them from being too brown before being done in the middle.  I've been searching for a pretzel recipe and this one was much easier than most that I found.  Tip: let dough rise in your oven, no heat, just turn on the oven light.  Provides a draft free, warm place for dough to double flawlessly.  Also use a damp kitchen town instead of plastic wrap to cover bowl and you won't have a dry crust to your risen dough.  I do this with all of my bread recipes!

These are better than Auntie Anne's or Pretzel Time!! My kids ate all 12 within 10 minutes - I couldn't believe how good these were !! I wish I had made a triple recipe.  They all said they tasted BETTER than the ones at the mall - I agree ! And a lot cheaper making them yourself ! I was puzzled why the recipe called for them to be dunked in a baking soda and water mixture - if anyone knows why, please explain? I did it anyways. The changes I made = I used 4 cups of flour instead of 5.  I used organic pure cane sugar  and All Natural sea salt and instead of vegetable oil (I used super healthy 'Organic Virgin Coconut Oil by Tropical Traditions') and also used that to grease the bowl the dough was to rise in. After putting the pretzels in the soda/water mixture, I put them on parchment paper which I sprayed with Olive Oil spray (instead of greasing) and then I sprinkled Kosher salt on the tops of them (on a few others I did cinnamon w/Raw sugar).  The oven temp. seemed way to high even at 415, so on the second batch I decreased it to 400 degrees for 8 minutes - they got browned very quickly on top.  After removing them from the oven I brushed melted UNsalted butter over the tops and bottoms of them - saturating them with butter (I did not put any more salt on after the butter).  
Loved the recipe -- the rolling took a while,didn't have a lot of patience - I didn't roll them on the table, I just rolled them between my hands vertically until the 'snake' became long and thin.

Update to my review from over a year ago... I'm still making these pretzels and love them because they are soooo easy.  I've found the sea salt is the absolute best thing to top them with (but be sure to use kosher salt in the dough),


Excellent recipe!  I've found it is best to add 3.5 cups of flour and slowly mix in the final half cup as I'm kneading the dough.  I've made these at least 4 times in the past 2 weeks.  They freeze up great!  Just thaw and pop in the oven for a couple minutes for an awesome snack!!

I couldn't understanding why other reviewers had such a hard time with the dough....then it dawned on me, I did not follow the instructions.  I looked at the water, yeast, salt sugar content, mixed all those together and THEN added as much flour as it could hold.  That is what I do for all breads, because the amount of flour can vary according to type, weather etc.  I found it very easy to knead and roll out.  I faced the problem of them sticking to the pan (I don't have a non stick pan).  I oiled the pan well, but the water from the soda mixture caused them to stick somewhat.  I was suprised I did not read another reviewer having the same problem.  We brush with butter when they come out of the oven and drizzle with honey.  Thanks for the great recipe.

As I was reading the reviews, I was pretty unsure about how it was going to turn out. I halved the recipe, because it is just my boyfriend and I, and this was my only mistake! I made them as the recipe stated, using the dough hook on my mixer. I added flour until the dough was no longer sticky, so I do not know exactly how much I ended up using. When rolling out the dough I came up with a trick. You need to make them much thinner than you think, so i rolled small pieces into thin (like about the thickness of a finger) sticks, then joined two together to get them as long as I needed them to twist. I made the dough quite thin, but they puff up a lot, do not worry! I also dipped my pretzels in the baking soda mix, which I think really makes the whole pretzel. When they cook they get this browned yumminess on the bottom, that tastes JUST like the ones at the mall. I just drizzled them with butter and a little kosher salt when they came out warm... they were gone right after that. Will make again and soon!

Excellent! I used to work in one of the pretzel places in the mall- and this recipe is on point! A couple of tips though: yes, you will need to add a bit more water, but also about a teaspoon more oil as well- this will help smooth out the dough. The soda bath is necessary for browning- and if you expect the salt to stick this is the best way to do it (add salt after wetting the pretzels). If you have trouble dipping the pretzels, wet a paper towel with the soda mixture and blot them instead. Also- it's best not to flour your surface when rolling pretzels. If you add a bit more oil as I said before, then the dough will be smooth and not stick. When you divide, cutting the dough ball as if it were pizza slices will help with the rolling as well. Start at the middle of the piece and work your way out to the ends. The cut dough will dry quickly and become awkward to work with- to avoid this keep plastic wrap on what you are not working with at the moment. When they come out of the oven use a paper towel to blot butter on them- it will help to keep them soft- if you are opposed to butter then cooking sprays are just as well.

I've been using this recipe for a few years, and have found it to be my most popular bread. My friends STRONGLY encourage me to bring pretzels to most events.
A few recommendations- use higher gluten flour to get a little more chewiness. I always need at least 1 1/2 cups of water, sometimes more. The softer the dough, the easier shaping the pretzels is. I bring the soda solution almost to a simmer and soak the pretzels for about 10 seconds each. I also only use 2 or 3 tsp of yeast.

These were DELICIOUS! They taste just like the ones at the mall. They're that good. But I did read the reviews before hand, and decreased the flour. As an alteration I used brown sugar instead of white, I think it tastes better.

Really good! I did knead this more with my mixer for another 3-4 min. It needed to rise for almost 2 hrs. before it looked ready. When I dumped it out of the bowl the dough was perefect. Soft, pliable like it's suppose to be. After dipping in the soda water I allowed the pretzels to sit for another 15 min. for a 2nd small rising. I used an egg wash before baking. THEN I applied the butter after they came out of the oven. This is a must.!!  It's what keeps the pretzels from becoming hard like a dough does after baking. I did have to use MORE flour as I kneaded the dough..not less. I recommend this recipe for intermediate and advanced bakers, tho.

Good recipe!  I used to work at Pretzel Time as a kid, and this recipe is very close to how they make it.  It's just a little heavy on the sugar and flour.  Next time I make I'll probably cut back the flour by 1/2-1 cup and the sugar by just a couple tablespoons or so.  For the baking soda bath cool or lukewarm water works better for the dough, and there's way too much baking soda in that bath.  Maybe half is needed otherwise you can really taste the baking soda.  Also no need to flour the surface if done right; the dough will slide on the surface instead of rolling properly.  Rolling tips: after you let the dough rise, punch it down, roll it into a ball, throw it in an air tight plastic baggy, and throw it in the fridge for an hour or so (just like in the mall.  Letting the dough cool makes it more elastic.  Next take your cool dough ball out of the fridge and it's baggy.  Again do not flour the surface.  Cut a 4 oz strip of dough off.  Now before rolling dip your finger tips in the baking soda bath and rub what you get on your fingers all over your hands.  Start in the middle with both hands and roll using medium pressure.  As you roll work your hands out to the ends.  You're done when the dough is about the thickness of a finger.  Grab each end and slap on your surface like a jump rope about two or three times.  Be careful here not to use too much force or the dough will tear.  Next form your pretzel either mid air (advanced) or on your rolling surface.

This is an awesome recipe! I'm looking for items to make for a bake sale. So glad I found this recipe! Even tried another recipe from another site to compare and those came out tasting more like bread sticks than pretzels! The baking soda water bath is key. Also I had such a hard time using flour to roll the pretzels and found a how-to video from Auntie Anne's pretzel company online and it suggested not using flour while rolling the pretzels and it worked! I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 4 cups of flour. And use a clean towel or a few sheets of papertowel for blotting excess water after dipping pretzels--also on the how-to video. And so I made these soooo many different ways, too! Salt, Cinnamon and sugar, cinnamon raisin, apple cinnamon (just dice two small apples in small pieces add it and 1 tblspoon of apple pie spice to ingredients while mixing dough. It makes the dough a little stickier when rolling out, but well worth it in the end!), pumpkin spice (used all 5 cups of flour and just a little more and add 1 cup of pumpkin puree, and 1 tblspoon pumpkin pie spice to dough while mixing).This recipe is awesome, do yourself a favor and try it!

These are very yummy and I have others ask for the recipe. The first time I made these, I made 1/2 butter/kosher salt and 1/2 cinnamon sugar/honey butter. The cinnamon ones were the favorite!  They would be excellent for bread sticks as well I'm sure! 
Here's what I do: I cut the flour down to 4 cups not 5- definately do this! Also- 4 tsp. of yeast equals 2 packets. I let the dough rise 1 1/2 hours on the counter and then in the fridge overnight, I spread the dough out on the counter and use a pizza cutter to divide it into 16 pieces (not 12). That way there are more servings and they are still definately big enough. Don't skip the baking soda step. If I want to make salted pretzels I sprinkle the kosher salt (sparingly) on before baking (for cinnamon sugar of course I don't add this step). Bake on a high rack in the oven at 415 degrees- not 450. When they come out I brush on melted butter. For cinnamon sugar pretzels (our favorite!) I brush on butter mixed with 2 T. honey and sprinkle with a mix of 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon. They are very tasty like this! I think next time I will try twisted breadsticks with a garlic/butter mix for the brushing.

Hi, my name is Anna and I'm 13 years old. These pretzels are AMAZING!! I made half a batch of pretzels and half a batch of pretzel dogs. I mad the pretzel dogs by wrapping the pretzel strings around a hot dog sausage. I omitted the kosher salt topping, and baked an extra 5-10 minutes at 350 degrees. I also brushed with egg whites along with the baking soda solution to give it more of a shinier apperance. Hope this helps somebody out there! :)

Excellent!  As good or better than pretzels at the mall-without a doubt.  I've made these twice and my only suggestion is to measure out the flour  and start with about three cups...add the rest slowly.  Mine simply would not hold 5 cups of flour.  The first time I made them they were a little tough because of this...second time I used about four cups and added a bit more water until the consistency was right.   For this reason four stars but worth the time and effort.

This recipe is excellent, easy to follow and never fails to impress! I've made these pretzels with different spices as well as different cheeses - cheddar is always a big hit.   But. there are three very important things to note in order to get the best results possible:  1) Make sure to add the flour gradually. This will help make sure the dough doesn't become too dry. 2) Dampen your hands periodically with a little bit of water when rolling out the dough. It will help give you greater grip and control without over-drying the dough from too much flour. 3) Dipping the pretzel dough in the baking soda water is necessary to get the crispy outside and soft inside, but can be brutal for your baking sheet. Make sure to use non-stick spray or oil to prevent burning and sticking.

These were excellent.  One huge regret, I didn't double the recipe!  I will from now on.  The baking soda bath added a nice flavor and color.  I think next time I make this I'll play around with letting the shaped pretzels proof for a bit and boiling for about a min in the baking soda bath.  Possibly an egg wash before baking too.  I want to see if I can get the outside a touch chewier but these were far better than the mall pretzels in my opinion.  My 9 year old daughter figured out a way to shape them quickly.  She formed the dough into a small thick stick and then picked it up by both ends and swung it around like a jump rope until it was long and thin.  Worked great and really fast.  450 was too hot for our oven so we lowered it to 400 and they turned out great, perfectly browned and cooked inside after 8 minutes. We only needed to use about 4 cups of flour.  Thanks for a great recipe!  We will definitely be making these again!!  What a fun activity for kids too.

This is a good recipe. Tastes just like the pretzels from the stores. I didn't change anything. I added 1 tbsp water as suggested in the recipe because the dough was a bit dry. My dough at first was a little mushy after the 1 tbsp but after kneading it a bit, the water was absorbed leaving a drier, workable dough ( dough will be still a bit sticky but this is normal). Rolling the dough was  A LOT of fun, at least for me it was. Give yourself plenty of counter space and start rolling inward than outward, slowly stretching the dough (don't be afraid to really pull the dough). The pretzels brown nicer if your pretzels are thin. I would advise baking no more than 4 pretzels per cookie sheet so you won't crowd them together and mess up the shape. I did not flour my surface because I saw a video where an aunt anne cook did not use any and surprisingly the dough didn't stick. Another tip is, after you dip the pretzels in the baking soda mixture, rest the bottom of the pretzel on a clean, dry dishcloth a few seconds so you won't have too much water accumulating underneath the pretzel on the cookie sheet. This can cause  your pretzel to brown too much underneath. To make cinnamon sugar topping, dip hot pretzel in 1/2 cup butter and then in a mixture of 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon (or more if you'd like). You should also rotate the sheet 180 degrees after 5 mins to evenly brown the pretzels.

12/12/2010 - I made these this morning, and they are already almost gone.  Pretty sad that four of us have eaten 10 pretzels already, but they are so good.  These are buttery, sweet, and so soft.  My husband has already requested another batch of these.  Your house will smell like you are in a mall walking past one of those pretzel shops.  Definitely a must try recipe!
I am rating this because of the low rating before this.  It is NOT too much baking soda.  Boiling the pretzels in the water with baking soda gives it the crust that it needs.  I have done this many times with pretzels, bagels, and pretzel bread.  Try the recipe (or at least read it all the way) before giving a negative rating.  So sad!

Very easy and good. I used to be a manager at a pretzel shop years ago and this is how we made them. A few tips... After dipping pretzel in the baking soda/water mixture, place on a dish towel or layer of paper towels to dry the bottom off, this will help prevent the bottoms burning. Also, use parchment paper. Oven should be at 400-415 (parchment paper cannot be used above 420). Turn baking sheet halfway through for even browning. I used tongs to dip the face of the pretzel in a pie plate of melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven. Next time I will try adding raisins to the dough for a breakfast pretzel.

I made pretzels one night, then used the recipe for a loaf of bread the next night.  The pretzels were good, but the bread was EXCELLENT.  I braided my dough into two "loaves," brushed them with a wash of egg and milk, then sprinkled them with seasoned salt before baking (just like at Luby's Cafeteria).  I'm ashamed to say I ate almost a whole loaf!  It was sooo good!!

As always, i read the most helpful reviews before making these. i made the following modifications based on the reviews and the results were spot on.    i followed other suggestions and used 4 cups of flour. The only other modifications I made were adding vanilla brown sugar in the dough.  I proofed the yeast by dissolving it into 1/4 cup warm water and one teaspoon of sugar and let it sit until bubbly, around 10 minutes.   I put all the ingredients into my bread machine and let it do all the work.  I made a few in the traditional pretzel shape, but most i rolled into ropes about the size of a finger and made pretzel sticks. I dipped the pretzels into the water/baking soda solution and let it sit for a few minutes. if you are making traditional style pretzels, they may become untwisted in the water, just reshape them on the baking sheet.   The key is using parchment paper to bake these or they will stick, because the water solution makes the dough very sticky.    I also followed the advice of others and reduced the oven temp to 400 degrees, and baked for 8 minutes. I did not sprinkle with salt before baking.    Immediately after taking the pretzels out of the oven, I brushed them liberally with melted butter. I sprinkled some with a sugar/cinnamon mix and topped the others with just a little kosher salt.   My son inhaled them, and hubby moaned with delight while devouring them.  They both said they were as good as the Mall pretzels. All 12 were gone in 10 minutes.

WAY too much flour in the recipe.  Please don't rate the recipe based on the changes you have made.  I made the mistake of making this without reading the reviews and it failed miserably...and I'm usually pretty good at making bread.

These turned out delicious! And even better the next day!! I made them with bread flour instead of all purpose and they came out wonderfully soft and slightly chewy. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe, as is. We have made a lot of pretzels and find the shaping annoying, so we made bites instead. Also, for those having trouble with rising issues, etc., this recipe calls for active dry yeast, you should check to make sure you aren't using bread machine yeast, which is instant and needs no preparation in sugar water. When using instant (bread machine) yeast, just mix it in with the dry ingredients, then add the warm water as usual. I hope this is helpful. It's also important to keep in mind that flour packs down, so if you aren't shaking it up a bit before measuring, then you are probably actually getting more than the required amount. Loosen your flour before measuring it out and you may find that you don't need less after all.

I experimented with this recipe by brushing the pretzels with melted butter before baking, and dipping in melted butter after baking, and I quickly discovered that I was merely adding fat, not flavor! They miraculously have a wonderful buttery flavor without any butter. Super tasty.

Not Mall Pretzels... they're better! Thanks Christa.

You will never need another recipe for soft pretzels again, honest!!!! These have the great flavor of the mall pretzels.  So delicious.  I just rolled mine out into long pieces of dough and chopped into small nuggets.  Yum!  Oh, byt the way, I have baked these at 450 degrees and 425 degrees to see which is better and mine were more soft and golden baked at 425, but that is my preference. Oh, and I also only used 4cups plus a large pinch of flour so they weren't too dry. Great recipe!!!!

One Word - AWESOME!!!  To make a bit more healthy I substituted 2 of the 3 cups of white flour for whole wheat flour.  I used my kitchen aid to do all the kneading.  To let the dough rise, I heated my oven to 200 degrees and then turned it off for about 15 or 20 minutes and placed the kneaded dough in the oven.  It doubled in about an hour and 20 minutes.  Instead of greasing a pan, I used parchmant paper.  Once in the over, they only took about 6 minutes to bake up golden brown.  As soon as I got them out of the oven, I sprayed some low calorie fat free spray butter on them and brushed the butter into them with a pastry brush.  The result is simply outstanding!!!  I've tried numerous other pretzel recipes and this one is by far the best and actually the easiest too. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

These came out awesome!  I used all 5 cups of flour and ended up adding about 5-6 tbsp of water, and wetting my hands a little while kneading the dough.  When I divided the dough, I initially only made 6 sections because it didn't look like enough to make a big pretzel, and the three pretzels that I rolled were 3/4"-1" thick, so my first three pretzels came out HUGE!  For the second batch, I divided the remaining three dough balls in half (six pieces) and made to sure to roll them until they were about 1/2" thick and came out about 24" long, and the pretzels still came out pretty big.  I periodically put the pretzels I finished shaping onto the pan after the baking soda bath, and they rose a lot more since the pan was still warm from the first batch.  I baked them in 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, and they came out perfect!  The first batch (the big ones) may have been in there for a minute longer as I realized I had to go fetch potholders, but the first batch came out the best!  As soon as they come out of the oven, I soaked them in butter, but did not add any more salt.  Slightly (barely) crusty on the outside, nice and chewy on the inside.  These pretzels are slightly sweet, just the right amount of salty, and definitely taste best warm.  I personally like these pretzels better than the ones at the mall.

Thanks for a great pretzel recipe - I never knew the trick was in the baking soda. I dipped half of my batch in cinnamon sugar - so good! TIP: Don't be afraid to roll out your ropes really long and have very loose looking pretzels, mine looked "right" when I twisted them, but when rising in the oven, they ended up as pretzel blobs (but yummy blobs!)

My kids simply love these soft pretzels - theyre almost like Aunt Anne's pretzels!! Followed tips from past reviews and reduced flour amt to 4 cups. I only used 3 1/2 tsp instant yeast as i didnt want the yeasty taste tht some reviewers complained abt. Also halved the amt of baking soda cos didnt want strong metallic taste. I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on some pretzels just b4 baking n baked at 400F for 8 mins on a lined baking sheet. After removing them from the oven, i immediately brushed melted butter on every pretzel. I sprinkled the ones without cheese with cinnamon sugar. So everyone in the family was happy - the kids with the savoury cheesy ones n me - the sweet cinnamon ones! :)

These are amazing! Everyone I make them for always request that I make them again. The only change I made is to replace oil with butter and to baste the dough in butter before adding the salt and baking.

This recipe is circulating thru my family like wildfire right now and we are all having fun comparing notes:  First of all it IS a bit of a pain pulling the knots out of the water solution,  all you have to do is roll them out to hamburger bun size discs, rest, dip and bake (awesome sliced and Muenster or smoked swiss added like a sandwhich).  If yours don't taste like mall pretzels, you probably didnt dip them long enuff, I use the microwave and dip them while it's running (on High-20 seconds)  they should puff up a bit like a dumpling. Lastly, your flour must be fresh,  those of you who thought they were "bland"  were probably using "tired"  or stale flour.  Love this recipe!!!

My husband insisted, with his mouth full of pretzel, that I write a review for these!  They are yummy!  Do note that you will need 1/4 to 1/2 cup of melted butter to brush on the pretzels once they're cooked.  The butter is mentioned in the description of the recipe but isn't on the ingredient list.  Also, to get pretzels that look more like the ones you buy and less like fat little knots: 1. Roll the dough ropes as long as possible.  2. Let them rest a few minutes and then roll them even longer.  3.  Work as quickly as possible while shaping the pretzels and dipping them into the soda water.  They seem to retain their size once they're sitting on the baking sheet.

**Use Bread Flour!!!**I made these the first time with regular all-purpose flour and they were pretty good, but kinda fell apart when I dipped them, and were difficult to reshape.  My husband wanted me to make them again, but we didn't have enough flour on hand so he went up to the store and made the best mistake ever!  He came home with bread flour.  I used that instead, not knowing what to expect, and the pretzels went from being pretty good to absolutely amazing!!!  They held together great, and they looked and tasted better than the real thing!  I will only use bread flour from now on.  It makes the perfect pretzel!!

I made these for our Superbowl party and they were wonderful!  My boys love the pretzels from the mall and they liked these even better.  The only changes I made was reduced the flour to 4 cups and baked @ 400.  We just had them with cheese and they were to die for!  We ate so many pretzels that we couldn't eat anything else I had made for the party! YUMMMMMMM!

Excellent recipe!  If you have a bread machine.... use it!  I cut the recipe in half to fit my bread machine.  I placed all liquid ingredients first, then all dry ingredients.  Put the machine on the dough cycle and let it do all the work.  No need to proof the yeast.  Very simple.  Then I followed the rest of the directions on the recipe for forming the pretzels.  Next time, I would just dip the tops of the pretzels in the baking soda mixture... I think that the bottoms got a little too brown because I dunked the whole pretzel.

I like making pretzel buns with this recipe, and have also made a double batch to make a pretzel-bread bowl, which I then put cheesy Rotel dip in for a party dip with little pretzel bites on the side for dipping - always a hit!!  Thank you!

These were amazing!  I've never made pretzels before so I wasn't sure what to expect the first time around.  I followed another reviewer's recommendations on less flour and less baking soda in the water, and they didn't turn out pretzel like, more like a bread texture.  So the second time around I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful!  They had the crunchy, soft texture I was looking for.  I sprinkled some with sea salt, some with cinnamon and sugar, and some with ranch seasoning.  So good!

This turned out great the second time I made it. It was ok the first time, but a little dry. As always, before making a recipe I read the reviews. So if I have trouble with something I can hopefully fix it along the way.  Which holds true for this recipe.  It was too dry the first time and had to keep adding water.  The second time I made it I decreased the flour to 4 1/2 cups and it worked great.

I added 5 TB vital wheat gluten (usual instructions are 1 TB gluten for every 1 c flour) to add to the chewy, stretchy texture I wanted to achieve. They were just phenomenal! I'll be making a bigger batch for an Oktoberfest block party!

LOVE this recipe - we make the dough in the bread machine, then make pretzel sticks and drop into hot water/baking soda mixture on the stove for about 30 seconds. We sprinkle the sticks witrh kosher salt and bake them on a silicone mat for 8 minutes. SO DELICIOUS! We serve these with the beer cheese pretzel sauce found on this site.

WOW!  I was skeptical as I was rolling these out bc I didnt feel like the dough was as shape-able as I would have liked and I am not an experienced bread maker, but they turned out SO good!

I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough setting. I did decreased the flour to 4 C as other reviewers suggested and I did lower the baking temp to 400 - 8 mins was perfect.  Also let eacg pretzel soak in the b. soda/water soln for 10 seconds each.

YUM!!!

These pretzels are amazing.  I've already passed the recipe on to several friends.  The only thing I did different was half the baking soda and water solution because it seemed like a lot that didn't get used in the end.  We topped some with parmesan, salt, sugar, and even co-jack cheese.  Delicious and we'll be making again soon!

After reading 6 pages of reviews, I went with 4 cups of flour, 2 white, 2 whole wheat. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup,(  used brown sugar).I reduced salt to 3/4 teaspoon, and baking soda to 1/4 cup, water to 2 cups. Instead of making traditional pretzels, I shaped them into hamburger buns. I made the buns 3 1/2" in diameter, and 1/2" thick. To use them, slice bun in 1/2 and you have a fantastic hamburger, or sloppy joe bun! Next time I will try Hot dog buns! Wow! Excellent! Thank you!

My family and I love this recipe. I did read the other reviews and used only 4 cups of flour. When I first tried it, I made it four times in one week! Unfortunately, I ran out of all-purpose flour and ended up using 1/2 cup of whole wheat and 3 1/2 cups of all-purpose. The pretzels came out even better! I think they were easier to roll out. For best results, follow the editors advice and roll out all 12 pieces and then start at the first piece and roll them out again. Also 400 degrees, on a top rack in the oven and parchment paper is a must :-)

I'm sure if you have a mixer with a bread hook it's a fantastic recipe, but it is impossible to make without one. Kneading this dough by hand is impossible, the recipe should have a note about this. B/c I just wasted a lot of money on the ingredients for a recipe I cannot make b/c I don't have the proper appliance.

These are really good...a little too sweet for my tastes, but what I was looking for.  Will be making again, but tinkering with the sugar.  Thanks for the post.

These were easy to make and very good! My family had lots of fun trying to make these into pretzel shapes. I baked them on our baking stone using the tip to move the rack up a little higher to avoid burning.

As other reviewers stated there is too much flour for the abount of liquid. I suggest incorperating your flour slowly until the dough has "taken" all it can, I found that to be about 3 1/2 cups. So I also suggest mixing the oil and 1/2 cup uf sugar into the yeast mixture then adding flour. I hope this helps.

Followed the recipe on the my first attempt.  Pretzels seemed to stick to the pan, and the pretzels seemed smaller than what I expected.  The second time around, I used whole wheat white flour, and sprayed my pan with a non-stick spray.  Also, after dipping in the warm water/baking soda bath, I left on a cooling rack to let some of the moisture to drip off.  I managed to get a total of 16 pretzels, and received raves for the finished product.  My son, who loves Auntie Anne's pretzels, absolutely loved these.  I will save this recipe and use again for sure.

I made this recipe twice and it came out great both times. The first time I used way too much flour and boiled the pretzels (instead of just using warm water) and they still came out great! The second time, I rolled the dough into ropes, then cut them into 1-inch pieces to make pretzel bites. I cut the cooking time to 5 minutes, dipped them in butter, and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar or salt and froze some of them to heat back up later. My only issue was a slight baking soda flavor with the bites, but that might be because I didn't pat them dry before I baked them. Great recipe!

I made a double-batch of these, figuring I would have leftovers. They tasted amazing, just like the ones at the mall, the first day. The second day, not so much. Don't bother with leftovers, but totally worth making for that fresh-out-of-the-oven flavor the first day.

Oh boy, these are GREAT!   They are really tasty, much like the mall pretzels :)  Especially the ones that I brushed on the butter and sprinkled the sea salt.  I also made half of them with cinnamon-sugar topping.  They were yummy.  We'll definitely make these again.  Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was dry, tough, and pretty much impossible to make into ropes. The temperature was way too high so the bottoms of the pretzels were burnt while the rest was raw. I don't understand why people give this recipe such a high rating when they had to make major changes to make it turn out.

Best pretzel recipe ever... had great luck with this one. Turned out nice and fluffly. I ran out of white flour, so I replaced one cup with whole wheat flour. The taste was even better with that!

I love this recipe!!! This is the BEST pretzel recipe I have found to date! I just finished eating one of these amazing pretzels. I had a craving for soft pretzels and don't care much for the store boughten ones so I searched the web to find the perfect recipe. I have made several attempts at making pretzels with a plethora of other recipes but this one is by far the best. Now all I need is some of that amazing sweet mustard those pretzel places have...YUM!!!

AWESOME!!!  My entire family inlaws and all LOVE when I make these pretzels.  Instead of making the traditional pretzels I roll out the dough flat and stuff them with american cheese, scrambled eggs, and bacon or sausage for a GREAT breakfast (and sometimes dinner) treat!  THANKS for the great recipe!!!!

This is a very good recipe.  The taste is fabulous.  I baked these twice yesterday.  The first batch I baked at 450 and the bottoms were burnt even at 7 minutes.  I baked the second batch at 415.  They browned nicely on the bottom, however were not very brown on top.  I did use the 5 cups of flour as written.  However, I added around 1/4 cup more water.  The dough needs to be a little tacky.  It shouldn't be dry.  The second time I used 1/4 c sugar.  There was no hint of sweetness at all.  My husband preferred the version with less sugar.  My kids and I preferred the ones with the 1/2 c sugar.  Slightly less than 1/2 c may be the happy medium.  Next time I will try making garlic bread sticks with this recipe.  (Will only use 1/4 c sugar for that.)  I did not brush with butter.  Don't skip the baking soda process or the pretzels will not brown at all.  I used my stand mixer to knead the dough.
***UPDATE:  I've made these several times now.  1 3/4 c of water seems to work well.  I put 1 tsp of molasses in with the baking soda bath.  This gives them a browner color.

After reading the other reviews, I started out with only 4 cups of flour and then slowly added the other cup while I was kneading it.  I divided the dough into 12 pieces and then halved each piece after rolling them out.  I dipped them in the soda bath and then placed them the pan that I liberally sprayed with cooking spray.  I spread butter on each other the little pretzels and just sprinkled regular table salt.  When they came out I put more butter and ate about 7 right there at the counter!  The table salt added just enough saltiness and the bread was so soft and good.  The next day they were still good, but more the consistency of a bagel.  I'd say to eat them right away and they'd be great as dinner rolls with garlic butter.

Great recipe!  But don't forget to dip the pretzels in butter afterward.  That's what makes it buttery!

Go for it! You will love them! I saw a reviewer saying this recipe would be for intermediate or advance bakers... NOT true. Let me tell you, I am the worst baker in the history of fire! I can't even bake pre-made cookie dough without burning or undercooking; but I was able to make DELICIOUS pretzels with this recipe because it definitely is fool-proof! Hubby was a little worried this would be going straight to the trash can, especially after I asked him "what does 'knead' mean?" haha, but he really liked them. I soaked the pretzels and sprinkled just a little sea salt (only kind I had). After they baked I brushed melted butter and sprinkled a bit more salt. AWESOME! I had to leave the house when the dough was resting, so I accidentally let it rise for almost 3 hours. After researching the term "knead" I know I can make even better pretzels next time, hehe, but I encourage everyone to give this a try just like I, the worst baker ever, did :)

Fantastic pretzels!  I used half whole wheat flour.  I thought they were actually better after they sat and cooled down.

These pretzels are sooo yummy! Make sure you grease the pan - I didn't do that and the wetness from the baking soda bath made my first batch burn to a crisp on the bottom.

So easy. This recipe is my first for pretzels. Letting the dough rise on warm oven please so much. I made pretzel dogs.  I bought some apple chicken sausage and wrapped them in the dough. Dropped them in the baking soda mixture one at a time, for about 30 seconds, then baked! Great game day food! Everyone loved them!

Delicious. The only change I made was to use instant yeast (only 2 tsp instead of 4), and I only made half the baking soda mixture, and next time I'll only make a 1/4 of it...you don't need a lot. I tried NOT dipping one pretzel in the baking soda mixture, and there was a definite difference in texture and coloring...it's definitely worth it to dip it! Cinnamon sugar is our favorite coating with this one!

I used my breadmaker for the dough.  It mixed up nicely, but I did need to add more water.  I only needed to cook them for 6 minutes.  My husband said they tasted great and thats good enough for me.
I just made these again(2nd time in a week lol). They were a bit big the first time for my 3 small children.  So I made 24 smaller ones and cooked them for about 5 min. a pan.  I sprinkled sesame seeds on half of them instead of the salt.  Both are good, but I like the salt better.  I also used only a 1/4cup baking soda and 2 cups water.

These turned out better than I anticipated since my dough didn't rise a whole.  And they do taste buttery and I did not use any butter, even after they were out of the oven.  I might add cut up jalapeno and cheese to the batter next time, as they are great for savory pretzels, I just cut some of the sugar!  I also use much less salt to top.

Excellent flavor. I did like others recommended - 4c of flour instead of 5c; 1t of kosher salt instead of 1 1/2 regular salt; baking soda bath of 2c water and 2T soda; blotted the twisted, wet pretzel dough on a dry wash cloth before transferring to parchment paper; baked at 425 degrees for 8 min. I also discovered to roll the dough 10-12 inches for every ounce of dough. A 2-ounce, 24-inch piece of dough was manageable for me; although a mall-size pretzel I guessed to be about 3 ounces of dough rolled 30-36 inches long.

we made these tonight, they came out great. a little crispy on the outside and soft. maybe not as chewy as mall ones, but a much better flavor. i added a fair amount of water to the dough. it's fun reading the reviews to see how others adjusted. i think next time i'll start with less flour and add to desired constistency. in the end the dough was wonderful to knead and rose really well. the end result was so tasty and great texture. i could vary things to get different textures, maybe a little crispier on the outside. we had them with mustard.

These were kind of fun to make.  The dough was more elastic than I was expecting. Followed advice to reduce flour and oven temp.  They turned out great.  My son wanted some with cinnamon and sugar instead of salt - they were good too, but next time I will season those after cooking because the baking soda bath reacted with the spices and turned them green while cooking, the salted ones looked perfect.

I give 4 stars because I attribute it to me probably doing something wrong with the dough, but these weren't all that good.  I've always enjoyed making pretzel rolls for homemade sandwiches, but these didn't have the awesome taste of mall pretzels that I was hoping for.  They were rubbery tasting, so I really think I did something incorrect, like maybe the dough didn't rise enough.

Brushed with melted butter when I brought them out.  Will cook next time at 400 so don't brown as quick... but fantastic!!!!!!  Made some traditional pretzel shapes and some "balls" for my daughter for her lunches, they were great too!

Oh my! These are fab!  I halved these because it's just me and my hubby. Recipe halved perfectly.  I made exactly as listed (except using less flour, as about half cup of that wasn't needed) I made four pretzels and the rest of the dough I cut up into bite sized chunks which I cooked on a separate tray. Oh, the heaven of one of those little pretzel bites popped into my mouth straight out of the oven!  I think next time I'll add just a touch more sugar to try to mimic the sweetness of the mall pretzel a bit more....but overall, what a delicious recipe! I will for sure be making this again. Only next time, I won't be halving the recipe....I'll make the whole thing and bake up a ton more of those yummy pretzel bites!

This is an update to a review I gave a while ago and gave this recipe a 1 star rating.  Geesh, was I ever off on that.  I just made this recipe again today with the following changes:  4 cups flour, bake at 400 and brush with melted butter when done.  Yup, it's a five-star recipe all right.

Don't worry if the dough seems really stiff.  Mine was almost unworkable - but after it rose for an hour it was perfect.  These are FABULOUS.  And my two little girls loved helping me roll them into "snakes" - they were so proud when they came out of the oven and tasted how DELICIOUS they are.  You will not be dissapointed!  Thanks Christa!

A great recipe! These have a very slight sweetness to them. With the kosher salt topping, the sweetness is balanced out very nicely. The consistency was perfect, nice and chewy. I actually had the baking soda water simmering when I dipped them. I did have to add about a 1/4 cup more water when mixing... no big deal, could be my flour. My only other negative is that I would use cornmeal instead of greasing the pan. The added oil hot a little hot and over cooked some of the bottoms. Again, could be my oven.

These were probably the closest to mall pretzels as I've made so far but they're way too soft.  Needs to be a slight crunch to the outside and these didn't.  Overall, good.  My children loved them.

Like a previous reviewer, I'd like to give this 5 stars but am only giving it 4 as I changed it a little, after reading LOTS of comments and seeing the patterns!  I used 4 cups of flour instead of 5, only 1/4 cup of sugar, and used a LOT less baking soda and water (I kept the proportions the same, but just made enough for a small bowlful - 2 tablespoons of soda with a little more than one cup of water was more than enough). The dough was just perfect - you know how you can just feel whether it's right as you start to knead...  After a few practice runs making the standard sort of pretzel with kosher salt (my husband immediately gave the result a place in his Top 5), we experimented with adding sugar and cinnamon in place of the salt - we even tried adding some raisins to the dough and rolling it up into a 'snail' or cinnamon roll - yes, I know that it's no longer a pretzel if we do that, but the result was brilliant, and with far less fat and sugar than a standard pastry of that sort.   This has become an instant favourite - both the making and the eating - and I suspect it will be made regularly! Thanks for the original recipe and for all the detailed comments which helped me adapt it for such a great result.

Wow this is a great recipe! I'll never pay $3+ for those mall pretzels again. I'm not sure what I did wrong with shaping them because it came out looking more like a pretzel bun.

I made these this past weekend for an Oktoberfest party and they were pretty good and not too hard to make.  They definately taste better warm out of the over (I made them the day before the party, but snitched one when they were fresh!).  Also, if you're not planning to eat them right away, wait to put the salt on.  I put it on right away and it had all absorbed into the bread by the next day.  I just put a little more butter on them and added more salt and stuck them in the over for about 4 minutes.  Turned out great!

Excellent recipe! My children and I made 3 batches in 3 days! They had so much fun making them that they invited friends over to make them.
We consistently made one change, per previous reviewers suggestions we adjusted the amount of flour to 4 cups. It was the perfect amount. I would adjust the sugar amount depending on what you want to do with them. If you want a sweet pretzel, keep it as is, if you want it more savory cut the amount in half. I have added cinnamon and raisins to the dough and it was delicious. I imagine the possibilities are endless.
Incidentally, don't skip the baking soda step. It is what gives the exterior a nice chewy texture.

These were great! They really do smell and taste like pretzels from a certain mall store. I spritzed a little Smart Balance butter-y spray on them after they'd been in the oven for about 7 minutes, which gave them a little extra flavor. This is a recipe I'll definitely make again--I'm sure it won't be long before my husband asks for another batch.

Basically just pretzle-shaped bread.  Try "Mall Pretzles" from this site for the real deal.

This is my second time to make this. I love this so much but I reduced the flour to 4 cups. I did baking soda bath, then dipped into eggwhites, then spinkled with streusel (or you can replace with sugar cinnamon. I make mini pretzels by doing 1.5 feet rope instead of 3 feet ropes. It tastes awesome and look pretty. Thanks again for the recipe.

I've made this recipe three times now and these pretzels are delicious.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and the salt to 1 teaspoon and found that less yeast (2 1/4 tsp.) worked for me along with 1 tablespoon of gluten.  For those who are having trouble rolling out the pretzels, try dampening the surface you roll them out on with a wet paper towel.  Use the heels of your hands to roll them and move your hands outward as you roll to 22 to 24 inches.  I also let mine rise for about 30 minutes before baking them on parchment paper. They are wonderful brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.

Great recipe, tried for the 1st time - I followed everything (after the first batch) except I thought I'd experiment a little (It's the artist in me I guess!) and, instead of dipping them into the water/baking soda mixture, I used melted butter with some garlic herb seasoning - I did this before, 1/2 through cooking and after taking them out of the oven as they were resting. Both turned out well, I always like garlic and herbs - and I think using butter enchances the flavor (plain or with garlic). When brushing them halfway through, it helps them "brown." Thanks for the recipe!!

Very Good!  Was a bit of work but well worth it.  My 2yo loved them... Thank you!  I used sea salt because its what I had, next time I think Im going to try to get the more course salt and use less but other then that it was great.

These were super soft!!  I read TONS of reviews and was really worried about whether or not these would turn out but I was pleasantly surprised.  Only used 4 cups of flour and 3/4 tsp of salt in the dough and it was plenty.  Still had to add a tablespoon of water to it to make it workable.  Next time I'll try cinnamon and sugar on top and don't worry about the browning...it's just the baking soda/water mixture.

This was a really easy recipe I found using your hands works better to mix the dough, my mother always said if you use your hands to eat it, then use your hands to make it, you dont need a fancy mixer.  Also if you melt some butter and brush it on-top it adds to the flavor of the pretzel.  Cinnamon sugar is also good on this pretzel.  Also you dont need that much Soda mixture to was way to much.  All in all it was a really great recipe, and I plan on using it all the time.  Thanks.

Bland. Pretzels have a unique pretzel-flavor and these just don't got it. Also, I fail to see why you call them "buttery" when there's no butter in the recipe, just what you douse on top when you're done. The dough is hard to work with, not very flavorful, and the recipe is just to blah for good pretzels. There's a reason why you buy them in malls - they're BETTER.

I LOVE the mall pretzels which is why I tried this recipe.  It's not quite like "her's" but they're really good.  I don't put as much sugar or flour and after they've baked I've either put on melted butter or sprinkled sugar & cinnamon atop.  I think I read someone's review that these aren't too good the day after...I have to agree but who wants to leave some for the next day?? *LOL*  I've made these for friends, family, gifts etc. and made sure they got them the same day.  Very good recipe.

The pretzels are more fluffy or "lighter" if you mix with a fork or a wooden spoon. Use your hands as little as possible.

I made this and it was simple. I only ended up using about 3.5c. of KA bread flour. Instead of oil, I used melted butter, and I used 1/2 of brown sugar! These are quick, easy, tasty, and I will make these again for sure!

My boyfriend LOVES pretzels. Almost every time we go to the mall, we HAVE to get a pretzel. So I decided to look up a recipe and try to make them. I looked at the reviews before hand, so I used 4 cups of flour instead of 5 and used butter instead of oil. I threw all the ingredients into my bread machine on dough cycle and VOILA! We also baked them on a little lower of a temperature, around 410°F. They were delicious and easy. Since we couldn't eat them all at once, I froze half, which were perfect when micro waved for about 30 seconds.

I did not like this recipe, the proportions for the flour are all wrong. i could not get it to form a ball with out adding extra water and vegetable oil. Alot of it. Then it didn't rise. I will never make this again. It was a waste of 5 cups of flour.

My family loves this recipe and we make it a lot.  I start with three cups flour and then slowly add more in as needed.  I give the kids small amounts of dough to make there own pretzels.  We make all kinds of shapes and sizes.  The thinner you get your strips of dough the better.  Our favorite way to eat them is after they come out of the over we brush them all over with butter and then cover them with a cinnamon and sugar mixture.  I am not experinced with bread/yeast recipes and I have had no problems with this recipe.

I made these for our superbowl party and they were HIT! I believe that I got 10 pretzels. And I uesed Fleshmans's Yeast. They tasted exactly like Aunt Annies. My secret was after dipping in the baking soda,  brush on melt butter (land o lakes butter), and then sprinkle with salt. Then immediately after the oven brush on more melted butter. After I was done it was about a full stick of melted butter. This one is definately a KEEPER!!!

Great recipe! I agree with other reviews in adding the flour gradually. I tried the recipe a couple of times with the 5 cup directions and figured I was just doing something incorrectly as the dough was terrible. I adjusted to 4 cups and it worked beautifully!!

This was the first time I made homemade pretzels. I will NEVER buy a pretzel at the mall again. These are amazing! I followed directions to a T and it was very simple to roll and twist.

Great recipe! Easy to follow and they are delicious.I bake them only 7minutes. I also dip them in to melted butter after they come out of the oven. They are a hit everywhere I take them.

Fantastic. My boyfriend and I make these all the time and they always turn out wonderful. I usually start with 4 cups of flour then add as needed, with 5 cups I find that the pretzels are a little too dry and that you need to add water to them so starting with 4 cups skips a step :)

This was a super easy and party pleaser for the 2011 Oktoberfest celebration.  I would only say that for a more traditional crust to simmer the water with baking soda and let the pretzels in the water until they float and spoon them out.  But even if you dont do this step and just follow the recipe as is, you will be a party star.

Delicious, only the dough was too dry and hard to knead, even after adding 2 teaspoons of water...THEN I read the reviews! Definitely start with less flour, then you can add more if it's too wet.

I followed this as written with one change (olive oil instead of veg) and the pretzels were great!  Do not skip the baking soda water dip, it is what really makes the pretzel and adds the flavor.  I also made two pretzel dogs (like the mall places) just wrapped the rope around a slightly warmed hot dog.  They were good, just make sure the rope is thin or it overpowers the dog.  Thanks for sharing this Christa!!

Absolutely out of this world.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Instead of flouring your work surface, try buttering it.  It works much better.  We buttered ours after they came out of the oven and covered them with cinnamon and sugar.  To die for!

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using half butter half oil for the 1 Tbsp. of oil. I will be making these pretzels many many more times. My husband and I loved these as did our 18 month old. I put salt on several and left several plain. They were also great dipped in cinnamon sugar when still warm.

I followed the recipe as written, but the pretzels had a very strong soda taste.  They were soft and pretty, but nearly inedible.  If I make them again, I'll cut WAY down on the baking soda.

All I can say is Antie Ann's better be glad I am not setting up shop with this recipe.  These pretzels are amazing!!!! Oh and the dough freezes wonderfully. I froze the extra dough after it had risen. I did add a smidge of water and kneed in a little flour after I thawed it over night in the fridge, but other then that you couldn't even tell the dough had been frozen.

I made these tonight and they came out good! I followed the advice of the previous reviewers and only added a scant 4 cups of flour ( plus a little on the table to knead with) and still had to add a little extra water. I used brown sugar instead of white and a healthy squirt of corn syrup ( I read that it produces a chewier pretzel). I let it rise for almost 2 hours in a warm oven and I am not sure it doubled in volume but it did increase in size.   I didn't feel like rolling out and shaping so I just rolled smallish balls out of it( reduced the temperature and flipped them over when the bottoms were getting really brown)..For the baking soda bath I just kept it in a small pot on a very low flame and added about six pieces at a time, I removed them with a slotted spoon ( shaking off excess water) and baked on parchment paper ( I didn't have any problem with the pooling of water or an off taste as mentioned in another review).  Brushed these with an ample amount melted butter when they came out and they taste good and look beautiful. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. This is the first time I've used yeast and it turned out great! My kids loved these. I took the lazy route and cut the dough into little bite sized nuggets. I baked them without salt then brushed them with melted butter. I put half in a bowel with cinnamon and sugar and shook to coat. The other half I sprinkled with a little kosher salt. They are delicious!!! I will make these again but I am still looking for a pretzel recipe like the ones  at the state fair or amusement parks.

These are really yummy.  But buttery they are not.  There is no butter in them, therefore they yield no buttery flavor.  My family liked them, but if you are looking for a sweeter buttery flavored pretzel this is no the recipe to use.

How can you say AWESOME in every language.
These were so easy to make I thought I was doing something wrong.   I made some with salt and some plain, then added a glaze on top and added purple, yellow and green colored sugar for a different Mardi Gras treat.  When I went back to work the next day they were gone.  Next time I will try brushing with some butter after the baking soda dip to see how that goes.

Delicious. Made them into pretzel sticks because i have a 2yr old and this makes them easy to handle. covered them in butter and rolled in cinnamon and sugar. yum yum! i think they tase better if they are a little undercooked and not quite too brown.

Good and felt like they were healthier than the freezer or mall option by making them fresh and using half whole wheat flour.

This recipe is so awesome. The baking soda wash sounded kinda tricky, but the whole thing was so easy to follow and the pretzels were SO GOOD. They had that great authentic pretzel taste.

I made them on Valentine's day for my boyfriend (with a matching card, haha) and he loved them. I do agree with other reviewers on using just 4 cups of flour and I turned my oven down to 400 degrees. 8 minutes was the perfect baking time. I sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar -- so yummy! 

You can see how the pretzels turned out on my blog here:

We have been trying to find an at-home recipe for pretzels that taste like Auntie Anne's.  This is it!!  I would give these 10 stars for taste if I could!!  I made 2 batches for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved them!!  We did some regular, some with parmesan and garlic on them, and some dipped in butter and cinnamon sugar after cooking.  Delicious!!   This makes a lot and I only used the first batch at the party, so the other sat all afternoon and I made them this evening.  They were a little bit chewier than the 'fresh' batch, but still wonderful!
I did give 5 stars because they were so awesome, but 5 c of flour is too much!!  I only used 4 c and still had to add a little more liquid.  
We loved them and will be making them on a regular basis!! 
Thank you, Christa Rose!!!!

So easy to make!  Added 3.5 C flour like one suggested & added add'l .5 C while kneading.  More flour didn't seem necessary this time.  Baked 6 on 1st pan at 450 for 8mins.  Was real good but bottoms & edges got crunchy & very brown.  Reduced 2nd pan to 410 for 8mins, a bit doughy but not uncooked.  Wasn't bad but next time will need to try in-between.  SO GOOD!  All 3 girls loved them plain!  (Be careful, didn't need lots of salt to make delicious!)

This was the first time I tried baking pretzels and they turned out pretty good! Next time I will start with less flour like the other suggestions, but they had such a great taste there will definitely be a next time.

I had to use a lot more water than the recipe calls for to get a workable dough.  Ended up using about 1 3/4 cups instead of 1 1/4 cups.   After that adjustment the pretzels turned out very well.

DELISH!!! Make sure to really roll out thin, my first attempt ended up rising into a ball! Try substitute 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour for vital wheat gluten, this will give them a chewier texture. Still tasted amazing.

These pretzels are wonderful! I did what another reviewer suggested--substitute butter for the oil and use less flour. One further suggestion from me: there is no reason to make so much baking soda bath... I ended up throwing away most of it. I will only be making half of the bath in the future. Oh, and I put the dough in the oven at 150 for two hours during the rising process. That seemed to work quite well. Enjoy!

Let me start by saying that I consider myself a chef before a baker because I don't like to measure things.  That being said, I always follow t a recipe to the "T" the first time I make it, and this recipe is great.  I followed exactly as directed and my pretzels came out just fine.  I did have to add a little bit of water because the dough was a bit dry (thanks for the previous tips and next time I may cut 1 cup of the flour) but that is to be expected when making a dough product.  Great recipe Christa Rose!  Thanks for sharing and I can't wait to try playing around with all the varieties that can be done with this recipe.

I used my breadmaker to make the dough and these were the easiest soft pretzels ever!  I threw all of the ingredients in the breadmaker (I used only 4 cups of flour as others recommended & I used 2 tsp of breadmaker yeast).  I had to leave the house while the breadmaker was doing the work so I actually didn't get back until about 4 hours after the dough would have been finished.  I was worried that it would have more than tripled in size but I came home and the dough was perfect!  I formed the dough into about 24" ropes and then twisted them into pretzels.  Then I dipped them into the simmering baking soda & water, blotted them on a paper towel, placed them on a cookie sheet, brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with salt.  I baked at 400 degrees for 8 minutes and brushed them with melted butter again as they came out of the oven.  I took them to a neighbor's for a party and they were a huge hit!  I will definitely be making these again.

Love, Love, LOVE these pretzles. Crazy to me that they are called "buttery" and there is no butter. But they are awesome. I made some plain with salt and some with cinnamon sugar. They are also terrific the second day, just pop them in the toaster....a little crispy...just EXCELLENT!

Great recipe tasted identical to Aunt Annie's pretzels! My one and only issue was that I could not stretch my dough out long enough to make a large pretzel. I had to double the amount of dough when shaping the pretzels so I only ended up with six large yummy pretzels as appose to the twelve the recipe says it makes. I also only used 4c of flour and as suggested by another review and I let my dough rise in the oven (the oven was off) only with the oven light on and covered by a damp towel. All and all these pretzels are fabulous!

These were very simple to make, however, it was too dry with the amount of water stated in the recipe. I did have to add 5 more tablespoons of water to make it pliable to work with.  One batch I added poppy seeds to the flour before added the liquid. Those were good. The next ones I'd like to try with dried minced onions. The only problem I had was the bake time/heat seemed to be off (which may be my oven but I don't have problems with my regular recipes)  They got brown very fast but where the dough layers are thick from twisting remained quite doughy in places. I reduced the temp 25 degrees and increased the bake time 5 minutes and that seemed to correct the issue.  Family loved these and I will be making them over and over. I've had requests for these for poker night and bowling league snacks lol.

These are really great.  I made a full batch and froze half the dough.  Once I let it thaw for a few hours it was just as good as the originals.

450 degrees, even 425 is definitely too hot.  400 degrees probably would have been best to prevent darkening.  When you put the pretzels in the acid solution, wait to remove then until they rise.  For the yeast I used one packet (.25 oz) of the active dry yeast and it seemed to work.  Line  your cooking pan with heavy duty foil and spray with Pam for easy clean up. I also brushed the tops with Salted butter after removing from oven.  I used to make the kind with Lye, and these are very similar to my old recipe.

These are very good, and do taste buttery, even though there is no butter in them.  They do stick to the pan though so make sure you coat it good, letting them cool will help them come off a little better.  Thumbs up.

oh my goodness these were good. i usually stay away from pastries and desserts because i seem to always mess the recipe up, but this one was idiot proof and they turned out fantastic!!! didn't change a thing. : ) update: I made these again tonight since the first time a year or so ago and I wanted to make smaller ones, so I divided the dough in to 24 pieces and decreased the cooking time to about 5 minutes. Just as yummy as the larger ones!!! I love this recipe!!!

Since other reviewers said to use brown sugar I did, but I think they would have been better with white. They look just like mall pretzels, and when I first tasted it, it tasted just like the mall pretzels, but the aftertaste was funny. Next time I'll use white sugar and I think they'll be fantastic.

We are snowed in here in PA so I thought this would be a good time to try this. I proofed the yeast with the sugar and water and added to my bread machine. I then added the other dry ingredients. Used the 'bagel' cycle. Removed the dough when complete and followed the remaining directions. If are you aren't good with kneeding (i'm not) use the bread machine to make the dough. Very easy. My kids loved them! AWESOME!

These pretzels were really fun and easy to make.  My kids loved them and ate them as a snack.  I made them according to the directions and they came out really well.  However, they were a little sweet for me, so I'll definitely cut down the sugar the next time I make them.  The directions state roll each piece of dough into a rope.  I found it was difficult to roll the dough on a lightly floured surface.  I needed the dough to be just a "tad" tacky to roll properly.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars!  It was just sweet enough, just salty enough and just buttery enough--the perfect pretzel really.  Like others, I reduced the flour to 4 cups.  I started out with 3 1/2 cups in the sugar/flour/salt mix and then added another half cup as I was kneading the dough, which helped to keep it from sticking.  I used salted butter instead of oil and reduced the salt slightly.  I put the dough in a stainless steel bowl sprayed with cooking spray and then sprayed the top of the dough and placed it in the oven with the light on for an hour, covered with a damp cloth to prevent a dry shell on it.  I also reduced the oven temp to 400, and in 8 minutes the pretzels came out perfect inside and out!  I used unsalted butter to spread on them.  I made 12 of them, and my boyfriend and I gobbled up 9 of them in short order!  This is a very simple and delicious recipe...my favorite kind!  No more mall pretzels for me! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent pretzels!  I used a little less flour than called for and still had to add several tablespoons of water.  Still, it's important to be aware that the humidity where you live can affect the dough, and it's drier today than usual here.  I used my new Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook for this (I've made pretzels/bread by hand and in the bread machine, but never in a mixer) and it was a perfect dough after about 5 minutes of mixing.  These are extremely easy and they turn out very well.  I don't think you need as much water or baking soda for the baking soda bath though--a shallow bowl of water with a tbsp or so of baking soda should be enough.  I usually dip pretzels one by one anyway, which is what I did today.  I didn't bother with butter after baking--after dipping in the baking soda bath, I sprinkled half of the pretzels with kosher salt and with the other half I dipped in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.  Nice taste without all the butter, which I don't think you need anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING!!  They definitely take awhile to make (it took me about 2 1/4 hours, start to finish) but are not difficult at all.  I cooked them at 415 for 8 minutes and they were perfectly done.  They're fun to play with too; salt and butter, cinnamon and sugar, and whatever else you like!  I will definitely be making these again.  They'd be great for something like a Super Bowl party!

I made these today after seeing the recipe on the front page a few days ago.  I was so hopeful, but they just didn't turn out for me.  I had the same problems as many other low-star reviewers.  They are very bread-like, not pretzel-like at all.  They have a very small hint of pretzel taste, but otherwise it just tastes like white bread.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did lower the oven temperature to 425 and baked them for 9 or so minutes.  They did cook properly at these temperatures, and weren't doughy in the center as others reported.  The bottoms did not burn, but were much darker than the top and stuck to the baking sheet.  I also had a lot of problems with the dough as others reported.  It absolutely was completely dry and flaky.  I had to add at least 5 tablespoons of water just to make the dough managable (which it still wasn't, but at least it stuck together).  Even then, it was very tough and hard to knead and work with.  My arms and hands were aching!  I let it sit and rise for an hour in the oven with a warm towel covering it, and it made it easier to work with once I was ready to form the pretzels.  They weren't that difficult to roll out; probably the easiest part of the process.  All in all, these didn't turn out.  I didn't bother making all of the pretzels once I tasted the first few that I baked.  Totally disappointed.

I was worried when I first saw the dough but after the rise it was so soft! What lovely dough it made..The taste is awesome.. I didn't know how hot the water should be so I made them like I would a bagel. I dipped them in very hot water and left them in the water for about 20 seconds.( no problem there) The smell in the oven as they baked was exactly like a mall pretzel. The taste was delicious BUT the bottom of the pretzel tasted like soda.I'm gving it 5 stars because I believe it was my fault. Next time I will half the dough and experiment with a shorter dip and with the other half use less soda.Thanks for the recipe!It's a keeper

yummy! 2 observations, 1st make sure you grease or spray your cookie sheet, these buggers stick. 2nd, if using the "recipe calculator" for different volume, be aware you do not need 6C H2O+baking soda...lots left over, the original amount would do fine

These were great and easy to make, a fun food to make with the kids. I made them into sticks instead of pretzel shape and served them with a warm cheese sauce at a recent party... they flew off the table everyone was talking about how great they were. Can’t wait to make them again.

I made this recipe for the first time today. Exactly like it is written and it was delicious. Only thing I did different was brushing with butter immediately after taking them out of the oven. Then I made half sweet with cinnamon and sugar. Then the other half savory with garlic butter. They were a hit with my family I will be making them again and again.

I usually don't rate recipes unless I have made them a few times, but I made this for the first time today and they are fantastic! I halved the recipe and I am sad that I did, I could probably eat the rest of these tonight by myself lol.  I used sea salt on half and sugar and cinnamon on the other half.  They are both great.  I also brushed them with melted butter when they came out of the oven and that added even more flavor.  I will be making this again and again! Thank you for this recipe

These pretzels are amazing. I have made them 3 or 4 times now doubling the recipe the last 2 times. Like other reviewers I made the following changes: I used 4 cups of flour instead of 5 (every time I have to add a couple tablespoons of water to the dough during the kneading process). I also use a little less than the ½ cup sugar, just a personal preference.  I use my mixer for the kneading process with bread hooks and it works fine. I let rise in a cool oven with a damp cloth over the bowl and the oven light on (works for all types of breads). After dipping in the baking soda solution I dab the dough on a paper towel to get the excess water off and place them on wax paper that I spray with cooking spray. I have never had a problem with them sticking. I do not brush with butter or salt at this point. I bake at 400 degrees for 8 minutes or so. The best thing I’ve found out is to under cook the ones we’re not going to eat just a little. I then put those into plastic bags in the freezer. Then I can randomly take some out to thaw, throw them in the toaster oven or regular over for a few minutes dip in butter and top with whatever we feel like that day. This way you can make a bunch and they don’t go bad!  Thanks for the recipe!

These pretzels were great!  I actually made 'pretzel bites' out of them--like the ones you get served in a cup at the mall.  After I rolled them out, I cut them about an ench long with a pastry cutter.  I dipped them in the soda solution, added kosher salt to some of them, and then baked them for about 6 minutes.  When they came out I dipped them in melted butter.  For the ones without salt, I threw them into a ziploc bag full of cinnamon/sugar and fully coated them with sweetness.  These probably took longer to make than big pretzels, but we haven't stopped poppin' them into our mouths ever since!

These pretzels are amazing, and they do taste remarkably like the ones you buy at the mall- only better!  They are very simple to make, and truly do smell buttery as they are baking, even though they have no butter in or on them until they come OUT of the oven!  I sprinkled them with coarse sea salt before putting them in the oven and brushed the tops with butter as soon as they were done. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and only used 4 C of flour, which was perfect.  My son was so excited to have one of these after school that he told me "You're the best Mom in the world!" (He's 6 :) This is a new regular in our house!

This is an awesome recipe!!! I made the recipe, exactly as written, in my Kitchen Aid mixer. I did change the baking temperature and time to 400 degrees and baked the pretzels for 10 minutes. They came out golden brown and delicious. I basted them with melted butter and then sprinkled on the salt. I would reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup next time as I think they were a bit too sweet. The hubby went crazy for them! Thanks for sharing a really awesome recipe!!!

Not only was this recipe a cinch to make, but the pretzels are so good!  I wish I had made more of them.  Since this was my first time making pretzels, I cut the recipe in half and only made six.  I followed the directions almost exactly, however, I cooked them at 425 degrees and they cooked in about 4-5 minutes.  I suggest standing there and watching them until they look brown enough.  Anyway, the pretzels were a little large and I could only fit four on a baking sheet.  I dipped the remaining two into the water/baking soda mixture and left them on a different baking sheet until the first batch was done.  I mention this because I worried that they would be ruined by sitting out after being dipped in water.  No need to worry!  They turned out great!  After they came out of the oven, I brushed them with butter and then sprinkled with regular table salt.  Perfect!  This is a really good recipe to do with your kids...my young daughter had a blast!  Thank you for a great recipe!
*UPDATE* I made these for the second time this past weekend and made an interesting discovery.  I thought some of my pretzels from my first batch were too crunchy and so this time around I made my dough ropes thicker.  The pretzels tasted great, but they were much softer and more like rolls than pretzels.  I think the thinner ropes are better because they make a crunchy outside and a chewy inside - just as they should be.

Our family used to go to Life Action Family Camp in Michigan every summer. My kids loved Pretzel Night where all the families would gather to take hunks of dough and shape, dunk, bake and eat until we were stuffed. I've tried many times to replicate the recipe at home but never could do it. In a winter slump, the kids were begging for summer and pretzels. I can't make it summer time, but I can cook! I decided to give the pretzel thing another go with this recipe. It was a BIG hit! I used 2 1/2 c. fresh ground spelt flour and 2 1/2 c. all purpose flour. I put all the dry ingredients including the yeast into the Bosch mixer. I turned it on and drizzled in the oil and then added the HOT water until the dough was sticky. I let the Bosch do it's magic on speed 1 until the dough was a shiny soft ball (about 9 minutes). I turned the machine off and let it sit with the lid on for an hour. It rose beautifully! I could tell at that point that this recipe was a keeper because the dough was so elastic and silky. We shaped them and dunked them in the water/soda mixture. (Thank you mose for the explanation. In the past I skipped this step because I couldn't figure out why it was necessary!) I cooked them at about 425 degrees for 6 to 7 minutes. You really want to keep an eye on them because they'll burn fast. These turned out to be the best pretzels we ever made. The kids requested we make some more tonight. Weather Forcast: Snow!

WOW!! I didn't think I could make these but I DID!! I will be making them again tomorrow for a gift basket. I did mix whole wheat flour with the regular flour other than that I did just as recipe said. FANTASTIC!!! 6 with salt and 6 with cinnamon/sugar. I used the idea of the honey butter on the cinnamon ones..YUMMY!!!

This was my first attempt at making pretzels for my super bowl party.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3 ½ cups of flour.  I don’t know where in the world 5 cups of flour are coming from but do yourself a favor and start with 3 ¼.  You can always add flour but can not take it away.  Other than that these were really tasty and easy to make and I had fun making them.  I will definitely make these again.  Now all I need to find is a mustard dipping sauce to make them perfect.

These are absolutely wonderful!  I am amazed that this recipe has anything other than five stars.  As another reviewer mentioned, when adding flour to yeast recipes I never measure.  There are always so many factors to take into account that the flour amount always varies.  I just go by how the dough looks and feels.  This will definately be made again and again in this house!!!

My family loves these pretzels.  I made mine in the bread machine.  The first time the dough came out really dry.  The next time I increased the water by 1/2 cup and the dough was perfect!  My kids request that I make them every weekend.

Don't know why all the fuss on the ratings!?    This was a simple recipe and the pretzels were delicious! I measured sifted flour and didn't have any problems with not enough water or too much flour.  This recipe is a winner!

Great recipe!! I tried this one out of the 3 or so others and I was not disappointed! My tweaks for the recipe: used 4 cups flour; only used 2 cups water and 1/4 cup baking soda for the "bath" and I put it in a saucepan to keep it warmed/to dissolve the baking soda; used 1 tbsp butter instead of oil; used 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2. I also did the egg wash step before they went into the oven. I have a gas oven and had to reduce cooking time to 4.5-5 miniutes so they were nice and soft. No complaints & husband loves them! Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe was fantastic!  We ate these up as soon as they came out of the oven.  I followed others advice and gave the pretzels a few minutes to rise after their dip in the baking soda wash.  I also brushed them with egg wash before I baked them and buttered them as soon as they came out of the oven.  They were so soft and tasty.  We did not find them too sweet, the amount of sugar the recipe calls for was perfect.  We will be doing these often.  I echo others' sentiment that it's a great project to do with the kids.  They had a blast playing with the dough.

This is an awesome recipe.  It's just like the ones at the mall, and my fiance is crazy about them.  After trying it once with the normal recipe, I then made a batch substituting the same amount of applesause for the oil, and using a non-stick spray on the baking sheet, thus making the pretzels fat-free:  I also have a fat-free butter spray, but they also taste great without any butter.  A very fun and tasty recipe!

These soft pretzels have an incredible soft, chewiness, and wonderful taste. I have not been able to duplicate this texture with any other recipe.  As far as the amount of flour in the recipe, I just added small amounts of warm water until the dough was soft and pliable--worked great.`

My children and I made these on a Saturday night instead of watching a movie.  I decreased the flour to 4 1/2 cups and added a few more tablespoons of water.  The dough was easy to work with and the finished product was delicious!  Plus, we had a lot of fun.  We will make these again and again.

These pretzels are amazing!  They are so delicious and addictive.  The only problem I had was that they always stick to the pan, but I found that using parchment paper helps quite a bit.  Also, if they get a bit dried out, just put them in a sealed plastic bag overnight, and they will be chewy again in the morning.

My Foods class was on a mission to find a great soft pretzel recipe.  They loved this one.  We decreased the flour to 4 cups to begin with and then added a little more if needed to accomidate the humidity during the kneading process.

I tried a recipe for bread pretzels the first time. And that's what they tasted like... bread!  This was my second pretzel recipe and we loved them.  We didn't think they tasted like the mall pretzels, but very sweet and tasty.  Tried them w/ cinnamon/sugar.  Very good!

I tried this recipe and it was very good.  I used my bread machine on the dough setting to make the dough.  I also rolled each strip out w/ a pastry roller and put in a small stip of cream cheese than selled each stick up by rolling it till the seam was well sealed.  I than brushed them w/ egg yolk and put sea salt on them before baing.  They turned out really nice.  Will make this again.  :)

Wonderful!  I used my bread machine set on dough and it worked great.  They browned very quickly towards the end so watch them.  Tip: Roll the ropes between two hands like starting a fire with a stick.

These turned out absolutely delicious!! I found that rolling each piece out to 12" and then allowing them to 'rest' for about 5 minutes made it much easier to roll out longer after they've rested.  Otherwise, I didn't do a single thing different than the recipe called to do. :) They were more 'pretzelly' (is that a word?) and not like breadsticks like some other recipes I've tried.  Will be making these again :)

YUMMY!!I have nothing but rave reviews for this one! I not only made them for my picky husband, but brought some into work, and have not stopped getting requests from either place! I made them with my 4 year old neice too and she had a lot of fun! I dipped some of them in a cinnamon sugar mix and that was really good too! I think we even like them better than the mall pretzels! Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe!  Instead of making pretzels though, I made pretzel bites.  After rolling them into ropes, I then cut them into bite size pieces and proceeded with the recipe, baking only for 5 min.  Served with some cheese sauce they were just like the ones in the mall!

This was a big hit with the family. I will be doing these alot. Had a buttery falvor. Only used 4c of flour and 1/4c of suger. And half of the reciepe for the baking soda wash. I bushed it on instead of dipping. For me it was much easyer.

These didn't taste like mall pretzels. Next time, I think that adding substituting butter for the oil will yield a better flavor. Another issue I ran into was that the outside of the pretzels were bitter due to the baking soda bath. I think I may use lye next time if I had it.

Having never made pretzels before, I have nothing to compare these to, but my whole family loved them and they weren't that hard to make. =)

Update: I made these into sandwich rounds today. Followed the recipe to make the dough, then formed them into rounds and baked them at 450 for about 20 minutes. Excellent!

Made these today with a wonderful outcome.  Based on other reviews, I started with just 4 cups of flour and dusted a little more as needed and the dough baked up just perfectly, soft and chewy.  Once they were done (about 7 minutes at 415 degrees), I brushed them with melted butter and dipped them in a bowl of cinnamon and sugar to coat.  I made 6 pretzels like this and used the rest of the dough to make 8 pretzel dogs which were simply brushed with butter.  Oh, I kinda wish this didn't turn out so good because now I'm really going to have to exercise a LOT of self control not to over-indulge!

I didn't follow these directions exactly. The dough was mixed and kneaded in a bread machine (90 minutes). Then I rolled out the pretzels and let them rise for an hour. After that I boiled the water and baking soda for a 1 minute bath. The boiling bath gave them a tougher outer shell (like a bagel). In the end they came out great. We even had enough dough for 16. So we made a braided strand and a roll for practice.

We loved these pretzels!! So soft and yummy! I only rated a 4 because I had to adjust the recipe a bit. I only used about 3.5 cups of flour(and a little when kneading) like other reviews mentioned and had to adjust the temp to down to 410* and I couldn't figure out the "buttery" part of the recipe. After reading reviews I noticed many people brushed them with butter or sprayed them with butter.

Had I not had to make adjustments, I would have given a 5 because these are so good. Better and less expensive than the mall ones!

After reading reviews and looking at the pics I decided to try it.Everyone loved them my family is VERY picky and partial to the ones at malls ect and they devoured them as soon as they came out of the oven I used one pack of yeast and had to add about 1/4 cup extra water also I tried flouring the surface for the individual pretzels before rolling and it wouldn't roll out right so I tried without and it worked great!! Also if u reuse your baking sheet make sure u scrape it off good before second round or u will have a black baking soda bottom and will make them taste very gross. All and all it's an awesome recipe and I will definitely be using it again!!

These are amazing. VERY EASY TO MAKE! In fact I just had surgery 4 days ago on my hand, so I was able to make these one handed!! (I had some issues when it came to rolling them out lol) I followed the recipe exactly as its stated. It doesn't say how long to make the rope, but my suggestion is more than 8-10" which is how long I made mine. I would suggest a very thin rope about 20" long. Don't be afraid, it raises in the oven. That's my next suggestion, SPACE THEM OUT! To get a good even color on them make sure you make them in batches. 

Overall, amazing turn out!!

I have made these a couple of times now and I must say these are by far the best tasting pretzels I've ever had.  I always have to decrease my flour by 2/3 of a cup though. I'm thinking maybe it's the elevation I'm at. 
Today - I came up with adding 1/4 c. jalapeno powder, 1 large diced jalapeno's and 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese to the dough.  These are estimates because I cook by sight lol. All I can say is WOW!  They were amazing :)

Yes, these pretzels came out absolutely astonishing. And the most wonderful thing is that I didn't had any hard time with them at all. I followed Wayne Gisslen's advise from his "Professional baking" that active dry yeast must be rehydrated in 4 times its weight of warm water. So I dissolved 4 tsps (0,5 oz/15 g) of yeast and 1 tsp of sugar in 2 oz (60 ml) of water. And later I just added separately the yeast mix and remaining water (8 oz/235 ml) in the flour mix. 4 cups of flour were more than enough. I kneaded it with a dough hook on the 2nd speed for 10 min. I let it rise for 1 hour, punched down and let it relax on the bench 20 more minutes.  After I had made up pretzels and soaked them in soda bath, I sprinkled half of them with poppy seeds and salt, and another half with sesames and salt. Baked every batch only for 8 min. Then covered them with melted butter. Pretzels are the best just after the baking, though they are very good the next day even without any air-tight package. 
I have tried to bake pretzels on parchment paper, silicone mat and just on the oiled cookie sheet. And I can say: never ever bake them on oiled cookie sheets (!!!) They will stick anyway and you'll eat pretzels without their bottoms.
The next time I'll try to half the amount of sugar in the dough.

New family fave, I suggest you read other reviews before you make this. I used 4 cups of flour as other reviews suggested and I'm glad I did, let rise in the oven with light on, no heat, and damp towel over the bowl. Really fun to make with your kids.

I tried this recipe as my first attempt at making pretzels. Right off the bat, the first thing I thought was "That's an awful lot of flour". I also noted that it required nearly double the amount of yeast for any other pretzel recipe. Those should have been my red flags, but I stuck with the recipe. The dough turned out terribly dry! Adding "2 tablespoons of water" did nothing to fix this. I added spoon after spoon. Nothing. It rose, but was dry and unable to be formed in to pretzels at all.

These were soooo good!  I followed the recipe as is but then simmered the pretzels for about 10 seconds each in the baking soda/water mixture.  I turned the oven on 400 degrees and I am glad I did because they were dark at that temperature.  I can't even imagine them any higher. I brushed butter on them after they came out of the oven and left some like that, some with mustard, and some with cinnamon sugar.  They were all so good! They didn't need any salt because of all the salt in the recipe, baking soda is salty and I used salted butter. I will definitely make these again and again!

These pretzels are AWESOME. Nice and soft. I only used 1/4 c sugar, but next time I think I'll just use the full amount. They weren't too sweet at all. The dough can freeze, too. After the first rise, snip off some and wrap well in plastic. Take it out of the freezer and let defrost in the fridge, then proceed with the rolling and baking. Excellent, thanks again!

My family love this recipe; we used to get soft pretzel at the old Price Club (now Costco) but they stopped making these a long time ago; we have been looking for a recipe that's good and had failed many times.  My daughters told me: we FOUND IT. I added an additional 1/4 cup of warm water and reduce the flour by one cup.  Delicious and freeze well too.  Thank you, thank you for sharing.

I've made these five times now with my grandchildren (ages 4,5,6).  It is an easy recipe, fun to make into shapes, and delicious to eat.  We made some with salt and most plain and brushed with butter when they came out of the oven.  My only constructive comment deals with the baking soda wash.  We used MUCH less than the 1/2 cup of baking soda recipe calls for and you don't need 4 cups water!   I dissolved 2 TEASPOONS in about 1 cup water (in the microwave) and then put the solution in a flat dish.  I dipped the pretzels in the solution (rather than letting the children) and it worked out fine.  You do not need to waste all that baking soda.   You need the solution to make them brown, so they look like pretzels, but you do not need a lot.  We tried brushing the solution on the pretzels (and the children could do that) but the color looked best by dipping.   A WONDERFUL KITCHEN PROJECT.... will do again, many times, I'm sure.

Made these with my kids today (perfect snow day project!).
Followed the recipe pretty close, I did what others said and added flower to the liquid instead of vice versa.  Ended up using barely 5 cups of flour.
Lots of fun making them!  Only baked at 400 degrees for 7 mins, my electric oven is quirky.
the first batch had a burned bottom so thats why I changed the temps and time.
Overall, awesome recipe!
I would have given 5 stars but for the flour issue...

This is a great pretzel recipe!  The baking soda solution is a MUST.  If you do not use it, the pretzels would just be salty pretzel-shaped bread. I changed a few things, for the baking soda solution, I only use 1/4 cup of baking soda and two cups of water. Also, I keep the solution in a small pan on the stove and have it barely simmer. For the pretzel itself, I brush it with butter before putting it in the oven, and brush it AGAIN with butter after it comes out, then sprinkle it with kosher salt. But if you use pretzel salt, it is better to put it on the pretzels before you put them in the oven, just because that helps the salt stick better. FYI- just to let you guys know.... I'M TWELVE. Shocker huh?

This recipe made good tasting pretzels, but there are some modifications that need to be made.

First off, don't bother proofing the yeast. Just mix the yeast into the flour and other dry ingredients and add the water. Second, 2 packets of yeast equals 4 1/2 tsp. If you are using packets, don't measure, just add two packets. Third, 5 cups of flour is WAY too much for 1 1/4 cups of liquid. Mix 3 cups of flour with the other dry ingredients, add the water and mix. Then slowly add enough flour to make a stiff dough. You will not need 5 cups of flour.

I give this recipe a 10! Followed the recipe, until the soda and water at the end, I just used the standard egg and salt. Mixed up the dough in my breadmaker machine, did have to add a tad more water.  Discovered I need a lot more practice at rolling ropes and twisting pretzels. I ended up with 9 really fat pretzels! Tasted AMAZING!

Yup, these hit the spot alright! I've never made pretzels before but find good store bought ones are not always easy to find, they are often too salty for me. I like the fact that these are very slightly sweet. I brushed butter on mine when cooked and dipped them in cinnamon sugar. My first 8 pretzels looked more like knot buns when they came out because I hadn't rolled the dough long and thin enough, but by the last 4, I had got the hang of it. Will be making these again!

It's true.  Much better than store-bought.  Much softer and not so "mall" tasting.  The recipe worked perfectly for me. I didn't change a thing.  I like that they have some sweetness to them.  
I would just warn others that they do bake pretty quickly.  Stay close to the oven.  
Instead of dipping them in butter, I brushed them lightly with melted butter.  I also sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mixture.  It was much better than the mall ones that are suffocating in the sugar.  I also, per my son's begging, made a quick powdered sugar, vanilla, milk icing for a little drizzle on top.

I made these pretzels and they were gone the next day. I had to add more water( the two tablespoons, plus about two more)and then more floor to maintain the dough texture.I let the dough rise by filling a bowl of hot water, and placing the dough on the bowl in the microwave. I decided to alternate the flavors and made half plain, and the other half sugared. For the sugared, I used a homemade caramel recipe( got from a caramel popcorn recipe) and stuffed two with trail mix. I let them cook at the given temperature, then basted them, and put them in the oven at 350 degrees for extra browning. A day later, I reheated some in the oven( basted them with butter, and caramel again) and made a nacho cheese mixture( milk,two slice American cheese, one slice pepper-jack) and got rave reviews from my guests. This is a great recipe and I will definitely be making more. This was a easy recipe to follow and was great for snacking.

Wow, these are good!  I made exactly as stated, I used a jelly roll pan with melted butter in the bottom, and after the baking soda/hot water bath I put them on the pan top side down to get some butter, then flipped them back onto their backs, sprinkled the salt and baked.  Wow!!  I burned my tongue eating one right out of the oven, but it was so worth it!!  Excellent recipe!

By the way, April 26 (today!) is National Pretzel Day, so it was imperative that we had these today! :-)

excellent!  Made two batches.  Sub'd applesauce for oil and cooking spray for butter both batches.  They are still outstanding without adding artery-clogging fat to them via butter and oil.  

Second batch, made the following add'l modific for health reasons:  whole wheat flour only, subtract 3 T sugar from 1/2 c called for.  Very good again, both plain and with honey drizzled on top.  

Read many reviews before making.  Used 4c flour instead of 5c.  400F oven for 8 min instead of 450F.  Be sure to roll them out to 20-24 inches.  That seems long, but is necessary since they proof-out after shaping and before baking.  (For first-timers:  yes, baking soda bath is necessary for true pretzel taste.)

My daughter loved it! She's a big fan of pretzels and this is the right texture that she's looking for. I did have to let the dough rise a little longer but I'm fine with it. My bottoms burnt a little so I will double pan it next time and see what happens or probably I wasn't paying attention.

This is just the 2nd time that I worked with yeast, the 1st experiment (donuts) was a flop and I was a bit hesitant to try this.  I'm glad I did!  The pretzels looked, smelled and tasted WONDERFUL! :)

I halved this recipe and made them last night.  I followed the directions for the proportions and they were exactly right.  I let the dough rise with a damp hand towel over it instead of plastic wrap so that it stayed moist.  When my first rise was finished, I was busy doing other things, so I punched it down and let it rise again before using it.  I made half of these cinnamon sugar and half of them salt.  I used COURSE ground KOSHER salt, which is what pretzels should probably have (think the stuff in the Super Pretzel box).  The salt ones are WAY better than the others, so next time I will stick with those.  I did brush hot butter on them before coating them in the salt, but they are so delicious that way!!!

This was the second time making these. They taste just like auntie annes's pretzels! They are fantastic. I would go with either 4 cups of flour not 5, or add a bit more water. Great with nacho cheese sauce!

I found this recipe last weekend & finally made them today. I halved the recipe as I made bread yesterday & didn't need all of that bread in the house. My husband & I devoured 4 of them in less then 10 minutes. I did need to add extra water to the dough. I also wish I had read more reviews before making. I would have taken the tip to not use flour to roll the ropes & to wet my hands to roll them. I couldn't get the dough ropes long enough, so we had super fat small pretzels. I baked at 415, but had to increase baking time to 11 minutes. That's probably just my oven though. I made them all with salt. My husband said these would be great with cinnamon sugar. He has more of a sweet tooth then me. I will definitly make a full batch the next time I make these.

Perfect! I used only 4 cups flour, and used half bread flour, half all purpose. I used only 1 TB sugar since I hate savory things to be too sweet, and used butter instead of oil. Otherwise I did everything the same. I dipped them in butter after I took them out of the oven, and then dipped half in cinnamon sugar and half I sprinkled with sea salt. To DIE for! Seriously. To up the ante even more I made a cheese sauce with a cup of milk, 2 TB flour, a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and a bit of powdered cheddar cheese I ordered from nutsonline. In another dish I melted 4  ounces of dark chocolate with a TB of butter and 1/4 c sugar to make a chocolate sauce for the sweet pretzels. This was a meal in and of itself, and it was the best meal ever! My skeptical husband who doesn't even like pretzels had to apologize for doubting that these would be good! Yay!

sea salt is the absolute best thing to top them with (but be sure to use kosher salt in the dough),
 
 
 Excellent recipe! I've found it is best to add 3.5 cups of flour and slowly mix in the final half cup as I'm kneading the dough
The baking soda water bath is key. Also I had such a hard time using flour to roll the pretzels and found a how-to video from Auntie Anne's pretzel company online and it suggested not using flour while rolling the pretzels and it worked! I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 4 cups of flour. And use a clean towel or a few sheets of papertowel for blotting excess water after dipping pretzels--also on the how-to video. And so I made these soooo many different ways, too! Salt, Cinnamon and sugar, cinnamon raisin, apple cinnamon

Have made this several times.  Everyone requests it!  Worked beautifully each time except one time when I think I added WAY too much salt somehow.  Yuck!

Just made the dough in my bread machine and then divided into 12 pieces.  Sprinkled 6 with cinnamon and sugar and 6 with sea salt.  They are very good.  Now, when my daughter and her friends go to watch basketball games, I can give them fresh soft pretzels instead of spending $2.00 on a frozen soft pretzel that is nuked.  Thanks for the recipe.  Gonna make Chocolate ones for Valentines Day.

I'd never made pretzels before in my life, so I didn't know what to expect from this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was...aside from having a heck of a time getting them rolled out long enough to make them look like pretzels! I have now bookmarked AND saved this recipe to my recipe box. They are SO delicious! I had read the reviews before making them, so I used a bit less flour than it calls for, and rather than using vegetable oil or melted butter, I used garlic olive oil. I also dipped the pretzels in melted butter after baking them, and then sprinkled the kosher salt on them. We are eating them as we speak, and they are amazing. No more going to the mall and spending $5 on a single pretzel! :D

These are the best! They taste identical to the ones you buy in the mall. I only used 4 cups of flour (and I still had to add extra water because the dough was so dry) and I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. They didn't even last more than a few hours at my house before they were all gone.

These are so wonderful, but I have found after many batches is to let them rise twice, they turn out even better.  I roll them out & let sit for an additional hour then shape & dip.  Also, 1/2 cup of baking soda is such a waste when half is more then plenty.

These pretzels are excellent and as good as any soft pretzel chain that I ever been to.  I followed the recipe to the T but I had to add a little more water to the recipe.  I live in a high altitude area and the cooking time was 11 minutes instead of 8 minutes.  After I dip my pretzel in butter I sprinkle sesame seeds on top.  YUMMY!!!!

i used whole wheat, with olive oil. i needed three times the oil to get the consistency i wanted. tip for when rolling: divide equally into however many pretzels you want, if the balls are too sticky sprinkle very little flour on them. if they are not rolling correctly add a little oil to your hands when rolling them out. its easier on a clean counter. (without flour) lastly the baking soda bath is a must, it browned my whole wheat flour beautifully!!!!

Overall a great recipe! I used whole wheat flour, added a little gluten, and I had to add a lot of extra water. It ended up to be a little too sweet so I will be using less sugar next time! But anyways, this was SO DELICIOUS! Thanks!

These are great!  Made them with my two boys today and we all agreed that this is the best pretzel recipe we have tried (we have been experimenting!).  I did make the dough in my bread machine - although, you will need to watch it, as the dough is very thick.  Not sure all bread machines could handle it.

THE BEST!  I have tried other recipes on this site that "claim" to taste like a particular restaurant or chain - but these truly do taste just as good - even BETTER.  I am a baker (I even make wedding cakes) - so I'm picky.  These are phenomenal. I dipped the tops in melted butter then pressed in a bowl of cinnamon sugar.  I think I may like these even better than my homemade cinnamon rolls.  Delicious.  Do not skip the baking soda water dip - crucial to the authentic pretzel taste.

I have baked my entire life and this seemed like the easiest of recipes for a pretzel. There was no boiling beforehand - so this was a short cut, so to speak.
 
I should have known better.  They came out biscuit like on the inside and you have to watch the temperature to keep the bottoms from burning but still allow the tops to brown.
 
I always read the reviews and didn't see anything I should've done differently.  They aren't eve close to a mall pretzel. 
 
And if you are wondering why so many of the 174 pics are of fat, clumpy pretzels?  It takes a long time to roll them to get them thin and long enough to make it appear like "Auntie Em's" pretzels.
 
We did it, but still - biscuit like interior and crunchy exterior. Gross.

These are very good and definitely taste like the ones from the mall.  I used one cup of sourdough starter for one cup of the water, adding the rest of the warm water and the yeast and sugar to foam up as directed.  It did!  Meantime I measured out 2 cups of bread flour and 1 cup of whole wheat in a bowl, thinking that I would then add 2 cups of ap flour after I added the yeast mixture.  Well that didn't happen.  That 3 cups of flour was already too much and I had to add about 1 T of water to get it to come together.  I really cannot make any bread products with all white flour but I've never had such a deficit in the amount called for and the amount I used.  I ran out of time at that point and had to put the dough in the refrigerator until the next morning when I took it out and put it in a cold oven with the light on.  It sat there for about 4 hours which was a little too long.  The dough was hard to shape and stretch; it was very elastic.  The end results did not look like pretzels even though I tried.  I rubbed a stick of butter over the tops as soon as they came out of the oven and sprinkled with kosher salt.  They are very tasty and did have a slight sourdough taste (but that will only happen if you use sourdough starter as I did).  I will be making these again, hopefully all in one day to see if the dough acts any better.  Note:  these did not last 24 hours in my house.  DD asked that I make them again when I have sourdough starter to use, which will be every 5 days!

I would give these 3 1/2 stars, not 3.  These were easy to make.  kind of skimpy on the size, so I remade and made 6 instead of 12.  The ONLY difference I did was used actual pretzel salt instead of kosher.  These are good pretzels, however they're not the best.  I'm still looking for a recipe that I adore, and unfortunately these aren't it.  now I WILL make these again, and probably use the dough recipe to make cinnamon rolls (minus the dipping in the brine).  

All in all, I'd recommend them (if asked for a pretzel recipe), but not highly.

This was my very 1st time making pretzels!  I used this recipe and the "Soft Giant Pretzels" recipe also on this site to compare.  This was the winner!  It had the right color and the best overall flavor by far!!  With that said, I'm giving it 3 stars because I did have some issues.  Next time I will use 4 cups of flour for a more moist dough which will be easier to roll out.  I will bake on a higher rack to not have burnt bottoms.  I will likely bake at 400 degrees instead of 450. I will really make sure all the pretzels have a nice rich brown color b/f I take them out of the oven.  And, I will eat less of the finished product so I don't feel so sick!

I don't make things with yeast unless they can be mixed in the bread machine on the dough cycle, and this one worked perfect. They're fun for the whole family, and we love experimenting with toppings.

Great recipe!  The bottoms of my burnt a little bit, but it's because I'm using an electric oven, I would probably turn the heat back to about 400-425 to save the dough a bit.  I did mix it up a bit and instead of salt, used cinnamon & sugar on a few and garlic salt on others, plus a few plain and kosher salted as well.  They were a HUGE hit!

I'm a beginner when it comes to baking bread. I tried baking cinnamon rolls and it didn't work, so naturally I was apprehensive when it comes to this one. Surprisingly it worked. My dough was awful sticky at first, but after adding flour during kneading and while rolling, it worked. My first batch was puffy and soft as we forgot to spread butter on it. But the 2nd and 3rd batch was excellent. We tried the pretzels with cajun seasoning, cinnamon sugar, even with a bit of garlic powder, it all tasted awesome. I would definitely use this recipe again.

Delish! Followed recipe exactly, only added an egg wash at the end (right before popping into the oven). Delish. Side note: since my yeast comes in the packets, I used 1 packet of yeast instead of the 4 tsp as suggested. Did not want to. Waste the yeast as I plan on making pizza tomorrow!

OMG, I wish I could give these 10 stars. These are by far the best pretzels ever. They came out soft and chewy and were delicious with either a side of warm cream cheese, nacho cheese sauce, and or just as is with sea salt (didn't have kosher on hand) or cinnamon/sugar (we've tried them all). We didn't change a thing and each and every time they reminded us how much money we had wasted going to the mall and buying them. So thank you Christa Rose for providing with a full-proof recipe this is one recipe that will be passed down to my kids (actually my 6 year old made the first batch which is noted in the picture).

A HUGE HIT! FANTASTIC! THE BEST PRETZELS! I followed the recipe exactly and each time these come out beautifully! I've made them often and will continue to do so! These are so tasty when they're fresh out of the oven with a little melted butter and some honey!

These were great.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to bake at 430 degrees for 9 minutes.
Also, I found rolling out the dough on a floured surface didn't work too well for me.  It was easier to take the divided piece of dough, kind of lightly coat my hands in oil, then roll out the dough by hand or by rolling directly on the counter top with no flour.  The flour seemed to make it less elastic.
Regardless, they tasted fantastic - exactly what I was craving.  They were gone in seconds - I'll be making some up to freeze soon.

These pretzels are very tasty. If I'd let them cook for the full 8 minutes, though, they'd have been badly burned. That resulted in some parts (where the dough was overlapped for the nice pretzel shape) coming out a bit underdone, but still edible. Next time I'll have to adjust the temperature.

I made these today, and there are only a couple left. My kids loved them :) I followed the original recipe, except I only put 4 cups of flour in my bread machine. I cooked them for 8 minutes exactly and they were perfect. My son loves them with cinnamon and sugar, my daughter and I, just butter. I want to try these with parmesean and garlic for italian dishes. Great recipe.

YUM YUM YUM!!!!! If taste wasn't amazing enough, check out how much you'll save by making these from home - I calculated for the 12 pretzels, we spent just over $2.00 TOTAL. Love that!

I made these by the recipe and they turned out good.  Very similar to the mall style pretzels.  I think next time I make them I will cut back on the floor a little as some reviewers stated, I'm hoping that will make them a little more moist when working with the dough.

I was looking for the ultimate soft pretzel recipe, but after making this I realized that the recipe I'm looking for requires a sourdough.  If you like Auntie Anne's pretzels, then you'll really like these.  If you are looking for something more traditional, I suggest you search out a sourdough soft pretzel recipe.

My daughter and I made these together. They were really awesome. Honestly, they do taste different than the ones they sell at the mall. But, that's ok! They are just as good, and probably not as much fat since they're not sitting in a vat of butter. 
My daughter begs me to make them all the time. We've done it twice.  We make three flavors all with butter:  garlic/salt, plain salt and cinnamon/sugar. All of them are fantastic. Thanks!

My husband loved them, and couldn't stop raving about them! We made a double batch, to make them last longer. Instead of adding salt before baking, we baked some of them plain, and added cinnamon and sugar to them when they came out of the oven.

Well these are delicious. I was a little worried because my dough wasn't rising very much, but after almost 2 hours I just proceeded anyway, and it really didn't matter! I baked plain, and brushed with butter and sprinkled with course salt after baking. AWESOME! Next time it's a double batch for sure.

Yum!!  We all agreed that these are better than Auntie Anne's.  The pretzels are slightly sweet, and so tasty.  I used a little over 4 cups of flour and had to add about a tablespoon of water to get a good consistency.  Rise time was about an hour in the warming drawer.  Recipe says to turn out onto lightly floured surface and roll into ropes.  This didn't work for me.  The flour prevented the dough from rolling and all it would do was slide on the counter.  I brushed the flour off and moistened my hands a little as needed and then they rolled out pretty easily.  I can't wait to try these again with other flavors, like cinnamon sugar or glazed!!

DELICIOUS! Always a hit! I've made this recipe a few times now and the only thing I'd add is coating them with egg before salting instead of using the baking soda. The baking soda does weird things to the texture of the dough & the egg not only tastes good but looks lovely.

I just made these for Superbowl and they are pretty darn tasty.  The reason I didn't give five stars is because there was way too much flour and it made the dough really stiff and hard to roll out.  I should have read the reviews regarding the amount of flour, but didn't get time until the dough was already rising.  I did however follow the reviewers' suggestions to lower the oven temperature, and I'm glad I did.  So, I followed the recipe exactly, except that I halved it (I only had one packet of yeast on hand) and lowered the cook temp and baked for an extra two min.

These have got to be the best pretzels ever.  I have never made pretzels before, and I usually have a difficult time with anything that contains yeast, but these turned out fantastic.  I made them exactly as written except I brushed them with butter after they were done cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used the Exact listed ingredients and ended up with a dry crumbly dough that was impossible to work into ropes.  I tossed it and used a different recipe from this site.

This is such a great recipe!!!  I did the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  I did the yeast, sugar and water right in the bread machine pan and let it set per the recipe till it was creamy/foamy.  Then I added the oil. Then the flour and sugar. And last of all the salt (keeping the salt and yeast furthest away from each other).  The dough cycle ran, I rolled them out, dunked them in the soda/water and baked them.  So easy.  And so yummy!!  I need to perfect my rolling skills and get them to stretch out a bit more, but even thick and chunky they were good!

These are suprisngly awesome. I was about to throw out the dough because it just didn't look good and was super hard to roll out but I'm so glad I didn't. I rolled one and did a test in the oven before I rolled the rest and WOW! Super yummy. Next time I'll cut back on the flour like the others mentioned. The temp depends on how big your making the prezeles. Mine didn't take that long to bake.

These are so good! I did brush them with butter after they came out of the oven, and the bottoms did get vary dark, even with the rack at the top, so next time I will turn down the heat a little. But these tasted amazing; I would even say better than Auntie Anne's at the mall! I will be making these again for my family and friends soon.

WAY too much flour in the recipe as it is presented here.  I ended up adding a lot more than one or two tablespoons of water.  Still, fairly tastey in the end.

Awesome.  So easy to whip up (although rolling them out is a workout).  I did exactly as recipe is written, brushing them with melted butter when they came out of the oven.  They were gone within a half hour of baking.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Great recipes.  Start off with half the flour and add until you get a good dough.  Like most people have said, the recipe calls for too much flour and if you add it all at once, then you get a bad mix.  I sprayed my pan with Butter Crisco spray, then sprayed the top of the preztels as well, then topped with Kosher salt.  They had a nice butter flavor without being drenched in grease.

I had a hard time working with this dough.  There was so much flour that I really couldn't get it smooth despite adding 2 T of water.  In the end they tasted good but they weren't very attractive.

I was looking for a recipe that resembled Philadelphia soft pretzels and this one was a close match! I used parchment paper to cook with and the baking soda solution kind of pooled at the bottom of the pretzels and gave them a funky taste. Next time I will dry the bottoms off a bit. I also let it rise for about 2 hours.

I made these with my son, who loves the store bought soft pretzels. We were going to make them for company, but he didn't want to share! They are a little sweeter than I expected, so we tried them with some maple sugar for a topping and it made a great quick breakfast. Making these again as gifts for Christmas. The baking soda bath is key!

I just made this recipe for the 1st time after having it in my recipe box for months... fantastic! Why on earth did I wait so long to try this?   I ended up using about 4.5 cups of flour without any additional water. I also brushed them with melted butter after they came out of the oven.  Also, don't forget to completely wet the pretzels in the baking soda solution because they don't get that nice brown color in the oven without it.

These are wonderful, just like the ones at the mall. I followed some of the other reviwers advice and used 4 c of flour instead of five and an extra Tablespoon of water when you are kneading makes it easier. A 400 deg oven was better than the 450 the recipe gave and they turned out perfect. My family ate them all before I had time to make the cheese sauce to dip them in.

YUM!!!! And I made it JUST like the recipe with the exception of baking them at 425! My husband LOVED them. When they came out of the oven, I brush on melted butter. Made a honey mustard dipping sauce too. SO GREAT! Never made pretzels before. I was SURPRISED at how easy they are! Gonna make this again and again!

Pretty good, needed some adjustments.  After one of my pretzels started to "melt" in the baking soda solution, I cut the baking soda to 1/3 of a cup, and combined it with 6 c. water on the stove. Once it came to a boil, I dropped in each pretzel individually until the outside started to solidify, and then scooped it out using a spatula.   When they came out of the oven, they were certainly tasty but the underside was still a bit goopy and uncooked, though the tops were done. If I did it again, I'd drop the temperature to 375-390 and stick them in there for 15-20 min, so they were more evenly cooked.

These taste fantastic!  They don't look great though.  I did have to let the dough sit for 2 hours to rise both times I made them.    I did do the baking soda wash as instructed and let them sit for 10min.  I also tried to wash with butter and with egg after the soda wash, all in separate batches.  But they never looked as good as the photo posted. :(  But they still tasted fantastic!!!

Loved the pretzels! After reading other reviews I did cut back on the flour to 4 cups and still had to add 1 TBSP. of water. My family loved them, especially with cinnamon & sugar. I will certainly make them again!!

I made the recipe almost exactly as is, but I feel there should be some changes made. Next time I will use less flour as I had to add a few Tbs. of water because my dough was so dry. I feel this affected how well my dough rose, making my pretzels a little dense. I did turn the temp on the oven down to about 415 degrees after reading other reviews. I think this is still a little hot. The underside of my pretzels were a little dark for my taste. I will definitely lower to around 400 degrees next time.  Even though they were slightly dense they were still very tasty!

Delicious!  These were a big hit at our football party.  I also reduced the flour to 4 cups after reading the other reviews.  This was my first time making soft pretzels, and I was very pleased with the results.  I will definitely make them again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy pretzels! I had to use about 6 T more water than called for, since I used a bread maker. Also, I think they would be better with a bit less sugar. Maybe 1/3 C instead of 1/2. Over all they are really, really tasty though. I made a few with cinnamon sugar instead of salt, per my husband's suggestion. Will definitely use this recipe again!

These are definitely yummy and easy to make! As previous reviewers have suggested, you should gradually add in your flour and knead the dough. I usually use about 4 cups of flour instead of 5 like the recipe calls for.

I have tried many recipes for pretzels but all come out dry and tasting like white bread (like the ones you get at Target and other stores).  I was completely surprised to find out that these actually do taste like the mall pretzels.  These were soft, chewy an actually tasted like mall pretzels.  Kudos on an awesome recipe.

These pretzels are great.  I made two small changes and that was to switch from white sugar to brown sugar and to spray the pretzels with butter spray Pam just before popping them into the oven.  YUM!  I will definitely keep this and will be making it again.  I also got 18 pretzels out of it instead of 12.  They all turned out big (about the size of an auntie anne's) and I was happy that I got more out of it than what was called for.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these for my friends just the other day.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it made 10 pretzels.  They came out of the oven golden brown and made the house smell delicious.  I spread a little butter on each one, then added the sea salt, which made the salt stick a little better.  They tasted great, just like what you can buy at any soft pretzel place.

Heaven!! These turned out absolutely perfect. I usually change things, but the ONLY thing I did different was use coarse sea salt in lieu of kosher. Easy, yet awesome!! :)

I have died and gone to pretzel heaven! These are absolutely incredible!  I was a little concerned because my dough was a little dry and I'm a amateur cook, but I was so pleasantly surprised with the results!

easy! this was very easy to follow and they came out awesomely delicious! I only used 4 cups flour. I was shy 1/2 c of a/p flour so I used 1/2 c of cake flour and didn't make a difference. They do have a slight sweetness to them thats great tasting. This is a great recipe. thx!

I have made these pretzels twice. They are very good!! I followed the recipe exactly as it is written, the only change i made was to turn my oven down to 400. I didnt shape mine into pretzels either, i rolled out the dough, not too thin, and made pretzel sticks for dipping. They are delicious!

Well these tasted amazing!  Did some with salt and some cinnamon and sugar- BUT I followed the recipe as is ( should have read reviews first)  This had way too much flour making the dough very hard to work with.  I will make again, but next time using less flour

Note: After dipping in the baking soda solution, try blotting the bottom of each pretzel with an absorbent towel to reduce sticking.  This recipe was perfect; the pretzels hit the spot, and the directions were easy to follow.  I just had to add two more tablespoons water.

These were absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!  I was shocked at how they tasted nearly identical to the pretzel places like Aunt Annie's.  I decreased temp to 415 and baked about 8 1/2 minutes.  They were SO GOOD!!!!!!

hmmm.... any help would be great. The dough fell apart in the water. I solved this by boiling the water and leaving them put for about a minute. Some tasted really strong of baking soda. A few tastes really good but like bread only--no pretzel like crust or chewiness. Considering all the great reviews I probably did something terribly wrong.  Besides boiling the water on some of them the only other change was using 4 cups of flour, not five.

I love these, these are really really good.  Takes a while to make but worth the effort.  The dough was a little too dry so I added a little water like the recipe says. I didnt use any flour to roll the dough because it made it even harder to roll.  Warning! These are very addicting.

Brilliant!!  Made the recipe as is and wouldn't make any changes for future bakings (which will be tomorrow I'm sure as the first go was devoured in minutes).  Tastes just like the mall shops.  In the UK we can't get anything like this and this recipe totally reminds me of growing up in America, nothing better than a hot salty pretzel!!  Thanks.

Excellent recipe!  I read the other reviews and made adjustments as follows: - used 4 cups flour instead of 5 - used butter in place of oil - rolled (by hand & with roller) thin and long - reduced oven temp to 400  - cooked for 7 minutes instead of 8  - brushed/dumped some butter on them right out of the oven  The result was amazing and I was upset that I hadn't made more.  Myself and two friends had these finished in no time.  We had a small one left over that somehow sat out all night long on the counter...it was no longer a "soft" pretzel by the next day but still ridiculously good!  In addition to making the obvious pretzel shape I also made pretzel sticks & pretzel braids/twists...very fun & delicious!

These were delicious. The only problem I had was that some of them were a little doughy in the middle. I think it's because I didn't roll the ropes out thin enough. I think each rope probably needs to be about 2 ft long to be skiny enough to prevent this. I will definately be making these again

I wasn't sure how these were really going to compare to mall pretzels, especially when I began kneading.  Dough was so tough and I had even reduced flour to 4 cups as suggested.  All the kids at the lakehouse over the 4th of July weekend asked me to make these twice... AND the adults!  SO GOOD!  I brushed with melted butter and made a cheese sauce.  This is a keeper!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I used to buy Aunty Ann's pretzels quite often. But I hadn't had any for years since I moved to NZ. I don't know why there's no pretzel shop here. But now I can make them myself! I'm also planing to bake heaps for all of my family and friends. I'm sure the pretzels will be a big hit since it's rare to find. BTW, the flour was indeed too much. I'll definitely reduce it next time. And, for someone who complained about too much baking soda. I did half the water and baking soda and mine still turned out perfectly fine.

This was an easy, fun, and tasty pretzel recipe. The only problem I had was the dough being a little gummy, but that was my fault for not letting it rise enough.  I brushed them with melted butter and made half with cinnamon sugar and half with salt, before baking, and brushed with butter again when I took them out of the oven. Not the healthiest, but surely the tastiest.

This was my first time working with yeast and it couldn't have been easier! One envelope of yeast worked fine for 12 servings. These pretzels tasted great with a melted butter, garlic powder and dried parsley flake mixture on top! Will be making again very soon :-)

These taste great, however, the outside cooked a lot faster than the inside. The first ones were dark brown on the outside & doughy in the middle. I ended up turning the oven down to 400 for the second batch. These rise like crazy! I used half whole-wheat flour and they were delicious. A great sweet-salty mix.

These were pretty good but the dough is far too dry.  My recipe calls for 2.5 cups of bread flour and 7/8 to 1 cup of warm water (it makes 8 pretzels, not 12).  My recipe doesn't use ANY fats or oils in the dough and I brush on unsalted butter, not dip them.  I only use 3 TBS butter and the unsalted butter doesn't add excess salt if you're using Kosher salt to the tops.  Also, my recipe doesn't have nearly this much sugar.  These aren't sweet rolls, they are pretzels!!!  I use bread flour for mine and the pretzels are more authentic in my opinion.  I also let my dough rise on the counter in a plastic zip lock bag for 30 minutes.  Just flour your dough and zip it almost all the way.  That's all the rise they need.  Any more and they expand too much.  Roll your ropes out very thin and long.. and only let them rise until just doubled before dipping in the water/soda mix.  Make sure your water and soda are mixed really well, otherwise you'll end up with splotchy looking pretzels.

These were truly excellent, with a few tweaks.  In place of the active dry yeast, I used 3 tsp of instant yeast, mixed with the dry ingredients.  I used 2 cups all-purpose & 2 cups whole-wheat flour (4 cups total), and I substituted vegetable oil for light olive oil.  Unfortunately I found that the other reviewers were incorrect about adjusting the oven temp - I tried 10 minutes on 415 degrees but my pretzels were not done in the middle.  Next time I'll try what the recipe recommended - 8 minutes at 450 degrees - and hope for the best!

I found the recipe to have a hint of sweentness to it but I expected it because of Christa's description.  I too agree with other reviews that 5 cups of flour is too much to add to the dough while mixing.  I believe I used about 4 cups and then kneaded the other cup into it.  I also had to add 3 Tbls water to the mix.  I took the suggestion from others and coated all in butter spray after removing from oven and then used koesher salt on half and cinnamon and sugar on the other half hoping for a breakfast treat.  Kids thought I used too much salt and thought it was weird I told them to dip it in mustard.  One liked it and one didn't (personal preference I guess). Overall would use this recipe again.  I did heat the water and baking soda in a pan like another reveiwer suggested to keep the water warm because you have so many to dip.  One thing I will keep in mind when making again is to make the strips very thin because ours baked together and didn't really keep the pretzel shape with the normal circle openings.  The taste I would give a 5 only giving a 4 because I followed the recipe exactly and 5 cups flour was too much to add to the mix.  Overall - good pretzel recipe.  Husband said tastes like a pretzel, which was a compliment!  I think the kids will like the breakfast version better with the cinnamon and sugar.  I loved them!

These taste really yummy. The first time I made these, I did a variety of toppings to try to find the best tasting ones: salted, unsalted, butter, no butter, etc. Best combination: Salted, no butter. I find they taste buttery all on their own, without adding any extra butter. They do go brown fast, but its not like they are burning; it's just the baking soda mixture causing them to brown a little bit faster. The ones that manage to make it throught the night end up going soggy and the salt disintegrates, but warming  them in the microwave makes it all better. The method is a little bit strange. When making yeast breads, you should only add some of the flour and make a kind of paste (With this recipe, only add 2 cups to start)  and mix the "paste" thoroughly for a few minutes, to start forming gluten. Then gradually add the remaining flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn out and knead until smooth and no longer sticky, adding flour as needed. I use this recipe to make 8 giant pretzels, baking 4 at a time and shaping the remaining dough while the first 4 are in the oven.

I just made these, except i used beer instead of water, and instant yeast instead of active dry. They're delicious, but next time i will do the following tweaks:  use stout instead of lager. Was looking for a more pronounced flavor and the lager just didn't satisfy. i ended up using a whole bottle of lager for 5 cups of flour. (if you use beer, heat it up in your microwave before using it)  keep the pretzel in the hot soda solution for around 25 seconds instead of just 10 to 15 seconds so the crust will gelatinize a bit more.  remember to spray parchment with oil. The pretzels stuck to the parchment paper, but not my silpat.  use 4 cups of flour to start instead of all 5.. or use more beer. haha!  I also topped mine with salt and garlic powder, then brushed with garlic butter right out of the oven. Yummy, and very filling!

Soft and delicious as promised!The best thing about this recipe is that it is so easy to make and versatile in the toppings that you can use.I made some with salt,some with zaatar (middleeastern herb mix) and some with summaq ( another middleastern spice).This will go great with anything.Thank you for sharing.

They puff up quite a bit as they're baking, so make sure you fold them a bit larger than a regular pretzel shape so they have room to expand.  Very tasty, though!

It took a couple tries (user error) but these pretzels are absolutely amazing and identical to mall pretzels. Well worth all the effort!  FLOUR: I put in 2 1/2C of flour to start, then gradually put in another cup or so while kneading.  I used a total of 3 3/4C flour.  KNEADING: I kneaded this for about 8 minutes in my KitchenAid Artisan mixer.  WATER: My water was 110F degrees when proofing the yeast.  BAKING: The pretzels were perfect at 9 minutes on a baking stone.

I made 8 large pretzels and used them to make sandwiches.  I baked them at 400degrees for 10 minutes and they were a bit overdone on the bottom and a bit underdone in the centre. I cut them open and toasted them before assembling the sandwiches... awesome flavour and texture.

Unlike others I haven't had a single problem with the recipe.  I follow it exactly and have great results.  I do lower my oven temp to 425 as my oven tends to run high.  Also, I found that my airbake cookie sheet cooks them perfectly where my non-stick sheet browns them a little more than I would like.    Also, don't forget about making sticks instead of full pretzels.  I think the full size pretzels are too much for my younger kids to snack on.

These were delicious.  I halved the recipe and kneaded the dough for 8 minutes after it had risen. I made 8 smaller pretzels which were just the right size.

Very good! This was my first "bread making" experience - I was scared b/c I  have never kneaded dough before, but I looked it up on YouTube and was sure to keep my water between 110-115 degrees for the yeast. Don't be scared if you've never done it before, you can do it!!!  Just be aware. Let my bread proof almost 2 hrs (left the house for a while) and had to use 1 cup of wholewheat flour (ran out of AP flour). I also followed the suggestion and used butter instead of oil. The texture of these were amazing, but be sure to roll out your strips of dough quite thin...i didn't and mine were quite Fat little things instead of the traditional size!!! Also,...USE LESS FLOUR! Do not use 5 cups...Add 4, then "eyeball" the rest. Don't forget your CAN add water if the mixture is too dry (I did and still emptied out excess flour).  Still tasted GREAT! Loved them. A+++ *idea* anybody thought about coating them in garlic and butter?

Unbelievable!  Where I live, there are no mall pretzel places.  About twice a year, I travel to where there IS one, and it's ALWAYS the first thing I have when I get there.  These, in my opinion, are SO MUCH BETTER!!  Light and fluffy on the inside, thin crispy shell...so good.  I used 4.5 cups of flour and still had to add a bit of water.  The dough was dense, but easily managable.  I rolled it out on the unfloured countertop easily.  I made 6 regular pretzel shaped ones and the rest were made into pretzel bites that I divided into parmesan and garlic (dipped in butter after the baking soda bath and then in parmesan cheese and garlic powder) and the rest brushed with butter and sprinkled with coarse salt.  I made a nacho cheese sauce, and it was utterly divine with the salted ones.  This will be made regularly in my house, for sure.

I halved the amount of sugar and only used about 4 cups of flour. I also added an egg wash before baking, and these came out so good! They were just as good, if not better, than the Amish made soft pretzels my husband and I got down in Lancaster, PA a few weeks ago.  We will definitely be making these again!

These pretzels are outstanding!  I rub a little melted butter on them when they come out of the oven and soooo good.  Just like the mall pretzels at a fraction of the cost.  There is no way we would be able to use 12 pretzles, so I form the dough into pretzel shape and freeze 1/2 the batch.  When we want them, I let them come to room temp, dip in the baking soda bath and bake.  They are as good as fresh made. My nephew asks me to make these all the time.

Since this is the first time making this or any other pretzel recipe, i gave it a 4.  It was very good.  Use 1/2 less water in the baking soda mxture to give it that taste.

Thank you, thank you for this recipe.  Made them today, they were exactly what I was looking for.  The ONLY change was I only used 4 cups of flour.  Made 1/2 with butter and salt and the other 1/2 dipped in butter and cinnamon and sugar.

Used cinnamon sugar and grandsons loved them.  I baked 1/2 of dough at the recommended temp but pretzels did not brown.  I stored remaining dough in refrigerator.   The next day I baked them at 375 for 10 minutes and they browned nicely.  I let them rise before baking.  I might use just 8 minutes the next time because the pretzels were a little dry.  I will definitely try these again.

I cannot over emphasize how great these pretzels are!  The absolute best I've ever eaten.  My only alternation is that I basted each pretzel with melted butter right out of the oven.  I served mine with homemade mustard, cream cheese and pumpkin butter.

I've made these pretzels 3 times now.  The first two times, the only adjustment I made was to lower the temperature a bit. These pretzels are phenomenal.  They are my first foray into the whole baking bread/yeast, mixing dough thing and I found the intstructions easy to follow and turned out well!  This last time I tried two things:  pretzel bites instead of big pretzels and substituted 2 cups whole wheat flour.  They came out burned a bit.  I think I should have adjusted my time a bit because there was more surface area to be cooked?  The Whole wheat thing, while healthier, makes them taste a lot more like dinner rolls with lots of butter and salt than pretzels.

I made this with one change.  I didn't have enough white flour so I used 3 1/2 cups of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour.  Worked beautifully.  For future: I would lessen the sugar to 1/4 cup as the dough was a touch too sweet for me.  Double up on the cookie sheets so that the bottom will be thicker to protect the pretzel's bottoms.  Mine got a bit too dark despite putting it on the top rack.  And when they say roll it out real thin, do it pencil thin as this expands ALOT while baking.    But this recipe is a keeper and was delicious!

Made these into pretzel bites for a party and they were gone in minutes!  I mixed the ingredients in reverse (gradually added the flour to the liquids, instead of liquids to flour) like I do with other doughs, so probably ended using about 4 1/4 c. flour.  But very very easy and our kitchen smelled fabulous while they baked!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great! Just like Aunt Annies. I made them into twists because for some reason I couldn't get the pretzel shape down pat. I know I'll be making this often so hopefully my pretzel making skills will improve. Thanks for a great recipe!

Well, I wish I'd read the review about adding more water...my dough was a little crumbly, but nothing we couldn't work with.  To keep down on the fat at the end of the process I used water in a spray bottle, sprayed the pretzels, then sprinkled them with salt.  As the water dries the salt sticks!  Great taste, even with my challenging dough!

Had to add about 1/3 cup more water to make the dough. Proportions seemed a little off. Otherwise very good, husband had two! I just wished they looked more like pretzels and less like buns. I guess I need more practice.

Had to take them out half a minute early so they didn't burn.  Next time might try them more around 425 so they get fully cooked but don't burn on the bottom.  They stay soft even after they cool! Yum.

My son and husband ate almost the whole batch in one day!  The kosher salt, baking soda bath, and dough are right on and really make these something special.   I didn't make my ropes long enough, so they were just fat little pretzels without holes, but they were so good.  I ate mine with cream cheese.  Mmmmm.  Next time I'm going to try to make my favorite from the mall - pretzel bites!

This a great soft pretzel recipe! My daughter and husband love them.  I added an egg and a little extra water and they turned out perfect. I also buttered them before and after baking them and they tasted just like the ones in the mall! Don't forget to roll them thin (the width of a finger) and they will be perfect! Enjoy!

Ohhhh myyy Goooodddd... that's the first thing that popped into my head when I took my first bite of my freshly baked pretzel. These are AMAZING. It was my first time making 'from-scratch' homemade pretzels and I will definitely be making them again. The dough was deliciously soft and... there are no words to describe it. The only step that I switched around was that I waited until after they were baked to spread butter and sprinkle some salt onto them. Maybe next time I"ll try it the other way around. Either way, I'm sure they'll be absolute BLISS. Thank you so much for this. :)

This is the best recipe ever. The final product is nice and soft on the inside and the perfect golden color on the outside. So easy to make too. If you want to make soft pretzels, this is the recipe to use. I just brushed butter on top of them after they came out of the oven. My family and I can't get over how delicious these are.

These pretzels turned out very well!  I made a  half-batch last night and my husband raved about them and hinted that I should make them again (I'm waiting for the dough to rise right now as I write this).   I did make a couple of adjustments, though:  I reduced the dough to 4 cups, and I used all brown sugar in both the yeast mixture and the flour mixture. This allowed the pretzel to come out soft and chewy, yet not doughy. And DO reduce your baking temperature to 400 to allow the pretzels to bake thoroughly while not scorching the bottoms. Also, be sure to use greased waxed paper or parchment, so that you can easily remove them from the pan. Immediately out of the oven, I brushed them with sweet butter (there's enough salt in there already) and served them warm.  They flew off the plate!

These are delicious! Be careful... they won't last long! After reading other reviews I only used 3 teaspoons of yeast and dropped the prezels into a pot of simmering baking soda solution before baking. They come out perfect every time. We make them often and brush them with garlic butter or parmesian cheese for a different taste.

This recipe is wonderful!  I took the advice of others and instead of using all white sugar, I used half white and half brown.  Initially I used 4 cups of flour, and then added almost another cup during the 10 minute kneading process.  Instead of making 12 huge pretzels, I made about 26 smaller pretzels which were easier to handle as a snack food while watching a movie.  I also made the honey mustard dipping sauce from this website which was excellent.  Thanks Christa for posting such a great recipe!

The recipe turned out great! I added just a pinch of salt to each pretzel after the baking-soda bath. Once they came out of the oven, I tasted them to determine if they needed more salt to top the butter I brushed on top. It didn't need any more salt, so I was happy I only used 1/4 of what the recipe called for as the topping. I used all of the salt it called for in the dough, however.

Oh so good and so easy.  If I had a stand mixer I'd make these all the time!  I made them with the nacho cheese sauce from this site for a super bowl party and they were a hit.  I ended up just making ropes and cutting them into pretzel, bites.  That for me was easier than trying to roll the ropes thin enough for actual pretzels.

These are fabulous! I had to add more water, and I used a mix of bread flour and wheat flour. Everyone loved them. Instead of making the pretzel shape I made knots out of smaller pieces, this made them perfect for party snacking, and really stretched the dough. I even stuffed some of the knots with little sausages! 450 was to high I baked mine at 425 for 10 min. Thanks for the recipe!

So good!  I'm not a huge pretzel eater, but a friend of mine told me about this recipe and I loved it.  I use this recipe to make pretzel dogs.  I just roll out the dough and slice it into bun length strips, just long enough to wrap around a Hebrew National.  I wrap the dog, dip in in the baking soda solution and then put it in the oven.  Takes a few extra minutes to cook, but they are so good!

I was looking for a fun recipe my kids and I could make together when stuck at home after an ice storm.  These are terrific!  Fun to make and more fun to eat.  I had to let my dough rise longer than the recipe called for, but that may have been because of the cold day.  And I ended up using less flour than called for as well.  Ymm.

HOLY COW!!!!!  These are carbohydrate crack!  They are delicious!!!!!!  I took the advice of others and just added the flour as needed...ended up using a little over four cups.  I made pretzel nuggest rather than fussing with the pretzel shape.  They came out beautifully at 400 for 6 minutes.  Wow, thanks for sharing...I will make these a lot!!!!!

To make this recipe even better, disolve the yeast and sugar in 1 1/4 cups warm BEER (instead of water).  And then serve with the Beer Cheese Dip II recipe from this site! I've never had an appetizer vanish sooner! And everyone asked for the recipe!

These are amazing! I cut the recipe in half and for the 2 1/2 cups of flour, I used 1 1/2 cups of unbleached all purpose flour and 1 cups of whole wheat flour. These were so delicious that I wish I had made the full batch!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  They came out looking and tasting very good.  I kept them in a zip lock bag.  The next day they are just as good if you put them in the microwave for about 20 seconds.  YUM!

Loved these pretzels.  Took advice of other reviews and decreased the amount of flour to 4c. and used butter instead of oil.  Baked at 400 degees for 10 min.  Moved oven rack up, bottoms did get brown quickly.  Great recipe, a keeper.

I enjoyed this recipe; it's hard to say that this really tastes like a soft pretzel.  Nevertheless, the flavor is good.  Things to note: only use 4 cups of flour and reserve some of the 4th cup to to use when kneading the dough; turn on the oven to 200 degrees and place the dough in an oiled boil over the back-burner for 1.5 hours; spread butter over the pretzels while the pretzels are cooking in the oven and again when the pretzels come out of the oven, and cook the pretzels in batches at 425F degrees for 10 minutes.  Update: I changed the serving to 4 and I only needed about 1 cup of flour.

This is a great recipe. I have made three dozen of these now. The first dozen didn't turn out as well. I didn't kneed the dough long enough and it was very hard to work with. It made thick pretzels. I suggest you adhere to the instructions on the kneed time. It helps! The second time I made a double batch. It was great! The dough was easy to work with and fluffy and light. The rolling is always the longest part, but you get a technique down after the first time you do it. My technique was to roll it like a snake in my hands and then once I got it about 8-10 inches long, I would put it on the table and roll as I put pressure on the ends rolling outward to lengthen the dough. I would start in the middle and work my way to the edge. It took a while to roll 24 pretzels, but it was well worth it. The baking soda dip is esential to the process. The first time I made these, I had the oven rack down too low and the bottoms were done before the top. I had to turn them over to get the tops brown. But, the second time I made them, I let them soak in the baking soda mixture for about 3 seconds before taking them out. I cooked the second batch at a slightly lower temperature (it may just be my oven), and I lowered the flour some. I lost count when I was doing the double batch with 10 cups of flour so I think I only used 9. Regardless, they turned out great. I also didn't have any kosher salt. I ate them plain and they were still great. The next batch I am going to make, I am going to try

Soooo Good!!! My kids LOVE these. Found this recipe about 3 weeks ago and have made it 4x's so far.  I do have to decrease the flour to between 4 to 4.5 cups and because my oven cooks super fast and at a higher temp than most, I cook mine at 350 for 8 minutes. They come out perfect each time - brown not burned at the bottom and perfectly chewy in the inside.  When I put them in the baking soda solution I wait until they float before I remove them - maybe 8 seconds.  And as soon as they come out of the oven I brush them with melted butter. YUM.  Oh, and these freeze very well.  Through out the weekdays, I just pull the pretzels out and warm for 30 seconds in the microwave for a great afterschool snack for the kiddos.

I grew up in Philly, so I KNOW my soft pretzels!! These were ok!! I omitted the 1/2 cup of sugar, and brushed with melted butter while baking!! But when I get "home sick" these will help a little!!

my pretzels came out big! They were PERFECT, better and thicker than mall pretzels. I did some with sesamee seeds, and some with cinammon and sugar, and some with salt. All were FIREWORKS in my mouth, WOW!!! I basted with butter once during cooking, and once while they were cooling. This is a new staple for snacks in the recipe box!

Made this recipe to the "T"! I did need to add a touch more water to knead it, but I don't count that as an "ingredient" after you mix it all together and realize the dough isn't wet enough. (just a baker thing) Anyway, served these with fondue and mustard for Oktoberfest..... and 50% of my guests wanted the recipe (and lessons on how to bake properly, hahahaa) I'll definately make these again. Unsalted or salted, they're great. (I recommend gray salt as a topper, but don't overdo it.)

Absolutely delicious. With my first batch, I over did it on the flour by accident. When I made the second, I made sure to be more precise. The first batch was good enough...they get even better when you actually make them correctly! I've stopped buying the pretzels in the mall completely...they don't even compare.

We are keeping this one! Loved them! I cut the flour down to 4 cups per others reviews and they turned out great! I did half w/ salt and the other half i brushed w/ butter and put cinnamon sugar on them...YUMMY! Next time I will not coat all of them as they were a bit soggy today but still tasty! My husband who is not a big pretzel fan LOVED them. Thanks!!

These were a family favourite!  I made a few exactly as the recipe stated and they were delicious.  I also made some pizza pretzels.  I did the baking soda bath and then put my own pizza sauce on top and baked them for the same length of time.  Those were the true favourites!!  My husband asked me to make them that way again every time!

After several failed attempts at making soft pretzels, I've found the perfect recipe.  These were incredible!  Once they were cool I put them in an airtight bag then heated them up in the microwave the next day and they were just as good as the first day.

Yummy!! I found them a little sweet though, and mine were brown on top before they were actually fully cooked on the inside. I think next time I will use a lower temp and lessen the amount of sugar. Other than that, no more mall pretzels!!

Followed the recipe exactly except used my breadmaker on dough setting.  Unlike others, found that 5 cups flour was perfect.  Baked 8 min at 450 and pretzels were very dark on the bottom, edible to adults but not children.  Reduced baking time and temp to 410 and they were golden brown but doughy inside.  My error may have been not rolling out pieces long & skinny enough before shaping into pretzels. Dipping in baking soda solution did not give a true pretzel crust, will try boiling next time.  Despite problems, recipe has potential and the pretzels are all gone (then again, my kids like raw bread dough...)

I followed others advise and only added 4 cups of flour.
After the dough had risen, I then divided into two.  One for sweet the other for savoury.
For the savoury I chopped up jalepeno peppers and added this with grated parmesan to the dough.
I also sprinkled extra parmesan on top before baking.  These tasted wonderful.
The sweet were coated with cinnamon and butter when they came out of the oven.
I didn't find the dough buttery like the title suggests but they were still good.

These were excellent - and very close to Auntie Anne's. I made them for an appetizer before Easter dinner and they were devoured. I made half with salt, half with cinnamon sugar. After reading the debate over using 4 or 5 cups of flour, I used 4 1/2 cups. Worked great! I'll definitely be making these again.

These were great. I used the 4 cups of flour like most people. Shape the dough into a rectangle. Use a pizza cutter to make the 12 stirps and roll out between your hands before you make the pretzel shape. I put these in a zip lock and the salt melted. To reheat throw in the toaster. They taste like they were just made.

I followed this recipe almost exactly (I actually added some water to the dough before letting it rise so it'd come together), and came out with a ridiculously stiff dough that I couldn't do anything with. I ended up scrapping it.

this is a good recipe! however, as previous reviews noted, it calls for too much flour! i do live in a dry climate, but i had to add a 1/4th a cup of water extra.  after the dough had risen, i found it still very difficult to roll out  into ropes and wonder if even more water may have been needed.  despite this being said, the pretzels were delicious.  i did put the pan on the top rack though! otherwise, the bottoms would have burned for sure!

I think these are even BETTER than the ones from the mall. Not only do they taste wonderful, they make the house smell incredible and, let's face it, that's what sucks us to the counter. How can anything I make myself, at home, for a fraction of the cost, with hardly any effort compare with the mall!

I followed the recipe verbatim and they turned out beautifully.  My 3 very young children even helped shape them.  They came out a little "rustic" looking, but when something tastes this good, you can forgive appearances.

I followed the recipe precisely and am not pleased with the results. First off, the temp was too high so they browned too quickly on top and the insides were still doughy. Also, 5 cups is WAY too much flour (maybe that's why they were so doughy???).  

Next time, I will use only 4 cups of flour, 1/2 the amount of sugar and decrease the baking temperature to 400 degrees.

The lesson I learned?  Always, ALWAYS read all the reviews first!!!  :)

These pretzels tasted good although not "buttery".   I only needed 4 cups of flour instead of 5.  The dough was easy to work with.

These were vrey easy to make and very tastey.  They were gone as fast as I could pull them from the oven.  But they lacked the buttery taste that I love in Auntie Anns Pretzels. I brushed them with melted butter after removing them from the oven and that is good as long as you eat them immediately or they get soggy and the salt disloves.  I also tried to brush them with butter before baking but that just brushes the salt off.  My sister in law is not a fan of Pretzel chains but she loved these so something must be right with them. ;)  Thank you.  It will definately stay in my box I will just have to tweek it to get that buttery taste.

Oh my, these are the best homemade pretzels I have ever had. I was really skeptical when my dough turned out really dry, but I added some water and it turned out great!! Just like the Auntie Anne's pretzels at the mall, but a heck of a lot cheaper!!! I would recommend these to anyone!!!

I dont really see how these are called Buttery Soft Pretzels considering theres no butter involved.. thats the best part!  I brushed them with melted butter right after they came out of the oven..sooo good. I also made these into twists instead of the pretzel shape.  I added cinnamon sugar and raisins to some and salt and cheddar cheese to the others (I put the toppings on before baking).  Both were good.  I'll be making this again.

All I have to say is AMAZING! These were just as good as the mall pretzels and cost pennies to make! Definitely use less flour than the recipe calls for. This was my first time making bread of any kind and they turned out wonderful. I made some pretzel shapes and the others I made into sticks. So much easier and more to go around for everyone!

Wow--my kids LOVED these! The only complaint was that even though I changed the recipe to make enough for 10, there was "not enough". There was one for each person, which IS a serving. Be sure if your family is likely to demand more than a single pretzel you account for that in adjusting your recipe size. They were easy to make and tasted great!

I love this! Ill make them and freeze them so I can eat them all the time! I only use 4 cups flour and 3 of which i use whole wheat flour!

It makes them have a much richer taste and is complemented excellently with mustard.

I also use kosher salt for the whole recipe., not just on top. 

love!!!

I thought this recipe was great! And after adding my own toppings they tasted just like the soft pretzels you can get at the mall. I did make a few modifications as per some of the previous reviewers, I only used 4 cups of flour, 1 tsp of salt and 1/4 cup more water than listed in order to keep the dough consistent. As for toppings I used melted butter with ground garlic, parmesan cheese and sesame seeds (which I spread on both before and after they came out of the oven) as one kind and cinnamon and powdered sugar as another. Very delicious, they came out flavourful and not a bit too salty or too sweet as others have mentioned. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was pretty difficult to make.  Kneading the dough is tough if you do it by hand as I did.  And then rolling the dough into long strips to twist into pretzels was even more difficult.  Overall, they turned out really thick and bready, not like the Auntie Anne's in the mall.

were great straight from the oven but didn't hold up well to store.  I think I will have to warm them to make them good again.  Hubby loved them, and I will make them to go with beer and spicy mustard for octoberfest.

This recipe is fabulous.  My husband loved them!!  I did decrease the sugar a bit and they were still very sweet.  I added a bit more water until the dough looked like it formed better in my mixer.  Also, after placing them on my cookie sheet I sprinkled them with salt.  They were perfect!

I used 1 packet (1 gram) of stevia instead of sugar and 4 cups of flour instead of 5.  Used the dough attachment    on my mixer and this came out looking a little dry.  I resisted the urge to add more water as this is a dry bread and letting it rise.  The dough was fighting me when it was time to roll out but wetting my hands with the baking soda mixture resulted in a long easy to weave dough.  Baked it for 10 minutes on a pizza/bread stone and ate this with a sprinkle of powder sugar & cinnamon right out of the oven (yes, i am a carb-a-holic). YUMMY!  Thank you for sharing this easy recipe.

The recipe called for either too much flour or too little water, making the dough very dry and difficult to combine into something workable.  Consequently, I had to add more than the one or two tablespoons of water mentioned in the original recipe.  Although the pretzels smelled delicious out of the oven, the end result was very yeasty; I would recommend using, at most, only half the amount of yeast the original recipe calls for.  Moreover, it was difficult to roll out the dough into pretzel shapes that would not immediately shrink into small balls, but the recipe might make good dinner rolls.

I was looking for a new pretzel recipe and found the perfect one! Really, really good. I recommend brushing the pretzels with beaten egg yolk before sprinkling on the salt- it makes a nice, shiny appearance. These are fabulous out of the oven! A real hit on a rainy day!

Per other reviews, I decreased the flour to 4c and by accident, forgot to add the salt. Also, I halved the baking soda/hot water mix by half. It was a good thing I forgot to add the salt (which I noticed the mistake as they were baking) b/c the soda/water AND Kosher salt are enough. However, they were a little dense. Perhaps due to the less flour? Not sure. Still, they were good...esspecially once dipped into the beer cheese (from "Beer Cheese Pretzel and Dip" also found on this site). Although they disappeared I think I'll continue using another pretzel recipe I have also found from this site instead. Thanks just the same Christa.

These were so good!  The kids had so much fun making them.  We shaped ours like letters and spelled out our names.  What a fun project!  I cut the flour down to 4 cups also after reading some of the reviews.  I also added a tablespoon of bread dough enhancer.  I don't know if that helped or not, but my dough was just perfect.  We dipped ours in mustard.  Absolutely delicious!!  Great recipe!

I had to add about 3 T of water to make the dough workable, and even then it was still crumbly and I could not get it thin enough for a "mall pretzel".  I decided to make bite-sized oblong pretzels and added a tiny bit of Cheez Whiz Light to the middle, and that tasted fabulous once I got the hang of folding over the sides so that the cheese wouldn't ooze all over the outside of the pretzel.

My dough was incredibly dry and I had to add more than a couple of tablespoons of water to get it to a workable consistency.
I also had a hard time rolling the dough into ropes, the dough was very stiff.
The overall taste was great, though.  My kids loved them.  I will make them again, but maybe cut down on the amount of flour -- or something.

While the taste WOULD be amazing, the pretzels didn't rise. In fact, they didn't fully cook on the inside though they started to  burn on the outside. We ended up cutting the pretzels into half planes so that the inside could cook. They did not rise ever.

TIP: I looked up the mistake. Please update recipe to say: bring baking soda solution into a boil and then DIP THE PRETZELS FOR 30 SECONDS before placing them on the baking pan. Also, beware of your oven. If it tends to overcook your food, lower the temperature until you get it right. Good luck!!

This recipe is a great base to endless possibilities! I made this for my man and I just today, but I stuffed them with spinach and  cheddar with garlic and chives, topped with a sprinkling of garlic salt. They were really good and great light lunch for us. 

I cut the dough into 8, thinking I would need the added for stuffing each. I was wrong.  Next time I will cut it to 12, as these puff up nicely and a thinner wrapping would be ideal.  Will try stuffing with pizza fixings next time, along with another few like these, with only a bit more added garlic inside.

These pretzels are delicious! I made them twice. The second time, I cut back on the flour (I used just under 4 cups instead of 5) and that seemed to work better for me. These are a family favorite.

My first attempt at real soft pretzels and they were a success.  I reduced the flour to 3.5 cups and that made a perfect dough.  We love how sweet these are, without being "too sweet".  A light brushing of butter when they came out of the oven made then perfect! Can't wait to turn this dough recipe into Pretzel Bread Rolls.

Tasted good! best pretzels I've ever had! I gave my pet worm some and he thought they were amazing as well. Though he later died due to the fact he was a worm and i only fed him pretzels. I guess i'm not a very good worm rancher. You know, my mother always told be that I would never be a worm rancher. I guess I should have listened to her. I invested over 10 grand in worms but forgot to buy some dirt for them to sit in. Didn't have the money to buy any dirt and now i'm homeless with 9,999 worms. I don't know how it ended up like this. But those pretzels,  are they good. Almost makes me forget about my homelessness and worm problem. Almost...

So good, only thing I would change is eating them more slowly to savor it! They're so soft with that little bit of crunch from the crust! Just note it may seem like too much flour when you are making them into ropes and shaping the pretzels, but trust me they're suppose to look ugly, skinny, and small, they rise beautifully in the 8 minutes that they're in the oven...trust me I was shocked thinking it was going to turn out bad. I always brush on melted butter and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on them when they are done baking to eat with, personal preference though, I love it this way! Just as great plain and by following the recipe as it is though! Enjoy!

I made it for the first time 3 weeks ago and have already made it twice since.  Guess it was a hit!!!  My skills are lacking when it came to forming it into the pretzel shape, I just made them into sticks the last time.  If you do this, be sure to roll them out thin because they plump up and can become doughy.

These were really yummy! It is the last of many pretzel recipes that I tried. I finally found "the one". I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle. I started with the yeast proofing  step (in the bread pan) as directed in the  original recipe. Then I added the rest of the sugar, the water, and the oil. I added the flour a little at  a time  as the machine started kneading. I think I added a little less than four cups. I think most of the people who complained about the recipe don't understand that flour in bread is not always the same amount and you need to play with it until it is "right".   Once the dough was the right consistency I left it to run through the dough cycle in the bread machine.   After the cycle was complete I finished the pretzels according to the original recipe. I boiled the pretzels in the baking soda bath. The baking soda bath is essential. The baking soda soak is what causes the pretzels to brown on the outside and still be soft on the inside.  These were almost identical to the overpriced pretzels they sell at the mall,

WAY awesome, kids love them BUT WAY too much flour.  As another rater stated, only start with 3 cups of flour or you will be adding about 1/2 c or more of water, not just a couple table spoons. Other than that this has to be the best recipe I've ever used for pretzels and makes better pretzel bites than you can buy at Auntie Ann's.

fun recipe to make. 

Did as others suggested and reduced the flour to 4 cups, i also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. It still needed about half a cup more water. Would definitely make this again.

Just made them for the night crew I'm working with and they are awesome!! Every one loved them!  I found this recipe very easy to follow I didn't have any oil so I used butter as a replacement and it was great! I will continue to make these for years to come.

I love this recipe! I was craving Aunt Annie's yesterday, but I didn't feel like leaving the house so I googled soft pretzels and this came up. Really simple!!!!!! Instead of kosher salt, which is the same as regular table salt but the difference is that kosher salt grains are bigger, I used cinnamon sugar. After soaking them in the baking soda water I just rolled the damp dough in the cinnamon sugar before baking. Yummmmmmy! I then made an icing using 8oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup soften butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 2 cups confectioner (powdered) sugar! Yummmmmmy It's also good with a cheese sauce that is the popular 16oz velveeta and a can of rotel. :) im fat now haha I could see this being fun for kids to make because playing in the dough was fun. If you are looking for a warm place just turn your stove onto 500 degrees and sit the metal/tin (not plastic because it will melt) on top the stove. :)

These soft pretzels were delicious. I followed the recipe except I used only 4 cups of flour as suggested by other reviews. It worked out perfectly. I boiled the water with the baking soda. Keeping the dough covered with a damp towel is key to being able to elongate the dough without it retracting.  I used cinnamon and sugar and some with just salt for topping before putting them in the oven. When they came out they were brushed with melted butter.  They were soft and buttery and the ones with cinnamon and sugar were amazing. 
Great recipe. I'm going to repeat next weekend!!

I used my bread maker on dough setting. I followed other recommendations and used 4 cups flour and it was perfect. I also cut the bath in half. You only need a little to coat them. They are amazing

First time making pretzels and they turned out pretty good, I would definitely start with less flour than the recipe states, I never really got the texture I wanted with the dough but it was still good anyway.  I'll make it again

We have made these multiple times and love them! We definitely use less flour as a lot of other have said. 3 cups maybe. 
We also took the suggestion and sprayed them with butter and salted them right before we put them in the oven.

Great recipe. Needs a little tweaking, but the base recipe is good, and very simple.

Having never eaten or made soft pretzels before, I didn't have much to compare to, except the small, crispy pretzels one buys in a bag. But this recipe made it easy. The rolling out was still kind of tedious, but *no* recipe is going to get you out of that. 

My tweaks: *Used more yeast due to the weather. Its too cold here to expect 4tsps to work that well. Increased to 2 tblsp and it worked great. *This recipe calls for too much flour for my elevation. (Then again, nearly EVERY recipe does. :P) So I started with 3 cups of flour, and that was plenty. Another half cup (roughly - put on by small amounts) used for dusting and making the dough non-sticky during kneading and during shaping. I also replaced the oil with butter for better flavour. *Sea Salt instead of kosher.

End result GOOD flavour. I did find the dough was way too sweet for a pretzel. Next time I make them, will probably cut the sugar in half, or down to a tablespoon for the yeast. Also found the bottoms darkened faster than the rest. Lowered temp to 375 and bottoms were still overdone. Next time I might try brushing baking soda wash on, to keep the bottoms clear.

Will retry this recipe with noted changes, though. It was good.

Fabulous! I've made these several times and they always turn out scrumptious! I followed the advice of others to use less flour and that's worked well for me. The only other change I make is to use half the amount of soda and hot water for dipping, and it's more than enough. I've also used this recipe to make pretzel rolls - it makes 12 dinner-sized or 8 large rolls. When making rolls, I stir a couple teaspoons of soda into 1/2 cup hot water. I form the rolls, place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and brush them with the soda water. After they've risen until double, I brush them again, sprinkle them with kosher salt, and cut a small "x" in the top of each one. I bake them at 425 degrees for 5 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350 for 10 minutes more. They look just like store-bought pretzel rolls, but taste so much better! However I make it, this recipe is a family favorite!

I bake bread a lot. This is a good recipe. Don't skip the baking soda bath! It makes a big difference. I sprinkled some with fresh Parmesan cheese prior to baking. I got maybe 25 decent pretzels out of this...not meal sized but still nicely sized for a snack.

I have never made this type of recipe and I figured with a 4.5 star rating and over 1500 people rating it, it would be awesome. WAYYYYY too much flour... its a mess, cannot be fixed, would not recommend.

Made this several times... Great each time! BUT... I use melted butter instead of oil, and approx 4 1/2 C flour versus the stated 5C.  I start with 3.5 C flour, mix, and add flour till the dough is not sticky. They really do taste like the ones at the mall....

Awesome pretzels!! I used a little more water while mixing/kneading. I also used 1/4 cup of baking soda instead of 1/2 cup. Once they came out of the oven I brushed with melted butter. So good.

This recipe was easy to make.  We had high hopes for the pretzels we had in Munich but were a bit disappointed.  I will agree that there is too much flour in the original recipe.  In the end, we only used 4 cups of flour.

This is the best recipe ever (besides chocolate chip muffins)! Take my rating and multiply it by 20. If you don't know that answer, it is 100, which is what i would rate this. I halved the recipe. If you do the regular amount, take out 1 cup. If you half the recipe, take out 1/2 cup. DO NOT FORGET THE BUTTER. For every 6 pretzels, melt 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter. I made 6 and made 2 salted, 2 cinnamon sugar, 2 salted and cinnamon sugar. Good every way. Remember, take out the flour, use the butter and this is a 100 STAR RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Followed recipe exactly as told, except noticed that the dough was really dry while kneading it and simply added about 3 extra tablespoons of water and they came out fabulous!! Easy recipe even for a first timer....as this was my first time making pretzels. Hubby and kiddos are requesting more...looks like I will be making another fresh batch today. They taste delicious with butter and sea salt or also sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. Happy baking folks!! This recipe is a keeper!!!

Love this recipe!!!! I'm done buying mall pretzels! I started by making the plain salted pretzels. THOSE WERE GONE IN MINUTES! I ended up making different variations of them instantly because I was hooked!!! I made a jalapeño and cheese pretzel, pepperoni and cheese pretzel and for my Hawaii people... I made a spam and furikake pretzel!!!

I just made these pretzels for a party.  When they came out of the oven my husband and I tried them with a honey mustard, a whole grain mustard and a beer cheese sauce I made.  THEY ARE DELICIOUS.  Even better than I expected.  They came out beautiful, soft, chewy and with that awesome sweet yeasty taste a good bread dough has......I can't wait to make them again.

I made this recipe for my family and everyone loves it. I only put 3 cups of flour like a few others suggested and it was perfect. They are doughy and delicious, the best recipe I've tried so far!

These pretzels were amazing. My husband and I really enjoyed them. I followed the recipe as given. This recipe was simple and easy. The pretzel tasted just like Auntie Anne's pretzels at the mall. It only took me about two hours to make. I used more butter for taste. I also drizzle a little cinnamon and sugar with extra butter. Delicious!!!!

First of all, to make a good pretzel, you really just need any basic dough recipe and the baking soda bath.  The baking soda bath is what makes it pretzelly.  

The key alterations I found was that I only needed about 3 cups of flour.  If you didn't read the reviews and started with 5 cups of flour, your pretzels will suck.

I also changed was only using half the amount of water/baking soda for the bath (and I still had more than I needed for 12 pretzels - you could probably 1/4 it).

4 tsp of yeast is a lot for something that doesn't actually need to ride all that much.  You can get away with just 2 or 3.

The other thing the recipe was missing was instructions for rolling out the dough.  I divided my dough into 12 parts rolled each piece between my hands into a fat snake (like you'd do with playdough).   Then I used my rolling pin to roll it into a long flat strip (about 24 inches).  Once I got the length I needed, I rounded it out to the thickness of my finger.

I also cooked mine at 450 for 15 minutes but I've seen a variety of reviews about cooking for less or lower temps.

Absolutely delicious! I made these two days in a row because they were gone so fast. The second time I made about 20 pretzels out of the dough instead of the dozen the recipe says. My German roommate says they taste exactly like the ones he grew up eating. Definitely a success!!!

Wow that is really all I can say, this is the first time I have made pretzels and I will definitely make this again. We love them so much that my room mate almost finished the first 6 before the second ones were done cooking I had to cut her off. In the past I have had some trouble with yeast so I was doubting how it would come out but it was delicious and amazing. I had to add 4 extra spoons of water because it was too dry, also I was very concerned when I was needing the dough it was really tough like popped my wrist out of place tough but I continued anyways and I am so glad I did these are at least as good as pretzels at the mall. Follow the recipe to the T with the exception of if you need more water and you will end up with the most amazing pretzels I will no longer be buying these at the mall because I will now be making them at home Just perfection. I loved it so much I joined the cite just to do the review :D

Wonderfully easy and fantastic recipe. Made it two times in one day because they were gobbled up so quickly and we had to have some for lunch next day! Will make again and again. The other reviews were very helpful for me as a first time pretzel maker. Would reduce the yeast to 3 1/4 or 3 1/2 tsp next time. Added 4 cups flour and added little bits of the final cup as necessary but didn't need fully 5cups for sure. Baked in approximately 6 1/2 minutes!

I thought this was great. I'm sure it would work well with less flour, but I stuck to the recipe anyway.I let the dough rise for 90 minutes, because it seemed a little bit too firm. I suggest that you knead the dough a second time and let it rise another 90 minutes (that is what I did and they came out great).

This is the first time I've made anything with yeast.  I followed the recipe and directions exactly.  These were FANTASTIC!  I did six with kosher salt and six with cinnamon sugar.

This was a pretty good recipie! However, I would place a piece of parchment paper on the cookie sheet before you dip the pretzels in the baking soda solution. The solution permanently stained my cookie sheets.

These pretzels surprised me. I didn't expect them to be as good as they were. I had to make a couple of adjustments but have made 4 batches and now have it down. I boil the water with baking soda and cook at 425 which makes a huge difference. I butter and salt them to taste and you should too. They're not Auntie Anne's but pretty dang close and hard to resist.

The recipe was fairly simple. My kids and I enjoyed this very much. It was soft and chewy inside and had a thin browned crust. I'll definitely make this again. I only added a little butter right out of the oven and sparingly sprinkled coarse salt. I'll add more butter and salt next time now that I know how the bread tastes.

My family loved these! I put the oven on 400 instead like some users said and only used 3 cups of flour and they came out perfect. The darker you let them get the better they are! Crispy out side, light fluffy inside. Perfect!

I have a complaint...I CAN'T STOP EATING THEM! lol i had to freeze half just so i would!! these are great, i followed the recipe as written, and did end up adding 2 tablespoons more water as suggested..did not use a floured surface as I didn't need to...they rolled easy for me. I dipped them in a nacho cheese sauce, also from this site, chilled, it taste and has the same consistency as a popular cheese dip at a certain mall pretzel shop...and i have to agree with others, the melted butter brushed on top is a must! love them and will make again and again and again!

Very tasty and a lot easier than I expected. I made one regular batch and one with cinnamon and sugar. Both were great. I didn't get to freeze any like I wanted because they went so quickly. Will be trying again. Thank you!

Delicious pretzels!!! They don't have quite the mall look, (I have a whole new appreciation for the skill it takes to shape dough into a pretzel now.) but they look, smell, and taste delicious. I read a few reviews before I tackled this recipe and the modifications were very helpful. I baked them at 400 for 10 minutes and that was perfect. (4500' elevation) A little less flour was helpful too, I think I used about 3.5 - 4.0 cups. The other modification I made was brushing on the baking soda solution vs attempting to dip the dough into it. I couldn't keep the dough from disintegrating and falling apart. (It may be because I have a highly developed skill in dunking Oreo Cookies and that technique does not transfer into dunking raw pretzel dough.) When I took them out of the oven they were golden brown and smelled wonderful. A little spray butter and whaa-laa ... delicious pretzels!!!

Love these.  This recipe is perfect.  Others have too much sugar.  I find it hard with the twisting, so I just make pretzel logs.

I just made these about two hours ago, was looking for a recipe that didn't require bread flour and this fit the bill. I was able to get a crispy shell but a soft, fluffy inside. I would suggest varying the temp between 370 and 425 as some stoves may run hotter. Also, I turned the stove off when they started to get a light brown and let them set for 5 minutes. That made handling them a lot easier as well since they weren't overly hot. Other than that, this was a solid, easy to follow recipe. Thank you for sharing it, my family loved them!

I was worried about this recipe while shaping the dough because it seemed to be not so smooth and too easy to rip, but my pretzels turned out beautiful. Two suggestions: First, make sure you let the baking soda solution drip well before the pretzels go in the oven, otherwise it will burn on your baking sheet (doesn't affect the pretzels, but the smell scared me enough that I took out the pretzels before they were ready). Second, if you aren't sure about whether your pretzels are done, poke them with a toothpick to see if they are doughy or chewy in the middle.

AMAZING! This was the first time I tried making pretzels and they came out great. I liked how the dough was sweet and it had a salty crunchy crust. The only thing I recommend is brushing the tops with an egg wash before baking.

I tried this recipe twice, both times using the lower amount of flour as suggested by previous reviewers.  While the taste was good I ended up with pretzel "buns" rather than pretzels.  My husband said just roll the dough out longer and make bigger pretzels.  This proved harder for me than I thought it would be.  The three stars are for a recipe that is difficult for me to duplicate after a couple of tries, but still tastes pretty good.  Hopefully you will give these a try and have better luck than I.

I read some of the reviews for this recipe and adjusted by using 3 1/2 c of flour, used 1/4 c sugar, used butter instead of vegatable oil, NO salt...only for topping, and cut back to 2 tsp baking soda and 1 cup of hot water...Baked at 400 degrees for 9 minutes...THESE WERE GREAT!!! I loved them just as much as those sold in the mall.  I recommend them and have already shared this recipe...

Needed less flour than called for (~4 cups) but added a tablespoon of gluten (or you can use bread flour instead). The texture seemed more like a bagel than a pretzel, but they're practically the same things. I shaped them into treble clefs (musical theme) as a gift to a music teacher. I thought they came out great after buttering them and sprinkling cinnamon & sugar on top.

I used my bread machine for this recipe to make it even easier! I changed a few quantities though; 4 cups of bread flour, I omitted the 1 tsp of sugar (as you don't need to wait for the yeast to get frothy when using the bread machine), 1 1/2 cups of warm water and used only 1 tsp of salt as the salt on the outside of the pretzel made them salty enough. They were amazing! I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I make this quite often. And it normally comes awesome. I can make it sweeter or not. FLuffy big or littles one. After reading the reviews i think some dont know how to read the dough and correct it as needed. Its a family hit that doesnt last long. And you do not need a breadmaker to knead the dough. Its tough until you get the hang of it.

This is the best pretzel recipe I have tried! I have been using it for about a year now and am never disappointed. I have tried them plain, with herbs, with garlic and cheese, and with various other things in them and they are always soft and delicious. I have never been able to make them for other people unfortunately because I know I would eat them all before I made it there...
Make sure you don't add all the flour though, just add it in gradually and stop when the dough stops being sticky. I like to sprinkle kosher salt on them right after I dip them in the baking soda bath and then brush them with melted butter after they come out of the oven

These were amazing!  I've only recently started making bread and this was my first time attempting pretzels.  The recipe was really easy to follow.  I took the advice of a couple other reviewers and added a bit more oil & salt to the dough.  Adding the oil was a good move, I think.  I didn't have to flour the counter before turning out the dough...it was perfectly smooth and didn't stick at all.  I also used only 4 cups of flour instead of 5...for the amount of liquid, 4 just worked better.  My dough wouldn't take any more than that.  I will be making these again next weekend, both because they were a huge hit, and because I need to practice my pretzel-shaping technique  :)

these turned out delicious!  I followed the recipe except for oven temp- I did 415 as another reviewer suggested- they still browned quickly and were done in 9 mins. I almost wished I doubled it because we want to freeze some to have on hand.  These won't last long around here!

We LOVED this recipe. My 4 yr old & I made letter pretzels to spell out his name and an elephant! This would be a fun project for a home birthday party if you made the dough ahead of time. Its pretty much like play doh until you dip it in the baking soda mixture. Then they could sprinkle it with the cinnamon sugar or some colored sugar sprinkles. So fun!!!

Loved these! The only reason they dont get 5 stars from me is because I mad a few minor adjustments. I was unsure of how much flour to use since I read mixed reviews about the amount of flour to use. So I used 4 1/2 cups. I used my bread maker to make the dough. I did make the yeast as specified before I added the rest of the ingredients to the machine. When my dough was ready before it rose I took it out and placed it in bowl to rise and continued with the recipe as written. I had no problem rolling them out to pinky sized ropes. I also adjusted the oven temp to 415 and only made half the baking soda and water solution and it was plenty.

I made half with salt and the other half with cinnamon n sugar. For the cinnamon sugar ones I did NOT sprinkle with salt before baking. When done I dipped them in butter to help the cinnamon and sugar stick. I have 4 kids ranging in ages from 16-6 and they all loved them.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  Made them a second time and used less baking soda and water for the dunking and worked out the same. I also added a tablespoon of both dough conditioner and vital wheat gluten and turned out really nice with crispy exterior and chewy insides. Made them as pretzel bites and the kids ate them until they were stuffed with white flour goodness.

I love this recipe!  Everyone that has ever tried them loves them too!  I did cut the flour down to 4 cups.  I bake them at 415 degrees F for 8 minutes and brush them with butter after they come out of the oven.  Yummy!

I am so excited I finally got these to work!  I have tried them many times and they always turned out like hard and dry pieces of bread. When I tried to roll the ropes they constantly crumbled and fell apart.   A few things I FINALLY did right (for those who are also struggling): 1. I added A LOT less flour - I made 1/2 batch and probably left about 2/3 cup of flour out and still had to add a few tbsp of water.  2. I timed my kneading - I think I was way under-kneading.  3. when I mixed the baking soda and water I used the hottest water I could get out of my tap AND put it in the microwave for 45 sec.  The baking soda still didn't totally dissolve but they did turn out more pretzel-brown.  I only gave 4 stars because they still aren't quite as good as the mall ones and they don't have that perfect brown crust you usually find on pretzels.  Still a great snack to make though!

One word "Yummy", they were much better than Auntie Anne's. I did use bread flour instead of all purpose. My kids devoured them within minutes. I may have to make more tomorrow. The recipe was very easy to follow, next time I will have my daughter roll the dough into ropes and add jalapeno with sharp cheddar to half the dough.

I followed this recipe exact and I found the dough a little tough to work with. The flavor was really good but I think the next time I make this I'll play with the dough a little more to make it more workable.

I loved these pretzels. I actually halved the recipe and reduced the flour to 3 cups vs. 3 1/2 cups.  I also added 2 tbs of water.  I found that this ration got the dough just right. I let the yeast, hot water and sugar proof in my bread machine and then tossed in the rest of the ingredients and set it to "dough".  Using my bread machine to knead the dough made it super easy.  A learned how to shape a pretzel by watching a YouTube video.  I was able to make 6 pretzels. I baked two and froze the shaped dough for later.  I accompanied my pretzels with marinara sauce for dipping.  I can't wait to make other flavors that you can find at the pretzel chains in the mall.

Pretty much all I have to say is YUM!
I do think the flour could be cut back a bit, I had to add quite a bit of water to my dough to work it all in. Everything else was spot on, and they were a huge hit!

I'm 19 and live with my boyfriend. He was out of town this weekend so I decided to try this and if it was good enough, then I would make it for us when he returns. I've never baked anything successfully in my life, so I was really nervous before making this. I read many reviews and decided to only add 4 cups of flour. When they came out, I doused them with butter and salt and devoured them! Great recipe.

I made these exactly like the recipe said. It did  seem like it was going to be too much flour and I ended up adding 3 tablespoons of water to make up for it, but otherwise I followed the recipe. These pretzels really do taste like the mall ones. We made mostly salt ones and a few cinnamon ones, for which I followed another reviewers idea of adding honey to my butter to get the cinnamon/sugar to stick. They were seriously delicious. My husband did the baking soda bath for me and he said it dried out it hands, but otherwise these were fairly simple, just alittle time consuming. I will be making these again, no doubt.

I started out making the pretzel shape and found it's easier to just make pretzel sticks.  I got creative and added cheese and pizza sauce to the a few of them making them pizza stuffed pretzels.  Great to add to lunches.

These are so wonderful!!! Slightly sweet, slightly salty and warm and soft - perfect! I do change up the recipe just a bit. I use 3.5 cups of flour, bake at 400F for 8 minutes and butter them immediately out of the oven. Also, if you find that folding the pretzel 'shape' is difficult, make little swirls and call them 'pretzel snails' - my 4 y/o loves them!

These pretzels are delicious! I have made a few other pretzel recipes that I've found online, and this one is my favorite. The dough is a little difficult to knead and also difficult to roll out, but not too bad as long as you are patient. I am having a birthday party for a 3 year old in two weeks, so I have been making freeze-ahead recipes to alleviate stress the day of the party - this recipe is perfect! Of course I ate a handful of these when they came out of the oven, but the rest, I threw in a freezer Ziploc to freeze until the party! These will reheat best at 375 for 5 minutes. Also, I prefer to make a long rope out of the dough and cut into 1-inch bites rather than standard pretzels - much better for tiny little hands! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

A classic in my household.  I make these in my bread machine at least once a month.  I have found there's a little bit of an art in how you roll and shape them to get the best possible texture.

Loved the pretzels!  The dough required some minor adjustments.  I had to add another 1/2 cup of water to my dough for it to form well.  I think it would've worked out better had I weighed my flour.  And just because I wanted to, I used 4 tbsp of melted butter instead of the 1 tbsp of veggie oil it called for.  They were heaven!  They weren't like the mall pretzels but better!

WOW! These pretzels were amazing! we made the full 5 cups and we thought we were going to have too much bread, but it got eaten right when it came out of the oven. 
     This is more of a sweet pretzel than a salty pretzel. If you want to put salt on it, I would recommend reducing the sugar a little bit.
     We made ours by coating it with cinnamon sugar after we buttered them up. We made them with our friend and we sent some home with her. Her family ate them all as soon as she stepped through the front door. She came back for more.

    I would really recommend making these. YOU WON"T GO WRONG!

Made these on Sunday night, making them again 3 days later. I made some with some added herbs on top but the basic ones rock and are so easy! I've now made about 30 Dozen of these and they sell out every time.

Wonderful! So light and airy! My husband even called them "heaven". I gave it four stars due to the incomplete cooking directions. I only used 4 cups of flour plus more for kneading, as recommended by another reviewer. What I should have listened to another review but didn't was only baking on the top rack. DO NOT BAKE ON BOTTOM RACK!! The bottoms will for sure burn if you do. Take your time and wait for the first batch to cook before putting more in. Also, you'll only need half of the soda mixture stated. Four cups of water and all that baking soda was WAY too much! Will definitely make again!

you defiantly need a stand mixer for this recipe. It takes more water then the recipe calls for and requires 5-7 minutes of kneading on the dough hook. best if you let them rest for about 15 min after shaping them so the dough can relax if not the dough will remain stiff and dense.

My boyfriend had a craving for a mall pretzel, so, as usual, I made it a mission to please his appetite. Great recipe! The only problem is you should eat them right away, they definitely do not taste the same the next day.

Fabulous! My modifications include: using molasses instead of sugar to proof the yeast and half the sugar called for in the recipe for the dough. I've tried both dipping the pretzels in a hot water solution - as suggested - and in boiling water, as other recipes suggest. I prefer this method (hot water). It doesn't stop the pretzels from rising more in the oven (as the boiling method does), but I like the texture of the finished product better - slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (as opposed to more chewy on the outside). They are absolutely divine fresh out the oven - but it's hard to stop at just one!

these are fantastic! Kneading it was a pain and a bit hard, so was rolling it out, but it was all so worth it.

I do think the half cup baking soda and 4 cups water can be reduced. Going to make this again, and again and so on

My yeast didn't bloom as much as it should have... so the pretzel dough didn't rise as much as was planned. I ended up with skinny pretzels. They were good though! The only real problem I had was that they turned a little too brown. That's not a problem with the recipe though... so TO ANYONE WITH SKINNY PRETZELS... COOK FOR 6 1/2 OR 7. THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!!!!

I would like to upgrade my rating to 4 stars and that is related to too much flour and the temp being too high.  

I tried the recipe a second time and it was better.  

I WOULDN'T advise putting any eggwash or butter on the pretzels BEFORE baking.

Excellent recipe with very well written instructions!  5 cups of flour was a bit much and I had to add quite a bit of water prior to kneading but they still turned out wonderful!  The kids loved them with cheese sauce.  I brushed them all with melted butter as they came out of the oven...delicious!  Thank you very much for sharing!

Great recipe!  Everyone raved about them. I followed the directions, except I used 3.5 cups of flour for the dough and another 1/2 cup while I was kneading it out.  I also used a damp wet towel over the bowl instead of plastic wrap.

These were awesome! I started out with 3 1/2 cups flour and then added more until the dough wasn't sticky. I also only used 4 tbsp. baking soda in the water and then blotted them afterwards with a paper towel. So excited to find this recipe and discover how easy they are to make.

Made these with my kids and they were awesome.  I divided the recipe into 1/4 since it was just the 3 of us and while I'm not sure I got every measurement divided correctly, they still turned out great.  My kids both said it was a great snack.

Good, but not quite as amazing as many reviews say, although that might be my fault since this is my first pretzel making attempt, despite making lots of bread and pizza dough. 
On the advice of other reviews, I started with 3C flour and only added another 1/2 C. Other than that, ingredient amounts seem just about right. I also lowered the oven temp a bit.
Will def try again.

I love this recipe. I make it all the time especially when I've got my cousins kids over here, they have so much fun helping. We use a pizza cutter to cut into bite size pieces. We also like to dip in butter after they are done cooking but what's best is using softened CREAM CHEESE as a dip :D

I cheated and used Trader Joes pizza dough instead of making it.  I must have done something wrong with the baking soda solution because my pretzels didnt brown up.  They tasted good though.

I just made these for the first time...They turned out fantastic! The only note I can add is that I did require much more water to form the dough. All and all this definitely gets a thumbs up in my house! They is saying quite a lot as my partner and I both used to be chefs and my family knows good eats when it is served. It is funny how some of the most simple foods can bring such pleasure. Give it a go!

Wonderful!  Changes I made: used butter instead of oil, halved the recipe, used 1 packet of quick-rising yeast.  I found with halving the recipe and using quick-rising yeast, you need to make the ropes quite thin for them to keep the correct shape (they still taste great a little misshapen, though :)  ).

WOW!  Dangerously good! Hard to eat just one. Only used 4 cups of four as suggested in the reviews, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Super easy. Can't wait to eat them again.

4 stars only because I also had to add significantly more water...otherwise a 5 star recipe!  !  I was a little worried since the dough was so thick even after adding a lot more water, but after the dough doulbled in size they turned out perfectly.  Will definately make again.I made these with a class of third grade students.  We made 24 pretzels in the shape of a ribbon design and they turned out delicious!!

Really delicious! I came across this recipe after my husband mentioned buying frozen soft pretzels, but I thought I could make something much more yummy and economical. THIS RECIPE IS PERFECT FOR BOTH!!! I wish I could give it more stars. This made 15 pretzels for us, and I made 5 with just butter, 5 with brown sugar and cinnamon, and 5 with kosher salt. None of my family members could pick a favorite.

These were wonderful pretzels! Easy enough for my 7 year old niece and I to enjoy making together...delicious enough to have them eaten in a flash! Very soft and a brush of butter after they came out of the oven made them extra buttery. Thanks for a "keeper".

Wow- these were way better than I thought they would be. No difference between the pretzel stores at the mall, other than theirs might look a little prettier than mine. I made a small first batch, to experiment with the amount of Kosher salt I was putting on, and used less for the second batch. Brushed the baked pretzels with some melted butter and they were truly delicious. I also used some of the dough to wrap hot dogs up. Added a light sprinkling of cheese and they were great. Will definitely make again- great recipe, Christa! :)

These are delicious! Baked at 400-415 for 8 min. I didn't use all the flour, maybe 4 cups. I need to practice rolling this out more, but the taste is right on!!!!!!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent! I only used 4 cups of flour and they came out light and chewy :). I also just twisted them into figure 8's because I can never figure out that pretzel shape. 
The only thing I would do differently is spray my parchment with cooking spray next time. They stuck to my parchment paper and I had to work to get them off.

These are great. The only change I made was to substitute Sea salt (from bulk) for the Kosher topping.

This is now one for my top 5 favorite bread recipes.

Easy, very straight forward and I feel good about eating something where I recognize all the ingredients.  I had a tough time with the water/flour ratio at first, but it was easily resolved in the first recipe.  Pretzels came out awesome.

These pretzels were fantastic! After sending a few to school w/ my teenaged daughter, I suddenly had more-than-usual stop ins from her friends and flat out pleas to make them some :) I toss them in a melted butter, garlic, salt, parsley combo mix that is gobbled up with quickness.

I have been in love with Pretzel Maker pretzels forever. I made this recipe today and it is a dead on match! I scaled down for 6 and used only 2 cups of flour instead of 2.5 cups, and kneeded the dough for 10 min and let it rise for 2 hours. Used 1 tsp of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also baked on a cookie sheet using pam. Baked at 400 for 7=8 min and it was perfect. I dipped them in melted butter and dipped in honey mustard sauce I got from Pretzle Maker! This was my first time baking and it was so simple. Homemade pretzels it is going forward. I will never purchase Mall Pretzels ever!

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could, they were amazing!  I followed the recipe as written and they turned out perfect (although my dough was perfect after 4 cups of flour - any more and I wouldn't have been able to work with it).  My husband and I both agreed, they were better than any pretzel we've had at the mall, and we really like mall pretzels!  I brushed butter on them out of the oven, and sprinkled salt on half of them and cinnamon-sugar on the other half.  Both were excellent, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

SOOOOO worth the effort!  My first pretzel-making foray was a success. I just ate one right out of the oven and even though I probably should have left it in for another minute, it's divine!  Didn't change hardly a thing except multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and got 14 good sized pretzels.  I did use a little less flour since other reviews said it was dry and brushed them with melted butter just cuz I like it that way.

Great pretzels taste just like the mall bought ones. A little time consuming which is the only reason i give it five stars. took me a long time for only twelve, so if you're going to make it I would double it.

I used to work at Auntie Anne's, during college, and of all the recipes I've seen on the internet, this is the one that comes closest. Using a mix of bread (high gluten) and all-purpose flour makes them even better. Try topping with garlic powder and parmesan, or add jalapenos or cinnamon and raisins, to get some of the other flavors. Now if only I can figure out how to approximate the sweet almond topping...  

Making them commercially, we baked them for about for about 7 minutes at 500 degrees. I'm still playing with time and temperature to get them just right.

Got a lot of rave reviews for these for our party, and they were all eaten.  I did add 50% more sugar, which made them a bit sweet but really tasty!  Wanted bigger pretzels and had a really hard time getting the dough rolled out long enough.  Finally resorted to using a rolling pin, but then had a hard time getting them to roll back into nice dough for pretzels.  So the pretzels looked a bit deformed, but since they still tasted great, who cares!?

BUTTERY?  Not really...delicious...YES!!  dipped into cinnamon sugar afterward and awesome!  I find it hard to believe that someone would dip into artificial butter and say it is better that way.  Real is best and this is a keeper.

Awesome! Buttery, flaky -- a nice pretzel. My husband enjoys that light hint of sweetness. It does remind me of a mall pretzel. I made some small modifications. On initial mixing of the dry ingredients, I started with about a half cup less flour, made my well, incorporated the yeast mix and oil into the dry, but added more flour as I went to achieve the exact consistency I was looking for -- smooth but not overly wet. My yeast was a little old, so I let it rise longer. I divided into slightly larger balls to make eleven, that way I could make longer ropes, and the little "faces" in the knots stretched and set nice from baking soda bath to pan. I lightly greased 2 of my glass 9 by 13 inch pans with unsalted butter and used coarse sea salt for my topping. I baked in the top tier of my oven and basted with salted butter halfway through baking and again to finish. I needed to increase my bake time slightly, and I did them in two batches. I basted again when they finished. Next time, I will experiment with different flavor toppings -- cinnamon, maybe garlic powder, the possibilities are endless :)

I have made these twice now.  From others advice, I used only about 4 cups of flour and the dough turned out nicely.  I also used my kitchen aid mixer and dough hook to mix the dough.  Make sure you roll the dough very long and thin, they puffed up quite a bit during baking.

These weren't  horrible by any means. I made these AFTER reading the reviews and cut my flour back by 1/2 cup and still had to add a couple tablespoons of water. Use your Kitchenaide if you have one, dough is tough to knead! These turned out okay when all was said and done, really had a yeast taste to them and weren't all that "pretzel" tasting but my boys are eating them as we speak. Drenched in butter after they were done and well butter makes everything taste better doesn't it??? LOL

Used 4 cups of flour vs. the 5 suggested from other raters and they turned out great!! Also basted the pretzels with honey butter after taking them out of the oven. Will definitely make again!

LOVED them. I made some strange-looking pretzels; couldn't really get the dough to cooperate. It was more of a pretzel bun, which made DELICIOUS sandwiches. Also dipped some in nacho cheese. :)

Only thing I did different: I boiled them for 10 sec in the baking soda solution. I really wanted golden brown pretzels--that's exactly what I got!

I followed this recipe to the T and found the dough too dry and had to add almost a cup of extra water. When I rolled them out and baked them, the outsides were almost burnt but the insides were still raw and doughy.  I am trying to cook my last batch at 350 and hope they're at least fully cooked, but I'll be trying a different recipe next time.

So great. Baked more like 13 minutes at 400 to make sure they didn't burn. Turned out perfectly. It was a bit tricky to know how thin to roll the pieces. Definitely not as thin/big as mall pretzels but actually more delicious, especially covered in butter + cinnamon-sugar! Mmm. Will make again. Possibly tomorrow :).

Very yummy! We halved the recipe but made no other changes as far as ingredients. 

When it came to the baking soda bath, I followed a review from another recipe here and actually boiled the pretzels in the bath for about 15 seconds. I found that the longer they boiled, the darker the crust gets when baked (I miss timed the first one or two!). This also made them tougher. So if you prefer softer, stick with 15-20 seconds.

We then brushed with butter and sprinkled with the kosher salt. Baked at a lower temp, 425 degrees, for 8 minutes (per another review). 

They cam out wonderfully! Will definitely make these again for snacks sometime!

Really great recipe! I found that I needed to start out with slightly more water in the beginning because the dough will be too chunky. Also, rolled out some of the pretzel dough and used cookie cutters to make shapes. Put them in the oven for about 3 min @ 450 deg F. EXCELLENT bite-sized pretzels.

Just took these out of the oven, and the looks and turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, (which I never do, but this is my first attempt at pretzels) and I will admit, I had m doubts. First of all, the dough was the toughest dough I have ever had to knead, and I was scared it wouldn't rise...but being my optimistic self (haha) I set it aside to let it do it's thing, and an hour later, I was pleasantly shocked to see that the dough had risen awesomely. So then I turned it out to my *ahem*lightly floured surface, sprinkled a bit of flour on top, and gave it a couple of kneads, cut it into the 12 pieces and began to roll it out....however, I must have used too much flour, and it was dry..dry..dry. I was devastated....till I figured I would just sprinkle a couple drops of water on the dough...and sure enough, though it felt wet, it rolled out beautifully! This dough is very forgiving!!!!  As a side note..it would be very easy to stuff as well, and I think I may try it next time..with cheese, or chocolate...or pizza stuffed...or ham and cheese stuffed...the possibilities are endless! I just shaped 1/12 of the dough out like I was going to make the pretzel, and then used the rolling pin to flatten it out...you could stuff it, close it up, and bake it accordingly....could be good! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great recipe!  I followed the directions except I omitted all sugar (except for the sugar that is mixed with the yeast).  If you don't want sweet pretzels, this is the way to do it.  Also, 2 minutes before they were done baking, I brushed melted butter on them and put them back in the oven.  
A few things about making these...  Roll them out really long (almost 1 1/2 feet) and roll them out in your hands starting at one end (with dough hanging) and working your way to the other end.  It's almost impossible to roll them out on a surface.  Also, I think that the dough needed about 1/4 cup more water (or more).  Lastly, they need a bit longer than 8 minutes to cook in order to get browned nicely.
Next time, I will try substituting some whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and maybe brush the pretzels with egg whites before cooking, because the baking soda didn't make the surface crackle (I assume that was the desired effect).  It didn't effect the taste either though--they were great!

Really good recipe.  I used 1/3 C sugar, and 1 tsp salt in the recipe instead.  Make sure you roll out the ropes really thin because they bake up quite puffy.  I bake mine plain and then brush them with melted butter and sprinkle with salt.  We all love them!  Thanks Christa!

THese are great!  They did stick to the pan pretty bad because of the soda/water mixture.  But I will make these over and over again.  BTW used all fo the ingredients but put all liquids in together and then added the dry mixture (salt last).

I LOVE this recipe! The whole family gets to help out and mold their own pretzel shapes, and eat their delicious creations. I made the recipe as is, and love it every time. Thanks for sharing! I have tried many soft pretzel recipes, and this one is the best. The baking soda bath works wonders!

I just made these pretzels and they turned out PHENOMENAL!  I didn't have kosher salt so I had to use table salt on the top but they still turned out!  I brushed butter on them after baking as well and am so glad I did!  They are delicious!!

Tasted just like the pretzels you buy at the mall! I did make mine a little too thick so it could have been cooked a little more in the middle. The pretzels rise & expand a lot so even if it looks as if you got a long, thin roll, it can probably be thinner.

I had to add more liquid to the dough as many others stated. (But Alton reminds us that that is why you should measure by weight...but we don't) I ended up doing a rough pretzel shape with all of them and then going back to the first one and refining them all once they had rested. They were easier to get the final shape on. 
I turned the oven to 420 instead of 450 and they were perfect at 8 minutes. 
Yummy!

I had been craving soft pretzels and after having success making bread using yeast, I had a lot of confidence so decided to go for this recipe.  I ended up using 4 cups of flour and added 3 TSP of water because the dough was dry, but figured it will all work out.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used coconut oil and used coconut oil to grease the pan.  I ended up putting too much of it and it was everywhere...all over the dough, too.  I made pretzel sticks since that was easier and my dough wasn't really staying put with so much oil on it.  I baked at 400 degrees and 8 minutes was too short.  I probably baked 5 minutes longer and then dipped it in butter and added a little sea salt and it tasted really delicious.

I love baking and do it very often. I was very disappointed with this recipes for several reason. One major reason was that the dough was very very dry even after adding the additional 2TB of water. Im hoping they turn out great or i just wasted my time and money.

These are absolutely some of the best pretzels I have ever had. I made the recipe as stated adding as much flour as I needed to get a good soft dough. The baking soda bath gives them that great bitter pretzel flavor and a chewy texture to the crust. After baking, I dipped each in melted butter and sprinkled with coarse salt. They're also great dipped in butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Next time I will probably make some of each and a sweet cream cheese dipping sauce for the sweet pretzels. I made these for a party and they were a HUGE hit.

Absolutely amazing!! These are the best EVER! The only thing I did differently was to brush them with melted butter right out of the oven as suggested by another reviewer and BAM! They were gobbled up! Thank you so much for this recipe. :)

Tried this for the first time tonight...amazing!  The pretzels taste great and were easy to make.  To cut down on calories, instead of dipping the pretzels in butter after baking, I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar right onto the pretzels and let the flavor bake in...YUM!

I would prefer a little bit sweeter dough, but the effect was there. I don't know if we added a little too much flour, but the dough was tough and difficult to roll out into ropes. Next time I will try a different recipe.

I thought these were good, but not great. I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle, which made this recipe really easy. My main problem, though, is that they were just too sweet. I would use half as much sugar next time, and maybe bread flour for a chewier pretzel.

SO GOOD! I was a little intimadated that I couldn't make these, but it was easier then I thought! They turned out great and the dough is easy to work with, my kids had a blast helping me make the ropes. They tasted just like the ones I love at the mall, in fact my daughter asked for one for breakfast the next day!! THANKS so much for sharing. This one is a keeper!

I made the dough in my bread maker and they came out tasting better than I had hoped.  I had to add 2 tsp of water to the mix to get the dough to form properly given the amount of flour the recipe calls for.  (I was convinced that this was going to be a disaster when the dough wasn't forming.)  Cutting the recipe in half is the perfect amount for snacks for 3-4 people.

4 stars because they are not really buttery at all.  If you brush them with butter after done baking they are buttery.  Good recipe but I only needed 3 to 4 cups flour.  I'll make it  again.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and dipped six of them in cinnamon sugar and six I sprinkled with Kosher salt.   My small children devoured them!  I tasted both varieties and they turned out beautifully soft, golden brown and delicious.  I will stick to this recipe.

I was a bit afraid to make these, because I'd never tried anthing like them.  However, they turned out great!  I would recommend keeping the dough covered with a damp towel while rolling out the pretzel ropes to keep it from drying.

My husband is a firefighter who works 48 hours straight so i like to bring dessert that will  have enough for  most of the other guys to try too. I had to add a little more water but i have to say they turned out DELICIOUS! i was still thinking about them the next day! i made about 30 and not one was left t the end of the night! whats great is that you can make your own "toppings". i made a cinnnamon sugar, butter, and salt. My 1 yr old son loved them too, he ate 2!!! definitely one of my most favorite things to make for dessert!!! or even a snack!

This is the best homemade soft pretzel EVER!!! We made them for a sleepover my daughter had and the kids went crazy for them. We have made them several times and they have always come out great!

All I can say is "Yummmm!"  I made these for a Super Bowl party and they flew off the tray.  I've never made home made pretzels before so was a little worried.  But they came out perfect!  I did use only 4 cups of flour, that's the only thing I did different.  I had mustard and cheese for dipping.

My sister and I made theselast saturday. She makes them often.  I loved them. I would however decrease the temp to 425, and woudl check them after 6 minutes--the one reviewer had a great Idea of putting them on a rack to avoid burnt bottoms. I am definitely going to make these again trying various additions--herbs, cinnamon-sugar, etc..

Excellent! I made these for a party and got rave reviews, even after putting the ingredients in a bread maker (on dough setting) to reduce the amount of work.

These are great! Even better than a store-bought Auntie Anne's baking kit. The only adjustment I made was using 2 cups all-purpose flour and 2.5 cups whole wheat flour. Yum! Thank you for the recipe.

These really tasted amazing.  We live 45 minutes from a pretzel place, I'm pregnant and on a baking spree--I can see these becoming a "gotta have."  
I used only 4 cups of flour and a much cooler oven (slightly over 400) for a few extra minutes. I also only had regular table salt so I used that and with melted butter it was spectacular (though I usually wipe the coarse salt off of my soft pretzels).
I did have trouble getting the dough to roll thin enough, but I think next time I'll just make a few long, thick "snakes" and try making big pretzel sticks.  I'm thinking Superbowl party. Oh yum.

this dough recipe was difficult to work with. It was very dry and crumbly and needed 3 Tbs of water additionally just to come together in a ball. Kneaded with Kitchenaid dough hook for 6 minutes. Still looked lumpy but it was finally smooth. Let it rise for almost 2 hours and it barely doubled in size. Was impossible to roll out into snakes. Too crumbly.

I've never left a review here before but this was one I just had to.  I just finished making these and they are half gone - SO YUMMY!!  I love mall pretzels and these are just as good if not better.  Followed some suggestions and used 3.5 cups of flour and added another 1/2 cup when I was kneading it.  Also I put the oven at 400 and the rack on the top.  I also used 2 packets of active dry yeast which was not exactly 4 tsp but it worked just fine.  Turned out perfect.  I salted most but left some plain.  When they came out I brushed all with melted butter and added more salt to the salty ones and cinnamon and sugar to the others - SO GOOD!!

I've tried different pretzel recipes, this on is the best. I wouldn't change a thing! So soft and chewy, not too sweet, totally awsome recipe. I will be making these again VERY soon.

TOTALLY AWESOME! Thanks for sharing this recipe! I followed everyone's advice in adding more liquid and baking at 425 degrees. The only thing I did differently was that I brushed on the baking soda mixture on both sides instead of dipping it to prevent the pan from pooling from the mixture. Turned out great!!

While its an OK basic recipe, it's  just too sweet. Next time I will greatly reduce the sugar. It tastes more like a bread recipe than pretzels.

These pretzels came out AMAZING! I was worried at first because the dough was so hard to work with, but they came out better than the mall pretzels. I did have to add more water to the mixture, and I baked them at 425 instead of 450. I made 7 large pretzels instead of 12. The great part is I was able to put the uneaten pretzels in the freezer, now we have a quick snack whenever we want!

Decided to make these as is.. mixed in the breadmaker (2lb setting) and thankfully they don't rise much so it worked well. I increased the water to 1 3/8 cups which the recipe suggested (since everyone said it needed more). Used table salt. Oh and I had to lightly wet my fingers when rolling these to make it stick enough to my hands to make into a rope. Worked great! These are very good and hit the spot!

Edited to add: My husband requested these again today.. just a few days after first making them which makes them an official hit. Oh and 7 minutes baking is right for my oven. :)

Next time I make these, I'll shape them longer.  Some parts were cooked uneven.  Let me tell you, overall, this was an awesome recipe!  Fun to make with kids, and you can do any thing with this!  I dipped the tips in chocolate, and added crushed candy canes to top.  Lovely and soooo yummy!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Everyone loved them! i made them into pretzel bites though and when i used the amount of water that the recipe called for, but the yeast didn't rise =/.  They still came out ok, just VERY sweet. The 2nd time i used the the amount of water that the yeast called for and they turned out great! They weren't as good as super pretzels or aunt annies but i'd defiantly make them again!

I was looking for an Aunt Annie's copy cat type recipe and this one caught my eye. Follow directions exactly but used 4 1/2 cups of flour instead of 5 as some reviewers suggested.   If you want the pretzels to be large like Aunt Annie's - cut dough into 6 equal portions to make ropes.  With 12 divisions the pretzels were about 6" pretzels.  Family raved about them.  Going to try freezing and see how they thaw/microwave for quick snacks. thanks for the recipe - Yum....

This recipe went pretty well for me: it was the VERY FIRST time I ever used yeast and I really had no clue what I was doing. Because I was not baking for many people, and because of my lack of confidence in yeast-baking skills, I halved the recipe. It worked out just fine! Had some problems with the yeast rising (even after placing in warm area as instructions said) but I cooked it at 420 and they tasted very good. It is satisfying to have a recipe go well, so thank you so much!

I really enjoyed this recipe, although i agree with the other reviews, I found that the recipe called for too much flour.  I also made the pretzels bigger that the recipe called for, only getting 8 in the batch.

These were absolutely DELICIOUS!  I've made them twice so far, once for a birthday party and they just don't last!  First thing to go, absolutely AMAZING.  One issue with the recipe however is the 5 cups of flour.  I didn't need anywhere CLOSE to that much...even 3 cups of flour was too much.  Still they were absolutely amazing and I cannot wait to make them again.

This was my first attempt at anything at all w/ yeast. The dough was VERY sticky. I cut back on the flour from reading the reviews. They came out okay, but the pretzels were very fat. I did 1/2 with salt and 1/2 with cinnamon/sugar. I had a really hard time rolling them. Next time I think I might try pretzel bites or sticks!

A great, fun and easy recipe. Thought I would give it a try as pretzel rolls are hard to find in bakeries here. This was so easy and tasty that we actually made them 2 days in a row, trying a few different additions and substitutions. I used a dough hook on my stand mixer and let it knead the dough. That worked wonderfully, however I found I needed quite a bit extra water added to get the right bread dough consistency. Instead of adding oil, I melted a tablespoon of unsalted butter. It added a nice, subtle buttery flavor to the finished pretzel. As I was looking for pretzel rolls, I followed this recipe and then shaped the dough into sticks and they came out perfectly, only having to adjust the baking time. The baking time for sticks was nearly double, but worth it. My next try is going to be with rye flour and carroway seeds. Then I might try wrapping the dough around a hot dog before the bath and bake, making pretzel dogs! Whatever the outcome, this is the best recipe I've found. We've got our pretzel rolls for Oktoberfest!

Made them for my grown children and they loved them, especially when they're fresh out of the oven. I'm making the recipe again this morning for my husband, but putting in about 3/4 cup less flour (it was too hard to roll them properly) and adding  some cranberries.  We'll see.

Delicious! I used the trick of putting the dough in the oven with the light on to rise, and it worked great! I will be doing that when I make bread in the future too. I made tiny pretzels (2-3" wide), and the baking time seemed to be perfect for them. When I took them out of the oven, I brushed them with butter. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Awesome. I use less flour and use some of the dough to make pretzel dogs. Just cut up the dough into 12 pieces and instead of rolling the dough, flatten it into a rectangle, then put a hot dog in and wrap it up. Great for lunches. We often top it with butter and  Parmesan cheese for a delicious snack.

I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee, and these turned out AMAZING! I only used 1/4 cup of baking soda in 3 cups of warm water as that was all I had and they browned beautifully. When they came out of the oven I dunked them in melted butter and then coated them in a cinnamon/sugar mixture. I used about 2 cups of white sugar and 1/4 cup of cinnamon and found that to be an excellent balance! Tasted even better then mall pretzels! I will make these again and again!

Sooo good. Taste exactly like the mall ones! I did have to add 5T additional water. They where really fun to make and my kids loved creating their own shapes with the dough. Thanks so much for the recipe_ I will no longer spend big bucks getting my 4 kids the mall ones- they liked these better. And I didn't add the butter after cooking so I felt better about eating them.

I have tried other pretzel recipes and failed miserably. This recipe is incredible! Awesome pretzels, turned out perfect. Shared it with my sister who made them the same day! Definitally a keeper. They were exactly like the ones you spend all that money on, in fact my husband says they are better!

I absolutely love theses pretzels!  The taste  is absolutely delish - they were a big hit for both adults and children.  The dough is extremely stiff, but if you knead the heck out of it, it smooths out (and after the full hour of rising, the dough is a dream to work with).    I brushed some of the pretzels with melted butter when they came out of the oven and then covered them in cinnamon sugar - out of this world!

This was great! So easy and fun to make. I think they are best when you eat them right away. But they were fine the next day too. My 10 year old son and I enjoyed spendingt he time together and making pretzels and other shapes as well. We even made some with cinnamon and sugar on them. Will definately make these again.

Why are these called buttery pretzels when there is no butter involved? lol My daughter and I made these the other day and they were great! We did half salted and the other half cinnamon and sugar. I will use again in the future but will half the baking soda and water solution as I don't think it was necessary to have that much. I'm thinking we may also sub half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat.

I made these last night and the family loved them. The first sheet of pretzels browned alittle to much on the bottem but were still great. I lowered the oven temp to 425 and the second batch was perfect. I did have trouble dipping them without having totally reshape them afterward. I'm not sure how to avoid that.

These are fantastic!! and a must try!  The recipe is perfect and didn't change a thing. With that said, I did follow the comment from another review that suggested after dipping the pretzel in the hot water/baking soda bath to place the pretzel on paper towel to take off the excess water.  Also I did lower my oven temp. to 400F.  At 400F, 8mins in the oven was sufficient.  I found these 2 minor changes helpful, and my pretzel's slide right off the baking sheet.  Will be making these again, and again!!

I just made these for the first time and followed the directions exactly except that I took the advice of others and decreased the oven temp to 425. They turned out great. I didn't have the kosher salt on hand so I just brushed them with butter when they were right out of the oven, then dipped them in cinnamon/sugar. Next time I will use the kosher salt, as I think that would be better. Also, next time I will let them soak a few seconds in the soda solution.

Excellent. Tried a batch (halved the recipe). Did not let it rise long enough. Tried again, much better. Wife prefers them WITHOUT salt on top. I suggest adding some extra gluten to the flour, for chewiness.

very tasty! I don't know what I did wrong at the beginning but i had to put a lot of extra water in the dough. If it wasn't for my stand mixer, I don't think we would have had the pretzels-it was so hard to mix!

These were way too dry. I increased the water by 5 tablespoons and kept wetting my hands as I kneaded to get the dough to what felt like the right consistency. But even after baking them they were too dry, you definitely need a drink next to you when you eat them. Next time I will cute the flour back like the others did.

Pretty good, and a lot more economical than mall pretzels!  It takes some practice to roll them properly, as the dough contracts considerably while baking.  Note: as the recipe stands, these hve no butter flavor.  As per  previous reviewer, I substituted butter for the oil, but the favor was still quite subtle.  Perhaps next time I'll add 2 tbsp, or do a butter wash before baking.

These are great.  My kids love them, my friends love them.  Everyone loves them and keeps asking for more.  And they are easy to make too.  It takes a long time to twist them all so we just do them as logs.

Great Pretzels, but next time I would bake them on a lower temp for longer. It could just be my oven)

I would give these 4 stars because they were really tasty, but nothing like pretzels I've bought. The sough was WAY too sweet for pretzel dough. Next time I will use half the sugar. Also, the dough was really stiff, and took almost 2 hours to raise, and that was in an 86º room. Then, as I rolled them out and shaped them, the dough kept springing back so I had to rest it twice before final shaping. As they baked, they rose so much my family commented they no longer looked like pretzels but more like a knotted roll. Just not what I expected from a "pretzel" recipe, though I will use it for rolls.

YUMMMMM!  These were amazing!  Shaping them was harder than I anticipated, but HOLY COW!  They were SO yummy!  We made some with cinnamon and sugar and others with salt, then buttered!

Better than frozen store bought, but not as good as the "mall's".  Not sure where "buttery" comes in.  We "played" with a couple pretzels...skipped the salt on top and added a little cinnamon and sugar to the dough before rolling and made a cinnamon/powdered sugar dip.  Definitely a "kid fun" recipe that can be tweaked for taste.

This recipe is sooo good. No buts about it. I used butter instead of vegetable oil and it gave it a more warmer taste, if thats the best way to describe it.

I've never made pretzels before so this was my first shot. And let me tell you, most delicious pretzels I've ever eaten! The dough itself is very tasty and the recipe is easy! Highly recommended.

Fantastic! I came into this expecting not a chewy street vendor type pretzel, but a softer one. (In my experience for chewier pretzels you have to immerse them in boiling water. I've done it, and it is not a task I enjoy!) This is one of those recipes where I try it, and then the men in my house are ready for a second batch the next day!

I agree with the others on here, this definitely did not have enough water. Next time I will add the flour to the liquid until the consistency is right. I had to add more oil and about 1 whole cup of water to the recipe( I doubled it) and then it was about right. I also coated them in butter when they were done-pretty good in the end.

I found these pretzels absolutely delicious, and would have given 5 stars but I found it difficult to get the dough to roll out thin enough, so my pretzels were puffier than I would have liked. Will be trying this again!

I've made these twice now, and the kids and husband eat them right up. Instead of making the pretzel shape, I save time by rolling the dough into small balls and making pretzel nuggets. I do add butter after baking like others do. But either way they're wonderful!

These are excellent... but don't make unless you want to eat the entire batch at once... we've done this twice already. I only needed about 4cups of flour, and I used bread flour instead of regular. Yummo.

These are really great! The flavour was almost exactly like the Pretzelmaker! I did use melted butter instead of veg oil since the recipe is called BUTTERY Soft Pretzels. Normally I would give a recipe 5 stars since it was so great, but I did have a bit of a problem with the recipe so it's only a 4 star. I had to add almost 3/4cup of extra water when mixing the dough, it was so dry. The next time I make this, I will start with 4 cups of flour, reserving the last one until I see how the dough is mixing up.

Wow was this good!  I love that look on my husband's face when he is shocked that I actually made something this delicious...and this recipe definitely amazed him.  I had to add quite a bit of water to the dough because it was dry.  If I make this again, I'll have to remember to just add less flour in the beginning.  Very easy to make.  I used parchment paper and butter flavored non-stick spray to make clean-up easier.  After reading other reviews I lowered the cooking temp to 415 degrees for 8 min.  I can't wait to make this for my little brother!

yum, yum, and YUM! I followed it exactly and it tastes soooo good!  I have been baking with the 'mall pretzel' recipe,  but from now on, no doubt! this one is going to be my new pretzel recipe!  Follow as is, and you won't regret it!

These were awesome and just as their name says, they were sooo soft even days after baking them! I loved putting a garlic powder sprinkling on them.  I will next try mixing some of the dough with feta cheese. I love cheeses. I saved this recipe...its a keeper.

These are great but a bit of work to roll out ;o)  Next time I'll just do pretzel nuggets to save myself some work.  I used all of the flour called for with 1 cup being WW the rest being white.  It didn't make a difference to the taste nor texture. After cooking we sprayed with ICBINB and topped with cin/sugar.  Then dipped in apple cider syrup we had on hand from pancakes.  Yummy!

These were really very good. This is the second time I've made them. Both time I followed other reviewers advice and used less flour and about 1TBS of extra water in order to get it to combine.  These taste great with Kosher salt, but are really good with sugar and cinnamon.

Great recipe! I did decrease the flour to 4 cups per other reviewers. I have been making my own bread for years, and the second time I made these I made a mistake with the yeast/sugar/water mixture. I usually will put the water and sugar in the bowl first and then add the yeast. For some reason, that time I put the yeast/sugar in the bowl first and then added the water. When I went to put the wet mixture into the dry after the ten minutes, there was undissolved yeast in the bottom of the bowl. So, always make sure you add the yeast LAST! It didn't seem to make a difference in this recipe, but it may in other bread recipes. Thanks for sharing- the pretzels are a huge hit in my house!

Recipe was easy to follow - and pretzels are tasty.  I used soy flour and will probably do again with just regular all purpose flour.  I did make them half the size that the recipe called for, so I had 24 which made sharing easier!

These were amazing! I used 4 1/2 cups of flour and found it was hard to work the dough. I will just use my traditional bread method next time. So I thought I had totally ruined the dough but decided to keep going instead of just throwing it away - I'm so glad I did! They were delicious and there were none left this morning. I dipped them in melted butter and then cinnamon and sugar. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

These are incredible!  They are easier to make than I anticipated, and they taste fabulous.  I made two batches.  I mixed the first batch by hand, and the second in the bread machine.  I thought the second batch turned out better because it was smoother.  This is also a great recipe to have the kids help you with.  If they can make a "snake" out of play dough, they can help you make these.

Awesome recipe!  Loved these!  Best eaten right out of the oven, not quite the same the next day.  I didn't realize it at the time, but I used non-bleached flour and it took a lot more water to get the dough where it needed to be consistency wise.  These were amazing and I know I will make them again...  and again.... and again!!!

Fantastic recipe. I reduced the flour by 1/2 a cup.  I divided the dough into 8 balls and rolled them out into six pretzels.  The remaining two balls I seperated and rolled out into ropes for pretzels, dunked in the bath, and the wrapped them around precooked hot dogs.  They were amazing!  I also dipped them all in butter post baking and sprinkled with margarita salt (it's all I had onhand). These would be good with raisins and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.

These were a HUGE hit! My kids had a blast helping me make them. The key is to definitely roll them out super skinny (like your pinky width) It looks too skinny, but they puff up when they bake. I reduced baking temp to 415 degrees, and that seemed perfect.  I have found that the amount of flour you need, depends on where you live and what kind of flour you are using. I had to use more than what the recipe called for to have the dough not be sticky. So, start with 4 cups and then adjust from there.  I only wish they browned better. I will try an egg wash as another user sugg. next time.  Can't wait to make them again.

AMAZING! I made 1/4 of the recipe because I wasn't sure how they would turn out...now that my bf and I have eaten all 4 of the pretzels I wish I'd made the whole recipe!!! I didn't have sea salt to put on top which is really what they need...but as my bf put it: these are soft, salty, sweet and sour! EDIT: I made these again tonight and have concluded that they are addictive! Plus I made a few into Pretzel dogs, as I saw in another reviewers picture....just roll out the dough as if you were making a pretzel but instead wrap it around a cooked hot dog and bake as usual -Delicious! I have a feeling my future children will be a hit at school with those in their lunches

I've made this many times after my first review-tweaking here and there.  One reviewer said to add the flour to the water which I agree is much easier to control.  Still bland...I think it's a good start but could be better.

i halved the recipe and made it according to these directions exactly and found that my dough was incredibly elastic, i dont have a bread machine or anything like that.  I couldn't even roll out the dough to make a pretzel shape, any suggestions?

These were just ok. I think my results were skewed because I used whole wheat flour as it was what I had on hand. I will definitely try this recipe again with white flour.

OMG, these definitely fulfilled my hot pretzel craving. The only thing different was that I ended up only needing 4.5 cups of flour. Initially mixed it was a hand mixer, then kneaded it afterwards with my hands.   Baked it at 400F on the top rack on parchment paper so that I didn't have to grease the baking sheet and less clean up.

These DO taste like the mall pretzels!  I followed another reviewer's advice and ignored mixing the dry and wet ingredients separately. I first mixed the wet (plus salt and sugar) with the yeast, then after it "proofed" added as much flour as necessary. It was almost 5 cups. Also, you don't need 4 cups water and 1/2 a cup baking soda for the bath!! WAY too much, you can easily halve that and have lots left over.  Other than that, perfect, easy, and tasty. My husband told me that he didn't really like pretzels, but I had him eat a bite and his reaction was basically he was blown away, melting practically. He just ate another one! I might have to hide a few for myself. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these with honey instead of sugar - omg!  Talk about INCREDIBLE.  I used sugar to dissolve the yeast, and then substituted the rest of the sugar in the recipe with honey.  They came out of the oven so chewy and moist - I'm positive it was thanks to the honey.  They were so good we had to give a bunch away to the neighbors to keep ourselves from eating the whole batch.  Everyone was raving about them (number one reaction was "these are just like Auntie Anne's - no, better!").  Truly amazing.  I'm making a double batch tonight to bring tailgating tomorrow.  Oh, and whip up some heavy cream with powdered sugar to drizzle over these....divine.

This are terrific. I did not do the baking soda wash, but after forming the dough I placed them on the baking sheet and lightly coated them with butter and kosher salt.

I LOVE these pretzels.  Almost to the point where's it's kinda sad.  I've nearly stopped baking other breads in favor of making these pretzels, because they're just absolutely delicious with honey mustard sauce (and by themselves).  As breads go, they're not difficult to make, and biting into a warm, buttery pretzel is quite a pick-me-up when I'm feeling down.  :)  I DO typically cut the sugar in half, as I'm more of a non-sweet pretzel fan, but I've tried it the other way, and the sweetness is not overpowering.  Five stars.

OMG! My pre-K/K class made these with me the other day and even dense and ugly (the pretzels), they tasted fabulous! The entire staff asked for the recipe and I had to run a few out of the room as they were trying yo sneak in and make off with another hunk. Thank you so much for sharing!

I have a pretzel recipe I usually use, but decided to try this one.  I changed the recipe a little based on other reviews and what I had on hand:    I swapped out 1 cup of flour for whole wheat flour, and didn't use the whole 5 cups - more likely 4-ish (just enough so dough wasn't sticky).  I used only one packet yeast (2 1/4 tsp) and substituted a melted butter/margarine blend for the vegetable oil.  These have good flavor and are soft/tender.  My other recipe turns out chewier with a harder crust, which I tend to prefer, but these are great if you like a really soft pretzel!  Also, I've found that if you're not concerned about having these look like pretzels, it's easier to divide the dough into 24 pieces and make pretzel 'sticks'.     Either way, make sure to stick parchment or waxed paper on top of your baking sheet - the baking soda wash baked onto metal is a pain to get off.

5 cups flour is too much, but otherwise, I did everything else as noted and it was great. Well, actually, I used 2 cups water with 2 Tbsp soda in an 8x8 pan for dipping. I don't like throwing away so much solution. The first batch was gone faster than I could butter and top. I used cinnamon/ sugar and onion/garlic. I'm going to try jalapino next. I do bake at 450 for 8 on the top rack. Bottoms and tops are nicely brown.

These are excellent. I mixed all the ingredients in my bread maker, and then followed the recipe from there. When rolling the dough out, I hold it between my hands and let gravity help. Thank you Christa for an awesome recipe!!

These are the best pretzels I have ever had.  Me and my friends decided to make them, and it was a super easy recipe.  We suggest only using 4 cups of all-purpose flour instead of 5 and it worsd out perfectly.  They were so delicious! We put a cinnamon sugar combo on some of them and salt on others, and garlic salt on one.  This recipe is a keeper!!!!  These taste just like a mall pretzel!

I just took these out of the oven and they are pretty good. I've always wanted to bake with yeast and this is the first recipe I've used that asks for it. I did brush the pretzels with melted butter after they were taken from the oven to give them an "Aunt Annies" taste and look. I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have one word to describe these pretzels: HEAVEN.  These were a huge hit at my Oktoberfest party and I am definitely keeping this recipe forever. They were not difficult to make at all and I had no problems getting them rolled into long ropes and shaped into pretzels.  My tips are:  (1) I found that dipping them in the water/soda solution when they were a long rope was much easier than forming them first and then dipping them.  (2) Definitely blot on a paper towel briefly after dipping them in the water so the water solution doesn't puddle on the baking sheet. (3) You can easily make them the night before you need them. Just skip putting salt on them, bake them off, cool and store them in an airtight container. When you are ready to serve, take a basting brush and brush a small amount of water on them, sprinkle with salt and bake at 300 degrees for 10 minutes.  They were perfectly crispy and tasted like I had just made them. Divine!!

These taste just like Auntie Anne's pretzels!  I didn't have the patience to roll the pretzel shapes, so I just did sticks instead.  They were amazing!

I've never been one to have good luck or even make attempts to try things with yeast.  However, I love Auntie Anne's pretzels, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Being a novice, these turned out fantastic!  They were a little fat, but that could be due to the fact that I've never rolled out a pretzel in my life!  I did brush some melted butter on them after trying one without.  The kids loved them and I'd love to try them again and perfect my rolling out technique a little more!

i'm updating my review (which i posted yesterday). i was able to finally get the consistency and texture of the dough correct (2nd try). but i used 2 cups wheat flour and 2 cups white flour as well as replacing white sugar with brown sugar (this combo was suggest by other users). bad mistake. don't mess with the recipe! don't know how the brown sugar affects taste, but adding the wheat flour was a problem. my pretzels made with all white flour and white sugar tasted like they came from the mall. the ones with wheat flour taste like a wheat dinner bun. i love wheat bread and all, but this is supposed to be a pretzel. so stick with the recipe (using only 4 cups of flour, not 5). good luck!

I had difficulty making them according to the directions so during the second attempt I made them the way I usually make breads.  They did turn out delicious (both times) and everyone that tasted them said they were great.

I made half with the baking soda rinse & half without.  The rinse makes them brown and shine much nicer. For me it is worth the extra step. I lowered the temp a bit and baked them longer.  Still came out well. After baking I brushed melted butter on.  Very good.

Wow, this dough tasted JUST like the ones my parents used to buy from the mall - absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!  The only change I made, and it was entirely necessary, was adding more water.  Almost a cup more than is stated in the recipe.  The pretzels ended up a little bit too hard, so next time I will use even more water and let them rise longer.   Yum!

These are freakin amazing!! I made them for a party and they were gone in seconds. Everyone asked for the recipe. Only thing I did was add a few squirts of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" to each one before I put the salt on and baked 'em.  I will make these again...and again...and again! Thanks for the recipe Christa!

This was so delicious. I accidentally forgot to add the oil to the dough, but the pretzels turned out great anyway. As suggested by many reviewers, I brushed the baked pretzels with salted butter after they came out of the oven. I made a variety - plain, garlic and honey. All were excellent. The baking soda bath makes the final product nice and brown. Great for football games!!

My first try at making pretzels. Success! This recipe is terrific. I used only 4-1/2 cups of flour. It made very pliable dough which was easy to roll out on a clean, unfloured surface. I didn't roll my dough pieces long and thin enough before shaping the pretzels so they came out chubby-my bad!  After their soda bath half of them got salted and half got cinnamon sugar. They had plenty of buttery delicious flavor without further addition of butter. I'll make again and again!

For my first time making pretzels, this recipe was awesome! I did find it hard to roll out the dough, but had a spritzer bottle of water and used that when rolling and it helped out a lot. Thanks for the great recipe. Will be making this again.

Pretzels were dinner roll sized the first time. Recipe is sweet, but does not require all the sugar to rise or brown. Did a longer/higher rise the second time and made a few more from the recipe, the rose in the oven slightly after the rolled rise.

These were awesome. However, I decreased the flour to 4 cups and still used about an extra 1/4 cup of water. If you make this into 12 pretzels, they come out tiny. If you want the same size pretzels that you buy at the mall you really only get 5 or 6 out of this recipe. I also subbed melted smart balance buttery spread with olive oil for all the oil in the recipe to save a few calories. I decreased the temp to 425 and increased the time to 10 minutes. These aren't just like Auntie Annie's pretzels at the mall but they are close and really good.

Just finished making these. I think they're ok, not as good as a philly soft pretzel though. I too add about 4 extra tablespoons of water cause I thought it was a little dry. Probably will make again

This is a great pretzel recipe.  I substituted whole wheat flour and they turned out fantastic!  Very soft and have wonderful flavor.  I think next time I will add a little bit of honey.

These were so great! they tasted so real with the kosher salt on them! the only thing i did end up doing was adding some water to the dough while i was mixing the yeast mixture and oil into it. Also, my dough never really doubled in size it kind of stayed the same size after i waited a few hours for it to rise... but when i finally decided to just forget about the rising issue and shape them, the dough didn't stretch and work as well as i thought it would... but then after i worked at it a little while it was fine. although it sounds like alot went wrong they tasted sooooo good when they were done my family LOVED them!!

This recipe is awesome. Having only baked bread one time before I was a bit weary, but it was very simple and they are so yummy! I followed the recipe only changing the temperature to 400 degrees for 8 minutes.  I am definitley going to make these again.

I am a sucker for the pretzels at the mall and always have to get one when I am there.  I have moved out to the country and don't get out as often as I used to.  When I saw this recipe on the home page I had to try it.  I  cut the recipe in half and made the dough in my breadmaker.  I would have had plenty of room for a full recipe but I am the only one in the house who eats soft pretzels.  When the dough cycle finished I rolled out the dough to approximately 3/4 - 1 inch thickness and cut it into strips to make pretzel sticks.  I dipped them in solution and let them drip dry on a rack before salting them lightly and baking them for 7 minutes.  When they got out of the oven I brushed a tablespoon of melted butter over the tops of the sticks.  These were just as good if not better than mall pretzels!  This recipe is a keeper!  I can't wait until my little girl gets older and I can make her all these great goodies I am finding on allrecipes.com!

I love, love, LOVE this recipe! I've made it twice. The first time was a practice run, it took a while to perfect the pretzel shape. Second time they were BEAUTIFUL! I made four different flavors...plain, cinnamon, ranch, and Parmesan & garlic. Instead of rolling the dough into ropes, I left it flat after rolling it out. I then brushed butter on the surface and topped with cinnamon, powdered ranch dip mix, or powdered garlic and dry Parmesan cheese. I twisted the dough with the flavor on the inside and then shaped into pretzels. It's a good idea to use separate bowls to dip the dough in because some of the flavor will end up in the water...cinnamon and garlic might not taste that great. ;) I will definitely make these again, and already have requests piling up.

These pretzels are really delicious! I have to make these again soon to try and figure out what I did, because it was almost impossible for me to roll the dough into a rope. This was my first time making pretzels, so I'm not too sure what to expect. Also I had a problem with the bottoms turning really dark, almost burned. I should have gathered some tips from other reviewers, which I will for next time. I brushed some with melted butter right out of the oven while hot, and coated in a cinnamon sugar, they were fabulous! Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely try these again, hopefully have better luck (:

These pretzels are a crowd favorite among my group of friends. Whenever we have gatherings, I am responsible for bringing the pretzels. Even my friends who are professional chefs love this recipe! They match or beat any pretzel that you would find in the mid-Atlantic region. They are very easy and fun to make! I use the baking soda mixture and sprinkle kosher salt on them before baking. I don't worry about them getting stale - they are gone before that could happen. The only downfall is that fresh bread goes bad quickly in the south because of the humidity....to no fault of the pretzel!

This recipe was so easy and amazingly good.  I cut the recipe in half as a test batch and used kosher salt in the recipe. I used coarse sea salt on top. My oven runs hot so I watched them carefully during baking time so they would not burn.  I used parchment paper to line the baking sheets and I recommend using parchment paper in all bread baking projects because it does prevent burning and sticking on the bottoms.  I will definitely make these again and try various toppings and shapes just for the fun of it. 4 and a half stars!

I thought these were really good. I've made them twice so far, in 4 days and well, here is my suggestions.    Do not add all the flour. I did that the first time and came out with tough dough. I only added 4 cups and only needed a little more while kneading it. I also did not need any while rolling out the ropes. I made small pretzels and came out with about 20 or so. I let the dough rise for more than an hour and it was perfect dough. They are best if used the same day. This sure is a keeper! Thanks.

My husband and sons ate these right up.  I had no problem with the recipe.  The only issue I had was I just could not get them into a proper pretzel shape.  That was my own doing.  I ended up making pretzel sticks.  I will be making these again and again.

These ended up really great, but I wish I'd read reviews before I started them. I prepared them exactly as the recipe states, but next time I'm adding the flour in last and not all at once, because it was definintely too much flour, and it wasn't very smooth at all. I think adding the flour at the end would make it more smooth. But it did end up working out, just really hard to knead, and took a lot longer to rise as well. Tasted great though, and when my husband and I finished them all, I wished I had made the whole batch and not just half a batch. Oh, we did boil the water before dunking the pretzels in, everything I've heard about pretzels before says that's the way to do it. I also used olive oil rather than veggie oil, presonal prefrence. Anyway, thanks for the recipe, though I am going to tweak it next time I make it.

I absolutely LOVED these pretzels. 5 cups of flour is way too much, use 4 cups to get it right. I tested half the batch with the baking soda water solution and the other half with brushing egg whites on the tops and the baking soda solution won by far. This is a keeper!

These had a great texture and I will make these again. With that said, these were awfully sweet. I will be cutting the sugar down the next time I make them.

These completely fixed my mall-pretzel craving.  They tasted exactly the same.  The only things I changed in the recipe were to add the flour last so that I could get the right consistency for the dough, and to use a little less sugar in the dough.  I ended up using 4 1/2 cups flour and 1/3 cup sugar for the dough. I skipped adding the coarse salt on a few pretzels, then when they were done I brushed them with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar for the kids.  They were a huge hit.

These are very good.  To speed up the doubling time, I sat the dough on the counter over the dishwasher when i ran a load through.  The extra heat worked like a charm.  I also patted the dough out into a huge rectangle so that I could cut the 12 pieces into long strips.  This made rolling them very easy and made all uniform in size.

I had been craving a Parmesan mall pretzels since my friends had introduced them to me a few days ago. I made 9 pretzels and covered them with butter and Parmesan, they were much better than the mall pretzels and I can't wait to make them again for my friends.

This was a fun project.  I made half salty and half with cinnamon sugar.  Way too much sweetness in the salty ones, but the neighbor kids LOVED the cinnamon ones.  I'll review this again after I perfect my technique.

We were confused at first as to why the baking soda water, but to our surprise it was for a good reason, Man did they brown nice and they cooked way faster then the batch that was not dipped. These are pretty simple and very delicious, not a very big batch so it would be a good idea to double them as they are so good they do not last long.  We made the salt kind, a cinamin sugar one and garlic salt.

I followed the recipe exatly and I had trouble, it was VERY dry and I ended up adding about 5 T. water. Also they were easier to roll out on a NON floured surface. And the baking time needs to be longer at a slightly lower temp. Like 12-15 min at 400...or else the insides will be soggy/doughy and you'll have to bake longer anyway. The end result was NOT anything like the Mall Pretzels. I was disappointed. I'll have to try another pretzel recipe another day.

These were excellent! I would recommend using a silpat liner when baking these pretzels. If you don't have one, then make sure to grease the pan and decrease the oven temperature (to 425F or so.).  When they are done, I brush melted butter on the warm pretzels and eat with mustard. Delicious!

These were pretty good.  I had to add extra water and they still didnt roll as thin as I would have liked to make good pretzles so they didnt cook through well.  I think I will add a bit more water next time and let it rise a bit longer.

This was my first time making pretzels, and these were great! I want to find a nice sauce to serve them with, but I can't seem to find one that sounds right (description and ingredients have to make me salivate or I won't even bother trying to make it ;) ). I think I will just buy some nacho cheese sauce for the next time I decide to make these. Excellent recipe! Thank you.

So good!! These taste just like Auntie Anne's pretzels!  I used 4 cups of all-purpose flour and a little extra water for moisture.  Right when they come out of the oven I dip them in butter and sprinkle again with kosher salt.  This recipe is a keeper!
Just a little tip: sometimes when I have trouble getting the dough to rise I heat the oven for a minute or two just until warm and then turn it off and put the bowl with covered dough in and leave the door closed.  Works everytime.

Amazing!  I used a Breadman machine.  2 lb. Dough only setting.  I had to add a little extra water (maybe 1/3 C extra), and push down the dough during the first knead cycle.  

Turned out wonderful.

I made two batch's of these, one in my bread machine, and the other by hand. They both came out great. Just needed to add 5 TBLS. of water to the bread machine one and 2 TBLS of water to the by hand one. Good recipe.

Yum!  These are so good!  I opted not to add the salt to the top.  As soon as they popped out of the oven, I ran chunk of butter over each one to give it a butter glaze, then sprinkled with cinnimon and sugar.  This tasted a lot like fried bread. I made the dough in my bread machine.  I only made a half-batch, and now that the pretzles are all gone, I wish I'd made more.  I only made half the water-soda dip, and I think that it would have been enough do make a full batch of pretzles - I put the water in a square baking dish which made the dipping process very easy.

Excellent recipe. Tasted very much like the mall type.  Be sure and brush melted butter on them when they come out of the oven.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are so good. Just like Auntie Anne's. Only change is cut flour to 4 cups. Let dough double in size and then form 12 pretzels. Bake 400 degrees in convection oven and brush with melted butter. Salt 6 and the other 6 cinnamon sugar. Oh, so Yummy!

I just pulled my first batch out of the oven! YUMM-O! There were a couple of things I wish I'd have paid more attention to. First, my dough didn't double...not even close. I'm sure I either have old yeast or I killed it with water that was too hot...but I went ahead and used it anyway. Second, while I *meant* to cut the dough into 12, I blanked for a bit and cut it into 8 instead. No biggie. The baking soda/water worked great. Into the oven. I baked at 400 for 10 minutes and I'm glad I did! The bottoms are over-brown and the tops got brown really really fast. I wish I could have left them in the oven another minute or two, but the bottoms would have been black! The flavor, however, is SO GOOD! Really dense (that's why I wish I could have baked them longer). Next time, I may lower the oven temperature even further, and bake them on parchment. I'm pretty sure that soda/water reacts with the metal and that doesn't help the bottoms one bit! BUT I'd make these again in a heartbeat! The flavor is great, they look great, and they're such a great snack! Thanks for the recipe!!

While these pretzels are good, I must be blind because I don't see any BUTTER listed on the ingredients list.  I'm going to try this recipe again, but with some reviewers' suggestions for changes...like spraying or brushing the pretzels with butter after removing them from the oven.  I'm looking forward to it!

Bumped this down to 4c flour, I used half whole-wheat. Pretty tasty, but I wanted something REALLY buttery like those ones in the mall, though I suppose they just bathe them in butter!
I made parmesan cheese, cinnamon sugar, and regular kosher salt pretzels. 
Great dipped in spicy brown horseradish mustard!

I have tried other recipes in the past for pretzels and these really are the BEST I have found! My husband even liked them and he isn't a big fan of breads/rolls or anything made from them. I cut the recipe and only made 4, and I brushed them with butter. Should have tried cinnamon and sugar... next time :)

Tried this recipe with my basic cooking class and it didn't disappoint. 
They all loved the finished product even when they cut the amount of baking soda in half.
Some students even decided to use it as pizza crust.

Wow! These are awesome. I started with 4 cups of flour and added as I needed. I needed about 1/2 cup more water than called for. I made mine in the bread maker on Dough Cycle and it saved me most of the mixing and the kneading. I also basted melted butter on right out of the oven, and put cinnamon and sugar on some as well.

These are o yummy! I am a novice baker and even I couldn't mess these up!

What an awesome discovery!  They turned out perfectly.  I did have to add about 1/2 cup of water to the dough, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The kids loved to make the "snakes" and I twisted them into pretzel shapes.  I baked them up on parchment paper so they wouldn't stick.  Great recipe!

These were almost the best pretels I've ever had, with the exception of Philly pretzels. They had a wonderful taste. My only problem was that I couldn't seem to get the dough to stretch enough to make long rolls, so the finished product came out really fat! Oh, well! They were still awesome and I'll use this recipe again next Oktoberfest.

This will be the only bread recipe I will use. I have tried it with all purpose flour, whole wheat and now with pastry flour. I really liked the pastry flour batch as the crumb was finer. I have also experimented with adding a bit more oil to keep them from drying out the next day. It also works well.The soda mixture is a must. I have brushed some with butter/cinnamon/brown sugar and the other half i rolled them in some coco powder. Everyones gotta try this recipe at least once!!

This recipe was great!!  I used my bread machine dough cycle.  I did add a little more water (2-3 T) as it was kneeding because my machine seemed to be bogging down.  After the cycle just turned them on a floured board and cut into 12 pieces and rolled out, dipped in the soda water and baked.  They were great the next morning too.  Just put them in the oven on 350 for 10 min.  Dipped in honey mustard.  

This recipe is defiantly a keeper!!!

These are delicious!  I took a suggestion from another reviewer and only added 4 cups of flour.  They turned out nicely.  The pretzels should look a little mini before cooking b/c they do puff up!  Also, they are hard as bricks the next day, so enjoy them while they're hot.

I have never made pretzels before.  These were easy and fun to make.  I can see where you can easily make a lot of variations to this basic recipe.  The pretzels come out a little sweet, but the flavor is very good.

It was by far one of the greatest recipes for soft pretzels I have ever made. the result was heavy, and very satisfying pretzels, even my drywall guy agreed they were great.
Improvements could be made in the Baking soda mixture. It was good, but I figured less baking soda, and add alot of salt so it was salted on the outside too, and then immediately after it comes out of the oven, it was absolutely delicous to lightly "paint" it with melted butter using a brush.

I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU MAKE THESE TERRIFIC PRETZELS

I read through most of the reviews before making these and although these were good I followed other reviews and changed a few things. I used 4 cups of flour, just a tsp. sugar dissolved in the yeast and brushed with butter before cooking.They were good soft pretzels but in my opinion not even close to the mall.

these pretzels are the most amazing thing ever! they were gobbled up almost immediately. i did follow some suggestions of other reviewers in not using the full amount of flour, probably only used about 4.5 cups of flour instead of the full 5. and i also substituted the oil with melted butter. i put salt on 6 and cinnamon sugar on the other 6. the cinnamon sugar ones are fabulous for breakfast!

Great flavor!  I used our bread machine to make these.  Everything turned out except they were really hard to roll out into a pretzel shape.  These were good, but I would have reduced the amount of sugar used.  I think these will be a main staple.

Thank you!

This a recipe I am definately keeping on file.  I love sweet and salty, and this is yet another great recipe to indulge that craving!  I served them with cheese sauce at a family game of Texas Hold 'Em and all 12 were GONE in an hour.  They were very easy.  The only change I made, due to the urging of other reviewers, was that I cut the flour down to 4.5 cups.  I did the dough in the bread machine which made it even easier.  I did the water/yeast/sugar step first right in the bread machine pan, then added the rest of the wet ingredients, then the dry.  When the dough cycle was done, it was perfect...non-sticky dough that I barely had to flour my surface at all to work with.  I was skeptical of the baking soda dip, because I have always seen them done with an egg wash...but it was so good, made the outsides nice and brown and "cracked" like real pretzels.  Sprinkled on some sea salt and baked them on a parchment lined pan and they were perfect!  Soft, chewy, and a little bit sweet...YUM!

These are good, but rather sweet. I put garlic butter on mine, and I think it would have been better without the sugar added. These remind me more of breadsticks than pretzels.

These are exceptional! Used only 4 cups of flour as in other reviews. Made a batch of smoked sausage cheese dogs using the rope sections to spiral around each 4" piece of sausage. Excellent!

These were VERY good and I highly recommend them. But, I am giving them 4/5 stars because 5 cups is way too much flour-- if you use that you will keep having to add water to the dough because its too dry. I tried the recipe as-is, but I would say to definitely follow the  recommendations to use only 4 cups. Also, for me, 8 mins. baking was about 1 minute too long, because the bottoms burned a little. I did a few with regular salt, and a few brushed with butter and a cinnamon/sugar mixture. Thanks for the recipe, with those small changes, its a 10 star recipe!!!

So easy to make (although perhaps slightly time consuming when it comes to twisting the dough), and delicious!

Very good recipe!  I've made it with 4 cups of bread flour and 3 tsp of yeast; 5 cups of regular flour, 4 tsp yeast and 1 tsp gluten; 4 cups bread flour and 4 tsp yeast.  It all works.  I use a BREAD MACHINE and add the water, flour, yeast, salt and the little amount of sugar called for.  After it is mixed I add the sugar in and add flour to the mixture to to right consistency.  Baked up great every time!

These were great! They turned out way better than I expected! I'm not very advanced in baking, but these were easy and turned out perfectly :D  I find them DELICIOUS with a spicy jalapeno white cheese dip.. Mmm :D  I used butter instead of oil as well, and brushed them with butter after they came out. I didn't salt them and they were AWESOME! Thanks for the recipe!!

The texture of these are really good. The only thing is, I found these a little too sweet. I will definitely make again but with 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup. Good with garlic powder and parmesan cheese too!

These came out great. I only needed half the amount of baking soda solution. I mixed sugar and cinnamon together in the coffee grinder, which made the sugar finer and mixed the two more completely. I painted on melted butter and dipped the pretzels in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. The effect was on par with "professional" pretzels. Good stuff:)

As did many reviewers, I too reduced the flour to 4 cups, using 1/2 cup whole wheat and 3-1/2 cups all purpose. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, which worked out great. I made these into crab pretzels (soft pretzels topped with crab dip) using the "Spicy Maryland Crab Dip" recipe, also from this site. Fantastic!

We loved this recipe. I melted butter and spread it on the pretzels then I put them one at a time in a zip-lock bag that had cinnamon sugar in it. The result tasted like Auntie Anne's cinnamon sugar pretzels!

Very good!  I didn't have kosher salt around so I used "semi-coarse" sea salt and it was excellent.  Brushed some with garlic butter which I adored.

I read the other reviews first so I knew to add a little less flour.I also followed the advice to lower the oven temp a bit because my oven runs hot. I baked them at 400.
 The dough came out just fine, not dry and tasted very good. It did puff up a little more than I would expect for pretzels but I kinda eye balled the yeast so perhaps I put in a touch too much. The flavor was nice and the dough was the perfect soft type pretzel consistency and texture. I also made great bread sticks with it!

I found that these were rather bland, with an overly dense texture.  I probably won't make them again.

I rated 3 stars based on following the recipe exactly.  My second time doing this I would give a 4 and maybe I can perfect it better next time.  I think 5 cups of flour is way too much.  I used 4 and even needed to add more water to that.  400 degrees worked perfectly for me vs. 450. I wish that the recipe also stated in which legth of ropes to roll this out to.  Next time I will roll out much longer than the 12-15 inches that I did.  I'll try again.  TY

YUM! I would have never thought I could make pretzels this delicious at home! I followed the recipe exactly and had great results. After baking we topped a few with melted butter and cinnamon sugar. These disappeared quickly!

I should have read the reviews again because I forgot to refresh my memory.  As a result the dough was very dry and I had to add quite a few more tbs. of water in order to be able to get it to incorporate and form into a ball.  I also let it rise for about 1 1/2 hrs. because the first time I checked it hadn't doubled in size yet.  When they came out I was amazed at how wonderful they are.  A keeper for sure and will make it again several times over!  Thank you Christa!

These were really good, especially brushed with butter and sprinkled with cinnaom and sugar. The only way I could get the dough to stretch out long enough to make good pretzel shapes was to roll it into a short little rope on the counter and then hold one end and spin it around, kind of like a lasso--my husband got a big kick out of that, especially when a chunk of dough broke off the end of the rope went flying into the ceiling!

Although the pretzels didn't taste like the mall's pretzels, they were easy and fun to make with my 7 yr old.  I found the dough was easy to work with by hand. I was curious as to what exactly the baking soda solution was for so i left one pretzel "undipped".....and that 1 did not turn brown like the others. It was white....but still tasty.  I would make these again...but there's just something missing....can't put my finger on it!!!

These pretzels are "schmeckt-delicious!"  It was a simple recipe and even though my pretzels didn't look like the perfect ones in the photo (my 3 and 5 year olds were helping:), they tasted great!  My kids scarfed them down and can't wait to make them again.
But do cook them on the top rack, otherwise the bottoms get too brown.

i'd give this recipe 5 stars but i found it difficult to roll into sticks prior to forming the pretzel shape- does anyone have a solution to this?  the dough was almost too smooth.  otherwise, the taste was superb as well as the texture.  my husband who is the world's pickiest eater bar none, really liked them!

These taste delicious-like perfect preztels from the mall--mine just rose too much or I didn't make the ropes thing enough and they look like pretzel tumors.  Oh well--everyone ate them happily anyway.

Great recipe!  Only used half the salt, sugar and soda it called for and they were great!  I did a short second rise and egg wash. Brushed them with melted butter when done and they were delicious.  Who has any left for a second day?  :)  Thanks for sharing.

The flavor of these pretzels was absolutely PHENOMENAL!  The slightly sweet, soft, chewy pretzel foiled by the crunchy kosher salt on top was perfection!  Forget about expensive mall pretzels--spend a lazy afternoon making these yourself and avoiding the crowds!

These were great.  I cut back on the sugar, but that's just my personal preference.  I used lots of different toppings such as oats, garlic salt, onion powder, parmesan cheese, etc.  I'm going to make these again!

The kids give this a 5 stars, but my husband and I rate it a 4. I felt the yeast flavor was overpowering. But overall it was a good soft pretzel. I  just want to prefect it a little.

These were amazing! Like many of the other revewers, I did end up using on 4 cups of flour, but other than that I followed the recipe step for step. The pretzels turn out big and soft, with a slight crisp crust. Just wonderful!

Love this recipe! I've made it many times now, each time they came out perfect. The dough also makes delicious pretzel dogs when wrapped around smoked sausages... yum! :D
(I do add a small amount of extra water, though not at the beginning. The amount varies with the humidity.)

Amazing, since pretzels are not so comon in Mexico, I made a batch for my friends.  They simply ate them up with much gusto, and asked for more.  Most excellent!!!

In Pennsylvania they serve Pretzel sandwiches at restuarants.  I made this recipe when I got home for some sandwiches and everybody thought it was great!

these were really good and fun to make, but the bottoms did burn, even with my baking sheet far from the heat. maybe next time i will cook at 400, for a bit longer? we double coated in butter (before and during cooking) and sprinkled on salt each time. we'll do this again.

My 9 year old stepdaughter and I made these last night, and they turned out great!  We cut down on the flour a little and added a little extra water, and the dough turned out great, she thought kneading it was fun.  The pretzels come out super soft.  Great recipe!

This is THE Pretzel that I have been looking for. It helps to have a Kitchen- aid. The only adjustment I made was when I started mixing the wet to the dry, I found it needed a little more water ( 1-2 Tablespoons). This is a true winner. The whole family loved them!!

I'm giving this recipe a four b/c if I had not cut the salt by over 1/2 as rec. by other reviewers, it would have been too salty.  Also, keep an eye on them while cooking so the top/bottom doesn't burn.  I took mine out a couple minutes early and they were perfect.  But with the variations, the prezels were very good. My husband who said he 'wasn't a pretzel guy' ended up eating two!  We dipped them in a cream cheese/cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Yum!  One other hint: If you have a mixer, use it with the dough attachment instead of doing it by hand. Saves a lot of time!

It was just ok! The pretzel was more of a bread my family and I said. My yeast might have not been good. It took longer to cook than I thought. In my opinion it taster NOTHING like mall bought pretzels. Maybe i'll just stick with auntie annes. Overrall though, i sprinkled some with parmasean cheese, cinnomon with butter(tasted just like a homemade cinnomon bun)&& just regular salt. Pretty good.

These were very good - and quicker than most things with yeast since they didn't have to rise twice.  The dough was a bit more dense than I expected, but good once cooked.  We did cinnamon & sugar, glaze, cheese sauce, and caramelized onions (baked in).

these were okay... if we make them again they'll need some changes though. i should have read the reviews first. i definitely should have added more water and less salt. we added about 4 tbsp water to the dough to get it to ball up, but then after letting it rise and trying to shape the pretzels, it was incredibly tough and hard to work with. we didn't have as much fun trying to shape them as we have with prior recipes. this was more like a chore. i also found that they were too thick for the baking time, but starting getting very brown very quickly, so i had to cover them with foil for the last several minutes of baking. they do have a nice, chewy texture and i like the sweetness, but i wish they would have rolled out thinner and that they were less salty-- and we didn't even add kosher to the top.

This recipie was wonderful. It took a little while because of having to wait for the yeast to rise, but as long as your yeast is fresh it was perfect. Another idea for it, is to cut the pretzels into little bite sized peices before you bake them, and them dip them in cheese. Yum!

I used to work at one of those "mall pretzel vendors" and this recipe is nearly a clone of theirs. Slightly sweeter, but I think that's an improvement!

These pretzels were so good!  I did need to add a little more water to the dough while kneading.  I will need to cut down on the salt next time though.  I also made some mixed with cinnamon and sugar-they turned out excellent!  I love this recipe!

These pretzels came out looking fantastic and tasted wonderful.  I did find that I needed to add quite a bit of additional water to make the dough.  I had no idea if they would turn out or not, because the dough was so dry.  I also made mine a little thicker so had to increase the baking time.  I'll make again!
Update: I made this recipe again with 4 cups of flour and it was perfect.  I also shaped these into rolls and used them for turkey sandwiches.  Yum.

I felt that this recipe was laid out well, that the time estimate was right on track. I made the dough in the food processor, so did not knead the dough. I processed it until it made a ball, had to add a quarter to a half cup of warm water to get it to ball up, but then it balled up nicely. I then pulsed it for 50 seconds in all to knead it.

I did not have trouble making ropes, but needed a countertop with no flour on it to roll them out. 

The oven temp baked them to perfection at the given time. They were beautiful, if a little bland tasting. I was conservative with the salt, having read reviews that stated the pretzels were too salty. I didn't find them salty enough!

Next time I will be experimenting a little with some additional flavoring in the dough. 

All in all a great dough recipe. I love a dough that rises well and is easy to work with.

This one goes in the keeper file for sure!

I didn't read the reviews until in the middle of making when the dough was so dry I was going "What did I do wrong?!"  Added quite a bit more water to make it more manageable and it was not a fun task of kneading and rolling out the dough.  The end result was wonderful, though!  Tasted a lot like mall pretzels, and I liked the sweetness so wouldn't change that... I will probably not make these again- too much work when I live right by an Auntie M's, but they were delicious fresh, especially dipped in cheese sauce.

these are wonderful...easy to make...can make into any shape, not just pretzel form...i used 2 quick rise yeast packets and just removed 1/2 tsp from it prior to adding water and sugar(each pkt = 2 1/4 tsp)...brushed them with butter after they came out of the oven...yummy!

This recipe tasted nothing like mall pretzels. I used half the sugar and they were still overly sweet. The dough was tough and did not rise to make fluffy pretzels. My husband is German and we make some fabulous pretzels. I thought I'd try a new recipe, but we'll stick to our old one.

I must say that I really enjoyed the pretzels, My kids have food allergies and these were great being that they had no dairy products in them. I however found that I needed more water in the mixture and needed to let the dough rise for about 3 hours, I was skeptical at first being that after just 1 hour of letting the dough rise it was really stringy, so I let ir rest for a little bit longer and they turned out great.

they were not like the mall pretzels, but they were very good fresh. didnt keep long even in a plastic bag. you need to roll out the dough until pinky thin. i rolled out pieces till they were about 12 inches, let sit for five minutes, and then continued to roll out to a little over two feet.

Poor to fair when compared to authentic German pretzels.  They lack a certain "chewiness" found in the real thing.

I love this recipe! I used to work at a certain mall pretzel place and these remind me so much of them! Easy to make. Just stuck in my bread machine so I did not have to knead. I am NOT a baker and I still had no trouble with these. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy pretzels!  I used 4 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar.  Be sure the cookie sheet is very greased, bake 8-10 minutes.  
Toppings I tried were regular salt, minced onion, and cinnamon-sugar.  Loved the cinnamon sugar!  The others were great too. Would love to try with sesame seeds.
Nice recipe!

This is a great recipe--much better than anything available in the mall. I substituted butter for the oil and bread flour for all-purpose flour. Bread flour probably made the dough a bit more difficult to roll out, but the final product rose and browned nicely in the oven. 

These were a little sweet for my taste. Next time, I'll try about 1/3 cup instead.

Fabulous!  And so sweet.  My husband and our friends loved them.  Had a hard time twisting it into a pretzel shape so I just backed them as pretzel sticks.  A big hit at our Oktoberfest party.  Thank you!

Beyond delicious. My only problem is getting the final pieces rolled out thin enough, without them springing back into fatter ropes. Doesn't really hurt anything - I just have fat pretzels. I made a batch and shaped them into hearts for my son's Valentine's party at school. Big hit!

I used to work at a mall pretzel place.  Although I had to promise not to give out the true recipe when I left, I can tell you that it doesn't contain any sugar, baking soda, or vegetable oil.  Keep tinkering though, I appreciate it!

Not exactly like the mall pretzels, but I guess you just can't replicate those exactly!  But out of all the pretzel recipes I've tried, this was the easiest, and it tasted suprisingly close!  My husband and kids loved these.

These were incredibly delicious right out of the oven. I followed the advice of other commenters and decreased the flour a little and they came out beautifully and yummy! I'd have to disagree with Talksoupwoman who stated they were "bland" and didn't understand why buttery was in the name. They're called descriptor words! They were soft and buttery. This pretzel recipe as a base is great. A big kiss for the cook!

Although these were a little sweet for my liking, the texture of the finished pretzels was so good that I'd make them again, but with less sugar. I skipped the butter step and used a *little* coarse pickling salt sprinkled over top before baking, and they turned out very well.

These are quite good, although I wouldn't say they're quite like mall pretzels.  I kept trying to roll the dough into a thin rope but it kept bouncing back and I inevitably had plump, thick pretzels (this didn't detract from the taste, it was just frustrating that they woulnd't hold their shape a little better).  My kids LOVE these with Campbell's condensed cheddar cheese sauce (heated up with just a little bit of milk, NOT a whole can).  Also it's nice not to have to boil them in the baking soda bath, just a quick dip and onto the cookie sheet.  We'll make these lots.

I did the melted butter and cinn/sugar on them and my 3 yr old daughter loved it!! My 6 mon old daughter got to knarl on a piece of it and she loved it as well! Thanks!!

They didn't turn out exactly as I expected, but my husband loved them and I thought they were ok.  I dipped them in a butter and garlic salt mixture which gave them some flavor.  I think they work better as a tasty breadstick.  I froze them and popped one in the microwave 2 days later and it tasted fine.  Also good with a dipping sauce, I melted butter and garlic to dip my pretzel into.

Pretzels had a good flavor. They weren't soft and chewy like the mall kind . We're kinda doughy, like a bread stick. I think if I make them again I may let them rise after I shape them and then dip them in the solution.

I was really impressed with this recipe. My pretzel forming technique needs lots of work, but we ended up with a nice collection of different sized pretzels and loved them all.
THe Flavor was great after they were baked, but they did not taste too great the next day.

Though my pretzel rolling techniques need working on, they were great.  Easy and fun to make.  If my grandfather could stand easily without his walker I'd tell him to me these for my brothers.  Right now I have pretzel stix.  They are still good even without salt (kosher salt was at my mom's and I didn't get a chance to stop and get it).  Yummmmmmmmmmmy!!  Thanks!

Buttery without adding any butter!!  Can throw this dough together in no time...absolutely delicious.  My 3 yr old had fun "helping" me.  The cooking time was slightly longer for me, after 8 minutes mine were only 1/2 done.

These turned out amazing!  I did have to add an extra bit of oil as the dough was a bit too dry. I made this recipe with ingredients divided for 6 servings (by the app) but it actually made eight small pretzels. HUGE HIT. I covered some in cinnamon sugar after the melted butter right out of the oven. And some with salt and some unsalted. All perfect flavor, texture and color. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It will stay in my book for years to come.

Made for my nephew’s 16th  bday.  It was such a huge hit, they were gone in minutes.  Made some that were not pretzel shaped, but nuggets that where a huge hit.  Will make that shape again.  Also served with homemade nacho cheese which was an amazing combination.

I'm very bad at baking... Pure awfulness 
And these are the best pretzels ever.
I got the advice of another reviewer, only 4 cups of flour, 410F, 8min
Unsalted butter is important, mine tasted a bit salted.
I used my bread machine to prepare the dough. Easy and fast!

I'd rate 0 if i could. Worst bread "recipe" I've ever tried. I added a whole quarter cup of extra liquid to try to bring the shaggy mess together and the resulting "dough" was so tough I couldn't even tear it. don't attempt, just find something else. I wasted 5 cups of flour on this.

I read a bunch of comments beforehand so I did as suggested and reduced the sugar to just three or four tablespoons.  Used butter instead of oil.  I pretty much made this like a loaf of bread...put all the wet ingredients in the stand mixer and added enough flour to that to make the dough (I didn't do the "well" thing).  Making sure your baking soda is fresh, lining your sheets with parchment paper, drying the pretzels in a towel, and putting the sheet way at the top of the oven are all really important!  Instead of making a dozen it was easier to keep splitting the dough in half so I ended up with 16 larger pretzels (after doubling this recipe).  I brushed melted butter on them when out of the oven.  I gave half to a neighbor  (sad but had to be done) and we ate the vast majority of them right out of the oven!  Will make many times over now!!

Too much flour.  Like other reviews state, start with 3 cups and increase the flour if needed.

The proportions are all off. 5 cups of flour is way too much. The dough turned out too dry even after adding extra water. Will try again with 3 cups,  but a wrong recipe gets 1 star.

This recipe was really good and really forgiving. I kneaded it almost too much and it still came out really soft and fluffy. The amount of flour was fine and I only had to add maybe a 1/4 C water when kneading it.  The people who said it was too much either didn't measure out the flour right (ie. scooped instead of pouring the flour into the measuring cup) or didn't knead it enough to incorporate all of it. I topped some of it with Trader Joe's Everything bagel seasoning and it was amazing.

A basic pretzel recipe that gets a few things wrong. The quantity of flour is a large overestimate. I had to add ½-1½ cups of water before the dough was hydrated enough. 

Also, there is no need for sugar, especially not this much in a pretzel recipe. It makes it taste weirdly sweet when you make savoury pretzels. So after tasting the first test pretzel, I decided to make the rest into doughnuts.

Turned out a bit thick mostly because it was hard to roll them thin enough and have them not spring back.  I will do them again.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I used the recommended amount of flour and it turned out too dense. I still let it rise and baked them, but they were heavy. The second time around I started at 3 cups of flour and in total used maybe 3 1/2. They turned out perfect. My family ate them all within the day.

I made 2 batches of this pretzel dough. The first I used the 5 cups of flour as directed, and it did not turn out well. I tried to salvage it the best I could by adding more water, and still baked them. Tasty, but far too dense. Made the dough a second time and started with 3 cups of flour. Only ended up using 3 1/2 cups total. They turned out amazing.

This is the recipe to get the texture right, but an egg or butter wash is needed to get that authentic pretzel taste. That said, I will use this recipe for pretzel buns. Very tasty!

Fantastic!  Made exactly as written.  Served with creamy horseradish dip and mustard for dipping.  I made these for a football game party and they were gone in minutes.

For the flour comments, I weighed my flour instead of measuring.  I do this because flour can become compacted in the cup and you may get more than needed.  Also, as soon as they come out of the oven, I brushed with warm butter.

My first  time making pretzels and these came out Delicious and we’re super easy to make! After reading some of the reviews I only used 3 cups of flour and a tablespoon of butter instead of the oil. They came out perfect!

I don’t know why it’s called “Buttery Soft Pretzels” since there’s no butter in their recipe, but I’ve made these several times and they’re always great. Sometimes I replace the oil with butter, either way they’re good! I’ve made twists but also cut the ropes and made pretzel bites, which is fun too.

I made this recipe exactly as written, without reading reviews. My pretzels came out tough and dry, not moist, soft, or chewy at all.

After reading the reviews, I would try this again with changes made, but as the recipe is written, it only deserves 1 star.

I am from Philadelphia and went to school in Lancaster, Pa.  this is the best recipe EVER.  I did add some honey to the bowl with butter and allowed the dough to rise in this bowl for 4 hours...I had a doctor's appointment and had to leave it in the oven to rise.  It made 300 pretzel bites which I sell at my deli with beer cheese soup.  I typically bake the bites and then store them away and then quickly fry them in deep oil prior to arranging them on the plate with the bowl of soup in the middle.  Who ever created this recipe....I love you!

These pretzels are amazing!  I made them for my family and they all loved them!  
They taste best straight from the oven.  I like to add only 2 Tbsp to 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  It makes them less sweet.  I love to top them with either a coat of salt or cinnamon/sugar mixture.

These pretzels turned out really good! I had to add a few extra tablespoons of water to the dough mixture since there was too much flour to begin with. I will definitely be making these again.

These pretzels are much more dense than other recipes I've tried.  More like a bagel.  The flavour was really good, though.

I made this recipe as described. Should you be able to name a recipe "buttery soft pretzels" if butter isn't even in the ingredients list? As other reviewers mentioned, this recipe is FAR too dry as listed. I am not a comfortable enough baker to tweak recipes. I thought with 4.6 stars, the recipe was good as is. I feel it is not. Way way too dry.

I just made these / my granddaughter's request!
 I did not want that much sugar so I only used a quarter cup. Other than that I made them exactly the same. I will probably be making them again soon.
 I would like to try putting pulled pork barbecue in them. Or make them into buns for hamburgers.

What I have figured out:
· Boil the baking soda in water
· Add baking soda before boiling
· Brown sugar makes it more flavorful
· Hide the finished product as well as possible

AMAZING and easier than I thought it would be. A few changes I made:
I doubled the baking soda water mixture and boiled each pretzel in the water individually for about 30 seconds each. 
I used 4 cups of flour and even then added about 1/4 cup of extra water. 
I lined my pans with aluminum foil and oiled them they still stuck a little but it was easier to pull away. 
I baked them at 425 instead of 450 on the middle rack so that the bottoms wouldn’t burn. 
I used pink salt on top instead of kosher 
I buttered them all right when they came out of the oven with a brush

I used the heavy duty KitchenAid mixer to mix the dough (used a dough hook).  Added a tad more water.  Used a hand mixer to mix the hot water and baking soda (I put water in microwave for 90 seconds for each of the 4 cups).  I baked for 3 1/2 minutes and then flipped over for another 3 1/2 minutes to eliminate a burned bottom.  Put the kosher salt in a shaker for more even salting.  I will try using butter rather than oil next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out great! But instead of the baking soda bath I used an egg wash instead because I had no baking soda on hand and it worked just as well. I put a garlic herb seasoning with parmesan on mine they were delicious! Thanks, will definitely make them again!

Great recipe, I made it as written, and then experimented with lye water instead of baking soda, adding cheese/basil/sun dried tomato, etc, really good, I now always have a few of these frozen in my freezer for a quick snack.

I made this recipe twice. I used sea salt on the pretzels the first time. It was really salty and they didn’t have that “mall pretzel” taste I was craving. The second time I used coarse salt and it worked so much better.

I would totally make them again. I think I would have added only 4 1/2 cups flour because I needed to add quite a lot of water to the dough because it was a little to dry. Overall fluffy, spongy and great flavor. Loved them!

These are really good.  I ended up using 4 1/2 cups of flour.  I added the extra tsp of oil like suggested.  I started with 3 cups of flour in my kitchen aid with the dough hook on slow speed.  I kept adding flour a little at a time until the dough was no longer sticky.  I formed them like another reviewer suggested.  Cut a rectangular piece from the dough ball with a pizza cutter.  Start in the middle and rub back and forth between your hands holding it up in the air not on the counter.  Then I rubbed one end at  a time until it was 18-20 inches long and about as big around as my little finger.  I made them a little smaller and baked for 7 1/2 minutes.   I made beer cheese dip to go with them  YUM

Allrecipes has never steered me wrong before, but I don’t get the hype on this one. the dough was very dry, making it hard to work with and the end result not very nice texture - I think it needed less flour. And it could use more fat; butter would be tastier than just oil (because, hey, when’s butter not tastier?)....

I followed the recipe exactly and was so disappointed with the results.  The recipe calls for way too much flour.  If I were to make them again, I would cut the amount down to 4 cups to begin with.  Being that there was too much flour, I had to add almost a 1/2 cup of additional water.  I also kneaded the dough for the recommended time.  I had a terrible time trying to get the dough to stretch.  After baking them, I ended up with pretzel "blobs".  They tasted ok, but the dough was awful to work with.  After checking out other recipes, most of them recommend a shorter kneading time in order to not toughen the dough thus making it unmanageable.   Also, the author of the recipe should have told you to heavily grease the cookie sheets because the pretzels will stick.

I normally suck at dough based recipes. But these worked! By son is thrilled because they are easy and “better then the shop ones”. I dunked my cooked ones in melted butter and cinnamon sugar. Omg mmmmmmm lush.

Really easy and yummy! For six of them, I put an egg yolk wash over them and then sprinkled them with salt, and for the other six, I gave them an egg white wash and then sprinkled them with oats and brown sugar! Both were equally tasty, and I may have eaten three right out of the oven... XD

Lots wrong with this recipe.  The liquid to dry ingredients ratio was WAY off. I kept back a cup of flour after reading someone's review thinking it couldn't be THAT wrong. But even that wasn't enough to leave out of it. Recipe calls for probably twice as much flour as needed.  And the baking soda dip before baking - maybe too much soda in it? Anyhow,  my pretzels have a strong flavour of soda. They were edible with my modifications, but as written this would never have worked. I sprinkled ours with cinnamon and sugar after brushing with melted butter.

I will definitely make these again.  The only thing I would do different is turn down temp (below 450).  Some were not quite done on inside, but almost too dark on outside.  Otherwise, great recipe.

This was my first time making pretzels. I formed some into sticks, some into nuggets, and some into actual pretzels. I basted some garlic butter on all of them after they came out of the oven. Next time, I will use less flour, 5 cups was too much! I kept adding water, but since I'm so used to baking sweets, I didn't want to stray too far... now I know to start with less flour and add more as needed. The pretzel-shapes ones were too bready for me, the garlic butter added much needed flavor and texture! I do recommend trying sticks (reduce baking time if you opt for "nuggets")!

Love these pretzels! Our family has made them a dozen times or more. Super easy to make and taste fabulous straight out of the oven. We skip the salt topping and instead leave ours plain. Sometimes we dip them in canned nacho cheese.

Brush with butter after cooking. You can also make pretzel dinner rolls out of it as well

I made these twice.  The first time according to to the recipe but with a little less flour.  They rose so much in the oven they were more of pretzel bread. The second time I used 1 packet of yeast (about half the recipe) and they came out perfect.  I also used an egg wash the 2nd time and they browned this time. So 4  starts for getting me on the right track with these - it might just be my preference.

Pretzel came out pretty good. This was the first time I made pretzels. Did brush butter on them after I took them out of the oven. Going to serve with melted cheese

I tried this but   1 1/4 cups of water to 5 cups of flour was too dry and it wouldn't form a ball. I added a little more water and  kneeded like it said and it didn't rise much was heavy and baked outside dry and inside too  dense.  What did I do wrong?

AMAZING! Used a bread machine, putting in liquids, then drys, then yeast in that order. Used 4 c flour which was perfect.

Excellent! So soft! I added paprika, fresh thyme and salt before baking and it was PERFECT! Making this again and it’s soooooo easy to make too!

I made it twice again. So freakin good! I added cinammon sugar to some of them and they turned out SO GOOD. A keeper

Pretty good taste, but why all the flour. A a novice baker I followed the recipe exactly, I kneaded the dough to hell and back because it was so dry, I must have added half cup of water to make it work but still not as smooth looking as I’m the video. I’ll make another batch but probably start with 3 cups of flour and work off that. Kind of annoyed that the video did not depict the same thing I painstakingly made, and turned out soso when it looked so nice in the vid.

I’m honestly not sure how this worked for some people...we ended up with a ridiculously dry dough even after lots of extra water. Trying to make it smooth just ended up overworking it and it could not be rolled out at all. Then we tried making it into pretzel buns since it could sort of clump together but it was too dry to bake nicely. Huge fail but we found another recipe that worked much better!

This recipe came out tasting more like fresh baked bread and not a soft pretzel.  Too much flour. We will try again with maybe a cup less. On the bright side, we now have a recipe for dinner bread sticks ??

These turned out great. The only suggestion is not to start with five cups of flour. It’s way too much. I started with three and added more as I was making the dough. I think I used about 3.5 cups in all, including rolling out the pretzels.

I wanted some pretzels qnd found this recipe.  The only thing I modified was the flour because of the reviews I read. I started with 3 cups and ended with a little bit over 4 cups. Omg, they are amazing. For half the batch I put cinnamon and sugar and the other was lightly sprinkled regular salt; I didn't have course salt. All in all, they are delicious.

Absolutely amazing! Made them two nights in a row. First night just did coarse salt second did salt for one batch and then sugar and cinnamon for the other - absolutely loced it! As well I did not measure my flour. I literally added until I didn't need anymore but no where near 5 cups. More like 2.75-3. And we didnt put butter on them. They were just perfect without.

I followed the advice in the comment section and made it with 3 cups of flour! Delicious! Will be making again!
One note, 4 cups of water with half a cup of baking soda is more than enough to coat the pretzels. 2 cups of water with just a quarter cup of baking soda would have been plenty.

What a bad recipe. There is way too much flour called for and every other positive review mentions this fact. If every single review mentions that there is too much flour, then it's not a good recipe. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and just trusting the stars and the fact that allrecipes made it into a video. I made it and noticed that there was too much flour. I added an extra 1/2 cup of water in the hopes of fixing it. It didn't. Don't use this recipe without severely cutting down on the amount of flour.

This was my first time making pretzels.  I, too, found it helpful to watch the video of Auntie Anne's pretzel making.  I didn't have to flour the board at all.  But, this is a very springy/elastic dough that needed to be stretched.  Even though I rolled each piece out to about 24", they still shortened up to make chubby pretzels...but they were delicious!  I made 1/2 of the recipe for just the 2 of us this time, and it yielded 6 medium sized pretzels.  I used parchment paper sprayed with non-stick spray and blotted the pretzels on paper towels before placing them on the parchment paper. No sticking or burned bottoms. I also reduced the oven temp. to 415-degrees to avoid the burning/uneven baking problems others reported.  I made a dip for the pretzels called, "Slow Cooker Cheddar Bacon Beer Dip" from the Taste of Home website which proved to be a nice combination.  I plan to make these again sometime and experiment with some different toppings to change up the flavors.  It was a fun baking activity for a laid back Saturday afternoon.

I've been making pretzels for years and I thought I'd try this recipe because it looked a bit easier then mine.  I loved it!  I usually boil my pretzels in soda water instead of just dipping them, I might continue to do that.  My crusts are a bit crispier then these.  I agree about it being too much flour, I made a double batch and used 8 cups of flour, and that was perfect.

I added less sugar,  I enjoy the savory taste, we added both sesame seeds and salt before placing it in the oven.

It was spectacular!!!! thank you so much

The recipe doesn't mention it, but for the yellow/golden color on the pretzels you MUST brush it with melted butter before serving! I did this recipe twice wondering how other people managed to bake such beautifully golden yellow pretzels.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, but used brown instead of white sugar. I also doubled the recipe. As I mixed it was way too dry so I slowly added more water and oil till it looked right. (Probably 1/2 c of water and 2 extra Tbs. oil.) The dough didn't double, but I made a sample one and it was perfect. I only cooked them 5-6 min per batch and they were perfect! The double batch made 25.

Make these every year - they freeze up great and you can cook them in the toaster oven one at a time as snacks! Here's what I did differently: Start with 4 cups of flour and add as needed to form dough.  Set oven to 425, not 450. Brush with melted butter as soon as they come out of the oven. Mmmm

Super easy and the pretzels were soft and yummy. I used 4 cups of flour and it was still hard to incorporate - added 2 Tbls of water and it was fine. I melted some butter and brushed it on when they came out of the oven.

I made these last night and they were at hit! They taste just like the pretzels at the mall. I followed the recipe exactly; except after reading the comments I decided to just baked them on a greased sheet pan with no parchment my paper.  I would use this recipe again, I’m already craving more.

I’ve always thought making pretzels would be way harder, but this recipe was easy to follow and tasted good on my first try. 
One hurdle I encountered, however, was not letting the bottoms of my pretzels burn. Maybe the baking trays I used were too thin, but I’ve come up with a solution. I placed a pizza mesh on top of the tray, so the mesh was suspended over the tray. I then put parchment paper on top of the mesh. When baking the pretzels like this, the bottoms didn’t burn.

I loved the taste and all but it was too much flour and with  the baking soda thing i didnt make it that way cause i didnt have time my friends and famliy was coming over for dinner and the other comments but it worked just fine with adding egg yoke only and i did change the pretzel size and shape (into a pizza) tho but the over all dough was amazing, nice,  and soft,

Def too much flour for me. Next time I'd cut it down by a cup, and I might let them proof after theyre shaped for 20 minutes.  Other than that this is a great recipe and super easy to follow.

I separated the dough into 2 equal portions and then added 2 tsp of garlic to one portion to add a bit *more*. Was a HUGE hit. Will add to my "Must Make Again" recipes.

It was amazing and came out great!  The only thing I would change is the topping if you would like I would use a mixture of 1/4 cup of white sugar with one table spoon of cinnamon to get a cinnamon sugar mix

Followed the recipe. Light and fluffy, but also chewy like a pretzel is supposed to be. Going to try an egg white and water wash after dipping into the baking powder solution to get a darker brown on top. They tasted delicious too.

We used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. It was still really good! Not to mention healthier aswell! I totally recommend it as a quick baked treat!

These are the softest, most fluffy pretzels I have ever had! We brushed the tops with butter after they were done baking and put more salt on top for Amish style soft pretzels!

These are really good. I substituted the oil for butter and had to add a bit more water to the batter as it was super dry. I didn’t use the full 1/4 cup flaky sea salt, I just sprinkle it according to my liking. Baked at 190C fan on pan lined with parchment paper for about 10 minutes! Once it came out of the oven, I brushed melted salted butter on each pretzel. Will be using this recipe again.

As many of you suggested, I used less sugar and only 4 cups of flour and these turned out wonderfully! They're fluffy, buttery, and form a nice brown crust on the outside while remaining soft on the inside. I used half the dough for regular pretzels and used the other half to make pretzel dogs. I brushed them with melted butter once they came out of the oven and they were delicious. Can't wait to try these again with cinnamon sugar. With some slight alterations, this recipe is fantastic. I have almost no experience with breadmaking so if I could do it, anyone can do it! Thanks so much for sharing!

definitely going to make again, but, as suggested by another commenter I only added 3 cups of flour, and ended up adding another half a cup. 8 minutes was too much, and mildly burnt the bottom. so for the second half of the batch I baked them for 6 minutes, flipped them, and baked for another minute. Overall really happy with this recipe :-D

I put the dough in the bread machine.  I did "proof" the yeast in the machine before adding the other ingredients.  Baked for 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  Will definitely be making these again!  They are delicious!

This is WAY too dry and heavy. Even with extra water the dough wouldn't come together, and frankly was so solid it nearly burned out the motor on my pro series KitchenAid. 

Perhaps if you started with half the flour and added as necessary.  But probably more efficient to just try a different recipe.

This recipe is great it tastes just like a "mall" soft pretzel.  The only change I made was I melted a little butter and brushed it on before adding salt and baking.

Just remember to only dip the pretzels in the baking soda water when you’re about to put them in the oven. I made the mistake of dipping them, and had one set sitting out waiting for the other to bake, it resulted in the second set not browning properly. Tasted wonderful though.

Made this for movie night and wow was it amazing! Instead of traditional pretzels, I made pretzel nuggets (slightly more time consuming than going with the traditional pretzel shape) which made them all the more addicting!

I have to say that I do like the taste of the pretzels; however, I may have made a few mistakes. First, I probably could have waited awhile longer for the dough to rise because it didn't look like it had doubled. Second, the dough was just not pliable enough for me to roll it out easily. My hands and lower arms are still a feeling the pressure and I baked them two days ago. The baking soda bath didn't exactly do that good of a job getting them to brown, but I think it could have been because I was dipping the pretzels in as I was doing them and that took about an hour or so to finish. Another thing I did wrong was that I had left the bottom shelf on the bottom slot so the pretzels on the bottom rack got charred on the bottom. I'm going to try this again next month and I'm going to try tweaking the recipe a bit to see if I do better. I don't want to put my hands and arms through so much torture.

Yummy!   My 8 year old says these pretzels are the best thing in the world!  Be careful with the bake time.  Our first batch ended up too brown on the bottom.  Maybe it was because I used a dark baking sheet?  These were very easy to put together.

I read many reviews before deciding to try the recipe as is and go from there. As I always do when making bread recipes, I made sure the water was 110ºf before adding the yeast and sugar in. I used the 5 cups of flour and just added 2 TBSP of warm water to make it PERFECT. I also read someone recommend adding an additional tsp of oil instead of flouring the counter surface. And this was a super great tip as well. I used the dough hook on my KitchenAid and let it knead for 7 minutes. I cut each piece into a 4oz size, used a jump rope motion 2-3 times (per someone else's suggestion; 4-5 was too much I learned once.) I folded each piece and then rolled it to about half of the size it would end up and set this aside to work on the next one. I came back and rolled it out to 30". Put it in a U shape, twisted the ends together 2x and brought down to the bottom of the U to make a beautiful pretzel shape. I soaked 4 at a time in the baking soda water for 30ish seconds. I baked 4 at a time (per someone's review/ suggestion) on parchment paper with a little cooking spray. First 4 were 8 minutes at 450º, it was a little dark but not burnt like others had suggested but I decided to turn it down to 415º like some had suggested. The second bake was it going from 450 to 415 and was a lighter brown. The third bake was at 415º and this one was lighter. They all looked pretty. Taste-wise, we liked the one baked at 450º the most. 10/10 would recommend!

I made these according to the recipe, and they were terrible. They were terrible because the recipe makes a style of pretzel I do not like. They are way too sweet and soft like sandwich bread. I should have paid closer attention to the "soft" in the title. I like a chewy pretzel that is not sweet. I threw these out. However, the recipe came out fine based on the ingredients and directions. Just not to my liking.

Over all, they were good for my first attempt ever making pretzels, although they were a little sweet for my taste.  I also had some trouble not overdoing the bottoms of the pretzels, but I think it was probably my error because I don't have a temperature gauge on my oven.

These are perfectly good pretzels. My family loved them, and they are soft. However, this recipe is not for those that are fond of a good crust on their pretzels. It is important to not over-knead this dough because if you develop the gluten too well, it is significantly harder to roll out.

Used a cup less flour and substituted sugar in yeast for brown sugar..  Made first time exactly as recipe said, was very dry and hard to roll out and shape. Was very floury tasting and doughy like half raw in the middle

Made this almost exactly as written except I halved the recipe, added an extra teaspoon of oil and used half the amount of baking soda in the wash.   They were delicious and my Mom said they were better than Auntie Anne's.  The only problem I had was that the dough shrank back as I tried to roll it out and I couldn't get super long thin ropes, so instead of twisted pretzels I just made long pretzel "sticks" but no one minded, they were really good.  Brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled kosher salt on top right when they came out of the oven and we were all really happy with them.  Recipe is a keeper, but I'll have to do some research as to why the dough would shrink back like that.

Fabulous! I did make changes. I cut the sugar in half, used brown sugar instead, reduced the yeast by 1/2 tsp. (used 2T. + 1 tsp. for a double batch), and used butter instead of oil. I brushed them after baking with melted butter and sprinkled with fresh ground pink himalayan sea salt. Dangerously good! These were delicious and a huge hit. My kids proclaimed them “better than Auntie Anne’s”. I will be making them again. Very soon. ;)

They were way too sweet. They don’t need the extra sugar in the batter, I was really disappointed.

I will definitely make again. Because I didn't have a mixer available, I added a bit more water to the kneading process to facilitate kneading by hand and it worked great!!! Everyone enjoyed!

Tastes great.  I think some of the people saying the recipe calls for too much flour may accidentally be 'over-measuring'.  I'm always surprised by how many people don't know this, but there are methods for measuring flour.  For this recipe I 'fluffed' the flour first.  Took a spoon and fluffed the flour in the container to 'break it up' and make it look 'fluffy'.  Then spoon the flour into a measuring cup until you have a mound and then take the handle of the spoon (or use a knife) and level/scrap-off the excess back into the container.

Doing this, the 5 cups of flour in the recipe wasn't too much.  That said, I followed another reviewer's advice and started with 3.5 cups flour and kneaded in the remaining flour.  I also used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil.

This was a really great recipe. I did have to add more liquid the next few times I made it. It seems to work much better it you add it to the beginning yeast mixture. I have made it several times already. The only difference I make is... I dip the pretzels in simmering water and baking soda until the pretzels rise to the top of the water. They seem to be more light and fluffy on the inside that way. My family and I really like it. I also like to put a light egg wash on the top. I find they cook more evenly and have less darker brown spots. I am totally a Soft Pretzel fan.

I had a suspicion these might be a little on the sweet side, and they are. I was looking for a really good German pretzel I could dip In mustard. While the texture is great, they are just too sweet for me. This batch will be rolled in cinnamon and sugar and make a great desert.

The first time I made these I put them on parchment paper and baked them. They were wonderful!! The second time I made them I put them on greased pans like it was suggested and the bottoms burned before they were done. I definitely will use the parchment paper every time from now on!!

These were the best BEST pretzels I've ever had! I reduced the flour by 1 cup, using only 4. When the pretzels came out of the oven, I brushed them with melted butter. These were inhaled by my family in minutes. Will be making again in the near future!

Easy and yummy! We do half with salt and half with cinnamon sugar. The only downside is that they do not keep.

I've used this recipe twice, and they've came out perfect. However, instead of dipping them in baking soda water, I just brushed it over the top, to avoid the after taste. I also added melted butter to the top of them as soon as they came out the oven. They were really delicious, and I plan to use this recipe again soon.

I followed others' instructions and started with 3 cups of flour and an extra tablespoon of oil. I added the last 2 cups of flour in 1/2 cup increments, but ended up using all of it. I ended up cutting the dough into 24 small pieces for smaller portions and more to share! I decreased the baking soda in the water to 4 tabespoons to 4 L and boiled it on the stove like I saw them do in the Great British Bake Off Masterclass. I rolled the pretzels out on an unfloured surface and did not grease my baking sheet. I think they turned out well! I may try substituting margarine for the oil next time.

Awesome pretzels...I recommend holding the salt back until they’re baked.  Right out of the oven rub over them with a stick of butter then sprinkle the salt on...they’ll have a nice tender, buttery crust!

Great recipe! I had to turn my oven's temperature down to 425 to prevent the pretzels from scorching, since Miele ovens tend to heat up quite quickly. The texture rivalled the pretzels in the mall!

The dough was similar to dried-out playdough, even with water. This made it very difficult to work with, even though we kneaded it for a while, we couldn't form a smooth ball. Maybe if the weight of the flour was added, then the recipe probably would have worked out better for us. Also, a stand mixer could help. Lastly, if these are buttery pretzels, shouldn't butter be added if you don't serve it with a dip or fondue? However, the pretzels tasted great, but looked like cinnamon rolls.

Way too much  flour .. I needed only 3.5 cups. Recipe turned out fine but I make pretzels using a different recipe that I will stick to. Personal preference but I cut  sugar back to 1/3 cup and still found overall flavor much too sweet. I boiled in soda bath.

First time making pretzel and these were so yummy! I’m glad I read suggestions in the reviews to start with 3 cups of flour.  5 cups would’ve been too much IMO. I started with  3 cups of flour and added 1/2 cup more. My dough had a hard time rising and after a little internet search I figured out my house was too cool so I warmed up my oven a little, turned it off and set the bowl in there with a damp wash cloth. Followed the rest of the steps and yum! They really taste like soft pretzels you buy at the mall.

These pretzels were out of this world! I didn’t have oil so I used butter. And it calls for too much flour. But otherwise. I also made a baking soda bath by boiling water with baking soda in it and put the pretzels in the boiling water instead of dipping them in the mixture. Will definitely make again, as well as a homemade cheese sauce I made.

Mine ended up burning on the bottom before the top browned at all, not sure what I did wrong or if I needed to place on a higher rack.  The pretzels were very good iff the burn bottom was cut off though.

This recipe is great. I did end up only using 4 cups of the flour. Plus I added 1 more T of water while it was mixing. Let it go on the kitchen aid mixer for about 10 minutes and it was good to go.

Delicious! Came out really well. Maybe a touch sweet for my taste, but delicious. I used about 3.5 C. Of flour, that was plenty. When they came out of the oven, I brushed them with butter and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Yum!

This recipe is as close as you can get without using lye.
I have been searching for a great one and this is it.
Very yummy. We even used the left overs in the morning for toast. We cut them in half then toasted them. Excellent

Good recipe.  The part where you put the dough in water mixed with bicarbonate is a bit tricky.  Must be my inexperience.  Will do again.

I made these twice in one week. The first time they came out great, the second time they were even better. I made a few little changes. First of all I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, as I don't particularly like breads to be sweet so I might cut back on the sugar even more. Secondly, I double proofed this time, and the dough was even  easier to work with. Lastly, I read a review which mentioned leaving the pretzels in the baking soda/hot water solution for ten minutes. I had just dipped them the first time and shoved them straight in the oven. This time, I left them in for several minutes and then left them for 5 to 10 minutes before putting them in the oven so the dough had time to rise and the result was 15 huge, fluffy pretzels. 

Edit: I chose both times to use the full amount of flour and just add 1/3 cup of water.

I made this as written. I did have to add a few tablespoons of water but the recipe was easy to follow and the pretzels came out buttery and tasty. What I would do the next time, however, is to cut the sugar and decrease the oven temp to 400. They are sweet and I prefer my pretzels with the saltiness and a little more chewy. Thanks for posting the recipe.

These were absolutely amazing. Second batch (and third) instead of water, salt, and oil I used low sodium chicken broth.

They don't last long in the house.

Phenomenal! My son is three and the most pickiest eater I have ever met. It took a few tries to get him to even take a bite, but once he did, he loved it! We used gluten free flour (my son is allergic to wheat, barley, and rye), so the pretzels come out a bit more dense than when we bake with wheat flour (what my husband and I prefer to eat). I make a double batch and freeze them. Then when my son asks for a pretzel, I just pop it in the toaster to defrost. Super easy and super happy to find something he loves to eat!

This is a good solid recipe. I weighed all my ingredients as opposed to just cups and table spoons. I find weighing gives more consistency in baking. No need to flour the surface either. In fact I wouldn't suggest it. If your dough is smooth and right consistency it won't stick. A little more oil in recipe as suggested by other reviewer helps as well. If dough is to springy and wants to pull back when rolling out STOP rolling and allow dough to rest and relax for awhile

I make this recipe at least once a month and my friends and co-workers love when I share these! I typically need another tablespoon or two of water but it just depends on the weather the day I'm making them.  After the baking soda dip I brush with melted butter and generally top with sesame seeds or homemade Everything Bagel Seasoning  (minced dried garlic and onion, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, Kosher salt).

I needed to make these for a potluck at work the next day. I was worried, because everyone says they are not good the next day. Well, mine turned out fantastic and fresh the next day! They were wonderful, the texture was perfect, and they tasted great! 

I had done some research to try and figure out how to make them still taste good and fresh the next day, and it worked! Here's what I did:  I made the dough 2 days before  (used less flour, about 4.5 cups), and froze the dough.  The next day I defrosted it in the 'fridge. That night, I rolled and shaped the pretzels, dipped them in the baking soda water, and baked them at 410 degrees for 6-8 minutes. They were just turning lightly golden. After they cooled, I put them on a cookie sheet lined with a kitchen towel, covered them with another towel, and then covered the cookie sheet, towels and all, with plastic wrap. 

At work the next day, I lightly misted the pretzels with a spray bottle of water to reinfuse some moisture.  I baked them in our little toaster oven at 410 degrees for 4 minutes. They were a perfect pretzel brown color! Slathered them in melted butter, added kosher salt to some, an "Everything" spice mix to others, and I had made some into nuggets that got coated with cinnamon sugar. I had several dipping sauces; pepper jack cheese sauce, cheddar cheese sauce, honey mustard, and a powdered sugar glaze for the cinnamon sugar nuggets. 

They were wonderful! They were as fresh as if I had made them all in one shot! M

Really good!  A few changes to adjust to my own personal tastes.  I like a chewy pretzel and used 3.5 cups of bread flour.  I mixed the dried ingredients and set them aside.  As soon as the yeast mixture was ready, I poured it into my KitchenAid mixer  bowl with the dough hook, added the oil , and 2 cups of the flour mix.  I turned on the mixer on low speed adding about 1/2 cup as soon as I could see the mix was combined, once all flour was added, about 2-3 minutes. Realizing it looked a bit dry, I added one additional tsp of oil.  It was the exactly what it needed.  I increased the speed to 3 for about 30 seconds and then on low (1) again until the dough ball had pulled away from the sides and was on the hook.  I pulled the dough off the hook.  Kneaded it about 1 minute more just until I saw the dough looked smooth and silky.  I placed it in an oiled bowl (or cooking spray). I let the dough proof for another hour and then portioned twelve pieces and shaped the dough.  Using a slated spatula, I dipped each pretzel in the hot water/soda  mixture, let it drip,  and sprinkled with some Kosher Salt.  Once in the oven, I baked them for about 6 minutes,  brushed on some melted butter, and then put back in for 3 more minutes.   

I then mixed up a quick little mustard dipping sauce (with a Tablespoon full of mayo,  1 1/2 tsps. of spicy brown mustard, 1 tsp of Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp honey.)

Overall, a fairly easy recipe with delicious results.  Thank you!

This was the first time I had ever made a recipe with yeast. I didn't roll the pretzel out thin enough and had to bake them a little longer than the recipe called for. They turned out well enough that my wife would come home after work and would have one to tide her over till supper (that is success in its truest form). This pretzel stays in my favorites. I've added a note to roll them out thinner that is the only thing I will be changing. EXCELLENT SNACKING!

Very tasty! I was a little cautious around adding 5 cups of flour, but starting with 3 and slowly adding up to 5 makes the dough perfect!  Mine burnt on the bottom and didn't brown on the top but it didn't make the any less amazing!

Make this for my wife all the time. I cut them into bite sized pieces rather than making whole pretzels. They don't usually last more than a couple days. Also have rolled them into dinner rolls turned out very well.

This recipe is good. However, for all the people having trouble with a "bitter" taste, make sure you are NOT using aluminum pans to boil your pretzels! I'm very surprised it did not say this in the recipe. It causes a chemical reaction with the baking soda.

I think I have found the holy Grail of pretzels! These are amazing, made exactly as written. I made 4 garlic parmesan,  4 plain and 4 cinnamon sugar out of the dozen. So yum!  Plus I made the nacho cheese sauce from here too for dipping... awesome;)

This is the 3rd recipe I've made and the only one thats great. My son said if he could he would give this recipe 10 stars. I followed everything exact,  I did need more water and I went over the rising time limit by 15 mins doing other things at the time. I folded the dough alot when kneading, they all came out soft and thick. Put brown sugar on 6 for my boys. We rolled the dough to about 12" for big puffy ones and brushed with butter once done. Thanks for a great recipe, we loved it.

I made these for my son for years, and now he is 16 and makes them himself!    We use our   stand mixer with a dough hook to speed thing up.   We also boil the pretzels a minute or so in the baking soda water to give them a bit more of a chewy texture. Divine!

Ok, now I don't write reviews ever.... but I made this recipe, and if it weren't for reading the comments before hand, I'm sure my pretzels would be a complete failure. First, I take off 1 star with this review for the fact that 450 F is WAY TOO HOT; you want to bake at 400 F otherwise you'll have burnt pretzels. Second, I take off another star because you shouldn't have to be going through comments to be able to successfully make what a recipe is for and 5 cups of flour is too much as well, you need 4 CUPS OF FLOUR. I'd take off more stars, because I've had better pretzels, but it's still a decent recipe that I didn't mind following. 3 Stars total. This recipe NEEDS to be modified, especially for the temperature.

***Also a little personal tip: Be sparingly with the kosher salt. You want to under-compromise, or you'll have pretzels that are too salty even to the slightest.

I think the recipe was amazing, it was really easy to follow especially for people who have never made pretzels before. However the quantity of flour is a lot, you can always add water but make sure the dough is not sticky.  You can also add your own flavour becuase this is a simple recipe. I ended up adding cinnamon and instead of bathing it in baking soda, I mixed the water, baking soda and sugar and brushed it over the surface of my pretzels.

So delicious. The ratio for ingredients was spot on in my opinion as the dough was perfect  (I didn't even use a mixer, I did it all by hand). The only thing I will do differently is put the rack in the oven up higher and the bottoms got a little more brown than I prefer. 
Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

These always turn out great!! I followed 2 reviews, and used half white sugar n half brown sugar. Also I used a damp dish towel to cover while the dough rose and it did not dry out. I brushed each pretzel with melted butter before going in the oven and as soon as they came out I brushed them again with melted butter m--Yum!!

Super easy, and it tastes and smells great!!! But be carefully to remove excess water after you remove it from the baking soda solution.

I will make it again.  The only things I would change is add a half a cup less of sugar because they seemed a little too sweet to me.  Other than that, great recipe.  I am a beginner baker with limited baking supplies (I live in Korea) which means this is a great recipe for those with little baking knowledge and supplies. They seemed really fluffy to me, which I liked, and it could be that I kneaded for 30+ minutes.

This recipe was so good! I did have to add 2 tablespoons & 1/2 teaspoon of water to get the dough to be perfect. It was very easy and made my house smell wonderful. All of my 5 kids loved it, a new family favorite.

I am not a professional bread maker, but I  noticed the flour to water ratio is extremely imbalanced towards the flour. I made a batch using this recipe and instructions exactly giving the author the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately my pretzels failed. Upon reading others reviews, most indicate they reduce the flour significantly. I feel that if one writes a recipe and gives detailed instructions, they should at least be accurate and not require modification. I would challenge the author to revise this recipe to one that is capable of being made.

The recipe makes really fluffy good pretzels BUT unless you are planning to make sweet pretzels DO NOT USE that much sugar. Mine are almost inedible they are so sweet, I would recommend using 1/3 of what the say. A little disappointed

Needed a good recipe for my Catechism class for Lent, to show the children pretzels are like praying hands.  
My 2nd. & 3rd. gds. LOVE THEM, planning to make them again this week.

These are very good, but I decided to give the recipe 4 stars because I wished it had more detail. I'm an experienced bread baker, but, since I've never made soft pretzels, I needed the kind of specifics that are in the Papa Dexler's Bavarian Pretzel recipe. There I learned that the bread ropes should be 15 inches long & the water for the baking soda mixture should be boiled, not just hot, like tap water. I think that difference probably affected the texture on the outside of the pretzel.  In spite of that, my family loved them, so I can say that this recipe is very forgiving. Based on another reviewer's suggestion, I used sea salt instead of kosher. I also sprinkled them with granulated garlic and Garlic Garlic by Pampered Chef, then brushed the pretzels with butter when they came out of the oven. That was delicious. The slight sweetness of the dough goes really well with that combination and I highly recommend it.

This recipe is amazing. They came out perfectly chewy and crispy at the same time, and I've already eaten half the batch in T+25 mins.! As some other reviewers have mentioned, make sure to add the flour in increments to avoid having a dough that's too dry. I'm sure this recipe would be great if you cut the sugar down a bit too, but why bother? Stick to the script. We're eating pretzels. #yolo.

I used this recipe for 2 reasons.

I followed the recipe by the book, and then split the amount into two separate bowls. One bowl I made Cinnamon and Sugar pretzels. The second were Pizza Pretzels. When i was mixing the dough by hand, i added the cinnamon to one bowl and the italian herb to the other. 

Rather than 12 pretzels, I had 9. 6 were the smaller cinnamon sugar ones, which are Scrumptious!! The other 3 were purposely larger so i could add my peppers, onion, cheese, spinach, and pepperoni on top. Those are in the over right now and look amazing!!

This was my first time ever making pretzels from scratch (2nd time total) and i will definitely use this recipe again!!

I had my reservations about taking on a traditional ''trip to the mall highlight'' treat but this recipe looked relatively easy to follow. 

OH MY was it easy! 

The only change I made (and that was after reading the reviews) was decreasing the amount of flour to 4 cups (+/-). 

I kept mindful of the dough texture so as to have enough to make a manageably soft dough that held it's shape but wouldn't be tough.  

LOVED the baking soda trick! Other recipes DO NOT have that oh-so-important step! 

Definitely will be making more! The 1st batch is already gone! ;)

Delicious!  Made as is but just omitted the salt for my father in law. Didn't even miss it. I actually just rolled these into balls - came out as little bites. We sprinked salt on 3/4 of them and left the rest unsalted. Amazing!

So... instead of dipping the dough balls in, I soaked them in the baking soda hot water solution. I then buttered them AS SOON AS THEY CAME OUT and seasoned them. My friend who loves these says this particular batch was the BEST!

We cut the pretzels into more pieces than specified here, and as I rolled them and shaped them, I dunked them in the bath, then my boys would sprinkle cinnamon sugar on one and salt on another.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to brush them with butter before sprinkling my toppings.  They were easy and awesome!  The kids are so down because they are still full from dinner, but they want to eat the pretzels so bad!!!  Ha!

I'm very new to dough and pastry and this recipe simple and easy to follow. It'll definitely take some practice getting the dough just smooth enough to stretch and twist properly, but I recommend everyone give this a try!

I loved these! My first experience making pretzels and they were fantastic!  My only modification was that I added the flour gradually until the dough was perfect..for me, I only needed 4 C vs the 5 in the recipe. I also needed to add 2T of water.  Perfect! I brushed them in hot melted butter and served with beer cheese dip.

Delicious and soft! I made this twice this week and the first time I only added enough flour for it to clean the bowl and the dough dissolved when I gave it it's baking soda bath. So I made them into sturdier rolls which were still delicious but not so soft pretzel-y. 

The second time I put in all 5 cups of flour, spooned and leveled and the dough was perfect and still soft after baking. 

The baking soda bath is important but it didn't give it enough of a chewy pretzel texture for me. I've seen recipes where you have simmering baking soda water and thought I will try that next time instead of just hot water. 

The dough and yummy and sweet and I had several people comment that they taste just like the mall pretzels. I've had them salted and with cinnamon sugar. I think I might cut out a little of the sugar next time for the salted ones.

CHANGE THE DANG RECIPE ALREADY!!!!!!!  This recipe badly needed a low rating.  I've been very frustrated with the results, after having used the specified 5 cups of flour, and an unspecified number of very colorful words.  Fearful of breaking the KitchenAid, I switched to a heavier mixer part-way through.  Now nearing the end of trying to rescue the dough with tablespoon after tablespoon of water (on number 8 and still going).

Enjoyed doing it, though I'd recommend boiling it in simmering water with baking Soda for one minute in each side. :) otherwise, a great experience and now a new recipe for my family!

Awesome! I only used about 4c of flour as said by many others. I also used brown sugar, and only 6 tbsp. I used my kitchenaid mixer and mixed with the hook for about 4-5 minutes. The only thing i would do differently would be to double up on the pans, as the bottoms get very brown. I brushed with garlic butter (garlic powder and parsley and melted butter) and dipped in pizza sauce. Next time i may add some shredded mozzarela during the last few mins of cooking.

Our family really likes this recipe! I make them regularly. My kids prefer them sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and then baked and my husband and I prefer sea salt. And in case anyone was wondering, I do my dough in the bread machine (just don't include the 1 tsp of sugar) and put the liquid in first. It always comes out great and saves me the work. And the baking soda/water bath is necessary, though I think using 4 cups of water and 1/2 c. baking soda is a little much, especially since it's just for wetting the pretzels. Great recipe!!!

I made these into dipping sticks for beer cheese sauce I had made earlier. Did everything the same except I only used 1 cup baking sofa in a bowl of hot water, and I baked about 11-12 minutes at 400. They were fabulous! I will definitely make them again!

These were divine! I've never made pretzels before and I generally find myself not fantastic at baking a darn thing but these turned out so perfect. Chunky, buttery, salty. My husband LOVES them. I read through a bunch of reviews before I dove in to baking and reduced the flour to 4 cups which was perfect. I added an extra teaspoon of oil also. Didn't need to flour any surfaces! The baking soda bath is an absolute must! And finally I slathered melted butter all over my pretzels when they were done. Way, way better than what you can find at the shops. Will be making these again and again, thank you so much!

These came out great! My boyfriend said they were perfection. I really didn't expect much since I'm not much of a baker but they tasted just like the ones at the mall. I dipped mine in butter and sprinkled salt on after baking.

Great recipe, though I replaced the oil with butter and used only 4 cups of flour instead of 5. I also didn't use as much hot water and baking soda (in the baking soda bath) because it's really a waste of ingredients if you use 1/2 a cup of baking soda just on this part. 3/8 a cup of baking soda paired with 3 cups of hot water creates the same effect, while saving your hard-earned ingredients. But overall, this recipe is really good if you just want something tasty and light to munch on.

I followed the recipe exactly. I found them to be a little sweeter than I'd like. Next time I'll adjust the sugar content. They did cook up nicely. Golden brown on the outside and soft and fluffy inside.

Yeast did NOT proof with that much water.  First batch was a scrap.  Second may not work right either.  The third batch I'm doing using manufacturer instructions for the yeast, and that one did proof okay.  Still waiting to see if the second and or third batches rise properly, and if so which.

*Edit.  After baking they did turn out alright.  They are a little dense, but I'm thinking that was due to my yeast problems. Still, not bad considering the yeast problems.  All in all, I will make them again, but I'll follow the manufacturer's yeast proofing instructions then add in the extra water when it comes time to mix with the flour.

Had to add some water for the 5 cups of flour -  I also added another 1/2 tablespoon of veggie oil and  a little more sugar to the mix. After the dough was  mixed together I put it in a kitchen aid mixer  with the dough hook for 12 minutes.  Came out perfect. Pretzels were doughy and held together like a pretzel should with a slight sweetness from the extra sugar.

I make these every year for our OktoberFest.  They take awhile, yeast breads always do, but they're quite simple to make.  I use my kitchen aid mixer dough attachment so no hand kneading required!  Add some beer cheese dip and you're set.  People request these now so I make them in batches and freeze ahead of time.  Thaw and warm, place in a napkin lined basket et voila!

Needed to add 5 tbsp water 
From 55 gram dough balls, made 24 18 inch, pencil thick pretzels.
Used flat, brown, non-alcoholic beer instead of baking soda bath.
Am experimenting with freezing before dipping and baking.

Good recipe. Glad I read the reviews as 'mose' offered very helpful and necessary suggestions. I didn't us all the flour-started with 3 1/2 cups and added as needed, I swapped melted butter for the oil, and I chose to dip the pretzels in cinnamon sugar instead of using kosher salt. The cinnamon sugar was AMAZING! I've never made pretzels before, but I'm sure I'll be making them again with this recipe and these changes.

These are excellent. Made them for my daughter's class on her birthday as an alternative to the tired cupcakes. Her classmates loved them. I made the recipe dumping all the flour into a bowl and added the proofed yeast and water mixture into that. As others reviews noted, not all the flour would incorporate. Second time I made it, started with 3 cups flour, and added more to bowl as it mixed. Then, as I kneaded, I was able to get all except a half cup worked in. So, in total, I used 4 and a half cups. This is a fun recipe to do with kids. The kneading is hard unless you have a way to elevate a youngster so the work is below them. (I kneaded while my daughter threw more flour on the counter for me.) We made smaller pretzels so we could get 24 of them. They baked up to fit nicely on desert plates. I imagine full size would each likely fill a regular plate. Great recipe!

Made the recipe exactly as directed. Very good pretzels and my boyfriend is crazy about them. I would say that I needed more water than suggested because the dough was quite dry. I will try with less flour next time as suggested in other reviews and see what happens. :)

Great and simple recipe!   
I only needed about 4 cups of flour, so don't add it all at once.  Note that you will have to roll them out VERY long and thin in order to get a smooth pretzel shape.  These came out delicious sprinkled in some coarse salt and melted butter.  Also stuffed a few with creamy spinach dip! (See photo)

I loved these and I was wondering how they were going to be "Buttery" without using butter.  While they were warm I put a batch in a [cake] carrier to take somewhere however, when I got there  there were soggy :-( so lesson learned.  Pro Tip:Don't cover them while right out of the over) .
Right out of the oven and without them feeling like they were left in the rain all night they are fantastic.

great recipe, delicious without butter. Only complaint which doesnt deserve taking away stars is that, the cook time should be (in my gas oven) more around 7 minutes at 450 degrees, not 10.

Too much flour, they tasted more like bread than pretzels.

I made this with my Taiwanese first graders. I followed the advice of using only 3 cups of flour, but it was too sticky so I stirred in about 3/4 cups more. I also didn't use enough baking soda so they only browned a little and we added coarse sea salt since kosher salt is impossible to find here, but they still turned out delicious and very pretzel flavored. The kids loved it.

Good recipe, great fun to make! I used 25% whole wheat flour as I was low on white flour. The key to a good pretzel shape is to roll the dough pieces quite thin. Thanks to Mose for the explanation of the hot soda water dip, as I might have been tempted to skip this step. But the beautiful color developed perfectly!

Fabulous!  I used only 4 cups of flour and it was perfect!  We brushed with melted butter as they came out of the oven.  Yum!

I've made these in the classic twist shape and in bite sized pieces, both ways they are phenomenal. I add my flour until the dough just wont absorb anymore. Its more intuitive than you'd expect . Definitely do the baking soda bath, but the water only has to be hot to dissolve the baking soda, you can dip your pretzels after the water has cooled. The only downside of this recipe is that they don't keep for very long, I highly recommend making them the day of. Even so, make a double batch - they go fast!

It came out really well but I had a bumpy road.  First when I was mixing the dry and wet ingredients, it was way to dry.  I ended up adding a lot of water, so next time I will definitely put less flour.  Then it was kind of flaky when I was kneading it so it came out a little dence.  Then last, I had to cook it for longer than 10 minutes, I cooked it for around 13-15 minutes, but in the end it all came out really well.  Thanks for the great recipe

I did use some tips from others reviews; such as not as much flour, a bit more oil, not using flour on our rolling/shaping table, and lower oven temp, 400 degrees.  The only tip I can add is that we probably could have cut the amount of baking soda solution in half (2 cups hot water and 1/4 cup baking soda) and still had plenty.  The taste was great, we loved them!

I also used butter instead of oil. The browning was not consistent but that is something I will have to work on.

This is our go-to pretzel recipe. Consistently good, sometimes even better than mall pretzels and I LOVE mall pretzels. Best flavor for us has been making them bite size, sprinkling with pretzel salt, cooking 6-8 minutes, dipping in melted butter fresh from the oven and then sprinkling with salt again. My 10 & 12  year olds can make them by themselves because the recipe is simple enough and we've made them so many times.

I used all the correct ingredients but found this a bit undercooked . I left it in For an extra 5 minutes then another 5 and it still tastes really bready and moist.

These were very good. Like Tiffany said, I used three cups of flour instead. Also, it may be helpful to note that I am not the sharpest tool in the shed; however, I forgot that baking soda reacts with water. I filled a bowl of water almost to the rim, and dumped the baking soda in all at once causing it to spill and foam all over my counter. You may want to add the soda a bit slower and use a bigger bowl for mixing it.

Super awesome! I would totally make these again! They are great with sea salt! I didn't have any cinnamon sugar but they seem like they would be good with it! I didn't make all 12 pretzels at once, but I had to re-preheat the oven for a second round!

OH MY YUM! So, SO delicious!!! I was a little skeptical about this recipe at first, because whilst making the dough, it seemed like it took a lot of water (more than two addition tbsp, per the recipe) to get the dough to actually take form, and it honestly didn't seem to double in size, but rather just grew about 1/2, but I kept heart and am so glad I did! I'm generally used to making German pretzels, which are  different, especially when it comes to the crust. But, these were such a nice change and WILL be my go-to pretzel recipe from here on out. (I'm already clearing a spot in my permanent recipe book for them. :) ) I brushed them with softened butter fresh from the oven and as soon as I took a bite, I was SO overwhelmed by the soft texture, authentic taste, with just the perfect amount of crust. **I do recommend not overthinking when forming the strands that you'll kill the yeast and they won't re-take their form. As soon as you dip in the baking soda mixture, it automatically fluffs them up, so don't worry about making them too dense because that just isn't possible with this recipe! Do whatever you need to get your form right. They'll turn out just delightful! Will be making these again and again and again and again!

These are lovely and fluffy. So good. The only thing I altered was the amount of flour. I used 3 cups instead of 5. Just because of the dry weather and high elevation of where I live in Alberta, Canada.  I made the same recipe but added cheddar cheese to the dough. So good. Definitely a favourite in my home for my family.

Followed recepie  exactly but reduced the flour like many of the others did.  They came out quite tasty, but next time I am reducing the sugar and using butter in place of the oil.  I thought they were a bit too sweet.  I bakedhalf on oiled parchment paper and they still stuck like crazy.  Some so bad the bottoms could not be peeled off of the paper. The rest were baked on my preheated, well seasoned pizza stone. This worked much better.  Be sure to use very course salt.  My kosher salt tasted fine but was very hard to see or remove if you wanted to.

These are sooooo good. After reading reviews, I decreased the flour to 4 cups. The first batch quickly disappeared so I quickly made a second. Great treat for after school or late night snacking. They don't even need a dipping sauce!  I will definitely hang onto this one. Thanks!

I made these for the first time ever, the only thing i changed was alittle less sugar, They turned out perfect, i made 3/4 of the batch pretzels and the other 1/4 i cut into bite size and after dipping into butter rolled them in cinnamon and sugar, both the bites and the pretzels turned out very nice and the flavor was awesome, we have found a new family favorite, And you do need all the flour, more flour =more pretzels,

I'm giving this five stars because I really liked it and my family devoured them within about half an hour of taking them out of the oven!  But I want to experiment with the recipe to see if I can tweak it to make it better.  I used white whole wheat flour, and that worked very well (I imagine the pretzels would be even better with white flour, but this improved the nutritional profile).  I might also try reducing the sugar sometime to make these more nutritious, although the extra sweetness did taste good.  The dough was too dry to come together with the amount of flour called for, and I had to add water.  Next time I'll start with less flour and add more as necessary.  With the oven at 450, I was having trouble with the undersides of the pretzels getting browner than I liked.  This was alleviated somewhat by using a pizza stone, but next time I might try a lower oven temperature.  These tasted more bread-like than pretzel-like to me, and I wonder if dipping longer in the baking soda solution would help.  I just did a quick dip, but I saw another recipe that recommended a 45-second dip.  I also want to come up with some good sauces for these pretzels and experiment with coating them with cinnamon sugar or baking them with cheese.

I just made a test batch and this is definitely going to be a football favorite! I made the recipe as is but to make it easier, I made the water/baking soda in a pot on the stove. I rolled the dough into a long snake, held either end, dunked then twisted in as I laid it on the cookie sheet.

My favorite recipe, can replace oil w/ butter to make it more buttery, but actually my favorite is substituting half of the oil with butter. 

Also: if the dough isn't fluffy, especially after rising, throw it out and start over because you won't get the full effect of fluffiness.

Great tasting recipe! Mine didn't nearly look as good but I'm working on it. I used the 3 cups of flour which seemed to work well. I also used two tablespoons of water while mixing which seemed to be too much and made the dough sticky. Next time I would like to try the butter instead of the oil and only one  tablespoon of water.

I rolled the dough into long strips, then cut small bite sized pieces instead of the classic pretzel shape. Worked great for a party app. Just make sure not to over bake them!

This recipe worked out so well! I'm a beginner and this wasn't too hard. It was quite messy though! After reading some of the reviews I decided to use less flour (4 cups) and that worked well. They were so much like mall pretzels I was so surprised. I would use a bit less sugar next time, But the consistency was fantastic. I did use oil and not butter and they sure do cook fast. Overall I really like these!

There was too much flour and then I added too much water and it was a mess until I finally evened it it out... I did everything else exactly and they came put PERFECT. They taste AMAZING. They have a beautiful buttery and yeasty flavor and look gorgeous. Definitely a make again! My family and friends LOVE them, they couldn't get enough.

I made this in my bread machine, without proofing the yeast. Just dumped all ingredients into my machine and let it rip. I did have to add about two tablespoons of additional water because the dough was very stiff and craggy. I liked the flavor of these, but they were nowhere near chewy enough for my liking. I'm still on the hunt for the ever-elusive perfect soft pretzel recipe!

This was AWESOME. My kids LOVED it! I was only halfway sure I was even doing it right because I generally suck at making a good dough, but it turned out amazing. I forgot the salt and my kids still devoured it. Will definitely keep this recipe on the books!

thank you for sharing your recipe. it amazes me how simple it is. after paying 4 pounds in london for each pretzel, i thought of making them at home. the only change that i made was use about 2/3 cup less flour and add a bit more water. i brushed these pretzels with melted butter once they came out of the oven and covered them with cinnamon sugar. next time i will use bread flour to see if the crust will be crispy (used all purpose).

I've never made pretzels before and for my first attempt they came out amazing and were very easy to make! After reading several reviews I decided to use four cups of flour and they turned out perfect . I baked them for 7 minutes at 450. Once done I coated them with butter and cinnamon. They were delicious and I will certainly make them again!

I agree with other reviewers that these tasted more like rolls than pretzels, but they are quite delicious! I didn't need all of the flour--about 3-1/2 cups in the dough would've worked. Since my oven overbakes everything, baked the pretzels at 400 degrees. They ended up underdone, but I was afraid of burning them. Next time I'll leave them in a bit longer, and I'll reduce the sugar. It was my first attempt at pretzels, and I'll enjoy doing "quality control" on each and every one.  :-)

I had to add about 3 or 4 extra tbsp of water, but this recipe is fantastic! It was scary adding so much salt, but just do it, it's really good. Drizzle with butter right out of the oven and enjoy with Dijon sauce (mix equal parts Dijon and mayo, stir in some brown sugar or honey to taste and a tiny splash of cider vinegar)!!!!!!!!

Wow!  My only criticism was it didn't make enough.  I did replace the cooking oil for melted better, otherwise the recipe is spot on for soft, chewy pretzels like at the fair.

Great!  A few tips: I suggest starting with only four cups of flour, kneading, then adding more as needed.  Secondly, I didn't need the whole four cups of hot water and baking soda.  Next time I will keep the ratio the same, but do less - 2 cups water and 1/4C baking soda.  Finally, next time I will bake longer at 350.  Mine came out doughy following the directions.

Awesome awesome awesome!!! These were so soft and delicious, and had a perfect hint of sweetness. I was going to give an egg wash on top, but realized I had no eggs. I gave a quick and light vegetable oil spray, and they turned out perfect!!

This is my first review on this site and felt that I needed to thank you. This recipe is what I have been looking for, it works great with a bread machine. They were gone in a day.

Like most people, I cut back the flour. 4 cups is plenty and I added a bit more while kneading. I followed another suggestion that recommended placing the pretzels on a paper towel right after the baking soda wash so the bottom isn't dripping with the wash. This helps the bottoms not burn while baking. 
I think a lot of people might miss the part in the very beginning, the quote, where it says to add butter on top of them right after they're out of the oven. I melted some butter and brushed it on, and it made them just prefect.
They're reminiscent of Auntie Anne's, with a yummy bread-like flavor. Over half of them were gone within 5 minutes.

I had previously tried one recipe before I came across this one. The first recipe was fair, did not turn out the way that I had expected. This recipe is delicious, time consuming but boy was it worth the wait.  I could not believe how good it taste. I made mine with cinnamon sugar coating.  Taste like Auntie Anne's to me. :)  GREAT

I love making pretzels with the kids.  It's a great activity for days when we're stuck inside or we have guests.  I cut the dough into equal pieces and let the kids make their own shapes.  They each get a cutting board with a little flour to work on.  They have a ton of fun, the clean up is minimal, and it keeps us occupied for a good while.

I couldn't find my usual recipe so I followed this one b/c it has such a high score with over 1500 reviews.

I think these are a 3, my kids think they are a 5!
These are much sweeter than my usual recipe that calls for just a few tablespoons of sugar.  One of our guests who says she doesn't like pretzels loved how sweet they are and she probably ate half the plate!   

Usually I bring the water and baking soda to a boil and dunk them for 30-60 seconds.  They look lumpy and weird when they come out but they bake up beautifully.  I followed this recipe for the first batch to go in but they didn't get as nice of a crust as usual.  For the rest I dunked them in boiling water and then came out perfect.

I changed the sugars to be 2/3 white sugar and 1/3 dry, powdered malt (not diastatic malt). Mixing the malt in with the flour, sugar and salt and there was no problem with it clumping up. 

I used my steaming convection oven for these and they came out huge.  I followed an earlier reviewer's advice and dropped the temperature to 415.  I might go even lower the next time around.

 The crowd raved over them.  I think this is a very forgiving recipe and look forward to making it again.I think there are 2 "twists" for the pretzel - the first is to twist the dough "rope" - that yields a very attractive finish to the product.  The second is the obvious loop / twist to put it into shape.

Loved it, just added a little more sugar to make it sweeter and cooked for 6 1/2 minutes since we live in high altitudes.

Family loved these pretzels. Great project for little kids too! The next time I make these, I will not use so much flour. I baked at 415 degrees for 9 minutes with the rack high in the oven and they turned out great. Gave them a brush of butter out of the oven too.

All I have to say is WOW! These are so amazing! The crust comes out a beautiful golden brown and the inside were soft and yummy! I did not add the whole 5 cups of flour though. I only used 3 cups and it came out perfect! Any more would have been too much.

Too much flour and probably not enough water.  Too thick for me, but the flavor is okay.  Might try again, but use a cookie press to make the "rope"... might make a difference.  The rope comes out too dry. I think they may have needed to bake longer, too. 8 minutes at 450 "Might" be enough... but they seem a little too underdone to me.

It was an easy recipe to follow and the results are seriously fantastic!!! I only ended up needing 4 cups of flour and still had to add water. So I suggest only using a portion of what's called for and then adding more as needed. The 8 min cooking time is pretty exact too so don't walk away and forget them!

DO the last step with the baking soda and water!!! I only did it with my last pretzel. They all turned out delicious, but the one that was dipped in baking soda and water, browned nicer without drying out on top.

I made pretzel bites instead.  Baked them at 415• for 8 minutes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and they turned out amazing! I have to force myself to stop eating them so there is some left for everyone else when they get home from school and work!!!

Added the 5 cups of flour, had to add more liquid. The pretzels came out great for us! Had my 5 year old help, using the dough hook on the mixer. It was fun, easy, and yummy!

If you are hesitate about putting them in the baking soda bath don't be-it makes all the difference! Be sure to do it before you have the last rise though. I was lazy and used my bread maker for the dough and I used an egg yoke. They turned out very tasty!

I think these turned out pretty good considering my first batch I forgot the oil and the second batch I decided to add a little King Arthur Flour Pizza Dough seasoning.  Made them a little more cheesy tasting.  Next time though, I will not use the baking stones.  Took too long to cook and the bottoms were still soft (and I even blotted the pretzels on paper towels after the sodium h20).  Next time I'm just blotting the solution on the top and using a metal baking sheet.  I only used 4 C Flour the 2nd batch.

First time making pretzels and this recipe was great, bit tedious for a new novice but was absolutely great and turned out better than imagined.  It was plain, but a quick fix was to add garlic to the butter or any other flavor tasted great.

I thought it was okay. I followed the recipe without any adjustments. My only issue was the time that it was in the oven and/or the temperature...the bottoms burnt before the top part was even brown. I would probably make this again, lol it was kind of fun making them.

I actually changed the recipe after mixing in the flour mixture, and headed in the direction of a bread.  I added an egg yolk, oregano, baking soda, and as much flour as possible.  I kneaded it a lot, and let it rise twice.  Then i added some melted butter and cheese on top.  It actually made a great bread.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a more flavorful recipe.   :D Maybe sometime i'll actually make the pretzels.

Woke up this morning and decided to bake pretzels! Went on google, saw all the good reviews and helpful hits (thank you all for that; they were invaluable) and they were FANTASTIC!!! I would give the recipe a five if it weren't for the 4 cups of flower they recommend...Like everyone mentioned, 3 cups is perfect and I ended up add a few tsp of water. I put the oil in the bowl, as the recipe asks for and found it easy to roll out the dough. For those of you new to this kind of dough, it's a bit like rubber when you play with it.  Not that soft "bread dough" you might me used to. 
Now the trick is not to eat them all at once. Will be making them again soon.

Quick, easy.  Only thing that almost deterred me is having the yeast listed in terms of tsp as opposed to packets.  I scaled the recipe to make 7 pretzels which corresponded to 1 packet of yeast.

The only ingredient I changed was to add 3 to 3 1/2 cups flour instead of the full 5 because that is what my dough would accept. The pretzels turned out too soft and sweet. I prefer the crispiness and flavor of the mall pretzels from this website, though they did taste better after they cooled and my family enjoyed them.

I tried this today. My son and I are gluten free. I used Bob's Red Mill all purpose baking flour and one teaspoon of xanthan gum. When we were ready. I did not put it in the water solution right away. I baked them on a silpat for about 5 mintues, then used a slotted spoon to dip and coat them in the hot water for a few seconds. After all the pretzels were dipped in the solution, I spread melted butter and salt on them and I baked for another five minutes. Perfect!

Love this recipe!  I agree with everyone about not adding all the flour at once.  Definitely let the dough rise as mentioned but also after you've formed the pretzel shapes.  Still trying to figure out how to get that crispy outside...

Requires more water than indicated, and honestly, I can't find where the butter is in this recipe for it to be called "buttery." Not in ingredient list, not in directions. Just mentioned by reviewers and in the description. Weird. So I add about 4 tablespoons to the dough and another 1/4-1/3 cup of water. They do come out quite delicious, soft, and chewy with these additions.

This is a good recipe.  I made it according to the recipe and I will make the following changes listed in some of the other reviews:  I will try to roll them thinner/longer, cook it at a slightly lower temperature to cook the middle better, and try using 4 cups of flour (as i had to add quite a bit of water to get the dough right).  Good with butter and salt; and butter, cinnamon, and sugar

This is an awesome recipe, and very easy.  I brushed the finished pretzels with melted butter, and that made the slightly over-browned bottom good as well.

These pretzels were good and the dough was very easy to work with.  I used 4 cups of flour and that was plenty.  I did have problems with them sticking to the pan.  Greased, ungreased, parchment paper, greased parchment paper - didn't matter - they stuck to the pans.  I even tried "drying" them off slightly from the soda bath, but they still stuck.

I am not a baker by any means, I can barely make chocolate chip cookies,  so I was very intimidated at the thought of making pretzels from scratch. But I just recently moved overseas and was craving them for some American comfort-the first bite I almost cried! they turned out! This is so easy it is hard to mess up! I followed the recipe exactly and just put the pretzels on the top rack to bake. I have made over 100 pretzels in about 2 weeks and every batch has been amazing. Thank you!

These were awesome!  Took suggestions of others - 4 cups flour, lower oven temp (400), used bread machine for all the work, placed them on a towel when removing from hot water.  Definitely a keeper!!!  By the way, if you are a first timer making this recipe and are considering halving the recipe due to uncertainty, DON'T. They are so delicious that you will consume them all!

Delicious! Made these for the new year and the kids devoured them! I did have to add the extra water when following the recipe exactly. I boiled my water and baking soda mixture to ensure that it stayed warm. Lining the cookie sheet with parchment paper made for a quick and easy clean up. We will be making these again!

Not bad overall - but making the actual pretzel shape is more difficult than it looks!

This is an amazing recipe, I always like the mall pretzels, so we decided to give this a try. It tasted better and it was lots of fun to make with my six year old.

These are amazing!  Only thing I would recommend is adding 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup that is called for.  Also, I kept them in the oven for about 9 minutes instead of the 8 minutes the directions say.  This browned them a little more and gave them a nice crisp.  If you love getting these on Oktoberfest, don't waste your money anymore.  MAKE THESE!!!

YUM! Some notes: Kneading bread is often most successful done by hand, imo. You can feel when the dough is right.  Start with four cups of flour mix ingrediants in as directed. Just until it starts to form a ball and pulls away from the sides (think a messy knot not a smooth ball)Dump mixture onto a surface floured with a cup of flour sprad out knead mixture incorporating extra flour whenever it gets sticky for about 7-10minutes. Really get in there and grab and tear and push and fold. Depending on weather and altitude this may be enough. If the dough is not springy to touch and smooth  add a bit more up to the 6 cups in the recipe. (Bread dough isn't desgned as a specific measurement what works for one person will not always work every time you can't just treat it like a cake). After kneading let it rise as suggested.  One alternative to dipping pretzels is bathing them in the baking soda solution for 2 minutes (they get that really dark brown pretty color from this). Just let them soak and spoon the mixture up and over. When I picked them up I placed them in my hand with a paper towel on it to absorb some of the excess water (don't wrap it around just put the paper flat hold your hand flat put pretzel on flat hand for a second then move to baking sheet). I let them sit about 20 minutes then put in oven at 400 on middle and top racks for 5 minutes switched pans to the other rack baked 5 mins more. Moved to rack and spooned 3 tblspoons unsalted butter over all. To DIE FOR!!

Fantastic! I loved how the dough is slightly sweet. I followed the recipe exactly except that instead of just dunking the pretzels in the baking soda solution, I diluted the solution a bit, brought it to a boil and boiled each pretzel individually for about 30 seconds.
I divided the dough into 8 portions and baked them at 450 for 12 minutes.

Really tasty. Make sure to roll these out as long as you can, because mine, while delicious, were too doughy. Browned nicely though.

These were decent. I admit Im not a baker by any means. I think these would be great with more practice. Its kind of a lot to make a whole doughball, roll it out, etc. I overcooked on accident so mine came out too hard and chewy (my own fault). I may make these again.

I LOVE pretzels, so finding this recipe made me so happy!
 
However the amount of flour is ridiculous. You need half the amount. 
I used the 6 cups and the dough wouldn't form, so I made double the yeast mixture and it evened it out. 

But they tasted fabulous and are definitely better than store bought pretzels!

After reading the other reviews and recommendations I only used 3 cups of flour and it was enough. I also ensured the pretzels baked on the middle-high rack to prevent burning on the bottoms of the pretzels. I also baked it at 415F as a reviewer suggested.

The prezels turned out so well! They don't look perfect but I'm sure it takes practise to roll them out and twist them very nicely.

Excellent .The only thing we did different was to make pretzel bits instead of the full pretzels . When they came out of the oven we brushed the melted butter on them , then salted .

Wow, I had high hopes for this recipe. At first, the dough was far too dry and the 1 to 2 tablespoons of water did absolutely nothing. I tried adding even more water, a WHOLE LOT, and it barely made the dough any better. Then, the dough would not rise! I let it rise for two hours, and it barely rose at all and dried out! Hardly none of the dough was salvageable so I tossed the lot of it. A waste of time. I am open to trying it again but the recipe as it is seems flawed to me. Maybe I did something wrong but that's not like me. 0/10 would not recommend as is.

This pretzel recipe was delicious. After making it though, I decided next time, I will brush with egg before salting then cooking. I really do love the shine and texture an egg coating gives pretzels.

Wonderful! I have never made pretzels before and these were perfect.  I followed some advice from other reviews and baked them at 430 instead and brushed them with butter before sprinkling the salt and baking. I also put a glass of hot water in the oven and covered the bowl with a damp towel during the rising time.  Absolutely delicious I will definitely be making more I just hope they will be as great the second day as they are fresh!

Easier said than done :( My dough never got to the right consistency... after lot's and lots... and LOTS of trying (stirring by hand), I gave up and made a few pretzels. They came out super doughy in the middle. So I made pretzel sticks which didn't have a very authentic pretzel taste, but my kids did happily eat them since we had some cheese sauce to dip them in. More effort than it was worth. Might be better with an electric mixer (???).

i made this and followed people reviews  use 3 cups of flour then add more as you kneed the dough, also i found the 4 cups of water and baking soda is excessive and wasteful, i used one cup of water with 2 tbsp of baking soda and it came out just perfect and tastey

The recipe is just plain wrong.  It's no surprise so many reviewers say, "I just added flour until..." because the recipe calls for far too much water.

Really easy to make and very versatile. I bake them as directed, with a bit more water to make up for the extra flour, and dip them in butter and cinnamon sugar after. My boyfriend loves these and will eat the dough raw. I want to try dipping them in sesame seeds too.

I have made at least 5 different pretzel recipes recently,  trying to find a good one and this is it! The search is now over, they didn't even make it  an hour out of the oven.

2013: Everyone loved these pretzels!! I had a hard time rolling the dough into long enough lengths to twist the pretzels, but that is my own lack of coordination. These made great Christmas goody bag stuffers!
Update 2015: I did much better rolling my dought this time, even with a broken finger! I love these just out of the oven because the crust is just crunchy enough and the inside is soft. I am using them again for goody bags. Great recipe!! Especially if you brush them with melted butter as soon as they are out of the oven.

Made these today. Let the rise in the oven while we went to the pool and baked them when we got back. Used only 4 C of the flour with maybe 1/4 sprinkled extra while it was kneading in mixer. The dough refused to go into any shape so I rolled out and cut into the pretzel bites my kiddo loves instead. Very good recipe. Will definitely make often.

This recipe is excellent!
Made a half dozen to be on the safe side and wished I had made the dozen. Easy. A couple of tips. Make sure you proof your yeast accordingly. I let my dough rise with a moist paper towel and plastic wrap on the dryer (multi task )Keep the moist paper towel on the dough while you role and work with the dough.They are Delicious right out the oven with butter brushed on them.

These are the best!  Way too much flour though.  Start with 4 c and add from there.  I also decided to make mini pretzel sticks.  They were about 1 1/2" around and 2-3" long. Making the sticks, I was able to make around 18 to 20 instead of the recommended 12.  The first time I made them I foolishly added all 5 cups of flour and there was so much I couldn't roll the dough out.  I almost threw the batch away but decided to make it, this is when I made the sticks, by squeezing the dough instead of rolling it; even with too much flour, they were still very good.  I have since figured out how the dough should feel.  I usually make 2 batches in a day (not a double batch, double batches often don't work and I don't want to waste all the ingredients).  My husband and kids are always begging me to make more and I am always willing to oblige!

Woke up this morning at 4:00 a.m. Checked out my daily e-mail from All Recipes and found this one. Since the hubby and I both LOVE pretzels and I had all the ingredients on hand I decided to give it a "twist & try"! I always read the reviews first and like others I cut down the flour to 4 cups but followed recipe exactly after that until coming to the baking soda solution. I just used 2 tsp. baking soda and 1 cup water (as suggested by another reviewer) and periodically warmed it up in the micro when it cooled down or between batches. Hubby loved them and he is EXTREMELY picky! I think we have a keeper except I really, really, really need practice at "twisting a pretzel". (as you can see by my photo)! Thanks!!!

This recipe is perfect. I make snacks like this and my wife will try but not ususally interested after that. She has had one each day for three days and raved about them each time. Perfect recipe. Will make again.

Very good, thanks to the suggestions of other reviewers! I only used 3.5 cups of bread flour and that was plenty. I also only baked for about 9 minutes at 400. 
I decided to make half cinnamon sugar, and the other half garlic salt. They didn't last long.
 These are very close to the pretzels I love in the mall!

My five-year old son and I made these delicious, melt-in-your mouth, fluffy, soft pretzels today!  The recipe is very easy to follow and worked very well for a novice breadmaker, like me.  I followed many of the reviewers' suggestion to decrease the amount of flour, so I used 4 cups, but I still found the dough to be a bit dry.  To compensate, I had to add approximately 1 tablespoon of water, which made the dough pull together quite nicely.  Out of the oven, we brushed the tops with butter and sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar.  My husband declared that these pretzels are much better than the mall pretzels!

First time making pretzels and they turned out delicious! :) Once they were done cooking I put some melted butter on them and sprinkled with some italian seasoning and others with cinnamon sugar.

Yumyum! I love soft pretzels so I decided to give these a try.
I made a few small adjustments, and they turned out great!
1. I only used three cups of flour, but when I kneaded, I sprinkled a little more on every few minutes until the dough was no longer sticky.
2. I used mostly whole-wheat flour, which bumped up the overall healthiness and (I don't think) made them taste any worse.
3. I used 2 cups water and 1/4 Baking soda for the bath.
TIP: Use a thermometer to make sure your water for the yeast mixture is warm enough.
Boil the water lightly when making the baking soda mix, it will dissolve very easily.
After dipping them in the mix, let them drip for a second or two over the bowl before placing them on the pan, it will make cleaning easier. 
Melt butter and dip the pretzels in it for a tasty treat.
Put your oven at 325* instead, the bottoms will not be so brown.

Made this today with my three granddaughters, ages 6-8, and they loved it.  Very easy to make and they had fun shaping the pretzels in fun shapes.  I had to add the extra water to the dough because I had not read the reviews that suggested cutting back the flour a little.  Next time I will do that.  Also, I used 2 c. hot water and 1/4 c. of baking soda for the wash before baking and it worked fine.

I really liked the flavor of these pretzels and they were pretty easy to make. I just wish that they were came out less puffy, if that makes sense because the traditional pretzels are thin and the coating on the outside is hard, while the inside is soft and chewy.  I did not get that from this recipe.  Maybe I did something wrong, but looking at all the pix submitted, I realize that their pretzels looked a lot like mine.  I was hoping for something different and I will continue to search for the best pretzel recipe out there.  Again, these taste good, but are not the consistency I am looking for.  These might need less yeast so that they are not as puffy and hold their safe better.

These were a great treat!  I liked them as did my family.  As did my 4 year old's preschool class.  Only thing I did differently, I was afraid of adding too much flour because of other reviews, I added only about 3 cups of flour per recipe.....so the one I trippled, I only used about 9-10 cups of flour.  Maybe I should have followed directions and just added water as needed but I followed other reviewers suggestions.  And they turned out delicious.  Thanks.

Followed the recipe step by step and I was very disappointed. I added almost a full cup of water until it was pliable but it still was very tough and it only rose a 1/4 of the size. I baked them for my sons 1st birthday and every one loved them, but I think they were being kind.

Fabulous! Will make again for sure. When pretzels cooled I made open-faced sandwiches. May even borrow this recipe to make pretzel rolls for burgers, etc. GREAT RECIPE. Shorten the flour to 4 cps to start!

Amazing and simple to make! My children LOVE these as afterschool snacks! I pair them with either cheese sauce or even just butter. Amazingly delish, and for a novice "yeast" user like me they turned out great the first time. I would only watch them closely when you bake them, oven times do vary as do batch by batch. I check on them every few minutes untill they are done.

Excellent recipe. Great flavor. I do recommend following advice of other people who have left a comment by reducing flour, substituting the oil with butter, and by rolling out dough thinner than what you would think. I had success with the dough the thickness of my smallest finger.                                      I also had great success in melting down 1/4 cup of butter, adding 1/4-1/2 tsp of garlic powder and basted the pretzels right out of the oven before I salted. Yum!

These pretzels were wonderful. We coated some with cinnamon and sugar, some with parmasean and garlic salt, and stuffed some with pizza sauce, cheese and pepperoni. They were all a huge hit. And the kids loved helping make them.

Definitely too much flour.  I would start with 3 1/2 and work up or use more water and yeast mix.  I am going to try it in my bread maker next time. The cooking time didn't seem long enough for me.  I will try for at least 15 mins the next time I try this.  Not a bad starter recipe though!

Wonderful recipe, easy and very tasty. I didnt use all the flour, started with 3 cups and added about 1/2 cup more. Also a great tip is the ones you dont eat right away are fantastic cut in half and toasted with butter, like a bagel. Yum Yum!

This recipe is a must use! I lessen the amount of flour by a cup so I only used 4 cups of flour. Also, I suggest that you wait for the dough to rise for about 1 and a half to 2 hours to make it more chewy. I dipped the baked pretzels in butter and then added Parmesan! So good (:

I put this in the bread machine on dough and was surprised at how delicious they turned out.  Baked them on a cookie sheet coated with butter.  OMG!  Can't wait to make these again.  I cut the recipe in half to fit in the bread machine and had no problem with dough being too dry.

My family and I didn't really care for these (we LOVE pretzelmaker).  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, as everything seemed to be going well, and I followed the recipe as stated except I used 4 cups of flour instead of five.  My dough was nice and pliable, and rose very well.  The pretzels were easy to roll out.  The problem was that the bottoms burned before they seemed cooked.  The pretzels ended up quite gooey in the middle, but burnt on the outside.  I tried lowering the oven temp to 400 and raising the rack, but it didn't help.  They still tasted okay once slathered in butter and salt, but I won't be making these again.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  It is a bit tedious, but all steps are essential to get that perfect traditional pretzel taste.  I've made this recipe twice now, and the first time I didn't pull the dough enough and had trouble forming pretzels, but the second time it was perfect.  Soo good and received many compliments: "these are home made?!"

Another great alternative is to mix sugar, salt and brown sugar together and sprinkle that on top to make a 'sweet' version.

Thank you for the great recipe!

These were awesome. Perfect as the recipe described. After they were done, I rubbed some butter on them and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over them. :) Thanks for posting, this recipe turned out great and is a lot simpler than many other soft pretzel recipes I have found on the internet.

We had fun making these, and they turned out great.  We would have rated a 5, but they do have a bit much flour making them hard to roll out.  Other than needing to adjust the recipe for that, we had fun, they taste great and we added some great toppings like parmesean, cin. sugar, and salt.  Next time we plan to wrap hot dogs for some variety.  Good family project as well.

I used this recipe once before and I decided that while I'm back again for the recipe I should rate it. I followed the recipe exactly and there isn't any way to make these better in my opinion. They taste just like auntie annes at the mall except they don't cost a few bucks each to make. I dipped these in clarified butter and sprinkled with course salt just like the mall store does. MMmmmm!!!

Great recipe. These are so easy to make and my family loves them. I make half with cinnamon sugar and half kosher salted pretzels. They are best straight out of the oven, but also freeze really well.

First time I made pretzels. They were AWESOME. Made traditional salt, cinnamon and sugar, and cheese and garlic. Definitely recommend buying cheese dip and making a simple glaze frosting. Also recommend rolling the dough into 1/2" size.

We live in Germany and have come to love pretzels that are still made by boiling in lye solution instead of baking soda...but there is only so many you can eat.  These are so easy to make but I can't seem to make them fast enough, they disappear before i know it!  The recipe is very close to German pretzels and can be topped any way you like.  My daughter and wife prefer them brushed with melted butter then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar while my son and I like them naked or with a touch of salt. We also have made sandwich rolls out of them, a nice change of pace over regular bread.

I went to a football game with my family and bought something like this.  The pretzels that i bought were a little larger, but they tasted exactly the same!  They were amazing!  what I did to tweak the recipe a bit was, after the dough was made, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubled its size.  Then, after you shape the pretzels, dip them in a baking soda mixture, then let it rise again for about an hour.  After you bake it, dip it in melted butter right away and viola!  Delicious pretzels!

OK, after all is  said and done, these were good.  I made the whole recipe exactly as is, no problems.  Dipped them in melted butter when they came out of the oven and sprinkled generously with cinnamon sugar.  Oh, the only change I made was 415 degrees for exactly 9 minutes on parchment paper, middle rack.  Perfect doneness, not too brown, a tiny bit chewy/doughy, soft and delicious!

I am not a baker, but this recipe was easy to follow and the pretzels came out fantastic.  I tried them with cinnamon/sugar and they were a huge hit.  If you choose to add cinnamon/sugar to the tops of your pretzels, make sure to do it on a separate surface other than your baking sheet.   Otherwise it will get on your baking sheet (no matter how careful you are) and burn the bottoms of your pretzels.

For Halloween Trick-or-treaters I decided to hand out pretzels along with candy and caramel apples, and this is the pretzel recipe I went to. They turned out excellent! Definitely one of my new favorite recipes. It's pretty simple and they tasted amazing. I ended up going with the full amount of flour listed in the recipe, just to make sure I made enough. The only changes I made were that I used butter instead of oil, and I cut the sugar down a little (1/4-1/3cup, I think). The dough ended up baking quite large even after rolling the strands of dough out very small, so if you're looking for small and neat pretzels, make sure you roll them very thin (Maybe pinky-finger size or smaller). They still tasted great, and I'm looking forward to making another batch soon!

Followed the recipe as is and the dough was so crumbly and dry, added the extra 2 table spoons of water and still too dry. So I kept adding until not crumbly and then finished off. The dough was thick and hard to roll out so I make pretzel breadsticks. They have a pretzel taste and would be great with nacho cheese.

After reading the user reviews and suggestions I made the following modifications. Changed the 5 cups of flour to 3 and 1/2 cups of flour. Changed the 1/2 cup of white sugar to 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Turned on the oven and then turned it off to get it slightly warm. Covered the bowl with a damp kitchen towel instead of the plastic wrap. Let sit in dark oven for 1.5 hours. Rolled the twists very long and thin. This allowed them to be airier. The rest of the recipe and directions I kept the same. I would possibly reduce the salt to 1 tsp for preference but its not necessary. For the ones we ate right away, I covered them in butter and dipped into a cinnamon and sugar mix. I also made a frosting drizzle using 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and 2-3tbs of half and half. These were amazing. Tasted just like any warm soft pretzel you would find in the mall. Keeping the modifications I would make these again.

Good recipe and tastes just like mall pretzels!  My fiance loved them!  However I did make adjustments according to some of the previous reviews:  kosher salt in the dough, decreased the flour (I used 4 cups and still had to add bit of extra water), covered the dough with a damp kitchen towel, lowered the temp to 400F, and brushed the pretzels with melted butter straight out of the oven.  I also used 1/3 cup sugar in the dough.  One important note--USE PARCHMENT PAPER.  I baked the first set of pretzels on a greased baking sheet and they completely stuck to the sheet!  So, I used lightly greased parchment paper for the second set and they came off just fine.  Also, I think the amount of the baking soda solution is wasteful--4 cups is excessive.  Next time I'll halve the solution--2 cups hot water with 1/4 cup of baking soda.  Thanks for the recipe!

My friend and I loved these pretzels! The dough was so soft and manageable. I made smaller pretzels so I kept the heat lower than stated at about 325-350! When they were finished I added melted butter to each and dipped into a cinnamon sugar mixture :)

This was the easiest recipe and they really do taste as good or better than the mall!  My husband who doesn't really enjoy the mall pretzels said they were the best he ever tasted!   After the yeast mixture bubbled, I through everything in the Kitchen Aid with the hook attachment and let it rip for about 7-8 minutes.  EASY!!!  Kneading is the hardest part of bread :)

Great tasting pretzels. I agree with the other reviewers - far too much flour. I ended up adding 1/2 cup of water to get the right consistency for the dough instead of the recommended 1-2 tablespoons. Turned out fine though - chewy and bread like on the inside and crusty and salty on the outside. Worth noting that I used sea-salt instead of kosher salt as that's all my local supermarket has! I shall definitely make these again.

This recipe was fantastic! I generally have the worst luck with yeast but my pretzels came out amazing!! I did cut the sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup and they are just delicious!! I didn't have to add any flour, just  afew drops of water to make the dough perfect. Thanks fo a GREAT recipe! I look forward to making it again and again!

The baking soda wash made for a great flavor and made it so that I could watch them brown in the oven which was great but I was dissapointed that these were still more like bread sticks for me. Maybe it was my own fault for putting the ingredients in the bread machine and setting it to dough cycle. I will make this again but wish that there was a nicer glazing on them. I think maybe I will try also putting on an egg wash. I also thought that this had too much flour. At first I figured it was because they were pretzels and that the dough should be quite dense. Now I think I agree that it is too much and will try 3 cups as others have suggested.

Wonderful recipe! I do use less flour and more oil. They are wonderful with just salt but I also really like to braid them and top with butter and cinnamon sugar. I even used a quarter whole wheat flour and brown sugar and they were slightly healthier but just as delicious.

While I wouldn't call these better than those from the mall, they are really good and a lot of fun to make. My husband and I took some time on this nice fall day to make them while enjoying one another's company. 

I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil (since that's what I had on hand) and only used 4 cups of flour - even with four cups I found that I had to add a tablespoon of water. 

While the recipe ingredients do not call for butter, if you look to the right of the photo in the recipe, Christa mentions dipping them in butter (I brushed the tops of mine) to get the buttery flavor.

Turned out soft and tasted like pretzels! Definitely worth the time it takes to  make them. Also I estimated the price of each pretzel... about 25 cents! Amazing!

I made this in a bread machine, following reviews about using less (bread) flour and subbing margarine for oil. They look perfect,like many of the photos, but the texture inside is too soft for a pretzel- not chewy at all. Perhaps it was because they are not dipped in hot, simmering water for a minute first. Also, next time I will definitely cut back on the salt topping, since the coarse sea salt I used was a bit too crunchy and salty for my taste. I don't normally give a less-than-perfect rating for a recipe I didn't follow exactly, but if you're looking for a chewy soft pretzel, this probably isn't it- unless using the bread machine to make the dough and let it rise is the reason for the soft dough. Otherwise, they were tasty and will definitely not go to waste!

I made these many times even with whole wheat flour (as expected, not as soft). I use more less flour depending on moisture level in my surrounding atmosphere; as with all baking. I like it a little less sweet,no I used only 1/3 cup. I also made them in all sort shapes, mini loaf of bread, and even braided it. 
If you make them to fit your toaster, it makes for a quick snack directly from frozen.

Excellent recipe & I really enjoyed being able to watch the video before I attempted the recipe.  

I sprinkled poppyseeds and sesame seeds onto the pretzels instead of Kosher Salt - it made a great change.

Thank-you so much for a great recipe!!

I loved these..a lot of people were saying that 5 cups of flour was too much but it was fine for me... Shaping the pretzels is rather hard but circle pretzels are just as good

Only started reading reviews after I made the dough and was waiting for it to rise- note to self-read reviews first!!!!!, and had already learned the flour water ratio was terribly off and adjusted with quite a bit more water (at least half a cup). dough did rise, but was still difficult to work with, made 6 'pretzels' before i decided to make the rest into dinner rolls. baked at 400 for about 10 min, till golden brown-drizzled with butter...still raw inside though, blah. baked another 6 min until very toasty brown....still not really that well cooked and just kind of a knot of dough. was an absolute disaster- i do a lot of baking and have never had this much trouble before.  ended up just tearing it all into pieces and now drying out a bit in oven to make a bread pudding.

I made this recipe today - so easy to make.  I am not partial to too much salt so I sprinkle them with sesame seeds instead and they were yummy.  Love them - will definately make them again...
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These Pretzels were delicious! Just follow the recipe and it works great, of course I watched the video and it says to add extra water if needed and butter right after you get them out of oven. They were easy to make and I will tell my family and friends about them:}

These pretzels were really good. The only reason for the 4 stars is because the recipe called for way too much flour...I used about 3.5 cups. The dough was really hard to roll into long strips so I made pretzel circles (which was not a problem at all). The temp was also a bit too high. I cooked them at 415.
Thank you for the great recipe! :)

They were amazing and fun to make.  I made six of them  with a melted butter and cinnamon sugar topping and the other with olive oil and salt topping.  My daughter had a friend over and I wanted to make something american since we live in Norway.  My daughter ate two and her friend had three.

Have never made pretzels or bread before and these came out perfect for me!
Delicious with Cinnamon Sugar, but I like to stuff mine with Nutella and sprinkle with dessicated coconut after dipping in the baking soda solution, tastes like a yummy Bounty bar!
I do find that the next day, Cinnamon Sugar pretzels are a little soggy (due to brushing with butter?) - got around this by freezing after cooling and zapping in the microwave when needed.

Awesome! My first attempt left me speechless. (I couldn't stop eating them!) I will be making these again and again. Next time I will use my stand mixer to do the kneading. SOOOOO happy I found this recipe. My daughter who is devouted to Auntie Anne's pretzels liked these just as much. I just need to find some sour cream and onion seasoning to make it perfect for her.

Great recipe, a little hard to work, but delish none the less.  I am only giving these 4 stars because I think they are a little heavier than an "Auntie Annie's pretzel" but will keep working with it to get it perfect!

Came out nice and soft. Only problem I had was rolling them out.. It took a lot longer to roll them out than I thought. You have to roll them really thin because it will rise as it bakes. This is super easy and I'll definitely make this again!!

Great recipe. The only problem was that after so much work making them, they did not stay around long enough as they tasted so good!

Amazingly easy and amazingly YUMMY!!! Thanks for an awesome recipe! Me ENTIRE family loves them and thinks that they are better than the ones in the mall. I did notice that when making the dough it helped to add in the last 1/2 cup of flour and the extra water slowly after the rest of the flour and ingredients were mixed! Thanks again! I Love it!!!! ;)

A great recipe! Though I only used slightly less then a 1/2 Cup of sugar. These came out so good! Much better tasting the the mall/store ones, at least you know they are fresh. lol My mother, Niece, Father and I each ate 2 a piece! Stil wanted more. So fluffy and light. The only reason that I rated this a 4 was because they didnt come out as crispy as i thought they would. So drool worthy!!!!

These pretzels are very good, but I like a "Good Eats" Alton Brown soft pretzel recipe just a bit better.  I might try to merge the 2 recipes together as I like the sweetness of these :)  Overall something yummy to try and they will be a hit!  I didn't find them hard to make (even though I am far from an advanced baker) The worst part about them is the clean up afterward!  My kids have them devoured by the time the kitchen is clean!

These are always a huge hit, and gone very fast!  I love them, but don't make them too much because they are a little labor-intensive.  Definitely worth the effort though!

OHMIGOSH! This is the best pretzels I have ever tasted besides the mall's! I made this with a cheese dip (2 tbs. Butter. Melt. Add 1 cup milk. add 3 tbs flour. boil. add 1 1/2 cup cheese) and it was amazing. It brought back memories of when my mom, brother and I would eat the pretzels at the mall Amazing job!

Fantastic.
Consistency is great. Buttery and salty while also being a little sweet. Best recipe I've tried.

This recipe was simple and easy! Spent very little time doing anything! I only used 4 cups of flour and the dough was perfect. Don't skip the baking soda! I only brushed it on so I didn't get that crisp all the way around. I also cooked them for more than 8 minutes, I think 12. My husband approved! Would have been 5 stars but I think it calls for too much flour.

Seriously AMAZING! Make sure to dip them in the baking soda/water mix before putting them in the oven. That's what gives them the brown finish. We also really streched them out so they'd be big and thin like the ones at the mall. We doubled the recipe and froze them for later snacks. They're just as amazing out of the freezer. Never spending $3 on a pretzel at the mall again!!!

This is a perfect recipe for the first time pretzel maker.  Not to mention they taste just like a Hot Sam. (remember those?)  I baked them for a minute less and brushed them with a beaten egg yolk before baking ILO the salt.

This was my first time making pretzels and it took longer than I thought.  It took me an hour to roll 12 pretzels, my dough kept getting dry.  The flavor was excellent.  I would like to make these again because they tasted wonderful and my family liked them however will need to set aside more time.

I used them in a rope fashion instead of a pretzel form so they came out more like a soft bread stick. The flavor was wonderful (and I also added a little bit more sugar). They were even great the next day. I am making 100 of them for a children's event tomorrow. I hope they all love them too!

These pretzels are delicious! My house smells like the mall pretzel stands. I was easy on the salt and didn't use nearly as much as the recipe calls for..I just used a pinch or two on each pretzel. I brushed the pretzels with melted butter on the top and bottom as soon as I took them out of the oven. Perfect with cheese dip...my husband rates these 6 stars!!

These are just fantastic. Made a batch on Sunday and had to make more on Monday. The new batch will probably be gone too before the end of the day. This was so easy to make and tastes better then the ones we can get at the mall here, at least in this family's opinion. 
This is definitely a keeper and one that will probably become a weekly part of  my bread making. I didn't use the entire 5 cups of flour and I did have to add a wee bit more water when I was mixing it up. Other then that followed the recipe to a tee and they were perfect.

very tasty. just made my first batch. the only thing i did different is dampening the rolling surface and my hands. the dough would not roll into a "snake" with out it. It just kept pushing the dough around on the floured surface.

I actually wanted to make pretzel ROLLS, I had had them once and loved them. So I divided the dough then made round buns. Boiled them in the soda water for 30secs then sprinkled with salt and baked until a rich pretzel brown. They were shiny and crusty and soft inside like a roll but tasted like a pretzel! I skipped the butter, not needed.
Big hit!

These are very good, but not like the pretzels in MY mall.  Mr. Pretzel is the vender, and they do not use the baking soda bath before baking them, for one thing.  This recipe is good but not quite what I'd been hoping for.

Great recipe thank you for sharing!! This was my first experience using yeast and it was a pleasurable one. Simple and fun, I even got my 5yr old boy involved in shaping some of the pretzels. He had a blast making things and they cooked up great! I will definitely share this one. One tip is make sure the pans are very well greased to prevent sticking. Thanks again.

I have never reviewed anything on here yet, even though I use this website ALL the time.  However, after making these pretzels, I had to write something.  I have never been very successful at making any kind of bread at all, because they always turn out dry.  However, these were awesome! I did read some reviews and cut the flour down some and also used brown sugar, but other than that, I did everything exact, and WOW!  I didn't even bother to make pretzel shapes out of them, I just made balls and baked them to use with soup.

Short of cornbread and premade cookies/biscuits, I've never baked before. But after a late night craving for pretzels went unsatisfied, I decided to try making my own. 

I was worried about my first batch because the yeast I had was almost completely dead. When I proofed it, it barely foamed and the dough rose maybe a 1/4". I decided to push ahead because I had already mixed the flour, salt, and sugar. I didn't have any coarse kosher salt to give the pretzel that classic texture, but they surprisingly wound up tasting great. My roommate and I ate almost the whole dozen in a very short time.

I went to the store the next day and picked up some yeast and kosher salt and tried it again. This time the dough rose well, but unfortunately it was a bit too dry and I found it difficult to make the rope any thinner than about an inch. They still turned out really well and everybody loved them- they ware all gone by the next day! This has definitely turned me on to baking, I've already moved on to bread. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and brushed (really drenched) them with honey butter afterwards, and they were perfect.

Watching my youngest play, I realized my children have never had soft pretzels, so to allrecipes.com I went.  This in the only one I tried and yes, I did make a couple changes.  One, I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, the only change was cutting the flour to 4 cups and not needing the 1 tsp of sugar w/the yeast.  Two, I brushed w/butter after it was cooked and it made them definitely better.  The last 4 after brushing them, I sprinkled cin and sugar instead of salt.  Used table sea salt instead of kosher salt.  One of my sons fell off his chair when he started eating the cin and sugar one.  :-)

Very good taste but 1 1/4 cup water is not enough water for high altitude if you are using 5 cups flour. Needs another quarter cup of water (add a little at a time) to make sure dough is not too dry.

Absolutely delicious better than mall pretzels and a lot cheaper. My four year old and I made them together. Fun and very easy would be a great activity for a family on a rainy day. We will deffinately make these again.

This is THE best pretzel recipe I've ever tried! It's so easy to make and tastes delightful! I'm in love with it (: The pretzel expanded a lot and turned out so fluffy and soft. My whole family loved it too! I will definitely be using this recipe again. I also used the dough to wrap around hot dogs and then baked it; itwas delicious! The only thing I modified was using 4 1/3 cups of flour.

These came out PERFECT! I proofed the yeast, put all wet ingredients in my stand mixer with the dough hook and added flour until it was a pretty stiff dough. I also added a few ice cubes to the oven to make them crustier. Will be making these again and again!

Love love love this recipe! Delicious pretzels every time, and they're usually gone in a day or two. I usually melt butter and brush it over top of the pretzels with a basting brush before I salt them (they're more evil that way).

These were better than Auntie Anne's! So tender and delicious! However, I added the 2 tablespoons of water, and plus 1 more teaspoon because the dough was quite dry. Secondly, I used 4 cups of all-purpose flour, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, because I ran out of all-purpose flour. It worked just as well. I will definetly use this recipe again!

Use the big salt and follow the baking soda directions closely. Too much baking soda makes it bitter.

I made these with whole wheat flour and they were delicious. I put various toppings on them before baking: honey, garlic salt, cinnamon & sugar. My favorites were the honey and garlic salt ones.

These are a HIT everywhere I take them. And since I entertain with them, I like to use a pizza cutter and just cut them up into bite-sized squares. They're easier to eat, and everyone gets to have at least one! 
I use spicy brown mustard and then whip up a cream cheese/cinnamon dip, and they're always gone within minutes!

Such a great recipe! Instead of kosher salt, I brushed melted butter after they were done and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. I also made a sweet cream cheese dipping sauce! Delicious!

Very good recipe...to me nothing beats a hot pretzel from the mall but theses were for sure a very close second..I had to add about 1 cup more water because my dough was very dry, but they could have been something I did wrong? either way bake on the top rack and brush melted butter on tops when they come out, yummm !

These are great!  I had not made bread by hand in a long time (I usually use the breadmaker for mixing the dough) and so if I can get it to come out right, anyone can!  These were easy to make and delicious!  I did not use the recommended amount of salt though, just sprinkled on a little coarse sea salt on without measuring.  It seems like the whole amount would be WAY too much salt.

These pretzels are amazing! They taste like mall pretzels only they remain soft the next day (granted if not overbaked). My family added garlic to the melted butter and they loved it. I will make these pretzels again and won't have to pay mall prices.  Hooray!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't how "pretzel-like" these are, but the recipe makes an absolutely wonderful dough. I plan to use the dough again to make stuffed pockets, pizza, etc. It is a very workable, tasty dough. Thanks.

I have made these soft pretzels twice & my daughter loves them.  She doesn't want me to buy the frozen pretzels anymore, she wants me to make them for her from now on.   They freeze well, perfect for an afternoon or late night snack.

Great!  A couple important things.  Use the top rack of your oven and try baking at about 400 instead of the recommended temp.  Also, when rolling out the strips -- try to make them as thin as possible.  You really can't get them too thin.  When I did my first batch they were thick enough that they almost tasted like a dinner roll rather than a pretzel -- but when I made them thinner -- well, they were FANTASTIC.  Also, try the Beer Cheese Pretzel and Dip (dip only, obviously) that is on this site as well.  They go great together.

Just made these and think they were fabulous! Slight sweetness, oh so yummy.  Very simple to make.  Mixed the dough in my KitchenAid.  It is really dense, not like other bread dough I am used to, but they turned out great.  May cover with foil part way through next time as they browned a bit  too much for me.  Shortened time on the second batch and just slightly doughy where the dough touched, but still very very good.

Wonderful! I skipped the rise time (I think it is usually unnecessary) and we had soft warm pretzels in less than 30 minutes. I also used 3 cups of whole wheat and they were excellent! I used some of the dough to make pigs in a blanket and they were the best we've ever had. A wonderful, versatile, and quick (if you skip the rise time) dough recipe. This one is definitely going in the cookbook!! Thank you Christa.

Didn't have baking soda so couldn't do that step.  Cooked one plain and added cinnamon sugar after, those got sticky.  The ones with garlic salt baked on top were best flavor, but very dry, needed to be dipped in butter.  Make this again with the soda.

These were DELICIOUS!!!  The only change I made was to start with less flour (3 1/2 cups) and gradually add a little more if needed.  Brushing with melted butter after baking is another must!!  Next time I'm going to sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar and maybe add raisins to the dough!!!

Used a package of rapid rise yeast (2 1/4 tsp) since that's all I had and these still turned out amazing! Now I have to go out shopping or something before I sit and eat all of them this minute!

I'm not sure why this recipe is getting such great reviews, being that the water to flour ratio is incorrect. I added three cups of flour to the bowl with the dry ingredients and was expecting to add the other two cups after the wet ingredients were added, so I didn't make the dough too heavy right from the start. Turns out I never used the entire 2 cups I had put aside (except a tiny bit to flour my board while kneading). Without looking at other people reviews, I can see people having a very hard time with this dough.

I LOVE Auntie Anne's Pretzels and these come pretty close! I did make one change however. I used 4 cups of flour instead of 5. And was sure to do multiple coats of butter! One coat after baking for 3-4 minutes and the second coat after taking them out of the oven. PURE BUTTERY GOODNESS!! I made some jalapeno cheese variety as well! Which I think are best done in stick form. I first rolled the dough long, and cut into even sticks. Then I made small slits down the middle which I lined with some finely diced pickled jalapeno. Next, i covered them which shredded sharp cheddar cheese, no butter required! These were SOOOO DELICIOUS! and gone in seconds! I wish i had made more! But i will definitely be using this recipe again, however I will probably just make pretzel sticks--I personally think they are better portion sizing and they save time!

This is a great recipe. My family loves the mall pretzels and these are really close.     If you'd like a twist try turning these into hamburger buns.  After stretching/rolling them into ropes (slightly thicker than used for pretzels because you will need to slice it in two) loosely spiral them onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper into the size buns needed. Cover with damp towel and place in warmed oven (appx. 170) which has been turned off and allow them to rise a 2nd time for 15-20 minutes.     Finish out with the same process and bake at about 400 for 9-10 minutes. Time can very depending on size of bun so you will need to watch them. Lightly brush with melted butter.    Let them cool then slice in two to create bun.     You will never want to use a regular bun again. A WONDERFUL, flavorful change to the ordinary hamburger. WE LOVE IT!    Note: I did follow the advise of cutting back on the flour by 1/2 C. and kneading them slightly longer. I also use melted salted butter instead of oil. Also, I cooked on higher rack to avoid the bottom from over cooking.    I yeild 4-5 regular 4" buns out of a batch.

Very Impressed! So tasty, soft and light.   I used bread flour, rolled them out to about the diameter of my finger, brushed with melted butter at the end. These would make great pretzel rolls for sandwiches. Looking forward to adding other flavors! Better than the mall's pretzels!

These were fantastic!  So super easy to make (I only used 4 cups of flour per other reviewers) and they tasted even better than the often-stale mall version!!  I'm going to go make them again right now!

Oh, man. While I was mixing the dough, I thought, "this dough is so tough." I did add three more tablespoons more and used a little less flour. I still  worried while I was shaping the pretzels that the finished product would be a flop; the dough really was tough. But! When it came out of the oven, all my fears were put to rest. AMAZING. That's all I have to say. Soft and tasty. A definite do-again. And I might even wrap a hot dog in it! P.S. My baking soda bath probably wasn't too even because my pretzels didn't brown evenly. But that's the most minor detail, ever. Still a 5.

What I changed:  I used 1 1/2 cups warm water mixed with the yeast and I lowered the temp to 400.  These pretzels are AWESOME!  I also froze some after I dipped in the baking soda/water solution and they came out GREAT!  Perfect pretzels!!! Thanks so much for the recipe :)

Ok my first go around with these and my rope needed to be thinner. My dough felt very heavy which I'm not sure if it was supposed to fel like that.  Next time I may try less flour.  Either way they turned out good & there's only 5 left. We had some with cinnamon & sugar and some with nacho cheese.  Kids loved them and they were fairly easy to make. Would definately recommend these!

This recipe was great!! I made the dough and had my kids form it then I dipped them and baked them. It's a great after school activity and a snack! They really do taste like mall pretzels! I made the recipe exactly as directed.  In my case they took about 6.5 minutes (we made many smaller ones) and I used Italian seasoning on some of them. The kids couldn't get enough! We'll definitely be making these again!

I've made these a dozen times at least and they are always amazing. I use half whole wheat and half regular flour for a little more flavor.  My friends and I like to make pretzel bites instead of full sized ones because they're much easier to roll out and stick on a pan, you can eat so many of them, and they're more fun to dunk in frosting (milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar) after you cover them in butter and cinnamon sugar! Decadent dessert!

These pretzels were awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and the pretzels came out tasting just like the ones you get in the mall.  I think I am going to try my next batch with half whole wheat flour and half white flour.....I'll let you know how they turn out!

Yummy! I have made these twice now. I used 4 cups of flour and a little extra water. When rolling them out a used about 1/4 cup of flour.

I will never buy a mall pretzel again.  I just made these to take to a party...and I want to keep them for myself!  I used bread flour, not AP so I had to add a bit more water to it, next time I will use 4 cups to start and add the last cup as needed while kneading the dough.  Excellent recipe, thank you!

I thought these were great and easy to make. We had fun munching on them. My only suggestion is to baste with a bit of melted butter a few minutes before removing from the oven. They became more buttery and richer.

The taste was good but it is a lot of work to roll out the dough and so my pretzels came out a bit thicker that I would have liked. I used a store bought cin/sugar mix but should have made my own. Not bad, will try again.

These are fantastic.  When I mixed them up the dough was dry so I added a lot more water,  but no problems they came out great.  Next time I'm going to try and stuff a couple to see how that works out. Cheese with herb and garlic.  Or maybe a dessert pretzel stuffed with chocolate.  Can't wait to make them again.

I made this exactly as it said and they came out pretty good.  We dipped the finished product in clarified butter and grated parmesan.  The overall recipe was good, but I gave it 4 stars because they took a long time to make and were just "OK" for all that effort.

Great pretzels!  I love the sweet buttery flavor mixed with the salt.  They didn't last long out of the oven.  I did use less flour like others suggested.  I certainly need practice in making the pretzel shapes.  Next time I think I will try making sticks or bite sized pieces.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These pretzels were absolutely amazing! My friend and I made them and ate almost the whole batch. There was a bit too much flower in them, but I just added some milk until it came out to be a better texture. I think that instead of lessening the flower, adding just a bit of milk makes for a creamier dough anyway. Ours certainly came out nicely!!! They were devoured in one day. I'll DEFINITELY be making these again!

Awesome! Thank you for this recipe! I made the changes others had suggested, used only 4 cups of flour and baked at 400, for only 7 minutes, although I used a baking stone so that may have made the time difference. Everyone loves them!

Absoultely delicious!! The only thing I did different is use 3 1/2 cups if sugar in the dough and then I kneeded the other 1/2 in (as other reviewers suggeste). I did some with salt and some with cinnamon and sugar. They turned out fablous!! This will definantly be made many times in this house!

These are delicious! My DD & I are mall pretzel addicts and these are a great homemade substitute. Didn't use quite as much flour (3 1/4 cups) and made half as full pretzels and half as pretzel bites (DD's favorite). Per reviews lowered temp to 400 and 8 min was just right.  These will be a new treat in this house often!!

Whole wheat honey pretzels is what I made, using only whole wheat flour, and honey instead of sugar.  The taste is fantastic!  I'll be making more soon!

Tried these for the first time this weekend - WOW!  My family loved them.  They're the best fresh out of the oven with butter, but still good warmed up the next day.  Next time I think I'll try some sweet ones!

so yummy!! It took about 2 hours for the first rise, then i formed the pretzels and let them rise for about 45mins,I used simmering baking soda/water instead of just hot, and i dipped each pretzels in it for 10 seconds. Then I brushed them with butter before baking (careful then brown really quickly in oven!)  After baking i brushed them with butter again and sprinkled sea salt on top. Ive always wanted to make homemade pretzels! will definately make again :)

I made these as written in the bread machine on the dough cycle.  After they were dipped in the baking soda mixture, I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled with kosher salt.  I finished them off with a drizzle of butter when hot out of the oven.  Incredible!

Taste just like the ones you get ballparks, carnivals, & the expensive pretzel stores in the mall. My entire family loved them! I will be making these again.

Delicious, my only complaint is that I couldn't even come close to 5 cups of flour, so I did the moist mixture first, adding flour as I went and got as far as 3 1/2 cups, and it was perfect at that!

This was a fantastic recipe! I decided to use this to make hamburger buns rather then pretzels and they turned out perfect! Chewy and salty, the perfect flavor. I used sea salt and black sesame seeds instead of kosher salt, DELICIOUS!

I loved this recipe and it made a great snack for the family but since we don't live within 5 hours of a mall I don't really have anything to compare it to, as for the flour I used the whole amount and had no troubles but did add 2 tablespoons of water. I think the key is kneading the dough to incorporate the water I do the kneading by hand so I don't know if that has anything to do with it (I add bread making to part of my daily workout)

This was my first time making homemade pretzels. I didn't get the hang of rolling the pretzels until halfway through.  They turned out wonderfully. I salted four, lightly brushed butter and salted two, and brushed butter and cinnamon and sprinkled sugar over the rest. My boyfriend really enjoyed them. I will definitely make these again...probably in a double batch.

yummmmmy... the pretzelmaker can keep their pretzel because I can now bake my own fresh pretzels right at home. thankx christa. this is an awesome recipe. I tried the "mall pretzels" from this site.... but the dough wasn't as I would have liked it to be... it didnt have that 1/2 cup of sugar or tbsp of oil so it made a dryer, tougher dough.  I personally don't like to judge a recipe before I try it.... so with that said, this recipe was excatly like as it states it is.. "soft buttery pretzel" chewy and sweet.  didnt change a thing... I did  dip it into the soda solution for at least 10 sec. or longer like one review suggested. and I also sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar for an even more sweeter touch.  thankx again christa. amazing. UPdate:09/29/11 ......made again... using my kitchenaid this time... definetly use it if u own one..and well i did use 5 cups of flour but did need to add a little more water....i made small pretzels for my little girls hands...they were soooo delicious like always.. thank again

Love, love, love these pretzels.  Kids in Foods and Nutrition classes have such a fun time making, twisting and eating these.  We usually make both a mustard and a cheese dipping sauce to serve with them.  Have tried making this recipe using parchment paper rather than greasing a  baking sheet, but I don'recommend it as pretzels adhere like glue to paper.  Definitely give this recipe a try.

These were pretty good pretzles. I used about 4 cups of flour to begin with and added little by little more to the consistency of my liking. I baked for less than the 8 min otherwise they would have gotten burnt. I coated some with kosker salt, some cinnamon and sugar, but the best were the ones I put jalapenos and jack cheese on. The cheese didn't burn and they were this perfect chewy softness. Only con about these was that bottoms stuck to pan a wee bit, but not burnt... just really browned due to the baking soda and hot water solution.

These were good but not quite as great as I expected with all the great reviews stating they tasted better than the mall pretzels. The mall's is far better!! But if your in the mood for some quick pretzels without going out these wern't half bad. I made them exactly as the recipe stated with a few exceptions based on other reviewers. I used 4 cups of flour & cut the baking soda in half. I also baked at 415 rather than 450 & that was more than enough....450 would have burnt them! Once they were baked I brushed with melted butter & sprinkled cinnamin & sugar over them. They were nice & chewy! A nice treat for my hubby & I but no where near mall quality! I would still make them again though.

This is the third time I have tried to make pretzels, I haven't had any luck thus far.  I decided to change recipes and came across this one.  They came out perfect.  I made them per directions, except that I brushed the freshly baked pretzels with butter and sprinkled with coarse salt.  They were gone within minutes.  The entire family loved them.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this nearly as-is and they were absolutely amazing. I had never even thought of making home made pretzels until I saw this recipe featured. I used half AP flour and half 100% whole wheat flour. I also substituted the sugar with turbinado cane sugar, which is tastier and more healthy. Other than that, I followed this recipe to the letter and it blew me away. A couple of tips: DON'T change the baking temp, and bake for 8 minutes - no more, no less. Also, I did end up brushing them with melted butter, right out of the oven. They are so shiny, beautiful, and tasty. Oh and give your baking sheet a liberal greasing. Otherwise you'll be bagging chunks of pretzel :-)

These pretzels are awesome and very easy to make.  I made them for a dinner for 200 at our Senior's center. With the help of my sister and my teenage daughter, we baked over 230 in under 3 hours.  Everyone raved about them and requested the recipe.  I sent them to the allrecipes site.  Thank you for posting this one.

Had just found recipe yesterday which worked out real well because kids had a snow day today.  We spent our afternoon making these awesome pretzels.  The only extra thing I did was brush the tops with melted butter before adding the toppings (used salt on some and cinnamon sugar on others)If I could give them 6 stars I would...they did taste just as good or better as the ones from the mall!  Fun to make, fun to eat!  Didn't last long.

These are great!  I have never made these before.. was not sure I would be able to either.. but it was not that hard. I actually made the dough in my bread machine first, then took out and made the pretzles. Tip I learned was cut very small/skinny amount off to roll out.. not that easy to roll from a large chunk.  also had to actually roll out on sticky board.. not floured.. would not work for me that way.

These tasted awesome, but they lost a star because the soda water made them stick to the pan, even though I greased it. I think maybe I might need a better pan possibly. Otherwise they were excellent. I think next time I will divide them into 9 pieces and double the recipe however as they were a little small for my tastes. They puffed up beautifully and I also took the other reviewers advice and dipped them in butter after coming out of the oven. Good recipe for children...my son loved them!

I can't give it 5 (though I want to!) because I changed it a little.  OMG These are SO good!  They were gone in less than 5 minutes, the kids and adults all loved them.  I used 1 1/2 packets of yeast, 1 1/2 c water, a bit less than 1/2 c sugar, and 2 TBS melted butter in place of the veg oil... Oh and 4 1/2 c flour.  They were incredible!  I left some plain and the others I sprinkled with a mixture of parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and a tiny bit of black pepper (after brushing on melted butter when they came out of the baking soda bath).  If you're thinking about it, YES TRY IT!  I had no problems handling the dough and am not sure why others did.  I followed another's advice and mixed the sugar, yeast, salt, and water at first.  I added the melted butter, stirred, then added the flour.

These were AMAZING!I made them exactly as is and they were divine, my entire house smelled like Auntie Anne's Pretzel shop. The only change I made that I think is completely necessary is to melt a stick of unsalted butter. When you pull them out of the oven, drizzle the butter over them.    Remember these will puff up a bit when you bake them. Also, these are BEST straight out of the oven. I made these on a Saturday for work on Monday and they weren't quite as good.

I had a little difficulty when working with the dough but I think that was more my fault because I used white whole wheat flour. I just ended up adding more water while kneading and it was more manageable. In the end these ended up tasting really good and are very filling. After baking the pretzels, I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled half the batch with cinnamon sugar.

We make these at least once a week if not more often.  My kids love them.  They are so soft.  We like to brush them with melted butter after they come out of the oven.

Great recipe!!! You are right, these pretzels taste better than the ones at the mall.  I used 4 1/2 C. of flour instead of 5 C.  Everything else I kept the same.  Great recipe, Great taste !! Will make more shortly.  Thank-you

Yum.  Made these for lunch one day, anticipating that I wouldn't be able to stop eating them.  At least I saved calories by not eating them in addition to lunch =)  These were good.  Melted some butter and tried them with salt and mustard, and also with cinnamon sugar.  Also good cold, although the sweetness is more noticeable.  Not as chewy as I might have liked, but easy.  I would suggest rolling them the width of a dime or less as they do rise some.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY. I let my dough sit for an hour and a half. It did not rise at all. It was like a ball of rubber that peeled apart. I kept trying, I said what the heck, I'll bake it anyway just to see what happens. Well...my 6 year old that hates good food and only likes junk likes them. Thanks for sharing.

I LOVED these!!Not quite as good as Auntie Anne's but close,and much better than some of those other soft pretzel chains. I didn't dip them in butter at the end but they still tasted great. I had trouble getting them to stay pretzel shapes.next time i think i'll leave them as pretzel rods.

OMG! I can't stop eating these!  I am home with a sick kid, and decided to experiment.  These were so easy and FUN to make.  Don't skip the baking soda bath.  I forgot to do it on the sticks I made, and then couldn't figure out why they didn't brown up.  Also, roll your dough thin.  These puff up.  I did cook them on 425 for 10 min, and they were perfect.  Make sure to put a lot of oil in the pan.  They still tried to stick.

Yummy! Just like the ones at the mall, but best eaten fresh out of the oven. I added different toppings to them. Parmesan cheese, cinnamon and sugar were my two favorites.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These pretzels were easy to make and taste great. I had a hard time getting the pretzel shape to stay and not shrink back into a circular blob, so I made sticks instead...still delicious dipped in cheese or cinnamon sugar.

One of those recipes off the net that is good!  Gotten a few stinkers off the net before.  I make these all the time now, and they are always gobbled by the family within 24 hours.    Good recipe.  No fears with this one.  You follow the recipe right, you are going to end up with tasty soft pretzels.

Seriously amazing pretzels... soft & chewy on the inside with a browned crust on the outside that softens slightly with the butter.    Changes I made:  only used 4 cups flour (half unbleached white, half wheat), used brown sugar instead of white, and made this in the bread machine on dough cycle.  Absolute best topping HANDS DOWN was parmesan-garlic that I made by whizzing some fresh parmesan and garlic powder (the kind with parsley & herbs in) in a mini-food processor.  Sprinkle over the pretzels after you butter the tops.  The only change I would make is to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup.  They were just a bit too sweet (even with sweet toppings on, the sweetness was too much and tasted like sweet bread instead of a pretzel).  And I am a HUGE sweet lover!  Husband and party-goers were hovering near the stove to claim pretzels as they were coming out of the oven and gobbled them up as fast as I could get them made.  MAKE A DOUBLE BATCH...!!

These turned out great, but I found an alternate use for them.  I used a little less sugar and a little more yeast.  They proofed up big, round and fluffy.  Looking at them, I knew what I had to do...tonight I split them in half, toasted the halves and made some of the best cheeseburgers ever!  They made fabulous buns!

Thanks Christa for the excellent recipe! I just finished a batch of these less than 10 minutes ago and more than half of them have already been devoured by my family (although, I admit, I ate most of them)! One thing I recommend is to baste AFTER they come out of the oven, as the ones I basted before going into the oven still turned out to be a bit dry. I'll be making these again soon!

These pretzels are wonderful!  They taste like the ones you get at the mall.  I also basted them with butter before baking.  I made some with kosher salt and some with cinammon and sugar.  It's definitely a keeper!

After reading the reviews, I baked these at 415, and they came out perfectly.  I also trimmed a little of the flour in the mixing step, but rolled each pretzel "rope" in flour and it made them much more malleable and easy to shape.  Great recipe!

Awesome!  Easy (and I am not a baker).   I make the dough in my food processor and let it rise in a slightly warm oven for an hour.  If you let it rise too long then it's difficult to roll/shape them because they're too puffy.  They are addicting!  We've also made pretzel "bites" like at the mall.

Bread Machine Bakers:  It can be done!  I didn't make this recipe by hand, I actually stuck it all in the bread machine, following what I could recall of the manufaturer's instructions: liquid on the bottom, dry ingredients in the middle, yeast in a divet on top.  I let it mix and rise in the machine and it worked great!!!  (I did have to stop the machine before a second mixing, but it remained warm enough to rise the dough.)  SOOOO EASY!

YUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYY! These pretzels are fantastic. I AM NOT a baker, but these turned out excellent. I listened to other reviewers and only used 4 cups of flour. I also used quick rise yeast and let it sit for about 45 minutes. I found that if you want a more bready (Auntie Anne's) pretzel then you want to just dip the pretzels in the baking soda mix for about 5-10 seconds. If you want a more chewy (Pretzel Time) pretzel then you want to soak for 30 seconds to 1 minute. I put the salt on directly after the baking soda bath and it was fine. Only put salt on the ones you plan to eat that same day as they seem to soak in by the next day. You can freeze them, dip them in water and then sprinkle salt, this is what we did at the theme park, butter is not needed and water makes the salt stick better. This do taste buttery although there is no butter. FYI- Jalapeno Cheddar dip( .85) from Little Ceasars goes AMAZINGLY with this.

Good, but I could not get the dough to roll out like a rope. so I made them into nugets and used warmed cream cheese when served. I will try these again maybe spray them with butter before salting in place of Soda water, it seemed a little bitter.

Ok, so these were good, but I have two complaints.  One, why are they called buttery where there is no butter in the entire recipe?  I brushed it on after baking.  Two, the soda bath got all puddled under the pretzels and they were black underneath.  Ugh.  I read some review of another pretzel that said to toss the pretzel on a paper towel before putting on the baking sheet.  Just toss it on, on one side, for like 1 second.  Then that part is the bottom (the part that touched the towel).  Otherwise, these were pretty good. And really easy to make.  Like other reviewers said though--too much flour!  Altogether yummy tho!

Mmmm, soooo good! I mixed up the sugar, water, and yeast in a small bowl, and let it sit while I placed the dry ingredients in my bread machine. (I started with 4 cups of flour.) When the yeast mixture was ready, I added it to the bread machine and let it do it's thing for 4-5 minutes. I didn't need to add any more flour! They turned out so yummy, much better than the recipe I used to use!

This recipe is wonderful! I could not believe how fantastic they turned out. Not only were they good right out of the oven but we have been reheating them one at a time every day since and they're still delicious. I am awfully proud of myself for making my husband so happy with these pretzels, lol...but I should really thank this recipe!

I HAVE to give this recipe 5 stars.  It's incredible!  Just like the mall pretzels.  I highly recommend trying this recipe.  You will not be disappointed.  I brushed butter on them right out of the oven for an even more buttery taste.  Awesome!

Amazing!  My husband has NEVER liked soft pretzels and he ate two right out of the oven.  I brushed them with butter while hot and sprinkled half with cinnamon/sugar and the other half with a little more salt. I used high gluten flour, it should be noted that my dough did not rise quickly and never did double but was soft and easy to work with after an hour or so.  I will never pay for mall pretzels again!

These were very good and very simple!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I made them on stoneware pans, so they actually took longer to cook than the recipe states...maybe about 12-18 minutes in all.  And for those counting weight watchers points...by my calculations they seem to be about 5 points a piece...not bad for such a good snack!

These were delicious... the second time around! I didn't proof the yeast first time and think that batch must have been a dud. The second (good) batch I doubled the yeast and sugar while it proofed let a second rise after rolling out the dough and forming the pretzels. I boiled the pretzles for about a minute in the soda solution and used paper towels to get some of the water off before putting them on the baking tray. They came out golden and chewy inside, just the way we like them, and I brushed them with a little garlic powder mixed in with salted butter. Labour intensive, but delicious. I live in Egypt and can't get the "mall" pretzels here, so this was a nice treat to bring home a little closer, thanks for posting!

There was amazing!  I started out only using 4 cups of flour as others mentioned, and added a little more was it was getting mixed, probably no more than 1/2 cup.  I mixed it with my stand mixer and the dough hook, and just kneaded by hand for a little while.  There are easier to roll out without any flour on your counter.  I'm definitely making these again!

I started making these pretzels and I replaced the oil with butter and only used 4.5 cups of flour.  I'll admit that when I took them out of the oven I was thinking, these look terrible they're going to be awful.  But I tasted them and they are sinfully delicious!  Thank you for the recipe

This recipe was good.  I did not stray from the ingredients nor the directions.  I did have to add a minimum of 4 extra tablespoons of water during the mixing of the dough because I felt that it was too dry.  I think that we'll experiment with some cinnamon and sugar toppings next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

We make these pretzels a couple times a month.  We have experimented and found 1/4 cup of sugar is plenty for us.  We like to use less refined salt (sub an exotic like Pink Hawaiian etc)and we also sup butteer for oil.  My boys can't wait till dip em in melted velveeta or a good dipping oil and spices.  Well gotta go the timer just went off, proofing is done and time to roll the pretzels.

Absolutely love the recipe :0).  When my cousins visited me from Boston and Phoenix, I decided to pull out this recipe for some special bonding and baking time.  After putting cooking it, we were able to offer the whole family something delicious to munch on, and a memory to keep.

the recipe comes out better on some tries than others, though this may be my deficiency in kneading or waiting for it to rise enough. A big hit with everyone I share with, though.

AWESOME!!!!  My whole family loved them.  I followed other reviewers advice and cut the flour down to 4 cups.  Other than that, I changed nothing and they turned out great!  I'm positive I'll be asked to make these on a regular basis now.  Thanks!

I had a pretzel at the mall the other day for the first time in ages, and remembered how much I loved them. I thought there was no way I could make anything as good at home, but WOW, these are amazing! Other than reducing the amount of flour to 4 cups, I followed the directions exactly. I've already had 3 today, now I have to put some away for husband!

I had my doubts because I am such an Auntie Ann Pretzel lover, but these are every bit as good. I added melted butter to them right when they came out of the oven and they taste wonderful.  The thinner you roll them the better they'll turn out, if you don't roll them thin you run the risk of them being a bit doughy in places.  Also, I used five cups of flour but had to add way more water, I think you can get away with four cups.  These mess up the kitchen a bit, but are worth the clean up time.

Absolutely delicious!! Made exactly as written except followed other reviews and only used 4 cups of flour. Didn't have any problems with the dough. The family was waiting by the oven for these to come out. So, so good! Thanks for the post!

I had a little trouble getting the dough to form and ended up needing to add water. Because the dough was so hard to work with I ended up making Pretzel sticks instead. They still turned out pretty good. They were puffy and had a really nice flavor. I will probably try to makes these again

Very simple but refreshingly good! Thanks for sharing! I also brushed them with melted butter after they came out of the oven, very good.

These are awesome!  I've tried homemade pretzels before and been disappointed.  The baking soda/water process makes ALL the difference in how they turn out.  I made a double batch and used less flour than the recipe called for- 4 cups per batch instead of 5.  I put Kosher salt on some of the pretzels and sugar-in-the-raw and cinnamon on the others.  Both kinds were AWESOME!  Thanks for the great recipe.  My kids can't stop eating them.

It was my first time ever making pretzels and this recipe is great!!  The pretzels came out perfect and tasted great.  We topped some with salt and some with cinnamon and sugar.  We also wrapped the dough around hotdogs and made pretzel dogs!!

These pretzels are the best!! I made them exactly as the directions say, omitting one cup of flour, and they turned out delicious! I buttered mine and sprinkled them with salt,cinnamon sugar, and ranch dressing mix. YUM!

I love this recipe. I followed it to a "T". I had tried a different recipe a couple years back and it didn't turn out anywhere near as good as this one. The key is definitely the baking soda bath. My family devoured them! I definitely will use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Oh my gosh, these were so much fun to make and really good!  My 11yr old and I had a blast. Rolling the dough out to make the pretzel shape was a little hard for us but it had my daughter and me cracking up at the shapes we created.  Just the memories alone were great!  I used the parchment paper as instructed but, I wont next time b/c it didn't just peel off.  I've never seen parchment paper cook on like that before and we use it w/almost all of our baking.  Next time we will spray a baking sheet with Pam.  Aside from that, these were great and we will make them again!

I substituted the oil for butter and instead of the plain old cinnamon sugar or salt, I made an almond topping. All you need is to grind the almonds into the size of your liking (I used a food processor), add sugar to taste, and I added a bit of tiny butter pieces into there though I don't know if that had any effect on the outcome. Maybe because I'm impatient when kneading the dough to combine the ingredients that I found adding the extra 2 tablespoon of water necessary. And just to make my pretzels taste all good (but fattening), I brushed them with clarified butter right after taking them out of the oven. Just know that 8 minutes is all you need to bake these beauties.(I made two pretzels with a 3-serving size recipe and they came out done and gold). Thanks, Christa!

I only made these because a friend of mine was constantly buying the microwavable pretzels and I saw this recipe.  I have never been a big pretzel eater so it was only something to take to a super bowl party to me.  I have made them numerous times since.  I have not figured out how to make them as pretty as the malls, but they are eaten up immediately no matter how many I make.  Obsolutely delicious.

These are very good pretzels!I listened to some of the other reviews where they were suggesting you place the pretzels on wax or parchment paper so they won't stick. I'm sorry to say this didn't work out at all! I ended up peeling wax paper from the back of the pretzels. Just spraying the baking sheet with canola oil works just fine!

These pretzels were good, but not the best.  With additional toppings, I'm sure they would be very tasty.  I don't think they taste like Auntie Ann's, but then again I only get the salted ones as they're my family's favorite.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook and reduced flour to about 4 cups.  These are quite easy to make this way and I will make again.

This recipe is great, tastes just like the ones from the mall, and since there is no boiling involved, they're so easy! My husband loves pretzels, but since we live in Mexico, they're hard to come by. I make him these pretzels for a snack, or wrap them around hot dogs for him to take to work for his lunch.

These were very yummy, and I followed the advice of several others and only used 4 c. of flour.  I don't think I rolled them thin enough, though, because they baked up very thick and somewhat doughy in the middle.  Also, next time I will line my baking sheets with parchment paper because they got a little dark on the bottom.  But I will make this recipe again because they did taste great!

My daughter and I had a bit of a sweet tooth and decided to dredge the pretzels in cinnamon and sugar (splenda actually). They were delish!! We put the mix on before cooking, and sprinkled a little extra after applying the butter... warm and yummy!

I have been using this recipe for years now and there is not much to say except: these are near perfect! :) Years ago I used to labor for a mall pretzel shop and this is pretty much it! The only changes I seem to make is to add a little more oil and a little more water, and I rotate the pan halfway through so that they bake more evenly.  Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

I just made these and they did turn out quite well. The oven temp at 450 was too high, I turned down to 400 and baked for about 5-6 mintues to get a nice golden brown color. I thought maybe I wrote the recipe down wrong, as it called for 1/2 cup baking soda, but I checked and that was the recipe. Mine tasted like it was coated in baking soda, but other than that they were good. Next time I will use less baking soda in the water for dipping before baking. Maybe less sugar, as I want mine more savory instead of sweet. I used a dipping sauce of hot mustard (found on this website), but it did NOT work very well. When the vinegar in the mustard mixed with the soda solution on the pretzel it fizzed,and it fizzed in my mouth while chewing and down to my stomach....so I suggest buying the hot mustard from the store...which I will do asap!

I followed this recipe exactly (other then cutting it in half), these were perfect and were gone before they even cooled.  I used Hawaiian black salt which was very pretty.  Next time I'll try cinnamon and sugar on a few.

My family loves this recipe! I read a lot of the reviews and I agree with most of them. I used only 4 cups of flour and I thought they were a bit sugary but my family didn't mind. 450 was too hot, the first batch was brown on the outside and doughy in the middle. I turned it down to 400 and they were fine. We like dipping ours in cheese sauce, yum!

Awesome recipe!!  I've made these with my kitchenaid and I've also kneaded them by hand.  Came out much better when kneaded in kitchenaid.  Don't leave out the baking soda bath that's what makes the outside good.  Will make these over and over again!!

I didn't follow it exactly but it was still delicious. I used only whole wheat flour and next time I will use a sugar substitute.

These were wonderful. I made a double batch and worked them into little twists for my daughter to bring in for her class snack. The only changes we made were adding the butter that I used to grease my hands during the kneading process. (It was a touch dry, so I adjusted) Also, we boiled our baking soda mix, and let the pretzels boil until they floated (10 seconds) and then baked them for 6-7 minutes @450. We did a butter dip and then coated with cinnamon sugar. Spectacular!

Awesome. I, too, decreased the flour to about four cups. Soaked in baking soda solution until they floated to the top, about 15 seconds. Oven temp: 400. These were just like those at the mall, except for the price.

amazing. best soft pretzels ever. Substituted butter for oil. Used brown sugar instead of white. Used 4 c flour, was perfect. Kids had a blast making them, so easy. Baked 450F, got brown really fast, would be perfectly done at about 6-7 min.

The other comments were right and 450 is too hot.  I turned mine to 400 and baked for the 8 min it called for and they were perfect.  Really good recipe.  LOVED IT!

Very good. I made these in a braid form instead of the twist. My son loves them drizzled with butter. YUM! I'm from Philly and know a good pretzel.  This is good.  Oh, and if you want them for dipping prepare as stated, only cut them into two inch rods and bake. meanwhile prep a variety of sauces for diping...cheese, chocolate spicy mustard, sweet cream cheese...

These turned out great,my family ate them up like THAT! I did discover (on the second batch)that if you let them proof a bit after the last step,they come out softer and bigger. Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum! These were just like the mall! Next time I will get some jalapeno cheese sauce from the store for dip. I tried the nacho cheese version on here and did not care for it at all. This recipe though, is a keeper! Thanks!

These were very good pretzels.  I wouldn't call them, "mall good", but still very tasty and no one had any trouble gobbling these up!  We didn't have any pretzel salt, so we used cinnamon and sugar!  Very good and will use again.  They were great to make with my kids!

I'm not familiar w/ making bread, but they still turned out well.  I added fiber to the flour and I think this affected the dough. It didn't double in size after I left it to rise for 1.5 hrs, and it was more difficult to knead and roll.  Nonetheless, the pretzels turned out quite tasty, but a bit denser and chewier than I think they should have (probably b/c of the added fiber.

This was so easy and so yummy! I had to put some of the dough in the fridge for a couple hours and that ended up being the best dough to work with. It rolled out beautifully and so much easier than the non-refrigerated dough. My 6 year old was able to make a 2 foot long "snake" no problem. We'll make this again!

I made these for a Super Bowl party and they were a hit! I'm not very experienced with breads, and I had trouble getting all five cups of flour incorporated even after added extra water. I ended up tossing out some of the flour, so next time I'll probably decrease it a little. Either way, they were great!

These are very good pretzels!  Even my husband, who does not like pretzels, loves these.  Note, you really have to roll the dough long and thin if you do not want the pretzels to "smoosh together" when cooking.  Of course, even if they do, they are still good.  :o)

These were great! I forgot to add the 1 Tbsp of oil and they still came out great. My only problem was that they didn't really look like pretzels...I think that I didn't roll the ropes thin enough. For the second batch, I made pretzel rods....much easier!

Have to admit, I'm usually cursed when it comes to dough recipes (can't make a biscuit to save my life), so I was a little nervous.  But these turned out Amazing!  The baking soda bath is key.  I baked them at a lower temperature (around 420F) and liberally brushed on some melted butter halfway through.  Fantastic served with a warm cream cheese dip.  Will make again very soon!

Great pretzels!  Followed directions exactly-used my stand up mixer with bread hooks which made it super easy.  Did have to add extra water, but lost track of how much.  Followed advice to let proof in the oven (no heat) with the light on and a damp cloth covering and worked out perfect.  Ended up making 16 mid sized pretzles.  My daughter ate her's with chocolate and loves them!  I've already eaten two!  This is a keeper.

The recipie was pretty good. Make sure to make 12 equally sized pretzels. Also you might find they can stay in the oven a tad bit longer to prevent gooey dough.

We're iced in, and just made these as a treat.  Well the family polished them off in record time and everyone agrees they are terrific.  I made the dough in the bread machine cutting the flour back to 4 cups, and the kids rolled them out and baked them.  What could be easier ?

My boys and I made these pretzels on a snow day.  They were so much better than Auntie Annie's.  Instead of salt, we put cinnamon sugar on them.   The only problem is that the 5 cups of flour made it too dry.  I added about 5 extra tablespoons of water to the dough.  Delicious!!!

These are awesome! We loved them! I rolled them by hand which works just as well...and I let them raise longer like another reviewer suggested (about 2 hours). I took a break in the middle so we could eat 1/2 of them...and so the last 6 I made raised up a little more and they seemed easier to roll. My hubby loves the Auntie Anne's pretzels and he LOVED these!!!! THANKS for submitting!

I was so impressed with how easy it is to make soft, lovely "mall" pretzels in my own kitchen.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly but wasn't looking at the blurb under the recipe title and so didn't brush with or dip in melted butter. It didn't matter! They were amazing just with Nacho Cheese Sauce from this site. However, next time I will definitely try melted butter, melted garlic butter, cinnamon/sugar... these have great potential for fun flavors!

Bake at 400 for 15 - 20 minutes.  Also, roll dough out into ropes about 24 inches.

I actually added a third more to the recipe as I accidentally put in 2 more tsps. of yeast. So I added more water and flour. Dough came out a little hard and I was worried about it. Surprisingly, after baking, the pretzels came out really soft. Following some of the reviewers' tip, I drizzled melted butter as soon as they popped out of the oven. The taste is heavenly!! They really taste so much like the ones at the Pretzelmaker. With this recipe, I don't need to go to Yorkdale Mall here in Toronto, just to get that treat. My kids readily devoured them even though they're still hot! Thanks! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These pretzels are so good!  I use my mixer with the dough hook to make the dough the night before I want to make the pretzels.  Then I let the dough sit in the fridge overnight, and then take it out and let it rise on the counter for a few hours until it is doubled.  Rolling out the pretzels is the hardest part, it takes a while to get them really thin!  They get pretty fat when you cook them.  Also, I only cook them for about 6 and a half minutes or they start to get really dark, but I think my oven is off temp.  They are best to eat on the day they are made, but if you have some left over the next day you can stick them in the microwave to soften back up!

These turned out GREAT!!! I followed other reviewers advice and decreased flour to 4 cups. Threw everything (I also added about 2 tbsp of honey) into the kitchen-aid w/ the dough hook for 7 minutes. Once it had doubled, I didn't even bother taking it out of the bowl and flouring it. I simply grabbed chunks out of the bowl and rolled them in my hand "snake" style. Dipped in the baking soda/water mix and threw them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. I didn't have the patience to shape these, so they turned out to be pretzel nuggets/sticks. Once they were baked, I brushed both top and bottom with melted butter. These are to die for!!

WOW WOW WOW!! IF YOU MAKE THE ROPE EXTRA LONG ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PENCIL (ABOUT 3 FEET0. YOU WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER HAVE TO GO TO THE MALL FOR THESE. I GLAZED A FEW OF THEM WITH HONEY BEFORE AND AFTER THEY CAME OUT OF THE OVEN AND I SALTED A FEW. MAKE SURE YOU BUTTER THEM BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY GO IN THE OVEN, THEY WILL HAVE A NICE EXTRA BUTTERY YUMMMMMMY TASTE TO THEM. THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE. ITS IS SO MUCH BETTER AND EASIER THAN THE OTHER SOFT PRETZEL RECIPE.

This is the first recipe I have ever made that used yeast.  I was kind of scared, but it turned out fabulous.  For ease I often just roll them straight and cut them into bite size pieces after baking.  These are best fresh.  I made some to take a day later and they were not very good.  I have played around with the flour, and find it is best to use slightly less than the recipe calls for and adding as needed. Enjoy!

My whole family loves these.  My kids always want to go to the mall to Auntie Anne's pretzels and today we did.  While they were eating them they both said that the Auntie Annes weren't as good as the ones I make, thanks to this recipe!  YUM.

Great! I used a little more than 4 cups flour, 3 bread flour and 1+ AP, a heaping 1/4 cup sugar. Used Kitchen Aid for mixing. Got too much flour on my counter making it difficult to roll, so had to get my hands wet. Got the hang of shaping by the last few. I cut 16 pieces, using a couple to roll cheese and/or ham in. Really good. The pieces were plenty big for the regular pretzels. I don't think you need the half cup of soda and 4 cups hot water, not all the soda dissolved and one cup of water in a shallow bowl with a couple Tbs water probably would have done it - hold the pretzel upside down holding the ends that meet the bottom so the pretzel stays together. I held it up for a few seconds to stretch it out a bit. My first few were a bit fat, but the last ones looked perfect. Will definitely make these again!

I read through most of these reviews and only amended the recipe by cutting the sugar a bit, and brushing the pretzels with butter before topping with salt. They are truly delicious and taste just like Auntie Anne's!!!

The recipe was good. If you use a stand mixer, I think you don't need to knead it as long as the instructions say. Also, my pretzels were done in 6-7 minutes. 8 minutes was too long.

Yum, yum, yum!  This is a great recipe.  Keep in mind you are making a type of bread.  You do not need to use all of the flour.  I only use about 3 cups each time. Dip in soda mixture, sprinkle with salt, bake at 400 for 8-10 minutes then brush with butter.  If you would like a cinnamon sugar pretzel - do not sprinkle with salt - Bake, brush with butter and sprinkle with a cinnamon sugar mixture.  AMAZING!! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I tried to make the dough in the bread machine and either I did it wrong or it wasn't meant for the bread machine. The dough was very tough when it came out and would not shape into twists. They taste all right, I guess, but I don't know if I will try this recipe again or not.

I'm definitely what you would call a "novice" when it comes to cooking and baking. My mom and I LOVE soft pretzels, and our favorite mall pretzel shop closed, plus five dollars per pretzel is a bit much! 
I tried this recipe for my first time tonight and it was AWESOME! They tasted just like Auntie Anne's. Granted, my form wasn't the greatest, but I took advice from other reviewers by raising the oven rack, and using parchment paper on my pan. I also lowered the oven temp to 400 degrees, but I think it was a bit too low for the 8 minutes bake time. A few tweakings and it will be perfect! Thanks!

I used only 1/4 c. Sugar and 4 c. of flour, two which were whole wheat. I decided to make them into 12 chunky sticks and served them with Wisconsin Native's Beer Cheese Soup from this site. They were excellent. Next time I'll try just all purpose flour. Thank you.

Was ok but make sure to cook them until for the ful time and cover w/ tin foil if they get to brown before done cooking. Had a little bit of an odd flavor and I could not figure it out.

My wife had been hungry for a soft pretzel so I found this recipe and we're both glad I did.  I made it exactly as written and the dough was soft, not sticky and very easy to work with.  I was convinced they were going to taste like bread sticks, but they truly tasted exactly like a soft pretzel.  We didn't top them with anything (except a little mustard) and they were simply delicious.  We showed much restraint in only having 2 each when they came out of the oven.  This recipe is a keeper.

I've been looking for a soft pretzel recipe for years!  I made them today, and they are gone!  I wish I had more yeast....i'd make more right now!  AWSOME!  I didn't change a thing. I did add a bit more water when mixing the dough.

The flavor is spot on and delicious.
I began with four cups of flour my most recent time of making these and the dough kneading was much more manageable. I couldn't have added more than a half cup additional flour.

They needed less flour so i only put in 4 1/2 cups. I also used a bread maker to make the dough. It makes it so much easier and i can make them more often. Whole wheat flour  was a good addition. I used half whole and half white and they where wonderful! 
I absolutely recommend this recipe!

Very good recipe, My family couldn't stop eating these. I did use a little less flour and I kneaded most of it into the dough instead of adding it in with the ingredients. Other then that I followed the directions exactly with excellent results!

My 11 year old daughter and her friend actually made these pretezels with my supervision-they did a fantastic job! I wish that we would of made more because they were gone in just a few hours.They are even better then the mall pretzel.You must dip the entire pretzel in the melted butter-very good!

I made these today and they were better than the mall pretzels because they're not dripping with grease and other unknowns!  I also used 4C flour, 1/4 C sugar instead of what the recipe calls for and they are delicious.  Thank you!

Oh man I can't get over how good these were. My roommates love them too. I made 8 big soft pretzels. Biting into them and tasting the buttery goodness was the best. I read some comments and followed the 400F and that worked great. I also did the butter-brushing after cooking then sprinkled with salt. It was so good. Definitely recommend this!

The baking soda dip truly makes these taste like the ones you buy at the mall. I 1/3'd the recipe and it seemed to work fine. I was also lazy and only let the dough rise for 20 minutes, but that didn't make them awful either. I imagine they're even better than what i made.

Fantastic!  Did not change a thing except using regular salt dissolved in the water instead of kosher.  Tastes exactly like the pretzels you'd find in a mall.  No butter needed!

Wow! I never really liked pretzels very much until I made these! I made them mostly because my dad loves soft pretzels. Once they came out of the oven, I brushed melted butter on them and they were amazing!

These were only ok. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of only using about 3.5 cups flour and kneading in about another half to one cup. Didn't really think they were any different than pretzel recipes I've tried before. Also, when I put them into a plastic ziplock bag to eat later, they seemed to get soggy. That has never happened before. Weird!

These were really fun.  I used half whole wheat flour and sprinkled half with cinnamon sugar.  We had a rainy day and it was a fun activity for my 2 and 4 year old girls to help me roll them.  I did have to sacrafice two pretzels, but they were busy with their dough for at least 45 minutes!  They also enjoyed eating them for their snack.

This was my frist time baking any sort of bread product, and let me tell ya, if I can do it then anybody can!! These were absloutley delicious!!! The only thing I did different was I brushed melted butter over them when they were done as some other reviewers suggested. I made my own jalepno cheese dipping sauce to go with them. Better than the malls pretzels for sure!!

Just made these this afternoon.  Delicious!  They are soft and a little sweet.  We have enjoyed them already!  I will cut down on the flour and sugar next time.  There was too much flour and I had to add almost 1/2 c more water.  Although I liked the sweet taste and cinnamon & sugar would be great on these, I am a mustard on my pretzels kinda' person.  Therefore, I would cut the sugar in half.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These pretzels are soooooooo good!!!  I have tried several different pretzel recipes in the past, and the pretzels have always turned out like bricks.  I was skeptical that the recipe would even turn out, but tried it anyway, and I am SO impressed with the results!

I made the changes suggested by other reviewers and used only 4 cups of flour, and baked for 10 minutes at 400 degrees (hence the 4 stars). 

Great recipe!

Great recipe! I used only 4 cups of flour and it came to a good consistancy.  I should have rolled them a bit thinner, I didnt realize how much they would puff up.  I put them on a stone cookie sheet to keep from them sticking, worked great. After I pulled them out I brushed melted butter all over them.  Will definitely make again.

Very soft and tasty! I ended up adding 2 tablespoons of extra water. 
These pretzels are delicious! We ate them warm with velveeta cheese. YUM!
Next time I think I'll try to make them with wheat flour!

Oh my, these were amazing!  I made them for company, and everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!  I like my hot pretzels a bit thick and buttery.  Also, since we had so many people here, I cut them into "bites."  My changes were that I used 4 1/2 c. flour, I used a bit of oil on the countertop when rolling out, and I brushed with butter in the middle of baking.  Very good!  My husband wants me to make them again!

very yummy! soda wash is a must, for a nice, light crust. I used only 1/2 amount of sugar! I hate using recipes that call for yeast, but these turned out great! These go GREAT with the nacho cheese sauce recipe on this site!

Oh my goodness. These are amazing! I whipped up a batch and I'm having a hard time keeping out of them! I used 3 cookie sheets, 1 with butter on the pretzels, and 2 with the soda wash. The ones with the soda wash browned really well with that slight crisp outside. Definately use the soda wash. The buttered ones are cooked through, but are white. Used melted butter instead of the oil, and 4 cups of flour, which still was a bit much, but got it to work. I put garlic powder and parmesean cheese on mine after they were cooked. Before I made these I was trying to figure out what to dip them in, but they don't need it. Making again and again. Yum!

I've tried many soft pretzel recipes and this is the BEST! I did have to add a bit more water to the dough because it seemed dry, but other than that, this recipe is perfect!  Thanks for sharing!!

These are delicious and exactly what I was looking for in a soft pretzel.  The dough has a hint of sweetness which goes well with melted butter and salt.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Well i doubt i need to add to the already wonderful reviews....... but I just have too, have tried making soft pretzels on and off over the years only to be disapointed by the turn out. Wow what a suprise this one was!!! I followed directions to a T, except I did put oven at 400 and on top rack. 2nd batch i put thin coat of butter after soda water dip, THEY were AWESOME, no more hour drive to mall for that favorite pretzel, I have 6 kids who all loved them. Thank you for posting this!!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because my boyfriend absolutely loved them. The only changes I made were that used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I brushed the top of the pretzels with butter when they came out of the oven. I think this would be really good if sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.

it was yummy out of the oven. my kid and husband enjoyed it. one thing i'm not pleased about is the wrinkle look of it. especially when i saved the leftovers in a ziplock bag. very wrinkly.
i tried to adjust the temp and keep an eye on time, but both batches were blackened on the bottom. what's the ideal time and temp?
also, i tried putting kosher salt. it doesn't taste as good. where to buy pretzel salt. i saw on amazon a 2lb. bag for $3 (plus $9 s/h). where can i buy pretzel salt locally?

WOW! These are so easy to make and amazing. My husband can't get enough of them. I have already made them three times in three weeks. After reading all the previous reviews I used the 4.5 cups of flour and think that it is much easier to knead. Will use this recipe for years to come.

Great recipe! My family loved it! I should have used less flour like the other reviewers suggest, so I had to add a lot of water, but they still turned out fantastically. Thanks!

i love this recipe and have been using it since i found it last summer. I was preggo and craving soft pretzels. this is the first recipe i found that i liked. i do use less flour though because when i made it with the ammount it called for it was too dry and tough. i think i use 3-4 cups.

Excellent recipe - have been making these weekly since discovering the recipe.  Followed others' suggestions regarding modifications: 4 cups flour (I use 2 cups whole wheat and 2 cups AP), 1/4 c sugar.

Fabulous!  I made the dough per your directions, except added a bit more water.    I wrapped tofu pups in the dough and added a bit of agave nectar to the baking soda wash and brushed it on.  Absolutely delicious Pretzel Pups!  Thanks for sharing!

Only changes I made were to reduce oven temp. to 425 and bake for 6 mins. I also used 1 less cup of flour. I topped some with garlic salt, some with coarse sea salt, others with cinnamon and sugar. I think I prefer the original way the best, with the salt. I've already had three!

These were ok when they first come out of the oven but they harden to bricks after a day!  I may have done something wrong but I followed the recipe closely.  I will keep looking for a better recipe.

I don't know what's wrong.. I didn't change a thing except reducing the flour to 4 cups, following dome of the reviews. Yes, they're soft and chewy, but too salty even with some sugar on them.

We loved this recipe!  I also only used 4 cups of flour, incorporating 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour into the 4 cups.  It was easy and fun to make.  My kids love pretzel bites, so instead of twisting into a pretzel shape, we cut inot small nugget shaped bites.  They were delicious!

These were very good! I made them as a snack this weekend and they went over really big. I did brush them with melted butter and I used the caramel seasoning you would on popcorn to make them sweet. They were delish!!

al though they tasted more like hot rolls.
We added cinnamon and sugar and one with butter. There also great to make breadsticks with.

I've never worked with such a tough dough before!! Will defenitely use 4 cups of flour as opposed to 5. With the 5 cups of flour, I was adding a ridiculous amount of extra water, just to be able to work the dough. The flavor was good, although my husband found them a bit too sweet. Also, I accidentally added the cinnamon-sugar to the pretzels before baking and this is a huge no-no!! It caused some sort of chemical reaction that I wasn't aware of and they turned black on the outside!!! LOL! However, My stepson loved them and he is a pretzel lover (not the cinn-sugar ones of course!!) I would recommend dipping them into melted butter after they come out of the oven, wonderful!!

I made these this afternoon with my 3 year old daughter.  I used the full amount of flour but ended up adding just a bit more water (maybe 1/4c).  Did the mixing/kneading in my Kitchenaid mixer.  After the soda bath, we sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar. They came out PERFECT. Dare I even say--better than I expected?!  Delish!! My kids LOVE them.  And so do the adults!  SO EASY.

Yum.  :).  I used self-rising flower rather than all-purpose and ommitted salt/rising agent in accordance.  I had a hard time stretching out the dough into thin enough logs.  In some of the dough I put garlic and in one a bit more butter.  Before baking I covered with melting butter product, sea salt and on some a combination of melted butter product and cinnamon sugar.  Yum.  :).  Nice and dough-ey.  :).

Easy to make. I painted the warm pretzels with a little bit of melted butter. The pretzels are wonderful, better than the pretzels you buy at the mall. Enjoy.

The dough was really hard to work with, when I tried to roll it out into ropes, it shrunk! I did manage to make a few pretzels, and what I did bake come out ok. The taste was good, they were sweet. The bottoms burned though, so the temp should probably be lower when you bake them. I didn't use all of the dough on pretzels, I am going to use the rest for dinner rolls instead.

This recipe is incredible.  It will definitely become a staple in our house.  My husband was really curious about the ingredients, because the pretzels are so tasty, but the recipe is so simple!  I really think the baking soda bath makes the recipe.  As another poster suggested, I sprayed the pretzels with I Can't Believe it's Not Butter spray.  An excellent recipe---you must try it!

Superb! These were finished by my fiance and guests within one day. I made half the batch with spray butter, garlic salt, italian seasoning, & parmesan cheese and the other half dipped in butter and rolled in a cinnamon sugar mix. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar in the recipe. As others suggested I baked these on the higher rack in the oven and they browned perfectly. I cooked them for 10 minutes. Super easy to prepare with results just as pictured. Will definitely make and share again. Thanks!

Wow! After watching tv and seeing someone buy a pretzel from a street cart, I knew I needed to make some! These turned out perfect! My rolls didn't get as thin as I read in the reviews, so I thought I'd have to cook them longer. Nope, 8 minutes was perfect for my awfully shaped pretzels (they looked more like lumps than anything).

My only change was that I used brown sugar instead of white. Also, in the beginning, I only mixed in 4 cups of flour. My dough didn't get near wet enough! I added another 1/4c of warm water and probably kneaded in the last 3/4 - 1 cup flour that I didn't add in the beginning. Perfect perfect perfect! Going to eat some more!

Really good.  I only used 4 cups of flour and brushed them with egg instead of baking soda.  They didn't brown when the oven was on 400, and only browned a little at 450.

Very soft and very good and easy!  I skip the baking soda wash and use an egg wash instead.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the flour to 3 Cups. Great for at home Movie nights!

These were SO good! For Christmas I bought my nephew an Auntie Anne's pretzel kit, and these tasted just like them for a lot cheaper! The only problem I had was with rolling the dough, it was tough and wouldn't really stretch, but they were delicious!

Not quite like the shopping mall pretzel but still very delicious. Thanks to previous reviewers' comments, I reduced the flour to a scant more than 3 cups and it turned out yummy and not too dense. I think in the future when I make this again, I might try glazing the pretzel with some butter before topping it with coarse salt and other sesame seeds or cinnamon sugar before putting them into the oven. This is definitely a keeper!

These were good but not like Auntie Anne's. I used 3 cups flour, baked at 400 on parchment paper.  Not as "buttery" as I would like, but still a fun treat to make with the kids.

My fiance has me make these weekly.  They are wonderful.  I am too inpatient to make them into a pretzel shape so I just do a pretzel stick.  I have also tried cinnamon and sugar, and parm cheese and garlic salt.  But are wonderful, but plain old Kosher salt is the best.

These were pretty good.  My family liked them more than I did.  I guess I was anticipating my house to smell like Auntie Anne's in the mall.  Be sure you have time to make these, they are not a quick fix.
Thanks!

Very Good!!!  I just got done making these pretzels, and they were delicious!!  The only problem I had was the bottoms not getting done.  I think I might need to leave them in longer.  I did the dough in the bread machine, and it worked great!!  Wonderful recipe!!

Great pretzels. I used PAM (spray-on canola oil) on the baking sheets. The bottoms of the pretzels burnt, and I'm wondering if it was because of the cooking spray. Anyone know? Also, I'm a salt LOVER and I'm certain that I salted them far too much before baking. Otherwise an excellent recipe. How to not burn the bottom of the pretzels, though?

I have enjoyed making bread for the last 10 years. I have also made a lot of biscuits and scones. I LOVE pretzles, but had never tried to make them before. I LOVED THESE!! My family scarfed them down. The only problem was there simply wasn't enough!! Very easy recipe to follow. This is a keeper. :)

These pretzels were delicious, I followed the recipe exactly but probably used only 3 and 3/4 cups of flour.  They do taste similar to mall pretzels, but I will try and make them skinnier next time.  They were very thick.  It may require baking 2 seperate pans in order to have enough room on the pan to stretch them out.  All in all, these were very good.  I sprinkled some with parmesan, some with cinnamon and sugar and some with kosher salt.

These turned out pretty well.  It was a lot of work rolling out the dough.  I added about 1/4 cup more water to make the dough more workable for kneading.  The pretzels were dense, chewy, and awesome. I also slightly decreased both salt and sugar due to past reviews, and didn't miss them.  My roomie liked them.

Deviated from the exact recipe a little, but all in all close enough to know this recipe is a little sweet and nto "doughy" enough to be like the pretzels from food venues like Rock Bottom Brewery and those fun mall stops like Wetzel's Pretzels & Pretzel Maker. Very light and fluffy, would be great for a bread or dinner roll recipe.

My family enjoyed these, but they left us desiring a trip to the mall for the real thing.  They are a good/cheap alternative for a rainy day though!  We used much less salt than the recipe called for and we didn't miss it at all.

Who knows how this recipe will taste - it's going into the oven as I type this.  Our pretzels are more like logs and we're not sure what happened... we followed the recipe exactly.  Just checkout out the review section and realized that instead of trying to make pretzels we should have been making dinner rolls?  Maybe next time I'll try reading all the reviews before I believe the star rating on a recipe - afterall I gave this one 5!!  (Maybe it's for entertainment value and NOT for greatness of recipe!  Cheers!

My friends and family loved these pretzels. they taste very simmular to the mall pretzels. the only problem I had were they were hard to get to roll out to the right size but I might have been to impatiant. Great with Cinnamon and sugar.

This was my first attempt at making pretzels, and they turned out great. . .except that they were WAY too salty!  I love salt, and so was generous in sprinkling on the kosher salt.  But the pretzels were so salty they just couldn't be eaten.  What a disappointment, as the pretzel itself turned out just great.  I'll try again, but with cinnamon and sugar on top!

I admit, I had reservations about how these would actually turn out but Oh My Gosh... WONDERFUL!  These taste just like soft pretzles you find in the mall.  After they came out of the oven I brushed the ones we were going to eat with a little melted butter... delicious!

My toddlers loved these. They DO taste like Auntie Anne's. I had to add more water to the dough to make it all come together. Only problem I had was rolling them out, I couldn't get them into a long thin rope like I wanted, they were very fat and plump. That didn't detract from the taste, though. I dipped mine in melted butter and sprinkled on salt after they came out of the oven, just like they do at the mall. These are great to make with your kids!

These pretzels were awesome. Instead of topping them with kosher salt, I sprikled some cinnamon and sugar on them and they tasted great.  Mixing the ingredients was hard and tedious, but the results were well worth it!

I love how sweet these pretzels are!  If the sugar were reduced, I would think they would taste less like mall pretzels.  Very good!  Fun to make.

I've made this recipe twice so far, only because the first time I didn't make enough and they were gone before they even had a chance to cool off!  They did end up tasting more like soft breadsticks, but WHO CARES????  They were delicious - absolutely delicious.  I had to add more water to the recipe, but perhaps that's an altitude issue.  Either way, how YUMMY!!!  My kids (picky!!) devoured them!

These were really good.  The closest I have found to those mall pretzels.  I didn't use the 1/2 c. of sugar, because of some of the other reviews saying it made them too sweet.  I also microwaved them in the soda solution for 20 seconds like one other review mentioned.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Sure to make them again.

These didn't really taste much like pretzels, but they do taste good as rolls. I couldn't roll them into pretzel shapes either - they just wanted to remain a blob of dough.

I took notes on some of the reviews and used 31/2C flour (reserving 1/2C for kneading), 1/4C sugar, let rest after dipping in baking soda solution, egg wash before cooking and butter after.  (I did 6 cinn/sugar & 6 salt)  They came out of the oven 10 min ago and I tried them, they were very tasty, but not chewy like a pretzel should be.  Would make a great bread or breadstick recipe!

I followed another reviewer's advice and allowed these to rest a few minutes prior to baking, and then brushed with egg wash before popping in the oven.  After baking for the allocated 8 minutes, I brushed them with melted Cinnamon/Sugar Country Crock and then sprinkled with Domino Cinnamon/Sugar mix.  
I followed the recipe exactly, and these came out fine.  The dough was easy to work with, and I had no trouble at all in rolling out ropes approx. 3 feet long.  Once baked, they puff up quite a bit and look very appealing.  The taste is somewhat bland, but it's not because your flour might be stale, I think the recipe needs more salt.  Other than that, I would make these again. They were very easy and fun to make.
Thank you!

These did taste just like the mall preztels!  My husband loves Auntie Annies and he said these were just like them.  I baked just after dipping in soda water and after they were done I brushed with melted butter and shook cinnamon sugar over them.  They did turn out a little small and fat.  Next time I make these I will roll them pinky thin and shorten bake time.  Also I divided into 8 to make big preztels for 8 people but it seems like the right amount anyway.

Yummy! Fun and easy. I was able to manage the dough. My kids helped, and they liked rolling the dough into "snakes". They came out tasting great, however, next time, I will cook them longer. I was afraid to burn them, and I thought they were a little undercooked. Everyone else loved them, and it was a recipe the kid's enjoyed helping with. Thanks!

Wow! These are just the sort of thing that could make me gain 15 pounds in a month if I were to bake them often. I followed the recipe exactly, and the pretzels turned out soft and chewy and buttery and completely yummy--both the ones I made with cinnamon and sugar and the ones I topped with kosher salt. Thanks Christa, for a fab recipe! You rock!

We really enjoyed these. We made these a few times the first time a little dry on the dough hard to work with. But just keep using a little bit of water to soften up. We also use Bread Flour the second time seem to be much easier. Thanks
