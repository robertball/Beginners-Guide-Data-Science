I'm not sure what complaint the one reviewer had against this recipe, but this is my husband's  FAVORITE recipe. Even my kids (2 and 5) are absolutely crazy about this one! I loved it so much I copied the recipe and emailed it on to all my friends and family, even received back a ton of complimentary feedback. This is the kind of recipe that gets handed down from generation to generation. The only complaint I have is the standing time. I usually prefer something that can be prep'd and then cooked. But still a WONDERFUL dinner!

I loved this recipe...Though I didn't refridgerate over night. I am not entirely sure why that is necessary.

All time favorite comfort food. My mom's standby...and hers as well. Anyone who doesn't like this recipe is too snobby to be searching for a recipe like this. Go eat some caviar and leave the rest of us alone.

Loved the quick throw together way of this recipe.  Made it up early in the morning and then popped it in the fridge, so after work was done for the day was able to come home and bake this up fast.  This is great served with garlic bread.

This could be a pretty good recipe. I added a little sour cream to the mixture and a layer of bread crumbs to the top. Other than that, I followed the directions so I'm not sure what I did wrong. The noodles on the bottom and sides were still chewey/hard. I would have cooked it longer, but it already had a brown "crust" starting to form on bottom and sides of dish...maybe I overcooked it? I refrigerated overnight and cooked at 375 for 1 hour, so I'm not sure. I will try this recipe again (we liked it), but will watch closely while cooking...maybe stirring 1/2 way through cooking time to redistribute the noodles.

This was pretty good as a corned beef casserole- very much a comfort food, and for some reason very good with beer.  But the most exciting thing is that by subbing tuna fish for the corned beef I have finally found THE tuna casserole I have been looking for.  Thanks!

I did not like this dish at all, but then again I've never tried eating canned corned beef before.  Oh well, live and learn. Sorry, it's not for me.

This was actually pretty tasty. I skipped the bread crumbs, as I thought that it might be too dry. What's best, is that it comes out of the oven smelling great and is all bubbly and cheesy. Definitely great comfort food for a rainy afternoon or evening.

Tasty, not one of the "healthier" meals I make. Came out good as a premade breakfast pie for the kids to heat up before school. Used celery, garlic pepper jack cheese and two eggs (personal preference). Will make again, but not as often as other breakfast pie recipes.

I was disappointed in this. It was very unappetizing *looking* and also rather dull. Like thick green pepper soup. I added bread crumbs, following the advice of another reviewer, but it wasn't saved. There is a lot of it in my fridge -- I hope the husband takes it well when I tell him tomorrow is the same dinner! Hehehe.

I changed the method of this casserole quite a bit but not the ingredients. I parboiled the noodles, and cut the liquids in half (half the milk, 1 can of soup), sauteed the peppers and onion and combined everything. Baked 20 minutes then topped with some french fried onions and baked another 10. We thought it could use some "texture". Overall flavor was pretty good! Very creamy and definitely salty from that corned beef. I liked the combination. We used mixed frozen veggies.

If you are a southerner you will probably not like this. Canned meat seems to be more of a northern taste. I had two friends from Michigan and Wisconsin who love it, but no one here in the south liked it.

I made this casserole last night and didn't think much of it. Today I ate some for lunch and liked it much better. Storing it for 12 hours or so I suppose the flavors melded. I substituted peas for a can or peas/carrots; the soups I didn't have so I used a can of gravy.
