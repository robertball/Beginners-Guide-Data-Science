Yum! made them up as pretzel sticks for dipping but most got eaten by themselves because they are so tasty! I did mix together a teaspoon of season salt with a teaspoon of parm cheese and a teaspoon of garlic salt with parsley and sprinkle over them lightly as they came out of the oven on the second batch but both were gobbled down quick as could be!

This had a decent flavor, but was way too dry and crumbly.

As they were baking they filled my house with such a great smell.  I wished they tasted like they smelled.  These were very dry.

Dry, dry, and more dry. They weren't a pretzel at all. They seemed like a ball of flour and cheese. Very dissapointing

I used medium cheddar instead of sharp cheddar. I also added dried and crushed mint leaves instead of oregano. Mine were the opposite of dry though, the butter inside was still boiling, I had to leave it in the oven for 4 more minutes. They are soft and delicious, also makes the house smell great. A little too buttery, including the cheese...

when i tried these last nite when they were warm, i didnt care for the texture,, seemed floury. i put them in the fridge overnight and they are much better this morning. I liked them cold and will try them at room temp next. Don't expect them to taste like regular pretzels, because they don't. They are closer to a cookie in texture. The do smell wonderful baking and the herb flavor is very nice
