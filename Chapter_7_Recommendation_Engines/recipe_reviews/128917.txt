I actually made this recipe up myself, almost exactly. I saw it in my email this morning and decided to see what it was like, and it's just like mine! This is a great dish, and filling even without the chicken, a great meatless meal.  To the person who commented that they couldn't believe it didn't have "curry"...  Curry powder is a mixture of spices of widely varying composition based on South Asian cuisine. Curry powder, and the contemporary English use of the word curry are Western inventions and do not reflect any specific Indian food.  So the fact that this has a spice mixture can make it a curry.

The reason this recipe does not call for curry powder is that Thai curries do not use curry powder!!  Curry powder as we think of it is actually a blend of spices that is used in Indian cooking.  This blend often includes cumin, coriander and turmeric which this recipe does have listed as ingredients.  Thai curries use fresh or dried chilis, ginger, galangal, lemongrass and coriander among other things to make a fresh curry paste.  That said, I'm sure you could make this into a delicious Indian-style curry by adding curry powder to your liking.

Couldn't believe the recipe didn't actually call for curry...Not sure if that was a mistake or not. But I added 1 tbl. of curry and only put in 2 tsps.of cumin. I used the whole can of coconut milk just because I love it so. I also added long beans (chinese green beans) cut in 1/2 pieces. It came out fantastic, esp. over jasmine rice. A wonderful fall recipe!

This is also delicious with squash instead of pumpkin. I made 20% more sauce so I could toss in some chickpeas and spinach-- and left out the chicken-- make it vegetarian and filling. YUM!!

first of all, i don't eat chickens, so i omitted that whole first step. secondly, i unfortunately had only 'lite' coconut milk. i should have thought about this & maybe reduced my veggie stock on the stove. 
i added sliced red bell peppers when i put in the pumpkin & a few minutes before it was done cooking, i threw in some thawed peas. to get a bit of a crunch, as well as some protein, i topped the final plate with chopped roasted peanuts.
over all, this was a very easy dish to prepare, but due to my silly mistake, the final flavors were muted and watery.
thanks for this recipe! i will definitely be making it again, but with full fat coconut milk!

I've had this dish prepared by a fantastic thai chef, she used sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin, and it was sooo lovely.

My husband made this dish for me and it was great.  He replaced the pumpkin with butternut squash.  I would definitely request this dish again, it was pretty spicy :)

This was really good. The reason I voted it a 3 star was just because I think it needed to be saucier and more coconutty. I think next time I might increase the coconut content by 50% or more and increase the overall liquid content. Another good addition might be chickpeas, but overall a very good recipe that will be added to our rotation. I didn't have chicken but I added bits of tofu and that worked very well. Very easy to make too which was a bonus. Yum!

I have a glut of pumpkins, and so I think I'm trying every pumpkin not-dessert recipe on this site. This was ok, but far from the best. The presentation isn't beautiful, the flavors are ok, but not complex. The best part about it was definately the sauce, which I could eat by itself over rice. Decent, quick, healthyish (other than the coconut milk), but not a show-stopper.

This was good but not exceptional. We added extra chicken and a can of chickpeas. A really healthy, light meal. We'll definately make it again, thanks!

Very good.  They only variation I made was using light coconut milk.  The broth was thin, however it soaked into my brown rice nicely.  I would cut the pumpkin into a small dice next time.  I will make it again.  (BTW, the left overs tasted better the next day)

A bit bland, (it has heat, but not a lot of levels of flavour) but definitely a repeat, and the 2 and 3 year olds loved it.

I've made this a couple of times, first for Halloween dinner using pumpkin, then another time with sweet potatoes and other time with pumpkin again. It was superb every time... The first time, I managed to find fresh turmeric root and used that, which gave it an amazing burst of flavour (though it as good with powdered turmeric too), and I used concentrated homemade chicken stock for the broth, which gives great flavour, too. I added more coconut milk to have more sauce (my fave part of curries!). Watch for the red pepper flakes, as they are potent and if you don't like "spicy" then reduce the amount in the recipe. It's in the rotation - a great recipe. I serve it over fragrant white jasmine rice.

I thought this would be the same recipe that I've had twice now at my favorite Thai restaurant, however it wasn't.  That being said, this recipe was delicious!! I used light coconut milk because that's what was in the cupboard, and omitted the onion.  It was just perfect. I had never prepared pumpkin before. I removed all the seeds and cut it in chunks and steamed it for about 15 minutes....made removing the skin so easy. That suggestion came from the cashier at the local vegetable stand! 
I will definitely make this again!  The amount of heat was just right!
Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm doing WeightWatchers so adjusted the recipe to suit my low cal needs. I used 2 tsp olive oil and sauteed the chicken, onion and garlic altogether instead of separately. I also left out the coconut milk as my husand is not a big fan. Neverthless, the recipe was fantastic and I will definitely be making it again. Some other changes I made: I added 2tsp of curry powder, doubled the cumin added fresh coriander just before dishing up. Served with yellow rice this dish is a wholesome, filling winner.

I really liked this curry, but I must admit I didn't follow exactly. I didn't have chicken, I used pork. I also added cauliflower and green beans to up the veg. I also added a little curry powder and used chili paste,( as I didn't have flakes) but it was great. Maybe not a true Thai curry, but good for my taste. I can't wait to try it with the chicken next time.

I made this recipe twice, once with acorn squash the second time with sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes work best. I deleted the chicken and mashed the squash/pumpkin into a mixture as a side dish. The spices and coconut milk are à stunning sensation. So good in fact, I take it to work a few times/week just to get that buttery, salty, sweet, cumin pumpkin fix. Its certainly a keeper recipe.

We thought this was fine, but my wife and I prefer the Thai flavors more similar to green and red curries.  This was more in line with a yellow curry and almost an Indian curry flavor.  Still good, but slightly different than we were expecting.

I think it is fantastic... I love all the spices... The only thing I did different is I didn't have any pumpkin so I substituted sweet potatoes.   And it turned out de-lish....  I will be making this again...

Super tasty! I've never attempted a curry before, and this was great. As another reviewer suggested, we used sweet potato instead of pumpkin (not in season here) and I accidentally bought cream of coconut instead of coconut milk, so it may have been sweeter and thicker than intended. Again, as per a review, I used 1 C coconut milk (cream) and 1 C chicken broth because I love coconut flavor. We'll be having this again! I am wimpy so I used 1/2 T cumin instead of the full T. Was perfect for me.

Tried all of a can of 100% pumpkin instead of fresh pumpkin. Used almost all of the can of coconut milk & NO water. This made a rich, creamy & a beautifully colored sauce & more than enough for the amount of chicken called for. Needed to vary spices to taste.

I used this recipe as a basis for what to do with the beautiful freshly dug ginger and the lovely little pumpkin I got from my CSA yesterday.  I also had some leftover roast chicken that I substituted for the chicken step. Some leftover apples cooked in butter and cinnamon was added near the end as an after thought since apples are often used to make curries. I used the Thai spices called for in the recipe.  I used a whole can of coconut milk (don't like to leave half cans of this) and I used some concentrated chicken base and a little water instead of broth.  So actually I deviated from this recipe a lot.  But the result was exquisite served over rice.  My husband commented that I could have added more liquid but I liked the consistency. It was delicious. And I have leftovers and my CSA pumpkin is gone!

This dish is easy to prepare and incredibly flavorful. The aromas while cooking were absolutely amazing.

Screw ups: 1)used table-spoon instead of tea-spoon of poultry seasoning 2)forgot to buy the pumpkin.  As a result, it was a little more watery than I would have liked, but still a great recipe.
