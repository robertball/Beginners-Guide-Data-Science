I'm in love with this. I made it last night and let it sit in the fridge for a day, that may have helped. Tonight I warmed some Turkish flatbread in the oven, spread the chickpea filling on it generously, threw some halved cherry tomatoes and thin slices of cucumber on and drizzled with a bit of light yoghurt. Then wrapped it all up burrito-style. After the first bite I thought it was a nice 4 star spread, but it kept tasting better and better with each bite. Now I am finding it hard no to attack the leftovers with a spoon and eat up the whole lot. So good. Wonderful texture, the dill works great (esecially with the salad and yoghurt) and its so healthy. Fingerlicking good. Thanks.

My vegetarian sister taught me to make this several years ago. It's a great sandwich filling and also tastes delicious as a filling for stuffed tomatoes (very pretty topped with fresh parsley). I make mine in the food processor and always add a dash of Tabasco to it. We've also made it with Dijon mustard replacing the lemon juice... very versatile and yummy recipe!

WOW!!!  This was fantastic!!!  I am so glad I finally tried this recipe, because it was perfect for a light summer dinner.  I omitted the celery (personal preference) and used less onions.  I used fat free mayo, no sugar added relish, and the dill weed and lemon were perfect!!  mashing the chickpeas took some time (I tried using a mixer... not the best idea.  There were chickpeas firing everywhere!) but it was all well worth it!  

We used it to fill pitas, along with romaine and tomato slices.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!  With 3 vegetarians and 3 non-veg, we all agreeded it was simply amazing!!!  My Grandmother didn't even realize it wasn't tuna!

WOW is the only word that describes this sandwich.  This was delicious. It was so good that I was eating it straight out of the bowl.  I served this filling on a toasted whole wheat pita with lettuce and tomato.  To keep the chick peas moist, just add a few TB of the liquid in the can along with your mayonnaise.  Mine was very moist by doing this.  Thank you for offering this healthy alternative.

This was pretty good. I did add one large chopped garlic dill, a teaspoon garlic powder and one chopped organic hard boiled egg. I did not use the whole onion, just a few green onions. My littlest loved this, too, believe it or not. I was shocked. I spread his on Dave's Killer Bread but I had mine spread on cucumber slices. NOTE: I used olive oil mayonnaise and I did need an extra tablespoon. Next time, I might add a little dijon and a few shakes Frank's Hot Sauce. I also used organic garbanzo beans.

Heather, this was SO good! Threw the beans into my food processor, added a tad more lemon and lots of garlic. I sliced whole wheat pitas into triangles, baked them in the oven until nice and crispy and used them as a dipping device for the wonderful bean mixture! Incredible and thank you!

Super healthful and a great alternative to tuna fish or egg salad.  I served it with leaves of romaine lettuce and tomato, to make lettuce wraps.  I thought the lemon juice was a bit overpowering, next time I might halve it.   I will also add some chopped carrot and garlic powder and maybe sub green onion for regular onion, just for more color.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. We are always looking for healthy low-fat alternatives. I added some non-fat sour cream to make it more spreadable. It was good on a pita with some crunchy dill pickles. Thanks Heather

We are not vegetarians but were looking for something differant. We enjoyed this filling on homemade chapatti. I used a food processor but think it will be much better with a chunky texture.

This was so good!!! I was hesitant to try it because of the simple ingredients but I am glad I did! Will make often! I used like 1/4 onion instead of half and left out the pepper. I also cut the onion and celery in very small pieces so it could blend well.

Very easy to make, but I was a bit hesitant about putting in the beans as is without cooking them to soften them. I still made as is to see how they'd turn out, and as I expected, they were extremely hard to digest. The beans were still a bit hard and as another reviewer said, they really do give you a tummy ache for a few days! I never use canned beans without first boiling them for a few minutes after rinsing, and I will never try to do so again! So...if we were to boil the beans for about 10 minutes before mixing with the rest, this would be a 5 star filling. The flavours were really good, and I would play aroud with the spices each time. Good change on regular tuna sandwitches. We could not eat the leftovers due to their uncomfortable crunchiness, so I ended up putting the mix in a skilled with some water and cooked them until soft, and added some eggs to them to make a nice omelet the next day. That was delicious!

I added a lot to this recipe.. added 1 tsp mustard, 1 extra T mayo, 1/2t curry powder, 2T organic sweet relish, and a pinch of paprika.  Also added some raisins.  Was absolutely AMAZING.  Served on toasted whole-wheat bread, but would be excellent on pita bread.  UPDATE:  After sitting in the fridge for a couple of days, it tastes even BETTER.

This was great, although I had to make a few changes. I squeezed I half fresh lemon and put 4tbsp of light mayo to make it a little more moist.  I also added some garlic powder....it came  out totally yummers!

The raw onion in this recipe is way super overpowering, but otherwise this would be pretty good. So I give it three stars as written, but there is potential.

Love it~  I am on a chickpea bender and this was just perfect!  I agree with another commentor that this just gets better as it sits.....leave it regrigerated overnite if you can.  Did mine with red onion, celery, red pepper, mayo, dijon and lemon.  Ate it on a pita bread and YUMMO!

Although this recipe looked good and I will try another time, I was in the mood for something more greek.  I used this recipe as a base recipe.  To the mashed chick peas I added purple onion, minced garlic, celery, red pepper, lemon juice, mayonaise, seas. salt, pepper, greek seasoning (also found on this site) and some greek salad dressing to get the right consistency.  I let the mixture sit in frig overnite for the the flavors to blend.  Put this mixure in a pita with some romaine and feta cheese and it was a wonderful tasting meal.  I used a pastry blender to cut up the chick peas and it worked very well.  Will try tzatziki sauce instead of mayo next time and some black olives as well!!!

I really loved this. Used a potato masher instead of a fork to mash the chickpeas. I did use fresh dill, and less lemon and I didn't use any onion, personal preference. Quick and easy!

I thought this was fantastic, and it has endless options for variety.  I used green onions and just threw in a handful..probably 2 or 3 tablespoons or so.  I don't like celery, so I omitted that.  And I used Veganaise and added just a dash of soy sauce and a dash of liquid smoke to it and mixed before adding to chickpeas.  I pulsed the chickpeas and the green onion in the food processor for a few seconds to get a very coarse chop--my preference for consistency rather than mashed.  I also omitted the dill.  I served on WW bread with pea shoots and fresh tomato.  This will be a regular in my lunch rotation, and I'll definitely be experimenting!

As written, this didn't do it for me.  Criticisms others have made of dryness and blandness seem valid.  Given that I was looking for something to be able to take to work for lunch I did omit the onion.  I tasted a forkful from the food processor bowl and knew that I wouldn't eat this.  Rather than throw it, I decided to try and salvage it by doctoring.  I added more mayo, more celery, 2 hard boiled eggs, and quite a bit of pickle and some pickle juice.  It's much more like a tuna salad this way, but without the fishy tuna flavor that I also try to avoid at work.  After all the adjustng, I ended up with something I liked and that I'll probably repeat.

I made this exactly as written with the exception of using two green onions. It's fabulous! I will make this one often. I wouldn't change a thing, but it would be easy to mix it up with different addtitions. Thank you so much for sharing a healthy AND delicious recipe. P.S. I found it hard to mash the chickpeas with a fork so instead used my food processor for just a few seconds.

Excellent!  Double recipe, doesn't make much as is.  Used chopped matchstick carrots for added color, as well as half green onion/regular onion.  Mash beans slightly--no need to make it a paste!  Slightly mashed gives it wonderful texture!  Served on toasted wheat bread with some dijon mustard and lettuce!  Yum-O!

I changed this up a bit based on what I had on hand.  I was stuck home today with a sick child and didn't want to get him out, and I have been wanting to try this, but I didn't have the celery.  I ended up taking my can of chick peas, and warming over med/hi heat in a small sauce pan until warm.  I then drained and mashed with my hand masher.  I then sauteed half a chopped onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, about 1/8 cup of sun dried tomatoes (maybe a little more), and some fresh parsley in a little olive oil (I didn't measure it), and added this to the chick peas, then added a tsp of dijon mustard and a Tbsp of mayo.  OH MY GOSH!  This was SOOOO GOOD!  I had it on toasted bread, and I could have eaten it all, but I had to stop myself!  I will make this again and again!

A great staple for lunch!  Cheap, delicious, forgiving recipe, and it doesn't stink up the office and easy to mix up.  
Not a fan of dill, so I usually leave it out.  Tastes great with some curry powder and cayenne, or a splash of bbq sauce or mustard if you want to mix it up.

I love this recipe I only eat turkey and chicken and sometimes I get sick of turkey sandwiches. It's so good even my carnavore husband likes it. I put it on toasted wheat bread with hummus spreaded on the bread, sprouts and oil and vinager

This is really tasty! First time I made it I added a touch of garlic powder and curry. Topped with cucumbers instead of lettuce and served on crusty Italian bread. Man O man was it good. Second time I added a spicy chipolte seasoning, omitted the onion, added more lemon juice and garlic salt. Toasted french bread slices with some melted butter and topped the bread with the filling. Served them at a party as an appetizer and holy cow! everyone LOVED them. Even the meat eating men! You can even puree the spread in your food processor and serve with crackers as a dip! YUMMY

I can honestly say, I totally didn't care for this. Granted I tried 3 times and thought maybe it was the the brand of garbanzo beans I bought, but as I like all the ingredients, I didn't like them together in this dish. The combination really was a put off with my taste buds. I found all 3 times I had to add extra mayo to combined with and the lemon juice was just to much for my liking. It made it overly sour. It really over powered any dill taste to it what so ever. I'm sorry I won't be making this again.

I tweaked this a bit, but the only significant change was that I needed to add quite a bit more mayonnaise for it to hold together and not be dry.  It's really good though and surprisingly similar to tuna.  I will definitely make it again, what a clever idea :)

I dry sauteed the chickpeas with half an onion and some minced garlic to bring out the flavors more (especially in the onion). Then I took a little under half the mixture and hand mashed it. Mixed everything together, omitted the celery (not a personal fave) and added some coarse brown mustard...Thanks for the great idea!

This is an excellent combination of flavors. Instead of celery and dill weed, I added chopped dill pickle (I'm not a fan of celery in salads, but I still wanted the crunch) and a sprinkle of dill seed. I also used half a shallot instead of onion, for a milder flavor. I served it on onion rolls (ha!) with alfalfa sprouts. It's also delicious on veggie-flavored wheat crackers, or even by itself. I'll definitely keep this for a quick, healthy meal.

Surprisingly delicious! I used cilantro instead of dill and added red pepper- very similar to tuna salad but minus the tuna- I'm a vegetarian who is trying to eat less soy and more beans so this one is a definite keeper!

We made this pretty much as the recipe called for, except we didn't have any celery, and we used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  We also added a little more mayo than it called for and used fresh dill instead of dried.  I highly recommend fresh dill, because the dill flavor and aroma is more pronounced. Hopefully we will have celery next time we make it.  It tasted like egg salad (in fact, I believe it is BETTER than egg salad!)  We filled whole wheat pita bread with it and ate it that way. My teenagers really liked it, so we will definitely make it again.

I made this for 5 but put in too much onion - next time, FOLLOW DIRECTIONS! Spent 10 minutes trying to scoop out the extra onion. This is a pretty good recipe, although I had trouble mashing the garbanzo beans w/ a fork, as the directions indicated. If I made this again, I'd probably use a blender. I prefer the Holiday Chicken recipe to this, just 'cause I love my meat, but this is still a good vegetarian recipe. The dill gives it a nice flavor, but there's still something missing. Next time, I'd try adding shredded cheese or something to give it more oomph.

This turned out really well! I must agree with a few other people when they say its missing something. However, I made mine as a filling for pita bread. I would layer some lettuce, the chickpea filling, some cucumbers, cheese, and a little drizzle of italian dressing inside the pita bread and munch it down. With all those other ingredients in with the pita, it was pretty darn yummy. :)

This is good though it seems to be missing something. I may add some dijon mustard maybe 1/2- 1 tsp just to give it some extra flavor. Thanks!

I absolutely loved this. I added some sweet relish to the mix and left out the raw onion. I had it with some wholewheat crackers and salad and yes it is addictive....luckily I only made a small amount. I'm making it again tonight for dinner. I will probably try it with tortilla chips and carrot and celery sticks.

Just wanted to put my two cents worth in. My wife is not a vegetarian but also is not a meat lover (as I am!). I have made this several times for her and she loves it. It is also a very satisfying meal for me. We usually eat it as a wrap with a little lettuce and cheese. Goes great with some grilled veggies or a nice salad.

When I stopped eating meat, I really missed chicken salad. :( That was several years ago.... I was THRILLED to find this recipe! It really has the texture and flavor I missed from chicken salad.  I doubled the mayo (I used miracle whip) and diced veggies, for my personal preference. I did try it before adding the additional mayo and veggies and enjoyed it quite a bit as written. I didn't change anything else. It's a keeper and a staple in my fridge. I've tried it on toasted bread, pitas and crackers. Very versatile!

I think the recipe calls for too much onion and too little mayo. I added probably another teaspoon of mayo and it's still a little dry, but in the interest of trying to keep it on the healthy side I didn't add any more. I also only used about a quarter of an onion and that is plenty. Lastly, I added quite a bit of garlic to make this more exciting. Still needed some tomato and hot sauce to pull it together for me. Thanks for the recipe, I think it's a good base but needs a bit of tweaking.

This was good.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could!  I brought it to a training class for natural health professionals...served it with organic rice crackers.  Some people asked if it was tuna fish.  Can be addicting!!  Great for vegetarians! :)

Delicious alternative to meat! It tasted like both chicken and egg salad. Had to play with the mayo amount a little but other than that - perfect.

Good alternative to a traditional tuna filling, but it doesn't hold together as well, so it's best to use a pita or pocket bread.

This was wonderful! I left out the lemon juice because I'm not a big fan of the citrus bite, but it was great. I recommend a little less onion and a little more dill and celery but either way this was a great recipe. I had it on a marble rye pumpernickel bread and that was a fantastic combination.

A fabulous recipe.  I use less dill and also add a dab of mustard to suit my personal taste.  I also coursely chop the beans to give the filling a "meatier" texture.  I shared this recipe with my oldest daughter, who served it at a luncheon.  Lots of compliments, including several who thought it was chicken salad!  I also adjusted it for my youngest daughter and her family who are vegan.  Versatile, delicious and addicting.  Thanks for sharing.

I cooked a cup of garbanzo beans from scratch and so doubled the ingredients to add. I added a bit more lemon juice and another tablespoon of Miracle whip. Served it on toasted whole wheat bread with lettuce and carrot sticks. It's the bomb! I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow, when the flavors have a chance to meld. I'm a long-time vegetarian, so happy to find another lunch option. Thanks for sharing!

Used a food processor on the chickpeas but should have let it chop a little longer as the texture wasn't as smooth as I would have liked. I added the lemon juice, salt, pepper, onion powder, dill pickles, olive oil, baby carrots and water chestnuts (also used the processor), and a little mayo. Served it in a Flax n' Grains pita pocket with a slice of tomato and a few dashes of hot sauce, very good!

Great flavor. I didn't have a chance to let it marinate in the fridge before trying it, but we'll have the remainder tomorrow for lunch, and I have a feeling the flavors will be even stronger.  We added reduced fat feta cheese and served it on a whole grain wrap with baby spinach.  Delicious.

I made this for lunch for me and my husband today. We served this open faced on lightly toasted whole grain bread with a slice of tomato on top. I wasn't sure at first if this would be good, but I actually really liked it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I had some leftover chicpeas from making hummus.  I boil the whole bag which gives you about 6 cups of peas for the price of one can !!  I used fresh cooked peas and a dash of garlic powder.  Very good for lunch.  Healthy, easy and inexpensive; what more could you want?

After seeing this on the Recipe Buzz numerous times I finally tried it. I drained the chickpeas but didn't bother rinsing because I bought a low-sodium can. I am not a big fan of dill seasoning so I used 1 tsp instead of 1 Tblsp. I did like the light flavor of the mayo, lemon juice, and dill on the chickpeas. However, I did only use 1/3 of the dill suggested and a little more mayo would have been even better as it was a tad dry. The main problem however was with the onion which overpowered the flavor and texture of the chickpeas! I even used half the amount suggested. The celery seemed slightly out of place to. I wouldn't want to eat that much raw onion, especially for lunch. I may make it again with just the chickpeas, lemon juice, a little more mayo, and just a little dill. It is fine as a simple bean salad. The chickpeas just can't compeat with the onions and crunch of the onions and celery. They were the only taste and texture recognizable in the sandwich spread in my opinion.

This was great!!  I used green onions instead of regular onion but otherwise kept the recipe as written and it was fantastic!  I served it in pita bread with lettuce & tomato.  Easy & delicious!  My beans didn't mash well with a fork so after a couple of tries I just squished them with my hands.  I let it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge before eating and it was perfect! Thank you!

I made it as described in the recipe but found that it was WAY too much onion. I had to take out a bunch of it after it was mixed up because the onion flavour was overwhelming. I suggest less onion and to dice it up really fine. It was a light tasty spread/salad that will probably taste stronger the next day.

Absolutely a keeper. I roasted the chickpeas in a non-stick skillet for about 5 minutes, let cool, then followed the recipe as written. I believe roasting the chickpeas first brings out its flavor. Also, I used only about 1 tsp of lemon juice. I will be making this again, and again. Thank you!

It's been said before but WOW!  This makes such a great sandwich. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I did add pickle relish to the recipe and a dash of sea salt. I am also a vegan so instead of mayo I used veganaise. Throw everything in the food processor and its so simple! It reminded me of the egg salad sandwiches my mom used to make. Love It!!!

I like dill, but don't love it. So I made this following the recipe the first time and it was very good. I liked the consistency. Then last night I made it with cumin and cyanne pepper instead of dill and it was amazing. I also like to add carrot and green pepper to the mixture. This recipe is the perfect use for a slap chop.

This was delicious. I had to have two helpings at lunch. I left out the onions since I don't like raw onions and used a bit of onion powder instead. Also, vegenaise instead of mayo. I filled wheat tortillas and melted a bit of soy cheese on top. Vegan tuna melt! Very good! Thanks.

awesome!  New to being vegetarian and I was skeptical about chick peas in a sandwich.  I let it sit for a day at the suggestion of other reviewers and added a tad extra mayo (i'll try fat free sour cream next time instead) and sliced tomatos on whole wheat.  YUM!!

I really enjoyed this.  I used a purple onion but did not measure it (because I know what I like by looking), and I used Hellman's Light Mayo.  I would love to add diced red pepper and grated carrot next time. I added up all numbers and the entire recipe as I made it came out to be 10 PointsPlus on Weight Watchers. Very good on multigrain crackers as well as Pepperidge Farm Deli Flats. Makes a generous sandwich.  This recipe could easily be divided into 4 servings and still be plenty.

Yummy!!! Use a pastry blender or a ricer to mash chickpeas. Helps to keep chickpeas from flying around the kitchen. Also added some garlic.

Good, but mild in flavor. If you want to use as a filler and not just as a spread (good with a chicken sandwhich), then you'll need to tweek. Otherwise, thanks for the recipe!

I had my doubts because I am new to this vegetarian thing, but this is really really good. I mashed the beans, but not to a paste, they still had some substance to them. Added 2 stalks of celery and a bit more light mayo (it seemed dry). You really could not tell much of a difference between this and chicken or tuna salad. Something I will keep on hand in the fridge. Thanks~

We enjoyed this on whole wheat bread with pickles, sprouts and red bell peppers.  We're not crazy about lemon and dill in some things so we left that out and didn't miss it.  We plan to add some jalapenos next time.

This is my first review. A recipe has to REALLY knock my socks off and surprise me to illicit this type of response. I am not a vegetarian, which makes this review even more amazing. I loved loved loved this. Like, loved it in a way that I had to walk out of the kitchen because I was rapidly shoveling it into my mouth with a spoon and couldnt stop. It is like tuna or chicken salad but without the weird canned fish taste. I pretty much followed the recipe without actually measuring anything. Just a dump, stir and taste method. This will be a new staple in my lunch sandwich rotations.

Wow - what a great surprise!  Fast & easy to make with ingredients on hand.  Used a potato masher to mash up the beans.  Super fast.  Added mayo, chopped celery, dijon mustard, dill weed, dill relish and a hard boiled egg (just the white) - skipped the onion.  Basically made it the same way as tuna or egg salad.  Super yummy.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

This is absolutely delicious! Taste & consistency-wise, it is comparable to tuna or chicken salad - but BETTER! I had a hard time not eating the entire batch right out of the bowl, plain, right after I made it. 
The first time, I made it true to the recipe, and it was awesome. The second time, I decided to add a few things: one chopped hard-boiled egg, green onion instead of white, and about a tablespoon of pickle relish. For my personal preference, I prefer the one with the changes. 
I will say, my eight year old tried it, but did not care for this. My husband did not like it either, but this was fine - MORE FOR ME :)

Okay mashing canned garbanzos is really annoying. That is probably the biggest obstacle between me and making this again. Definitely use a processor or something if you have one... I expected it to be like mashing black beans, and it was a lot harder. Lesson learned. Anyway, I like this, but added extra spices/seasonings to our preference, like garlic powder... I also doubled the recipe and served it stuffed in red bell peppers and baked. It was pretty good, but I don't know if I would go out of my way to buy garbanzos for it. Now if I had a spare can on hand, that's different.

I've never liked chickpeas plain but this recipe dresses them up enough to where I don't taste just plain chickpeas. I halved the amount of onion and even then it was a little much for my personal tastes so I suggest adding a little at a time to your personal preference. Everything else I kept as is. Great sub for egg salad and so much healthier!

I made this for a late night snack spread when our cousins came to visit.   As it was for snacking, we ate it spread on wheat crackers instead of on pitas/rolls.  I omitted the celery per personal preference (though that crunch would be a welcome addition if you like celery!).  I found this to be a tad too lemony for my tastes, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.  I found the chickpeas easier to mash w/my potato masher than a fork.  THANKS for the recipe, FISHLOVE!

I made this today for lunch.  It is delightfully refreshing.  I made it with Helmans light mayonaise.  I only used 1/2 tsp of dill which is my preference.  I mashed the chickpeas with a potato masher instead of a fork.  I would make this again.  Thank you FISHLOVE.

I was skeptical because I am not a vegetarian, I only moderately like chickpeas, and am not a big fan of dill. I am, however, pretty open-minded culinarily speaking. I have to say, I tried this and I LOVE IT! I actually experience cravings for it! It is wonderful on pumpernickel and on hoagie rolls!!!

I love this recipe!  It's great on bread as a sandwich or as a dip with pita chips.  My husband who is skeptical of vegetarian dishes loved it as well.

This is perfect for a quick lunch. I made a bowl of this and bought a bag of pitas and I had a quick delicious lunch to bring to work for a week! I love that it is healthy, quick, and flavorful. I forgot to buy celery, which I think I will definitely add next time just for a little more texture.

This really is the best version of its kind! I personally like to add some sweet-n-hot pepper rings (diced up) for that tangy "somthin extra" but it's amazing as is! Thxs so much for posting this one:)

I really thought I would like this recipe, but the mixture of garbanzo, dill and mayo just seemed to weird to me. The flavors didn't mesh well and then texture was very bizarre.

Excellent base recipe!! I'm sure this recipe would be excellent just as is, but I added some hot sauce, chopped almonds, and grapes for a little sweetness.  I also used green onions instead and added a little bit of mustard.  Served it with romaine on whole wheat bread...YUM! I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors have time to meld!  I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This was, eh, not so good. Too much onion, too little mayo, and overall very sour/bitter. I'm a chick pea freak, so I was very excited about trying this, but alas: garbanzo fail :(

I did not care for this recipe. I love humus so I thought for sure I would like this. I think what turned me off was the dill weed. I like the idea of this dish but there needs to be some changes made. Maybe using garlic instead of the dill weed.

Add some Dijon and cayenne. This is so good and filling for a healthy lunch. I make all kinds of variations. Great with pita, a sandwich, on crackers and stuffed inside a juicy tomato.

Everybody really liked it.  I used 1 can of chickpeas and 1 can of white cannelloni beans mixed together.  I had some sun dried tomatoes I chopped up and put in.. I also used best foods mayo w olive oil. I had fresh from my garden basil & parsley so I chopped some of that up and threw it in.  My only complaint was it was runny and hard to keep on bread for sandwiches. Maybe  pita pocket bread would be better next time.

I had a few ripe farmer's market tomatoes to eat for lunch today, so I decided to have this filling with one on a sandwich.  While the filling was edible, I did not find it very good at all.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I enjoy my garbanzos, so I thought I'd really like this filling.  It definitely tastes like it's missing something to me.  UPDATE:  The husband came home and really liked it, so I upped the rating to 3 stars.  He even thought there was chicken in the filling.

Excellent!. It can also be made with pinto beans, which my mother in law tried after craving this but not having chickpeas like she thought. Believe it or not, both ways were incredible.

This was good.  I've been vegetarian for over 10 years, and to me this was remniscent of a chicken or tuna salad sandwich. I liked it.  (I skipped the onions in mine because I don't like onions).

So delicious!  You don't even realize you're not eating chicken salad.  I made mine the next time using curry powder, mayo and a bit of lemon and added raisins and sliced almonds - it was divine!  This has become a regular in our house - and my friend's houses too!

First of all, I'm a fan of chickpeas; I love hummus and falafel, so it was a surprise to me when this just ended up... bad. I felt like I put in a normal amount of mayonnaise (maybe more than the recipe called for) and it still turned out chalky and dry. I tried adding things to get it more moist/flavorful (like cream cheese, which I often substitute in for mayonnaise)--this helped a little. Because this is so simple, I'm pretty sure the fault was the recipe's; not mine.

This sounded really good, but it is a little more bland than I thought it would be. I didn't follow the recipe very closely though, so it is partially my fault.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Easy to make and very tasty.  I used a food processor to chop the chick peas, as the fork and potato masher just weren't cutting it.  The only minor change I made was a couple splashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce in place of the pepper.  Will definitely be a lunch staple for me.

Love this!  Made it in my food processor which gave it a nice, creamy texture (but still coarser than a hummus).  The lemon juice/dill is a nice combo with the chickpeas.  Very fresh tasting.  Will make this regularly.

Yum. I've made this twice now and have been having it for lunch on thin rolls with sliced cucumber and tomato. So good. I don't usually buy celery, so left it out. Other than that, everything else is the same. It's definitely better after sitting in the fridge for a day.

I made this with about 2/3 cup plain yogurt instead of mayo.  I also added about 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese and used garlic salt instead of regular.  Delicious.

These were good, not great. If I was a vegetarian I may have rated them higher. It was a lot like tuna, but non-fishy.

I used yogurt instead of mayo, since it's much better for you. This was a refershing lunch. I put it in pitas with some tomatoes and lettuce. I enjoyed the texture. I left out the onion as I don't like raw onion and added extra celery (I love the crunch). I will make this again. Nice, light and healthy. A con: not much on the flavor. Some jalapeno would be delicious diced up in it to give it some kick.

Very good!  I added 2 more tsp of mayo just personal taste.  I rolled this in a wheat tortilla and added a slice of tomato and pickle- absolutely yummy!!  Thanks for the recipe!

What a delicious & quick recipe!! A definite keeper. Good for my family of vegetarians and carnivores alike. The food processor worked beautifully to mash the chickpeas. I also added curry b/c we my family loves curry.

I'm not really a fan of dill with this mix, so I recommend usuing a chipotle/mayo mix or adding dijon mustard and a dash of prepared yellow mustard.

This is a good recipe.  It has a slight flavor of tuna fish, and I'm not fond of tuna fish so this gets a 3 star.  But it was a descent filler and am sure many will enjoy it.

This reminds me of "mock tuna salad" recipes.I've made plenty of those using tofu but I prefer this.The texture is great and it's cheap.An easy and quick sandwich to pack up for a picnic.I used more mayo.I like this because it's not hummus!

Healthy, filling, and also economical.  I'm not in love with this recipe, but am glad to have an alternative to lunchmeat sandwiches.  This is easy to make and pack for work and makes it easier to choose something healthful.

I tried it without the mayo and it was still delicious.  I put more lemon juice and added two cloves of garlic.  Next time, I will add a soy based mayo to give it a better consistency.  Overall, a great and easy recipe!

This gets 5 stars because it's an excellent base recipe. I can change it to fit my taste. I doubled the batch, used veganaise, added chopped red bell pepper for color, and used a 1/4 of a large onion. Holy smokes that's still a bit too much onion. I also spiced it up with smoked paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and a dash of cayenne pepper. It's fantastic on crackers. Tomorrow I'll bring it for lunch in a pita with sprouts. I think I'll try this as a pasta salad as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

I needed to add a bit more mayo as it was too dry.  I addd extra celery and skipped the onion.  This was FABULOUS!!!   I spread it on some Naan and also dipped celery sticks in it.  Absolutely delicious.

The beans mash better with a potato masher.  I gave this recipe four stars the first time I made it; I didn't add the lemon juice because of taste preference.  The second time I substituted apple cidar vinegar for the lemon juice... five stars easily!!!  Yum!!!  Add a 1/4 cup parmesan cheese with a 1/2 tsp garlic powder... you'll thank me later.

I can't seem to make enough of this to last! I usually add a baby pepper or two and LOTS of garlic. makes such an awesome sandwich. I substitute plain Greek yogurt for the mayo. I keep trying different things in it and so far they have all been good!

Pretty delicious, i would say it resembles egg salad a little more than tuna... so since i'm lacto/ ovo I added a couple chopped hard boiled eggs because i wanted to stretch it. I also played with it a little like i would when making egg or tuna salad and added half a green bell pepper i wanted to use up and some chopped green onions that were starting to wilt. Great basic idea and jumping off point to do what you like with.

This was pretty good. The only change I made was to make it VEGAN, so I used Veganaise instead of mayo. It's versatile, so next time I think I will try adding different veggies. I used this on spelt bread and it was tasty, and there was lots left over for the next lunch. It will probably be even better then once the dill absorbs into everything.

I thought it was pretty bland and there was definitely not enough mayo to make it a sandwich spread. I supposed it could be enhanced with other ingredients.

This is AMAZING! I had a lot of chickpeas but in bags so I had to soak them over night then put them to boil the next day. I added 1/4 of yellow & red bell peppers, 1/2 of tomato and 2 boiled egg whites all finely chopped. I also added celery salt, a pinch of savory and a pinch of seasoning salt aside from the salt and pepper used in the recipe. It turned out terrific and my family enjoyed every bit of it!

This was a fresh, light sandwich filling akin to a tuna salad.  Even my kids ate these sandwiches without a second thought. It is a nice base and you can easily customize it with veggies and toppings you like.

I added some cayenne pepper to make it a little spicier and substituted tartar sauce for the mayonnaise. This is a perfect alternative to the usual chicken salad.

I made as directed but it still needed something. More flavor.  So I added sweet pickle. I ate it the next day and it was quite tastey. I ate the sandwich with veggie straws  on the side. I will definitely make again.

I was skeptical...but this fake chicken salad is WONDERFUL! I sadly didn't have any celery, but I put in my usual apples, pecans, garlic powder, red curry powder, salt and pepper and it came out tasting as if it were tuna or chicken salad! I'm so happy to of found this recipe. I will use it again and 
"preach" the meatless good news to others.

Wow!  This recipe was just what I was looking for to fill pita bread!  The recipe as written is GREAT.  Easy to modify with other ingredients.  Adding mustard gives the recipe a egg salad taste.  Highly recommend this recipe.

I didn't love this. It was too oniony and the flavours didn't really stand out (or maybe they were overwhelmed by the onion.) I'm not going to try it again.

Simply delightful!  It's perfect the way it is.  I used a bunch of fresh dill, garlic, yogurt, and red pepper flakes.  I love it plain, or cradled in lettuce!  Thanks FISHLOVE!

Fast, easy, tasty!
I normally can't stand those reviews that change everything, but I did...
I didn't have celery, so I put in some cucumber. Didn't care to chop onion so added some green pepper. Lime juice instead of lemon.
Delicious!

We really liked this. It was easy and tasty. I only used about 1/4 of an onion and still felt it was too oniony. I also added about 3 extra tablespoons of mayo to make it more like a spread and added a little hot pepper sauce.

Excellent alternative to the same old tired lunch options.  I like that this version has celery.  The only change I made was adding about 1/2 tbs more mayo than called for (mine was a bit drier without this) and I used fresh herbs instead of dried dill weed.  I only wish I had discovered it sooner!

i used a handheld potato masher to mash the beans. i also used lite mayo... paprika, rather than dill, with some smokehouse blackpepper. Served with a warmed pita.  My toddlers gobbled this up for lunch. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

Wasn't sure what to expect....but this was really good.  Very filling, cheap, tasty, and EASY.  I also found it a pain to mash with fork and didn't feel like dirtying any dishes so I put on a disposable glove and squeezed them to the right consistency.  Thanks..

A brilliant alternative to tuna sandwiches.  I didn't have any dill so I was going to add some minced dill pickles but noticed I had pickled pepperocini peppers.  I minced them up and added a bit of the juice also.  This is going into my regular rotation - love it!!

Simple yet delicious...I had forgotten a lemon at the store, so I used a bit of lemon pepper seasoning instead.  Also, for some added dimension, I chopped up some sundried tomatoes and threw them in.

So good that I am reviewing it and sharing it with my facebook friends before I am even half done with my sandwich.  I would be a horrible friend not to share it!  I did use the recipe as a guideline.  I did everything 'to taste' and added a little garlic pepper.  I also followed someone else's advice and used olive oil mayo.  Next time I will try to save some of the chickpea juice to use in place of, or in conjunction with the mayo.  Its taking all my will power not to devour the whole bowl!!!

I have to admit I was skeptical about this recipe but decided to try it anyway and I'm glad I did. It was delicious. I doubled it and made a few changes. I didn't add as much lemon juice or onions but did add more dill weed and celery. Like another reviewer, I added a little of the chick pea liquid and used a potatoe masher and it worked out great. I highly recommed that you refrigerate over night to let the flavors come together. I served it on toasted pita bread, lettuce, tomato, havarti with dill cheese, and cucumber. This would make a great dip with pita chips.

I absolutely LOVED this (and I am not a vegetarian)!! I made it exactly as written except made more and didnt really measure my ingredients, but I def. added more mayo than recipe calls for! I didnt mash my garbanzo beans either, just kinda smashed them a bit but they stayed pretty whole! I stuffed them in a whole wheat pita with some lettuce and enjoyed it so much that I am making more now! :)

Very yummy, I put in a little less onion so it wasn't as overpowering. Just a simple change to my preferred tastes. Great recipe! Thanks!

I think this is an amazing alternative for vegetarians who miss a hearty tuna salad sandwich.  Even my non-vegetarian boyfriend thought it was great.  I am totally making this again tomorrow.  Best I've found yet!!

Seriously!!! This was so very good!...May try with small white beans too...and fresh dill instead of dried. I also used red onion as my onion of choice. Simple, healthy, tasty and very filling...I ate mine on a whole wheat 100 cal. sandwich thin. A great lunch and hubby even enjoyed. Will be making again. Thanks!

When made with dill, it becomes "toona" salad. When made with poultry seasoning instead, it becomes "chik'n" salad. It might not have 100% of the same taste, but the consistency is similar. And it tastes wonderful. I make a double batch on Sunday & take some in a container to work all week. I use fat-free Miracle Whip to make it more Weight Watcher friendly.

Love it.  This is a great, filling recipe as is but there is also a lot of room to add and subtract based on tastes and likes.  I love to top it with thinly sliced cucumbers and I use a lot more dill weed than called for.  I can't wait to try it with vegenaise.  As a new vegetarian (almost a month), this recipe has really come in handy as a quick, filling, and tasty meal.

This was a good alternative to other salads and would make a decent dip. However, this was a pretty average dish.

Was a little dry.  Had to add a touch of Italian dressing to moisten.  A dash of Tony Cachere's seasoning added a little zing also!

I have made this twice now and it is excellent.  As others have said, it really improves if you give it time to marinate, so make it the night before or at least several hours before serving.  The dill is crucial, so don't leave it out and use fresh dill if you can.  I don't buy canned beans but cook the dried beans from scratch and for extra moisture, add a tablespoon of plain yogurt to the filling.  I use half chopped cooking onion and half green onions.  Didn't have any celery, but it was still very good.

I thought this was quite good.  Chickpeas themselves are a bit bland, so I added a little bit more mayo/lemon juice/dill than the recipe called for.  I also added some ground mustard.  I like the option that I can swop the mayo for veganaise and have a good vegan sandwich filler.

I made this for a fundraiser. It needed to be vegetarian, so this was a good option. We could have gone with a bit less onion, and the end result was okay, but not amazing. I'm on the line as to whether or not we could use this again.

Loved it sooo much! I used finely diced bell peppers instead of celery and added about a teaspoon of parsley, w/ just a tad bit more mayonnaise and lemon juice, I also used sea salt. It was phenomenol! This is my new favorite sandwich.

As is, this is a 4 for a great base. I always forget the lemon juice and don't like onions so here's what I end up doing: In addition to the dill weed and mayo, I add dijon mustard, onion and garlic powder and salt and pepper. I also like to dice up some carrots and throw those in for extra crunch. Yummy!

The salad will be ad good as the peas you buy/cook. This is a great base for a chick pea "salad."  No onions no lemon.  I used extra dill and mustard and celery and cheepo mayo.  The canned peas are a little dense.  I think I will add egg next time and cook my own peas.  And maybe some Beau Monde.  Wish I had the onion and lemon.  Onion would be beautiful.

This was delicious and very easy to make! Since I did not have any dried dill, I used about 1/2 teaspoon curry powder and 4 to 5 sprigs of fresh thyme. We spread it on a flatbread adding a few pieces of sliced cucumber and a few halved cherry tomatoes. Yummy, and healthy too!

This is wonderful!  I added fresh chopped basil and diced avocado.  I served it one time over fresh spinach as a salad and another time I served it stuffed in a tomato.  It's very filling and delicious.  Enjoy!

This is yummy, with a very different flavor. Followed the recipe exactly, but I would REALLY recommend a food processor, because doing it with a fork, the texture was a bit off. I also served mine warm, on a whole grain bagel. Yum!

Yum! What a perfect weekday lunch item :) I added chopped scallions and red pepper, and made this into a flatbread melt with some cheese on top. Next time, I'll probably add a little more mayo (my salad came out a little bit dry). Otherwise awesome and a great alternative to chicken or tuna salad!

A tad on the dry side but nothing a little more mayo can't fix. Hubster and children don't care for it. That just means more for me. :) Left out the celery as a personal preference but think I will mix in some chopped cucumber for a little crunch. Makes a nice panini.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the whole idea of this recipe is brilliant, and I NEVER would have thought of it. I'm a vegetarian, but I used to love tuna salad sandwiches. The way I made this brought me right back to that love, without having to eat fish. I used the chickpeas, mayo, onions, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. I'll be making this over and over forever. Thank you for introducing this to me.

This was great! Perfect for a quick afternoon lunch.  I added a 1/2 cup of quinoa that I cooked in vegetable broth, through in a few more of each vegetable and used veganaise (instead of mayo). So delicious!

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!  We had to make a few adjustments though because we didn't have all the ingredients.  No garbanzo beans in the house so we substituted dried Lima Beans. I'm not a fan of celery so instead of the onion we used chopped chilies. Merry Christma Bill!

I really, really, REALLY enjoyed this! I reminded me of tuna salad. I made this exactly as written, adding extra mayo to taste. I had mine on WW bread, but this would be wonderful in a pita or wrap. I will definately be making this MANY times! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really excellent, especially as a sandwich filler for vegetarians. Very filling and so many possibilities. Great on bread, crackers, and stuffed into a hollowed out pepper! The original recipe is pretty amazing on its own, my only variation on my second try making this was to add a bit of curry for a curried chickpea salad. Thank you for this recipe, what a great idea!

This a good starter recipe fr me but it didn't have enough flavor so I added a small can of black beans, a teaspoon of cumin, a teaspoon of turmeric, a tablespoon of yellow mustard, and I add in whatever vegetables I have on hand, such as red bell pepper and chopped grapes.  My husband now eats this almost every day for lunch and loves it.

I brought this to a group picnic, thinking that I would probably end up taking this home.  The non-vegetarians ate it up and asked for the recipe! It was excellent!  I used baby carrots instead of celery, but I add some celery seed.  I also added flax seeds to get in my Omega-3.  I will definitely make this again!

Great alternative to chicken or tuna salad! I served it on croissants with lettuce and tomato, and the next day had leftovers on top of a lettuce salad with tomatos.

I am so glad I finally tried this recipe.  I mashed the chickpeas with a potato masher and then a fork, but it was still a little chunky for my taste.  Next time I'll throw them in the food processor.  This is going to be a staple in my house this summer.

I changed this quite a bit, but I'm giving it five stars anyway because it's a brilliant idea I never would have thought of on my own.  First, I mashed with a potato masher.  I doubled the mayo (used olive oil mayo), subbed dried basil for the dill, added garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  The rest I kept the same.  This is a great alternative to tuna salad for my seven year old, because I don't have to worry about mercury.  I will definitely be making this often!

This is really good.  My vegetarian daughter loved it, as well as, the meat eaters in my family.  Reminds me of a non-fishy tuna salad.  I did the recipe just like it said.  Next time I may try just a touch less lemon juice.

Oh man this is tasty! I'm unable to read ingredient amounts and accidentally added 1tblspn of dill (thankfully I love dill!) so to counter it I added a bit more mayo, a bit more lemon juice. I also added some minced up garlic. Since chickpeas are so plain yet tasty I can imagine the possibilities are near endless on what you can customize with this recipe. You could add carrots, paprika to give it spice, use Italian seasoning instead of dill. I will say mashing chickpeas with a fork is *not* fun. Use a potato masher or a food processor (neither of which i have...yet). I'm really glad I decided to make this for lunch today!

As it stands, this recipe is pretty bland. I am going to give it another shot with what some of the other reviewers have suggested. That should make it at least a four instead of a two and a half to three.

Really really good.  Used fresh dill and lemon juice chopped celery and chives.  I can't eat raw onion, but I put a slice on my husband's sandwich. The dill and lemon give it the seafood vibe without the fishy thing.  It's so hard to find a decent cheap veggie filling.  I will make this again definitely.  Had it with lettuce and tomato on a kaiser roll.

Pretty good. I threw the chickpeas onions and celery in the food processor and pulsed until it looked right then added about 2 tbsp mayo, the lemon juice, and about 1 tbsp dijon mustard. Kiddos liked it. I added sliced tomato to mine...yum.

This is absolutely fabulous with warmed homemade tortillas. Think I'll make it again tonight, it's been a while. What I like doing with it is stuff it into a pita, add some Swiss cheese, then bake in the oven until the pita is crispy and the cheese is melted. But I'm definitely trying Babzil's way of spreading it onto flatbread.

I absolutely love this recipe. I make it in my food processor, using two baby dill pickles, one peeled carrot, a can of chickpeas, a bit of dill, black pepper, celery and low-fat miracle whip. It's so easy, and an awesome lunch as a sandwich, veggie dip, or spread on Wasa bread.

I was overall pretty pleased.

I used Cannelini beans in place of chickpeas (fewer calories), but I needed to warm them slightly in the microwave to make them soft enough to mash-I would not use a fork! Use a flat wooden spoon!

I also used fat free Italian dressing insted of mayo, though I had to use a hint more dressing than the recipe calls for. Not as much onion is needed either. I also cut up a few grapes.

Absolutely let it set over night (covered in the fridge) if you want it to be moist.

Very tasty!!!

This is great! I used Smart Beat, a nonfat mayo alternative and added garam masala and chili powder as suggested by another reviewer (I left out the dill obviously). I also served it on a salad of baby spinach, alfalfa sprouts, tomato and avocado. Next time I might try lemon pepper to see if that lends another alternative flavor. Great recipe, thanks!!

I really liked this but my family didn't.  I added some garlic to spice it up a little. I will make this again.

Great veggie option for sandwiches.  Tastes good.  Also can top with sauerkraut, and eat as open face sandwich.

I used significantly more than a tablespoon of mayo, and more than a teaspoon of fresh dill. I served it on toasted challah bread with tomato slices. I'm a meat eater but I actually liked this better than my vegetarian son did. Next time I'll make it a day ahead. I'll bet it's better after sitting overnight.

As a former lover of tuna salad and now wanting to keep animal products out of my diet... this is amaaaazing! I use Just Mayo to make it vegan, and add a little mustard! Love eating it w Ritz style crackers, and a great "dip" for get togethers! So fast and easy. Love this!

For this recipe I followed the ingredients list, but not any of the amounts. I also replaced the celery with red bell pepper because I'm not a fan of celery and I added mustard for flavor.  The end result was wonderful, and very similar to egg salad. This could be a great item for picnics. I will be making it again.

This was a hit with the girls at our monthly neighborhood
get together.  I served with crackers and also pita bread.
The recipe definitely needs more mayonnaise and I  added
garlic powder and a dash of dry mustard.  May try a little
cayenne next time.

I made this for a ladies’ luncheon and it was gobbled up. I made it one day ahead as suggested for blending of flavors. Added a little extra mayo the day of serving to make it creamier. My husband are the leftovers on crackers. Yummy.

This is a fantastic recipe!   I omitted the celery and lemon juice and added relish, mainly because of what I had and didn’t have on hand. I’ve made it four times already. It is a great alternative to tuna salad.

If you can’t give this recipe 5 stars then you lack imagination because there is so many delicious ways to tweak it!  My daughter added Greek seasoning and ricotta cheese.  I added chopped jalapeños and lime juice.  You could add chopped egg, low-cal citrus vinaigrette etc., etc.  1/2 cup is a big fat sandwich!  I like it in a pita pocket with arugula and sliced tomato.  Keeps all week in the refrigerator

My family and I liked it. It was pretty quick and easy to prepare.  I made it as a side dish over greens along with a chicken dish but it could easily have been a main meal. If you ARE making it as a main meal, depending on how many you're feeding, I would probably have doubled the recipe. Would definitely make it again.

It was so delicious! I bought a 16oz can of garbanzo instead of 19oz. I used a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice and dill instead of 1tsp.  I substituted green pepper instead of celery. I used my organic Pepperman seasoning substituting salt and pepper and Miracle Whip substituting mayo. I served mine on a wheat flour tortilla with tomato slices. The taste was great. Next time I will add something with a kick just to boost the flavor a bit more!

I can't say enough about how good this is, and it's so versatile. The first time I made it I followed the recipe and really liked it. Since then I've made changes depending on what I have a taste for and it's good every time! I think my favorite was today's version; Miracle Whip (out of mayo but I think I like it even better with Miracle Whip), onion flakes, dried mustard, beaumond, dill, and topped with salted tomato slices.

We love this recipe in our house. I needed a vegetarian recipe for family coming over for lunch and came across this one. We all loved this spread and it has become a family staple. Kids and grownups alike devour this when it's made. And as a bonus, the kids easily help make this one:)

I added shredded carrots, swapped the onion for powered, plus an extra tbs. of mayo (Just Mayo brand). Topped off the sandwich with spinach and it was delish! Next time I will reduce the amount of dill weed as it seemed to overpower the rest of the flavors.

Made it with 2 cans (31oz) chickpeas, 1.5 large stalks celery, 3/4 onion, about 3 TBS mayo, added minced garlic. Used yogurt instead of mayo for toddler. Probably doesn't need lemon when using yogurt. Made just enough for 8 small pitas (8oz).

Amazing! I used 2 cans of chicken peas instead of 1 because I add more veggies like green and red onions. Also used organic spicy mayo and a few dollops of miracle whip. I eat very little meat but I added some real bacon bits too. Not those fake flakes. Wow! between the awesome flavors and textures, this is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I have recently started eating a plant source diet.  We have found that there is no substitute for meat, we just need to find vegan/vegetarian meals that we like.  We really like this!  We prefer to eat it with crackers like hummus.  It is one of those recipes that you don't miss the meat at all. It's a great substitute for tuna/chicken salad. Followed the recipe exactly, but used vegan mayo.

This is really good. I made it exactly as the recipe said and though not a huge dill fan found that to be the exact right ingredient for this. Light and refreshing, and different from hummus. Thanks for sharing.

This is awesome! So easy like making tuna salad, but it being made with chickpeas makes the oceans and my body healthier and happier! It's a win win!!

Thank you for this yumm recipe! I love chickpeas, they are so healthy, but sometimes there are no quick ways to prepare them, until I found this. The only things that I changed was that I cooked the chickpeas from scratch (I had a bag of dried, peeled and halved chickpeas), I cooked the onion instead of having it raw (mostly because of family preference) and I also added a bit more mayo since the chickpeas were a bit dry (they were cooked until all the water evaporated). I followed the suggestion of serving this with greek yogurt and cucumber. Husband and toddler loooved it too!

Yum!! Didn't have any celery, so I diced up a small cucumber instead. Spread it on toast and topped it with some slices of fresh garden tomato. Will be making this again!

This is easy and delicious! I did was add extra lemon and instead of mayo used Fage 2% plain Greek yogurt because one of my vegetarian guests has an aversion to mayo. For anyone who doesn't like/want mayonnaise, this was a great substitution! I served this spread on large spinach wraps, along with spinach, tomato and shredded carrot (honestly, for the color!) and then cut each with a diagonal cut. I should have made more because  even though my gathering had delicious turkey and roast beef sandwiches, a lot of the meat-eaters wanted to eat these wraps!

Why did I wait so long to make this?! This recipe has been in my box forever and I've honestly missed out on this quick and super easy deliciousness by not trying it sooner! I used all the ingredients listed, but honestly didn't measure out anything -- just seasoned to my liking, plus added a bit of dijon mustard as well. I mashed the chickpeas with a potato masher until I got the desired texture. I liked that there were a few whole/barely mashed chickpeas! Served open-faced on a slice of whole wheat bread, I topped it with a slice of swiss cheese and a pickle on the side. It reminded me a bit of a tuna salad/egg salad sandwich. From pantry to belly in about 5 minutes, this will most definitely be made again! I'm going crazy thinking about the various ways to serve this!

I'm always looking for simple alternatives to meat and fish as I have a picky vegetarian teen at home!  I was so amazed that it turned out so well!  I served it on a tortilla wrap with lettuce, julienned carrots, cucumbers and diced tomato!  It was a great hit!  Thank you:)

Amazing recipe! As a pescetarian transitioning to full vegetarian, this recipe is simply perfect! I omitted the dill (didn't have any in the pantry) and added a little bit of honey mustard and it was phenomenal!

Piece of advice: use the bottom of a water glass instead of a fork to crush the garbanzo beans. 

As a vegetarian who doesn't really like to eat stuff that looks like "health-food", I was pleasantly surprised by how good this tasted. I did add some extra lemon juice and mayo to make it a bit more flavorful though. Oh, and it stayed good for more than 4 days (the time it took me to eat it all). It made enough for four or five sandwiches.

I'm vegan and I'm loving it.  This is so far the best chickpea sandwich filling I've eaten.  I put it on toasted bread with broccoli sprouts, lettuce and tomatoes.  This definitely my go to from now on.

Just  for transparency,  I did a couple of things different  from the recipe.  I used a one-person sized container of plain greek yogurt in place of the mayo and used green onions for the 1/2 onion to add some crunch for the celery I didn't use (don't care for it).

This stuff is bangin'.  Seriously.  I sprinkled a little feta cheese on top of my sandwich and I made this weird animal happy sound after the first bite that startled my husband.

Delicious! I used 1/4 onion instead of the 1/2, there was plenty of onion. I also added in 2 chopped hardboiled eggs. If I had any garlic in the house I would have added a couple cloves. Served on a Pita with hummus (I just can't get enough chickpeas), tomato and Avocado. Will eat again and again!

Excellent as-is, but I sometimes add chopped cilantro and smoked paprika, which makes it fabulous. Try serving it on marble rye. Awesome!

This filler is very tasty. I cut the chickpeas so they were still a bit chunky. The celery, onion, dill and lemon juice gave it a great flavor, while the mayo added a creaminess. The filler is good as a sandwich as well as on a bed of lettuce as a salad. Next time I make it, I will experiment by adding grapes and maybe some pecans. You just can't go wrong with this recipe!

I make this on a fairly regular basis.  My daughter and I enjoy it as either a sandwich or with crackers. I add more mayo than called for by the recipe as I prefer a more moist texture.

This is the best chickpea sandwich spread I have tried!  And I have made several from different food blogs. 

I started out using way less onion than the recipe calls for - I used a red onion, and I omitted the lemon because I don't like my food tangy.  It was really good when I tasted it, but then I made the mistake of adding a pickle and some black olives to it.  That totally changed the flavor, so to rescue it, I added the full amount of onion called for, plus added the lemon the recipe called for!!  

I think I would have liked it exactly as written... I will try that next time, or I may leave out the lemon and cut back on the onion, since I liked it that way, too.

At any rate, I think it is a great recipe and I'll definitely try it again!

I'm not even vegetarian, and really enjoyed this. It's a nice change of pace from hummus. Great texture and flavor. I had it on some crusty Italian bread with lettuce and tomato, but it would be great served many other ways. Some people mentioned adding garlic, but I would encourage you to try it without it first.

Absolutely delicious and highly addictive! I added a little garlic and some cilantro that I had on hand (in addition to the dill). Fresh lemon juice is key to the dish, IMO. This simple combination of ingredients yields a delightful flavor that has me eating...well...most of it in one sitting. :-D

This was an easy and delicious alternative to a chicken salad (great as a vegetarian). I really liked it and thought it was even better with a spicy mustard on a lettuce wrap. I read another review who added yogurt - sounds great as well!

This is a very versatile recipe! I used half mayo/half olive oil, garlic, and a bit of hot sauce instead of the mayo, celery (personal preference), dill and lemon juice and it turned out great. I also left out the onion, but only because I already planned to have it on my sandwich. I ate it right away, but after a couple hours in the fridge the flavors will combine more.

Easy and tasty. For fun I also tried swapping the dill out for curry, cumin and cilantro, and the lemon for lime juice. Yum.

I doubled the recipe and added just a bit more mayonnaise.  To me the recipe reminds me of a chicken salad.  It was  very good, but didn't go over well with my husband and son.   I think it needs to be refrigerated for a few hours to a day to let the flavors meld together.  It was even better a day later, and even better a day after that.  Its a great on the go meal if you pack lunches.

Delicious! I made this last week and it was enough for 3 sandwiches. It's very tasty & filling. I toasted honey wheat bread and spread this on top (I added a piece of cheese one day as well). I used about 1 tsp of onion powder instead of a real onion because I eat this for lunch at work and raw onion can offend! It's still just delicious.

Tried this recipe out because I've been trying to eat healthier. This was fast and easy to make. It's very fresh tasting and even ate it as breakfast the next morning ;) Only substitution I made, again to be healthier, was in place of the mayonnaise I did half Dijon mustard and half plain yogurt. The whole thing didn't last 24 hours it was so good!!

I skipped the lemon juice and dill. Used a green onion instead of a regular one. Added two hard boiled eggs, a little bit of mustard and plenty of low-fat plain Greek yogurt.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  This has a great flavor.  The only thing I will do differently is to put the beans in my mini food processor. Smashing them with a fork did not work very well.

I can't get over how good this is! So tasty, hearty and satisfying. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of onion. I used about 1/4 cup red onion. The rest was done as written. I will make this again and again!

This is a yummy filling, i found it a bit on the bland side however, i do love to cook with spices, so i added some seasoned salt and smoked paprika with a little more lemon juice than the recipe calls for and it came out amazing!

Quick and tasty!  Made this several times - I like the dill in it, but usually use half the celery and add a little garlic.  Really nice with about a teaspoon of dijon mustard, too!  Yummy filling for pita pockets with cucumbers and spinach, and great spread on crackers, too!

I used a food processor to mash the beans, placed in a bowl to mix in the other ingredients. I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil mayo, as suggested by another poster. I left the onion and celery a little larger than I normally would chop, which provided a nice crunch. I didn't have dill, so I made it without dill. I served it with baby spinach, ripe red tomatoes, salt & pepper, on a whole wheat pita.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! So simple and so delicious! I will be making this on a regular basis now.

Very good flavor (I also added garlic as other reviewers did) but the texture was quite dry and crumbly. I didn't want to add additional mayo and up the calories, so perhaps it would be better using liquid from the can of chickpeas? Not sure if I will try it a second time or not.

This is amazing. I added a little chili paste to spice it up a bit and ate with some rice crackers to keep it GF. Might knock the whole bowl off in one sitting.

I like chickpeas, dill, tuna salad-type dishes...but I really didn't like this. I think that the texture of the chickpeas just didn't work in a dish like this for me. However, I think that the sauces/seasonings might be good if made with tuna instead (maybe I just wanted tuna salad in the first place!)

I added some Parmesan cheese and sweet relish after I tasted the original recipe. I used a hand-held pastry blender to mash the beans, worked perfectly. I will be making this again!

My daughter is a vegetarian I tried it because I thought it would be something different for her to eat. She does like but we have to cut back on the onion.  I did follow the recipe didn't add anything extra. I made it in my food processor if you have one use it. It's done in minutes.

Awesome recipe and easy to change a little bit to make it your own.  I added some chopped brown olives and a couples shakes of tobasco to give it some kick!  Going into a spinach wrap for lunch tomorrow, well see how it goes!

This was soooo good! I didn't have any lemon juice, or Dijon mustard, so I used 1 tsp brown mustard and 1 tsp lime juice. I added one more tsp water to make it blend better. Use a food processor, and then add the chopped celery. I love this recipe!

If you like chicken salad, then you'll like this! I used greek yogurt because that's all I had, and it worked great and even healthier! I did use much more than one tablespoon though. Also added a squirt of mustard for a little more flavor. My husband didn't like it as much as I did, but he's a big meat-lover. Best part is, it's soooo filling! I'd definitely make again!

This was AMAZING with just a few tweaks. I added a bunch of spices and tons of fresh garlic. We loved it, and it held well for a couple days to make sandwiches later in the week.

So delicious! I added cucumbers and ate it in a whole wheat pita bread pouch with some tzatziki sauce it was perfect! Although i did take out the onions because i don't like raw onions.

Added in some mashed potato as well. basically tastes like a tuna salad! I think next time I will add sliced mushrooms and green onions with a bit less regular onion. Did not have dill weed but I added parsley for fun :P

This is amazing. I toasted some pita bread in the oven, then filled it with this, plus lettuce and feta cheese and it is definitely my new favorite lunch to make! I only used 1/4 of an onion because I felt that 1/2 would have been too overpowering. And I chopped up carrots too. So good!!

This is such a quick and delicious meal! I have been desperate for a vegetarian alternative to tuna salad, and let me tell you this hits the spot. I mashed the chickpeas with a potato smasher to make them extra squishy, and I noticed if it sits in the fridge for a day I have to add a little extra salt. This is a perfect emergency party snack for when you don't have much food in the house, because the only thing that you need to keep fresh is the celery. I served it open face on wheat toast with a little cheddar, but honestly it's just as good to shovel it down with a fork. I have to double the recipe because it doesn't last long. Thank you thank you thank you!

This needs a lot more seasoning, I think... But a good base recipe to add different stuff in it.

Delicious, easy and healthy.   I used fewer onion because I'm not a huge raw onion fan.  Also added some olive slices.  Really good.

I'm not a vegetarian but I wanted something different so I decided to try it, in spite of the fact that I don't care for cold beans or raw onions.  I'm so happy I did!  It needs to sit overnight for the flavors to meld.  I spread it on whole wheat pita bread with lettuce & tomato and brought it to work for lunch.  I took a few bites before I put it away for lunch and now I can't stop nibbling at it.  Considering the low cost and simplicity of this, I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing! Thank you for sharing this with us. Hard to keep some for the next day, it's that good.  I added about 5 tbsp. of mayo and a little more dill, everything turned out great and delicious. 
I did boil the chickpeas for a few minutes and it made them easier to digest.  Taste like chicken/tuna filling.  Miam!

My family loved this recipe! I made a couple of changes based on other reviews. I doubled the recipe and instead of celery, I added carrots and garlic(3 cloves). I drained the garbanzo beans, added water and cooked them for 10 min. to soften them. I then sautéed the carrots, onion, garlic with coconut oil until soft. I substituted ranch dressing for mayo, the juice from 1 lemon, and a dash of parsley. I filled a warm pita pocket with the mixture, topped with fresh spinach and a small amount of mozzarella cheese. I baked the pita at 350 degrees until the cheese was melted. This recipe was amazing!

Tasty!  I used the base proportions and changed it up a little. I'm no fan of raw onion, so I sauteed onion with some garlic and let the mixture cool.  Put the chick peas, onion/garlic, and dill in the food processor with a little lemon juice, a squeeze of spicy mustard, and a tablespoon of tartar sauce instead of plain mustard.  Added a little salt and black pepper, whirred it all together for about 10 seconds, and it was done. Let the flavors blend in the fridge for a few hours and then served in whole wheat pitas with some lettuce.  A dinner that even my confirmed carnivore husband enjoyed!

You will want to double the batch!  I made this recipie several times and it is quick and delicious.  I prefer green onion, otherwise the onion has overpowered the other flavors.  Great wrapped in lettus, pita, whole grain bread, and with a fork. Thanks for sharing, sandwiches can be a bit tricky for my vegetarian daughters, this makes packing lucnh easy!

my son loves this on a whole wheat tortilla! I pulse the chickpeas in my food chopper as my son has texture issues, I omit the dill and use black pepper and chili powder as my son likes it a bit spicy, I omit the salt as well, use green onion for white.

Made this several times, now. It's excellent, and I only have one suggestion. Beware of the quality of the garbanzo beans that you use. The lower quality beans do not mash well, and leave lots of skins floating around in your dish.

Wow! I am not a vegetarian by any means but have been trying to improve my diet - eating habits - so I started searching for easy recipes. This was my first one and I have to say that I am impressed. Delicious and nutritious. My husband practically ate it from the bowl whereas I had it on a bagel thin with lettuce and tomato.

This salad is delicious.  I prepared it for my boss who was joining my coworkers and I at a British tea room (in the Midwest) for lunch.  He cannot eat gluten and the restaurant couldn't accommodate his dietary needs, so each of us prepared something for him and we carried it in with the proprietor's permission, of course.  It was a hit with my boss.  I trimmed some Napa cabbage leaves and put some of the mixture in each, folded the sides up around the mixture, put a slice of cucumber and a slice of red bell pepper on top and secured it all with special toothpicks.  I was very happy with the results!  My husband and I had the leftovers for dinner tonight and he declared it delicious, too.  Seems very versatile as far as adding things you like and leaving out those you might not.  Very customizable recipe.

Flavor was OK, but unless you intend to spend a good amount of time mashing, the texture is a bit too coarse for my liking.  May try making this in a food processor.

So, so good! The perfect chicken salad substitute. However, if you're planning to eat this in a public place, I'd suggest going easy on the onion.

This is becoming a lunchtime staple at our house.   Love the dill in this!  I use about half the lemon juice and add a couple extra teaspoons of mayo.  Works great cooking dried chickpeas to use to make this even more economical.  I use a potato masher while the chickpeas are still warm.  I've only tried this with pitas, so far, but would be great on thinly sliced toast, too.

Yummy!  And so easy to make.  We eat it on sandwiches, or like a dip with homemade wheat pita chips.

I LOVE this. I substitute the mayo with vegenaise and eat this on my 9 grain bread with lettuce and tomatoes at least 3x a week. (I omit the onions, simply because I can't handle uncooked onions) Delicious!!!

I didn't like this at all. I should have used the beans for hummus or a hummus spread like mixture. Also 1 tablespoon mayonnaise wouldn't be enough to make this spreadable.

I found this recipe to be okay.  I think the measurements for the celery and onions are not correct if you follow the recipe strictly.  I found raw onions to be overpowering so if I make this again, I will lightly cook them before adding them to the mix.

Very good alternative for sandwiches. I subbed fat free mayo for regular. After tasting it , I then added papricka and cut up  a small sweet onion finely. Much better flavour. Overall a good recipe. Also ate in a pita pocket with lettuce.

This is absolutely delicious and takes no time to make. I'm not a fan of celery, so instead I used half a green bell pepper (chopped). I also added a dash of horseradish and some chives. Served in pita bread with lettuce and tomato, it is to die for. Soooo good and so EASY!

This recipe is amazing! My family and co-workers are always asking me to bring this to them. We like it on pita or those little whole wheat rounds, but this would also make a wonderful dip for fresh veggies!

Simply amazing. I didn't have dill or lemon juice. I added a shredded carrot and some leftover cooked and chopped broccoli stems. I adso added a hard boiled egg. This was way easy and delicious. Not to mention cheap. Awesome for a college student :)

Absolutely fantastic!  Made it without the celery because we don't like it and ate it right after making it and later after it chilled in the fridge.  It's good either way, but is definitely MUCH better chilled.  I will make this again and again!

Made as advised. Refreshing and satisfying lunch. Added avocado & sprouts, wrapped in tortilla. Very tasty, next time I'll reduce the onion & mince.

Wow, tasty!  I just made this for my lunch tomorrow and couldn't believe how good it smelled.  I took a little bite when I was done and was amazed at how tasty it was!  Now I'm really looking forward to lunch tomorrow, when the entire mixture has had a chance for the flavors to blend.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this before and I wasn't SUPER AWESOME, but still good. I didn't think much of it until I realized I hadn't added the dill. I made it again and added the dill this time, as well as some more lemon juice and mayo. I made it the night before and let the flavors soak in. It was delicious!

It was really hard to mash with a fork.  I would recommend trying a potato masher or food processor.  I served it in a pita with some low fat sour cream, tomato, cucumber and spinach.

This was interesting but a little dry for me. I doubled the mayo and it was still a little dry. I served with a squirt of dijon mustard and that kind of did the trick for me other than a little too much onion. I realize onion size varies but mine was pretty small and it was a little overpowering.  I would add more celery and "liquid" next time.

Wonderful and so easy.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used lime because that was what I had on hand.  It is very similar to a tuna salad in the way it is made, and so, whatever you generally like in tuna salad, I'm sure you could substitute in this recipe.  My fiance loves tuna salad and thought this was just as good.

I'm so disappointed with how this turned out.  It got so many great reviews, and maybe I did something wrong, but it was not good at all.

I made this receipe exactly as it called for and was very satisfied. Very yummy and actually addicting! So very easy to make, used leftovers in salad, pita, or in lettuce wraps. I am not vegetarian but this is a great go-to receipe.

Absolutely delicious! I added diced carrot and a little Parmesan. Then had it over toasted sourdough bread. It is a fantastic and simple dish.

A five-star vegetarian recipe. You can dress it up in many ways, like you could tuna salad. I like adding a little mustard. This has become one of my staple meals, and I've gotten several friends hooked on the recipe as well.

So incredibly simple to make yet so very delicious and a protein power house!  We had it yesterday for lunch  in wraps on Trader Joe's whole wheat flat bread with avocado, lettuce and tomato.  Today we had them as wraps using whole wheat tortillas for dinner.  Delicious!  For an extra kick would add a chopped jalapeno.

This is delicious! Very easy to make and keep in the fridge for easy lunches! I threw some on sandwich bread with a slice of tomato, provolone cheese, and a sprinkle of paprika. Tasty!

I loved this.  I am a vegetarian and I have been looking for a new spin on a veggie sandwich.  Next time I won't mash the chickpeas with a fork, I think I want it to be more of a spread.

This wasn't bad - not my favorite thing ever, but good for a light lunch.  I left out the celery (not a big fan), and just added dill weed a little at a time to taste, because I wasn't sure about it.  It was really good in this though, so I wouldn't leave it out unless you just have a big dill aversion!  Unfortunately I accidentally got a little heavy handed with the salt, but other than that this was nice on crackers with a slice of tomato and sliced banana peppers.  I cooked my own chickpeas and pulsed all the ingredients in my mini-chopper.

I loove this recipe! Being recently diagnosed w/ celiac disease (and I'm vegetarian), I needed some high-protein vegetarian meals and I can't get enough of this one! I use it with gluten-free crackers or bread. I usually add a little cayenne to the mix to spice things up a bit. So fast & easy to make and so good. Thank you so much for this recipe!

LOVE LOVE LOVE. I usually substitute the onion for 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp of onion powder. This is one of my favorite recipes and friends always want to know what I'm eating and where they can get the recipe. YUM.

This is a very quick and easy vegetarian sandwich filling.  I am usually a meat eater when it comes to sandwiches but this is just as tasty as eating a tuna sandwich.  I was surprised, I thought this recipe would be bland but it was actually good.

The flavors are similar to what you would find in a tuna sandwich--mayonnaise, onion, etc.  In fact, I think I would rather make this than tuna.

A tasty alternative to egg salad or chicken salad - and without the goopey consistency that comes with too much mayo!  Hooray.  I suggest red onion.  I added fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, and cucumber slices to my sandwich.  Pocket pitas would make this easier, but any pita is perfect.  I used a pastry mixer to mash the chickpeas, which works well.  I also left out the dill.

New to veganism, I prepare this as a tuna/egg/chicken salad substitute, and its awesome!  While its terrific as a sandwich filling, it is also versatile...I have had this over salad and also given it a quick rough mash to dip toasted pitas in it.  There are many different ways to alter it (it came out fine using cannellini, using a vinaigrette instead of lemon, using thyme instead of dill)...either way, its delicious!

Made this with green onions instead of onion (which I can't stand) but followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  Thought it had a nice, delicate flavor but could definitely stand another tablespoon of mayo (it's a tiny bit bland, though I'm now wondering if my dill was old), or an extra smear of mayo on the sandwich. Made it the night before (not sure if this is meant to be served right away).  Might mix it with some cottage cheese for some creaminess.

I was shocked by how good this was! The texture was great, even if smooshed up chickpeas don't sound too appetizing. Best served on toasted bread open-faced sandwich style.

This is an easy and healthy alternative to chicken salad for lunch.  I sub low fat yogurt for the mayo and add a lil dijon for that extra zing.  Try topping with tomato and cucumber as suggested in a tortilla wrap.  Very addictive!

WOW!!  I ate this on Ancient Grains bread and loved it.  Warning to meat eaters....recipes like this might convert you to vegetarian.  I am not a vegetarian but only prepare meat dishes when I have plenty of time because the leftovers are not always very good.  i live alone and many veggie recipes are excellent leftover and great for freezing.

Healthy, tasty and fast to make! Loved it on bread with dill pickle slices but I know it'll be great on crackers as well! My favorite way of preparing this is to sub dijon mustard for the lemon juice, and sub old bay seasoning for the salt - Mmmmmmm!

Awesome Awesome Awesome. Wifey didn't like the onions too much but me and the kids love it. I'll usually grab a large can of chick peas, use two thirds to make hummus and use the remained for this spread. Delicious on a toasted bagel in the morning (if not that good for your breath)

Yum! Another inexpensive, easy, and tasty recipe. I really enjoyed this, and it is a nice change as I never use dill weed. I did not use the onion in this recipe, but it was still kept crunchy with the celery. Next time I may add chopped cherry tomatoes. Very good - keeps well so you can enjoy leftovers the next day.

This is absolutely delicious.  It's the kind of recipe where you look at the ingredients, and think, what could be so special, but when combined there is something about it that makes it so tasty.  Because there aren't that many ingredients, make sure the ones you have are quality, i.e. like a great tasting onion (walla walla maybe?).

Delicious!!  And so simple to make.  I used lilme instead of lemon (personal preference) and spread a little dijon mustard on the bread. Delicious and hearty and quick.  I'd say a perfect sandwich filling or appetizer (served on small, toasted pieces of bread).  I will make this again and again and again...

Really great recipe!  Strangely enough, it turns out tasting a lot like chicken salad, so if you're looking for a good veggie alternative, look no further!  This got rave reviews from my guests at a dinner party...the only problem is that they ate too much of it as an appetizer and didn't save any room for the main course ;-)

I would use a little less onion next time.  It definately needs just a bit more mayo and dill.  All in all, a great base to work from.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I put chick peas on my salad all the time and never used them for anything else!

This was so good and very filling.  The only changes I made was to sub a chopped scallion instead of the onion and double the amount of mayo and dill.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious!  I used a potato masher to mash the chickpeas... It took a little elbow grease, but was worth the effort.  I think the food processor would have made it too much like a hummus texture.  I think next time I will microwave the beans a little to soften them up before mashing.

This is fantastic! I always promise myself that I am going to take the time to send in a review and never do. This time I had to!! This is such an awesome alternative to tuna salad. The only thing that I don't like is all the skins that come off the chickpeas when you mash them. This dish is so versatile. I did make a few substitutions because I didn't have the recipe ingredients on hand. I used red onion, dill pickles with juice (no dill) and carrots (no celery). I added dijon mustard (no lemon) and red hot sauce as someother reviewers suggested. Eating this now!! Love it, it is my new favorite sandwich filling.

This is a welcomed change of pace in the sandwich department! I used a bit more lemon, dill, and miracle whip than called for (no more than double), and added in a little red pepper flakes and asian chili sauce to give it a little zing. Tasty!

Really good when stuffed into a pita.  As written it is a bit bland for my tastes, so I took the advice of others and added some mustard and that made it perfect for me.  For such simple ingredients it really makes a great lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing recipe!  As a vegetarian, I really missed tuna salad for the past 7 years, and this comes close.  I make it with varied ingredients, and I always use more mayo than the recipe shows.  If you add Atlantic Kelp powder or some finely chopped seaweed, it adds a little fishy taste, but I like it just fine without.  never added dill, I'll have to try that.

Perfection! Thank you for this delicious recipe, I've been struggling with my veganism this winter, so with a small mayo swap out (for vegan-aise), I'm a happy girl! Dead ringer for a great tuna salad ;-)

Awesome basic recipe! You can change the flavor of this as many ways as you can with tuna.  I added grated carrots and chopped raw spinach and a little pesto instead of the dill for one variation.  (same thing I do with tuna, try it!)

Very good sandwich-so happy to find some variety with this recipe. A little dry, so I added a little dijon. Also added red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick.

This is so quick, inexpensive, easy, and even my husband said it was really good. The flavor is really great and the celery adds a summertime freshness crunch. I substituted miracle whip instead of mayo, added an extra stalk of celery for more crunch, a little extra lemon and left out the salt (for a slightly healthier option). This is REALLY tasty and I'll definitely be making this fairly often. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. Should have called it mock tuna salad cause that is what it taste similar to because of the dill, celery and onion and it is great!!  We use this all the time on vegies and pita bread.

This is a great vegetarian dish.  I noticed it could be made vegan with veganaise.  Great for whatever you have in the fridge veggie wise.  I threw in some carrots and green onion instead of celery, and used lime juice instead of lemon because it was around.  We ate it on crackers for a quick lunch.

Nice vegetarian sub for tuna or chicken salad.  Very similar to one I buy at my local Earth Fare and Whole Foods stores.  Only addition I make is to add chopped roasted almonds and some times red seedless grapes or dried cranberries; just personal preferences.

Great alternative to tuna salad.  I didn't smash up all the chickpeas since I really wanted to bite into whole ones and I also added carrots for more of a crunch.  Love this!

SO delicious and super easy to make! The only change I made was less onion. I am usually not a fan of dill, but it just complements the dish so nicely! It's hard to believe its only garbanzo beans and not chicken or tuna. Its great too, because you can use it in so many different ways (dip, sandwich,..etc.) Yum Yum YUM! Can't wait to make it again!

Love this! I've made it three times now and it's just delicious. This last time I tried substituting cilantro for the dill and that was great too! Plus, I always add hot sauce to it, as some other reviewers suggested.

This is my favorite type of recipe, one that takes humble ingredients and elevates them into something you don't expect. I love chickpeas in any form, but was still surprised at how good this is. Very similar to tuna salad, but better. I used green onion and fresh parsley. I'll be keeping this on hand for the lunch bag.

I've tried mashing and processing chickpeas before and it's a disaster, so I decided to leave them whole and eat this as a salad instead of sandwich spread.  It was marvelous!  I did add more than 1 stalk of celery and since I didn't have any dill weed, I added about 1/2 T of juice from a dill pickle jar. Also added a touch of garlic salt.  Turned out great!

Delicious!!! I used low-fat mayo and green onion rather than regular onion. I also added more dill because I love it. It's a little high in carbs (I'm diabetic), but the fiber helps make up for that. Just ate it with some crackers and it was a super-quick and tasty lunch...definitely a keeper!

I was expecting something fabulous and I didn't care for it at all. I'm not a vegetarian, so maybe that's part of why I didn't like it. My husband said it was bad too. I will not make that again.

Great basic recipe that takes customization well. I use about 1/4 cup diced green onion, add 1 tsp of garlic powder and also a dash of sesame chili oil. That really kicks it up a notch. Leave it in the fridge overnight to really blend the flavors and then this makes a great lunch spread on crackers, pita or even just by itself.

This was really good!  I think the original deserves 5 stars.  For a non-vegetarian version, I decided to add canned tuna plus a couple tablespoons each of yellow mustard and sweet relish.  I'll be making this again...and again and again!

I love this recipe with a little bit of spicy brown mustard and sweet relish added.  I've found that you can make a wonderful sandwich melt by adding cheese of your choice, spreading butter or earth balance on the outside of the bread and grilling on medium low heat (to heat through without burning the bread) until done to toasty perfection.  Yum!

Loved this - the first time I made it with Cannellini beans and it was great. Reserved some liquid from the beans but didn't need it. I added pressed garlic and I think you could thin this (with olive oil instead of mayo, maybe?) and use as a dressing on salad.

The options are endless on this one! I just used green onion and it was still pretty good. I am looking forward to trying it the actual celery and onion it calls for! A very economical meal too!

Yummy alternative for vegetarians!  I substituted carrot for the celery and green onion instead since that's what I had on hand.  I imagine celery & onion are great too.  Haven't even eaten it yet (made it for lunch tomorrow) and already know I'm in for a treat!

Absolutely wonderful!  The perfect egg salad substitute for someone who's egg intolerant.  I added some cucumber and cherry tomatoes from the garden to freshen it up a bit.  Will switch to a sweeter and milder onion next time (maybe scallions instead).  The mayo amount is just enough to bind it without making the mix heavy, and the citrus gave it good summery tones to keep the chick peas from being too cloying.  I'll be making this all summer!

This was great, but I'd definitely add some spice next time. Curry, hot sauce, whatever, it was just a little bland. Anyway, I blended the ingredients in my food processor, which made the mixture easily spreadable. Would make again but with spices.

Delicious!  Simple and easy to make, healthy and filling.  I made this for my (non-vegetarian) husband, and he thought he was eating tuna.  It wasn't until he'd already eaten 1/2 of the sandwich that I finally told him what it was.   I made it as written, but added a touch of dijon mustard (maybe 1 tsp) for more zing and a bit more mayo.  I served it on warm pita with tomato, cucumber, and lettuce.  Will definitely make it again!  Thanks!

This was AWESOME!  I'm newly vegan so I swapped the mayo for Vegenaise, added a heaping tablespoon of crushed garlic like some of the others suggested and it was fantastic.  This will totally satisfy my craving for chicken salad sandwiches, which I loved.  Thank you!

a nice alternative to tuna salad. Lighter, but still filling! I did add a little more mayo; it was a little dry with only one tablespoon. I also chopped up a tomato and added after ingredients were mixed. I will definitely make this again. Wonderful quick refreshing dish for hot weather!

This is a great basic recipe.  My husband and I both see endless possibilities with it.  I would like to add some other fresh herbs from the garden in the summer like lemon thyme or lemon verbena.  My husband thought it would be great with sprouts or lettuce and tomato.  Perhaps a chickpea L T.  Good vegetarian option that's quick and easy to make.  It will become a staple in our house.  Would be great with the whole wheat pita recipe on this site.

Well, I didn't think this tasted like tuna salad but my husband though it WAS tuna salad... I thought it had a nice flavour and would taste more like tuna salad if you added a bit of kelp powder or something like that. We had it on thin flatbread and I sprinkled some with yellow curry powder and some with cumin and they were pretty tasty. It's a great high protein alternative to animal products and much greener too... you know, if you're concerned about global warming and that sort of thing :)

This is very good and makes a quick and healthy meal.  I would experiment with the spices next time - maybe some lemon pepper - but I'll definitely be making it again.

This was a refreshing change! Only edit I made was to use a green onion. I put it in a toasted pita and was STUFFED after just one half - it's very filling!! Tuna still offers more protein and less carbs but this is perfect for a vegetarian or if you just need a change. Great idea!

I love this recipe! I just recently became a vegetarian and was really intrigued by this recipe. It's great! I may need to invest in a potato masher tho to speed up the process but this is delicious. I only added like maybe a teaspoon of onion (finely diced) bc i'm not too big on onions, added maybe two big spoonfuls of lite mayo and omitted the salt and pepper. Reading other reviews I went out and bought some pita bread for this and for the finishing touches added slices of roma tomatoes and thin slices of cucumber - fantastic! And it really DOES remind me of tuna salad. I was going to share with husband but uh kind of snacked it away. Will definitely make more tho so he can try it :)

This was kind of dry.  Next time I make it, i will add more mayo, probably at least double it.  I think it would also be a good idea to add relish, which I will also try!  I cut the onion to almost a third of what was asked for, and it still smelled so strong that I had to double package it just to feel comfortable walking down the hallway with it!  If you make it as directed, I hope you have LOTS of breath mints!

So simple, quick and delicious!! I had to have two sandwiches instead of my normal one due to the yumminess of this. This is a definite keeper and I'll be making this weekly as my family thoroughly enjoys this too. Thanks!

This was amazing! I will be keeping this in my fridge at all times for a quick healthy lunch. I omitted the onions and added a little more mayo to moisten it up a little. It was AWESOME! Even, my husband likes it and he is a 100% meat and potatoes guy.

This was a great idea for lunch today. I used my food processor for the chickpea and to me is much easier. Instead of celery I chopped some dill pickles. I think this goes better as a dip with vegetables, crackers or even chips than a sandwich filling, but is totally up to you. I didn't have any pita bread, so I served with blue corn tortilla chips. Delicious!

it didn't turn out as good as i hope, i followed the recipe, half an onion was too much, and not enough mayo. i added sundrid tomatoes and the texture was very thick i think it need to be placed in the food processor. i ended up throwing it out because the taste wasn't so good.

While this wasn't bad, I found the recipe really bland and not worth the effort (which isn't saying much, since it wasn't much effort at all.  Perhaps some of the additions mentioned in other comments would help, but I wouldn't bother.

This was pretty good before I decided to make a tzaziki (spelling?) version by adding some leftover cucumber slices and a little sour cream and yogurt. I don't know how often I would make, as it was a pain to puree it in my food processor. Also, I couldn't imagine eating ONLY this spread in a sandwich, and I'm not a fan of veggie sandwiches, so I stuck with crackers, and it wasn't very filling. More like a snack.

I'm very limited for options, being in Iraq right now- but this wasn't too bad at all!  It was a little dry, but it definitely had the tuna/chicken/potato salad feel to it.  Had it on toast- pretty good!  Garlic salt might be a nice addition.

This recipe, with a couple of changes was such a hit, I had to make a double batch the next day.  Instead of mayo, I used a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of non-fat plain yogurt.  Instead of dill I used mint.  Served on warm pita and a bit of mixed salad greens...yummy.

I thought this tasted a little bland.  I added 1/4 cup diced onion and 1 hardboiled egg white chopped and that seemed to help. This recipe appears to be very forgiving, so I may try diced carrot as well next time.  Yes, I will make this again, it is too easy and too nutritious to leave off of a vegetarian menu.

This is very good and filling. I made this for a quick dinner one day on a kaiser roll with french fries. Next time I'm going to try and spice it up with some chili powder and garam masala. Thanks for this healthful alternative!

A really good way to add protien to your sandwich...tastes really good, however, next time i think i'll add less onion just to suit my tastes. Makes a very filling sandwich. =)

I made this recipe yesterday, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I made it exactly as directed, except I used olive oil mayonnaise to reduce calories and to get a serving of Omega-3. It is even better when you let it set overnight, the flavors blend quite nicely. Since I love dill, I kept it in the recipe, and in my opinion it is what really makes this filling great. This is an excellent substitute for tuna salad, and I will be making this often.  I'm a vegetarian and this makes a great protein-rich sandwich filling.

Good recipe. A little oniony for my taste, so I'll probably add less onion next time.

I added fresh dill relish and a tsp. of Hungarian paprika, some garlic salt and a bit less onion. Tastes like a chicken salad. Soooo good with Triscuits crackers!!! Making for Super Bowl party!

I made this recipe as is and I enjoyed it, but all I really tasted was celery. I’ll try it again with a bit more lemon and dill.

I made a double batch and I should quadrupled it. It is so so good and we’re not even vegetarians. I sub’ed one tablespoon of mayo for plain Greek yogurt and it was awesome.

I made this for my daughter, she is vegetarian. I replaced the celery with chopped red pepper, added a dash of celery seed, and a good tablespoon of spicy brown mustard. She said it tasted like a sandwich from a high end restaurant. So I would say it was a hit.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I added 2 baby carrots cut very finely and 1/2 of a large cucumber again cut finely.   I will not forget this recipe!!   I have several friends who are vegetarian and I will pass this recipe to them.   I put this on gluten free crackers.  Perfect!!

Wonderful! I made it twice, just as written (well a little more mayo) and let it sit in the fridge for a day to let the flavors blend. So good especially for someone like me who is cutting down on meats of all kinds. Will try some of the suggestions next time - especially interested in the mustard idea.

Loved this as a lunch!  It was a bit more time consuming for me than I like for a lunch as I started it on the time limits posted for it.  I ended up having to mash the chickpeas with my hands as they were just too hard to mash with a fork.  But the flavours were spectacular!

This "Vegetarian Chickpea Sandwich Filling" was reasonably good and very filling. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. I think it would have tasted  much better if I had made it with a "creamier" chickpea (my chickpeas were "mealy": YVES VEGGIE CUISINE organic).  Thank you FISHLOVE for sharing your recipe.

I made today (8/26/19).  I followed exactly except I probably put in about half the onion called for.  I would give it 5 stars for being quick and easy to make; 3 stars for flavor.  Some folks who gave 1- and 2-star reviews commented on lack of flavor, dryness, and difficulty mashing the beans or spreading on bread.  I used a potato masher for the beans and had no trouble mashing them.  I also thought the amount of mayo was fine--I had no problems spreading this on bread.  I think one celery stalk is too much for one can of beans--half a stalk should be plenty.  Some folks thought the onion or dill was overpowering but I thought the flavor was a little bland.  I am not someone who likes spicy food but I thought the flavor needed a little boost--maybe some feta cheese , olives, etc.  Others mentioned that instead of making this again, they would simply make a sandwich with hummus.  I might consider that before making this again (with some modifications).

We liked this a lot, and it was so quick and easy to make, too. For my taste it lacked a little zip, so I think I’ll try to add some curry next time for more interest. My husband loved it as written. Thanks for the great healthy recipe!

The only change I made was to use a lot more mayo.  This stuff is fabulous, with or without bread.  I've passed the recipe along to others, who've added things like grated carrot, chopped, hard-cooked egg and pickle relish.  Everybody loves it, every which way.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious!  I'm not a vegetarian but wanted something light for lunch.  Made this tonight for lunch this week and it's so good.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written, will put it in pita pockets with a little lettuce, tomato and maybe some avocado. Wish I had doubled the recipe but it's so fast to make, I can whip up another batch in about 10 mins.  Quick and yummy!  Win Win!!!

Absolutely fantastic. It actually tastes better the next day after all the flavors have melded. My kids didn't even notice there was no meat in their sandwich.

This was great on a sandwich, especially with toasted bread.  What was even better was eating it as a dip with pita chips.  Super easy and very filling and satisfying!

This is a great dip or sandwich filling, very tasty and satisfying.  Adding a bit of the dill vinegar from the pickles reinforces the dill component nicely if you relish tartness.

I like this a lot! I customized it a little to my specific taste - I used light sour cream in place of the mayo and green bell pepper in place of the celery - but I think it would be great as written too. I will definitely make this again, it’s great for a quick, light summer meal.

This is surprisingly excellent for such simple ingrédients. I made it as directed but decided to add some extra dill and a little more lemon and mayo.  I noticed that many other reviewers added "more spice" as well according to their tastes.  I love it as a quick snack or appetizer.  I would also serve it to company with crudite. Very simple to make and it keeps  very well in the fridge. Great low calorie snack with veggies.

We needed a vegetarian option for a baby shower luncheon, and this was a big hit!  It is very easy to make, which was a bonus.  I did find it to be just a bit dry with just 1 TBSP of mayo and lemon juice each, so I added about 1-2 tsp extra of the mayo, and another squirt of the lemon juice.  We served it on crostini.  
We prefer to make it a day ahead and let the flavors meld. 
I have also added some chopped tomato and chopped cucumber and eaten it like a salad.  YUM!

Really really good, can see this becoming a staple. Next time I might try soaking and cooking dried beans for a softer, mushier texture and adding more mayo. Can be used/eaten so many different ways!

I don't like mayonnaise so I used flax seed oil instead (which made it vegan) and added cayenne pepper, and miso (as I didn't have any dill pepper on hand). It was very tasty!

Turned out delicious! I did not have celery, so I added celery seed. Also added finely diced red and orange peppers for color. Used a mini food chopper to combine the ingredients. Served it on Italian Herb Flatout flatbread.

Absolutely delicious! I did add some dill pickle juice to this to make it a little bit more moist. (Even my non-vegetarian husband enjoyed it). I put it on flatbread, and used a wee bit of feta cheese, some cucumber and tomato. Quick tip, use a potato masher instead of a fork, this makes the consistency perfect!

My new favorite and such a wonderful replacement for egg or chicken salad.  I made mine with Veganaise and added a touch of smoked paprika since I make my egg salad like that and it was perfection!  I ate with a few crackers.  Definitely crave-able!

A couple of pulses with an immersion blender instead of mashing the peas before adding other ingredients did the trick. I served with sliced tomato, letuce , sliced avocado on pumpernickle. Devine.

Very tasty, I veganized it by using Vegenaise instead of mayo and added a couple shakes of garlic powder and almost doubled the lemon juice. I cooled it in the fridge and then ate it on whole wheat Ritz crackers.
Thank you for the recipe!

I added diced dill pickles and Sriracha. I love pickles and there was already dill weed in it so I thought I'd enhance the dill flavor! I also love spicy things so I'm often adding Sriracha to dishes! It was delicious!
I had it on a hotdog bun the first time with lettuce and tomato...we had chicken Phillies the night before and had leftover buns so I thought why not! It was good! The next day I added some chopped hard boiled egg to it and mixed it all together. That was also good! This is so versatile, I love it! It's also extremely easy to throw together in a pinch!

h my goodness! I made this last night and fell in love. It's easy, doesn't take a tremendous amount of time and has just a few ingredients. I'm in love with it. I did make a few simple changes. Didn't feel like cutting onions so I used scallions. Also added a touch of cayenne pepper for a little kick. I might also use avocado next time for a bit more healthy kick.  Ate it right out of the bowl and having some now with a cup of tea. I saw some reviews with changes I might also make myself! Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This recipe is really easy to make. The only thing that I would change the next time that I make this is using less onion. Half an onion is a bit overwhelming.

Disclaimer on my rating: I made this with dried garbanzo beans instead of canned for much lower sodium, and also had to half the lemon juice due to what I had on hand. With those changes, it wasn’t great. Definitely edible, but pretty bland mush. On the second day, I added garlic salt (I know I know, but the low sodium wasn’t for me!) paprika, and sriracha on my serving and it tasted great. My husband said he enjoyed it in its original form; my baby didn’t touch it on first round and took some small bites on second round but didn’t ask for more. Will probably make again since it’s healthy and BLW-friendly, but not regularly.

This has been a great recipe to use for lunches since I’ve switched to a plant based diet.  Swapped the mayo with vegan mayo and the onions for carrots since I don’t like to have onions at work.  My preference is to have it in a whole wheat pita with a little bit of mustard.  Quick and easy to whip up on a Sunday and have for lunches all week.  Thanks for sharing!

Can these calories be right?  An entire can of beans has 420 calories and a tablespoon of mayo has 57.  The celery, onion, lemon juice and dill cannot add another 300 to make 259 calories in each of 3 servings.  

I'd like give this a 5 because I liked the flavor, but the way the recipe is written leaves room for error.  One half of a giant, white onion or one half of a small, yellow onion?   A big outside stalk makes twice the volume of a smaller inside stalk.  

I used 1/2 cup of red onion and 1/4 cup of chopped celery and liked the result.  The red onion added a nice color. I also let it sit overnight because I was prepping lunches ahead and felt it tasted better the next day.

In my quest for meatless Mondays, I decided to try this as I love chick peas! I must say it was pretty good. Even my chickpea hating hubby said not bad!

Very versatile ingredient wise. I used up some Greek yogurt in place of the mayo. Dill, lemon, lemon pepper, celery, onion and I used up the last of a red pepper which  added crunch and color. A bit of Harissa for heat. I bet tahini would be good too.

I did not add any onion. I am not a huge fan. I did add more lemon juice. The recommendation that I read about letting it sit overnight was the greatest idea! My husband and friend's loved this.

Instead of the onion, I used a green onion and also added some chopped green pepper and cucumbers - about 1/3 cup each. This is delicious! My teen daughter likes it with avocado slices on crackers.

I really enjoyed this!  I did not have celery so I used chopped green pepper, which gave it the crunch celery would have.  I also cooked my own garbanzo beans.   Be sure to use dill, it takes it over the top in goodness.    Simply delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  I used scallion instead of onion since I find raw onion too strong.  I also used a potato masher instead of a fork and it worked a lot better.

I added more mayo and lemon juice to taste.  I love this and it has become a regular lunch item for me.  I haven't done much of this yet but I am confident that this could be adapted to almost any chicken salad recipe (curried, with grapes, etc.) or use .  Very easy!  Thanks for such a great idea!

I think some more spices would help. I was actually a little unnerved by how much it reminded me of a tuna sandwich, despite not having any fish in it! I'll probably make it again but it's not going to be one of my go-to meals.

Pretty good! I subbed two spring onions instead of a regular onion because the celery was already very crunchy.  I feel like my dill wasn't strong enough though, even though I added extra. If I can find some I'll try with fresh dill instead of dried.

I enjoyed this sandwich filling, it had an even texture and mellow flavour that mixed nicely with the seasonings.  It worked nicely in bread and buns but when I wrapped it in lettuce, it was even better.
The next time I make this, I'm going to mash the chickpeas more, they were falling out as I ate.

Too much onion in my opinion. I will definitely make this again with about half the amount. I added pickles. It tastes so much like tuna salad. It was also better the following day.

This stuff is great, I make it a lot, but 1/2 onion is way too much.  Use maybe 2 tbs onion.

This was pretty good. Perhaps I may try seasoning it a bit more next time. But definitely a nice vegetarian alternative to tuna or chicken salad.

Soooo delicious! Only addition were a couple cloves of garlic. Layered it on a large tortilla wrap with alfalfa sprouts. Even my 10 & 12 yr olds loved it!  So healthy too!

Delicious. I halved the batch and added additional lemon juice, granulated garlic, scallions, pickle relish and hot Hungarian paprika to the one half. Loved it both ways but hubby preferred the kicked up batch.

I loved this!  I ended up adding 2 T of mayo and reducing the onion by about half.  It had great flavor and texture.  I might up the dill next time to get  a little more dill flavoring!  So good!  Olives may be good in there too!

Will make again!

Really good and easy recipe, reminds me of a vegetarian tuna/chicken salad! I doctored mine up a bit to give it some more flavor by adding balsamic vinaigrette dressing, basil, rosemary, and a little bit of garlic. I’m not a huge fan of celery so I added spinach in order to give it a more interesting texture.

I made exactly as per recipe.  It was good, but I added about a half teaspoon of garlic powder and a drizzle of herb infused olive oil - about a teaspoon.  That made it five star for me.  I will also make in the future and try adding other items such as peppers and/or jalepeno.

I loved this filling.  I used my blender to pulse the chickpeas.  I also added a few slices of red pepper and an extra teaspoon of mayo.  This is my new go to instead of tuna and egg salad.

I'm not vegetarian but I LOVE this sandwich filling. It's also great on crackers or stuffed in a tomato for dinner. It's so versatile you can add any ingredients you like! I've made it twice in two weeks.

I followed the recipe exactly and I wasn't super impressed. Maybe I'm just a fan of a more "saucier" version of this. I could have used way more mayo, but I wanted to keep it on the healthy side. Maybe I will try it again and make a few adjustments next time.

Great taste and easy to change ratios of ingredients without compromising the flavor.  I pressure cooked dried chickpeas since I didn't have a can an used a cup of cooked chickpeas then used an entire small onion, added mayonnaise with basil and dill seed (since I didn't have dill weed.)  I didn't measure the celery that I had chopped and frozen and used have a lime.  I tossed everything in a food processor instead of mashing and chopping separately. It made 2 great sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe.

Enjoyed making this! I did so after reading a couple reviews. I'm a lazy cook sometimes so I used garlic and onion powder as well as celery seed. A user suggested Dijon mustard so I used that and added siracha. Very tasty! Will definitely make again!

So yummy!  Deserves 6 stars. We will be making this regularly.  We used fresh parsley instead of dried dill and sweet red peppers instead of celery.  Like hummus but creamier because of the mayo.  Mmmmm great on crackers and healthy too.

A perfect refreshing summer dish. We ate it with corn chips,  like a dip, and made wraps the second time. Very versatile! We'll have to try it as a sandwich next time.

I loved this recipe!  I have made it 3 times and like it on toasted rye the best, but also like all by its self as a salad.  It's a great recipe  that requires very little effort for a very filling meal or a snack.

YUM! I very slightly changed this recipe - i used 2 stalks of celery instead of one, and i used a red onion instead of yellow for more flavor. So yummy!! And you can add so many different spices to this to change it up as you please. I served this on slices of rye bread. Definitely a hit!

I'm so happy I found this because I'm not a huge fan of chickpeas unless its puréed. Anyways, I made this with one avocado with a little mayo and used 1/4 of a large red onion and it was still too much onion, so I couldn't imagine using 1/2 an onion. I used a potato masher to mash it all together and still had some chunks of chickpeas which I didn't mind too muc.

Excellent! I used the recipe for vegan mayonnaise from "Simple Vegan Blog" which is super easy and delicious.  This tastes so good and would be very easy to modify to different flavors if desired.  I cooked a cup of dried soaked garbanzo beans instead of using the canned, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  This will be a staple in my house, it was definitely that good.  I think it might also fry up into "burgers" really nicely.  I'm going to give it a try. Thank you!

I recently started eating a plant based diet and was so happy to see this recipe. I read from the comments that it was a little dry so I added a little vegetable broth. I also added chopped jalapeno peppers ( I love the flavor ). It lasted 4 days and I are it topped on a half avocado, spread on a tortilla with cooked portobello mushrooms, In a sandwich with tomato, avocado and romaine lettuce. There are so many possibilities to this basic recipe and I'm looking forward to experimenting.

I found it to be a little dry so I added more mayo and also some dijon mustard to substitute the lemon.  Also added some garlic powder and it tastes great after it's been in the fridge for a little bit.

This is pretty much the only sandwich I'll make for outdoor  activities. I do a lot of hiking and skiing and I find this sandwich so tasty and filling. It's a great vegetarian option when you're doing high energy activities.

3.5 stars. I think it's a good base but needs additional flavoring. Next time I would maybe add some garlic powder.

Good! I left out the onion and didn't mix in the mayo -- just put mayo on the bread. Honestly, this would have been good just eating the chickpeas by themselves; I did not realize they were so tasty! I would never have  thought of putting them on a sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!

Im not usually a fan of chickpeas, but I made this for my family and we couldn't get enough! I served it in a pita with fresh spinach and chopped tomatoes. The flavor and texture remind me of tuna salad (something I really miss since going vegetarian). We ate the entire batch in one sitting, and loved it so much that I made a double batch again a few days later. The only thing that I have to say negatively is that it doesn't keep well for leftovers, so eat it all in one sitting! Yum!

Yum!  Enjoyed mine on Dave's Killer Bread with sliced cucumbers, tomato and romaine.  But I'll get pita next time as many other reviewers recommended.  I don't care for celery, so I substituted chopped water chestnuts.  Cut back on onions (personal pref); dill is essential ingredient.  Potato masher worked well on the garbanzos.  Thank you, Fishlove!

Will definitely make it again! I added 2-3 chopped up dill pickles  and used 2 stalks of celery instead of 1. Served on soft chewy sandwich bread with additional mayo, yellow mustard, sliced cucumbers and tomatoes with salt & pepper on top. Died and went to heaven! Hubby said its one of the best sandwiches I've ever made. I'll take the credit!

I've made this several times now and it's quite good.  It's a very hearty, flavorful sandwich spread.  For my taste, 1/2 onion overpowered all the other good flavors so I use a quarter of one.  When I'm in a healthy mood, instead of mayonnaise I substitute plain Greek yogurt with a splash of olive oil (to keep it from separating when refrigerated.  Overall, a very good recipe for a nice change of pace in sandwich spreads.  Thanks!

I cooked the onions and used Greek yogurt for the Mayo . I omitted the dill, celery, and lemon juice and add garlic salt. I will try again later following the instructions more.

This is going to be one a staple at my house. My husband and I loved it! We put it on crusty bread and it was so yummy. I did 2 stalks of celery, 1/4 of a red onion and 2 tbsp mayo. Even if you don't like dill (my husband doesn't) it just adds a fresh taste and isnt noticeable.  So simple and tasty.

Delicious! Used fresh dill was the only change I made. Next time I might add a tablespoon of hummus to help as a binder as it was pretty crumbly. Would be a perfect pita filler or a wrap.

This meets all my criteria for a great meal - fast, easy, healthy, and delicious.   I added feta, which made gave it a perfect Mediterranean touch. Also, try mashing the peas with a potato masher; it's much faster. We had this on a pocket-less pita and it was a winner.

Awesome! I made as indicated, except used extra dill, and a few cloves of garlic. It was amazing! Next time I would probably put in a boiled egg.

I was hesitant about making this, because it looked sort of bland. But there were so many good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  Good call.

So my tweaks: I didn't have a 19.5 oz can of chickpeas, and I would rather have leftovers than not enough. So I used two 15.5 cans, which results in one and a half recipes worth of chickpeas. My measurements are for that amount.

I used a potato masher to mash the chickpeas, and left it "chunky."  I finely chopped about 3/4s of a large sweet onion and one celery stick. I used 4 T of mayonnaise, and the juice from one lemon.  I tried 1 and a 1/2 tsp of dill, and I could barely taste it, yet the flavor told me it was worth adding more, so I added another tsp. The dill really makes the mix, and I say that as someone who doesn't really like dill. I also sprinkled about 2 tsp sumac on it. I also threw in about 2 Tblsp of capers. Then I put it in the fridge, as someone suggested, to let the flavors marry. When I took it out the next day, I re-seasoned it with another half tsp dill, and another half tsp of sumac. It is so good. 

I served it on toasted sub rolls, lined with spinach (the green I had on hand) and chopped tomato, then the filling, and a generous pinch of chopped flat parsley. You can really play around with the ingredients. This is going into our rotation.

It was dry, but the flavor was good. I always sub green pepper for celery. I spread red pepper hummus on the bread and that helped some, but next time I will do a generous tablespoon of mayo (light!), maybe 1/2 tbs more.

this was a staple recipe when i was a student, and even now i make this now and then. not a fan of dill but pretty good with pretty much any crunchy veggie (carrots, radishes, cucumber, apples, etc), and any vinegar (cider vinegar, rice vinegar, balsamic, etc). Very flexible with herbs too (italian spices, cumin/turmeric/nutmeg, chili powder and hot pepper flakes, touch of sambal hot sauce, etc)

This is a decent vegetarian and healthy alternative if you have a craving for chicken salad.  Dill isn't my favorite, but I decided to make the recipe as written to give it a shot.  I love the chickpeas, celery, and mayo together - but something was off with the balance of the lemon juice, dill, and onion (the onion was too biting/powerful, and I think the lemon juice brought out the dill flavor more than is ideal).  Next time I will probably omit the lemon juice and onion, reduce the dill by half, add an extra dollop of mayo, and more salt+pepper.  Might be interesting to try some different seasonings too (someone mentioned a dash of curry powder which sounds wonderful).  I ate it in a wrap, but it's probably best on soft wheat bread.

YUM! So good following the top review and eating it on warm pita bread with plain yogurt, tomato, and cucumber. Will use a bit less onion next time.

Love this recipe! We eat it as a dip with Garlic Tuscan Crostini and cucumber slices. It's the perfect snack or main dish, depending on how much you serve. We use a little over half the amount the amount of dill as the recipe recommends and add cherry tomatoes. Delicious!

I tried this recipe for the first time with some modifications. First I used a food processor to mash the chickpeas for a better consistency. I used the following spices, dried mustard, turmeric, pink salt, fresh cracked pepper, cumin, garlic powder to add more flavour. I used Veganaiise vegan mayo. It was fantastic and will make this as a lunch staple! Great recipe.

While I was mashing the chickpeas, I swear I could already smell tuna! Maybe it was psychosomatic. I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of adding a bit more mayo and omitting the celery, only because I didn't have any on hand. I tried one spoonful, and it is absolutely delicious! I am now letting it sit for five or six hours so all the flavors can meld and will have a tasty "tuna" sandwich for dinner. Yummmm.

This was really good. The reason I gave it four stars was because the recipe instructed to mash the chickpeas with a fork. Ah...hello...chckpeas are kinda hard to mash with a fork. I think a better way would be to do that job in a food processor. I think the consistancy would have been better.  I will make it again, only with the food processor. Also, it says it's only 3 servings. They are making some extreamly fat sandwiches. It really makes a lot. Bottom line, it was very tasty, but the fork mashing method is the pits.

Really good.  I omitted the onion (personal preference), doubled the lemon juice, used 1/2 tbsp. of mayo and added a tablespoon of roasted red pepper hummus.  I then spread it on a high fiber tortilla with another tablespoon of hummus.  Used my food processor to prepare the whole dish.  Delish!

Made it exactly according to the recipe, it is very delicious with the heirloom celery I purchased at the farmer's market (their stalks are more slim but much more fragrant)! My son said it is better than tuna salad and ask to take it for his school lunch tomorrow. Looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow myself! Thank you for the great recipe!

I just took this to a pot luck and most people liked it.  Several asked if it was tuna salad!  I used lime juice because I had no lemons.  

It's a nice, hearty, substantial filling.  I made some cucumber cups and stuffed them.  Delicious.  And a lovely presentation.
  
Cucumber cups:  english cukes cut into about 1 inch long rounds.  scoop out the seeds with a melon baller, leaving bottom and sides intact.  Fill.  If you do this, make sure to dice the veggies nice and small.

It was really good but it was tough to mash the chickpeas as they were. Recommend boiling them first to make them easier to mash. I also added more seasoning.

This was a good "base" for a sandwich spread.  I didn't have celery, so used cucumber to get the crunch.  Needs garlic and herbs to add great flavor.  Would make again as is healthy and can be made as flavorful as you like.

This is such a great recipe. I've made it every week for my lunches for a while now (It's about 4 servings). I've been tweaking it a bit each week. Sometimes I'll throw in some broccoli or green onion. This past week I added some greek yogurt in to make it a little creamier. They've all turned out delicious! I typically eat it with a tomato slice on a whole wheat bagel thin.

I really like this recipe and (to my surprise) so did my significant other and his father. Neither one like hummus and that is the only thing either one of them ever had with chickpeas. I did omit the celery due to personal preference and doubled the amount of mayonnaise because it looked a tad dry. I think next time, however, I will only use a quarter of the onion because it was a bit overpowering, but overall I really like the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Made it last night!  My girlfriend brought it at her job and served it on tortillas, with tomatoes and lettuce.  Everyone was flabberghasted!  Never saw it back.   

Use a wireframe potato masher to mix it up.
Added a dill pickle in small dice to the mix!

Wonderfull and very simple to do !

Absolutely wonderful. I used vegan mayo and added an extra tablespoon of it. I also added a few dashes of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. My new go to sandwich spread!

I'm not looking for recipes to replace meat, but for some reason I enjoyed how this one reminded me of a tuna salad! SO yummy. And so easily modified to add or replaces anything, I added some dijon mustard.

I made this for my nephew and his wife for lunch today and to be honest it was rather bland ...I followed the recipe as is but if you are making it for the first time you might want to add a little hot sauce to spice it up a little.

I made this exactly as written but it needed a little something. I added some cayenne pepper and some spicy brown mustard and it's perfect. Kinda similar to tuna salad, but with chickpeas. Nice and light - perfect for lunch or a light dinner.

I love this recipe its one of my favorites. One helpful hint,  I use a potato masher to mash up the beans as opposed to a fork which takes longer and is much more work.

I'm not a vegetarian by any stretch and decided to try this because I wanted an easy, healthful lunch option that I could make in advance and get a couple of meals out of. I was very pleased with the recipe. I mashed the chickpeas, spices, mayo and lemon juice in a food processor (careful to keep it on the chunky side) and then added the hand-chopped onion (I used green) and celery and mixed by hand. I ate it in a toasted pita pocket with romaine lettuce. Any vegetable addition would be good. Red pepper strips, bean sprouts, tomato. This one is a keeper and a nice option instead of the same old canned soup.

This concept is fantastic as a sandwich filling - tasty, satisfying and healthy.   Ninja chopped the garbanzos, the celery,  a shallot, a green onion, & an apple. Dressed with salt, apple cider vinegar, and mayo.  Served with warm pita.   My new go to!  Thank you for this recipe :)

It's a great alternative to tuna salad. 
One of my favourite spreads.
I know this will sound odd but a pinch of curry powder will set this off.

This spread is pretty amazing. I do think its best to allow to sit in the frig for a while before serving because it helps the chickpeas absorb the flavor and soften.

I'm dabbling with eating more vegetarian dishes. This is a very good alternative to chicken salad. The key is to let the ingredients meld together In the fridge. The longer, the better!  I've made this without the dill and substituted cilantro, parsley whatever. The options are endless. I've also added horseradish for some zing!  Great recipe.

I thoroughly enjoyed this filling, though I greatly reduced the amount of onion added. I put it on a homemade toasted bun with nothing else. It had tang, crunch, and no guilt. Perfect snack. It would also be great on pita crackers for a party appetizer.

Really good stuff! Very quick to make, too.
I usually use plain yogurt instead of mayo though (or at least instead of half the mayo).

Great filling, and so simple! My son said his favorite part of the sandwich was the filling. 
I omitted the onion, increasing the mayonnaise and lemon juice for moisture.

Delicious! My family and friends could not tell the difference between this and chicken.  I put the chickpeas in my mini prep machine and it purees them perfectly.  So simple to make. This is the first item to go when I set it out with veges, breads, crackers, etc. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is the most amazing substitution for tuna fish salad.  My nine year old daughter loves it in sandwiches for school. It keeps well in fridge, and unlike tuna, doesn't stink up the place! The lemon and dill brighten it up. This is my new all time favorite hack!

Very good as written, although I did not have celery.  The next time I made it, I added an extra tablespoon light mayo and 1 tablespoon light sour cream.  Great on broiled wheat bread and on regular or light Wheat Thins.

Soooo tasty. Received many compliments! I added mushrooms, sautéd them with the onion and celery. And crumbled smoked gouda in the mix. It was also necessary to slightly smash the beans so the mixture stayed on the sandwich, do this especially if your not using pita bead pockets.

Simple but delicious! The first time I made this, I had it straight away and couldn't stand it. Offered it to hubs, who wanted to eat it with crackers... some combination of eating it with wheat thins and letting it sit in the fridge for a day or two made it absolutely delicious. Can't get enough (and this is coming from someone who doesn't normally eat hummus...)! I make it with lite Caesar dressing (all I had on hand at the time) and spinach instead of celery.

Great recipe. Made this for lunch several times. Just Mayo is a vegan option for mayonnaise. Also, you can add dried cranberries. Goes great on a roll with baby Arugula.

Delicious!  My husband was asking if there was tuna in it haha.  Nope!  But I did add a chopped pickle, a shot of pickle juice, and an extra Tbs or two of mayo because I found the recipe as-is a tad dry.  Oh, and I crushed a clove of garlic in.  Will only use half a clove next time.  Wrapped it in lettuce.  I'm in love with this recipe!

Used a bit more salad dressing, served as a salad- not sandwich-on small lettuce wedges with crackers & pretzel twists. YUM

GREAT MEAT SUBSTITUTE

I made this recipe tonight, but instead of half an Onion I used dried onion flakes and Bell Pepper and a Carrot instead of the Celery.  I also used more mayo.  It sure tasted and smelled like Tuna Fish.  I am so happy with the recipe thank you.  I also think this recipe can be used as a base with other ingredients for a different flavor.  As a vegetarian I welcome recipes using something besides Tofu :D  I put my spread on half of a gluten free english muffin, it was Devine :D

I really liked this!  Being pretty South Beach diet friendly and using what I had on hand, I subbed Greek yogurt for mayo, omitted lemon juice (cuz I just didn't have any thawed), and added lots of cumin and garlic salt.  Had it on a bed of romaine with a side of tomato soup! MMMM!

I used a can a chickpeas. I pulsed them in the food processor first. I used mustard instead of lemon juice. I had to add double of each mustard and mayo. No dill. I used less celery and red onion, about 1/4th. It tasted wonderful tonight but I bet it'll be better tomorrow!

This spread is really good. Very versatile too. I used green onions instead and it turned out great. I could definitely see changing this up. Could use something besides mayo to make it even healthier.

Changes I made: used green onions instead of regular onions, added more mayo and lemon juice and chopped everything in a food processor. I knew I was going to like it so I tripled the recipe. Will definitely be making it again :D

This is a good recipe for vegans, I leave out the mayo and add more lemon along with the zest and a dash of curry. To make the canned chick peas easier to crush, freeze them. When thawed they smash much easier.

So so good!! I made it with red onions cuz the recipe didn't state a choice. Don't care for dill, so I omitted it. Ate it all right out of the bowl, so I have no idea how much better it would be on a sandwich! :)

What an awesome and healthier alternative to tuna salad or chicken salad. I added garlic and used green peppers instead of celery. Threw in a little bit of shiracha and used low fat mayo. YUM! Gets better as it sits in the fridge. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Very good, very easy, very flexible.  I cut back on the onion as the taste was overpowering the dill.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe and my teenagers like it, too.

This was pretty good, I think next time I'll switch it up a bit and omit the dill weed and season with curry and serve slightly warmed in the pita..

GREAT RECIPE! It is nice to have a sandwich spread that doesn't have either eggs, or meat in it! I stuck to the recipe exactly, except I added about an extra 1/2 tbsp of mayo- It seemed a little dry to me. Toasted artisan rosemary bread piled the mix on top and finished it off with slices of tomato! Will definitely be continuing to make this!

I always adjust recipes to my taste.  Less onion, not quite as much dill, etc. This is yummy!

This is excellent. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow. Quick, easy, healthy, and versatile. Very nice! I added extra mayo because I found it a bit dry. I added nutritional yeast and some garlic because they do well with pretty much anything.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Quick, cool, fresh, and easy. Make sure you drain the chickpeas well or the spread will be a little watery.

Excellent.  Was a big hit with the family.  Used some Trader Joes Everyday Seasoning and no dill since my husband does not like dill.

This is amazing. I'm not a veggie eater at all but this I could eat all day long. 
All I changed was I slightly chopped up the celery and onion with a knife, and threw them in a food processor with the garbanzo beans and mayo. Mixed it up nicely, added my spices (added garlic too) and done! So easy, and so good. The boyfriend says maybe a quarter of an onion, but I love it as is! YUM!

I just made this, and its delicious!  I added extra lemon and dill, and them ate it on gluten-free pita topped with sliced cherry tomatoes and extra pepper :)  YUM!  This will definitely be a lunch time staple in my house.

I just saw this and happened to have the ingredients on hand.  It was so easy I made it for dinner.  It really is yummy and a great alternative to egg salad (I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian)or chicken salad!  I took Linda McClean's advice and put the beans in my food processor, then put the celery and onions in the blender.  It was easy and a quick clean-up after.

Thank you, fishlove!  What a great alternative to meat.  I added a bit of plain greek yogurt for a little more creaminess.  The kids prefer to add cheese and lettuce and make it a wrap. You've got to  love it when it's easy, tasty and guiltless too!

I loved this and so did my kids. I cut the lemon juice in half and added   fewer onions which is my personal taste.   I used fresh dill  and added chopped dill pickles to mine. I also added a little Dijon mustard . This will be cooked often in my house.

This is fantastic, so easy, healthy & very filling. I do not eat mayonnaise but use veganaise instead & did not have to add the lemon juice because it is an already added ingredient. I could eat this every day :)

This is great stuff. Almost life-changing great. I'm not a huge fan of dill, so I tossed in a bunch of chopped parsley. Pulsed everything a few times in the food processor, and now I'm practically a vegetarian! I'll eat this over chicken salad any day!

I love chickpeas and Hummmus, so I was curious about this recipe...and I love it, too! I wanted a bit of a chunky texture, so I mashed the chickpeas with a fork, leaving some whole. I used the celery, lemon juice, and mayonnaise, but subbed green onion as I don't like raw onion. This was soooo tasty and I couldn't stop "testing" it before putting it in the fridge to chill :P Never thought to use chickpeas this way, and a can of chickpeas is so much cheaper than a can of tuna - and you get more for what you pay for! Thanks for the amazing recipe! Can't wait for lunch now :D

Very easy to put together and tweak to your tastes. My family preferred a little less onion and I only used half the dill, and added some seasoning salt. Turned out great!

The chickpea flavor was too overwhelming.  But I'm not a vegetarian so maybe I was wanting it to still taste like chicken salad.  But still glad I tried it, thanks.

I absolutely adore chickpeas, but I can honestly say this is not the recipe for me.  The combination of the flavors just didn't work for me.  The lemon overpowered the dill and the whole dish was just kinda sour.  I tried to eat a sandwich anyway but it's a no go.

Nice recipe that I'll be making in the future. It's nice that the ingredients are something that you can keep on hand. With two school aged boys, it's nice to have something different for their lunches. I did throw in a dusting of cumin and garlic salt to perk it up. This seems like a recipe that is easily adapted to add any of your favorite ingredients. I served it in a toasted pita with a variety of lettuces, sliced tomatoes and cilantro, with a serving of fresh strawberries on the side. Very satisfying.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! It is a really good substitute for someone looking for a chicken salad sandwich or tuna fish sandwich. Not only that, but it is super easy to make. Love it! Thanks!!!!!

Great idea for a vegetarian sandwich!  I added a tad more flavoring (even some cayenne) because I didn't have dill, and it worked out fine!

My husband and I follow Dr. Fuhrman's Eat to Live diet and this recipe was FANTASTIC.  My only change was to use Veganaise instead of mayo, otherwise, I did exactly as written. Did not tell my husband what it was and he thought it had a tuna/chicken salad taste.  Oh, I used a potato masher instead of a fork and they mashed down to a nice consistency.  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks!

This was pretty good, but next time I would add some additional seasonings.  I think curry powder would give it a nice lift.

Chick peas or garbanzo beans are a favorite and this sandwich spread is, too!!  Mashing the beans with a fork combined with the celery gives the spread texture and crunch.  I left out the onions, just personal preference. Used whole grain bread. Yummy!!  A keeper to repeat and have as an alternate to other vegetarian lunch options.

I loved it and I love the texture. The only thing it doesn't specify is the size of the onion. I had half a large red onion and it was too much, and I love onions! I will use less next time. I pulsed the veggies in my food processor, then added the mayo, lemon juice and dill and pulsed a few more times. Then I added the chickpeas and pulsed just enough to give them the mashed consistency. Very easy.

I love this recipe!  I did not have celery so I used about a teaspoon of celery seed (if that much) to get that celery flavor.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (minus a little bit of onion).  I enjoyed this as a sandwich with some tomato.  Next time I think I will double the recipe.  Just wasn't enough!  Delicious!

A very good recipe that I've made it several times now. I have to add significantly more mayo than the recipe calls for, though. I mix everything together in the blender so it's just slightly thicker than hummus and then add the veggies. My (picky!) kids really enjoy it!

This is a great base and I would highly recommend it. Try as instructed then season to taste. I added a sprinkle of cayenne, garlic powder and cumin powder to spice it up and it was amazing.

I used vegan mayonnaise and added chopped dill pickle because I didn't have an onion. I left most of the chickpeas whole and ate it like a side salad with some really high fiber bread. Tastes awesome. If I remembered to mash the chickpeas first, this would make a great to go sandwich.

This is my new go-to lunch recipe!! I added some garlic powder as per some reviewer's suggestions and definitely didn't use 1/2 an onion, maybe 1/2 cup chopped. With these alterations this recipe is to die for! So good on pita bread with cucumber and a yogurt sauce.

Super easy and very good.  I also added one clove of garlic pressed through a garlic press. No celery, so subbed finely diced green pepper.  Wasn't sure I would like the dill with chickpeas, but it's very nice.  We're having this tonight with sliced tomatoes, greek olives and sliced hard-boiled eggs on flat bread. My chickpeas were easy to mash with a potato masher.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I first discovered this recipe a year ago when we decided to start eating more vegetarian food.  I have made this for our lunches once a week ever since, and whenever I am asked to bring a cold appetizer somewhere, this is what I bring lathered on a crostini.  It always gets rave reviews.

Very easy, very tasty! Cheap too! Only thing I would suggest is to watch the onion amount.. adding too much can ruin it. I use a quarter of a medium/large onion. I used half for one batch, and it was too much and most of it sat in the fridge untouched. Putting chick peas in the food processor makes quick work of them. I usually make this the night before so all the flavors can meld nicely :) Try on it on a sandwich with cucumber slices and ripe avocado, spread on one side- SO yummy! Not bad with tortilla chips either.

I'm a vegetarian who hasn't always been a vegetarian.  I miss chicken salad sandwiches and this is going to make a fabulous replacement.  I added a hard boiled egg because I couldn't resist and seasoned with garlic salt.  I added the lemon juice a teaspoon at a time because one tablespoon seemed like a lot.  I ended up using two teaspoons.  I used a lot more mayo than called for.  I think this can easily be altered to suit your mood.

Delicious. I used green onion and fresh dill because I had both on hand. I also finely chopped some dill pickles to add in- I love the bite that those give. I made it and served it last night on sandwiches for dinner, but it's actually better today after sitting overnight! Just ate the leftovers on some crackers for lunch. Easy, delicious vegetarian option.

This was awesome!  I have to disagree with another comment that said it's like eating hummus.  It's much more textured with chunks of garbanzo beans.  Love it!

Pleasantly surprised. This was delicious! I only used about half of the dill and added and extra 1/2 tbsp. of mayo. Served it on toasted whole wheat bread with sliced cheddar cheese, lettuce and mustard. I will be making this again. My 2 year old kept asking for more bites.

Delicious!  This recipe makes a delicious alternative to tuna.  Couldn't even tell the difference.  I added garlic and cut the amount of onions in half.  This will definitely become a staple!

This is sooo good!  I used green onions and added a little extra dill because I love dill!  Instead of a wrap I used boston lettuce as a light lunch.  This is my new go to for a quick lunch idea.  A great alternative to canned tuna!  Love it.

Quite tasty!  I used raw chick peas that I soaked for 24 hours and then boiled instead of a can of garbanzo beans only because I was preparing to make homemade hummus also.

I've tried several chickpea "salad sandwiches" over the years, and this one is definitely the best I've had. I used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice because I was out of lemons, and it added a nice fruity tang. Thanks!

I finally tried the recipe I see so many people talk about.  I liked it, but didn’t love it, although I hoping to learn to love it.  I did omit the dill weed as I am not a fan of dill.  I had it for lunches served on a club style cracker and a spinach leave.  I told my guys it was like tuna salad, only minus the tuna.  
They looked at me like I was nuts, and then replied “then it is NOT tuna salad”.  Neither one of them were fans of this.  I will make this again for me, as it is a healthy lunch option and will be easy to pack for my lunches once school starts back up again.  I think next time I will add a hardboiled egg.

this is a unique spin on sandwich filling. A wonderful, healthy alternative. It does need a little more pizzazz however. We added craisins which really helped jazz it up.

I see this recipe a lot on 'The Buzz' so I decided to give it a try.  Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and didn't change a thing. I just threw all the ingredients into the food processor until it reached the consistency I liked.  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow....

This was really easy to prepare and good. I didn't have an onion, so I left that out, but added another stalk of celery. I think 1 tsp of dill weed was a bit much. Next time, I will use less of that and maybe try to add something from others suggestions- salsa or sour cream. Will be great for lunches during the week!

I tried this recipe as written first. As others have said, letting it sit in the fridge overnight really helps to blend the flavors. Looking thru the photos, I saw that someone served it as a lettuce wrap, so we tried that. Nice!

Second time, I used green onions instead. A half a white onion was way too strong and oniony for us. I also added coarsely chopped water chestnuts to give it a nice crunch and texture without changing the flavor. I cut back on celery a little and increased the dill a bit (personal preferences). We used iceberg lettuce leafs to make wraps again. This time in a side bowl, I also mixed good ranch salad dip with a favorite sweet chili sauce, then drizzled some of it on top of the filling before sealing up the lettuce wrap. Very tasty little appetizers! My picky kids really enjoyed them too.

Cut out the sodium.  I substitute canned beans for bagged beans.  I soak overnight then boil for 10 minutes and I reduce the sodium found in canned garbanzo beans.  I also experiment with differnet spices, cumin, curry and/or fresh tumeric root grated into salad.  Wonderful recipe that you can add or subtract ingredients for your particular taste.  I make atleast one batch a week.

I am so addicted to this stuff. I eat it several times a week. Other people say that it is kinda weird, and my husband (who is the pickiest eater I have ever met) says that it is good, but I am so in love with the flavors. I ADORE chickpeas and with this recipe it is just perfect. Then it is so easy! I put mine in the food processor for a bit and it is pasty chickpea goodness. I can't give too much praise to this recipe. But not everyone likes it. :)

My husband doesn't like beans or hummus, or really anything super-healthy, but I made him try this and he (as well as I!) LOVED this!  I added 1 clove of minced garlic just bc I like garlic, and omitted the dill bc I didn't have any.  We ate it on pita chips as a dip.  FANTASTIC!  Hubs has requested it again!!!

This recipe is good! It's fast and easy and you could modify it to your taste. I will not add lemon juice next time I make it and I prefer green onion. Fresh dill would be yummy. It's a good recipe and will make again. Served on a pita with spinach and tomato.

I just made this and it was delicious!!  I added about 3 tablespoons of mayo instead of just one.  I toasted whole grain bread and spread this on.  Will definitely be making this often!

Thank you for posting this recipe!  I used a potato masher instead of a fork to mash the chickpeas and about a tbsp and a half of goddess dressing instead of mayo, but aside from that I made it exactly as written and served it on wheat pita with chopped tomatoes, cucumber and pickles and it was fabulous!  Even my non-vegetarian husband said he would happily eat it again, the highest compliment he gives my cooking.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This is AMAZING. Was very easy to make and tastes delicious. My new favorite sandwich filling, going to be eating this by the pounds! It does taste better after it's been chilled though, as I ate some directly after making it and then the next day. The chilled one tasted much better. I skipped the Salt and Pepper, and the Dill Weed. Tasted fine!

Fantastic! I was looking for a way to use a can of chickpeas without just dumping them in a salad. This was so delicious on wheat toast with lettuce that this has been voted in our family to be make regular lunchtime appearances.  Thank you.

While making this last night I was unsure of how it would turn out... Until I took a bite of my bagel this morning (and boy am I sure happy I made this!). 

I followed the recipe relatively close, but i cut back on the onion (1/2 would be waaaayyy too much for 1 large can of garbanzo beans). I ended up using a bit less than 1/3 of the onion finely chopped.

I also omitted the dill (as a personal choice) and added a bit more lemon then what the recipe called for. I also ended up adding a bit of garlic powder and some cayenne pepper.

I let the mixture sit overnight and prepared by bagel this morning with a bit of creamcheese and this mixture on top.

SO DELICIOUS!!! 

I am definitely adding this into my lunch rotation :)

I've made this recipe several times, but it's never actually made it onto a piece of bread.  It's so yummy that I just eat it out of the container with a fork.  The original recipe is a bit celery heavy for my personal taste, so I cut the amount in half.  I also suggest using fresh dill instead of dried.  It really makes a big difference.  Next time I'm going to try replacing the mayo with evoo to take it from vegetarian to vegan.  This is a fantastic recipe for lunch and snacks plus it's easy to tweek the ingredients to suit your taste.

Read it, craved it, made it, ate it... all within the last half-hour. Loved it! Some observations:

I followed the recipe exactly, and both my husband and I thought it was excellent when tasted by itself. Then I slathered it between two slices of toasted sprouted wheat bread - and all I could really taste was onion and the tang of lemon. I think I will try a sandwich again, but open-faced, with only one slice of toast. I think my preferred use would be as a spread for crackers or toasted pita triangles, akin to hummus. I love dill but really couldn't taste it in the recommended amount, so next time I will add more (or maybe mine is old).

I also can envision adding one or more of the following: chopped marinated artichoke hearts, black olives, bell pepper (red and/or green), finely grated carrots... 

Thank you for the recipe! We gave up meat two weeks ago, and I have been searching for great ideas like this.

The taste reminds me of an egg salad sandwich.  The prep says 20 mins because those beans take forever to mash.  Otherwise this was very easy and can easily fill 3 hamburger buns.  I served with a tomato on top.

With the exception of using vegan mayo (nayonaise), I followed the recipe exactly.  I let it sit in the fridge for an hour and it was fantastic.  Next time I'll double.  Thank you for this great recipe that my whole family loves!

Yummy!  This kind of tastes like egg salad.  We've been missing easy sandwiches since becoming vegetarian and I have a feeling this will be a regular this summer.  I did add extra mayo and some mustard.

What a great starting point for an "add to" recipe. I would never have thought of it, even though I make hummus on a regular basis. I never seem to be able to leave a recipe alone but I am rating this based on how it is written, rather than what I choose to add.  Can't thank you enough. Hummus is now #2 on my munchie list.

Very good and flavorful. I cooked my chickpeas and have enough to make it twice. I read over a lot of the reviews and added a bit of dijon mustard, a teaspoon of garlic powder and an extra tablespoon of mayo. Did not have any lemon juice.  It resembles tuna to look at, but it's not much like tuna to taste. Really good recipe though and a keeper.  Thank you for posting it.

This was EXCELLENT! I'm still drooling over it. It was a very satisfying sandwich. I put it on an Orowheat thin and added spinach, and I used my resources since I didn't have dill weed... and used 1/2 tablespoon of dill pickle juice. Definitely going to make this again and again!

I liked the idea of this right away, but I'm not crazy about beans right out of the can. I tossed the beans in olive oil, added salt, pepper, garlic powder and chilli powder and threw it in the oven with some frozen miripoix  and let it bake for 20 mins at 400, stirring twice or so. I pulled it out of the oven and stirred in 2 tbs of light mayo (didn't mash) and filled a warm pita. Very, very delicious. Very, very satisfying.

Very good. I didn[t have any chick peas so I used a regular sized can of great northern beans instead.  One green onion, splash of hot sauce, and all of the above.  Can't wait till lunch tommorrow! I tasted it with the above beans and it was good.  I semi-smashed the beans.  Anymore recipes Fishlove?!
Back again..........This time I tried it with WalMart
no name garbanzo beans and they were like rocks. I think that a better brand might mash better. Next time; food processor.  Watch the onion because it can be overpowering. Try dill that comes in those plastic tubes that hang in the produce department.  I have been working my way through the rack and are handy to have on hand.

If you like this also try hummus.  I am from California so I use hummus and would use this in a tortilla. It is faster than heating up frijoles since it tastes good cold.  With some cheese in the tortilla you can have a really good and tasty breakfast.

I followed this recipe perfectly and thought it tasted simply awful.  I guess it's an acquired taste.

Tasty, but the raw onions were a little too strong for me..I will try less and use red onions next time.

Yum, yum, and more yum!!! Ive been a vegetarian for 4 years now, and didnt realize i missed this basic homey flavor. I followed exactly, minus the raw onion, and it was so good!! Its important to mash them pretty well if you want to eat a sandwich, otherwise, the whole chick peas just roll out. Yum!

So easy, flavorful and filling!!!  I used a honey dijon mustard since I didn't have any lemon. I loved it in a whole wheat pita. I could even eat it straight from the bowl.

This was great, but only after letting it sit. I would recommend letting it sit overnight before you want to serve it. The flavors meld really well. I was surprised that with so few ingredients, this was so good. I used mine as a dip with veggies, awesome!

Love the healthy factor but it was a tad bland.  Seemed to be missing something.  I like lots of veggie dishes but this one needs a little meat in my opinion. I will add a bit of tuna next time.

I am not a vegan or anything like that but like something different for lunch.  This was very tasty.  I also added a chopped dill pickle.  I ate it on whole wheat pita with cucumber and tomato.  I might try Greek yogurt next time instead of mayo.  Very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty, I followed this recipe exactly except for using grapseed mayo because I needed it to be vegan.  I served over toast topped with a little honey mustard...delicious! Quick and easy to make as well.

This was amazing! I used dried (boiled) garbonzo beans and chopped them in the food processor after they cooled.  And I couldn't find dill in my supermarket so I put in some paprika and it was delicious! I added some diced orange bell pepper for extra crunch and sliced cucumber on top.  I also put some grilled chicken breast for extra protein.  I think you can put anything you want and it will be amazing!

Great Recipe!  Followed recipe exactly.  We put some baby Romaine and tomato in a whole wheat pita, loaded with the chickpea mixture.  Other reviews suggest less lemon, I loved the recipe exactly as is - it gives it a little zip without overpowering.  Really refreshing sandwich!  Can't wait to try some variations. . . .

This is pretty good. I know this sounds weird, but to me it tastes like egg salad! LOL. Obviously it looks like it, and has some similar textures. It is just as satisfying. But I used light veganaise instead of real mayo.   Overall, a very good vegetarian sandwich filling. If you are looking to branch out from the good ol veggie burger.

Using green onions adds a great flavor. If you use veganaise, this is a great vegan recipe. I spread my sandwhich mixture onto two pieces of bread, put a slice of cheese on top, and put it under the broiler until the cheese melted. Tasted like a tuna melt :)

This was really good! Used a 14.5 oz can garbonzo beans and used a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise and followed recipe as is. Also for added flavor added tablespoon dill relish, garlic salt, pepper, & onion powder. Will make this one again!

Totally delish! Made this as a light supper with a bowl of soup, and I had PLENTY of leftovers. Midnight snack, breakfast, and lunch for the next day! I added a bit of greek seasoning, and more mayo, and it was gobbled up!

I love this sandwich spread.  It's not only just for sandwiches.  For breakfast, I make toast and top it with this.  So good.  The first time I made the recipe as is.  Since then I've mixed it up some.  Instead of mayo, I use plain Greek yogurt and add some chopped dill pickle.  For my own tastes, I only use a 1/4 onion.   Definitely a keeper.

Amazing dish. Just like tuna fish salad. I took it to my parents house and everyone loved it. That's says a lot considering they aren't usually keen about my vegetarian dishes. I used light miracle whip instead of mayonnaise (personal preference). Thank you for this recipe!

I have made this a few times now and it has been very enjoyed. I learned that adding some bread and butter pickles cut up real small, veganaise and dijon mustard help make this recipe a five star. Great for light summer sandwich and with pita chips as well.

Easy, tasty.  I don't use this as a sandwich filling though.  Too heavy and dry.  Very good with lettuce and veggies.

I really liked this; the rest of the family tolerated it. I subbed a small red and a small orange bell pepper for the celery. Left out the dill and used Trader Joe's 21 seasoning salute and pepper instead. Also added sweet relish like some people recommended. Ate it on toasted sourdough bread. I think I processed mine more than other reviewers, as it actually reminded me more of egg salad rather than tuna or chicken salad. Will definitely make again.

So good! I've been vegetarian for 14 years and really missed tunafish sandwiches. Great recipe! I substitute the mayo with Veganaise.

Really Good!  I did have to add some dill relish to "zing it up" as it was pretty bland as written.  Mustard or Horseradish might add some zing too.

Loved this recipe, thank you.  I'm not a big fan of celery so I replaced it with red pepper, and replaced the dill with curry.  I've been dreaming of having another sandwich all day.

I made a few changes to suite my tastes, though. I didn't have celery so I used an orange bell pepper instead for similar texture. I also used fresh dill weed because I just prefer fresh over dried. I also doubled the amount of mayo but I'm sure it would've been fine with 1 tablespoon. Served it on toasted honey whole wheat bread with pita chips on the side - Absolutely delicious!

We loved this! Could have used more mayo & maybe some hard boiled eggs to make it all gel together better. We skipped the dillweed. Didn't seem to be lackong on flavor.

This was OK. As some suggested - I used the food processor and it worked well. I think it was a tad dry and a tad bland. I added a drop or two of hot sauce and that was good - but I want to try other additions - this is a good base, but I am going to need to up the flavor profile next time.

I made this with vegan mayo and also added tomatoes and cucumbers.  The result was a little runny, but still yummy.  I used it like a dip for baked pita chips.

Love, love love. Absolutely delicious! i got impatient mashing the peas with a fork, so i just reached in and broke them up with my hand (i would have used a food processor, but i wanted it to have a bit of texture.) I subbed the large amount of onion for 2 green onions, and added quite a bit of mayo to make it spreadable. delicious on crackers and croissants!

I thought it was just OK - tastes too much like tuna (not a fan), was hoping for more of a hummus flavor.  I do think it tasted much better the next day after it chilled and the flavors blended together.

Wow! I really wasn't sure about this but wanted to be a little adventurous... talk about surprised, this was awesome! I didn't put the onion in cause I'm not a big fan, but it turned out great. And now I'm officially hooked on chickpeas of all things. Thanks for sharing!

I -just- made this for the 1st time. I doubled the recipe. I thought it needed more mayo so Instead of 2 Tbls, I did 4Tbls. It tasted great! Then I realized I forgot the lemon juice. I didn't have lemon juice but i read one reviewer added a bit of mustard in stead. I added a teaspoon prepared mustard and it's still great but better without it.  I think it's just amazing and I cant wait to try it later tonight and then tomorrow and see how the flavors meld. So far I am TOTALLY in love with this recipe!

YUM! It almost makes you think you're eating chicken salad! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding more mayo. 1 Tbsp just didn't quite cut it for me. I used light mayo and used about 1/4 c. VERY good!

I was so impressed with this.  Like some of the other reviewers, I was skeptical because of how simple it seemed, but this really is delicious.  It tastes kind of Mediterranean and kind of "generic sandwich salad"-esque, but it's really tasty all the way around.

The simplicity of this recipe is misleading!  I thought it was going to be bland, but the onion and celery have great flavor and crunch, and I piled my sandwich with this spread, broccoli sprouts and lettuce, and it was both filling and fantastic!

Great recipe,  but the amount of onion needs to be reduced significantly.  Next time I'll use 1 - 2 whole spring onions.  Freshly ground pepper tasted great in this.  Maybe next time I'll add some fresh garlic.

I followed the recipe just as written except I did use a little more mayo and used a little less dill. Some have said it tasted just like tuna. I didn't think so but I liked it even better. Not a fan of the fishy smell of tuna. Will definitely fix again. Hubby who loves everything was not a fan but I will fix it for myself. Might add just l little more lemon juice next time. Good for a quick, healthy lunch.

This was delicious!  I added raisons which really added a nice sweetness to the dish, and used fresh dill and low fat mayo.  I also removed the skins from the chickpeas - I'm not sure how necessary this is, but it's how I was taught by my father and I think it makes the consistancy much smoother.  You just rub each chickpea between two fingers and the skin slides right off.

Very tasty!  I will definitely make this again.  I added chopped kosher dill pickle, plus some pickle juice to help moisten it.  I used 1/4 tsp of dried onion powder instead of fresh chopped onion.  I left out the celery and followed the recipe otherwise.  Delicious on a whole grain wrap or with wheat crackers.  Good lunch for Fridays in Lent.

I love chickpeas!! I never thought of putting mayonnaise on it and making it into a salad. I've always just put in on top of salads. I'm not big on dill, so I eliminated that. I ended up using 1/4 c.  fat free Miracle Whip to make it tangy. But it still was a bit bland, so I put the filling on a whole wheat soft tortilla, drizzled some honey mustard on it and added some chopped lettuce. Now, I have a new favorite! Thank you for the recipe.

As my family has gone "veggie", I wanted to find something to fill sandwiches with.  I didn't put dill in it (I'm not a huge fan) and it reminded me of a tuna sandwich.  Good on toasted whole grain or rye.  I put the chick peas and chunks of red onion in my food processor to make it easier to put together.

Wow! As a vegetarian, I've been needing a little secret like this to keep up my sleeve. Kids love it. Great as dip too. Folk raved about it at parties. Plenty asked for the recipe, including 2 who also never eat mayo. It was just *that* good.

So easy, delicious and filling! Took just a few minutes to make but what a treat! I skipped the celery and used a red onion which gave it just the right kick! Created a delicious sandwich with some cucumbers and tomatoes. Yum!

I felt the dill was WAY too overpowering. I decided to try this again with cumin and it was very good. Maybe that just personal preference.

This was fantastic on the Finnish flat bread and topped with tomato and avocado. I added a little extra mayo after refrigerating it for a couple of hours to make it more spreadable.  I will try olive oil instead of mayo next time.

Great sandwich spread and so simple to make. Would be great in a pita, a wrap, or just plain sandwich bread. This will add some much needed variety to my lunchbox. I like the ideas for adding garlic and Tobasco.

Even my friend who hates chickpeas loves this recipe! I often make it for picnics and serve it with pita. It's also quite good with fresh red bell peppers in place of the celery. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a really great recipe!  It is so quick and easy and also very versatile as it can be had with almost anything. You can add almost any dressing or spices you want to it to change the flavour.  I made this recipe the first time with out the celery because I didn't have any. I have to say its so light compared to the tuna/chicken salad version, yet still just as filling.  This is definately something I will do again!

I made this recipe the first time without onions (because I didn't have them on hand) and less chickpeas than called for, it was delicious. Then I tried to make it with the onions, and it didn't work for me. Now, I leave them out and just throw all the ingredients in to taste, rather than measuring things out. It is really good in a sandwich with some cheese or as a chip dip.

Very tasty. I can't eat mayo, so I substituted with yogurt. My only complaint is that I couldn't get the chickpeas mashed enough with a fork so it was chunkier than I would have preferred (alas, if only I had a food processor). I didn't have any celery, so I added some chopped cucumber instead. Very yummy!

this was really delicious.  i kind of just added the amounts i wanted of the different ingredients.  i added some extra lemon, not quite a whole stalk of celery, and less than a fourth of an onion.  im so glad i added less onion!  i also added a tiny bit more mayo, and cooked the beans a little before mashing them.  i wish i would have put it in a food processor to make it more smooth.  but it was surprisingly delicious!

I tweeked it...sorry.  Used veg. oil and fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of mayo and left out celery.  Added chopped green onions then pureed it with the seasonings including garlic.  Delicious.  Used with with grilled shishkebobs. (Reminded us of hummus.)

I really liked this simple recipe.  I have had something like this once before at a sandwich place years ago.  It's basically hummus with mayo instead of olive oil.  I made it into a mock tuna salad and put it on white bread with lettuce and sprouts and pickles.  It was great!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe yet. It has become a regular in my arsenal over the past few months. I've used it for appetizers on crackers, for sandwiches, in pitas and in flour tortillas for a wrap. The only thing I change is that I add a bit of finely chopped garlic--seemed to be the only thing it was missing. My meat-loving, veggie-hating roommate fondly calls it a "more sophisticated hummus" and I'm pretty sure my other vegetarian roommate sneaks spoonfuls out of the fridge. Bottom line: LOVE IT. Thanks so much.

eh, this was okay.  quick and filling but i wasn't too crazy about the seasonings.  i didn't have a lot of the things so i used onion, garlic, tomato, dill pickles, basil, salt & pepper all mixed together.  i think making it into better tasting hummus would've been a better option.

This was fabulous! I am big on dill and actually added a little extra after following the recipe. I left out the onions (not a big fan) and served on homemade toasted wheat bread with alfalfa sprouts, red leaf lettuce, Cabot cheddar cheese and carrots. I highly recommend this recipe.

I  just didn't like this as much as I had hoped I would.  It wasn't bad, just didn't love it.  It reminded me of hummus and with bread it was just too tasteless.

This was very good!  I had to use some substitutions: green pepper instead of celery (I'm not buying a whole bunch of celery just so I can use one stalk) and sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  I also used 2 tbs of sour cream instead of 1 (the recipe seemed like it needed more than 1 tbs to hold it together) and I used the normal 15.5 oz can of chickpeas instead of 19 oz because I've never heard of a 19 oz can of chickpeas.

It tasted really good and it made a lot.  I put it on sandwich bread and it seemed like I could have gotten 4 or 5 sandwiches out of it instead of 3.

The one problem I had with it was the onion.  The flavor was way too strong.  Either cut down on the onion or saute the onion first.

Good stuff! I have made it a couple times now.  It is especially good if you put some relish on the sandwich. A great alternative to that fish in a can! I wonder how it would do in a faux tuna melt?

Tastes good, if a little bland. Will add some hot sauce next time. The texture is not too much to my liking, so I am going blenderize the leftovers to see if that helps. A good base recipe to adapt to suit your own preferences. Thanks!

Good and versatile.  Also great for both veggie and tortilla chip dip.

Delicious! Simple, easy and a nice alternative to egg salad sandwiches. I omitted the onion and added 1 big chopped dill pickle instead of fresh dill. Great for a light supper or snacks.

This is pretty good. I think the taste of the spread depends largely on the quality of the chickpeas you use.

Versatile and good, although mashing the chickpeas were a pain. I forgot to add the celery, drizzled in some evoo (extra virgin olive oil) and used a little less mayo. Goes well on toast with lettuce and tomato.

This turned out great, and I'll be making it often. I'm not a fan of mayo, so I used Italian dressing. I also added some leftover green pepper. I used a food processor instead of mashing the chickpeas because they kept flying out of the bowl.

I made this last night to bring for my lunch today but my bf and I couldn't stop eating it so I only have a little left for lunch. I used a little extra dill and didn't think it was bland at all. Mashing with a fork took too much time so I used my "mini chopper" and just pulsed it a few time on each batch. Worked great. I will definitely make it again.

Very good. Even my meat-eating boyfriend suggested this a second time.

This recipe was so good I made it several times a week, without the celery.  It's so quick and delicious, great for a vegetarian on the go!  Thanks!
