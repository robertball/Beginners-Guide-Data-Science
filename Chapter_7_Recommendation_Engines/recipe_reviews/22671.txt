The first time I made this, I looked at my husband and said, "You try it first." He in turn, like little Mikey, said, "I ain't trying it first, you try it."  Since then, we have discovered we really like this for a change of pace, and it is great to take to a covered dish dinner.  I double everything and bake it in a 9X13 glass baking dish, and instead of using the buttermilk biscuits, I use 2 cans of cresent rolls/ 1 can unrolled will fit the bottom perfectly, and the other for the top crust.  Before filling with the meat mixture, I bake the bottom crust about 5 minutes first.  I also added some cumin and ceyenne pepper just to jazz it up some, and often use a variety of cheese, whatever I have on hand at the time.

excellent!!! My husband loves this so much he's told me to never forget this recipe!!! I will make one change though, I will defninitely pre-cook the biscuits until they are ALMOST done, then I make the recipe.  2nd time I made this, the top layer of biscuits weren't quite done underneath (the middle ones), and I don't think I'll leave it to chance.  This is a very versatile recipe.  I added a layer of cottage cheese mixed with shredded cheddar and it was delicious!!! I highly recommend this recipe!!!!
I also recommend making them with the "grands" rolls as they are so good and flaky!!! leftovers?? what leftovers???

I tweaked this a bit as well, I used cheddar and mozerella cheeses, adding 3/4 cup to the meat mixture. I also added 1 1/2 cans tomato sauce. The chili pepper and sour cream were wonderful.  Instead of can biscuits, I made my own, split the dough in half, rolled out the first half pressed, it into the bottom of an 8 1/2x11" glass pan, then added the meat mixture, more moz. cheese over the meat, then rolled out the second half of dough, pressed it over, added the chedd. and moz mixture over the top, then drizzled the remaining of the second can of tomato sauce over the top.  Baked for 25 min, and when it came out it looked like a magazine cover.  It was awesome!  The crust, top and bottom turned out perfect. The husband said it was so so good and is a keeper for sure!

I made some changes to this recipe because of the reviewers suggestions. I added corn and a can of rotel tomatoes with chilies. I didnt have any sour cream so that was simply omitted. Even though I added tomatoes I also added the tomato sauce. I used Mexican cheese but only on the top. I forgot to put some in the beef mixture. (oops)And when I cooked the ground beef I added minced garlic instead of garlic salt. This was a good dinner that my husband liked more than I did. Next time I will try Grands biscuits since the ones I used were too small and just didn't give enough crust. I will make this again and probably do it the same way as I did tonight.

I baked the crust before hand like other people suggested. I then filled and baked it, turned out great!  Reminds me of a comfort food.  Thanks for the recipe

I sprinkled garlic powder on the ground beef while browning it instead of adding garlic salt at the end. I also baked the bottom layer of biscuits for 7 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. This was a wonderful meal with lots of flavor!

This was great.  I also doubled the recipe and put it in a 9X13 pan instead and it worked out well.  I also used the Pillsbury crescent rolls for the top and bottom.  It was like eating chili in a biscuit!  I will be making this one again and again.

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!!  I have made this twice so far with excellent results.   I sprinkled my cheese on before adding the top layer of biscuits.   I also jazzed it up with chopped green and red bell peppers.  It is even better warmed up the next day!    Thanks

WOW!!! I made this for my husband tonight and he ate 3 helpings and is now sitting on the couch rubbing his stomach :) I used about a tablespoon of taco seasoning, probably a bit more, I don't measure very often. I also added a can of corn and kidney beans. Definately bake the bottom layer of biscuits for a bit first or else they won't get done. My husband said this is definately a keeper!

This was good!!!! Well, as written it may not be the leanest dish in the world, but I did make it at least a little healthier. I used ground turkey, whipped low fat cottage cheese in lieu of the sour cream and omitted the egg. I added a few more seasonings and used pepper jack cheese in the mixture but topped the biscuits with parm. For me, one can of tomato sauce wasn't enough and I could have used more biscuits, but I made do. We all really enjoyed this!

I tried, then reviewed, this recipe in 2001 and gave it three stars. I recently gave it another try and it came out better!  Either the recipe was modified since then, or I was asleep when I first read the instructions.  True comfort food.  My only suggestion: bottom layer of rolls is not necessary.

It sure tasted better than it looked or sounded! Had good ratings and reviews so I thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did.  I did accidentally use green onions instead of regular, but still turned out great!

Delicious!  As always when I need a great recipe, I manage to find something on this website.  I wanted a 'ground beef something' the other night and decided to try this recipe.  It was soooo good!  I only had a smaller can of biscuits, so used them on the bottom and just used a mix of cheddar and monteray jack cheeses on the top.  I also used Rotel instead of green chiles. It was so good that I couldn't quit eating it!  I will be making this soon as a potluck dish for work as I told everyone how good it was the next day.  The only problem with the recipe now will be waiting on it to finish baking so we can eat!

I've made this recipe for years and love it.  You can put whatever you like in the meat (serrano peppers or mushrooms or corn, etc).  I've always used Grands biscuits and stretched them out a bit to cover the top and bottom.  A great southern dish.

Really good.  Did a Mexican themed version of this.  Basically, made a chili base with red kidney beans, tomato paste, salsa, and added the secondary ingredients, (egg, sour cream, cheese) according to recipe.  With these alterations, it is a 5* dish.

This was a great recipe, however, just by looking at the ingredients, it seems it would be bland.  I added 3 times as much garlic salt and 2 times as much chili powder, and it turned out just great.  I'm sure it would have been bland with the ingredients listed though, as some people say.  It tasted alot like sloppy joes, however, the twist was the biscuits!  Great idea there.  Besides the spices, I used a jalapeño pepper instead of the Chile pepper, and kept everything else the same (well, besides the garlic salt & chili powder).  I also cooked the bottom layer for 5 minutes beforehand, as some people warn.  I give it four stars, great recipe.  Oh btw, this feeds four people as a whole meal, not ten!

Very good...quick and easy dinner. My changes: 1lb. beef-this was plenty,lots of fresh garlic, 4oz.tomato sauce, a drained can of Rotel and cumin. I did pre-bake the bottom crust about 5minutes and layered the extra cheese (mexi-blend) on top of the beef mixture with the biscuits on top. Browned up beautifully, no sogginess anywhere. Served with fresh fruit salad and corn.
Whole family enjoyed, not too spicy for my daughter and almost spicy enough for me!

My husband and children LOVED this recipe and I loved it because I already had all of the ingredients on hand.  I used a packet of taco mix and an 8-oz can of tomato sauce in the ground beef- That provided just the right amount of spice for us.  I also used cheddar cheese, which tasted great.  My husband has asked for this dish to become a staple.

Yum! We really enjoyed this dish for dinner this evening. I didn't have green chile peppers but I did use a can of diced tomatoes with green chille peppers. I didn't have the larger can of biscuits but I made due with the smaller size and it came out just fine. The bottom crust was probably thinner than normally prepared, but we liked it that way. I sliced the biscuit into thirds. It will definitely be served in our home again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is so flavorful yet mild. We call it "Taco Pie." It has been 3 years since I found this recipe. Both my 2- and 5-year old love it! I don't know anyone who dislikes this meal. It's the best!

My only tweaks are to use 1/2 tsp seasoned salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of garlic salt; and to use a full 4 oz can of mild diced green chiles. 

Also, you do not need to bake the biscuit crust beforehand. You just flatten the biscuit halves until they are less than 1/2" thick when  they are all flattened into a single large circle in the bottom of the pie dish. It is never doughy, and always turns out delicious!

I only disagree about the number of servings this dish makes--  2 pies serve 4 adults and 3 under 5's with a slice to spare.

I didn't care for this much but my husband did.  I used Pillsbury's Golden Corn biscuits for a Mexican flavor and served it with lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sour cream.  I thought the amount of breading was overwhelming and the meat mixture lacked some flavor.  There seemed to be a discrepancy with one of the ingredients.  I bought a 17 oz. can of biscuits (not 10 oz. as the recipe calls for) and had less biscuits than what the recipe indicated.  It all worked out and I used all but one of the biscuits using an 8 inch pie pan.  I won't be making this again unless my husband really wants it.

This recipe tasted great! However, it was very ugly looking. My family had to be convinced to try it. I'll have to fix it up a little bit to try to make it look a little more appetizing, maybe it needs a little bit more biscuits on top if using a 9x13 dish. Tastes great though! Thanks!

This is a new family favorite meal! My hubby keeps bugging me to make some more. I might add some diced tomatoes next time just because I'm curious. But I highly recommend this one!

Loved it! I used crescent rolls instead of biscuits (1.5 cans). I also baked the bottom layer a little before adding filling. Yummy!

Both my husband I liked this--good flavor.  Although, I thought the egg with the ground beef gave the beef kind of a weird consistency--I might leave that out next time.

This was good, not great.  It is good alternative if you are looking for beef something and want a change.  It would have been 5 stars if there was corn it it.  The flavor is tasty but tiresome after the first few bites, so I think corn will do the trick to add some umph.  I will be making this again, but with corn.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It works great with Colby-Jack cheese too, instead of just plain Monterey Jack.  I also add some garlic powder for a little extra spice.

I tried this recipe last night and found it to be very tasty. I changed it just a little, I added chili oil as well as the chopped chili peppers. I also added monterey jack cheese with jalapeno peppers. I used a 9x13 pan and used 2 cans of 7.5 oz of biscuits. It was a hit. Thank you for the recipe.

This was delicious and so easy to make. I printed the recipe before I left for work and my husband surprised me by having it ready when I got home. A true comfort food that just makes your stomach feel warm and cozy after eating. My daughter rated it 12 stars!

Let me start by saying that the dish tasted really good.  It really did.  My family even agreed.  But I had a hard time getting them to even try it.  It did not *look* good and they couldn't get past that.  I could and really enjoyed it.  I didn't have the refrigerated biscuit dough, so I made a double batch of Bisquick biscuits with buttermilk.  I spread half the dough in the bottom of the pan and pre-baked it. Then I topped it with flattened balls of biscuit dough.   I won't be making this again, not because I didn't like it, but because I don't think my family will want to touch it again.  Too bad.

I made this recipe for my Daddy on a trip home recently and he loved it! He never ever compliments food, yet he did this one.   I made a few slight changes (don't we all) but not much. I used one jalepeno instead of the pepper, fresh garlic (with the beef) and salted it myself, a pizza cheese and light sour cream.  The next day he even came home for lunch instead of going out and heated some of the leftovers up. I will definitely be making this again (though I might try crescent rolls, as one other reviewer mentioned). I might also add a little more spice to it, as I really like spicy stuff.  Thanks for sharing!

The kids and I loved this dish!  I actually doubled everything and baked it in a 9x12 casserole dish.  I didn't have any green chile so I used bell and jalepeno peppers.  It was fast, easy and kids loved the fact they were able to help.

It was decent.  I didn't have any green chilis or sour cream, so I used a small 8 oz can of salsa verde for the spicy kick and I melted in some cream cheese in place of the sour cream.  It turned out well.  I also added a can of corn for a little something extra.  I ended up not putting biscuits on the bottom, I can only imagine an undercooked soggy mess, so I prebaked them half way and then put them on top.  It turned out to be quite a comforting meal and was even better the next day.

This is a big hit at my house, especially with the guys. The last time I made it, I switched up the sauce and made a BBQ sauce with ketchup, mustard, brown sugar and vinegar to taste. Then continued with recipe as written - YUM!

Pretty good.  Young picky eaters at home ate it up.  I didn't read the reviews prior to making, but wish I had because I realize I should've flattened the dough a little more.  The bottom layer was a little doughy in the middle of pie plate.  Will flatten and cook a little longer next time.

My family loved it!! My four year old had three helpings. I doubled recipe and used 9x13 glass baking dish greased. Added a packet of taco seasoning along with chilli seasoning. Prebaked bottom for 6 minutes and I also put cheese on top for last 15 minutes. Bread was not soggy the first day or on the next when I reheated.

I thought this was great.  I have a picky daughter, so made her's in a separate pan, without the onion and green chiles (canned, chopped).  She loved this dish!!!  Rarely see her Love anything!  Good Job.

Very good. I made it with crescent roll dough because I was out of regular biscuits and it came out very well that way. Would recommend for a quick night dinner.

Really good comfort food. I used some chopped up red bell pepper instead of the green chili because that's what I had. I used cheddar cheese. I, like others, had to add extra spice, about 1 12/ tablespoons chili powder and a few drops of hot sauce, to jazz it up a bit. It was great and will definitely be a common meal in our house. Kind of a twist on the sloppy joe!

Yummy beef, but not much else. I have a taco pie recipe that layers seasoned ground beef, kidney beans, shredded cheese, crushed doritos, lettuce, and diced tomatoes on a biscuit crust. I think I will use this recipe again for the beef but add the other ingredients from the other recipe. Together they will be fantastic!

I love this recipe...I lost it and found it again.  Its a staple in our home!!  I modified it a little to suit our palate, I use green pepper instead of chili pepper, add a can of tomato sauce, and I use almost a tablespoon of chili powder.

I don't like spicy foods but this was a little boring.  If I make this again I will add more spices.  Maybe a taco seasoning kit like another reviewer advised.  I also doubled the recipe and used 2 cans of crescent rolls (they lay perfect in a 13 by 9 inch pan).  That was also advised by another reviewer.

My husband and I love this simple casserole.  I make the recipe just as it is, with the addition of some frozen corn to the meat mixture, and occasionally I will use jalepenos if I don't have chilis on hand. The brand of biscuits I buy only has 8 in a package, so in order to make a nice crust, I cut the biscuits in half and spread them on the bottom of the dish.  Then I evenly place the biscuit tops over the meat mixture.  It doesn't matter if the biscuits have gaps between them on either layer.

LOVED IT!! I didn't have sour cream, so used 1/2 c. refried beans, added corn and cumin after reading ALL the reviews!  I used crescent roll dough--prebaked the "bottom crust" as suggested--I think next time I'll just put a top crust of crescent rolls--don't know why some reviews said it didn't look good--it looked DELICIOUS and golden! Hubby and friends loved it, too!!

I have made this several times.  This last time I used an 8oz bottle of taco sauce (medium) instead of the tomato sauce.  I used cheddar cheese vs. the monterey jack.  I ommitted the egg.  Very tasty.

I thought this recipe was great. I used green peppers instead of the green chiles. I seasoned the ground beef with garlic powder and complete seasoning and I used the cheese i had which was Mozarella and Cheddar and it turned out awesome. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!!! My 2 kids, 3 and 1 really liked it also.

I substituted 1/4 cup diced green peppers for the green chilies.  
I suggest to lightly grease the pie pan so the biscuits don't stick.
Use a thin layer of biscuits on bottom - for they did not cook completely and were gooey.
My 18 month old LOVED it - and so did my husband.

Fantastic. i cooked the bottom layer of biscuits til right before they were done and then added the innards. I didnt have green chilis, I used fresh jalapeno peppers, diced. I didnt have sour cream instead I used a package of cream cheese. I didnt measure the amount of shredded cheesez just winged it off of personal preference. I also added chopped mushrooms just because. I was extremely surprised that it turned out as delicious as it did after all my alterations. this recipe is super versatile.

I added a can of stewed tomatoes (drained) instead of the tomato sauce and it came out very good.  I also used crescent rolls and will pre-bake the bottoms for about 5 minutes next time.  Very tasty!

Tried this for the first time tonight with a few minor tweaks. I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the tomato sauce and used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute instead of chili powder. The result was along the lines of beef stroganoff betwixt tasty cheesey biscuits,  which was fabulous! No problems with putting the raw biscuit dough bottom or top, the cheese was the sacred glue for the whole thing. I like a little hot sauce on mine and it's defiantly going to be a go to in my house!

Very good and easy to make.  I cooked the bottom layer of biscuits for about 7 minutes before adding meat.  I subbed cream of mushroom soup for sour cream.  Used 3 cloves of garlic when browning meat.  Added Italian seasoning and cumin after adding tomato sauce because meat mixture seemed bland.  Will make again.

Husband and I agree...good colder weather dish.  We don't care for spicy so used only 1 tsp chili powder and a red bell pepper in place of hot pepper.

I made this today for me and my roomie since I had all the ingredients.  I pretty much followed the recipe as is except for a couple of things.   

Used a pound of ground meat. Replaced the green chiles and used a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles.  I didn't drain the can of Rotel before adding it to the meat so the meat was a little juicy (but still good).  I seasoned my meat while it was cooking instead of adding it at the end.  I used salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Tasted the mixture and noticed that it was a little bland so I added more seasonings along with some Cumin and around a teaspoon of sugar to cut that tomato bitterness and that seemed to give it a great flavor.  Did not have Monterrey Jack cheese, so I used a Mexican blend.  I also didn't add the egg. I used a 9 x 13 pyrex and like some suggested, I baked the bottom half of the crust for about 7 minutes before adding the mixture and topping it off with the rest of the biscuits.

All in all, it came out great and the roomie complimented me on it and he never does that.  Next time I'll only use 1 pound of ground beef cause it made more than I thought it would.

This is SOO good! I seldom take the time to actually review recipes on here, but this one was worth it. I did as others suggested and baked the bottom layer of biscuits for about 7 minutes before adding the filling and top layer. I also added spinach for a healthy boost. My family devoured it!

This is delicious!  Not complicated, cheap ingredients.  The only thing I  have changed is the use of cressant rolls, suggested by some.   My husband is a super picky eater, thank goodness my children are not, and he even agreed to add this to our dinner rotation.  I love that it is fairly simple, something I can make b4 leaving for work at night and my husband pull it out of the oven.  I just tried this dish, what the children left anyways, THIS IS AMAZING!  You have to give it a chance you will love it!!!

Most of the family liked this.  I only used four biscuits split in half to make the top layer and left off the bottom crust.  I Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Since there was less crust, I didn't get 10 servings out of this.  I would say that I ended up with 5-6 servings total.  Thanks for sharing!

Good fall/winter recipe. My hubby and 2 yr old loved it. Really liked the flavors from the seasonings, really nice. Next time will try it w/o the egg as I like things runny. Used ground pork for lower fat.

Simply amazing! I made a few modifications. I baked the bottom layer of biscuits until the were almost done. For the beef mixture, I added about one teaspoon of seasoned salt, onion powder, and oregano. I also added a little extra garlic powder, minced garlic, and chili powder.

It was good, not great. I wish I would have read the reviews first, I think adding some chili beans would have helped. My husband really liked it, said it was a "man's meal". I'll give it another shot with the beans next time.

Wow, both my husband and I liked this. This was spicy and good.  I did take my in-laws advice and used canned chilis and used her biscuit recipe for the top.  On top of it all I had a cold and this really helped to clear up my sinus problems for a while.  Thank you.

This is a very tasty recipe. I made a few changes I followed others advice and used cresent rolls instead of biscuits, which I baked for about 5 minutes before adding the meat mixture, used canned green chiles instead of fresh, and added some cummin. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a flavorful dish, easy to make, and ingresdients usually on hand. I discovered after I started that I didn't have any tomato sauce, but I substituted the same amount of Cambell's tomato soup and it turned out well. I used regular size biscuits (not the Grande type), it took 2 cans. This would be fantastic for camping cooked in a dutch oven. Maybe try a flaky biscuit or crescent roll?

Yummy.  I used another reviewers suggestion and sub taco sauce for tomatoe sauce.  Glad I did.  I rolled the dough out with a rolling pin to make it easier.  Did not read the recipe through so I was suprised it was a pie.  Loved it.  My daughter calls it sloppy joe pie.

This recipe is both tasty and easy to prepare.  Most importantly even my picky kids liked it!  We substituted chipotle chili powder for regular chili powder which gave the meat a nice flavor.  Following the suggestion of others we used two cans of crescent rolls and baked the bottom layer for about 5 minutes.  Nice to have found a recipe that the whole family likes.

Excellent recipe. Didn't have chili peppers, so it wasn't spicy, but added a few other spices like garlic. Also used cresent rolls and they were great. My whole family loved this one.

My husband really enjoyed this and I have made it numerous times. I change things slightly every time to mix it up- i like to omit the chiles and add mushrooms.

This is a fantastic comfort food recipe. Not only did my husband, who, like me, has grown accustomed to "gourmet" from living in San Francisco for 10 plus years, love it, so did my 16-month old daughter! (For her I removed the chiles that were already cooked in and it wasn't at all too spicy for her.) I added a tad more chili powder, and probably a touch more salt, and it was perfect. I did find it easier to leave the biscuits intact rather than trying to separate them in layers. Just stretch them out a bit to fit the pan, and they should be flat enough. All in all, delicious!

Wonderful!  In a pinch?  Usually have these ingred. on hand & can cut time atleast in half by baking bottom "crust" 5 min., adding mix (I use thin slices of Velveeta & NO egg) then baking addt'l 15 min. or so until tops were brown.  I omitted cheese from tops, but brushed butter while hot instead.  Yummm!  Will make again!

I thought this was a little better than my husband did.  He thought it was just "ok".  I omitted the garlic salt and chili powder and used a taco seasoning packet as other reviewers suggested.  I also cooked the bottom layers of biscuits for 5 minutes before adding the filling and top layer of biscuits.  I waited until the last 5 minutes of cooking time to add the cheese to the top so it would not get crispy.  I thought it was pretty good but since hubby did not like it I won't be making again.

I added a can each of corn and kidney beans. I substituted the green chiles for a can of rotel (including the juice). I used crescents instead of biscuits. We just didn't care for it. It was dry and kind of bland. Husband said he prefers some of the other things I have made better. Thanks anyway.

average dish- the biscuits do not cook all the way through, so had to throw most of it away.  I would definitely cook the biscuits on the bottom all the way through before adding the topping.  it's okay.

Simple, satisfying & good. Don't precook the biscuits, they brown up plenty while cooking. I added a little more spice & waited until the end to add the cheese. Thanks.

This was not terrible but too dry and not much flavor.  Also, if you are goint to make this I would definitely suggest not putting the cheese on top until the last 5 minutes of baking.  It just gets over cooked looks burnt and dries out and becomes hard.  Will not make again.

DH and I both enjoyed this.  It was almost like a sloppy joe pie.  I did not have the chile pepper on hand, so that's probably why.  It was still good, but next time I will pre-cook the bottom a bit, and I would like to try more veggies in it.

By the time I got done tweeking this, it wasn't much like the original recipe.  I read all the reviews and took some tips.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with chilis as I didn't think 8oz of tomatoe sauce was enuf for that amount of meat.  I also put in green pepper and celery while browning the meat and onions.  I also added a Tbls of homemade dry, taco seasoning and some garlic powder as I thot there needed more seasoning.  I also added a can of rinsed kidney beans.  As hubby likes them and it makes for a good filler and fiber.  I used crescent rolls and pre-baked it for 6 min. in a 10 inch pie plate.  I didn't need to as when I added the meat mixture, the crust started getting too brown.  I didn't put the top crust on as I didn't want so much dough.  I served this with shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, chopped onion, taco sauce and sour cream.  I don't think I could have given it a 4 star rating without my tweeking, tho.  I did like the creamy taste the sour cream and cheese in the meat mixture made.

I've been wanting to rate this recipe for a while.  The first time I made this, my boys (13 and 11) fell in love with it.  It's a great recipe for (my) kids.  Don't be afraid of the green chile -- it doesn't make it too spicey.

This was a good recipe...tasted good and was pretty easy.  Only change I made was not adding green chili's, and adding 2 teaspoons of taco seasoning.  I did bake bottom biscuits for 5 minutes, but think the all over cooking time could be shorter as my pie got quite brown (could just be my oven).  Will add corn next time, like others suggested, for more texture.  Good way to use ground beef and will make again!

This is a good mid-week meal to make. It's easy and fairly quick. I scaled down the fat a bit by using fat free sour cream and ground turkey. Also added pees and carrots. Didn't have a pie pan, but a 9 x 2in baking dish worked just fine. My husband absolutely loves it!

FANTASTIC! My whole family LOVED this recipe. I recommend doubling the recipe because after the 5 of us finished, there was only one piece left and you will regret not having leftovers. I cut back on the spices and substituted garlic powder for garlic salt. I used butter-flavored biscuits, mild cheddar cheese, light sour cream, 1 lb. ground beef and no green chile pepper. It was SO easy and delicious; I am definitely going to make this one often!

Very good. I made this pretty much as directed except I used a 4oz. can of chopped green chiles and substituted cumin and red pepper because I didn't have chili powder. I didn't have a problem with the biscuits being doughy.  They were perfect after 28 minutes.

This recipe was really good and easy to make. My husband absolutely loved it. You realy need to cook the biscuits almost all the way before you put them in the dish. I also used a little less meat, and added some Mild Italian Sausage. I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt. I also used a little cajun seasoning and cumin.
This recipe is really a keeper...

I browned the beef with some garlic for additional flavor and added a can of sliced mushrooms. This was an easy yummy dish that was great on a cool fall night.  I'll make this one again.  The leftovers were even better!

I enjoyed this recipe but not as much as my husband. We had enough for leftovers which I think tasted better the next day.

When using a 9x13 pan as one suggested, make sure to use more than one can of biscuits.  Duh, right!  When I precooked bigandflaky ones for 10 minutes on the bottom first, the end result was burned bottom.  Otherwise, the flavor was good, it just rates low on the presentation/looks.

The taste was too conflicting for my husband and I.  All the separate pieces are nice, but mixed together like this, was too complicated for the tastebuds.

Very easy - very tasty! Perfect for a cold winter night as a stick to your ribs kinda dish! Thanks for sharing. Pretty easy to alter if you wanted. Maybe Monterey Jack with Jalapeno pepper cheese? Cayenne pepper? Great recipe.

This dish was pretty good.  What it lacked in appearance, it made up for in flavor.  I used a can of Rotel. I also used flaky biscuits because they're easier to separate.  I'm not sure if I will make this again or not.  It was quick and easy though.

My husband and I liked it alot, but my kids would not eat it.  They are very picky.  It was fast and easy to make.  It tasted very hardy with a down home country taste.  I just wish my kids would have liked it.  But it is totally worth trying.

Thank you! My kids *ate* this! I was shocked! Very picky eaters! I used a can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese instead of the shredded cheddar. Came out so good! Will definitely make this again! - Sharon

Very delicious, but kinda heavy, even though I used fat free sour cream and low fat cheese.  I like the idea of spreading the biscuits up as a pie crust.

This was a wonderful recipe! Sometimes my family isn't too excited about eating all of the things I get the gumption up to make. My son even liked it and he only likes very basic tastes and foods. It appealed to my hubby because it had the flavor of the pepper and chili powder. But the spice wasn't so overwhelming that the kids didn't like it also. It reminded me of chili with crackers. Will definately make again.

The bisquits made a nice crust, I also ran them up the side of the pie plate. The flavor is good and the cheese layer is unexpected. My family said I could make this again.

A few changes - no egg, no chili peppers, no sour cream.  I made my own biscuits instead of refrigerated dough.  Also added mushrooms and olives.  It was positively delicious and my husband says "it's a keeper".

I used low-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and real garlic. I added cumin and 3 teaspoons of the chili powder. I also put the cheese on top of the meat mixture as well as a bit on top. Some of the biscuits were doughy so I will cook longer next time. My husband liked it as well.

Read the other reviews before making this. We like the versatility this recipe provides.
Pre-bake the bottom is really the only "must".

This dish is so delicious and easy to follow. I did make some changes because I didn't have some of the ingredients, like I made the biscuits from scratch and, like another reviewer, I added canned diced tomatoes and also canned green enchilada sauce and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. My husband loved it! I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

I had to cut the recipe to serve 6.  It was easy to make and we liked it we just didn’t love it.  Maybe because there were too many biscuits,  I don’t know but it was something I will try to make again.

I've been eating this recipe since the late 70's. My mom made it and I've been making it ever since. It is so tasty and easy to make! My brother came down to my new home today (helping me move in) and I made it for lunch. It was a blast from the past for him! Needless to say, he was very pleased!

Very good! I made low carb biscuit mix. I accidentally forgot to add the tomato sauce, but it was still yummy, although I wish I had added it. I added some jalapeños because we like spicy. Enjoyed it!

My family loved this. I used grand style biscuits. I over cooked slightly, so it was a little drier than I would have preferred. My DH loved it, as well as my g-daughter (the picky 19yo).

THE BOTTOM LAYER OF BISCUITS WAS SOGGY, WHICH BOTH MY HUSBAND  AND I FOUND UNAPPEALING. WE FELT IT WAS LACKING IN FLAVOR. MAYBE MORE TOMATO SAUCE WOULD HELP.

This is a very good recipe. It was easy, not overly time consuming, and everyone enjoyed it from the four-year-old to the forty-year-olds...  Two variations. 1) I omitted the sour cream, because my husband won't eat it.  2) I used two cups of cheese, because...  CHEESE!  I actually meant to top my piece with sour cream and hot sauce. But, I forgot to put the sour cream on, and only realized it when I wrote this review. I didn't miss it!  It was delicious.

Because I was out of  several ingredients, I had to substitute. Turned out pretty tasty. (Used Chipotle Chili Pepper instead of Chili pepper, used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and used Garlic Power instead of Garlic Salt.)

I used ground deer meat in this recipe, and used cheddar cheese instead of montery jack.  It was delicious! I also doubled the recipe for my family of 8.

new family favorite! I only tweaked a few things, I pre-cooked the biscuits until almost done, I added a can of rotel (as opposed to just chilies) and I mixed in a bit of taco seasoning.

The filling just want to my liking.  I followed a suggestion to bake the biscuits a bit first so the wouldn't be so soft, instead they were Chewy.  Can't see me trying it again.

i made the recipe exactly as is, I pre baked the bottom as suggested. The cook time was too long, biscuits were hard and over done, and I thought there was too much bread. Might be better with top biscuits only and baked for a shorter time.

This was pretty tasty for a different, quick throw together dinner. My husband enjoyed it and has been eating leftovers for lunch.  I didn't have a chili pepper so I added a can of Rotel tomatoes along with the tomato sauce.  I left out the egg.  The meat filling was moist and flavorful.  Hubby suggested adding corn to the filling, so I'll do that next time.  There will be a next time.  :)

With little ones in the house I had to cut out the heat of this recipe. Made it more of an herb Italian seasoning. It turned out really hearty. The hubby loved it as did the little one. I did bake the first layer of the biscuits as well really helped the speed of the meal. You can have so much fun with h
This recipe. I would love to try it with taco seasoning side of sour cream guac... Shredded lettuce... Have fun experimenting.

We weren't thrilled with this one, but it was okay. It seemed like a lot of biscuit and not enough of anything else. Maybe if it included some tomatoes or other veggies and less bread. We will probably not make this again any time soon. It is easy and fast tho.

Good recipe. I left out the egg and chili's, seasoned the meat with cumin, chili powder, garlic and onion powder, and added corn. I did prebake the biscuits about 5 minutes. Big hit. Will be making this again.

I don't know what exactly it was about this dish that made me not love it. I guess it was a little bland. I used a fresh Serrano pepper instead of a chile pepper, maybe I should have used two.

I made a batch of Bisquick biscuit dough, rolled it out, and put solid sheets of dough on the bottom and top of this casserole.  It was good, and I think we'll try it next time with shredded chicken. Plain yogurt instead of sour cream would be an easy way to cut some of the fat.

Adding whole kernel corn, green peppers AND a can of Hot spiced Rotel, gave me the very slight Tex-Mex flavor I was hoping--but I think the sour cream and/or amount of cheese used may be why the heat was tamed. Splashing on some juicy chunky salsa, however--saved the day. I liked this dish and am confident my picky family will, too.  I'm giving this dish 4 stars: It's a snap to make and gives another idea on what to do w/ that ground beef.

I made these in individual cupcake tins and used ground turkey instead of beef.  It tasted a little bit on the salty side to me but my husband loved it.  Also it reheats well for leftovers.

This recipe looked appealing to me because I generally like all of the ingredients, but all together just didn't go well. It had weird taste that I can't quite pinpoint and no one in my family really liked it.

Best and worst thing(taste too good and so calorie bad) I ever cooked. I modified it slightly. Because I like it spicy, I added sea salt, black pepper, hot sauce, white pepper, quarter of fancy vegetables pack minus string beans.

I did what other reviewers suggested and added 1 can diced tomatoes, black beans, and extra spices.  Still not impressed overall.  Would maybe try again.

The biscuits do not cook fully. You would have to precook the biscuits first. I didn't feel like the filling was that tastey. This might be better with some other veggies incorporated in.

This is tasty! I added salt to the meat mixture and decided to use more chilies for more flavor. I also baked the biscuits at the bottom for a few minutes before I put the filling in. This is really an easy delicious dish!

Easy and tasty one-dish meal. I used jumbo biscuits, putting 4 on bottom and 4 on top so that I didn't have to worry about tearing them apart. I baked the bottom layer for a few minutes first, and it worked out great!

This was an okay dish...I added extra cheese and incorporated many of the suggestions given by previous reviewers.  I cooked it in a 8X12 pan since it seemed like too much for a  9-inch pie pan.  I likely won't make this again.

This was ok, i followed other reviewers advice and baked the biscuits before pulling on filling, but the top buscuits were still gooey.  BF said it tasted like a sloppy joe. did not taste good the next day, very soggy.  good try but i dont think i will make this one again.  Thank you

I expected this recipe to be tastier, but I had to add extra garlic and chili powder.  I could've done without the bottom biscuit layer. This dish was edible, but not a pleaser.

I've made this without the green chiles (may be good to add), bake the biscuits a little first and used cheddar cheese.  Decent, easy and quick meal.

This turned out much better than I expected. The only things I did differently were to use serrano chillis, and I omitted the egg (didn't see the point of it). This was a quick, easy and hearty meal. Thanks!

This just wasn't for us.  I do suppose it has a great title as it is simply beef and biscuit.  I think it would be just as good and probably easier if you just used ground beef and a bottle of bbq sauce.

Well, unfortunately I didn't bake the biscuits first like some reviewers said- and voila- uncooked biscuits  : (  Other than that- the meal would have been delicious-  I did add chili beans- didn't have a onion so I used onion powder- Definitely will try again- cooking the biscuits for a bit first!

Very good recipe.  I added a can of diced green chilies, and they provided a nice little "zing" to the dish.  My girlfriend first made this for me, and she used ground turkey instead of beef.  It was just as delicious that way.

this was a quick meal that my extremely picky three year old ate! i used salsa like someone else suggested and it came out a little too salty, i'll use a little tomato sauce next time and that egg didn't do anything that a little extra cheese couldn't. this is a good standby when you're low on time and pantry items.

This was really good. Even my 2-year old daughter liked it. I partially baked the biscuits before I put this in the oven, like a few other reviewers suggested, and I didn't have any problem with soggy biscuits. A good dish. Thanks!

Wow I was really impressed with the outcome of this recipe. I cooked the beef mixture as directed but added some cumin, fresh garlic, and salsa. I omitted the eggs and had no problem with the mixture being to runny. Though I did have some problems wtih the crust. I precooked the biscuits as suggested but then it took so long for the top layer to cook that the bottom layer over cooked and became really hard. So to solve this problem I think next time I will layer the biscuits in a "pie crust" fashion and precook. Then layer the meat mixture and add the cheese layer at the end of cooking and garnish with some green onions and sour cream. This had a good flavor, and was a quick meal for a weeknight dinner.

Initially, I thought this was pretty good.  It does not make good leftovers, however.  I liked it more than the rest of the family.  So, this will probably not be made again in my house.

This was great though I modified the recipe a bit based on what I had in my kitchen.  Instead of using beef, I used ground venison.  I browned it with onions, seasoned it with McCormick Hot Taco Seasoning, and threw in a couple homegrown serrano chilis.  I will take others' advice and bake the bottom crust a bit first...  otherwise the bottom crust gets pretty soggy.

I have been making this recipe for several years and it is my husband's favorite.  I am vegetarian so I substitute Morningstar Farms burger crumbles for the beef.

Talk about comfort food!  Serve this up with four cheese mashed potatoes on the side and have warm fudge brownies and french vanilla ice cream for dessert! I loved the chili powder mixed in, it gave the dish a unique taste.  My boyfriend hates sour cream (I didn't tell him it was in there) and he had three servings!  I think next time I'll try it with ground turkey meat to cut down on the fat.  4 rating on the "Yum" factor!

We loved this recipe! I made it in a 9 x 9 stoneware pan, used only 8 biscuits and added more cheese on top! After I made this, I thought it was so good that I e-mailed the recipe to my foodie friends.

With sick ones in the house I didn't have a lot of energy for cooking or for running to the store.  I had all of the ingredients in the house, but ended up subbing the chili powder and tomato sauce for salsa (I don't like chili powder's after taste).  I took the advice of another reviewer and added chili beans to the mix as well.  With the addition of the chili beans (1 15 oz can)I had to bump the pan to an 8x8 deep dish.  My picky eater ate it that night and the next for left overs, and my husband said he could have it again.  It was the right spice for that day, but I might kick it up a touch with a heavier salsa next time.  Thanks for the fast recipe!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish and it has now become part of our family cookbook. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it wasn't spicy, but I do not think it's bland either. (My hubby and I aren't crazy about spicy so that was good.) The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is because I consider 5 stars a recipe in which every person would LOVE. And while my family likes it, I'm not sure I can put it in that category.

Sorry...this one was a "no go" for my family.  A bit too bland.  But the idea is good -- Read the other comments and liked the idea of using crescent rolls on top instead of biscuits.  Would also have to use different seasoning to make it spicier if I served it again to my bunch.

This was yummy! I did make a lot of changes...I left out the sour cream and chili peppers. Instead, I added green bell pepper and corn. Since I did not have any tomato sauce, I used ketchup (sounds weird!), it gave it more of a BBQ flavor that turned out really good. I followed the suggestion of others and used croissant rolls, but only put a layer on top of the dish. All in all, it turned out great and there weren't any leftovers. Thanks!

The kids loved it!!  My 3yr old DS had 4 helpings, the others had 2.  I did not care for the biscuits, especially on top.  I think I'll take the advice of others and use crescent rolls in the future.  I didn't have enough sour cream so I added about 4 Tbs of cream cheese.

sorry, but this didn't do anything for any of us...and there are 6 in our family.  my kids have kind hearts and ate it anyway, but i knew they didn't care for it.  i heard them whisper :)   my hubby, who is more blunt, took a couple of bites and said he was going to pick up something at work since he was running late?  and me...well, i ate it, but it really was plain.  its just what it sounds like, biscuits and ground beef with tomato sauce, sour cream and cheese...and green chilis.  my hubby kindly requested no casseroles for a while?  thanks for the try, tho.

I used ground turkey in place of beef, egg beaters in place of eggs and fat free sour cream to make this dish MUCH healthier. It turned out AMAZING. You'd never know the difference.

Fast good meal. Just enough spice, could even go up a notch! We've added it to our families favorites.

Thanks!

This was pretty good! I made biscuits from scratch, added corn, and took out the chile stuff. (i'm not a fan of terribly spicy things) My family enjoyed it, and it's a good comfort food recipe.

WOW! This was fantastic! I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and it came out perfect.  Next time I make it I'll submit a picture. The biscuits where beautifully brown on the bottom and the cheese was lightly browned on top. No need to precook the biscuits or add the cheese at the end. However I know that my oven is perfectly callibrated. This is definately getting added to the rotation. I would ease up on the chile peppers if you're feeding this to children though.

Mmm, mmm good.  Used Pillsbury Golden Corn biscuits and added 8oz. frozen corn, a clove of garlic, and a can of kidney beans to the meat mix.  Nixed the garlic salt as we figured it would be salty enough with the cheese and biscuits.  Subbed plain yogurt for sour cream and bumped the cheese to 2 cups.  Baked it in my round stoneware dish and the biscuits came out just right.  Let it sit about 5mins or so after taking it out of the oven for the juices to soak back in.  Was SO good and super easy to make too.

This was interesting.  The dough never fully baked on the bottom and was mushy -- not good at all!  The taste of the ground beef mixture was relatively good.

Very easy and pretty tasty - but not really a "wow" recipe, a comfort meal but that could have been jazzed up a bit.  But my family enjoyed it and I would make it again, perhaps adding some hot sauce or a hotter pepper than a chilli.

I rarely give recipes a one, but the taste of this was not enjoyable.  I don't care for spicy and so I omitted the green chiles, tasted weird with the egg.  I cooked this recipe at the temp and for the time given, and my biscuits burnt on the bottom of the greased pan.  I threw this out, I won't make this again.

I have to say that this didn't last in my house. My husband could not stop eating it. This takes alittle bit of work but I have say that it is worth it. This recipe was talked about at a family event and ended up emailing to 3 members of my family. Thanks for the recipe..

VERY GOOD!!! This was the perfect comfort food! I omitted the sour cream because I don't care for it. It bordered on being a little dry (totally my bad).. Also took the advice to pre-cook the bottom layer for app. 8 mintues, turned out crispy. Worked perfectly in my 9x9 pan w/ a roll of crescent rolls. Also cut the cheese down to 1/2 cup in the meat mix, and none on top. DELISH!

Excellent!  Used: 2 lb extra lean beef, a 14 oz can of tomato sauce, grated cheddar, 2 cans crescent rolls. (Ingred.'s I had on hand).  I added  about 1/8 tsp of cumin as well to the sauce.  As per others, I baked bottom layer of dough first.  Everyone raved.  Thanks for the great recipe.

We had a mixed review at our house.  I precooked the bottom biscuits and they got over cooked.  I add taco seasoning, rotel and 1 cup of corn.  It turned it fine.  The top was good with the cheese cooked on the top.

Made this last night for dinner and we loved it!  I modified a bit from reading other reviews.  I didn't have chili seasoning (thought I did) so I used a packet of chili mix and added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I cooked the biscuits for about 7 minutes first before adding the meat mixture.  I used a 9X13 pan so next time I will buy more biscuits!  All in all boyfriend had three helpings and I have plenty of leftovers for lunch this week!  Will definitely make this again.  And if you used light cheese and light sour cream all in all the calories and fat aren't too bad!  Yummy!

This was pretty good, although next time I would do as others suggested and prebake the biscuits, because it did turn out a bit doughy.

Although I would have given it a five star, my family was less enthusiastic. I prebaked the grand biscuits for about 10 minutes and used a 9 x 13 dish. I used pepper jack cheese with a bit of cottage cheese as well. As my wife said, it tastes a lot better than it looks.

I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS AT ALL. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BLAND AND TOO DOUGHY. MY HUSBAND SAID IT WAS OKAY BUT TOLD ME NOT TO KEEP THE LEFTOVERS. I WILL NOT MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN.

I made this recipe with unrolled crescent dough and left out the chili powder.  It was really good.  Kind of tasted like a cheeseburger and looked like a meat pie.  My BF loved it--definitely a manly meal!  Delicious the first day but it was not as good the next because the crust was kind of soggy.

This rocks!  You pretty much can't go wrong with it, even if you change it up.  We used just the ground beef and added a can of diced tomatoes.  Perfect, even when reheated!

Really, really good.  I can see how this would be a good pot-luck dish.  I thought it was way to much for a pie dish.  I had extra.  The kids ate it up.

This was pretty good. It was quick and easy, and I had all the ingrediants on hand. I thought it lacked a little something...maybe some more tomato taste. I may try using Rotel tomatoes next time.

Unless you get the right biscuits, it is hard to separate them.  The meat mixture is great!

This recipe was pretty good.  We tend to liket things a little spicier so it seemed to need something else.  I will make it again and spice it up a little bit.  It is definitely a comfort food!

I recently had gastric bypass surgery so I modified this to a low fat version by using a low fat cheese, sour cream and ground turkey instead of the beef.  This was an excellent source of protein and low in fat.  Big hit with the kids and my husband not to mention easy on the belly!!!  A++ in my book
