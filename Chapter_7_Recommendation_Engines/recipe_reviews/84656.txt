With a few personal changes, I thought that this was one of the best stuffed chicken dishes I have ever tasted.  First, I would suggest doubling the stuffing per the number of chicken breasts you are making (if you are making 2 breasts, follow the recipe as is.)  I also doubled the tomato, added 1/4 cup red onion, 1/4 cup of diced green chiles, and a 1/2 teaspoon of red chile flakes.  To make the chicken extra moist, I glazed the stuffed chickens with a little store-bought taco sauce.  Finally, eat the chicken over a little spanish rice and you will be delighted!

Just wonderful! I did make a few changes however. As some suggested, I added garlic and red pepper  flakes, used the measurements as listed for only 2 chicken breasts and served over rice. In addition, I used chunky salsa instead of the diced tomatoes just because that's what I had on hand and I added lime juice to the crockpot (I didn't think that there was enough liquid to cook the chicken - didn't want to chance burning it). The 'juices ' were great on the rice. Very flavorful!  It was the best crockpot recipe I have made thus far.

It was my Sunday to cook and we all know I love Mexican.  This looked like a quick and easy recipe and I was making a more complicated appetizer, so I thought I'd try this.  Also, been meaning to break out the crock pot now that the snow's here.  Doubled the recipe EXCEPT for the cilantro.  Added some red pepper flakes and used canned diced toms with jalapenos for a little extra zip (we like it spicy!).  I had some trouble rolling the breasts (first time I've done it) but the thin cutlets definitely helped.  Wasn't sure if I liked the looks of it when it was cooking, but it tasted great and we enjoyed it served over brown rice.  It needs something else... I may throw in some fresh garlic next time or maybe chop up some onions.  Also, I think I want to put the mixture through the food processor.  I think making the filling into the paste may add in the preparation.  Thanks for the recipe -- definitely a great Sunday dinner!

I thought this was a very simple, and very good recipe.  I made a couple of changes - #1 - I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and it was done in about 2 hours, not 3.  #2 - Since I was in a hurry, I did not make rolls of them, but instead laid the chicken on the bottom of the crockpot and then poured everything on top and just let it cook that way.

I didn't give it a 5 because, for me it could have used a bit of a punch, maybe some pepper flakes or something else to spice it up a bit. Overall, very simple, very quick and will make again!

My husband liked this recipe a lot more than I did.  It was good, although it was done cooking in about 2 hrs instead of 3.  I followed the recipe exactly, then added some extra cheese in the last 10 minutes.  Served it with homemade salsa and chips.  One change I will make next time is less cilantro.

Not sure why, but the cheese seemed to vanish by the time this was cooked.  THere was plenty of juice, but not really a sauce.  I really love sauce, so I missed that there wasn't any, and of course, think that it would have tasted better if the cheese would have become more saucelike.  Otherwise, good, but I wouldn't make it again.

Very good, very flavorful.  I've been looking for a low calorie recipe that was full of flavor and this is it.  Like others, I added red onion and jalapeno.  I also added just another pinch of the spices.  I don't use the slow cooker so I just cooked it in a covered baking dish for 40 min at 350 degrees.  Turned out great.

Ok, I am by no means a seasoned chef so perhaps our tragedy was in my lack of experience- not the recipe itself. Obviously then I found this recipe to be a little difficult to follow. (I have just been married 3 months and this was our first burnt meal.) Good luck to anyone else who tries.

I'm sorry, but I didn't find much redeeming about this recipe. I added fresh garlic plus extra seasoning, and I still thought it was bland. Also, I checked my crock pot at about two hours, and the mixture was starting to burn. I had to add a bit of water to keep it from burning until it was actually done. (I used an instant read thermometer to check.) And finally, I don't know that stuffing and rolling the chicken breasts would be any better than just coating them with the mixture and baking. Thanks anyway....

I changed a few things up a bit, but only because I needed to accommodate what I had on hand. I let the chicken breasts marinate in taco seasoning, red wine vinegar, and hot sauce - my boyfriend likes it very spicy. I didn't have any green pepper, but I did throw in part of a diced jalapeno. Because I was short on time, I followed one reviewer's advice and cooked it covered in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes. Before putting it in the baking dish, I lined the bottom of the dish with some salsa. I used the leftover filling as topping. It turned out excellent, and it got rave reviews from my boyfriend!

I gave it more stars because it was so easy to make and and easy quick go to for a slowcooker.  The cheese did all melt away so next time I would add a little more cheese maybe in the last 10 minutes to the top of each chicken.  I made this for company and got good reviews.  I made an extra breast for another meal for me.  When I reheated it I added cheese to the top...I felt it was much better that way.

Really good. I love cumin so I tried this as soon as I had read it. I cut back on the tomato and added some green chilis (my preference) Topped w/a little extra cheese. Yummy

I served this recipes with spanish rice and black beans.  Overall it is a good recipe, but like everyone else I think it needs a little bit more flavor.  Next time I'll add garlic.  Mine was fine after 3 hours but I had very large chicken breast halves.

Fun and easier to prepare than expected, and went over quite well. Used a reviewer's suggestion and baked it rather than crock potting, since we wanted to eat! Yummy

This was so easy and soooooo good.  i listened to another review and used salsa instead of the tomatos only because i dont like tomato. I put the chicken over white rice and it was amazing. i also only used 2 breasts but kept everything else the same! turned out perfect!  will make this plenty more!

This dish came out so well, I loved it.  I used a very ripe jalapeno so it came out very spicy, but I like the extra spice.

I tried this recipe but put the tomatoes, pepper and cheese in the blender to make a paste before adding the herbs and spices.  The dish tasted delish and the chicken was moist but the sauce mix a little odd in colour. Will keep away from the mixer next time!

This was a really great recipe. Cumin is my new favortie spice! I made some red rice and beans with the chicken and it was an outstanding dinner. I skipped the cilantro (do not have it on Guam!) and it was missed, but will still make this again. Thank you, good job.

The chicken was very tender after slow cooking and the cheese mixture becomes very watery.  It was good with black beans, rice and some extra cheese on top!

The chicken turned out moist and tender, but the taste just wasn't there. It was lacking something and was somewhat bland. Served it over yellow rice with brocolli and cauliflower for the sides. Probably won't make this again.

Woo hoo!! This Mexican chicken comes the closest to an old family favorite for which I had lost the recipe, so I started with this and then added the changes I remembered from the old one.  Let me tell you - this one is a whole lot easier - you will see why :). Although it is very different, I may have the secret you all seem to be missing for the spiciness.  My old recipe called for a whole green chile per chicken breast.  Open it up and fill the chile with a thick chunky strip of monterey jack cheese and either sliced or chopped black olives, cilantro and diced onion is optional. Closing the "stuffing" up in the green chile before rolling the chicken makes it easier to manage while you roll it up and fasten with toothpicks, roll in beaten egg and crushed tortilla chips and brown in oil. Place in baking dish. Whew! See what I meant by the originl being easier? Then take an envelope of dry enchilada sauce mix and stir it down into a can of diced mexican tomatoes and dump that on top of the chicken. Sprinkle with shredded cheddar and bake uncovered for about 40 minutes at 375.  Let it sit for abou 10 minutes before serving to allow the cheese to set back up a little. I like to slice it before serving because it really shows off the layers.  My family calls this "Wow, you must be 'someone important ' bccause Mom says this chicken is just too darn much trouble to make for just the family."  Sighhh... what are you gonna do with them?

I usually don't care for chicken breasts because they have a tendency to be very dry.  However, cooking the chicken breasts this way, in a crockpot, made them very moist. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I cooked this for the BF tonight and he loved it, although I don't know if that's because I let him eat it while watching the Oilers play hockey...but I tasted it, and the chicken was a little dry but the flavours were fabulous!  I'd make this for company anyday.

So easy and good!  Used green chiles instead of tomato and baked at 350 for 40 minutes as suggested by another reviewer instead of using a slow cooker.  Loved it!

My husband and I had this for the first time tonight! It was wonderful and easy to make. We like our food spicy so we added red pepper flakes and lots of hot sauce. Another suggestion is to use fire-roasted    stewed tomatoes. Great dish that we will make again and again!

This was ok. All the vegetables including the cilantro was frozen and used yellow peppers instead of green because I didn’t have any. Might be best using fresh vegetables as the recipe called for.
