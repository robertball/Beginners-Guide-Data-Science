The wine and feta gave this a "fine-dining" flavor.  I used diced tomatoes instead of whole to save time, and used bow-tie pasta.  The broccoli had a pleasant flavor and did not get "crunchy" as I feared it might.  I thawed the broccoli slightly before cooking.

Usually I find that recipes provide more than the suggested number of servings, but I halved this recipe and it only made 3 servings.  I will admit, though, that I served generous portions because this was so good!  I used a different shape pasta because I had no linguini, I used fresh tomatoes rather than canned, and I omitted the pine nuts because they are so expensive in my area ... but still, this was fabulous.  This will go on my regular rotation of meals, because it was easy to make.  I love the flavor of the flash-blasted broccoli - I'm going to cook it that way next week to go on a veggie pizza.

This was very good. Seemed like a lot of trouble to cook the broccoli this was but it really made a difference. I added one cut up chicken breast only because this was all I made and I wanted it to have some meat. Quite yummy!

We eat a lot of pasta, but this might be the best pasta dish I have ever made!!  It was delicious as is.  I wasn't sure about the lemon, but all the flavors combined to make a very tasty sauce.  The roasted broccoli was awesome - I will make it this way just as a side from now on.  The only thing I might change would be to add chicken or shrimp for more protein and to use a little less pasta.  I like more topping vs. pasta ratio.  Even my pickiest eater cleaner her plate.  I highly recommend this recipe - it is a keeper!

This recipe sounds great, but I'm confused about whether to use frozen broccoli or fresh?

Excellent.... careful not to cook the sauce too long as it will dry out but some pasta water fixes that easily.  I used gorgonzola instead as it was what I had on hand and loved it.  Next time, I will add some fresh basil as well!

Tasted great by omitting the regular tomatoes.  Agree with another reviewer who said this was a versatile dish.

I cooked this for Valentines Day... It was so good and delicious.  The only things I didn't use were the red pepper flakes and the spinach because I don't like those.  My husband liked very much, too.  


It's very easy to do, too. Thanks!!!

I made this this exactly as the recipe said except that I didn't have any spinach so I blew that off.  It was great.  Love the spicy flavor of the red pepper.  Tastes like something you'd order in a nice restaurant....I'll make this again for sure.

This was great! "Flash blasting" the broccoli gives it a great flavor.  Worth the extra work and time

Great flavors, but does not make enough sauce (well, I think it's just enough, but hubby likes saucy pasta). I added grilled chicken breast to the leftovers. Loved the broccoli (used fresh since it's always available at reasonable price in CA).  Substituted slivered almonds for pine nuts--cheaper.  It's not really a lowfat recipe, but very healthful, esp. if using whole wheat pasta.  Will make this again, adding more wine and probably double the vegetables.

This is pretty darn good and healthy!  Made the sauce ealier in the day.  Then made the pasta.  Added it all to casserole dish with a little veggie broth and a sprinkle of cheese.  Heated in oven at 350 till warmed through!  We loved it this way!  Thanks for the sauce recpipe.  Yummy!

Fantastic and like other said, very flexible recipe.  We make it when we want something fresh and flavorful.  About the only changes we made were cooking the broccoli and little longer, adding more garlic, and adding some basalmic vinegar in.

This recipe is wonderful. I found it to be very flexible. I used caluiflower, spaghetti, red wine, lime juice, and pecans. I also increased the garlic to 5 cloves, doubled the red pepper flakes and the sun-dried tomatoes and omitted the spinach. It works well with what you have and can be successfully adapted to various tastes and available ingredients. It is delicious!

This was a unique and yummy dish.  I changed a few things; I used fresh broccoli and chard instead of spinach.  I also tripled the garlic and doubled the lemon juice.  My feta was moist, but worked well in the recipe.  I wasn't sure when to add the broccoli, so I waited to add it until the end, when I added the pasta.  Next time I may add it sooner o that it soaks up more wine flavor. I also added Parmesan and more salt and black pepper.  It was very good and pretty easy to make. My family liked and I will make it again.

I only added cannellini beans (with cumin) to add protein.  Loved the way the broccoli tasted!  THIS IS A SURE WINNER!!!

Delicious! I added a few ingredients I had lying around (shittake mushrooms, fresh tomatoes instead of canned) and ate it with blackened Mahi Mahi. Even as is this recipe is fantastic.

SO DELICIOUSLY TASTY- what a tantalizing, flavorable treat for the palate!  Wonderful dish, easy to make and will become one of our regulars!  Was a bit worried as several reviews mentioned the servings & sauce were skimpy...made this for 3 so cut pasta to 8 oz (used rotini as that's what I had in cupboard) and kept rest of recipe at full amounts & as directed.   The 3 of us only ate about 1/2 of the finished dish - served with a salad and salmon baked in a little pepper, olive oil, lemon & dry white.

Made this as directed and loved it! Directions don't ever say to add broccoli to the mixture. I did it at step 5 when I added spinach.

I made a half recipe of this for my family and it was the perfect amount (no leftovers!).  I left out the onion because we do not care for it, I used pre-diced tomatoes instead of chopping whole ones, and chopped my spinach a little so the pieces would not be large.  I did not measure the feta, just sprinkled on what seemed to be a good amount.  I think next time I would increase the amount of broccoli in this dish.

I've been using this for years- thanks! I use 3/4 pkg of pasta and sub 1/2 cup vermouth for the white wine. I sometimes add kalamata or artichokes if I have them and a lot more garlic. the flash blasted broccoli is so good, sometimes I make just a dish of that alone. delish!

This recipe blew my mind.  I subbed rice for the pasta, and it was fantastic!!!!  As some others have said, the flash-roasted broccoli was so good, I may make it that way every time.  I ate quite a bit of it while cooking the rest.  Perfect!!!!  I highly recommend this dish.

this was very good. I left out the spinach because I don't like it, halved the amount of pasta because we like lots of sauce and added a heaped teaspoon of sugar to the sauce as I felt it tasted a little bitter. we had 3 generous servings with half the pasta. will definitely make again.
