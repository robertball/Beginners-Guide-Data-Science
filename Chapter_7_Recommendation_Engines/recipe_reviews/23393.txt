This was pretty good, but seemed to be missing something.  I will use this recipe again as a starter and add some sausage and spinach.  Thanks for sharing.

Four not five, as it is not extraordinary, but it is good sauce. I mixed the spices up in a sealed container and shook it up before adding the spices to the onion and garlic. Then I added the meat after the spices were fragrant. I cooked it for three hours on high in my crock pot and it came out great.

I thought it was nice. A good hearty sauce, and easily adjustable to your tastes.
There was no need to be rude, Marty!

My family loved this sauce!  I don't understand the negative reviews.  Its as good a beef-sauce recipe I've ever prepaired  Obviously if your looking for sausage or other protein this isn't for you. 
I highly recommend this as an all family & all age delicious meal.
