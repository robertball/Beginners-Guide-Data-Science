If you have a hard time finding Dream Whip, you can cut out the milk and use one small container Cool Whip instead and still get the same end result. I like to make this lighter by using light Cool Whip, reduced fat cream cheese and light cherry pie filling.

My family made this for years but it was called Blueberries in a Cloud. I make it for potlucks sometimes with cherries but usually with blueberries. It has a cheesecake taste but much fluffier and lighter. It is delicious. I try to make it a day ahead of time which makes the cheesecake flavor come out stronger. There are NEVER leftovers.

SUPER SIMPLE and delicious! Oh wow! My husband and I have been enjoying this immensely! It actually got much better the day after I made it. I used a 9x9 glass pan and (I'm embarrassed to say!) stale graham crackers that I had in the cabinet! I also used blueberry pie filling instead. Turned out great!

Not a great cheesecake. Let sit over night for 10 hours instead of 2 and it still didn't change in density. The density does not change because of the shipped cream.  Yes it is cheaper to make but that's because it doesn't make cheesecake.

I have been making this for a few years now...instead of cherry though I use strawberry pie filling...I also cut up fresh strawberries and blueberries and mix them into the strawberry pie filling in a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.... I also add crushed pecans when making the graham crust....so good my hubbies favourite.

It did not turn out.  After almost 4 hrs in the fridge it never set up.  Super disappointed!
