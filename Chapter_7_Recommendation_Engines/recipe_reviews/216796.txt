Absolutely fantastic!  I loved it!  The taste of the puff pastry is so light and flaky, and the inside of apples/cinnamon, etc., made for a very tasty strudel.  I have never made a strudel before, but the directions were very simple and easy to follow. I waited until my strudel was of room temperature to try it and it tasted heavenly.  I now wish i had made 2 or 3 of them to put in the freezer for a rainy day.  Will make an excellent breakfast treat, or a quick snack when home from work. If you are looking for a very simple strudel recipie, try this one.  I don't think you will be disappointed.   NOTE:  I only used four small apples instead of 6.  I think 6 apples would have been way too many.  Four apples seemed to work perfectly.  Thank you Melody, for a wonderful recipie.

Fantastic! Very easy to make with lots of flavour. I did not have the nuts so I doubled the butterscotch chips. There were too many apples though and I will cut them down next time to about 3.

Fantastic "cheaters" recipe! I agree with the first user that 6 apples were wayyy too much. I used around 3, although a lot of the "juice" leaked out and led to a slightly less ideal pastry to apple ratio. Next time, I'll have to be sure to REALLY seal the pastry edges to seal in the filling. Additionally, I didn't have butterscotch chips, but substituted dried cherries, which was delightful.

This is a good basic recipe for quick strudel. My family enjoyed it and it didn't take the whole day to make! I made the recipe as written but used caramel ice cream syrup instead of the butterscotch chips. Gives it a richer flavor and more even sweetness it also doesn't have lumps of chips if you serve it cold.

I loved this quick and simple recipe.  I forgot to put the sugar on the top of the strudel, so I made an almond glaze and drizzled that on top instead.  It was a nice touch. ....Stir together  1/2 cup confectioners sugar, 1 T milk 1/2 tsp. almond extract .   When partly cooled, drizzle on top of strudel.

Lost this recipe, many moons ago, which my family so enjoyed.  Thanks for posting it... what a gift.  This may be "Cheater's" Apple Strudel, but it tastes like Non-cheaters!.  It's a fantastic, fast, easy, satisfying recipe to make and serve.  Thanks again Melody!

This strudel is totally awesome. I made half of the amount. Sprinkled a bit of flour with my apples so that the juice will thicken while baking. I didn't have any chips or almonds unfortunately...Before baking, i spread some egg yolk on the surface of the strudel to give it a lovely brown. My bf loved it! Thanks alot!

Threw this together to take to Oma's house for breakfast...she loved it! Instead of topping it with sugar I made a vanilla sugar glaze, drizzled it on top and added sliced almonds - so pretty! And yummy!

I didn't have butterscotch chips so I added twice as much sugar. It came out just right, not too sweet.  Also sprinkled in a little flour when tossing the apple slices so it would thicken the juices.  I used 5 medium sized apples and it was perfect.  Instead of worrying about whether the edges would seal properly, I put all my apples in the center and then foled in the bottom and top edges, slit the side edges into 1" strips and then was able to interweave them over the top of the apple pile.  Brushed with a beaten egg yolk and then sprinkled on a little sugar to make it sparkle.  It took longer to cook, I cant remember how many times I resent the timer, but just until it was nice and golden brown on top.  It was amazing!!!  Took it to a dinner party and everyone raved about how beautiful it looked and good it tasted.  They couldn't believe I made it.

5 stars even though there were changes (that didn't change the outcome).  Used phylo dough sheets instead of puff pastry.  Also used a mixture of golden delicious, honey crisp, and macintosh apples.  Butterscotch chips give the filling a good flavor!

This was amazing!  SOOOO Goood! The recipe produces a lot more filling than I anticipated which led me to buying more pastry dough.  For the second go-round I made mini-strudels by cutting the pastry sheets into small 2 x 2 squares upon which I placed the filling which I mashed a bit to fit.  I folded the pastry dough over to close and baked according to the recipe.  These minis made great breakfast on the go pick me ups, office treats, and our neighbors loved the little treats!  These were especially good during our frigid Mid-Western winter!

I made this strudel for a German themed dinner. OMG! It was seriously delicious and super easy to make! Just make sure you join seams of the pastry by rubbing the seams with a finger that has been repeatedly dipped in water.  The dough with flawlessly blend into eachother.  
Also, I made and rolled the strudel then put it in the fridge for about an hour. This helped to firm up the dough so I could flip the strudel so it was seam side down.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I finished it off with a light glaze. Immediately after taking the strudel out of the oven, i drizzled it with a glaze (1 1/2c  powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons of milk).  I then lightly  sprinkled some cinnamon on the top.   In addition, I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and only used 3 normal sizes Granny Smith apples. 6 would have made it difficult to wrap with the dough. Yum! I will be making this again!!

I will definitely be making this Strudel again. It is so much easier to use the frozen, (defrosted) sheets. The only change I suggest is rolling out the defrosted dough thinner rather than just out of the package. When I made the dough at home years ago from scratch, we pulled it over the knuckles to stretch until you could almost read through it.  The  filling was delicious with the butterscotch morsels.

Very easy to make-6 is too many apples, I think 4 would be fine.  I used raisins in place of butterscotch chips and almonds. Maybe that's why it wasn't too sweet.  Would have liked it to be sweeter.  But all around good.

Just Made this and KNEW I would love it so I made a double batch of the filling.  I used chopped pecans since I didn't have almonds. Also-I guess my baking sheet wasn't long enough so I had a rectangle of dough left over. No sweat though-I made a mini one right along side the big one! The parchment paper helped me a lot when rolling it up as I think I let my puff pastry sheets get too warm. All in all-very good recipe. I put the rest of the filling in the freezer but I'm betting it won't stay there long! Thank you for posting this.

This was amazing - it was gone in one day!  The butterscotch chips is a nice touch.
