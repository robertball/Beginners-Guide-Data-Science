First attempt cooking chard and it was really yummy! Only gave it four stars as I didn't have red pepper flakes so can't say I followed the recipe to a "t". Great as is though!

I tried & cooked chard for the first time & it was delicious. I'll make it again, maybe adding pine nuts.

My family (husband and 7 yr old son) loved this.  I added zest from half the lemon the last minute of sauteeing the stems.   We like our food lemony.

I should have taken a photo.  Using rainbow chard, this dish was not only tasty, it was pretty, too!  I added half a yellow onion-- finely diced-- and a small shallot (it was an allium extravaganza!), and I think I used a little more lemon than recommended.  Finished it off with some Frank's Red Hot sauce to taste (the red pepper flakes just didn't quite do it for me), and boom!  Tasty greens.  Really well-rounded flavor.  My boyfriend had seconds!  I will definitely be making this again and possibly apply the lemon-garlic flavor to other more bitter greens (collard, turnip, etc.).

Swiss chard, especially prepared this way, is something I grew up eating. I enjoy it so much I even grow it myself.  For those unfamiliar with it you must try it, and the submitter has written the method for preparing it perfectly.  As for the measurements, I’m sure it was difficult to get it all down on paper exactly for purposes of writing and submitting the recipe, so just season to taste.

This was my first time making chard, and what a success, thanks to this recipe! Even my hubby, the hater of all things green, went back for seconds and kept saying how good it was. I only had red chard, but I imagine the rainbow char is even prettier and colorful. I put in a few extra pinches of red pepper flakes and it was the perfect amount of spice. We loved the added brightness from the lemon. A keeper!

Delicious and simple! We also leave the red pepper flakes out and cook the chard in 1/4 cup of chicken stock, drizzling the oil and lemon on afterward. We add salt too!

This is like crack.  It's a recipe you'll want to spring on those competitive cook types in your life. You can watch their eyes pop out of their head while you silently smirk behind your glass of buttery Chardonnay. 

Originally I found the lemon garlic rainbow chard recipe, and was having a hard time choosing between this and that, so I decided to augment this recipe with a little of that  one.   I  decided to followed this one, but used lemon-infused olive oil instead of EVOO, omitted the onions (they hate me and I wasn't in the mood for a revolt), added a pinch of red pepper flakes, and topped with pine nuts.   I also used Mediterranean style feta because that's what I had.

Between the feta, oil and pine nuts there are probably 10,000 calories in each bite, but you'll be to blissed out to pay any mind to that.

It was fun to watch the Rainbow Swiss Chard grow - this recipe had such great ratings, I was excited to try it with our home-grown Chard. It was gross. Maybe I added too much Rainbow Swiss Chard? "Three bunches" seems like a very vague amount. I ended up with about 10 cups of chopped stems and 8 cups of shredded leaves. I tried a bite, and it was so disgusting, I couldn't make my children try it..  Perhaps we're just not "greens" loving folks? I don't think I'll grow Rainbow Chard again next year...

I received a bunch of rainbow chard in my weekly produce delivery and I was nervous to try it out. I'm glad I found this recipe. I didn't have crushed red pepper on hand but I followed the rest of the instructions. Delicious, will definitely make again.

One version that was super eye appealing was sweating small diced onion and then adding green chard with some garlic, pepper, lemon and feta cheese. I didn't use ANY salt. A great way to use up mass quantities of Chard in you garden. Will try balsamic vinegar next time in place of lemon.

Such a simple and flavorful way to prepare rainbow chard! The balance of the acid in the lemon juice and savory flavor of the garlic and just a little red pepper kick makes this a delicious dish I will prepare again and again!

The only problem with this recipe is having enough! I don't know what 3 bunches is because I received some fresh from a friends garden, but could have eaten the whole pan myself! I also added salt and green onions. Who says it has to be hard to eat your leafy greens?

I found one tablespoon of oil to be sufficient which is great for watching calories.  Additionally, I added the lemon juice after cooking so that the taste of it wouldn't be lost in the cooking process.  Yummy!

First time I've ever made chard.  It was great and I'll make it again.  It was a light side dish full of flavor and even kept well for leftovers.  Easy to make.  I think any kind of chard would work, but I found the rainbow at my local Central Market.  I love a good low carb side dish.

First time cooking rainbow chard... where has it been all my life!!!??? It tastes a little like beets without the sweetness. This recipe is super easy and turned out great! Even my 3-year old ate it and said he liked it! Next time,  I’m going to experiment by adding nuts, carrots, etc...

I loved this recipe!! I didn't have red pepper flakes, but I had that spicy seasoning you put on fruit to give it a kick, and it worked just as well! I will definitely be making this again!!

Modified mine a bit since I had little chard left. Used less O.O., added a half summer squash I had left over from a previous meal, and added just a touch of salt. Such a great side, or meal in itself!

This was good. But it is Chard. Chard is chard and just can't be better than 4 stars.

I'm not a chard fan at all. But I joined an organic food co-op, and the first batch of veggies they delivered included a bunch of rainbow chard. I was going to give it to a neighbor, but decided to look for a recipe instead. Found this one, and am so glad I did! This turned out really good, and will be the recipe I use from now on to cook chard. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great. I also threw in some Feta cheese that I had, and that made it even better. But to be honest, even without the feta, this recipe would have been a keeper.

Squeezed a whole lemon, half while sautéing and half at the end. Went a little heavier on the red pepper flakes and added some salt. Delicious!

Loved it!  Added sliced green onions with the garlic.  Everything else the same except I halved the recipe.  I tried it without the lemon and loved it, then with it and I then liked it less but my amazing fiancé then liked it more!  Really good side for so many things.

Never had rainbow chard before - but got it in a food coop basket - now I will be looking forward to getting it again!  I did make a change though - I didn't want to have that much oil- I used just enough olive oil to sauté onions - then I supplemented with chicken broth to get the sautéed texture.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I really appreciated this recipe because the bugs don't seem to like chard as much as they like kale and we had beautiful bunches of rainbow chard. I made them last night as this recipe suggested and was really pleased. This is now my favourite chard recipe. Tonight I have a bounty of beet greens and will look for recipes for those. Thanks for this!

This will be how I prepare chard from now on!! It was a hit as a side dish for a bbq, even with the folks who thought they didn't like it. I did sprinkle some fine sea salt on the greens as they began to cook.  Delish!

I usually don't like leafy greens but this was amazing! I added green onions. Only 4 stars because I'd recommend using a little bit less oil-- it was a little oily

This was so yummy!  I think next time I'll add some sliced onion and sunflower seeds, but really - this is absolutely wonderful the way it is! I grow Rainbow Chard so this is going to be part of our regular menus from now on.  Thanks for the submission!

I never even ate chard before, never mind made it!  I bought some chard to replace beet greens and then didn't need them...so, needing to use them,I saw this recipe and it sounded simple enough.... I used red chard. It was a cinch to prep. I threw the olive oil, some already minced (in the jar) garlic and the chopped chard stems into a frying pan over medium heat with the red pepper flakes as directed. I had about 2Tbsp of lemon zest in the freezer and added that with the chard leaf ribbons, as well as a handful of dried cranberries. I cooked as directed, then squeezed a half a lemon over it and tossed it in the pan with a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese over half of it.....wasn't sure the cheese would be a good addition. It was delish!  Definitely adding chard to my repertoire!

This was delicious! I sprinkled a dash of salt over the dish while it was cooking, and added toasted pine nuts when serving. I made a small batch just to test recipe and family response, wish I made much more! Even my picky son liked it! This is going into regular rotation, so easy and quick!

I honestly thought that I would not like this recipe but I clearly was wrong.  We get local greens and veggies shipped to us every week which is making me try new things. I have never had rainbow chard or the other veggies I added to the recipe (garlic scrapes and kohlrabi).  I also had radish left over from the previous weeks delivery and threw a bit of that in there.  I did top it off with some feta cheese!  The recipe was easy to make and it went over very well with everyone. I will definitely make this again.

Chard is in our regular rotation around here. This is a solid recipe for a leafy green. I used lemon flavoured olive oil and seasoned with a little salt and pepper after it was done. If you're trying to get more greens into your diet this is a good recipe to start with.  Thx ISISILLUSION

Fast and delicious. What's not to love? It's also really pretty if your chard happens to have a lot of yellow stems. I use 1 tsp oil to 1 bunch chard in a nonstick skillet to cut back on fat/calories, but otherwise follow the recipe.

Chard is one of the most bitter greens I have tasted. Not sure if it is for me but I did like this simple, flavorful recipe. I will keep trying with the chard.

I never know much a "bunch" is, so I used 4 leaves.  Once the greens shrunk down it was enough for 2-3 side servings by my count.  I probably overcooked it, but I read 15 minutes cooking time and went with that.  I thought the lemon was a little too much, but I may have just used too much lemon with not enough chard.

I had never eaten rainbow chard before I got it in my CSA vegetable share one week. When it appeared, I looked online for recipes and found this one. So happy I did. This is a very simple recipe that tastes wonderful and is a great side dish to compliment almost any main dish.

Super yummy! It was my first time cooking chard, usually i eat it raw in a salad. I added a red onion with the stems and the dish turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

WOW, this was AWESOME!!!  I didn't think I was a big fan of greens (swiss chard, kale, collards, etc.) but we received some in our produce basket from a co-op, so I came here searching for a recipe.  It was so good - I wish I had more!  I did add a few pinches of salt, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I am shocked that the stems are so tasty.  MUST TRY!!
