This is a combination of flavors and ingredients I am very familiar with and love.  Nothing not to like here!  I did substitute some traditional little rigatoni, added some garlic and skipped the broth which I didn't see the need for.  This alongside Parmesan Sage Pork Chops (also from this site) and some fresh steamed broccoli made for a delicious and satisfying meal.

In my opinion, this is the epitome of a great pasta dish. Simple, tasty, and naked. Dress it up with favorite ingredients, or don't. Eat it chilled with some feta tossed in, and maybe some pine nuts as well. Add wilted baby spinach, and some chopped Kalamatta olives, and some grape tomatoes. Perfection, warm or cold. Another hint: did you know that serving your pasta 'aldente' actually lowers the glycemic index of pasta? Meaning, the carbs are much lower than fully cooked pasta. So cooking pasta aldente means a lot less carbs. True stuff, my friends!

It is a bit bland.  I added some dill, which I think helped.  Maybe a nice side dish with a summer meal.

Hi, I tried this and it was amazing.  Only thing is, I didn't have red and yellow bell peppers and also the vege stock, so I added chicken stock and used green peppers, a few red pimentos, a bit of hot yellow pepper and some kale.  I served it with grilled fish on the side.  All members of my family loved it.

Pretty simple recipe, but pretty plain. Used mini sweet peppers and regular penne pasta. Great for a light meal or side dish.

This was a perfect recipe for all my leftovers .  I read the previous reviews and did not add any soup stock, instead  I added a bit of the pasta liquid, minced garlic,  Italian parsley,  Italian seasoning,  and one can of diced tomatoes. I  also added Parmesan cheese.  I cooked it el dente and let it finish in the sauce.  This will accompany my lunch for work  with some pork chops.

I followed the recipe as write with one exception, I use garlic infused olive oil and it was delicious! For those of you who like a little more flavor I recommend using infused olive oil.

Great simple recipe as is, but also very versatile.  Want more flavor?  Increase the fresh basil.  Add a little crushed red pepper and garlic.

Not sure what happened but I didnt like this very much.  The flavor was too dull for my palatte.
