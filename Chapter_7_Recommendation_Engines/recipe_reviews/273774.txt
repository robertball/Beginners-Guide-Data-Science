I did not have any maraschino cherries, so I used canned pie cherries.  everyone seemed to like them better.

I made this exactly as directed, and after 45 minutes in the oven, it was still raw in the middle of the cake. However the outside was beginning to burn. It tasted very good, but the bake time seems to be off. My oven has been recently calibrated, so I know my temperature is correct. 
Perhaps baking a bit longer at 350 yield better results.
