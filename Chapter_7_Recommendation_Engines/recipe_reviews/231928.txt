This was quite a bit sweeter than I prefer, but it calls for twice the sugar in my usual recipe.  The texture is nice and it doesn't crumble so I'm happy with it.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!  My whole family agreed that this was much better than store bought. Even my very picky son, who ate 3 pieces!  I made it without raisins, cut the baking time down to 45 minutes and covered it with a towel for a bit after taking it out of the oven. I does have a consistency similar  to cornbread  but the flavor of soda bread. I  had to make my own self-rising flour by adding a little salt and baking powder. Thanks so much for this recipe!  Will definitely be making this again!

Yummy and so easy to make! I have an old gas oven so I lowered the temperature about 30 degrees and it only took about 55 minutes to cook.

This soda bread is very easy to make & very tasty.  I used a standard, large size (9" long) bread loaf pan. It baked in 75 minutes, as the recipe says, and the top and sides turned out very brown & crunchy, just like we like it.
