I liked the way the sweetness of honey set off the sour cream taste.  I used fat-free sour cream so it was a simple and healthy dish.

Silly me. I only had regular sour cream, so used that instead. Added a dash of garlic powder and dried parsley to the sauce as well. I used three whole green onions and two cups of leftover ham; the only other thing I did differently was to use all broccoli, since that's all we had. Fast & easy, and tasty. Maybe too much sour cream; next time I will cut back a bit and see how it tastes. Will make again for sure!

This is a pretty good recipe. After its done I recommend baking the whole meal for about 25-30 min and add cheese on top last 5 min. Also it needs some kick with spices. Overall easy and fast supper.
