This is a wonderful recipe - the flavor is just incredible! I added a little (2-3 tsp.) toasted sesame oil because those flavors just begged to be together. The meat was juicy and tender and it looked like meat that had been smoked all day.
My kids were all but licking their plates and were begging for more! Thank you for sharing this!!! We also decided that it would be an excellent salad dressing.

Used 4 good sized pork chops and made as written. Marinated for 8 hours. So much better then the ones I grilled a while back without the brine. Will be making this again.

I added: 1/2 tsp powdered ground ginger & 2 tsp sesame oil.  I made 4 thick (approximate 1 1/2" thick, bone-in) pork chops, placed in my vacuum type Marinater, (using 28 pumps).  There was plenty of the marinade for 4 thick cut pork chops.  Marinated for 24 hours. Then grilled to 155 degrees F., using an instant meat thermometer in the thickest part of the pork chop.  Remove and platter, loosely tent, with heavy aluminum foil, for a full 10 minutes.  Excellent flavor!

My husband and I both enjoyed this to a point. We found a cup of brown sugar too much, it made the pork too sweet. The pork was beautifully tender and next time I will cut down on the sugar

This was pretty good and I'll use this again.  I didn't have ginger so I didn't use it.  And I added a sprig of fresh rosemary.  And I heated the brine in the microwave to make sure the sugar and salt dissolved.  Then I added some ice to cool it down so the chops wouldn't start cooking in the fridge.  The pork chops were very moist.  They tasted just a bit sweet to me.

This Brine is perfect, added just a bit more of both Garlic and Ginger, and used on Country Ribs that I cubed for CJ's Crispy Pork Carnitas. Will revise on turn out, I am patiently awaiting!
