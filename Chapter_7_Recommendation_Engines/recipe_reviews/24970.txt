I used amaretto instead of the brandy because I had an almond filling in my petit fours. It went very well! I did boil it all together also to reduce the alcohol since I was making them for a youngsters birthday.

very yummy! I used this on a wedding cake I was baking & it kept it so moist & gave it a fresh flavor. I didn't use the brandy however, but it was still wonderful!

Made this using amaretto instead of brandy, and it was wonderful.  It kept the cake very, very moist.  Everyone raved about how good it was!

This was the first time I had heard of doing this and was unsure how much to brush on my cake.. . went with my gut. Got rave reviews for moistness. Liked the suggestion of using amaretto.

I used peach schnapps instead of brandy to brush a white cake with. Came out wonderful, and I can definitely see using leftovers in drinks.

I used Rum. it was great. I gave my cake an added taste and kept it moist. I also used about double the lemon zest, cos I really like the flavor and it turned out excelent.
