This was great.  I made a few changes. I didn't fry in the tortillas in oil.  I placed the chicken and some cheese in the tortillas, rolled them up and placed them in a baking dish, topped with the sauce and cheese.  I placed them under the broiler until the cheese was golden-brown.  Yum!

Made this tonight, it was good but I changed it a little after reading the others' suggestions. I browned the chicken breasts before adding the water and threw in some salt, pepper and a little cumin. I skipped the tortilla-frying step as well, just warmed them in the microwave. When the sauce was simmering I added more salt; not enough though, the tortillas soak it up so next time I will keep this in mind. Like some others, I also put these in a baking dish and threw them in the oven for about 15 minutes (@350) to melt the cheese. The enchiladas had a good flavor but hardly any heat (spiciness), so next time I will probably throw in a jalepeno. This would be a great potluck dish!

I am going to have to agree with every other reviewer.  These were awesome!!!!!  By far the most authentic enchiladas I have ever made and I would venture a bet that they're the best on this entire site.  I followed the recipe to a T with one exception...after rolling the enchiladas, I covered them in sauce and cheese and then threw them in the oven for about 25 minutes.  My mouth is watering at the thought of eating these for lunch today. Thanks, Olga...I plan on making these babies over and over and over again!

Delicious!  I couldn't find the chiles, so I used four cans of Old El Paso Green Chiles instead and they have worked beautifully every time.  I love this recipe.

While this could be phenomenal with some tweaks, prepared as written this involves a fair amount of effort in preparation for lackluster results.  I was worried about the poblano pepper sauce being even a little too spicy for Hubs, but I needn’t have worried.  I can’t believe I’m saying this, as Hubs and I have hyper alert taste buds, but even we thought this had very weak flavor. Forget about spiciness or heat – I don’t care about that.  I mean nondescript, flat, dull flavor.  Salt helped some, but even the garlic and onion I added to the sauce didn’t do much.  Nor did a garnish of fresh chopped cilantro.   In addition, we thought these were a little on the dry side and the mozzarella not the best choice for the cheese. Something with more character and complexity would have been better.  Work with this to suit your tastes, as I believe the sauce in particular has great promise.

Great recipe! Added half a cup of chopped cilantro and half a teaspoon of salt to the poblano mixture in the blender, as it seemed a little bland without it, and used pepper jack cheese rather than mozzarella. Served with refried black beans and chips. Everyone loved it!

These enchiladas deserve ten stars. My partner of ten years, for whom I've been cooking steadily for ten years, announced these enchiladas to be the best thing I've ever made. They were unbelievably delicious. I added cilantro and cumin to the blender with the poblanos and other ingredients, and added several dried red chilies to crank up the heat. I also put shredded mexi-cheese inside the tortillas with the chicken, poured leftover sauce and cheese over the top and baked at 350 uncovered for 20 minutes. Let me be clear: these enchiladas are perfection. Absolute perfection. Will become a staple in our household.

Delish! Instead of using 2 raw chicken breast, I used left over rotisserie chicken. Since my chicken was already cooked I added it to the stock with the onion and garlic for only the last 20 minutes.  After the chicken cooled, i shredded it with 2 forks instead of slicing (personal preference). Next time, after draining 1 cup of the liquid, i will reserve the remaining onions and garlic and add it to the shredded chicken inside of the enchiladas (seemed like a waste not to use it). Do not skip the step of crisping the tortillas. Tip: make sure to BLACKEN ALL areas of the pepper and sweat them for a minimum of 30 minutes or longer and it will be a breeze to remove the skin...use gloves when handling.

Awesomesauce = this recipe.  Well, almost, because I changed a few things.  First, I don't do boiled chicken, not ever, the texture is all rubbery and the flavor is so bland, so I made my chicken in the crockpot, dry roast style (chicken, 2 tbs. chile oil plus 1 tbsp. kosher salt, cook on low for five hours, then shred).  Which meant I had to use broth I'd saved from my Thanksgvg Turkey.  Also, I added 1 jalapeno and a nice squeeze of lime juice, awesomesauce.  Sadly, I followed someone else's directions to make this casserole style and I loaded up the pan with the sauce, chicken, tortilla, shredded cheese layers and baked until brown.  Wow, bad idea, Olga was right, just prepare each enchilada on the plate!  I still ate some of the enchiladas, but the corn tortillas had turned to mush (like what happens if you leave a bowl of raisin bran to answer a phone call from your mom.  Why does she always call when I'm eating cereal?)  So, the second time, I made the chick, made the sauce (with minor, tasty changes) and plated each enchilada with a dollop of sauce and cheese for each individual serving.  I had leftover sauce and chicken the next day so I served it atop a pile of couscous with roasted onions and garlic.  This awsomesauce has many possibilities, I might try it with broiled coconut shrimp for dipping, atop smashed potatoes, inside of a veggie rice wrap with a spoonful of mango salsa.  Cheers Olga, thank you for the wonderful recipe!

These were the most awesome enchiladas! Even though I'm a spicy-food wimp (I buy the Mild salsa), and these were quite spicy, I loved them, and just chugged lots of milk to cool the heat. I had extra sauce, which was wonderful over some brown rice I made to accompany the meal, and even mixed in with scrambled eggs and potatoes the next morning for breakfast burritos.

After trying many, these are the best. Used one rotisserie chicken breast, shredded.  Roasted some poblano and Hatch chiles, peeled, then added 4 little pequin chiles for some heat, a handfull of cilantro, 4 green onions, a TB cumin, cup chicken broth and cup F/F sour cream to the blender.  Simmered a bit as instructed. Used Pam to "fry" the 5 corn tortillas just to the point of still being pliable. Filled w/chicken, topped w/sauce and some reduced fat Mexi-cheese. Only used 1/2 the sauce, saved the rest for later. Popped in oven for 15-20 minutes to get it heated through and melt the cheese.  Hubby agreed these are the best I've made.

A little tip; when cleaning the Chile's, peel the big parts of skin off and use a small section of paper towel and wipe the rest of the peel off.  I quarter a paper towel when we start.  Makes cleaning them much easier.

This is fabulous!  I don't like corn tortillas, so I used flour.  I put cilantro in the sauce as well like others had suggested.  I dunked both sides in the sauce and then put chicken and mozz and monterray cheese in the middle.  I then wrapped it up and poured the rest of the sauce over the top and baked it.  I found that 350 for 15 minutes wasn't long enough so I increased it to 400 until it the cheese was bubbling. This is SUPER delicious especially when PIPING hot!  I will be making this again! YUM!!!

Good stuff...did take the advice of others and added about a half teaspoon of cumin and about a teaspoon of salt.  Will make again. I think frying the tortillas is an important step that shouldn't be skipped!

I've made this twice (in less than a week) and I love the simplicity and the flavour that this enchilada has.  What I'm not liking is that the sauce is too thin for my liking.  The first time I made it I used my vitamix blender to blend up the broth, peppers, and sour cream - This resulted in a liquidy sauce. Second time I left the sour cream out and then mixed it into the broth & pureed peppers...still liquidy not as bad.  I think next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll try a simple roux technique to thicken up the sauce but WOW this is GOOD!!!!

Really liked the sauce. Chicken was a little bland. I think they could use a little more inside to liven them up. May try the sauce with spicy shredded beef.

Really yummy., I used plain yogurt with a squeeze of lemon instead of sour cream because i didnt have any.  Also, next time will use a sharper cheese, the mozz was nice but didnt have much kick. I added corn too.  Note to self: be careful with the peppers next time, my fingers and knuckles are still in pain!

Already made it twice in two weeks.  Think the hubby is addicted to this.  First recipe I've ever done with poblano.  Really easy even if the recipe seems labour intensive.  In an hour dinner is ready, quite reasonable in my opinion.  Can be prep'd the night before.

This is an excellent recipe, an awesome sauce! The sour cream works so well! One thing helpful for me is to cook a big batch of the chicken ahead of time, use some right away and freeze portions for later. Having the chicken prepared ahead makes this recipe quick without compromising flavor, I just heat it up with a tad bit of broth. Roasting the peppers is fairly quick and easy, I put mine under the broiler, turning a few times. I find this recipe simple. Some of the best recipes are! I have also played with different peppers with great result. This is an awesome recipe with lots of possibilities! I'm thinking chilaquiles!

Being Mexican this plate lived up to my high expectations! I highly recommend this tasty dish to anyone that would like to enjoy the Mexican tradition without living the country.

This was pretty good. The chicken cooked up to be delicious, but the mozzarella cheese really threw me off. Also, the sauce took a lot of prep, but wasn't really worth the flavor. Def. will keep the chicken cooking process, but scrap the rest.

These are "Oh my God, Good!"  I cannot eat tomatoes yet love Mexican food.  (Do you know how hard it is to find Mexican recipes without tomatoes!?!?)  I was so excited to find this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic!  My husband didn't say a word all through dinner...  just kept eating and nodding his head.  (That's a good sign!)  The leftovers weren't quite as good as the tortillas were really mushy but it was still enjoyable!  This is being added to my favorites list!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These had a very good flavor (only my second Mexican recipe attempt).  Mine had no heat whatsoever so I might add a jalapeno next time.  I would also like to test these with the white Mexican melting cheese, but they are great just as they are!

Amazing! One of the best things I ever made. Pan frying the tortillas gived the dish a terrific texture. I saved time by boiling rotisserie chicken breasts in chicken broth and then shredding. I also put the whole dish under the broiler to melt the cheese. Serve this with fresh salsa and hot sauce and you will be happy, happy!

This recipe tastes AMAZING, but it is a lot of work!  I know it says 40 minutes at the top... but just blackening and letting the peppers sit is almost an hour.  We really love this recipe, but it takes a long time for us to prepare and we would not consider it "easy" to make.  It's not something you throw together!  But again, it is absolutely delicious when we do make it (every 3-6 months or so). =)

These were good, I did everything exactly as stated and normally my husband doesn't really like poblanos aside from rellenos but the addition of the sour cream reduced the extreme poblano taste that usually goes along with green sauce. My husband didn't even realize the green sauce was made from poblano!! Definitely a keeper, gracias a ti Olga!

Very Good! My family likes very spicy food so I tossed in a couple of super hot home grown chiles that are similar to chile de arbol or japanese chile peppers. Serranos would work well also. I topped them with the melted cheese, chopped onion and slices of avocados. I will surely make this again very soon.

i followed this recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised. the poblano sauce is not spicy but flavorful. if there was something i would change i would make a little more of it. i (unlike several reviewers) fried the tortillas and they were my favorite part so i would recommend it! And I stuck the pan in the oven for about 10 min to melt the cheese. Truthfully I didn't love it (it wasn't bad, just not amazing) but my husband did so I went ahead and gave it 5stars.

This is one of the best enchilada recipes I've ever tried.  Better than most restaurants!  I add a roasted jalapeno for extra heat and reduce the chicken broth to 1/2 cup to make the sauce a bit thicker.  I don't fry my corn tortillas to save on fat and throw it in the oven at 350 to get the cheese bubbly.

Let me preface with saying that I am not a cook by any means and yes, I am a gringa. My husband is very much a Mexican and has enjoyed home cooked meals his entire life. All of our marriage I have lived in his mother's cooking shadow. Tonight I made this and his reaction made my night/week/year: "add this to the favorites list; I like these way better than my mothers"  SCORE!! Thank you thank you for such a yummy recipe!!

made this 3xs, twice with chicken, once with pork. Everyone loved it.  My changes: 1. roasted the meat (season the meat before roasting) instead if boiling. 2. Instead of chicken broth, I used the broth from the bottom of pan (from roasting) 3. For a more depth of flavor, I Sautéed 1 onion, small handful of corn, 3 cloves garlic, and 2 tomatoes w salt pepper and pinch of cumin. 4. When assembly: dip the tortilla (yes I fried mine) into the poblano sauce, sprinkle Mexican blend cheese, add some meat, add small spoon of the sautéed veggies. Fold and place in a greased baking dish. Thank put more cheese on top and bake till bubbly and almost golden brown. I serve with fresh cilantro and lime wedge. Hubby said he would pay $14 for a plate of this at a restaurant. So yummy!  Yes it takes a lot of time but sooo worth it. Also side note: depending where your poblanos a are from, sometimes they are hotter than normal. Make sure you taste your poblano sauce - if the heat is not hot enough dice jalepenos and ad to the sauce. (I had to do that once)

OMG. The best. I changed some things. I used a rotisserie chicken shredded it, man was it flavorfull and so moist. I roasted fresh garlic in the oven with the poblanos although I think it would still be good without that. I used store bought chicken stock and placed that, a couple if my roasted garlic cloves, a piece of the onion, the sour cream and blended until smooth. I stuffed with Chicken and chedder cheese instead of the mozzarella rolled, placed on plate topped it with more cheese and put it in the microwave to melt cheese.  The drizzled more sauce over them. Sauce was very spicey so made each member of the family according to their taste, using less sauce on some and saturated my husband's, as he love's spicy food. This is a most try. I will be making again and again.

We liked these. I added cilantro to the sauce, and wish I had added a little more of something, but I'm not sure what. Probably a jalapeno in the roasting stage; I think I'm comparing these to a recipe I tried with jalapenos and cilantro. In any event, I think I should've done the meat in the crockpot, because that's totally effortless and I'm all about effortless. I really liked this recipe's explanations for roasting peppers and also for frying the tortillas. Mine did not tear, and I have to attribute that to the hot oil treatment and not the sauce, because I had more filling than I needed, so I had to get out 2 more tortillas, and just dip them in the sauce, and those did tear. Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it :)

Huge hit!! Even my 3 year old liked it. I didn't fry the tortillas. Instead I covered both sides in the chili sauce and filled with chicken, then I put them in a pan, covered with a little more sauce and a combo of mozzarella and pepper jack. Then I baked at 350* until the cheese was starting to brown. Next time I will increase the amount of chicken I cooked though, I thought they needed a little more. Definitely will be adding this to my cookbook! Thanks Olga! (Side note: I ended up having some sauce left over because I double the recipe. I saved it and we had it with some tortilla chips the next day. Yummy!!)

Love this recipe!  I noticed that a lot of people think that it is bland- it must have to do with the flavor of the poblanos.  We used 8 small poblanos from our garden, and it was spicy and wonderful.  After reading another review, we added a Mexican crumbly white cheese (Queso Cojita) to the mozzarella, and it was delicious.  The cooking method for the chicken really seemed to  make a difference.  Chicken breast can be dry, but this was moist and flavorful.

Very nice recipe.  I give it four stars because I didn't think the flavor was popping out.  I fire roasted my pabalno's over the gas flame on my stove top, put them in a paper bag for a few minutes and peeled the skin off with paper towels, removed the seeds for wonderful tasting pablanos.

While I did not follow recipe exactly, it got me on the right path, and the end result was excellent! My husband loved them, and my kids too. I purchased shredded chicken from HEB (fully cooked) which made that process easier! I also used a caldo de pollo boullion cube, in 2c of H2O w/ minced garlic, did the poblanos exactly like recipe, mixed w/ 1c of broth. Definitely softened tortillas (corn) in oil (best part)! Then I scooped in chicken and mexican style shredded cheese and poured sauce over topped w/ more chicken and cheese, placed in oven for 30min at 350. Next time though, I will make sauce a bit thinner consistency. Born and raised in SA, TX, and now living in RGV, TX; I have to say that these are awesome. I have never liked chicken enchiladas at restaurants. My fav is cheese enchiladas. As sides, I made some arroz and frijoles....great meal! Gracias Olga!

I did not have pablano chilies so I used a can of green chilies, and this was still amazing!  I did use a bit more cheese than called for and melted it in the oven for 5 minutes, but other than that I did not change a thing.  I can't wait to try this with the pablanos!

This was pretty good! We used flour tortillas instead of corn. We bought a rotisserie chicken from the store and just shredded it. We boiled the water, garlic, onion, and bouillon and took out a cup, then tossed in the chicken and let it hang out in the mix while the peppers cooled. We tossed some spices (red pepper, chipotle) into the chicken mixture. We'll definitely add more next time, I think the chicken needed more flavor. I think the sauce was missing something but I can't put my finger on it. It was delicious but needed a little something more.

I tried to do a "healthy" shortcut by not pre-frying the tortillas and they fell apart and were a little soggy as a result. Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly- the flavor was wonderful!

holy guacamole!!!  this was so good!  i added about a teaspoon of tarragon and some cilantro to the boiling chicken mixture, and i roasted a red bell pepper along with the poblanos just for fun.  i used Monterey Jack cheese instead of mozzerella because it just seemed a little more authentic.  next time i would use more cheese, probably some inside the actual enchilada as well as on top.  the kids and husband ate it up quick!  one word of warning, if you are roasting the peppers on a gas range this meal is a pretty good bit of work.

these enchiladas were by far the best mexican food i've tested yet. I thought the name of the recipe was very cute too. The flavors of "a la gringa" all come together in one chile enchiladas to blow your tasting sensors away. I give this recipe a great review.

Enchiladas are my favorite Mexican dish. I have never tasted before enchiladas with poblanos chiles. The blend of sour cream, roasted poblanos chiles and the chicken broth give the sauce an exquisite flavor. I don't like very spicy food, but this are just perfect forme.

Made this for dinner. Delicious!! Not too spicy, good flavor. I substituted the sour cream with plain Greek yogurt and instead of frying the tortillas I rolled the enchiladas and baked in over for 15 minutes and broiled until cheese toasted. Served with rice and beans. Yum!

These were really good. I followed the recipe, but I think next time I will add some cheese on top of the chicken before rolling. I also made my own tortillas. I will definately make this again. Thanks Olga.

Wish they had more stars for this recipe!  The only changes I made were: 1) added a chipotle pepper and a little bit of the adobo sauce they're canned in to the poblano sauce mixture to spice it up a little, 2) as another reviewer suggested, shredded the chicken instead of slicing it, and 3) put the enchiladas in a baking dish and baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes before topping with the cheese.  I have now abandoned the chicken enchilada recipe I've been using for years - THIS is now my go-to enchilada recipe!  Also, because it's easier and requires less clean-up, I used my immersion blender for the sauce, and it worked really great.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is one of those "Don't Talk To Me I'm Eating" recipes!  These are delicious!!  I was originally going to add a jalapeno to the sauce, as other reviewers have recommended, because we like spicy food.  I'm so glad that I tasted the sauce before I did this!  It was very spicy already and after I added the chicken stock mixture it was absolutely perfect.  When I put the sauce on the stove top I did have to add some seasoning salt, but that was about it.  I didn't fry the tortillas, just threw them in the oven for 13 mins at 350F.  I didn't have any onion, so I had to leave those out, but those would be a fantastic addition, can't wait to add them in next time.  These are delicious, try them, you will not be sorry!!

This was so delicious I offered to take my husband's plate back and bring him a nice tuna fish sandwich.

I did sub low-fat cheddar for the mozzarella (because that's what I had on hand).

Absolutely excellent, and I have never even made enchiladas before. Also, I served this with unfried chile relleno, used queso fresco instead of mozzarella (because I didn't have any, but it turned out great), and I shredded the chicken which made it so perfectly delicious.

This was very good although I tweaked it a little. I boiled the chicken with the ingredients (also threw in a whole serrano chile, gives wonderful flavor without the heat). Then shredded the chicken and simmered it with half the sauce for about 30 minutes. Also used Jack cheese in place of mozzarella. Homemade rice and beans and it was a really nice mexican dinner, the family loved it!

Perhaps my expectations were too high for this recipe after reading the reviews!  The chicken didn't have enough flavor so it made the whole enchilada kinda bland with the exception of the sourcream sauce - very yummy.  Overall though I'd say they were OK.  Must admit this was the first time I have actually cooked enchiladas so maybe I am to blame instead of the recipe!

this recipe was just what i was looking for! i used 6 or 7 chiles from my garden because they seem so much smaller than the ones i have bought from the store in the past. i didn't think it would be sooo spicy! but the flavour was still superb! gracias

I like this recipie but I thought it would be a little more flavorful. I did changed it some though. I added some cream cheese to the sauce to thicken it, Used flour tortillas and didnt fry or dip in sauce. I shredded the chicken and stuffed the tortillas with cheese as well as sauce and chicken then baked. I also used 3 cups chicken broth vs water and omitted the bullion.

Great A+++ recipe!!! However to satisfy all ages, I decided to use 4 TOMATILLOS & 1 sliced up pepper for spice with a little cilantro instead of the poblano chiles- it was delicious!! I also did not fry the tortillas, however you risk breaking the shell when you roll them up. So maybe I'll try frying them next time. Absolutely authentic, and delicious- 5 stars all the way! ;)

Our family loves great mexican food and have made some fantastic recipes for many years but this just didn't do it for us. It was lots of work for a just okay taste. My husband lived in southern California for several years and really loves Mexican food and asked me NOT to make this recipe again. My daughter and I agreed that the taste didn't merit a second time either.

These were awesome. I cooked up extra peppers and added thin strips with the chicken before I rolled them up. In addition to the mozzy I used Jack and cheddar. Served with rice and refried beans and we agreed we couldn't have gotten a better meal at a restaurant!

Fantastic enchiladas!!!! My grocery store didn't have poblano chiles, so I used green bell peppers which turned out to be a nice alternative. Sprinkled some toasted pine nuts on the top to add a bit of crunch. Amazing reviews all around!

What do you do with leftover turkey? Make this, Obviously; ) I grabbed the bag of tortilla chips and layered the whole shabang. Cream cheese, hatch chilies, gr.onion & cilantro went in the blender. Salt n pepper and Lots of cheese brought this to an Excellent result! Love these !! Thank you Olga.

This recipe was delicious. I replaced one of the poblano peppers with a habenaro to give it a lot more kick. Also instead of throwing away the liquid, I ate it as a soup. It tasted like a delicious French onion soup.

This was good but seemed to be missing something.  The sauce is really good (needs more salt) but thought it needed somthing else.  I might make again and play around with it a little.

I made this today for Hubby. He loved it. Not sure why the recipe would say discard the rest of the cooking broth. It seemed like such a waste. While my Chicken was cooling and Chilies were roasting I cooked down the broth to concentrate the flavors. I also used Jack cheese instead of Mozzarella. Cilantro and green onion for garnish..Yummy. Next time I'll add a couple of Roasted Jalapeno's with the Poblanos.

Excellent!! I made a cheese enchilada version of this recipe with a few other adjustments. I roasted the poblanos as directed, then pureed them in a blender with plain greek yogurt (substituted for sour cream)and low sodium organic chicken broth. I put the poblano sauce in a skillet to simmer on LOW for ten minutes, stirring in 1 tsp sea salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp cumin. I sauteed chopped purple onion with 2 cloves of minced garlic on medium heat until the onions were soft, then set these aside. If you want to add  heat to this recipe, I think you could add two seeded and chopped jalapenos to the saute. 


For the filling, I combined 2 cups white cheddar with 2 cups sharp orange cheddar. I prepared white corn tortillas as directed, very lightly frying them corn oil. I dipped the a tortilla liberally in the poblano sauce, then filled with a small amount of the onion/garlic sautee and a liberal amount of cheese. Roll and place the seam down in glass pan. Pour remaining poblano sauce over the top of enchiladas, and liberally sprinkle with cheese. Top with one to two tablespoons of chopped cilantro. Bake at 375 for 15 to 20 minutes until cheese is melted. I wouldn't try to brown these as I don't want to scorch the yogurt-based poblano sauce.

One of my favorite recipes I've found on here so far. The only change I've made is sometimes, instead of using just the poblano chiles, I've substituted one poblano for some Serrano or Jalapenos chiles to kick up the spice level.

Absolutely wonderful! I love poblanos, so I knew these would rock. The only change I made was not dipping the tortillas. I always steam tortillas in the microwave and that makes them perfectly pliable without having to do all that dipping. These were great and we will definitely add them to our regular enchilada rotation!

I found this a little bland overall... the poblano & sour cream mixture didn't turn out very tasty and the mozzarella cheese didn't help. The dipping in the sauce - I don't quite get that too because the sauce didn't stick much to the tortilla. Next time, I would use cheddar instead and I would just roll the tortillas up, sprinkle some cheese on top, pour the poblano mixture on top and top with remaining cheddar. I might bake it a little just to melt the cheese.

not a fan!  After reading the recipe I was so excited as they sounded delicious.  I was wrong!  The chicken was bland and lacked flavor.  I made these as directed but I did not fry the tortillas 1st.  I baked for 10 minutes after assembled to melt the cheese.  I love the flavor of poblano peppers but the sauce was also bland and lacking flavor.  No one in my family liked these

I am eating the leftovers from last nite while I am writing this and they are even better the next day! I must say I couldn't find poblanos so I used a can of green chilis instead. I also used 4 chicken hindquarters that I did in the crock-pot and used the broth they made. I also used Monteray Jack cheese and assembled them like a lasagna instead of rolling them. They were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!  I can't wait to try them with the poblanos! I will take these OVER and Over! Thanks Olga!

Finally I have found an authentic Enchilada recipe with all the flavors that I remember from living in Oklahoma!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious  however, it was not quite the texture that I had wanted.  It was crunchier and I wanted the rolled tortilla to be firm but not crunchy.(Just because that is the texture I remember).  On my second attempt I fried the tortilla until soft then added some of the pepper sauce into the chicken before rolling.  The sauce needs to be heated first  to warm the chicken. I put the rolled enchiladas in a 9 x 13 baking pan then heated the sauce until it was hot.  At this point I added more of the chicken stock to get the sauce to the desired consistancy.  Then I poured the hot sauce over the enchilada's and topped with the cheese.  Do not bake, that is the secret.  Serve immediatly.

These were very, very good. Step 1 says to reserve one cup of the chicken stock and discard the rest, but don't. I got about 2-1/2 cups of stock, so I froze what I did not use rather than discarding it. Next time I make these, I can use some leftover deli chicken and a cup of the frozen stock, cutting the time it takes to make these way down.

The boiled chicken seemed a little dry, so next time I might try shredding it instead of slicing it.

Frying the tortillas was strange; even in a very hot pan, the tortillas just seemed to absorb the oil. Next time I may try non-stick cooking spray.

As others have done, I put the finished enchiladas under the broiler for a couple of minutes (watching them carefully) to melt the cheese. Muy delicioso!

Made this last night.  Used 4 poblanos, and it was extremely spicy! If gringa means what I think it means, then this is too spicy for one! I forgot to add the shredded cheese, and I'm actually glad I did, because it would have been a waste.  The recipe has potential, so I'll need to sit down and think about where it needs to be tweaked.

This recipe is delicious!  I used regular canned chilies and used the corn tortillas to make a lasagna or casserole of sorts.  It was my first time making enchiladas and I was amazed that it actually tasted like ... enchiladas!

Delicious - made these for a party and everyone loved them. I like them with verde sauce and white cheese the best.

I have mixed feelings about this, overall the flavor was good but my tortillas totally fell apart and were soggy.  I did fry the tortillas as instructed, but it just turned into enchilada mush.  I will try again with different corn tortillas next time and see if that improves the dish.

I made this recipe for a Cinco de Mayo happy hour at an active seniors building where I am the assistant manager and my very picky seniors loved them! Excellent flavor without being overly spicy. Thanks for a great recipe!

The poblano chilies added an amazing flavor to these. I grew up in Texas and now live in Seattle and the 'mexican' food just isn't the same.  These were authentic and restaurant quality.  I did make some changes:  In a separate bowl, I shredded the chicken & added sauce & cheese to make a thick paste.  I tried using oil to soften the tortillas and that took way too long for me so I just threw them in the microwave with a wet paper towel on top.  Roll chicken mixture in tortillas and place seam side down in baking pan.  Add remaining sauce and cheese on top.  AMAZING!!!  It was kind of bland for my family's liking so next time I will try roasting a jalapeno with the poblanos or adding a can of fire roasted diced green chiles to the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe - this one is a keeper FOR SURE!!!

Wow, what great flavor these had but had to tweak to get it not so spicey.  For the sauce I used 4 pablanos and 8oz of free-fat sour cream, and the 1 cup of chicken stock.  To that, in the blender, I added 1/2 can fat-reduced cream of chicken soup, 1 can of drained sweet corn and 1/2 can of tomato sauce.  This made it so that it was mild enough to serve to my very picky husband.  I put a non-stick skillet on HI and sprayed each corn tortilla with Pam so that they were tough enough to roll with the chicken.  I also put a bit of cheese inside each enchilada.  Placed in a 9x13 casserole and poured a little more sauce over and covered in cheese.  Baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  I served it with Mexican Rice II from this site.  Made a delicious meal.  I put all my tweaks so if the 4 pablanos are too hot for you just follow the recommends I put in this review.

This was delicious! I couldn't find poblano chilis, so I used jalapenos -- gave the dish quite a kick! I also popped this in the oven for about 5 minutes after they were rolled to let the cheese melt.

these were really good! loved the flavor of the sauce. i usually make enchiladas verdes, with tomatillos. where i'm at, tomatillos arent cheap! this was definitely AS good as that recipe, for much less money and effort. i did a couple things different.  i didnt use chicken, i used shrimp. so i didnt need to cook the chicken in the onion, garlic, broth mixture. i just put a cup of broth with some garlic and onion in my blender at the same time as the sour cream and peppers. used flour tortillas, and didnt fry them in oil, just warmed them up in the micro. i mixed up a little corn/blackbean salsa to go on the insides.  2 chopped plum tomatoes 3/4 can of sweet corn 1/2 can black beans 1/2 chopped small red onion 1 teaspoon lime juice salt and pepper mix all ingredients.  put this, cheddar cheese, and sauce on the insides of the enchiladas with the shrimp, topped them with more sauce and cheese, baked for 30 min.  perfect!

I finally made these enchiladas!  I saved them to my recipe box back in 2006 and was always afraid to make them because the recipe seemed complicated.  I am sure glad I tried it.  These taste really excellent.  I boiled the chicken and instead of cutting it into strips as suggested in the recipe, I shredded it.   Also, after reading some reviews, I was tempted to skip frying the tortillas.  I went with my instinct and followed the recipe on that one.  I carefully fried each tortilla in the olive oil for just a bit.  If you fry them too long they will get too crunchy. Everything else I did by the recipe and these were super delicious.  Oh, I had a bit of jack cheese I wanted to use, so I shredded it and had enough to put some jack in with the shredded chicken for five of the ten enchiladas!   Thanks, Olga!  These are wonderful!

I browned the chicken, sauted the onion and garlic, used flour tortillas instead of corn.  Oh yeah, monterey jack cheese instead of mozzarella.  Heated it in oven 359 degees for 20 minutes.  Tasted good--really liked the sauce.  Flour tortilla got a little mushey.

The taste of these enchiladas was great. The poblanos gives it a nice peppery flavor.
I skipped the tortilla frying stage and that gave me hard time when I started rolling the tortillas, they were breaking apart. But I kept going and covered the whole thing with sauce and cheese and put in the oven like other reviewers had suggested.
I will make this again following the recipe the the T.

My family loved this and requested it again less than a week later! I was a little concerned when I tasted the sauce that it would be too spicy, but once it was cooked on the enchiladas it was just right! Even my heat-avoiding daughter had seconds. Thanks!

Extremely good and probably the best chicken enchiladas I have ever had and that says a lot for someone living in Texas. It is a bit intensive but well worth the effort. I added some avocados and pureed it with the sauce. I found it complimented the poblano flavor very well.

Great recipe. This smelled so good while cooking! I couldn't find any poblanos so I had to use jalapenos. The prep is lengthy but not difficult. Yummy and so spicy. My DH loved this!

I really liked these enchiladas and the heat was just right for me.  However, my husband felt they were a little bland (he likes more than just heat).  Because of the prep work and his less than stellar review I cannot give this 5 stars.

These were pretty tasty.  I have never worked with fresh poblano peppers before and it was quite a process.  I had to use my broiler, and being paranoid about them being too charred, I sat right in front of the oven for about 15 minutes turning them.  My hand and arm got pretty hot before I thought to grab an oven mitt. LOL

We also used flour tortillas instead of the corn as we don't like corn tortilla and they came out great.

We used fat free sour cream and microwaved the tortillas first to soften instead of frying (we are on diets) and added some cumin. 
i thought this was awesome, but I would definetly make the sauce a day ahead. When we ate it the next day it was even better!!

I tried this recipe on a whim, and I'm so glad that I did!  It's delicious.  I put my own little spin on it, though- instead of boneless chicken breasts, I used split breasts on the bone.  I browned the chicken before I added the water, onions, ect.  I then deboned and shredded the chicken.  I fried flour tortillas, stuffed them, covered with the remaining sauce, covered with cheese, then baked for 25 minutes. What a great meal.  Another recipe to add to my arsenal!

This was awesome! I actually made this for the first time for dinner guests...big risk!!! It was incredible, they loved it. I couldn't get the poblano chiles so just used canned hot jalepinos...it was still great! Thank you!

I made this over the weekend for a Mexican night we had with  friends.  The poblano was very good.  It had a little kick, but not too much for the tamer palettes.  I baked the tortillas to get them soft instead of frying. I also put them in a baking dish as a previous poster suggested. The only thing I would change is I would add a little salt or pepper to the chicken.  The chicken was very bland.

Thanks, this recipe rocks!  I reduced the fat a bit by using low fat/fat free cheese and sour cream, and subbing cooking spray for the olive oil.  It was delicious; next time I'll make a double batch and freeze!

I used only 3 poblano peppers and found the heat to be quite perfect--spicy but not too intense.       Also, I had no chicken boulion at all, so I just ommited it and thought the broth had enough flavor from the chicken and garlic and onions.  This dish got raved reviews from all who tried it.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

These were very good.  However, I think they would have been much better if I didn't need a drink between every bite!  Be forewarned... the heat of poblanos vary greatly!  Even though I am very aware of this fact, I kind of ignored it due to other reviewers pointing out the lack of heat and spiciness.  I followed the recipe exactly (well, I did broil for a few minutes after adding cheese) and came up with a very hot and spicy dish- and we do like spicy.  Next time I will definately test the heat before adding all four poblanos.

This were among the best enchiladas I've had. It has the right amount of kick without overpowering the the other flavors. A great dish as a casserole to serve at reunions.

these were so good! I made a few changes, and even my husband from Mexico approved! to the sauce I added jalapeños, cilantro, salt, pepper, and lime juice. and to the chicken, after it was boiled and cut up, I added some chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper to taste and cooked it for 5 minutes in a hot, oiled pan with a little bit of the chicken broth. good base of a recipe, just needs more flavor. I will make these again!

Yummy. As others suggested I added 2% Mexican Cheese over top and broiled. I also added a minced jalapeno to the sauce when simmered but could have been blended with the sour cream and poblanos. Def will make again.

I love the sauce.  The chicken was a little bland for me.  I felt like it needed a little more flavor.  Next time, in order to save time, I am going to use a rotisserie chicken and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.

This was a really good recipe. I really enjoyed the flavor that the roasted poblano peppers give the sauce. The reason I only gave this four stars, though, is that I think it needs to be baked at the end for a little while. By the time I was done assembling the last enchilada, the first ones were cold, and I think baking them would not only keep them hot, but bring the flavors together at the end.

This was excellent - texture, flavor, everything tasted like authentic perfect enchiladas. I did brown the tortillas up a bit before rolling them and added corn, zucchini, and red bell peppers to the enchiladas that I separately sautéed. Also browned the chicken a bit first as other people have recommended. Although the poblano sauce was amazing, it did lack a little spice (could have been due to weak poblanos) so I plan to add a jalapeño to the mix next time. Overall thought I’m thrilled to have found a wonderful enchilada recipe!

This is a really great filling. We did the filling and sauce as written, but we used flour tortillas and just wrapped the filling and put it in the oven for a few mins. Delish!

These were really good. One of the best enchiladas I've eaten.  However, I did make some significant changes that I think really helped. 1st, instead of tossing out the remaining broth, I skimmed out the onions and set aside, later adding a spoonful to the chicken filling inside the enchilada when wrapping. I also enhanced the filling by a generous sprinkling of mazarella cheese, so the filling was moister and a little creamy from the cheese.  The other change was the last step not mentioned in this recipe..., I covered the enchiladas with foil and put into a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 minutes. Then, them out of the oven, and topped the enchiladas with shredded sharp cheddar cheese, then covered back with foil for 10 more minutes. The final touch was to remove the foil and continue baking until the cheese on top just started to turn brown.  So Good!!!

This was delicious. I followed some of the advice in some of the reviews and made the following changes: used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water and bouillon (because I just don't keep boullion on hand), added about 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp white pepper, was pretty generous with the salt and some chopped cilantro to the blender of sauce. After assembled I threw it in the oven under a broiler for a few minutes because I like my cheese browned and a bit crispy on enchiladas. Great flavor without being too spicy so it was good even for the little ones.

I made this with 3 Poblano Peppers I grew in my Southern Ohio garden and it was GOOD!  Next time I used 4 Poblano from WalMart....Geesh!  TOO HOT but my brother-in-law LOVED the heat!  The 3rd time I used just 2 from WalMart, used 1.5 C Sour Creme and 2 C of the broth and simmered until slightly thickened.  Everything else was the same (we prefer the small flour tortillas & Mexican Blend shredded cheese) and I sprayed the cooking pan and put them in the oven at 350F for about 15 min till the cheese melted... That works for my husband and me.  Just spicy enough.  The extra sauce was GREAT over fried chicken & mashed potatoes the next day.  Going to make a lot and freeze

This recipe is exceptional! Won the approval of my Mexican food loving hubby. Will definitely make again. I did use the peppers I had on hand which were Anahiems.  I washed, split and deseeded them before roasting them under the broiler to make my life easier since they were being pureed anyway. Also, for the folks who thought the sauce was bland - kick it up a notch with the spices you like - I roasted a jalapeno and added it seeds and all with some chili powder,  cayenne and a pinch of cinnamon and paprika. I used a turkey tenderloin that I cooked in the crockpot with a packet of my favorite seasonings. As you are frying and dipping the tortillas if you lay them  up against the edge of your baking dish half way and then put your stuff in the middle it makes rolling them easier since you only have to fold the one side over and roll.  This was fun and sooo worth it!  I served it with Mexican rice, homemade refried beans and a garden salad. Thank you for the recipe!!!

After reading the other reviews, I added chopped cilantro, green chilies, additional salt and pepper, and red pepper flakes.  I placed some of the sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, added the enchiladas and poured the remaining sauce over them and sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top.  Baked at 325 for about 30 minutes.  Excellent!!!!

I have to say, I love this recipe!  The sauce is just heavenly; creamy, smooth, with just the right amount of heat to please even those who don't like spicy foods.  I added in several shakes of jalapeno hot sauce (the green one)  just for personal preference .
I am learning to make my own corn tortillas, and last night was my first time making them.  I don't recommend it!   lol   It was a hot mess and held up the whole process.   NEXT TIME, I will still make my own but I won't the mistake of making them while trying to put the dish together :-)  I will make them ahead and have them ready beforehand :-)

I will be making this one again for sure!  I just wish I had more of that sauce!  So good :-)

I am really glad I saw this recipe, as doing Poblano peppers was a first for me. I read many reviews to get an idea of the savoriness, plus other people's likes and dislikes. I gleaned favorite additions of some, mixed with my tastes, and I thought it came out pretty great. I made two dishes of it, and gave one to some family, everyone liked it. To address the issue of the sauce being "too thin", I first sauteed the onion & garlic (heavier on the garlic than what was called for), then added it to my blender, with the reduced broth that came from my roasted chicken, the juices from the onion/garlic mixed with added chicken broth, plus the roasted peppers and pureed it. I poured it into the saucepan, adding roasted garlic, jalapeno slices, 2 cans of green chilies, and slowly added the sour cream, (I didn't use all the original recipe called for). As for spices, I used salt, little bl pepper, smoked paprika, a dash of celery seed, cumin & garlic granules. I added chicken broth along the way, as needed. Enter shredded chicken (I set to the side of the pan, so I could dip my crisped Sprouted grain corn tortillas into it prior to filling). Just about everything I used was organic, minus the peppers. I filled each enchilada with mix, pepper jack cheese, and extra sauce. Covered with a Mexican cheese blend(which I would change to something more flavorful next time), and baked in wither a 375' or 400' oven for about 12 minutes. Yum! Other change next time...I would add more poblanos.

I was skeptical of boiling chicken and the overall simplicity of the recipe but overall this is pretty yummy. Mild in flavor but tastes like what it is, chicken and poblanos. I did use a mexican blend cheese as that is all I had onhand and went with flour tortillas because those are my preference. Maybe the corn tortillas would have added some flavor? I could definitely see myself making this again to find out! You will have to bake a few minutes to get that wonderful melty cheese on top though.

Delicious! I used freshly roasted poblanos from my local farmers market. I used my slow cooker to cook the chicken with broth, onions, garlic and cumin. I also used flour tortillas since that's what I had on hand. I added the onions from slow cooker to enchiladas. I also subbed white cheddar for the mozzarella. Lots of flavor and easy recipe!

I, like others, was very skeptical about this recipe.  Well, I made it and added cilantro, salt, and cumin to the sauce, as well as added cheese to the chicken mixture and this was freaking awesome! I did it casserole style, pouring the sauce over the enchiladas and added cheese, which I would not recommend.  It does make the tortillas soggy, but the taste was fabulous!  My kids devoured  it, too!  Thanks! Making again in a few days, but assembling according to directions.

Excellent! I needed a recipe to use the many poblano peppers I had from my garden. My peppers were hot to say the least. Wow, this came out so flavorful. I can't wait to eat the left overs. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. Avocado on the side.

Leftover chicken transformed in minutes! Love this recipe. As I live in a rural area, I didn't have poblano chilies. I blended the sauce and slowly added chopped jalapeno until I felt the level of spice was good for my family. I also added cilantro as recommended by others. 
Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great base recipe. I added some lime juice to the chicken broth, some sliced olives to the enchiladas, as well as some cheese. I used grated "Mexican Blend" cheese from the store, rather than the mozzarella. I also added a small, seeded jalapeno to the sauce to add more spice. Finally, I baked them for about 20 minutes at 350 to meld and melt things. My husband said that they were a "keeper" recipe, and went back looking for more.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe up the construction. What I did was I used the 8" tortillas and put the chicken in with a healthy sprinkle of cheese and rolled them tight. Laid them seam side down in a 9x13 baking dish. I then poured all the poblano sauce over it, then the cheese. Heated it at 350 for 20 minutes. Added cilantro and done. Very tasty. Will make again!

first off, this recipe takes longer than 40 minutes to make, so that should be changed. I followed this recipe exactly except I added jalapeños to the mixer. (we had fresh and we like spicy). Let me also say I am NOT a fan of sour cream but the sauce ended up being pretty good. I also did not use mozzarella, I used monterrey jack and chedder. overall, hubs doesn't like enchiladas but he liked these! so add your own peppers and don't use mozzarella :)

Delicious!  I made a mess of the kitchen, but it was worth it.  I added a couple of de-seeded and de-membraned jalapenos to the sauce prior to blending it, so there was another dimension of flavor.  Easy, flavorful, fun, and turned out better than I expected.  Smiles around the table!

These turned out really good! I used 1 pablano and 6 cubanelles b/c I don't like too much heat. The only thing I would change is to use more chicken stock in the puree, as it turned out a bit thick (perhaps I used too many chiles). I heated them in a 400 degree oven until the cheese melted and I served it with rice. Will definitely make this again, adding some beans as a side dish. I might also try swiss cheese instead of mozzarella, as I like enchiladas suiza.

It wasn't "bad" but it wasn't good either.  I was going along through the recipe, and the more I looked at it, the more I realized that it wasn't going to have enough flavor.  So after I took the chicken out of the stock and shredded it, I simmered it according to the package of a store bought burrito seasoning (at half-strength, giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt).  Even after that, the dish was very bland.  The greatest pleasure I got out of it was the large amount of cheese I added to it.  The poblano sauce is what got me really excited about this dish, but it just didn't get it done.  I would make it again, but I would change so much to the recipe that it wouldn't even be the same one.

The recipe is delicious! However, I used 3 chicken breast, and added another cup of water to the pot. I like a lot of sauce and s.o I used 2.5 cups of the chicken broth mixture in with the blender. All in all it was great. I like a little kick but not too spicy and my husband likes it really hot. This was perfect for me but could've been a little hotter. Though we did use anehieim peppers because there were no pablano. Add more peppers!!! and it could use a little more sauce.

YUM! I tweaked the sauce a bit as well since I didn't have some things on hand. I did boil the chicken, but instead of bullion cubes, I just boiled in chicken broth and added the onion & garlic, but also added an extra pinch of salt, onion powder and  cumin to taste. I didn't have poblanos on hand so I used Anaheim chiles...roasted those with a Serrano pepper (only used half the serrano). In the blender I added half added bunch of cilantro, some extra garlic, onion, and pinch of salt. Will definitely be making again, thanks!!

I love enchiladas, but my husband is not a fan of them. I decided to give this recipe a try because we had never cooked with poblanos and we both LOVED them! He even took the leftovers for lunch the next day. They were not spicy at all, but the flavor was superb. I'm a little lazy, so I just threw 2 chicken breasts in the crock pot in the morning and covered them with chicken broth, then shredded them that afternoon for the enchiladas. I used the broth from the crockpot for the sauce. I also made them in a baking dish so I could broil them before serving to melt the cheese. YUM!! Will definitely make again.

So good! This was my first time making enchiladas (but definitely not my first time eating them!) and everyone loved them. I used red El Pato sauce since that's what I had, and just mixed the sauce instead of blending it but it turned out just wonderful. I know making changes doesn't mean I used this same recipe but I know it would be just as good if not better if I had followed the directions. Thank you, Olga!!!

These were, hands down, the best enchiladas I've ever had. I followed the recipe with only a few changes. I used monterey jack cheese instead of mozzarella ( cause it's what I had on hand ), I sprinkled just a little bit of cheese in each enchilada and lastly, I threw them in the oven at 350 for about 10 mins for the cheese to melt. They turned out amazing! I prepped the chilis and chicken in the morning, so that everything was ready to throw together by dinner time. I also did not disgard the remainder of the broth sauce. I brought it to a simmer and threw in black beans, cumin and cilantro leaves...an excellent side dish for this excellent meal! :)

Having been fed real mexican food, from different States in Mexico, I have been cooking Authentic Mexican for 58 years or so. I made exactly from the recipe.  This recipe had SUCH promise, but lacked a bit of taste.  Yes, it was Gringo, & since my mouth can no longer take the fire,  Poblano chiles are the mildest of the chiles and the only ones I will touch.  In fact, A/R has one of the BEST articles on chile peppers I've ever seen!!!  Take a gander when you can.  However good the pepper is, (& Poblanos, IMO are the most flavorful), it cannot be expected to "carry" the recipe.   When I make this again (& I will, it's a great start, so I'm very greatful to Olga for submitting it!), I will add a dash of cumin to the chicken & the sauce.  I would also add cilantro seeds or diced to the sauce, as well as salt to taste.  Believe me folks, you gotta taste as you go, you're enjoyment (& your family's) depends on it !  I cook mostly in a.m., so I have room to eat what I've prepared!!!  Another thing I would do, is use Monterey Jack cheese, or a cheddar, colby, jack mix (often called "Mexican Mix" for good reason.  These are cheeses that are indigenous to Mexican recipe's in all the states of Mexico.  Also, they are cheeses with a much more robust flavor than Mozzerella.  Oh, one more thing, I never use boullion cubes.  Too much Sodium (way more than a dash of salt to taste, not to mention preservatives.  Make stock, freeze it & use it!!!  HTH!!!  & Blessings!!!

I have made these twice now and they are absolutely fantastic! There are a lot of steps and it takes much longer to make than listed, but totally worth it! We travel to Mexico often and eat Mexican food a minimum of three times per week. I used the chicken breast of a Costco rotisserie chicken to cut time. They are tender and juicy. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of the bullion, chopped up the chicken first and simmered for 10 minutes for the flavor.  I don't think the sauce needs to be simmered for 10 minutes after blending it because I put them in the oven for 25 minutes to heat through and melt the cheese like you would with most other enchiladas anyway.

Excellent recipe! Very smooth and tasty. I added a few things, like tomatillo and cilantro to the sauce before blenderizing it.  I included some of the onion and garlic along with the broth. Also, I rolled and topped the enchiladas (used flour tortillas, since I had on hand) with sauce and cheese and baked in the oven for 25-30 minutes. Super yummy, and I am definitely saving this one!

I think the ingredients are wonderful and the set up and instructions are perfect, until...
There is no mention of the oven temperature or time of baking included in this recipe. It just stops with the sprinkling of cheese on top.
So, in essence, this recipe is useless to me. Sigh!

Absolutely a keeper whole family really loved this dish. Thought the pepper roasting would be tough but super easy . Only change was I added about 3/4 cup jack cheese soooo yummy and much more tasty than recipes with chicken soup or other prepared enchilada sauces . I cooked this at 375 for 20 minutes came out perfect just wish I would have taken a picture for u was pretty too !

Very, very delicious! The simple flavors make this dish very tasty and so flavorful. If u love the taste of chile poblanos, then this recipe is truly for you taste buds! The dish had a bit of a kick but so worth while to cook it. Thank you for sharing another way of preparing green enchiladas.

I think Mozzarella might not be the best choice for the cheese.  I definitely  have to try something else.  This recipe ended up being on the dry side with no tweaks.

Thanks for this recipe. I noticed some people said this wasn't spicy enough. Leave in some seeds. It's all about the poblanos and how spicy they are.

The poblanos give great flavor but the texture bothered me a bit. Maybe I didn't get the corn tortillas crispy enough before stuffing them? I also think they'd benefit from some green onion and maybe a more authentic Mexican cheese.

BLAND. Definitely needs salt. Didn't like frying the tortillas first. Would rather roll and then bake in a dish but with a different cheese. Did I say BLAND?

My BF doesn't doesn't like spicy foods and he loved it. I thought it a bit too bland. After roasting and de-seeding, there was little heat in the peppers. Next time I may add a jalapeno, also it needed salt & pepper.

Good start to a wonderful recipe. Add cilantro, 1-2 fresh jalepenos (depending on how hot you like), no mozzarella cheese, added taco seasoned mixed cheese, and grilled chicken versus boiling chicken in chicken stock (fresher taste). The first batch (adding no additional ingredients) was very bland but adding listed ingredients above and emerils essence the recipe turned out very good.

Great  super simple recipe!  I was a little dubious at first at how thin mine turned out but it was perfect.  I have always softened my tortillas in a little hot oil before rolling them.  This time was no different.  This will be going into my rotation.  OH!  I didn't taste my poblanos beforehand which was a mistake.  These were unusually hot.  No mind blowing just hotter than I expected.

I love roasted poblanos and was looking for more ways to use them. This was pretty tasty, and I agree with everyone that the chicken preparation was particularly tasty. However, the dish as a whole was missing something for me. Next time I think I will try adding jalapeño and chopped cilantro to the poblano sauce for a little kick.

This is the closest recipe I have found to my favorite enchiladas at our local restaurant!  I will definitely make it again.  For my personal convenience and flavor, I will use 4 cans of chilis and include cheese inside the tortilla with the chicken (leftover chicken would also be perfect).  I happened to have pepper jack cheese and the addition of the jalepeno flavored cheese was phenomenol.  I also baked the dish because it felt like a natural step--and I was also a little nervous about the green sauce.  I shouldn't have been though.  The creamy, chili flavor was outstanding!  As a matter of fact, I was wishing there was more sauce, and then wondered if baking had made the dish drier than it should have been.  I think next time I will just broil the cheese to brown it, as opposed to baking it.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!! 

I just happened to be making this recipe two days before Thanksgiving, and will use the "Turkey Brine" recipe here by Sheri Gailey.  The brine for the turkey recipe starts out the same way as the enchilada recipe, so after I removed the liquid I needed for the enchilada's, I added sea salt to the remaining broth to use for the turkey.  Double bonus!

This was OUTSTANDING!  I don't know how the previous reviewer thought these could be bland.  I like VERY spicy and the 4 poblano's give it just the right kick!  I've tried numerous enchilada recipes from this site and this is hands down the best!  I also follow a previous reviewer's suggestion and once I roll my enchiladas, I pour the remaining sauce over the top, top with cheese and bake for 25 minutes.  PERFECTION!

I don't know what I did wrong as I followed the recipe to a "t".  This was the most bland thing of enchiladas I have ever made!  I went out and bought everything to make for my husbands birthday and it was such a dud!  I was very dissappointed as were everyone else that ate with us.  Too bland.

very well made, the texture of the enchilada was well conceived, and the softnes of the chicken mixed well with the softness of the tortilla.

I loved these enchiladas.  Easy to make but even easier to scarf down.  And they don't burn your mouth.  Olga?  Great job.

Not bad, if you don't like any heat, but it didn't do anything for me. I should have used more poblano chiles and it's better with monterey jack cheese, I think.
