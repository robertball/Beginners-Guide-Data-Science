I'm giving this recipe five stars for now.  I just wanted to put up a review that included this warning : Check your box of cake mix! The recipe calls for a 9 oz. box, when the standard cake mix box is twice that.  I made these rolls last night and they were definately not dinner rolls.  They are way too sweet and cakey.  I used the whole box.  I was prepared to leave a scathing review, but realized I messed it up.  I will try this recipe again and leave a new review.  BE AWARE OF THE CAKE MIX AMOUNTS!  These are great sweet rolls to have with coffee though.

Just made this in my bread machine using the "dough only" cycle. I used yeast, water, cake mix and bread flour. I omitted poppy seeds, egg and margarine steps.  After the dough cycle was done I cut dough into 24 peices and let rise on cookie sheet and baked at 350 till light brown.  YUMMY!  Light and Fluffy! The cake mix did the trick! Everyone loved them!

Read through all of the reviews prior to making the rolls and made sure to use 1/2 of a regular sized box of cake mix.  Used bread flour instead of all purpose flour and doubled the yeast used.  Family and friends over for dinner loved them.  Will make again.  Saved other half of the cake mix and made another batch the next weekend.  In future might just go ahead and mix the second half with the flour and bag for ease in making another batch.

this recipe saved me!  Had intended to do overnight rolls and forgot to make the dough last night.  Had a box of "Jiffy" brand yellow mix in the cupboard intending to make a cinnamon roll recipe so that worked perfectly since it is 9 oz exactly.  No where in the recipe did it say to knead the dough.  I did knead the dough until it had the sheen.  This is a sticky dough but I just kept flouring my board.  I let it rise in a warmed oven for 1 hour and rose nicely double in bulk.  The dough will appear too sticky to be able to roll into anything but I just floured my board and rolling pin and this dough was actually beautiful to work with. Used the pizza cutter to slice into sections and it did not stick to the board at all. Cut each round into 12 sections and used real butter instead of margarine.  They are a sweeter roll but not sickening.  They baked up like a picture.  did some poppy seed, sesame seed, and left some plain.  buttery good.  Really no need to use butter.  The only thing I would suggest is a bit of salt added to the second cup of flour when making the dough.  Salt added directly to yeast mixture can kill the yeast.  Thanks for this nice recipe with a surprisingly lovely dough to work with.

If I had not made them, I would not have believed how good this were and I believe in making breads from scratch! Sweet but not too sweet for dinner. Don't let the dough get too stiff - keep it slightly sticky. I just made regular rolls - no rolling into crescents. Did great!!

Tried these twice and they failed miserably both times although I am a very experienced baker. They didn't rise and were much too sweet. (Looking back at this and more recent reviews, I realize that I mistakenly used a LARGE box of cake mix. Thank you to another reviewer for pointing that out! The original submitter needed to be more explicit in specifying that a substandard size of mix was being used. I'll bet lots of us were fooled by not reading carefully. Sorry!

Not a stellar recipe, especially if you use a cake mix like Duncan Hines yellow cake mix, which has a high vanilla/coconutish flavor.  If using this brand mix, I strongly recommend that you halve the cake mix and add additional "bread" flour as needed.

These are WONDERFUL!  I mixed mine in the bread machine on the dough setting (because I'm lazy, lol). My only issue was that I had to add more flour than called for (maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup extra). the dough was so fluffy and a real joy to work with. I cut each circle into 12 wedges, so I got 24 rolls out of this recipe. I didn't brush them w/ anything before baking, but as soon as they came out of the oven, I brushed 1/2 of them w/ melted butter and sprinkled some w/ poppy seeds. The other 1/2, I allowed to cool and froze them for another time. I couldn't wait until dinner to try these, so I did....they are light, fluffy and delicious w/ great flavor...not too sweet, just right! To those that had issue, it seems to be that the size cake mix was off...I used a 9oz. box of Jiffy yellow cake mix...PERFECT! These will def be made again and again...they couldn't be simplier~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made these and let my Kitchen Aid mixer do all the work.  This dough is so wonderful to work with.  I did add 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour because the dough was too sticky.  For me, it  took the dough about 1 1/2 hours to double in size. I did not brush with egg whites or sprinkle with poppy seeds only with butter when I removed them from the oven. There are two things I will do differently next time:  First, I will add salt to the dough during the mixing process and secondly, I will divide the dough into thirds because by only dividing in half, the rolls are much bigger than I prefer.  Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe.

Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by these. I only made them because I was low on flour. I had a problem because I while proofing the yeast I started finding the rest of my ingredients and low and behold it wasn't a yellow cake mix I had, it was a golden vanilla. Well I used it anyway and they turned out great. The only problem I had was I thought I could serve the left over rolls for out next dinner, but no such luck they were gone by lunch. I have to experiment with other cake mixes now. Thanks Ruthey for an excellent and different recipe.

My family enjoyed these rolls for dinner.  They were sweet, but not overbearing.  They were also dense, but I personally enjoy hearty breads.  I did let them rise about 1 1/2 hours for the first rising and 1 hour for the second.  I baked them about 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour, which may have contributed to the more successful outcome I achieved versus other commenters.  I also shaped them as buns, rather than crescents, and tucked them into a round cake pan.  I might try adding a second package of yeast next time...and there will be a next time.  Edited to add: I figured out my problem with the longer rising time... the recipe calls for 9 oz cake mix, all the reguarl ones at the store are 18 oz.  I made this again using only 1/2 the box and there was no problem.  RDI!  These are now the official holiday rolls at my house.

Absolutely fabulous!  I put the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  When it is finished, I just roll them up and bake them.  I do use bread flour, which makes a more tender roll.  My friends all want the recipe.

I really like these.  I use pillsburry yellow cake mix and used 1 1/4c and these turn out really good. They are slightly sweet, fluffy and delicious.  I love these--they are quick and easy.

Wow, this is a delicious yeast roll.  I am new to using yeast, so rather than stirring and letting it rise, I threw all the ingredients in to the bread machine on the manual cycle.  Once it was done, I worked in another 1/2 cup of flour to get the dough to roll out in the circle.  I used a 9 oz. Jiffy (R) cake mix in this recipe.  I did not brush with the egg white or use the poppy seeds.  Just formed in crescent shape and baked.  Family loved them.

My sister recommended this to me.  I didn't do the egg whites or poppy seeds because I'm boring, but I LOVED them.  I made them for Thanksgiving and couldn't stop eating them.  I ate leftovers for breakfast the next day too.  Easy to make too!

I love this recipe. I do a little catering on the side and made these for a few events, always to rave reviews. I'm getting married in a few weeks and am looking forward to using this recipe again for the reception.

This recipe gets 5 stars from me because it's easy. Turns out each time no matter what I do with it.  I've braided it, made sub sandwiches out of it and rolls. It turns out pretty and most importantly it tastes great!

I'm so glad I read some comments before starting this, because I may not have noticed it only calls for 9 ounces of cake mix! Whew! These rolls turned out so good, rose up HUGE, and were so easy! Definitely a five star recipe for me that I will make again!

So normally I like to cook from scratch...I saw the word "cake mix" and was turned off but then I read a few reviews and said why not. I made these rolls and I loved them as did my Husband!
I did change a couple of things .. 1. I used a bread maker 2. I used 2 packs of yeast and 3. I used Butter and ommited the poppy seeds. YUMMMY STILL!!

I followed the recipe exactly and my family found the rolls adequate.  Nothing to rave about.  I let them rise a bit before putting them in the oven and they looked beautiful.

This is a keeper.  The rolls came out soft, a little cake mix taste, but not too much.  My kids just love it and it was so easy to do.

This was the first time I attempted to bake any kind of bread. I followed the directions exactly, (at least I think I did) however I don’t think they came out correctly. I let the yeast sit for 10 minutes then added the other ingredients stirred it then I didn’t know what to beat it with so I just did it with my hands. Then put the dough in the lightly oiled bowl and turned it to oil and put it in warm place for over an hour and it didn’t rise very much. Then when they were all rolled and on sheet tray i let them sit for 30 minutes and they didn’t rise much either. They were really dense. My husband liked them though.

I have tried to make these 3 times...each time was a fail!  All 3 times the rolls didn’t rise and tasted super sweet.  I really thought these would be a bit  more like regular savory dinner yeast rolls.  I probably will have to try and make them again only because it will make me crazy until I get them right!!

Meh, not bad but not that great either.   I had a hard time finding the right size cake mix.  They were sweet, but could have had a better flavor.

We love these rolls! I used two packages of yeast instead of one,I used Sesame Seeds instead of Poppy, and cut each circle into 12 instead of 10.  I froze one batch all rolled up and ready to rise and bake for our company on Thanksgiving!  We will definately be serving these rolls alot!

This reminded me of mexican sweet bread it was good very easy.  I wish I would have added a little more yeast.  It didn't rise as much as I thought it would.  I made it as regular rolls next time I will follow the recipe.  It was good

Great for a family!
These are truly moist and soft.
I make them for the teachers at my school and they dissapear as soon as they hit the table.
