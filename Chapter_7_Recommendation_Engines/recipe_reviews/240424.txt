I don't like turnip so just used extra carrots in the pot.  This was such a hit my husband asked me to make it every week.  Served with instant stuffing the first time, today it will be over rice.  Loved it and very easy to make.  You can substitute sour cream for the yogurt if you want.

This was a very easy and tasty meal to make. I added 2 potatoes and used a bit more yogurt (about 9oz) and everyone loved it.

Good base for a recipe, but a bit plain for my taste. I used all carrots and added garlic powder, rubbed sage, and an extra bay leaf and it was great.

Substituted potatoes for turnips, added mushrooms. Then used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. The meat fell apart.

IT was very simple to make.  I ate it with and without rice but preferred it with the rice.

I found this to be quite good and super easy to make. The only changes I made were to substitute celery for turnips because I forgot to get a turnip and I added garlic powder to the chicken. Next time I will use a turnip or parsnips, use the garlic powder, and probably use boneless chicken to make it easier. Can't wait to try again!

This dish makes  lots of vegs. to go around and does need more  seasoning. We made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts.

Not the most appealing dish, but it tastes good.  I replace parsnips for the turnip.
