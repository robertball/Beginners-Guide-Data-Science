We enjoyed this!  I used homemade mango chutney and elected to cook the broccoli with carrots and add the dressing to them.  There are a lot of flavors here, but somehow, they all work together.Too bad Pam Anderson doesn't contribute anymore, her recipes are usually quite good.

This was good but what is the dressing in step #2?  Not on ingredients list?
