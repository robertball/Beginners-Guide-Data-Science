This is delicious! I just used ground pork and ground beef (lean since the pork is so greasy) and cut out the crushed red pepper because I didn't think the kids would like it. We all LOVED it!

If you haven't made this, you have no idea what fabulous flavors you're missing!  This is really good!  I usually make it with just the ground beef and ground pork.  The recipe itself is very simple to put together. And it tastes even better than it smells.  Combine all this deliciousness between the always fantastic garlic bread, and your first bite will result in big eyes and a long mmmmmmmmmm!  Believe me, this is just plain good eating.
