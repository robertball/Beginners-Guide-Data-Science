I've made this dish twice.  The 1st time i followed the recipe.  The second time i used round steak, and cooked in broth all day in the slow cooker.  Then followed the recipe.  This made it a quick & delicious dinner the second time around.  The round steak was very tender & juicy.

It was easy to make and tasted great!  Instead of beef and gravy I used chicken and chicken stock to make it even more healthy still tasted excellent.  I will make this again.

This was an ok start, but it needed a lot of tweaking. First I added a lot more soy sauce; also garlic powder, a couple of beef bouillon cubes, freshly ground pepper, and some Chinese Five Spice Powder. I also threw in some bean sprouts that needed using up. This was ok, but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  This turned out really good.  Next time I might use some more spice, but it was good just the way it was.  I'd definitely recommend it as a quick, easy, not horrible for you meal!
