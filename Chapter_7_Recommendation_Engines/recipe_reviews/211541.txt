Delicious, with wonderfully  complex but balanced flavors. All the ingredients and seasonings come together and mellow into something uniquely its own. I loved the ingredients that went into this stew, loved making it, and Hubs and I certainly loved eating it! As all cooks should do, I seasoned this "to taste," upping the cumin to probably a couple of teaspoons, substituting Mexican oregano for the marjoram (have never used it!), backing off on the pepper to probably a teaspoon (you can always add it but you can't take it back out!) and subbing two, fresh poblano peppers for the canned green chilies - first, because I love 'em and second, because they're easier on Hubs' sensitive innards.  Wanting to make sure the meat was good and tender, I simmered this for a good hour and a half - and it WAS buttery tender.  This is intensely aromatic as it cooks, letting you know that what you're in for will be well worth the wait! I served this over plain white rice, with a dollop of sour cream, but I could easily see this wrapped in a tortilla too (that will be coming up with the leftovers!)

What a great recipe!  I've made this several times and love it.  One tip - I find that it tastes even better the day after it's made. When I make it for guests, I make it the day beforehand which not only makes it taste better, but also makes the day of entertaining much easier.  I serve it with cilantro rice and tortillas.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.... Thanks so much for submitting!!

I added a few touches, and it's now on my monthley menu. 4 cloves garlic, 1 tsp. marjoram, 1 tsp. Mexican oregano, 2 tsps. cumin, made the sour cream and cilantro sprigs optional as I have dried for the stew, and served it w/ frijoles con queso (refried beans and cheese) heated, and warm flour tortillas.

Yum! I used 2lbs of pork instead of 3, chicken broth instead of water, and oregano instead of marjoram, since that's what I had on hand, didn't change the rest of the amounts called for, and the recipe came out a tiny bit tart, but the supporting flavors were perfect. The tartness is due to the tomatillos I'm sure, which I'm not used to cooking with. Still, so delicious! I will definitely make this again. I used 2 tsp cumin, and since I had a 4oz can of diced green chiles, I left a little bit of seeds in when I diced up the jalapenos. I served this on top of rice, with tortillas on the side and our leftovers will be burritos. So good! Thank you for a wonderful recipe. **Update: I made this with 2 cans of diced tomatoes, drained (instead of tomatillos) and it was delicious! Highly recommended!

Excellent recipe!! I followed the recipe except for the cumin...I added 2 tsp, and the diced green chilis...I used 2 seven oz. cans. I also used 3 chopped serranos instead of the Jalapenos.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  It turned out amazingly well.  Stir it quite often while simmering or it will stick to the bottom of your pot.  Thanks for posting Plato.   We will enjoy this stew over and over again.

This chili verde was just ok. I followed the recipe pretty closely but was just not blown away. My husband is mexican and he wasn't that impressed with this either. I will make this again but will use another recipe I found. Next time I make this I will roast the tomatillos and garlic and then blend it along with the cilantro.  We like our food spicy and this wasn't spicy enough for us.

I made this for my girlfriend last night and she loved it but next time we do this, we are going to try adding an extra can of green chiles to the recipes for extra bite and absolutely add jalapeno. As toppers if putting on tortillas: Diced Tomato Diced Green Onion Shredded Monterrey Jack Cheese Steamed Rice Sour Cream Lime Wedges to squeeze on finished product

This was great.  I had never really had anything like it before.  It was more work than the types of things I normally cook, but it was well worth it.

Muy Delicioso!  Use 5-6 tomatillos if you likey the tomatillos (and don't wanna guess how many makes 2 cups).  Plus, use the juice from the green chiles can and cut the water back to a splash (~1/4 cup).

My husband is Mexican as well and he loved this!  I made this much more soupy by adding equal portions of water and chicken broth, I also added hominy and served with tostadas.  So good, thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe!  I omitted the salt because I cook low-sodium.  It was a little too hot for me, so I will probably reduce the pepper next time.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!  Update: I have made this many times and truly love it.  If I can't get low sodium pork at the store, I make this with chicken.  Not sure it's authentic Mexican that way, but it tastes great!

I have been making this dish for years and thought I had the best recipe out there. I made this recipe tonight to see what it was about. I have to say it beats mine hands down and is pretty well spot on to the recipe my favorite local Hispanic joint makes. I didn't change a thing and it turned out superb! It was fantastic as a taco as well!

Made this dish this weekend for a mexican family new years eve dinner.  We had leftover pork shoulder from a previous meal and was so glad to find this stew recipe.  I followed the recipe to the tee and it was GREAT as is.. would not change a thing!!!  I served this with some mexican fried rice, beans and warm tortillas.  Everyone at the table went for seconds! Will definitely be making this again.

This is yummy. Seems simple enough, but chopping took a lot of time. I have a chopper that helped with it. We had it on tortillas and instead of a whole roast, I used shredded chicken just because I had it already cooked.

Very tasty Chile Verde. I used pork shoulder/butt, removed all the fat and cooked it in a dutch oven. I wound up with pork cracklings that I lightly salted. I ate them all right then and there!! I fried the pork cubes in the lard that rendered, making the pork extremely tasty since I fried it in its own fat. I used 2 cups chicken broth and half marjoram and half oregano and simmered it for 1 1/2 hours. Delicious. I will make this again.

I cut the black pepper to 2/3, because I thought it must be a mistake (that it should have said teaspoon not Tablespoon). I wish I had done 1/3 instead. Even cutting back the Jalepeno also to half, it was too spicy/peppery for my family. And, we are not big salt fans, but, this did need more than a pinch to us (So, I added about 1/2 tsp). I chose to serve it over Saffron rice with fresh chopped tomatoes, and cooked greens with canneloni beans. Next time (it was flavorful enough to try again), I will try with less pepper and cut the meat into strips instead of cubes and use as a tortilla filling. Thank you for a great recipe that I just need to adjust for my (haha.. whimpy) family.

Needs much more salt than the recipe calls for, but is great! I didn't find this to be a very effortful recipe; the worst part was trimming all the fat of the pork. I used this as my entry at a workplace Mexican-themed cook off, and it took first for taste, even without garnishes. Thanks!

Wonderful and easy, I can't believe how good this was. Too much pepper, though, I think 1 tsp would be fine. Making enchiladas with the leftovers.

My husband loved this! He said that it could easily pass for a dish at our favorite Mexican restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly, except I let the whole dish simmer in the crock pot on low for about 5 hours. The flavors combined perfectly and the meat was so tender it just melted! I served with mexican rice and warm tortillas for a great meal!

Great recipe!  Wanted to use for burrito filling so did not add water but did add chopped fresh pablanos and anahiems.  Placed all in crock pot after browning pork and let cook for a couple of hours.  My family loved it.

This is a delicious & forgiving recipe. Flavor gets better overnight so it's easy to make a day ahead. Sometimes I have used fresh tomatillos when in season but in the winter I substitute pureed tomatillos & the seasonings that I froze from when they were ripe.
A go to favorite at our house.

Fantastic! The only change I made was to add an extra cup of water in the beginning.  I let this simmer for about 2 hours and served it over white rice.  Will defiantly make again!

This was phenomenal. Took a risk and served it for company the first time I made it. It was a big hit!  I did add diced potatoes as I had seen that in another green chile stew recipe and I think it may have cut the heat just a little. Certainly not necessary though. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was phenomenal! I loved the flavors! Tomatillos are great - but I don't find enough recipes to use them often. Very easy to make - I did everything on the stovetop, but I could see adapting it to use a crockpot. --First time, we ate this over plain Basmati rice and really enjoyed it like that. Then we ate if for dinner in tortillas, taco style... what a hit that was! This would be a great crowd-pleasing recipe, especially in the wintertime!

Yes, yes yes! This may be my standby recipe for green chile! It takes less than 1 hour 50. I cooked it for 45 and it only took me about 1/2 hour to prep! I altered the recipe for the ingredients I had and it was  still great! I did not miss the cilantro that I did not have. I put in oregano and it was yummy all the same. Even my picky boyfriend loved it! Yeah! I will save so much money with this recipe because it is better than my favorite mexican restaurant!

Yummmmo!!  This was awesome!  I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out amazing.  Used the meat mixture for burro filling, then used the sauce to put over the top, with some shredded cheese and baked it just long enough to melt the cheese.  mmmmm . . . good!

We love this recipe!  I have developed a Boston Butt roast (pork shoulder) ritual.  I bake or boil the roast on day 1 and serve with potatoes/carrots/onions.  Day 2 I use the leftovers to make this fabulous recipe.  Day 3 I use THOSE leftovers to fill burritos.  Yummy X3!

BF and I really enjoyed this. I had some leftover pork chops that I needed to use up. They were already breaded so I just seasoned them with the cumin and warmed them in the dutch oven. While the pork was browning I cut up fresh green chilies and used these instead of the canned. After the pork was warmed up, I removed it from the pan and added a little more olive oil then tossed in the jalapenos, fresh green chilies, and onion all at once - sauteed until everything was tender, then added the chopped tomatillos, garlic, cilantro, marjoram and extra cumin. I also used broth instead of water and added an extra 1/2 cup because I wanted more of a soup texture. There are some wonderful flavors layered on top of each other in here and I will make this one again. I ate mine with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro for garnish.

This was amazing, and even better the next day. My only note would be that I doubled the liquid (used pork stock instead of water), and it was still really thick.
**UPDATE** I used this same recipe to make enchilada sauce (Left out the pork/flour, doubled liquid, put the whole thing through the blender once it was done simmering). Outstanding.

The flavor was pretty good but the texture was unappealing! the breading feel off of the pork and left the soup looking like oatmeal. It looked so bad that we could barley eat it. We think it would be ok without the breading tho.

FAN-tactic!! Used fresh roasted pablanos and Anaheim peppers instead of the canned chilies (2 of each). Served over white rice with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips.  Thanks for sharing this totally delicious recipe.

Fabulous!  My hubby's favorite dish at our Mexican Restaurant is carne de puerco.  He thinks this is just as good if not better.  My only change would be to cut the pork into bite size cubes so that it works better w/tortillas.

I Made this last night and it was good last night I'd say a 4 1/2 star, Then we got it out today and made enchiladas out of it... 5 stars! It was so GOOD!Fabulous! Letting the flavors infuse overnight really made the difference between 4 and 5 star. I did make some changes that I do recommend. The first thing to change is not to use canned chilies. Instead Use 3 to 4 freshly roasted and peeled Anaheim chili peppers(mild ones), I also added 1 extra clove garlic that was roasted. I think this change will make your recipe worth making this. I also used Serrano peppers instead of Jalapenos, because I personally like their flavor better, but that probably doesn't matter too much. also added an extra 1/2 tsp. seasoned salt to the flour mixture. I doubled the bouillon and water, because I wanted more sauce for enchiladas. I made sure to add all the extra flour from dredging the meat to the pot before cooking it all together, so the extra sauce was still sauce and not soup.

I followed this recipe exactly, other than adding about 1/2 cup more water, as when I added the first cup it wasn't covering everything so I was worried the pork would dry out.  Also, I simmered mine for closer to 2 hours, just because of the timing of when we would be serving it, and the meat just melted in our mouths.  My husband LOVED this recipe as well, and I will definitely be making this again and again!  Thanks for the amazing recipe!  My husband asked me to double it next time as there weren't enough leftovers for his liking!!

Mmmm - I've tried three recipes from this site for chile verde & this one is now my fave! For the most part used ingredients as directed except started with pork that had already been smoked, subbed 2 fresh roasted poblano's instead of the canned green chiles, mexican oregano for the marjoram & chicken broth for the water...super simple, easy to put together & just darn good chile verde!

Wow...I have never written a review for a recipe but I have to with this one.  The flavors were wonderful so was the aroma.  I can't wait to have the leftovers.  Even my picky eaters gobbled it up.  My husband has requested to add this to our monthly menu.  Thank you for sharing.

This goes to 11!  Good Lord Almighty!  This is the best thing I've ever made...seriously (at least my family said so, anyway, even over my beef stroganoff).  I've had this at various Tex-Mex restaurants and they do not even come remotely close.  I made only a few tiny changes out of necessity.  I used chicken broth instead of water at the cook's suggestion.  I only had one teaspoon of marjoram left to use, so I threw in a teaspoon of Mexican oregano.  It was taking so long to tenderize the pork so I added a another 1/3 cup or so of chicken stock to keep it from completely drying out.  It kept reducing even more and still not tender enough (yes, this was even on low heat).  I then added about 1/2 cup of dry white wine.  Took at least 1 hr 15 mins if not an hour and a half to cook the pork down to fork tenderness.  The wine added acidity to an already wonderfully rich dish.  I served this over white rice.  This is going straight to the front of the Mexican/Tex-Mex recipes in my personal cookbook.  Amen to you PLATO!  You rock!!

I've made this recipe several times. It's so savory and rich. I just recently substituted lamb for the pork. Fabulous! I'm going to try it with chicken next. Will have to try substituting chicken broth for the water. Thanks for sharing this!

I will let the other reviewers pen the technical reasons why this recipe is great tasting. When I would eat at mexican restaurants  I would only order meals with chile verde as the protein.  No longer!  This meal is great and I can make it at home any time I want!  Great stuff. I just quadruple the jalapenos for a wee bit mire heat.

Used jarred salsa verde instead of tomatillos; simmered for ~3 hrs which made the pork very, very tender. A consistent pleaser!!

Oh yeah!  My son-in-law is latino and he raved over this dish as did everyone else in the family, including my 2 year old granddaughter who ate a whole bowl of it.  Only changes I made were to use a can of tomatillos instead of the fresh ones and to add a cube of chicken bouillon at the end of the cooking time.  This is now elevated to a family favoriate and will be served regularly at family gatherings.

I absolutely LOVED this dish.  One big change I made out of necessity- I had to use salsa verde in lieu of tomatillos.  Since the salsa verde already had jalapenos, it was a pretty good sub.  I also added oregano, and used chicken broth instead of water.  Also, if you are using fresh cilantro, add it towards the end of cooking, it allows for a brighter cilantro taste.  It's a good rule of culinary thumb to add dry spices at the beginning, and fresh at the end.  I really suggest you eat this dish on top of cilantro lime rice, or with tortillas. Also it really does age well, so you can make this dish a day before, and let it sit in the fridge, lets the flavors mellow and really mix.

This is a great recipe. The texture & flavors were really nice. I baked mine in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours instead of on the stove. Everyone raved over the tenderness of the pork & how flavorful the whole dish was! A winner all around. I served it with fajita style veggies & Spanish rice.

WooHoo but this one was a winner!  It's like most stews that you can "add a little, subtract a little" and find a balance that suits you/your family.  We like things fairly spicy so added some cayenne (to taste).  Also threw in a diced potato and will try a can of hominy next time.......and there WILL be a next time.  Perfect for a cold winter day.  Thanx Plato!

This is awesome!  Had no marjoram so substituted with Mexican oregano.  Used chicken stock in place of water; otherwise followed exactly.  Served over brown rice.  It's amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yum! Huge hit with everyone even my 4 year old. I did use chicken stock instead of water. And I cut the tomatillos in half and put them in the food processor along with half of the cooked onion. So good.

I needed a Mexican recipe I'd never made before for my weekend challenge, and this one caught my eye.  I had almost everything on hand, but tomatillos aren't available here at the best of times, definitely not winter.  I substituted a jar of tomatillo salsa, a small can of diced tomatoes, and reduced the water to half a cup to replace the fresh tomatillos.  I served it on a bed of rice.

It both smelled and tasted great.  It might have been my weekend challenge, but this is one we'll be doing again!

Instead of canned, I used fresh hatch green chilies (roasted and peeled) because they were available to me. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was  good.

Cooked many times, rock solid recipe. Often use a lot more tomatillo's, just cut in half. They mush down a lot. Careful not to burn the bottom! Forgot cilantro many times... Still great. White rice, sour cream, tortilla chips.  Epic.

Husband said it was the best "chili verde" he has ever had! I followed the recipe exactly, but used Oregano 1: 2 ratio as a substitute for marjoram since I didn't have Marjoram on hand. I didn't feel like simmering it on the stovetop, so I threw everything into a crockpot and then went horseback riding and both my husband and I came home to a delicious meal. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I thought is was a great base, I made this according to the recipe exactly. Next time I will be adding some lime juice and tequila to brighten the flavors and some more jalapeno for heat. It was just a bit bland but all in all it was really yummy. Thanks so much this  is one of my husbands favorites

Wow! So good. I get salsa verde guisado when I eat in Mexican restaurants. I've been wanting to make it at home, this recipe tastes exactly like the ones I get at restaurants. I am very impressed. Prep work takes the longest in this recipe. I tried chopping up the onion, etc in a chopper.... Didn't work. Had to chop everything by hand so it took forever. I like this dish a little spicier than two jalapeños so I added whole seeded jalapeños. Serve with warm tortillas and sour cream. Yum!

This stew was a winner at my house!  My husband smoked a pork shoulder and I needed something to do with the leftovers.  I didn't have any tomatillos on hand so I doubled the chiles and used a few green tomatoes and just added the spices straight to the pot.  It was excellent and I can't wait to make it totally to the recipe.  Thank you so much!

This so very very good! Highly recommend! One day, I had used chicken broth in place of water, and put some habanero peppers in there for a little while and took them out after about 5 min. It was sooooo good and had a little bit of kick in the end taste. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great recipe! 
I doubled the garlic (cuz yeah).
I kept the veins and seeds of one of the jalapeños.
I used a lot more oil.
I added a quarter cube of veggie bullion with the water.
I added a tsp. of MSG.
I. Loved. This.

When my daughter gave me 5 tomatillos from her organic produce box, I looked for a recipe.  This was a hit with everyone in the extended family.  I bought 3 1lb packages of boneless sirloin ribs and cut them up instead of the boneless pork shoulder.  I needed more olive oil for browning all the meat and half of the flour and spices were left over and I tossed them.  I made the stew the day before serving it.  Prep took me more than 25 minutes as it took longer to brown the meat in small batches.  This was a mild sauce.  If you would want it spicer, add more jalapeños or spicer ones.

Wow-this was an authentic restaurant quality dish! I loved it! I did cut back on the black pepper and only used one pepper, since we aren’t much for heat here, but the flavor was still great. The pork was nice and tender, and I served it over white rice. A dollop of sour cream, and a bonus of fresh off the cob corn, and it made for a hearty meal.

Very good recipe, however, I did season the pork before searing.  I added garlic, cumin, salt, peper, cayenne, onion powder and dried cilantro. Then I seared.
Also, I didn't have any canned tomatillas, so I used green chile enchilada sauce. we used the leftovers for quesadillas.

This was pretty fabulous! I doubled the cumin. Doubled the green Chile. Added a couple chicken bullion cubes. I did not flour the pork, threw everything into the crockpot. I added 4 small diced potatoes. Will definitely make again!

Not what I expected, rather bland flavor. I doubled the cumin and garlic as other reviewers suggested and used chicken broth instead of water. Included the liquid from canned chilies. Browned meat well and added to slow cooker with all ingredients and cooked on low for 5 hours. Was very tender and I didn’t have to worry about the cooking process. Maybe as others suggested it will taste better the next day, but if I ever make it again I will use 4 jalapeños instead of 2 or maybe use a habanero and a can of Rotel. Now I’m going to eat this with some fresh Pico de Gallo and habanero lime hot sauce.

Made as directed. Delicious! I was uncertain how much heat the jalapeños would add. They were hot in the prep stage but in their cooked state they were not.  I’ll make this again and again!

I discovered the guisados recipe in search of  a way to use some extra tomatillos from making enchilada sauce. I will be buying a lot more tomatillos as a result! My husband and I both loved it, both the first night and as leftovers for lunch the following week. In fact, like a good chili, the guisados probably got better over time.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of using an extra lean pork tenderloin. I also may have upped the spices a bit, as I didn't measure particularly closely, and used diced chilies that I couldn't really drain. Thus, I added the liquid as well. I let it stew for at least an hour and served it over rice, as the delicious liquid needed something to soak it up.  Do yourself a favor and make this!

Love this dish and so did the husband.  I did use about 5 cups of water to get more juice and I put my dutch oven in a 250 degree oven and let it bake for about 3 hours.  I served it with a mound of rice.  This is a keeper recipe and I will make this many more times again.

this is great! I followed the recipe exactly except I made it in my Instant Pot.  I followed the directions, browning the country pork rib meat and onions in the Instant Pot. I did not add any water, only the liquid from the can of chilies. I then pressure cooked it on high for 30 minutes, natural release for 10 minutes. After tasting it as is, we ate it right away with brown rice and choices of extra cilantro, avocado, cheese and a squeeze of lime. it was wonderful, but I bet it will be even better tomorrow. I served it with cut up jicama and carrots.

I have made this recipe several times.  I found it originally while looking for ways to use the tomatillos from my garden.   I make it exactly as written and love it.

Instead of 1 cup water, I used 1/2 cup of leftover pulled pork juice/jelly and 1/2 c water. I used the quesadilla maker to warm up the tortillas, cut them in wedges. Delicious!

There's only two of us and only a small piece of pork left from another recipe so I adjusted the ingredients from this recipe accordingly and served it over quinwa as there was no rice in the house. The make-do turned out awesome and I will definatly make this again with more pork.

I didn’t have any green chiles so I substituted red pepper and sautéed them with the onions.  After I browned the meat I cooked everything  in the Instant Pot for 45 minutes instead of on the stovetop. The meat fell apart. My family loved it.

This was a really great recipe but I did make several alterations.  By following others advice,  I used 3 poblano peppers and 2 jalapenos.  I roasted them under the broiler with the tomatillos for a bit, and peeled them before adding to the stew.  I also added a jar of HERDEZ Tomatillo Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce for more liquid and substituted chicken broth for the water.

My additions were to add a can of hominy and a can of white beans.  Probably not authentic, but it really added some depth to it.   Simmered for over an hour until the pork was tender and juicy.  

Served with the rice, the whole family thought it was a keeper!!

LOVED this.  Made it almost exactly as written, but did sub oregano for marjoram.  Was my first time cooking with (or even buying) tomatillos, but they stood up nicely to the other flavors.  Family loved this.  Served over rice for kids and quinoa for a low-carb option.  This made it to the regular rotation after one try.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!  Only changes I made was to roast the tomatillos in oven to add additional depth to the flavor and add my own (from the garden) roasted chilies and onions.  My husband, who is super picky, said this was very good and would like to have me make it again.....this is RARE!

We really liked it a lot! My bf is from Mexico, so we have gotten spoiled with her delicious food. I get really nervous when it comes to cooking Mexican inspired dishes. Without a doubt this is a winner! I can't wait until the next pot luck. Super impressive meal, yet easy as can be. And I had never even cooked with a Tomitillo  before. You will love this.

This was an awesome recipe!  The only ingredient change I made was I used 2 tbsp+2 tsp dried cilantro as I didn't have fresh.  

I converted this recipe to be prepared in the Instant Pot pressure cooker.  I used the saute mode to do the first two steps - brown the pork cubes in batches and then the onion.  Then I put the rest in the IP, and selected the pressure cook meat/stew setting default of 35 minutes.   When the timer went off, I let it natural release on the keep warm setting and it took about 20 minutes to release pressure.   

It came out extremely tender and flavorful!

Love this recipe. I've made this about 5-6 times now and it gets better each time. The pork is so tender and the flavor is amazing! I never really cooked with tomatillos before and was unsure if I'd like this dish, but my son made it the first time and my family  was hooked! It's the perfect blend of spices and the tangy flavor is perfect. Some people don't like cilantro, so it can be left out but I wouldn't recommend it. Try this and you'll be hooked too!

Made this recipe literally as written and all I can say is DELICIOUS! Great meld of flavors, but definitely pay attention to the prep and cook time of this recipe or risk a very later dinner. ;) I was rushing and failed to brown the meat in batches, which would have saved me some time--oops! Dish is not too hot, just a slight hint of heat, not over powering. Husband seems to want this weekly now--I'll accommodate to bi-monthly or monthly. Served over Spanish rice, which sucked in the flavor of the sauce too...YUM! If you don't want to serve in tortillas or over rice, this dish would be great with potatoes too! I might turn this into enchiladas tomorrow! Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  I used boneless pork country ribs instead of the shoulder; only simmered 40 minutes and it was deliciously tender.

totally loved this recipe. I have been growing tomatillos for the farmers market for years and never really knew how to use them besides tomatillo salsa on the weeks they didn't sell. I made this for a little impromptu dinner party and everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing. Also, I found out because of this recipe, that you can just chop your tomatillos when you grow them  and put them in the freezer in a bag and make this in the winter.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. It tasted even better the next day. However, the secon time I did make some changes: more than doubled the cumin, made the liquid half chicken stock, half white wine, added a bay leaf,  used just one jalepeno, and substituted oregano for marjoram (which I didn't have). The result was wonderfully authentic and flavorful.

The only change that I made was to roast, sweat and peel the peppers. All my Hispanic friends (Mexican.Colombian, Brazilian)loved it. The roasted peppers give it a more robust flavor. Served with brown rice, It's killer!!

I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves it. I find that we are starting to crave it
. 
The only changes I have made are: I don't use the full amount of cilantro because I don't care for it, but I use it as a garnish on others' plates; I double the cumin because we love it;  I use fresh marjoram, and I garnish with sliced grape/cherry tomatoes, Mexican crema, and queso fresco when I serve it. 

This recipe is the reason I grow tomatillos and I tripled my crop for them this year. I plan on make big batches of this and freezing it.... YUM!

This is delicious, it does not need modifications, however I also used spicy oregano out of the garden instead of marjoram, we used poblanos instead of jalapenos and broth instead of water.

NEVER have enough for leftovers!!!  It's only my husband and 12 year old daughter, and there's barely enough for my husband's lunch the next day. The Browning of the pork is time consuming, tomorrow, I am going to try doing it all in one batch as I saw on another recipe to at least Brown a couple sides, because to double this recipe would be extremely time-consuming in the Browning. This was requested by My husband for his bday dinner.. While back, he made a mock recipe of this throwing it all in the crock pot, and it was pretty good, but not the same... but totally worth it in a pinch for time.

Tastes great!!! I made a couple small changes by adding some oregano and chicken broth instead of water. Great way to use tomatillos from the garden. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made this last night and my family absolutely loved it! I needed a recipe that would use up my home-grown tomatillos and am so happy I chose this recipe. I couldn't find what to do with the jalapeños in the instructions and just added them with the tomatillos. :)

I made this for supper and was hesitant too, because my husband told me when we were dating that he strongly disliked Mexican food (I happen to love it).  When I made it, he never said a word during dinner, which is odd for him.  At the end of his bowl, he said "wow, I could actually live in Mexico, that was so good!" and I replied back "I was worried you didn't like it because you were so quiet." He responded back with "Well, yeah, if I started talking I would have to quit eating!" So, yeah, I would say this recipe is a success!

Wow!  We made this today and it was really good.  It has a nice heat the comes in a little later, which is really nice.  We served in a bowl with Queso cheese and avocados on top and a sprig of Cilantro.  We also had lightly cooked corn tortillas and cervesa on the side.

This got rave, rave reviews from my DH! He recently discovered his love for salsa verde. We usually aren't big pork eaters, but this was a HUGE hit. (I'm anxious to try it with chicken.) Ended up using a jar of salsa verde I had on-hand instead of making it from scratch, so it made it a really easy recipe. A+++. We were happily eating it for days -- because it made a LOT. Delicious over rice.

My husband is *very* picky about his pork green chili.  He loved this!  I did use pork chops (all I had) and green tomatoes (again...all I had) and cooked it in a pressure cooker.  Amazing with fresh tortillas!

Delicious and easy to make, too. Our local grocery store usually doesn't stock tomatillos, so this recipe required a special trip to the Mexican grocery--the stew is tasty enough that it's worth going out of your way for. Best of all, it gets better when you reheat it and it freezes well.

This is absolutely delicious! I have made it twice and both times substituted chicken stock for the water as someone previously suggested. I also served it with chopped red onion in addition to the sour cream and cilantro. I used my grandmothers cast iron Dutch oven which worked nicely. Highly recommend this recipe. Easy to make as well!

One of our favorites--a bit of work to make, but soooo worth it. Have served to many different friends & always gets rave reviews. Great left over, as well.

It is still simmering but love it already.  Have to walk away to stop sampling.  Made some subs based on what I had.  First, I used leftover pork that had been rubbed and slow cooked.  Didn't have fresh tomatillos so used store bought sauce.  Same with Jalpaenos - used Salsa Verde.  Upped all the spices a bit.  Will definitely add it to the rotation.

This is really great. I only used 1 jalepeno instead of 2, and I thought that was perfect. Other than that, I followed everything exactly. Very pleased.

I made this for 4, it was great.the first time I cooked w/tomatillos. I uses 2 tomatoes and 4 tomatillos.i put chili powder instead of the green chillies & jalapeño. My dad is a little shy on spices. I never have used the 2 items. This dish was great!! Thick and juicy stew. The pork melted in my mouth. I used the last end of a whole pork loin, the end w/darker meat. Love that part. I hated pork growing up, (that shoe leather stuff.) I can't wait to make it again!!!
