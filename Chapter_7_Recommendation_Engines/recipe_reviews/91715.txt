This was my first attempt at a cheesecake and I am happy to say that it was a success! This recipe is wonderful and it was so easy. The only thing I wasn't sure about was if the pudding was suppose to be "cook and serve" or "instant" pudding. I bought the instant and used it and it came out perfect. Recently a small bakery opened in the town I work in. The lady that owns it makes wonderful cheesecakes. I took my husband out to lunch there a couple of weeks ago. He tried her butterscotch cheesecake and really liked it. Therefore, I had to find a recipe for one. I went directly to the allrecipes website and found one. He said this recipe was far better than the one at the bakery. That always makes a wife happy!

this cheesecake had a wonderful taste and texture!  The only problem is that the pudding lumped up before I even added it to the cream cheese.  next time I'm going to try to mix the pudding with the water first and not even cook the condensed milk at all.  my husband LOVEDDD this cheesecake and is dying of rme to make it again.

This recipe was my very first attempt at making cheesecake. It turned out awesome! I could not be happier with the taste or eye appeal. It is moist, dense and creamy. Thanks for a GREAT dessert!

This cheesecake is rich and very dense which intensifies the flavor- I have had nothing but complements every time I have made it but I altered it to use Nabisco's chocolate wafers for the crust and another time I used gingersnaps for the crust
