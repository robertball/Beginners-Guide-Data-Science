The first time I made this as written except I omitted the ice.  With the banana being frozen, mine was thick enough and cold enough without it.  It was good.  The next time I made it, I subbed coconut milk for the regular milk, and I liked it much better this way.  I also added a teaspoon of roasted almond butter and some ground flaxseed.  Great smoothie.

I have made this twice now and I like it better each time.  First time I made it exactly as written, but for the ice.  Second time I had no bananas so I subbed half an avocado, which also worked quite well, but gave it a muddier appearance.  Taste wise there was no great difference.  Thanks Linda!

Have made this many times and I usually add a sprinkle of nutmeg & cardomom, too. It's an easy way to use up extra milk or get in a good source of iron (blackstrap molasses) when needed. Today I tried another reviewers rec and replaced some of the oats w/flax & chia. I couldn't taste them because I think the molasses & spices are so flavorful. But nice to get in even more nutrition that way. If you like molasses and cinnamon, you'll enjoy this recipe.

Made as written.  My taste buds weren't all that impressed but I really enjoyed the texture. I've never added oatmeal to a smoothie before and I think I will have to start.  (In my basic fruit/yogurt smoothies).

This is delicious! I've made this a few times now and have to admit that I'm hooked! I came upon a discovery by accident - I had mixed the milk, oats, molasses and spices in a mason jar one night ahead of time to make it even easier in the morning. I was delighted to find that the oats had a creamier texture the next morning. Yum!

Delicious! Tastes like a molasses cookie. Next time I will try with coconut milk for a more creamy result.

I quite enjoyed this "Molasses Spice Smoothie," which tastes just like a molasses-spice cookie. I appreciate that it has a frozen banana and molasses (with trace nutrients) for sweetness  instead of just plain old refined sugar.  This smoothie is a good substitute for a less-nutritious dessert, and a genius way to use up frozen bananas! Thank you Linda (LMT) for sharing your recipe.

The flavor was delicious, but I wasn't crazy about the texture. I processed about half of the oats through my grinder, and it was still too grainy for me. I guess I just prefer more of a smoother smoothie! I did add a scoop of vanilla protein powder which I usually do. Will try this again, leaving the oats out and try adding ground flax or chia seeds.

Like others, I added a dash of nutmeg and a handful of chia seeds. I really wanted to like this - it's so good for you - but the molasses/spice flavors just didn't seem to work with milk.

This was sooooooo good! I used fresh ginger and buckwheat flakes instead if oatmeal but kept true to the other ingredients. It is like drinking a pie! Thank you Linda(LMT) for this recipe.
