This was off the hook delicious! I used 3 lbs. of baby reds cut into quarters and roasted (used olive oil instead of canola). I also used sliced balck olives instead of kalamata, marinated artichoke hearts (which I think have wonderful flavor in the marinade) instead of canned and I also used fresh basil in the dressing instead of dried ....Wonderful flavors and the dressing was great on this salad. My company loved it.  I really liked the roasted red peppers and artichoke hearts with the potatoes.....really tasty.  A nice change of pace from the traditional mayo salads. A keeper. Thanks!

I loved this potato salad!  I served it today to my crew with a few minor modifications - I used Spicy Brown mustard instead of Dijon because that is what I had on hand.  I also used Garlic Pepper instead of regular pepper. My grocer didn't have any Gorgonzola cheese so I used Asiago.  I omitted the olives because I'm not a huge fan, and the taste came out great!  Everyone loved it....will definitely make again.  It came out beautiful with all of the different colors - someone even made a comment that it looked like a salad from a magazine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is by far the best potato salad I have ever had!  My guests raved about it and ate far more of it than I would have imagined.  I will say that it is a little bit on the unattractive side if you just throw it in a bowl, but I couldn't care less, given the incredible flavor.  To pretty it up, I placed it on lettuce leaves.  I would highly recommend this one.

Sorry, I just can't recommend this recipe as it stands.  I made it EXACTLY to specifications and found that it first of all looked unappetizing -- a sickly mushy brown color all over (thanks to the balsamic).  Second of all, it was much too tangy (again, the vinegar).  Finally, the garlic really came on strong in the dish.  Otherwise, it is a clever mixture of tastes and colors and I thought it was an inspired idea.  I tried the mixture without the dressing before I added it and found it to be quite tasty, with several colorful elements.  My recommendation is to either: 1) remove the dressing altogether, especially if serving to guests that don't like powerful dishes; or 2) cut the vinegar and garlic by half and/or substitute a quality white wine vinegar.  This way, the natural tastes and colors of the dish aren't overwhelmed by the balsamic vinegar.

When I first saw this, I liked the sounds of the roasted potato flavors, and the sound of the dressing flavors... but I disliked too many of the main ingredients.  i.e. don't like olives, artichoke hearts and peppers only done certain ways (and not like this).  So... I decided to try it as just a roasted potato salad with the rest of the ingredients.  Normally I would NEVER review a recipe I had changed so drastically cause I don't think that's fair.  But, the things I disliked had nothing to do with what I changed, so I'm rating it anyway.  I'm a cheese lover but discovered I don't care for Gorgonzola!  It was suggested I try Havarti, and I also found a "Mediterranean" gouda (had tiny bits of olive, dried tomato and herbs in it).  I used both and I will say they both worked well with these flavors.  I figured I used about 3/4 the "bulk" of the salad, so scaled the dressing to 3/4.  I liked the dressing.  Now, I liked the potatoes when they came out of the oven, and really, I could see making just that part for a side dish.  What I really disliked was the roasted potatoes in a salad like this - i.e. potatoes alone good, dressing good, but roasted potatoes IN the salad, no.  Just didn't seem to "match."  I would like to try just cooked potatoes like a normal potato salad, or possibly adding the roasting ingredients to the dressing sans the extra oil.  But definitely an interesting recipe.

I made this recipe for a small wedding reception. I agree with a couple of the reviewers that the color is not similar to what you are used to from the deli counter. I lightened the color of the dressing by adding 2T. Sour cream and 2 T. Mayo to the dressing. This was done to make the color of the salad more familiar to the wedding guests. The salad as is does have wonderful flavor. Foodies and adventuresome types loved this. I have had several requests for my recipe. I diced my potatoes into 1/2-3/4" cubes, coated them with the oil,and put them into a cold oven, turned the oven on and 25 minutes later the potatoes were done. I do think the salad tastes better at room temp. so take it out of the frig 20-30 minutes before serving.

It takes a lot to craft a recipe from scratch, develop it over time, and then put it out into the word for judgement. Thank you to everyone who took the time to create, taste, and review my recipe. Nine years, 4.75 stars, and 20 reviews later, I'm honored one of my favorites is enjoyed by so many!

There were a few reviews, however, that made me reflect and I've put together the following suggestions:

TOO SALTY - Try rinsing the olives before adding, limit your salt on potatoes, and make sure you're buying artichokes and roasted red peppers canned "in water" NOT brine.

LOOKS UNAPPEALING - I agree with reviewers. Since I know the orchestra of flavor in each bite, my mind has grown accustom to the look. If you're trying for the first time, I can see how the brown dressing mutes the rainbow of colors which entices one to try the dish. Try using white balsamic vinegar instead (see my two photos in bowl for results). This simple remedy provides the same flavor and keeps the color!

TOO MUCH DRESSING - Simple, lightly dress the potato salad and save remaining balsamic vinaigrette for a lettuce-based salad or caprese.

TOO GARLICKY -  A teaspoon of fresh garlic is a bit ambitious, I admit. Today I typically make my balsamic vinaigrette with 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic + 1/2 teaspoon minced shallot.

I served this as a side with stuffed portobello mushroom caps and it was so lovely with the creamy saucy mushroom filling.  My only complaint is that as written we found it to be a bit of a salt bomb.  Between the heavy amount of salt on the potatoes, and the  blue cheese, plus the artichokes and olives it was quite overpowering, but otherwise it had a great balance of flavors and textures.

This was delicious!  I didn't want to serve this cold but hot, right out of the oven.  So I skipped any steps with cooling down or chilling.  SO GOOD!!

Watch the time on your potatoes, as mine were cooked, browned, and out of the oven in 30 minutes.  I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had.  I used russet potatoes instead of red, and blue cheese instead of gorgonzola, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  We found this potato salad CRAZY good and a perfect side dish to the grilled chicken we had for dinner.  A little reminiscent of mediterranean flavors which  suits us fine.   I used white balsamic vinegar for presentation purposes, and will use gorgonzola in the future, as I think its milder flavor will work better than blue cheese.  One comment...definitely liked it much better warm as opposed to chilled.  Totally lived up to my expectations, and will be made often.  Thanks, Zin, for this innovative potato salad.

I substituted feta cheese for the one listed otherwise made it as stated.   I made 2 batches to take into my work for  a  party and both batches was gone within 30 minutes.  It was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.   It is very tasty.

This was delicious and a great alternative to traditional potato salads. I left out the olives because I don't like them and used blue potatoes since that's what I had on hand. Next time I think I'll omit the salt since the balsamic vinegar and herbs have a strong enough flavor on their own.

Good recipe.  As others say, don't overlook the potatoes.  I added some yellow and red pepper too, as our garden had an over abundance of them.  The dressing is really delicious.  Husband said it was a definite do-over!

Disgusting amount of dressing for the amount of potatoes suggested!  Potatoes were better off just roasted with the seasoning but with the black pepper cut in half.

We are not much of a mayonnaise family, so I decided to try this for a recent barbecue. I would not change a single ingredient - our family likes spicy and tangy and this fit the bill. The roasted potatoes give it a nice texture, and the peppers and artichokes hearts give it a little zing. It was too spicy for my mom (but everything is) but everyone else raved! I did use fresh herbs instead of dried, because I had them. I also made the dressing as directed and then just added it to taste. I think I used about 3/4 of it.  Others have commented that the color is not appealing but I didn't have that issue. If you are expecting this to look like a traditional potato salad than I guess you might be disappointed, but this version has a very garden-fresh look to it. I saved some of the fresh herbs and green onions to sprinkle on top before serving. We loved it!

This was amazing! I savored every bite. I cook for just 1 so don't use the oven. So I boiled the potatoes and added the spices to the dish itself and it was still fantastic. I will make this many more times! Thank you :)
