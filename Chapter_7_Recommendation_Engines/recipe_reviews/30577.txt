We grilled the meat along with onions and red peppers, and served the boiled down marinade separately. It was great this way - I think the fajitas would be a bit empty otherwise. We also used about 3/4 lb meat for 4 people and increased the sauce proportions a bit. I used about 4 times the amount of ginger called for, but I grated it to avoid those nasty chunks.

I've made this many times, also with chicken. After frying the meat I move it to a plate, then stir fry vegetables in a bit of extra oil before tossing the whole thing together. Onions, peppers, carrots, snow peas, etc. It's always a hit.

Your beef will be rarer and more tender if you marinate & cook it in one piece and slice after cooking. Since it gets put back in the sauce anyway you don't lose any flavor.

We made this recipe without any substitutions and thought it was just wonderful.  The meat has a unique flavor that I could see not everyone enjoying, but it was a hit for us.  The flavor is a bit more asian than I expected, but it worked perfectly.

Instead of slicing the raw beef and marinating, I left it whole and marinated it for a couple of hours then grilled the meat on my gas grill. I sliced the rare beef thinly across the grain and used that as the foundation of the wraps following the rest of the recipe as written. Very tasty. I think I'd like to try adding some more ingredients though besides just lettuce and meat next time, maybe cucumber.

I would make this again without using the wrap, instead serving the meat over white rice.  I think the wrap takes away from the Asian flavour.  Also instead of boiling the marinade, I'm going to try some cornstarch to thicken it up quicker.

This is a good quick recipe that also happens to be fairly healthy!  It needed a little something else after I reduced it, so I added fresh ginger and a teaspoon of red curry paste along with a bit of rice wine vinegar...the result...awesome!  I did however, think that the amount of honey specified was a little heavy, so next time I will reduce it by half!

Next time I will add Hot Pepper Flakes to add some spice to the sauce.  Also the Lettuce was dry and boring.  I will substitute w/an Asian Coleslaw.

I'm a bit surprised at the comments that this recipe had too much lime. C'mon, the basis of the original Mexican fajita is skirt steak and lime juice! Lime and beef go excellent together. Anyhow, this recipe worked out okay, but I still prefer the simple skirt steak marinated in lime and salted approach to fajitas.

Absolutely loved the marinade for this recipe. Added a little more lime (we love zesty foods in this house) and half a clove of garlic to it as well.

It definitely needed some veggies to go with it, so we used mushroom, cucumber and tomato along with mixed lettuce. Also put a little ranch dressing on it as well.

Will make this again, so very tasty, just next time will use more meat! Needs almost double what has been put down in the recipe.

This recipe is fairly easy to prepare and to cook, but, unfortunately was a "thumbs-down" entree to the 5 people I served it to,due to the overpowering taste of the lime juice. The wrap also needs some type of dressing to make it not so dry.

We loved this!  One of my kids (11 yrs) thought they were great, the 9 year old didn't.  I do think it might be better with skirt steak, will try that next!

Very tasty, quick to make, and satisfying. I made a vegan version using seitan (I used WestSoy seitan strips). I also used agave nectar in place of honey, and corn rather than flour tortillas (that's what I had around).

Marinated for about 2 hours.  The flavors were SOOOO excellent together. The crisp crunch from the lettuce perfectly accented the tangy sweet saucy beef.  This is a favorite now at our house!  Thanks so much for sharing!

The marinade has an interesting, almost haunting flavor which reminded me a bit of passion fruit. My family enjoyed the flavor but the wrap concept doesn't really work. I'd use the marinade recipe for a stir-fry in the future, though.

I didn't like the cut of meat for this recipe. I will use flank steak next time cut against the grain, and not cooked as much.

This is one of my hubby's favorite meals. I use sirloin tip and let it marinate for HOURS.. usually between 6-8. I also add extra sesame oil because that is a flavor my family enjoys.

I make a mayo/sriracha sauce that I spread on the tortilla before adding the lettuce and the meat. The coolness of the lettuce is a wonderful marriage with the heat of the sriracha/mayo.

I didn't bother with the lettuce, but otherwise I made this as written. I made it go a little further by softening some some green bell pepper and onion in olive oil. Personally, I thought it was way too sweet - I should have added the honey a little bit at a time. This was a nice enough meal, but I doubt I'd make it again. Thanks.

I tried this recipe last night.  It was great.  Next time I will add some red onions and possibly some bell peppers.  I will also cut the amount of honey to 1/3 cup.

Very good beef marinade but this recipe needs a lot of changes to become a real hit. I've added onions and peppers to the stir-fried meat and mayo to seal the tortillas. Next time, I'll omit the lettuce (we felt it didn't belong) and add more veggies. I'd also like to point out 1/2 lb beef won't feed 4 guests! You'll need to double the recipe...

This has a fantastic flavor. I added some chopped cilantro that went well with the lime juice. The meat was a little tough so I will try fajita skirt steak next time. This would be a great marinade for chicken too.

I tried this as a stir-fry over frozen stir-fry veggies instead.  The flavor would be very nice without all the lime - too overpowering.  I may try it again with half or a third of the lime juice; the rest of the flavors work very nicely together.

The marinade made the meat taste really good, but I felt like I didn't have enough meat.  Next time I will add more.

I’ve made this 3 times now and it just is not a good recipe. Super easy to make but the lime is just too over powering. I’ve ever tried reducing the amount of lime juice and even that doesn’t help. This one goes in the reject bin

Sorry,  didn't wow us.  I had a hard time with a wrap that had such minimal Veges.  Plus I thought the meat flavor was off...can't quite place my finger on what I'd do different though.

It is decent, absolutely love the sweet flavor on the beef. Yet I would add a bit more flavour to it, even a bit of onion would make it a lot better.

I thought it was a bit sweet, I think the next time I make this I will use a touch of gochuchang.

Neither my husband or I really cared for it. The lime taste was overpowering and we weren't crazy about the flavor.

My whole family really loved these.  The marinade was really tasty so I used a little extra to saute some veggies to include in the wraps.

I sauteed some onion and red bell pepper with the steak. There was quite a bit of marinade so I drained most of that before cooking instead of reserving it and boiling it later. It was delicious either easy. I added some shredded cheese to the wrap before I piled on the steak and lettuce. I also marinated the steak all day while I was at work. Delicious! I tried to decide if I needed a condiment (ex. Special mustard or something) but the flavor of the marinade is yummy on its own). It came together easy and fast! I would definitely make it again.

This is a delicious dish.  So simple to make.  I loved the recipe as is!  For the wraps, we did add red onion which was an nice touch.

I wouldn't make this again. I quadrupled it. We found the sourness to be overpowering.  I served it over rice as suggested in another review, which was a good idea.

12-30-2015 ~ I found a thin steak in the freezer and looked for a new recipe to use it.  This was a big hit with my guys.  The flavors worked well and I liked having the thicken marinade to add to the wraps.  I also sauteed an onion to add to the wrap.  I made my husbands with leaf lettuce and my son and I's with spinach leaves.  A nice wrap for something different.

Used Katrina89's suggestion and placed over brown rice since we didn't have wraps on hand. I needed to double the recipe and was a little low on honey so I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup agave nectar. Added some fresh green beans for crunch rather than lettuce or spinach. Husband loved it; kids not so much.

This did not turn out at all.  I'm not sure if I just did something wrong or if it was just one of those recipes that I wouldn't have liked even if I did everything properly.  We ended up throwing it away and ordering a pizza.  I won't be making this again.

I should have known things weren't turning out well when, while cooking the steak, there was NO aroma.  I got fresh prime cut beef and followed the directions exactly, but even the meat by itself tasted like NOTHING.  We like flavorful and aromatic foods and this just did NOT do it for us at all.

I've not actually made this exact recipe, so I can't rate it a full five stars.  I make this recipe generally as written, except that I use a lb of shrimp instead of beef and serve it over jasmine rice.  I also chop up about 3 dried tabasco peppers (about 1 Tbs red peper flakes) for a bit of a kick. My family likes spicy.  Instead of boiling down, I combine 1 Tbs cornstarch and 1 Tbs water and mix in with the sauce to thicken before adding the shrimp back in.  This is a recipe I've made a couple of times now, and there are never any leftovers.  Delicious!

Delicious and easy.  We really liked the flavor of the marinade.  My husband wanted something more in the wrap besides the meat and lettuce, though.

We didn't really care for these at all.  We found them to be kind of boring...and the flavour of the sauce was too sweet (with beef) for our liking.  We won't be making again....

This was quite good, didn't serve it in a wrap thought just with vegetables.  Didn't use ginger as I don't like it, it was quite tasty.

Wow!  This dish was awesome.  I cut back just a little bit on the lime juice and used ground ginger instead of fresh.  I marinated the meat for 30 minutes exactly, then cooked it in my wok and it came out GREAT!  I served in tortillas with lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese with Teriyaki Rice.  Yum!  My boyfriend raved.  I will use this again---

I marinaded for about 7 hours; needless to say the lime flavour had PLENTY of time penetrate the meet. Very strong lime flavour. I liked it, but I think next time I'll cut the marinade time to no more than two hours. I did not serve this on a wrap because when I was cooking it, it just seemed too much like stir fry, so I threw in frozen stirfry veggies when I was reducing the marinade. It was served over rice. Over all a hit. Personally, I thought it was a tad too sweet. I'll definately make it again, but I'll reduce the honey to 2 tbsp.
