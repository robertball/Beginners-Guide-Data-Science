I made this yesterday and it was delicious. I substituted the ground beef for ground turkey and used riced cauliflower instead of cauliflower crumbles and it still turned out fantastic. There is definitely a kick to it, so if you don't like spicy food, you may want to cut some of the pepper or take out the hot sauce, but I don't mind the heat so it was perfect.  I will most certainly make this again.  YUM!!

I used ground turkey and chicken broth. The Green Giant Cauliflower crumbles was a great tip. Fantastic recipe. My husband didn't notice the rice was cauliflower. This is a "Cookbook Worthy" recipe. Thank you.

This turned out very good... I love the flavor in the seasonings and I did use country sausage for the meat and frozen cauliflower rice,  and I did forget to warm it a few minutes first to get the moisture out however after adding the vegetables I went ahead and squeezed it dry and put it back in  the pan and proceeded with adding the seasoning and liquids and it turned out great ...thank you for the great recipe!

I thought this would be "not too bad" but it was actually very good!  I used andouille sausage instead of ground beef because that's what I had on hand.  Served it with okra and tomatoes - simple: a bag of frozen chopped okra and a can of petite diced tomatoes.  This is a very healthy dish for a diabetic and I would definitely make it again.

UPDATE:  Made this a second time using ground beef.  Halved the cauliflower and beef but kept all the spices the same.  Used a cup of beef bouillon from a cube (since I always have that on hand).  Mmm, it is so good!

This is really good. I made some modifications just because of what I had on hand. I used mirepoix style seasoning vegetables (celery, onion and carrot) because the hubs doesn't like peppers. I used meatless beef crumbles instead of ground beef because it is what I had on-hand. And I added about a cup and a half of cooked quinoa along with one bag of frozen cauliflower rice, again because it is what I had on-hand. Also, I made my own cajun seasoning blend (2 1/2 tablespoons paprika, 2 tablespoons salt, 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 1 tablespoon dried thyme) and used about 3 teaspoons of it in place of the cajun seasoning and other seasonings listed since it was all about the same stuff. My husband, who insists he doesn't like cauliflower, liked this. Definitely a keeper.
