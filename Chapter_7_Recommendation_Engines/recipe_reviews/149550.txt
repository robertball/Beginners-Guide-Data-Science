Great recipe.  I made it into cupcakes, but I did tweek it a little.  I added a teaspoon of baking powder, a teaspoon of vanilla and 5 tablespoons of butter.  (I melted the butter in with the chocolate.)  Fill your cupcake tin almost to the top with the batter.  I baked for 23 minutes and they were moist and delicious!

My mother-in-law is gluten and lactose intolerant, so I thought I'd give this a shot on her last visit.  Yum!  Very cakelike, good nutty texture and taste from the beans.  I think I would change it by adding a bit of vanilla, and using bittersweet chocolate, but otherwise it's great.   I'm going to keep making it for myself even though she's gone home. :-)  

Make sure the flour you use to dust the pan is gluten-free, or even better, use cocoa instead.

Incredible! I shared this with co-workers and they loved it. The taste of gluten-free food keeps getting better and better.

Note for previous reviewer: Hershey, Reeses, & WalMart Brand chocolate chips are GF...

Uh, this is RIDICULOUS...  Ridiculously  fantastic!  For a point of reference, I have been buying the Trader Joe's flourless chocolate cake... this recipe is just as good if not better! I substituted 1/3C egg whites for two of the four eggs.  I also used  1/2 C milk chocolate chips and 1 C. semi sweet chips, and dusted the pan with unsweetened coco pwdr.  I have a gluten intolerance and only use Ghiradelli as Hershey's is difficult to get an answer about allergies.  Hope this is helpful.

This cake is the most delicious and decedent chocolate cake I have ever tasted! For all those reviewers who are giving this recipe 1/5 stars, you must NOT be following the recipe correctly.  It actually upsets me reading the negative reviews.  How is possible to be biting into a bean? You are supposed to be blending the beans into a smooth mixture via a food processor! How is it dry? The recipe calls for 4 eggs! Grainy? Again, mix via food processor to a smooth consistency and wash the beans thoroughly beforehand.  Not sweet enough or chocolately enough? Are you using the correct measuring spoons?! Anyone who follows this recipe to the exact T should be successful in making a delicious cake.  If you have a good quality food processor, a non stick baking pan, and you know how to read and follow instructions, this cake will turn out fantastic.  Good luck!

I made this cake out of plain curiosity in my search for healthy deserts - it was so much better than i had ever imagined! Garbanzo beans...who would have thought? I covered the cake with strawberries and sifted powdered sugar - it was a hit! I think the strawberries gave the cake the sugar/sweetness that a frosting would have normally - next time i will try out different fruits :)

Unbelievable! I tried this because I thought it sounded interesting (maybe a little bit weird). I told my husband to try it first since I wasn't sure. But it is THE BEST FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE I've ever had! It's rich, sweet, intensely chocolate--awesome!!!!!! Everyone should give this a try. The ingredients might seem odd, but the technique is simple, and the results are good enough to sell in a bakery! (Only recipe note: I turned my oven up to 360 instead of 350 since I'm at high altitude.)

I have made the chocolate version several times and love it. Even non-Celiacs in the family love it and it is realitively healthy since there is no butter, or oil in it. I have also made my own COCONUT version of this cake. To make a coconut version: 1)Omit the chocolate chips. 2)Add one can of coconut milk. 3) Add a bag of dried coconut. 3) Increase the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups. 4) Add 1/4 tsp of salt. 6) 1 tsp of vanilla. 5)I like to top it with coconut frosting from the baking aisle of the store.

Great recipe.  Served it to 7 people & they all liked it.  My 12 year old daughter had 2 pieces.    I processed the beans ALOT & it was pretty smooth.  No one could taste the beans @ all but felt good about the fact that they were eating a dessert that was actually good for them.  We thought it was sweet enough, my sister in Law who is a health nut thought it was too sweet but she hates sweets altogether but it was fun to see her enjoying her cake & not feel guilty about it.  The only change I made was to put in more baking powder, added 1 tsp. vanilla and used brown sugar instead of white.  I will only add the stated amount of baking powder next time as I feel it will be better not being so airy.    The cake does look dry but then when eating it surprisingly it doesn't taste dry.  Kinda crumbly (but no one minded) so next time I will try adding some applesauce or butter or maybe even some Peanut butter.  Chocolate chips or chunks, nuts would also be good in it.    Really make sure by poking in the center as to when the cake is truly done.  Mine took longer to cook than stated.  This Recipe will be used over & over again, with variations as to additions and toppings, as a cake & as cupcakes. 

UPDATE Made it again, this time added toasted whole almonds as the food processor will chop them.  Added 1/3 cup applesauce  & a 1/4 cup coconut oil.  Wow it was perfect.  More fudgy tasting, less crumbly & the nutty bits were a nice treat.  Raspberries & dollop of cream on top perfect!

Great recipe!  I made it for my mom who has celiac.  She loved it!  I even ate it and enjoyed it very much.  I could not find a 19 oz can of garbanzo beans so I used 2 cups.  Came out great.  I also topped it with Fat Free Cool Whip and some chopped pecans.  Very delicious.

I messed up and it was still delicious! (I forgot to add sugar... even healthier I guess). Also make sure that the chocolate chips are gluten-free, most chocolate chips contain vanilla which actually has gluten. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make it again.

OMG! HUGE HIT for my Valentine's Day Party. Took tips from other reviewers. Added 3 T Butter + 1 tsp. Baking Powder + Vanilla + 1/2 tsp Salt for each batch. I did a double batch! Cooked the Garbanzo Beans in the water from the can in the microwave to soften them first, and picked out the popped shells and discarded the skins/shells. Cooled and rinsed. Used my Blender to puree because so many commented that it had a Humus texture. Blender was working hard, but I did a double batch (2-15 oz cans) and mixed the eggs and vanilla in with the blender cycle! THE BOMB! Put Boysenberry Preserves (seedless) in between the two 9" cake round layers and decorated with a choc glaze and fresh berries. Revealed the Garbanzo Bean incredients AFTER everyone had munched down this cake - raving about it! Served it with Vanilla Ice Cream. Have a request to make it for Passover. You need flourless cakes for Passover! A must - even for picky people - everyone raved! Super rich! FIVE STARS! A new staple for dessert!

This cake sounds strange (my roomates sure were skeptical!) but it is so good! We were so impressed. It is very fudgy and moist. Decided to try it because a friend could not eat gluten or dairy, but will keep making this for everyone! It is such a great cake! We used dark chocolate chips rather than semisweet.

I've made this recipe several times now and absolutely love it. I use Ghirardelli 60% Bittersweet Cacao Chocolate (found at most grocery stores) and the rich dense flavor, almost tastes like a brownie rather than a cake. Rather than using a cake pan, I spread the mix on a long cookie sheet and bake. When it's finished baking and cooled, I take a round cookie cutter (or drinking glass) and cut out biscuit size rounds and stack them, three high while placing fruit and whip cream between each layer. Top with fruit of your choice along with whip cream and a drizzle of pureed fruit and you're set. Highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe and very simple to make.  I altered nothing and my husband and four-year old gobbled their pieces up.  I like that it is not too sweet.  Will definitely make again.

I was amazed and my in laws were as well! No one would have guessed it was made from beans. I did add 3 tbsp of butter and some vanilla extract (I never bake without it!).  I also stirrred in the rest of the bag of chocolate chips just before I put the batter in the pan (a bag of chocolate chips has 2 cups and I had nothing else to use the chips in planned).  The cake was extremely chocolatey and like others described between a brownie and cake in texture.  My husband thought it reminded him to the texture of texas sheet cake.  I was worried because even after processing the beans and eggs for about 10 minutes total, the batter still seemed grainy, but you couldn't tell in the finished cake.  Thanks for a great gluten free dessert I can serve my father in law! Oh, and I served it with cherry topping and whipped cream, but it was just as good plain.

This is a good cake made according to the directions, but it can easily be a great cake.

First, replace the sugar with a scant 1/2c local honey or other natural syrup. 

Second, hull the chickpeas before you blend them. If you've made this recipe before, you may have noticed it has a 'grainy' texture. that is the hulls. it's time consuming to pinch each hull off, but I did a test tonight with a fully hulled batch and one that I just washed and tried to remove as many as possible as they separated off. the fully hulled batch was silky smooth.

Third, add some greek yogurt. (Fage, I'm looking at you, not an americanized knockoff. should be milk, cream, and cultures with NO emulsifers (gums, pectin, lecithin, ect.) I added a dollop (1/4 to 1/3c) to these two batches today and they fluff a bit more and the crumb is finer. 

Fourth, separate the eggs. blend the hulled chick peas, egg yolks, and honey for 5 mintues or so until silky smooth. after you blend in the melted chocolate, whip the whites to stiff peaks and fold in. the baking time is reduced with the whipped egg whites. 1/2 hr in a 9" springform has been working for me, and if anything that's too long.

I made this cake for Aubrey's birthday/ wedding engagement/house warming all in one...  I added the zest of an orange...it turned out beautifully! I used a doiley on top of the cake and then I had dusted it with powdered sugar for  that flower effect. Check out the pictures above and you will see what I'm speaking about... My next one will be with less sugar and darker chocolate. This is a saver and wil be made quite often in my kitchen. Thank-you!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I had to make this when I read the recipe, strictly because I didn't believe it could possibly be that good. I was shocked. Made this for a girls night, topped with a few strawberries. All of them requested the recipe. Perfect the way it is. I made it again and tweaked a bit for a lower calorie version to battle off some chocolate cravings. Replaced eggs with egg beaters, sugar with splenda and reduced the chocolate chips down to 150grams (little less than a cup) and added a 2 TB of cocoa powder. Still delicious and even lower in calories.  FYI The reduced calorie version comes to around 1300 cals for the whole thing, I made 20 small cupcakes. perfect 65 calorie treat... or 130 when I have two ;)

This recipe is awesome. I've only recently cut gluten out of my diet so this was the first cake I've tried. Despite the reviews I was a little hesitant about the cake because I thought everyone might be comparing this to other gluten free or flourless cakes. I was worried it wouldn't stack up against a normal chocolate cake. I was wrong. This cake was awesome even in comparison to a typical chocolate cake. It was also the easiest cake I have ever made in my life. I think it took me about 10 minutes to get it into the oven. I highly recommend this recipe.

We have a cafe and find that having quality gluten free products is becoming increasngly important.  My chef loved this recipe as it was very quick and easy; I loved it because garbonzo beans are far cheaper than the almond meal used in most GF recipes.  BUT -- the recipe says to grease and 'flour' the pan -- be sure you use corn flour or another GF alternative!!!

I think that my expectations were a little too high for this recipe; I have just started to try out gluten-free cooking and products.  I didn't have very high hopes for baked goods without gluten, but when I read all the great reviews for this recipe, I thought I should try it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I felt like it was lacking something; the texture was fine, but it wasn't sweet enough or rich enough or...something.  I won't make this one again, and I'll keep looking for other recipes for gluten-free deserts.

I am so grateful to find this recipe.  We have one person that needs a gluten/dairy free diet so I wanted to find her something sweet that she could pig on.  This was PERFECT! I followed the suggestions of others and made the following changes (that’s the whole point of this site). To the chocolate, I added 5 T of Butter then melted it.  I could not find a 19 oz can of beans so I bought two 15 oz and used about ½ of the second then pigged on the rest.  I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and upped the baking powder to 1 teaspoon.  When I made this one I didn’t think to put parchment paper on the bottom of the pan so my cake stuck but next time I’ll know better.  FYI: I coat my pan w/spray, lay parchment only on the bottom, then spray the paper, then coat the whole pan w/baking cocoa.  This cake domed so beautifully then collapsed when it cooled but goodness it was moist had great texture and tasted great.  Thanks for sharing  If anybody has an idea on how to avoid the collapsing I would love the help.

was extremely crumbly and tasted kind of weird immediately after it baked. Ate some later that evening and it was much better. Ate some the next day and it was DELICIOUS. So the only suggestion I have is let it rest :P

I stumbled upon this recipe when looking for something to do with the couple extra cans of garbanzo beans in our pantry as we prepare for a move and, like many others, tried it due to pure morbid curiosity.. Boy, am I glad I did! This was so surprisingly good! It has an almost brownie-like consistency and rich chocolate flavor. My recommendations for others are these: I made it exactly as is and it was delicious but if you are not a fan of LOTS of rich chocolate flavor, I would cut the chips down a little. Also, I added a blackberry sauce on top (again, getting rid of the blackberries in the freezer..) that made this recipe even better. My husband (a chocolate lover) would have preferred a chocolate sauce on top or whipped topping but that's way too much chocolate for me. So, if you're interested - 1 14-16 oz bag frozen blackberries thawed and pureed in food processor or blender, 1/3 c sugar (less if you want more tart and less sweet), 1 tsp cornstarch. Simmer and stir 2 minutes then refrigerate in covered bowl for 1 hour (so, make it while the cake is baking).  Regardless, this cake was DELICIOUS as is and I can't wait to make it again... and especially to make it for others and surprise them with the main ingredient!

I love this cake recipe and have made it several times. The latest time was a church function and I labeled it "gluten free cake" without letting people in on the secret ingredient (beans!). Nobody guessed it was chickpeas and raved about how decadent it was. I bake mine in a mini-tart pan and turn them into 2 bite brownies. For a refined sugar free version, I melt 6 oz of unsweetened chocolate in the double boiler and add 1 cup of agave nectar to the bean/egg mixture in the food processer. Like the other suggestions, I add vanilla and some dried, instant coffee and a pinch of cayenne - delicious! This is my go-to recipe when I want something delicious, rich and still somewhat healthy.

I made the following changes: dark chocolate chips (instead of semisweet); 15 oz. can garbanzo beans (instead of 19 oz.); generous ½ cup organic sugar (instead of ¾ cup); 1 t baking powder (instead of ½ t); Pamela’s WF/GF Baking & Pancake Mix on pan (instead of flour). . .  Also, I added 2 T butter and 1 ½ t vanilla to the melting chocolate and I added ½ cup unsweetened apple sauce to the bean mixture.
Result:  moist, more dense than cake, desserty without being too sweet, good with vanilla frozen yogurt. . . definitely satisfied my craving for holiday baked goods.  It was crumbly (not a big deal). I didn’t taste the beans.  Next time I’ll reduce to ¼ c applesauce (experiment with consistency) and, if I’m baking it for others, will either use some semisweet chips or use more sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

Thanks for sharing this rich, fudgy cake recipe.  I modified it for families living with food allergies.  I only had a 15-oz can of garbanzos.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 tsp vanilla. I made this cake egg-free by replacing the eggs with 3T ground flaxseed mixed with 9T water, and used a dairy-free brand of semisweet chips.  It can be made soy-free, too, by using EnjoyLife semisweet chocolate chips, which are free of the top 8 allergens.  (Most semisweet chips contain soy lecithin.)

Followed the recipe to a Tee the first time and it was amazing. The 2nd time i made it I incorporated peanut butter and it was even better. Very great alternative to a flour filled chocolate cake. I brought it to work and a co-worker woofed the whole thing down!

I've made this recipe twice, exactly as the directions state. First time, the cake seemed dry and I had chunks of garbanzo beans. The second time, I blended everything for twice as long in the food processor and it made all the difference. It had a fudgy brownie texture and was oh-so-smooth, almost like a cheesecake. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze, strawberries, and whipped cream. Everyone requested the recipe.

This was very good. I did not use a can, instead we purchased a bag of dry beans and cooked it according to instructions. 
Then we used 2 cups of beans.
Melted bitterswet chocolate in a double broiler, and used about 1/2 cup of sugar.
Came out very good.

I made this to take to Thanksgiving at the inlaws with ciliac relative. I just read complaints about it falling apart - I made it in a spring form pan (since I wasn't going to FLOUR the pan after greasing it) and it worked great!  Stayed together well enough that the last piece was eaten by hand - picking up a wedge! It was really good - not very "cake" like texture wise, closer to a brownie, though lighter. Tasted great, was easy to make, and full of healthy chick peas. How can you go wrong?!?

Unbelievably GOOD! I recently started eating Gluten free so I know what real food tastes like. I made a couple adjustsments to the recipe that were suggested. I added 4 Tbl butter, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbl mayo (To off set the bean taste. When I mixed up the cake it smelled like beans, but once it baked, it had a wonderful taste and texture. Also, it's really simple to make.
I will definately make this again!

This is a highly popular cake at home and work. The beans are indelible.  If you can't find a 19 oz. can, use a 15 oz can plus 1/2 cup drained, rinsed beans from another can.  I had best luck using large or extra large eggs.

Wow! Who would have thought chickpeas could make an awesome cake! I was a little skeptical, but wanted to make something special for a gathering that included a friend who has many food allergies. Everyone liked them! 

I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkling of cinnamon (maybe a 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon--I didn't measure). They had a lovely Mexican chocolate flavor. 

I made them into cupcakes because I didn't want to add flour or butter to the pan since my friend is allergic to both. They took about 22 minutes and were moist and delicious. 

For those who say that they had chunks of beans in the finished product, I recommend trying a different brand of beans. I've noticed a huge variation in the softness of different brands. Bush's are my favorite brand and they worked well here. I also left them in the food processor for a long time before adding the egg. I didn't find a single chunk of bean. 

Give it a try!

This was my 1st attempt at GF baking. I made this as a birthday surprise for a friend who has a wheat allergy. I followed the suggestions of others and took the skin off the chickpeas before processing. I processed them for approximately 5 mins on high before adding the eggs.  I used Ghiardelli bittersweet chic chips and did add a TBSP of butter to them while melting in the microwave.  I did make it into cupcakes and i got about 10, filling them almost to top.  Baked for approx 22 mins at temperature specified. I was surprised how good they were!  There was no bean flavor and I didn't detect the nutty flavor that others have noted. They are very heavy, like a very dense fudge brownie.  The only problem I had was the top cracked a bit. I did remove a small amount from each cupcake and filled/iced with the Mocha Cream recipe also on this site.  The light and airiness of the icing was a good balance to the dense texture of the cupcake.

Oh my ... this is really good! I served it to company last night (even the picky guys loved it!). I didn't have chocolate chips so I used peanut butter chips ... followed another suggestion and added 3 Tbsp of butter to the chips, 1 tsp vanilla and an extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I also made a glaze ... 1 Tbs creamy peanut butter, 2/3 c pwd sugar and 4 tsp water. A definite keeper!

These were great!  I only had ~1 c choc chips, so I added a fair amount of cocoa powder and a little extra sugar to make up for it.  These are great -- very dense and moist.  I made mini-cupcakes instead of a big cake - perfect for gatherings!

This cake is amazing! The caked looked especially dry, so I made a simple frosting glaze out of butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. I made it runny enough to be a glaze over the cake. Well, once I refrigerated it, and sliced to serve, it does in fact seem crumbly when you slice, but the texture is smooth and the flavor delicious. Not dry at all. Made this for a family reunion, which consisted of a growing number of Celiacs ! Even the non-celiacs gave it a try, and it was unanimous that this is a KEEPER.

I gave it five stars because now I can have cake on a gluten free diet!!! It turned out very good. I used 2 Tlb of stevia as a substitute for the sugar. Next time I will add more chocolate chips.

Wonderful recipe.  Based on other reviews I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and expresso powder.  I also placed a piece of parchment in the bottom of the pan to avoid sticking, and dusted the entire pan with cocoa powder.  But the thing I added that probably made the biggest difference in the texture was to peel the garbanzo beans.  Sounds weird, but they slip right off, and it helps remove any odd grittiness from the batter.  You can apply the same idea to hummus :)

I  followed the recipe exactly as written. The bean mixture comes out grainy, so I would suggest either to grind the beans very well before adding the eggs, or to cook them a bit over some heat for a few minutes before draining to make them softer. I ended up with a grainy cake, with tiny bits of chickpeas in it. The taste is really good though. The texture..not so much. I would make again but I would cook the beans and puree them  really well before adding anything else. I would also add some vanilla, or strong coffee to it for more flavour. If you want this to be completely gluten free, be careful NOT to flour the pan! I would suggest using cocoa powder instead. Thank you!

Great alternative to all the gluten-free cakes out there. I poured the batter into ramekins for individual servings. When I pulled them out of the oven, it smelled so good, I tried to pull one out to try. Big mistake. It crumbled all over the place. I read some of the reviews and decided to let them cool completely, then put then in the fridge for a few hours. When I pulled them out after dinner, they were perfect! Very dense, very chocolatey, and great with some sliced strawberries that I had marinating in honey. Everyone was so suprised when I told them it was made of garbonzo beans! Thanks for the great recipe!

this was pretty good.  i would give this 3 1/2 stars if purely based on taste, but it gets 4 stars for being gluten free and for its use of chickpeas.  i added vanilla and served with fresh strawberries with a touch of sugar and lemon to make it a bit saucy.  I think I will try it again and add some whole chocolate chips and maybe even chopped walnuts into the batter.

This is really a 4.5 rating... but I"m rounding up.  The taste is actually very good.  (Proof that anything is good w/ chocolate.) I used ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips.   There's something slightly off about the texture of the cake, though.  It's not DRY... but it is a bit fragile/crumbly.   It's hard to explain.  It's not enough to make me avoid this recipe in the future.

Wow, this is really good! However, I did add ~2 T of vegetable oil based on other's reviews and comments saying that it was too dry. The cake turned out to be perfectly moist and very chocolaty!

This cake was wonderful. I made it for my annual Christmas Eve dinner when I realized that I had no dessert that my niece (who is allergic to wheat) could eat.  Everyone enjoyed it. My niece even asked for the rest of the cake to take home following dinner. If you like chocolate, you'll love this cake! The only changes I made to the recipe were to use a Splenda/Sugar baking mix and I also doubled the baking powder after reading some of the reviews. Great recipe!

Made exactly per instructions, used excellent chocolate but this was dry and crumbly although baked the recommended 40 minutes which was obviously too long. Grainy with the flavor of canned garbanzo beans very obvious (which over-powered the good chocolate) despite the fact that I rinsed and rinsed the beans. Being gluten intolerant I was hopeful it was as good as reviewers claim but NOT even close! Don't get how this could possibly come out different with garbanzo beans as the base which is why the grainy texture and canned bean flavor...There are really good gluten free desert recipes in addition to baked goods such as WOW cookies which are better than wheat products so there is absolutely NO reason to settle for this if you are gluten intolerant.

Excellent! I love this cake and I think the batter tastes better than regular chocolate cake batter.  My tip is to add a little butter to the chocolate chips (aprox 1/2 tsp) and if you can only find  16 oz can of garbanzo beans (like me) you can add 1/8 cup rice flour. I actually liked it better that way than following the recipe exactly.

I have made this twice now and love it.  Make sure to really blend the beans finely otherwise the cake will be very grainy. Also make sure to allow the cake to cool before removing from the tin otherwise you will leave half of it behind.  Really grease the tin well before adding the batter.  Definately use dark chocolate for this.

As a recent weight-loss surgery survivor, I was looking for something to bake on my birthday that would FEEL like birthday cake without putting myself at risk. This was FANTASTIC. I read some of the reviews and found the feedback useful; however, I pretty much followed the recipe as is. I didn't have a food processor, so my blender got quite the work out. To battle the beans, I did add about 1/2 can of bean juice in during the grinding phase of the recipe. I used egg beaters (4 eggs = 1 cup egg beaters) and it was PHENOMENAL. My husband (who had a BAD experience with a Black Bean Chocolate Cake baked by a friend's wife) was amazed (and HE's the FOODIE). He asked that I make it for his "Guy Night". I made a few alterations, mostly to play with consistency (added raspberry-pear puree from the baby food aisle and a box of SF/FF chocolate fudge pudding), but again kept it all the same. Now his FRIENDS are asking for the recipe. I think this is a very versatile, very forgiving recipe if you're willing to spend the time ensuring the beans are broken down to a smooth, hummus-like consistency. I cannot wait to play with other flavor profiles. Thank you for this amazing recipe.

I made this for my daughter's friend with a gluten allergy.  I wasn't expecting much but it was so good.  Has the texture more like a brownie or a torte but really good chocolate flavor.

Delicious and loved that it had garbanzo beans in it, so it felt less guilty and healthier, but was not as dense and moist and rich as I had hoped for like other flour-less chocolate cakes I've had in the past.  My boyfriend said it tasted like a brownie. Didn't taste nutty to me, can't tell there are garbanzo beans in it. We added warmed (on the stove) chopped up frozen strawberries, whip cream, and dairy free coconut strawberry ice cream, and I think adding those items vastly improved and complemented the cake.   I melted the chocolate chips in a double boiler not a microwave.  Also, added a little bourbon vanilla extract.

This a treat!
I must admit, I was nervous, despite the fact I love Garbanzo beans!  This truly turned into an amazing guilt-free dessert!  How fantastic!  I recommend everyone try it.

I substituted 1/2 cup of Truvia for the sugar!

Thanks for sharing!

For what it is, a gluten-free/healthier version of chocolate cake, it was freaking amazing! I am not gluten intollerant, but one of my co-workers is, and she has such a hard time finding "normal" foods to eat (she's our parttimer, and only 16). I made this (super easy, by the way) cake for her, and she loved it, and so did everyone else. My boyfriend, pretty opinionated and reserved when trying "new things," and good friend, whose mother is a master baker, both enjoyed the cake. 

I already went and bought more supplies. I will be baking this again. I served mine with Chapman's (b/c it's nut-free) mint chip icecream. Yum!

This was stinking delicious! I am not on a gluten restricted diet but just wanted to try. I made it for about 8 people and everyone loved it- NO ONE could guess what the secret ingredient was! I waited about 5 minutes to let them in on the secret...hehe.

I used a 15.5 oz can of garbanzo beans- all other amounts the same. So. Delicious. Topped with a criss cross of Hersheys Syrup and powdered sugar. Even BETTER the next day, cold out of the fridge-might serve that way from now on. Definitely a keeper!!!

I was so pleasantly surprised by this cake!  A 15 ounce can of garbanzo (chickpeas) worked fine.  The smell of the batter kind of scared me (it smelled a lot like chickpeas!) So I was afraid that the cake would taste like chickpeas (love them, just not with chocolate!) But you can't taste them at all!  The cake kind of deflated after letting it cool on a rack (oven may have been running hot) 

I sprinkled with confectioners sugar, topped with lots of freshly sliced strawberries & some homemade whipped cream & this was a dream dessert!  My hubby & I both LOVED it!

Try it, you won't regret it!

Came out awefully dense , dry, and grainy. I don't understand, because I followed the direction to the T! This is not a keeper in my book. Oh well, on to the next baking adventure.

*~The Wifey whooped this up for me for my birthday and it was grrrrrrrrrrrreat!!   When I first saw 'garbonzo,' I thought it would be a flop but instead it was the tops!! Yummm! The gonzo garbonzos gave the cake a nutty flavor. I ate my pieces covered in whipped cream.  Next time we're going to make two cakes, one dark chocolate and one peanut butter, then layer the cakes and slap some fudge frosting all over it. Oh yeah, it'll be tops!!  Like John Lee Hooker said,"Now we COOKIN!!! Thank you!!!~  We used dark chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate chips and 2 cups cooked gonzo beans instead of the can.*

You have to taste this to believe it! Its chocolatey and moist, and you would never be able to guess it was made with garbanzo beans! It was an easy and quick recipe, and the results will amaze any doubter.

Tried making this for a friend with celiac disease ... she wouldn't eat it because chocolate chips have "questionable" ingredients.  The rest of the group ate some of it, but didn't think it really tasted like "cakey cake."  I gave it three stars because the claim of "gluten free" isn't necessarily true ... for us who do not know enough about what constitutes "gluten free" to those who are sensitive.  In other words, do not try to "surprise" your friends with this cake ... talk with them before to make certain it meets their needs.

This is such an amazing recipe and it is so easy.  Do not tweak it, it is perfect as is.  My husband was amazed and thought it was gourmet.  I now bring this cake with me whenever I am invited to someone's house for dinner because I cannot ever participate in desserts because of the gluten factor.  This is filling, healthy, and the texture is perfect.  I make it with dried beans instead of canned (2 and 1/4 cups cooked), soak them overnight and then cook them.

I just made it again and cut up some extra chocolate mixed the chunks in addition to the melted chocolate and then baked it.  MMm it is even better, fantastic.

This is my first gluten-free dessert to make.  Wow! It is wonderful!   I served it to a bunch of high schoolers (they were unaware of the ingredients)  They loved it!  I did add some cinnamon (1/2 t) and vanilla (1 t)  and I've played with mixing the semi-sweets with dark chocolate.  Be aware--it can crumble easily so let it cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes before transferring to a plate.  Enjoy!

This cake was amazing!!! I did not tell my (very picky especially when it comes to beans in anything) friends what was in it when I served it to them and they raved over it!  They were picking at it all night and even had seconds.  I added about a tablespoon of coffee and teaspoon of vanilla to punch the chocolate up a bit.  Will definitely be making this over and over!

First batch had a few beans remaining... and spouse actually thought I added nuts to the recipe! (Hmmm... interesting.) 
Blenderizing much longer than I anticipated really made this recipe work well... so rich and yummy... I had to keep reminding myself (and others) that these were gluten-free treats!

Really good simple flourless cake!  You would never know there were garbanzo beans!  I added a chocolate ganache over the top, that really made it, in my opinion.  It did crumble around the sides and seemed a bit delicate.

I used dark chocolate chocolate chips and I added a 1/2 tsp real vanilla.  I loved the cake.  It is more dense than a regular cake and jam packed with win.  I will make this a regular with my family.

This recipe is awesome. I have a Bunco group that half the ladies eat only gluten free foods. We have been wanting a good dessert. This came out awesome and the only thing I did was add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I served it with raspberry preserves and whip cream. It was a big hit with even those of us who don't do gluten free. I will make this all the time.

Couldn't find 19 oz can of beans so used can and a half which was about 23 oz.  Next time would just stick to the 1 can (15 oz).  Love that this is healthy.  Hubby and kids didn't know it was made with beans or they wouldn't have touched it but the kids actually came back for seconds.  I added some almond extract which some family members loved but personally would probably leave out next time.  Cake was dense and chocolately and very rich.  Paired extremely well with some fresh strawberries.

This was my first attempt at a gluten free recipe... and let's say I was skeptical about the garbanzo beans. So, the bright side: it didn't taste like garbanzos! The not-so-bright side: I'm not sure how it was supposed to turn out, but it was thick, almost like a crumbly brownie, and kind of dry. Not very cake-like at all. I added a creamy filling and ganache to counteract the dryness, and it went over well though.. so my bottom line is, if you're gluten intolerant, this is worth it.

I accidently used 23 oz of beans instead of 19 and it wasn't bad. I bet it's really good with the right amount! I'm going to make it a second time...

It taste okay.  I can taste the bean flavor on it.  I was the only one that ate more than one serving at home. If I try it again, I'll have to make some changes to decrease the bean flavor.

I was skeptical but intrigued. The verdict?  The most insanely good chocolate cake I have ever had!! It was so rich and moist without the slightest hint of garbanzo bean flavor. I preferred it cold the next day. I'm stunned. Really. Just try this.... you'll be blown away!

rich and smooth texture - I drained 1 15oz can and added 1/3 of another can of garbanzo beans.  It was the perfect amount.

While searching for an easy birthday cake recipe for a friend who is wheat and dairy free, I came across this recipe and was intrigued.  I used 70% Lidnt dark chocolate since it's dairy free. After reading a few reviews mentioning a grainy texture, I decided to take preventative measures and peeled the beans. I also used superfine sugar instead of regular granluated. The batter was velvety smooth. I topped the cake with a dairy free "caramel" recipe that I found which was 1/4 cup almond butter, 1/4 cup agave nectar, 1/2 T vanilla and 1/4 tsp sea salt.   The result was good, but not unbelievable. I did not taste the beans at all, even when trying to do so. It was slightly dry, which I think may be the result of using dark chocolate. If I try this again, I would experiment a little more and add a spoonful of instant espresso and possibly incorporate something else to add a bit moisture.

Um... awesome.  I didn't even make this because it was gluten free and served it to people who all can eat gluten.  It was amazing - and took about 3 minutes to whip up.  I heard someone at the party say "that's the person who brought the chocolate cake" and was asked for the recipe by 6 or 7 people.  didn't change a thing

This is probably the most unique and amazing recipe I have tried on this site!!! My niece is gluten intolerant and I am always looking for recipes to try for her! She and no  one else in my family could determine the secret ingredient. THIS TASTES AMAZING! The density is wonderful, has a cheesecake appeal. I am going to use the garbanzos as a base and maybe add white choco chips or butterscotch chips for a different kind of cake. To take this recipe over the top, I added the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (from this site) over the top and put chocolate dipped strawberries all around. YEAH!

Nice chocolate taste. Problem with mine was I don't have a food processor so I mashed the beans by hand. As hard as I tried there were still tiny chunks of garbanzo beans. So the texture was way off in my cake...... If I try again, I will use a softer bean (pinto or black beans). I've made  cakes with them before, and those have always mashed into the right consistency.

This has excellent flavor, but the texture is like a crumbled (yet strangely moist) brownie.  It was a HUGE hit with every age in our house tho!   Will def make again soon!! served with powdered sugar & strawberries.

We are new to gluten free living and this was a nice recipe to use because it doesn't call for specialty flours and other ingredients. Since it had all those chocolate chips and was only a 9" pan,  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and only used 3 eggs.  To be truly gluten free DO NOT DUST PAN WITH FLOUR!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe

This is an awesome recipe. I made it for a friend who hasn't had cake in years and she absolutely loved it! The only problem was that I couldn't seem to stop the cake from absorbing the icing sugar. Be careful because the recipe also says to flour the pan, which I did not do. I would instead suggest simply heavily greasing it, especially for those withmore sevre allergies. But overall a great cake!

Forget gluten-free: this cake is really good! My guests ate it up and their mouths dropped when they heard the secret ingredient - they've since termed it 'hummus pie', which they think is hysterical since they're Israeli. I'm now wondering about putting in half of the batter, a layer of chocolate chips and then pouring the rest of the batter for a hot lava cake kind of thing... I'll report back. ~UPDATE~ I tried creating the hot lava - didn't work out so well. If you really want to put A LOT of chocolate in the middle and warm it just before serving, possibly. I threw in a handful and it was good to have those little pockets of chocolate, but the lava wasn't flowin'... ~NOTE~ For truly gluten-free, DO NOT flour your pan with wheat flour!!

I threw it in the blender so my kids wouldn't notice pieces of bean in it. My husband is a diabetic & he really liked this. I used 1/4c Turbinado & 1/4 c Splenda for the white sugar. Also had a mix of dark choco chips, milk choco & semi-sweet. Served it with cook n serve sugar free choco pudding. That really made it delish!

I was skeptical about this cake but needed a gluten free dessert recipe. It came out so well and you couldn't taste the chick peas at all!! My guests loved it, even the pickiest eaters. The cake wasn't as smooth as I would have liked (it had a bit of a nutty texture) so I would puree the chick peas for longer if I make it again.

This cake was extremely easy to make. All ingredients we placed in a blender. I made this cake for Mother's Day for my sis-in-law who is allergic to gluten. She (and all the kids) loved the cake. It comes out much more dense and has a very fudgy consistecy. I realized I had only 15oz of Garbanzo beans so I added an additional 4 oz of Cream of Coconut (taking care that this was a gluten free variety) that I was using in a second cake I was making to replace the additional moisture. I think it helped to cut the bean taste and made for a rich, torte like cake. Very decadent but yummy!

Thank you thank you for giving a gluten free chocolate cake that surpasses any other I have ever tried. And the best part - the whole family loved it, even those that are not gluten sensitive, and they still don't know about the garbanzo beans! I also could not find a 19-oz can but I read somewhere that was about equal to 2 cups, so I did a 15 oz can and added applesauce to make the 2 cups. YUM!

Delicious! I cooked it at 375 degrees because of the altitude. I did not have a food processor, but mashing the beans with a fork worked just fine. I added vanilla, cinnamon, and chili powder for an extra kick.

This was not your typical cake texture.  It was more like a cheesecake texture.  With that said-my family didn't even know that it was gluten free.  I think that topping it with the powdered sugar and strawberries would have been yummy.  I didn't have any strawberries so I made chocolate frosting and it was great...a word of advice...cut small pieces it is rich!

I've made a few gluten-free brownies and chocolate cakes in my day but always with the packets from the health food store. I love them all but this is by far my most favorite EVER.   I used a 15 oz. can of garbanzo instead of 19oz. This probably worked to my advantage because it didn't taste like beans. It was just heavenly.   I made cupcakes for a friend's bachelorette party. 12 women and everyone of them wanted a seconds. This is definitely friendly for even the health-aphobics.

I made this with brown sugar blend Splenda and sugar free baking chips and it was good.  I baked it in a 10 inch silicone cake pan dusted with dry cocoa.  Since the silicone pans needs to be set in a cookie sheet for stability I added a couple of cups of hot water to the cookie sheet.  I want to try the applesauce next time to see if it is even moister while still being cooked through.  This one doesn’t call for butter and that is something some of my friends find more acceptable.

I added about a half cup of unsweetened applesauce to the batter, which kept the cake nice and moist.  This helped the texture so that it wasn't very crumbly and it held together well.

Who would have known?  I was looking for a gluten and dairy free cake for my grandson.  Most flourless cakes use butter.  This one doesn't.  Made this today before my younger visiter came.  It really is very good.  I haven't used any topping or frosting, but I may for him.  Thanks so much.

Unfortunately you can't find a 19 oz can of garbanzo beans anymore! I used the drained beans from one 15 oz can and 1/3 from another can. The chocolate flavor and texture were really good but I had to cook it 50 minutes before my knife came out clean and it was very fudgy in the center .

This is a great recipe! It was a big hit with our G.F. guests, all of the children and adults. I used parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and it was easy to transfer to a plate after cooling.

Wonderful cake. Thought the idea of making the cake with the beans was awesome, but you can still kind of tell.  Will try the regular way next time, but may still come back and make again.

Better than flour! I made this as a raspberry torte for a group of friends, one of whom was gluten intolerant, thinking that friend would appreciate being able to have dessert with the rest of us, even if it wasn't as good. Well, I don't even know if she got a slice. The group cleaned the plate, and demanded I bring it to every gathering!
Very easy with food processor, filled a 10 inch torte pan, and it baked perfectly. Mixed a pint of raspberries with small box prepared sugar free raspberry jello, filled the torte and served with whipped cream on the side. It was moist, chocolatey, and delicious..right down to the last crumb!
Thank you for this wonderful and easy recipe!

Fantastic!! I needed a desert for an event, I made this in a pie plate and served with raspberries. Everyone wanted the recipe, it is a rich chocolate taste with the added bonus of protein from the garbanzo beans.

I added 1 tsp vanilla and used a 15 oz can of beans.  This cake has a wonderfully smooth almost mousse-like texture and intense chocolate flavor (I used dark chocolate chips).  Excellent!!

it gets 5 stars from me because it's not the most decadent and wonderful chocolate cake we've ever tasted, but it deserves it considering its healthyness, easyness and general effect. I decided to give it a try having processed a great amount of beans to prepare hummus, so it was no big deal to reserve 2 cups for the dessert. I did it out of curiosity, as we don't particularly need a gluten-free cake, but my husband is allergic to every kind of nuts, and I can assure you that this cake consistency does remind you of something made with nuts. I had company and nobody detected the beans, so there... only improvement I think I could suggest would be the addition of more cocoa, to make it a bit more "dark" without increasing the calories

Just made this for a friend that has gluten allergies. 

I come from a large Mexican/ Italian family ... Who knew anything could be made without flour, much less a cake. :-) 

We're a family of eaters and when I invited my new friend over for lunch I thought "what the heck can I make, I have to feed her something. It's rude to have a guest over and not offer her something to eat"??? This is the way I was raised.

To my very pleasant surprise, I found this recipe, and not only wowed my friend but wowed my husband, too. It tasted SO good, I could not believe it didn't have any flour in it?!? I'm still shocked :-) 

I will definitely be making this again! This site never disappoints.

Best wheat-free recipe I've found yet! It tastes just like a fudge cake recipe I've made for years, so my wheat-intolerant son is happy. I followed the suggestions for adding 3 T. butter and 1 tsp.vanilla.  I also separated the eggs, whipped the egg whites until stiff and folded in at the end. It doesn't have that gluten-free taste like other baked goods. A real winner.

Gluten-free perfection!  Chocolately, light, slightly crumbly and can be enjoyed as is, with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or with a topping of your choice. My celiac friends as well as the non-celiacs love this cake.  I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and whipped it up with my immersion blender.  Fast, easy and delicious.

I gave this 5 stars not because it was the best chocolate cake I've ever had, but because it was pretty darn good for being made out of Garbanzo Beans and gluten free!!  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar (which was perfect for me).  We put sliced strawberries on top to make it prettier

REALLY good.  Mine did come out a bit crumbly, but I think that's because I ran out of eggs and had to use only 3 instead of the full 4.  Can't wait to try it again with the right amount of eggs.  Also very good with sliced strawberries on top.

Very good. Yes I would make it again. We could not taste garbanzo beans at all! I did follow others suggestions on a few things. Used a spring form pan. Cake cut perfectly into neat wedges. Used one less egg yolk and 1/2 cup sugar, to cut calories. It is very dense. sorta flat, Kinda like a fudgy brownie. Served with fat free Cool whip.

I have a friend who can only eat gluten free, and I wanted a dessert when she was coming over. I've never cooked gluten free before and needed something easy and quick with the ingredients I had on hand. This was PERFECT!!! I doubled it to feed her family and mine (14 people) plus leftovers. It was a huge hit. Three of my kids have asked for it for their birthday party. It is more brownie like in texture. I used one bag of milk chocolate and one bag of semi sweet. I did the garbanzo beans and eggs in the blender then poured it into the kitchen aid. Served with raspberry sherbet.

Wow this was surprisingly good! I had my doubts. I love garbonzo beans but garbonzo beans sounded a bit gross in a cake. So I made it after the flourless peanut butter cookies turned out so bad. This was super good! It was a little flaky and fell apart some when I took it out of the pan so I decided to frost it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe (minus vanilla) and add some christmas sprinkles. It went over well with the guests at the party. I would definitely make this again and its a semi healthy cake to boot =)

Really great cake.  I have a couple friends with gluten allergies and wanted to make them birthday cakes but not spend a fortune on the crazy flour alternatives.  This cake got rave responses from everyone who ate it.  However I've made this cake twice and BOTH times its stuck to the pan and broken apart!  I took the advice from previous posters about using cocoa powder and this does NOT work well.  I made sure to really coat the pan the second time and it still fell apart :(.  cake was still tasty--I suggest throwing in some chocolate chips to make it even more chocolaty

I have been making this cake for over 2 years now.  It is a staple in my kitchen.  I think it is a great way to have a healthy option for chocolate!  No one knows there are beans in it till I tell them!  I like it served warm best.  Thanks for your post!

I made this cake for my youngest daughter's birthday celebration with my in-laws. Most of my husband's family have been diagnosed with celiac disease and moist, tastey, gluten free cakes are hard to find. This recipe fits all three of these characteristics. The cake was so delicious, that I was asked to make it the following week for my nephew's (he's a celiac) birthday party. At the party, everyone raved about the cakes.

When I made this cake, I was expecting it to taste like chickpeas! Surprisingly, it didn't! But this cake did have a strange texture, it was really smooth, but tasted like regular chocolate cake. There was a lot of guesswork involved when making this, as we only had a very small food processor we could only do sections of the beans at a time. So if you want to follow this recipe to the Tee, your cling to have to have a large food processor!

OH MY GOSH!!!!   I tried this cake just because it was the very strangest thing I had ever heard of and was DELIGHTED by the flavor and consistency of the finished product!  As per other reviews, I upped the baking powder to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I used 2/3 dark chocolate and 1/3 milk chocolate just because I live in Egypt and can't buy semi-sweet chips in the store.  It was AMAZING!!!!  It had the consistency of a delicious fudge-y brownie cake and was very chocolate-y without being too sweet.  I'm not gluten intolerant and in fact, I don't even KNOW anyone who is, but I may never make a regular chocolate cake again!!  For those who say this is a good gluten-free replacement, I say this is a GREAT replacement regardless of gluten content!!

HELP!! Loved this so much but I have a question. All my stores only sell 15oz cans of garbanzos and measuring out the other 4oz makes this less convenient to throw together. How can I adjust it for 15oz cans? I have heard that baking is chemistry so I can't just change it without adjusting for the difference can I?

I followed one reviewer's suggestion and turned the recipe into cupcakes, and they're probably the best cupcakes I've eaten in a long time!  So moist!  I did add in about 1tbsp of Vanilla extract and I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao chocolate chips instead.  I'm going to have to make them again, and I may add a little coffee in next time.

Wow! This is the first recipe I've been compelled to review but I have got to say that this is one of the tastiest cakes I have ever tried. It's light and moist. The only change I made was using milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet because that's what I had on hand. A winner!

I have recently decided to reduce the amount of gluten and sugar in my diet so i was excited to find this recipe. I was a little scared to try it out, but im very glad i did. I did everything that recipe called for except i used toll house semi sweet chips because they had less grams of sugar. This cake came out so yummy. It was bit crumbly, which most gluten free desserts seem to be that way..but i loved it. My boyfriend and roommate loved it too

It was good but more like a brownie. I used dairy free chocolate chips instead topped off with fresh raspberries and whipped cream. Every one loved it.

I don't have a problem with gluten but I'm pregnant and trying to get extra protein/flour. As everyone else has said, this cake is amazing! You simply cannot believe you're eating beans and not flour! I only added 1/3 c sugar and that was plenty sweet.

This is an excellent recipe.  Cannot understand why anyone would say it tastes like garbanzo beans.  Baked for 35 minutes rather than 40.  Topped with thawed frozen cherries, and powdered sugar.  Absolutely fabulous!

This was delicious! I would never have though it could taste so amazing without flour and butter but it did! I made them in little mini muffin pans to keep portion control down when eating them (baked at 350 for 15 min). Next time I'll plan to blend it a little longer in my food processor but that was user error.

This recipe is so quick and easy, and my family loved it. The kids both asked for seconds and didn't even know it was gluten free. My husband and I both liked that it is not too overly sweet.

Wow!  So far it has passed the "warm" test and am completely amazed it has garbanzo beans.
I first put the beans in the processor and processed until well broken down.  Then I added the eggs and processed until smooth. 
As another poster said, this is like a dense brownie.  I think if you wanted to make it lighter you could whip some egg whites up and fold them in.  The only added ingredient I put in was chili powder.  I added 1/2 tsp but next time I may go for 1 tsp or even chipotle powder.  I am just amazed at the taste with no flour!  Now I just have to see if if pasts the day old test.

this was fantastic, i had everyone at dinner begging for me to give them the recipe!! very rich, and dense and moist! the only thing i would say i didnt like was that the chick pea "shell" didnt blend up very nicely, BUT it took on the consistency of coconut, which is always good!!

DELICIOUS. I made them for my friend who has a gluten allergy, but I tweaked it a little. 3/4tsp of baking powder and added a little vanilla. I made cupcakes; baked for 23 minutes and they came out fluffy and amazing. Taste like brownies!

I only had a 16 ounce can of garbanzo beans so that was all I used.  We are not a gluten-free family so this recipe had to hold up to standard scratch cakes.  It did that with flying colors.

Very chocolately and moist... definitely take previous suggestions and add:  a teaspoon vanilla, a tsp almond extract or espresso powder for a bit more flavor, and some melted butter/oil (I used ~3 T of melted earth balance).  I made cupcakes and added an extra 1/2 tsp baking powder as well so they'd be a bit more fluffy.  They came out not very sweet so will be better with some frosting.  If eating on their own, I might add a bit more sugar or would definitely dust with powdered sugar.  May try peeling the beans to make the texture smoother and/or upping the chocolate a bit as other suggestions next time.  A keeper!

I am stunned that this turned out so good. For me, 40 minutes turned out to be too long in the oven - the inner part of the cake was deliciously moist, but the outer part a bit dry.  So next time I'll just shorten the baking time.  I also couldn't find a 19 oz can of beans and didn't want to mess with opening a second can so I only used 15oz of beans and it seems to have worked just fine. (Maybe that's contributing to the dryness, however?) Anyways, the only other flourless cake I'd ever made that I liked was the Flourless Chocolate Cake I on this site (and it's delicious!), but it's not very cake-like. So when I'm in the mood for a real cake-like chocolate cake, I'll be making this from now on! Plus it's much healthier, since the other calls for 6 eggs and 2 sticks of butter...

I tried this cake after reading all the positive reviews, but it did  not measure up.  The chocolate flavor was nice, but it came out way too dry.  I will say that the batter was delicious.  I would probably add oil if I tried this recipe again and reduce the baking time.

Oh my goodness! This is magic!!! I was very sceptical about the goodness of this cake but it is absolutely gorgeous! You must try it if you are considering it! Makes for a pretty and high protein dessert for those of you who are vegan, just make sure the choco. chips are dairy free!  I left out the sugar, cut down to three eggs, and "floured" the pan with cocoa. Came out beautifully!

This cake was surprisingly delicious. I frosted with chocolate coolwhip and fresh raspberries. One comment though: the recipe is definately not gluten-free, it says to flour the pan! I greased mine and dusted with baking cocoa to keep it Celiac friendly.

I made this for my coworkers. One of my coworkers is gluten intolerant and another is vegan (which makes for difficult baking). This cake was great. I substituted applesauce for the eggs to make it vegan and it worked very well.

Fabulous texture and really good flavor!  I had trouble getting it out of the pan the first time I made it, so I put a waxed paper circle into the buttered & cocoa dusted pan today and it came out very easily.  I would like it to be a little more intense on the chocolate flavor and will experiment with adding some cocoa.  My can of beans was 1 3/4 cups, so I might use 2 cups that I cook from dry beans and add 1/4 c cocoa next time.

awesome! i'm doing a low fructose diet also so i didn't add any of the sugar, just 1/2 tsp of stevia powder, only 3 large eggs and a little extra garbanzo beans - 22oz total in a 10inch sq pan. turned out great!!! however, i have a convection oven and it was a bit dry after only 35 minutes - i'd say 30 MIN MAX in a convection at 350.  Thank you CCummins!!!!!

Everyone enjoyed this cake.  I worried about crumbliness so added 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Also added  1 tsp. vanilla and used 6 squares unsweetened bakers chocolate as had no chips on hand.  Greased a 8" square pan with coconut oil and cut into 16 brownies.  I blended really well in a food processor and texture was smooth.  Daughter said she could taste chickpea, but son and I could not.  We cut out brownies horizontally and spread with homemade strawberry jam in middles and tops.  Daughter said this took away the bean taste she could taste.  The strawberry jam/filling we make is merely a 600g bag of frozen strawberries, one heaping tablespoon tapioca granules, and 1/4 cup organic sugar brought to a boil and simmered for two minutes then mashed with a potato masher.  This jam keeps about 3 weeks in fridge.  Next time will try this as a sandwich cake with ice cream filling and jam topping.  Will also be looking at how to reduce sugar, perhaps by using one half pitted dates and half sugar.  Definitely a keeper, thanks!

Extremely rich and not at all garbanzo-bean tasting! I followed the suggestions of a few others and added a tsp of vanilla to the recipe. While it was certainly tasty, it does not have much "sight appeal" so I made a chocolate ganache and used some raspberries that to make it look better... the result was an even richer tasting cake than before. Definitely a keeper particularly because I don't feel as bad about eating this cake as I do others!

My mom is very, very hard to cook for because she is allergic to so much and doesn't really like sweets. I made this cake for her birthday (less than 2 months ago)and she gobbled it up. Since then, we've made it at least 12 times and have also done it three times with carob chips instead of chocolate (no caffeine). Also comes out great! My mom is a slim person, but last time we made it, she ate over half of the cake in one sitting...That's how incredible it is!  It's best if you refrigerate it a few hours before serving so that the texture is more like cheesecake.  Beautiful if topped with raspberries.  BEST recipe I've EVER discovered.

This is awesome! It tastes delicious. My kids love it. It's rich and high in protein. You would never know it's made with garbanzo beans. I've tried to double this recipe twice, because it's so good and not enough to share, but it never works out. Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars!

This is pretty good for a cake made of beans.  I made this into a dozen cupcakes and baked for about 22 minutes.  It's super sweet though, hence the four stars.  I didn't get the crumbly texture some got.  They were moist.  Next time I think I'll add more chocolate and decrease the sugar.

For not being able to eat cake this was heavenly. Made it twice so far and can't figure out how to not have it fall apart b/c it's a tad dry.  But super good.  Dad and I both celiac.  Will keep experimenting and let you know.

This is my "go to" recipe for party cakes now - it's delicious and fun to surprise guests when they find out it is filled with garbanzo beans! My first tries were a little dry, though, so I've started adding a medium sized, ripe, mashed banana and it is much more moist. It also has a wonderful hint of banana in the taste!

I love this recipe!  I've made this cake twice now.  The garbanzo beans give the cake a moist but semi-dense texture.  The cake is also really easy to make... just throw everything in a blender!

I am able to eat gluten, and still thought this was through the roof delicious.  It's so simple, I've recommended it to 2 gluten-free friends.  The only thing I did was add a little vanilla. The 2 teenagers from my church douldn't even tell anything was different about it!

I've impressed many a friend since I discovered this recipe.  Moist, not too sugary, and delicious. Tasted best after cooling in the refrigerator.

This is a really great cake.  I used milk chocolate as that was all I had.  Next time I will try a darker chocolate & I am sure it will be even better!  I didn't tell anyone it was made with chick peas & no one could guess they were in it.  This is a very moist cake & I would encourage anyone to make it.  Many thanks to the submitter for an easy and decadent way to use chick peas, who would of ever thought?

I had 1 cup of overcooked chickpeas that I wanted to use up, and this turned out to be a most amazing way to do that! I didn't make any changes, but, like other testers, I may try adding vanilla next time around. After baking I cut up the cake and put it in the freezer (as I do for all GF baking.) When I took a piece out to munch on the next day,straight from the freezer, I realized that it not only tasted great, it's texture was just like the outside of an ice-cream sandwich!  I split the cake into to halves, grabbed some ice cream out of the freezer and made that ice-cream sandwich.  I was not disappointed!

I'm not Gluten-intolerant, so I don't know how this compares to other gluten free recipes, but I did not like this cake!  I thought it tasted chalky and the bean flavour came through.

This is hardly your typical gluten free cake! It was So moist and very much like a brownie. I did add butter to the chosolate chips and may cut down the sugar next time -only so my 1 yr old can eat it too! Don't stop the Awesome!

Wonderful recipe! I have Celiacs disease and am also a vegetarian, so any extra non-animal protein I can incorporate into my diet is great! The cake isn't "beany" at all, but had a mildly nutty flavor and VERY chocolaty. I tried it out on my parents who both weren't thrilled with the idea of eating a cake with a main ingredient of garbanzo beans, until they tasted it. They loved it! It was a tad bit dry, so perhaps adding a touch of oil, applesauce, or butter next time to moisten it up a bit. The recipe called for more than enough sugar, so I would recommend shortening it to a half cup or even a third instead of three quarters. Over all, the cake was fabulous and I can definitely see myself making this over and over again in the future.

Somehow, I happened to stumble upon this recipe and was curious about it. The reviews all seemed to say good things so I decided to try it. This chocolate cake is great! I LOVE that its made from garbonzo beans because you get more nutritional benefits compared to regular flour. The taste is good once they have cooled. So, let the cool completley and enjoy!

This was so good and EASY.  I do not bake typically.  (Hate to measure.)  I made this for my mom's birthday, and everyone was totally surprised it was garbanzo beans.  Ha!  It was wonderful with fresh raspberries on it.

Super duper easy to make. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon (McCormick is gluten free) and a teaspoon of vanilla (Kroger brand is gf) to mask some of the garbanzo bean flavor.

Wow! I had no idea how this would turn out, but I followed the recipe to the letter and got a wonderfully rich, moist cake! Yes, it's more brownie-like in texture, but that's because it's flourless. All flourless chocolate cakes are rich and dense. The bean taste is slight and almost imperceptible. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Surprisingly FANTASTIC!!!  This is my entire family's new favorite chocolate cake.  I was actually just searching for a cake made without oil or butter and came across this, which was also great since I've been needing a gluten free chocolate cake recipe.  Like some of the other members, I was kind of skeptical but verious curious to see how this cake turned out.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is amazingly chocolatey and decadent.  I love to have people try and guess the secret ingredient and they are always shocked when I tell them (no one ever gets it right).  This recipe makes good cupcakes too, but they are a bit crumbly.  I made a ganache frosting for the cupcakes and i was delicious!  GREAT RECIPE!!!  I've make it 5-6 times now and the requests keep coming.

extremely chocolate, but not sweet at all, texture was not cakelike at all.  not bean like, but not cake like.  like chocolate falaffel, and not in a good way. Perhaps better with a different bean.

with out a doubt the best recipe ever!! I am amazed at how good this cake is.  I have served it with greek yogurt - so good.  I also made some chocolate custard for the kids to have with this cake as a real treat ( 3 egg yolks, 2 tblsps cornflour 2 tblsp maple syrup 1 tblsp cocoa powder and 3 cups milk)  They could not guess the secret ingredient, and I did not tell them until they had eaten it several times and still wanted more.

What a great way to get some fiber in!  The cake is rich and grainy - very dense - like a brownie.  There is no way you can taste the chickpeas in it - I fooled everyone here!  They gobbled it up like vultures!

Absolutely fabulous!  Since my can of beans was only 15 ounces, I opted to omit one egg.  I dusted the pan with cocoa powder after it had been greased.  Mine was done in less than 35 minutes, so my oven must run hot.  I think this tastes best after it's been refrigerated for several hours.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Amazing cake! It came out great and it was a huge hit with anyone who has tried! Who would have thought garbanzo beans could be made into a cake! As I read in the other reviews, I added 5 tblsps butter to the melted chocolate and 1 tsp vanilla. With the sugar I used the 1 tsp of baking powder. I think that makes a big difference in how well it comes out. I highly recommend this to those who are gluten intolerant like me!

This cake is excellent. I used dark chocolate and went by weight rather than volume. Also: 10oz. of soy milk and a nice sized slice blended smooth makes like the best chocolate protein smoothie ever.

Delicious! You should keep feeling the texture with the garbonzo beans. It just takes timeto get them smooth adding the sugar helps break them down too.

I saw this recipe and knew I had to try it.  I was skeptical but intrigued.  It turned out so well.  My kids loved it.  My husband looked at me like I was crazy when I told him what was in it but ate several slices.  It is also so easy to make which is an added bonus.  I did not make any changes.

I loved this recipe.
I did add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
So much for my supply of garbanzo beans, going toward making hummus.The cans will be divided between this cake & hummus now.
Who knew that using beans could make such a great cake???
I like it better than regular chocolate cake.
I sliced fresh strawberries over the cake.
My husband was leery of it but admitted it was great.
We have family & friends who are gluten intolerant and it will be nice to have something special for them, that is, if there is any left after others get a taste of it.

I really loved this recipe as written.  I had to blend things with a blender and it made no difference.  The cake was light and delicious.  Next time, I will add raspberries to the confectioners sugar.  Yummy!

This turned out good and the tastes is great. I melted my chocolate with 1/4 cup of olive oil and added 1 tsp of baking powder and vanilla. Yummie :)

I can't believe people called the cake  dry!  This is a fantastic recipe, which I had to try because who puts beans in chocolate cake?  People who know how to cook! I will definitely make this again.

This is incredibly delicious and chocolatey. I used 60% cocoa Ghiradelli chips. Used my Vitamix blender to mix ingredients. Was a very firm, almost cheesecake like texture. Yummy with vanilla bean frozen yogurt.

The second time I made this I had no garbanzo beans so used pinto beans.   I had them in the freezer, from cooking a bag of dried beans and it was just as good as the garbanzo beans.  May need a little more sweetener with the pinto beans.  I am not a sweet eater so I always cut the sugar back, but that is simply a personal preference.  Be sure to blend very well.  I just used my Ninja that has a bowl for this kind of thing.

This "Garbanzo Bean Chocolate Cake" was delicious.  No one believes me when I tell them this cake is made with a can of garbanzo beans instead of flour.

This was pretty good. I added a tablespoon of cocoa powder. The same day it had good cake texture, but the next (after being cover with cling-wrap overnight) it was much more fuggy. NEXT TIME: this time I used 1 tsp baking powder and it was much more cake like. I made it as an alternative gluten-dairy free birthday cake, and it was all gone! After cooling I used big metal cookie cutters for cute single-serve hearts.

Fantastic!!! It was so chocolately and moist...the whole family loved it!! I could not find a 19 oz can of garbanzo beans... grocery store carried 15 oz and I was too cheap/ lazy to use part of a second can. So, technically, my cake lacked 4 oz of garbanzo beans but it was still SO GOOD! I will definitely be making this cake again! And I might open a second can of beans!!

WOW!!!  This was absolutely amazing!!  My three boys LOVED it and said that it was the best chocolate cake they had ever tasted.  I put some strawberries on top - following the suggestion of one reviewer, but I think that I would leave them off the next time. The boys suggested some sliced bananas, and those did taste good.  Nothing else is needed to make this a great cake, but I think that I may experiment with making a peanut butter glaze for the top next time.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Excellent.  Who would have thought chickpea in cake.  We make this for gluten free friends and just for ourselves.  Nice rich cake but healthy.

Yes, tried, it. It was alright but, needs one more egg + 1 full tsp baking powder to improve the texture + make it fluffy. Also, you list the protein value as very low when in actuality it is well over 23%.

Ok so I needed these to be cupcakes for my party, so I followed the recipe with the advise from the reviewer before me (added 5Tbs butter, 1tsp baking powder, and 1tsp vanilla) and it took close to 35min in the oven to be done. They came out dense and not risen like brownies so I told everyone they were "brownie cupcakes" and they loved it. Next time I will try it with less or no vanilla. Very rich. Also make sure you have a good quality food processor because mine left them grainy so I had to run them through the blender to smooth them out. No one knew they were made with garbanzos or gluten free. My husband said "I thought you were making something with chick peas" as he are it and had no idea. They tasted best a day and a half later.

I was looking to make a dessert for my mother in law ( gluten free) and found this recipe. I just added 1/4 cup of butter and changed to 1 tsp baking powder. It came out so moist. My husband and kids want to eat it all. Can't tell that it was made with chick peas. Wow.

My kids have to avoid dairy, gluten and corn so this recipe has been a life saver for our family ESP for birthdays! People can't believe it's beans!!!!!!!! Most baking powder has corn starch holding it together so I make my own with measurements of baking soda & cream of tarter. So grateful for this recipe! God bless

I found this recipe, made it, and loved it!  My husband even liked it and he doesn't like anything that is healthy.  It will become one of my favorite gluten free chocolate cakes from now on!  Next time I'm going to try it with a little peppermint flavoring as I love chocolate and mint together.  What a treat.  I found this same recipe on another site recently, and it says that 1 - 9" cake gets 12 servings.  This helps alot with my daily caloric allowance.

This cake was so easy to make. I read the reviews before attempting because they are usually helpful and have good advice. I used dark chocolate morsels. I was going to add vanilla like some reviews suggested but forgot. It was very chocolatey and delicious anyway, I will try the vanilla next time. The density and size is similar to that of a cheesecake so you might want to double the recipe and stack two with a filling in between if you are taking it to a party. I don't have doilies so I used paper stencils with powdered sugar to make it pretty for Easter. It was a hit : )

I really, really wanted to love this recipe.  [Good-for-you-yet-delicious chocolate cake?  Who wouldn't want that to be a real thing?]  Unfortunately, mine turned out weirdly-chewy; and there was a faint bean-y flavor.  I won't make this again.

Just tried this recipe and it's very good. We are not a gluten free family but have friends who are. I did follow the advice of others on the site and did make a few changes. I peeled the chick peas (garbanzo beans), added a tbsp of butter to the melting chocolate and a tbsp of cocoa powder to mix. I also baked it in a 9x9 square baking pan that was lined with foil and generously sprayed with cooking spray. No problems at all in removing this cake. I only gave it 4 stars because of all the changes I made.

This is a great cake! I was a little skeptical, but originally made it for dinner at a friend's with celiac. A few weeks later my son had a birthday party and I made it for that as a friend of his has a gluten allergy. The kids loved it, I love it, it is easy to make - it is now one of my favorite desserts even though my family doesn't have any eating restritions. Highly recommend!

I know I'm guilty of reading others' reviews and never post my own so I guess I should do one on this cake, because it was fabulous. I didn't have a 19 oz can of garbanzos, so I used the 15 oz can.  I took others' advice and cooked the garbanzo beans first, then I removed the skin off of the beans.  The only change I made was adding Agave Nectar syrup instead of sugar and I topped it with cherry pie filling and whipped cream.  Absolutely delicious.

I have been "sitting" on this recipe for about 1 year. I have given it to people but had not made it until last night. 
Super easy. Fast and I was quite surprised at how good it was.  I made a ganache just in case the cake was a bit dry. I did  not have to use it although we did just cuz ganache is so darned good! My niece is one of many that can not have wheat and this was for her birthday and it did not fail. Now I am wondering how it would be with dark chocolate chips rather than semi sweet....and maybe white chocolate I am just concerned about the color with white chocolate (any ideas would be welcome)

Awesome! I recently went on a wheat free diet so finding desserts without it is tough. I made these for a meeting at my work and everyone raved over it! It was dense and more like a brownie than a cake, but just awesome! I put Cool Whip on top and crushed up toffee pieces. I will for sure make this again!! Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

I tried this and I was thrilled to find out how easy it is to make. When serving,I drizzled chocolate sauce and carmel on top so it would look like something from a gourmet restaurant.

Recipe was awesome, comes out tasting like a brownie!  Biggest tip is to make sure to shell the garbanzos/chick peas before putting them in the food processor.  Just like making hummus, shelling the chick peas makes for a creamy, smooth texture, not grainy at all.  To shell them, just squeeze them lightly and pop them out of their shells -- time consuming, but totally worth it.  Other trick I used was to swap out some of the semi-sweet chips for a Hershey's Special Dark bar I picked up at the register of the supermarket.

This is great!  I substituted honey for sugar and it still turned out great!  It tastes just like a flourless chocolate cake.  I try to reduce my wheat intake and love experiementing with garbanzo beans and this is a great recipe.  If you want to eat healthier, but still want dessert, this is the way to do it.  A nice ganache wouldn't be bad either with equal parts chocolate and heavy cream, slowly heated until melted either!

Edit: The frosting also had a bit of melted butter in it! I don't measure much, just added a tablespoon or so until I got the consistency I wanted.

Just made this recipe after being very skeptical about baking with chickpeas! It turned out very delicious but a little bit dry! I made some adjustments to make it a bit "healthier"! I used organic honey in place of the refined sugar (1/2 cup and 2 tbsp) also I used only 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips (plus 1/2 cup and 2 tbsp cocoa powder). For some added flavour I added a splash of vanilla and some instant coffee powder as well! It tastes very good and chocolatey! I will serve it up with a dollop of whip cream and some homemade raspberry sauce!

Easy and scrumptious recipe for chocolate lovers, and, oh yeah...it's gluten free as well.  My daughter and I are both gluten intolerant and I was looking for a quick, but rich tasting dessert.  When I saw the title of this recipe my first thought was, "You have got to be kidding me!"   However, since it had such good reviews, I figured I'd give it a try.  The recipe was very easy to follow and contained ingredients I always keep around.  Instead of powdered sugar, I sprinkled gold sugar sprinkles and served the cake with whipped cream and iced berries.  It looked like a cake, smelled like a cake, and tasted like a cake.  Both my husband and son were shocked that it was made with chick peas as they thought I had made a brownie cake.  I would not hesitate to serve this again even if my guests don't have a gluten problem.

this was delicious.  I think next time though, I'll add some applesauce to make it more fudgey.  This was dense and flaky, but good.

Made as printed in recipe. As others suggested I washed well, in fact I removed the hulls from each bean.  Came out perfect!  Served with Fresh Strawberry Sauce from this site and fresh whipped cream.  Ala mode the nextr day with vanilla ice cream. The cake itself is not very sweet.  I used a combo of semi sweet and dark chocolate chips.

Delicious! I did follow other reviewers by microwaving the beans in their own liquid for about 6 minutes.  Rinsed in cold and then added the step of snapping the peel off each bean.  I know!!...a little time-consuming but that day I had the time (and patience).  Beans only took a minute or two to become completely smooth.   Made about 4 dozen mini muffins which were done in 15 minutes. Topped with Lite cherry filling.  Very Good!

Amazingly decadent!!  I made this cake twice...the first time, I made the mistake of increasing the heat in my oven to 375c because I read a few reviews and they said it took a lot longer to cook...well, sorry but that didn't work for me. It was a bit dry and I felt it over cooked a bit but it was very good tasting. So, the second time, I used dried garbanzo,  which I soaked for a day and half, then I cooked them in boiling water for a couple hours until I felt they were soft enough.  I used maple syrup instead of sugar, and I used dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. I doubled the baking powder and that's it.  Baked it in a spring-form pan for exactly 37 minutes (because my pan was a bit wider) at 350c this time.  Well let me tell you...this cake is unbelievable!! No one could ever guess it's made with chickpeas...I swear it tastes even better than any other chocolate cake you could make and there's no butter no oil no milk...way less calorie-dense and nutritious. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. It's a keeper!

I made this for the second time today.  I read a review that said they accidentally omitted the sugar and it still tasted great...well they were right. I omitted the sugar and added 1tsp vanilla and in increased the baking powder to 1tsp and it was delicious!  I made a second batch with a tsp of almond extract and it was yummy too.  My daughter is taking them for her birthday treat for her class tomorrow.  I used 2 cUps of chick peas I cooked instead of canned.

I tried this because I have been searching for a cake that I can eat with my 53 food allergies. We started making it, and I have to say, it smelled just awful in the food processor. I wasn't sure I actually wanted to go through with it. But, I really wanted cake. So we continued making it. Once out of the oven, it smelled delicious and rich. We let it cool and instead of powdered sugar, we drizzled Torani Dark Chocolate syrup over it. It was fabulous! Like death by chocolate fabulous. I found my new birthday cake! It's been 4 years since I actually got to eat a cake for my birthday and now I am eagerly awaiting my birthday so I can have cake on my birthday again!

This is an amazing cake but only served the next day. I made it twice - the first time I served it the next day and it was extremely impressive. The second time, I made it in the morning and served it for dessert. Even when I had a piece I was really disappointed. The next day it was absolutely delicious. MADE BETTER BY: Use the whole package of chocolate chips and reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup, add a few heaping tablespoons of cocoa and 1/4 tsp of almond extract!!

This was simple and amazing!  A few changes based on other reviewers: 1) I added a full bag of chocoloate chips 2) I added about 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and 1Tbsp Kahlua.  I also used a springform pan.  I expected a dense cake, but it came of out the oven taller than I expected and then gradually deflated as it cooled.  My guests raved about it and no once could detect the bean taste.

I am gluten intolerant and a friend made this for me as a dessert for a casual dinner. It is fabulous and everyone gobbled it up so fast I was lucky to get a piece! The texture is dense but not too dense, the chocolate flavor is deep, but not too deep, and the fact that there is more protein and far less fat than in a normal cake makes it more friendly to carb watchers/diabetics. She served it with a light dusting of confectioners sugar and surrounded it with fresh strawberries--a beautiful presentation fit for the fanciest of dinner parties.

I made this today and its just awesome. I tried various gluten free cakes, but it always taste like sand. This one is sooo different, smooth and creamy, more a dessert than a cake and will be nice with cream, ice cream or custard. I used 200 grams of dark chocolate and melt it together with 3 T butter. I also grind the beans in my thermomix until very fine and then add the sugar, grind it again and then add the eggs one at a time.
Next time round ( and there will definitely be more than one next time) I will use less chocolate - maybe 150g - 75g dark chocolate and 75g normal or white chocolate and leave out the sugar. The cake was just a bit too sweet for me. 
I will keep this as my secret recipe and will not give the secret ingredient the garbanzo beans away. What I also like about this recipe is the fact that it uses less eggs than other gluten free cake recipes.
This is definitely a keeper.

I made a big change in that I replaced the garbanzo beans with super firm tofu. It rocked! This saved me on calories and gave this a big boost of protein. I had to extend the cooking time by about 10 minutes in order to allow all the moisture to evaporate. I will make this again!

Very good cake. I took another reviewer's advice and removed the skins from the beans. I let the cooked cake sit in the fridge overnight and it came out with a fudge cake consistency. My husband loves cherry pie but can't eat the crust so I made the filling (Cherry Pie III from allrecipies.com) and used it as a topping. With whipped cream it tasted like Black Forest. It was a Happy Thanksgiving!

This cake is Amazing!  I made it for my 1 year olds birthday and the kid who hates beans shovelled it in by the handful.    it worked well in a train cupcake mold.  I did find it on the sweet side so next time i will add less sugar.  I followed advice from another review and added 1tsp baking powder and butter to the melting chocolate.  I added vanilla but next time I will add Creme de Cocoa for extra deliciousness.

I received a number of compliments for this recipe.  It was moist, had easy clean up, and tasted very good. I made a few changes, I used egg substitute for one of the eggs it turned out fine so I might try using it for two eggs next time, I used one 16oz can of garbanzo beans instead of a 19oz can, and I used a blender instead of a food processor.  It was a great success and enjoyable.  - Don't dust the cake and quickly after cover with saran wrap.  I did this, and when I went to unwrap and serve it the design had disappeared into the cake. Wrapping the cake keeps moisture at the perfect amount, so wait till after you unwrap for serving to sprinkle powder sugar. - Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was definitely not good, if you look at my reviews I almost always review Excellent.
It still definitely tasted like it was bean based...not my favourite gluten free recipe.

i've been making this recipe for YEARS now and it is DELICOUS.  I usually make it a bit healthier by using 1 egg and 3 egg whites and fake sugar.  I usually also add a little vanilla and some instant coffee powder.  I've been experimenting with using cocoa powder, applesauce, and some additional sweetner to futher healtify it... but it's great, everyone is always SHOCKED when i tell them it's chickpeas!

I did not care for this recipe. I'm baffled. I followed the recipe implicitly.  It turns out more like a brownie in texture, not a cake.

I cook gluten free only due to celiacs, and I make healthy chocolate cake by using almond meal and whole grain brown rice flour, applesauce, and skipping the sugar, that doesn't taste like a bean cake. No one cared for this.

I used a 15 oz. can of Garbanzo beans, because we couldn't find a 19 oz. one, and added about 3 tbsp of cornstarch (to help make up the difference). I also shelled the Garbanzo beans, by microwaving them in water until they were warm, draining them, and pulling off the shells by hand. Instead of chocolate chips, we used 2.75ish bars of Valrhona 71% chocolate. Other than these things, we followed the recipe exactly as written (aside from taking it out of the oven 6 minute early). 

The verdict? It cut easily, it was perfectly smooth, it wasn't crumbly, but it didn't taste chocolately and it was dry. It wasn't sweet at all, so it's perfect for those who don't like sweet desserts. 

For future attempts, I will likely add some vanilla extract and a few tablespoons of butter, as well as possibly some coconut oil or even peanut butter. Maybe even some cream cheese...?

Tried it tonight... melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness!  I would compare the consistency to a brownie.  I topped it with a mixture of chopped pecans and brown sugar and it turned out nice. :)

IN-credible.  Since I've been gluten free, I've made black bean brownies a couple of times & they were ok...not great but not terrible.  But THIS...this was the most delicious, chocolatey goodness.  Thanks for sharing it!

Definitely needs more chocolate chips -- at least 2 cups.  I added the Satiny Chocolate Glaze, definitely helped.

Oh my....not very good at all!  Out of 8 of us only 1 liked this recipe:-(  I don't particularly care for canned beans so I used another reviewers suggestion and soaked dried ones overnight.  I also added vanilla and it just was not good.  I don't know about all those raving reviews but everybody has different taste I guess.

This is a delicious flourless chocolate cake. People seemed to really enjoy it whether they are on a g-free diet or not. This was a dense and moist cake. To serve 12 people the serving sizes are pretty small, but it's rich enough that it seems ok. 

I followed the recipe exactly (using 2 cups of garbanzo beans as I could not find a 19 oz can). Some people have mentioned making additions or substitutions, but frankly, it doesn't need it. I don't plan to make any changes the next time I make it. 

The only thing I changed was the topping. Just confectioners sugar sounded a little plain. I topped it with chopped pecans and drizzled caramel over the top. It was great!

I thought it was a little on the dry side.  Also, had trouble getting it out of the cake pan.  Maybe I didn't grease it enough.  My guest who is gluten intolerant thought it was wonderful and asked for the recipe.

I was looking for a gluten free cake to serve for my sons graduation party. I chose this recipe due to the star rating. I tried it this weekend to see if it would pass the taste test. I did not sway from the recipe. My whole family loved it and everyone that came over to my house I had sample it, they loved it as well. I will definitely be serving this to my gluten free guests at my sons graduation party.

Update: To substitute dried chickpeas for the 19 oz can, use 3/4 cup of the dried variety, soaked per package instructions.  
Wow!  This was so good!  I have celiac disease so must eat gluten free, and this is the first cake I've had anywhere (including home-made, restaurant, bakery, cruise ship) that is as good as a regular cake. The rest of the family liked it too.  It's more like a moist brownie than cake, but it's delicious!  I cut the servings to 9 to automatically recalculate the recipe for the smaller size can of beans and 3 eggs instead of 4, and I made this smaller size in a loaf pan.  No changes except the size.  It was a little more crumbly than standard cake or brownies, but not annoyingly so.

The best recipe I ever got from Allrecipes! We've made it several times and will again today. I used a smaller can of chickpeas than the 19 oz and it came out just fine. We try different sweeteners each time  like powdered agave, palm sugar, and the choc chips make it sweet enough to leave out any other sweetener .  Once we tried it with just egg whites and that was okay. We tried it with butterscotch chips once and white choc chips another time. The original Chocolate chip version IS the best. Thanks for a new family favorite.

Wow!  Chocolaty, moist, just my thing!  To make it healthier I used 1 cup Stevia instead of 3/4 cup sugar and a cup of Egg Beaters instead of the eggs.  I also threw in one square of unsweetened chocolate with the semisweet chips.  I made a dozen cupcakes with the batter and had some left over.  I decided to microwave the remainder for about a minute.  Turned out just fine!

This was an excellent cake, but I did serve it as brownies. It was much easier to serve as the cake seemed to fall apart when slicing.
I made this recipe twice. Both times I did the recipe exactly as written, but the second time I did process the beans first a little longer and then added the eggs. That seemed to make the beans less noticable for me.
I took this to my sons house for desert and my 3 year old granddaughter just loved the brownies.

SO YUMMY! My 6 year-old son says he likes it better than regular cake. No one can believe it is made of garbanzo beans. I will definitely be making this over and over and over. I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand so I used a Hershey's bar and some Hershey's drops and lowered the white sugar to 1/4 cup.

Uh....this is NOT 229 calories.  I used a separate calorie counter AND I dubbed egg whites for the whole eggs and my recipe still came out 10 cal more!  How can that be when I used whites?  Beware!
The good news is, it tastes really good.

I have been making this recipe for the past couple of years (and actually made one tonight) and it never ceases to amaze people when I tell them the main ingredient is chickpeas!  I made a couple of changes to make it a bit healthier, which inlcuded using only 1/2 c. sugar and 2 eggs and 3 egg whites.  Always delicious and this GF household loves them!

This is a moist, chocolate-y, and dense cake. I'm glad it's not like other gluten-free, flour-less cakes that require a ton of butter. You won't taste the beans at all. No changes needed!

Mmmm. I was seriously nervous to try this recipe, and have now made it half a dozen times. My body feels happier getting good high protein goodness, and my tongue gets a sweet, fudgy, chocolatey treat. I serve it with a chocolate glaze. Thanks for the great recipe.

Really good...more like a cakey brownie than actual cake as it sank a lot after cooling, but was quite tasty.  Didn't taste beany at all.  I would definitely add the vanilla suggested in other reviews and top with strawberries/raspberries/whipped cream.  Tasty and relatively healthy!

ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!!! Used Carob instead of chocolate as I have problems with caffeine. Moist and delicious, blended everything in my Ninja, no taste of bean at all. 1/2 recipe as I did not have enough carob chips, made 8 cupcakes, topped them with sliced almonds before i put in the oven for 23 minutes at 350 degrees. THANK YOU for posting this recipe CCUMMINS.

Delicious!  This is a moist cake with an excellent texture and not overly sweet. With no butter or oil ingredients and chickpeas rather than flours or almond meal it makes a healthy inexpensive gluten free alternative.

I made mini-cupcakes and they are delicious.  I substituted flaxseed/water mixture, 1 banana and 1 cup no sugar applesauce for the 4 eggs.  I substituted 1/4 cup honey for the sugar.  I added half cup more of dark chocolate chips to make up for the 4 oz. lacking in my can of beans.  I also added 1 tsp real vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of baking soda (to cut down acidity from honey).  My only problem is the cupcakes are hollow in the center.  Very moist and sweet and I love the dark chocolate flavor and cannot taste the beans at all.  I removed the skin from the beans and had no problem with graininess.

I was amazed at how good this is! I'm going to give this recipe to all my friends who are trying to eat healthy. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and to make it more healthy substituted the sugar with splenda, used egg beaters for 2 of the eggs and dark chocolate chips. I was awesome! I loved it and hope you can post more healthy recipes like this.

Good considering the ingredients (flour-less, butter-less recipe) but I'm going to stick with real chocolate cake...something along the lines of a decadent German chocolate cake. I followed most of the recipe except that I beat the egg whites until stiff and omitted the baking powder. Turned out like fluffy brownies.

Made this for my gluten free son originally and the whole family asks for it now at birthday parties. At first they scoffed at me because of the garbanzo beans, but they absolutely LOVE it! I put it with cool whip and sliced strawberries. My kids add chocolate syrup too!

We tried this recipe out of curiosity and were blown away at how good it was! The only thing I added was a tsp of vanilla to bring out the chocolate flavor. The kids loved it and have said they want to make it again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Ok, I am a believer.  I made this recipe out of sheer curiousity, it was good.  Let's be real, it is not as good as chocolate cake with all that yummy fat and sugar, but if you are looking for a healthy alternative this takes the cake!  It was moist and chocolatey. I was shocked at how nicely it rose in the pan.  Will make this again for sure.  Thanks!

It's been a long time since I've come across a recipe that made me run to the kitchen to try it out.  Made it as written (used a 16 oz can of garbanzos though) and not only did I enjoy it - everyone else who can eat gluten did too!

Good recipe.  I cut the salt, add a tsp of gf vanilla, add a full tsp of gf baking powder, cut the sugar to 1/2 c , add 1/4 to 1/2 cup fine grated zuchinni and use dark chocolate. For a lighter cake I seperate whites and yolks of the eggs and then whip the whites until stiff and fold the other ingredients (including egg yolks) fully mixed into the egg whites.

Absolute delicious! I made this in a square pan because I wanted brownies. They came out moist and fudgy. This does not tasty like a "beany," "healthy," "bland" cake. It tastes just like regular fudge brownies. I will definitely make it again!

Very moist and delicious!
I gave it to my family without mentioning the ingredients. Everyone gave it two thumbs up. No taste of garbanzo bean at all.
I used a non-stick silicone muffin pan (sprayed with oil and put some cocoa powder instead of flour) and it was very hard to get them out of the pan as they crumbled. I'll use a different pan next time. I absolutely recommend this to everyone and certainly making this again and again. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This is unbelievably fantastic in flavor and texture.  It is a chewy fudgy brownie cake and no one would ever know it had garbanzo beans in it.  I am very particular about baked goods and loved this instantly.  Makes fantastic mini-cupcakes too. I had it plaine with no frosting and with a creamy frosting with a little orange rind grated in which was also good.

This is a "brownie" like cake.  Very good.  Have yet to have a anyone guess that it has beans in it!  I use a 15 oz. can and it turned out just fine.  It's fast and simple to make!

We just switched to a gluten/dairy free diet and a friend of mine shared this recipe with me.  It is amazingly good!  My family loved this cake, and my daughter wants me to make this for her birthday next month! :)  I used gluten free and dairy free chocolate chips :)

Very good. I couldn't taste the beans at all, even while it was warm. I did have to use some milk chocolate chips, as I ran out of semi-sweet. Overall, it was surprisingly good. I only gave it four stars because it wasn't very chocolately for me.

This was pretty good for a cake made with chick peas! It was definitely better (fudgier) the next day. It won't be my "go to" chocolate cake, but good to have on file in case I have a guest who can't eat gluten.

I made this for a friend who is gluten sensitive and she absolutely loved it. I thought it was very chocolately. Most every person that tried it couldn't believe it was made with garbanzo beans and no flour. I am not on a gluten restricted diet and will be making this again. Thanks for such a great recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe - it's kind of like chocolate hummus with the beans.  I took the suggestion to use the vanilla, and I took the leftover chocolate chips and sprinkled them on top.  The "cake" does leave a bit of an after taste - which is why I gave it 4 stars.  And you should warn people you give this cake to not to overdo it (the beans will make you a bit gassy)

I made this without anyone seeing that there was garbanzo beans in it. The kids didn't notice any difference, but my husband thought the consistency was a little weird. It is moist, and sweet, and definitely a keeper for a gluten-free chocolatey treat!

I have made this cake several times. I love it, but it is more like a brownie than cake. Just FYI.  NOTE: If you are make this for celiacs, do NOT dust with flour unless you have a gluten-free flour on hand. If not, dust with cocoa.

Astonishing.  This is intensely chocolately and rich.  The texture is a little grainy, like hummus but that gets lost in the overall brownie-like denseness.  The Garbanzo (Chickpea) flavor is entirely gone, leaving only the chocolate, so use a good chocolate.  I sliced thin servings as a hearty slice would have been too dense and rich to finish.  Great recipe - guilt free!

I made these as cupcakes and they were delicious, however I couldn't get them out of the pan! I greased and powdered the pan but next time I will use paper muffin cups since they crumbled apart when I tried to get them out. Now I will be snacking on tasty bits of cake until it's all gone...this could be dangerous....

Absolutely amazing! You can never tell this is made with garbanzos. I made it for my friend who is gluten intolerant and he loved it. Others agreed that this tastes as good as any flour-based version. This is a keeper!

AMAZING! I have requests to make it again... I even shared some with the Comcast guy this morning! I heated the oven to 360, added 3tbsp of butter to the chocolate mixture, added 1 tsp of vanilla & 1/2 tsp extra of baking powder... Garnished with sliced strawberries & raspberries, powdered sugar, OH BABY!

Tried this recipe on the family just because it sounded different. It was great! Everyone loved it, including my hates-new-things brother. I've given it 4 of 5 stars because it really needs fresh fruits (preferably berries) to bring out that extra star quality.  It's a great basic chocolate cake alternative recipe that I'll definitely make again, possibly with chocolate chunks and raspberries stirred in.

This is really great. I can't believe it's made with garbanzo beans. Serving it tonight with home made vanilla ice cream. I want to make this for a celiac friend for christmas. The instructions say to grease and flour the pan, I used cocoa instead of flour. It's a keeper!

This cake is amazing! Elegant and easy! Great for any occasion, even breakfast because its high in protein.  I've even made a white chocolate version with white chocolate chips and orange zest. To die for! Just remember to let it cool completely for the best texture.

This recipe is amazing! I made it for my mom who is a chocolate lover and she couldn't get enough :).  This cake is SO much better than a box mix and just as fast and easy to make... plus you don't feel quite as guilty eating it!  I did use 1/2 c. sugar rather than 3/4 c. and it was still plenty sweet.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe- it's a keeper!

We love having a healthier alternative to chocolate cake without the guilt and unhealthy side effects. The rich dense cake is better than some traditional cakes we've eaten, and if you love cake batter you'll love this style even more. It's amazing!

You should make this garbanzo cake! I did however make a small adjustment: a cap full of almond extract. My boyfriend is on a diet and he has already had two pieces as I sit and type this...Thanks so much for this creative cake. We both loved it.

The cake turned out really moist, but would describe it more like a cakey-brownie.  I apparently didn’t grease the sides of the cake pan well enough and it all fell apart when I inverted it.  So to rescue it to be served for a gluten-free potluck (I did use cocoa powder i/o flour in the pan), I made a trifle with raspberries, in a little bit of apple juice, and cool whip.  It turned out Great!   I brought some of the leftover pieces for people to try on its own and everyone agreed it works better in the trifle than alone.

Excellent!!!!!!  Make it all the time!  Once people have eaten it I tell them what it's made of, and they are shocked.  I use 60% cacao instead (and i've made it once w/semi sweet - not as good).

I was very skeptical when I read the ingredients for this recipe because I am not a fan of garbanzos.  I was pleasantly surprized at how good it tasted and will make it again.  I followed other reviewers advice and added some vanilla a little salt and cut the sugar by a third.  Next time I will reduce the sugar a bit more and add some nuts to make it more like a brownie.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the directions, and the cake turned out dry and crumbly. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I will continue to look for a good gluten free chocolate cake.

I was really dreading going gluten-free, but this cake made me realize that it could not only be doable, but delicious!  It was seriously good. I loved the gooeyness just out of the oven, and it retained its taste and moisture very well until it was polished off a few days later. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

AMAZING! Made them in my blender since I dont have a food processor and made cupcakes instead of a cake since I didnt have the right pan. They had a wonderful silky texture, not cakey in the traditional sense of the word, so much better than that. So good in fact that my picky eater dad had no complaints, and then ate 9 more..since I can't have flour this will be a trusty recipe from here on out.

This cake is a delicious surprise. I partially froze the beans before putting them in my cuisinart so that when I pulsed them they would create a finer grain without any coarse bits. It worked! The texture was perfect! I added 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla for flavor but the cake would be great even without those additions.

after seeing such good reviews I decided to try it. This tastes healthy. That is the best way I can describe it. Not bad but definitely doesn't taste like a decadent dessert treat.

Right after I had blended up the beans my 4-year-old walked in and said "Mommy, did you toot?" LOL! So yes, the beans smell weird when blended, but do continue on, things will be ok. We had this for dessert at room temperature. Not excellent, but quite good, especially considering how relatively healthy it is! I feel like it's missing a dairy flavour. I added vanilla and 1 tablespoon of cocoa to my cake. It would probably be yummier with sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on top.

well, well.. well.. whatdaya know.. its freakin awesome cake!  We're not gluten free people.. but this cake was unbelievably awesome!  Chick peas in a cake??!! But.. yes!   I made it as suggested; no differences.  It's not too sweet.. has the consistency of a cheesecake without the fat.. It's freakin awesome!  It will be a new staple!  Made it in an 8 inch pan; I think I put it in for 10 min more than suggested; because the centre was gooey, but perhaps I put it in too long.. it was moist, but a bit dry on the edges.. my bad.. LOL SOOO yummy, and I don't even LIKE chocolate!

Made the cake for my brother with celiac....Love love love this cake.  It must set overnight though.  I also made a chocolate genache with semi sweet choc chips, butter, pure valilla and brandy.  I will warn you it is very rich.  Tastes amazing with strawberries and whip cream help cut the richness of the cake.  Will make again!!

Per another reviewer, I chose to make cupcakes for a group event. I doubled the baking powder, reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup and upped the ante by using organic ingredients including eggs, semi-sweet chocolate, sugar and vanilla bean - only because organic is always my personal preference.  In addition, because I like the taste, I added a 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon to the chocolate in addition to the butter for a "Mexican chocolate" touch.  My oven runs cool so I upped the temperature and baked the cupcakes for 25 minutes.  Perfect!  I don't have a food processor so I rinsed and drained the chickpeas then added 1/4 c. filtered water and cooked them in the microwave on 'high' for 4 minutes.  This softened them enough to make perfect mash-by-hand paste.  A hand mixer smoothed out the rest of the batter.  To finish them off, I drizzled the tops of the cupcakes with melted white and bitter chocolate.  The final product was fudgy, moist and not-too-sweetly delicious!  A note for Mexican chocolate lovers:  I made a batch for my family, used the same amount of cinnamon and added 1/8 tsp. cayenne for that extra touch of heat on the palate.  My husband, a diehard milk chocolate guy, hated them, but everyone else had seconds and raved!  Next time, I'll make two batches:  one sweet for him and one choco-zippy for me!  All in all, a pleasing departure from a standard cake and absolutely foolproof!

Yum!!! I can't believe this is made with beans. Very rich. It definitely needs the refrigeration (I am glad that someone mentioned that in their review) and I liked it even better the next day. Will definitely make again.

Awesome cake! I did have to look up Garbanzo beans,... we call them chickpeas here in Australia!!! I added Vanilla with the beans/peas and eggs! who would have thought that a gluten free cake would taste so good. No butter required that has got to be a good thing too! I may try and add some instant coffee next time to try for a mocha cake!

So much better than I ever would've expected! I can't believe it has hardly any regular cake ingredients and garbanzo beans of all things to put in a cake!  Deliciously flavorful, moist and fluffy.  Used only 1/4 c. sugar and added 2 tbsp. cinnamon apple sauce and a tbsp. of honey.  Left out the powdered sugar and topped with brown sugar cream cheese frosting (which has honey and almond extract in it, recipe is on AllRecipes).  DELICIOUS will make again, thank you :)

We love this cake. We made it once for a friend who eat gluten-free, and now we make it in place of regular chocolate cake all the time. It's very moist and extremely easy to make. I often dissolve 2 tsp of instant coffee in 2 TB water and add it to the batter to bring out the chocolate taste. Also, I add 1 tsp vanilla. I dust with cocoa powder instead of powdered sugar. Great recipe, flexible too.

This needs 6 stars or more. If I hadn't made it myself, I wouldn't believe there are garbanzo beans in it! Mine came out like a very moist, but surprisingly light batch of cakey brownies. This is one of the best recipes I've gotten from Allrecipes, period.

Delicious!  I made this for some celiac friends and they were thrilled.  Non-celiacs loved it too.  Dense and moist and intensely chocolatey (I used bittersweet not semi-sweet) Note that if you want to make this gluten-free DO NOT FLOUR THE PAN.  It defeats the purpose.  I used cocoa powder.  Also, if you are going to sprinkle with powdered sugar, follow the recipe and do it just before serving.  I did it the night before and it didn't look pretty.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

I had a 15.5 can of beans to use, and whipped them in the blender since I don't have a processor. I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4. Delicious! I will surely be fooling my family tonight!

I needed to make a gluten free dessert for a dinner and this was really good. I added a tsp of vanilla (which mine said gluten free), covered the top with strawberries and sprinkled with powdered sugar. EVERYONE love it!! Next time I think I would make a chocolate ganache to drizzle over the top and maybe try to substitute a few egg whites for a couple of the eggs....Will definitely make again. Happy Baking!

Great recipe!  This is my go to for a gluten free cake.  I usually add a touch of vanilla and top it with whipped cream and berries.  My partner has celiac and loves it but even when we serve it at dinner parties it gets gobbled up by folks who don't realize that it's made with beans.  I puree everything together in the blender REALLY WELL.

My alterations: I used a 16 oz can of chickpeas, 1 tsp baking powder, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg (for extra flavor), and didn't include any of the sugar.  They were still plenty sweet, but for some reason the bottoms of my cupcakes were dry while the insides were super moist.  This recipe made about 9 filled-to-the-brim cupcakes, which I baked for 25 minutes at 350F in my silicone muffin pan.  While these cupcakes are somewhat healthier in that they contain more fiber and protein than normal cupcakes, they are also more calorie dense (a small trade-off I guess :)

Wonderful recipe! Made it for my mother who can only eat gluten free food. Great chocolate flavor, cannot taste the beans at all! Came out a bit dry, the top cracked but maybe next time I'll cook it less than 40 min.

For those who were having a problem with a "crumbly" texture, I found the key is to make sure the garbanzo beans are blended to the smoothest state you can get them in.  When I didn't focus on blending them really well mine also had the crumbly tendency.

INCREDIBLE. This came out with a texture like a dense fudge for me.  I found this while looking for bean recipes after I went bean crazy one day at Costco.  After cooling the cake I topped it with a strawberry yogurt frosting (2 to 4 c. powdered sugar, pinch of salt + 1/4 c. each of softened butter, plain yogurt and strawberry preserves .... beat w/ mixer until creamy.) and chilled it overnight.  It's been the dessert of choice for me & my 10y daughter all week and I just finished the last piece.  I think I will double the recipe next time and bake in a 9x 12 pan w/ some walnuts in the mix and see if I can't pass it off as fudge.

When I found this recipe browsing the chocolate cake section I could hardly believe my eyes.  I took the advice of some reviewers and added one teaspoon of vanilla and a bit of salt, but otherwise used the recipe as printed.  It was really amazingly good!  It's important to process the beans very well.  My cake was cheesecake like in texture and the bean flavor was hardly present.  I highly recommend this, and will be using this recipe often at my B&B when I have guests with gluten intolerance.  Thanks!

I made this cake for my boyfriend for his birthday, not because he has a gluten intolerance, but because I happened to have the right ingredients. It was amazing!!  He didn't even know there were beans in in until i told him!  Other people came over and had some cake too, and they loved it!  (I even forgot to put the baking powder in...oops)  Oh, and I used brown sugar instead of white because for some odd reason i don't have white sugar...

First of all, thank you thank for posting this recipe! This is healthy, high in protein, simple to make and frankly every bit at good as a cake with flour, if not better! Even my gluten-eating family enjoyed it! I paired it with chocolate buttercream frosting (recipe from Ghiradelli's Unsweetened Cocoa box). The only challenge I had was the cake sticking to my silicone cake pan? Any ideas? I greased it, not sure I had too. I am trying this next in cupcake form!

WOW! I made this cake for a friend of mine with celiac's disease (no gluten, no dairy) and he loved it, so did everyone else in the house! It was so incredibly easy to make, and the ingredients didn't cost me a fortune as can happen with specialty cooking.  The consistency was comparable to cheesecake and I would recommend this recipe to any one who has issues with gluten, or is just looking for a cake that's a little better for you than average (finding a cake with this much protein is a rare feat!) good, good :)

Very easy to make and the house smelled wonderful while it was baking. I made this so a co-worker with Celiac disease could enjoy. The entire department gobbled it up with powdered sugar and sliced strawberries. Caution: do not flour the pan if you are making this for someone with a gluten intolerance. Try cocoa powder or skip dusting all together. I don't have a full size food processor, but a mini prep. After processing the beans and eggs, I dumped into a larger bowl and used a hand mixer to add the remaining ingredients. Very moist and chocolaty!

Actually not bad.  My sister's boyfriend is allergic to gluten and I wanted to make something that we could all share.  I cut up some strawberries and put them on top.

Made a test batch of these for passover by omitting the baking powder. Also added some vanilla and applesauce and cut the sugar to 1/4 c. These cupcakes were so good were going to make them all year round. Chocolatey but not too rich at all! Makes you feel better about eating dessert since the garbanzo beans are in there. It took about 23-25 minutes to cook as cupcakes and they taste best served hot or room temperature. I didn't really enjoy them right out of the fridge. I topped em with homemade whipped cream and strawberries. Also make sure to bake these in tin liners if your making cupcakes because paper lines will stick!

Exceptional. Very easy and flavorful. I baked in a square pan and cut into small, bite-sized squares.

I have never rated a recipe before, but this one deserved it.  Definitely more like brownies than cake but it was amazing!  I 'floured' my pan with cocoa and used splenda instead of sugar.  I also topped with raspberries and a white chocolate drizzle.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This receipe was excellent. I've been gluten free for 4 years and it was wonderful to have an easy cake receipe that also had great flavor! My kids loved it. We added a gluten free vanilla frosting, but are going to do fresh berries next time.

This is the best guilt-free wheat-free chocolate cake there is!  Thank you to whoever invented it.  The only addition I made was a tsp of vanilla.  The first time I made it I used a 15 oz can of garbanzos instead of the 19 oz listed in the recipe.  It was way too crumbly, and sunk slightly in the middle.  The second time I used the full 19 oz amount and it held together much better.  Highly recommend using parchment paper and a springform pan for easy handling.  I also wrapped it well and froze part of it, and it was just as wonderful a few weeks later when I thawed it.

Wow. So I just read this recipe, went to the store and baked it for the guys....and THEY LOVED IT! And so did I!! (My boyfriend still doesn't believe there are chickpeas in it..) I am always keeping my eyes open for fun healthy sweet treats and this caught my attention. I mixed half dark chocolate and half cinnamon chocolate (and a fraction of splenda)  and the outcome tasted like gingerbread cake! Other than that I followed the recipe and it was perfect! This ones a keeper. Thank  you!!

I was not sure how this recipe would work out but it was awesome! Even my husband liked this cake.  He described it as a dense brownie but the taste was great. I added a touch of vanilla. That's the only change I made.

I am always on the lookout for a good GF recipe because my MIL has Celiac's. I made a "trial run" of this a few days before Thanksgiving, and was blown away at how good it is.  My husband, 3 year old grandson and I finished it off in a few days and enjoyed every bite.  Keep in mind, we are not gluten intolerant and could have had anything else we wanted, but we thought it was great.  I made it for my MIL for Thanksgiving. She didn't like it.  I truly have no idea what she is looking for, because this is yummy. It's every bit as good as any brownie recipe I have ever tried.  Best part is, it is much healthier than traditional brownies.  Low fat, high protein, just a great choice for a dessert.  We'll be having this again.

Shockingly great recipe. My diabetic friend felt much better about eating this one because of the protein content would slow sugar absorbtion. 

Also, I made this in a cheesecake pan with great results. 

I love it because it was moist and delicious, and especially gluten free!!! Yeah, thanks for providing this great recipe.

Great. I made it exactly as it said. It was very good. Reminds me of a brownie. I used low fat whip cream instead of the powder sugar. Loved it. Will make it again.

This was a great recipe.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used half dark choc., half semi-sweet chips.  I have one very picky eater and I have become very good at "sneaking" things into recipes that he won't touch.

Delicious! We had a friend over who can't eat gluten, so I threw this together and we all loved it. Even knowing it had garbanzo beans in it, my four kids inhaled it and asked for more. We'll be making this again!

Great recipe!  For those of us who have to make gfcf dishes, it is always a sigh of relief to find a recipe that does not require strange ingredients and is easy to make.  I added 1/2 cup of apple sauce (I just pulverized an apple, skin and all, in the food processer with a little water) as another reviewer suggested and only used 1/2 cup sugar.  We all thought it was great, especially the son who I made it for.  Will try using even less sugar next time, since another reviewer said she forgot the sugar all together and it still was good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried making this for someone with a wheat allergy, and he loved it. On my next go-round, I added a splash of almond extract, and lots of crushed walnuts and cranberries. It gave this cake a lovely, autumnal taste - and also slices easily into brownies. Better than many flour-based cakes I've tried!

I made this recipe as cupcakes for my gluten-intolerant friend's birthday.  What a hit!  The texture was more like that of brownies, but less dense.  And the taste was amazing!  I was somewhat skeptical about the garbanzo beans, but now I'm sure I'll be using this recipe again - for myself!

I made this twice now, and it's incredible.  Both times as cupcakes actually, not a cake.  It never occured to me to use a chickpea base instead of flour and eggs.  I didn't tell anyone it was gluten free until after they ate the cupcakes and noone could believe they actually had protein in them!  Great recipe!!

Oh my...this cake rocks!! I was not expecting this to be so delicious. No one knew it was gluten free and/or made with garbanzo beans. I just sprinkled it with powdered sugar - no need for frosting. I will agree with others that it is on the brownie side, but you can still pull it off as a cake. And it is a little crumbly, and suprisingly moist. 
This will be made over and over again. It is so simple and quick to pull together. Amazing recipe!

Delicious! So Rich and creamy! Instead of a 9 inch pan I used a muffin tin to make cupcakes and baked them for 30 mins. I also drizzled them with a simple raspberry puree. So simple and so much better than the boxed gluten-free cake mixes.

This was a great recipe, I actually made cupcakes and they turned out great! It suprised everyone that there was no flour in it! I actually didn't have any garbonzo beans but used white pinto beans and it tasted great. Dust the pan with cocoa powder for easy release! Will definitely keep my husband's birthday cakes, he's allergic to wheat!

I think I needed to blend mine more. It wasn't as smooth as I would have liked. Considering how easy this was, it is really pretty good. I used egg substitute. It does crumble quite a bit, even though it is still moist. It would be really good with a raspberry puree. but, we just had whipped cream.

Very, very, very good.  I made this for my family Easter dinner and it was devoured.  Even my super-picky uncle had two pieces.  What a keeper.

I was very impressed. My skeptical friends tried it and then asked for more. I used dark chocolate, but I think next time will use milk chocolate.

I did not have a 19 oz can of garbanzo beans, but proceeded with the recipe as written, with the exception of adding 1/2 teaspoon of mixed vanilla and almond extract.  It took close to 50 minutes to cook but was absolutely delicious.

The recipe calls for a 19 oz can of garbanzo beans. All I could find was 16 oz cans. I used 16 oz of fresh made garbanzo beans which might have been a little too many as the cake was a little dry. However, the flavor was great and you sure couldn’t tell there was no flour. I would make it again but I would add chopped walnuts as it seemed more brownie like than cake and my family likes nuts.

I have baked this cake countless times.
As the recipe stands, I love it.
I've made many variations, however it's a definite go-to.
One of my favorite versions is to swirl  chocolate cheesecake mixture throughout as if a marble chocolate cake.  This is a very rich desert!

My whole family loves this cake, no matter which version I create.

For those who don't like it, please give it a second chance, there's always a possibility something didn't go exactly as directed.

Tasted nice and mousse-y. Made no changes, really enjoyed it. Majority of my guests (GF and non-GF) liked it too. Only one person tasted the garbanzo bean flavor, but I didn't. Will keep this in my GF repertoire!

Wow! I can hardly believe this had garbanzo beans in it! This turned out absolutely delicious and my children just gobbled it up. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion of adding a little vanilla. This has a more brownie-like consistency, but still absolutely delicious. Will definitely make this one again!

Really surprised by this recipe!!  I made it and had all the kids try it.  They really liked it and couldn't believe the secret ingredient was beans!   I took the advice of others and added 1 tsp baking powder, vanilla and a pinch of salt.  I also mixed dark and semi-sweet chocolate chips, added a sprinkle of chocolate chips to the top and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and a 1/2 cup white sugar.  This rose quite a bit in the oven and then fell into a dense chocolate cake when it cooled.  The texture is a bit grainy but the cake is really good!  Definitely give it a try!

I only had a 15 oz can of beans and used entire bag of bittersweet chips (slightly over 1.5 cups), which resulted in a more torte-like consistency - YUM!

It is so delicious! I made it when I had a day over at my Aunt's house. My siblings loved it so much! It actually made 17 instead of 12. I made it into cupcakes and I added 2 teaspoons of organic mexican vanilla. I also added 1 1/2 teaspoon of orange zest. My 3 other siblings love helping out in the kitchen. So I had lots of helpers! We baked it in silicon molds. It ended up only taking 30 minutes to bake. Overall, it only took 40-50 minutes to make, and bake them.  Probably because we did cupcakes instead of a cake. My mom loves them so much. We put little pineapple toppers in them. They turned out so cute!!!!!!!!!!!! I will put a picture of them on here once I get it downloaded.

Added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon butter. The food processor makes it possible and the recipe comes out great! Much lighter than the richer, excessive fattening alternatives. Served it to guests with ice cream they were smitten...

Loved it. A great way to sneak fiber and protein into picky eaters! Only slight recommendation is maybe 2-3 more minutes of baking as it was uncooked at 20 minutes. Otherwise delicious and very simple

This is an incredible cake!!! I made it and I couldn't believe it was as good if not better than my regular chocolate cake recipe.  I gave a piece to my husband and he didn't believe it had chickpeas!! I will be using this recipe in the future even for friends who aren't gluten free. One suggestion, though, is to use a blender to do this and it will blend up smoother.  You have to try this!!!!!

The taste was not enjoyed by the children at all, but it’s a decent gluten free cake.....must add fresh fruit like strawberries as a topping.

Wow - this is an amazing recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was happily demolished by a group of friends, who could not believe that it had chickpeas in it! This makes a very dense, fudgy cake. I put strawberries on top and served with cream. 

I did use a blender rather than a food processor (which I don't have) - it worked just fine, though I think it was a bit hard on the motor. 

Will make again for sure! Total winner.

Great low carb dessert for diabetics. So easy and quick to make. I use half the sugar and a full 11.5 oz. bag oif extra dark chocolate chips. Sometimes I add a tablespoon of espresso powder and/or chopped walnuts. At Christmas,  I add two teaspoons of peppermint extract and top with crushed candy canes after baking. For extra decadence,  spread Nutella on top with halved strawberries after fully cooled.

This recipe turned out great! I made it into cupcakes, and it made 13. I only had a 15.5 oz can of garbonzo beans, so I used 3 eggs and one egg white to keep the ratios as close to the original as possible. I also took others' suggestions by adding 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp of baking powder, and I added 3 tbsp of butter to my melting chocolate. I used a double boiler for the chocolate and butter. Buttered the cupcake tins and filled about 80% of the way up. Baked at 350 for 22 minutes and they came out great! Best eaten when warm out of the oven.

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times and always make it into cup cakes. I've read other reviews and I'm not sure what they are doing wrong because it's never been dry. I only use one can of garbanzo beans and added about 3 Tbs of butter to the chocolate chips as I melted them. Oh and don't forget to add just a bit of vanilla. You won't believe this is made with beans!!! It's a must try

Very yummy! My gluten-free family member loved it, and so did the rest of the family. We shelled the garbanzo beans first and were glad we did. This is a really quick and easy cake to make, and we like how the beans make it healthier than regular cake!

Update: Took this to a party and no one noticed that it was any different than a regular chocolate cake!

Made for a bday of a gluten-free friend, but everyone was a fan of this dense, moist, rich, chocolate cake. A "keeper" of a recipe. (It did take over 50 min until it was done.)

YUM!! Just made it for Mother's Day. Served it with fresh raspberries and whip cream. It was a hit! no one even knew about the secret ingredient. The family knows I love making hummus so they weren't surprised when I told them there was a can of garbanzo beans in the ingredient list. 
p.s. I did add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.

I must preface my review by saying that I made two changes to the recipe; I added 1tsp vanilla and substituted 3/4tsp organic Stevia for the sugar.  That being said, this is just an average recipe.
I used a food processor until the beans were a paste yet the cake still had a graininess to it.  The chocolate flavor was just right.  I couldn't taste the beans so that's a plus.  Could have been sweeter (the substitution ratio for Stevia is 1tsp per 1cup sugar so 3/4tsp should have been spot on but it wasn't; maybe 1tsp Stevia instead).
I personally found 40 minutes to be too long as my cake was on the dry side.  I see quite a few people added butter but I was trying to keep it as healthy as possible so I didn't make that change. 
Overall it's ok...not sure I'll make it again.

Thought this sounded interesting. From the picture, I was expecting more of a molten lava cake. It was ok. Don't know if I would make this again unless I had a gluten intolerance. It wasn't horrible, but not necessarily great either. Wish I would have remembered to read the reviews again, and put the vanilla in to see if that helped any.

You can't tell people it's "chocolate cake" cuz then they expect chocolate birthday cake.....so it's all in how you sell it.  It really is delicious!!  I added 4 tablespoons of butter to melt with the chocolate chips per another reviewer.  

Serve with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream and it's divine!

I made this cake several times.   It turns out well every time.   It is simple to make and it comes out very moist.  It is kind of a dense cake, but it is really good served warm with ice cream. My whole family likes it, so it is a nice tried and true recipe to use when we have gluten intolerant company  coming over for dinner.

The garbanzo beans were hard to mash without a food processor - a blender could not do the job.  That being said, the recipe did turn out alright.  If you decide to make it, be sure to grease the pan liberally.  My cake stuck in the pan and crumbled into pieces.  It still tasted good, but did not have the aesthetic I was looking for.

i picked this when i was invited to a dinner at a gluten-free family.  it seemed too interesting and easy to pass.
it was DELICIOUS!!! chocolaty enough, not too sweet, and light with perfect texture!!
everybody LOVED it!
** I used only 1/2 cup natural pure cane sugar, & added:
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract 
1/4 tsp cinnamon 
1/4 tsp nutmeg 
a sprinkle of clove  
it added beautiful earthy tones **

Excellent chocolate cake!  Very moist, and texture close to brownies.  I used 'unsweetened" chocolate, and was still sweet enough.  Will make this one again for sure, maybe even double the recipe for a double layer cake!

Thanks for posting this.

Excellent!! I have a gluten intolerant co-worker and needed a great birthday cake.  Winner!  I will certainly make this again regardless of gluten intolerance!  Bonus – Diary free!

I made a few modifications based on other reviews:      I made mine in a 10” spring form pan, added 1/3c sugar free apple sauce, 1 ½ tsp vanilla and about 10-15 min extra cooking time.

I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract  to the recipe. Also, I used 1/3 cup sugar and added  1/3 cup honey to make it even more healthy. In addition, I reduced the amount of chocolate to half and added one tbs of coco powder. To make it even simpler ( if you are busy like me) I did not melt the chocolate. I just added the chocolate chips to the blender so they get smaller in size and pour the mixture into the pan. It came out very good.

I made it exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious!  The only thing I added was a chocolate ganache glaze on top.  I have made it for my office a number of times and am asked for the recipe every time.  No one can believe it's gluten free.

I made it exactly according to the recipe. My daughter, who has celiacs and is on a doctor directed low carb diet due to hypothyroidism really liked it! I liked it too, but next time I will add vanilla, unsweetened applesauce and nuts. This is a keeper!

I like it! Mine was a little heavy. It rose but then fell a little. Also i had to bake it for 55 minutes. I think because i used a half cup of splenda along with the sugar. I also added about. Tbsp of butter and a teaspoon of vanilla. I think mext time i will add more vanilla, more butter and more baking powder. 
But it was moist, and it tasted great. Im gonna go have some now.

Fabulous!I doubled the recipe to use all the Garbanzo beans I had, added 8Tblsp butter, 2 tsp vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and some dutch cocoa. I peeled the beans as someone else suggested (this takes a LONG time and I ended up putting off making these until the next night) and put them in the food processor, then in the fridge overnight. I processed this again adding one egg at a time and whipping it up well. I then transferred my double batch to the stand mixer as the chocolate/butter melt wouldn't fit and whipped it up until it was quite stiff. I made the mixture into cupcakes for ease of grabbing one for work. I cooked them for 23 minutes and they were perfect! I have no grittiness and just gave DH one to try and he just said WOW! They are moist, light and delicious. I think if I hadn't whipped them up so much they might be a little chewier like brownies - neither a bad thing. I froze them overnight and they returned to the exact same condition as before freezing. These are a keeper for me!

I used PAM's tweeks and also made cupcakes.  I whipped up a butter/cream cheese frosting w/ poppy seeds & coffee grounds.  They were GONE before I had a chance to eat one! I found a crumb during cleanup but it didn't forograph well...

I made mine and it took around 30 minutes to cook to the consistancy i like however, i have a few tips. 

Us e milk and dark chocolate for a little sweetness.
Strain the blended chickpea and egg mixture to ensure no stray skins
make sure to dust with icing sugar mixed with cocoa 
and finally, for that little extra umf, i suggest ground sea salt ontop of the finished piece and you end up with a fudgy, salted chocolate brownie instead of a seriously dry cake.

This was super easy to make and tasted amazing. I added roughly 2 Tbsp of oil and a splash of vanilla, and I topped it with a raspberry coulis. I will definitely make this again!

This cake is ridiculously good! I made this cake because I'm on a chick pea kick and I was seriously craving cake even though I'm trying to eat healthier. I love trying new recipes and this recipe surpassed all of my expectations!!  I don't usually like trying gluten free or vegan dishes because they sometimes sacrifice flavor but this did not make any sacrifices! As a struggling and very tired college student this cake really brightened my night.

This is absolutely delicious, and yes, it really is as simple as it sounds.  I've made this a few times now, and every time it pleases even the most fervent chocolate lover in our house.  Recently, I took it to a dinner party: people raved and went back for seconds.  

Remember to top with powdered sugar and serve warm.  If possible, it is even better the next day.  Very much a warm chocolaty fudge consistency when made exactly.  Keep in mind that oven times vary.  I recently made it in a larger, more shallow dish and it was still amazing.

3rd time making this today and no idea what went wrong but it completely fell apart when taking it out of the pan.  Still tastes the same as the last 2 times .  Great gluten free recipe, easy to make as cupcakes or a cake.

This recipe is just amazing! I made it for my daughter in law who has celiac disease and she loved it! The whole family loved it.  You can't really tell it is made with a can of garbanzo beans so, while we were eating it I made everybody guess the main ingredient. I frosted the cake with  chocolate glaze and I also added 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 tbs. rum to the batter. I can't wait to make it again:)

very good.  suggested updates-some noted previously
+ 1 teaspoon vanilla
+ 5 tablespoons butter
1/2 semi sweet cchips/1/2 milk cchips
reserve some chips to add to the batter to give crunch or add peanut butter chips/white chips or nuts 
great with icecream

Wow! What a GREAT recipe! I mixed the whole thing up in the food processor (make sure you rinse the chickpeas well) and it was in the oven in no time. After sampling the very thick raw batter I was a bit concerned that the chickpeas wouldn't be blended fine enough - I could still feel a bit of their texture in the batter- but that graininess was completely gone after baking. This made a delicious, wonderfully light textured chocolatey cake or brownie... whatever you want to call it. We ate it warm and perfectly plain but it would also be excellent with ice cream or whipped cream/topping. It is a tiny bit crumbly but still came out of the pan in presentable wedges. We discussed the possibility of adding a bit of instant coffee to the mixture to deepen the flavour and baking it in ramekins because it has a rather 'special occasion' taste and feel to it and that would make it prettier to serve. But really, it was perfectly lovely following the recipe exactly.

Made this for Christmas dessert, followed directions as written, all was well until I tried to take out of pan and it was just one big mess of crumbs! Put it back into baking pan and had to serve it with a spoon out of baking pan. Was very dry, would not make again.

This is a keeper recipe! After finding out I was broader line diabetic. I found this healthy recipe. I did make some changes, I added 1 orange with orange zest, 1/4 cup coconut shreds, 1/4 cup raisins, 1 tbsp. pumpkin seeds, and 1 tbsp. coconut oil. Omitted the sugar. It turned out really moist and decadent.

Excellent. I made it in a silicone heart shape cupcake pan. I used non stick pray instead of butter for the shapes. I decreased the bake time  since I made cupcakes. I also found that slightly undercooking them made them more moist. I wonder if decreasing or completely omitting the baking powder would make them even more densely decadent.

I did this tonight for dessert, craving something chocolate of course, daily right?  Anyway, so simple, and amazing.  Who'd of guessed the beans?  A high protein/fiber food.  They blenderized well in food processor with the eggs, gave them a good long blend to get as smooth as I could.  I am always tweaking things, as I don't  use white sugar for much except Hummingbird feed.  Oh, and holiday fudges.  (give that away...fast) Anyway, back to tweaking,  I used a blend of sucralose and brown sugar, just half a cup as it is sweeter than white sugar.  Other than that, I followed this recipe close enough.  I felt it was not too sweet.  It was nice and dense and rich almost, by no means TOO rich.  During the cooking time, it fractured a large line, earthquake like, thru the center for some reason.  Maybe cook it slower/lower?  Didn't ruin the flavor.  We enjoyed it cooled down.  Maybe tomorrow after setting in the fridge it will be even richer!

Ok, so I have a husband that is very skeptical of my gluten free baking experiments. When I told him I was making a cake out of garbanzo beans, he laughed at me. I had been given this recipe by a friend that was raving about it, so I thought I would give it a try despite my husband's skepticism. When I pulled it out of the oven and gave it a taste test, I was amazed! I offered  some to my husband, who politely declined. I convinced him to take a bite and he fell in love with it! He's not really a fan of cake in the first place, so his high praise is really saying something about this recipe! I've made it for other gluten-eating friends and got the same results. I'm telling you, even the expensive gluten free cake we got for our wedding from a top-notch bakery doesn't hold a candle to this cake. Just as a warning though... It's more like a pound cake than a traditional cake since it's so moist and dense. Thanks for this recipe! It's fantastic!

My husband loves this cake and does not care how it looks.  It is a good thing, because it is very crumbly.  The sides always break when I cut it.   I line the pan with parchment paper, but this does not help much.

Delishhh! Used Enjoylife dark chocolate chips, a whole tsp of baking powder and added a splash of vanilla. Also, I removed the shells off the garbanzo beans before blending. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exact. Came out rich and moist. The top was cracked so it didn't look as pretty. But I give it two thumbs up nonetheless!

So easy to make and it always disappears too quick.  I have made it about a dozen times.  I have been asked to share this recipe often when we make it for company.  Last time I made it I added caramels as well.

Just tried this recipe and loved it!  Except I used 1/2 cup raw sugar instead of white sugar and added 1 TBSP sunflower liquid lecithin, 1 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp butter to chocolate chips (while it was melting), and reduced the chocolate chips to only 1/2 a cup.

I made this recipe for some gluten-free friends as an alternative to my conventional birthday cake.  It turns out everybody liked the garbanzo bean cake as much as, if not better then, the regular cake!  It was easy to make and super delicious.

I modified the recipe slightly: used dark chocolate chips. After mixing up per instructions, it didn't taste chocolate-ly enough, so I added about 1/2 ghirardelli cocoa powder and 1/2 almond meal.  The cake is delicious.

Note: It is high in tryptophan so you might feel very sleepy after eating it. Serve with espresso!!  You'll need it.

Been disappointed by so many gluten free cakes.  Either bad texture or bad taste.  This one is very moist with a nutty delicious taste.  Brought it to a dinner party and everyone liked it.  It wasn't overly sweet -- just enough!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Finally a gluten free dessert that I can go to anytime.

This is definitely a delicious little cake. I love the ideas of the beans and their nutty flavor. I only baked the cake for 35 minutes so it would be juicier. Also, i couldnt find a 19 oz can of garbanzos so i took 2 cups.

Made this for a b'day cake for a friend, with a few tweaks: used an 8 in square pan, sprayed the bottom with cooking spray, lined it with parchment paper, then sprayed with baking spray. Increased the chocolate to 2 cups ( 1 cup dark,1c.mixed semisweet and milk choc chips-'cause that's what I had on hand). Added 1 Tbsp espresso powder, 1/2 tsp each Vanilla and Almond extract.  Followed rest of the recipe. Cake popped right out of the pan. Let it sit uncovered for a few hours, then dusted it and sprinkled mini chips on top.  It was a big hit, light and chocolatey. But it was even better at lunch today: dense, fudgey, and the almond flavor was more noticeable-a nice complement to the chocolate. Next time, I'll try a puddle of crème anglaise and some raspberry sauce for a more elegant presentation.

I made this last night and my husband, who hates garbanzo beans,  Loved this cake as well as my kids.  I made homemade whipped cream and added the raspberries and it was a hit.

I have been making this recipe for awhile now and occasionally make it a chocolate coconut cake.  I also add about 1/4 cup of dark chocolate cocoa powder, 2 tbs of coconut oil, 1 teas of vanilla.  It is  decadent and my non-gluten free friends love this cake.  I served it with strawberries and Tru Whip.

This was great!  I added a few tablespoons of butter to the chocolate chips while melting and 1 teaspoon of vanilla when all ingredients were in the food processer. In addition to the powdered sugar I added whipped cream when serving.  A friend of mine who is gluten free said she has never had such a great tasting gluten free cake. Wonderful.

Not even I could screw up this cake.  I have been eyeing this recipe for months uncertain of a bean batter.  It is absolutely a great cake (and mini muffins).  I used GF Venchi chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips and it was rich and delicious.  Being sceptical, I tasted the batter and was impressed that it didn't taste like chickpeas.  The end product is brownie like in texture, rich and moist.  It wasn't too sweet either.  The cake is delicious and not a bean taste anywhere. UPDATE: I have also used coconut sugar instead of white sugar and it works perfectly. In one attempt I tried cutting down the white sugar by 1/4 and it crumbled a lot but was still tasty. As an alternative to cake, other than treating this like a brownie, baking it in a rectangular or square pan, I made this in a thin baking sheet and once completely cooled, cut them into cookie shapes for the kids. A big hit!  Thanks CCumins for sharing this recipe.

I'm not sure what happened but mine was very dry.  I omitted the added sugar as my chocolate had some sugar in it.  I did add a couple of sachets of stevia.  Everything else was the same.  Taste was good but wasn't nearly as moist as I was expecting based on other reviews.  I'm not sure why leaving the added sugar out would reduce moistness?

Wonderful flavor! Did not change a thing in the recipe. Served this at a women's gathering and it was a huge hit. Did have a little trouble removing it from the pans but believe I did not put enough cooking spray on them-so spray liberally!

I made this recipe extra lowfat by using fat-free egg substitute and replacing the chocolate chips with fat-free chocolate syrup.  I used sweetener instead of sugar (though there's plenty of sugar in the chocolate syrup so don't kid yourself into thinking that makes it low calorie).  I was worried it would be dry, or would stick to the pan, or wouldn't rise, but it turned out great first try.  I also used one tsp baking powder (instead of a half tsp), one tsp vanilla extract, one tbsp cocoa powder and some instant coffee.  It was pretty rich, but tasted great with fat-free ice cream or frozen yogurt.

I tried this and was delicious! It looked as if it belonged in a gourmet restaurant. The taste is heavier than a regular cake more like fudge. Melted some raspberry preserves and drizzled on top with whipped cream on side. Enjoy!

This is pretty good especially for being GF.  I eat GF and I've had hits and misses and this is a hit.   Though I think it may need tweaking as it was a bit crumbly in parts and the surfaced cracked but inside it was moist like a fudge brownie.  Very smooth texture.  Very yummy.    My hubby ate it with some cool whip and liked it.   
I did add butter to the recipe and vanilla as others have suggested.    I also removed the husks from the peas and it blended into a very smooth batter.    I think it's important to remove the husks.  It's very easy to do .  The husks slip right off.  It just takes time to do each one.   I  did mine while watching tv.
  I will definitely make this cake again.  And I would recommend the recipe to GF eaters.

I've made this three times in the last two months!  I love this cake!  It is so moist!  I keep telling myself I'm making it to take to work for my co-workers...so far it hasn't made it out of the kitchen!  Yum!  I haven't tried any variations but am open to using less sugar!  What do you use for a sugar substitute?

So good! I was looking for a flourless, gluten-free alternative to the traditional chocolate cake that also wouldn't feel heavy or drain my family of energy after eating it.  I wasn't sure what to expect from a cake using garbanzo beans, but based on the reviews decided to give it a shot.  It was a hit! Everyone praised it and had seconds.  It came out very moist and chocolatey. I put strawberries on top which complemented the richness of the cake very nicely. I do recommend grinding the beans as finely as possible to make the cake smoother. I also dusted the pan with cocoa instead of flour after greasing it.

I just made it.  It needs a little salt.  The garbanzo beans we found are 15 ounce cans, so I opened 2 cans and adjusted.  It smelled like garbanzo beans in the blender but not after baked.  I baked it in my toaster oven and it was done 13 minutes early.  Guess I need a new toaster oven.  I'm serving it with strawberries on top:  Strawberry shortcake with "chocolate cake." Yummm!!

I made this exactly and it was crumbly.  I couldn't slice a piece.  I am trying it one more time by adding butter and I will put it into the fridge before serving.  The taste was good but just the texture was a problem.

I read only two reviews. The one that said follow the instructions and make sure batter is Smooth.  That's what I did and this cake came out BEAUTIFUL.  The other review I read said it was not sweet. The sugar amount was the right amount for me.  If you want to, increase to one cup.  
I will put in a teaspoon of vanilla the next time because I usually put in vanilla to a cake batter. This was amazing.  I processed the beans first and then added the eggs. I made sure everything was pulverized/smooth just like my cheesecakes and everyone wants to know how I don't have any lumps in that.  Give this a try.  I'm telling you, you won't make a cake with flour again.  Delicious!!!!

Fantastic!! I gave a piece of these to several people and no one could tell it was gluten free or made of chickpeas.  They all said how rich and delicious it was.  I followed others suggestions and added 1 TSP vanilla, 5 TBSP butter and upped the Baking Powder from .5 to 1 TSP.

I made it this morning just before I left for work for my nephew that only eats chick peas so I thought let me try found it on the Internet and sounded really good . Well I made it cooled it till I needed it for his birthday cake cause he wanted something healthy. Well served  it to all the guests and they were like wow this is really good and some guests don't really eat chick peas and after they ate it they were totally  stunned.  I was so happy that it was a hit and everyone really liked it . I want to say thank you so much cause I loved it and will make it again and again cause there is always room for this amazing and wonderful cake . I will not change anything with the ingredients it's perfect the way it is.   Thank you again  I rate  a 5 star perfect

Made a 1/2 version of this but used double the baking powder but also used stevia in place of sugar and sugar free chips.  It came out great considering I used healthier sugar options while dieting.  My wife thought it was alright.  I have another in the oven as I'm typing this.  This dessert has really helped me to stay on track on my diet!

Great, moist and rich.  I recommend skinning the garbanzos before blending-tedious, but worth it to make them smoother.

I made this exactly as written and it was okay.  However, the recipe should say to grease AND FLOUR (or dust with cocoa powder).  Mine stuck to the pan and it's presentation leaves a little to be desired.  And it was very grainy/gritty.  I'm not sure why, though my food processor is very old and very cheap.  Perhaps a better food processor would yield a better texture.

Made this tonight, came out terrific. My daughter and I are gluten free but my husband isn't. He loved it and had no idea it was made with garbanzo beans. I used coconut oil to grease pan and dusted with cocoa powder. Would be great with a raspberry sauce on top. Gonna make for Easter dessert.

On Doctors orders I have to exclude gluten from my diet, and my husband was wanting a treat.  I came across this and had all items in my pantry.  I had to adjust a bit as I had a 15oz can of beans.  I did add a little vanilla, otherwise I followed it exactly.  I did make a chocolate sauce to go over it with chocolate chips and cream.  My husband says it's the best chocolate cake ever.  I must agree.  4 thumbs up.

Just made these, OMG! So good, so moist! I added the vanilla and  one can (15oz) of the beans, so I made the cup cakes. Fooled my very picky 8 yr old she lved them and then I told her they were made with beans. It was a good lesson in healthy alternatives. Can't wait to fool hubby when he gets home, he wouldn't even look at them if I told him they had garbanzo beans in them. ;) ohhh! And I dusted my pans with mocha instant coffee to give it a tiny personal flare, good add! ????

This was surprisingly very good and very simple to make.  Our extremely picky niece gobbled it right up.  I added just a tsp of vanilla and a Tbsp of instant espresso powder for extra flavor.

My two year old son ate some of it but he really likes bland food! Very disappointing that it's rated high. Also it taste better cold than hot. The texture was fine, flavor missing. And I even added butter to the chocolate chips.  I made this for healthy aspect but never gain. I hope I never have issues with gluten.

I was a little skeptical at the beginning, thinking the garbanzo beans would overpower the chocolate in the cake. What a surprise!
Made this recipe yesterday, one day before Valentines Day. 
I loved it. My husband loved it. It was light and rich, at the same time. The texture was creamy but not too heavy.
Would definitely make it again. I don't need to tweak any part of the recipe. I made it in my convection oven at the same temperature setting as stated, but only for 35 minutes.

I loved how it turned out. Although I realized halfway through preparation that I'd left my chocolate chips at the grocery store, I made do with the remainder of a bottle of mocha Kaluhua I had in the pantry, cocoa baking powder, and the handful of dark chocolate I had left from my last baking day. Also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Crumbly, but delicious.

Delicious and surprisingly moist cake.  The changes I made were adding 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  I also made some homemade whipped cream for on top.  My husband loved it!

Loved it! Moist and delish. I didn't tell anyone about the main ingredient until after they ate it and they were shocked. I think if you know you can taste the bean a little bit.

I made this for a family member (who has Celiac) b-day but didn't tell anyone at the dinner party that it was made with garbonzo beans. Everyone loved it, including the kids. Someone even told me it was the best chocolate cake they've ever had... that is how good this cake is. Thanks for this recipe, I plan to use it very often, especially because dark chocolate and beans are supposed to be good for me & I don't feel guilty about eating it at all.

I love flourless chocolate cake. Really, too much. I was excited to find one that had healthy, unusual ingredients. I made it with my 5 year old. It was super easy to make. I used my best chocolate, pureed the heck out of the beans, added a little applesauce to keep it moist. The result?  From my perspective, it was ok. It had a smooth, dense flourless-chocolate-cake texture, the flavor was chocolatey and - to me -  a little peanutty. To my 5 year old, it tasted beany, but ok. My 3 year old said it needed sugar. It evaporated from my husband's plate in seconds. I really, really missed the butter that's in a traditional flourless cake. So much so, that I likely won't be making this one again. For me, if I'm going to splurge, why not go for the truly decadent and traditional flourless cake that will leave me breathless - and this one isn't it.

My boyfriend and i tried this recipe and loved it so much that we made it again, but with a variation. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of semi-chocolate chips, we used 2 bars of Lyndt Dark Orange chocolate. We crumbled it and the rest of the chocolate we topped it off with chocolate chips. We also added some orange peel for some extra kick. About a teaspoon. We baked it in 3 different molds to make a 3 tier cake. It was fantastic!!!!! Next time, we'll try coffee in it!

Yum! I did add a full teaspoon of baking powder like previous reviewers and splashed in some organic apple sauce (maybe 1/2 cups worth?) for moistness and also a teaspoon of vanilla.  My 6 year old daughter who has quite the sensitive taste palate could definitely taste the beans, but said it was still good.  That passes for me! :)

This was ok, but I really think it could be great! I followed the recipe exactly and my cake seemed very dry. I'm am going to try some variations (less beans, more chocolate etc.) to see if I can't make this outstanding. If I am successful I will post a new recipe! -- 2/9/14 HA! Well I thought I followed it exactly but my bag of chocolate chips was 2 oz. less than most bags (which effected my measuring) and even after I discovered that; Something magical happened while the was in the fridge overnight... Chocolately perfection! The texture changed. It was indescribable. I ate the whole thing myself in about 5 days. I am about to make this amazing healthy dessert goodness for my kiddo to take to a birthday party at school. -- Treats need to be gluten-free the fact that they're made of (organic) garbanzo beans and are healthy will stay my little secret! I'm planning to dust with powered sugar and make a raspberry sauce to drizzle on. MMM! (I may have to make a second one for here at home). LOVE! LOVE! LOVE IT!  Second time around I added a big pinch of salt and a tsp of vanilla in with the eggs. Made it even better

Awesome!!!!  I followed Pam's lead and added extra baking powder, vanilla and butter to the melted chocolate. I also added about 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp espresso powder to mine and made cupcakes. The recipe made 18 cupcakes. I then topped them off with vanilla buttercream. These were so moist. First time ever making a gf recipe!!!!

My daughter has Celiac Disease and this recipe was a blessing for her sweet tooth.  I have actually had people prefer this over regular chocolate cupcakes.  I top them with my home cooked (gluten free) frosting and they're an absolute hit!.  Thanks for sharing!

Read some comments before making! I added peanutbutter, butter, and baking powder. Also, I split into 2 pans and it was cooked in 10 minutes. Turned out moist in the middle and quite tasty. I'm going to try with mint chocolate chips next time.

I've made this cake many times. Its much better than the grainy, gluten-free chocolate cakes that are available. My non-celiac family members love it. 

I made the mistake of substituting dark bakers chocolate for the semi-sweet chocolate. The result was dry and dense, I won't do that again!

Yum!!!! Everyone liked it. I thought the garbanzo beans left a little roughness. I want to try navy beans next time.

This cake is awesome . I made this for the new year and myself and my whole family could not believe how yummy it was. It was better the next day after being in the fridge it was dense like a brownie. Will definitely be making again. I did follow the recipe exactly .

Excellent, delicious and easy gluten free dessert for Christmas. I topped it with a can of cherry pie filling and a 2" whipped cream border all around.

This was my first attempt at a gluten free recipe.  The flavor was very good but not excellent.  It was difficult to serve in slices because it did crumble.  I would not make it for company but I will make it again for my family because I love the idea of chocolate cake being a good source of protein and fiber :) Thank you for the recipe!

Made this today. Didn't tell my 16yo son what it was made from until he tasted it and said it was fabulous. He would have NEVER even tasted it if he knew before! This was the easiest cake I have ever made and it is delicious!!! I didn't have corn syrup so I just added a drizzle of glycerin. I used a combination of dark and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Wonderful!! I will be making this again and again. I used my Ninja blender.

Amazing recipe! My daughter has a gluten sensitivity and was having a hard time accepting it.  I made this for a big meal so she wouldn't feel left out and even the kids were licking the plate! My guests who were afraid of the gluten free options loved it. It's now my go to dessert for any occasion.

Just made it for my family. Don't know what was better, the cake or the look on their face when I told them it had garbanzo beans in it.  They don't like beans.  Didn't change anything and they loved it.  I'll will make it again for sure.

We've discovered that my husband and daughter have a gluten sensitivity, so I've been looking for gluten free recipes. This is one of the best I've found. The whole family loved this and couldn't tell it was made with beans at all!

Tried this as a birthday cake for a 7-yr old boy who is going gluten free. I added the butter and some vanilla, as recommended, and everyone loved it!  I have had gluten free mixed brownies and cakes and they never tasted like this.  It actually tasted like a really rich chocolate brownie/cake.  I made two rounds and slathered homemade strawberry preserves with powdered sugar on top.  I also aprayed the pan and dusted with cocoa powder and added parchment paper to the bottom to reduce the chance of sticking.  I think next time I might try without the butter, or use a butter substitute, for our friend who is also dairy free.

Love this recipe and this cake. I use a high quality blender to mix the batter and the texture comes out perfectly smooth. The outside of cake will look dry, but the inside of the cake is anything but. It also got rave reviews from some of my picky family members.

This was surprisingly good...I say surprising cause I only tried it for a gluten free friend, and no one could believe they were eating cake made from beans lol.  It has a dense, rich texture and a nice chocolate flavour.  I topped it with a mint cream cheese frosting.

This gets pretty amazing reviews from coworkers and relatives.  Tip: I dump a bunch of frozen raspberries into the pan after the batter and make it in an 8x8 and call it brownies. I find it needs "something" like ice cream or similar, if it doesn't have the raspberries.
Note: the last two I made took almost DOUBLE the baking time to set up.

Made this as cupcakes and it yielded 16 (filled liners to 2/3 full)
My changes:
Used 1 whole egg plus two whites and 1/4 c. applesauce
1 tsp. baking powder
3 tbsp. butter melted in the chocolate
1/2 c. sugar

Baked for 20-23 minutes at 350 and they turned out perfectly fudgy and cakey. Topped with powdered sugar and raspberries.

I made mine into cupcakes and it took 27 minutes to bake at 350 degrees.  Mades 14 cupcakes.  I had a lot of expectations after reading the reviews.   When I took them out of the oven they kind of deflated down after a minute or two.  The cupcakes themselves was moist but I was not really fond of the taste.  My 2.5 year old daughter loved it though and at least it was slightly healthy due to the chickpeas so I'm giving this 3 stars.

I had my doubts about garbonzo beans for a cake, but I was very very pleased with the outcome!  This is the first gluten free item I've ever made, and WOW!  I did as another reviewer did, tweeked it alittle, added 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 5 Tbsp. of butter.  PLUS, I used dark chocolate chips.  And instead of a food processor, I used my blender!  Very rich cake, very moist, and I will definitely be making it again!

First time making GF dessert. I didn't want to tell my husband or guests what was in the dessert until they all tasted it. They loved how moist, perfectly sweet it was and how light it was. They were SHOCKED to find out it was garbanzos! I should have read some of the reviews that recommended peeling the garbanzo beans & using a blender -  will try next time. I used some whipped cream w/pecans or strawberrys & both were very great! I would like to try something other than white sugar. Definitely recommend.

I made this today and it came out awesome! It is similar to a brownie or a torte. It was so easy, the batter tasted like chocolate mousse, and the finished product was delicious. I didn't need to top it with powdered sugar. Sidenote: I used bittersweet chips and it was still good.

I was really skeptical when I first saw this recipe but had to give it a try since it received such a high rating from so many people.  It was incredible, loved it!  I prefer it chilled with some sliced lightly sweetened strawberries and whipped cream.  I was curious if anyone tried substituting egg whites for the eggs?  If so, does it affect the outcome at all?

Fantastic gluten free cake.  I worked with what ingredients I had on hand, so I used garbanzo bean flour, and instead of chocolate I used cocoa powder mixed with some butter, sugar and a little oil.  I also added a few tablespoons of water since I had used the flour instead of beans and thought that it might too dry.  This cake is very moist and tasty.

Sounds crazy but it works! You would never guess what it is made of. My one tip: use a blender for the beans, much smoother texture than using a food processor.

EXCELLENT! I made this and brought it to a Christmas dinner without tasting it first. Everyone loved it. A really nice consistency (both batter form and the finished cake. I made a ganache to pour over the top to give it a finished look. Also added blackberries (which everyone stole and others complained!). I love flourless chocolate cake - this will be a nice addition for a change.

I used two 15 oz cans beans, so added half again all other ingredients. I didn't want to use chocolate chips, so I followed online instructions and substituted 13 tbs cocoa powder, added 1/3 c extra sugar, and 2 tbsp coconut oil, for the recipe, since I increased other amounts. It made two small cakes. I used coconut palm sugar, instead of white, as I try to stay away from cane sugar. Then, it turned out I didn't have enough cocoa powder, (only had about 1/4 c), so I added chocolate chips, anyway, without melting them first, about 1/4 c, and blended the whole thing in my ninja (like a food processor). It turned out wonderfully! Great recipe. This is the second time I've made it. The first time, I followed the recipe. Both times, I've really enjoyed this cake! The texture is very good, as is the flavor.

Loved it! Added a bit more chocolate (270 g), and vanilla. The consistency is great as long as you make sure the gaarbanzo bean mixture is completely smooth. Separated the eggs, whipped the whites and folded them in. Baked for 35 minutes to keep it moist.

I made this tonight. Very good flavor, excellent with vanilla ice cream. My cake turned out a bit crumbly...although being gluten free, I expect texture diffences. Easy recipe, will make again!

I've made this recipe a couple of times, to absolute rave reviews.  However, I have a question - I have never been able to find a 19 oz can of garbanzo beans, only 15 oz.  Is that size correct?

I had my favourite chocolate cake recipe that I used for years and now I am a convert.  This was a very simple, delicious twist on ingredients which I absolutely loved.  I have been a huge chick pea fan since a child and this is great healthy way of incorporating them into a dessert.

I made 80 cupcakes using this recipe and frosted them with a coconut frosting (like german chocolate cake) to take to a festival. They were such a hit! No one knew I'd made them so when I heard people nearby talking about how good they were I knew this recipe was a winner. I had multiple requests for the recipe after the event.

To make them I put everything in my vitamix (except the chocolate chips) and blended it until it was smooth. Then I melted the chocolate chips and put them in the mixture and blended it for about 30 seconds longer. Poured them into my cupcake pans and baked. It was very easy and no mess.

Made it out of curiosity.  I kept it plain, no nuts, no icing just to see what it REALLY tasted like.  It was excellent, fudgy and sweet.  Shared it with the guys at work THEN told them what was in it after the rave reviews.  Making it again tonight for our potluck.  The ONLY thing I would do is cut the baking time by 5 minutes.  Could just be my oven tho.

This was delicious!  My daughter has Celiac disease, so gluten-free foods for her are a must.  She didn't know what was in the recipe until after she tasted it, and she absolutely loved it.  Our whole family did, and we didn't miss the flour at all.  Moist, easy to make, and great with a scoop of ice cream!  Will definitely make again--may try doubling the recipe and make a bundt or two-layer cake.

Someone posted this on MyFitnessPal.com and I tried it merely out of curiosity.  I didn't have a round cake pan so I used my brownie pan.  The top gets a kind of glazed crust, so if you were to dust it with powdered sugar, it wouldn't really stay unless you flipped the cake out.  So I served it plain and called it brownies, for my 14 yr old son who has to have frosting on his cake.  He was on his 2nd before I even got my husband and I served up!  When I told him it was made with garbanzo beans, he said "I don't care.  Tastes like brownies!"  Will be happy to share this recipe with my friends with celiac.

Like many others I had to make this because it sounded too weird to be true. It's great! My first gluten free baked good! It's nice not to have to use a weird textured GF flour. I didn't know if I should remove the skins of the beans so I did just to play it safe. I love the extra protein & could use more in my diet. I thought it was a tad too sweet but that's an easy fix. Super simple & delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!

Awesome gluten free recipe!  I've never made one before and was worried but made it for a friend at work with celiac disease.  This turned out like a really moist brownie without the heavy weight.

This is a great flourless chocolate cake. I made it for a potluck..it was gone in minutes. Everyone told me how rich and delicious it was. When I told a couple of the people it was made with a can of garbanzo beans they were shocked! I made another for my family..they love it! My daughter had no idea a can of garbanzos made her this wonderfully chocolatey cake. It needs no frosting. It is truly delicious made exactly as the recipe is written. Make sure you process the beans well or there will be chunks of beans. It is a truly easy and delicious cake. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Surprizingly delicious - the texture is something between cake and mousse. Used a mix of semi sweet and dark chocolate chips, so all in all was able to feel quite virtuous eating this wonderful desert!

Thank you for this recipe!  I am a chocolate lover, an addict even, and these actually satisfy.  I especially love that I can bake these in a 9"x9" square pan and once almost cool, cut into brownies for freezing and later enjoyment; a healthier "treat" in the lunch bag.  I could see this being flexible for additions like coconut icing, bananas added into batter or icing or of course... chocolate icing (but still great without).  Freezing may have helped keep them moist.

The recipe sounded interesting.  I made it today and was pleased with the outcome.  I followed other suggestions and used dark chocolate chips, and added remaining 1/2 cup chips not melted to mixture.  Also added a splash of vanilla extract.  It was tasty but not moist enough for me.  Would recommend for those following a gluten free diet.

WOW!
This cake is amazing! I too was hesitant about puting beans in a cake (main ingredient too), but I was pleasantly suprised. This is excellent!
I added 1/2 tbs of vanilla and only used about 5 TBSP of sugar as I really watch my sugar intake. 
I will without a doubt make this again soon!

Initially the texture was fudgy, but as it cooled it became dry. The flavor is beany and not very favorable. I probably won't make again, but if I do, Ill add a teaspoon or two of vanilla

I made this for Mother's Day and my mom loved it. No one could believe the main ingredient is garbanzo beans! I will make this again and again. It's easy and tastes great and my gluten-free guests loved it as much as the guests without gluten sensitivity.

I was skeptical of this recipe. Beans and chocolate? It sounded weird, but wanted to try to get my kids to eat something healthier. My son who HATES beans couldn't stop eating them. I did tweek it a little though. I added vanilla, used Splenda and dark chocolate chips. I didn't have enough so I added a tbs. of Hershey dark cocao powder. I baked them into cute little bite size muffins. Maybe next time I make them I'll add a few mini chocolate chips into the muffins for that extra bite or maybe some fruit to top it off.

this is a MUST try. Very easy and if you blend the beans really well the texture is smooth and dense that adds the richness of the cocoa. A Celiac must.

Fantastic. I made them into cupcakes. However, I made a mistake. I sprayed the bottom of the pan with PAM to keep the cups from sticking. I won't do that again because the PAM got the cups all moist which screwed up the bottom of the cupcakes. I followed others suggestions and used teaspoon of vanilla and threw about 3TBS of butter in with the chocolate. I also threw a couple of Andes Mint Chips on top before baking. But they were sooo good. I mean awesome. Will make again. But next time I am going to use egg replacer for my vegan friends. I will update after I attempt that.

I was hesitant about this but it was great! Next time I will cook dried chickpeas myself and process them as the recipe says...just to see if the texture of the cake comes out even smoother. I just find that the canned garbanzo's are firmer, and while not unappealing, a wee bit grainier...as if nuts were blended up for the cake. I cook my own chickpeas and blend for homemade hummus. They end up so much smoother than the canned, which leads me to believe the cake would be as well.

This was delicious! I added coconut to my batter, and then topped the cake with whipped cream, more coconut, fresh strawberries, and pecans. Insanely delicous! I did increase the baking powder by a smidge because mine was expired, and I wasn't too sure how well it would work. Ridiculously good!

Oh Wow!  The first gluten free dessert I've ever tried and it is delicious!  I always add a tablespoon of instant coffee to chocolate cakes and did so with this one as well.  I'm sure it'd be fantastic without!!!

I am with the others that just don't get how this recipe gets so many rave reviews. I made this exactly according to the directions and the texture is not the best. I baked it for less time than the recipe suggests and it still came out dry and crumbly. The flavor was good, but the texture was so off. I would be curious to try making it with black beans instead and add a smidge of butter to help out with the texture/moisture.

I have a gluten sensitivity and was so excited to try this recipe.  It was wonderful!  So wonderful that my two kids, my husband, my sister, my nephews, etc. all loved it and had seconds and thirds.  It is pretty crumbly - be warned about that.  It eats like a brownie.  It is also pretty dense and feels like a meal.  But the flavor is delicious, the cake is moist and smooth, and it isn't overly sweet.  I'm keeping this recipe forever.

This cake is delicious, I did 1 1/2 times the recipe and added about 3 tbsp of butter when melting the chocolate. My friends loved it and couldn't believe there were garbanzo beans in it.

I made this as cupcakes for a gluten-free friend. I used one large and one individual size can of beans to get up to the 19 oz, cut the sugar as suggested, added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp extra baking powder and 3 T. butter (melted with the chocolate). Baked the cupcakes in tins that were sprayed with cooking spray and then dusted with white sugar (a trick I learned from making bundt cakes). Filled each cup to the top. This made 14 cupcakes. 
    The cupcakes were nice and moist and looked good too. Just be careful removing them from the tins so the edges don't break off. My friend was delighted with the results!

Pretty good, although I might use more sugar next time. I over cooked it even though it was in there for 40 mins. Kind of like a large brownie.
I used a blender. First I beat the eggs, then I put the eggs and the beans in a separate bowl.  Then I blended the bean mixture in small 1/2 cup batches in the blender on Puree setting. I transferred each blended batch to another bowl and then when all was smooth as baby food, I combined it with the rest of the ingredients in the blender. About when I added the chocolate, I had to put it on a higher speed. I stopped every time I heard the motor change tone (air bubbles.)

Make sure you SCRAPE OWN THE SIDES often so you don't get a stray chunk of bean in the batter. I lined the bottom with parchment paper and dusted the sides with cornstarch. I made this for a friend who is Celiac but I don't have rice flour and all the special gluten-free flours on hand. 

I am guessing you could actually do this with unflavored hummus instead of the beans, but you would have to use less than 19 ounces and there is a possibility it could be grainy. It would make it a lot easier to make, though.

Terrific recipe. I love that it's so much more healthy with the beans...

My whole family really liked this cake - and I liked that it wasn't full of fat and useless carbs!  Loved the texture - less greasy and heavy than a brownie, but lighter and more fudgey than a cake.  

I did make a few additions, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  

Being picky, I cooked dried garbanzo beans because they have a nuttier taste than the canned beans.   

My additions are the following:  I did not add salt to the beans while they cooked, so I had to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the bean and egg mixture.  For a richer flavor, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the bean mixture and I added 1 teaspoon of espresso powder to the chocolate while it was melting.

This was good, but I'm not sure why people are quite so crazy about it.  I certainly wouldn't replace my standard chocolate cake recipe with this, but it was indeed a lot nicer than I'd have thought a bean cake could be.

This cake was so good:) I made this cake for my boyfriends family, between the 4 of them they have nut, dairy, gluten and yeast allergies so let's just say I had a very difficult time finding a recipe. When I came across this recipe I was a little sceptical because I had never heard about using beans in baking, but based on the reviews I decided to try it anyways. I am VERY glad I tried it because it was delicious! I also topped the cake with my dairy-free mocha frosting and fresh raspberries which complimented it perfectly! You can not taste the chick peas one bit, but make sure that they are fully blended into a thick paste (you don't want chunks of chickpeas in the cake:P) and no one will know your secret ingredient! I also love that it's much healthier and since it is so rich a little piece goes a long way!

Okay I was very skeptical about this.  But it is sooo good.  My toddler loves it too.  Can't wait for my husband to try it.  I will next time work on tweaking it with egg whites and less sugar but it is very nice and will be great with some fresh fruit this summer.

If you take it out a little early so its still moist but not raw on the inside, and add sliced carmelized strawberries with gooey drizzled chocolate on top, refridgerate.....and the texture is like cheesecake. So moist and delicious!!! My favorite cake of all time.

This cake is so good it's dangerous! It tastes just like brownies without the guilt. Loved it. It is so weird that beans can taste this good. I thought that it would turn out flat and lifeless but it came out puffy and gorgeous. Thanks CCUMMINS

This is my absolute favorite chocolate cake! It's very moist and flavorful and so fast to prepare. Although I was a bit concerned about it, one doesn't taste the garbanzo beans at all. I will definitely make this again, most likely to give a great example for the fact that gluten free baked goods don't have to taste weird or bland.

All I can say is "WOW"! I made this for my five year old son who was put on a gluten free diet by his doctor. The only substitution I made was to replace the sugar with xylitol.  No one believed it had garbanzo beans instead of flour. Everyone loved it, from kids to grandparents! Even the picky eaters!  This is definitely a keeper!! Thanks for the great recipe.

I accidentally used the wrong measuring cup when measuring out the chocolate chips (instead of three 1/2 cups, I used three 1/3 cups and ended up only using 1 cup chocolate chips). I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. Despite the cut in chocolate chips, it still came out delicious. Still wished I had included all the chips though!

Add 1 tsp of vanilla and omit the powdered sugar on top. It's delicious! I have made it twice and every time I ask people to guess what the main ingredient is and no one believes me! :) It sounds crazy, but give it a try! You won't regret it!

Moist, light nutty flavor and very chocolate-y (couldn't find 19 oz can of beans, so used 1 1/2 15 oz cans and 15 oz melted dark chocolate). Had a small birthday party with various people allergic to gluten, dairy, soy, corn, peanuts, etc and this cake catered to all of them (although we had to adjust type of chocolate, check for corn starch in baking powder, powdered sugar and the vanilla extract).

I was hesitant about making this cake, because I never made a cake with beans before. Since we were having a dinner party and my friend has Celiac disease, I made this cake. Everyone raved about this cake, and I um, ate three pieces! It was fabulous!

I found this recipe on my wife's Ipad with the allrecipes.com app.  I was skeptical of the recipe, but was in the mood to try something different.  I used a cake stencil to decorate with confectioner's sugar on top.  Made a chocolate frosting and piped some around the edges and made some dollops around a top.  Brought it to work and it was a big hit!  Most people said it tasted like a really good brownie.

This cake is awesome!  I can't beleive that is so tastey when it was incredibly easy to make and with so few ingredients.  There are so many ways you can change it up a little to create other high protein treats.  Really love it : )

Delicious! I can not have garbanzo beans, so I substituted black beans and it turned out great!!! I added some vanilla and additional cocoa powder and even chopped some nuts on top! This is a staple recipe that can be changed and modified to suit you sweet tooth! Awesome!

DELICIOUS!!!! I was so excited to try this. I was not disappointed at all! It actually is the exaxt type of brownie texture I've been searching for. Lightly crisp on the top and rich & fudgy in the middle. I used the Hershey's Special Dark chips instead of semi sweet. I will be making this forever!!

This was AWESOME! I've made this twice, once as cupcakes and the second time as a two layer cake. I made 2, 9inch rounds and stacked them, with a bittersweet frosting between the layers ( I just threw one together from butter, cream cheese, coco powder, and a touch of heavy cream). Then I topped it with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries, served with a side of whipped cream. 10 stars!!! Even my Hubby, who doesn't like chocolate cake, said it was "glorious".

OMG! i did not think it was going to be so good. I did as one reviewer suggested and powdered my pan with cocoa. I also only used 1 cup of semi sweet chips because that was all i had and i used 15oz can of garbanzo beans. I added 2Tbps of butter with chocolate and 1/2 tps of vanilla flavor. I will make again.

Surprsingly good. One note is to make sure you scrape down the sides of the food processor to make sure there aren't any bean pieces and add vanilla. My 9 year old saw the recipe and didn't want to try it. But she did and says: "You should try this cake! It is great. you can't taste the garbanzo beans. It is SO chocolatey!" That's good enough for me.

This was an amazing cake! I was so impressed. I could not even taste the beans. I wanted to find a cake that I could make for my daughter who is almost 1 and this will be the one!  I might not use as many chocolate chips since it was very chocolately in taste. I added vanilla and a tsp. of baking powder instead of half.

Wow!! It was amazing! My 8 year old ate 3/4's of it and his two younger brothers were looking for more the next day! Just a hint - you can ever so slightly taste the chick peas when the cake is still warm but the next day there was no chickpea taste. Also make sure the chick peas are pureed as much as you can. I was still noticing some skins in the batter but my processor isn't that great.  Next time I will try it with nuts and an icing. It was better than my family brownie recipe!!

I made this recipe as stated and it tasted pretty good. It is a little grainy, but I couldn't taste the beans. I will probably make it again, maybe with some coffee or mint flavoring.

This was pretty good. I used an egg replacement (Ener-G) because I'm vegan. These came out more brownie-like than cake-like. I have to say this though, use 2 cups of chocolate chips instead. The batter may taste great and chocolatey but once baked the beans taste really comes through. This is a nice alternative to cake or brownies I should say. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious cake.  We followed the suggestion of the reviewer who said to put strawberries and powered sugar on top.  This is a very rich cake and the strawberries complement it nicely.

Great recipe.  I want to try and use egg substitute and splenda next time around.  Otherwise, the cake was moist and rich-a big hit.  I made cupcakes and baked them for 25 minutes.  Good suggestion to fill cupcakes to nearly the top.

Very yummy. I was surprised, the chocolate covered up the garbanzo bean taste nicely. I covered it in a chocolate fudgy type icing and it was like a brownie. Maybe I didn't cook it long enough or maybe it's not supposed to be as dry as a cake. Either way, this is my new brownie of choice.

My celiac daughter made this for a dinner party I was having.  Everyone raved and then the truth came out!  No flour, garbanzo beans instead!  People were incredulous and everyone wanted the recipe!  How nice.

this cake tasted sooooooooooo good. I didn't know how it would turn out with garbanzo beans in it, but it was great!  Texturally its very smooth and doesn't have the texture of cake in the first bite, but is perfect after the first bite. My hubby had no suggestions. I served it with a dip of vanilla ice cream. Only issue I had was it stuck to my pan, not sure if I should let it cool  completely next time or just leave it in the pan...there will be a NEXT time...in a couple days.

Very delicious!  I can definitely see how the different types of chocolate chips would adjust the flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the best Gluten Free Chocolate Cake I have ever eaten. My husband who hates Chocolate Cake never mind Gluten Free anything had half the cake.  When I told him the main ingredient he refused to believe me, I had to show him the recipe and then he just kept saying I can't believe it...

Very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly but it was a touch dry. Still good and chocolately though. Not sure what I could do next time to improve the dryness.

This recipe tasted great.  The garbanzo beans created a very light texture and the chocolate flavor was not too strong.

For a healthier option, this is quite good. It's not terribly sweet, but I found once I knew what to expect I enjoyed them. Hubby never suspected what was in these :). I did as cupcakes and greased them with cooking spray and baked about 25 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!

I really wanted to make this but I didn't have any whole eggs so I sub with 1/2 cup liquid egg white and only used 2/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa  1/2 cup cream cheese  put everything in a blender and then pour in a greased and floured cake pan fantastic .......   So don't be scared to sub liquid egg white for whole eggs

I made this cake for Easter. The cake was edible with sliced strawberries and whipped cream, but alone it was hard to get passed the rich grainy mousse/very moist brownie texture. My family and guests said it was lacking the chocolate flavor and have kindly asked me not to make this again.

I doubled the recipe. Microwaved milk chocolate chips with about 3 tbsp of vegetable oil in 20 sec increments until it was melted. Only had 7 eggs, so also added about 1/4 cup of blueberry applesauce. Blended the garbanzo beans and eggs, then mixed everything else together in a bowl. Used 1 cup of agave nectar instead of 1 1/2cups of sugar. Added 2 tsp of vanilla extract and 2 tsp of salt. When it was all mixed together it looked a bit runny so I added about 1/2 - 1 cup of a gluten free flour mix. Baked it at 350 degrees for about 40 mins and the edges looked quite done with the centre still gooey. I lowered the temperature and baked for about another 30 minutes or so. I didn't use confectioners' sugar. The cake actually tasted pretty good and my daughter ate for her 1st birthday cake. Will make again with the same changes and will likely recommend.

Really, really good!  Cooked this for my chocoholic-husband on his birthday and he loved it.  I told him there was a secret ingredient, but he couldn't guess it.  I will definitely make this one a lot.  The directions couldn't be easier, and I really liked this could be whipped up easily in the food processor.   Next time I might try putting a pinch of espresso powder in to enhance the cocoa flavor.

Very skeptical before I added melted chocolate.  Skeptical until I ate it.  Superb.  Excellent chocolate flavor, wonderful Cheesecake like texture.  I thought of adding a bit of yogurt on the first day but like another reviewer, my vote is to make a day ahead and enjoy on the second day.  It was crumbly first day, not so much on the second day.  I cut it into small squares and placed on a tray.  Then dusted with powedered sugar.  It is my experience that hot food has a stronger flavor than the same food cold.  I didn't want to take a chance and refrigerated it before serving.  One of the best parts...tempting everyone with "chocolate cake", seeing them drool over it as I took it from the oven, ask for seconds and THEN tell them it is made with garbanzo beans.  I am ready for April Fool's.  BTW, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  Enjoyed with a glass of milk.  We are gluten eaters and just made the cake because I am trying to reduce my refined flour intake and of course, I was curious.  :)

I found this recipe some time last year and tried it out. As usual I was apprehensive because it was a new recipe. However! Everything was done in the blender, it was really simple and tasted amazing! I've made it multiple times now. It is quite dense so there have been a few times where I have added more baking powder, which makes them more like brownies. When I serve it I sprinkle some icing sugar on top and then decorate it with raspberries. Next time I make it I'm going to try and add coffee to it.  Great recipe! Definitely repeatable!

This cake was amazing!!! I made it last weekend for a family party, because 1 of the children is allergic to wheat. I ended up making two and using them as layers with homemade wildberry jam in the middle and frosted with fudge icing served with additional wildberry sauce. It was fantastic!! Thanks for the recipe.

This cake was divine! All i can think is "healthy chocolate cake, where have you been all my life!?!" It stuck to the pan a bit for me but i was skimpy on the greasing since it was a non-stick pan, next time i'll do a better job and hopefully that will help. I drizzled mine with a vanilla glaze and topped it with raspberries and vanilla soy ice cream. It was wonderful! PLUS this cake only takes 5 minutes to make! I will make this all the time from now on!

This was awesome!  I actually made it as brownies to take to girls night and I had 5 people (out of 7) ask me for the recipe.  They said the real test would be to try them out on their kids....their kids and mine loved them!  I will definitely make this again as MIL has celiac.

Wow, this cake is incredible! Even though you can't taste the beans distinctly, I think they give this cake a taste that differs a bit from other chocolate cakes - in a good way, of course. I make cupcakes rather than a round cake; 9 cupcakes, to be exact. Baked them for about 25 minutes. On the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the baking powder and added vanilla extract. Was forced to use a 16 ounce can of garbanzo beans, since I couldn't find 19 ounce cans. The cupcakes are quite dense and fudgy...they're more like brownies than cake. But that's fine by me, because the taste is incredible!

Chose your recipe for a guest who is suffering from celiac and I'm happy and thankful for your contribution. It was moist, delicious and a hit with all my guests AND TO THINK HOW NUTRITIOUS IT IS... AMAZING! I simply adjusted the recipe by adding a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract and two squares of Lindt 70% dark chocolate (and a pinch of butter while I was melting the chocolate) being a true lover of chocolate. THANK YOU!  Next time I will dress it up with rasberries, as suggested in one of the photos.

FAN-TAS-Tic!!! I've made it twice now, once with bitter-sweet chocolate and once with unsweetened. I used Agave nectar each time as I have refined sugar allergies. I also added vanilla flavored Stevia and a couple of tablespoons of  arrowroot or coconut flour. Very brownie-like. Next I'll try a banana. I'm just so excited to find an awesome dessert w/out wheat AND sugar! Thanks so much!

It was an experience to make this cake out of garbonzo beans.  I did add 1/4 cup of apple sauce as others have done to keep it moist.  I have to say that the cake was moist but the chocolate flavor didn't seem to stand out to me.

A GLUTEN FREE TREASURE!!! everyone who tried it loved it. its more like a brownie or fudge than a cake. We ate it warmed up with icecream. If you usually eat healthy this is definitely a delicious protien packed treat... if your expecting your classic chocolate cake you will be sorely dissapointed. (it DOES have beans in it remember)

It's hard to believe there's no flour in this cake when you eat it. Delicious and simple. Ibwasnt even looking to make chocolate cake. I had extra vans of garbanzo beans and cane across this recipe when looking for something to use them in. Sweet surprise!

This recipe is amazing. It actually turns out just like real cake, even though there is no flour in it.It has a great texture and a nice chocolately flavour and isn't overly sweet. I added some chocolate shunks into mine and it was delicious.    I thought I wouldn't get to eat cake again after I found out I had a gluten intolerance, but now I can, thanks for sharing this great recipe :)

Made this cake to celebrate a birthday of a person with a gluten allergy.  All were crazy about it!  I read all the reviews & made the following adjustments: used 15 oz. can of garbanzo beans, added 4 oz. of natural applesauce,  1 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  Melted about 1/2 cup of dk. choc. chips for the frosting.  I used a cake pan which has a push up bottom; put parchment paper on it, which I'd sprayed with oil and dusted with cocoa. Had no problem removing it and no crumbling.  I'd like to try adding chopped nuts or perhaps, some mint flavoring.  There are many options; use your imagination and enjoy!

Good flavor; the texture is a little different but I'm told normal for gluten free.  However, I wish there was a better way to mash up the garbanzo beans so they aren't so grainy.

This was fantastic. I did have a problem with it sticking to the pan, but I had to use a wider, shallower pan than called for so that affected the baking times, and probably the sticking. I brought this to a housewarming and everyone loved it. Two people that do a lot of baking were able to guess there was some kind of bean in it, but that didn't stop them eating it!

Very nice cake, the people who tried it said they couldnt tell it was made from garbanzo beans/chickpeas and I agree! Strangely though, instead of getting dry and stale over the last couple of days its getting soggier and more fudgy! I'm glad I didnt put icing on it - it might have turned into a big damp mess if I had. I am going to try putting in more chocolate next time though, wasnt quite chocolatey enough for me

Garbanzo beans and chick peas are the same bean. Processo has chick beans in 19 oz.can. I used 1 can, 1 banana, 1tsp. vanilla. 1/2 cup spenda. I don't like food too sweet. It came out perfect. Cut easy. Taste just like a cake. Can't believe it.

This was pretty good, but definitely best when it's right out of the oven.  It seems to get a little soggy after being in the refrigerator a few days.

I have made this twice.  What a great substitute for chocolate cake while still getting protein.  It really has the consistency of chocolate cake.

I've just gone gluten free (almosts) and I love this cake. I've made it 3 times now, the third time I added 1/2 tub of soft cream cheese to the mix to give it a chocolate cheese cake texture/flavour and I pureed strawberries to and added to a simple syrup and a bit of cornstarch to make a wonderful topping. Everyone loved it especially my kids.

Awesome recipe...my kids gobbled it up. Because I was making mini cupcakes I added a couple things: 1 tbsp of gluten free flour and I also added a teaspoon of cocoa powder. Came out wonderful! Thanks

Four stars because immediately this cake has too strong of a garbanzo bean taste, but served after TWO DAYS, this cake becomes dense, moist, and delicious. I put peanut butter frosting on it. Try making it and waiting two days before eating it. It's PERFECT now!

Quite a mess to make(my food processor apparently isn't large enough) but well worth the effort. I even shared it with our elderly neighbors that are scared to death of any of my "vegetarian" ("I'm not eating TOFU!")meals.  Really good, not too sweet, but just a little dry.  I will definately make this again.

I made this for my mother-in law who has a gluten allergy. Wow this cake is like a brownie but not quit as thick still flaky as a cake. Nice chocolate flavor but not rich. I didn't add icing, really don't think it needs anything all. My cake did sink but was still so good will make again.

This cake is unreal! I can't believe how chocolatey and dense it is! I took it to work and no one could guess chickpeas were in it. I don't have a gluten allergy, but I was so curious about this cake I just had to make it. I will definitely make it again!! Great recipe!

This is DEFINITELY an amazing recipe! The cake had just the right amount of sweetness and the taste of the garbanzo beans harmoniously blended with the chocolate. The consistency of the cake was just like a cake made with flour! I made a sugar-free version by using 3 oz. of unsweetened baking chocolate (nestle and ghirardelli) and doubled the amount of sugar. Will make again and again . . . and again!!!

This was great! I made this for my father, (celiac) while visiting on vacation. The only problem was that we couldn't keep the teens and other men out of it. They ate half as soon as it came out of the oven and I had to bake a second cake for Dad to take home. The chocolate smell while it was baking was phenomenal. I pureed the daylights out of the garbanzo beans, but just in case there were bits that didn't puree, I added chopped pecans. Very tasty

This is a great recipe. I substituted turbinado sugar for the white sugar and I used gluten/dairy free semisweet chocolate chips, and had no problems at all. My only issue (my own fault) was that I didn't have a 9" cake pan to use, so I used a round stoneware bar pan instead--that meant that mine really resembled brownies rather than cake. Regardless, the texture and flavor were excellent. I held onto a couple of the chocolate chips until the end and dropped them on top to melt when adding the powdered sugar. My hubby and I are just getting into eating gluten-free, and he was impressed with the flavor and the texture. This cake is a good option for us.

FABULOUS!! My son has gluten allergies and all but gave up looking for an edible dessert.  I gave this a try, I added vanilla, cut the sugar in half and added a whole teaspoon of baking powder. My son could not believe it! I even like them and I wont eat any bean.  Thanks for this recipe.

This recipe seemed worth trying for a gluten-intolerant friend, but I'll make this again for my own family.  If I really thought about the beans, I guess I could taste them slightly, but no one else guessed it was gluten-free or had garbanzo beans in it.  How nice to have something to offer my friend that didn't require a search all over town for special ingredients!

Won my skeptical husband over. The only changes to ingredients were to add a bit of vanilla, replace two of the eggs with four whites, and dust the pan with Ghiradelli cocoa.  Also I used a 7" white corning dish which took about 60 minutes vs. the 40 but it looks more impressive. Will make this one again for sure.

I have battled finding good cake recipes since I became allergic to wheat.  This is so good and easy!  I do not have a food processor yet, so I just put all the ingredients into my blender...it works fine.    I have passed this recipe on to many people that just love the cake...even though they can eat the traditional flour based kind.  Thanks so much!

I have a friend who refuses to eat anything healthy or non-processed, especially vegetables, beans, fruits etc.  I made this cake and took her some, and she absolutely loved it!  I told her it was made with beans (which she hates) and she told me she didn't care, to bring her more!  Definitely a 5-star recipe!  I didn't change a thing!

I've baked this cake  twice already, and I absolutely love it!  I didn't have large eggs on hand, so I used 2 extra large eggs, and an all natural alternative to sugar (Truvia).  I also tried this cake in the microwave oven, and it cooked perfectly for 7 minutes at a high setting.  This is definitely my go-to chocolate cake.

I just had to try this recipe. A chickpea chocolate cake?!? It's delicious though- moist, dense, rich... just the way I like my chocolate cake. But best of all, it caters to my gluten free, lactose intolerant, nut allergy and vegan friends. And my sweet tooth with minimal guilt. Forget the chocolate chips and go with at least 60% chocolate!

This was very tasty and very easy. I made one last week, except I added vanilla extract. Made it again this past Sunday, didn't have enough choc chips so I added dark choc cocoa powder, forgot the vanilla, but it was still GREAT. This is my mid morning snack. Love...love...love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So so soooo yummy! I never thought I would ever bake a chocolate cake using chickpeas! I forgot to add the baking powder, and it still turned out fantastic.  This recipe's definitely a keeper!

Made this cake for dh who is on a Gluten free diet.  The only change I made was using a 15 oz can of beans and using GF cocoa to dust the pan  I knew when I tasted the raw batter that this cake was going to be good and it was.  Served it at a party and there was only a sliver left.  That sliver went to school with my daughter who traded it to a friend who loved it!! And what makes us all LOL is that that kid won't eat veggies :)  One thing I would suggest: use a springform pan and line it with parchment.  Makes it much easier to get it out.

Fantastic cake - you would hardly know that there were garbanzo beans in it.

My mother, who is a VERY fussy eater, was recently diagnosed with celiac's disease.  I made this cake for her without telling her what was in it.  Everyone loved it, especially her!  It is rich and chocolatey... very delicious.  My mother said that it was a good thing I didn't tell her before hand because she never would have eaten anything with BEANS in it, but now she requests it all the time!

This got rave reviews at girl's night.  No one guessed it included beans as a key ingredient!  Worked okay in a springform, though the bottom stuck a bit.

I would make this recipe again, just to lick the bowl. Thank you to the creater for keeping me sane while on a dairy/soy/egg/wheat/nut free diet! Used egg-replacer and still worked out dandy.

Thought the cake had a good flavour but a little dry. Tasted nice served with ice cream and berries.

Was pleasantly surprised.  The garbanzo beans didn't puree all the way and were kind of chunky but turned out good because they were like nuts.

Followed the recipe exact and it turned out awesome! Broke as I was removing it from the pan, but it doesn't change the taste or stopping me from rating it a 5! (it was probably my mistake, anyhow!) Can't wait to make it for my family!

Finding out that my son and I need to be on a gluten free diet I have been searching for recipes that will work for the whole family.  I wasn't sure what I was getting into with the garbanzo beans. This cake was good.  We liked the chocolate taste yet the texture was just a bit off.  I would have liked for it to be just a bit moister.  I did use half splenda and half sugar so that we would have a bit less calories. I will definitely be making it again. I will use some of the other suggestions so I can get this where I can say it is absolutely great.

pretty good.  I will probably make again.  I added some vanilla flavoring to cover the "bean" taste.  very slight bean taste. DH actually thought it was pretty good.

Recipe is easy to follow, easy to assemble, and the finished product is incredibly surprising. Not exactly a cake, but more like cake-like brownies. My husband and brother, who are anti-bean anything, totally got a kick out of it!!

Oh my yummm! My teen is a vegetarian and it looks like she has Celiac as well. Cooking for her is a huge challenge when every food that is good for her is rejected. It was nice to see her happy about this cake. P.S. lets not tell her how we made it.

Not low-calorie, but it does provide fiber and protein.  My friends had no idea it was made with chickpeas!  Great fudgy taste, though turned out a bit crumbly.  I added chopped macadamias and white chocolate chips.  Will DEFINITELY make again!
