I served this to accompany our Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  Some even said it was the best dish on the table.  The only change i had to make was to use a larger pan.  9x13 was way too small.  Thanks!

This was a nice change from the traditional cornbread dressing/stuffing. I used turkey sausage because my family does not eat pork, and I could not find sage-flavored sausage, so I added it to the recipe. I also cut the recipe in half, and it still filled a 2-qt dish. Very good overall.

This was a great recipe... I didn't give it a 5 because my dad's recipe is the best. He passed away this year and had never written down his recipe. This one was the closest we found... not quite the same (maybe its because I had to make it and not my dad) but it was really good.The Water Chestnuts are a great touch!

This is one of the best dressing recipes I have ever used. I found it best with a sage sausage.  It's been a hit everywhere we have taken it.

This was pretty good. I thought it had a bit too much sausage and not nearly enough vegetables. It wasn't very colorful so I ended up adding about 3/4 cup more celery and sprinkled some parsley on top. It was too wet at first but I cooked it for about 35 minutes in the oven and it turned out nicely.

I substituted regular turkey sausage and added thyme instead of sage.  Also, my husband mistakenly bought only one pound of sausage, which we didn't discover until Thanksgiving day.  The recipe as is seemed a bit heavy on the sausage and light on the rice anyway, so I used just the one pound of sausage.  I also omitted the mushrooms for my family members who don't like them.  The result was great and got rave reviews.

I made this for our pre-Thanksgiving dinner.  It was such a big hit everyone wanted to take some home! My Sister-in-law, after tasting it, said that it is a family "keeper"!  The family cooks will make this again and again.

I have made this stuffing for the past 3 years. It's quick and easy - and Gluten Free. I plan to halve the recipe this year and attempt a GF bread stuffing also.

I made this last year at Christmas and my family was over the moon!  To add another level of flavor, add approx. 1/2 cup fresh cranberries -- yum!

I added a little extra seasoning...sage and garlic.  This was a hit at our Thanksgiving/Christmas gathering.  My brother was particularly impressed as he has a wheat allergy and cannot usually have stuffing or dressing.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love wild rice.  The combination of all ingrediants creates a wonderful flavor.  I served this with wild duck and turkey dinner.  Big hit and all loved it.

This dish was a complete HIT!!!
People loved it so much I had 12 of 19 people asking for the recipe.  I added more wild rice to the recipe.  When beating the eggs, I added 1tbls of ground sage.  Then I added the eggs to the rice mixture and put the dish in the oven.

I made this recipe at least 5 times, and my family enjoyed it every time. I tweaked the components a little: I skip eggs altogether, and add chopped apple to celery mixture. I also like to add some nuts before the last baking step: cashews, pine nuts or almonds, whatever I have handy at the time.

i thought it should've been more rice for the amount of meat that was in it...my family isn't fans of mushrooms so omitted that but added a habanero cheese and it turned out good..also was skeptical about water chestnuts but it added a nice crunchy texture to it.

This dish was the hit of our recent Thanksgiving Day meal!  My brother (a chef in his own right) has asked for this recipe so he can serve it to his in-laws for Christmas.  I'll be making this one again and again.

My family loves this dish.  I often use a locally made pork sausage without the sage and just a some dried sage.  I've made the recipe without any changes and it is great.  I've also substituted canned mushrooms and added other vegetable I had on hand.  It was just as good.  Try spinach, bell peppers, or chopped broccoli.  So easy to make and great for using up leftover fresh veggies.

This is so easy to make and absolutely delicious.  My husband couldn't wait he had to have a bowl before it hit the oven (prior to the eggs) and he loved it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it will become a Thanksgiving tradition in our family.

This was really very good. I strayed from the directions a little bit and used 2 pkgs. of the sage flavored sausage, so the rice was a bit overpowered by the sage. Next time I'll definitely do as directed (imagine!) and use only one pkg sage flavored. This was a tasty alternative to bread stuffing and very well received by the entire family.

This was spectacular. A great change from regular bread stuffing - I made a bread stuffing per my husband's request, but I didn't even touch it once I tried this! It does make a lot, so I will probably cut the recipe in half next time.

We make this for holiday potlucks. Occasionally we will make a miniature version with 1 sausage, 1 rice, can mushrooms and cream soup for an easy weeknight dinner. Often it's all prepared the night before a potluck and we just mix in the egg and bake before we go

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving (I actually used Turkey sausage instead of pork and just seasoned it more).

I didn’t add water chestnuts , because I’m not a fan. I couldn’t find that particular rice combo so found wild and brown. It came out perfect. Made it for Christmas and it seemed to be a hit. Will make again.

Used Lundburg wild rice blend.  I realize seasonings are personal preferences.  This recipe needed more zing but that's easily corrected with a Cajun spice or whatever is your preference.  Was a nice change from the normal dressing at Thanksgiving..

Very good. Made it twice in one week. Made regular stuffing to mix in it and never used it. This is too classy for regular stuffing or any other additions.

Very easy, very tasty dish. We skipped water chestnuts, and I added rosemary, but otherwise followed the recipe. Went beautifully with game hens.

This was just okay. If I make it again, I will cover the top with foil as the top layer was too crispy and I didn't enjoy the crunchy bits.

I needed a gluten free option, so I used one box of the instant long grain and wild rice using chicken stock rather than water, omitting the seasoning packet (which is where the gluten is hidden), and 4 ounces of wild rice. It look a bit longer, but well worth it. The ratio of wild rice to white rice gave the dressing more texture. The flavor was great, although I did add a bit more garlic powder than the recipe called for and also added onion powder, salt, and pepper. The sage ground pork definitely helps brings out great flavor too. The water chestnuts add a nice subtle texture too. Really good!

I made this for my very skeptic, traditional family for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  I was asked to make it again for Christmas.  I followed the very simple recipe exactly, but I added more wild rice.  I used sliced baby portobellos for the mushrooms, for a richer flavor.  And next time I will use 2 Jimmy Dean Sage sausage pkgs instead of one, as the flavor and aroma is what makes this dish so delish!

Pretty good but seems a bit under seasoned.  Actually better 2nd day.  Quite similar to dirty rice.  Water chestnuts are a nice crunchy addition.
