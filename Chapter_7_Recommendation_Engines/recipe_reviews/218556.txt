This was absolutely delicious. But it is fitting that basil is the first word in this recipe's name; you can really taste it. I will make again, however I plan on using artificial sweetener to lower the calories.

Delicious.. I made this with blueberries since I had them in the fridge and I used splenda for the sweetner.

This is AWESOME!!  I would have never guessed that basil would work in a smoothie and it takes great in this drink!!  I added a few more leaves to make it take better!  My strawberries were frozen-not the mango and I added some ice cubes.  Very good drink!!

This is a fabulous smoothie.  I love the addition of the basil which is clearly discernable in this drink.  I would not have thought basil would work in the drink but is absolutely does.  This recipe is really, really nice  â€“ very refreshing and delicious.

I loved it!!! Made just as written except I used Splenda rather than sugar.  Both my mangoes and strawberries were frozen so I did not add the ice cubes.  I loved the basil flavor and next time I will add a few more leaves.

We have an overabundance of basil, so I decided to try this.  Definitely interesting.  I used Truvia instead of sugar.  Came out pretty good, but not sure I like the combination of basil/mango.  Thanks anyhow :)

It's a great recipe, no need to add sugar as the mango I used was perfectly sweet as is.

This was amazing!  I had an overripe mango I had to use so I made this smoothie.  It is so refreshing! This is going to be a staple for me this summer. It was perfect as is, though I used less sugar.  You could easily add other fruit to this.  I think any tropical fruit would go nicely like banas, oranges, or pienapple.

I used the basil, mango, and water as written, then tasted. It was great like that. Then I added a banana instead of the strawberries. I didn't feel the need to add sugar or ice at all. It was pretty and delicious! Thanks for the recipe! :o)

Just a personal preference but I thought the basil tasted bad with the mango. I won't make this again.

This smoothie was quite delicious. I did make a change. I used original greek yogurt in replacement of the sugar it calls for. Next time I will replace the water for orange juice. The basil is really nice in there. I may even add extra mango in there too. Thanks!

With a few adjustments, this was a great smoothie. Definitely didn't need sugar, it was way sweet without it! Also used all frozen fruit so I didn't add ice. The basil was an interesting (and delicious!) addition. Will make again without sugar.
