As the submitter of this recipe I wanted to comment that although many people who have reviewed the recipe have chosen to bake the salmon with the salsa, the recipe does not intend for it to be prepared this way.  The salsa is meant to be served as a condiment to the baked salmon.  It should be refrigerated and allowed to sit out just a few minutes before serving.  Just wanted to clarify for those who are considering trying the dish.  Thanks!

Refreshing and delicious would be the best description for this dish. It is a perfect summer meal not only because it takes advantage of ingredients at their peak, but when it is hot and humid, the last place one wants to be is cooking over a hot stove. Just a few suggestions/minor changes: 1) DON’T cook the salsa with the fish. The coolness of the salsa makes a nice compliment to the warm fish.  2) Do make more of the salsa. It’s good.  3) I add a bit more broth than suggested. The first time I made this recipe, all the broth evaporated and the fish stuck to the bottom of the pan (I also prefer to use vegetable broth, but that is a taste preference.) 4) The lemon pepper isn’t enough; we add more seasonings to give the fish extra flavor. Oregano leaves are a must and – depending on my mood – cayenne pepper/red pepper flakes (for a little oomph) or cinnamon (for sweetness). I usually serve this recipe with mashed sweet potatoes (they add some substance to the meal, but still keep it semi-healthy), but asparagus, an avocado salad or Waldorf salad would all be good accompaniments.

Excellent. My husbands new favorite way to have salmon. I also added 3/4 cup quick rice and I cooked it with the salsa. I mixed it all up and put te salmon on the bottom.. it came out perfect.

This was GREAT! I happened to have shallots lying around, but I wouldn't hesitate to use a yellow or green onion in it's place.  I didn't have lime juice so I used half OJ and half lemon juice.  I added extra brown sugar, cilantro and 2 green onions for extra zing.  I will make this all the time. Thanks!

This was even better than I had expected and I didnt even have a couple of things on hand.  I followed the others reviews and baked the salsa on top of the salmon.  I left one piece without the salsa for a picky child, but the juice flavored that one nicely too.  The pineapple and tomato combo was nice and tangy.  I used a little purple onion because I didnt have shallots.  I also realized that I was out of chicken broth so I just poured the salsa all over the fish and baked until flaky.  I let it set a few minutes so the soy/juice thickened some.  Delicious!  My teenage daughter ate two pieces and went on and on about how great it was!

KUDO'S to the chef.
I agree.  keep it as intended or create your own recipe......hehe
very good and unique recipe..
a few minor alterations per taste. but someone decided to change the entire intent of recipe.....making it all different..
I like the original......
baked with the condiment sauce may be good, but is a different recipe and flavor all together...
Originality has its perks...and as a hobby chef, I applaud you.....

I made this last night and my husband and I both loved it. The salmon was very tender and flavorful.  The only change was that I baked the salmon with the salsa on top. This recipe in my keeper file, and will definately make it again.

I made the salsa with garlic instead of shallots.  The fresh basil really added a great touch!  I also seasoned the salmon with oregano, basil, pepper, and garlic salt instead to bring in the garlic from the salsa. Really yummy and healthy!

This was nice, and my bf enjoyed it, but it wasn't absolutely fab.  I served it on rice, and the main thing that wasn't right with the recipe was the salsa.  I did enjoy the flavour, but next time I'll leave out the lime juice, and I was wondering what it would taste like pureed and cooked with the salmon.  When I make this again I think I'll give that a try.

This was great! I really enjoyed it. I did a few mods for it. Instead of Pineapple i used Pomegranate and it turned out really good! I also mixed in some fresh Jalapeño with tomatoes made a huge difference. Substituted soy sauce for some spices and a little vinegar. The beauty of this dish is NOT cooking the salsa with the fish. Burst of fresh veggies and cooked fish is what makes this so flavorful. Serve with a glass of white wine. Thanks!

the salsa was yummy, although my husband wasn't into the pineapple (the lime juice seemed to neutralize it a little too much for him). i actually think the salmon cooking time was a bit too long. otherwise, great recipe! the only change i made was using tomatoes on the vine instead of plum tomatoes.

I grilled the salmon.  That was the major difference.  I loved the cold salsa with the warm fish.  Very refreshing.  I'd serve this to company.  That's always my way of deciding whether it was worth making again or trying something else.

I never knew salmon could taste like this! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I forgot to measure the chicken broth and ended up putting too much in perhaps as it was almost entirely engulfing the salmon, but it turned out so moist, it was absolutely delicious. I also substituted red onions instead of shallots. I agree with the chef that the salsa on the side refrigerated worked very well to contrast hot and cold. Will definitely recommend and make again!

Love this!  I prefer to chill the salsa as recommended by the creator of this recipe, but my boyfriend prefers it cooked with the salmon.  Either way, it's absolutely delicious and something I'll keep in the regular rotation.

Awesome! I switched it up a little and BBQ'd my salmon instead of baking it in the stock. I also added mango to the salsa, absolutely a delish meal on a summer evening.

The salsa was incredible!!  I would even make this salsa just to serve with tortilla chips.  Definitely keep the salsa cold and as an aside.  Everyone in our family ate it up!
I did use a white onion instead of a shallot, and it was fine.

This salsa recipe is so delicious- I've used it with mahi mahi and other white fish.  I have substituted green onion when I don't have shallots, and honey for the sugar.  For a nice kick, add chopped jalapeños to taste.

I was a tad bit hesitant about making this for dinner tonight since I was using fresh Alaskan Copper River Salmon and didn't want to risk "screwing up" a great piece of fish. :) However, I realized as long as I cooked the fish properly, I could leave off the salsa if we didn't like it. Mostly, I was unsure about the soy sauce, but decided I really liked it after it sat in the fridge for 20 min or so... especially since we usually add a drizzle of soy sauce to our plain rice anyways. Rather than heat the house or uncover the grill, I chose to cook on the stove. That said, I hope everyone knows to watch the cooking time... 30-40 min could be too long at 375' !! --To enjoy this even more, I eyeballed vs. measuring ingredients. :) Overall, we enjoyed the dish! Thanks Valerie!

I used Sockeye Salmon and my husband told me, "This one's a keeper!" Even my 6 year old daughter loved it! I made the salsa a few hours before cooking the salmon and let it sit in the fridge to infuse all the flavors. Fabulous dish!! Highly recommend!

Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using a full cup of broth rather than a half cup when baking the fish.  The best part of this dish was the combination of cool salsa on top of the warm fish.  Wonderfully refreshing summertime meal.  My husband was unsure about the tomato/pineapple flavor combination until he tasted it and declared it a winner.

Absolutely loved it.  The first time I made it, I followed other reviews and cooked everything with the fish.  BUT, the second time, I followed the recipe and served the salsa cold - it was absolutely AMAZING.  Perfect summertime dish!

We added this after getting a pineapple and ample tomatoes in our Bountiful Basket.  The salsa was fresh and flavorful.  I would have let it marinate for a while before serving if I had had time.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have shallots so I used chopped red & green onions.  I added chopped mangos, peaches, avocado, garlic & the last little splash of OJ.  

I served it to my parents who enjoyed it, especially since I used of their fresh garden tomatoes!  My kids (4, 9, 15) loved it too!

I liked this salsa recipe. I made the salmon my own way and served the salsa room temp on the side. I didn't make it up far enough ahead to put in the fridge. I had to substitute white onions for the scallions so I only used 1/2 the amount. I also about doubled the sugar-it was too tart for my taste. I used key lime juice as that's what I had in house. Maybe it's more tart?  I also added a splash of the pineapple juice from the can. I used fresh Romas and basil from my garden. I had more dressing than I needed. I had about 1/4 cup leftover.Picture is of my salsa only.

I loved this dish..although I felt the chicken broth made it just a little too salty it was still a wonderful new way to prepare salmon!!! I will repeat again but with a little less broth.

Wonderful!  I did not cook the salsa ontop as others did, and the dish was tasty and refreshing.  A nice twist for salmon.  Next time, I will use more lime juice and less olive oil for more of a kick.

Really tasty, but I found the salsa a little too liquid-y. We only made 2 servings worth of the recipe, and it may have thrown off our calculations. We also added extra pineapple and it was very yummy.

This dish was fantastic. My husband really enjoyed it. I only needed to bake my salmon for 10min. As well, I added 1/4 cup of cilantro in the salsa. I will definitely make this again.

I also chose to pour the salsa over the fillet and then bake and it came out nicely. Along with the tomatoes and pineapple, I tossed in some finely chopped red bell pepper. Yum!

Great combination with the salmon, tomato, pinapple and scallions.  Instead of lime juice (which I did not have) and olive oil I used Ken's Steak House Lemon & Pepper Marinade and I also had to use dry basil.... which worked out fine. The left over half cup of chicken soup I used for heating up tri-colored Couscous. Cooked the fish in the salsa sauce and mixed it it with couscous once cooked.  It was real nice.

Made this tonight for our daughter's anniversary dinner.  Unfortunately I was disappointed because there seemed to be too much juice.   I cooked the salsa with the salmon.   I do feel that it would be better with fresh haddock or halibut.   It certainly does not need the chicken broth.  Am going to play around with it because we all liked the flavor just not the texture of the fish.

I seasoned sockeye salmon with chiang mai fish and fowl from central market. I pan seared it (cast iron skillet) in olive oil 2 min. on first side, 1 min on 2nd side and stuck in 425 oven for 8 minutes. I combined in a bowl the salsa ingredients less lime juice and oil also subbing mirin for sugar, and used undrained canned tomato, undrained pineapple, and added a little of the chicken broth. After the salmon came out threw the salsa ingredients in a blotted dry pan and had a sauce in seconds. (It will sizzle because the pan is so hot.) Served over jasmine rice. This tasted like a restaurant quality dish.

Absolute winner! Easy to prepare and does not take a lot of time to make at all. I had to substitute the lime juice with lemon juice (just didn't have any lime juice in the pantry!), and also used tomatoes-on-the-vine instead of Roma tomatoes. Another change: My basil plant didn't yield 2 tablespoons anymore so I added crumbled dried basil leaves - worked very well. I loved the tart, refreshing result and served the salsa with rice. Thanks! will definitely make again!

I like others baked the salmon with the salsa on it. I didn't have shallots so used yellow onions. I also added some Mrs. Dash spicy blend to the fish along with the lemon pepper. Turned out very good, will make again.

Made the salsa for mahimahi. It's a great side bkz you can make ahead of time. Only had dried basil, so under a tablespoon will do. Used more pineapple than listed.

I made this last night and thought it was delicious. I wasn't really sure about the chicken broth, so I poured the juice from the canned pineapple over the salmon. The salsa was awesome! Next time though I'll put some peppers in it for a little heat. Thanks!

I've made this twice as hubby & I like the taste of the salmon - it's different & refreshing. I followed the recipe exactly but I grilled the fish on griddle pan until cooked, then poured the broth on top of fish - letting it bubbling away on pan for about 2 mins and the fish to absorb some broth without getting too soggy (we don't like soggy fish). Served with cool salsa... two thumbs up! Thanks :)

Excellent job, Valerie, 5 stars!  I'd give it more if I could!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone reallly should heed the recipe and save the chilled salsa to serve over the hot fish, the warm/cool contrast lends a nice, refreshing kick.  Don't skimp on fresh basil either, it's so worth it!  I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I served it to my boyfriend and uncle. We all fought for more salsa because it accented the salmon perfectly.

I understand that this recipie is not made to be baked but baking the salsa with the fish adds an additional tang. I live with a man who hates fish but eats it for its dietary needs and now he loves salmon. I can't make enough of it. I also use cherry tomatos because i live in asia and their found everywheres. Their great and add a little more lightness to the dish (less seeds and juice)

Awesome recipe! I only changed a few things because it was what I had and I think it STILL turned out perfect. I used canned diced tomatoes with green chiles and crushed pineapple. I used the juice in the pineapple to add to the chicken broth to bake it in. I will use that salsa recipe for other things too. Thanks a bunch! :-)

Very, very good.  The only thing I changed was to use dry basil instead of fresh...  (Didn't want to spend extra money).  However, I'm sure is worth it!  Will make it again!

I love salmon in the first place, so I'm always looking for something new.  I made a few, small changes...primarily for convenience and cost, not taste.  I substituted a small, white onion for the shallots (pound-for-pound, shallots are way more expensive than onions).  I also 'cheated' and used dried basil instead of fresh.  Over all, a great recipe.  I've already had it twice.

My husband loved this dish! The salsa was a great addition to the salmon. The only thing I changed was to use crushed pineapple instead of the chunks, and I even made the salsa for grilled shrimp!
