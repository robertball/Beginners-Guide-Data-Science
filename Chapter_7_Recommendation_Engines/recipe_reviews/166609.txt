I am giving this recipe five stars based on my revisions.  I would probably give two stars to the original recipe.  The reason being - the amount of topping is ridiculous – basically two full cups for a little 9” square coffee cake.  I made the cake portion as written, subbing buttermilk for the milk, because I had some to use up.  For the topping I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar (not white), 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 t. cinnamon, 3 T. butter and the full 1/2 cup of coconut.  I didn’t have toasted coconut but regular worked just fine.  I also used a 9” springform pan which worked well.  My result was delicious and I would make this again.  Next time I may up the coconut a little more to 3/4 cup just to compare.  Give this a try, but adjust the amount of topping and you will be very pleased.

I doubled the recipe and baked it for about 50-60 minutes. The Toasted coconut top was very delicious! I used eath balance margarine in place of the shortning and butter. i would make this again.

YUM...DELICIOUS! I didn't have shortening, so I used softened butter. Also, I used brown sugar and regular coconut in the topping, and a round pan instead of a square. This smelled wonderful while baking and tasted even better...and so simple to make too! A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is one of the best recipes I have come across! I personally added 3 cups of blueberries instead of 2 cups, and balance it out with 1/3 cup of EXTRA flour. It was wonderful and I won several baking contests with it!

I love toasted coconut, so I decided to try this recipe. I followed the recipe as written with no changes.  The blueberry cake was moist and tasty.  However, I was surprised that I didn’t care for the flavor combination of blueberry and coconut.  I would definitely make this recipe again, but will probably omit the coconut from the crumb topping. Thank you for the recipe!

4 stars from me but 5 stars from the Mr. He loved the coconut crumble topping. I added lemon zest to the batter, which was a good call. Baked it in a cast iron skillet. I also made a glaze with fresh squeezed lemon juice and powdered sugar to drizzle over the top after baking.

This was delicious!! I only changed a couple of things: I added brown sugar instead of white sugar and made it in a round pan. I loved it and wish it was diet friendly ;)

This was delicious! Instead of adding cinnamon I added lemon zest and a little lemon juice and I also reduced the sugar a little. My family loved this recipe and I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I thought the toasted coconut topping was a very good, however just a little too much in quantity  and a little too sweet; but overall a very nice coffee cake.
