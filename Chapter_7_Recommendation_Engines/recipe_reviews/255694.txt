While I'm not opposed to chicken, beans worked good in this too. A little greasy with the wing sauce and cheese but overall a good recipe!

I made some changes (ranch instead of blue cheese dressing) and a few more. I’m going to try and use this as a jumping off point to try a few more healthy swaps too. Very good- so glad I found this!

I was looking for an alternative to chicken wing dip for my vegetarian family members and I like this a lot.  I can’t get ranch dressing where I live so I use Caesar and I reduce by a 1:4 so it isn’t overpowering.  The dip is tasty and really satisfies a buffalo craving. I’ve used with various white beans and I find great white beans are the best.
