Quickness is a bit difficult with a breadmachine bread, so I stated that in the middle.
We loved the bread, also our kids liked it very much it is sure we will be eating this again soon!

This bread was not at all what I was expecting (I thought that it would be a herb bread with a tomato-y flavor)! There is something wrong with the liquid amount in this recipe, and also there needs to be some type of sweetner to activate the yeast (as another reviewer noted). Sorry to be so negative, but I have to warn people this recipe is not worth the effort to make it.

I think there must be a mistake with the ingredients in this recipe. I've made close to 50 different types of breads in my bread machine and I have never had one turn out so horrible as this one. I put it at the light crust setting and it came out burnt and had a terrible burnt sour tomato smell as it was baking. It didn't rise at all (I measured and it was only 3.5 inches high). As I made it I wondered how it was going to rise without any sugar. I took only one bite and had to throw out the rest and the horrible taste wouldn't go away until I ate something sweet.
