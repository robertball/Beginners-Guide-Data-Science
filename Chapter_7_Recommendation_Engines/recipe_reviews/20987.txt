This is a great starter recipe. I put a little garlic in with the onions, then add diced raw potato, leaving some chunks larger than others. Then put the potato in the sauce pan with the onion, salt and pepper them and let it fry a little so the potatoes get a nice flavor going. Then I add chicken broth and bring to a boil til the potatoes soften.Lastly the milk or cream whichever I have on hand. I always add bacon crumbles and garnish with shredded cheddar and a glop of sour cream. The only reason I don't give this recipe 5 stars is I think it needs another seasoning but I haven't quite figured out what yet. My picky husband asks me to make this all the time, though.

The first time I made this for my family, my grandmother told me that I could "make potato soup" for her anytime.

Coming from a 40-year experienced (and might I add excellent) cook, that is really saying something! :-)

Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe and very simple.  I actually used Potato Buds to make the mashed potatoes since I was short on time, and it came out fine.  Will definitely keep handy and make again.

This was so good, we added a pound of bacon and omited the butter to fry the onions and just fried them in the bacon grease before discarding the grease.  My husband decided this was the best soup he has ever had.

very good base soup. It had a really good flavor just kinda bland for me. I added butter onions and minced garlic in a pan and then put potatoes in. i didnt use mashed. when they got soft i mashed them in the same pan. I also added Italian seasoning,sour cream, bacon, and mild cheddar cheese. YUMMMMYYY!!! best ever

The only reason this soup would come out bland is if your mashed potatoes were bland in the first place. This soup was delicious! But when I make my mashed potatoes I use milk, butter, sour cream, garlic salt, and pepper. So they have a lot of flavor in the first place. A good way to add more flavor to the soup is to melt some cheese in it as well. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great "base" for Potato Soup! I added a tsp. of minced garlic to the onion and since I didn't have mashed potatoes I added cubed Red Potatoes that I already had boiled for 8 minutes, I added them to the onion & garlic mixture with a half cup of chicken broth and let them cook for 10 minutes. This allowed me to mash some of the potatoes in the pot which made my soup thicker. I used the amounts listed for the broth and milk and my soup wasn't runny/thin it was perfect consistancy. I also added 2/3 cup of chopped cooked ham, 1 tsp. of sea salt, 1/2 tsp of Basil, 1/2 tsp of Pepper and 1 tsp of Parsley. I topped each bowl with a spoonful of Kraft 2% shredded Mexican cheese blend - turned out to be a really good soup! I will definately make this again.

Very easy and very tasty! Perfect comfort food. I added a bit more milk and let it simmer a while to really let the flavours blend.

I made the soup as is, except I did add some baked potato cubes as well. This is a good basic potato soup recipe. Nothing super spectacular - but, not unpleasant either. I would make it again, because it is tasty and very easy to make.

This recipe was good, & I will probably make it again because it was so easy & yummy.  However, I may have made it wrong, as I didn't expect it to be like a thick "mashed potato soup."  Adding a bit more chicken broth & milk didn't help me to get the consistancy I was looking for - a more creamy effect.

mashed up half the potatos, and cubed the rest for more texture.  Also added 1/2 pack of bacon, about 1/2 cup of sour cream, and 1 cup of cheddar...BIG hit for our family of 5!

added a cup of grated carrots, quarter cup of cream instead of milk, and added seasonings depending what I feel like.   If you feel like a really rich soup you could add ham bits but for me this soup was rich enough.

I agree with another reviewer...this is a wonderful base recipe to begin with.  Everyone has their own taste preferences and tweaking recipes is common to most of us.  Will definitely make this recipe again because it was quick and easy.  I had boxes of scalloped potatoes in the cupboard that needed to be used or thrown out.  I threw out the seasoning, but used the dried potato slices by breaking them up into small pieces, then adding water to reconstitute.  Used instant mashed potatoes to fill in the rest.  If it was this good with these old ingredients to start with, I can only imagine what fresh ingredients will do for the taste.

I made this for my daughter, while she was recovering from having her wisdom teeth pulled. It is so yummy we all wanted to eat it. I carmelized my onions and then deglazed my pot with the broth and milk and then added the potatoes. Really really good!! and easy!!

My husband is going through detox and he needs things soft and easy on his stomach.  He loved it.  He said the taste was great and it really helped with settling his stomach.  Will definitely make this one again.

Such a great idea!  I had left my skins on my mashed potatoes and I like mine a little chunky so it gave the soup nice texture.  Thanks for the idea and yummy soup!

This recipe was simple but wonderful.  My husband loves potatoes and when I modified it as per other reviews with adding 1T minced garlic, and 1/4 c. half/half instead of the milk, he thought that it was great.  Thanks for sharing!

I needed something fast with what was in the fridge before vacation! I fried my onion in bacon drippings, made chicken broth from bouillon, added the leftover mashed potatoes, & the last 1/2 cup of half-n-half. Heated it up & add the last of the cheddar cheese in the bag(3/4cup). Done in 10 minutes & used up lots of leftovers. Soup gone in one meal for 4 people :)

I am so happy to have found this recipe. When I make potato skins, I can make this recipe with the leftover potato. Like previous reviewers said, this is a great base recipe. I made it for the first time last night. The flavor was nice. I wanted a smooth texture so I put the soup in the blender, then put it back in the pot. I liked it as is, but I will definitely experiment to see how I can jazz up the flavor.

This was a super easy recipe with only a few steps and ingredients, but tastie, all the same. It was a bit too oniony, but I didn't use chicken bouillon or milk because I didnt have any :-)). I imagine they would have balanced the flavor. I may add a bit of my homemade rice milk to calm the onion flavor, but I don't eat chicken, so I'm not sure what to do about that. I will remember this basic recipe and use it again, but I'll probably add less onion. Also, I blended it in the VitaMix to make it super creamy and hide the chunks of onions from my kids. :-))

An excellent tasty soup.  I added chopped celery, carrots and green onion (the only onion I had on hand).  I used 1/2 cup of ff cream as well as skim milk and the chicken stock.  I love the recipe; it's a great way to use up left over potatoes.  yum!  EW

This was great. I did add some garlic salt, because I did think it was a bit bland. Also as suggested I topped with cheese and bacon bits.

This is a yummy soup. I was told next time by my husband to make more. My kids were upset that there was no seconds that night. I used cubed potatoes and boiled them in the broth was the only change i made.

Very good soup! I didn't have any leftover potatoes and used the instant instead. Followed the recipe pretty close, did put in some carrots for a little color and about a half pound of bacon that I crisped up in the microwave using a "BaconWave" Love it! Sprinkled a little cheddar on top of the soup in the bowl. I'll be sad when the leftovers are gone.

Extremely bland on it's own.  This recipe requires quite a bit of doctoring to resemble anything close to an appetizing soup.  I wish people would rate things based on the actual recipe not based on their additions to the recipe it would save people a lot of time and hassle of making a bad recipe.

This is a really good, easy soup.  I did add some ham that I needed to use up, but it did have to have it.  It's a great way to use up left over mashed potatoes and I definitely would make this again.

This was very good.  Comfort food if I've ever seen it.  I left it thick.  I think next time I will thin it out a bit and leave more potato chunks as well as add carrots and celery.  My daughter loved this and she is a hard one to please.  I too added garlic when sauteeing the onions and it was the perfect touch.

I always have creative ideas for food but I don't know the basics of cooking. This recipe gave me a great start and I added a load of other ingredients to it to make a spicy, curried soup with shallots, garlic, carrots, curry, cayenne, paprika and lots of other ingredients! 

Thank you for posting it!

I had made twice baked potatos for a potluck and had a couple left over.  I used the filling from the twice baked potatos instead of plain mashed potatos.  It turned out great!

This soup is very, very bland initially as other reviewers mentioned. I wish that there were more large potato chunks. I added three cloves of garlic, a bunch of black pepper and paprika, a little cayenne, parsley, and some parmesan cheese. This is a fun recipe if you like playing around with ingredients. My family loved it. Makes a great appetizer or lunch!

First time ever making potato soup and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone ages 5-36 loved it. Only thing I did different was left out the onion (none of us are huge fans of them..), and cut up 5 potatoes and boiled them until softened before adding the mashed potatoes so it would go farther and be more filling. Was nice having such a light yet filling meal combined. Will be making this over and over! Thanks for sharing this one!

Great base, but I gave it four stars because I made a few changes. 1. Instead of mashed potatoes, I just cut up 5 - 6 potatoes in chunks. 2. I added some diced garlic (canned). 3. I added 5 or 6 slices of cooked beef bacon, diced small. 1. I added a few more seasoning. However, the base was really what I needed. I cooked this in a slow cooker on high for 3 hours. Then I took a potato masher and went over it a couple times (leaving most of the potatoes in chunks, but mashing a lot to give it a textured consistency). I then cooked it on low for another 2 hours. The results were amazing and I will definitely be making this recipe a lot this winter!

I thought this soup was great. Ive made i a couple times now and added a few things of my own.  Bacon, italian sausage and green onions were some things i added. The bacon was pan fried and the sausage was rolled into small meatballs and cooked in a small pot with the chicken broth.

So simple, so easy, so good!!  My mother is a gormet cook and she has always had a problem making the right potato soup.  I, who cannot cook at all in her eyes, made this for lunch during a visit and she said it was the best potato soup she had ever had.  My change was a lot of pepper for a kick, and I added ham.

I've made it 2x. This is a great basic, comfort Potato Soup. Sometimes that's what you want out of a Potato Soup. Not a fusion of flavors - plain can be good! If you want loaded baked potato flavors try the Baked Potato Soup recipe (*****). We really liked this basic recipe. It was nice to use left over mashed potatoes this way. We intended to make the soup with left overs and have it for work lunches. It was so good we had it for dinner.

I do love that this recipe doesn't have flour, which can really steal a soup's flavor. As has been said, this soup is only bland if your mashed potatoes are bland. 
Doubling the recipe, I made my potatoes with generous garlic, 3 cups shredded cheddar cheese, a tub of cottage cheese, 18 strips of bacon, 7 cups of corn, and 3 onions sauteed in leftover bacon fat. (Cooking the onions in bacon fat really gave the whole soup an AMAZING bacon flavor. It was devoured.)
I also HALVED the amount of chicken broth in the soup, and compensated with some milk. 
I do imagine the recipe as-is would be bland, hence 3 stars. But it's a great base to work from if improv is your thing!

Made a few minor changes to the original recipe.  Since I wanted crumbled bacon as a topper, I omitted butter and used the bacon grease to saute the onion and added a few garlic cloves to it.
I also cooked about 4 small potatoes and diced them to add a bit of texture, added celery seed and a dash of smoked paprika.  The mashed potatoes were well seasoned and had sour cream in them.   Turned out wonderful!  If you are looking for a quick and easy potato soup, give this one a try.

Even though it was 80 degrees today, I made this soup pretty much as written and found it YUMMY!  I probably used more onions than recipe but was a little nervous at the others' mention of 'bland'.  I didn't put sour cream, bacon, cheese or any other additives so I could rate fairly and I LIKED it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Considering this soup starts with mashed potatoes, I think it's great for what it is. While I don't think anyone would confuse this for restaurant-style baked potato soup, it works beautifully in a pinch. First snow of the winter and my two oldest kids (8 & 7) wanted potato soup...this recipe fit the bill! I used veggie broth since I'm a vegetarian, and eyeballed the broth/milk amounts. I added freshly ground pepper and a ton of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Next time I will dice the onions instead of chop, but that's only for my kids' sake. I could see how bacon, sour cream, green onions, etc., would be great additions. Personally, I think one of the best aspects of this recipe is its flexibility. You can adapt it to your personal tastes or those of your family. A definite keeper! Will make this again for sure! :)

Loved it!  Added some cheese and extra seasoning (garlic, salt and pepper).  Also did what some suggested as to adding some cubes of potatoe.  Family loved it - even my husband who is NOT a soup person.  Next time I will add some crumbled bacon.

We changed this a little but used this as a good base.  Had about 3.5 C of mashed potatoes left over which went in later. Chopped 2 whole baking potatoes (small like diced).  Sauteed onion in 2 Tbls butter, added garlic after onion softened, then added chopped potatoes.  Let brown/soften in the butter for a few minutes then added about 2 C chicken broth.  Let simmer for about 10 minutes then added the mashed potatoes and probably a cup of skim milk.  Just added a little broth as needed for texture.  Cheese on top with Bacos and whole grain bread - Yum!  This was a good find.

I good basic recipe. A little heavy on the onions for me, next time I think I will chop them finer or simple have the amount I used. The back bone of it is the mashed potatoes. You HAVE to have good mashed potatoes or it wont work well. 
I think I'll try bacon and bacon grease in it next time, or maybe ham or. this seems like a great recipe to put in little extras.

Delicious as it was, it was missing something. Adding some sort of meat, like bits of bacon or ham makes this already good meal even better.

I am from New Mexico, and the missing spice is HATCH GREEN CHILIES!  Just a small can , (about 2 oz.) makes all the flavors in this potato soup come alive!!!  Other than that, it is nearly the perfect potato soup!  I have to add, that I also fry the bigger chunks of potato with the butter & onion, and I also add roasted garlic, crumbled bacon, a tablespoon of creamy horseradish, and some shredded cheese to top it off.  That, just in my Southwestern opinion, is something that DOES make this a 5 star recipe!

I used this recipe for inspiration, but I modified it. I sauteed 2 tbsp butter, 1 diced onion, and 3 minced cloves of garlic. I then added 2 tbsp flour and coated the aromatics, stirring while sauteeing. I added a carton of chicken stock and a bay leaf and brought it to a boil. Then, I added the mashed potatoes (I only had about 3 cups). I brought that to a boil, then blended with an immersion blender. I added a half cup of heavy cream, pepper, and salt, to taste. As I made it with my improvisations, I thought it was very tasty. I will be making this again.

My granddaughter is very sick and has alot of canker sores in her mouth. I made this for her with diced potatoes, zapped them when tender with the hand blender until very smooth and creamy. Very tasty! I enjoyed licking the pot!

It is an excellent soup base. I did add ground sausage,  bacon , corn and chives.  I'm not one for potato soup but my wife likes it so I tried to make it more towards loaded potatoes. New family favorite.

Substituted chicken broth with beef broth, and it tasted just as delicious! I think my recipe needed something with crunch in it though, so next time I’ll probably incorporate bacon or something similar.

Very good as a base. I added diced potato's. to give it the real potato soup look and feel. I also added some of my favorite spices as we all have different taste's The mashed potato's made it nice and thick which my entire family loved. I will defiantly make again.

So simple, tasty & quick. I added turmeric, dried mustard, a dash of Worcestershire and corn.
Thought that I would have left overs to freeze.

Super easy base for potato soup. I used bacon cheddar instant mashed potatoes and homemade chicken broth, so the soup was flavored nicely. I also added bacon bits and chives on top. Very easy dinner served with bread and fruit.

I made this soup tonight and it's good although next time I'll cut down on the broth so the soup is thicker (personal preference) since there is not much seasoning I'd suggest making sure your mashed potatoes are well seasoned...I cooked the onion with my potatoes and added minced garlic..to my mashed potatoes I add butter, garlic salt and cream cheese which makes for a very tasty soup I'll definitely make this again

We loved this soup.  I chopped broccoli and threw it in to get some greens in us.  I put toppings like cheese and bacon on the side so each person could make it exactly as she wanted.  Perfect for this cold fall weather.  I would suggest that you double it it you want left overs for lunches or another meal.

I seasoned and buttered the mashed potatoes before I used them for the soup. I added minced garlic and garlic powder. I didn't have chicken broth on me so I used the potato water from the mashed potatoes and seasoned it.

I made this and it was very good. My boyfriend liked it, and that says a lot. I used everyone's suggestions, started with ready made mashed potatoes, added 1 regular can of chicken broth, chopped 1 large onion and cooked it with 1 tbsp garlic in butter, added 6 cubed potatoes that were boiled 8 min. I also added cubed ham. I mixed it together then added half and half and 1/2 tsp dried basil,1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp dried parsley. I simmered it a few min. And served it up with shredded cheese and sour cream. Easy to make, and so very good.

I used this as a base recipe to use up some potatoes that were leftover after Corned Beef and Cabbage,  tonight. I put some boiled potatoes in the mixer to slightly mash them, but left a lot of small chunks. After the onion was tender, I added about 1 tsp minced garlic to it. I followed the rest of the recipe, as is. After it was hot, I simmered it to thicken a bit more. Toward the end, I added some leftover cooked ham, dill, pepper, and parsley. Served with some shredded cheese, a dollop of  sour cream, and paprika at the table. Turned out pretty good!

Great for leftover mashed potatoes. I had a bag of coleslaw and sautéed with onions and garlic then added potatoes. I also topped it with sour cream!

I thought this recipe was just okay. I liked how simple it was to make,  but I felt it was a little lacklustre and missing something. I think it could have benefited from additional ingredients, although I am not sure what I would recommend. My boyfriend really liked it though.

I added about a pound of bacon . Then used some of the grease in place of the butter since the potatoes had butter in them already. I added a diced red bell pepper and 2 cloves minced garlic to the onions. Then cut the broth down 1/3 cup and stirred sour cream in at the end. I also added some grated sharp cheddar.

I started with delicious mashed potatoes that were very flavorful and added  turkey stock that we made overnight with the leftover turkey bones.  Didn't add salt or pepper for this reason.   Really enjoyed this fast easy recipe especially since we were so tired from all the festivities.   For our toppings, we used leftover ham, green onions, and cheese.  Deelish!

I had no choice but to make some alterations. I went with ham broth(which I boiled the potatoes in) I didn't have much butter nor any milk at all, but I did have half a can of cream of chicken...so I mixed that with my mashed potatoes. Along with half a stick of butter. 
I then cut up a bunch of ham with the onions and it turned out delicious

I used premade chive and onion mashed potatoes, so it was well seasoned.  I sauteed onions in olive oil, then added garlic for a few seconds, as well as smoked paprika, freshly ground black pepper, dried basil and dill, and tumeric (just to be healthy).  then topped it up with chicken stock and the mashed taters.  It probably already had cream/milk in it, so I skipped cream and cheese, and it was so YUM.

Very easy to make. For me, definitely too much onion. I added chives, bacon bits, minced garlic, mozzarella cheese, and parsley. I had a couple cans of whole potatoes, that I heated and mashed a little. It wasn't 6 cups, so I made "fake" potatoes to complete 6 cups. Very good!

Very good recipe - I have never used carrots or onions and that is a nice addition. This was much healthier than my normal recipe. I did add some chopped ham to my recipe and used chopped potatoes instead of mashed potatoes. I like my potato soup chunky - it  seems more filling. Thanks for the recipe, we are snowed in and needed a recipe with my on hand ingredients and also a way to use up my potatoes before they go bad. Thanks from Kentucky!

I loved this simple recipe. Reading the comments always gives me ideas. I started w the onions and the butter....added a couple of chicken bouillon cubes and quartered small red potatoes(what I had on hand)..squished a garlic clove and dropped that in..some salt and pepper...zapped some bacon....added that ....and just let it simmer...mmmmmmm

Just made this. SUPER starter recipe. I added some basil, dill, and chives from our herb garden. Plus, just a tiny dash of cumin and simmered it with a bay leaf. Also added a healthy amount of minced garlic to cook a long with the onion. I love basic recipes that let me play!

It was great, and a super quick recipe to make. I added bacon as well. The only thing I would change is not adding as much onion, but that is just to my preference. Instead of a whole onion, add only 3/4 of the onion or even half. I also recommend not using 6 cups of potatoes, I only used about 4 and a half. I also only added 1/4 cups of milk.

I needed to use up some frozen mashed potatoes that went watery when thawed and this was a great way to use them up. I did use 1/4 cup of butter and 2%milk with sour cream. Adding a couple diced carrots and a very small pinch of cumin. Would use this basic for a base for sure and add my own twist to it. Thanks for sharing

Good base but had to "doctor it up" quite a bit.  Using other reviews I added Old Bay, dill, basil, chili powder, and some cooking sherry along with salt and pepper.

I thought it was ok, it needed some help...i added garlic with the onions... less chicken broth, more milk to make a creamier texture , salt & pepper to taste & a dash of oregano made it taste pretty good.

Very basic potato soup.  Too bland. But if you add chopped green onions right before you serve it tastes a lot better.

I altered this a recipe a little bit! Instead of using mashed potatoes, I used diced cooked potatoes.  I also cooked the soup in the croc pot on high for 3 to 4 hours. For flavor I added dried basil, crushed red pepper, and a little garlic.  If are you are going to used diced potatoes, after you cook the potato for a little bit, make sure you dice them into small pieces.  That is one that I would change about what I did.  Besides that, this homemade soup is excellent!

This was really good. Made it for a "sick" husband and he asked me to leave the onions out. He liked it. I had to thicken it up a little for him because he wanted me to use chunks instead of mashed potatoes. I will make this again!

This is a great simple recipe.
A few things I did differently,
were, I used diced potatos, 
and half and half, great soup
for the winter time.

I make my own soup stock, and needed a basic recipe using leftover mashed potatoes. Adding diced potatoes and chicken and cream instead of milk makes a great soup.

This is a great base soup. I added ham with the onions, then drained the excess water, added the potato's to the pot and stired. What really made this dish for my family was, the crushed funions, chives, shredded colby jack cheese and sour cream topping. Optional bacon bits as well. It was a nice hit durint the cold weather.

Tried it as written and turned out great.  I made my mashed potatoes as I normally do (leaving the skins on, the same seasonings and a bit lumpy) and the consistency came out perfect.

My family loves this recipe and it is so easy.  When we are in the mood for a bit of spice, I add green chilis, yum.

Very yummy. I used potato flakes to make the mashed potatoes which was very inexpensive. I substituted veggie broth since I'm vegetarian and also added some cubed potatoes. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Holy  this was good!!!  I added a couple sliced up slices of sandwich meat ham.  Awesome soup, SUPER easy and SUPER quick to make!  Also, I was lazy and just used leftover mashed potatoes that I made from real potato flakes instead of cooking whole potatoes!  Really good soup!  Filled my tummy!

Makes a lovely thick soup which can be thinned down,  a little bland but a perfect opportunity to add your favourite seasonings.
