I had to make some changes because I didn't have lemongrass or chile peppers...added lemon zest and juice of a half of lemon, sprinkled with crushed red pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. What an interesting soup! I also added a can of straw mushrooms and 1 thinly sliced carrot. Next time I am going to add coconut milk instead of sour cream to give it more of a thai taste. Adjust the amount of vinegar and heat to your liking. I will make this again!

This was one of few recipies which I could not imagine how the dish would come out until I actually make it...this is a very good sour-spicy soup. Even though I made it only with cucumbers following the recipe, I think I can add other vegetables, like mushrooms and carrots. I will make this again!

This was great, but I did change the recipe so this review might not be too helpful.  I had some spicy homemade vegetable stock on hand, so I used that and left out the chile peppers.  I also used tangerine zest instead of lemon grass because that is so hard to find.  I recommend this recipe :)

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again. Great for using up those summer cucumbers! Very easy and fast prep if you're good with a knife.

Excellent cold soup the next day. Wasn't too impressed with it just cooked, the next day cold it's wonderful! To make it a hardier soup I add mushroom and carrot like the other reviewer suggested. I also thought it was not hot enough. I wouldn't de-seed as suggest , but leave the seeds in and add even more chiles.

Fantastic!  I wouldn't have dreamed of a hot cucumber soup, but with the fish sauce taste it works for me.  I used 4 cucumbers and seeded them, and two serrano peppers rather than 3 (seeded).  I skipped the lemongrass as none was on hand.  I used a little extra chicken stock and no water, and used an immersion blender right before adding the sour cream to give it a nice texture - but stopped when there was still some cucumber chunks.  Will definitely make this again!

I did 5 c chicken broth and 1 can coconut milk instead of 4 c broth, 2 c water, and 1/2 c sour cream.  I also forgot the butter.  Other than that, I made as written and was surprised at how well it turned out.

This just wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be.  The taste was very unusual.

i was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe.. didn't feel it needed the sour cream.. wish i would have had the fresh chile peppers.. tried to use dried.. but it didn't work.. yet the soup was still very tasty.. used all cilantro no parsley.. the extra cup of water wasn't necessary for me.. i did blend it and it came out like a nice thick broth.. perfect for sipping.. ty for the recipe~~~~UPDATE: came out super tasty with the fresh peppers as expected.. this time i used a combination of zucchini and cucumber.. i cut this recipe in half and used 2 serrano peppers w/o removing the seeds/vein.. used all parsley this time.. used white onion instead of green and fresh ginger.. absolutely loved this and it still didn't need the extra water or sour cream.. ty again for this recipe

Initially made it as written, and it was ok. Actually that's not true, the only change I made was to use lemon juice instead of lemon grass (not the same I know, but I live 25 miles from the nearest Asian market, and I had all the other ingredients.) However, after playing around with the ingredients, this ended up being easily one of the best soups I have ever made. I think the biggest improvement was adding a can of coconut cream -definitely recommend that! I also did my usual thing of using my immersion stick blender on half of the soup. Really awesome! Thanks, Dayna!

I made this with one substitution by using coconut milk in place of sour cream. Splendid!

I made it 'as is' and it is a great way to use up big cucumbers from the garden. Next time I will add some chicken after it is smoothed.

I made this recipe to accompany a Thai salad and to use up some cucumbers. It is an interesting flavor combo; we thought it was improved by cooling the soup slightly rather than eating it piping hot. I garnished with Stacy's brand thin veggie sticks (sold near salad toppings at your supermarket). Next time I may try adding carrots as others suggested, and possibly Thai rice noodles.

What a great result! Followed advice of using coconut milk but stuck to the recipe aside from that.  Was really questioning how this would turn out and was very pleasantly surprised!  Thx for posting!
