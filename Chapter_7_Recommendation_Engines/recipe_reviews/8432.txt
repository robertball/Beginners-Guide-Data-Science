I made this cake for a wheat-free friends birthday.  The cake went down well with everyone.  I halved the recipe and made one small round cake.  I added vanilla to the recipe and iced it with a frosting made with more orange zest, the squeezed orange juice and powdered sugar - I definately recommend doing that for a zesty citrus flavour.  I would make sure you allow the rice to cool properly before you add it to the creamed butter and sugar.  It tastes a little like a rice pudding rather than a real cake since there are still whole grains of rice.  So the texture is different but it has a delicious flavour and I will definately make this again.  I may also try doing this with  apple & cinnamon instead of orange.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My favourite recipe of all time! Very similar to something I tried in Bologna, Italy around Easter.  I leave out the raisins, add a tsp of real vanilla to the rice while cooking, and use lemon zest instead of orange. I bake it in my fancy bundt pan although the cake I had in Italy was in a flat rectangular pan. I serve it with Lemon Butter from this site.   Thank you Lois!

this recipe is VERY GOOD â€” although i must admit i flavoured it with vanilla instead of orange zest, and i did not put raisins in it (personal distaste). / 

going back a few years i had searched for a recipe to make a rice cake (sometimes called a rice pie) and was not very successful until i searched the web and found this recipe. it has since become one of my very favourite and i get a ton of compliments each time i make it. / 

my only recommendation, make sure you use SHORT GRAIN rice (long grain does not stick together well) and if your eggs are small, consider adding an extra one (eggs are also a binding agent). / 

lastly, those cakes often come in a pie shell, but i prefer making a graham base (like that of cheese cakes). it adds a little sweetness but is much easier to make than dough (which i hate making). / 

enjoy! and never be scared to personalize like i did!

The rice took a whole lot longer than 15mins to absorb the milk but this is quite tasty, though very moist inside.  I increased the orange zest to 3tbsp - delicious orange flavour.  Nice crisp crust.  I might play around with this recipe - for instance, use less milk, maybe one or two eggs less, and add some flour and baking powder, to make it less pudding-like in the centre.  However, having said that, it turned out of the baking pan very well, held its shape nicely.  It tastes great but I don't think it's something I'd serve to company - I'd feel like I had to explain that "yes, it is cooked properly, try it, you'll like it".

I had no white rice so I used brown rice. If you try this the brown rice takes way longer to soak up the milk and the bottom of my pan had blackened because of it. But lucky me, the rice was ok. I think I cooked it to long because there were a lot grains that were hard. They were not heard when i tested it before it was mixed in. I think it was the length I cooked it. I kept checking it and it just seemed to moist. Kept thinking a cake center was going to appear. I was wrong. Finally took it out. Even with the hard bits of rice it was so yummy and the brown rice did not even tast like brown rice. I will so make 
this again
