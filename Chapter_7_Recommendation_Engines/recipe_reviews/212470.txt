I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  It wasn't until they were baking, that I realized I had forgotten the oil!  It made no difference, they taste great!  They are a moist, flavorful muffin.  I put the frosting on some, left it off on others; I prefer these without the frosting!  Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy!  I made a rum glaze instead of the one included: 2 tablespoons melted butter, and 2 tablespoons rum- mix together, then add 1/2 of confectioners sugar.  Stir into other 2 ingredients till well blended.  I will make these again!

This was easy to make and very moist. I did not feel the glazing was needed. I froze those that I did not glaze. I believe it was sweet enough and moist enough to do without anything on top. I will take some to my sister-in-law for christmas

Fantastic! The recipe actually made me 24 muffins!  Very fruity, not overpowering at all as you might think with mincemeat. I did not bother with the glaze as they are mainly for breakfast.

Great recipe, the grocery store i go to had some jars of mincemeat on clearance when they had overstock after the holidays, i made sure i bought what i could cause the prepared filling can get expensive, but it has a long shelf life. i made these into mini muffins for a church event, there were none left! may have to double it next time lol

The taste is there, but they were far too gooey!  The muffin itself, then adding the glaze, which was all very tasty, just turned the the paper cupcake cups to mush. Next time I would bake them with the liners.

Love this recipe!  So easy and yummy.  I left out the sugar and used apple juice instead of apple cider and everyone still loved them.  Will make every holiday season!  I also got 24 medium sized muffins.
