All of those reviews are just silly.  If you want a potato salad with celery and onions and paprika and other things, I'm sure you can find such a recipe on this website.  Why mess with one whose entire appeal is its simplicity?  Treating it as a "base" recipe is one thing, going on about all the extra things it "needs" is another.  Great dish for the younger guests at summer BBQs, since lots of kids are picky about onions and things.

Thank you!  I was looking for a base potato salad recipe just to get me started so I could make it to my taste.  I added a teaspoon of prepared mustard, a teaspoon of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar, and some browned and crumbled bacon.  It was perfect.

This is like my mother used to make and what our family still makes using Miracle Whip Salad Dressing, except we add salt and pepper to taste, finely minced onion also to taste,  about a teaspoon of yellow mustard, and mix the whole diced egg in too.
Be sure to use red potatoes boiled in their skins til fork tender, then cool in cold water, peel and dice. Mixed while still warm the flavors of the dressing will really meld with the potato and hard cooked diced egg.
Chill for several hours or overnight for the best flavor!

This recipe can be a five - with a few additions.  I made exactly as directed - but added a couple tablespoons of mustard, some dill, salt, pepper, then of course the paprika on top!  And it was the best potato salad I've made yet.  :)

This is the best recipe yet, because it's the basic. Then you have the option of adding your favorites to it.
And that's the fun of cooking!

This is such a great basic recipe.  I double this every time I make potato salad then split it and keep half the basic recipe and the other half I add in some "adult" ingredients (onions, sprinkle paprika, etc).  It's a hit!

This was a good recipe.  I think it is a good base.  I don't like lots of crunchy things in my potato salad.  I would like more of a kick to the dressing - some kind of extra spice.  Any ideas??  But I liked the simplicity of the rest of the ingredients.

I've made several batches of potato salad, recipes from this site and others.  According to my fiance, this is the BEST I've ever made!  That is only one reason I rated this 5 stars.  Another reason it because it's so easy.  I agree its laking seasoning, but I added salt and pepper and it's delicious.  Thank you very much, Lisa!

I made this recipe for a Fourth of July barbecue.  As a finishing touch, I crumbled some bacon over the top of it and mixed it in.  It was a hit, and people were even asking if they could bring some home. :)

This is the way potato salad is meant to be - simple and mouth-watering!  Instead of the dressing, I used mayo.

We made a huge batch of potato salad to take with us to the lake.  We were feeding a ton of people so we more than doubled it and added some chopped onions, pickles and mustard.  Very simple but tasty.  Thanks Lisa.

Absolutely awesome! Will never use any other recipe for Potato salad! I did add some S & P, Paprika, and Mustard to taste. But this is a FABULOUS base recipe! Two thumbs up! I personally don't like potato salad with the onions, peppers, and celery in it. THIS is so yummy, and easy to make!

Its alright.. Way to much dressing, I would try adding a 1/2 cup less dressing then suggested and stirring it and seeing if you like that consistency.

I liked it! I added pickle relish to give some crunch to it. I tried it first without the relish, and it was really good! My family thought that it needed something salty and crunchy. Very good!

All my life I've been picky about potato salad. I don't like celery in it, I don't like hard potatoes, I don't like it fancy, etc. But for some reason I was under the impression that potato salad was complicated. Now I know I can make it whenever I want!

I added diced dill pickle (mmm) and ate it on a sandwhich. LOVE!

This is an easy and excellent basic potato salad receipe, everyone loved it.  We have also made it with mayo instead (use a little bit less than called for) and then added celery, red onions and 1/2 tablespoon course mustard along with a touch of paprika and dill.

I'm always trying to find recipes to make for when my mom is working, and was super delighted with this potato salad. It tasted delicious and wasn't hard to make, plus it left some room open for my own additions. Thanks!!

We have found a new favorite! As the potatoes were boiling, I discovered I was almost out of mayo. So I substituted ranch dressing instead, and we love it! I want to use Shurfine's Bacon Ranch Dressing next time. I'm sure the bacon flavor will add even more to this recipe.

I very much appreciate simple, basic recipes like this one. They get you started and allow you to be creative and REALLY cook. I add salt and pepper, cucumber (very tasty!), diced pickles, celery, and sometimes bits of cheese, along with paprika sprinkled on top. Oh, and bacon! Thank you for this recipe and for all the comments with suggestions for other ingredients!

I have been trying for a long time to duplicate my Mothers potato salad. I tried all sorts of ingredients with no luck. Tried this recipe and BINGO! Just like mother used to make. It might have something to do with using miracle whip instead of mayo.

I love this recipe, as does my husband who is not a big potato fan.

Just one problem - and it's probably just my dumb luck, but I had to cook my potatoes for nearly an hour! And even then they were still to crunchy and not soft enough for a salad. :oP

I don't want mashed potates, but I hate crunchy potato salads!

This makes a very good basic recipe and was exactly what I was looking for. I added some chopped celery and threw in some bacon. Went over well with the guests.

I needed to use up some red potatoes and miracle whip. I used about 3x the potatoes and 5 eggs and made like the recipe stated. I ran out of miracle whip so added a bit of mayo as well as salt pepper and a tbsp of prepared mustard. Looks great and tasted great even warm.

I made this recipe even more simple.  I didn't have salad dressing so I just used mayo.  It tasted fresh and my family enjoyed real potato salad instead of that deli fare that is often bathed in too much dressing.  I would make it again.

I made some small changes to the recipe, and I was very happy with the end result! I used Kraft Light Mayo, red potatoes, and two hard-boiled eggs.  I stirred in unmeasured quantities of salt, pepper, and garlic powder (I used quite a bit of pepper and garlic powder, but not as much salt).  I then sprinkled more pepper and paprika on the top when I added the crumbled egg yolks.  It was very tasty!

What a great simple, but delicious potato salad recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use half Miracle Whip and half Mayonnaise. I added some salt and pepper, crumbled some bacon on top, and it was the best I ever made. Simplicity is the key that I have always been missing. Thank you Lisa.
