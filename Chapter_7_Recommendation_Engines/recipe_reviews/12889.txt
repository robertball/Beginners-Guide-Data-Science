I made this soup the other night.I thought that the flavor was very good. after reading some of the reviews,saying that they thought it was very bland, I did change 1 thing about the recipe.Not the ingredients,but just one step.I began with 2 TBLES. olive oil,heated,added celery,onion, garlic,a little salt &pepper to that and sauteed them til soft.Then added the broth and the rest of the ingredient's.This usually adds more flavor to the broth.

This is the recipe I've been looking for!!  I used to work for a specialty restaurant in the 80's that served a soup called "African Peanut Chicken"...it was by far the most popular soup.  The restaurant closed for business years ago and took the recipe with them!  I used the base of the recipe (the broth, tomatoes, onion, celery, chicken and garlic).  To make it "African" I used canned okra, corn, rice, cayenne pepper, and coriander.  It turned out great! I've dreamed of that soup for years and now I can have it anytime I want!  It even has the enthusiastic approval of my family, even my picky peanut-butter hating 13 year old daughter!

I loved this soup, very good recipe with a sweet flavor. the peanut butter gave it a thai flavor. i made the mistake of telling my boyfriend there was peanut butter in it though so he kept complaining about it even though he liked the soup. Word to the wise ladies: what your man doesnt know wont hurt him! : )

I love this soup!  I've made it several times.  It freezes well.  I like freezing it in individual portions and popping it in the microwave for lunch.  Yummy!

I was a little leary about trying out soup that had peanut butter in it, but with all the rave reviews, I decided, why not? I just got done with dinner and the soup was absolutely delicious! I didn't tell my boyfriend about the peanut butter until after he started eating. He couldn't believe it had peanut butter in it! And with all the healthy veggies in it, how could it be anything but great! We've added it to our list of our favorite recipes and I'm already looking foward to serving it again! :)

Wow!  This is SO good!  Even the broth is so delicious, which is unusual for a soup.  Next time, we'll try it in the slow cooker and add peanuts (though we used crunchy peanut butter and those little bits of crunch were great!)  Try this soup! Suspend disbelief!

Excellent soup.  As for peanut butter grittiness this might help.  A recipe for a simlilar peanut soup from Ghana I got years ago uses this method -   In a heavy saucepan cook peanut butter over low heat, stirring almost constantly. It will turn silky and runny, then start to firm up again. This is the most labor intensive step. Add 1 1/2 cups of the broth and mix until smooth.  Then add to soup

This recipe made me look like a genius!  I modified due to the veggies I had on hand so I ended up with potatoes, canned carrots, diced tomatoes, fresh broccoli, frozen stir fry veggies, frozen corn, and frozen onion.  I also added some rice in step 2.  HUGE hit w/my non-veggie loving family.  5 stars for sure!

This soup is great, but the best part, THE GREATEST PART, is that my 2 year old daughter that has been on a hunger strike will eat it.  Awesome.  She likes it more than fish sticks and mac and cheese.

I love peanut butter on pretty much everything so I knew I would love this soup.  It is so good.  I prepared it according to the recipe except that I added one more clove of garlic.  I thought the flavor was absolutely perfect.  When I read the reviews where people say it is bland so they added cayenne or curry (???) I have to wonder if these people accept anything as flavorful without it being spicy.  Lack of a spicy zing does not equal bland.  It's just a different flavor.  Spicy is not the only flavor out there.  And I personally LOVE the subtle flavor of this soup.  It is the flavor of all the vegetables blended together, and the peanut butter adds an extra boost.  I think it's perfect.  If you're looking for something spicy, make a different soup--don't ruin this one with cayenne pepper!

I'm sorry...I hate to give a bad review but we just did not care for this at all. I thought it sounded delicious but it was very bland, the PB didn't add much at all. I followed the directions exactly other than to saute the veggies together in a bit of oil first- which should have helped add flavor. I feel this soup is crying out for some curry, and some spice- seems like a weak imitation of Thai food without it.

We loved this!  I read that many thought it was a little bland, so, since my family likes a lot of flavor...I decided to add a handful (about a tablespoon) of manchu curry powder, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  That added just the right amount of kick, but still not too spicy for my 8 and 9 year olds to handle.  My husband brought the leftovers to work for lunch the next day, which is always the sign of an awesome meal!

Annie,  I don't know what to say, A "Thank You" is not enough.  This recipe deserves 10 stars!  I made your soup the other day because it was a cool day here in Texas and it just seemed like a soup kinda day to me.  Hubby came in frome work said something really smell good...He was so down hearted when I told him it was chicken soup, as he is NOT a soup lover.  He came in here to play on the computer so I brought a small bowl of soup in for him to taste,  after the first bite he grabed the bowl away from me and told me this was really good soup. He told me to give it 5 stars.  The next night we had leftover soup and after eating his fill he stood and declared "This is the best soup I have ever eaten."  I also took some of this to my Mother and Dads for lunch.  Daddy gave it 5 stars, Mother 4 stars as she isn't much of a chicken lover.  As other reviewers stated they used their own veggies I did the same.  Don't care for the squash family.  I used asian type veggies, & doubled the recipe because of sharing it with my parents.  I finally told my hubby that the soup had peanut butter (he hates the stuff) in it and ask if he would ever eat it again, he thought for a second or two and then said YES.  Miracles do happen.  Thank you!   Thank you!  Thank you!

On our journey to healthier eating we discovered this recipe and it has become a staple!!!  My husband has been a complete vegiphobe in the past but loves this soup!  He takes it for lunch and adds a small can of corn and it really makes a meal out of it.  Being a fan of spicy food, I prefer to substitute the can of regular tomatoes with a can of Ro-Tel tomoatoes, the spicy of the Ro-Tel and the sweet of the peanut butter makes for an awesome combination.

This is incredible.  The vegetables are so fresh.  I thought the tomatoes would make it weird, but it really makes it great.  I just used canned diced tomatoes.  The timing of everything is great; nothing was too mushy or underdone.  Try this, you won't regret it!

A 1/2 cup of peanut butter sounded like alot.  Found the conversion of Tablespoons to 1/2 Cup is 8 Tablespoons.  I did 4 T to begin with and then tasted.  I found the soup needed the full 8T.  Got with the peanut butter...you won't be sorry

I made this with a few changes and it turned out ok. The only changes i made were that I used frozen peas and corn, didn't add zucchini and used red bell pepper instead of green just for looks-sake. I cut the recipe in half allowed the chicken bones to boil with the stock for a few minutes. I mixed some cornflour in to thicken up the soup and added spiral pasta to make it a meal. A little more peanut butter was added and the whole pot was swollowed up by 4 people in a matter of minutes. I like this soup for its nutritional value and it is always nice to have a hearty meal.

Great tasting soup.  My husband said it's the best soup I've ever made.  I used natural peanut butter and since I am low carb dieting, I added a medium peeled, diced turnip instead of potato. I also used a can of rotel tomatoes instead of plain tomatoes and an additional 2 tbs of peanut butter since subtlety is wasted on me.  It still didn't taste like peanut butter, but has a great flavor.  I sprinkled chinese red pepper on my serving. (forgot to add that I cooked an entire medium chicken for this recipe!)

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Love, love, love it.  I thickened it up a tad with cornstarch, as we prefer it that way.  So many variations with so many vegetables.  I used canned chicken, and it was excellent.  Next time, I would use two cans!  Thanks a million!!

AMAZING!!!!!!
I crave this soup all the time, and I HATE soup usually.  I used potatoes and zucchini and carrots instead of broccoli. I also used Extra Chunky peanut butter. The textures were incredible. I tell people it has a "nut paste" in it when they ask.

This is a very good soup, better with the addition of cayenne, corriander, and paprika.  I used frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) in place of the broccoli.

Honestly, this really was the best soup I have ever tasted. I can't even believe that I made it!  a couple of changes I made - I used frozen California blend vegtables (zuch, carrots, pea pods, lima beans) and canned diced tomatoes with jalepenos.  It really added some heat and gave the soup a real thai flavor along with the peanut butter.  My friends thought I was nuts for even printing this one out, but I am so glad I did!  Now I am nuts for this soup!!

Holy Moses, this is a good recipe.  I left out the chicken and added some crushed red pepper flakes, and it couldn't have been better.  I actually fantasized about this soup while I was at work.

OMG!!! Fantastic flavor!  Like others I carmelized the onion, carrots and celery in a little olive oil first, then added the remaining ingredients.  I also added the coriander as suggested by another cook.  This is a definite keeper and I will be making this again!

Amazing! I'm eating it right now. I added dried chilis to mine for some kick and topped it with chopped green onions. Also crushed some peanuts and threw them in. So good!

Wow, this is so good.  The peanut butter gives it such an interesting flavor.  The only change I made was to use a tomato from our garden instead of the canned.  DH won't like this, but that's ok...more for me!

I pretty much made this, but sort of combined it with another recipe, the African Peanut Soup because I found it first, but I really wanted the chicken and extra veggies, but I also added the rice.  The two together were awesome!  We loved it!

This was tasty.  The pb added a kind of Thai taste to it, and just made it unique.  I added lots of veggies, as other reviewers have suggested.  Freezes well too.

Excellent!!  The only thing I did not like was the broccoli was mushy.  Next time, I plan on putting the fresh uncooked broccoli in each bowl and poring the soup on top of it.  

I also added one jalapeno pepper.. I might add two next time.

Love peanut soup!! I put some jalapeno and cayenne pepper in mine cause i like it spicy! To go  Thai on this one add a little coconut milk and a fresh squeezed lime at the end. But it is wonderful like this!! You can be creative with the veggies in this one! Thank you for this great soup!!

This was awful. I used the natural peanut butter like someone suggested, and I wouldn't recommend that.  My whole house smelled like a burnt peanut butter chicken mixture, and this soup fixed my boyfriend's craving for peanut butter for life.  He's not sure he ever wants to eat pb again because it'll bring back flashbacks of this soup.

My husband who loves peanut butter had no clue that there was peanut butter in the recipe.  He did really enjoy the soup.  There is some peanut butter taste but it's not overwhelming; it kind of changes the texture of the soup.  I sauteed the onion with the garlic in a little olive oil 1st.  I  eliminated the green pepper, used petite cut tomatoes to eliminate the chopping, & used a reduced fat peanut butter.  Finally I substituted whole wheat small pasta (which I cooked separately so it wouldn't become too mushy) for the potatoes.

A great way to get the kids to eat vegetables. I was a little worried about the peanut butter but it really made the broth. I might try thickening the broth a bit next time however, my family said it was a little too thin. I sent the left overs home with my mom and she said it was the best soup she had ever had. Great review coming from somebody who makes home made soup at least once a week. We will definately use the recipe again.

Very nice!!! Instead of using canned chicken broth, I 1st sauteed onion & garlic w/ olive oil in pot, added water, 1 chicken bouillion cube, & 4 fresh chicken breasts.  I also added 1/2 cup rice & 1 can of creamed corn. Next time I will add a can of spicy canned tomatoes. Def. a keeper, thanx for sharing!

My teenager requested this soup today so it's bubbling away! I make my own stock and sometimes don't have all the veggies but it's still great every time. Today I doubled the peanut butter, since that's my daughter's favorite part, and we didn't have broccoli or zucchini, but it's still great. Thanks for a simple yet unusual recipe.

Awesome!  I must admit, I was skeptical about the peanut butter, but you must try it!  I doubled all the vegetables, and the result was a very thick & hearty soup!  I also used a rotisserie chicken, and added it to the very end, as it doesn't need to cook.  I've never heard of a soup recipe not starting with oil and the onion, so I tweaked it:  I heated 1 1/2 Tbl. olive oil, and added the celery, onion, bell pepper, and garlic, sauteeing until all were soft.  I then followed the rest of the steps (as a timesaver, I used a can of *diced* tomatoes instead of whole).  Note that using reduced fat peanut butter is just fine!  I added 1/2 tsp. salt + 1/2 tsp. pepper at the end, and would use those measurements again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Everyone's right about how versatile the soup is; I didn't even have regular potatoes on hand, so I used some bagged hash brown potatoes instead, and it's still awesome!  My four-year-old is gobbling it up as I write this!

I had such high hopes for this, as I love peanut butter, but I did not care for it.  I ended up throwing away the entire pot.  It was that bad.  I followed the directions given.

Awesome soup! I usually don't do so well with the soup thing. I made two: one was a veggie version. To that I used veggie broth & a 15 bean combo + extra kidney beans (all of the dried kind; soak, cook first) about 1 cup each of those. And then cooked & added (cooked) barley to some also. Also donated some of the beans to the chicken version. I know, it was a little loaded, but sooo good. Mom & Hubby loved it. And since Mom was just home from some (spinal) surgery, her throat was a little sensitive to solids, and she was fine. Really, really good. Thanks!

A very hearty soup! I read a lot of the reviews and made some of the suggested changes. I don't like peppers (or they don't like me) so I omitted them but added about 1/2 cup or so of chopped green onions. I sautéed the onions, garlic, about half the celery (I like my veggies on the firmer side but knew that sautéing them would add great flavor) and green onions, cooking until tender. I only had a 48 oz can of chicken broth on hand so I added to it 2 cups of water and two bouillon cubes. I didn't measure any of the other vegetable ingredients but if anything they were all more than what was called for. I added the chicken (Costco’s rotisserie chicken) in the second step. I also used about 3/4 cup of peanut butter. The soup tastes great! It's great the next day too. The only changes I will make next time is reduce the cooking time and add the chicken just before adding the peanut butter as the veggies were a little softer than I like and while the chicken wasn't tough it was a little over cooked. My picky Hubby loved it and so did my coworkers. Although it takes a lot of time chopping everything, it is well worth it. I will make more next time so I can freeze it.

Very good. I changed it this way (little time on my hands, college student):

bag of frozen potato, corn, carrot, broccoli, pepper mix
1.5 cups frozen broccoli
4 cups organic chicken broth
1/4 cup peanutbutter (maybe less)
small amount of pepper
2-3 Tb dried onion
1.5 Tb garlic
1 can diced tomatoes

Seperate carrot, corn, potato and add to soup in a rice cooker
Add onion (dried)
Cook until boiling
Add garlic, broccoli, peppers
Add diced tomatoes
Heat until boiling again
Add peanut butter mixed in with some water, and pepper.

It was pretty good, and very easy. All I needed was two bags frozen veggies, box of chicken soup, some Skippy peanut butter, dried onions, and garlic, all of which were on hand. Excellent pantry/freezer dish.

This is now a family favorite.  When I had to make a dish for a sick friend I made this soup and she called for the recipe.  My daughter is taking a copy to visit her husband before he is shipped overseas, because it is his favorite as well.  I add a cup of cooked egg noodles (the thicker homestyle kind) as my grandsons like to slurp the noodles.  Even people that wrinkle their noses at the name like this soup.  I have fixed it about a dozen times and it is the only "leftover" that is finished off the next day. Very yumalicious!!

I love this soup. I make huge potfuls 3-4 times every winter. I have substituted a product called Better than Peanut Butter, for the Peanut Butter in the recipe and it tastes just fine.. maybe a little lighter in peanut flavor. It greatly reduces the fat content of the soup.

This soup is simply amazing.  I cut it down from 8 cups of water to 6, although if you like a soup with a lot of broth, then stick with the 8 cups; if you don't, then drop down to 6 cups, or thicken however you please.  I tossed a few dashes of some hot sauce in while it was cooking, but it doesn't even need that the taste is so good.  My wife kept saying, "This is really good" over and over.

awsome soup!
I boiled the 2lbs of drum sticks in 8cups of water with 4 chicken bullion cubes. Once the chicken was cooked I took them out and cut them in to cubes then returned to the pot and continued the recipe as instructed. Everyone loved it from my 1 year old daughter to my 30 year old sister and our mother. Will definatly make this much more!

Very good soup...my alterations were to add some ground coriander, cilantro (instead of parsley), and chick peas. For veggies, I used potato, green pepper, celery, and onion. Oh, I also added some tiny shells of pasta. Very good and fast!!

I used this recipe but changed up the veggies a bit according to our tastes.  I added about a cup of okra, used sweet potatoes instead of reg, added about one cup of each corn, carrots and edamame.  I cooked the onion, celery, garlic and bell pepper in about a TBSP of olive oil.  I ended up adding more chicken broth b/c it was getting too thick for our tastes.  I probably added a little more crunchy peanut butter than called for also.  We loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe that can be adapted for different tastes.  BTW, I did add a little tabasco to mine!
Follow-up:  Mine was not very good later reheated so best to eat this the day you make it.

Not very good, the flavor was very different and vegetables didn't hold the peanut flavor.

After reading all of the reviews, I was excited to make it.  It tasted okay, until I added the peanut butter.  The smell and the taste was horrible.  The recipe was very time consuming and the end result was not good.  My daughter who eats everything would not even try it because of the smell.

I added Coriander and Cayenne per another reviewers recommendation. You can throw any veggies you want in. Or rice. Never tried with beans.

So good. Reasonably healthy and very hearty. I added an extra dollop of Peanut Butter to it, but I don't think you need to. A tip: (albeit less healthy) try putting some crumbled bacon across the top of each bowl.

- Just made it again and threw in some corn and fresh spinach. Honestly, this is the best soup recipe I've ever made from allrecipes.

I feel like an outcast after all the great reviews this soup has gotten, but.... I thought it was incredibly boring and bland. The peanut butter is an interesting twist, but not interesting enough to keep me coming back for more. :(

So delicous! I took the advice of one of the previous reviewers and sauteed the onions and garlic first and then started the recipe as written. I think that helped a lot with giving the broth a more complex flavor. I tasted it after it was done and was a little scared, since the peanut butter overwhelmed the rest. I gave it some time in the fridge and warmed up a bowl for lunch the next day. So worth the wait - It is outstanding! Best part: one serving is 4 weight watchers points!

This Soup is so great!  I didn't have potatoes so I left them out and added eggplant, yellow bell pepper, and mushrooms along with all the vegetable listed. Soooo Yummy!  I served it with Rice and cornbread.  My husband loved it!  I even told him about the peanut butter.

The PB does give a rich warm taste. Don't leave it out. I made a quick broth and the meat from some chicken wings and a carcass, saved from another time, then made the soup from that. To make it lo-carb, I subbed a sweet potato and a can of chickpeas for the potatoes. Other than that, i pretty much followed the recipe except that my can of tomatoes also had okra in it, and I used dried parsley. (Don't forget salt. I did at first, and it is key.) Very delicious--I'm eating it leftover for lunch today and it keeps getting better! To make the recipe a little smaller, I used the same amount of vegetables the menu writer said, the chicken I already had (admittedly, a small amount), and about 2.5 quarts of liquid. This yielded 5 meal-size servings. Try squeezing fresh lime into the soup when you eat it. This Latin technique is great against a rich soup.

This was really good.  I took the suggestion of sauteing my onion, celery and garlic in olive oil first.  I also added 1 cup of white wine and cooked my chicken breasts in the soup for 3 - 4 hours and shredded it in the soup.  I think cooking the chicken in the soup just gives everything more flavor.  I also added a cup of cubed acorn squash, a little red pepper flakes for some heat and a teaspon of lime juice to brighten the flavor.  This was a really good soup.  We served it with couscous with golden raisins.  We ended up mixing our couscous into our soup bowls and the sweetness of the raisins was really good!  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is phenomenal!!!  I read the reviews before cooking it, but was still a bit nervous right before dropping the Peanut butter in the soup.  It looked pretty good on its own.  I did put the PB in and am so glad I did!!  This is amazing.  It makes this soup incredible.  I did put a significant amount of pepper in at the end.  Also, I added some cayenne pepper...not too much maybe  1/2 tsp...this keeps the soup feeling warm even when it starts to cool off....I think its a trick the restaurants use.

AMAZING!! I made a few changes to make this for 2 people: I thawed 1 chicken breast, and simmered it with onions, carrots, and spices. Then drained, put back in the pot and added the veggies, simmered, and added about a 1/2 tbsp peanut butter. I used fresh green beans that I french cut and chopped zucchini(trying to use up what was left in the fridge!) and omitted the tomatoes because I didn't have any. You'd never know there was peanut butter in this soup and the flavor is amazing. My soup tasted like delicious, southern, comfort food-without the guilt!! =)

This recipe supprised me, I like some others on here were doubtful of the peanut butter at first, but it really makes the soup. I used all natural reduced fat peanut butter and I thew in a handful of tri colored pasta for added color and thinkness. Definately a keeper!

I was apprehensive at first but willing to try it because it sounded different from regular chicken soup. Like others I have to admit the peanut butter does throw you but it's great! I love soups and make them often in the winter and this one is a keeper.

This soup was sooo good and really easy.  I was intrigued by the peanut butter and totally surprised at how great it tasted.  It's basically just throwing chicken and veggies into some broth and adding peanut butter at the end.  You can't get much easier than that, but the best part was the hard to please boys in the house LOVED it!!  Definitely  a new, soon-to-be regular, dinner for us.

I used Wyler's chicken broth granules and Skippy natural creamy peanut butter.  Instead of measuring the green pepper and zucchini, I just added the whole thing.  It took longer than the suggested time for my veggies to cook.  Before adding the PB, the soup looked so pretty and already tasted excellent!  But, I added it, and I am glad I did - it has that Thai look to it, but the flavor just adds a sweet richness - not really a peanut butter flavor at all.  Something different than I'm used to, but excellent!  My mom, who is very traditional in her foods, even loved this!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make it more like chicken soup than vegetable soup.  After I add the peanut butter, I let it cook longer than the time stated and it loses that peanut butter taste but adds a much deeper flavor to the broth.  It's very good.

This recipe is fantastic!  Don't be aprehensive because of the peanut butter.  It's like in Asian (Thai) cuisine, ingredients that you typically would not put together end up suprising you with delicious flavors!
It's also a pretty healthy meal, with lots of veggies in each serving.  I though my vegetarian friends could use vegetable broth and tofu in place of the chicken broth and chicken.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I added a little Chinese 5-spice, and a dash of cayenne to further the oriental flavor of the soup.  We think either dumplings or home-made egg-noodles would finish this dish perfectly.

I decreased the peanut butter to 1/4 cup.  I could still taste the peanut butter, but other family members who did not know about it did not realize it was in there.

This soup is absolutely scrumptious!   I pressured cooked chicken breast and thighs to keep their flavor and make my own broth.  Sauteed the garlic, onion and bell pepper to bring out their flavor.  Yummy!

The peanut butter was a fun twist on a chicken veggie soup and I liked the variety of veggies in it.

Really good. Based on the other reviews, I was worried the soup would be a little bland, so I sauteed the celery, onion, carrot and garlic in olive oil first with thyme and marjoram, and some red pepper flakes for a little kick. Then I added some mushrooms about two minutes before I added the chicken and potatoes. I used some mini potatoes I had left over and left the skins on for more nutrition. Then I added a can of corn with the zucchini, and I used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. Not a big fan of green pepper so I left that out. I also used chunky peanut butter. When I tasted it, it was still missing a little something for me, so I added a little hot Hungarian paprika (I like spicy). Yum! I like that there was a lot of broth, but if you aren't a fan of broth I think about 6 cups chicken broth would be fine.

Very good soup, but docking a star for looks--also, the flavors don't get a chance to layer and build on themselves so it's a little "flat." I wouldn't say "bland" but just not as interesting as I thought a peanut butter soup would be. If I make this again, I may go with chunky peanut butter or add in some chopped roasted peanuts as another reviewer said they did. I think some "crunch" would help. I did use another reviewer's suggestion of sauteeing the garlic, celery, onion, salt and pepper in some oil first before adding the broth.

This is really good, the only changes I made was added yellow squash along with the zucchini, minus broccoli and green pepper (didnt have any) and it was delicious. Thank you for the recipe, its a keeper for me.

I was looking forward to making this soup as I do like cooking with peanut butter in both sweet and savoury recipes. I followed the recipe exactly and it did make a good soup. However, I tasted the soup to check for seasoning just before adding the peanut butter and I have to say I preferred it without the peanut butter. In fact next time I will   leave it out altogether and maybe instead, add chilli and coconut milk and sprinkle some toasted peanuts as a garnish for a thai style soup.

The soup as listed is pretty good, but it can be excellent with some changes. I doubled all the veggies (tripling the garlic) and used a bit more chicken (2lb raw). I cooked the chicken in a crockpot with the tomatoes, a little salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp each granulated garlic, turmeric, and cumin, and 1/2 tbsp each chili powder and dried parsley; the blend spent 5 hours on low, then I shredded the chicken. I flash sauteed the onions, garlic and celery in 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and added the veggies, stock and chicken/tomato/spice mixture. I brought the pot to a boil, reduced the heat to medium, simmered for about 5 minutes, then added the peanut butter and fresh parsley. I let it simmer for another 15 minutes or so, leaving the lid on because the additional veg/chicken meant that I had to conserve as much liquid as possible. It was thick like a stew, and very flavorful. In terms of the appearance, the added spices gave the broth some very pretty red and orange notes. I'm giving the recipe only 4 stars as written, but I think it's worthy of 5 stars with my changes.

Sorry, but as written I didn't think this soup had much flavor.  It tasted more like something you'd get in a hospital--healthy, but with no seasoning. Following other reviewers suggestions definitely helped though, since I thought this recipe had potential. I started with lower salt chicken broth, but then added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 3/4 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp curry powder, 1/4 tsp. ground coriander and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper. It now has a wonderful, slightly spicy depth of flavor that lingers on your palate a bit. NOW it's deserving of 5 stars.

I really wish I could give this a 3.5, because the recipe is almost there but not quite. As is, there is barely any seasoning and the soup is pretty bland. The peanut butter does add a lovely touch but it still needs more depth of flavor, in my opinion. After tasting this as written I went to my pantry and added some coriander, cumin and curry powder. That really brought the dish from good to great. I had read other reviewers which had used those additionally as well and agree it brought the soup where it needed to be. This is definitly a good base to play around with, it just seems the recipe isn't quite done.

I had all the ingredients (which is unusual for me) so I thought I would give this one a try...  After reading all the great reviews, I was expecting the soup to be a big hit with my whole family but it wasn't - at all.  I was very disappointed.  My husband & I both agree it only deserves about about 3.5 stars.  I don't think the peanut butter did anything to improve this soup.  And since I can't waste food, I get to eat the left overs...

I was looking for a new soup recipe and came across this one.  It was excellent.  I cooked the onions, celery, pepper and garlic in oil first then followed the rest of the recipe.  My adult children couldn't get enough of it.  Love the peanut butter flavor in the soup.  I will be making this recipe often.

This was surprisingly good!  Used the stock I had made out of a rotisserie chicken.  Peanut butter (I used crunchy!) was a great touch.

Amazing! This is one of the first soups I ever tried to make and I'm so pleased with how it turned out. The peanut butter gives it a creaminess and is better for you than actual cream. I was short on a few of the vegetables the first time I made this so I skimped a bit on the broth. The consistency was perfect.

I used the advice of others. I doubled the peanut butter. I simmered it then added about 1.5 cups of broth before adding it to the soup. I left out celery because we don't like it. I should have added a little curry and cayenne powders; my husband seasoned his servings with them.

this was good, not the BEST soup I have ever tasted, but good nonetheless. I was expecting it to be more "creamy", but it was pretty watery instead.   instead of pre-cooking my chicken, I just put raw frozen chicken breasts in with the broth, and let them cook in the soup, then shredded once done. Saved me more hassle and dirty dishes. Also, I went with another reviewer and sauteed the garlic, onion, and carrots in coconut oil first, then added the broth and so forth. :)  I omitted the celery and zucchini since I didn't have any on hand.

This turned out very tasty. The peanut butter gives a nice flavor and makes this a very filling dish. Great way to use up extra veggies. I did have to add a bunch of spices, though, to kick it up to 5 stars. Crushed red pepper is a nice contrast to the sweetness of the peanut butter.

I thought this was very good, but my husband just thought it was OK. I made half a recipe and put everything in the crock pot on low and cooked for 4 hours. Then I added frozen peas, corn, broccoli, green & red peppers and peanut butter and cooked for ~1 hour more. This was a fun change from normal chicken soup!

Excellent soup.  This recipe was originally published in Jane Brody's "Good Food Book" back in the 80's.  The only difference is that Jane's recipe called for a full cup of peanut butter.  My boys loved this soup when they were growing up, and my husband still asks me to make it!

Great soup, with a few changes.  When cooking the chicken, add a little curry spice.  Instead of regular potato, use sweet potato. Add a little chili powder and a few red pepper flakes, if you like it spicy.  Also, make brown rice and serve the soup over the rice.  Ummmmm.  Everyone in the family loved it, including my 14, 11, and 8 year old girls.

This is a great soup! I love the flavor. Since the recipe calls for canned whole tomatoes, I used diced - figured I'd save a little time and effort. I added 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper which was perfect for me.

This is a nice soup.  You can't really taste the PB in the soup, but you can smell it.  I followed the recipe, though I didn't measure any of the veggies. It's def worth a try!  It hasn't replaced my go to veggie soup, but I'm glad I tried it.

Oh, yum!!!  Like everyone, I tailored it just a bit, omitting the broccoli and substituting peas.  I also tossed in a bit of orzo near the end instead of potatoes.  It was my turn to bring soup to the office, and everyone liked it.  I didn't tell them about the peanut butter until they had all said they liked it. :)

Loved the flavor!! I too hesitated before adding peanut butter-what a nice surprise!! Probably added 1/3 cup. I did not have all veggies called for; used carrots, celery, potatoes,onion, red pepper and peas. Used combo of beef and chicken broth because it was all I had and added cooked orzo. Will make again.

SUPER soup! I added some jalapeno and sesame oil to give it a more Thai flavor. And I would have liked some crushed peanuts on top, but overall, it has an outstanding flavor and is unlike any other soup I've had. I will make this again and again.

I loved this soup!! The only changes I made was adding more chicken. I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded it into the soup. I also didn't add the broccoli, but added more carrots and zucchini. I can't wait to make it again!! My boyfriend was a little apprehensive with the PB, but loved it too!

A staple around our home is homemade soup.  I make it 2-3 times a week and so we have plenty of leftovers for the next day's lunch and dinner.  I am usually pretty good at determining if the ingredients to a recipe will result in rich flavors or not.  I didn't think this soup would have a good flavor but I made it anyway due to all the high ratings.  I found it very blah.  The peanut butter definately gives it mild Asian flavor but very subtle and bland. That mixed with potatoes I found did not jive to well. I followed the advice of others and just turned it full over to a dish of the Orient by adding Chinese 5 spice and Coconut Milk then served it over jasmine rice.  However, it was still not fantastic but at least saved a boring soup from not being eaten.  To me this soup would be a good twist for those who love vegetable soup but are tired of the same old thing.  However, I would stick to another receipe that omits the PB and adds other spices.

This recipe separates the boys from the men. I felt such peer pressure from the reviews ("just do it" - "don't do it!"). I'M GLAD I PUT IN THE PB!!! I could smell it - and it made the borth more opaque - but it does NOT lend a nutty flavor. Just a fullness. My boyfriend was shocked. I was relieved. We both went to bed with full bellies.

***Word of advice put half the amount of peanut butter in half the soup to try it before you ruin the whole batch. Tasted Great until added the Peanut Butter.

I didn't want to do it. I almost didn't. I was standing there holding the peanut butter over the pot questioning myself. I'm so glad I did. This will be my chicken soup recipe for a long time coming.I did add eggnoodles and more broth. mmmm

After reading several reviews, I was comfortable just using whatever frozen veggies I had: stir fry peppers and onions, brocolli and carrots. Like others I seasoned and sauteed my chicken with the stirfry veggies ahead of time and I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I left that out. The only other modification I did was adding coconut milk at the end and red peppers which really gave it a nice kick. Next time i'll replace the brocolli with mushrooms since it resembles tai coconut soup a little....wondering if I should have used a bit more peanut butter for a slightly sweeter taste. I trimmed it back as others suggested....

THE best recipe I've tried in a long time! I'm telling you, it was great! I only had crunchy peanut butter and it was great with it (not sure if the peanuts will be soggy in tomorrow's leftovers) but I'm sure it'll still taste great. I added quartered mushrooms which soaked in the flavor.

Made my own broth, starting with a little sauted garlic, onion and celery as others have done, and used Better than Bouillon chicken base.  I cooked a split skinless bone-in fryer breast (two fairly big pieces) in the broth for 45 minutes, then took the chicken out and cooled it in the fridge before pulling it off the bone and popping it back in.  Instead of just salt and pepper I also added a pinch of turmeric and a couple of tablespoons of a pre-made chicken spice blend, which had equal parts rosemary, sage, thyme, parsley, celery seed, and black pepper.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This soup was SO GOOD with corn muffins!  Will definitely make again and again.

I was surprised at how much we enjoyed this!  My husband generally does not like peanut butter, but he had two huge bowls of this yummy soup.  Even after I told him the "secret ingredient", he got another.  Quick, easy, healthy - will definitely go into the rotation.  *I added some fresh mushrooms, and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping the can of whole tomatoes.

After reading the rave reviews, I decided I needed to try this. Sorry, my husband and I did not care for this at all. The soup itself was quite bland and the peanut butter gave it a very odd taste to us. I wound up throwing away the whole pot.  My husband and I love peanut butter, but not this meal. Oh well, glad others like it so much! :-)

I bought a cooked chicken from Costco and was going to make chicken noodle soup, when I ran across this recipe.  WOW!  I didn't have potatoes on hand so I used sweet potatoes.  I also added some cumin, red curry paste and rice.  It was perfect!  I can't wait to make this again and take it to a potluck.  It will be the hit of the party!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Pretty tasty!  I used sweet potatoes, peas instead of broccoli, skipped the green pepper and used a whole can of diced tomatoes.  I agree that this would be pretty unexciting and bland as written... I added lots of cumin, some coriander, cayenne, and paprika and that helped to enhance flavors.  This was not as spectacular as I expected it to be, but I did like it and will likely make it again at some point, but not often.  Also, keep in mind that this makes a LOT OF SOUP.  There's only 2 of us and we ate it for 3 days... thanks for the different recipe!

I used chunky peanut butter which gives this soup a wonderful smooth flavor. I also cooked this recipe in my slow cooker all day on low. For those who think this recipe is to bland, part of cooking is tweaking recipes as you cook them. Be sure to have a couple tastes of this during the process and add some spice if you desire. Everyone has a different palate.

I thought it had a great taste. I omitted the veggies (because my boyfriend doesn't eat them) and used egg noodles and corn. He wasn't crazy about it but I thought that the broth would be good reduced and used with some sort of chinese noodle for a great Thai dish! I am sure with all the other ingredients makes a great soup!

AWESOME soup!  I actually forgot to add the tomatoes, and I intentially omitted the green pepper and zuchini.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had! I will make it frequently, although I'm not sure now if I will even try to put the tomatoes in, it is so good without it!  Very easy to make too.

Delicious!  I made this exactly as the recipe reads and added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  It really does get better as leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!

9/12 - This time I sauteed the chicken pieces in olive oil, salt, and a generous amount of lemon pepper.  While the chicken was cooking, I added an onion, 2 carrots, and 2 stalks of celery.  Afterwards, I added the chicken broth and potatoes and brought everything to a boil for 10 min. before adding the rest of the veggies.

This was a really nice winter soup.  Heartier, for sure, than a normal soup.  My husband (who was unaware of the added peanut butter) thought the broth was bit thick.  Also it is hearty in veggies, which is great. I will definitely make it again, though next time I may cut back on the veggies and add some kind of noodles.  I also used the cumin and cayenne and it was much better after these additions.

Fantastic recipe!  The only thing I did differently was add a bit more salt and pepper than the recipe called for at the end.  (We prefer our soups rather seasoned.)  Even my picky kids ate it!  I'll definitely make it again (and again and again!)!

It turned out all right.  I don't think I will make it again though.  The flavor was decent but it seemed to want to separate on me.  I was a bit disappointed since we really love the African Sweet Potato and Peanut soup, which also calls for peanut butter.  Oh well, it is definitely worth a try!  Perhaps I did something to cause it to separate or maybe it is my peanut butter??

I loved this soup, will make this again,I just added more veggies & rice to the soup. I will make this again, especially when my husband enjoyed it as well. He can taste the peanut butter, so there was no way of hiding that taste. Most important my husband hates SOUP & he rate this a 5 STARS. Thanks for the recipe

Great soup for a cool day!  So simple to make, I didn't have broccoli on hand so I substituted peas which worked out well.
The peanut butter added something different!  The taste was very unique, could not tell that p.b. was added.  My husband who is not a soup eater had 2 bowls!  Thanks!

This was very good! You can add whatever veggies you feel like. I omitted the broccoli and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. The peanut butter gives it a creamy taste. My hubbie liked it! Thanks!!!

Wasn't flavorful enough for my liking. I threw in some lime, cilantro and cumin to jazz it up a bit. Then it was quite nice- I thought about leaving out the potatoes but in the end I was glad I didn't. The soup was better for leftovers.

"Peanut butter in my soup?!" That was what I said when I saw this recipe. Well, you never know until you try it. And I tried it and thought it was great. The peanut butter adds such a rich flavor without really tasting like peanut butter. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again.

I'm not quite sure what others see in this recipe. It's nice as a novelty, but I'm really glad I made this for lunch when my husband was at work.  This would work for kids, who would like it just because it has "peanut butter" in the name, but I could never serve this to friends or guests.

I followed the recipe exactly, and had to add sugar, vinegar, and cayenne pepper to bring out any flavor at all.

Me and my hubby both loved it - we had two bowls each - yummy! I thought it looked a little funny in color so i added a bit of tomato puree to darken it up - other than that - i stuck to the recipe -- it was delicious and i will make it again.

Really yummy-- I added in a little cayenne pepper for kick but I think it would be good without it as well.. My fiance loved it and when i told him the "secret ingredient" he said "that explains why it makes me think of that asian salad you make" (I use peanut butter and cayenne in the dressing)-- I am a big fan of sesame and peanut oil and I feel that the peanut butter gave it a similar quality only the richness of the peanut butter was able to permeate the whole soup-- YUM YUM

I love homemade soup in the cold weather months and am always on the lookout for something different.  The peanut butter in this caught my eye.  I made it tonight and at first was skeptical.  It made a HUGE pot full of soup and I was afraid I had wasted a lot of ingredients.  Was I wrong!  What an unusual and wonderful flavor! And it looked so pretty and colorful.  I may wish I had given 5 stars when we eat the leftovers tomorrow.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe. As other reviewers suggested, this soup can be made with whatever vegetables are on hand. I used a bag of frozen California mix (broccoli, cauliflower, carrot) and added fresh zucchini, green pepper, onion, and celery, a box of slightly wilted grape tomatoes, and some leftover broccoli. Left out potatoes for lower carbs.

Used store-bought leftover lemon-herb rotisserie chicken. After cutting up 2+ cups of chicken, I simmered bones in 4 c. organic vegetable broth and 4 c. water, onion with skins quartered, celery stalks, bay leaf, and whole black pepper. Result: wonderful stock.

Didn't have any peanut butter so I made my own in my Vita-Mix from blanched, lightly salted peanuts. Consequently, my soup didn't have the sweetness some reviewers commented about. Since rotisserie chicken often results in overcooked chicken when using in certain recipes, I added the chicken to soup right at the end. But the chicken still seemed overcooked so next time I'll try cooking my own chicken. But, anyone trying this recipe can be assured that, no matter how your chicken is prepared and whatever vegetables used, you will be proud to serve a somewhat exotic, especially flavorful and healthy soup.

This soup is SHOCKINGLY GOOD!  I was already making a pot of my regular old chicken soup from a leftover carcass.  I was looking for a way to make it a little different, less boring.  So, while everything was simmering I started scanning the soup recipes and came across this one.  I was pretty skeptical, but I couldn't ignore the incredible reviews.  So, I took a chance.  Everyone is right.  The peanut butter does add this incredibly unique taste that is very complimentary to the chicken - it does remind me of Thai food.  You don't even need to necessarily follow the recipe exactly.  I just found whatever vegetables I had in my fridge, chopped them up and threw them in without measuring.  I also thickened it up a bit by making a slurry out of flour and water (I shook it up to blend it), then I added it to the soup.  It made it creamier.  My husband and even my daughter LOVED it.  I was afraid to tell them about the peanut butter, but I did and they were completely surprised.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This soup is delicious! I easliy made it a vegetarian meal by subbing veggie broth and leaving out the chicken. This soup can be made into a very hearty meal by adding more vegetables than what the recipe calls for. Many alterations can be made.  I have been using spiral noodles in place of the potatoes.  I boil the carrots and noodles together until cooked, then add in the rest.  A can of whole kernal corn or even creamed corn taste great when mixed in with the soup! It is now a family favorite and I make enough to save for a quick lunch or dinner later in the week.

Refreshing and unique soup! The PB is subtle and the taste is really good. Next time, I too might add a dash of cayenne pepper for some kick but we all enjoyed it.  I esspecially loved seeing the faces of my family once lunch was done (and everyone had a second bowl) that there was PB in the soup! Would make again.

This is a delicious soup!  I did alter two things out of necessity. I only buy extra crunchy peanut butter, and I only had chili-spiced diced canned tomatoes. The crunchy peanut butter added bits of peanut and the spicy tomatoes added a nice kick. This is a definite keeper and one I'll be making again!

Great soup recipe!!!  Even my parents loved it....at first they didn't want it because of the peanut butter but they ate the whole bowl and asked for more.  A nice change from plain old chicken noodle soup.

Yum!  The peanut butter added a wonderful flavour, and my kids loved it.  My husband and I added a little hot sauce, which gave it a little spice.  Also, we added a sprinkling of chopped roasted peanuts.

This soup was good but not great. It seemed as though it was missing something so I added a little cayenne pepper and honey and it helped a bit.

Omg this soup was delicious. Even my 15 month old daughter scarfed it right up and had seconds. I had to substitute a sweet potato instead of regular potato just because it was what I had on hand. Next time I will add either some brown rice or whole wheat pasta to make it a little heartier...I have to admit that my hubby and I were both starving about 30 minutes later! I added a little sriracha to my bowl and it was awesome.

My goodness! This was delicious. Even better the second day! Also, it's best served VERY warm, but not too hot.

My whole family loves this soup.  I always add some Thai peanut sauce which gives it a little kick and an Asian flavor.

Wasn't sure I would like this but wanted to give it a try...trying to low carb or Paleo it and thought this soup would fit the bill.  I too was skeptical about the PB but I only added half the amount and tasted it while piping hot...I omitted potatoes and had no zucchini or broccoli and when it cooled down some it was very GOOD!  two of us ate at least half of this I froze the rest and took some to work next day and it was AMAZING!  Flavors must melt together more after sitting...thanks for a great soup recipe!

This is a change up to a regular chicken soup.  The peanut butter really adds a great body to the soup. It is great as is, but if you want to tweak it to your liking it can be even better.  To the original recipe I added 1/3 tsp. cayenne, 1 tbs. coriander, squeezed in 1/2 of a lemon, and topped each bowl with chopped basil leaves.  Gave it an African flare.

We REALLY liked this soup! My bf said it eats more like a STEW! HEARTY MEAL. I left out zucchini, but added cauliflower and mushrooms. I sauteed the onion, green pepper, celery, garlic, and 4 sliced mushrooms in 2Tbsp butter. When serving, I added a few dashes each of curry powder and ginger powder to bottom of each bowl.  Man, did those additions enhance an already GREAT recipe. Thanks, Annie!

This soup is delicious! It reminds me a bit of Thai flavoring with the peanut butter, if that can make it more palatable to the skeptic. It's flavorful, filling, and keeps very well. I like to pick my own veggies at random for a new experience every time. To be honest, it doesn't even need the chicken (though it does add a nice meaty element).

I didn't have the broccoli or the bell peppers, but I used a little more celery, potatoes, and zucchini. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written. I thought it was okay, but not really super special as far as vegetable and chicken soups go. The peanut butter did add an interesting new flavor to regular vegetable soup, and I really like vegetable soup anyway, but I wouldn't say that I "love" this soup or that it's the greatest thing ever. It's tasty and I'll make it again when I want comfort food.
One thing, I was almost overwhelmed by the peanut butter smell. My in-laws couldn't even tell it had peanut butter in it, either by taste or smell, and I know I have an unusually good sense of taste and smell, but something to be aware of if anyone else is sensitive to smells. Once I was eating it I was fine, but when cooking it and then heating it up the next day in the microwave, I wasn't sure I would eat it.

I think this is my new favorite chicken soup. It is AMAZING!!! The fresh parsley really makes it. The hubs and I like a hit of spice, but we never want to overdo it for the kids, so I added a little chili powder, and a little more salt and pepper. I served it over brown rice and the hubs and I added some sriracha to give it some more punch. I can't get enough!

Spicy! I have no idea why this soup came out spicy, but it was delicious!  My husband really liked it too and he HATES peanut butter.  Next time, I will make sure to dice the vegetables into smaller pieces.  This soup is a keeper!

I loved this!  Delicious as written.  I was in a hurry and forgot to put the broccoli in, but it was still great.    I would consider reducing the stock to 7 cups, to make it a little thicker.  I made this at work for lunch and everyone enjoyed it.

This soup is awesome. I had potatoes, carrots and cabbage that I wanted to make into a soup to freeze and found a few recipes with peanut butter in them. This seemed like the one I could adapt most easily to what I had in my pantry. The 8 cups of stock made at least 10 if not 12 cups of soup, half that I froze, half that's in the fridge, and a bowl I had immediately! I added in some red pepper flakes to give it just a teeny kick. Really good soup that I'll definitely make again.

This recipe is delicious. I appreciate that it calls for no noodles or any other carbs. You could almost use any combination of vegetables, but the 1/2 c. of peanut butter is essential. It's makes the soup.

I looked at this recipe title and though it would be a little strange, but thought my kids would get a kick out of it.  It is FANTASTIC.  I made it to spec and we really liked it.  You don't think "peanut butter" when you eat it.   A guest teen went home and told his mom it was the best soup he had ever had.

This was fun to serve!  I was excited to see who would be the first to name the "mystery" ingredient. 
6 adults at the table.  4 liked it, 1 did not, and grandma ~  She flat out hated it and said I ruined a perfectly good vegetable soup by adding whatever it was I added.  I would make this again, but in a half batch.  It reminded me of Thai food and I wished I had some chili flakes to sprinkle on top.

Decent. Next time I will use a bit less peanut butter, as it dominated the soup. It also took much longer than specified to get the vegetables soft.

One of the best soups I have ever made.  The peanut butter just gave it a good kick, and I added 1/4 to a 1/2 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce. (I just use the shake and taste method so I can't be any clearer than approximately!  I am thinking how good yams would be added to the veggie roster.

If you are skeptical you should try it. My husband made it without any chicken, it was delicious.  With the leftovers we added chickpeas and curry.  It was delicious.  It does smell peanuty, but the taste is different. I loved it.

The combination of vegetables was really hearty with no one vegetable standing out and being overpowering.  I did enjoy the taste of the soup very much, but the one thing that bugged me was the light brown color of the liquid.  It was ok to eat it the day of, but I found myself not wanting to eat the leftovers, even though I did think it was tasty enough.

healthy soup, but written as is this recipe is too bland and definitely needs more seasonings.  I am not a fan of curry normally, but I thought that it would be good in here. Not my favorite chicken soup, okay, but I will try others before making this again.

I liked this soup, but didn't really think the peanut butter added anything extra to it.  After making this I decided I liked a chicken taste better than the peanut taste but still enjoyed it.

Peanut butter makes great cookies, fabulous cake, and awesome sandwiches - but it just plain confuses chicken and vegetable soup.  I prefer the earthy delight of high quality broth and herbs - I can see no reason to sacrifice the natural goodness of chicken soup with peanut butter.  It didn't really taste bad, it just didn't make sense to our taste buds.

I had my doubts, even with all the good reviews, but this IS very good soup, and my husband and I both liked it a lot. My husband didn't mention the peanut butter (and he loves pb) until I told him and he said "Oh, I knew something was different"... the pb doesn't stand out, it just gives the soup a little something different. Since I didn't have broccoli or zucchini on hand, I used 2 cups of frozen mixed vegs instead.

The broth is delicious. My husband loved this and ate two bowls. My teenage sons who can be picky also enjoyed it. A nice change to try for something different in soup. It's a keeper.

Great soup. I made the following additions/substitutions to make it more "Thai":
1. Used coconut milk for half the chicken broth
2. Put in two small Thai chille peppers cut in half and removed before serving
3. Added a couple pinches (to taste) of chille powder

I made a few changes: While boiling the potatoes seperate, i sauted the other veggies in a little oil, then added pre-cooked chicken. I add the potatoes, and a bag of frozen california blend of veggies. I added two tbsp good curry powder, and a few pinches of red pepper flake. Then i added the stock, brought it up to a simmer then added the peanut butter. Wonderful recipe idea! Never would have thought about throwing PB into the soup!!

I made this recipe as written, minus the broccoli.  Pretty good, but needed more spice.  Then I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added corn, okra, rice, cayenne, and coriander.  Amazing results!!

My husband loved this and he is a picky eater. I modified with what I had on hand- used red and yellow bell peppers instead of green peppers and broccoli. Also used a can of italian diced tomatoes and a tad more garlic and it all turned out great. I will definitely make it again.

I made everyone taste it before I revealed the "secret" ingredient.  No one knew what it was and were all blown away when they found out it was peanut butter!  I thought the zucchini didn't hold up as well as the other vegetables, so I add them in later, about 4 min. into simmer.  I also used crunchy peanut butter to give it a unique texture.  I've made this soup several times now and change up the veggies and sometimes leave the chicken out.  Even vegetable stock works with this great recipe - just don't forget the peanut butter!

I felt like this was just ok.  I liked the massive amount of veggies that were used.  The flavor just wasn't my favorite.  I would actually add MORE peanut butter next time.  Like 1 cup+

Used all natural peanut butter (without added sugar), doubled the chicken because I wanted to use it up.  It was good - the kids ate it. But everyone agreed that we couldn't actually taste the peanut butter and it just tasted like regular chicken noodle soup.  Was fine, nothing particularly unusual.

i could see how some people would enjoy this interesting combination of flavors. i appreciated the complexity but my family did not. my 4-year-old said, "i guess i thought you should know that nuts should not go in soup." my husband said it tasted a bit sour.

SOO Good! I made my own version though. I eliminated the celery and green pepper and added a can of corn and black beans as well as one jalapeno to add a little more zing. I only added a little bit of broccoli because I didn't want the taste to be overpowering, and the turnout was amazing!! It's a def must try.

Good, but not my favorite - hubby liked it a lot and has already requested again.  I think I might like it more if I used cauliflower and potatoes for the veggies.

This soup was great! I told my husband (after he said he really liked it), that there was peanut butter in it. He said he couldn't even taste it, and that if he could he probably wouldn't have liked the soup. It just adds a nice flavor. My kids all liked it as well. After we were done eating they all said "This is a make again Mom!"

The flavor was ok.  I am still not sure if I like it enough to keep trying.  The main problem I have with this is that even though I follow the recipe to the letter, my soup always ends up gritty after I add the peanut butter!  I've used 3 different brands of peanut butter and all 3 times the peanut butter never seems to blend in all the way and it separates, giving the soup a slight grittiness to the broth.  I'd say the flavor is ok if I could just get past the texture.

Great soup, I had the idea to make this a Thai soup so I swapped out veggies for diced red pepper, sliced snow peas, sliced bok choy and bamboo shoots, I also simmered stock with fresh ginger and lemongrass- when adding peanut butter add a tablespoon of red curry paste and a pinch of cayenne, I added 2 cups of cooked jasmine rice at the end- fantastic!

My new favorite recipe!  I have begun referring to this as "Everything" soup, because I use it to clean out the fridge and cabinets.  The peanut butter ties everything together and makes it creamy and delicious.  My latest version, I used tofu instead of chicken, rice instead of potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, can of green beans, can of diced tomatoes, can of water chestnuts, can of bamboo shoots, and collard greens.  The rice soaked up a lot of the water but I just popped it into the fridge/freezer that way and I add extra water before I reheat it.  Lunch for two weeks!

I love this soup! i have made it several times now and have made changes each time. I've got it on the stove now... this time I omitted the chicken and potatoes and added tofu and basil to give it a more thai feel. It's wonderful, the peanut butter really gives it a unique flavor. Thanks to whomever created this!

Delicious!  Took the advice of a previous reviewer and sauted the veggies first to release the flavors.  Also added mushrooms and used a can diced tomatoes w/ peppers instead of whole tomatoes.  This soup had so much flavor.  Even my husband who usually adds pepper and/or hot sauce to everything thought it was perfect as made.

This recipe looked interesting and tasted pretty good. Nobody in the family could guess the secret ingrediant of P.B. I pretty much followed the recipe, I did saute the onions, celery, garlic first and used a whole can of tomatoes. I added everything into my crock pot and cooked on high for 1 hr., then low for 3. I did taste it, and it was a bit bland for my taste, so I did add in extra seasonings, of basil, Lawrys seasoned salt, Seasoned Pepper and a few shakes of Tony Chachere's. Was awesome with the extra Jazz.

Made this for dinner tonight. It is fabulous. I really did not think I was going to like but we love it. The PB makes the soup richer and more velvety. I did not have broccoli, also I used cauliflower. Everything else I kept the same.

We loved this!  The peanut butter flavor is very subtle, and the average person would never know it was there unless you were told; in fact, I offered a cash prize to my kids if they could guess the "secret ingredient," and they tried so hard, but couldn't do it!  My husband's comment was that the PB disguised the flavor of the veggies (he hates them) and that it was the best chicken soup he'd had.  The only change I made was to add egg noodles at the end of cooking, and I think next time I will omit the potatoes, because no soup needs both pasta and potato.  Enjoy!

This was so good! Smells good, too. I skipped out on the potatoes and celery (didn't have). I think this is best w/ all natural peanut butter, with no added sugar. All kids loved it. I used dried parsley and basil. Red bell pepper made it very pretty. Added some cooked brown rice to bowls. Thank you!

One word...AWESOME!  Even my picky eater ate it all. Instead of chicken I used TURKEY leftovers.

This replaces my 30 year old favorite!  I made a few modifications to please our individual taste - replaced the potatoes with al dante elbow mac and added it after the carrots cooked.  I increased the chicken to 4 cups, left out the zucchini and broccoli and thickened the soup with corn starch (we like a thick texture).  Served with home made baking powder biscuits for dinner on a chilly evening.  Yum!

Wow! I am just getting over strep throat and came on this site looking for an easy-to-make soup to soothe my throat a bit and I ended up finding an amazing recipe!   I happened to have all of these vegetables in my fridge, so I figured, why not try it? I added salt and pepper prior to adding the peanut butter and thought that it was good as it was, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided I should add the peanut butter anyway. The soup does smell a bit of peanuts, but it doesn't taste very peanut-y at all. The result was simply amazing! I will make this soup over and over again! Thank you so much!

I made this soup over the weekend.  My husband was wary as he couldn't imagine peanutbutter in soup.  It was wonderful, but even better the next day.  Such a deep rich flavor, but not peanutbuttery (is that a word?)  I will confess that I forgot the tomatoes but really didn't miss them in the finished product.  Will make this soup again and again.   Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this was very good, and it definitely sounded different. I did leave out the broccoli (try as I might, I just don't like it). However, great way to get your veggies- this soup is packed with them! I always bake my chicken breast wrapped in foil and sprinkled with salt, pepper, and sometimes a little poultry seasoning for about 35-40 mins on 350. Then I cool and chop- I've found that I can do this at the beginning of the week and use it for everything that calls for cooked chopped chicken. Anyway, thanks for sharing! We enjoyed this!

This recipe is a keeper! Like most folks, I was a little apprehensive about the final addition of peanut butter to the soup, but it turned out to be delicious. PB adds richness and depth to the broth. Better the next day, and I ended up adding a little extra low sodium chicken broth and a few more veggies... a potato, carrot and a little broccoli, and of course lots of freshly ground pepper. Thanks for the recipe!

This is incredible!!!  Instead of broccoli flowerets, I used bagged broccoli slaw.  I also used bagged shredded carrots.  I used natural creamy peanut butter.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and 1/2 t. of cayenne pepper.  At the end of cooking time, I also added 1 can of light coconut milk.  SOOOOOO good!!!

I sauteed the chicken in garlic, olive oil, and a touch of red pepper. I put that to the side and sauteed the onion, celery, and remaining garlic until soft. Then I added everything else according to the original recipe. The peanut butter was weird, but it ended up tasting really good! I will make this again because it is a really healthy, hearty, and tasty soup!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe after the rave reviews. Unfortunately this was the worst soup ever. The peanut butter ruined the taste totally. It definitely gives it a unique flavor but it isn't good at all. I ended up throwing it out. I wouldn't tell anyone they shouldn't try it because everyone has different tastes but it just wasn't for me. Thanks anyway.

I made this tonight and my husband and I both loved it. I didn't have zucchini so I used brussels sprouts in it's place. I also added cilantro, cayenne and a little cumin and lemon juice. It was very yummy and I will be making it again! I plan on trying it without the chicken during Lent, I may sub tofu instead.

I give this a 3 because I THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME!!! Everyone else that I served dinner to that night did not like it. AT ALL. Seriously. They all hated it.   I ended up making grilled chese sandwiches for us all later because everyone was still hungry.  I, however, thought it was delish!!! I can't think of anything I could have changed to make it better for my guests. I think they all just really didn't like the peanut butter taste. I never told them what it was, the secret ingredient, but they all hated it. They said it had a "burnt" taste and I assure you I did not burn this soup.  Anyway... Personally I would give this a 4 or 5..... I loved it. But, when 5 other people all hated it.... I guess I have to take that into consideration when I give the recipe a score.  So 3 it is. Sorry to the orignal poster. I loved it.

OMG this was a surprise - it was incredibly delish!!!! And we know our soups, we do a soup nite one nite a week, have been for about 9 years since Tues nites were usually a kid activity night. This was simple to make - although I did the prep (except the potatoes) the night before. Next time I might add just a squeeze of lime juice and some chopped cilantro to give it a thai twist.

This was ok. Not as great as I expected after reading other reviews. Left over, the veggies began to taste like peanut butter. Next time I will use half the peanut butter and less veggies.

Everyone loved this soup. Someone commented that it had an "Asian" taste which I think was due to the peanut butter. Next time I might put a little less peanut butter, but we loved this recipe.

I wasn't sure what to make of the addition of peanut butter to chicken soup when I first read this recipe; but I was so intrigued I had to try it. And boy am I glad I did. The peanut butter does magical things to the flavors in this soup. And it also gives it a smooth velvety texture. Wonderful recipe.

This is a very hearty soup; I love all the vegetables.  I thought it needed some spicing up though.  I added cumin, thyme, and a little cayenne pepper. I'll make it again; it was a big hit with my family.

Delicious! This recipe was so very good. I hate when people rate recipes 5 stars after they adjust so much that really they are posting a new recipe. I made this recipe exactly as given and thought it was fantastic. True you could add different veggies or add more spice here and there. But, I found this recipe to be a comforting, delicious soup just as is was. Some of my family added more salt to their own bowls or added hot sauce as they like to do, but overall it was thoroughly enjoyed just as is. Thank you! It really hit the spot on this cold November evening.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I never and I mean NEVER cook and this turned out GREAT!! I give it a four because my husband (who does cook and has a much better taste for things) gave it a 6 out of 10. I had to substitue some veggies and still loved it. I ate it with corn muffins as suggested by another person and it went very well with this.

I wasn't quite sure about this recipe so I made a 2 serving batch first.  I would give this 5 stars if peanut butter was less fattening.  I followed this recipe using the fast chicken soup base made from the rotissery chicken.  I didn't have some of the vegetables but I don't think it matters.  I really liked it and would not hesitate adding peanut butter to a chicken soup again except that the grams of fat is very high.  If the fat content isn't an issue with you, give this a try.  The peanut butter thickened the broth up just enough and I don't think I would have guessed there was peanut butter in the recipe if I had been served this soup by someone else.

I hesitated when I saw this recipe.  Then I came back. I have a pot simmering on the stove now. I tasted it and my husband is eating a bowl now and I have to say it is DELICIOUS. The peanut butter gives the soup the faintest nuttiest taste. It needs the slightest shake of salt and pepper to make it perfect. I will definitely make this again.

This is great! The whole family loved it--even knowing there was peanut butter in it. (Though I told them after.) Like other reviewers, I worked with the veggies I had on hand, which makes this really versatile.  The peanut butter is definitely the star ingredient. I'll definitely use this again! Thank you.

This was really tasty and unexpected. The addition of peanut butter provided a really interesting flavour, and also made the soup feel heartier. Great twist on a basic recipe.

I seriously thought I'd like this, since I love Thai food, anything peanut butter. This was really strange, and I SO regret adding the P.B. I'm not a picky eater, either.   I think this is a love/hate type of thing. You'll either love it, or you'll hate it.

This is very much like a soup I make for myself.  

I got the idea of adding peanut butter to chicken soup, because as a child I loved dunking peanut butter sandwiches into my soup.  

I even do the same with my "doctored up" chicken ramen, adding vegetables, any meat or shrimp that needs to be used up, some fresh bean sprouts, and a few good dashes of a hot sauce.  If I'm feeling in a Thai mood, I'll add some fresh lime juice, too!

Just some thoughts for everyone who likes to "wing it" with recipes.

I have to say this is the best soup ever! My wife made it first, years ago. I crave it a few times a year increasingly. I made it myself this time cause I could not wait for her.I had to have it now!

This is now a repeat in my menu planning. Everyone loves it exactly as written. I am going to try adding some spice to it to enhance a Thai sort of flavor that this soup suggests.

Excellent for something a little different - I didn't use green pepper but added cut up green beans. I added some chopped jalapeno for heat with some Spice Island Thai seasoning and that really brought it to life - I agree may have been bland without the seasoning, but with it was really wonderful - will make again.

This soup was awesome!! i was kind of scared at first about putting peanut butter in, but it gives it just enough flavor and is not too overwhelming. definitely a great twist if you're tired of the same old chicken/vegetable soups!! it takes a little longer to prepare due to cutting up all the vegetables if you buy everything fresh, but it is worth the time if you have it!

AMAZING! Super easy and so flavorful!  I added an extra clove of garlic and 1/2 cup of yellow squash. I used canned tomatoes with green chilis, and omitted the green peppers and potatoes (because I didn't have them).  The peanut butter really did something magical and I have been raving about it to everyone since I made it 3 nights ago! I will definitley make again!

Very good soup.  Giving it a 4 star because you do have to add more spices then calling for to give it flavor.  But after that my family loved it!

I have recently discovered this wonderful web site and I have tried a few of the recipes. This recipe is wonderful! My 10 year old daughter turns her nose up at just about anything I make. She gobbled it down and said it was the best thing she ever had. I did make a couple of changes, I started with ground turkey instead of cubed chicken and I added pearl barley instead of potatoes. My husband and I like a little fire so we added chili pepper flakes - Delicious!

This soup was absolutely the best chicken soup I have ever eaten. The peanut butter adds a layer of flavor which you can't discern as peanut butter at first. It compliments the chicken broth and vegetables wonderfully! I substituted a few of the vegetables with a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables for time saving, and I also did this in the slow cooker, starting with raw chicken rather than cooked. I am going to make some more today! Take the risk, your whole family will love it! ENJOY!

This is delicious! When I was making it I was doubtful as to how flavorful it would be, but if you add the right amount of salt and pepper (and in my case a pinch of ground cumin), it's really very good. I will definitely make this again soon!

I thought this was really bland.  My husband really liked it.  After tasting, I added a lot of salt, a little basil, extra garlic powder and extra black pepper trying to give it a little more flavor, but it was still too bland.  If I ever make this again, I will add a little curry.

I'm eating this as I review it. It's delicious. I did use the veggies I had on hand (yellow squash, carrots, sweet potatoes, onion). I think the sweet potato is more "ethnic" and I like it better in the recipe than white potatoes. I also added a dash of cayenne and a big handful of fresh cilantro at the end. I will make this often.

Thanks for the recipe.  My husband loved it as well as the kids.  The hubby said he could it this 2-3 times a week.  WOW!  I only omitted the peppers and zucchini b/c I didn't have them on hand.  I will next time!  Thanks again.  Great recipe.

I followed the recipe nearly exactly, except I forgot to add the broccoli and I used red bell pepper instead of green.  It was just OK.  I felt like it was lacking in "something" but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I did put a dash of cayenne but it didn't do much for this soup.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't live up to the hype from these reviews.

My family thought I was crazy to want to try a soup with "peanut butter" in it. However I recieved a lot of apologies as everyone kept helping themselves to more servings. The peanut butter gives this recipe a great and unique flavor! I recommend trying this one!!

Very good.  Everyone goes back for seconds and thirds.  I added the corn, rice and coriander.  I didn't have any zucchini, broccoli, or okra but did have some frozen lima beans! So I used those instead.  We sprinkled golden raisins on top.

I love this soup!!!I followed recommendation of not letting family members know about the peanut butter. Everyone thought it was really good. You would not guess that there is peanut butter in it. Not by  taste or smell. I added okra, egg noodles and lots of garlic. Thanks for the recipe, I will make it again.

This soup is delicious! I usually use the natural peanut butter, but used Simply Jif and it tasted great! I also added a frozen bag of veg-all to stretch the servings...will definitely make again! It's delicious!

This soup was good, but not a 5 in our opinion.  I think it could use extra garlic, which is what I plan to try next time.  We will definitely have it again and tweak it to our liking.  I also used non sugary peanut butter (not a jif type), which probably made a difference in the taste.

Mmm.  This was good.  I felt like I was at a circus, carnival or somewhere cool like Africa with the smell of the soup.  I boiled a chicken and removed the meat. I then cooked the soup with the bone(s) intact to enrich flavor.  I added to the recipe dried potato slivers from a box along with some dried onion flakes in place of onions.  I also didn't use zuch. or much celery.  My grandmother really liked it.

OMG. This is SO GOOD!  My fiance's dad makes a vegetable peanut butter soup that's pretty good, but this tops it as it's not nearly as thick.  We didn't have peppers, and had to add half beef stock and half chicken stock, as that's what was on-hand.  It still came out GREAT!!  We added a bit more peanut butter too.

My review will be just as mixed as the 75 before it.  I loved this recipe (after modifications below), but my husband even with the modifications thought it was bland and didn't even finish a bowl.  We both love asian flare and peanut butter so I had high hopes, but alas I am stuck eating a massive amount of soup on my own.  I took advice mentioned before and added Chinese Five Spice, Cayene, Crushed red pepper, and I accentuated the thai connnection by adding a can of coconut milk and some honey.  I added the honey because I used all natural peanut butter that does not have any sugar (I don't eat sugar) and it needed some sweet to balance the richness of the peanut butter and the spices.  Hmm...it really tastes like an exotic soup, nice on a cold rainy day.

This was good - my husband liked it quite a bit but I only liked it so-so. I probably won't make it again. It wasn't bad, but I have other soup recipes I like better. It's worth a try, however, in case everyone in your family loves it. If it were up to my husband he'd definitely make it again.

Do not be dismayed by the strong peanut butter smell of rather ugly appearance of this soup as you are cooking it.  It comes out tasting very good, and only slightly nutty.  I left out the potatoes, carrots, and celery and just added more of the other veggies to compensate.

YUM!!!!  While the soup was cooking it smelled strongly like peanut butter so I wasn't sure if I would like it or not.  But once I tried it, it was absolutely DELICIOUS.  Agree with the other reviewers that the peanut butter adds that something "extra" that just makes it.  I followed the recipe exactly except used roasted garlic that I had on hand.....was afraid it would mellow the garlic taste too much so I used 4 cloves instead of 2.  Also used pre-cubed cooked Tyson chicken breast which made it much easier.  Give it a try!

I found this soup boring, with an unpleasant texture, smell and taste. I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed, especially after reading everyone's raving reviews.

I was sooo apprehensive about this, but it was tasty and easy! I had a lactose-intolerant guest this weekend, and this was a hit, being a creamy soup without any diary. I might even add curry next time for fun. Good stuff.

Different and good.  You could use any kind of veggies you have on hand.  I don't like zucchini so I added roasted edamame.  Yum!

This is a great recipe and my kids even gobbled it up.  I used vegetables that I had on hand and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of evaporated milk to make it a little creamier. I used chopped stewed tomatoes with spices and that certainly added some extra flavor.  It was still a little bland, so I threw in a dash of the following spices:   cumin, garam masala, tumeric, ginger, and curry.

CROWD PLEASER!  The first time I made it I used leg quarters.  That was MUCH better than the second time I made it using boneless breasts.  The natural gelatin from the bones makes a thicker and more flavorful broth.  Natural peanut butter is best, also.

I hesitated to put PB in the whole recipe so I took some soup out,just in case, only to put it back in and add the full amount of PB!  This is a delicious soup.  My dtr is on the specific carbohydrate diet and minus the potatoes it is perfect for her.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really wanted to like this, but it just wasn't very good.  I may try peanut butter in a bean soup sometime, but I won't try it in a chicken soup again.  It was edible, but not a keeper.

A good hearty soup with an almost exotic taste.  I used vegetables I like instead of what the recipe called for.  Mushrooms,corn,beans and carrots.  My huband and I ate the whole batch in 2 sittings.

YES this is good.  Maybe throw in a can of drained garbanzo beans for extra protein.  I used canned Swanson broth, frozen parsley, red bell peppers, garlic from a jar, and canned chicken, even Jif (obviously what I had on hand) and it still turned out great.  Jif might have made it more sweet than other brands.  Serve with salad or sandwiches for a light meal.

I didn't know if I'd like both peanut butter and chicken in a soup but I was pleasantly surprised.  I had rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  Used natural peanut butter because I don't poison my family with trans fat.

My children loved it.  My bf said it was surprisingly good, given it contained so many foods such as carrots and tomatoes that he doesn't like.  The PB gives a wonderful flavor and aroma.  I may continue to play with the veggies, adding whatever's convenient, but the chicken broth/peanut butter combination is definitely going to have a place in our dinner repetoire.

I don't know who thought of putting peanut butter in this soup, but thank goodness they did!  Although its not the BEST soup I've ever had, its close.  Its definately the best chicken and/or vegetable soup I've had.  Perfect for cold winter days or under-the-weather-friends.  I hope it freezes well!

I loved all the vegetables and it had a very unique taste.  Although this is not a recipe I make often, it's nice to make every now and then.  I like to add a handful of egg noodles to make it more of a chicken and noodles type soup.

I  used the ingredients I had.  I  used frozen vegetables.   Broccoli , cauliflower, carrots, squash, onions and garlic. Used a small can of tomato paste and a handful of fresh tomatoes.  Added ground ginger, curry powder to the recipe. Used the Mediterranean chicken skewers from Costco as the chicken.  It took a lot longer to cook those vegetables and get them soft but it was worth the wait. It was delicious

I often have leftover chicken and so thought this was a great find! I had all the ingredients on hand. I used half Campbell's chicken broth and half Campbell's Thai Pho chicken broth. I also added some fresh beans from our garden. We had it tonight and will definitely make it again!

This was good but I couldn’t tell the difference from other similar recipes. Not sure what the peanut butter does and I couldn’t taste it. Maybe I didn’t add enough?

I made this recipe but I pretty much doubled all the vegetable ingredients. For the 8 cups of broth, it was too watery for my taste. Other than that I followed the recipe as stated. My thanks to the original poster, for it was delicious!

My husband and I love this soup. The only change I’ve made was to omit the zucchini. Have made it at least 3 times and will make it again and again. It’s a real keeper!

Really great soup!  I only had celery, tomatoes, and onions for the veggies but it turned into a tasty meal.  The peanut butter flavor is obvious without being overwhelming.  Thank you - I will definitely make this again.

It was OK, but as others stated, rather lacking in terms of flavour. We normally do not eat spicy foods or anything, which some reviewers suggested as an explanation for the complaint of lacking flavour. That's not applicable to us. We had expected the peanut butter to add more zing. 

My husband and I would rate this 5/10, but since 2 stars is too low I'm going with 3. That said, we will not make this again.

My boyfriend wouldn't let me add peanut butter! But it was excellent without it!! My picky toddler even ate it! Super easy to make! The only difference (besides PB) was that I used a little bit of oil first, added the garlic, S&P, then the broth :)

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes.  I  like my soup more stew-like so I  double whatever veges I have on hand.  Also,  I add a whole jalapeno pepper (whole - not diced) while cooking.  and as it sits in the refrigerator.  The pepper adds a hint of heat (which is all my husband can stand) .

This is my very first review, and I have been a fan of all recipes for a few years. I rely on reviews so I wanted to share mine for this recipe. Wow. So good. 
To be honest, I was a little skeptical of how the ingredients would go together, but they do, and it's magical. 
I did sauté the carrots, onion, celery, mushrooms (I added them) and garlic before hand, but followed the recipe from there.
My kids (4 and 2) each had seconds, and my hubby ate 4 bowls - over the course of a few hours, but still! My only negitive thing to say is that there are no leftovers. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I added some Thai red curry powder and a little brown sugar and called it "thai curry soup"....family loved it!  Good way to get a low carb meal in and plenty of veggies.  Anything that would go in a Thai curry (which is to say, any veggie or meat) would work in this.  Made a double batch and am freezing a bunch of it.

Very nice soup.  The peanut butter added an interesting dimension and the entire family really enjoyed it.  They couldn't figure out what was giving them that unusual flavor, so I had to tell them about the peanut butter.  They thought that was an interesting ingredient.   This is one of those keeper recipes that you make once or twice a year just to enjoy the unusual, yet good, flavor profile of this soup.  

Thanks you,
Kitchenguy

This soup is delicious!! I did saute my onions, garlic, celery, bell pepper, and carrots before I added them to the soup (I always do) and added a larger portion of veggies because that's what I like, but I didn't change any of the ingredients and the flavor of the soup was so good I didn't want to stop eating it. This will be a regular in our house. Thanks for this delicious recipe.

Since we like spicy I added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the soup and at the end of cooking time a  tablespoon of fresh thai basil.  I also used crunchy peanut butter am loved the texture it added to the dish.  Terrific recipe and wonderful way to sneak lots of veggies into a meal.

This soup is fantastic!  The flavor from the peanut butter is not extremely noticeable but is just enough to make the soup something special.  My family really enjoyed it and said it was definitely one I should make again.  I did use a can of Rotel instead of canned whole tomatoes.

Very good! A couple years ago I made a "West African Peanut Soup" that was similar to this, except there was coconut milk in it-- this was much better!! I skipped the green peppers, broccoli and zucchini and added a can of white beans, fresh spinach, cilantro and a frozen mix of vegetable which included rice and barley.

So incredibly delicious! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added the peanut butter to a small amount of broth in a small saucepan, then added the peanut butter broth to the whole pot of soup. Great with yellow squash and kale, too! Just add kale closer to the end, and it turns a lovely green color as it cooks.

Absolutely loved this soup. As per other reviewers, I saluted the onions, celery and garlic before adding the stock and vegetables. I used leftover rotisserie chicken from the supermarket. I also added some red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. Served it with Naan made from the recipe on this site. Really delicious, I will be making it again!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I can see how people see it's missing something. The peanut butter kind of muted flavors a bit. A bit of soy sauce maybe? Some curry would probably be a great addition to give it some depth of flavor. However, it is a solid soup as is and I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!! :)

I made this into more of a 5 minute stew where I just less liquid. I actually boiled chicken and reserved some of the liquid to make it. I also used PB2 to reduce the calories. I only used about 2 tablespoons and it was perfect. I also added lots of garlic powder and used fresh peppers, potatoes, zucchini and onion and then added frozen mixed veggies as well.  I am not a big meat person so I can see next time trying tofu or no meat at all.

I was searching for recipes to use up canned goods since we are moving and I found this. I had to majorly improvise on some things, such as tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, and I had to use chicken flavor bouillon cubes to make stock instead of real chicken stock, so I was not expecting much. I had to use yellow pepper instead of green and didn't have any zucchini, and used canned carrots, potatoes, and chicken. I was SO not expecting much but my whole family loved it!! Everyone had seconds or thirds, including my picky two-year-old!! She literally licked her bowl!! I actually added extra peanut butter because we love peanut butter, but everything else was unintentional. This is a perfect recipe to add whatever vegetables you have on hand, even canned, and it will turn out really well. I would highly recommend it!

I make all kinds of soup all winter but this is definitely one of the best!! My husband (who complains when I sometimes make heartier soups for dinner) loved this one - even for dinner.

This is great.  It's delicious, packed with healthy stuff, not too expensive to make, and easy to make.  It's mostly a lot of cutting/chopping/mincing.  I substituted 2 tsp of curry powder for the black pepper, and it was perfect.  Flavorful and delicious.  You could add some red or cayenne pepper to my version if you like a little more kick.

This was good and unique, but not my favorite.  I admit I did choose the wrong potatoes (gold rather than russet) so they did disintegrate into the soup, plus I added veggie pasta which took longer to cook than I intended.  Good veggie option, but not my favorite soup.

While I probably won't make this again, I did enjoy it just because it was very different. I omitted the zucchini because I didn't have any, and if I were to make this again, I would omit the broccoli because of the strong flavor. I would just add more carrots and potatoes, possibly adding green peas as well. My husband, who really loves peanut butter, had no idea it was in the soup. I tasted it before and after the addition of the peanut butter, and it really does give it the unusual, interesting flavor.

This is fantastic - I change it around depending on what veggies I have. Tonight I used leftover rotisserie chicken, a broccoli, cauliflower, orange and yellow carrot mix with some green beans thrown in for good measure. The peanut butter adds a wonderful richness and I like the texture you get with crunchy peanut butter rather than creamy. I have yet to serve this to someone and have them not tell me they love it!

I made this soup last night.  My husband, who rarely has accolades for anything he eats, said it was "supurb" and stated that this was "probably the best soup" I've ever made.  I wasn't sure if I should feel complimented or insulted!  I made it as written except for omitting green peppers (hate 'em) and adding a cup of frozen corn instead.  The corn was a GREAT addition and next time (and yes, there will definitely be a next time!) I'll add even more and I'll probably omit the potatoes because  they just seemed out of place and mushy..  This really was delicious!!!

I love chicken soup, and I had high hopes for this recipe because I wanted to shake things up a bit from my usual soup. I did not care for the peanut butter addition. This isn't a matter of not liking peanut butter (I probably love PB a little too much, if you know what I mean--I'd be happy to sit with a jar of PB and a spoon!). I just didn't like the flavor it added to the soup. I know many reviewers say it's not noticeable, but it was to me (actually, why add it in the first place if it's not noticeable?), and I didn't like it with the other ingredients.

I loved this soup and strangely the "I'm not touching a vegetable EVER" 16 year old boy liked it too.  I followed it exactly as written except I didn't use green pepper as it makes me sick.  Mine probably needed 1 1/2 tsp of salt but I used homemade chicken stock from my dog's chicken so not much salt in it.  Both kids said we should put it in the rotation. Next time I would use crushed tomatoes instead of whole since they were hard to break up!  I also might swap some sweet potatoes for the regular potatoes.  Great recipe!

So delicious!  I must admit, I was really worried about it after I added the peanut butter.  I was very close to telling the fam I made a horrible mistake and to check the fridge for cold pizza.  I've made other dishes with peanut butter - but this looked really scary.  I did add some red pepper flakes as we like things spicy.  And I added some cooked noodles to the bottom of our bowls before adding the soup for more heartiness.  This is a keeper.  I'll experiment with the vegetables next time.

So awesome! My husband is experienced head chef and cooking for him is a bit intimidating. He absolutely LOVED this soup. At first when he heard about ingredients, he was skeptical but the result surprised him in a good way! Thank you very much for the recipe. This one is a keeper.

Wonderful!  The best way to do this is definitely to boil a half chicken with skin on with a couple of carrots, celery, peppercorn, bayleaves for about an hour.  Allow to cool and remove the skin and bones - use this as the cooked chicken.  Use the stock from veggies & boiled chicken as your 8 cups and finish off with canned broth.  I added tabasco at the end because I like a little kick to my soup.  Such a wonderfully savory soup - my four year old threw a fit because he didn't want to eat dinner but couldn't help eating it all which means it's a winner in my house!

We loved this soup!  I only gave it 4 stars because as written it was a little bland.  By bland I do not mean not spicy - it just needed something a little more.  I added some fish sauce, lime juice and a little green curry paste - not enough to make it hot at all.  I really wished I had some coconut milk when I made it as I think that would also be a great addition.  
The peanut butter gave the whole thing a really delicate taste.  As other reviewers, I also just added veggies according to what I had on hand.  YUMMY and I made a HUGE pot, there is only 2 of us, so I have 2 big containers in the freezer!

Delish!  Really good flavor.  I chopped up the veggies really small so the kids couldn't really discern much of what was in there.  Topped with chopped peanuts which the kids thought this was the best part -- it really added a nice crunch.

Delicious.  I made it with white mushrooms, bell peppers, celery, canned tomatoes, and broccoli.  And I adjusted everything to medifast proportions for my diet.****Quick update, this was much better freshly made.  The reheated leftovers didn't taste as good as it did the first night.

Just make it! Best soup I've ever eaten, and a huge hit with my friends! I use the "Fast Chicken Soup Base" recipe from Pam Anderson, and I love trying it with different vegetables, especially kale. After I served this to my friends a couple of times, they started adding peanut butter to other soups I made. 

To cut the sugar, I used 1/2 regular peanut butter, and 1/2 sugar-free and salt-free peanut butter from the grocery store (I set a tea strainer with peanut butter into the pot to prevent small pieces of peanut from getting into the soup). Definitely mix peanut butter into a separate pot with some broth first, then add to the whole pot of soup.

Really good soup!  I didn't have any broccoli in the house so I used cabbage instead.  Oh, and I left out the zucchini just because I don't care for it. Was very tasty!

This was an ok soup.  For some reason the peanut butter made the broth a little  gritty.  Don't know if I would make again.

Great base soup! I read other reviews before and always just add a ton of cumin, coriander, and cayenne on top of a half to a whole jalepeno or serrano pepper for flavor. I like to add a spoonful of peanut butter just before I eat it. I find it doesn't keep as well when you add the peanut butter in the large quantity. Also, I rarely remember the parsley. It really doesn't change the flavor that much. Overall, this soup rocks!

Don't hold out on the peanut butter!  That's the best part!  Do chunky peanut butter! Few changes I did (only because I didn't have it on hand): omitted broccoli, celery and just added 1 green onion.  I doubled up on most of the veggies and it still needed more!  (We like a lot of veggies in our soups!) It was still pretty good with the changes!

Skeptical, even after all the rave reviews, I decided to make this anyway. It is so good! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some cooked brown rice at the end - it didn't need it, I just had some leftover in the fridge and decided to throw it in. I will definitely be making this again!

This was great & the whole family loved it!  I added some red pepper flakes to compliment the peanut butter.  It reminded me of Thai flavors.  A great way to use up leftover chicken and veggies!

This is the first recipe I am reviewing.  It was that good.  I did saute the carrots, onions, celery and garlic in a bit of olive oil first and added some ginger too.  I also forgot the tomatoes. It was awesome.

Pretty good soup!  Unique and tasty.  I sauteed the harder veggies (carrots, onions, garlic, zucchini) before adding anything else.  I also tossed in frozen green beans and baby limas as well as a can of corn and a can of baby peas.  Forgot about the tomatoes.  Added frozen egg noodles for the last twenty minutes.  The peanut butter made the broth smooth and kind of thick.  The flavor was good.  I'd like to have others try it and gauge their reactions as well.

Fantastic.  (I used low fat PB and found no difference).  My family and friends loved it.  Can't tell its PB if you don't know.  Sauteed the onion and celery first for flavor.  Used frozen broccoli.

This really is one of the best soups I have tasted. I am still making baby steps in the kitchen (have relied on my wife's cooking all those years), so I tend to follow recipes to the letter, and learn along the way. Making this soup was very easy and outcome is AWESOME! Peanut butter is the winner for me. Never thought you could put it in a soup. I know I will be making this soup many times in the future. thank you so much!

I LOVE this, even though my family thinks that it's a "good but different" soup. I threw together the veggies we had in the freezer and added an extra 1/2 cup crushed tomato and shredded zucchini. The extra tomato was noticeable; the zucchini wasn't. As for the peanut butter, I would say not to go overboard. (I think I did when I added an extra generous tablespoon.) I sauteed the veggies, except for the carrots, as another user suggested and everything turned out great! I also didn't have broccoli but it's still yummy. Another good add-in would be cashews or peanuts... the crunch is really good!  NOTE: This is a great soup even  if you choose not to add the peanut butter... can't say which way I like more!

I made this for my family tonight.  We all liked it, but as others have said, it IS a little bland as it is.  It needs something for kick that the person making it likes.  Easy enough.  I added some roasted red pepper.  I also discovered that if you let it set with the burners off for 20-30 minutes, the flavors deepen and become better.  (I went back for a second serving.)  And from reading others comments, I added flour to thicken the broth and make it smoother. We'll have it again!

Oh, WOW!!! One of the top five soups I've ever had! Gave some to my co-worker and his family, and they ate it all and he didn't get any. :-) I teased them with the "secret ingredient" which is about to be revealed when I share the recipe with them. Makes a huge batch too! I subbed a jar of mild salsa in place of tomatoes, and omitted the celery (don't care for it, didn't miss it). Increased the garlic to about four cloves, and sauteed onions and garlic at the beginning. Thanks for an awesome recipe to add to my favorites!

Made it almost exactly according to directions; a light and very tasty soup. Could be a little spicier for our taste; will probably add red pepper next time. The peanut butter gives an interesting flavor; I'd be interested in making it w/o peanut butter to see how it compares. Also, I made some stir fry with the veggies I had left over. Next time I'll plan to do that in advance so I'll have TWO dishes from one effort!

I had really high hopes for this soup!  The taste was delicious and I had a couple of bowls full.  The texture was creamy and rich.  The problem I had came when I got sick about an hour after eating the soup.  I'm thinking it was simply too rich for my stomach, and I don't have a sensitive stomach.  I will not be making this again.

Delicious! I had a quart of broth I had made from roast chicken bones.  I used that, about a cup of chicken, a large carrot, a can of diced tomatoes, a stalk of celery, half a red onion that I had in the fridge, and about 1/4 of a lg. green pepper.  Didn't have zucchini or  broccoli, don't like potatoes in soup.  I didn't saute the veggies - was cooking in a rush - but cooked the soup quickly, refrigerated it, and heated it later with cooked  rice and a sweet potato I had microwaved until just done.  I added a dash of cayenne and a squirt of lemon; would have added a little fresh ginger too, but the jar I had in the fridge had to be tossed.  I used at least 1/4 cup peanut butter, maybe 1/3 cup.  Highly recommended!

Delicious soup!!! I like to try new recipes and am pretty daring but I was very hesitant about the peanut butter! But it really adds to the flavor of the soup and it doesn't taste like peanut butter at all! As other reviewers have said, just do it!! As other reviewers also said, I sauteed my onion, celery and garlic in some butter until soft before adding to the soup. I also added more chicken that the recipe called for because I like a meaty soup. I also used frozen vegetables instead of fresh, a bag of Italian Veg and a bag of California veg. Couldn't have been easier!!! I also added some sliced jalapenos for a little zip!!

Love it! I would add sweet potatoes next time ( i microwaved and added some in the next day).  Also, I doubled the recipe and didn't add enough garlic-will next time.   I added my own veggies, whatever on hand, and only added i can of tomatoes for a double recipe.  Good stuff!  Couldn't really tell I used crunch peanut butter.

We ALL loved this!  I too sauteed onion, celery/garlic in a little olive oil, added homemade broth, used broccoli, fresh frozen corn, SWEET POTATO (white and orange) and some ground ginger and ground lemon grass.  I think a touch of cinnamon would be good too.  The Peanut butter is a must!  Fear not!  A great soup to use up all your veggies in the frig.  Better the next day.  This is a keeper.

Really tasty recipe! I'm a university student, and I love it because of how easy and versatile it is. Just throw in whatever veggies are in the fridge. I made it pretty much exactly as written the first time, but the second time I doubled the chicken and the broccoli and reduced the peanut butter to half. I thought it was much better this way.

This soup is amazing.  We made it a couple of weeks ago, and thought it was quite good.  It wasn't until the second day that the flavours really melded together and it became an absolutely fabulous soup.   I'm making it again now, and am looking forward to dinner, especially dinner tomorrow!

This is a good basic soup, but needed brightening.  I added a generous dollop of pureed ginger (comes in a refrigerated tube)and chopped cilantro at the end.  This made it perfect!  Lemongrass might have worked as well as the ginger.

Would have given this a 4.5 if there were half stars!  I was nervous about the peanut butter also but went for it.  I'm so glad I did - it was surprisingly subtle and gave the broth a full flavor.  I poached the chicken using onion and garlic, used all chicken stock for broth and veggies I had on hand.  Next time I will increase the amount of chicken to make it even more packed with protein and add some red pepper to give it some heat.

I found this recipe years ago in Jane Brody's Good Food Cookbook. It is excellent and I have found the peanut butter can be decreased and any veggies you enjoy added.

I printed this recipe a few days ago but decided not to make it. Today I made my own homemade chicken soup with potatos and carrots from the garden. But then I tasted it and it seemed so boring. I just had a feeling my kids would not eat it. I figured I would add the peanut butter and see what happens. I was nervous. But it turned out great. Not only do my kids love it, but my picky neighbor kid is here and is actually eating it too. I can't wait to tell his mom. And as an added bonus, because the veggies were from the garden and I started with a whole chicken from teh store, the entire meal cost less than $5, and I have some leftover. You can't beat that.

I just finised making this for lunch and decided to review as soon as the kitchen was clean. This soup is wonderful.  Period.  I decided to not add chicken (having it for dinner tonight) and just increased with veggies I had, which was everything the recipe called for.  I did cook a little longer, and didn't have parsley, so I added cilantro.  Also, since "Fil" (father in law) likes my stir fry, I mimicked it and added 1/2 tsp of Chinese Five Spice - a must in my stir fry.  Served on a bed of soba noodles (wheat and buckwheat blend). Fil ate it all up, so I plan on freezing the remainder in individual portions so he can make soup for lunch during the week when we are at work. Thanks Annie for the great idea. **Update** Hubby just got home from work and hadn't eaten anything for lunch.  It was too early for dinner, so I told him to have some homemade soup.  I didn't tell him what it was, but with the addition of the Chinese Five Spice, he named it "Stir Fry Soup!".  He loved it.

Like the previous reviewer, this was opportunity for me to use bits and pieces of produce in a unique soup.  I like it!  I scaled the recipe down to 2 svgs and was able to create the recipe with the exception of brocolli cuz I didn't have any, but found some pieces of spinach leaves in the bag o' salad and they did just fine.  My zuchini was on its VERY last leg, but I was able to salvage about a 2-inch piece, perfect.  Had one small, old tomato...used that up too.  My chicken and broth was from the lemon and herb roasted chicken (this site) that I made yesterday.  I had boiled the carcass while I was working on other things in the kitchen, picked it clean, added a teaspoon of bouillon.  I feel like a created a free meal with using so many little tidbits.  Many people would have thrown away the produce scraps, but just trim off any icky parts, freeze little bits, set aside a tablespoon or two of onions next time you chop 'em, and you can put togther something like this in a snap.  Granted, it's only 2 servings but they are full bodied, nutritious, and very tasty.  It would easily make 4 appetizer servings, or 2 dinner servings like I did for me.  Give it a try!  Definitely worth it.

This was a nice and easy recipe, allowing me to use up leftover chicken and produce that was in the fridge.  I stuck to the recipe for the most part, but as I'm trying to steer clear of carbs; I opted for double the amount of zucchini in place of the potatoes, added a cup of sliced mushrooms, used two fresh tomatoes in place of canned, and used a can of Hatch green chile in place of the jalepeno.  All in all, I was pleased with this soup!

This soup is fantastic!  I grew up eating vegetable soup and we always dipped peanut butter sandwiches in the soup.  When I saw this recipe I thought, of course!  Peanut butter in the soup. I did add extra veggies, but other than that, I made the recipe as written and it is well worth 5 stars - even better than my Mom's vegetable soup.

I made this recipe by following the instructions exactly and my family hated it. It tastes awful and although I love peanut butter, I would never make this again. The soup was just fine before adding the peanut butter. Do yourself a favor and skip this recipe.

Delicious! Instead of adding to the soup later in the process, we started by browning our chicken and then sauteing the celery, garlic, onion and bell pepper over the brown bits. We also added 1 cup of coconut milk at the end.

The thing I loved about this recipe is it has lots of veggies and you can keep adding all you want.  I was a little skeptical adding the peanut butter and wondering if there would be enough flavor, but it really works!  It was fantastic, husband loved it and we can freeze for lunches.  I sauteed the garlic, celery, onion and red bell pepper, added to the soup and let it simmer about an hour, then added the peanut butter at the last.  Thanks for the great soup recipe!

The soup is different than the traditional chicken soup which makes it nice if you are craving chicken soup but dont want something that tastes like campbell's.    I will say, however, that the flavors are just a tad off....  I think I should have used a red bell pepper to just add some oomph to it.    I used natural creamy peanut butter which didnt have much sugar- this is a MUST

Most amazing soup - definitely a winner. Had no canned tomatoes - substituted 8 oz can tomato sauce. Seems like any vegetable would work in this soup.

What a flavorful, wonderful soup! I did add 1 tsp of cayenne but otherwise made this recipe exactly as written.  There was no overwhelming peanut butter taste, however the peanut butter added a nice consistency to the soup.   I made the whole batch and gave half to some friends, and they raved about it. My husband, Ray, said to put it in the "Ray Loves This" file :)

I was just not too crazy about this soup.  I made it according to the directions and left nothing out but when it was done it was just a bit bland to me.  I juiced one lime in it and added about 1/2 cup sour cream and it was much tastier to me.  I think cilantro would have also been a really good addition, but I didn't have any.  I just added some red pepper flakes and green onions to it for my husband when he gets home but I haven't tried it that way yet.  I'll have to try it tomorrow for leftovers.

This soup is wonderful!  I did omit the zucchini and added some cayenne pepper to give it some kick. I am now addicted to this soup and love to have it on a cold day. Thank you.

This was my first try at a soup recipe and I'm so pleased with the results.  I prepared the recipe as directed except I didn't have the canned tomatoes or green pepper on hand.  We loved it!  I can't believe how easy it is to make a great chicken soup.  Thank you!

this was very very good. i used the food processor for carrots and onions and some of the potatoes which initially i thought made the carrots and potatoes too small, however in the end added to a thicker stew-like soup which was absolutely delicious!! also added brown rice, which made it thicker (personally i like thick soup). as many previous, adding cayenne is a must.

This soup was surprisingly good!  My husband, five year old and two year old ate it up.  I only added 1/4 cup of peanut butter for fear of making it too peanutty but I think that I could have used 1/2 cup as the recipe was written.  There was just a hint of peanut flavor but if you didn't know what was that it was in there, you wouldn't have known.  My five year and husband enjoyed their soup even more with a little dash of cayenne pepper.

While the soup doesn't taste like peanut butter, it also doesn't taste special. The peanut butter adds extra oil and salt, which helps the flavor of the soup overall. I felt like this soup needed was missing something.

My family enjoyed this. It was a nice change from the ordinary chicken broth. We didn't have all the vegetables, and it still turned out well. We'll make this again.

Made this last night.  The only change I made was in adding larger quantities of veggies and a dash of cayenne.  Absolutely love the taste.  DH wasn't sure when I said we were having PB chicken soup but loved it too!

Yes, I was just as concerned as everyone else when it told me to put in 1/4 cup of peanut butter, but in went the Jif.  Wow, it tastes GREAT.  Really hearty soup.  I didn't have potatoes on hand so I threw in extra zucchini, corn, and even brussel sprouts and it turned out great.

This can be altered easily to make a vegetarian version, and seems fairly adaptable for ingredients on hand, too.

This recipe was great. The peanut butter gives it a nutty taste that's great for the fall. I used a combination of chicken broth with roasted garlic and broth with roasted vegetables (both canned) to add more flavor, and me and my boyfriend almost ate the whole pot!!

We loved this recipe. I made a double batch to freeze for tasty lunches. For personal taste, I added some lime leaves and a Thai seasoning blend (salt free) just to kick it up a little more.

My whole family enjoyed this, but I didn't love it.  They put it on the "ok to make again" list, but I don't think I will. I seems a bit "brothy" for a soup with peanut butter.  I'd prefer a creamier texture.
My husband and 9 year old son didn't even realize there was peanut butter in the soup.

I hate to give bad reviews, but my family would not touch this soup.  I cook a lot and made it according to the directions, and once it was done and I tasted it, I even went back to make sure I did not miss something because I wans't good.

I'm sorry, I couldn't disagree more with other reviewers. My family loves peanut butter, PB&J sandwiches are a household staple - so I was eager to try this recipe. I made the soup according to the recipe & the smell and taste of peanut butter invaded our senses!! We found the taste very odd.  I added about a litre more chicken stock, fresh basil and rosemary and that corrected it enough for my family to enjoy.

I love peanut butter so I thought this soup would be awesome. It had a good taste and was defiantly healthy. My soup was thick with vegetables. I did leave out the bell pepper because they seem to give me heart burn. I bagged up the leftovers and froze them for a quick workday lunch. The soup had a very rich flavor. I will make it again, but it will be a while.

This is fabulously fresh with a mildly nutty flavor. I was nervous about this recipe so I only made half of it. It turned out great! I used homemade chicken stock and a garden tomato instead of canned. I also used squash instead of the zuchinni. I plan to make more & freeze individual portions. Thanks for a great recipe!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!!!! My husband saw the ingredients and asked me to leave the peanut butter out of it but the moment he left I put some in there.  The only thing I did different was more veggies and less broth.  But even if you make this as is, its one awesome recipe!

I am giving this 3 stars. Why? Well simply because most of these reviews say you wont notice the peanut butter, but that is ridiculous. It is a quite obvious flavor. I added some more chicken stock and some curry, even then it was very obvious... Not to say it was bad, just that if you think you are going to sneak this by someone who doesnt like peanut butter-- HA HA Good Luck. I did however enjoy this soup.

I love soup! I had alot of fresh broccoli and decided to try this recipe. There were a few vegetables that I left out. I browned the chicken first then put everything in the crockpot. I cooked it on high for 3 hours. I also added some brown rice on a whim the last 30 minutes. If you like spice, add some red pepper flakes and asian chile sauce. I can't wait to eat this again tomorrow! You won't notice the peanut butter!

I wanted to try this with what I had on hand, which was chicken stock, celery, broccoli slaw with shredded carrots, chopped cooked chicken, garlic, chunky peanut butter, and spicy tomato juice. I added some fresh basil and cilantro from the yard, tossed in some hot sauce (cholula or tapatio) at the end, and it was perfect-- spicy, nutty, tomato-y, and yummy! I halved the broth because we had less veggies. Can't wait to try again with the "right" recipe. :)

Very good recipe!  I didn't use broccoli or celery and I added a couple teaspoons of red curry paste.  We loved the peanut flavor in the soup.  Next time I'll up the amounts of carrots, potatoes and chicken...the soup was a little too much broth.  But good recipe.  Thanks!

This soup is actually pretty good.  It looks weird though. I wouldn't serve it to guests.  My hubby walked in and looked at it skeptically and said, "So... is this one of those soups that will be better the next day?" but when he actually tried it he admitted it's really good.   For those that are having a problem with the flavour, I would suggest making sure you use a really good broth.  I've used some bland broths before and since it's a broth based soup the original flavour of the broth is really important.  I make mine own broth and the soup tasted great (although I did add a sprinkle of chili flakes and about a tbsp of sugar to the soup before serving).

Great soup!  I added fresh spinach at the end and a dash of curry powder along with sweet potatoes, and it was wonderful.  I actually made it with ground turkey instead of the chicken for a different twist and my toddlers goggled it up (me too).

This was different and interesting.  I was hoping it would have more of a thai flavor, but it didn't at all.  I'll try it again and make a few adjustments and additions.  Oh, and this recipe makes a TON!  I'll cut it in half next time!

I was skeptical about this one, but I thought I would try something different.  I have to say, it was a really good vegetable soup recipe.  I think I could have cooked it a little longer because my broccoli was not quite as tender as I like, but overall it was a good, and different, recipe.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I thought it was just ok.  I guess I was expecting a thicker, heartier soup, but found it to be very bland and watery.  I even doubled the amount of peanut butter, but it didn't help.  I thought that maybe it would be better the second day, but I found it just as bland and watery then as well.  My family wasn't impressed either.  I won't be making this one again.  Sorry.

This sounded gross and I almost discarded the recipe until I read one review that reminded me of oriental peanut chicken. Then I thought... don't think peanutbutter soup. Think peanut chicken. It was great. The cook time gave a great texture of the veggies. The broth is not something I would drink alone, but with the veggie's it's good.

Edited to add: Combine this recipe with the seasoning from "Jennifer's Thai curried peanut soup". FABULOUS!

I also use veg soup base and edamame instead of chicken and chicken broth for a great vegetarian version.

Delicious! This soup can be tailored to suit your tastes. We ommitted the broccoli, added frozen spinach and a little red curry paste to give it a bit of a thai flare. I'll definitely make this again!

LOVED this.  It was even better the second day.  I didn't use brocolli - you can really use any veggies - I added a little extra chicken broth just to make it last longer.

soooooooo good!!  I read a lot of the reviews and used diced tomatoes with green chilies and added a little bit of cayanne and cumin - it's very flavorful and is so great the next day - it's definitely a winter warm up soup!!   thanks for the great recipe - I'll definitely make it over and over.

this was muy delicioso!  the peanut butter adds so much flavor and makes this a really hearty soup!  i have made it a couple times and the chicken, although tasty, is unneccessary bc the peanut butter adds both protein and makes the soup filling.  i like this recipe because it provides a  great base for playing around with vegetables and spices u have on hand in the kitchen.  yum!  definitely try this

Although the peanut butter gave this a different taste from ordinary vegetable soup, I didn't think it was all that good.  The cooking times for the vegetables are off too.  The celery should be among the vegetables added first as it was still crunchy when the other vegetables were done.  I wouldn't make it again.

This is a wonderful & welcome change from the usual chicken & vegetable soup. The pb adds a very subtle, sophisticated flavor. To quote my husband, "this is as good as soup gets." He did not know there was pb in it, and still loved it after I told him. I used Adams natural pb (creamy, but I bet chunky would be great!) The only change I made was no salt. It didn't need it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have to agree with other reviewers that this soup was kind of bland.  I ended up adding an unhealthy amount of salt!  The peanut butter is an interesting addition that gives the soup a different flavor.  I omitted the potatoes since I didn't have any on hand, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It's not a bad recipe, and is definitely a great way to get your servings of veggies, but make sure to keep the salt shaker next to you!

This soup was a total success, delicious!! Was rather dubious about the peanut butter, my daughters said if I added it to the soup they wouldn't eat it, so.... I added it when they were watching TV! They were none the wiser, we all had seconds, yum!

pretty good and very easy.  it was a bit bland for my taste so i added a spoon of hoison sauce and chili paste to each bowl before serving.  i also added okra and rice to the recipe.  it definitely got better after a day in the fridge too.

The taste of this soup was actually good.  It does have a different texture, ever so slightly gritty.  I used all-natural peanut butter, maybe that had something to do with it.  Very tasty the next day for lunch.  Will make again.

Meh. I don't know if it has anything to do with using Natural peanut butter, but you can hardly taste it. It's a pretty good soup otherwise.

I did not care for this recipe.  It was hoped that the peanut butter would draw out some of the other flavors.  Instead it seemed to overpower everything else.  As for taste, the experience was like eating a peanut butter and chicken vegetable sandwich.  The texture is difficult to describe, but closer to a hearty  potato cream than chicken soup.

Maybe my expectations were set a bit too high from all the outstanding reviews here, but I didn't think this was anything extraordinary. I boiled a few frozen chicken breasts in the broth, then chopped them up and followed the recipe to a T after that. The chicken was tender and good, and the soup was good, just not deserving of my 5-star rating. My husband didn't care for the soup, so I won't be making it again.

This is truly one of the best soups I've ever had.  I make it all the time for friends and family when they're under the weather.  The peanut butter only thickens the soup and is in now way overwhelming.  I make with honey roasted chicken breast meat.

Very vegetable-y and warming on a cool night.  I snuck a ladle before I added the peanut butter, and loved it. Good and different, but I'm still not sure about the peanut butter.

Different.  Kind of asian.  I liked it better for lunch today than my little taste yesterday while making it.  I left out the zucchini (bleck!!) and used 1c canned diced tomatoes.

I made a variant of this that worked out quite well.  I don't remember what I changed but i remember in particular that the peanut butter in this recipe added a really nice flavor.

The taste was good, but the color was not very appetizing.  Also, there was a weird gritty texture that the peanut butter left behind that was unpleasant.  This not a soup I would serve to company, but makes a good soup to have on a cold, rainy weekend.

Pretty good but we didn't go WOW. I make a lot of soup so maybe we're just picky. Might make again some time.

This soup was good, had a very different flavor than other soups.  My roommate was very skeptical about putting peanut butter into the soup, but she agreed that it added a nice unique flavor.  Will make again.

Very unique soup. Tasted pretty darn good. My husband couldn't beileve that there was peanut butter in the soup. He liked the Thai kind of taste.

I was disappointed when I tried this recipe. With all the hype I was ready for something fantastic. It was ok, my boyfriend and I both ate it, but decided not to make it again. I followed the recipe exactly. I just didn't think it had much flavor. We both like strong flavors, so maybe people who like more subtle flavors would like it.

I served this at my annual "Soup Dinner" and it was a hit!  I did make some changes, only to make it a lower carb dish.  I used mushrooms, zucchini, and canned tomatoes for the vegetables.  I think you can use whatever vegetables you like because the broth is very rich on its own.  Great recipe!

Wonderful! Don't omit the green peppers unless you really don't like them. They add so much!

Not bad, but not worth the "best soup ever" hype.  I skipped the ckicken and swapped green beans for the broccoli.  The peanut butter does add a good flavor but at the price of a certain grittiness that isn't pleasant. I may try again and see if I can melt the pb into a creamier texture.

Very good.  I can't add a lot to what the other reviewers have said.  I used reduced fat peanut butter and it was delicious.  Don't be afraid of the peanut butter (unless of course, you are alergic to it).  Enjoy!

Sorry folks, but I just don't see what all the raving is about! This was an average at best soup. Although I used a quality creamy peanut butter, there remained a slightly gritty texture to the soup base. As my husband said, its alright, but nothing I'd ask for again. "Edible" was the way we both rated it. What a disapointment!

I made this soup and improvised a bit with whatever veggies I had on hand. It was great! I love the peanut butter--it really adds to the flavor. My 16-month old and toddler also liked it. The toddler picked out some of the veggies, but loved the broth and chicken. Overall a big hit.

I thought it was very good however the children did not like it as well. Overall it was a good healthly soup.
