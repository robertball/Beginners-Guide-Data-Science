I have taken this to parties many times and it is always a winner. The only ingredient that I add  is liquid smoke. It really gives it a "smoked salmon" flavor.

Added cayenne pepper in with the nuts and parsley. Sprinkled it around the edge of the dish, also. Everyone loved it!

I make almost an identical spread except I use smoked salmon and omit the pecans and parsley - same goes for this dip - there is never any left!!  I will have to try the pecans/parsley next time.  I believe if you don't have fresh smoked salmon you can use canned salmon and liquid smoke.

A dash of smoke is a good idea. Pack this into a fish-shaped mold lined with plastic wrap. chill overnight. for an ultra-elegant presentation, slice 1 small cucumber paper thin,(slice blade of processor) Make overlapping "scales" on top. A bit of olive or pimento makes the eye.

Made this for my husbands office party. Everyone loved it. I had requests for the recipe. Every year I make recipes I find on this site. When people tell me I'm such a good cook. I always tell them 'it's easy, just go to allrecipes. :)

So disappointing. Impossible to roll into a log or ball, even tho it had been chilled overnite. End rsult, I mounded it in a bowl and sprinkled nuts and parsley over the top. Flavor was not very exciting either, tasted like tuna salad. Will not make again.

for the holiday I decorated it with cranmberries and people loved the cranberry with the dip!  It was awesome and very easy.  It looks like a very difficult recipe.

This appetizer was a hit during our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner and a definiete keeper for those who love salmon dip. To keep this recipe easy I shaped the mixture into a half moon log on platter without rolling it or using saran wrap as suggested by other raters/review.  I also did not use a hot horseradish for my first attempt at this recipe.

I then decorated the exposed parts of the log with the parsley and pecans.  My daughter then decorated the rest of the platter with a variety of crackers, carrets and grape tomatoes.   

This colourful display impress a friend of mine (who is an excellent cook) and an aunt from England so much that they told me that they had to have the recipe!!

Very Yummy!
I had many compliments on this tasty treat.
I also took the advice of another poster and used the saran wrap to shape the log and made it simple to work with!  
Tasted like salmon not tuna! LOL  
As well, I might try the smoke flavour next time since I love smoked salmon as well!  
I liked it very much as well and will make it again...

Wonderful!!  I had no trouble rolling this as I used saran wrap to roll it and then refrigerated it. After I pulled it out of the fridge I then rolled it in the pecans.  Very simple.  Had a great flavour and everyone enjoyed it.  I will definately make this again and again!!

Pretty good.  I didn't LOVE it, but I would guess that I don't LOVE salmon spreads.  Given that, I would make it again and thought it was a great way to use leftover salmon.  I used sauteed shallots instead of green onions and added a good bit of fresh dill.  No parsley or pecans, although depending on the cracker I could see the need for some extra texture.  Lined a bowl with plastic wrap, dumped the mix in there, and then refrigerated it to form the shape.  Served with Triscuits.  Great, creative way to use up leftover cooked salmon and a seemingly fancy appetizer that is actually very easy.

I took this to work for a carry-in.  I usually test recipes first but didn't have the time.  Wow!  My co-workers loved it!  I added liquid smoke and garlic powder.  I will add this to the favorites.

This was really good!  I had many remarks when I served this...it was a hit!  
I am perplexed as to how salmon could possibly end up tasting like tuna fish, but I guess everyone has different tastes!
I will make this again for sure.  It was easy and everyone ate it all up, so that makes it a winner in my books.

I found this recipe to be okay - nothing too exciting.  I used a high-end can salmon in the hopes that the taste would be great, but like someone else commented "it tasted like tuna fish.  I won't waste $8.00 on salmon to make this again.  Sorry.

This was good but seemed to me a pretty basic salmon spread.  Next time I will add more spice (cayanne and horseradish) to it and more salt.  It was pretty bland even with salty crackers and we finally started sprinkling salt on each topped cracker as we ate it (made it taste much better).  On the other hand, the finished product looks fabulous!  My family figured it was 'store bought' because it looked so pretty.  This is a keeper even at only 4 stars.

I used a can of red salmon & added a little liquid smoke.  I tried to shape it into a log but the texture was more like a spread than a solid roll/log.  The bottom line though is I took the spread to a party & it was a definite success.  Although there were a lot of appetizers at the party, I heard the host tell a guest to try this one as it was really good.  Next time, instead of trying to shape it into a log, I'm just going to arrange the spread on a platter & add the parsley & pecans on top.

Whenever I make this I use plastic wrap to help roll this into a log.  
Then I stick it in the fridge until needed and then assemble on a serving tray.  
It always works but if you don't want to make it into a log shape a ball shape would work just as well.

Wonderful! Everyone loved it!  I sprayed "Pam" on my hands to ease the formation of the log. No problems. We also used smoked salmon.

To make this recipe "Zone-Friendly," I use light cream cheese. (I also add the liquid smoke for flavor).  I pack a serving to take to work and eat it on cucumber slices instead of crackers.  Combined with a piece of fruit, this becomes an appetizing, quick, healthy lunch.  Not just for dinner parties!
