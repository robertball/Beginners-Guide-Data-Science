As most other reviewers noted, this was a great base. Some changes I made: I scaled to 4 servings and cut the chicken into pieces.  
I added more mushrooms, garlic, and tomatoes. I also put a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of both lemon and tomatoes. 
I originally cut all the veggies up and put it one bowl with the garlic, lemon juice, sugar and tomatoes then added that to the pan after I cooked the chicken and set it aside. 
Just because of timing I ended up simmering the whole thing for a few minutes.  
The end result..you have a thin sauce that goes great with pasta and you can taste a hint of lemon.

Tasty.  After reading other reviews, I browned the chicken w/the onion, then added the mushrooms and tomatoes. It didn't make sense to drain the tomatoes, as the liquid added moisture to the chicken and made a nice sauce to mix with rice.  I cut back on the lemon juice and added garlic, basil and Italian seasoning.

This rates 5 stars with me.  It was super quick.  The chicken was tender and moist.  And, best of all, this is a REALLY versitile recipe.  I can definitely see using zucchini, squash, green beans, eggplant, etc. or whatever else is on hand as part of the mix.  And you could certainly try a little balsamic vinegar to sweeten up the sauce (drop the lemon) or even using white wine.

This recipe is a great base with endless possibilites.  I will certainly enjoy trying them all!

I thought that this recipe was great!

I took some of the other reviewers additions to the recipe like parsley, garlic salt and added some of my own.

I added basil and black pepper to taste.

Then I cut up fresh cherry tomatoes that I put around the chicken on a plate. Tasty and looks appetizing too.

I also only cooked the onions until they were tender and then I added them at the end until slightly brown. I also added the tomatoes at the end so the chicken could cook longer.

Nice and brown.

This was an easy very delicious recipe!  I added the juices from the tomatoes and andded more mushroom, but the other measurements were right on. Very good!!! I will make it again, even if my husband doesn't like tomatoes. His loss!

I changed a few things (added more lemon, doubled the tomato and spiced the chicken with paprika & garlic) it was very quick and very delicious.  My husband loved it and my 2 year old thought it was great.

EXCELLENT.  very nice tang with the lemon.  I added 2 cups steamed noodles before turning the chicken over which made a complete meal when served with a caesar salad. WILL CERTAINLY DO AGAIN

Love it! Nice and light.  If you want to make it into a little more comfort-type food -- skip the lemon, add 1 clove garlic, 1/2 tsp oregano -  brown chicken/garlic first, mix together tomato/spices (salt to taste), add 2 T. to 1/4 c. dry vermouth (depending on how much you like it) simmer, then top with italian mix cheese at the end,cook just long enough to melt the cheese.

I found this recipe quite lackluster. The flavours didn't blend well together, the tomatoes were out of place and the whole concoction was a let down.

It is a good recipe. I just browned the chicken a little after it was cooked to give it a better looking appearance. The chicken was really moist and tasty.

No one in my house liked this recipe. The mushrooms and tomatoes burned because the chicken cooked too slowly. The lemon juice gave it a funny taste that I personally don't want to taste ever again. She was right,though, it is easy to make.

Somehow I seriously messed this one up. I cut it down to 2 servings, but before the chicken was even close to done, I had to remove everything but the chicken from the pan becuase it was burning to the bottom. I should have used more olive oil. It still tasted good and I could tell it had the potential to taste great (Had I not managed to mess it up) Next time I am just going to use the sauce for 4 with 2 breasts, maybe cut into chunks... hmmm...(this is where I get into more trouble)

WOW! I was really surprised by this recipie. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder pepper and basil. Instead of diced tomatoes I added sun dried tomatoes. I put everything on top of some cous-cous and my family loved it! I thought there would be too much lemon juice but it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

My husband raved about this recipe!  The only thing I added was a little bit of garlic salt to the chicken.  Was delicious and tangy but if you aren't fond of lemon it might be too much for you.

We loved this recipe!  I modified it a bit to use two large chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces and added the whole can of diced tomatoes and juice.  I also added a bit of garlic blend seasoning.   This was served as a sauce over whole wheat pasta.  For those on Weight Watchers, the sauce is worth 6 points.

This was really good and easy to make and I will definitely make again.  Easy clean up too.  I did make a few changes...I used a small can of mushrooms instead of fresh and a whole can of petite diced tomatoes.  Used only 3 tbs of lemon juice and a pinch of sugar.  Also added a little garlic salt with parsley.  I cut up the chicken breast and browned them with the onion.  Also used about 1/2 cup of union.  Served over bowtie pasta with garlic bread.  My husband loved it too...took what was left with him to work for dinner.  No leftovers!!

This is a yummy dish.  The sauce was alot more runny than I expected and it was a little bland for me.  Although, the only change I made was add 1 clove of garlic, some coarsly ground fresh pepper & garlic salt.  I thought it could use more mushrooms so I will definately add more next time.

I'm always looking for recipes that go off quickly without a hitch---This is surely one of them.  I Used fresh Roma tomatoes and snipped some fresh Italian parsley.  Served with tortellini.  MMMMM...good!!

This was terrific - dinner was on the table in a half hr.  Followed the recipe exactly (only adding some dried Italian herbs) - served it over white rice which I picked up from the Chinese take out on the way home.  We thought the lemon flavor was perfect.  Only one skillet to wash!  This is a perfect meal for after work.

This was really good. I just moved so there wasn't much in my fridge. I used balsamic vinigrette, lemon juice, fresh mushrooms, a whole can of diced tomatoes with the juice and it turned out great. Served with angel hair pasta and fresh asparagus that I picked up that day. (I marinated the spears in vinigrette, as well, and put in 450 oven for 10 minutes...yummy!)Next time, maybe I'll try it as written but this way was very good also.

This was an easy recipe, and it tasted very nice. Next time I serve it with pasta I will double everything but the chicken. I'd prefer a little more sauce. Like others, I browned the chicken with the onions, then added the other ingredients.

A delightful dish--and so easy!! I made just a couple of changes: cut the chicken breasts in thirds; added about a teaspoon of minced garlic and a few shakes of Italian seasoning; used sort of a stir-fry technique to cook.  At the end, I sprinkled the whole thing with generous portions of mozzarella and romano and shoved the skillet in a hot oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese and cook the chicken a bit more.  It was tender and delicious--a dish I will make often.  Thumbs up from the boys--thanks so much.

I absolutely loved this recipe, will make again and again. I added minced garlic, whole leaf spinach with a dash of vinegar, and then I added a flour and water mixture to thicken the sauce and let it simmer. I served over organic long grain white rice. PERFECT! Thanks T

It IS easy! The whole family loved it. I added a bag of baby spinach and doubled the amount of mushrooms and served it with mini ravioli. Another keeper :)

This was five star for me, with a tiny bit of tweaking.  I used 1/2 cup of diced onion instead of a quarter, I minced 3 cloves of garlic and cooked that with the onion, omitted the mushrooms completely, and diced 2 whole tomatoes, which was definitely more than the 1/2 cup the recipe called for, added 1 teaspoon of sugar, and finally gave a sprinkle of salt throughout once the chicken was in the pan as well as a generous dash of pepper.  All that being said, I may increase it even more next time, because sauce that it made was DELICIOUS.  Served the chicken breast on a bed of white buttered rice, and then spooned some of the sauce over the whole thing.  YUMMY!!

This was delicious!  I used what I had on hand in the house, so the recipe was tweaked a little.  First I sauteed chopped onion, minced garlic and cubed chicken in olive oil.  Then I added a can of  diced tomatoes w/ mild green chiles, and green beans.  I added some lemon juice, italian seasoning and salt.  This was served over brown rice w/ shredded cheddar on top.

As a base recipe this was very good.  I added Sage, Thyme, Garlic powder, black pepper and Lawry's season salt with the chicken and mushrooms.  You can use the sauce and pour over the chicken breast or as I did, served overcooked rotini.  I also used leg quarters instead of breasts.  Awesome results!

Simple and delicious! I used fresh tomatoes and served this over spaghetti squash for a super healthy meal. I also added some freshly chopped basil and garlic. I gave it 4 stars for this original recipe, but would give it 5 stars with my modifications. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I have made this recipe numerous times and it still remains one of my favorites.  I do change a few things, however.  I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces and I add the whole can of diced tomatoes.  This creates a lite sauce that we use to serve over pasta.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

Tracy, this is a great recipe! I was looking for something that was quick & easy, and called for things I had on hand. I only had canned Mexican tomatoes with lime & cilantro, so I skipped the lemon juice, and added fresh chopped cilantro at the end of cooking. I followed other's suggestions, and cut the chicken in smaller pieces and added fresh garlic and more mushrooms & onions. I also cooked the chicken with the onions, then added the mushrooms, finally adding the tomatoes. I served mashed potatoes along side this dish, and there was nothing left over. It was a huge hit with the whole family! Next time I'll either try it with regular or Italian flavored canned tomatoes.

Easy to make and well liked by adults and toddlers. I did add some garlic seasoning and cut up the chicken into smaller pieces. Served over long grain rice. Very fast to prep and make. Will definitely make again.

This is a really nice recipe.  It's not fancy, but it is good.  I cooked everything in a different order:  first browned chicken in oil, added onion, added garlic, added tomatoes and lemon juice.  I also added some Italian herbs and topped the chicken with cheese.  I didn't have any mushrooms--it was still good over rice.  Tip:  I always add a tsp of sugar to canned tomatoes, I think they taste fresher.

This recipe was good, but needed only 1tblspn of lemon...in my opinion.
I also replaced the mushrooms and Tomato with rotel, and covered Spanish rice with the finished product.
Was quite good after the changes, and the leftovers can be added to velveeta for a nice tex/mex dip.

DH and I really liked this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe except that I didn't drain the diced tomatoes and used fresh mushrooms.  The juice just made it really yummy.  Served w/rice and a salad!  Finished the left-overs for lunch today!  Thank you Tracy!

GREAT recipe!  Quick, easy, and flavorful.  Even my 11yo son loved it, and he is not one to give food compliments easily.  I substituted frozen onions and mushrooms for the fresh ones, and used diced cherry tomatoes.  It was a great dish, and it looked good on the plates, too, with the color from the vegetables.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tripled the veggies in this because we LOVE veggies!  I added some garlic and salt, pepper, oregano and garlic pepper.  It was still a little bland.  I also browned the chicken in sugar.  I feel like it may need to be marinated to give it the extra kick.

The lemon juice gave the sauce a really interesting flavour.  I served it over pasta with some parmesan, and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again, though I will try increasing the sauce next time and maybe experiment by adding some extra vegetables and spices.

This recipe was very easy and quick to make - I made everything as suggested but did add a few spices in such as Garlic Powder and Oregano to give it more flavor.  I served it with Rice and a Vegetable.  Family all seemed to enjoy.
Thanks for the recipe.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  the only change I made was using a can of diced tomatoes.  Just enough juice mixed with the mushrooms to put over rice.  Will DEFINETLY make again!!

Sorry but I really didn't enjoy this one.  Even with some additional veggies & spices it wasn't for me. The lemon came through alittle to strong also. Not on the repeat list.

Easy and yummy.  Used a whole cup of sliced mushrooms and probably about 1/2 cup of diced onion and about 3/4 cup of the diced tomatoes.  Added two cloves of minced garlic and some chopped flat leaf parsley.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks!

Nice change from the common chicken&cheese or chicken&cream of soup recipes. I think the diced maters cook down and make the broth a lil more watery than desired but I strained some of it off. Taste was light, chicken tender. Is Good recipe for us as the Mrs can't have garlic, she enjoyed it also. Easy to fix.

Really easy and sooo good.  I scale to 4 but use a whole can of Italian diced tomatoes and a full cup of mushrooms.  Also used a tiny bit less lemon then what the recipe calls for and added 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  My whole family, including my 2 year old, loves it!  Thanks!

This is excellent, and easy to make, I add 1 tbsp Worchester sauce.  I have also used pork chops in place of chicken.

Very good! My hubby doesn't like lemon (didn't tell him what was in it) and he loved it! 
I cannot make something like this without garlic so added a few cloves and doubled all veggies. Used fresh tomatoes and zucchini would be good too next time. Served with rice.

Super good and super easy! I ate my left overs today and they were just as good.  I also cubed the chicken and I think next time I may add a few more diced tomatoes for more sauce to go with the pasta I served on.  Will FOR SURE make again! :)

Wejust love unusual ones for our family. This one certainly fits the "unusual" chicken!I do slightly brown the chicken,onion, and add garlic,also to be browned! Otherwise is  perfect as is! Thanks for always adding a terrific idea for a common meat!
