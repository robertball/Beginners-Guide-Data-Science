I used diet Code Red instead of cola because that's our favorite kind of soda.  It was a pretty pink color.  I enjoyed it but the BF didn't really like it.

I used to drink this all of the time when I was little. I am in Canada and my parents used to run the Legion kitchen, so we were always talking to the bar staff. One of the ladies used to make me this drink with a few alterations. She used Coke,a splash of Sprite, orange juice and Grenadine. And she also used to call it Swamp Water, It was my absolute favourite back then. I haven't had one in years, but now that you have reminded me, I think I will have to make some soon! Thanks!

I'm giving this a five because I used to make this drink when I was a little girl in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep.  It would quench my thirst and quite honestly I don't know how I fell back asleep but hey I was a kid!  The only difference was I used pepsi instead of coke because that's what my dad used to buy.  I can't believe my drink is actually a recipe on my favorite website.  I have to show my husband because he cringes everytime I tell him about my pepsi/orange juice drink!

I agree with the submitter, this is really kind of an ugly drink - kind of like coffee with cream diluted with water, murky, with "stuff" floating in it (the pulp).  But more important, not only was it unattractive, it didn't taste good either.  More orangey than cola-y, but the combination of two acidic beverages was too much. I certainly had an open mind, but this was not a good match. I'm SO glad I only made a half recipe.  Update:  While I still stand by my original 2-star rating and review, Hubs has since tried this and had a different opinion.  He said, "It's horrible to look at it but if you shut your eyes, it's strangely refreshing."  That was after he had me mix up a second glass of it for him.  Since he pronounced it as good, and four stars, I must revise my rating to reflect the average between us - three stars.

Hubby liked this - I didn't, but I don't drink sodas.   This is sweet, for sure and not the prettiest drink.

My brother and I "invented" this drink when we were kids.  We called it a "fruit spritzer" and had no idea anyone else had discovered this magnificent beverage. I haven't had one since I was a kid, but I remember it being the best thing ever.
