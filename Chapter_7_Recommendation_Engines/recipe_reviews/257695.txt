This is very delicious! With these noodle bowls, the real clincher is the sauce and this one is quite good. I cut the sugar by 75% because I don't like things that are sweet. It worked perfectly. I made a couple of changes, I didn't have any red bell peppers so I used fresh cayenne peppers cut into strips and I used sesame oil instead of olive.  This is a refreshing and light meal. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious with dinner,  but i thought it was even better the next day after soaking up some of the flavors.

The sauce in this was way off. There is too much oil, and too much soy sauce. I also halved the sugar. I would halve the oil and soy sauce next time. Also, I think maybe adding some peanut butter to thicken the sauce and add some flavor would've helped. It tasted flat and unflavorful.

Tasty, we could have soaked the noodles a little longer. We only had the flat rice noodles that look like fettuccine noodles at our store so I am guessing they need to be soaked longer. The only change we made was we added carrots that were cut like matchsticks. I also gave generous portions of vegetables to this salad.

I made it as written and it was great!  All the extra sauce you people "complained" about having - actually soaks into the noodles & vegetables when it sets overnight!

First off, I have to say this...I almost NEVER follow a recipe when I'm making something.  I use it more as a guideline.  When I make a salad like this one, all bets are off.  I followed the directions for the dressing but after that, I did my own thing.  I wanted a little more Asian flare so I picked up some bamboo shoots and snow peas at the store.  Secondly, I thought the red pepper sounded a bit off, so I left it out.  And since I hate cilantro, left that out, too.  But, I made it twice and after the second time, I'm thinking it needs red, and maybe some yellow, too, so next time, I'll add the pepper but the color remains unknown to me at this time.  I loved this salad.  It's beyond easy to make, and it's so delish.  I hope everyone who tries it, enjoys it as much as I did.  Have fun!!!!

Very yummy! I highly recommend either taking some leftover ingredients from your noodle salad and making spring rolls or vice versa! It's a great recipe that you can customize to include veggies and herbs you like. One note for the sauce is that I think it could have a stronger flavor, as it is subtle.

I didn't make the sauce by exact quantity.  I adjusted the amount of sugar, soy sauce, oil, etc... to taste. Also cabbage taste better than the lettuce in this salad.

This was really quite good! I added shredded carrots and bean sprouts to my salad to give it a big more veg/color. I used less sugar in the dressing and topped it with roasted peanuts. My family LOVED it! Even my 3-year-old twins devoured it. This is really simple and fast to make, a perfect chilled salad for summer lunch. Will be making again.

I didn't put as much salt or sugar as it called for. I was also out of rice vinegar and used red wine vinegar. I was making a double batch but I didn't double up on the sauce. It seems like the recipe calls for too much sauce. It was so popular I got asked for the recipe. I just made it again. We love it!

Sauce was tasty but way to much.  I shouldn't have added the whole thing.

I loved the fresh taste of this.  I added the garlic and ginger along with the dressing ingredients to my blender as I wanted those flavors evenly spread throughout the salad.  I completely forgot the turmeric and did not miss it.  I knew that adding any jalepeno would be too spicy for me, even if I took out the seeds, so I just diced up a green pepper instead.  Topped with chopped peanuts.

If you like this kind of stuff this was good I guess. I cut the oil to 1/4 c., the sugar to 2 Tbs. and tossed the noodles in sesame oil instead of olive.

We followed the recipe and were quite disappointed by the lack of subtlety in the flavors. The overwhelming taste were vinegar and ginger. If we were to try it again, we would add WAY more vegetables — the tiny portions of pepper and cucumber left us wanting more. I think it might be better with a peanut sauce — or, frankly, a store-bought sauce.

I made this exactly according to the recipe but used half the sugar and added honey and black pepper instead. That helped mellow the acid in the dressing and added a bit of a kick it needed. Someone suggested cabbage instead of romaine and I think we'll try that next, so thanks. Aside from that, it was a great, light dinner for summer.

The sauce was way off for me. I followed the instructions, but skimped a little on the sugar. Seemed much too oily and lacking flavor. There was also way too much of it -- I wish I had added it little by little instead of dumping it all on.

We really enjoyed this noodle salad. We will be using this to take places. As others have said, the noodles need a little longer - maybe 2 or 3 minutes. Also, the store was plum out of basil ... we didn’t miss it.

I just made it and it's awesome. Great flavor. I followed the directions exactly for the dressing. I doubled the veggies. I'm serving it with sliced chicken.

The noodle and vegetable mixture was okay, but I sautéed the onion, garlic and ginger because those raw are too pungent for me. I followed the recipe for the sauce and my husband and I did not like it at all. Will use a different sauce to finish off the noodle mixture.

I will definitely make this dish again! Flavorful, fresh, and light... delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and would only change the amount of dressing. The only reason it's not a perfect 5 stars for me is that I used about 2/3 of the dressing on the salad and still had it pool on the bottom of the bowl and needed to drain it. Add the dressing gradually, and save the rest for later. Also, my prep time was closer to 35 minutes, but it was worth it!
