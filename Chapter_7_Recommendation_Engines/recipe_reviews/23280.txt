I made a boo-boo and refrigerated the dough overnight!  The rolls wouldn't cut nicely, they just crumbled, so I ended up rolling it into little balls and baking it like that, instead of flattening it out and cutting.  Worked just fine!

I used white sugar instead of brown sugar and added 1 cup of walnut pieces.  Also, I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top of the cookies before baking the cookies instead of after.  I came out great!

This is an excellent shortbread recipe!  The only thing I can suggest is sprinkles or a butter cream frosting to give this cookie some "looks"!!
My husband loved the taste and so did I.  I decorated them for Christmas!!  Thank you!!

Well, these were pretty tasty, but weren't as melt-in-your-mouth as I'd expected. They don't match my old Girl Scout troop leader's shortbread unfortunately, but I will probably make these again.

Excellent recipe.  I pressed it into a shortbread mold, sliced it while warm and gave it to friends at a Breakfast Club.  I'm a hero!

I used this recipe during the holidays.  I made the dough, shaped them into logs and refrigerated them overnight.  When I got ready to bake them, I made sure they were at room temperature.  I used a cookie press and couldn't have been happier with the  results.  I'll definately be making these again.

These were awesome!  I wanted a spicy cookie, so I went ahead and added the tsp. of cinnamon right into the dough, and also a dash of nutmeg.  When the cookies were done, I rolled them in a cinnamon/sugar as well.  These turned out so good.  I call them my "snickerdoodle shortbread".

I don't know if I'd say they're "melt in your mouth" but it was a good basic shortbread recipe that I'll use again.

I made three different shortbread cookies, and this was my favorite as well as my husband's.  I rolled the log smaller than 2 inches across for smaller cookies, and more of them.  These are also much quicker than drop cookies.

Very good, I did the marbled variation, and the combination was delicious. They also looked very pretty and unusual because of the white/chocolate mix, I gave them out in a mix of cookies for holiday presents and everyone loved them. :)

I wanted to make these to give as XMAS gifts, but they don't look well. They taste ok though.  The outside of the cookie was brown, but the inside seemed not cooked, it this normal? Should I have left them a little longer?
