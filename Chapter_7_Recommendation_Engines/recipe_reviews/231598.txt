I love cauliflower's versatility and for years have been using it in place of rice and mashed potatoes. The best way to "rice" it is with a standard size cheese grater. Just 2-3 TBL of good olive oil in place of butter, fresh parsley and a bit less cooking time worked well for me. This is a keeper.

Freaky how much this tastes like couscous!. My cooking time was a lot less, so watch this as you are browning.. takes a while to start but once it starts, goes fast.

Love this recipe. I substitute half the butter for olive oil and it is still very good.

This made a great lunch.  I can't say it tasted like couscous but it had a delicious, nutty flavor.  The brininess of the kalamata olives went really well with it.

So yummy and looks pretty too! I had to substitute capers for the olives but otherwise, very tasty! I also used dried parsley flakes because fresh parsley is too strong of a flavor for me

We love it! I have made this cauliflower recipe many times in a row, and I am not tired of it yet! The only thing I do differently from the original recipe is to use olive oil instead of butter. I add more olive oil as necessary throughout the cooking time. I probably add more than 9 Kalamata olives, too!

Really enjoyed this recipe!  Easy to make and full of flavor.  I added chopped kale as an extra boost.  The texture was perfect!  Add it when you are cooking the onions and garlic in the butter.  Seasoned with crushed red pepper flakes.

Great recipe! I didn't have lemon so I used lemon pepper seasoning. Left out the olives and only cooked it for ten minutes. So yummy! Definitively making it again!

My kids devoured this!  I didn't have a fresh lemon, so I used dried lemon.  It only took 20 mins to cook.  Thanks!  Will def make again.

This. Is. Delicious. I made it as stated (except I grated the cauliflower) and was unsure if it was a success until I tasted it. Wow! The lemon is a fantastic addition.

This was delicious! I ended up cooking it for the entire suggested time. Followed the recipe exact except that I left out the olives. Definitely worth the extra time.

I made this with olive oil instead of butter. I chopped cauliflower into florets and then pulsed a few times briefly in the food processor. I followed the instructions but gradually added 1 can of diced tomatoes. I thought this was very tasty. It could be a side dish for a few people, but for me it was a meal and I probably ate 3 servings. It’s good- very similar to a tomato bulgur recipe I’ve tried, but minus the carbs. I’d try this adding green bell peppers because those taste great cooked with olive oil, garlic and onions.

I brought this to a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe. The only issue is that once it cooked down, there was such a small amount. No way it serves 6.  I’ll definately make it again but I’ll double the recipe.

I will definitely make this again. I skipped the salt and used Greek seasoning instead of those called for in the recipe. I also added pea pods and cherry tomatoes to give it some color.

Another one that my kids really enjoyed. I changed mine up a bit.... I used avocado oil in place of the olive oil. Combined the chopped up cauliflower, oil, salt & pepper in a roasting pan. After it was done roasting, stirred in fresh basil and green onions. Yummy!!! As my daughter would say... yummy to my tummy mommy LOL

Since we are not Vegan, I added some diced pork to this. I had no prob using my food processor on the cauliflower and pork to get  them small enough. I did NOT use water when I "pulsesd" the cauliflower. I  used green onions and black olives. I thought it was delish! :) Thanks for the recipe! My hubby is lactose intolerant.

I wanted a cauliflower recipe that served as a substitute for potatoes, rice or pasta. Cauliflower couscous was it.
This made a hit with my husband and twentytwo year old. It was even suggested I make it again for company  instead of rice to go with our shish kabobs.
I did substitute sliced black olives for the kalamara olives as we wanted to keep the salt to a minimum.
This is now a favorite.

I cut the cauliflower in a food processor.  Worked fine.
I made the recipe middle eastern with cumin and curry and mushrooms and spinach. I used the directions to cook the cauliflower.

This is unbelievably good. I've had a few drinks, but I'm dumbfounded at the taste!
