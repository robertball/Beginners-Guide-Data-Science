Gotta love Chef John's buns! These turned out really well - light, lovely taste and texture. Also delicious when made with whole wheat flour.

The only change I made to the recipe was to cut the sugar down to 1 tblsp, because 3 tblsp makes it way too sweet for my (European) taste, and it adds unnecessary calories.

I whisked the egg, then tossed all the ingredients into my bread-making machine on the dough-making setting, thereby skipping steps 2 through 6, resuming at step 7.


I also use this recipe for hot dog buns, and the results are excellent. For hot dog buns, in step 7, flatten each of the 8 pieces into 15x15cm (6x6-inch) rectangles, very tightly roll each one, pinch the ends and along the remaining edge, then lay out on the baking sheet with the remaining edge down. In step 10, brush lightly with the egg-wash, but skip the sesame seeds.

These buns are so easy to make!  What an easy way for beginners with yeast to start!  I followed the recipe except to add one tablespoon of the sugar to the yeast/flour/water mix in the very beginning.  I weighed the dough of each of the buns at 3.5 ounces, and they handled a quarter pound hamburger perfectly.  I think we would perhaps like them just a tad smaller, so next time I'll do what another suggested and make 10 buns from the recipe.  They were perfect.  I like to slightly undercook my rolls like this (see my photo) so that when I toast them with butter they don't get too dry.  We had delicious hamburgers tonight with organic hamburger meat from Costco!  Yum!  Another winner, Chef John!

Delicious! I put all of the ingredients into the bread machine and set it to the dough cycle. When it was complete, I proceeded with the rest of the recipe. I do agree with the others that said these are a bit on the big side. I think next time I'm gonna make 10 buns, and that should be the perfect size for us. As soon as hubby took his first bite he said I should make these every time we have burgers. These have a wonderful flavor and texture...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a really fun and easy recipe to make,although I did make some changes of my own.You see,because I'm a vegan health nut I was unable to use eggs,so I substituted with good ole flax seed(1Tbsp of ground flax + 3Tbsp of water = 1 egg)I also used whole wheat flour(Wheat Montana brand)instead of white,1 Tbsp of sugar instead of three and olive oil instead of butter.Because whole wheat is heavier than white, an extra 1/4 cup of water is needed.This is definitely a keeper!!

This recipe is so easy and produces a great bun. Chef John comes through again. Like others have said, the buns at 8 servings are too large. I tried 10 and still felt the buns were a tad large, so today, I'm going to 12 buns. Size is a personal preference so 8 might be fine for you. Try this recipe. You will not be sorry.

Not sure what I did...  dough was crawling out of the bowl at 1 hour for the first rise!  I got 12 HUGE buns!  I think I could have gotten close to 18 regular size ones!  Also, everything in me was screaming "spray the cling wrap! spray the cling wrap!"  Of course, I didn't listen and... it stuck and deflated my buns!  I baked them anyway, just to see what would happen.  We ate flat bread!  Tasty, but flat!  I  did decrease the sugar to 1 Tbl as someone else suggested.  Not so sure I liked the egg/milk wash.
 
I will definitely try this recipe again... only I WILL SPRAY MY CLING WRAP!!!!!!!

Ok so I reckon they have a great taste. One wee problem though... The cling film sticks and they deflate when removed. Ended up with flat bread.. hmmm maybe don't use cling film?? One part that was exposed was perfect

This was my 2nd attempt at bread. My first batch of yeast didn't take so I had to start over. Other than that my only issue was that my dough didn't look like his in the video at all. It looked really dry. The video mentions it might look too wet-so add flour. It never mentions it being too dry. I added water while it was mixing. Note to self, stop the machine, poke a little hole in the dough with your finger and add the water in there. Otherwise the dough just rolls around in the bowl while the liquid clings to the sides. Either way, when it was done in the machine my dough looked nothing like his. It was hard. I continued on anyways and surprisingly they turned out wonderfully! I was shocked and amazed. I will try again and add flour a little at a time. Perhaps I will have an even better result. thx CJ

My first time ever making hamburger buns, and I now know I will NEVER go back to store-bought!  So easy, and so delicious!  I agree that the buns are large, and you could easily shape 10-12 instead of 8 and they will still turn out a good size.  I put all ingredients in my bread machine to let it do it's thing, and then step #7 onward after it has risen.  These are a HUGE hit in my family; sloppy joes, hamburgers, pulled pork, it all works great!  Thanks for spectacular recipe!

I found and made this recipe for hamburger buns just this past Monday. While I'm no expert, I've tried my hand at making lots of breads, rolls and buns over the years. I've always been disappointed with the buns I've made.  Too puffy, too dense, etc.  Well, I shall look no more! Hands down, this is THE BEST recipe I've tried.  Chef John's hamburger buns are gorgeous to look at, they have a wonderful taste, and they are the perfect texture.  2 days later, the leftovers are still very tasty. These are well worth the effort.  I've found my perfect recipe for hamburger buns!!

Amazing!  Will never buy store ones again... ever. So delicious and super easy. I sprinkle half mine with dried onions to make onion buns the others get the sesame seeds.

I've made these buns many times now. They are WONDERFUL as hamburger buns, sandwich rolls, or just by themselves. I use the dough cycle in my bread machine and they turn out perfectly every time. I don't bother beating the egg. I just throw it in (water, salt, butter/oil, and egg) and then I add the flour, sugar, and yeast. Most of the time, I use olive or rice bran oil instead of the butter just for convenience and it's a bit healthier than the butter. I do not note a difference in taste. I place the dough (after formed into the roll) on a nonstick cookie sheet or a sheet lined with parchment paper. I don't bother covering with plastic wrap (I use to do this but discovered it was not necessary, thankfully)...instead, I just cover them well with a light cotton dish towel. No sticking, no problems...and less trouble. I've made these with or without the egg wash and sesame seeds. They are delightful both ways. My kids prefer them without the seeds anyway. It's hard to find a "warm" place in my home for these to rise since I keep my home pretty cool, so I place them in a preheated (175 degree) oven that I turn off a couple of minutes before putting the buns in and let them rise for the recommended time. I love this recipe! Don't bother searching for another. It doesn't get better than this one. Thank you for posting Chef.

So easy and fun to make! I'm still a beginner with yeast, and this was another excellent opportunity for me to work on my skills. Mine came out perfect, and I was so proud of them! DH was impressed and we both thoroughly enjoyed these. I will be making my own hamburger buns from now on! UPDATE: I swapped the AP flour for 100% whole wheat and swapped the sugar for honey.  Came out beautifully!

I made this in my bread machine. I used my kitchen scale to measure exactly 1 pound of flour, and it was the perfect amount. Since I used quick-rise yeast, I only had to let the buns rise for 20 minutes. They were perfectly baked in 15 minutes. The dough was exceptionally easy to work with and form; I didn't have to use any flour, because it wasn't sticky at all. Great recipe!!!

It took me a couple tries to get these right. I am a good cook but don't do a lot of baking, and overlooked the instruction to let them rise *in a warm place*. This is very important! Both times! At room temperature, they didn't rise much (i.e., completely flat). Probably not an issue for more experienced bakers. A couple suggestions: They are great if you use a 50/50 mix of white and whole wheat flour. Also, as time- and labor-intensive as these are, you might as well make a double batch, because I've found that they freeze and thaw nicely.

These were great. My first attempt at making these did not turn out as well. The buns were kind of flat and the bottoms were done well before the tops were. I cooked them at 350 instead of 375 to try and avoid this outcome because my oven runs hot. I decided to try again the next morning and I am glad I did. The first time I used yeast from a jar that was kept in the fridge and the second time I used a yeast packet, because I did not have enough jar yeast left. I think the fresh yeast made a huge difference. My second batch was light and fluffy. I did decrease the temp to 325 and it solved my issue with the bottoms cooking quicker than the tops.

Best bun recipe I've ever found. Follow it to a T if you are at Sea Level. I've made them so many times now and my only feedback would be to watch the buns if your oven runs a bit hot (like mine does), I would only suggest baking 10-12 mins, just keep in mind they are easy to burn from the bottom.

I made these yesterday...I got 12 buns our of one batch and they were the perfect size. I used the bread machine for the dough and then followed the steps afterwards to bake the buns. They were AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use sesame seeds.  we didn't find them too sweet, or really that sweet at all. Perfect texture, perfect crumb. Great and very sturdy for pulled pork sandwiches and for scrambled egg sandwiches for breakfast! I have to make another batch today because they are all gone!! thank you for a fabulous recipe! So much better than store bought!!

I have made these twice in the past 24 hours because everyone loves them! I followed the instructions exactly and the buns turned out fabulous! Thank you, Chef John, for posting this recipe! The video helped,  also. This was my first time ever making buns and I was certain I was going to somehow screw it up, but I was so happy when they came out so beautiful and delicious. :) I highly recommend this recipe! Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe countless times, but I now use two key alterations-- first, I portion the dough into 14-16 buns to get them to a reasonable diameter, and second, I don't cover the rising buns because the covering always sticks and causes the buns to fall. Instead, I let them rise uncovered in a slightly-warmed oven with a bowl of hot water in the bottom.

Doubled the recipe for 16 buns.  Worked great .  There are approximately 3 1/3 cups of flour in a pound.  For a double recipe you need 6 2/3 cups of flour.  You use 1 cup when you bloom the yeast at the beginning and use the remaining  5 2/3 when you mix the dough.  Next time I would not flatten the buns into disks.  Flattening them made a 4.5-5 in thinner bun.  Great flavor though!

I made these a few nights ago to make turkey sandwiches. They came out beautiful and were delicious. The only thing I would say is they are really big if you make 8. Next time I will make 10. 
They made a great sandwich roll.

The recipe is easy to follow. I had absolutely no problem getting the dough to rise! Instead of sesame seeds I put a dash of Italian herbs on the top. They turned out PERFECT for my slow cooker shredded BBQ pork and would be perfect for hamburgers or even just as a dinner roll! This is a keeper!

These were very yummy! I made a mistake and turned the oven on with the buns in the oven without waiting for the second rise. Ooops! The funny thing is, they still turned out good! I can't wait to see how they will turn out when I do it the right way!
Take 2: I tried it again. I still didn't make it the "right" way, but at least this time I did it with intention! After I formed the dough into buns (rosettes, actually), I put them in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I put them in a cold oven and baked them for 20 minutes. They turned out AMAZING! Best egg sandwiches ever. I predict they're not even going to last the day. My husband had 4 before he even left for work.

An easy recipe with great results.  I made ten buns-six 4-inch and four six-inch.  I subbed in about 3/4 cup of soy flour because I didn't have enough AP flour.  Great hot with peanut butter and a drizzle of honey, and equally great as a bun for Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers.

These turned out so good! I got 13 regular sized buns that I used for pulled pork sandwiches. I cute the initial rise to 1 hour (doubled in size in 1 hour) and let the buns rise for 45 minutes. I made these changes based on my first batch, I got 8 GIGANTIC buns. They tasted just fine and are now be sliced and used like slices from a loaf of bread.

Excellent recipe!  I added a minced onion (which keeps the rolls fresh and soft for days) and carroway seeds to the dough, and more of this  plus everything bagel topping after egg wash and before baking.  They are delicious and look really good too!

Update:  if you are a cheese fan, and like to experiment,  add a cup of shredded cheddar to the dough. Awesome!  Great as a loaf to cut and toast (if there is any leftover??) second day also!

I purchased a new Kitchen Aid Pro 600 mixer recently and this was my first mix in it.The first thing is Chef John must make GIGANTIC Hamburgers. These buns are big enough for 8 ounce burgers. I will size them down a bit making 10 instead of 8. I have baked professionally when I was younger but never breads always pies, cakes and pastries. Anyway I doubled the recipe and am slow rising half in the frig to make cinnamon and pecan rolls  The Hamburger buns to out beautiful the dough was just as silky as can be. Easy , taste better than you could ever purchase. Had to cut one warm to try with butter and honey. Wow! Would make an excellent roll, bread or even bagel dough  with some sweeteners in dough. 
Delicious must try recipe!

I really liked this recipe.Made it exact the first time and the second time just made the buns smaller.I also used it to make hot dog buns. What a treat from store bought. These freeze great as well.Next time I am going to add some jalapeno and onion to switch it up fpr a different taste.

I'm a little new to baking bready things, but decided to brave this recipe. Glad I did! I think it is the best bread item i've baked so far! The only thing I changed is that I used white bread flour, as it was all I had on hand, but followed the rest of the recipe closely...even the 2 hour in the oven rise time. These buns were awesome, and it's true...i doubt I will ever go back to store bought. We had burgers two nights in a row, and the buns did just as well the day after. Thanks for this recipe!!

I substituted 1c warmed milk (instant) for 1c water, and got a much lighter bun, the 2nd time around.  I also do the rising stages in the oven.  I turn it on for 15 seconds, shut off, and place the bowl or sheet on the shelf.  Really helps the rising with a warm, draft free space, I think. The baking time in the recipe seems long...burned 1 batch.  I use 375 for 12 minutes, checking at 10.  Great results, everybody loves them.

I made these using my bread machine on the dough cycle then followed the rest of the steps. My family loved them and my teenager is asking for more. He also used them as sandwich rolls for school lunch. Will be making these again today!

Really good recipe, the rising time was a lot less than recommended, it only took a total of 2hrs in total, and they were perfect. We made 12 buns and and 6 mini buns for the kids. Can't imagine the size 8 buns would of made:)

These turned out great! I used a Cuisinart with a dough blade. Super easy! Everyone thought the buns were light, fluffy and extremely tasty! The recipe made 8 burger buns. Has anyone had any luck freezing these and maintaining their great texture and taste?

I decided to make these today because I wanted a ham sandwich.  I watched the video, followed the instructions and they were perfect.  The only change I made was to make 14 rolls.  They ended up being the size of a store bought hamburger bun which is what I wanted.  This recipe will become a staple in my house.  I'd like to note that these buns are a but more sturdy than your typical hamburger bun which will make them the a perfect choice for my BBQ beef.

These are excellent! Followed the recipe exactly, but I used water instead of milk for the egg wash. I also just rolled out the dough and used a biscuit cutter cause I'm lazy.

These are delicious! The only thing I do differently is to make the buns smaller, so I end up with more. I freeze the leftovers and let them defrost on the counter when I’m ready to use them up. They reheat beautifully on the grill. The recipe itself really is perfect exactly the way it is written. Just be sure to follow all instructions and dust the buns with a little flour before covering for the final proof so they don’t stick and deflate.

This recipe is excellent! 
I used a "highly active" form of active-dry yeast, and the buns were massive! Next time I make this, I'll definitely shape them a little smaller. The overall process was incredibly easy, and would be great for a starting baker trying to get their toes wet.
Great flavor and texture, which stayed fresh in a plastic bag for many days after baking. More than just a buger bun!
I totally recommend making these!

Made them for my wifes "Bunco Party" and recieved a "5-star" response...I did add a little of the sugar into the water and yeast mix to help out with raising. I went old fashioned and did not use the cling-wrap...Used a light dish towel the way my Mom used to do.....everything else went fine...Thanx

I am terrible at making things that involve yeast. I have had breads fall or turn out hard and inedible. So going in, I didn't expect much from this recipe. However, every step was so easy and looked exactly like it was supposed to! I used earth balance for butter but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. These came out perfect! I couldn't believe I made them! Better than anything I've had from the store. So delicious and soft but held up to the burger. Husband and child aproved as well!  Go make these now!

I did 1 cup of bread flour and 2 1/2 of all-purpose.  This is the third time making these and this is the first time I did the bread flour.  It made the buns so soft, with the golden harder top due to the egg wash.  GREAT recipe and so easy.  Also, I don't use the foil, I use a damp cloth over the bowl to rise.  Then I omit the cling wrap for the second rise on the cookie sheet.

This is a 5 star +  recipe.  My husband, AKA 'Mr Picky' raves about these buns.  I have made other recipes, but none match these.  This is my go to bun, have used this recipe about 7x's now..  No need to add, subtract or amend this recipe, it is perfect the way it is.  These buns have stood up to  juicy grilled  burgers  (!/3 lb fits perfectly), roast beef and gravy sandwiches, and sloppy joes.  They don't fall apart, are moist, delicious, have good tooth, and give  just a slight yeasty taste that makes them a perfect  bun.  Have shared them with friends and neighbors and all agree, they are superb.  Plus, they are easy peasy!  THANKS CHEF JOHN!  ps, I also have made the dough into hot dog buns, just as delish as the burger buns..

This recipe is perfect as is.  I did not make any modifications to the recipe and the buns turned out perfectly.  For those that use the foil and cling wrap, you can also just drape a towel over the dough as it rises.  The towel won't stick :)

Made them yesterday for Memorial Day burgers.  Beautiful and delicious!  The dough was exactly as described.  Only change I made was to sprinkle some fresh grated Asiago cheese on top before baking.  I have always been frustrated by the airfilled cardboard tasting buns in the store.  These had more texture and more flavor and were larger than the storebought.  So easy too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've finally found a bread recipe that works for me!!! Thank you Chef John I'm just discovering your videos and food blog! These buns were so easy and incredibly delicious! I made your classic sloppy joes, but my husband couldn't wait he ate a bun alone lol. I can't thank you enough :)

I mistakenly read the reviews before making these buns.  I made 10 buns out of them instead of 8 and I'm now regretting that decision.  10 buns are too small.  I make homemade bread frequently so I'm not a novice baker, I followed the directions to the t.  make 8 buns and follow the recipe exactly as written, you won't be disappointed!

Soooooo good, excellent recipe with easy to follow instructions.  Divide dough into 16 if you want sliders.  This recipe makes 8 very large buns.   THANK YOU Chef John--you are the Best!!!

Fabulous recipe. I used all natural baking flour.  I reduced the sugar to 1tbsp of sugar. I only let it rise about an hour and a half.  Best ever recipe I am saving this!  However I did have issues getting them all the same size

Really good!  I will never buy store bought again and they freeze well.  The only negative is how long the whole process takes, which for a very busy family can be challenging to find the time.

This was my first time making Homemade Hamburger Buns. I can't say enough good about them !  They were nice and soft, GREAT flavor. I liked that I could taste the salt in them. I never realized how bland hamburger buns were until I ate one of these. 
To say I'll make them again is an understatement.  It takes quite a while but boy it is worth it ! EXCEPTIONAL ! 
Looking forward to making them for sandwiches as well ! ************* Deserves ten stars !

Delicious! Great texture, soft yet sturdy enough to hold up to a big juicy beef patty. Only thing I did different was half the recipe and then make six buns out of it. The buns were regular size.

Excellent buns. Turn out great every time I make them. I find them just a little too sweet so I cut the sugar by a few tsp.

I made these for the first time at our July 4th cookout, and my family raved about them all day!  I have some very picky eaters, and both of them absolutely loved the buns and asked me to make them every time we have burgers.  I made them exactly as written except I made 10 buns and they were still large, easily holding a third-pound burger.  Thank you Chef John for this wonderful recipe!

This was my first time ever making hamburger buns I wasn't sure if I could make them since I don't know much about making bread. But these turned out perfectly, smelled amazing my boyfriend could smell them before he even got in the apartment! :) Delicious!

Fabulous recipe.  Even though we had a humid day, the buns were flawless. (I always use the scale for flour). I doubled the recipe for my need.  My guests raved about them--and hey, how many times do guests have the chance to be served homemade hamburger rolls?  I loved them, too.  Couldn't have been easier or more flavorful. Cook's tip:  I let the dough rise in an oiled plastic bucket dough bucket in my oven.  No top.  Door closed but with the addition of boiled water and poured into a pan. Warm and humid!  My rising times/volume was much faster/larger, so keep a sharp eye out.  I found the texture of the bun perfect for our burgers.

These hamburger buns were amazing!  I am fascinated discovering how easy it is to make so many things I used to buy processed at the store (with who knows what preservatives and additives) at home.  Like most of the reviewers said, these buns came out huge.  You could get a couple more out of them; however, I like to use them to make grilled cheese sandwiches, so they were fine for me.  Couldn't wait to try them so I used one before completely cool for my veggie burger and I was hooked.  Never buying store-bought again.  I couldn't get my yeast to proof after two attempts so I threw all the ingredients in my breadmaker and it was perfect (probably was the yeast, as I used my breadmaker yeast in the machine with no problem).  Thank you Chef John!

I've made these several times now...awesome!  Let them rise to 3X...they will do it!  Really light and "store bought like (albeit infinitely better)," which is not often a good thing but for a burger bun it sometimes is...sometimes you want a sturdy bun...sometimes this is perfect!

This was a really great recipe.  If you are making this by hand make sure to knead the dough until the texture is elastic and very smooth.  We live in Cincinnati and these rolls, combined with a good cheeseburger, gave Terry's Turf Club a run for their money!

I made a double batch the first time I made these, and they were fantastic.  Great recipe!  I'm wondering: Can I use this dough to make a loaf of bread?  I think I may just try it!  Thanks!

I had been looking for good hamburger buns recipe and I finally found this one. The buns were fluffy and soft.  Next time I will make sliders buns, I just divide the dough into 24 pcs. Thank you Chef John for this recipe, love it!!!

The lightest, fluffiest burger buns I have ever made! I am never buying packaged buns again.

I hate buns that are too big for premade burgers. Therefore, I decided to make my own buns (since the burgers were premade from a large snail mail retailer). These turned out perfect! I did replace 1 cup of AP flour with whole wheat flour.

I have made these several times and they just keep getting better. I even brought in my two little girls to help this time and it was still foolproof. From big buns to regular size to sliders, this is my new go-to recipe.

This was an awesome recipe. Dough came out just the way it was suppose to. Sorry Chef John, I used a bread machine to mix the dough. Baked the buns, they came out perfect. They came out so good I decided to make another batch while I am writing this review.  All I can say this was awesome and will be my base dough. :)

We just got our first little charcoal grill (awwww...) and decided to test it out.  My husband mentioned that he was going to go pick up some bread-inna-plastic-bag to put the end product in. WHAT?!  Why cook beautiful food and drop the ball at the finish line?  I quietly slipped off to the kitchen and made these, and because they were so easy, no one knew I was working on them until I had them done.  The final result: they were declared PERFECT.  Thanks Chef John!!

I've followed this recipe twice now and I couldn't be happier!! They came out perfect both times. Sadly I had no sesame seeds to sprinkle on top, but they are good none the less!  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an extremely easy bun or hamburger bun recipe! :D

I signed up just to leave a review. Delicious! 

Made 10 instead due to personal size preference but I'm left with 9 as me and my husband tore one apart fresh from the oven to eat with butter. 

Tomorrow's project: this recipe with cheddar and jalapenos for pulled pork.

These are excellent and fun to make.  I would give them 5 stars if they were my favorite hamburger buns ever.  Franz kaiser buns trump these, barely.

Awesome recipe! Chef JOhn's Video for this was extremely helpful too. 

I, like others, reduced sugar to 1Tbspn and it was perfect for my taste. One tip: if you leave them out they will get stale faster. Try to put them in a container if you've made a lot and want to save the freshness. 

I left mine out after I baked them around 4 pm and they were too crispy by 7 when we ate them. But I put them in some tupperware and they are fine now, back to normal softness.

I've tried a lot of recipes but this one will be the one I use from now on. The buns were light and fluffy and did not detract from the burger by being too dense.   The rising time was not as lengthy for me but a stickier dough is a definite plus.  The buns were a little on the big side, so I think I could make 10 and still have them be a good size.

Nailed it! Finally. Taste, texture, size, shape...everything!! The one and only change I made was to pre-toast the sesame seeds. Chef John...you da bomb! Update: I've just completed my third crack at these buns;  A+++ . Consistently perfect. I grind my own sirloin and a quarter pound patty is a good match for each bun (there's 8 - each weighing 102 grams). Two pounds of beef gives me 8 patties....perfect!! P.S. These bad boys freeze well, but not for long. They will only do you a couple days otherwise.

All i can say is WOW!  Chef John is right on with this recipe.  

My second rising was minimal as i didnt put it back into 85 degree oven as i did the first rise.  Will do next time but the overall roll as it turned out was nothing short of fantastic.

Great tasting, easy to follow directions.  I made 10 buns and they ended up 4" across.   I will definitely make these again!  Next time I will try making it with half  whole wheat flour.

Great recipe buns are just slightly sweet I had a little problem forming the buns I think it was because I put too much oil in the bowl when I found the ball. Otherwise they tasted great and look fantastic.

Made these several times in the last few months.  THE BEST!

I divide into 12, as my family likes smaller burgers.  Also made hot dog/polish sausage buns .  Not difficult at all and the buns freeze well.
Thanks to Chef John, we are completely spoiled by the flavor and texture of these delicious buns and will never buy the bun-shaped lumps of chemicals,  sawdust and deck sweepings that lurk inthe grocery store.  Thanks John

Thanks Chef John this recipe was great. 
The only change I made was not to stretch them out in my hands for me the hold their shape if you just flatten them once you shape them all into buns. My first one came out a bit flat and not as tall as a bun.

I didn't make any changes except for what I put on top of the buns. I put dried onion, parsley, and sesame seeds, poppy seeds. also as a rule of thumb, when making any kind of rising breads lightly push in on the dough with one finger. If the dough is ready it will bounce back out. If the indentation stays in, kneed it more.

These are some of the most flavorful and beautiful buns I have ever eaten. I make a hamburger today and it was perfect. They are also very good as a dinner roll or snack.

Loved this recipe.   I make my son an 8 inch cake sized hamburger fir his birthday since he doesn't like cake and loves burgers.  This IS basically his burst cake.   Thank you because obviously no one sells buns this large.

I made this following the directions to a T.  They were perfect.  My son said he doesnt want store bought anymore.  Hubby loves when I make bread so of course he'd love these as well.  Made some pretty big burgers to gone them and the buns held up.  Yummy.

This recipe is awesome ... just be aware that the buns come out easily twice as big as what any hamburger could possibly want, and the height is just right so it isn't a case of rolling them out too big but too thin.  I used a scale to divvy up the dough into 8 equal parts.  I could have done 16 parts and everything probably would have been just right.

They won't taste like Wonder Bread buns but they are massively yum anyway.

I made the recipe without changes. They were a spurge after a month of Whole30. What a treat! The buns were soft but sturdy. The next time I will divide into 10 since they were too big.

I can't believe making bread is that easy!! I made this for the very first time without making any changes other than swapping the cling wrap for a clean dish towel. I have always seen people cover bread to rise with dish towels so that was just instinct.. so if you have troubles with the cling wrap deflating the buns, try that method. 

Me and my picky 6 year old both loved them! Thank you!!

Didn’t change a thing. Always referred to video when making if needed. My entire family loves these and the look so much better than store bought. The best part is that they are so easy to make that I had made them quite a few times this past summer. Thank you Chef John.

We split into 12 and they were perfect for my 1/4lb burgers.

Just made these for the 2nd time as "mini" buns (see photo) so they could be like appetizer size (made 24 in 12" x 17" pan with 1" raised edge).  Reduced sugar to 2 T because dough raised so quickly (I had to pound these pieces of dough on 2nd rising to get down to 1/2".  Yeast is more active in summertime.  Soooo many uses;  great recipe.

These were AMAZING. Best hamburger bun recipe that I've ever come across. I didn't quite use all the egg wash because there was a lot, but it's difficult to half an egg so I'm not sure how I would make less next time.

I found this recipe just in time. I prefer homemade bread because I like to know what's in my food. This is a perfect homemade hamburger bun recipe.

I measured 0.5 lb all-purpose flour and add 0.5 lb whole wheat flour into the same bowl after resetting the scale to zero. Somehow my flour was miscalculated or I misread the scale. This recipe is well written. I got to found out my flour was 1.5 cup short when I about to mix the rest of flour into the mixture.  I reduced sugar to 1 tablespoon, and, instead of only use all-purpose flour, I mixed in 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups all-purpose flour. I'm gluten-free but my husband grew up eating wheat flour bread. The bread I made before had been mostly dense and heavy. Until yesterday, my bread baking skill upgraded to a professional level. Yeh! He can't tell if the bun was store bought or homemade.
I made a breakfast burger with this homemade bun, runny fry egg, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and Picante sauce. He loves it.

Thanks to Chef John for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Loved this recipe. I made 8 hamburger and 5 hot dog buns with this recipe.  I skipped the proofing step with the yeast since I was using a bread maker and used bread-machine yeast. I put all ingredients into bread machine and used the dough function, then formed buns and let rise again. It took 2 hrs for second ride (not 1 as stated) but my house is cool so that was likely the issue.)

I made the buns according to the recipe, except for the sesame seeds. We sprinkled chia seeds on two of the buns, which was fun. These buns were super tasty, just slightly sweet, and the house smelled like a French bakery! The burgers were fantastic, true American classic pub burgers. The buns were the perfect fit for the burger patties, and held the burgers together nicely. Delicious!

Will make these for now on instead of buying buns at the store. These are very easy to make, it just takes time to rise.  So light but very flavorful.

I'm not a "Baker" nor do I own any mixer, not even a hand-held one, but I followed this recipe exactly and these buns turned out perfect on the first try! 

I used a fork and a bowl to mix ingredients in the first stage and then worked the dough by hand on a floured surface until it was nice and elastic. 

I also accidentally proved the bread the first time for close to 3 hours which may have been too long since I had lots of air bubbles to get rid of. But all the hard work paid off! Highly recommend

Delicious! Doubled these for party. The rising time may be different depending on the atmosphere where you live. My dough doubled in size on the first rise in more like an hour/hour and a half. I walked away for two hours and let it rise in my oven on proof mode. My dough definitely overproofed, wished I had checked it around the one-hour mark. To compensate, I only let it rise about 10-15 mins the second rise, and they were almost doubled by then. All the timing mistakes aside, the rolls turned out great, with a nice even crumb inside. Since I doubled the recipe and cooked it on multiple racks, I followed my Wolf manual on temperature and timing for multiple racks of rolls, rather than Chef John's instructions. Wolf manual says to bake 325 for 15-20 minutes on Convection Bake setting. Did this, and three trays of rolls cooked at the same time and came out perfectly. I am making third-pound burgers, and these rolls are pretty oversized so they will work wonderfully. You could really make probably 16 store-sized rolls from this recipe. Just make a size that makes sense:) Will definitely keep this recipe. Thank you, Chef John!

I cut the recipe to 1/2 and got 6 small but very light & delicious buns. I did subst. olive oil for the butter and cut the salt for health reasons. I didn't have a dough hook as I always knead by hand, but it did seem like I needed more flour than recommended. I didn't cover the buns with saran wrap, but boiled a cup of water in my microwave to warm it up, and used the warmed up microwave to let the buns raise. It works great if your pan will fit. I always let my dough rise this way & never have a problem. 

I love the final results, but may try using whole wheat next time as this bun is almost too light and delicate...guess I am just not used to eating "white" bread...lol

These were amazing. I read a review and cut the sugar to 2 Tbsp. and it was perfect. These had the best texture I have seen. I am making them for my students burger cook-off competition in school.  I made them into 12 slider buns.

Very easy to do and I kneaded by hand because I don't have a stand mixer. Just mix it together in a bowl until the dough comes together. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead adding a little sprinkle of flour at a time only when the dough is sticking to the point where it's smearing on the counter. Use a dough scraper or wooden spoon or whatever you have to scrape the dough and keep kneading. Definitely watch the video to get an idea of what the dough should look and feel like when its ready. I used instant yeast so I only needed to let the dough rise for 30 minutes or so each time. I'm guessing that the folks who said the buns were too big let their dough rise too long. Great flavor, even better when lightly toasted. I cut down the sugar just because that's what I prefer. My kids and husband like things a little more sweet. Might do that for them next time.

Made the dough with my bread maker and didn't use the plastic wrap when rising the buns.  I just used a clean kitchen towel. I also made them into 11 buns. They were scrumptious and I defiantly will be making them again and again .

I’ve tried a few different hamburger bun recipe but never really been pleased with the outcome... these however were exactly what I’ve been trying to find. I followed the recipe as written, the only deviation was that I used bread flour instead of all purpose flour (because that’s all I had at the time and didn’t want to go shopping). This are light, but sturdy and have a great taste. They are a little on the large size, as some of the other reviews have stated, so next time I think I’ll make ten instead of eight.

This recipe is 5***** all the way..The buns are, without a doubt, the lightest and tastiest hamburger bun I've tasted. They have just the right amount of sweetness and a nice buttery flavor. The texture is excellent and they browned nicely with the egg wash. I added poppy seeds as an added touch for some extra flavor. I am now printing out several copies for my 'baking friends'.

Easy and perfect tasting.  I will cook them about 5 minutes longer IF they are being used for sloppy joes.  That is the only change I made and tonight is batch #2.  Thanks for the easy and very tasty buns.

Not a fan.  I will say, the "bread" interior had a great, soft texture, and I used half AP and half whole wheat flour.  The issues I had were that the outside was very hard (maybe next time, if there is a next time, I'll use just milk, no egg?), and there really wasn't much flavor to it -- needed more salt.  I used kosher salt, so maybe I needed to use regular.  I also used only 1TBS of sugar, as others suggested, so that might be it, but really, it needed more salt.  I also didn't get quite the rise for the second batch - mine got wide, rather than high.  Next time, I'd make them less flat and a little thicker and closer together for the second rise, so they get thicker, rather than flat and fluffy.

I've made this recipe three times, and each time the buns turned out wonderfully.  I was a bit skeptical about the first proof being 2 hrs., but it's correct.  It's a great recipe and the buns have a wonderful crumb.  Next time I might try making these into cheese or onion buns.   I highly recommend this recipe.

These were delicious, however, I had to keep adding flour. The dough didn't look like it did in the video and it seemed like it used way more than one pound of all purpose flour. I added some corse salt in addition to the sesame seeds and got rave reviews from my family and friends.

Once I made these...my husband said "we're never buying store bought buns again!" They're amazing! I didn't have regular milk and used almond milk... they were still fantastic! I also didn't have sesame seeds, but used whole wheat flour for dusting! Love this recipe...so easy and SO worth the look on your family and guests faces when you serve them!

Made exactly to the recipe except made 10 medium buns and 2 smaller sized ones. For the size of hamburger patties I make I’m glad I reduced the size. Also, didn’t egg wash or put sesame seeds and no regrets!

Awesome buns they were gone in 3 days and I made 12. My sizes weren't very consistent though. I just threw everything in the bread maker and it made great dough. This time I am going to use a bowl to cut them out of the dough so they will be all the same size.

Great recipe and video instruction.
I modified my second batch slightly.
I did 8 Ounces Bread Flour and 8 Ounces A.P. Flour.
I also went from 3 Tablespoons to 3.5 tablespoons  of Sugar

My first attempt at homemade buns and they were a raving success. It was cool in the house so it took longer for the dough to rise than expected. I warmed the oven to 200 degrees and turned it off. After 10 minutes it was 120 degrees so I placed the buns in the oven for 5 minutes to finish rising. I also topped with Everything Bagel seasoning because I was out of sesame seeds. AMAZING!!

So easy and delicious. I appreciate the video. I cut sugar to 1Tbsp and made ten instead of 8 as we prefer a bit smaller burger.

Delicious!  Put the ingredients in bread machine to make the dough.  Used 1 cup of my ground whole wheat white flour.
Turned out beautifully,
This is a keeper.  Will try making into a loaf.

Super easy and beautiful buns. I don't think I'll ever buy buns again. They even freeze well, so I can make a bunch and save them for another day or for last minute burgers. I liked the hot dog bun adaption I saw in one review and will be giving that a shot the next time.

THese turned out pretty amazing for my first attempt.  I did learn that the hotdog buns can really get too big after they rise so next time I’ll need to make them a lot smalleri in order to achieve a regular sized bun.  The texture and taste were spot on, it’s a keeper recipe for me.

This was fun and easy to make.  I used bread flour and both times the buns came out a little flat.  The first rise was great (more than doubled) but the second one didn't rise as much.  Should I add more yeast or something?  Or does the bread flour require something to be altered???

I was wrong. These are amazing. The secret is to give these some time to "mature" before eating them. I basically pulled these out of the oven, sliced them in half and tossed them on the grill. Don't do that. Let them cool COMPLETELY. Thankfully, I was so sure of Chef John when I made them the first time I tripled the batch, and froze the rest, and as we've pulled them out over the last month, we realized that these are, in fact, excellent. Sorry for doubting you CJ!

Original review: These were pretty good, but I'm not sure they are exactly what we were looking for. The ingredients were nearly identical to the amazing version my MIL makes that require 5 hours + overnight that I've never been able to get to come out (hers has way less yeast), so it seemed like it would be perfect. Not quite. These are a lot more dense than hers, which we didn't love, so I'll probably keep looking.

These are hands-down the best hamburger buns we've ever eaten. This is my go-to recipe any time we have burgers, pulled pork sandwiches, sloppy Joes... we will FIND a reason to make these just so we can have them.

High Altitude adjustments:  I live at 4500 feet so had to adjust for altitude. I always used active dry yeast in the bottle so I can measure. I reduced the yeast by 1/4 teaspoon which would make it 2 teaspoons.  Also reduced the sugar by about 1/8 teaspoon. The first proof took 1 and 1/2 hours (rise is faster at higher elevation). Second proof took the full hour. Oven temperature at 400 degrees and baked for 10 minutes. I actually over baked them by 1 minute. Keep an eye on them.

I don’t bake bread so this was a stretch for me but these buns turned out great?   I made soup for tomorrow’s dinner and may change the menu from hamburgers and soup to soup and bread.  We tried these hot out of the oven with butter and they are delicious! Thanks!

The hamburger buns turned out very well, and might be something I'll make again, despite the long process.  I did have to let the yeast mixture sit for about 25 minutes, and fed it a little sugar, in order to get it to foam.  Other than that, everything else went smoothly and according to the recipe.

I loved these! With only 3 burgers we had some extra buns...They didn't even need a burger they were so yummy!
I'm a beginner baker and these still turned out great-my confidence with baking is "rising". Newbie tip: closely follow the instructions for the yeast, flour, water step...water not too hot and don't mix it more after its smooth then leave it alone till it's kind of foamy (15 min here in central humid florida)
Thanks for posting this!

So very good.  I made no alterations of any significance.  These buns are light in texture, hold together for the perfect sandwich experience. I rarely eat burgers because I don’t care for the store bought buns (heavy, too big, too filling, no ‘real food’ taste); this recipe enhances the burger. I’ve also used these for other sandwich fillings, like, breakfast egg sandwich and tuna salad sandwich, it’s perfect. I’m actually thinking I may stop making regular bread. These turn out just that good!

I love all of Chef John’s recipes. The buns are exactly as advertised! Outside is firm and tasty! Inside is soft and full of flavor. The buns are easy to eat and hold up to the juiciness of my pulled pork. Next time I will divide them into 10 rather than 8, they were a bit large but so good! The perfect buns! Also we had high humidity so needed to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour. Thank you Chef John!

Worth every minute of the 4 hours it took to get those done. They were perfection.  I love that they got softer after they had completely cooled and did not stiffen up as many other breads do with cooling.  The flavour and texture were fantastic and I will be sticking to this recipe for the future!

I followed the directions and they came out perfectly.   I won't be making them again.  For the fuss making burger buns from scratch took, the result wasn't worth it.  They were perfect, but they were perfect hamburger buns.  That wasn't exciting enough for me to want to go through the fuss again.  I'd rather make a bread-oriented side dish that wows people, and buy hamburger buns.

My wife loved these buns. I  coated them with egg and water and they browned perfectly!  I made them custom size for the meat and sloppy joes. The taste was good > will make them a little more savory next time. they seem easy to make to me. 
Good recipe!

I will definitely make these again. The only changes I made was I made 10 buns instead of 8. I might even make 12 next time.

WOW! - I love a good brioche recipe and this one does not dissappoint - the smell of these cooking brings the whole neighborhood out and the finished product is soft and tasty - I dispense with the egg wash and spray the tops with water instead giving the buns a nice brown top  - also, as some other reviews have said I chose to divide the dough into 10 buns rather than eight, and I do not "batch bake them" (although I have and they are still delicious) but instead use two cookie sheets and separate the buns by a couple inches or so - as the recipe states it is important not to let the plastic wrap touch the buns during the final proof, I lightly dust the buns with flour and make sure the plastic wrap is loose - the finished product does not keep well, as no fresh bread really does, so eat them right away - this is a very versatile bun that makes amazing sandwiches and BLT's as well as next level burgers, and if you have a stand mixer it is a relatively simple recipe to make - Chef John does it again :)

Just fantastic. Super simple to make and they came out perfect. Only thing I did differently was make 10 instead of 8. With that change the buns were just the right size for the 6 oz burgers. They held up perfectly to the meat and toppings, didn't fall apart at all and they weren't tough. 

I think I'll have to make these every time we have burgers. Thanks Chef John!

I've made these buns 5 times now, each time they turned out perfect and were delicious.  I use a small kitchen scale to make them the same size and they look professional when I add the seeds as suggested.  Thank you Chef John!

I have made this recipe over and over again.  It is just fabulous! The buns come out so soft and delicious.  I manage to make 16 regular handburger-sized buns out of this recipe! I do reduce the sodium (1/2 tsp Morton Lite Salt) and use half wheat flour for health reasons.  Otherwise, I follow everything exactly.

Not sure if i'll ever have to buy burger buns again! These are GREAT! and sooooo easy. The recipe says it makes 8 but you can easily make 12 and they will still be a hearty size. these really do stand up nicely to a sturdy burger! Delicious :)

Excellent taste and texture. I added 1T of sugar to the  flour, water and yeast mixture and omitted the other two T. The first rise took one hour. After reading the reviews I went with 10 buns, next time I will make 12. Great recipe that I will make again.

My 10-year-old son made these to fuel his passion for cheeseburgers, and they turned out wonderfully! We accidentally added 1 Tbsp. of milk to the egg before adding to the dough and let both rises go longer than stated in the recipe. They still turned out light and airy. The cling wrap did stick to the tops of the buns and had to be pulled very gently. We might try lightly oiling it next time. We made them yesterday, and my son is ready to bake another batch today! Honestly they're the best hamburger buns we've ever had! This recipe would do well shaped for hotdog buns too.

I'm new to baking breads, and based on my mishaps while putting this recipe together,  I assumed the worst results. However, the buns turned out amazing! I followed the directions as is, BTW. I'll definitely take the time to make these whenever we're up for burgers.

Perfect recipe!!!! I split it to make 12 buns instead so they would be a bit smaller.

These are amazing, the flavour is awesome and the texture has some substance but isn't to airy or heavy. I cooked for 13 years and I have taught Hospitality (Culinary 
Arts) for 25 years and made these with a Grade 10 class (about 14-15 year olds) and it's almost foolproof.  We made it with instant yeast but following the directions with great results. If  you want slightly larger buns for larger burgers divide into 6-7, about 145 grams each.  Thanks been waiting for this a long, long, time. Great for rolls too.

I have made these at least 6 times now and I have to say that this is the BEST bun recipe I have ever made. I have made these using my ninja bread mixer and by hand and both turn out great. My husband tells me that we are never buying hamburger buns ever again. These freeze great-be sure to cut them before your bag and freeze.

The recipe was easy to follow and had great results exactly as written. My personal taste is for a little less sugar next time. I have a tiny appetite so I made a dozen buns from this recipe. If I turned it into 16 I think they'd be perfect slider size. I used a kitchen scale to portion out the buns to all the same size.

I was so proud of how these turned out. Next time I'll make 10 instead of 8 because we like smaller burgers. But they turned out awesome.

The only reason for holding out on one star is for time saving convenient step. 
Rapid Rise yeast allows you to put the yeast in with the dry ingredients (no proofing) and skip the first rising. Just mix, form buns, rise, and bake!  That being said, these rolls are easy and very delicious! I got 18 slider rolls. 
I haven't found a Chef John recipe yet that isn't wonderful! Thanks Chef John!

Light, fluffy and delicious! I even put in 1 cup of whole wheat flour and used AP flour for the rest. I was also in a rush so I sped up the process by putting the dough in a warm oven to rise the first time- rose beautifully in just 1 hour! Made a double batch, got 20 buns, and froze the extras.

Some slight adjustments- used bread flour (it was what I had) & oil instead of butter. I made the dough in my food processor  so that was about 4 mins & used metric-so about 500 grams of flour (450 to the dough +50 )& 7.5 grams yeast. 1st raising was about 1 hour in a pre- heated oven. Any longer and my bowl would have overflowed. 2nd- about 30 mins & about 16 mins in oven.produced 10 really large rolls.Lovely and soft. Next time I might brush with egg but I didn't have any to spare this time. I shall try using plain flour & cutting back on the sugar but a really good recipe. Oh and I also added 1 of the tablespoons of sugar to the initial yeast/flour mix as suggested by someone else.Will use again. Thank you.

Made exactly as per the recipe / Video with ONE very slight exception. My Active Dry Yeast did not prove itself so I used SAF instant red label yeast (right on top of the unproven yeast). Everything else the same. (and yes weigh the flour 454 grams / 1 pound - it WILL make a difference) - Buns are / were absolutely incredible.

I have tried and failed to make buns many times.  Today with this recipe I have VICTORY.  They are fluffy,  golden and sweet.  I changed nothing except for using poppy seeds since I was out of seasame.

10 out of 10, will definitely make again.  I have a really hard time sticking to recipes, but I didn't really want to fail on the most important hamburger holiday we have in the US of A.   So I followed this one to a TEA and it was amazing.  The video helped me shape the loaves for the final rise.  I made 10 buns and they were the perfect size.  Thank you!!

Fabulous!  Reading the reviews before making, I am thinking never buy rolls again?  No!  Well, I am eating my words.  These are so easy to make, Chef John's instructions are very clear and they are delicious.  We are not fans of sweetish breads, so I cut the sugar in half and it tastes perfect.  I do need to prcatice on the size.  We like sliders and these are more quarter pounders and the half I made into hotdog buns turned into sub rolls, which is not a bad thing.

This is a great recipe.  It is a lot of fun to be able to make hamburgers different sizes.  We made giant hamburgers for our guys with big appetites.  The buns were a big hit.  We will never buy buns again.  The recipe is easy.  My 14 year old daughter has made these twice.

These were wonderful!  Put all the ingredients in my bread machine, let it need for about 10 minutes and then followed the rest of the steps.  They turned out perfectly!  Were so easy, probably will never buy them again!  Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Made without a bread mixer and they came out wonderfully at every step. If you're not using a machine either and the dough feels too dry, just keep mixing it before kneading with hands and it'll get some stickiness to it, 3 1/2 cups of flour was perfect for the yeast mix. Also took fueldog's advice, the cling wrap definitely needs to be sprayed. Absolutely delicious taste though, thanks Chef John!

Used 100% freshly milled hard white wheat berries for this. Even with that, they came out light and fluffy! I flattened most of them out too much, but the ones that I did get right were perfect.  Just be warned, the rise time on this recipe is reaaallly long. I did not check that at first so had to let it rise for about an hour and a half, punched it down and refriderated overnight. Finished shaping and the second long rise in the morning. Great flavor from all that delayed rise!

These are the best homemade hamburger buns I have ever made and I have tried many, many different recipes. I don't have to search any longer - this is the one. Great for hot dog buns too. Can this recipe be made into a loaf of bread?

This recipe worked great.  The only tweaks I made were a bit less salt and sugar, and I made 10 buns instead of 8. They were the perfect size.

How do you know a good recipe?

When you make it again and again.

How do you know a great recipe?

When it *ruins* the commercial version for you. I cannot buy hamburger buns any more, I prefer making these instead!

I followed this recipe  except I switched out one cup of regular flour with multigrain flour.  It is a long process but the results were very good.  I might try using my bread machine next time as other reviewers have recommended.  The buns were quite large so next time I'll make 10 instead of 8.  It's a keeper. Thanks.

I have made these several times already and we love them and they turn out so much better than any store bought buns. They are more filling and make Burger Night Awesome. Next time going to try adding some grilled onions and poppy seeds...can't wait to try it.

I understand why so many people gave this recipe a good rating. I have made a lot of bread recently and made this recipe exactly as written. I was tempted to add more flour and was glad I didn't because these rolls turned out perfect. They are so much better for you than store bought, because there are no preservatives.  I use mixer with a dough hook and it makes bread making a breeze.

Perfection. Soft, delicate texture, yet slices nicely and stands up to even fully loaded burgers. Makes great buns for sandwiches as well if stretched into 6 ovals instead of 8 circles. I didn't change a thing and suggest you don't either.

I proofed the yeast in the pan of my bread machine, added the other dough ingredients, and processed on the dough setting, which is 90 minutes total and includes the kneading, first rise, gas squeeze, and a second rise. I wasn't home when the cycle was done, but the machine keeps it warm for 60 additional minutes, at which time I shaped the dough into rounds and continued with the rest of the recipe. I made 8 large restaurant size buns, which were perfect for the size burgers we had, but you could easily make 10-12 standard size ones with the amount of dough. These were very impressive!

I made it 3 times now and I am a rookie baker... These buns were one of the first baked goods I tried and it came out sooo perfect. I didn't have a stand mixer, so I kneaded the dough by hand for a good 20 minutes and it  was worth it...

Made as directed and they were delicious.  My family used these for hamburgers and they worked great, they did not break or get soggy from the toppings.  I cut mine after they were out of the over maybe 20 min. And they cut very easy with a serrated knife. I froze leftovers for future use.  Will make again, would be good for barbecues.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for cutting into 12 buns.
my buns did not rise much. they look like hockey pucks. flavor is okay, texture is a bit dense for me.

I had no trouble when I made these twice.  I did get 13 buns out of the recipe and they were right size for a quarter pound patty formed in a patty maker stamp former thing.   The bun is just as important as the burger.  Thanks Chef John.  I love your cookbook also.  I trust your recipes first and foremost.

These rolls are excellent. Easy to make, high quality. Everyone here enjoyed them. I followed the recipe, except I cut the sugar in half.

The only way we hamburgers now! I usually end up using at least half whole wheat or whole wheat white flour. They taste delicious either way.

I've made a lot of bread and a lot of rolls over the years and these are HANDS DOWN the best hamburger buns I've tried.  Easy to make, pretty, delicious.  Soft and fluffy but strong enough to stand up to fillings.  My new go-to recipe for sure.  The only change I made was turning this into 12 buns rather than 8 and they were the perfect size.

I follow this recipe exactly, with two exceptions. I use Himalayan salt and coconut sugar. This is, by far, the easiest and BEST bun recipe I've tried. They are FIRE ????according to my 18yr old son

Wow!  These were fantastic.  Extremely easy and did not take as long as I thought.  I did have to add a little bit of flour as it was mixing because the dough was so wet.  Followed the recipe to a T in my Bosch mixer.  Maybe had to do with elevation as I am 150 Ft from sea level. =]

I love this hamburger bun recipe.  Hamburgers just don't taste the same on other homemade bun recipes.  This one has the qualities of a hamburger bun from the store but has that homemade warmth and freshness.  I just put these ingredients into my bread maker and then bake as directed after shaping and rising the buns.  The sesame seeds are a nice final touch as well.

Made it in my bread machine on dough setting. I whisked the egg and added olive oil to machine.(my mistake) , I did let it rise after I formed into buns, and covered with a clean kitchen towel. Also when mixing I added some Garlic Powder and some onion powder. Once dough had risen baked it. This was the best hamburger buns I have ever made, will make this one more often it was delicious and soft.

This is without a doubt the best bun I have ever had; somewhat reminiscent of Culver's but way better. I did make a couple of changes to make it healthier, 1) I replaced the sugar with 7 3/4 teaspoons of honey 2) Rather than use olive oil to coat the dough with I sprayed it with vegetable cooking spray. Next time I am going to 1) Cut the salt in half 2) Rather than make 8 buns I am going to make 10, with 8 they are pretty big. By making these changes the calories per bun goes down to 196. 

I will likely never buy store buns again...

I really like this recipe, the bun its super soft. I made it without a bread machine or mixer, its the same, you only have to knead with enthusiasm!. If you follow the recipe just like in the video you will not have any problem.

Loved it!  I  Live with a house full of "Meat and Potato" men, with very hearty appetites. It is not uncommon for me to make 3/4 lb. sized burgers (or better),way less trouble than making double burgers, but I never was able to find a store bought bun that could hold up to them, unless I bought a crusty french type. Not what they favored for a  burger. This recipe was able to hold those massive burgers with all the fixins and tasted GREAT!!!!

Great recipe. I was able to make it all in my food processor (I blended and pulsed only until the gluten seemed activated the the dough a smooth consistency) and let it rise in the food processor (did not use oil during the rise, so it was sticky to peel out, but not too tricky). The buns were great and well-beloved. Along with a fellow reviewer, I too, will never return to store bought buns.

I have made this recipe at least six times.  I love them as hamburger buns, but - - - I also make them in a variety of sizes.  you can just cut, not do much hand shaping, and they still turn out great.  They hold together better than store-bought buns.  Taste and texture is wonderful

Made these twice so far. The first time I made them too thick, but tonight I made them much thinner, as suggested. Made them as 8, cooked for 13 minutes and I didn't use anything on the top except a little flour :  they were fabulous ! Very light and soft, great taste and texture. The only change I made to the original recipe was to reduce the sugar from 3 to 1 tbsp. I am not from here and find most of the bread too sweet. Definitely nailed this one as my only bun recipe.

Full disclosure, I haven't actually eaten one of the buns, yet, because I made them for a catering gig tonight. However, I wanted to put my thoughts down now and will update once I try one. I used a half cup whole wheat flour as part of the total flour and they look a lovely golden color. I also divided the dough into 20 slider buns and they came out perfectly sized for the marinara meatballs I will serve them with. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes and they look perfect. Dough rose up nicely and was relatively easy to work with. Will add 5th star once I taste them!

I might be a little more liberal with the salt, though I may have added a bit too much flour. Nonetheless, I found the rolls to be a little bland on their own.

I made it exactly as per instructions., and they came out exactly the same.  They were great.  

Perfect for saucy pulled pork.  Grocery store buns absorb the juice and get mushy.  These held up perfectly.

Easy, peasy! I used the bread machine to mix and rise, 100% white-whole-wheat flour and the rest is history. I made 12 buns and they were just the right size. The only other comment I want to make is that I added about 2-3 T. more water because of the whole wheat flour and/or it's the middle of winter here and everything is very dry, and cut sugar to 1T. since we're trying to cut down on that. Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe!

I followed the directions to the letter.  They were perfect!  I made 10 buns instead of 8, as I noticed in your video yours fit a half pound hamburger.  LOL  I tried to post a photo but the site wants a photo 960X960??  So it wouldn't load.  Oh well.  Thanks for the recipe!! Edit:  This time I doubled the recipe and it had been a while since I made these.  I think it would be helpful to have the flour measurement in cups instead of pounds.  When I did it this time, I figured 16 ounces to a lb and therefore only put 4 cups of flour in for the doubled recipe!  Yes, wet wasn't the word.  Couldn't figure out where I went wrong!  Then of course I kept adding flour until I had a good dough....LOL  Still lovely but it would be so helpful to do the measure in dry cups.  Thanks!

This is only my second bread making attempt and I MAY have forgotten the salt,  so take this preliminary review with a grain of salt ;) The texture was great, but I thought the taste was a little bland. I'm going to try again and make sure I use the salt and edit my review if necessary, because I really want to like this and my husband liked them as made.

Also, like other reviewers, my cling wrap stuck to a few buns and those were a bit deflated compared to the ones that didn't stick - I did follow the directions to lightly flour the top so any tips on that?

Again agree with the reviews that say to make more than 8 buns...even with my daughter playing with a piece of dough, they were just a bit too large.

And finally, I bought yeast in a bottle today after making these because my yeast (packet) wasn't as foamy as the one in the video when I proofed it....they rose really well, so may not have been an issue but I'm inexperienced, so any thoughts on that?

I LOVE the video, really makes me feel less scared to try these recipes so thanks Chef!!!

Excellent taste! I made this recipe without any changes and they turned out wonderfully. In response to reviewers who complained about the use of cling wrap deflating their buns: you've 'overproofed' your dough (let it rise too long), which is NOT the fault of the recipe, as every kitchen is different, and the rise time needs to be adjusted accordingly. To prevent overproofing, make sure you check your dough often and remove the cling wrap as soon as they are doubled in size. Assuming you are letting your dough rise in a draft-free place (i.e. an oven), you can even remove the cling wrap after 30-45 minutes into the second rise to ensure the dough doesn't stick to it. Hope this helps!

My family loves these. I have made them twice now, today will make the third. Easy to follow instructions, good even if you skip the sesame seeds, although I prefer them. Buying store buns seems to be out of the question now. All three kids and husband rather have these over any store bought or restaurant buns. They now call my hamburgers "gormet burgers"

These are phenomenal! After a few weeks of making them, they always turn out well. They are the perfect light and fluffy texture, and they are quite delicious on their own as well! They're so easy, it's really worth the extra time and attention to make them instead of buying buns.

Just like the rest of the reviewers say- super easy and taste great. I like to use parchment paper in the oven for easy clean up and no sticking. Next time I make them, I am going to try a freezing a batch after baked and another batch after the initial mixing, then letting them thaw, rise, punch down, rise again and bake.

I made these tonight for our home made black bean veggie burgers, following the recipe exactly. They turned out flawless! A couple of tips: before you place the cling film/wrap on the rounds, spray it with a little no-stick spray or brush it lightly with olive oil. This will prevent the film from sticking to the dough when you remove it after proofing. Also, be sure to turn the baking sheet half-way through the cooking process to ensure that the buns brown evenly on all sides. I removed the buns from the baking sheet and cooled them on a rack to prevent them from over-cooking on the bottoms. So delicious!

first time making any kind of bun. These were very easy.  My only issue is that not all of them rose the second time.  Might have been the plastic wrap was touching some of them.  I will be trying them again.  They are very good and I love the texture of them.

Excellent buns. Dense enough to hold their own against BBQ'ed pulled pork and not fall apart. I like the fact that they are not sweet, a refreshing break from the mainstream. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was so simple and fun to make. The hamburger buns were so light and the crumb texture was perfect. I followed the recipe and Chef John's instructions to the letter. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. They are excellent for pulled-pork sandwiches. We are going to try the sweet potato buns next. Chef John, you are amazing and we love your instructional videos.

First time I've successfully made bread! Love the recipe, tweaked it after reading all the reviews. Being from New Zealand I used 7 grams (1.5 tsps) of dry yeast granules, 500 grams (3.5 cups) plain flour, 1 Tbsp of sugar instead of 3, replaced the butter with a neutral olive oil. I whisked the egg and put everything into my bread machine, turned on  the knead and rise mode and then resumed with the rest of the recipe from step 7. I made 12 buns. Might make it with cheese on top next time.

Well, I failed to make mine uniform in size, and they had a few bubbles, but they were very tasty nevertheless.  Certainly better than anything I would have bought at the grocery and probably most bakeries as well.  My children even liked them and the only things they seem to like are chicken nuggets, etc.  On average mine came out pretty large, even though I made two more than the recipe said to.  Next time I may try to make 12 rather than 8.  I used a bread machine dough cycle and picked back up on step 7.

I made these buns and let me say that they are hands down the best tasting and softest buns I have ever eaten! I made them exactly as written,  my only change next time like others have said will be to make 10 smaller buns, this will be my only change though, you can't and shouldn't mess with perfection. Thanks again Chef John for another super recipe!

The hamburger bun taste is spot on! 
Tips: 1, Do not even think about that cling wrap for the second rise. 2, Do not squash them on the tray before baking. You'll have a much better bun!

Huge and dense. Used them fresh from the oven for lunch, but the remainder at dinner that evening were already falling apart and not at all pliable. Good taste, terrible texture.

These are the best recipe on AllRecipes.com for hamburger buns!  They are so fluffy.  I think its the butter which makes them great.  It bothers me that the flour is measured in weight instead of cups because I always halve the recipe, so it involves MATH!

This is great, my husband has thyroid cancer. I used Earth Balance no dairy or soy spread.  It is made with pure salt.(iodine free).  Two egg white instead of whole egg. No milk wash, use egg whites or nothing.  Next time I am going to try coconut milk. Iodine free salt.  Easy to make.  Freeze well.  Now we do not have to give up hamburgers.....Thanks

Best homemade buns ever.  I have tried several of the recipes on All Recipes, and have looked at others. but nothing beat these for taste or texture.  I add a bit more water than the recipe calls for, as it makes the buns a bit softer, but I like higher hydration in most of my bread making.

These are the most delicious buns I have ever had!  I started to get impatient when it seemed like the yeast was not going to start to work and considered putting the sugar in with it. I'm glad I didn't. After about 15 min it did start to bubble. I'm wondering if this technique is why they are so good?  Thank you for sharing but  I found out how good they are. With butter and jelly too....help!!!

I cant get my Fleischmans to activate.  Shouldn't the sugar be in with the yeast and first 1/2 cup of flour? Yes, temp is correct and yeast is not expired. Tried 3 packages. Flour is only 1 month open.

These are awesome!! The only things I did differently were that I added a tablespoon of the sugar to the yeast mixture in the beginning, and I hand kneaded everything (for personal preference only. I know I always tend to over knead when using my kitchenaid.) I was able to get 12 buns very easily out of this recipe. I made a test batch tonight to see if they would be worthy of serving for my husband's bbq this weekend and these did not disappoint!  I will be making 4 more batches of these for Saturday! They were sturdy, but not quite a hard roll. They were delightfully chewy, not crumbly at all, and still soft enough to be easy on the jaw muscles, but not soft like those store brand packaged hamburger buns. These will definitely be able to withstand soaking up some juices from the meat without turning to mush.  So happy I stumbled upon this recipe!!

This recipe was delicious and surprisingly easy. I let it rise an hour both times and made 12 buns. The buns were still huge! I definitely could have made more with the dough. I also skipped the egg wash this time... Will make again if I have extra time.

I signed up just so I could post a comment about Chef John's hamburger buns. I just took these out of the oven and the smell in my house right now is incredible. I've been searching for a staple bun recipe for quite a few years and now I've finally found it. Just remember you don't need a stand mixer to do these, the recipe is completely do-able without one. I added just enough flour so it wasn't sticking to my hands while I was kneading (The dough was just as soft and easy to work with)I did drop the sugar down to about a tablespoon and a half and didn't find it sweet. I'm going to try this recipe with all the sugar for cinnamon buns. I'm so happy I finally found my staple bun recipe! Thank you Chef John!

I made these buns in a bread machine, and they came out perfect. I proofed the yeast as directed, and added the egg etc to the proof, put it in the machine and added 3 cups of flour on top. Separated them and cooked them in the oven.  They came out perfect. I've never made buns this way, but I'm sold on the process.

Very good results with these. Very tasty and the finished product looks professional. I found that a pound of  flour was a bit light. 510 grams was the sweet spot when the dough stopped sticking to the mixer bowl for me. Four hours is a long time but if you're in a hurry try Red Star Platinum yeast. With its dough conditioners you don't need a first rise Just let the dough rest for 15 minutes, cut and shape. They'll rise to baking size in about an hour for a total prep time of under 2 hours. At 8 buns I call these kaisers. 12 makes a burger bun in this house.

In one word PERFECTION.

Small tip as soon as you take the buns out off  the oven cover them with a towel for 15 minutes and it will make them more fluffy .

Thanks for this great recipe and video.

Perfect!  Texture, taste, appearance.  I will never buy buns again.  Little, big they are perfect every time. I even forgot to flour the tops before the second rise and they were still, Perfect!

I made these following the recipe ALMOST word for word. I used bread flour instead of all purpose (things always seem less dense when I use bread flour in yeast bread recipes) and changed the order I added the ingredients. In a stand mixer I added the sugar, warm water, and yeast. After it's foamy I add about 2 cups of the bread flour, the egg, butter, salt, and oil. I use a bread hook and slowly add more flour until the dough pulls away from the sides. After letting the mixer knead the dough for 6 minutes I let it rise and formed little dough balls. I did NOT flatten them, as I like less flat buns. Other than the  bread flour substitute, the order I added the ingredients, and not flattening the dough balls, I did everything word for word. I would dock a point for the dough ball formation technique being confusing, but it's a difficult technique to explain through text. I would search youtube for "how to shape a bread boule" as that would be an easier to understand presentation.

Absolutely perfect and easy peasy.  Beautiful crumble.   I used less sugar than called for and made 8 buns.  Held up nicely to our black and blue Bubbaburgers.

This recipe is just as easy as everyone has said. I followed it exactly as written which is very unusual for me as I am always tweeking here and there. I do not eat refined sugars or corn syrup and almost every bread and especially buns have one or both. This recipe allowed me to substitute my xylatol for the small amount of sugar. They tasted amazing. I was short on time, poor planning, and only let them rise for one hour instead of two, however, I still got amazing buns. They were on our plates or in our mouthes in under three hours. My husband was so impressed he had to take a picture. This will be my go recipe for hamburger and hotdog buns!

I am rather new to the bread making world and it was my awesome stand mixer that even got me started (I had been drooling over one for a long time).  I do not have a bread maker so this was followed from the beginning and they turned out AMAZING!  The texture is perfect- light and springy inside.  I agree that the size is on the larger bun size (think more Kaiser roll size if you keep it at 8 servings).  It was fine this time because they are for pulled pork; however, next time I will probably increase yield.  The one thing I used to avoid the bottom burning was my Air cookie sheets!

I am by no means skilled in the kitchen. My two year old daughter and I took this on as a Sunday project. It took a lot of time but well worth it! They turned out amazing!! Will save this recipe for sure.

Best recipe I have ever tried.  This is a wonderful compliment to the hamburger.  Love the bread and texture.  I didn't rise twice and was still very happy with the bun. Might even try it with cinnamon rolls.

I cut the sugar in half and they were just right.  I let the bread machine do most of the work using the dough setting. My family and I loved, loved, loved the results!  Their only complaint was that there weren't more buns to eat.  We will definitely be using this easy recipe for hamburger and hotdog buns from now on.  Thank you very much for sharing this excellent recipe.

My hamburger buns didn't puff up tall, I think because of the cellophane used to cover it on that last hour of rising. All of my hamburger buns seem kind of flat on top. I definitely will try this recipe again but I'm going to try that final rising without a covering. Other than the shape, these buns are amazing! Can't wait for dinner time.

Seriously the best burger buns ever!  We had them for two days in a row and they were fantastic. I didn't change a thing. They hold up to all kinds of toppings and never get mushy/moist.  This will be a new family favorite!

Nice and fluffy. I haven't made the burgers yet so I haven't actually eaten it. Made 4 servings. Substituted the the water with whey. Mine came out a bit moist but I figured it would be ok after grilling the buns. Will update later. ***UPDATE*** Really good buns.

What an  easy homemade bun recipe! I used instant yeast and they turned out just fine. They were perfectly light and fluffy but sturdy enough to take on the toughest burger. its definetly worth the extra time to make them homemade over the store bought cheap buns. try it!

Yeah! Just made these right now and they are yummy! The only issue I had was there was not enough water at first. I added in half a cup of warm water and then there was too much, so I added in a couple of cups more flower-kneading it in by hand-until I got the sticky but not clingy consistency. I let it rise and all was well. I made a test bun in the oven "hee hee" just to be sure and it was fab. They all came out great. With all the adjustments I ended up with a dozen. My home made sloppy joes are going to be great, thanks John.

Made exactly as stated except made dough in bread machine so picked the directions up at step 7 and skipped the egg wash & sesame seeds. (personal preference - sorry Chef John)
Also rubbed a stick of butter to coat the tops of buns as soon they came out of oven.  Next time I will make 12 buns as these were HUGE.  Also next time I may use the egg wash and sprinkle tops with chopped onion.  They were delish.....thanks Chef John

These came out great, and I've had trouble in the past making good buns.  Watching the video helped! I also used my bread maker for mixing and the first rise. Even my husband liked these, and he usually just likes stuff from the store.

I would make these again, but I would make 10 from the recipe. They aren't real flavorful, just good. After about a day they fall apart. I don't mind that, I don't much like stuff with preservatives. Next time I will add some whole wheat flour.

I took the advice of another reviewer and performed step 1 in my bread maker.  After 15 min. I performed steps 2-6 all using my bread maker on the dough setting.  When the dough was ready, I continued with the final steps as written.  So easy, and the finished product was very good!  I sprinkled sesame seeds on 1/2 of the buns and onion chips on the rest.  Toasting the buns before assembling the burger set it off just right!  Will make again and again.  Some time in the future, I plan to shape them into hotdog buns and sprinkle with poppy seeds for some awesome Chicago hotdogs!

Love love love this recipe! I reduced the initial rising time by putting the dough in the oven (with it cool) and simply turn on the light inside the oven to allow it to rise in a "warm room".
Have tried with and without the eggwash, either result was delicious, but I always omit sesame seeds so that made it easier I'd wager to omit.

Have also scaled this recipe up by quadrupling amounts, also worked perfectly as long as I made the buns in batches. Thank you for this keeper/go-to!!

tried this recipe and made an average bun with average texture and little taste.  The egg was a medium but can't imagine that would make the difference between an average bun and a really good one.  Will keep looking.

I am looking for a recipe for rye hamburger buns. If I use this recipe what proportion of rye flour should be used?
