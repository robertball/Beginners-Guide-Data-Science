I've never made soup before, much less manhattan clam chowder. So I took some of the advice of the reviewers and added some things.  If I hadn't added anything, it would've been extrememly bland.  So here's what I did:  I replaced the water with chicken broth, added another can of clams, added about 2.5 fl oz of Worchestire sauce ( I love the zest it gave it) some Old bay seasoning (About 2 tsp.) added celery, and 3 cloves of freshly minced garlic.  It was to die for, and I didn't even have leftovers!  You may want to add more or less seasoning and worchestire sauce over the cooking period.  I let it cook for about 45 mins and didn't have to mash the vegetables.

Yummy.  I made some changes and ended up with wonderful.  I added celery and some hot sauce per other reviewer's comments.  I sauted the carrot, onion, & celery. I used chicken broth in place of the water and used unpeeled sliced red potatoes. Finally, I added 1 cup V8 low sodium juice and ommited the salt.

REALLY GREAT RECIPE AND EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. THE ONLY THING THAT I CHANGED WAS TO ADD MORE CLAMS AND AN EXTRA CAN OF DICED TOMATOES. SERVED IT AT  DINNER PARTY AND ALL THE GUESTS RAVED.

This was really BLAND when prepared as directed but was an ok starting point.  Added worchestershire sauce, a couple of tablespoons of salsa (did not have any hot sauce), a bullion cube, a bit of tomato sauce,Old Bay Seasoning, garlic, basil, celery, and green pepper before I got the desired results.  Think that 2 cans of tomatoes would be too much of a good thing and that the chowder should be simmered for at least an hour.

Great recipe. Tried it tonight and had to force myself to stop. I added a third can of clams and two cans of tomatoes. Also I had hot sauce available for those who wanted it. A small amount gave it just the right amount of "zing". Will definitely make this again and again.

I made it Seafood Chower: I sauteed celery, onion and carrots. I substituted chicken broth for the water. Added the worcestershire as suggested by others. I kept the thyme, potatoes and can of tomatoe as ordered. Threw in a few bay leaves. Added (pre cooked, canned) clams, shrimp, crab, and corn and threw raw salmon fillet into the broth/veggie mixture.  I let the filet cook in the pot with the broth and once the salmon was cooked it was done. FANTASTIC! Im not a cook obvioulsy, so if it sounds impromptu, it is. But it turned out wonderful!

I really liked it, very similar to my nana Brenda's old recipe. Added some bacon to it as well because that's what she used to do, and I am a carnivore extraordinaire, and it turned out well, despite the fact I have simmered it for too long. A bay leaf is really good in there too; you only need one.

I'm from RI and I finally found a wonderful Chowda recipe.  I loved it so much I'm buying the ingredients for my 3 sons along with an immersing blender as a Christmas gift..  This recipe is super.  I will continue to buy the Bar Harbor minced clams along with their clam juice.  That was also top notch.

Recipe turned out great, I added a small can of V-8 and a little more thyme. Probably could have used a little Tabsco, not a lot. This goes in the cook book for sure. A. G. Seither

Great base recipe for traditional clam chowder and only minor changes needed to give it a little more umph!  Used chicken broth in place of water, sauteed veggies first in small amount of olive oil to soften, added finely diced celery, celery leaves from one stalk, and a bay leaf, plus a few dashes of ground cayenne.  Added fresh chopped parsley at end with clams just before serving.  Too salty as written - will reduce salt next time.

I made this recipe with a few minor changes: I used 3 cans CHOPPED clams; added 2 stalks of celery, chopped; 1 teaspoon of Oregano; a sprinkle of Red Pepper Powder;  Omitted the water and used 1-8 oz. bottle of Clam Juice. 
I just dumped everything in at once and simmered for about 45 min.  And didn't mash. YUMMY!!

Excellent soup. Made some mostly quantity changes but at the end, just before adding the clams, I ground up all the veggies with an immersion blender. I also used all clam juice. Turned out thick and very tasty!!

Very good!  Fairly quick, basic recipe.  Pretty much followed recipe as written.  Instead of mashing veggies, just thickened with a little corn starch & water.  Will make again!

I did not have time to make many changes. My husband had 3 bowls, I had 2, and even my 7 yr old and 2 year old loved it! I would say it was a success. I like simple and good...works for this busy homeschooling mom. Thanks!

I love this! This soup is so easy and fun and delicious. I added a little bit of cayenne pepper and followed a few other reviewed suggestions, which is why it only has 4 stars. I'll be making this in the future many times, I'm sure. Thank you so much for it!

Recipe is a good starting point.  I added a half can of beef stock, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, basil, one minced garlic clove, bay leaf, some corn, 1/4 sugar, and 2 stalks of chopped celery.  Tastes great!

This was excellent.  I made it with 3 cans of clams and it was really too many - 2 cans probably would have been fine.  I also added 2 stalks celery chopped up, and 3 cloves crushed garlic.  Next time I will probably also add a bay leaf or two, and possibly fill the clam stock to 3 cups with white wine instead of regular water.

I simmerred with the lid off - this lead to thicker consitency than I think I would have gotten with the lid on.

I think this would make an excellent base recipe for any chowder.  Next time, I will try it with fresh calamari and large shrimp.

Pretty good.  I used less thyme, added another can of minced clams, & substituted crushed tomatoes for the diced.  I didn't bother mashing the vegetables & it was fine.

Excellent recipe but I made a couple of changes to suit my spicy palette. I added 1 tsp of old bay seasoning, 2 hot peppers, 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1 bottle of Bar Harbor clam broth instead of water, 8 oz of chirizo and 1 lb of fresh chopped clams because they are readily available in MA. I highly recommend the basic or modified version of this recipe. Yum!

Made it with one change added more celery. Seemed to need longer cooking time to get the potato less hard. Elevation may have been a factor as I am at 4100 feet. Taste was great and you can spice it up if you choose.

This is a good base recipe.  I am rating this 5 stars with my additions.  I added celery and garlic, sauted them for about 5 minutes with the carrots and onions. Added chicken broth instead of water, old bay seasoning and the rest of the ingredients.   I didn't mash the vegetables because I like them whole.  I also added 2 bay leaves and let it simmer until the vegetables were cooked.  Very tasty.

This soup is excellent.  I did make some changes.  I used chicken stock instead of water and added celery and two cloves of garlic smashed.  I also added old bay, pepper sauce, a dash of Bragg's liquid aminos and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  I did not smash the veggies and cooked only until potatoes and carrots were just cooked, but still firm.  I hate soft mushy veggies.  My soup was delightfully flavorful and had just enough heat to make it interesting.  Next time I will add a third can of clams.

I love Manhattan Chowder but this recipe was not my favorite for two reasons: it was fairly bland/boring (but still turned out good); it took WAY longer to soften the potatoes (I should've cut them smaller), though I cut them to a "chowder size" I thought. I also added tobasco and squeezed some lime which made it pretty good. I may or may not make this again but will keep it on hand for a back-up meal when I don't feel like or have the time to do a lot of cooking/preparation.... I may try it again with some of the suggestions from the other reviews. Thanks for posting!

This is an easy and very good way to prepare chowder.  I did use chicken broth instead of water and added celery as suggested, it turned out soo good.  I will make this on a regular basis.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made. I added old bay seasoning, garlic, celery, carrots, added extra minced clams, and substituted the water for chicken stock. Made it so much more flavorful! Everyone was raving!

Delicious! a hit with my family. I thought it was not bland at all, with the black pepper and thyme and a pinch of salt! I have made it 4x already, sometimes with celery too. (Also, I HAVE had this type of soup before, in a can - of course this tastes even better!)

Make this for my Pop's birthday.  Tasty broth.  I did add a few thing based on other reviews.  Added the following:
1 more can tomatoes & clams.  
Used wine instead of water.  
1 Sazon seasoning packet.  Don't forget hot sauce.
Enjoy!

I made 1/2 of the recipe.  I had extra clam juice in the fridge so I ended up with approx 1 cup clam juice and 1/2 cup water.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that were seasoned with oregano, basil, and garlic.  I think if you did not have the extra clam juice and seasonings the recipe would be really bland.  This is a very easy recipe.

The flavor was a little lacking, so I used a bit more thyme, a dash of cayenne and some oregano. I also used some celery. Next time I will add more clams. On the whole it was pretty good, and I will most definitely make it again.

I was reluctant at first to make such a huge amount without trying it first.  But figured I’d try it anyway.  Soooo glad I did.  Although I added more clams.

This was delicious!  We love clam chowder but cannot have the heavy cream anymore so this was an excellent fix! We used a bit more liquid (chicken broth because we didn't buy enough clam juice) because we prefer more broth.  This is in my favorites now and we will have it often!

This  was quick, easy and delicious.  I did add a stalk of chopped celery.   While chopping the vegetables, I cooked two slices of bacon.  After the bacon was browned, I cooked the veggies in the bacon grease until glazed, and pan drippings loosened from the bottom of the pan.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients and simmered until the veggies were tender.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and used the garlic and Worcestershire sauce.  With this change, I liked the soup but didn't love it. I feel like it still needed something.  Not sure if I'll ever made it again, my husband strongly disliked it.

Outstanding recipe. I made the following changes: doubled the amount tomatoes including some original rotel (adds a little spice!) and doubled the potatoes. I also cooked some bacon, well done, and sprinkled bacon pieces over the top at serving time.

Very good, I added half a pound of bacon and doubled everything but the clams. Probably great with more clams. I also added a little aniseed. I'll definitely make this again.
