I have loved this recipe for years and years.  I agree with supplementing the apple mixture with additional spices such as nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, etc.  The trick to keep the batter from getting too runny is to soften the butter, not melting it.  My "secret weapon" with this recipe is a teaspoon of almond extract in the batter - this takes an already easy delicious recipe over the top.

This is a five star recipe if you read all the reviews.  Thats what I did. I then combined the winners and the result was a huge hit last night.  Since it was more like a cobbler and my group was 10 I used a rectangle casserole pan and 1 1/2 times the recipe. My pan was an 8x9 with probably a 1 1/2" side. If you use a 9x12 pan you need to double the recipe. For apples. 7 medium granny smith. I peeled sliced and dropped along the way into a bowl of water and lemon juice.  This keeps the apples white while you peel. I mixed 1 tablespoon white sugar, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nut meg. After draining and drying of a bit of excess water with a paper towel from the apples I sprinkled and glazed them with the mixture and poured them into a bare pan.  For topping the trick is to not over melt the butter.  Just soften the butter.  Wisk 1 egg, 1.5 cups flour, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  Add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/5 tsp nutmeg. Mix these altogether. Since the topping is not pourable just a large clump at a time of topping and then spread as evenly as possible over apples.  It will spread out perfectly while baking.  Bake at same temperature and time or until golden brown.  The top comes out crispy.  Since there is no pie shell you don't need to treat your casserole pan with butter or oils.  Every drop comes out of the pan without sticking.  Treating it would just make the dish too buttery.  It was wonderul and devoured.  It was better than a cob

EASY and delicious!  Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I added a bit more flavor to the apples.  I mixed in 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and ¼ teaspoon of ground nutmeg with the 1 tablespoon of white sugar--tossing all with the apples.  You may want to put a pan or piece of aluminum foil underneath the pie plate in the oven, as some juices from the apples escaped during baking.  I served the pie warm, with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  Yum!

Wow, one of the easiest and best recipes I have come across. My friends have declared it one of their favourites! For those of you who want an extra crunchy crust, use brown sugar, it's fantastic.

I have to agree with Justa' Mom. It was good but needs more flavor. I am going to make again but will try some adjustments.

This was amazing. I did not have any problems with the crust getting hard. Very moist, in fact. I added some extra sugar to toss the aples b/c my experience has proven granny smith's to be a little bitter... I personally do not even like apple pie but made this for my family and fell in love with it when I tried it.

well now--I wish I had come across this wonderful recipe a long time ago! I seriously dislike regular pie crust,& I prefer an apple pie without any brown sugar- so this is the pie for me!! I made it in a 9x9 corningware casserole dish & it turned out very well. filled it 3/4 full with apples(then tossed with the sugar) then put the topping on. My topping turned out like a not sticky soft cookie dough that was easier to spread on the apples with my hands than with a spatula. Had to bake it almost 20 minutes longer until the center was done & crisp but that's probably because of the baking dish I used.   VERY TASTY & it made me SMILE when I tasted it. =D     Besides the tastiness, the bonuses for me were that it was super easy (I was lucky enough to be gifted an apple peeler & corer) and my house smells amazing

VERY GOOD!  Big hit at Thanksgiving this year!  I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and changed 2 of the instructions/ingredients as follow:  for the filling I mixed 1T of brown sugar, 1t cinnamon and a bit of fresh nutmeg together with the 1T granulated sugar and then tossed it all with the apples.  For the crust, I used softened instead of melted butter and I substitued one-half cup light brown sugar for one-half cup of the the granulated sugar.  Baking time was about perfect at 45 min.

This is absolutely delicious!  I've made it several times and am staying with my sister this weekend, and she's requested I make it.  You can't go wrong with this pie.  I agree with others:  add a tiny bit of nutmeg to the mixture for coating the apples, and you can "adjust" the sugar to 1/4 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar for a total of 3/4 cup, which is plenty.  Enjoy!

I was attracted to this because it didn't require a rolled piecrust (one thing I've never mastered and I "don't do" store-bought). Before trying this recipe I read the reviews and as others suggested, made modifications to the seasonings. Rather than just using white sugar for tossing the apples, I used 1 tbsp. each white & brown sugar, 1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 3/8 tsp. nutmeg. I used about half of this mixture for tossing the apples, then added the rest to the crust mixture. As for the apples, I used a wonderful variety, Wolf River, available in the Upper Midwest and New York State, though perhaps not common in much of the country. It's a fairly tart apple and the individual fruits are HUGE - some can weigh as much as a pound. I only needed two apples to make the pie. The results were terrific! (though I did increase the baking time slightly to 50 minutes... just know your oven, check near the end of the cooking time, and adjust accordingly). This recipe is one that I'll use often... in fact, hubby has already requested that I make it again next week! My heartfelt thanks to the person who originally submitted it.

I've been searching for a swedish apple pie recipe to teach my kid to bake. This is almost exactly like the one I learned when I was little. Easy for kiddos to do pretty much by themselves, and absolutely delicious! I used a bit less cinnamon than called for, and my hubby (who doesn't do desserts) was begging for it to be a regular menu item. :)

I doubled this recipe but I only used 3 apples.  Used margarine right out of the fridge too instead of melted butter, and mixed the soft dough with my hands.  Was so easy and produced a perfect apple pie that does not stick!  I will definately make this instead of ever buying an apple pie again.  However, next time I will not put so much cinammon in the batter!!

This pie is a great way to avoid all the hassle associated with pie crust. If you prefer a crunchy crust you cook it a little longer but be careful not to overcook it because then you'll end up with a crust that is too hard and you can't blame it on the recipe if that happens.  I added 1/2 tsp more of cinnamon and decided to include 1/2 tsp each of  cloves and nutmeg to spice it up a bit. The results were delicious. This pie is so easy to make that it's practically fool proof. Try it and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised that something so tasty can also be so easy.

This recipe is one of my all time in a pinch desert recipe. I add cinnamon to the apples mixture as well, as my family loves cinnamon anything. I have made this recipe with pears (precooked), peaches (canned and precooked), and various berries in place of the apples. I have noticed it needs about five more minutes in higher elevations, but is fine at 40 minutes near sea level. In general a wonderful all around desert recipe.

Not bad, but just like somebody else said: this is apples with a giant cookie on top. I reduced the sugar in half and it still was pretty sweet. Although, I didn't use granny smiths.

It tastes better when cold.  It must be refrigerated because of the egg though so be careful.  Wasn't as good as my apple crumble so I don't think I'll make it again.

I've never eaten or made a Swedish Apple Pie before, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought the crust would be crumbly, but it's more like a cobbler. Sooo yummy. This was super good and way easy to make. I also had all the ingredients, so I'll probably fall back on this recipe a lot. Another plus is the cooking time isn't long in comparison to other's I've seen. I served mine with vanilla ice cream...  Mmmmm, I want more right now! Thank you!

Delicious! I incorporated reviewers' advice and made the following changes:
- Added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the apples
- In the crust, replaced half the regular sugar with brown, and added a splash of almond extract. I also used oil instead of butter and it was fine. 
Thanks for a winner.

Best apple pie! I've made this for years and it continues to be one of my favorites. Absolutely delicious and easy! Instead of straight white sugar, I use 1 part brown sugar and 2 parts sugar for topping--gives it more richness, flavor, moister and density. Excellent either way though!

This is so good!  I'll not mess with making crust for apple pie ever again. I did use the Grany Smiths and added a T each of brown and white sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples. I like it sweet. I didn't use the spices in the crust. I threw in a handful of Crasins too. I think this is much better than cobbler with the crunchy and flavorful "crust". Thanks to the contributor.

I think this recipe would have been perfect if I wouldn't have put a full teaspoon of almond extract in per other review. It was over powering to me. Next time, I'll put maybe a 1/4 teaspoon in. I will definitely make it again!

This  Is my first time I have stopped to rate a recipe. I have been told I make the best apple pie that they have tasted. But this recipe is equal to my best apple pie if not better. I did follow the recipe 99% as the recipe called for. The only thing I did as other Reviewers suggested  was I added an extra quarter teaspoon of cinnamon to the 1 teaspoon, 2 teaspoons would of taken away of the apples it would of been too much of a cinnamon taste instead of complementing the apples. I also just soften the butter instead of melting it and I added a good half a cup of chopped pecans to it to give it an extra texture. So instead of pouring the topping on I was able to Pat and cover all the apples dealing  in the juices. The pie  came out perfect. To cut some calories without any sacrifice of taste, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar then a good pinch of regular dark brown sugar as I used 7 Granny Smith apples. I have an automatic apple peeler, corer n slicer .  I make so many apple desserts and applesauce , it is a must in my kitchen. Judi Hill Port Charlotte FL

Oh yes, I tried this recipe and BOY am I glad! Took some ideas and added almond extract to the batter with a little spice (cinnamon and nutmeg). This tastes like a wonderful apple pie without making a traditional crust with all it's the mess! I used the bowl I mixed the apple slices in to also beat up the batter (after pouring apple slices into the greased pie dish),easier clean-up! The crust was a little thick, so dollop it on then spread, but the heat evens it all out. It comes out sweet and slightly crunchy YUM! It is definitely a sweet dessert, but my tart apples needed that!

This is much easier and way more delicious than any pastry apple pie.  The crust is crunchy and soft at the same time, with the perfect sweetness to complement the tart apples.  The first time I made it the apples practically disintegrated, so I cut them a little thicker the second time.  I also spread the topping so that it didn't go all the way to edge.  This kept it from getting too thin, hard and brown right at the edge.  My search for the perfect apple dessert is over.

Sooo easy and sooo good. I used a 9X9 pan, so I multiplied the recipe by 1-1/2 (that built-in calculator on the site is so very handy). I did use 1/4 less sugar, in the batter, because I don't like things too sweet.    I love apple pie and this  one is so much easier than the traditional style, made with piecrust.  The most time was spent peeling and slicing the apples, which you gotta do anyway.  Followed others' ideas, adding a little cinnamon (and a little ginger and just a pinch of cloves) and I doubled the sugar I sprinkled on the apples.

I love this recipe and make it pretty frequently. I like it with Fujis, but it's a great way to use up apples that have gone a little too soft to eat. I always add some apple or pumpkin pie spice and cloves to the apples and the batter mix. Last time I made it, it was gone in 10 minutes!

Sure is easy and quick to make. Since I found this recipe, I've baked the pie at least 5 times, mixing various apples. The original recipe is excellent, but doing half Fuji and half Granny Smith apples is just as good, not as tart with every bite.  I've also done this recipe with Goldens and it was also tasty. Great recipe, yum yum.

This was good, but I think if I make it again, I would use pie filling. The apples kind of dried out while baking. Using pie filling would also eliminate all the peeling/chopping, thus making it one of those SUPER easy desserts!

This pie tasted good hor from the oven, but once it was refrigerated for the next day, the top crust was as hard as a rock and even microwaving it didnt help. I'll stick to the old fashion crust pie.

I thought this was fantastic. More like apple dumplings maybe, but still excellent. I've made it several times, I do put a bit of cinnamon in the apples in addition to the crust, but I'm silly about cinnamon. I am disabled and don't have the stamina for a conventional apple pie, but I could handle this just fine.Thanks for posting this recipe!!

My family loved this recipe so much I had to make two! I followed what other reviewers said and added 1 tablespoon of white sugar, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.  Even my sister who doesn't like apple pie was telling me over and over how she loved the crust.  Will definitely use again.

My family loved it at Thanksgiving.  Made it gluten free, and was a little concerned by how it looked, but that is not the recipe's fault.  Seems like a pretty solid variation to apple pie.

This pie is amazing!  I do not like pie of any sort and then I took a bite of this pie and it won me over.  The crunchy topping is a nice touch.  My son loved this pie so much that he did not want a cake for his birthday...he wanted this pie instead!  The recipe is perfect as is...I made no changes.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I had a bottom crust that I wanted to use before it expired so after I made the filling I simply poured it in on top of the crust and then followed the rest of the directions for the topping. My husband LOVED it! How can you not love food that has a stick and a half of butter in it! I melted the butter as the recipe stated and the topping set very well.

Delicious!!!  I made it exactly like the recipe, except for substituting Splenda for half of the sugar, and adding 1/4 tsp of cardamom to the dough (just because cardamom is such a Swedish sort of spice...), and it turned out wonderfully.  My daughter's boyfriend is Swedish, and she says this is very like the apple pie he made when she visited him in Sweden this summer.

Loved this! Much simpler than messing around with a crust for traditional apple pie. Although traditional apple pie will still have its place, this is much easier and delicious. My husband was quite impressed as were all three kids (ages 7, 5 and 2). I did add half brown/half white sugar to the apples along with cinnamon. I made the topping with half brown/half white sugar also and added a little almond extract as another reviewer suggested. Making it again today to take to my brother and sister-in-law as they just moved to a new house so we'll see how they like it.

OMG thank you for this,  it is soooo easy and my grand daughter (an apple pie nut!) loves it.  I do put a little cinnamon in with the apples,  as well as brown sugar instead of white sugar to toss.  ANd I substitute half white and have brown sugar for the topping.  Thank you for sharing this tasty, fast, and easy recipe!

I was skeptical, but since I had to prepare dessert for a potluck I had committed to weeks ago, and I had a bagful of old apples in my fridge and not much else, I took a shot at this recipe. I used brown sugar and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples and the crust, used the measurements times 1.5, made it in a casserole dish, and it turned out to be delicious!!!  I'm keeping this recipe- why ever make 'traditional' apple pie??

Hmmm. it just seemed to good to be true. I tried this cause i wanted apple pie but i was too lazy to make one. this one seemed easy. i cooked it for about 15 minutes longer, but the batter never firmed up. There was just a thin crunchy top, the rest was just batter really. The bottom was very soggy. I give it some stars cause it didnt tase bad, but i can not serve this to my guests...ever...

I can't thank you enough for posting. My mother gave to me years ago. She passed away 2 years ago and I lost the recipe. This is the best apple pie to make especially for friends. Easy, quick and not much mess at all. I never have leftovers!

Although this recipe does not call for a pie crust, I added one and used this as the filling, and it tasted delicious. I'm sure it would taste delicious even without it.

Loved this pie! Simple ingredients and amazing crust over top of the pie that is not soggy but really quite hearty and crunchy ish. By far the best apple pie I've had. We did add some cinnamon sugar sprinkled on the top before baking which was a great addition.

So easy and fabulous taste!  I used 3/4 stick margarine and added cinammon to apples!!!!!  Crust nice and crunchy with less butter/margarine.  I also cut apples in larger slices and they did real well!!!!! This is a keeper!

Really enjoyed this "pie."  I had to bake it 15 minutes longer than the recipe called because the center was still quite doughy.  However, it tasted great, had a nice crunchy cookie-like top.  The only comment I have to the recipe was that I thought the apples could have been a bit sweeter.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will either add a bit more sugar or include other sweeter apples in with the tart apples.

Amazing. I wanted to make an apple pie but didn't feel like dealing with the dough and rolling it out and everything. This pie was just as delicious if not more so than a regular apple pie. I ran out of flour while I was mixing the batter, and all I had was some apple cinnamon muffin mix. I ended up using about 1/2 cup of the muffin mix and 1/2 cup flour, but it actually turned out very well. Highly recommend this recipe.

Kind of weird texture, but quite yummy.  Flavor is wonderful.  I am a big apple pie a la mode person, but I actually prefer this without ice cream.  Already had two pieces. :-)

Everybody loved it!  I used half white and half whole wheat flower, and unsalted butter.  I forgot to add the salt but it turned out great anyway.  I think this work well with other fruits like apricot etc.  I will make it again.

This is a nice easy recipe and that was why I chose it. I accidentally grabbed the nutmeg instead of cinnamon and that didn't hinder the flavor at all! I did eventually put in cinnamon. I wound up thinking the amount of crust wouldn't be enough, (since it was thick and not loose and really spreadable), so I made more crust with oil instead of butter.  Now I'm wondering if that made a difference in the texture of the crust. It wasn't firm all the way through. Overall, it is very tasty.

By far, the easiest, most delicious apple dessert I ever had.  I did take advice from others and added cinnamon and brown sugar to apples.

This was pretty good! I used a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and honey crisp apples (yummy!) It was good without any bottom crust! The topping turns out to be pretty soft . My only recommendation would be to add more sugar/cinnamen to the apply mix. I'd make it again!

Didn't feel like making a crust so i went looking for something else.  This was wonderful.  I added extra spices(preference)and topped pre-baked with sliced almonds.  Compliments to the chef!

I read the reviews first - then made the pie (to get tips).  I have to say that I've never baked a pie and this recipe - will be an ongoing favorite in our home for years.  It's so easy, that I involved my 2 girls (4 & 11) to each make one (measure, beat/stir, peeling the apples, etc).  WE LOVED IT.  I used more sugar than the recipe called for (1/4 cup each of white and brown) and it was PERFECT.  We picked our Granny Smith apples from an orchard here in town and that made it all the more special.  In the crust topping - I also added Vanilla Extract (didn't have any Almond on hand).  Made two at a time and it was GREAT.  Make sure the topping isn't too wet and you clump it on top of the apples.  We had one wet and one clumpy.  We thought they both were good - however, the clumpiest was a bit better.  Thank you for all the reviews. Have fun making this and ENJOY!

This was an interesting recipe. I definitely agree with other reviewers about the need for additional spice. I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg in the crust; 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/3 or so tsp allspice, 1 T. white sugar and 1 T. brown sugar for the apples. We're cinnamon freaks, so that might be a bit much for others. I followed the advice of earlier bakers and only softened my butter rather than melting it; I ended up having to press my batter piecemeal into the pan to create the top crust. As the recipe specified, I didn't put in a bottom crust, and while it definitely made things easier, it was a bit odd when people ate it. In some ways, this was almost a cobbler rather than a pie. It's a nice change, though, with a couple of minor additions - and a lot easier than wrestling with pie crusts! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this and brought it to a dinner party and everyone LOVED it! It was super good. I did make a few adjustments though. I added a LOT of extra sugar (the apples were off our own trees and are REALLY tart) and a little bit of nutmeg. Once I had slathered on the sauce, I alternated layers of raw sugar and oatmeal. This made it have a nice crumbly "crust" on top & it looked awesome! Thanks for the recipe - I will make this again!

Delicious!  I softened the butter instead of melting it.  I added 1 T. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 T. brown sugar & 1 T. white sugar to the sliced apples.  Also added cinnamon to the topping.  It was very good & I think you could reduce the sugar in the topping -- it's pretty sweet.

What a great recipe.  I was looking for an easy apple pie recipe and came across this one.  I love it.  I did as others suggested and added 1 TBSP brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamom to the apples.  The apples were still a little tart, so next time I make it, I'll add more sugar.  I think using apple pie spice would be great too.  I also used the brown and white sugar in the topping.  It was crunchy, chewy.......and so yummy!!  I'm making this instead of apple pie for Thanksgiving this year!!

This is really yummy!!  I used Macintosh apples because we picked them fresh.  I also cut the butter down to one stick (1/2 cup).   The best part is that it is so easy to make!  You can just whip it up before dinner to serve warm afterwards (with vanilla ice cream, of course!)

As many other reviewers did, I adjusted the recipe to add flavor. Tossed 6 very thinly sliced apples with sugar & cinnamon, and placed in two pie plates (one 9-inch and one smaller, 7-8 inch). For the crust, I used 2/3 c. white and 1/3 c. brown sugar, 2/3 c. flour and 1/3 c. graham cracker crumbs, just-melted butter (closer to softened than liquid), nutmeg, and cinnamon. I had enough topping to spread over both pies (thinly), and cooked them together for only 30 min. The apples were very soft (almost like apple sauce), the crust was crunchy, and it was perfect-- not too sweet, not too tart-- and I have enough for home *and* to take to work. Thanks!

This was good. I made it with half Granny smith and half Fugi and it tasted great. It was still tart, but it's complemented well by the crust.

I also put a thin layer of crust on the bottom and it turned out beautifully!

I made it yesterday. I replaced half of the sugar with brown sugar to get a nice dark color. I added the spices like most of the reviews advise and also some powdered vanilla. My batter ended up quite thick to the point where I could not "pour" it on the apples so I got adventurous and added three table spoons of low fat milk. I let it cooked for 20 minutes longer than on the recipe and it ended up beautifully! Nice and crunchy on the edges and "flan" like inside. Not liquid at all... I'll definitely make it more often and bring it to work. It's very easy!

I love this recipe but it does get a bit bland if you follow the directions exactly.  Luckily, I'm a cinnamon fanatic so I actually mix in a teaspoon of sugar (or Slenda) with a teaspoon of cinnamon in my apples.  I also replace the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon with either a full tablespoon of cinnamon or 2 teaspoons of cinnamon with 1/3 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a teaspoon of vanilla.  It gives more flavor.  I also take a very small amount of the batter and spread it on the bottom of my pan to give it a cake-like crust before adding the apples to the pan.

This was excellent! Everyone enjoyed this. It was very easy, I wasn't rolling out anything.  I added some more cinnamon and nutmeg when tossing the apples.  I used 4 large apples and the amount was perfect.  Try this one!

this was a massive hit at a dinner party on the weekend, and it was really easy to make...
i agree with pavonee about adding  one tbsp of cinnam. 1 tbsp of white sugar,1 tbsp of brown sugar and nutmeg in the apples before putting on the crust. I also put 1/2 cup of white sugar and supplemented with 1/2 cup of brown sugar...just adds that extra bit of brilliance.

Made this for christmas eve desert and everyone enjoyed it!  I loved the tartness from the granny smith apples mixed with the sweet sugar. I added extra cinnamon and a little brown sugar, too. Great easy apple pie alternative with no crust to roll out!

Very delicious recipe! I replaced all sugar with brown sugar because that's all I had at hand, and added cinnamon while tossing apples. All my friends loved it.

This was a pretty good pie.  If it wasn't for the topping, it wouldn't have much taste, so I added a pinch of nutmeg and used a bit more brown sugar.

I've made this pie numerous times with great results each time.  Everyone loves the fact that there's no crust to add those extra calories.  The only thing I'm careful about is using my stoneware to bake this in.  It allows the extra moisture from the apples to absorb into the stone - giving you a perfect pie!

I had a few small Granny Smiths leftover from a small bag that I had purchased. Didn't want to toss them out, had never made an apple pie before....don't care much for it. OMG!!!! this has to be the most simple recipe for anything I've ever made. It turned out absolutely wonderful...my apples were very tart, so depending on the taste of future pies I might suggest that more sugar be added to the apples themselves. 
 My biggest surprise was that after the pie cooled when cut it hung together very well while removing it from the glass pie dish.

  AWESOME RECIPE!!!!!

I was looking for a recipe for an apple dessert and was leaning towards apple pie, but didn't want the hassle of making the crust.  This was the perfect solution.  The longest part is peeling the apples, but after that it was super simple.  I shorted the butter by a 1/4 cup and it made the topping a bit crumblier/crisper, but I loved every bite.  The butter melt down into the layers of apples and it's pure deliciousness.  I will definitely save this and make it again!

This was good.  My fiance was a big fan.  I have never eaten pie and always refused it.  I had a small sliver of this and thought it was nice.  Similar to apple crisp, but not as sloppy.

I have made this several times in the last 5 or so years, with different types of apples, and it has never disappointed. My husband compares the crust to a snickerdoodle cookie. So good and so easy.

I greatly enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. I took it to a Thanksgiving dinner and it was the first to go. 

I made a couple of small changes. I threw nutmeg in with the cinnamon. Next time I might add some apple pie spice also. I also use a Pillsbury pie crust in the bottom of the pie plate simply because I already had it. Finally I used half sugar and half brown sugar. Good consistency and nice flavor. Thanks.

SURPRISE! This is easy and delicious. I used a bottom crust and instead of cutting and fluting it, I folded the draped pastry up and over some of the Swedish 'crust', making almost a giant dumpling. It baked beautifully with the pastry crust keeping the apple juices inside. I added a little brown sugar mixed into the apples and used ground clove sparingly in the Swedish crust. The only other change I would  make is to use about 1/2 tsp. of almond extract, if any. One tsp. was too much.

All around great pie for a college student with limited cooking supplies/resources/experience. I have replaced some of the flour with oats when I have them on hand with a fair bit of success.

I love this recipe!!  I made a mistake and put a pie crust on the bottom and it was just wonderful.I also added 1 teaspoon light brown sugar and used 6 apples.  I love the cinnamon crust. The only thing is that it doesn't cook in 40 to 50 minutes.  It took me 1 hour and 15 minutes so it would be crunchy.  But some ovens are different than others.  I have a new oven that seems to take about 10 minutes longer to cook things.

So easy and so tasty!  It's more of a cobbler than a pie, but it's a great tasty way to use up apples.  I added some ground cloves for extra flavor and served with whipped cream. Yum!

This was very good. I agree that it was a bit "soggy" towards the bottom, but delicious! I think the misconception comes in with people thinking it will be more "pie-like" when in fact it comes out more like a cobbler - but tasty all the same! I made for my hubby's bday and he loved it, as did my non-pie-eating son.

It was good however, turned out more like a cobbler instead of pie. Next time, use smaller pan as the batter was thick and did not cover all of the apples even though I used the conversion to accomodate a 10" pan.

This is the easiest pie in the world. I had never made an apple pie but I wanted one for Thanksgiving and this one came out perfect. I did make one change though. I used cinnamon plus (pampered chef version) instead of just cinnamon and I also sprinkled a little cinnamon plus over the apples in addition to the sugar. The crust and apples were perfectly done and the taste was wonderful. So simple too.

My Swedish Grandmother used to make the best apple pie I had ever had. I didn't realize why it was so good until I found this recipe and tried it. AMAZING! Just like grandma used to make.

How can you go wrong with apples, butter, and sugar? It's an easy to make and delicious way to put them all together. I used half brown sugar and half white. A huge hit, so you might want to double the recipe and use a casserole pan!

My husband is also asking me to make this again. I have another one in the oven right now. I added nutmeg and cinnamon to my apples along with the sugar. Without it, I think it wouldn't taste too flavorful. Overall, it's an easy, great recipe!

Made this the other day with fresh-picked apples and it was a huge hit. Have already been asked to make it again today for my family. My two daughters, (1 and 3) loved it. I followed the advice of others with regard to adding cinnamon, etc. and served it with real whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, (or in my case, both-lol).  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Delicious! This pie is very good, though I may put a little more cinnamon in the crust next time. I chopped the apples into bite sized pieces and left the skin on half of them. Yummy!

So easy and so good. Followed the recipe exactly, and it was a perfect apple “cookie cake” (as my son calls it). The apples almost melt away into the pie/cake part.

Made as is pretty much with 2 key changes:  I love buckwheat flour, so I used it.  (It is NOT a pretty dessert made this way!) 
 Also had just baked boozy cranberries with bourbon similar to recipes here, but half the sugar.  I added a cup of those to the pie.  Dash of salt.  The rest was pretty much the same.  Very easy.  Thank you!

I didn't have any nuts on hand so I added about half a cup of homemade granola, very good.  I have also used fresh plums in lieu of apples (plum season huge this year) and 3 tbsp of sugar rather than 1 tbsp as in the recipe.  Also very good!!  This is a great recipe!!

Suggested changes make this a 5 star!  TO THE DRAINED APPLES:  add 1 T. brown sugar along with the 1 T. white sugar  + 1 tsp. cinnamon or apple pie spice. BATTER: Use another 1 tsp. cinnamon or apple pie spice. Use half white & half brown sugar. Butter should be soft, not melted.  Hint: Distribute clumps of batter on apple layer & spread as best you can as it's very sticky! Batter will spread just fine as it cooks. It's delicious & easy!

I have been using this recipe since the mid '80s. A bit less sugar, some nutmeg added to apples and half butter/half oleo are my changes. The baking time can be longer if using oleo. Absolutely the best 'cakey pie' ever! (just made it and can hardly wait for it to cool.)

I have made this twice with years in between the making. Both times it has run over, covering the bottom of my oven with melted butter and filling the room with smoke. I forgot about that happening when I just made it this second time. You must all be using a DEEP dish 9" pie plate? I do like the pie in the end.  I just need to remember to use the bigger pie plate.

Best apple pie ever.  I have been making this since the 70s.   I add chopped walnuts to the spread.  The best part is that it makes it's own crust.  Great served warm and so easy to make.  Everyone loves it.

It was a hit at Thanksgiving. I may use a mixture of apples next time as using all granny smiths was a bit tart for my personal taste. ( The topping was very sweet so it balanced out if you do use all granny smith.)   I did add 1 TB of brown sugar and some spices to my apples before putting them in the pan, as other reviewers suggested.  I used softened butter and not melted butter.  The topping baked into a beautiful cohesive top.   Would make again.

I can't even count how many times I've made this pie at this point! Everyone always loves it and asks me to bring it again next time. (My cousin asked for THREE for Christmas this year!) I love it because the easiness to impressiveness ratio is spot on! Delicious as-is, but I often will add some nutmeg and allspice, or in a hurry a few shakes of Penzey's pie spice, just to spruce it up a little bit. But you can't go wrong with apple, cinnamon, and sugar! And the crush is kind of like a big cookie... Mmm!

I made this as written, but added some cinnamon and maple extract to the apples. I also had more apples that I needed to use. Delicious!! I followed the others who suggested softened (not melted) butter. Next time I will probably use less sugar, it is fairly sweet. I would call this a terrific Apple cobbler.

this recipe is a huge hit! I've been using this recipe for years and it's never failed. You can get creative with it as well, I had some leftover dried cranberries and decided to throw them in with the apples and it was AMAZING ! Another time, I added raisins and cranberries, again...AMAZING! Absolutely a favorite...super easy...never fail!

This was very good. I did make a few changes of course. Firstly, I used whatever apples I had on hand, not Granny Smith. Secondly, I did use a bottom pastry crust but only because I had one in the freezer. After slicing the apples (I DID NOT PEEL THEM) I tossed them with a bit of brown sugar and generous sprinkle of cinnamon. Then made the batter, using Brown Sugar only and slightly less melted butter. It tasted amazing and the top "crust" was beautiful brown and crunchy.

I love this recipe!  It is so easy.  I have made it over and over.  There is only one  substitute that I make! I use Braeburn and Golden Delicious Apples.  Otherwise the recipe is made as is stated.  The only thing that I had reservations about was the topping.  The first time I made the pie, I didn't know how to put the topping on the apples.  It is easiest to take spoonful's of the topping and place it on top of the fruit.  Then I use a pastry knife to spread it evenly (as possible) over the apples.  It will form the "crust" as it cooks.  The slice holds it's shape, even though there is not a bottom crust to hold the slice together!  Delicious!  Not to sweet, but not tart either!

This was an okay apple pie.

I listened to other reviewers and added in spice with the apples themselves and a mix of them to the "crust".

I also added in a tablespoon each of cornflour and chia seeds to the apples as normally there is a lot of juice floating round in this type of recipe. But maybe it is not needed as that layer turned out with very little sauce, maybe the pie crust is meant to soak it up?

I made this for thanksgiving. Used 5  yellow apples with 1 TBS cornstarch . My husband was unsure how people would like a crust less apple pie but everyone loved loved it and out of the 5 pies and cakes this was the only one finished - to the last crumb. I heated it up and served with ice cream . Next time I'll use Granny Smiths , I bet it will be even better. Best way to describe it is oowy goowy goodness!!!

Oct. 8, 2015.  It's apple time again.  This is  one of the easiest and very good  pies to make.  I've made it several times now and  it comes out great every time.  You can even make it with store bought crust, but my own is better.  This house eats a lot of apple pies in the fall and this is one of the best.

I have made this multiple times now, family requests, and will continue to make. Easy and reminds me of apple dumplings but not as much work. I do add cloves & nutmeg and sometimes add raisens or craisens . It makes a little sauce if you add a few spoonsfull of water or apple cider over the apples before adding the topping. This is a keeper. Great served with vanilla ice cream or warm with milk poured over it. YUM YUM

Excellent, will definitely make again.
Added a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to the apples which gave the apples great flavour.

This is not a traditional pie, more like an apple cobbler.  It's so easy to make and tasted much better than I expected.  I used only one Granny Smith apple and the rest were a red apple variety so I could have cut back on the sugar. I baked it for 45 minutes and the filling was still juicy and the crust was still soft.  It did run over the pie plate into the oven so next time I will put something under it.  The taste of the original recipe was fine for me but I might try the changes suggested the next time I make it and I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe!  This recipe also works really well with Asian Pears.  We have Apple and Asian Pear trees and this recipe has become a family favorite.  It is nice to be able to bake an apple pie without having to roll a crust.  Special thanks to Northlake-Kat for her recipe improvements; I also added 1 t. Almond Extract to the crust ingredients.  Thank you!!

Not my favorite. I substituted 2 Splenda packets for the sugar in the topping, which turned out okay but the pie itself is dry. Will likely go back to the old fashioned double crust country apple pie.

I made this a year ago, and it was perfect!
Made it a month later and the topping ran off.
Made it this morning and topping is all over the baking sheet I put down just in case.  What might I have done wrong the latter two times?

Worked fine, I chopped all my apples up small and sifted them with sugar and cinnamon. Just make sure the top spreads, edge to edge. I will not be making it again.

I absolutely love this "pie!" I made it with corn flour instead of all-purpose, and it still tasted amazing! I think the corn flavor actually accented the apples. I'm making it with cake flour right now and hopefully it will turn out as good. I'm going to be making this all the time! 
My husband hates traditional pie because of the crust, and he actually had two pieces when I made this! It's such an easy recipe that I am excited to alter it and see what different combinations will work out. Thank you so much for this recipe!

this pie is much better, when it's cold. :D
I added some cinnamon into the apples and it turned out quite well. but still, I have to say that this wasn't the best pie I've ever eaten. it wasn't bad, just... the taste wasn't perfect... I don't know how to say it. :D it misses something...

I loved this Apple pie as well as everyone in the house. I liked it because I didn't have to make a crust and it tasted wonderful. Everyone else loved the crunchy deliriousness. Easy to make, I just finished making one for Thanksgiving Dinner tomorrow.  Only thing I changed the first time was I used less apples so it would fit in my pie plates.

This is the only apple pie recipe we use! I have been making this easy recipe for years. It is outstanding again and again! Friends & family request me to bring this no matter what time of year it is! It is so easy to make and the house smells incredible! You may wish to make two of them because your family will devour the first one and you will have nothing to bring to your event. :)

I am not a big fan of apple pie by any means. I ran across this recipe while looking for something for my husband who loves apple pie. I gave this a shot and he asks for it all the time, I have made it for holidays and everyone in my family likes it! I don't know how many people have asked for the recipe! I eventually tried it and I even love it! It is soft and sweet. It isn't like your typical apple pie! It is wonderful, I agree with others, it is much like a cobbler... absolutely wonderful!

For an absolute beginner like me, this was an excellent and very easy to follow recipe. I did sprinkle some powder cinnamon to the apples and tossed them with brown sugar, to the batter mix, as suggested I put some vanilla drops and finally sprinkled a bit more cinnamon over it before baking it.  Lovely....

This is great...and easy.  I used way too many apples and should have laid them down neater so it wasn't so lumpy, but that's my fault.  Can't wait to try it again, this time I'll use less apples and be a bit more methodical about it.

I used whole wheat flour bc that is what we had in the house.  I eliminated the sugar in the apples for ease.  It was wonderful and easy.  We took seconds.  Thanks.

I really enjoyed this pie. the only thing I would change is to use more sugar when tossing the apples. I certainly plan to make this pie again and again.

Great recipe I have made for years.  The original recipe calls for 1 cup of chopped walnuts mixed into the crust.  It adds a great flavor and crunch.

Easy enough for my 14 year old daughter to make, great enough for the pickiest apple pie eater I have evr met. I followed a combination of other reviews' suggestions. This one is definitely going in my recipe box!

Great recipe!  I probably used too many apples and also cooked in a stone dish, so I had to add time for the baking.  Was so easy and very tasty!

Yum, very fast, very easy but don't over bake it or the topping with be quite hard.
Took me a little under 10 minutes to prep.
