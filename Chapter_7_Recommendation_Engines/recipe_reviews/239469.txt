These ended turning out really good! The only thing I changed was I added 1 package of instant Vanilla Pudding mix. Next time around though I will be adding a half cup more of marshmallows that way you can taste the marshmallow a bit more. Overall though a very well thought out cookie! My wife and two daughters loved them!

The flavor of these cookies were outstanding-just like s'mores! I just had some trouble preparing the dough-my first attempt literally dissolved into one big melted and caramelized mess in the oven-quite disappointing. But my next try yielded better results by increasing the amount of flour and decreasing a bit of the liquid. I'm definitely bringing these to the next family gathering. "Not a pastry chef," my left foot! Take that, mom!

Everyone that tastes these loves them and wants more! My helpful tip is, when you are making the dough balls, make sure there aren't any marshmallows on the bottom side of the ball (pan side) because when they cook they'll melt on the pan and it'll include a lot of difficulty prying them from the pan after cooked. It usually rips my cookies apart.

Tasty, but I had to reduce the time... so the first 24 are crunchy crispy!

Amazing cookies! Super delicious when you warm them up in the microwave. Suggestions for the recipe are that you have to knead the dough by hand when putting in the flour and you have to shape the dough when putting it on the baking sheet to cook. I also used a food processor to crumb the graham crackers.

Taste like s'mores, but couldn't get them to look a thing like the photo (they would not spread). I used graham cracker crumbs instead of mashing up graham crackers. The dough was very dry and hard to work with. I made half a batch with mini marshmallows as available at the grocery store, and half with the same marshmallows cut up (the latter came out better and much less messy). Mini chocolate chips would probably work better than regular size.

I loved it. The only thing I'd change for next time is adding less brown sugar. The taste stood out in the aftermath. I'd say a half a cup, if not a third cup.
