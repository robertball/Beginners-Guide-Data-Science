This is a fabulous dish and very easy.  I have made it 3 times and it's delicious.  I do make some tweaks to the recipe.  I switch the honey and lime juice...use a 1/3 cup fresh lime juice and about 1/4 c. honey and I use 18 tortillas, 6 for each layer.  It just seems to cover better.  I also get a 28oz can of the green enchilada sauce and use just a smidge more of the cream and green sauce to coat the top.  I have used different variations of cheese, from cojack to Monterey jack and even sharp cheddar and extra sharp white cheddar.  It ALL tastes Great!  This is becoming one of my families favorite recipe!

This is fantastic!  Didn't have cream or the cheese suggested so used milk/butter for the cream and monterey jack cheese.  Just the right combination of sweet, tangy, and spicy.

These were very good! The only thing I will do different next time is cut down on the honey a bit, as it was too sweet for us. Other than that, this had a great flavor...I rolled these and put them into a baking dish, topped w/ the sauce, cheese (I couldn't find the one specified anywhere, so I used a combo of cheddar and Monterey Jack), and a little chopped green onions. I will def be making these again...the family enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing. :)

Even heeding the warnings to use less honey, this was still sweeter than I liked. I took it for a friend's mexican-themed birthday party, and was disappointed that it had no real 'mexican' flavor.

Hands down..the BEST enchiladas I've ever tasted!  They are savory and a little sweet. Everyone that tried them loved them, even my picky kids:) Will definitely add this on the meal rotation. Thanks!

This was very, very good!  I did cut back on the honey by half and I also added a few chilies to the chicken as it cooked in the crockpot. That verde and cream sauce is so yummy. I used quest blanco between the layers and Colby jack on top.

More of a casserole with the layered tortillas. Excellent flavor though.  Some of my personal observations: 

 It needs salt!  I added some to the chicken but it wasn't enough.  

The configuration needs tweaking.  Another review suggested using 6 tortillas per layer instead of 4 to get better coverage.  I tried that and its just too much corn.  Next time I'll use 6 for each layer but I'll eliminate the middle layer of tortillas.  Or I might even roll up 12 enchiladas and put them in the dish.  Keep it at 12 tortillas though!

I had to laugh at the review that complained about the lack of spiciness.  Which ingredients led you to believe these were spicy?  I like the heat so I added some red pepper to the marinade.  

Lastly you're going to need more sauce.  I used about 20 oz of green sauce and 2/3 cup of cream and it was still a bit dry.  Next time I'll use the whole 28 oz can.  The sauce is so good you could actually drink it.

My mother-in-laws favorite enchilada recipe, but not mine.   Entirely too sweet and not enough spice for me.   I would probably cut the honey in half next time and add in jalapenos to kick it up a notch.

This is a great recipe to start with for enchiladas. I didn't have either of the recommended cheese, but I did have sharp cheddar (mild cheddar would get lost in all the other flavors in this dish) and cotija and it was fine. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of cream too because it's what I had and the rest of the cream would just go to waste. I used two 10-ounce cans of green enchilada sauce and I think that was the right amount to keep the whole dish moist. I'm always trying to find a way to get more greens in my meals, so I added baby spinach as a layer and it worked great. I added cumin to the "marinade" for a bit of additional flavor. This is great to portion out into single servings and freeze for quick pack-able lunches.

Delicious and different take on the traditional Chicken Enchiladas. Also it was nice to layer it casserole style instead of making individual rolled echiladas, I never though about doing that, it was so easy.

Best recipe I have made to date. I was a lil worried about making it with the verda sauce but made it just how the recipe asked. I'm glad I did. The verda makes it. The whole family loved it including me. Will make again to dazzle peoples minds and taste buds.
