This was such a good cookie!  I made them at a gathering and they were gone in about 5 minutes!

For such an unhealthy mix of ingredients, I expected a MUCH better cookie (egg yolk + sugar + butter = good? That's at least how it formulated in my mind). If you have an undeniable craving for butter, this cookie is perfect. Otherwise, the taste was lackluster, and the texture was horrible (the final product is, indeed, crumbly -- too much so, for my taste). I prefer a cookie you can actually hold onto without it disintegrating or affecting the manner in which it's consumed. With that said, the height the cookies are placed in the oven is very important. Not too close to the fire, or else you'll end up with black-bottomed uncooked egg/sugar/butter mash.

This cookie was extremely simple to make. I made them with my toddler and he was in heaven. He loved rolling and smashing the balls of dough. Unfortunately the cookies are not as simple to eat. They crumble so easily you almost have to pop them into your mouth at lightening speed. As soon as that cookie hits your mouth though... yummy! The taste reminds me a little of the snow-ball cookies my mom used to make for christmas when I was little. I just wonder how to keep them from crumbling.... These are definately worth trying. Just be prepared for the crumble.

I think the ratio of flour to butter may be incorrect. I even cooled overnight and they still spread like crazy.

Not Good.  Would not make again.  Didn't have cream of tarter so I tried this one.  Cookies did not have much taste and were not very sweet.  Only two tablespoons of sugar in mixture, hmmm.  Crumbled apart and were pretty dry.

Mine came out together and not crispy, I did leave it in the full 10 min, maybe I should of taken it out at 8-9 minutes. The outside is yummy, inside is bland, thinking maybe next time to add a sprinkle of sugar/cinnamon inside of the 'dough'.
