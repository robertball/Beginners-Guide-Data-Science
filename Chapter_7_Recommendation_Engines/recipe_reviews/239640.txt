I had a ground meat thawed out in the fridge and didn't feel like taking the time to put together a whole meatloaf and wait for it to cook...especially on a weeknight. Saw this recipe and am so glad I tried it out.  It was super quick and easy...and, best of all, my picky toddlers gobbled it up! Two out of three kids were members of the "clean plate club" which makes this dinner quite a success!  I followed the recipe but used minced onion, saving yet more time in the prep.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Topped with brown gravy and a little sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

I sauteed mushrooms and onions first. I also  added a 1/4 cup barbecue sauce,  1/4 cup ketchup, and Garlic Salt which really added flavor. I got rave reviews from my guests!

I used the ingredients listed (except the tomatoes as I'm allergic) but made one large meatloaf.  My boyfriend thought it was awesome.  I thought it was good.

Very good as written, I used a chopper to make the onions nice and fine.  Will play with it a little bit sometimes but really good and easy, thanks!

These were ok, but they were pretty bland, even using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I would suggest adding seasonings to the mix before baking.
