Hmmm...well, these were interesting to say the least!  I had some trouble getting them off of the cookie sheet (due to the baked on marshmallow).  I think I baked the entire 20 minutes...maybe I took them out a little sooner.  They tended to fall apart as I was removing them to a rack to cool.  The end result was a decent tasting cookie.  They hold together much better once they've cooled.

My husband rated it a 3 & I rated it a 1 so this is a compromise.  Don't bake for 20 min unless you want a rock.  I finished baking mine for 9 min & that was much better.(my hubby liked the taste of those)  I won't make again as I thought they were blah.

Don't make this recipie unless you want a big mess. The marshmallows tend to melt and stick to the pan like superglue. This significantely impedes not only the process of getting the cookies off the sheet in one piece, but cleaning the sheets as well. Arghh. I guess these cookies are an original idea, but because of the mess they make and their overwhelming sweetness I can only give these cookies a two.

GREAT recipe as for sticking use pan liners. FREEZ the mashmillows it is a must over nite dough after you use scoop on pan linners and cookie sheet. allow room because it speds and dont flated. DONT over cook its a must. orange cinnamon its the magic part to marshmillows. THIS is awsome recipe and would not aviod any items because its awsome and soft possable if not over cooked.

It was a good idea to freeze the marshmallows but be careful when removing the hot cookies from the sheet.  Hot marshmallow can really burn the skin!  (Learned the hard way one Thanksgiving)  I liked the idea of cinnamon, chocolate, and orange together, but I would leave out the marshmallows completely.  Most cookies cook in 8 to 12 minutes at a slightly higher temperature.  Keep it up, Casey, the idea was right-on.

Good concept, strange execution. I was a little thrown by the low oven temperature and extra-long baking time. I couldn't give it any more stars than I did because the orange extract gives it a strange flavor. Maybe it would work better with vanilla extract.

We changed this recipe alot?? ok so we didn't add any cinnamon. We added milk chocolate chips and replaced the orange extract with vanilla extract. Others then that we stuck withy the same recipe. They turned out so good!!! A little crunch cause I mixed up to recipes and added some of the wrong measurements for baking soda and powder. But just through a slice of bread in the same container and good to go! Sooooo yummy and almost like a s'more?? make these cookies!!!

I don't have marshmallows so I can't speak to that part of the recipe at all.  Hubs ate them with the dog so there goes that.  It did occur to me,  however,  to try the dried marshmallows you can buy for hot chocolate instead.  I do have some,  but they are at work so I will have to try that another time.  They might work better than regular marshmallows that tend to melt and stick--I am quite willing to go with other reviews here since I've baked with marshmallows before.  I essentially ended up with orange -y, cinnamon -y chocolate chip cookies and I really like them that way actually.  I ignored the baking instructions and baked at the normal 350 for 11 minutes.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sticks to the pan and makes cleanup dreadful.
