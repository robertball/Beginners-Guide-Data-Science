Used my own pie filling but followed the crust recipe exactly. Excellent! I used a standard size cupcake pan and baked for 35 minutes. Perfect cherry tarts!

Perfect for a potluck. Really delicious as is.
I did however make some with my lemon meringue pie filling. Those were also  amazing! I offered some whipped cream to top the lemon filling  if desired.

These are delicious!  I bought the organic cherry pie filling which I think tastes better and has more fruit.  I make them as written and they come out terrific.  I've made them twice and I'll make them again for sure.
