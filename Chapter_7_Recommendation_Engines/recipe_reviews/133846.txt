Very good and indeed quick and easy! I love these kinds of recipes because ingredients are simple and it's stuff I normally have in my fridge and freezer.  The only thing I didn't have was a shallot so I used a red onion instead and it was great. I also added a clove of minced garlic for some bite, and instead of milk I used some table cream.

Nice one! I also like to put a little fresh lemon in there.. and maybe loose the cream so it gets a little "lighter" :)  I usually make this sort of dish with homemade fresh pasta...If you never tried making pasta do it! Its alot of fun, and really not that hard.  greets!

This recipe rocks.  Feel free to improvise but a must is to double the sauce.  Also, I think it important to dish the noodles and the dish sauce over.  Do not mix all together.  I added halved grape tomatoes to the sauce along with some dill.  Served with fresh Parmesan and red pepper flakes.  Also doubled the salmon.  Really really easy...finished everything in less than 25 minutes.  My husband loved.

Outstanding!  Made for four servings; increased Salmon 1.5x more, added 1 tsp Capers and 1 tsp grated Parmesan to sauce; did NOT add water to sauce.  Held sauce warm for 15 min while I made the linguini.  So easy and so fast, and everyone from 2-60 yrs old RAVED!  Served w/ Merlot, milk for the 2-yr old :), and finish w/ Pecan dessert of choice.

We really liked this! Needed something to use up my lox, this was easy and delicious. Doubled the sauce as others suggested. I used spaghetti, I had onion on hand, not shallot, and I added some tomato pieces.  Came out great.

Simple and perfect lunch! I doubled all ingredients except the pasta to make 4 lighter servings. Worked out to about 480 calories a bowl. I added some fresh chopped basil and a tsp. of minced garlic to the sauce. I can only imagine how tasty this would be with lemon squeezed on top!

I realize this is supposed to be a light sauce, but it really needs to be doubled. My noodles quickly soaked up the sauce and it was too dry. All I had was  fat-free half and half.  I used a hard-wood smoked salmon (not the lox, cold smoked salmon).  The salmon lover in the family really liked this. I think that it needs a little more punch even though I added garlic, dill and threw in a handful of fresh parsley. Super easy. Definitely increase the sauce!

Yes, this was easy!  It gets 4 stars because I doctored it.  I only used 6oz of pasta and used penne because that's what I had.  I doubled the sauce and used 2oz of cream cheese.  I used 4oz of salmon.  I also threw a little flour into the sauce to thicken it up.  Just personal preference.  Topped it with pepper.  Made this way I'd give it 5 stars!

I have made this for my boyfriend and family and it is always a hit. After reading reviews I too doubled the sauce and had lemon wedges and fresh dill minced for guests to add as they liked. I personally find it delicious with generous lemon and dill. Thank you so much!

This is a terrific recipe.  I found it fairly quick and easy.  I had about a 1/2 lb of left over smoke salmon in the fridge from Christmas to use up.   I'm always careful with storage time with smoke salmon, so I wanted to use it in something that was cooked.  The smoke salmon, capers, and sun dried tomatoes in a cream sauce was really good!

Nice and simple recipe.  Like others I doubled the sauce and increased the salmon.  I used “herb and garlic” cream cheese and added just a touch of black pepper.  I think it would have been just a bit too bland without.

I love smoked salmon pasta in a cream sauce. Like most of the reviewers, I increased the sauce especially the cream cheese, smoked salmon and milk. Used a small fresh onion (summer time) and cooked the sauce on med-low while the pasta (similar to farfalle) cooked. I put the smoked salmon in frozen. When the pasta had 2 minutes to go, I added fresh snow peas in the pod to the pasta water. A nice thick sauce that sticks to the pasta. Very good. As good as most very good restaurants would serve. Thanks for the recipe.

Good base recipe. I made twice the sauce, twice the salmon, and added more cream cheese. I suggest tossing the salmon in at the end so it's not mushy. Also needs salt and pepper.

We received lots of smoked salmon for Christmas so decided to try this as one way to use it.  Used twice the butter and milk (lowfat), four wedges of Laughing Cow light cheese instead of the cream cheese due to what I had, added minced garlic, 1/4 cup white wine, fresh ground pepper, garlic salt, frozen peas and carrots (so I could have a one pot meal) and a full 6 oz. package of smoked salmon.  Very good blend of flavors.  Hubby probably added more salt and crushed red peppers, but that risks masking the beautiful smoky salmon flavor.

This is a great base recipe. I've played with it a lot since making it the first time, but my husband and I really enjoyed it as written as well. If you prefer saucier pasta, double it. We like it with lots of garlic and some vegetables thrown in (which also requires doubled sauce, so it can coat the vegetables...tomatoes are good, and we have also liked it with broccoli, green beans, or a mix of yellow squash and zucchini). Love it, thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was a good base to start with and create from there.  Since I like a lot of sauce, I tripled the recipe and, as another reviewer suggested, I added grape tomatoes that I cut in half along with about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  After tasting it, it was still missing something so added about 1/8 cup shallot & chive Boursin cheese to kick it up a notch.  Served it over Angel Hair pasta and BF loved it!  I added the smoked salmon too soon because as I stirred the sauce, the salmon broke up into little flakes instead of chunks.  But the good news from this is that with enough salmon in the sauce, stirred well, this would make an awesome hot salmon dip!

I have made this probably eight times now and it's the only dish that all four of us in my family love. It's quick and easy.  I have only used onions instead of shallots.

Fast and easy base recipe that you can easily adjust to your tastes. 

I made 4 servings: figured the sauce base needed to be doubled so I did that, eyeballed the salmon so probably added more of that too, added garlic (2 tsp minced), lemon juice (1 tbs slowly to avoid curdling) and parmesean at table.  Will try with cooking wine and dill next time to take it up another  notch.

Family loved it, good flavour and a nice way to finish off leftover salmon. Used penne noodles as that was the kids preference. Good enough to use for guests.

I will definitely make this again. I was trying out some new organic pasta which required boiling for 2 min followed by resting in the water for 16 min. While I waited for the pasta, I threw together what I had: One small can of red salmon, yellow onion, 1/2 c cottage cheese, 2 tbsp Parmesan, 1 c yogurt. Sauteed the onion and put it all together. Yummy!

Easy! I use half as much pasta for the amount of sauce it makes & it's perfect for two.

Definately double the sauce.  I added some gorgonzola cheese to kick up the flavor a bit.  The added flavor pairs nicely with the smoked salmon.
(I smoke my own salmon that I buy at the market)

Too plain when made with grilled salmon. I added 1/2 cup yellow pepper, garnished with dill and lemon which helped but wasn´t enough. I will try again but with red pepper and slightly more cream cheese.
