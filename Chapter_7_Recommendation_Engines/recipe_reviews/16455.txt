Here's a tip for those of you who found the potatoes were undercooked: after slicing potatoes, throw them into a pot of boiling water for 5 or 10 minutes, just to get them a bit tender, then rinse in cold water before continuing with the recipe.

This was the first time I made scalloped potatoes.  I followed the recipe, and it turned out great!  The potatoes were tender after 1 hour of cooking.  I did mix the milk and flour first before pouring over potatoes.
For those who found the potato not done after recipe cooking time, I suspect the reason was the potatoes.  Someone told me there are many different kinds of potatoes, and they all require different cooking time.
All I use is russet potatoes.

The first time I made this it did not turn out at all.  This time I halved the recipe, put it in a shallow casserole dish (so the milk wouldn't sit on the bottom) and covered it with a lid.  After the cheese had melted thoroughly, I stirred it, flattened it out and increased the temperature to 425F.  After 30 minutes I removed the lid and baked for another 10 minutes to brown and thicken the sauce a bit.  That worked out great.

Entire family loved this - but I only sliced 5 potatoes (microwaved for 4 minutes), used cheddar and parmesan cheeses, added garlic powder, and mixed the flour and milk before pouring.  Definitely cook covered for 30 mins and uncovered for 30 mins.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  I used shredded cheddar and monterey jack instead of sliced cheddar.  I also sliced to potatoes VERY thin to make sure they cooked in the time stated.

Needs a much longer baking time than stated in the recipe! And that even when halving it.

After reading all the reviews, I didn't follow this recipe to the T (I never do!), but used it as an inspiration.  I am one for spices and this didn't have enough, so I added a few dashes of a blend of peppers/chillies as well as a clove of minced garlic, plus 2 tbsp sour cream.  And I added 2 breasts of boiled cubed chicken to make it more of a casserole.  Having read all the reviews regarding the extremely slow cooking time, I used my food processor and sliced the potatoes up really thin, but I made the mistake of not either (1) boiling them for 5-10 minutes beforehand or (2) putting it in a 13x9 baking dish (vs a 9x9 one).  Despite the EXTREMELY LONG cooking time (1 hr at 375 plus 15 mins at 425!!!), this turned out DELICIOUS!!!  thanks for the inspiration...

The flavor of this dish is decent, but there are a lot of problems along the way. First, make sure to use a shallow dish or else the milk just stays at the bottom. Second, the cheese and flour never really mixed together and the whole dish needs a lid in the oven to keep it from getting crusty and dry on top. Third, it takes more than ten minutes to prepare and at least sixty minutes in the oven. The flavor was fine, but not good enough to inspire me to try making this dish again.

For well-cooked potatoes in this recipe, omit the final layer of cheese; scald the milk before pouring it over the potatoes; and cover tightly with foil for about the first 45 minutes.  Then, uncover, add the final layer of cheese and bake until the cheese is browned and bubbly.

I'm taking a star off because it did take a long time to cook.  The finished product was all right, though.

Not very impressed with this recipe.  I cooked it for at least 2 1/2 hours, but the potatoes were still hard as rocks.  The milk didn't blend, and the flavor wasn't that great.  I reheated it for another hour the next day, and it was okay-- except that the edges were blackened and couldn't be eaten, not to mention were heck to clean.

COOK LONGER!!!  There.  Now that I have your attention, these smell and taste AMAZING!  I cooked for 30 minutes and they were still crunchy.  I put them back in the oven for another 30-40 minutes and they came out perfect!  I used baking potatoes.

Good recipe
BUT - I used 1/2 cup milk and a can of cream of mushroom soup with potatoes and onions layered.  
Thank you for the recipe idea, much appreciated.

Very good with a few changes. Cover and bake for 40, remove foil cook for 30 more. I sauteed onion added flour milk and cheese and made a thick sauce to pour over. Added paprika, parsley, red pepper, & garlic. Turned out great!

The Ingredients are correct, but the baking time is not written and totally wrong.  It takes close to 45 mins to make scalloped potatoes. Ya'll should have mentioned it specially since U are naming it "Easy" SCALLOPED potatoes.  Chefs be prepared to toil over these easy potatoes for an hour....and use your own imagination..Luv Seema from NY

This is an easy recipe that turns out really good.  It does take a few minutes to cut the potatoes and prepare, but the payoff is worth it.  I use a manolin slicer to get my potatoes sliced uniformly.  It really helps make the work easier.

I had a really bad time with this recipe. After following the recipe and cooking this for the recommended time, I was surprised to open a dish of raw sliced potatoes floating in milk. I put it in the oven for 2 more hours and then 2 more and had a really unpleasant potato cake (not fully cooked). I'm not sure, but I think the potatoes need to be partly cooked before slicing and layering. And then add cheese sauce (??). Quite an unpleasant experience. Lots of potatoes and cheese wasted.

After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to slice my potatoes into rounds and boil them for about 10 minutes.   While the potatoes were boiling, I sliced about 12 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese.  I strained the potatoes and layered potatoes, followed by cheese, salt, pepper and a sprinkling of flour,  until the last layer, to which I put a couple pieces of unsealed butter and milk....cook uncovered until bubbly and the potatoes are   slightly brown..... Very nice recipe,will definitely make it again

I should have read the reviews before making... I doubled the recipe and made many layers. This was not good. After 1/2 hr in the oven, the top was dry and down below I could see a big milky lake. At this point, the rest of the dinner was ready to go. So, to cook the scalloped potatoes  faster, I dumped the whole thing in a skillet. Brought the milk to almost boiling. Then turned it down to low and covered for 15 minutes. Came out wonderfully cheesy, potatoes were tender. It was saved! Oh, also, I used grated cheddar cheese not slices.

This was a big hit.  I used my food processor to slice the potatoes and shred the cheese.  I combined the milk and the flour pouring it over the potatoes and cheese.  I microwaved the dish for 25 mins. and it was done.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I read the reviews, made it, and made it with the suggested adjustments from others.  They are right though...it does take way more time to bake than the time suggested, and I found stirring it occasionally during the baking time helped mix in the milk, flour, and cheesed.

I loved the flavor of this dish.  I ended up cooking mine for almost two hours because my husband was late from work ... but it just got better with time.  Start out with a lid then take it off for the last half hour to thicken it up and brown the top.  Cheesy and wonderful!

Quick & easy for sure, but they were a bit bland and the bottom half of the dish's serving was quite greasy.

I kept this in the over well over the amount of time it called for and the potatoes were still undercooked.  I added well over the amount of cheese needed and there still wasn't enough flavor.

This turned out well.  I followed the recipe, but did add a sliced onion and more pepper.  I also used evaporated milk.  I'm not sure why some had to cook for 2 hours.  I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and they cooked up beautifully.  I can certainly see this as a delicious casserole with some sliced ham and broccoli or asparagus.  A really good base recipe.  Thanks!

I am rating this a 4 star because of taste. I did learn one thing while making this recipe, that is, pre-cook your potatoes before baking. The recipe called for 20 minutes of cook time and it took a while longer. Maybe it was an oversight on my part, but maaking them again I pre-cooked and they cooked much faster and like i said it is well worth your time if you like scalloped potatoes. They turned out great.

I made this for my family, which loved it, but I altered it a little. I used half & half and milk together and used shredded cheese instead of the sliced cheddar. Also used a 13x9 baking dish and upped the baking temp to almost 400. It only took about 45 mins to cook and was cooked all the way through. But I used my veg slicer (mandoline) to make the sliced tators very thin. All together it turned out great and will make again and again.

I followed the reviewers' advice and mixed the flour with the milk prior to pouring it over the top.  However, I think this would be better with some garlic or some additional seasoning.  Definitely cover with foil - this would've taken far too long otherwise.

I def. should have read the reviews before I made this.  Just like everyone else stated the cooking time is an extra 2 hours.  Which is not what I expected.  The finished product is ok, yet after 2 hours the potatoes are still kinda hard.  I would make them again but with a completely different recipe.

Can someone tell me why this recipe has 4 stars?? I should have read the reviews. Just about everyone including myself thought it was awful. Two hours and still have it in the oven!!! From now on I MAKE CHEESE SAUCES..that pouring the milk over bad food does not work for potaotes, mac and cheese...nada. Definilty deserves one star in my opinion.

After 35 minutes, ended up serving my kids 1/2 done (if that) potatoes and melted cheese.  If I wanted to take that much time to make scallop potatoes for a easy dinner, I definately would have used a different recipe using a homemade cheese sauce.

Sorry but the directions weren't clear (bake covered or uncovered?), and after baking for over an hour the potatoes were still hard.

I selected this recipe because it cooked for a short time and it had all the ingredients that I had in my house. I ended up halving the recipe (however increased the pepper). I had to increase the temperature and the cook time by almost double. I had to stir the mixture as the flour on the top layer never mixed with the milk.

This recipe worked very well for me! This was my first time cooking scalloped potatoes, and I will use this recipe again! I used Havarti instead of cheddar... and it was amazing! I put them in at 400 as that was what my chicken (in a separate dish) needed to be at. It only took about 50 minutes. So yummy!!!

This was a very good base for making the potatoes. I microwaved them after slicing them in two cups of water along with a chicken bullion cube. And I sued that liquid when I baked them along with 1/4 cup of lowfat half& half. I baked it for 20 minutes covered in 350 oven, then another 15 uncovered. It was a big with our family!

I liked this recipe because it was very simple to make.  I took the advise of one reviewer and cooked the sliced potatoes in boiling water, max 10 mins.  Next time I make this recipe I will pour a little heavy cream on each layer along with the flour.  That should make it a little more rich.  I baked mine for about 20-25 mins turned out great.

My husband LOVED this recipe!  It was very simple to make and tasted wonderful.  Make sure to cut the potatoes think enough and don't make too many layers or the potatoes don't get soft enough.  I also added scallions in between the layers to add a hint of onion flavor.

I found the prepartion to be simple and easy. However, like many other people, I found the cooking time to be completely off! After cooking for the specified time, the potatoes had barely cooked. I ended up having to cook the potatoes for at least another hour. Other problems: there wasn't enough cheese and I wasn't sure whether to cover the dish or not. When I finally was able to eat the dish, I didn't think it tasted very good. 

A suggestion to anyone else who is thnking about cooking this dish, cook it covered with tin foil. Also, use shredded cheese of your choice. The cheese will melt more evenly. And if you want a little more flavor, add some cubed ham.

I cut back on the number of potatoes to 6 and sliced them very thin. I covered them and baked the for 45 minutes and then let them sit in the oven until the rest of dinner was ready.

This recipe as written did not turn out good.  I did it over because I had some time with my meat still cooking in the slow cooker.  I whisked the flour in with the milk then cooked it until it began to thicken a little, added the cheese to melt, precooked the potatoes with some onions, and then added a little butter to them, tossed the potatoes and put in the baking dish.  I added some garlic salt, garlic pepper, and a little cayenne to the cheese mixture and poured over the potatoes.  I cooked it in the oven at 350F for 30 minutes.  It turned out OK, but will use shredded sharp cheddar and Velveeta next time.

The ingredient listing looked good, but I'm in agreement with some others: this recipe needs MORE time to cook. I could not serve it with the dinner I prepared it with, and a couple days later I cooked it more, and it STILL wasn't cooked all the way through! Maybe the potato slices need to be sliced paper thin?

It was good, but I did change the flour! Not sure of how much less I used cause I just eyeball it! And I used 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk. It does need a little more seasoning for,  my taste anyways! And it didn't have as much sauce too it, like I like it. So next time a little more milk and cheese! But it was still tasty.

These potatoes I will be making over and over again.  They turned out great.  I used grated cheddar cheese instead of the slices plus I followed the advice from other reviews and I mixed the flour in with the milk.  I also cooked them for 40 minutes covered, then uncovered for 30-35 minutes.  They were golden brown and tender as ever.  No more Betty Crocker boxed potatoes for me :).  These were a huge hit with my family.

The recipe was good just a few changes. I did have to cook it for at least 45 minutes before the potatoes were soft. which is fine and i also replaced the cheddar cheese with italian blend which was awesome. then added some sliced onions and minced garlic. The changes made it taste awesome.

I tried this last night. Oh My God was it good. I did tweak it just a bit. I am a cheese addict, so I added mozzarella and Parmesan cheese to it. OMGosh, Mouth watering...Now of course I have to make this again. Yummy to my tummy.

Thanks for the recipe.

NOt bad. I used more milk and added butter to the recipe. I also added colby and swiss cheese blend to the cheddar cheese in the recipe and it was pretty good. Not the best I've had but not bad either.

My husband is a huge fan of scalloped potatoes and he had two servings but both of us agree, it wasn't that great of a dish. I think next time I will pre-boil the potato's and then let them finish cooking in the oven. im going to use a mixture of different cheeses. probably medium cheddar and provolone and I am going to use white pepper, ground dill and garlic. to add more oomf. this recipe was good but it wasnt awesome.

Flavor was good but time recommendation was terrible! I cooked it at 400 for an hour and then in the microwave for about 10 min and there were still some hard/crunchy potatoes. I would suggest making these but partially boil the potatoes first. I also salted the layers lightly.

Made this once before and, just as everyone else has mentioned, took a while to cook. Will make it again tonight with a few adjustments: will cook covered with foil for most of the time and just take foil off at the end; put far less flour; more milk; add onion and garlic powder and maybe some chili powder; will use shredded cheese rather than slices. Was yummy with mozzerella though. Don't really know why some reviews say that the water just floated at the bottom, mine turned out edible and pretty yummy. With some alterations, I think it will be very yummy tonight!

The cooking time is not even close.  I planned around this time so the rest of my meal was ready and we waited, and waited on these.  I let them cook over an hour (vs 20 min) and they STILL weren't really done.  Flavor wasn't that great either.  First thing I've ever made my husband didn't like.

This recipe is awesome.  I loved it.  I did cut the recipe in half, just because I was only cooking for two.  The only thing I added to this was white onion to each layer.  I sauteed them before baking.  It's hard to describe how thin I sliced the potatoes but I would say 1/4 of an inch.  It also does not take twenty minutes.  It takes an hour at 350 degrees.  Twenty minutes is probably if you sliced the potatoes so thin, which I don't know how to even do that because it's hard to slice potatoes really thin.  Ultimately, good side dish and very yummy.  I think the onions make it though.

This is a tasty scalloped potatoes, but it would've been helpful for more information on how long to leave the potatoes in the over for. I started checking after 20min and ended up leaving them in there for around 40 instead before they were completely done.

Where's the flavor? I even added a little extra cheese and they still came out bland. The top also dried out leaving me with some nice discs. Other scalloped potatoe recipes may take a little more time and prep, compared to this recipe it's worth it! This reminded me of a edible white paste.

I am still in the middle of cooking this recipe and it is just awful.   My potatoes have been in well over the cooking time and are still not done, and I used the potato peeler to slice my potatoes paper thin!!  I had no problem with the milk and flour not mixing, but I did have to add more milk because it was starting to get dry.  From my taste tests so far, it doesn't have much flavor, even though I added onion and garlic powder....

This was a really good recipe, but did not seem like scalloped potatoes.  My mother in law makes a cheesy potato recipe and this seemed more like a version of her recipe.  I put cubed ham into mine.  We really like it as a ham and cheesy potato casserole though.  I will make this again for sure.

Good simple recipe . I added jalepeno cheese instead of cheddar and ham to it as well as a bit of garlic powder,& a dash of salt and onions. Covered dish with aluminum foil and baked for about 1 1/2 hrs . rate it a 5 star with my family :)

The cook time is definately wrong.  I followed this recipe, spent over 2 hours on it (between prep and bake time) and the potatoes never did get done.  I even tried microwaving them and that helped a little, but by this time, dinner was ruined. And after all that the taste wasn't even very good, it definately needed salt.

I'm only giving this four stars because we haven't tasted it yet BUT it looks soooo delicious. I also cut the ingredients in half and cooked it covered for 40 minutes, then uncovered for 15 and on broil for 5. Also stirring about 20 minutes into it. I also added onions and garlic salt.....Mmmmm, if it taste anything like it smells then I'll be back to give it 5 stars.

I'm making this right now. We were supposed to have this with dinner, but it's taking a very long time to cook.  It does need stirring, the flour just sits there.  I also wish that Sarah had said a shallow dish was better.  It seems to taste fine, but it REALLY needs salt.  

I wish I had read the reviews before I cooked it.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Lacks flavor and 45 minutes wasn't long enough cooking time. It needed to cook for a minimum of 1 hour even though I used 6 medium potatoes. 
I added granulated garlic, dry minced onions and no-salt seasoning to each layer, which really helped bring out flavors.

Be sure the mix the flour and NOT sprinkle. It won’t mix and your left with white clumps floating in cheese grease. But all in all tasted great after scooping it all out while it cooked

I had to cook the potatoes for an extra hour and a half to get them done. my family was starving by that time. I make them with shredded? cheese instead. I put garlic and onions they were amazing. I think next time I will turn the temp up and stir them in between. thank you

Great taste. Potatoes were tender. I used fresh red potatoes out of the garden, and it was a wonderful side for the pork roast. Next time I think I will add ham to the dish and make a one dish meal.

Over an hour in the oven and another 20 minutes in the microwave, because the potatoes were still crispy and  we got tired of waiting.  I had to add a whole lot more liquid. I won't be using this recipe again.

I liked the simplicity of the recipe but even with very thinly sliced potatoes, it didn't get done even after an hour and 15 minutes. The potatoes were like rubber. I don't think there is enough liquid. I will probably go back to my stand by Betty Crocker cookbook recipe.

Like a number of other folks, I ended up having to leave this in the oven for over two hours before the potatoes were at all cooked.  Way too late for dinner, so we had them reheated the next day. The flavor was somewhat bland, as well, though I knew it probably would be going in and ought to have added some onions or garlic powder or something. If I do make this again I'll slice the potatoes much more thinly, up the oven temp, and use a shallower baking dish. And add some onion.

Pre cooked sliced potatoes, great tip. I made half the recipe. Sauce seemed bland so added onion powder nutmeg and a generous squirt of djohn mustard. I did mix the milk and flour together with the spices used white and yellow shredded sharp cheddar cheese. And 2 tbs of butter. I had leftover cooked bacon so I crumbled it on top with parsley. I would have used chives but didn't have any. Delicious a keeper.

This was easy which was what I was looking for.  I had 8 medium white potatoes, did not peel, sliced between 1/4 and 1/2 inch think.  I have a 10-inch square baking dish and I ended up with three layers.  I used cake flour, about 2-3 tablespoons on each layer.  I had a mixture of American, Swiss, cheddar and parmesan.  I also had some heavy cream left over so I mixed the 1/3 cup cream with 2/3 cup low-fat milk.  My dish was FULL.  Also added a couple tablespoons of butter diced.  Did not put cheese on top but covered with foil, placed the dish on a cookie sheet in case it spilled over and baked at 400 degrees for 1 hour.  Took off foil, sprinkled with remaining cheese I saved and baked another 15 minutes then 5 minutes under the broiler.  The higher heat cooked the potatoes nicely.  The sauce was cheesy and good.  Will make again, it was delicious with my upgrades!

My family really enjoyed these scalloped potatoes.  I did slice and boil the potatoes for 5-10 minutes before baking to make sure they softened. I mixed together milk and 3-4 Tbsp corn starch and poured over the potatoes instead of layering the flour. I also added green onion to each layer. It was yummy!

I used this recipe as a template since this was my first time making homemade scalloped potatoes.  First, for everyone that had problems with baking times....the problem lies with the TEMPERATURE.  It is way too low.  I used 8 small potatoes sliced thin with a mandolin.  I layered 4 potatoes, then 1/2 of an onion, then covered with grated cheddar and then salt, pepper and granulated garlic.  I repeated for a second layer.  I mixed up a cheese sauce and then poured that and a 1/2 cup whole milk into the mix.  I baked for 1 hour and 20 minutes at 425 degrees...turned out delicious.  But crank your temperature up to at least 400; otherwise you'll be sitting forever waiting for it to cook properly.

Usd 2 C of shredded cheddar not sliced off the block- everyone who ate them LOVED them.  So easy not having to cook or boil the potatoes first.  I just scrubbed the potatoes.  Didn't even peel them.  Added some garlic powder too and OMG-so good!
Making them tonight again too-only a week after the last time!
Enjoy!

I made this recipe earlier today and it turned out good. It's nothing special to make but it is pretty tasty.  Instead of cheese slices I grated mozzarella and I also added garlic. Before returning to the oven to brown I sprinkled the top with parsley.  RATING: 3.5.

Easy recipe that turned out yummy. Be sure to salt between the layers to ensure flavour. If you use less cheese like I did add more salt for flavour. The cheese adds the flavour so if you reduce you will need to compensate.

I should have read all the reviews before I made this recipe.  Cooking time way longer than stated (precooking the potatoes a bit would help.). I added thinly sliced onion and a pinch of nutmeg, flavor was great.   One cup of milk didn't seem enough so I used two.

Wish I read the reviews before I made this. The milk and flour never did blend together and had to be mixed. The flavour was rather bland, maybe I should have used more salt & pepper but the family felt something else was missing. It also needed to be cooked much longer than stated despite potatoes sliced thin with a mandolin.

I agree it needs a much longer cook time. Either that or par boil the potatoes. Par boiling would be preferable to make the finished product nicer. Also needs salt, I added 2 tsp kosher salt and it still needed a little. Other than that it was easy and would be delicious. Thanks

I like this dish once it was done, but I will alter it from now on. The main thing is to boil the potatoes first because it took forever for them to cook thoroughly. I'm in a high altitude area, so expect that, but it literally took 2 hours and because I wasn't expecting it to take quite that long we ended up eating our steak with no side dish! Also, I will use the suggestion to use a larger casserole dish to spread it out, rather than a deeper dish. I think I will also use a bit more cheese, as it wasn't as cheesy as I like my scalloped potatoes.

The potatoes weren't at all cooked.  I suppose I could boil them first next time and that would take care of it.  Also, the sauce never thickened up.  Overall, I was disappointed.

This recipe is very bland.  My boyfriend usually eats anything with cheese and he didn't like these at all.  I added dried minced onion because I thought it would need a little more something. Still wasn't very flavorful.

Really disappointed with how it turned out for me.  I had to fix this several times and once the texture was ok.  My kids eat anything but not very lucky tonight1

The Family loved this recipe. We love potatoes and cheese. Much better than box brands... Was easy to make...

I did as some of the reviewers had suggested and mixed the flour and milk together with some garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Then I covered with foil for 30 minutes and uncovered for 30 minutes.  I personally thought it was rather bland but those I served it to absolutely raved so I'll be making it again!

I was not impressed.  There was a lack of flavor even when I kicked it up a bit on my own.  I will try another recipe next time.  This one needs lots of work!

I should have read the reviews first.  This recipe was blah.  I ended up making a cheese sauce and adding it while I was cooking it.  It's been in the oven for 2 hours and it's still not done.

Never again!

I also make this recipe omitting the cheese and using thinly sliced onions instead.  Great for bbq's.

I made it with cheddar cheese soup. The only thing I didn't like was how runny it was. Next time I will use less milk. Also bump up the cooking time by 30 Min.

Frrst time to make this recipe.  I halved the entire recipe, used an amber glass round shallow dish, sliced the potatoes on a madeline thin, layered them sparsely and used Velveeta cheese.  I did have to bake them 1 hr, uncovered and they turned out beautiful and yummy with our ham.  I will definetly be using this again

This recipe was horrid.  I agree that the potatoes came out floating in milk.  Had to through this away and quickly make brown rice to substitute.  I will not make this again.

Delicious!  Couldn't have been easier.  We added more cheese, and a little more milk.  Will make it again.

THis is a very tasty recipe.  It takes much longer to cook that the  20 minutes recommended.  A pinch of salt and perhaps a little onion would enhance it.

This recipe takes longer to cook than the 20 minutes on the recipe. I cooked over 1 hour & still could have gone longer. You will make about 5 layes so layer the potatoes thin.

My husband loved these, especially since I added a little bit of crumbled bacon to them.  They took longer to cook than the recipe stated, but they were worth the wait.

It was easy to prepare but next time I'd decrease the potatoes (or may be not use 'large' potatotoes) and increase the cheese. And it took about an hour to cook it through.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was a hit, but it takes a LOT LONGER than 20 minutes in the oven for this to be done. It took closer to an hour.

Our family loves scalloped potatoes.  Any recipe for this dish is time consuming but it is the quickest that I have found.  The whole family loved it.
Thanks Sarah!
