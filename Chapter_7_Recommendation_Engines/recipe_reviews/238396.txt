Absolutely fantastic! The goat cheese blended so well! My 7yr old didn't like the goat cheese but she liked the rest. This would be good to double and make for company.

Delicious. I used Penne (didn't have Rigatoni) and mixed the goat cheese in instead of topping it. No other changes needed. Will definitely make again.
