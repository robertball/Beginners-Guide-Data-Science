I loved it, particularly because it can be accomplished even by us poor people in the central european wasteland, where you can not simpl go to Â´"your local indian grocery store", as many recipe authors advise,  and find "sev", "golgappa" or the like in abundance... it has been an absolute smash hit at my last birthday party.

This is a fabulous recipe!!  I made it for a group of non-Indian friends and they loved it!!  I made the Indian version, and my family loved it too.  It was very easy, and very tasty.

Fantastic. Just like the dahi puri I used to eat in India. You can find black salt in the International foods section of most grocery stores. Be sure to have everything ready before you start topping the puri. If you take your time, they'll become soggy. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a group that included a couple families from India.  I thought it was a real dud, until my wonderful Indian friends showed me how to mix it all in bowls over broken up crakers (I was trying to balance all the toppings on top of the crackers!!!).  They loved it!!!!  Thanks for introducing me to Indian cooking!!!!

This is a great start! Making life more simpler, use canned garbanzo beans, drained, there isnt much taste difference. Use good quality yogurt, not the "No Fat" version. I increased the ginger, freshly grated, to 2-3 tsp. I buy the authentic chips from the Indian store and only mix up some of the Chaat with the chips as wanted - dont mix it all at once as it does have to be eaten right away to maintain the soft and crunchy textures. Use fresh Cilantro not dried. I didnt mash the potato but left it in small chunks, adds to the interesting texture differences! Yum Yum !

Made this not really knowing what it was supposed to turn out like or taste like. It ended up being very delicious! I will definitely make it again next time I have a party or guests over. It was very time consuming but in the end was worth it.

Oh my goodness - this is positively addictive!!  I did have to make a trip to the local Indian grocery store, but the results were so worth it.  My daughter and I can eat embarrassingly large amounts of this snack every chance we get.

A very nice variation on dahi batata puri! I did not care for the spiced yogurt. I usually make this with sweet and spicy yogurt (1 cup yogurt with 2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper).

If you have access to tostitos scoops (go for the plain baked or plain multigrain ones), they make fun mini-chaat baskets, known an tokri/katori chaat in India.
