Chocolate is not my favorite flavor, but I do love a good dark chocolate truffle-tasting bite now and then.  This one is perfect!  I watched Chef John do his video, and it was spot-on-perfect!  And so was the resulting bite!  Yum!  Update:  When I made these again, I had trouble with the caramel.  It's kind of tricky.  I LOVE the flavor of them when they turned out the first time--but they got mealy the next time.  The salt is perfect with them---you only use a few grains of salt on each one.

Really easy recipe! I took a step further to make it even easier by using the microwave to melt my chocolate. It's a great tip I learnt from Ina Garten. Tempering chocolate in the microwave is so easy. If you want to try, make sure you put the chocolate in a microwave friendly bowl and check on it a minute at the time so you don't end up burning the chocolate.

Tried this for the first time for a Christmas get together at work.  Everyone that likes dark chocolate raved about them.  they are just as creamy and easy to make as was shown on the video.  If you like dark chocolate these are a must have.

The caramel flavor was subtle, nearly nonexistent, but the combination of flavors with the sea salt was divine.  The caramel didn't work in my first batch (ended up with a few pieces of toffee in brownish milk), but I used it anyway and it was fine.

These little chocolates are fabulous! I made a double batch for our large family Christmas party and everyone who tried them said they were heavenly. They disappeared quickly.  I used a 12 oz. package of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips (doubled the recipe to make 48) and they turned out perfectly.  I'm not sure I'd want to use dark or bitter chocolate because these were so good using the higher quality Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips.  If you love chocolate or love somebody who loves chocolate, you need to make these.  You will see their eyes roll back in their head when they take the first bite!  Thanks, Chef John.  Your recipes are always easy and oh-so-delicious!

My 11 yr old son and I made these twice this holiday season. once with pretty cheap dark (but not super dark) chocolate, and once with a high end milk chocolate. The first set came out just fine and it was a fun recipe to do together, as imperfect as our coins were! The second time we used milk chocolate, the chocolate separated when we put the caramel in and we ended up with a bizarre texture and a separated liquid. I think they'll taste fine, but won't have great texture... and I assume this has something to do with the milk in the chocolate.

I followed the recipe exactly but was disappointed with the results. The chocolate was quite grainy after putting in the caramel, but they didn't taste at all grainy when set up. The problem I had with it was I didn't get very much caramel flavour in the end. The salt was great, kicking up the flavour of the chocolate unexpectedly. I'm not sure if they should taste more caramel but I wish they did. Could I have done something to get more flavour?

Delicious and quite easy!  For anyone doubting they have the skills to pull this off, let me assure you that it's far more foolproof than it appears.  When I had the sugar over low heat, nothing was happening for several minutes...so I turned to my computer and watched a movie trailer (with headphones--big mistake).  When I turned back to the stove, it was already bubbling like mad.  I quickly added the cream--thankfully I'd already measured it out.  Despite my impatience, they turned out great!  I also used regular kosher salt and an did a bad job making them a uniform size, but these little guys still performed like champs.  If I can bumble my way through this recipe and still get a great result, so can you!

You really have to watch the sugar, it will go to crispy and hard pretty quickly.  I didn't notice much of a caramel flavor with these. but the sea salt and dark chocolate was still tasty.

I have made this a few times.  It's really fun to make and everyone loves it.  Dusting with cocoa is a cool touch but it sure leaves  cocoa powder on your lips.   Not cool, so I stopped dusting them.

SOO good!! :) Can't wait for my morning coffee to see how wonderfully they complement that! I had a little trouble with the sugar crystalizing when I slowly poured in the cream. I kept the heat on low and eventually the sugar melted into the cream and began to boil. Also when I combined the caramel to the chocolate, it began to harden quickly so my "coins" were pretty rough. Glad I stuck it out though because the flavor is perfect! Just enough chocolate, caramel and salt. Can't wait to get better at this marvelously simple recipe!

OH NO! The recipe didn't specify a percentage dark chocolate so I used 85% dark chocolate from Theo because I didn't want to turn it into milk chocolate.  That was WAY too high and it was impossible to tell the caramel or cream was added.  I hate that I used the recipe first because in the video he shows he uses 60% cocoa.  I think the effort put into typing up this recipe is a little slip-shod.  I also had all the caramel harden when I added the cream, but he specifically says to put it in cold.  On the video his stays liquid so I am not sure why that happened.  Too dark for me, only flavor is bitter and salt.

Intense chocolate flavor with little bursts of salt!  These turned out great; very easy to make.  My sugar did take much longer to get to the bubbling stage, so I guess I should have upped my temperature.  It turned out all right in the end.

The family enjoyed them, but I didn't expect them to have a soft, fudge-y texture. Very dark chocolate taste but I didn't detect any caramel or sea salt flavors.
