I went looking for a green bean salad and this one fit the bill, but I wanted one that focused on the green beans so the main adaptation I made was to leave out the mixed salad greens. I used a pound of green beans, which I cooked al dente as directed. I made a dressing out of 1 tbsp olive oil, the orange juice and balsamic, and substituted pine nuts for the fennel. I halved the feta and used 1/4 cup of dried cranberries.  I tossed all the ingredients together, and voila, a green bean salad focusing on the beans.

This was a nice change from just plain salad and just plain green beans.  I did not like the fennel seeds in it though.  I used the orange flavored "Craisins" and that really complimented the orange juice already in the recipe.  I love the feta in it too.

This is a great salad.  The only thing we changed was using dried cherries instead of dried cranberries and only because we prefer dried cherries over cranberries.

It was an okay salad.  Wouldn't be very interesting without the cranberries!

This is a great salad! 
I used more beans than baby lettuce- and even added chunks of fresh orange. Following our reviewer, I added pine nuts. The cranberries were very tasty too.

I was looking for something different for green beans...this was a great change.  I tossed cooked green beans with the feta, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and orange juice.  Then I added sliced grape tomatoes and some slivered almonds I had on hand.  What a yummy side dish!

Very good! I'd give this five stars, but I changed a few things in the recipe. I omitted the fennel seeds and added pine nuts, and instead of using orange juice I melted some orange juice concentrate from the can. It was a very yummy salad, and my 8 yo dd declared it one of her new favorites. Thanks!!

I didn't make this with lettuce.  I wanted just a green bean recipe and this isn't it.  I'm sure if it was with the salad it would be far better.  I was hoping for more of an orange taste in the dressing with the fennel but the balsamic overpowered it completely. thanks but i'll keep looking.

I used some sliced almonds in place of fennel (as I don't like fennel).  I omitted the dried cranberries and squeezed half  a fresh orange .  I steamed the fresh green beans in the microwave with alot of garlic. deliciously healthy

This salad is awesome - the dressing and cheese are so yummy you don't even realize you're eating so many vegetables! I used spinach instead of greens and omitted the fennel because I don't like it. I'll make this again for sure.

Refreshing, light salad. Tasty! After I briefly steamed the fresh green beans, I ran them under cold water to chill them. I added sunflower seeds, used melted orange juice concentrate rather than OJ, and omitted the fennel seed, and the craisins are awesome in this recipe! Definately don't omit them. I liked the way the lettuce wilted, and may try the recipe with hot green beans next time to see how it compares. Great recipe!

I was looking for a way to use up some green beans and this fit the bill very nicely.  I cooked the green beans in the morning and just put them in the refrigerator.  I then mixed everything up right before eating dinner.  I did omit the fennel seeds as I didn't have any, but otherwise made as written.  The dressing is very good as written, but you really cannot taste the orange juice as the balsamic vinegar takes over the taste.  I made a big batch of the dressing since making the salad and added extra orange juice so the taste would shine through.  Very Good.  I will be making this salad again, and will probably always have the dressing on hand to use with salads.

I made this too soon in advance and it sat in my fridge for a good day.  The vinegar ended up ruling the taste and there was absolutely no hint of orange juice.  I do plan on making this again because I really like the idea of this salad; fun, healthy, & tasty.  But next time I'll increase the orange juice or possibly add a can of mandarin oranges.  I always have these ingredients on hand, what a bonus.  Thanks for sharing.

It was tasty. I think it will taste better the next day so that the flavors can meld together. I ate mine right after making it.

This salad is delicious, healthy, and it's beautiful especially when you add the dried cranberries.  My guests were really impressed which is especially fun in light of how easy it was to make.

I first tried it without the green. It was OK.  I then added the greens but only about half as much and it was a LOT better then without them despite what others have suggested.  Just use 2-3 cups not 4 cups which dilutes the flavor too much.  I used "bulk" dried cranberries which are soft, sweet and juicy unlike commercial boxed ones but with more tang then dried Bing cherries would provide.  I'd also wait until it's served to add the feta or it will get soggy.

This salad was okay,it could be better. I didn't care for the fennel seeds and my husband didn't care for the orange juice and cranberries, although I liked them. I think next time I'll omit the cranberries and orange juice, and substitute fresh dill for the fennel seeds. Might try red wine vinegar also.

Really good recipe but I did use a mortar and pestle to crush the fennel seeds and added 1 more Tbsp of balsamic and left out the orange juice.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe!  We had never tried fennel before, and none of us were particularly impressed with it.  On the second try, we used pine nuts and oh, what a difference!  It had a much smoother taste.  My daughters loved the Craisins I used!

Good, fresh salad but lacked taste.
