This stuff *is* very good.  I've been making this for several years, although I add a can of mixed vegetables to it.  We eat it with tortilla chips.  Very good!

This was a fun and easy lunch to send with my teenage daughter.  I used Morningstar chicken strips, but otherwise followed the recipe.  For simplicity, I used Tostitos Scoops instead of making tortillas myself.  That way it was perfect to take for lunch.

Oh my delicious! How easy, quick and tasty! I used as a sandwich filling instead of as a salad! As others have mentioned, reduced the mayo to about1 1/2 Tbsp and it was plenty. Awesome! Thanks for a great recipe.

My new Aunt brought something very similar to this to a pool party we had a few weeks ago!  Hers had potatoes, peas, and carrots (all cooked) and she's as Mexican as they come. : )  I used this recipe to replicate hers and it is SO yummy with homemade salsa.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy with great taste. Next time will probably use less mayo. Used prepared crunchy corn tostadas hot from oven.  The tostadas really give the taste a kick. Will definitely be making again & again.

This saled is soo good and easy to make.  The more jalapeño juice and sliced jalapeños the hotter it gets.

For us, this was just OK.  It seems to be missing something.  Finely diced celery, onions something with some crunch would help.  I served this on the tostadas with shredded lettuce and cherry tomatoes.

Pretty good! I baked my tortillas, used less mayo, and added a can of drained mixed veggies. My husband loved it. You can easily spice this up if desired by adding more jalapeno slices/juice. This is very easy to whip up and can be eaten immediately.

This is very good using salsa chicken (in a crockpot, cook BLSL chicken breasts sprinkled with taco seasoning and covered in salsa until fork tender) instead of canned chicken. I made this a little more hearty by making a Taco Bar with bowls of taco toppings and the mayonnaise seperately so that everyone can make their own personal chicken salad.

This was a good start for chicken salad, but needed more flavor for us. I added about 1 tsp taco seasoning and some red onion, and that helped for us. Definitely read the reviews for what people added to this.

Was looking for a tasty idea for canned chicken and found it here. I used a 12.5oz can (what I had) and adjusted the ingredients. I used less (light) mayo, and added diced zesty pickles and pickle juice. To finish, I added a small amount of ranch dressing, YUM! Would be also be great on a bed of lettuce or as a sandwich filling.
