Super moist muffins, my family and i enjoyed these banana wheat muffins right out of the oven with a little butter. It was a great afternoon snack.

From the pic you can tell they went fast.  I used brown sugar because it was out already and everyone loved them.  Happy Happy!

I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. A little less sugar, otherwise stayed true to the recipe and my husband and I thought they were great. The recipe is a keeper.

I was looking for a banana muffin recipe without eggs, and this was a good one. I used plain yogurt and cut the sugar a bit, and they were still good and moist!

I changed the dressing to natural yogurt and added mini choc chips. They turned out great!
