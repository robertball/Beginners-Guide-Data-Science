This was good, but not fantastic.  I was the only one in my family who did not add anything to improve the flavor of it once we started eating.  I love all of the nice raw veggies that go into this salad and you can mix and match to suit your family's tastes (I added a few radish slices), but the dressing turned out sweet.  It reminded me of a good coleslaw dressing.  I'll definitely use this idea again, but will make a vinaigrette instead of the Splenda/mayo/vinegar dressing.
