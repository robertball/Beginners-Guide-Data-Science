This was delicious! The taste was great.  There are a couple of things that I would change.  First, add a lot more cheese, and wait to add the cheese to the top until the last 15 minutes.  When I pulled it out of the oven, the cheese had browned, and it was tough.  Perhaps covering the dish prior to baking would change that.  Also, add herbs and spices! Garlic would be awesome in this dish--fresh basil and some oregano would definately be good.  You must try this recipe!

This recipe was very good with the changes that I made. I first ommitted the egg and breadcrumbs, cause that just seemed kinda weird.  I sauteed the spinach(water all squeezed out) with onion, garlic, pinch of dried oregano, and crushed red chili flakes, then added the sauce.  I mixed it all with the shells, put it in a casserole dish and topped with mozzerella and parmesan cheese. And it was sooo delicous, I served it as a side dish along with breaded chicken. thanks for the recipe inspiration!!

This is a nice recipe to use as a base to be creative.  I took another reviewers advice and used fresh spinach I got at the famers market, sauted it in olive oil, minced garlic salt and pepper.  I drained the excess moisture.  I also wanted to reduce the fat content.  I used egg beaters and reduced fat mozzerella cheese.  This was fabulous with some steamed carrots and fresh fruit salad.  I will be making this again.  Thanks

I was surprised this recipe got such good ratings because it is very bland.  When I was making it I thought it was interesting that it had no seasonings in it, but I followed the recipe anyway.  With some salt, pepper and Italian herbs, it livened it up after the act, but next time I would make sure to use a highly seasoned pasta sauce and/or seasoned bread crumbs, and maybe suate some garlic and onion to add to the mix before cooking.

Super easy and delicious- I agree with another reviewer's recommendation: use only 1 tb of oil with rest as skim milk - you don't miss the extra oil. Used Healthy Choice garlic Lover's sauce and added about 2 tsp of basil. I baked it covered and just removed the cover for the last 5-10 min.

This was extremely tasty!  Like an easier version of stuffed shells.  To make the recipe a little less fattening, we added only 1 tablespoon of oil and filled the rest of the 1/4 cup in the recipe with skim milk.  Tasted great!

This pasta dish was very good.  I used penne noodles instead of shells.  Also, I added ground turkey, my husband has to have some kind of meat in his meals!  Next time I'm going to add fresh sliced mushrooms.  This is a good meal for a weeknight dinner, very easy to prepare!

My family really liked this recipe. I made it when we were all sick; it's great comfort food! I halfed the recipe then followed a lot of previous user comments, including: (1) To the egg mixture, I added a teaspoon of dried basil, a teaspoon of onion powder, and a teaspoon of minced garlic, (2) I added cottage cheese to one of the cheese layers, (3) I used fresh spinach, and (4) I used a quarter of the cheese. I baked it in a 9x9 baking dish. Delicious!

My husband loves meat - but when I cooked this recipe he didn't even notice there was no meat.  So easy to prepare, so delicious, I even froze the leftovers and they were great a week later. Definitely will be used again and again.

This casserole ended up tasting much more "Italian" than I had expected--kind of like a meatless lasagna.  But my husband and I really liked it.  I would add at least 50% more cheese.  This casserole is very filling; the two of us could barely make a dent in it with just a salad as a side dish.  The leftovers are great too!

We loved the flavor. It is what we call a "keeper". If you like macaroni and cheese you will love this.

We all love it! 12 oz. = around 3 c. dry shell pasta (I actually use 4 c.). I substituted 1 can diced italian tomatoes for the 1/2 jar spaghetti sauce, used italian seasoned bread crumbs, only cheddar for the cheese, and was in a rush and tossed everything together using 1/2 of the cheese rather than layering it, sprinkled with parmesan, baked covered, and then uncovered and added remaining cheese for the last 5 min., and it was absolutely scrumptious! I later made it layered, and really prefer it all tossed together. This is my new "weeknight lasagne"! It will be a regular on our weekly menu, and a quick yummy meal all will love when having guests over. For those who say this recipe is bland, a thing to remember is that it can only be as good as the spaghetti sauce that you use, so don't skimp on the quality of sauce. Thank you Cheryl for the recipe!

Really, really, really enjoyed this one! I used fresh spinach instead of the frozen (sauteed in a little EVOO w/ minced garlic) because I needed to use up a bag, but that was the only change I made. Followed everything else as instructed. It's a keeper and we'll be having it again for sure! Thanks for the recipe! :)

This was pretty good and very easy. To those of you who left out the egg, it is essential for thickening the dish and giving it a lasagna flavor and feel. I used extra virgin olive oil for extra flavor. I added italian herbs and basil to the bread crumbs and will probably add some garlic to the spinach next time as that sounds like a good suggestion. As for complaints about it being bland perhaps that has something to do with the choice of pasta sauce. I liked it and my kids ate it. Even my picky son who was begging for chicken nuggets as I served this up, forgot about them after he finally consented to taste it.

I added some cooked grilled chicken strips because it is easier to get my two year old to eat something if chicken is in it and that was a nice addition to this already amazing recipe. Also, I did not have any pasta sauce on hand, so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and that worked great. This has definitely been added to my recipe box!

This was really good.  I added 1 pound of lean sausage to which I browned 1/2 a large sweet onion when the sausage was about half done.  I also added more cheese than the recipe called for - I kind of "eye balled" the amount of cheese.  We love cheese.  I also added about 1 T Italian seasoning to the egg mixture for a little more flavor and I added 5 large mushrooms.  Since there are only 2 of us, I made this in 2 smaller square pans.  One of them I cooked and one I lined with plastic wrap before adding the pasta mixture.  I put the extra pan in the freezer to cook later.  I will then pull this out of the pan and freeze it with my meal sealer for quick dinner my husband can put back in the pan and pop in the oven on a night I work late. I baked this with foil on top for the first 30 minutes, as others suggested, to keep it from drying out.  Next time I will add twice as much spinach and even more mushrooms.

this is a great easy meal! thanks for sharing! I did make a few changes per other reviewer's suggestions. I used whole wheat pasta (personal preference),  2 full bottles of sauce (24 oz, Spicy tomato Basil-highly suggested-very good), 1-8 oz package of Italian style cheese as my first layer, and about 8 oz of cheddar and mozzarella for the top. I also added mushrooms in with the spinach and about 1 tbsp of minced garlic with some garlic salt (I eyeballed it, maybe a tsp). I baked covered for 35 minutes, then uncovered for another 10. DELISH! On my bi-weekly menu for sure!

This was just ok. Plus, he calorie count is ridiculously wrong-- it says this makes 12 servings, which it does not, so it's not as healthy as it looks either. I would say it makes 4, maybe 6 servings. It's definitely not worth 700 calories (or more) a serving.

This recipe has became a hit in our household!  I made this one evening, during Lent, because I had all of the ingredients on hand!  My husband (who loves food with meat and is never happy with anything when I use spinach for the main ingredient) could not stop eating it!  He has also already requested that I make it again for him!  Scrumptious and simple, I love it!

The recipe is quite yummy but lacks a lot of taste due to minimal spices.  I would add garlic and onion powder at least.  I also tried to add a little more protein and crumbled tofu into the mixture.

This is a great quick and easy recipe for nights when you just don't really want to put that much effort into cooking. The casserole tastes great as is, and works even better the next day as lunch. It was also very tasty when made with a 6-cheese blend I picked up at the corner store. Yum.

Absolutely delicious! I added Fontina cheese for a little zip and some smoked Mozz as well. Also, was extrememly liberal with the garlic, pepper and crushed red, as we like a little heat. The spinach flavor is not very pronounced, so it's a great way to get non-veggie eaters their daily does.

This is a great vegetarian pasta dish!  I'm always on the hunt for an easy, meatless dish and since I was craving  something saucey, this fit the bill.  I used crushed Italian flavored croutons, an extra egg, water instead of oil, and grated Parmesan cheese for my spinach mixture.  I baked it in my Pampered Chef stoneware baking bowl and it came out perfect.  I can't wait to dig into some leftovers today :p  Thanks for an awesome addition to my vegetarian file!  :)

This was the first time I had cooked a vegeterian meal for my family and I was a little worried about the spinach just cuz my kids hate it (but I try to sneak it in) But we really enjoyed it. This will become a regular part of our menu...Thanks for the great recipe. Sonya

This was very good.  I only gave it 4 stars because I felt like I needed to modify it to make it 5 stars.  I basically doubled the cheese but cut the olive oil amount in half.  I also used fresh spinach and cooked it down with 1/2 onion minced and 2 garlic cloves minced.  I also bloomed about 1/2 tsp of oregano and a 1/2 tsp of thyme and added it to the bread crumbs.  And I used italian bread crumbs.  All of these things enhanced the flavor and made it a 5 star dish.  My family and friends loved this.

Yummy!!  My whole family even my picky 2 year old loves this recipe.  It has been an easy way for me to sneak vegetables in my kids diet.  Some nice additions:
-Don't layer it - just mix it all together.  This way you can just freeze it for later in the week.
-Sautee some onions, garlic and mushrooms to add to the mix.

Have made it once a week  and my family still gobbles it up!

This was good, but not overally great. I used two packs of spinach and 2 jars of spaghetti sauce. I ended up with enough to freeze a whole dinner and had one that night.

So I made this recipe keeping in mind previous suggestions from others.. I sauteed the spinach in garlic, covered the dish with tin foil so the cheese wouldn't harden, used seasoned breadcrumbs, seasoned sauce, and added my own seasonings. I also added my own twist and added purple onion, red pepper and green pepper since I had them in my fridge and needed to use them up. I also added one pound of cooked ground beef. With all of that said this dish was OKAY... it wasn't horrible.. and it wasn't great.. I guess I was expecting something more with the high rating. I probably wouldn't make this again for our family.. it seemed like too much prep for just an okay dinner. No one complained and we ate it all but I just don't see this as a 5 star dinner. I would definitely make this for pot luck or a party since there was tons of food to go around!

This was absolutely delicious, a real hit with my vegetarian kids! To appease my carnivorous boyfriend, I made meatballs & sauce on the side, added them to the top of his dish when serving.  The only change I made was in reducing the olive oil slightly and using Italian-seasoned bread crumbs.  While I was concerned at some of the views noting "blandness", my family thought it was just fine.  I will definitely be serving this one again, thanks so much!

I have no idea what all the hoopla is about this recipe; as is quite bland.  As per what often happens on this site, people rate it after they have made changes.

Says my 7 year old:  "Mom, this isn't good . . . it's GREAT!"  I found it surprisingly flavorful.  However, I used Italian bread crumbs and I sauteed the spinach in the olive oil with a minced clove of garlic.  This is a great meal for the days when at 4:00 I realize that I have no idea what's for dinner - I typically have all these ingredients in the house.  A must try!

This is super easy and very good. I used only 2 tbs of olive oil and italian seasoned breadcrumbs (less than 1/2 a cup). I sauteed a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach in a little bit of olive oil and garlic. Next time I might use even more spinach. Definitely a keeper.

Just finished my 2nd helping!  So easy with ingredients I had on hand.  I added some minced garlic and my bread crumbs were the seasoned type, so it wasn't bland at all.

I used whole wheat fusilli instead of shells for this recipe. Overall it was excellent. I was tempted to skip the eggs and bread crumbs but went ahead anyway and my advice is don't skip it...it sounds odd but gives the whole thing a nice texture that holds together without affecting the taste.

Good starting point but i agree with other reviewers-needs more spices! I added 1 TB of Italian spice and 1 C fresh parmesan.  Much better and kids love it.

This is a pretty good recipe. My husband said it tasted like "light lasagna". I did make some changes base on other reviewers' suggestions. First, I used penne noodles instead of shells. I thawed the frozen spinach for just 5 minutes by letting it sit on the counter, then sauteed it with minced garlic, parsley, Italian seasonings, and a dash of red pepper flakes.  I mixed the bread crumbs with the olive oil and eggs before mixing with the noodles and spinach. For those who said the eggs and bread crumbs sounded odd, you do not taste them they just help to hold everything together. It may go without saying, but use a bowl with a lid to toss the ingredients around in... its much easy to just shake the bowl then to mix all the stuff together with a spoon. For the cheese, I used only 2/3 of the bag of chedder, and 1 and 1/4 bag of mozzerella. I also added 1/4 cup of parmesan. I covered the casserole with greased aluminum foil before putting in the oven and baked for 40 min. After the 40 min., I removed the aluminum foil and baked for an additional 10 minutes and then let it cool on the counter for 15 minutes before serving.

It is a great starter recipie.  I sauted the spinach with onion, galic salt, crushed red pepper and oregano.  I also added grape tomatoes with the sauce, did half regular bread cumbs and the other half seasoned and only put cheese on the top.(Trying to make it more low fat.)  With all that there was a lot of taste and it was really yummy:)  My hubby loved it! Thanks

We like this very much.  My kids both ate it and my daughter was especially happy as she is vegetarian. I didn't make any intentional changes b/c I thought the recipe would work well as is. But I only had rotini on hand, so I used that instead of shells. Also, I used a canola/olive oil blend, seasoned bread crumbs and a combination of kraft 4-cheese italiano and cheddar. Spinach- cheese - tomato sauce recipes do not typically need a lot of additional spices and flavour.  The point is to taste the spinach and not be distracted by other flavours that might over power.

really easy to make and the whole family loved it. i made a few modifications and it turned out fantastic: substituted skim milk for most of the olive oil, added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, dried basil and dried oregano to the egg mixture, sauteed fresh spinach and mushrooms with garlic instead of the frozen spinach, baked covered for 35 minutes and uncovered for 10. lastly, i added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with italian herbs for some more texture and flavor. YUM!

The finished product was absolutely perfect. I did make some changes though. First I cooked some chicken with some italian herbs, then I used fresh spinach and cooked it with some olive oil and garlic. It smelled so good mixing the garlic in. I mixed one egg in some milk instead of oil to make it more creamier. 

For the sauce I used half pasta sauce and  half of Safeways "Tuscan Tomato and Basil Bisque. It's a soup but it makes the best pasta sauce. You MUST try it. So it turned out to be a creamy tomato sauce. Also, instead of the layers I mixed everything together. I put half the pasta on the bottom and then half a cup of ricotta cheese and some mozzarella cheese, then the rest of the pasta and the rest of the ricotta and some more mozzarella. I will definitely make this again. It did take a while to make, but its sure worth it. :)

This has the potential to be 5 stars. I made the recipe as stated except put the cheese on top the last 15 minutes. Next time I will use fresh spinach and sautee in the olive oil with some fresh garlic.  Another plus is that this is super easy to make.

This recipe was very basic and so i added a little something extra.........i added a bit of feta to the pasta along with sauteed onions, mushrooms and some celery and a bit of granulated garlic and a roasted garlic and red pepper seasoning. also i used fresh spinach, rather than frozen and i just gave it a rough chop before adding it to the pan. this was a bit hit in our family

AMAZING!

this is a hearty, easy-to-make recipe. After reading other reviewers' comments, made a few alterations for extra flavor.

- to cut down on the fat content, i used 1tbs of olive oil and added skim milk to get a 1/4 cup mixture
- used fresh spinach, blanched and chopped and sauteed with one clove of minced garlic for extra flavor
- instead of bread crumbs, i used crushed garlic croutons
- added salt and pepper to taste
- also baked the casserole covered with foil for the first 35min and removed the foil to bake for the last 10min to prevent an overly tough/burnt top layer of cheese.

this is a great recipe whether made as is or with a few special touches added. Can be prepared in advance and can skip the layering of the ingredients if in a rush. just mix it all together n dump it in the pan before adding a layer of cheese on top.

i'm sure anyone who decides to give this recipe a try will not be disappointed.

This was great!  I brought it to the neighborhood 4th of July party and everyone wanted the recipe!  The only thing I would change is that I don't think it is necessary to pre-cook the spinach.  I'll definitely make it again!

simple and fast. I halved the recipe and used less cheese. The only thing I would do different is add a bit of garlic powder or italian seasonings to give it a little more kick. A new favorite.

This was great for the whole family (even my picky toddler).  It needed a little more sauce and I did add garlic salt, Italian seasonings, and onion powder to add flavor.  I baked it covered with foil for 30 minutes and uncovered for fifteen.  This kept the cheese from browning too much.  This will definitely become a regular in our household.  Thanks!

I read other reviews and decided to create my own recipe. I left out the bread crumbs and tomato basil sauce. I added onion, velveeta (~1/4 log), mozzarella with jalapeno (~1/4 cup) and I used spaghetti noodles (the only noodles I had). It turned out fantastic!

Delicious!  I mixed 1 cup ricotta with the mozzarella, and added a sprinkle of basil, oregano, thyme, onion, garlic, salt and pepper.  Still could use a bit more.  Next time I'll add lots of garlic.  But it's yummy, filling, and easier than lasagna! I made 1 8x8 for dinner tonight, and 3 rectangular foil dishes for the freezer.

This dish was wonderful.  I used the substituted balsamic vinegar instead of white and white wine instead of water like the others had suggested and it was fantastic. I also used crushed red pepper spice instead of chili powder.  The gravy does taste great with mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks

This was great, and fairly easy also. I got my whole family to eat it, even the 5 year old. At first they were nervous because of the spinach but everyone tried it and enjoyed it. Will definitely make again. I liked the idea of a main dish with no meat, however you could easily add some if that is what you prefer.

Adjusted the amounts for 6.  Halved the amount of pasta but left the amount of spinach and sauce the same.  Added sliced baby bellas, 1 T garlic, salt, crushed red pepper, white pepper, and Italian seasoning.  Sauteed the shrooms in garlic OO.  Added the last layer of cheeses during the last 15 minutes of baking.  Served with a salad and Italian red wine.

This will probably be a standard dish in my house when I'm too tired to cook. Super easy. Delicious, but unexciting. Something you can eat on a regular basis but wouldn't make for company or a potluck. I used zucchini instead of spinach, although I would have preferred spinach. (I didn't have any.) Also, I added cubed chicken to the top layer. (two breasts) I cooked it covered except the last 10 minutes. I only used mozzarella cheese and only one layer in the middle, not two. I omitted the cheddar cheese because that seemed to be too many flavors and too cheesy. I think I ended up with the perfect amount of cheesiness and probably used about 12 oz of just mozzarella. Some of my family topped their servings with fresh cilantro and parmesan cheese.

This is edible, but so bland. I added garlic and italian seasoning but it didn't help much. I guess it depends on the pasta sauce you use, I used Muir Glen Organic Tomato Basil sauce. I don't think the sauce was the problem however. I think this just needs way more seasoning and definitely could have used more spinach. Would double next time. Artichokes would be good also. This recipe is a good starting point - but to make it good - it needs changes!!

This recipe was great!  I made a couple of changes.  I added a pound of mild ground Italian sausage.  Also, I used two 24 oz. jars of tomato basil garlic pasta sauce, one 16 oz. box medium shell pasta, and Italian bread crumbs.  My husband loved this recipe!  This definitely is a keeper.

Delicious taste, but cooking time is a bit off...I went by what the directions had and the top noodles came out super crispy.  So next time I will take it down by 5 mins and see, but this is a for sure keeper.  I sauteed my own spinach with some EVOO and garlic, but that's the only change I made.  So tasty and so few ingredients!  Cheap and easy, I LOVED it!

All I can is that my husband who HATES spinach ate this dish and even went back for seconds!

The only thing I changed was the sauce. i used a package of basil tomato seasoning, a jar of diced tomatoes and a small one of tomato paste. So the sauce had a slightly different consistancy, but it was still good.

I love this recipe, though I do change a few things. I use 2 different flavored sauces and I also sprinkle with basil and oregano at the end. I've made this recipe with a variety of veggies including black olives, mushrooms, and red, yellow, green and orange peppers. I also sauté garlic with the veggies.

This was tasty but took awhile to complete. I would save this recipe for a weekend dish when there is more time to prepare it. I changed up the recipe a little. Used fresh spinach sautéed in olive oil with fresh minced garlic, chopped purple onion, a can of mushrooms, a can of drained diced tomatoes, and a can of sliced black olives. Seasoned the spinach with Italian blend, sea salt, pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper. I used the egg and bread crumbs although the egg sounded odd.  After the pasta was cooked, I tossed it with the spinach and egg mixture as well as added a jar of the marinara sauce. Layered the pasta at the bottom of this dish, followed by a layer of shredded cheddar cheese, marinara sauce, pasta and topped with cheddar cheese. Covered the entire dish with foil. Baked for 30 minutes covered and an additional 10 minutes uncovered. Served with homemade breaded chick strips. Good meal for serving to a crowd. Hubby loved it, teenage daughter picked out the spinach.

As written,  I can only give this recipe 3 stars as it was exptremely bland as some other reviewers have mentioned.  However, I loved the texture which I think must come from the eggs.  It is real creamy comfort food!  I added garlic salt and tabasco to individual servings of this dish to make it flavorful enough for me.  With these additions, I thought it was great.

This was a very comforting and filling dish.  I will probably make this again, but I won't use as much cheese.  I know that it is called a "cheesy" casserole, but it was too much.  And, next time, I will leave out the cheddar.  I felt that it didn't blend well with the other flavors of the dish.

Rated a 5+ by our three international students!  Was it the pound of cheese? I would like to think it was the use of sauteed kale and mustard from our garden in lieu of frozen spinach. Tossed in a few black olives and mushrooms for good measure.

I gave this a 4 because i made some adjustments, i just added more veggies and i also put some basil pesto sauce in the egg mixture and i used parmesan bread crumbs, when i saw the recipe it looked like it would be bland.  But i loved the outcome, would highly suggest putting some green bell pepper in the veggie mix because that really gave it an awesome flavor, plus i used the spinach, onions and fresh mushrooms.  Was delish.  Also didnt use quite as much cheese as suggested, i am a huge cheese fan but it just seemed like it would be too much.

I am giving this five stars because my husband told me that he was very impressed with this dish. I wasn't exactly happy with the pasta I chose to use but it still was good. I used ricotta and mozzarella and fried the spinach in some onion and garlic after microwaving to cook. I also added ground beef. I definitely would make again.

Very good and easy!  I modified by replacing much of the oil with milk, as recommended by other reviewers.  I also only had one jar of pasta sauce, but had a half jar of alfredo sauce so used that for the top layer. Fantastic, and my 3-year old didn't even pick out the spinach!

I was looking for a new recipe for my husband, who is a vegetarian, and this one is a definite keeper. It turned out awesome. The spinach flavor was good, not too overwhelming.I used italian seasoned bread crumbs which gave it great flavor. The eggs really held it together well. I was worried about using cheddar, but the flavor was really good mixed with the mozzarella cheese, not what I was expecting. The only thing I might try next time is adding some mushrooms.

This was pretty straightforward, but I am lot in love with it.  The pasta mixture needs extra seasoning-- salt, pepper, garlic.  It was really filling, though!

This is a great recipe to hide spinach in.  My kids love it and have not figured out the spinach is in it.

I make a bunch of this and freeze it in aluminum pan.  It makes for a quick dinner.

I used frozen spinach because they were out of fresh spinach, and I didn't really like the flavor of it.  Everybody else, however, loved it!  Next time, I will make it with fresh spinach, and I'm sure I'll like it better that way.

Ok,this was really good,but It needed a little something. I added some mushrooms and garlic (sauted). The part of the directions that threw me off was,used thawed spinach, then cook in a pot with a 1/2 cup of water? Are you supposed to drain it or what? I just microwaved the frozen spinach for 7 minuetes and did not drain,added it to the pasta and it came out great. I also cut the oil to a tablespoon and added a little milk to the egg mixture. Kept it covered for the first 1/2 and sprinkled some parm on top of the cheeses. Next time I think I might add some ricotta.

This is a great recipe for people who want something inexpensive, easy, but still tastes great! I think it only cost me $12 to buy the ingredients. I made dinner for 3 people and have been eating the leftovers ever since. You can also easily add your own personal touches. I had fresh basil left over from another recipe, so I added that to the spinach. It was a tasty addition!

Excellent with some easy modifications.

Reviewers who said this needed spices are so right - we added garlic and fresh basil, as well as a little salt and pepper.  Fresh spinach also makes this livelier.   This was great with the Muir Glen Spicy Tomato Sauce.

This recipe was really really good. I followed the directions the first time but then later added my own little kicks to it later. I added red and yellow bellpeppers, onion and some smoked sausage to mine. It made it so flavorful. My Husband and Kids eat and eat this. I would recommend this to anyone who loves pasta dishes.

This recipe was really yummy. I followed the recommendation of previous reviews and added ricotta cheese in the cheese layers, used fresh spinach sauted with lots of minced garlic, added dried oregano to the egg mixture, and added sliced provolone cheese to the top.  I baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for the last 15 minutes.  Served with mixed greens with sliced olives, chick peas, and artichoke hearts with store bought Italian dressing.  A yummy vegetarian meal.  Oh, also substituted soy pasta for regular pasta as we are trying to stay away from wheat as much as possible.  It's a little weird in texture, but worth the "goodness" as it provides lots of protein :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed making and eating this! I customized it a little, though. I sauteed fresh spinach in olive oil and garlic while the pasta was cooking. I used another reviewer's suggestion of italian bread crumbs and another reviewer's suggestion of skim milk. And I agree that it is really filling.

As the recipe on its own I found it to be bland only kicked up by the sauce you use. But as a template for an amazing casserole it rocks. I used Gluten-free pasta and needed a little more sauce. Loaded mine up with veggies. Thanks for the ideas

I rhought this tasted like stove-top stuffing with canned soup--additions, including cheddar cheese in place of the American cheese, didn't save the taste.  Only the 1-year old ate it--the 3 and 6-year olds left it on their plates.

Omitted the bread crumbs, used fresh spinach (sauteed in a bit of olive oil with sliced mushrooms), used Bertolli garlic and olive oil pasta sauce. Mixed it altogether as one reviewer said, I was too lazy to layer.

I'm new at cooking and this recipe is one of the easiest/tastiest I've made so far! I overcooked the cheese a little, but it still tasted delicious! I also used frozen whole spinach leaves cuz I couldn't find chopped (organic). My teenage sister loved it! 
I dislike cooking, but if there were more easy recipes like this out there I'd probably enjoy making it...

My family enjoyed this meal! I think it could be even better if you season it to suit your tastes, for us that means as much garlic as possible. My husband was disappointed at the lack of meat, but this is definitely a keeper in my book!

Use this recipe as a base & go from there.  I used my own quick homemade sauce to cut back on sodium, etc.  The sauce in itself was seasoned perfectly but when I used it for the recipe I found that it was not seasoned enough as indicated by others.  Go heavier.  I did lightly saute fresh spinach & even added garlic.  I did NOT use all that cheese - maybe 1/2-2/3 of the amount called for.  The cheese would only have added FAT - it would not have made a difference with taste. I added a little water to the can of tomatoes that I used & used that with the egg.  I did not add the bread crumbs... combo of I forgot & didn't think it would add anything - I could be wrong.  So.... go heavier on seasonings/spices because it has to go a long way.  Oh... I used corkscrew pasta - good choice.

We tried this dish because it looked like a fast and easy supper, would be delicious and good for us. This recipe was all these things!  I love incorporating spinach in pasta. My husband loves lots of tomato sauce. This dish satisfied both our preferences. It makes good use of foods that are probably already in one's pantry. It makes enough to serve quite a few people and, like all good recipes, is adaptable. There's no fussing making a sauce, good for a speedy dinner and this would be very kid friendly. I may take this to my next potluck!  Thanks for this!

I have tried this recipe. The only thing I would say is NEVER put spinach in water. add a touch of butter or oil( very little) in pan and do it this way. It is healthier and tastier. other than that  very good.

Sooooo good! As per other reviews: I doubled the cheese, added onions, garlic, Italian seasoning. I cooked it covered for the first 30 minutes and then took the lid off. DELICIOUS!

We loved this!  I had all the ingredients on-hand, and the egg/olive oil/breadcrumb mixture made this pasta bake seem a little fancier than others.  Next time I'll use fresh spinach sauteed with onion and garlic and red pepper flakes to give this even more flavor.

I added a bit more spinach to up the health factor, but then I also added olives (which probably made it less healthy).  Still, this recipe is WONDERFUL as is, I just had olives on hand and craved them haha.

Instead of real bread crumbs, I lightly toasted some pumpernickel and I think that added a nice bit of spice to the casserole as well.

Delicious! Hubby ate three helpings! The only thing I did differently was add garlic salt, Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper to the egg mixture. I'm always afraid jar spaghetti sauce will be too bland so that's why I added that and everything was great.

This was great.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was bc I did add seasonings based on others reviews (Just 2 tablespoons of a pasta herb blend).  I also sauteed spinach in garlic before adding.  This was very easy and tasted great the next day too.

We thought this was good, but not great.  Definitely worth making again, but nothing amazing.  I used a Newman's own sauce, which was great.  It wasn't tomato basil (used what I had), but I added some basil.

This wasn't bad. I thought the breadcrumbs and egg would be weird but it wasn't. The cheese does get pretty hard so it would be a good idea to cook with foil and then take off. I will try with milk next time like other users. I will make again!

My family, including my 12 year old vegetarian daughter, LOVE this dish!!  I, also, made it to take to a tailgating party at a horse show and it was a real HIT!! The only thing that I changed was to add a little less of the cheese.... AWESOME!!

This is a great base recipe, it was kind of fun to be creative.  I added fresh basil, garlic, onions, zuccini, mushrooms, and black olives. I also used italian bread cumbs rosemary and oregano. i covered it while baking and broiled it for just a minute or two to get the cheese lightly browned at the end...  my husband loved it. very good flavor..

This was very good and so simple/easy to make! It's sort of like lasagna but not as heavy or complicated to make! My picky husband liked it! I used meat pasta sauce because that's what I had at home and used penne pasta instead of the seashell one but came out perfectly.

This wasn't very tasty. Perhaps with the suggestions that other people made, but in itself, it wasn't very good. It was pretty plain. I don't think I'll make it again.

I have made this casserole again and again without disapointment.  Like other reviewers, I have chosen a variety of other vegetables for this recipe and been happy with the results each time.  One adjustment that I have made recently is replacing the white pasta with whole wheat (wholemeal).  Much healthier and the taste was enhanced with another dimension of flavour.  A keeper, for sure!

I put this recipe in my box in 2003--I can't believe I waited 6 1/2 years to try it!  It is very good--I did only use 12 oz. penne, 1/2 the amount of cheese (DH's diet), garlic and homemade Italian-style bread crumbs.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is that DH thought it wasn't spicy enough.

Yum!  I used the bigger seashell pasta shells. I only used 1 tblsp of olive oil & ended up using 2 jars of spaghetti sauce.  Also, I only used about 1 cup of cheddar cheese and a little over 2 c of mozzarella (had a little left in one bag, so it went in).  Everyone loved this!

I was glad to find this recipe.  I "eye-balled" some of the ingredients, like the cheeses, just because I know what my family likes!  I also make my own sauce and I did add a lot of garlic (again, because I know what my family likes!)in addition to some oregano and basil.  The addition of the bread crumbs was, for me, a new component of this kind of baked pasta dish.  My four-year old loved it, so I will be making it again!

This is a good base recipe. I messed around with it a bit though. 1. I sprayed the bottom of the casserole with cooking spray. I mixed (bowtie) pasta in with spinach and cheese. 2. Instead of putting bread crumbs in with the pasta I made a bread crumb topping by mixing premade bread crumbs with cheese and sprinkling it over the top for a crunchy crust. 3. i also kicked up my sauce up by adding extra herbs. Very good recipie, I'll make it again! Very yummy!

I made this for a co-worker as she is out after back surgery and we are providing dinners.  Though I am hesitant to share my cooking skills (or lack there of) with others, the recipe looked fairly easy and the reviews were good.   I didn't change much, just a little garlic and basil to the spinach and increasing the amount of pasta.  Today she reported that it was a huge hit with her family (even two young boys).  She is very sweet, so I was skeptical.  However, she brought me a sample (it made a ton!) and it was actually really good! I think the only think I would do with reheating is add a little margarine to melt over the pasta (but I am a margarine person anyway) to make it more "wet".

This was very good. I was looking for something to go with italian baked chicken and this was perfect. I had some extra spaghetti sauce already made and I think the ground beef reaaly spiced it up, although Im sure it would have been fine with out it. My boyfriend wants me to make a larger version (I cut the recipe in half b/c I cook for two) and put italian sauasage so it could be a main dish!

My boyfriend and I made this for Valentine's Day dinner. It was easy to make and had great taste. The second layerof cheese we only put a little and then when there was 15 minutes left we put the rest on. It was delectable.

This was an awesome base for a chicken and spinach casserole.  I made some of the suggested modifications.  I sauted the spinach with 3 clove of garlic and a small spanish onion for added flavor.  I also added rotisserie chicken (because I'm feeding a family of men and did not want to cook a meat dish separate).  It came out great!  Thank you soooo much.

My boyfriend and I tried this one. We did not like it one bit. The eggs and the olive oil made the pasta taste funny. Would not recommend and I probably won't be making this one again.

Very good, I did not have any bread crumbs, but I don't think it made a difference. I also added some parm cheese to the top.

This was great! Brought it to a potluck at work and it went over big. I brought the dish home empty. I used fresh spinach and sauteed it first in a little olive oil and fresh garlic. I will definitely make again.  This is a keeper.

This was a great casserole!  My man loved it, and I thought it was super easy to fix.  I used radiator pasta, and I had some extra Ricotta so I added that in and it was like a super easy veggie lasagna.  Lasted for several meals and reheated well.

Great recipe! Alterations make it a 5 star! I read some reviews that said this could be bland, so I added right over a tsp each of garlic salt, garlic powder, of italian seasoning. I like things with plenty of flavor and seasoning, but with this recipe you can season it to your tastes! In the end, I halved everything except the eggs, used canned spinach, mixed everything together with the sauce, except the cheese and threw in 2 cans of drained mushrooms, a small diced tomato, and 1/2 a cup of parmesan. The cheddar and mozz went in the middle and on top. This recipe is pretty much foolproof and a great base to start with! I cooked this all for 30 minutes in a 8x8 pan, but a 9x13 would be a little less stuffed. *Update, I've also now added 8oz of cottage cheese to this when I mix everything together in the bowl. Also I've added finely chopped zucchini, which adds nutrition without affecting the taste. Delish!

This recipe can be used as a great starting point for various tastes.  I love very spicy, flavorful dishes and ended up adding a lot of spices to suit my taste.  I added salt to taste, 1 tablespoon each of black and red pepper, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, about 1/2 tablespoon basil.  Like others, I cut out almost all of the olive oil and substituted w/milk.  I sauteed the spinach (frozen) with 1 onion.  I also used only 1 egg.  We used about 1.5 packages of the cheese - I thought that 2 full packages was just too much.  But with these changes, we found the result to be delicious.  It made about 6 adult sized servings.

I would give this 5 stars except that I tweaked the recipe a little...I sauteed fresh spinach leaves for about 1 1/2 minutes with 2 cloves of crushed garlic and about 1/3 of a finely chopped red onion, and instead of cheddar, I used parmesan in conjunction w/the mozerella. I also add defrosted, quartered meatballs from Trader Joe's because my boyfriend likes meat. I cooked it covered with aluminum for 30 mins, uncovered for 15 mins. Very good!

This was an excellent dish!  Lots of flavor and SO pretty!  My mom, my 2-year-old son, and I loved it!  I'm definitely adding this to my recipe box!   

I made some changes to the recipe based on ingredients I had available and tried to make it more healthy.  I used whole wheat pasta, 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 plus adding 1 drop of sesame oil, whole wheat bread crumbs, substituted parmesean cheese for mozzarella cheese, 2 egg whites, and the new Bertolli Premium sauce.  

** I made this a 2nd time and used the pasta I had on hand, a can of italian stewed tomatoes with the spaghetti sauce.  I also used egg whites.  Everything else was the same.  This is a really good recipe!

This was delicious and my whole family loved it.  I did make a few alterations.  I sauted 1 onion, 2 cloves of garlic and a large can of mushrooms in olive oil then I added the spinach to this mixture.  I also added lots of herbs (rosemary garlic blend, Italian blend).  I also used Italian bread bread crumbs.

I finally cooked this recipe the other night and followed it almost to a T. Only difference is I used vegetable oil instead of Olive. I also had a couple ounces more of shells and spinach, but other than that it was excellent!! I too thought that I would want more cheese, but 16 ounces was good enough. I also seasoned the spinach as it was cooking with garlic and sage and that alone was really tasty. Everyone in my family absolutely loved it though, and I took some with me to work today and it's amazing as left-overs too! Thank you!

I made thins twice now and both times it was great! The first time I made it I followed the recipe and totally loved it.  I even ate it for lunch and another dinner.  The second time I thought I add some ground beef and carrots.  Just as good and my son loved the carrots!

Delicious! I needed a vegetarian dish and this was perfect. The vegetarian thought so as well. Fairly easy to make, I did add more sauce than it called for, used 2 entire jars, but I might have had a little too much pasta as well. The 2nd time I made it, added mushrooms because I love mushrooms, and that came out just as well. Plan on making again soon. Thanks for posting this!

My family loves this dish.  I made it just as the recipe says and it turned out great.  I don't know that it needs to cook as long as the recipe says though.  If the pasta gets dried out, try cutting back on the cooking time a little.

This turned out to be relatively quick to prepare and tasted really good.  I managed to get by with about half as much of the pasta sauce.  We didn't have breadcrumbs on hand, but the same amount of crushed crackers (Triscuits) seemed to do the trick.  Great to take to school in a tupperware to heat up for lunch.

I thought this recipe was superb!  I only used about 1/2 the cheese the recipe called for and only 1 full jar of meat flavored sauce.  It didn't hide the spinach enough for my 5 year old to eat it, but he ate "around" the spinach anyhow.  Instead of mixing the bread crumbs into the pasta mixture, I spinkled 1/2 on between layers.  This dish makes a pretty presentation also!  Thanks for submitting it!

My family loved this casserole.  The spinach and bread crumbs where what made the casserole more interesting and tasty.  I used a package of fresh spinach, since that is what I had in the house.  Will definitely make this again.  My 17 y/o suggested adding ricotta cheese next time.  Like other reviewers we will try ricotta next time.

Pretty boring, but easy.  There is so much cheese, I don't think you can even begin to call it healthy. This is an addition to the original review: A decade later and I'm still making this dish. But, now with a couple of kids, I think this one is now on the healthy side of our new scale. By the way, tonight, I realized I was out of frozen spinach, so I cut asparagus into inch pieces, and used that instead. Precook two minutes. Yum!

This wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. It lacked flavor. Everyone who tasted it thought it was blah. I wouldn't make again.

I love this recipe.  I have made it a couple of times and always use about half the spinach but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  It always gets great reviews!

Used ricotta instead of cheddar, first layer of cheese just ricotta and last w/ mozzarella. Sauteed garlic w/ the spinach & used milk instead of oil.

This was a very easy and tasty dish.  I substituted broccoli for the spinach and sauteed some garlic to add a bit more flavor.  I also used a lot less sauce to really taste the broccoli flavor.  I used sliced low fat provolone for the top.   I also omitted the oil for a healthier meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good. My mother and I had this and we both added some parmesan cheese on the top.  I ran out of sauce so some of the pasta was a little crunchy but that was my own fault.  I will make this again... and again!

Super easy and good!  I added some Italian herbs, garlic and parmesan cheese to the mix.  Next time I will add some wine to the sauce to liven it up.

My boyfriend absolutely loves this recipe! The only thing I changed was added some more bread crumbs (and I used italian crumbs at that). I even messed up on my layers one night because I was distracted and it still came out wonderful!

Great recipe! 
My modifications/brand selections:
1) Pasta = Ronzini Gluten-Free Penne and Rotini.
2) Pasta Sauce = Classico Traditional Sweet Basil
2) Added Morning Star Veggie Grillers Crumbles (like ground beef). Sautéed in Garlic, Ground Pepper, and Salt first. Then added to the pasta/spinach/bread crumb mixture.
3)  Sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the entire casserole.
4) Baked uncovered in 45 minutes.

Thank you for the inspiration! I think the cheddar flavor is what makes this special because many times, these casseroles only use the mozzarella. I did make my tweeks as everyone should if they want and it still turned out great! 
I used a homemade marinara sauce. I also used Dayia cheese substitute in both cheddar and mozzarella. I opted out of the eggs and changed the bread crumbs to a tenderized bag of Italian Crotons. Instead of sea shell pasta, I used a rigatoni. I also just sautéed frozen spinach while I did my onions and garlic which was the base for my homemade sauce prior to spices, crushed tomatoes, etc.
It turned out fabulous! Will make again =) Thanks again!

I had a bag of fresh spinach, some fresh mushrooms and a couple of bags of shredded Mozzarella and sharp Cheddar cheese sitting in my fridge, a box of shells with 3 oz. left, and a box of tri color rotini with about 5 oz. left.  This recipe was very simple to make, and didn't take long to put together.  I took other's advice and added garlic, oregano, a bit of black pepper and basil. It came out awesome! My husband loved it, and with no meat and basically no fat but the olive oil, seems pretty healthy.  Very versatile recipe, add chicken or beef - or not- and flavor it the way you like. It's a keeper!

I like to add mushrooms, minced garlic, and ground Italian sausage. Perfect to make ahead and freeze. Thaw in fridge overnight. Cover with tinfoil and bake at 350 @ 35 minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 10 minutes. Delicious!

I made a few changes, but I really don't agree with people who said it was bland, WOW! The only changes I made were that I sauteed the spinach with 1 minced onion and 3 cloves minced garlic, and it turned out wonderfully! I would also actually suggest that you bake it for 30 minutes, then add the last layer of cheese only for the last 15 minutes to prevent burning.

Double the cheese and a few liberal shakes of pizza seasoning on each layer, and this is a winner!  To save pots, I threw the spinach in with the pasta for the last few minutes.  I also cut way back on the olive oil; I used 3 tablespoons and think it was plenty.  Good dinner--thank you!!

This recipe tasted good but not great, in my opinion. I did a small change of using small shell and layering the middle layer of cheese with the chedding only and then the top layer with mozz cheese only.

Followed recipe closely.  Used penne instead of shells.  Sprinkled garlic powder over each sauce layer.  Added pepperoni slices which I cut in quarters.   Soooooo yummy!  Came out of pan when cut like lasagna (not spooned out).  Really great and easy to make.  Good weeknight yummy dinner!!!!

really easy recipe to make, and my very picky boyfriend loved it. i usually like to try stuff exactly as the recipe states the first time around, but since some reviews stated it can be kind of bland i did add 1 teaspoon each of the following: onion powder, garlic powder, and italian seasoning just in case. it tasted good but i'll definitely up the seasonings next time or perhaps try the recommendations to cook and season fresh spinach. will definitely make again though.

Made this for my vegetarian grandma. She loved it!! My hubby and our 2 year old ate really liked it too! This is a dish to be proud of! I definitely made the mistake of buying a pack of shallow pans, but it worked out in my favor, instead of layering this dish I just made two seperate ones! Chicken or turkey would be an easy add in to this dish for those who want a full meal with meat!! Dont forget to season!!!! :) Definitely a 5 star dish for the fam!!!

This is a casserole that's easy to make and tastes great.  Instead of baking it in one large casserole dish, I made two smaller servings in Corningware dishes so we could eat one that night, and freeze the other for a busy night.  That came in handy -- and it tasted just as good reheated.

Great quick meal.  I omitted the bread crumbs as I didn't see the need for them and used less olive oil.  Everyone ate this..thanks!

I don't know, it tasted kind of bland to me. Maybe too much sauce? I think next time I might add some italian sausage if I make it again to make it taste more like pizza.

Wonderful as is.  I would add garlic next time just because I love garlic. :)  I did use more cheese than called for...for the same reason..

I loved this pasta dish, so did my husband. I used panko bread crumbs which worked well. Better than baked ziti!

This really is a nice dinner.  The spinach factor, while alarming for most, really is quite low-key - it's possible for picky eaters to enjoy this casserole without really ever knowing the offending spinach is in there!  And it only gets better - leftovers are even yummier than the firsties.  Serve with some nice crusty rolls.

I'll definately make this again!  My kids (16 and 13 yrs) loved it.  The only thing I changed is that I made it in two 8x8 pans, making only 1 layer in each (to share with a neighbor).  Since it was only 1 layer deep, I didn't bake as long as recipe states. Yummy!

This is awesome!  I made this for a vegetarian potluck, and it was the star dish...  I used rotini, as that was what I had on hand.  I'm sure you can use any pasta with this. I also used fresh spinach that I sauteed in a bit of olive oil. Yummy!

UPDATE: MY FRIEND & HER HUBBY LOVED THIS (MY FIANCE, NOT SO MUCH LOL)!!! This was "OK." To be fair, I must admit, I made a LOT of ch. Having said that, I do not believe they enhanced the end prod. As is, FBERLAGE's recipe is deserving of 3 *s (seemed very bland, hence the rating). Even w/ my "improvements," I would still give no more than 3 *s (sorry!). Here are my ch.: a) b/c I wanted to clear 2 (26) oz. cans of Hunt's pasta sauce from my pantry, I comb. what I had (trad. AND garlic & onion sauces) - & used BOTH cans (as opposed to 1 1/2 cans), b) I add. a ricotta layer (comb. 15 oz. ricotta, 1/4 c. 1/2-1/2, 1 1/2 c. Italian-blend cheese, 1/4 c. Parm, 1 t Italian seasoning, 1/2 t ea. s&p, 1 cloves minced garlic & a 10 oz. pkg. of thawed / drained spinach). I omitted the cheddar & used only Italian-blend cheese. I also used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs & 16 oz. of pasta (didn't see the point in wasting 4 oz. of a 16 oz. bag). I assembled everything in this order: sauce, noodle mix. (mix. as direct.), more sauce, ricotta, remaining noodles, rest of sauce & cheese. B/c I was delivering 1/2 to a friend, I divided = portions b/t 2 9 in. disposable pans. I baked my casserole, covered for 30 min. / uncovered for 15 min. Served w/ Dole's Autumn salad mix (yum!), garlic bread & cider, this was a nice fall meal. I still like my Pampered Chef stuffed shells recipe better, but I'm glad I gave this a try. Tx. FBERLAGE :)

This is a fantastic base to work from. I changed it a bit, but really appreciate the starting point. Because I got rave reviews, (even from my kid!) and my husband requested I write down what I did, I'll share my alterations here: I cut down the oil added to the pasta to 1 Tbsp. I had a ton of beets, so I used beet greens instead of spinach. I sautéed the greens with garlic, onion, and chopped bell pepper, in olive oil. Then, I added a chopped zucchini and a can of mushrooms, drained. Then, I grated a small beet into it all. Turned it red, but the sauce masked that. Plus, the beet couldn't be tasted at all! (I dig invisible nutrition, esp with kids!) Then, I cooked the pasta, and put some spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, layered pasta mixture, then greens mixture, then breadcrumbs (which I didn't have so I made some with toast), sauce, cheese, then repeated, topping with cheese. Baked it about 30-40 minutes, until the cheese was good and browned. It was delicious! Just as we started eating it, my hubby and I put red pepper flakes on for a little spice. I'd love it if someone tried it the same way, and told me how they liked it! My kid said, halfway through eating, "I'm getting seconds, this is so good!"

This is a great, quick pasta recipe. Everybody I've served it to likes it, from my picky, younger siblings (who rarely eat spinach but don't mind it in this), to my parents with their refined palettes. Also, you can change up the flavors to suit your taste by using your favorite combination of pasta sauces (mine is garden vegetable) and cheeses (mine is 5 cheese Italian blend).

I changed this recipe as suggested by others and used double the recommended cheese.  I topped with a sprinkling of parsley, basil, and oregano and baked about 35-40 minutes.  I recommend topping with crushed red pepper flakes before serving.  This dish was delicious.  My boyfriend nearly ate all of it in one day.  I will say that I probably wouldn't serve this as a main dish again.  I think it would go nicely with italian sausage or meatballs and sauteed veggies.

Doubled this recipe,used large shell pasta, added some cubed squash & extra cheese and spices, served with grilled lemon pepper chicken. Great dish!  My family loved it and I will surely be making it again. Thanks for another favorite!

Very good and easy!  I substituted ricotta for the cheddar and it was a big hit with my family.  My son even ate the spinach, and normally if there is anything green he won't touch it.

A good vegetarian recipe.  I scaled this recipe down to serve 3 so layering was pretty impossible, just didn't have a small enough pan.  I ended up mixing everything together and putting the cheese on top.  This is definately one of those recipes that would do better feeding tons of people rather than just a few.  Be sure to use a good quality sauce or homemade if you can do it and, like I did, add onions, garlic and other spices to your liking.  Would make again if I needed to feed a crowd.

This was good for a somewhat quick dinner.  I used my homemade sauce and didn't have the shell pasta so used rigatoni instead.  It does need some extra spice like garlic.

I was looking for a veggy dish for my daughter who doesn't eat meat (eggs ok) and found this.  Very good, quick, simple.  I used pepper jack cheese in place of just plain cheddar.  Delish!

Fabulous!  I love it!   I add a pound of Italian-spiced meat (ground turkey) and cook that with the spinach and garlic.  More flavorful.  And the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs are a must.

I just finished serving this for dinner and it received great feedback.  The recipe looked a little on the bland side so I added garlic, shallots, fresh mushrooms, fresh basil and I used whole wheat pasta.

I took others advice and added a bit to this recipe.  I used a head of roasted garlic, black olives, whole wheat pasta, and Italian flavored bread crumbs.  It's extremely filling and rich.  This would be great to bring to a potluck or large family dinner.  I held back on five stars only because I think it needs something crunchy to offset all the gooshy cheese and sauce.

This recipe was great!  I did add some garlic powder, pepper, and basil.  It baked in the time suggested.  I will definitely make this again.  Would also make a good freezer meal.

This is delicious!  I make it once every couple of months or so but changed it up a bit.  I use extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 package of Italian blend shredded cheese and 1/2 pkg of sharp cheddar along with Barilla Plus rotini pasta.  I buy two jars of different types of pasta sauce (24 oz) and use all of it.  And to give it a little more flavor, I add a clove of garlic after squeezing it through a garlic press.  Also, be sure to get any water out of the spinach before adding it to the mixture.  My non-vegetarian husband loves this as a main dish as well, and we always have plenty remaining for leftovers.

Great recipe!

We used whole wheat pasta and it came out great.

Also added garlic and onion to the spinache in the pan.

This was really yummy w/some minor changes. I sautéed fresh spinach in EVOO & garlic. Made my own sauce and used a bit more than the recipe called for and more cheese since hubby loves cheese. Everyone loved it including my picky 6 year old. It's a keeper!

I cut the amount of this recipe way down, as I only cook for myself.  I used elbow pasta instead of shells, added ground Morningstar (salt/pepper/garlic/basil), and used italian breadcrumbs.  The mixture of cheeses was great, flavors were awesome and I have more than enough for leftovers!

Loveed this one!  Used Ragu mushroom pasta sauce (a little less quantity then in the recipe) and used garlic parmesan croutons, which I made into bread crumbs.  Used a little more cheese and added a bit of parmesan cheese.....This makes enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch the next day!.....Everyone in the family loved it!!!!!!!!

delicious base recipe. for added flavor, use a tomato sauce of your choice. i used a roasted garlic spaghetti sauce which added tons of flavor. i also added more vegetables that my family enjoys. this is a quick dinner to prepare for a last-minute meal. i only baked for 20 minutes and broiled for a few minutes. my husband and son loved it. will be making again.

WOW!!! What a fantastic recipe. I took other reviewers advice and sauteed 1 onion & 4 cloves garlic to add to the mix. I only had 1 jar of sauce but it still came out great. Next time though I will definitely use the 1 1/2 jars as recommended in the recipe. My husband and I LOVED this recipe. It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This was surprisingly very tasty.  I wasn't expecting much, and was very pleased to find it was quite good.  I would rate it more a 4.5 (a 5 really should by amazing), but I would definitely eat this again.  It is very easy to make and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  So much easier than lasagna and less messy to make.  A keeper for sure!

This was great, my husband said it tasted restaurant quality. I added some red pepper flakes, garlic powder and onion powder. I also only used 1 tablespoon of oil and added 1% to make up 1/4 of a cup. 
I made early in the day (while the kids were sleeping) and then just threw it in the oven. This would be great to make for someone who just had a baby or moved.

I variated very slightly on this - I used bow-tie pasta because my son loves them, I added oregano and basil - and I used the cheese I had, a mexican mix, very little mozzarella and parm.  I also just mixed everything together instead of layering.  The biggest change was that I added a palm full of slivered almonds.  I loved it.  I can't stop nibbling at it.  My son however was not duped and had just a few bites.  He's four though - and I am surprised when he eats one or two bites.  Loved this recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Great comfort food, and very easy to make, I think this is the first dish I have ever made that required absolutely no chopping. I added tons of garlic powder to the spinach while it was cooking which probably helped, but the casserole was still a little bit bland  in the end. It held together wonderfully though, probably because of the egg, which is a huge bonus, because my casseroles are always falling apart. Baked it for 30 minutes on higher because it was a weeknight and I had no patience; worked out very well and there was a lovely crispy cheese crust on the top. I'd make it again.

Yum!... this turned out perfectly!  I cut the recipe in half, added some italian seasoning and parmesan cheese, but kept everything else the same.  My boyfriend loved it along with his friend who is a vegetarian, so I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was really good with the cheddar cheese! I used fresh spinach, which I sauteed with olive oil, garlic, and a little salt and pepper.  I also grated a little Parmesan in with the pasta/spinach/egg/oil mix.  And I used penne pasta, only because I found it cheaper.  Yum!

Easy and soooo good! I literally threw everything into a pan and baked it. The hardest part was boiling the pasta!  I added some mushrooms, onion, and garlic to the sauce b/c I just used 2 cans of plain tomato sauce. I also added parmesan cheese in addition to the mozzarella and cheddar. Great recipe!

This was really tasty.  I did what the others said about the milk and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  It was SO tasty.

The flavor of this was kind of strange.  Maybe it was just my kitchen skills. I might make it again and add more spices.

Hmm... This lacked in flavor.  I even added feta cheese in the spinach mix to liven it up a bit. The top also got burnt on the sides a little bit... It made so much -- I don't know what to do with all of it!  Overall, this dish tasted okay.

EDIT: Tasted waaay better after a night in the fridge!  Lots of sauce makes a difference.

I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added garlic powder and dried basil to them to amp up the flavor.  I liked this but it made an enormous amount so next time I will try to halve it.

This is a great comfort food recipe.  I've put it together ahead of time and frozen it - it comes out fine.

This is a great way to get some green healthy stuff in a casserole. It is easy to make and very tasty. Reheats well too.

This was easy and tasted great. Even my picky son who hates pasta ate three servings of this last night. I did everything ahead of time and stuck the dish in the fridge until it was time to bake and serve. So good, no leftovers!

Decent.  I froze it, dethawed it, and cooked it, and it turned out ok.  Nothing too special, and mine was a bit watery, although that may be due to the freezing.  It tasked fine, and I did like how it didn't mix dairy and meat, so I could cook it for my Jewish roommate.

I've have made this a few times, each time to rave reviews.  Even my kids love it (and it's a good way to sneak some veggies into their diets).  I've always omitted the bread crumbs because my husband is on a gluten-free diet and they were not missed.  I will continue to make this again and again-fabulous!!

I made this dish after trying to find new ways to incorporate spinach in my dinner plans.  I used Italian bread crumbs and Ragu tomato, basil and cheese sauce.  Fairly quick to put together, very easy and delicious!  This will go into my "fix and freeze" recipies.

This one surprised me.  I thought the recipe looked kind of boring, but after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.  I added onion, garlic, basil, oregano & parsley to the sauce and it was really good!  This is a great, middle of the week, easy meal.
