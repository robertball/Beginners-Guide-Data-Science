I'm Korean...not only is this barely even Korean inspired, it's a bit weird to the Korean cook 3/4 cup of mayonnaise? Wow.  I'm not sure how I would change this to make this something you could call Korean, I guess substitute the Boston Lettuce with either red leaf or some other leaf lettuce (ask any Korean for Sang Chu with a long "a), don't use hot pepper sauce, use ggochujang - hot pepper paste...don't know where else to go with this.  The mayonnaise is just weird.
