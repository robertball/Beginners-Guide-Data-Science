I made this as a snack.  Quite yummy and filling! I forgot to dry them so it took about 55 minutes to cook.  Keep cooking them until they are crunchy.  The flavor improves a lot.

These are so good! They do crisp up a lot better if you put them between 2 paper towels and set a baking sheet on top to dry them out a bit...but even without that extra step they are delicious! I like adding a little bit of cayenne pepper to mine!

I thought these were very good and will make them again. Mine were a little dry, but I think I will just cut down the oven time and that should take care of it. I am looking forward to making them again

This is a great recipe but I had to add more salt for flavor.  I also added dill!

Not sure what I was expecting, but I could take this recipe or leave it.  I love garbanzo beans, so I thought I'd really like these.  Can't even really put my finger on what was wrong.  Just kind of bland and tasteless.  Guests did eat them, but there was a lot of teasing.

These are okay as a healthy snack, but a little bland.  I love Rosemary so I thought I'd love these...I only liked them.
