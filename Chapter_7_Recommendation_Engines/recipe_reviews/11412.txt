This were great! My boys and even my husband really liked them. Simple ingred. too. (: I used all creamy pb as I did not have any chunky. Also, tried to make traditional cookie shapes instead of the pan. Next time will follow the recipe, LOL, as the dough was sticky (not recipe's fault, totally mine!) Thanks for the post, Teri! Excellent cookie, great taste! And I love the name!

Husband and sons loved this; I thought it was just okay.  Ten stars for simplicity! If I make it again, I'll definitely top it with chocolate chips as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Too bad I didn't have any this time.

I can't bake to save my life, but Teri, your recipe is foolproof! I used all smooth peanut butter since I didn't have crunchy on hand, and made them into little cookie shapes like Normal~Jeans did. Thanks!

Super easy and very rich little cookie. These were so moist and crumbly though and aren't a sturdy cookie. I misread the sugar used brown instead of powdered. I only had creamy PB. These were simple to fix and took only a couple of minutes to have ready for the oven. I made them as individual cookies instead of a pan cookie. Not quite as good as a traditional flour based cookie, but good for what it is. Thanks Teri!

Excellent recipe!  I'm diabetic and substitute sucralose (or store brand) sweetner for the sugar and it still works good. Is just slightly crumblyier than sugar made but a good cookie high in protien and low in carbs for diabetics!  Found this recipie on the back of the walmart brand of sucralose!
One cookie I can eat without spiking my blood sugar!!!

Loved these!! I only had 1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter, so i added 1 large package sugar free chocolate pudding. And I had only regular sugar on hand.

These cookies were great.  My roommate is allergic to wheat so these are a fantastic gluten-free cookie.  Very easy.

I did not care for this recipe. The cookies took longer than ten minutes and were so dry they just fell apart before I could get them off the cookie sheet and the bottom of the cookies were hardly brown. I had high hopes for such a simple recipe but had no luck at all.

Used all crunchy PB, added a bit of vanilla. Didnâ€™t measure too carefully. Soft right out of the oven and held together better once cooled.

I read many reviews and I am glad that I still made it. It is great and thanks for the positive reviews with hints. Do not let them cool before removing them from the baking sheet. Make them small so the cookies can be made healthier snacks by combining them with milk and fruit.Thanks for this gluten-free option!

I didn't have enough peanut butter so I mixed it up with caramel... no one had any complaints :)
