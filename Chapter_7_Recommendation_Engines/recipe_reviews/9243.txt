FREEZE THE MIX INTO ICE CUBE TRAYS.  Spray the trays well with unflavored cooking spray (don't use butter flavored) and spoon in the mix.  When they are frozen solid, drop the "cubes" into a heavy duty zipper top bag and store in the freezer.  Eliminates the mess of scoops and drips, and adjust the number of cubes in your drink based on the size of your trays.  Dishwasher your trays in very hot water to remove the spray, or put them in the sink and poor boiling water over them.

This recipe is really good but I find that it is difficult to get people to try it at a party because the mix can get very hard to scoop when it has been frozen for a long time and people bypass it when they see that it takes three steps (scoop mix, add rum, add cider) because they think it's too much of a hassle.  I simplified the serving process by pre-scooping the mix into styrofoam cups and keeping them in the freezer.  That way guests could just grab a cup of mix from the freezer and add the rum and cider instead of wrestling with the ice cream scoop.  

Instead of using water, I used a mixture of 4 parts water and 1 part apple cider.  I think this is a great recipe for a party because people add their own alcohol so it helps non-drinkers blend in with the other guests and they don't have to advertise the fact they aren't drinking alcohol.  Kids also really liked it - they started calling it "Hogwarts's Butter Beer" after Harry Potter.

I took the suggestions of others & almost doubled the amount of butter & then decreased the amount of sugars by half. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves (about a tsp. each) It was really good w/ rum but it is outstanding in coffee.  I can't wait to try it in warm apple cider!

This was a big hit at this year's holiday party!  I just had to make sure to put enough of the mixture, and not too much hot water.  Dark rum is definitely better than light, as well.  Overall, fantastic!!

This recipe has been in our family for years also- it is always a hit!  I also add nutmeg and cinnamon to the mix as well as garnish with a sprinkle of nutmeg and a cinnamon stick.  Also, try with 1/2 Reg Rum and 1/2 Myers Dark Rum.  Really warms you up!!!!

This was excellent at my holiday party.  I used reviewers' suggestions and included 1 lb of butter and extra spices (ground cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice).  I do agree that less sugar would still be good and that this is excellent in hot chocolate for people who prefer not to drink alcohol (or for kids).  We used the ice cream scoop to serve, but it was still a little drippy and messy, so be prepared to clean your freezer after the party or put tinfoil down under the container first.

Way too sweet!  Cut the sugar in half, and it will be 5 stars.  I also used the suggestion of using Gourmet Ice Cream, and added cinnamon as well.  Sinfully delicious!!

Very lovely. Not heavy like an eggnog drink or even Bailey's, but still creamy tasting. Have never had a hot buttered rum before so I have nothing to compare it to. I am not a hard liquor drinker so I was worried about how rum would taste. I got a premium dark rum and was pleasantly surprised by the flavour of this warm treat. It's a very mellow tasting drink.I did as others have, using half the amount of sugar, and I halved the recipe. I also only used 1 TBSP of the rum. That's perhaps why I enjoyed the "mellow" flavour. The nutmeg sprinkle on top adds just a little touch of holiday flavour.

This recipe has made me a rum drinker!!  Although how can you miss with all that good stuff mixed with it...perfect for the holidays or any cold-weather gathering.  A word of caution - it is very filling!  Perhaps better to use as an after-dinner drink. ;-)  Excellent recipe!

This is by far the best Hot Buttered Rum mix I have ever had! I too, used 1 pound of butter. I like to add some of the nutmeg to the foam after mixing the drink together. It is delicious with vanilla rum as well. I added a shot of espresso too and it is like heaven in a cup! Enjoy!!

Really good base, but it needs a little spice to it.  I added coriander, cinnamon and touch of nutmeg to it.  I keep some of this in the freezer for cold Washington nights, or mornings, or afternoons, it's that good!

Wow! I made this a couple years ago for our annual revolving "Cousin Christmas Party" my stop was hot buttered rum and finger foods. Everybody loved it, and I packaged the rest up, as it does make a big batch, to take to other holiday get togethers as hostess gifts.  I used Schwans holiday vanilla ice cream, you know the one in the tin, I don't know if it made a difference, but.....wow!  We used Captian Morgan and/or Crown Royal for the kick, in hot water.

I gave this five stars becuz it is sooooooo good.  Made a very few changes - left out the powdered sugar and added a little spice (1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp cloves).  Used French Vanilla ice cream (not light) and Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum.  Wow!  It tasted just like warm eggnog, and that was with hot water, not adding any milk.  It was wonderful!  Thanks Kevin!

I serve this every christmas. I also double butter and use half the sugar. I put the frozen mix and water in a double boiler on my stovetop. It stays hot and then my guests ladle what they want into a cup and add spiced rum if they want. I also add cinnamon and nutmeg, and have fresh ground nutmeg for them to sprinkle on top

This is similar to the recipe I've used for thirty years. I use 1 pound of butter, 1 pound of each sugars and a quart of vanilla ice cream.  I always add nutmeg after it's mixed for added flavor. The kids like it just mixed in either hot milk or water so it works for all ages!

I made this recipe several years ago to bring to a New Years Eve party and everyone loved it, but I lost my recipe! I was so happy to find it here.  Made it again this year for Christmas and everyone loved it. You can also add this to a cup of hot coffee which is how I like it. Thanks for the recipe Kevin!

Very easy to make, but makes a *large* amount--I had a half-gallon container full of the mix when I was finished with the recipe.  It will have to be thrown out before it will be finished since you only use 2 heaping tablespoons of mix per cup.  Will definitely make again, but will scale down the amount.

This recipe is a great parting gift for a holiday dinner party. It can be made ahead of time and kept in the freezer until the end of the party and as your guests are leaving, you can hand them a Mason Jar with a nice ribbon around the lid and a computer generated label with directions on the front of the jar. It's also nice to serve the recipe at the dinner party so they get an idea of what it tastes like. I have done this twice so far, to rave reviews and endless thank you's!

I liked this as written.  I added spices to half of it and I wish I hadn't.  I think they are better added to each cup.  I can remember my parents drinking this when I was young, it's even better when you get to be the one drinking it!  I like the thought of making it with cider for the kids and non-drinkers.  Great recipe, thanks for posting it.

I found the recipes to sweet so I added the whole half gallon of ice cream and added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to my taste. My husband said it tastes like a dessert.

Good recipe just as is.  I cut the sugars in half and don't think it was as good as it would have been if I had followed the original recipe.  Possible could cut the powdered sugar but definately don't decrease the brown sugar!

My family loved the hot buttered rum mix.  The under 21 year-olds made the drink without rum and said it resembled a buttery-flavored Cream Steamer from Starbucks.  The recipe should also include a dash of salt.

I mixed up the butter and sugars together, and then I added it to the ice cream and froze it tightly in a container.  I had already tasted the mixture and I thought it was delicious.  I was very surprised when I added it to my coffee, both with and without the rum, and the flavor was very bland.  I added more of the mixture to make it sweeter, but I was really disappointed especially after reading all the great reviews.  Maybe I should have tried it in cocoa to increase the rich quality of the ice cream.  Sorry, but I won't make this again...

I thought this seemed a bit weird and tried the recipe a little reluctantly and only after reading the reviews.  My husband after he saw me pour the hot water over it commented that it was probably going to be gross.  Wow...we really liked this recipe, probably a little too much.  It is a wonderful adult cold weather beverage to relax with.  It is so convenient too since you make the mixture beforehand and it lasts for a little while in the freezer.  We love this.

With the other reviews and researching other recipes, I used 1 lb of (unsalted) butter. I also added 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg. Very nice addition. It's sure to become a family christmas tradition!! :)

This stuff is fantastic!  I also added 1 Tbsp cinnamon and extra butter, as suggested by others.  Kids thought it looked good and wanted to try it too so I mixed it up with hot cider for a non-alcoholic version.  Tasted like apple pie with ice cream!  Thanks for sharing it.

This is just fabulous and so easy.  I just make sure I keep a supply in my freezer.  My husband doesn't drink alcohol and he loves it without the rum.

I really liked this.  I made it exactly as written.  It was really sweet, but tasty.  I do think that next time I will follow the recommendation of the other reviews and use more butter and less sugar.  I think that would be better.   I had never had Hot Buttered Rum before and I think that this was a nice, delicious introduction to this holiday treat.

Yum!  I think the ice cream has to be melted, because when I added the ice cream to the butter/sugar mixture when it was just softened, it froze up the butter.  But just tried it with Captain Morgan and it's awesome!

This was our first try at Hot Buttered Rum. All I can say is WOW!! I may try increasing the butter to 1 lb like the other reviewers. I also used light rum because that is what I had on hand but will definetly get a bottle of dark rum before I make it again. It did make a large amount but it has kept really well in the freezer. This is a keeper in the recipe box.

Delicious! A hot buttered rum drink for people who think they don't like hot buttered rum! Half the recipe for a more manageable amount. I agree with others about adding butter. Spices are good either added in or sprinkled on top. As for it being too sweet, I disagree that the mix itself is too sweet, BUT would suggest just using 1T. of mix (instead of the recommended 2T) with a shot of rum. I'm about ready to go and get a second cup!

I took 2 sips and fell in love.  I took 2 more and got diabetes.  I thought I could handle it, but this recipe has way too much sugar.  If there is a next time, I would reduce the sugar by at least half.

Nice recipe.  Easy to make, but we had never had this before and so had little to compare it with.  The only other rum recipes I make are usually frozen concoctions.  The taste of the rum was a bit powerful when heated.  The frozen mixture used to flavor the hot drink was wonderful.  I think we'll try a better brand and grade of rum for the next batch!

This was good, but super sweet.  I'd maybe cut down on the sugar next time a bit.  Maybe by 1/2 cup?  Everyone loved it.  Some used Rum, and some did not but they all enjoyed it with or with out the spirits.  Thanks for the great recipe!  For something spicy, try the spiced hot buttered rum recipe on this site.  Yummie as well!

This was pretty good.  I used this recipe for rum and it was good, but there was too much of a brown sugar flavor.  I believe it needs more vanilla.  This was good put in warm milk too.  I will probably make this agan and experiment with it.

I think I added more than just a couple tbsp. to each cup to get just the right mix of batter, rum, and water.  I also doubled the butter and decreased the sugars like everyone said, and I'm glad I did.  I just made another double batch because the first disappeared so quickly.  SO good, and REALLY easy to make!!

Great recipe.  I used it at work for some of my regular customers and now it's a holiday special.  I use 3 sticks of butter though.  The dark rum is a great touch.  It adds a different flavor to a classic holiday drink.

Wow this was great!  Everyone loved it. I would recomend sharing though - it makes a LARGE batch, way too much for our gathering of 12. After reading other reviews I will try the 1 lb of butter instead of 1 cup - maybe it will blend better with the sugar and not be so lumpy.  Not for one on a diet!

Yum!  I made this using half the powdered sugar, but it was still great.  We sprinkled a little cinnamon on top which made for a pretty presentation.  We're going to bring it along to share on Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great...reduced both sugars(each by 1/3) and it was still sweet enough for me and guests. Used spiced rum and served it in cappucino cups - A keeper!

Cowabunga!  Wonderful!  Made it for a Christmas get-togheter at our barn and everyone loved it (and couldn't believe that I MADE IT! I'm not known to be very domestic!)  Took the advice of another reviewer and used Captain Morgan's spiced rum (though it's so good, any rum would do) and topped it off with whipped cream.  I did add some ginger, cloves, cinnimon--whatever was in the spice cupboard.  Yummy!!

Oh my stars!! 5 stars at that! When I was putting this together, I was cringing...all that sugar and butter! But when you put it all together with the rum and hot water - YUM!
Thank you for sharing this recipe, it will be a family tradition now! 
(I upped the rum to 3 Tablespoons - it's so sweet, we all thought the extra rum was needed. That and the fact that it was 6 degrees outside on Christmas night! ;-)

I’ve never had hot buttered rum drinks before, but it is perfect for cold winter nights.  Now I can’t go to bed without having one sweet cup before… I know it’s not good for my “figure”, but I can’t help it!  I like it really hot so instead of pouring boiling water, I just microwave it until it’s hot.  Thank you for sharing.

Awesome!!!  It IS sweet for sure.  But a couple of spoonfuls w/ some hot apple cider... mmmmmm.... I think several of my friends are now addicted to this!  I tried it w/ the rum (a tiny bit) and the boiling water and thought it was very watery.  My husband added rum to this w/ his hot apple cider and loved it.  It was pretty good in coffee too.  It makes a very good-sized batch -- enough to share w/ a friend...

I thought this recipe looked awesome, so I served it at Christmas to our family. Too be honest it was much too sweet and needed a little more rum. I could not drink a full cup of this or diabetes would have set in! So next time I will reduce the powerdered sugar by AT LEAST half if not more. I did put the frozen mixture in some hot unsweetened cocoa and it was great!

I love this drink mix.  I served it at a holiday party and everyone raved about it.  Most people requested the recipe from me.  It is easy to make and easy to serve.  You may want to double the recipe, because everyone asks for seconds (plus you'll want to keep some for yourself!)

Incredible. Liquid Christmas! But I like a bit of spice in mine. So I added: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1 tsp vanilla. I stored mine in Ziploc freezer bags so they didn't take up valuable freezer space this time of year. This is my signature holiday drink!

Yummy!  Really easy and really good.  My one substitution that I recommend is using brandy instead of rum.  Used rum for most of the batch but decided to change it up and really enjoyed it.

this made way too much, but other than that, it's a staple in our household.  nevermind that we live in hawaii where you never really drink hot drinks and that it's still summertime.  this is a nice treat that's easy to make and especially simple to pull out when unexpected guests drop by.  i admit that on an especially rough day (i am a new mom) i have made myself a small cup (with about 3 drops of rum) and sat on the couch in absolute bliss for 5 minutes.  ahhh.  be sure to half the recipe or even quarter it if you've never tried it before, otherwise you'll waste a whole lot of ingredients.

The only reason I'm giving this three stars is due the the tremendous amount of sugar called for in this recipe. Seriously, I only used a fraction of the sugar and it was plenty sweet and loved by all of our guests at our party. Like one other reviewer, I too used one part apple cider which also helped to sweeten things up. I do thank you Kevin for submitting a delicious recipe that can so easily be tweaked to suit your own taste.

I had never had hot buttered rum before, but this sounded so yummy I just had to try it!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added cinnamon and nutmeg to my mix along with the brown sugar--I think this is key to the flavor.  It really is delicious--it's worth going out to play in the cold just to come in and warm up with a mug of this stuff!! My kids love it in hot cider too.  A keeper.

Wow, that was so sweet!  But really good.  Made it for Thanksgiving and people had seconds.  Great holiday treat!  (Even good for dessert!)

Words cannot describe how warm and fulfilling this drink is.  My hot buttered rums were a huge hit at my Christmas Eve party, and I relished the leftovers for weeks afterward!  I also put the mixture into hot chocolate for my children, and my daughter even enjoyed it in her CoCo Wheats to cool them down and sweeten them at the same.   time. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

I made this for company and it was a hit.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and use more butter.  It was good!

Several years ago I bought a commercial brand from Alaska that was unbelievably good.  This is almost as good.  I think I may have put to much mix (2 HEAPING Tablespoons)into my cup.  It was VERY sweet.  I'm going to try it again with a little less mix.
