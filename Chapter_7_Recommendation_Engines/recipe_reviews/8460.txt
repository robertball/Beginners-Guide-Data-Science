I loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I substituted applesauce for the shortening to make it lower in fat.  I also used 1 teaspoon each of ginger and cinnamon.  I did not have any molasses so I used pure maple syrup. The end result was a moist and flavorful cake Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The cake came out light, fluffy, crumbly and delicious. I followed the recipe except for using 2 eggs instead of one and baking in a tube pan. My husband says it is the perfect cake.

I would not make this cake again even though it was very tasty.  The cake crumbled into pieces with every slice.
The recipes instuctions talks abouts "eggs", however there is only one egg in the recipe.  I wouldn't know how to bind this recipe to make it stay together once baked.

This is so light and yummy. I substituted golden syrup for the molasses, it has a much lighter taste.

We served this light gingerbread with applesauce and whipped cream.  Loved it!  Not too strong/spicy for the kids, nor too "Christmassy" for use in other seasons.  Thanks!

I have been trying to find the perfect gingerbread recipe, and this is it. I added a scant 1/8 tsp. cloves for a little more spice, but it would be fine w/out it. Also, I used regular molasses  because I didn't have light. Everyone loves  this gingerbread.

I had already made my gingerbread men for the season, but every year the rest of the carton of molasses sits in the pantry until it gets icky, so I went on a search for a recipe so the rest of my molasses wouldn't go to waste. I liked this recpie immediately because it was suitable for a bedtime snack for my children, and wasn't another super saccharine cookie recipe.

My 3 year old son and I worked on the recipe together, and we had such a blast! We used a 2nd egg, as another reviewer suggested so it was extra moist. It was so easy to make, and the whole time my son kept saying "Mm...this smells good!". Even with a 3 year old in tow, we were done in about 10 mins, and I wish I could bottle up the smell that wafted from my kitchen as it cooked!

The cake didn't rise much, but it was moist and very good...my son asked for seconds! I agree with the reviewer who said it needed more spice..I would have been happier with a little more zip with some added cinnamon in the recipe. I made a glaze with icing sugar, and a hint of vanilla to drizzle on top.

I will definetly tweak the recipe and try this again.

This was an absolute amazing recipe. It came out soft and rich. My advice, double the spices, and add one extra egg. This makes it have a better flavor, and the egg keeps it from crumbling. The smell of gingerbread filled the whole house. It was a great experience making this recipe.

Hubby doesn't eat sugar, so I replaced the brown sugar and molasses with 3/4 honey.  I also at least double the spices, because I like my food to bite back sometimes!  It came out a bit light in color since I didn't use molasses, but was a hit, even cold the next day rather than served warm.

This cake was super moist, but not very sweet at all.  And a little bland actually.  I think if I were to make this again, I would use an additional 1/4 cup of white sugar, and maybe a little more ground ginger. My husband thought it tasted like a weird steak marinade.  Not the reaction I was hoping for. :(

This was really good. Didn't have shortening on hand so I used margarine and had regular molasses. Turned out very good. I always add extra spices. We love it spicey. Thank you for the good recipe!!!!

I used 1 t ginger, 1 t cinnamon and 1/8 t cloves, 1/2 c melted butter. I reduced the molasses to 1/4 c and increased the brown sugar to 1/2 c. I made it as 12 muffins, baked at 180C for 25 minutes. Oh, and I put raisins in half the batter. Delicious!

This is the best gingerbread receipe i've found. The loaf is so light and fluffy it's delicious. The only difference is that I sprinkled sugar on top of the loaf before baking. I had to cook it much longer then specified.I could eat a whole loaf in 1 day it's that good.

I really liked this recipe the ratios worked perfectly and the texture and flavor are great. I did make it once using oil instead of vegetable shortening once only because I was being lazy and measuring out vegie oil was easier :-) and it still turned out fine. Slight difference in texture but still good and cake like. Not too sweet so you can certainly add a sweet frosting or glaze to this if you wish but a good not too sweet snack cake for the kids too. It also double well the ratios make it really easily done.

Tasted good, but I added an extra egg and it was still crumbly. Also not as rich as I'd have liked, but I did use milk instead of water.

The taste of the gingerbread was delicious and thoughts of falling leaves and the holidays occupied my head.  However, it was rather dry.

This receipe is so simple and delicious! I'm still very new at baking and the only thing I changed was doing 2 eggs, because I read some comments that it was a little dry. I made it in a small loaf pan and it is just amazing! Perfect Christmas treat :) Thank you!

I noticed the recipe calls for shortening, but the directions listed butter. I opted to use butter instead of shortening. Also, I only had an 8 X 8 Pyrex instead of a 9 inch round. The cake was moist and not too crumbly. I topped it was powdered sugar. I would cut back on the salt just a bit next time. It was noticeable to me, but not others.

This is a great recipe. I Served it with apple sauce and whipped cream. Big hit with the kids.
