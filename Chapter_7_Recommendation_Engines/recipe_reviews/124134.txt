This was my first attempt ever at canning and I'm so surprised it worked! The jam is very sweet, a bit tangy and a bit spicy. I left the peels on (how could anyone peel those things?) and they just sort of melted away in the boiling process and gave the jam a nice red color.  Also, I used a 3 oz. packet of the liquid Sure-Jell instead of the powder. I'm so proud of myself! Yeah me!

Works great, tastes great, looks beautiful! Next time I'll skip the peeling (my plums were small!) and skim out the peels during cooking.

Very good flavor regardless of my mistake.  I had so many plums I added equal amounts of plums to sugar and ended up with syrup instead of jam.  Great with waffles and pancakes. I've even substituted it for the 1/2 cup of white sugar in the Quaker oatmeal cookie recipe.  This is my most often requested "mistake" and although I plan on following the recipe to make jam this year, I will still make syrup.

I make lots of jam and sell it at our local farmers' market so I thought I would try this recipe. It turned out great, but I followed the conventional way to make jam which is; combine plums, water, lemon juice and PECTIN, bring to a full rolling boil THEN add sugar and spice bring back to a full rolling boil for 1 minute. I think that may be why some people had a hard time getting it to set. Looks beautiful in the jars and is quite yummy~I would up the cinnamon though.

Great recipe! However had problems getting jam to set so increased pectin to 1 1/2 pkgs and worked great after that. I also took the advice of one of the other reviews and did not peel and it worked out fine. I made one batch according to the recipe and another and doubled the cinnamon. My kids loved it! If one wanted to leave this as a sauce for ice cream it would be yummy!

I had overripe plums and didn't have pectin so I used 1 tsp. unflavored gelatin.  Some in the fridge and some in the freezer - delicious!

I've got an awful lot of experience with canning and I just could not get this to set up.  I was sure the others that couldn't get it to set were doing something wrong, but I didn't have any better luck.  I followed the recipe exactly so that's not the issue. I'm wondering if the type of plums makes a difference. The mixture did have a wonderful flavor so I'm sure I'll have great syrup if nothing else.  I'm thinking it will be great on home made vanilla ice cream.

I loved this recipie.  The cinnamon was subtle but gave the jam just a little bit extra flaver.  The only changes that I made was to the cooking order.  I followed the cooking directions that came with the pectin.  They have never let me down.  It set up great.  I will definatly add this one to my recipie box.

I am a cinnamon lover and was really excited about this recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly.  This jam would not set up.  I tried it 3 times.  I tried a different recipe and it set up w/i 24 hours.

This was my 1st attempt to make jam and I was surprised how easy it was. It was a huge hit with the family, even my son who will normanlly only eat grape jam loved it! If I can make it, anyone can! Give it a go.

First of all, this was my first time canning. The jam sounded appealing, so my husband and I made it with plums from my parents' tree. We doubled the whole recipe and tripled the amount of cinnamon, adding 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg as well. After reading one of the reviews (from the woman who makes jam to sell at farmers' markets) and the directions that came with the pectin, I first added the lemon juice and water to the fruit, then added pectin, brough that to a full rolling boil that can't be stirred down, then added the sugar and spices and brought back to a full rolling boil, and let it boil for one minute. We processed ours in a hot water bath for 20 minutes (10 minutes extra because we're at high altitude), and the jam set beautifully. We opened one, and it has a tangy, sweet, slightly spicy flavor, and a deep burgundy color. The doubled recipe made 14 12-ounce jars of jam; we're saving most of these for small Christmas gifts - the jam tastes like Christmas and would also be a good substitute for cranberry relish at Thanksgiving. :)

I love the idea of spiced jam, so I added some ground cloves and nutmeg as well.  Super yummy!  But even the cinnamon alone just makes this jam sing. :)  I did not peel my plums, so put them through the food processor so they were small-ish chunks and dropped the sugar to 6 cups since my plums were very ripe and sweet. Turned out fine that way.

this tastes AMAZING!! however, i couldn't give it 5 stars because it didn't set up properly with the given instructions. should've followed the tried and true instructions on the pectin...next time :) a quick tip for those who left their peels on, dunking the plums in boiling water for a few seconds followed by an ice bath will make those skins slide right off...the more ripe they are, the less time it takes in the boiling water.

I love this jam!  I made the first batch according to the instructions, but omitted the cinnamon.  It tastes delicious, but did not set up well.  I wanted it to be thick, so I did not add the 1/2 cup water in the second batch.  It turned out perfect!  I boiled my plums whole then fished out the seeds.  Leaving the skin gave it a beautiful red color.  I will be making this for many years to come. Thanks!

I canned two batches of this jam and now I have syrup, (lots of syrup). I should have cut back on the sugar, because it is very sweet.  Like one of the other reviewers, I am wondering if the problem was the type of plums I used.

This was really easy and delicious. I did not peel my plums to give it the fabulous red color. I skimmed off most of them, but left some in. It didn't seem to affect the taste or texture really. I also doubled the cinnamon and only used 4 cups of sugar. I got a little over 5 half-pint jars.

Delicious recipe and my jam came out nice and firm in about 24 hours. Like the reviewer from earlier however, I followed the traditional method of adding the sugar and cinnamon once the other ingredients came to a rolling boil first.  I also decreased the amount of sugar by one cup and it still came out very sweet.  But then again I doubled the cinnamon as well. Overall, this was my first attempt at jam and it came out as well as I could expect!

My plum tree is full so I have tried many recipes for plum jam.  This one is great - sweet and tangy.  Shared with my neighbours and they all loved it and went back for seconds.  It's a keeper

I gave this a 3 star because of the extra work to set the jam.  I found a good fix to set by my third time around.  For those of you who dont know how to fix here is the receipe.  For every 1 cup of product add 3 tbsp of sugar 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice 1 1/2 tps of liquid pectin.  In a large stainless steel pot whisk together and boil to a rolling boil let boil for a good minute remove from heat and re pack your jars. I have a ton of plums on the tree and was a good way to use them up. Good receipe but if you don't get jam to set its a lot of work to redo it.  I am dissappointed that because I had to rejar the plums really got boiled down too much, will know better for next years crop

I have a plum tree in my yard that produces small, red, very juicy plums.  After reading the reviews, I tweaked the recipe a bit, and came up with the best plum jam I have EVER made!  And it set up very well.  I dropped the sugar to 6 cups, bumped up the pectin to 1 1/2 boxes, and I made it according to the directions on the box, rather than the directions in this particular recipe.  I can't really taste the cinnamon, so I'll probably bump that up a little bit too.  It made exactly eight cups of jam.  I have been told by my fiance that I'm not allowed to give this jam away, so I'm making another batch today!

This recipe was easy and worked well.  This is my first time making jam, and it set no problem.  That might be because I listed to the other reviewers and put the pectin in with the water and lemon juice.    I peeled my plums, and my jam ended up pale and looks like apple jam.  I don't mind, but if you want the plum color, you might want to try leaving the peels on like some reviewers.  The flavor is good, too, but it's over-poweringly sweet.

Very good. Nice sweet-tart flavor. I followed the directions exactly, used Italian plums and it set up nicely within 24 hours. There was only a hint of the cinnamon flavor so next time I will double the cinnamon. It was fairly fast to make even though I was working with unpitted plums I had frozen last fall and brought directly from the freezer to the kitchen.

This was my first jam making experience and I'm very happy with the product.  It set quickly and was easy to make.   *I will make it with less sugar next time as its a little too sweet for my taste.

I got endless compliments for this jam. I used pluots rather than plums and cut the sugar down to 2 cups. I also used the no sugar needed fruit pectin. I cooked it slightly longer so as to let more of the liquid evaporate. I will be making more of this jam next year when our tree is producing fruit again!

This recipe is great. It's super easy and it turned out perfect. Also it was a big hit amongst my family members. I put the same amount of pectin as in the recipe and the jam set perfectly.

This recipe is great.  We made with prune plums from a tree in our yard.  We have tried with both skinned and unskinned.  We prefer the unskinned.  It gives it more color.  Very YUMMY!

We bought a house two years ago and when I cleared the brush in the backyard I found a plum tree. I set out to make whatever I could. As with some other reviewers, my jam would not set either. I followed the recipe exactly. So, I'm gonna try one more time. We will use this batch as syrup as others have suggested.

Tastes delicious! However for reasons unknown my jam didn't set. So it's Cinnamon Plum Syrup. I am unsure if it's because of my high altitude or what. I followed the recipe exactly so I am clueless. It makes wonderful syrup though!

I absolutely love this jam!  The only change I made was that I don't peel the plums.... I love the color the skin gives the finished product! If you don't like the more liquid texture just add a little more pectin.  This is a recipe that my husbands boss loves to have so we always make a little extra for his family!  A big hit with everyone that has tried it!

I followed the recipe exactly although cut everything in half. It didn't jell.  I think it's the plums I used - which were those very juicy red ones.  Damson might be better.

It turned out very delicious - love the flavor - but didn't gel properly.  I'll be giving it out to friends this Christmas labelled as "Cinnamon Plum Sauce."  It's good on waffles!

The first time I made this recipe, I peeled the plums and got a light colored jam.  The second time I didn't peel the plums.  The second batch was so much easier, and the jam had a nicer plum color. I followed the recipe and the jam has always set up fine.

Nice jam recipe! The cimple addition of cinnamon gave the plums another dimension of flavor, which was just what I was lloking for.

I love the taste of plum and cinnamon together!  It took me a while to prep, and I didn't have pectin in my pantry.  So I used potato starch instead.  It worked just as well.  This was a great easy, tasty recipe!
