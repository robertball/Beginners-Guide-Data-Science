This is a keeper. we really enjoyed it. It was delicious without additions to the top, but I added some sliced jalapenos and shredded cheese to the top of mine. My daughter added sour cream. I think next time we may add black olives to the top. Very versatile, easy to make, and enjoyable for the whole family.

I made a double batch of this in my 6 qt Instant pot which ended up being too full so it couldn’t come to pressure.  I just let it “cook and kept stirring it until the rice was done.  It was awesome and I will definitely make another (single) batch again!!
