thought that the suggested amount of rosemary used was too much.  Gave it too powerful a taste. Don't think I will try this recipe again.

The rosemary was overpowering and I put in half what the recipe said. The lemon was way to overpowering. Might be better if the lemon was deleted or cut way down, but it's not worth it. Definately will not make this again.

To tell you the truth, we didn't think this recipe was as good as the other reviews led us to believe. The lemon juice seemed to completely overpower the delicate taste of the zucchini. Maybe decreasing the lemon juice? Can't say we would make again. Sorry, Light & Tasty, we still love your magazine!

Wonderful recipe for zucchini and a great way to use the fresh rosemary that I grow. Served it for dinner guests and they raved and asked for recipe and now make it as well.

Tasty , but the rosemary really overpowered the zucchini. I would make this again but reduce the amount of rosemary.

I bought a bunch of zucchini on sale, and didn't know what to do with it!  Thanks for this recipe.  Even my picky husband likes it!  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for 3 picky men- and they all raved about it- of their own accord!!!!  It's so easy, and you can even make extra butter and stick it in the fridge for later.

I liked the rosemary butter, however I did substitute fresh parsley for half the rosemary.  The leftover butter is also good on potatoes.

I thought this was wonderful.  I took some reviewers comments into consideration and used only 1 tbsp. of rosemary and I didn't think any particular flavor was overwhelming.  It was just plain GOOD!  I didn't put the butter on too heavily and I have a good bit of it left over and want to try it on some other vegetables, particularly corn.
