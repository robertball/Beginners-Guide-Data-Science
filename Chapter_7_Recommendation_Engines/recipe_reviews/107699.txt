Months ago, my boyfriend commented how a mango pie would probably be really good.  So, for his birthday, I made him this recipe. It was a good pie, but I'm giving it four stars only because it was just what we expected.  It was a pie just like your average apple or peach pie that happened to taste like Mangoes.  It was good and everyone enjoyed it, but it's nothing exotic.  I would definitely make it again though because 1) it was tastey and 2) the crowd really loved it because they'd never had a mango pie.  The green mangoes were really easy to fine ($1.09 a piece in California) and 8 of them filled it way up, which is what I like.  I made homemade crust because I think it's better and cut a petal design on the top.  Great with vanilla ice cream!  Oh, make sure to put a cookie sheet under this one- juices spilled all over my oven!

I was excited to see a recipe for green mangos.  We have a beautiful mango tree, and welcome recipes to use the fruit in unique ways.  The pie was great.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the use of the nutmeg in the recipe.  I love nutmeg, but it certainly overpowered the the mango flavor.  Perhaps 1/4 TSP of the nutmeg might have been better.  Or another spice and/or flavor.

Absolutely love mango pie!  Reminds me of Hawaii - boy do I miss having a mango tree.  Since it's hard to find green mangoes now, I use ripe but firm mangoes for this recipe.  Usually 4 large mangoes is plenty.  I also substitute cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Hot out of the oven with a dollop of vanilla ice cream is the ultimate!

OMG! This has become my favorite pie!  I used frozen mango chunks, let them thaw in a colander, then tossed them with the rest of the ingredients (I find the filling bakes up better this way rather than layering). I also used only a pinch of nutmeg, and a bit less sugar (and I adjusted for a 10-inch deep dish). 

 So easy and soo tasty! I thought baking the mangos might turn them to mush, but no - they held their texture wonderfully.  Gotta go have a piece right now!

Absolutely loved this recipe! My husbano wants me to make this for two of our friends. I had a mix of ripe and green mangoes so I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I also made the pie crust from scratch.

I used one package of frozen mango and one package of frozen peaches. I tossed the fruit with lemon juice added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon in addition to the nutmeg. 

Also made it a little sweeter by adding a tad more sugar as well. Taste was close to that of a peach cobbler. Very yummy.
