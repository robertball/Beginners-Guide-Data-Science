This recipe yielded 40 potato candies, each was about 2 bites. 

Chilling in between steps is the key! Chill them for about 30 minutes after you mix in the coconut, then chill them another 30 minutes after shaping them, chill them about 20 minutes after rolling them in cinnamon.

I used 1/2 tbsp of cocoa with every 1 tbsp cinnamon for the coating. After letting it set for about 20 minutes, I brushed the excess off with a basting brush.. I HIGHLY reccomend doing that, otherwise the coating is overwhelming.
If you're not a cinnamon lover, I would suggest rolling them in just cocoa, I think I am going to try that next time.
As is, the cinnamon taste is WAY to strong, for kids, I would definitely try the cocoa route.

We have grown up enjoying these sinful good candies and find this recipe able to produce "Irish P's" as good as those made by a local candy company known for these "Patty's Day" treats.  I used some butter to grease the palms of my hands for rolling and I place the mixture back in the fridge for a few minutes once it starts to get too sticky to roll cleanly.  We like the sharp contrast of the pure cinnamon coating with the creamy sweetness of the candy. A little powdered sugar mixed in with the cinnamon will reduce that sharpness, for those that don't. Prior reviews that have noted a "too buttery" taste must not have creamed the butter and cream cheese thoroughly.  I cream the two of them together in one of my large stainless mixing bowls using using the back of a large 13.5" stock spoon until the color is uniform. I also combine the vanilla using this method.  An electric mixer is almost a required item to combine the powdered sugar, unless you are really up for a work out with you wire whip! Enjoy

These are so cute!  I surrounded a plate of Irish Soda Bread with them.  I had to explain what they were, since they do look a little odd, but once the group knew what they were they dove right in until they were gone.  The taste is different and good, and they are a great touch for St. Patrick's Day.  I would recommend chilling the mixture for about five minutes before forming the potatoes, then chilling them again for a few minutes before rolling them in the cinnamon.  They keep their irregular potato shape better that way.

This recipe is great! It's just as good as the one's you can buy at See's candy. I did what See's did, though, and instead of just cinnamon, I mixed cinnamon with cocoa powder. Perfect!

This recipe is very easy to make. I like to toast the coconut - it makes the candy much more flavorful. For a cute gift - make small burlap sacks and line with wax paper, fill the sack with the potato candy and tie the top with twine.  I gave these to my Irish relatives for Christmas and they loved them!

My husband was having a St. Pats potluck at work and I was looking for something "Irish" and "different" to send.  I stumbled across this recipe and decided it looked easy, fast and good so I tried it.  I just finished emailing him the recipe - there were a lot of requests for it!  I added 1/2 Tablespoon of cocoa to the cinnamon and they were DELICIOUS!!!  I will DEFINATELY be making these again!!

This was a big hit in my holiday candy tins. Be sure to allow time for them to dry out a little so they won't be so squishy. Also, next time I'm going to roll them in cinnamon and a little sugar instead of just cinnamon. The cinnamon alone is slightly bitter when you first pop it into your mouth.

Very good.  I let cream cheese mixture chill in fridge over night before rolling in hands to form individual candies. Came out great. Cute presentation for St. Patty's Day!

My son's class were supposed to be farmers, so I put a bunch of these in a little crate, with a sign saying "Potatoes for Sale". They were a big hit.

This is pretty good. Pretty good indeed. How can you go wrong with cream cheese, butter, and cinnamon? You can't! The only thing I would change in the recipe is I would throw the coconut in a food processor and give it a whirl to make the mouth feel a little less.. stringy. And instead of 'rolling' it in the cinnamon, I dunked them in a plastic sandwich bag to coat. Easy peasy!

This is a great recipe.  After reading the review I made some of the alterations suggested and they turned out perfect.  I used 3 cups instead of 4 cups of powdered sugar and did the cocoa powder/cinnamon combo just to take a bit of the bitterness off the cinnamon.  Electric beaters to mix are a must and keeping the mix chilled makes all the difference.  Also, spraying your hands with Pam helps it not to stick too.  I made these for our Bunco group and it was a huge hit.  One of the ladies actually owns a bakery and she asked for the recipe and a few days later was selling it in her shop!  That says it all!  :)

I have been making this fun candy for 50 years. I use potatoes instead of the cream cheese and add almond flavoring and Irish Whiskey. I also make eyes for the "potatoes" with small slivers of almonds.Wish I could post a picture but am computer challenged.

Adorable.  Made these for the pastry buffet at the casino I work for; St. Pat's Day menu.  For our tasting I toasted the coconut and added 2T. Bushmills Irish whisky plus chopped toasted pistachios...added depth of flavor and cut the sweetness a bit.  Added powdered sugar and cocoa powder to the cinnamon coating to cut the bitterness.

tried & everyone loved it! i have a stand mixer so was super simple for me to make a double batch. i did as many reviews suggested & mixed to the 1 Tbsp cinnamon a half Tbsp cocoa & 2 tsp powdered sugar.i also did the chilling in btwn steps i mixed, then chilled for 60 min (because double batch)then formed with latex gloves on (made this step a breeze) then chilled again & coated by shaking 5 at a time in a gallon ziplock, chilled again, brushed off excess coating (i feel this is a must, otherwise the coating will choke you!! lol!!!)then stored in frig. soooo cute, they look just like little potatoes!!

These were delicious. I rolled mine in cinnamon sugar instead of just cinnamon as I was afraid pure cinnamon might be too much. Very rich and creamy and, most importantly, a breeze to make.

These are totally easy and worht the time. I've made them for years and whether I take them  to work or church, eveyone eats them till they're gone. NO changes needed. And chocolate doesn't belong in Irish potatoes.

Hint for success with this recipe! Use a beater to combine the mixture of butter, cream cheese and vanilla., but try working the sugar into this mixture with a heavy spoon, pressing down to combine the ingredients and mixing until pretty well distributed.  Then add the coconut and work it by hand.  The heat from your hands softens the mixture enough to combine softly and makes rolling the candy easy.  I made two batches rolled in cinnamon to serve St. Patty's Day at our Red Cross Blood Drive!  Treat for the donors.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made these last night, and they turned out wonderful, just like the wonderful irish potatoes my neighbor used to make when I was a child. My family loved them too, especially my son, he keeps going back for more. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problem with consistency or rolling them. The only problem is they're addiciting, I couldn't stop eating them!  Will definately make again.

I grew up in Philly and looked forward to eating these every year! This receipe is the closest I've found to the original Oh Ryan's Irish potatoes. Absolutely delicious!  And it's supposed to be sweet, however...those that say it's too sweet and those who get less than 60 "potatoes" out of this recipe are making them too big. They should be the size of extra-large marbles. This way, the taste of the sweet filling and the cinnamon coating is balanced and tastes perfectly blended when you eat it. 
Also...the ingredient list isn't very clear about the amt of cream cheese.  You should use 4 oz. of cream cheese, which is half of a packet. And yes, the full 4 cups of POWDERED sugar is needed so it's not too sticky. I greased my hands w/ a tiny bit of butter about 3 times total while rolling balls. If you roll them using your palms instead of your fingers, it won't stick as much. I got about 67 potatoes, but I made them smaller than usual. Thank you for posting this delicious reminisance of my childhood!

These are yummy, but much better if you roll them in cocoa powder instead.  If you use the cocoa powder and stick an almond in the middle, they taste like Almond Joys.

I've made A LOT of Irish Potatoes in my day, and I have to tell you these turned out the best!! Recipe was simple enough to follow!! A co-worker said she tried this recipe and hers came out to soft, but she also did make them ENORMOUS and tends to use "low fat" butters and cream cheeses(which I learned the hard way makes for runny potatoes. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

In my opinion before wasting valuable time and resources, I made the mistake of following the above directions only to come out with a gooey mess. Here's the deal people, you must chill the mix at least 30 mins. before attempting to roll these guys in cinnamon if you don't there will be more cinnamon inside than outside. Just my two cents here but I strongly advise doing it this way because I made that mistake already.

Pretty good recipe, but, 4 cups 10x sugar was way too sweet.  Threw away  the first batch and only used 2 cups 10x sugar second time around.  A little softer consistency, but after chilling in the fridge it was easy to roll into balls.  Tasted much better with less sugar!!

These are absolutely adorable!  Think that one time I may try a drop of orange food coloring in the dough and make them little "sweet potatos".  They were very easy and very good, but I was suprised at how much time it took to roll them out and coat them in cinnamon.  Took me almost an hour.  But it was worth it they are so cute.  Thanks for sharing.

Recipe is poorly worded in regards to how much cream cheese to use so I wound up adding too much then doubling the rest of the ingredients.  Not sure if I got the consistency exactly right in the end, but they were VERY good anyway and I will be making it again.  Also, I added sugar to the cinnamon coating.

i actually halved the confectioner's sugar and they were a perfect consistency (just barely sticky, but it helped the cinnamon to stay on!).  i think they would have been WAY too sweet with the total 4 cups of the c-sugar.  i took them to our neighbor's for a corn beef & cabbage party for St. Patty's day...to my surprise they were devoured!  i drew a cute little sign to stick out of the bowl they were in saying they were Irish "potatoes."  it really drew in the crowd--cracked me up to see people's reaction to the strange-looking "candy." hehe!  many people asked for the recipe--they were definitely a hit :)

I grew up on irish potatoes around March and was so glad to finally tasted like the same thing I ate as akid. Its a simple recipe but I have tried others but they're not nearly as delicious. This is a must during st.pattys day even if you're not irish.

I used an enormous bowl to catch overflow, made recipe with an extra teaspoon of butter.After mixing, put into 2 sandwich bags,put in fridge for over an hour, and then used 3/4 teaspoon to portion and roll them into another sandwich bag filled with cinnamon to shake/coat them. quick and easy that way,the kids had a ball making them, without a huge mess.

So this is pretty much a heavy butter cream frosting with coconut. It's pretty dang yummy as is. I only gave the recipe 4 stars, because it requires a LOT of chilling in-between stages in order to keep the dough workable and not a pile of goo, so the prep time/ready time isn't even close. I mixed a little powdered sugar (1/2 tsp per tablespoon) with the cinnamon to keep it less bitter for the kids. Next time, I may reduce the powdered sugar to see if it tastes a little less like frosting and more like cheesecake. I've also considered adding a box of sugar free pudding mix to it for flavor. I'll let you know how it goes! Thanks for the good starter recipe!

After mixing all the ingredients together, I chilled for about 30 min to harden it up and not be so sticky. The cinnamon coating went on well. Be sure not to make them too big. Irregular shape, two bite size is perfect. Keep refrigerated.

I made these for an Irish-themed birthday party, and they were definitely one of the highlights. It took me a while to figure out that the reason they were disappearing so quickly was because my husband kept sneaking some when I wasn't looking! I only used about 3/4 of the confectioner's sugar called for, and got delicious cheesecake-like candies as a result. Thanks, Saundra!

Got a 3 stars because of all the compliments they (I !) received while I would have given only 2 little stars : FAR too sweet for my taste !
I did use only 3 cups of sugar though, which is already plenty to make 50 "potatoes". No problem for making the balls after puting the dough for only 20 minutes in the fridge, but then I preferred presenting the potatoes in little paper cups as they had to travel on the next day. It all turned perfect this way. I agree with some comments about the flaked coconut being too "stringy", if a next time I'll use smaller flakes. I also followed the advices of the mixed cinnamon and cocoa. My own tips : if you are not completely sugar addicted, the dark cocoa coat is a must do, and don't spare on the spices you'd add to it. I also added 2 or 3 spoons of whisky in the cream-sugar dough, as when you decide to go Irish let's REALLY go ! May be this helped my friends to give their high rate....

Family and I thought they were great. Took the advice of chilling in between steps and adding cocoa. After I formed them I held each one and lightly sprinkled cinnamon/cocao mixture on them, then rolled them again in hand to give even coat. Next time I might put an almond in each one to cut the sweetness.

OK...so I almost gave it 4 stars because it is not easy to use and handle.  My 10 year old little girl needed something for "culture" day at school...we chose this.  Best advice? Put in freezer or fridge between each step! I read that and was so glad I did! Also...I mixed together cinnamon, cocoa, and powdered sugar for the end step.  I tried to throw them in a ziplock bag and shake like someone suggested but they came out looking like poo.  I spread them out on a large cookie sheet and "sprinkled" the mix all over them...turning them a few times.  THEN they looked more like potatoes instead of poo. I HAD to keep them cold...or they became a mushy mess.  By mid-day...even in a cooler with an ice block...they were all mushed together.  What was left at the end of the day...my family and I dug in with spoons!  ;-)  Tastes great...just hard to handle.

I made these for St. Patrick's day, my husband loved them. He loves coconut and these were so easy because you dont have to cook them. I did add cocoa powder with powdered sugar and cinnamon for the coating and it really gave them a realistic potato look.

This recipe was what I was looking for! I've made these candies since I was in the second grade and now being a grown adult I had misplaced it during a move, so I searched on other websites and including this one and found that this recipe came the closest to what I lost. I added a little more coconut. Also for those of you that say it's too messy or sticky to roll...well it is! And that's how it's supposed to be. Just use your palms, roll quickly and then plop about three or four in a bowl of cinnamon and swirl them around until coated. Then use your clean fingers to pick them up and put them on a try to be refrigerated. And I also needed a lot more cinnamon than what was recommended. Enjoy!

I made it just fine, everything had the right consistency and there were not issues with process, but no one, and I mean no one liked them.  I ended up throwing out the whole batch because the people who tried them didn't go beyond their first bite.  Yuck!

Very Tasty! The potatoes are much easier to work with if you let the mixture chill in the fridge until it's cold and then assemble them. I also found that using just ground cinnamon did not work well for rolling. Instead, I used a cinnamon/sugar mixture; this worked perfectly and tasted much better.

Interesting and yummy, but very rich! I made them for St. Pat's Day and they tasted similarly to an Almond Joy but richer because of the cream cheese.  I took some reviewer's advice to use cocoa powder and cinnamon for the outer layer and I am very thankful that I did -- otherwise, the cinnamon would have been way to over-powering for my taste. I will probably make these again next year, but will definitely halve the batch since you can only eat a few bites of these rich little suckers.

These Irish potatoes were so delicious! I did have to chill the batter prior to rolling them into balls or they would have been sticky, messy, balls of mush. I will defiantly make these again. This batch goes to school w/ my daughter on Friday for a St. patty's day treat.

Just made these with the kids. Here's what I want to remember for last time. Every few minutes I had to stop and put the mix back into the fridge to firm up a bit before I could continue forming the balls. I think with these mods it will be a 5 star.

It is too sweet (which is something I very rarely say). I will cut the sugar down to 3 cups - 2 and 1/2 cups into the mix and save about 1/2 cup to mix with the cinnamon to help cut it.

My tip is to add a pinch of sugar in the cinnamon. Also to mixed the cinnamon and sugar then in a seperate bowl (small) I put a pinch of the cinnamon & sugar then put the a ball into it and tossed it around, this seemed to coat them the best.

These are very sweet and rich and yummy. We preferred them without the
cinnamon, rolled into small balls. They would probably be great dipped in melted
chocolate. I served them after dinner to our guests on St. Paddy's Day with
homemade Irish Cream. We wouldn't eat them very often because of all the
sugar and fat, but they make a great special treat.

Everybody who tried these loved them!! Really easy recipe to put together. I rolled the "potatoes"in pure cacao powder in place of cinnamon because I was out. Instead of rolling out balls using my hands I used a mini ice cream scoop, dropping them into the cacao powder. I had no problems with the mix at all, didn't even chill it.

This recipe is great and I use it all the time! Sometimes I add a little fresh nutmeg in the cinnamon or not. And most times I split mixture in half and make adult version by adding a little coconut rum! My favorite

I love cinnamon and coconut so I really thought that id enjoy it but I just wasn't worth the calories. 

I enjoy indulging in a sinful snack but it has to be worth it

You can also roll out the dough and spread peanut butter on it and roll it up and cut about quarter inch slices to make small pinwheels.  It's delicious!

Little sugar balls, the cinnamon makes them.  I tried with cocoa on the outside and still good but not as striking for sure.  I also made some with the cocoa and mint extract, but the mint flavor wasn't strong enough, maybe next time I'll just mince the mint and make "potatoes with chives" candies!

This is a great recipe, very easy and looks just like little potatoes, so cute. I took advice from the reviewer who said to chill between steps. That worked really well. I got about 48-50 (someone kept stealing them before I could count) I mixed icing sugar with the cinnamon before rolling them. These are great. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these yesterday for St.Patrick's Day and they are so good!  I would definitely recommend this recipe.  I used reg salted butter and reg cream cheese (not low fat) for the recipe.  Very easy to make.  I did not roll the "potatoes" in cinnamon after they were chilled.  There was plenty on there and I have heard from others that the cinnamon can be overpowering if too much is put on.

This was always a favorite in Philadelphia on St. Patty's day.  I had no idea that it was so well known outside of that area.  I make them every year, but only in the last few years have I added the cream cheese.  Before that I was quite happy without it, but I like it with too.  After chilling (and I have already left them in the refrigerator overnight), I have always simply shaken them in a bag containing cinnamon.  I will have to try including cocoa with the cinnamon this year.

Very fun and easy to make. I am not a huge fan of cinnamon so I did do half Cinn. and half cocoa. My husband just loved them. I do have to say they are so cute.

I think these are the absolute best Irish Potatoes I've ever had!  And soooo much better than prepackaged O'Ryans.  I did have to leave out the coconut (son is allergic) and even though it's one of the main ingredients, these were incredible!  If I wasn't on Weight Watchers right now, the whole batch would be gone.  Refrigerating the mix for a bit before rolling into balls is key to saving you lots of frustration -- it would just be a gooey mess otherwise.

These taste exactly like I remember the ones from Utche's Candy in Medford Lakes New Jersey tasted growing up.  My mother would always buy us a small boy on St. Patrick's Day.  They are very, very sweet, but so are all of the Irish Lasses!!

Adorable treat for  St. Patrick's Day dinner.  I skipped the coconut and added peanut butter, just out of personal preference,  I think they would have been great with coconut too.  Since I used peanut butter I rolled them in cocoa and confectioners' sugar in place of the cinnamon.

These have a great flavor, but there are a few things I changed. First, don't roll them in just cinnimon, as others have wisely suggested. Instead, I rolled them in finely crushed graham crackers and they tasted GREAT!  Also, since I didn't have the patience to roll them into mini potatoes (way too time consuming), I simply made truffles. They still looked cute and were super yummy!

There is way too much sugar in this recipe, so I had to throw out the entire thing. Probably 1/2 the recommended sugar would suffice.

It seems to have just been me, but the 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 8 oz cream cheese wasn't NEARLY enough for the 4 cups of 10x sugar! I had to use a 1/2 cup of butter and a whole 8 oz package of cream cheese to get anywhere near a batter-like consistency instead of just lumpy powder. After I figured that out it tasted great! Maybe a little too sweet for some. I might relax on some of the 10x sugar on the next batch. I too chilled the batter in the fridge overnight before rolling them in cinnamon and cocoa. I'm sending them to school with my daughter. I'm sure they'll be a hit.

My mom has made these for years. I decided to make them myself this year and these came out great! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added some confectioners sugar to the cinnamon. I also let the mixture sit in the fridge over night TIGHTLY covered and it was not sticky AT ALL! The kids love them!

I feed a about 80 Veitnam Veterans and their significant others Saturday night.  Besides the corn beef/cabbage this was the hit.  Was quite comical because they all were expecting your tradional potato candy with peanut butter.  They were pleasantly surprised.  Very easy recipe would be great for a kid just starting in the kitchen.  Taste is wonderful!!!*****

Excellent Treat!  I also made these to "garnish" irish soda bread at a work function.  They were so sweet & so delicious - just like the ones I used to have straight from the candymaker in  NYC.  Make sure you use an electric mixer to mix the beginning ingrediants.  Using a utensil for the coconut flakes is fine.  Also I had to put the dough back in the fridge every so often to firm up.  I also threw in a dash of confectioners sugar with the cinnamon.

My daughter loves to cook, and I like the idea of "No Bake" recipes for her.  She enjoyed making this and got rave reviews from her two brothers and my husband and me!  Of course, the guys thought it cool how they looked like real potatoes!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious.  They are not too buttery at all just very sweet.  I bought them into work and they were a hit.  I found if you spray your hands with Pam they are easier to roll.

Mine came out perfect! I hand mixed everything (which is a little time consuming) and mine didn't turn out sticky at all. I mostly sprinkled the cinnamon and didn't completely cover them, which didn't really make the cinnamon overwhelming, it's just right. My roommate's father is Irish (he is the first generation born in America) and he used to eat these as a kid with his dad, who recently passed away. I made these specially for him, and he was so excited and said they came out great! Follow the recipe exactly, and maybe adjust the amount of cinnamon you can handle/prefer, and they come out awesome! I will be sharing this recipe with friends :)

I thought these were delicious. Taste better than the ones you buy at the store. I see some users said they were to sweet, but what do you expect when you are using mostly powdered sugar!? 

TIP
If you add more coconut they stiffen more so you can roll them better, no need to add extra powdered sugar.

This is a fun & tasty recipe that my family enjoyed making & eating.  I am only giving it four stars because I had to make some changes to get the family friendly results.  I toasted my coconuts & used about a 1:4 ratio of cinnamon to unsweetened cocoa powder.  The cocoa makes them look more like a potato. I also did a lot of chilling in between. Thanks for the tip of watering my hands to roll the "potatoes".  We will definitely make these again!

Reading the reviews and seeing the chilling notes definitely helped making this recipe. I would've quit otherwise. I did use the ground cinnamon but will try with cocoa next time just try something different. Thanks for sharing.

These are great! I make these every year and decided to try a new recipe! My "dough" came out thick so i didn't need to refrigerate before rolling in the cinnamon. I also have a question, if i keep them out of the fridge will they go bad? Because i like mine soft where as when you put them in the fridge they get all hard unless you let them sit out.

Wow,this stuff is rich! Very sweet. I had so much fun making it. I read many reviews before I did and I decided after taste testing a bit that rolling them in cinnamon,cocoa,and powdered sugar was best. It was quite sticky until I popped it in the fridge,much easier to handle after that! I am definitely making this again in the next couple of weeks and handing them out for St. Patrick's Day :)

These are so cool! They were a breeze to make, and I even made them vegan, using vegan "Cream Cheeze" and vegan "butter" sticks. Since my Kitchen-Aid mixer was otherwise occupied, I mixed the ingredients together by hand, wearing gloves, and that added to the fun of making these treats. They are just SO cute!

They are REALLY rich and sweet, so you only need one, ha ha. They were a big hit at my small family St. Patrick's Day Dinner, and I'll be making them every year, I think. Wish I had taken photos to add to the others, but mine looked just as good as all of the other submissions.

No matter how you roll 'em or cover 'em, these little spuds are yummy--as long as you don't have a problem with the texture of coconut!  And the cinnamon is a wonderful flavor that makes the candy--not too strong at all. If you don't like cinnamon, however, the cocoa tastes good, too.  Next time I make them I will be surer to use the full amount of coconut and perhaps add chopped nuts.

These were great and so easy. I don't think they taste at all like See's, but they're wonderful in their own way. Like a little ball of frosting with coconut wrapped in cinnamon. I thought the cinnamon might overwhelm me, but it didn't at all. Delish! (And I agree to refrigerate between steps - so much easier.)

The taste is great! But the consistency is all WRONG. Even if you refrigerate you cant get it into a ball because its so mushy. Even if you keep letting it harden in the fridge over night. Never works as good as the stores are.   I have seen other recipes for this using Marzipan as an ingredient and I think that is probably more accurate.   But like I said it tastes delicous but you will be eating it with a spoon LOL

These were delicious! The center tastes just like bounty bars. I needed to use quite a lot more icing sugar than the recipe states and the final product was very rich. Next time I'm going to try these a little smaller and dip them in chocolate instead of rolling in cinnamon. Yum!

This recipe was very messy and did not turn out well.  The cream cheese sweet coconut mixture (which was very good) did not ball up or form into a potato looking candy.  I used this cream cheese mixture in a crescent roll instead with cherry topping.  This recipe was very sticky and in the end did not look like a potato.

Very cute!  The taste is very basic so it will appeal to most people. We did have to add some more oil to the mix to reach a good molding consistency.  Since the mix is white, we molded small snowmen and used it as a Christmas cookie.  It is very versatile, so you could also color the mix and make Easter Eggs or hearts etc.

These are so cute! They really look like potatoes, even after you bite into them the inside looks like a potato too LOL! These were super easy to make with my stand mixture, even with very cold butter. These are gluten free too, provided you make sure the coconut and the icing sugar is a reliable brand. I ran out of coconut, so I pounded some almonds into a chunky powder and it seemed to work well too, nice crunchy bits added to the "potato" nature without compromising taste. Great recipe! Will definately make again, I plan to use these as stocking stuffers this year.

I made these last night and took them to work for a potluck. Everyone that tried them loved them. I cut back on the confectioners sugar by about a 1/2 cup, though. I also mixed in some cocoa power and confectioners sugar with the cinnamon. Chilling the mixture before rolling and then chilling again prior to coating them seemed to help a lot. I tapped each candy on the edge of a bowl to get the excess cinnamon mixture off so that it wasn't too overpowering.

I never made these before, but always loved them from the store. This recipe was simple and turned out great. They are delicious. My boyfriend's review: "Yum! Just like the nuns used to make". Yes, that was a compliment! I used a good deal more cinnamon, but other than that, no changes to this recipe.

These were adorable! And they tasted great too! I did let them sit in the fridge overnight before forming into potatoes & I rolled them in a cinnamon/sugar/cocoa combo. I gave away gift plates of Irish Cream brownies w/ little decanters of homemade Irish Cream & used these as a garnish on the plates. I'll make them year after year although next year I may try them w/ potatoes subbed for the cream cheese as suggested by Reen. Thansk for the recipe!

Very good and interesting.  I would add a little sugar to the cinnamon too as someone else said.  I also had to use a lot more cinnamon than the recipe called for but it wasn't a big deal.

These are outstanding with or without the coconut!  I had the misfortune of losing 
this recipe and I had no idea that I would find it in allrecipes!  A lady at my church 
use to make these and she called them Sweet Potato Sticks.  She made them minus 
the coconut.  Thank goodness for the ingredient search...that is how I was able to 
make them again!  They have to be chilled well and make an easy candy to be
sold as a fund raiser for church or school bazaars.  I used to run a school age childcare and
the kids loved making these every year as a fun sort of treat and as I was always
looking for cheap fun things for them to do, these fit the bill on food experience day!
Thanks for sharing this recipe with the group....I never thought I would ever see
it again!

This St. Patty's Day I decided to add some new treats to my goodie baskets I give out each year. This was one of the new receipes I tried, and I'm so glad I did. They were fun to make and very tasty!!! (My 3 yr. old had a lot of fun helping.) Everyone I gave them to commented on how good they are. I did go a little heavy on the cinnamon to get them dark, next time I think I'll roll them in cinnamon and brown sugar. Will definately be making these again.

These bad boys are addicting. Better than the ones my father bought at local bakery 50 years ago. Made a batch, ate them and made another batch. They are so good they make your tongue want to slap your brains out! Thank you

I make Irish Potato Candy every year with my kids. This is the best recipe I've tried so far. Most of them call for too much cream cheese and my dough winds up being too sticky. This one is perfect!  Like other reviewers stated,chilling the dough is key.

Great recipe- just like the ones from the candy shop.  To the reviewer who asked, I always leave mine out of the fridge. After rolling in cinnamon, I leave them on a cookie sheet in a single layer on the counter uncovered. When they start to get dried out a bit (an hour or less), i turn them over and let them dry another hour or so before moving to a candy dish and covering. This helps them keep their shape and the outside forms a crisp shell while the inside stays soft and creamy.

I made this yesterday.  First time making this candy.  Candy that I have loved, like forever.  Coconut is not one of my favorite things.  Irish Potatoes (with coconut) make me want more.  All went well; no problems.  Question.  Irish Potatoes that I have purchased over the years were at room temperature.  I did chill candy when I was done, per instructions, to firm them.  Can I now leave the candy out?  I just answered my own question.  I left one 'potato' out when I transferred 'potatoes' from the cookie sheet to a container I placed back into the refrigerator.  Is this recipe not the recipe used by the candy stores?  The one I left out for several hours was 'mushy'.  Please help me correct this recipe.

I like the other user used too much cream cheese and the mixture was too goey to roll.  Why not just say 4 oz of cream cheese?  It does come in this size.

I LOVE this recipe, I have been using it for years. I always get compliments on how yummy these little treats are. We always make for my son to take to school, give to family and friends it has gotten to the point I get request for them. Like others have said make sure you chill the filing, as it's basically a cream cheese frosting. Chill after mixing, chill after rolling and chill after powdering. I use a cinnamon and sugar mixture for coating using 3/4 cinnamon and 1/4 sugar ratio.

The flavor is spot on, but there is something off in the ingredient list. My mixture was souping and impossible to work with. Having made Irish Potato Candy before I know this is not how it's suppose to be. I'm disappointed that this reciepe won't be ready for the event I am scheduled to attend this evening. However like the other comments, if I let the mixture rest overnight, it might we salvagable

Good candy. Made as stated.  Little sticky, but that is to be had with this candy.  Doesn't taste quite like ones I have bought-that is why not higher stars.  Guess try to make things that taste as good or better than I can buy.  This candy seems to be hard for me to conquer.  Think this may be like bread in certain parts of county-bagels particularly-tasting different from altitude.  Maybe wrong-my 2cents.

Rich and delicious!  It's basically just thick cream cheese icing with coconut.  Definitely more of a candy than a cookie... so sweet I can only eat 1 or 2 at a time (which is probably a good thing).  Made them for a group of friends and everyone loved them.

Adorable!  
A few tips:  First, do NOT use pure ground cinnamon for the coating.  Use a cinnamon sugar mixture.  Pure cinnamon is WAY too strong.
Second, they are slightly less easy to make than the recipe lets on.  It says "beat" until smooth then use your hands "if necessary" to mix in the coconut.  Technically, you "beat" until your arm gives out, then give up and use your hands.  You'll definitely need to use your hands to mix in the coconut!  Don't use a mixer.  It will not work.
We got 60 potatoes out of it, but some were bigger than others.  They were a lot of fun to make and they went over well at my husband's St. Patrick's Day party at the office.

Love Love Love this recipe! I think it would work for a coconut Easter egg too if covered in dark chocolate. I did mix 1 TBS of cinnamon with 1 TBS of dark cocoa (and a bit of brown sugar) for the coating. My son loves it! So do I :-)

Made these for my husband's afterschool Bible study group.  Easy, a little sticky to shape, chilling would help.  I did chop coconut in food processor and added baking cocoa and a little powdered sugar to the cinnamon to roll them in. they were a hit.  Thanks...may have started a new St. Patrick's Day tradition.

FANTABULOUS!  These didn't last very long at the St Patty's Day party.  I made them several days in advance so they could dry out a little.  Be sure to chill the dough in frig for 1/2 hr before rolling in cinnamon.  I used MacCormick's Saigon cinnamon 
( worth it) mixed with a little brown sugar.

Outstanding!   These were a huge hit at the office for St. Patrick's Day.   I was going to make them again and use colored sugar in the cinnamon for Easter but ran out of time.   Definitely a keeper.

These are fun to make.  My kids really enjoyed making them, however, no one would eat them after trying one.  The initial taste of cinnamon is way too strong and the cream cheese part is just too sugary.  Thanks for sharing though.

Very good.  They are sticky and moist to roll, so definitely plan on refrigerating prior to rolling them into balls.  Yes, these are sweet, but Irish potatoes are synonymous with super sugary sweet goodness :)  The cream cheese makes them moister than usual and taste very good.

I spent time reading through almost all of the reviews and found the hints about chilling the mixture quite helpful.  Instead of using cocoa, I used Godiva Milk Chocolate Hot Chocolate mix, along with the cinnamon.  It was just the right amount sweetness and color is perfect for potatoes.  I also used fat-free cream cheese, which I realize is like having a diet soda with a Baconator, but cutting out some of the fat is better than nothing.  I'm taking these to a carry-in at my school on Wednesday and knowing the staff, there won't be a single potato left by the end of lunch.  The hard is part is going to be hiding them from husband in the meantime.

I made this recipe, minus the coconut. When I mixed it in the mixer, I accidentally turned it into an icing texture rather than a texture for rolling Irish potatoes. Needless to say, the icing was delicious! The sugar content is a little too much though. Next time I will cut back on the sugar. I used it to top spice cake & white cake cupcakes. I am rating this as an icing recipe, if anyone may be interested.

This recipe was made exactly the way it was written - at first.  I didn't have to refrigerate the dough at any time and I think it's because I didn't let the butter get too soft when I softened it.  I had a pretty strong cinnamon flavor, so I re-shook the balls in a plastic freezer bag and that helped to reduce that really strong flavor.  My husband took them to work today and WOW!  They were the hit of the day!!

Great for a St. Pat's party but otherwise wouldn't make again because of the taste. Easy to form into potatoes once chilled, used a mix of  cinn/cocoa/powdered sugar to coat. However biting into a chunk of cream cheese, butter and coconut wasn't that appealing to me. I used the recipe for 40 and was still able to make 60 potatoes! I did have to double the coating mix though.

I found these to be too sweet, but I'm hoping the kids like them. I would cut back on the sugar next time. I also like the idea of rolling them in a combination of sugar, cocoa and cinnamon. They were easy to make in my standing mixer, and I chilled them overnight before rolling them. It's probably a good idea to chill them again after they are rolled and coated. A unique little treat.

I made these for my daughter's social studies class. They were extremely easy to make (I didn't have coconut so I left it out). The kids in her class loved it! It really looked like little potatoes. Even the teacher asked for the recipe.

Looks just like little potatoes.  The taste is interesting and grows on you the more you eat them.  Not my favorite though.

These were delicious.  I've already been asked to make these again.  I did have to add more coconut, the consistancy was too thin to roll into balls.  Next time I will chill the mix before rolling it.

This one was so much fun!  I loved that I could just toss everything into the mixer and let it do all the work and my two year old had lots of fun shaping the candy with me.  I actually doubled the recipe because I didn't want to use just half a stick of butter and cream cheese but I probably won't do it again.  After rolling about half the candy I wished I was done since it makes plenty.  I ran out of coconut so I threw in 1 cup of walnuts to balance it out.  That worked really well and added a nice crunch here and there.

These were cute, although not quite as cute as I imagined. I guess because to make them on such a small scale, they don't really resemble a potato. However, they tasted really good and my guests loved them. I like them, but they are really rich!

Great recipe! I made these last second for some St. Patty's giggles, and fed them to two guys who don't normally like coconut. They loved 'em. They never really firmed up, but I was told that's part of their charm.

really, really good. we took them to a pot- luck and everyone loved them.  if you want to cut the sweetness, use normal coconut, it tastes just as good.

The people that I shared it with seemed to enjoy it more than I did. It reminded me of carrot cake frosting rolled in cinnamon. A bit too sweet for me, but it was a big hit with everyone else. Many people asked for the recipe.

Yummy!  This recipe is so much fun.  You can also roll the potatoes in cocoa powder for a different, but equally delightful flavor.

maybe there was a potato famine coming on that i was unaware of? my sis and i tried to make these and we could not roll the mixture at all due to the consistency of it. we did everything as written and tried to let the mixture stand so that it will harden up a bit. could someone tell us if they had this problem? well we went on to make irish soda bread and thank God that came out lovely.

I made these for a St. Patrick's Day party and they dissapeared before I even noticed.  I heard rave reviews, with everyone saying how much they looked like little baker potatoes, inside and out.  Unlike some reviewers who went for a sweater coating than called for, I found the cinnamon was perfect if it was kept to a light coating.  Anything sweeter would have been overwhelming.

I just made them. They were so easy. I followed thr recipe but didn't need to cool them in between rolling. I just wrapped in plastic wrap as soon as they were mixed in my mixer and cooled for 45 min. Took them out and used a small cookie scoop to measure. I rolled them without needing any grease or spray on my hands. I shook a couple at a time in a plastic bowl with cinnamon and a bit of sugar and placed them on a parchment lined cookie sheet.
I will serve them in two small baskets at the church luncheon. I'm sure kids would love to make them, so try them.

Result is exactly as described (if you follow exactly as instructed)!  My family and I love them and my little boy enjoyed  rolling the candy in the powder.  I followed the  1/2  tbsp of cocoa for every 1 tbsp of cinnamon suggestion since one of us isn’t a huge cinnamon fan..  it looks and tastes great.  Thanks

These are great for their cuteness rather than taste I thought.  Still they were eaten up!  Refrigerating between making and shaping and then again shaping and dusting is a must!

Very good flavor, i think the coconut should have gone through the food processor first the texture was off. and the directions did not say to chill the mixture before forming. I did and it worked pretty well.

I made this recipe after I couldn't find the recipe that I have used for years. This recipe is awful! Horrible to work with because it was gooey and messy. I ended up only making about half the batch then threw the rest away. It would make a great Irish Potato filling for cupcakes though! I found my old recipe and now see what the problems were. The butter is completely unnecessary  so that ingredient should be deleted. That's probably why it was so gooey. Then,  two and a half cups of flaked coconut was way too much. Most likely caused the super sweetness. One cup is enough. Finally, 4 cups of powdered sugar is not enough to get the candies their shape. Approximately 7 cups is more like it. Now that I found my old recipe, I'll be sticking to that one.

I make Irish Potatoes every year.  I use 8 oz cream cheese.  2 lbs of powered sugar 14 oz coconut  1/4 cup butter and 1 tsp vanilla.  It makes over 100 of them.  All my coworkers love them .

These were delicious and easy to make. They were a huge hit at the St.Paddy's party. We quadrupled the recipe. My suggestion is to make one batch at a time. I broke my electric beaters trying to mix the quadrupled batch all at once. I did add a bit of 10X sugar to the cinnamon like someone suggested. And used PAM spray on my hands to roll. Chilling for 30 minutes in between mixing, rolling and cinnamon are key!

This was a very good recipe.  The only thing I would suggest is maybe after mixing the mixture, let chill in the refrigerator for a bit to harden up before trying to roll the balls.  Definitely easier and less messy that way.

I made this recipe with my daughters and followed every step exactly as it says. It came out very messy, gooey, and slimy. My girls love to play with slime and said it had the same consistency.  

The flavor was very sweet, which was fine with me because I have somewhat of a "sweet tooth", but after chilling in the refrigerator over night, it was still too soft and not what I'm used to when eating Irish potatoes in the past. 

I'm told this recipe may have had the wrong amount of cream cheese. I believe it should have been 8 TBSP instead of 8 ounces... Huge difference... but a lesson learned!

This is the recipe I use for chocolate dipped snowballs at Christmas. For Irish potatoes I make divinity, shape them more like an oblong potato and roll them in combo of cocoa powder and cinnamon mixed to taste.  I shave walnuts and stick them into the potatoe to resemble eyes. These don't need to be refrigerated during or after preparation.

Delicious! I would recommend a tiny bit more cream cheese, but that's just my personal taste, b/c I love cream cheese! Definitely refrigerate the mixture before shaping into potatoes and rolling in thhe cinnamon.

Super easy recipe,  and a huge hit with my teenagers!  Definitely chill the dough before rolling like the others are mentioning, it makes rolling the potatoes much easier.

They were cute but the flavor was just okay.  FYI, 4 cups of confectioners' sugar is an entire 1 lb box.  2 and 1/2 cups of flaked coconut is and entire 7 oz bag.  No need to measure.  I definitely used more than 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to coat these.  The dough was very stiff and I had no need to refrigerate before working with it.  It's very easy, but boring to sit there and roll all those little potatoes.

This was an easy and great tasting recipe!  I made a few changes based on previous reviews.  I only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar and used one bag (2 2/3 cups) of organic unsweetened shredded coconut (not as stringy).  After chilling the mixture, I rolled ~50 "potatoes" and coated them by gently shaking them in bag with a mixture of cinnamon, cocoa powder, and a touch of powdered sugar.  I served them in a rolled down brown paper sack (see picture).  They were a hit!

Very Messy! Even when I chilled the mixture before rolling into balls, only rolled 4 before the mix stuck to my hands again.
Maybe need to freeze mixture? Not certain I'll make this again,
Difficult to mix and so messy, I wasted half the mixture on my hands and everywhere it stuck to

I adjusted a little to suit our preferences.  I pulsed the coconut, in the food processor, until it was finely ground. Some of the family is not fond of coconut's texture unless finely ground.  And I think it makes the potatoes much nicer overall.  I used the whole bag of coconut since only a small amount was left over. I added an additional ounce of cream cheese and a pinch of salt to balance the extreme sweetness of the candy.  To the cinnamon I added a little powdered sugar to soften that bold flavor hitting your tongue first. The younger kids eating the candy prefer it that way. Nice recipe that can handle little adjustments and we will make again next year.

This is my favorite. I make dozens and give them away. For a new twist I offer cinnamon or cocoa. I have requests for over 25 dozen this year.

I'm not really a fan of coconut, but my parents are. Made it for them, and gave daddy a sugar rush! Mom thought they were just a tad too rich, but she ate several all the same! PIcky sister even ate them! Make sure you chill them or they will be too sticky to work with!

Worked out great! I did find they were a bit sweeter than I would have liked, and I have a pretty big sweet tooth. Also I think the problem with consistency that some people are having have to do with the cream cheese. Make sure it's in the fridge right up until you start working with it. And as odd as it is, the Philadelphia brick style cream cheese works far better than the stuff in the plastic container, for whatever reason. I used cocoa powder with the cinnamon and I think that cut the sweetness a bit, too.

These were way too sweet.  I had kind of hoped they would at least be cute, but they looked really unappetizing.  Maybe i did something wrong, but i dont think i will try this recipe again.

Made for the 1st time and looking at the simple ingredients wondering....
Turned out to be a surprise favorite among all ages at the party. I followed the recipe exactly (added a little nutmeg) but can see this easily can be changed up(toasting coconut, using cocoa, nutmeg) with great results. Very easy. The "dough" was sticky to roll trick is to coat the piece of dough and then roll it, and chill. EasyEasy! 30mins top in time !

These were fun to make. The kids helped me. They hit the spot just right. However they are incredibly sweet. I did make the balls a little smaller than usual because of the sweetness. But everyone at 2 family reunions loved them. Each adult was good with about 1-2 though. Will definatly make again.

I made this for ST. Patties Day for a potluck with me friends.  It was such a hit I have sent them all here to get the recipe for themselves.  I love it!!!
I did sprikle the candy with cinnamon and sugar instead of rolling them~which was a bit much for us!  Thank you for posting!

How cute are these!!!!  Being of Irish heritage, I always try to find something special for St Patty's day, and this is just the ticket.  A bit on the sweet side, but just great! We will be making these again in the weeks ahead!  Thank you so much, my grandma will be proud!

I cannot get over how much these look like potatoes!They are absolutely adorable to look at, and definitely satisfy a sweet tooth. Tried it out on Catholic school teachers and staff before making for an Irish themed recipe exchange next week - put them in a green container from the Dollar Store, and once everyone got over the "you try it first" bit (have to admit - "potato candy" doesn't SOUND appetizing!) they loved them!I covered mine in a cinnamon/brown sugar mix. Dough got very hard when I had to take a break and refrigerated it - softened up upon rolling it in my hands. Curious to know best way to store leftovers, as they are rather hard upon refrigerating, but leaving them out could cause a sticky mess...?

I needed a recipe to make some up for my son's 2nd grade class. The first I found didn't sound like what I thought the ingredients should be (it didn't have cream cheese)...then I came across this one and gave it a whirl. Well, we have made up 4 batches of them in the past 2 days! The kids love them, my husband requested to take some to work,and we're having a St. Patty's Party and needed some for that.  We did try them without coconut as well, they were still delicious...However, the conistency is stickier and found it a bit messy and hard for the children to roll into balls... So that is my tip if your letting the little handles them, use the coconut.

These were great! I had a recipe for these and lost them.  This was just as good!  Everyone at work loved them!  I put a little less conf. sugar in them, because I ran out.  But I think I liked them even better that way.  They weren't too sweet!
