It is funny, I made this recipe about 10 years ago and now can't find it.  I was very happy to find it here.  The only thing missing is that when you take the meat off the grill, you should wrap it in foil and let it rest for about 5 minutes or so.  You might want to reduce the temperature from 145 to 140 to take that into consideration.  The meat will have a pinkish shell because of the marinade, but the inside meat should be the white of pork.  This is a great one to grill for a party.  I have several times.

In CT and we have 2 feet of snow on the ground and it is snowing as I write this so grilling is out of the question.  Marinated for 24 hours and then roasted in 325º oven at 25 minutes per pound.  After removing from oven, covered with foil and let meat rest 5 minutes.  Absolutely scrumptious and the mouthwatering fragrance of the marinade soaked pork filled out house with a divine scent.  Couldn't be better!

I prepared this before work and let it marinate for over 24 hours, We cooked it on a gas grill on semi indirect heat. We used an electric meat thermometer and cooked until it was about 150 degrees.  145 degrees is a safe temp but a little on the pink side for me. We let it sit for about 5 minutes before carving and It turned out PERFECT!  Juicy on the inside and nicely grilled on the outside.  Since there are only two of us we shared half with the neighbors…they loved it too!  Perfect dinner for a warm fall evening!

This marinade has a slightly oriental flavor that I really like.  I've never grilled pork tenderloin, but it turned out well.  Due to the amount of sugar in the marinade, it is important to oil the grate and use a medium heat, as the submitter stated, or use an indirect method.  I think it would make a great sauce for chicken, pineapple and bell pepper skewers, too!

Loved this marinade! I was looking for a creative way to use some of the plum jam that I made last year and this looked interesting. I followed the recipe exactly for the ingredients, but used pork chops instead of a pork tenderloin. Grilled outside . . .perfect spring/summer food! We'll definitely be having this again!

Marinated Grilled Pork Tenderloin Haiku: "Love pork tenderloin, especially when it's grilled. Tasty marinade." I wish I'd have marinated mine for 24 hrs. (more like half that time for me) b/c I can only imagine how much more flavorful it would've been had it had longer to penetrate w/ that flavor. Halved the recipe for 1 tenderloin that was a little over 1 lb. for 3 of us. Wary of the cinnamon, but used it, and everything else, as directed. Delicious marinade that I'm sure would be just as good on chicken, pork chops, or cheap steak.

One of the best recipes we discovered here. I used a good ground ginger and dehydrated parsley flakes instead of the fresh versions. I also used low sodium soy sauce. I was happy to find that the marinade wasn't overpowered by the soy sauce. It was a nice blend of flavors of all the ingredients. I baked it uncovered  at 350 degrees because it was cold and snowy outside. When the meat hit 145 degrees, I brought it in to rest for 5 minutes before carving it.  As good as the oven was, I can't wait to grill it. I doubled the marinade, brought it a rolling boil for several minutes as a safety measure, and it provided a delicious sauce. Sliced the meat thin and served with rice. Delicious!!

We BBQ pork tenderloin a lot over the summer and I wanted to try something different for a dinner party so decided to try this recipe. After marinating the meat over night, I realized the next morning that I had forgotten to add the honey in the recipe. Couldn't make any changes at that point so proceeded to BBQ the pork as usual and it was a fantastic! I had reserved some of the marinate and drizzled it over the sliced pork. I will try this again with the honey added and decide which we prefer. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was a great change to our normal pork recipes. The Cinnamon really rounded out the flavor. We marinated for about 48 hours then cooked on a rotisserie for about 90 minutes.

My tenderloins were 2.8 lbs. I did marinate for 24 hours in a zip lock turning once in awhile. I had to make a couple substitutes for what I had on stock. Fresh minced onion, about a tablespoon, and Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce in lieu of ketchup, I put two tablespoons of that in. I used dry ginger, all other ingredients I kept as recipe directed. I used my Immersion blender to puree before pouring into the bag with my meat. 
I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the leftover marinade and cooked on the stove top till boiling and thick, used as a baste when grilling the meat. 
Cooked on charcoal grill over direct heat all sides to form nice crust, then moved to indirect heat, turning and basting until internal temp reached 150, about 25 minutes, wrapped in foil until serving. 
This was very good and we liked the added cinnamon,  sort of a Caribbean flare. Meat was so juicy and flavor through out, this is surely a go to recipe for marinating good pork loins.

Used this recipe more than four times, always with perfect results - a favorite go to for pork and our guests always love it and want the recipe. Followed the marinade directions exactly but have made some minor adjustments to cooking to achieve best results. Separate two loins while marinating to intensify the flavor, then tie together with twine to make one roast for cooking. We have found two roasts totaling between 2 & 2 1/2 pounds are ideal. Remove from refrigerator at least 60 minutes before cooking so meat can warm to near room temperature. This helps achieve desired internal temp more quickly at a slightly higher cooking temp without charring the outside of loins. Bring grill up to 400 degrees. Oil grates well. Place roast in center of cooking surface and reduce heat to 350 degrees. Turn roast frequently first five minutes to sear all sides to seal in juices, then turn off center burner to cook using indirect heat continuing to turn roast 3-4 times until internal temp reaches 150 degrees, about 35-40 minutes total cook time. Remove from grill, tent under foil on a cutting board to rest for about 10 minutes. Results will be a very juicy roast, just slightly pink at center. Delicious!!!

I have used this marinade twice and we love it! The only changes were to omit the cayenne pepper and to use dried parsley (all I had at the time) instead of fresh. I roasted it in the oven at 325F convection setting for about 45 minutes. I added more marinade to the pan while roasting to keep the meat moist and turned it a couple of times.  I also allowed the meat rest for about 10 min. before slicing.

I consider myself a good cook, & I will be trying this marinade this weekend.  I have to say to giftshop....the ingredients are basics that most cooks have in their kitchens.  Please don't  rate a recipe because you don't have the things to make it.  I have had the pleasure of knowing Emeril Lagasse before he became famous & learned so much from him. That was before I really started to live cooking.  Thanks Allrecipes for your great selection of recipes.

This is now my favorite bbq marinade. I did not use / have the oyster sauce but the combination of ginger, garlic, and cinnamon with a touch of cayenne gave it a great flavor with a zing at the end.

I love this recipe! I made the marinade yesterday but I doubled the recipe because I had four tenderloins. I followed the recipe pretty much exact except I added one tablespoon of cilantro to the marinade. I marinated the pork for 24 hours then grilled it on the BBQ for about 25 minutes. While the meat was grilling I heated the leftover marinade on the stove until it came to a boil then let it cool off and served it on the side. My husband loved tenderloin done this way with the sauce drizzled over the meat. Thank you! I will be adding this recipe to my rotation. - Jill

I really did not make any changes except we cooked it in the oven instead of the grill. We followed the recipes and were delighted with the results. Our company enjoyed it and wanted to pass on their approval to us, however the kudos need to go to  the lady who came up with the recipe.

Loved it! Only had time to marinate for 6 hours. I had enough marinade for two 18 oz pork loins. Easy & delicious. Will definitely be making this a lot this summer.

Marinated two tenderloins total weight 3.3 lbs. overnight. Tied them together and charcoal grilled to 138 degrees...put on tray covered with foil and temp walked up to 142 degrees. Before grilling made another recipe of marinade. Used a mix of 1 Tbl corn starch and 1 Tbl water. Brought marinade to boil and added just enough cornstarch mix to thicken to consistency of maple syrup for dipping. Served with grill roasted red skin potatoes with cabbage and onion using a 5 qt cast iron Dutch oven, and sauted french green beans finished with a little hoisin and soy sauce. The marinade dipping sauce was great. Good dinner. So simple for big flavor.

This was REALLY good.  Followed the recipe with the exception that I didn't have fresh ginger, so subbed a small amount of ground ginger that I had on hand.  Marinated it for 24 hours and then grilled for 20 minutes, which was perfect.

I made this. It was really good. I kicked it up a bit and smoked in my pellet grill for about 1.5 hours until the internal temp hit 145 degrees.  I also reserved the left over marinade added some orange juice and some water (it was so strong it needed taming) and boiled it and used it for a gravy.  delicious.

OK WOW!  I am usually skeptical  about marinades. This one is worth making. I'm putting this in my binder and will definitely make it again! I cooked this over a charcoal fire. Amazing. The pork came out tender and juicy. I marinated them (2) overnight. Awesome recipe.

I made this last night in the Crockpot.  It turned out really well.  I marinaded it overnight first and served it over rice and broccoli. I didn't have oyster sauce so I substituted broth and reduced the cayenne to 1/8 tsp since I'm no a big fan of spicy food.  I will be making this again.

Instead of grilling it I cooked it on a skillet and it tasted great

Very good. The pork was flavorful. moist and tender. The sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes, but I don’t have much of a sweet tooth. Will make again.

This is a very flavourful recipe. I followed it as written but for the ketchup that I replaced by some canned crushed tomato. Dont hesitate to double the spices if you like it so. I marinated it for a whole night and morning. I cooked it in a plate in my oven during 30 mn, then top with an aluminium paper and cook it 20 mn more : the meat was perfectly tender, not dry at all but no more pinkish as pork should always be well cooked. 1 tenderloin made for me 2 servings : once hot with chickpeas and squash, then the remains as cold slices with a tomatoe, celery and lettuce salad. Both were perfect.

I made this per the recipe. My only variation was cooking the marinade, adding a little corn starch to thicken it and serving it over the sliced tenderloin. Got great comments from our dinner guests. This will be one of my go tos for a long time.

Marinade is delicious and definitely was glad I marinaded overnight as recommended. Couldn’t grill bc of weather but followed other reviews suggestions for cooking in oven and served it with garlic Parmesan potatoes and asparagus. It was a hit!

The marinade for this pork was truly delicious. I left out the brown sugar (it already had enough honey and ketchup for sweetness) and I used minced green onion in place of the onion powder. I marinated a 1lb lean pork tenderloin for about 10 hours (all day when I was at work). I dumped the pork and marinade into a few tablespoons of hot canola oil in a pan on the stove and seared it for about 3 minutes each side on a medium-high heat. I covered a sheet pan with aluminum foil and sprayed the foil so the pork wouldn’t stick, and put the seared pork on the pan and baked it at 375 for 25 minutes. I brought it out to rest for 5 minutes and the temp of the pork climbed to 165 while resting. If you want a more medium pork, I’d cook it for 20 minutes instead. Best marinade hands down. Will use it again! Thank you!!

This has great flavour. I used the cayenne and it wasn’t overpowering but over the coarse of the meal it builds up. Easy to prep and easy to cook.

This was a excellent marinade.  I was a little concerned on the amount a garlic used in the recipe, but when the other ingredients were added it was perfect.  However, if you are not a garlic lover, I would suggest using less.  I did use 2 smaller pork tenderloins, marinaded for 6 hours and grilled it according to the directions.  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this a few times now and although I'm not a huge pork fan but this was delicious. I smoked mine for about 30 mins before cooking.  Caution: be sure to not over cook this. Take it off at 140 and let rest.

Perfect as is! Not one change and rave reviews.  Made extra marinade,  reserved for sauce.  Heated and it thickened perfectly on its own.  Will definitely do this again.

This is an excellent pork tenderloin recipe. Subbed hoisen sauce for oyster sauce.  I marinated all day then grilled until 145 degrees then let rest. Poured the left over marinade into a pan and reduced. Whisked in about a forth to a half cup of chicken broth and a T butter. Pour over sliced meat. So good!

I made this tonight for my parents, in-laws, and brother's family, and everyone raved about it! I wasn't sure my father-in-law would like it, being a pretty standard 'liver & onions' type farm guy, but even he piled on the compliments! It really was incredibly delicious. My only regret is that I didn't make more of the marinade. I boiled it down a little to use as a sauce and it was so good my brother asked for a spoon! Now we have leftover meat but no sauce - I might just have to make more...

Great recipe.  I did cut the soy sauce in half to cut down on the sodium and also added 2 tablespoons of sesame oil because we love the flavor of sesame.  Will definitely make again.

I made this 3 times now and everyone raved about it.  I used chopped onions, not onion powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I definitely marinade the meat for at least 24 hours.   After putting the meat on the grill, I boil the marinade for at least ten minutes and serve with pork loin.  Leftovers, if you have any, make excellent sandwiches the next day.

This marinade is great. I cut the pork in slices about 3/4 inch thick before adding them to the marinade and grilled them on my Vision komado grille. The flavor was great with a little smoke added from the grill. the meat was moist and very tender.

My wife and I loved it ! there was no overpowering asian flavor just a subtle hint. We marinated for 36 hours before I put it on my preheated Weber kettle grill
At 145 degrees I took them off and tented it with aluminum foil for 5-7 minutes. They were fork tender and cooked perfectly moist and flavorful. I did not discard the marinade, but put it in a sauce pan with a little corn starch and thickened it up, for basting and drizzle on the medallions. served with some homemade German sweet and slightly sour red cabbage and homestyle apple sauce. This is a KEEPER !

May want to cook a few minutes less; I have a Weber Q Grill so the grill plates are fairly close to the grill so meat cooks quickly. The marinade is excellent and the tenderloin kept the flavor through the entire meat. Nice Recipe

I used the marinade for a London broil and let it sit in the fridge for 2 days.  It was excellent!  This is a great marinade for pork, beef and chicken.

This marinade was really good.  I marinated a pork loin roast instead of a tenderloin then grilled it on a gas grill at 250 - 300 off of the direct heat.  I made it for my friends tonight and they all want the recipe.  I did not have parsley so I left that out but followed the recipe exactly.  This is a winner..

recipe is just fine.  cooking until 145 degrees is too long if you let it rest.  I'd recommend 135 degrees for anyone letting it rest for 10 minutes or more before serving.

I made this and it  was really good.  I didn't have oyster sauce so I used double soy sauce.  I've since bought oyster sauce for next time.  There certainly will be a next time.  We had leftovers so I took some fresh veggies and stir fried them added some of the sauce and heated up the leftover meat.  Served it on top of rice and the meat was still so tender and tasty.  Give this recipe a try.  You won't be disappointed .

We will be making this again.  I cut back on the cayenne pepper (taste preference)and used low-sodium soy salt, but other than that made it as written.  Wrapped the grilled pork in foil for 5 minutes while the rest of the dinner finished.  Yum yum yum. So glad to have leftovers.

I did make it and it was good, not quite "great" but good.  I liked the flavors, and so did my friends but it wasn't "all that".  Leftovers were delicious in a salad the next day.

I put in more onion powder and cayenne because it felt short but I doubt it changed the original idea one bit. I also thought it would be too sweet without vinegar but it wasn't at all. Great recipe and beautiful salt balance without adding any.

Love this recipe, and the only ingredient I didn't already have on hand was the Oyster sauce - worth all the measuring.  Printed July 14/16

Some years ago, I prepared numerous pork loins this way.  Then I purchased a smoker, then another, and another.  Since that time, I have brined most things I smoke, including pork loin.  Brines can be Cajun, Jamaican, western, Italian, etc. as I also use a rub of similar flavor.  Slow smoke with fruit woods--plum; apricot, peach,  apple, etc.

this looks delicious. BUT! For someone who is allergic to all things deafood and shellfish, how do you replace the umami flavor from the Oyster Sauce?  Anybody with suggestions?

Easy and amazing results.  I substituted agave syrup for honey because I didn't have honey. I would make this again.

This was a hit at my barbecue.  I used a huge pork tenderloin in cryovac (about 12 lbs) and cut it into 2 big roasts and the rest in medallions for a group that was to come a little late. I followed the recipe exactly except for not letting meat rest and I think that was an important step to miss.  Everyone was so hungry and I was feeling pressured!  The smaller roast was done perfect, the larger was a little pink, so I put it back on the grill for a little while.  In retrospect, I should have just wrapped it in foil and waited for it to finish.  But thanks to the marinade, it didn't seem to matter.  The taste was delicious! I will definitely make this again!!

I'm not one to write reviews but this marinade is so freakin amazing I had to let others know! I had a 4lb pork loin that was cut into 12  3/4 in. medallions so I tripled the recipe and put in a plastic bag, my dinner plans had changed so I ended up marinating for 24 hours but 4 hours would have been just as well, we grilled them and they were absolutely melt in your mouth perfection!  I did forget to put half of the marinade in something else so I boiled it to remove the bacteria and such, I'm so glad to have had the extra sauce but let me tell ya, you won't need it because the meat is fabulous without it. I can't wait to use this on everything! THANK YOU for sharing!!

This was great for the grill! It had a lovely caramelized flavor. I didn't have onion powder so I used chopped shallots. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thank you Donna!

Marinated for 24 hrs and it was terrific.  Served with mushroom orzo, found on this site as well, and grilled vegetables.
