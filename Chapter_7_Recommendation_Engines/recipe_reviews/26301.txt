This was eaten enthusiastically by the people at a pot luck dinner.  Because of time constraints I had to make it the day before.  I thought it would allow the flavors to blend, but I wouldn't recommend it since the pasta, cheese and onion all absorbed the dressing and turned brownish from the balsamic vinegar.  But it tasted great and the appearance didn't stop anyone from eating it!

I LOVE this salad.  I add sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives as well.  I find that you don't need an entire 10 oz package of baby spinach (I only use about half of a 6 oz bag).

This was delicious and is a new favorite. I added black olives, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes. The recipe makes a TON though, so i had enough for several meals. I served this as a side to "Firecracker Grilled Alaska Salmon" from this site and they went together very well.

I used farfalle instead of orzo and since my husband does not care for feta, I substituted with a mixture of provolone and mozzarella cheeses.  I also added grated Romano, salt, garlic powder and parsley.  I toasted the pine nuts for added flavor.

Oh my this was wonderful. I could've eaten just this for a couple of days and been very happy. I halved the recipe and served it for guests, who demanded the recipe. :) The only changes I made were using fresh basil instead of dried and black pepper instead of white. I know there is a lower fat/calorie feta cheese that I might try next time. Yes there will be a next time on this one!

Loved it - so good for any occasion. Barely used any Olive Oil - and put the juice of 1 lemon and the balsamic vinegar. Love this also with baby Roma tomatoes, or cherry tomatoes!

I've made this several times and its a great recipe that works well if you want to alter it a little for different tastes or what you have handy. I've used asiago cheese instead of the feta, also different vinegars like white balsamic, white wine and rice wine. Also, not a fan of pine nuts, but almonds go great. If you want your spinach wilted, you can put it in the colandar and then drain the orzo ( you can also substitute a variety of pastas) over the spinach to wilt it without extra cooking. Enjoy.

Yum!  What a great flavor.  I will make this again and again!  Even 1/2 the recipe makes a lot, so I'll make 1/4 next time.

I left out the pine nuts (not a big fan), but added some strips of leftover roast chicken I had. It was very filling, fresh-tasting, and delish!

Terrific!  Don't add the spinach until the last minute, but everything else can be done ahead.  Had a large group for memorial day and with multiple cooks and multiple dishes, this was hands down the big winner!

Wonderful!  I used fresh basil and mint from the garden, and one 10 oz bag of spinach that I placed in a bowl and cut up with scissors.  We all loved it!   I am VERY CAREFUL to avoid pine nuts imported from China, after having come down with a nasty condition called "pine mouth" last year.

THIS IS SO GOOD! I love it. My husband loves it. Just don't get bulk pine nuts from Whole Foods--you'll get pine nut mouth (or pine mouth). Google it. It sucks. Stick to the little bags they sell in the cooking aisle with the sliced nuts.

You wouldn't think it, but this recipe is so yummy.  Every time I make it, someone asks me for the recipe. I use sliced almonds instead of pine nuts and balsamic vinaigrette dressing instead of the separate oil and vinegar.  Always a winner.

This recipe was fantastic.  It was very simple to make--less than half an hour from prep to putting it on the table.  The pasta salad was light and fresh tasting, a nice change from all the heavy winter foods.  It would be great on its own for a light lunch, or paired as a side dish for dinner.  I chopped a 6 oz package of fresh, pre-washed spinach, and it didn't take long and the flavor and texture were great.  Also, as for the half an onion--I had a pretty large red onion and chopped just a touch more than half.  I personally LOVE onion, but it was still too much.  Be really careful of how much you add, because too much is overpowering.  Try using a small onion.  I used a smaller portion of tri-color fusilli (corkscrew) pasta.  I cut back on the olive oil because it's so fattening.  Also, I thought the balsamic vinegar should be used sparingly.  It adds a nice flavor, but I would recommend going with a little less until you taste it and see how you like it, then cautiously adding more.  I liked the suggestion of using some sun dried tomatoes in this dish and the fact that you can play around with different flavors in the feta.  I'll use those tips myself the next time I make this dish!

This makes a ton of salad!  I made it for a dinner party of 4 and thought I would have a little left over for lunches but there was way too much left over.  Next time I will cut the recipe down.  I also did not have pine nuts because they were too expensive.  I used walnuts instead.  I only had a 5oz package of baby spinach but I thought it was a good amount.  This was a good recipe and I will make it again but next time I am going to add more feta.  This is a good summer salad.

Brought this salad to numerous parties and it was loved by all.  I used white balsamic which made it look lighter or more summer refreshing.

I followed the recipe exactly, and as is, this salad was extremely bland.  I had very high hopes for it, but I brought it to a a potluck and no one was impressed.  I think it's a good idea, but it definitely needs some tweaking.

I've been making this since 2008, and every time I make it I'm asked for the recipe.  I toast the pinenuts and don't add them until just before serving.  I have also used Trader Joe's Harvest Grains Blend (of Israili Couscous, Orzo, Baby Garbanzo Beans, and Red Quinoa) in place of the plain orzo and it's just as good.  I also do not rinse the orzo in cold water, but let is cool on a cookie sheet as instructed in the article on this site, "Five Steps to Perfect Pasta Salad."

Loved it!  Didn't have orzo so I used a box of bowtie pasta and it was excellent.  Make sure to toast the pine nuts - 8 minutes at 350 degrees is what I did - it brings out the true flavor.  I added fresh basil and oregano from the garden.  Next time I think I'll add some peas as well.  Definitely a keeper!

I just made this salad and it is a good starting point.  The juice of 1/2 a lemon really brought out all the flavors.  I also used fresh basil and added artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes.  This is quite a large salad when it is finished and it makes 8 very generous portions.  Thanks for the original.  :o)

Super!  I used fresh basil but otherwise followed the recipe.  Easy and beautiful appearance with the red onion and spinach colors.  Only thing I will change next time is some minced garlic.

Very good! I added artichokes and fresh basil instead of dried, since I love fresh basil in salads. I toasted the pines nuts, too. It's perfect for a potluck because it makes a ton. Yummy and not heavy, which is nice for summer. I plan on making this again and again. Definitely a keeper!

Well, I love spinach, feta and pine nuts, so I figured I would love this recipe. I did! I used just a little bit of finely diced shallots instead of the red onion. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was perfect.

First of all, I did a few things differently: fresh basil, cherry tomatoes, scallions instead of red onion and I added artichoke hearts. I made it for a bday party spread and it was very popular- recipe requested! It's really good, I did 5 because it is pasta salad, but there's something a little different and refreshing about this. Plus you can make it your own.

I served this as part of our Mother's Day meal and everyone enjoyed it. I thought the balsamic vinegar was a little pungent but it could have been the cheap brand I used. The salad was better after sitting a day in the fridge...really gave the orzo time to soak up the flavor. I will make this again but might try red or white wine vinegar.

I actually ate this warm as a side dish (cut the recipe in 1/4). I heated the oil, onion, and some garlic in a pan, then added fresh basil, the spinach, pepper, and balsamic vinegar and heated for a few minutes before adding the pasta. Sprinkled with the feta cheese and voila, ate warm... delicious.

This was very good.   I didn't have any orzo on hand, so I used couscous as a replacement.  Also, I didn't want to pay for pine nuts, so I substituted sunflower seeds.  Made a great side dish.  Thanks!

This was Very good, although I did not use as much oil as the recipe calls for.   We ate it for days afterwards.  YUM!

A new favorite! I tried to make more of a main dish out of this so I added diced chicken breast. Also used sliced almonds instead of pine nuts (they are so expensive!). Served hot after making, ate leftovers cold the next day, wonderful both ways. Thanks for the simple and delicious recipe:)

Took this to my son-in-law's extended family picnic on July 4th. Only thing I did different was to add some sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts & olives. I got raves. One cousin texted my daughter the next day: "I can't stop thinking about that orzo salad from your mom. Could you beg her for the recipe?"

I halved the ingredients but there's still a lot of orzo. I omitted the pine nuts and put in chopped kalamata olives. Without the olives, it would be rather bland. I also added some salt and a splash of lemon juice. I wish I have sundried tomatoes too like others have suggested.

I never knew what to bring to potlucks before, but with this recipe I hit the jackpot!  It always gets raves and people always ask for the recipe.  I have passed it on more times than I can remember.  I tweak the recipe a little bit.  I use packaged spinach and don't bother to chop it.  I probably use less red onion than called for and I use white balsamic vinegar which keeps the orzo white instead of turning it brown.

Great pasta salad.  A new favorite of mine.  I add a bit more baby spinach then called for because it soaks down to nothing.  Also recommend using WHITE balsamic vinegar.  Loved this and I don't rate very many recipes!

WOW!  I just made this, hasn't even chilled yet, but it tastes sooo good!  I toasted my pine nuts, added tomatoes, and cooked the orzo in chicken broth to add extra flavor...I can already tell this will be a keeper.  The pine nuts add a wonderful crunch, also I used one container of regular feta and one lemon and oregano flavored.  Make this salad and you won't be disappointed!!!
I am back, adding to my review.  This salad is absolutely my new favorite.  You can even sub some of the chicken broth you cook the orzo in for some of the olive oil.  I did this to cut down on the fat, and WOW!  It packs in a ton of flavor.  I gave some to my mom, who took it to work and added a grilled chicken breast to it.  She called to say it was her new fave as well!  MAKE THIS!

This was a wonderful side dish that incorporated two great items into one.  The flavors and the textures were excellent.  I made the recipe for 4 and it was enough for eight, which means that I'll have leftovers... Yum!  Thank You

This salad tastes amazing from the moment you make it and will last for days in the fridge (if you hide it from the other members of your household).  Nutritious, tasty, even spinach haters loved this one.

I was looking for an orzo salad recipe to get some ideas from and this one did the trick. I made a few changes for extra flavor. I cooked my orzo in chicken broth. added a few teaspoons of capers and caper brine, used fresh basil, and toasted my pine nuts before adding. I also lightly wilted my spinach before mixing it in with the pasta. If I have sun-dried tomatoes around, I'll chop and add those too. This is a go to summer dish in my house!

Amazing! Didnt change a thing. The only thing I might change is leaving out the pine nuts as they are expensive, and in my opinion, didnt add that much to the over all flavor of the salad! Great for dinner parties- it makes soooo much! Will def. make again!

I made this into a main dish salad by adding some shredded chicken. I also omitted the onion, just because I didn't have it on hand, and used fresh basil (about 1 TBS) instead of dried. This was fabulous. A great light, summer meal. I served it with warm pita bread and roasted red pepper hummus and tzatziki sauce for dipping.

This is a simple, delicious and refreshing salad!  Perfect for pot lucks and large groups, makes plenty to go around!  I did find that pine nuts were either hard to find or expensive when I did find them, so I substituted sunflower seeds!  Perfect addition.  Adds a nice salty crunch.  Will be making this again...and again...

Simple. Tasty. Eaten with enthusiasm! I mixed the white pepper and basil in with the olive oil and vinegar before pouring it over the the rest of the ingredients, and that made it coat more evenly.

I made this today and I used 1/4 cup of both the vinegar and olive oil, used almonds instead of pine nuts and it is delicious.  Will definitely do it again.  
FYI:  I did not rince the orzo in cold water and I put the onion and spinach in the warm orzo after I drained it.

I bought orzo from Trader Joe's the other day and didn't know what to do with it, so I looked up recipes that had orzo and spinach (because love spinach).

Now, I'm a college student, so my pantry isn't very diverse and I usually end up just throwing together a potpourri of whatever I have. Here are the modifications I made:

8 oz orzo pasta
10ish oz spinach
1/4 red onion
+parsley flakes
+ground black peppercorn
+artichoke hearts
+ground cumin
+shredded provolone and italian cheeses

I eyeballed the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and modified to my liking just because anything with 1/2 cup of either ingredient seems a bit much for my taste. I do wish I had pine nuts and feta cheese, though.

I've made this salad twice and both times people asked for the recipe. Really delicious! I added a little garlic because I like garlic.

I loved it. I used balsamic vinaigrette instead of vinegar (after the fact), and just used about half of the combination because of my mistake, but it turned out great. Also did not use onion or dried basil because I didn't have any. I used a little italian seasoning instead. I would make it again, for sure. Although this recipe make a lot. I would cut the recipe in half next time.

I have been buying a salad similar to this at Whole Foods and Wild Oats for nearly $10.00 a pound.  I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I added some kalamata olives, otherwise stuck true to the recipe.  Love it - Thanks!

it was nice... a little bland. i'd add olives next time, and maybe dried cranberries? it needs something. and the pasta proportion is too high. but i liked it.

This is a nice change of pace for a pasta based salad - no mayo and no overwhelming bottled Italian dressing.  I do believe the proportions are a bit off, though.  I used half the dressing amount and it was plenty to coat the salad without being too oily (be sure to add the seasonings and mix the oil and vinegar until they emulsify fully before adding it to the salad).  I think the onion instruction is too vague.  I started with 1/4 of a red onion and finely chopped it.  It came to a scant 1/2 cup and that was more than plenty - and I like red onion.  While the feta adds a depth of flavor to this that I like, the finished product was only okay- not great.  As written it's a 3 star recipe for us - average and not one that we'd go back to.  I decided to doctor up the leftovers (of which there were plenty) and added in some chopped kalamata olives, some artichoke hearts and, believe it or not, some craisins.  Now it's something we like well enough to keep and repeat.

I had high hopes for this salad and am completely disappointed. I couldn't even eat a bowl of it and am considering chucking the whole thing in the trash. The red onion and balsamic are sooo much and practically burned my mouth with their intensity, and that was all I could taste with every bite. I followed directions and recipe exactly, and am left with a vinegary, ugly mess. Maybe it will get better after refrigerating? Doubt it, and am pissed I wasted perfectly delicious orzo on this recipe!

YUM!  Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I didn't read the reviews prior to making it like I usually do, and so I doubled the recipe.  We had 9 people for Thanksgiving who ate on this salad for 3 days, and we had still had some left over after everyone left!  So yes, it does make a lot.  Also, I will use less oil/vinegar next time.   I substituted slivered almonds for the pine nuts and it was perfect - added just a slight amount of crunch.  Will definitely make this again.

This was nice, but I thought it was a bit too much balsamic. I used a good balsamic, and I do like it, but next time will probably reduce to 1/4 cup.

This salad is very good as is.  It is also an easy salad to customize to specific tastes.  The one change I always make is to add kalamata olives.  I have liked using fresh basil and putting it into the oil/vinegar to infuse.  If the salad is for a special occasion, it's nice to add yellow peppers for color, or top with cherry tomatos.  If I don't want the red onion so strong, I substitute scallions or use a bit of both. I've used pine nuts, walnuts or a combination and found all very good.   For appearance, the suggestion to use white balsamic vinegar and add the spinach right before serving so it doesn't wilt are good tips.   Great recipe Christine.  Thanks.

This is a really good salad! I needed a pasta dish for a potluck and I wanted something unique so I thought I would try this. I made 2 changes though: First, I added a bit of sugar, probably 2 tsps to the dressing as mine tasted quite bitter, (Whether this is due to the fact that I had a bitter vinegar, or don't like too tangy of dressings I'm not certain.) Second, I substituted sunflower seeds for the pine nuts. I had trouble finding the pine nuts in the store, and I knew when I found them they would cost more than I would want, so when I saw the sunflower seeds, I made a snap decision. Altogether a yummy (and pretty!) salad. Next time I'm gonna add sun dried tomatoes...

Yummy!  I was out of feta so I grated some fresh parm. I had on hand but only used about 8 oz.  I also just used onion powder instead of onion.

Loved this!! I can imagine it also with cherry tomatoes or even sundried tomato too. Black olives would be great in this dish. I did put in more chopped spinach than called for but that was the only difference for the first time making it.

Excellent! I used fresh basil, added a couple tomatoes, and didn't use quite the whole bag of spinach. I also only used about 1/4 cup pine nuts and the rest walnuts because I'm cheap. :)

I love the fresh taste of this salad.  I like to use white balsamic vinegar instead.  I think the salad just looks better.  I also like to add some fresh tomatoes for taste and color contrast.  I always get complements on this.

I like this salad and it's nice to throw in fridge and eat for lunch. I first tried without feta and feta definitely makes it.  I might prefer a little sweetness to the dressing.  Maybe I might mix a a little sugar or honey in with the balsamic vinegar and oil next time.  I think another reviewer said lemon might help too.  Overall, very good though, and I love anything with pine nuts!

Easy and yum! I use whole wheat orzo and fat-free feta. I also like to toss in black olives. Grape tomatoes would bo good too. It reminds me of Whole Foods' orzo salad.  I've served this two times to company and have gotten great reviews. My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe. =)

Loved it! The salad was super fresh and tasted better than the store bought kind. I used white balsamic vinegar per another cook to keep the salad from turning brown and also added some fresh chopped heirloom tomatoes. It was so delicious and a coworker asked for the recipe. Thanks!

Easy and a nice blend of flavors.  The feta adds a saltiness that is perfect with the spinach and orzo.

I wont rate it as I changed it up - I used 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup and it seemed like plenty.  I also used the juice of one lemon.  2 tsps sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 clove garlic (minced), 2 tomatoes (chopped), 1 tsp oregano and closer to 1 T basil.  I didnt add any cheese or pine nuts and used black pepper instead of white.  I really like it - YUM!!  I added the pasta warm so the spinach wilted down a little and I think I'd like more spinach in it.  Olives would be good and fresh herbs would be better.  I love finding recipes like this that are easy to change up to suit your tastes or what you've got in your cupboards/fridge :)  I needed a way to use up my spinach and this was perfect!  OK - AR is making me rate it....so keep in mind I made it as written above ;-)

I thought this dish was delicious, although I did make a few slight alterations.  Since I do not like feta cheese, I used mozzarella instead.  This made it savory and delicious.  I toasted the pine nuts in advance and used fresh basil instead of dried.  Also, I would recommend using less olive oil than it calls for - mine was exceptionally oily (and I love olive oil).  Finally, this works great as a main course as well.  I served it warm and it was absolutely fantastic.  I will definitely make this dish again.

This was good. I added halved cherry tomatoes for color/flavor. This makes A LOT so next time I will 1/2 the recipe and that would be plenty for my family of 4 for dinner/leftovers etc.  I used my own balsamic vinagrette and a few extra splashes of balsamic vinegar.  Good and healthy.

I'm usually not a fan of traditional pasta salads, but this turned out to be a great side for a dinner I made for my boss.  As per other suggestions, I added the spinach just before serving and used a balsamic vinaigrette (I made Good Seasons) for the dressing.  It went really well with "Swordfish with Citrus Pesto" (Giada's recipe on Food Network), and a basic tomato salad (tomato, onion, basil, olive oil).  I also substituted blue cheese to keep with the Italian theme, and I just loved the taste.

This was delicious!!!  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings, then I just drizzled some olive oil on the salad, but measured 1/4 c for the vinegar.  I added tomatoes.  Thank you for the great recipe!  So delicious!

Wow. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but didn't like this at all.  I think I did it as read, so I am surprised that it was such a hit with everyone else.  to me, too much orzo to ratio of veggies.  thanks anyway.

This is very good. I made mine warm and served it as a side dish. Rather than rinsing the pasta in cool water I immediatly added the spinach, onions etc. It wilts the spinach and slightly blanches the onions. I served it right away while still warm.

This was really big hit with my friends.  Instead of 10 oz of spinach I used 6 oz because that was the biggest size package I could find at the grocery store.  I also cut the oil and vinegar in half so it was 1 cup total.  Lastly, I added some sun dried tomatoes.

This is a nice, quick recipe that's easily adjusted for a few friends or a large group. My sister, the culinary student, now wants the recipe. In my version, I added some diced tomato and served it with flat bread wedges. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner.  If you followed the recipe exactly and found it bland, it is probably because you need to let it refrigerate for a few hours minimum and over night even better.  Stir it well before serving.  The salad I made was full of flavor and everyone raved about it. It's a 5 star for sure.

Yum!  Great healthy side for burgers or sandwiches instead of chips or fries.  Perfect with whole wheat orzo.  I used fresh basil and toasted the pine nuts for more flavor.  Next time I will halve the dressing.  For those that thought it was too acidic and tasted too much like vinegar - you need to use a better balsamic.

YUM! this is a fantastic recipe. I toasted the pine nuts to bring out the nutty flavor, and it was great!  Althought next time, I think I will use half the oil and vinegar recommended because the balsamic was a little overwelming. and i'll probably put more feta cheese in because that's how i like it.  very very yummy!!

This was okay, not great.  Maybe served under some grilled chicken with some greek dressing it would be good, but as a salad it was really missing something.  I brought it for a pot-luck and had most of the bowl left by the end of the evening.  It really could use something extra, like some black olives and cucumbers to give it some depth.

This was a great side dish to go along with summer grilling.  The balsamic vinegar taste was great, but did make for a dark colored dish.  I used white balsamic vinegar the second time I made it and liked it just as much.

This salad was oh so yummy!  I toasted the pine nuts because, as with all nuts, it brings out the essential oils and gives the dish a better flavor.

My only complaint with this salad was that the ratio of orzo to spinach is not what I thought it would be.  In the picture it looks like more spinach, however, my final dish was predominately a pasta dish with spinach in it.  Also, the size of the dish was huge.  I had a party with 10 people and half of the salad was still left.  I used it as a side dish though; if it was served as an entrée the number of servings would be more accurate.

I will definitely make this dish again.  I will make it smaller though and adjust the pasta ratio though to make it more of a salad.  I might try to add olives and possibly sundried tomatoes, as others had suggested, to give it a little boost.

Overall:  You don't want to pass this easy yet delicious dish up!

Warning, this makes A LOT!!  I halved the recipe and easily had 6-8 servings.  It was really good!  I followed the recipe as written (of course in half) and it had great flavor that wasn't overpowering.  I served this alongside Citrus Salmon (on this site) and it was a perfect compliment.  I love how much spinach was hidden in here too :)  This was crisp, filling and nutritious.. winner winner!!

Oh My Goodness, this salad is delish.
I made it for the first time last night and my son and daughter fell in love. I don't alter a recipe the first time. I do think that craisins would be very good,also almonds if you don't have pine nuts. Will try with sundried tomatoes next time also. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this salad many times. The first time I made it as written, then for convenience I have used a good balsamic vinaigrette instead of the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I change it up by adding olives, roasted red peppers, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, diced cucumber - it all works. It's good the day you make it and even better the day after.

This was pretty good.  I used gorgonzola as I don't like feta.  I think next time I will play with the dressing a little more because the balsamic was a little overpowering and overall the dressing was not very interesting.  But a good base salad that you can work from.

This is a great light pasta salad. I would go a bit easier on the olive oil/vinegar next time. I only made a half batch and that was still a large amount.

My entire family loved this!  I read some of the previous reviews and used about 2/3 of a one pound box of orzo.  I also had a small can of sliced black olives in the pantry so I added them.  I think that really helped.  As far as extra dressing is concerned, if this sits a few days I can see where it would be needed.  But since I didn't use all of the orzo this came out perfect.  Again, definately a keeper.  This would be great at a pot luck or summer BBQ.

Really good. I didn't use all the olive oil but next time I will.  A little dry.  However, I think next time I will use Sundried Tomatoes packed in oil for a more robust flavor.

I liked this a lot, but the rest of the family didn't share my enthusiasm.  They suggested that more feta cheese and some garlic might help.  I'll try that next time.

The recipe was absolutely delicious. I made it for a company brunch and everyone raved. Several people asked for the recipe and immediately made it that weekend. My only issue was that the recipe makes way too much salad. Please cut the recipe to 4 servings. Of course, it really wasn't hard to find people to help me eat it.

I used a rotini pasta to fill the dish out a little more and it was pretty good.  I served it as a side dish with chicken and then took just the salad for lunch the next day.  The spinach was just starting to get wilty after 2 days in the fridge so if you plan to have leftovers, add the spinach in as you go.

This is a really good recipe. I served it as a side with leg of lamb. I didn't have pine nuts, so I diced up some artichoke hearts instead (just the bottoms). I also had some fresh basil on hand that I wanted to use up so I used it instead of the dried.

Delicious. I used baby arugula instead of spinach just because it was in the refrig and was quite happy with it. My husband squabbled about the color (a result of good quality balsamic), but we all liked the flavor...even three days later!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe, as did everyone else I served it to.  I was concerned that 1/2 cup each of the oil and balsamic was going to make it too soggy, so I halved each the first time I made it.  But it realy needs that extra moisture so leave the portions as is.  Just an outstanding salad!  Can always substitute other pasta shapes: bowties, penne, fusilli, etc.

I used fresh basil instead of the dried.  I also used the Mediterranean flavored feta and used more feta than it called for.  I grilled boneless chicken breast with greek seasoning and sliced and served it on top of the salad.  I did add a little of Splenda to the dressing to please my 7 year old. This is a wonderful recipe!  Will make again (and again and again....!).  Thanks for sharing this!

I made this salad for 24 ladies tripling the recipe.  It was not easy in that quantity.  I cooked the orzo the day before, refrigerated it in airtight containers and cleaned, dried and chopped the spinach the day before, placing it in paper towels and plastic containers with lids.  I also chopped, sealed and refrigerated .  the onions the night before.  The morning of the event, I roasted the pine nuts at 350 degrees for 8 minutes.  Then I assembled the entire salad according to instructions.  The only changes I made were in place of the basil, I used a dry italian herb mix and I used a Balsamic Vinaigrette. After all was assembled, I put it back into the refrigerator until lunch.  I was delighted to receive tons of compliments.  Absolutely will make this recipe again but NOT in that quantity.

I loved the idea behind this recipe, but because I did not follow it exactly, I am rating it only four stars. I did not use red onion (I used yellow, and may use less than 1/4 next time), and I also used sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts. I also cut the oil in half and used a bit more balsamic vinegar. It's a great vegetarian recipe that can easily be veganized, with either mock cheese or with the addition of a bit of nutritional yeast (when served) for that nutty flavour. I was surprised at how much this recipe yielded. I have been eating this at lunch and dinner for four days and I just ran out (and I ate about half of this).

This was ok. A bit strong on the olive oil, and overall bland. If I make this again I'd add dried cranberries for color, and perhaps chicken and/or walnuts for protein if it were going to be a "meal salad." The orzo didn't dry out well--the salad was kind of wet and seemed slimy.

Phenomenal recipe. Make half the quanitity. You will end up with a lot of this delicious recipe. Used lemon in the end and also added the feta cheese last after the refrigeration part. The feta looks better sprinkled fresh. Used fresh cilantro instead of basil. Awesome!!!

Great salad!  Followed recipe except for halving everything-realized last minute that I didn't have enough feta or pine nuts.  My husband thought it was OK, but my 16 and 20 yr old kids loved it too.  Definitely better to make in advance-flavors blend more.  Will definitely make again, and hubby can have something else-thanks for the recipe:)

We loved this salad!!!! The only thing I did differently was toast the pine nuts and did not add white pepper (simply because I did not have any). We love spinach salads so this will be made again. Daughter thought we could add sun dried tomatoes and hubby thought we could add strawberries for a variety. Thank You for sharing!

I loved this recipe!!  I added some chicken sauteed in olive oil and rosemary to make it a dinner salad.  I used flavored feta cheese (it was what I had) and left out the basil.  Delicious!

This makes A LOT of food!  A great recipe where you can adjust the amounts of each ingredient up or down according to your preference. I made this, but left out the balsamic. I then scooped out a bit and tasted it with balsamic added, and compared it with another scoop with lemon juice added instead of the balsamic. I thought the lemon juice was much better in that it let the subtle flavours of the olive oil, pine nuts, basil and feta show through more. I thought the balsamic overwhelmed the other flavours. I also replaced half of the spinach with arugula. I know many people think it's wrong to change the recipe and then give a rating, but I thought I really gave the original recipe a fair shot.

Little changes make this amazing and it fits in my 'perfect' dish catagory...quick and healthy. The second time making this I cut the oil/vinegar in half and it was perfect for us. I sauté the onions for a moment with the pine nuts (both ways are good) and add kalamata olives.

I mixed cooked orzo with some milk, added boiled shredded chicken, apple, celery, green onion, peas, bacon, spinach, tomato, shredded cheese, and various seasonings. I added a mix of ranch and mayo cuz I didn't feel like using a vinegar-based dressing. It was prob more similar to the BLT pasta salad recipe on this site, but we liked it a lot with the orzo, thanks for the inspiration!

I made this recipe exactly as posted and it was very bland and tasted like a bowl of balsamic dressing.  I won't try it again because it took too much time and ingredients to take a chance.  I wish I had listened to other reviewers in adding additional ingredients.

I made this recipe for a pot luck to serve 25+. It was fresh and fabulous. From past experience with quantities and flavors, I edited it a bit and used 1/3 the balsamic vinegar, 2/3 the oil and 1/2 the spinach called for in the recipe. I also added chopped fresh garlic and substituted some of the olive oil with a basil pesto oil. In the future I may try it with white balsamic vinegar for a nicer look and throw in some kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes. 
The recipe is relatively simple and tastes gourmet compared to a standard pasta or potato salad.

I've been lurking on allrecipes for years and have never been moved to comment before - this makes a VAT of awesome salad. I cut the dressing by a third or so and used pistachios instead of pine nuts. Good stuff!

THis was pretty good, but it made soooooo much. I had a bbq of 10 people, sent some home with my mom, ate for lunch for a week and still had to throw some out.  I also used romano cheese since I don't like feta.  Will definitely do this again, very good in the summer.

This is so delicious!  I shared with a neighbor and she also loved it and took the recipe from me.  I toasted the pine nuts to enhance their flavor.  We ate it as a side dish and also on its own for lunch.  Good stuff.

This was super delicious! I made it last weekend for a bbq and it was a big hit! Thanks Christine R. for the recipe. I've been doing a similar salad with the mini-bow tie pasta by Barilla, but I loved the orzo too.

I made this and it was tasted too strong of vinegar.  I don't know if there is a huge variation in balsamic vinegars, but it was unedible made as written.  I added 1/3 to 1/2 cup of sugar to make it edible.  Next time I would use the dressing for the Ramen slaw which would be much better than this dressing.

This recipe is a great summery side.  I made this for a bridal shower and got a lot of compliments on it.  Be aware the recipe as is makes a TON.  If I made it for a family of four, I would quarter, if not sixth it.

I really enjoyed this.  I cooked my orzo differently than instructed. For a half batch: first, I sauteed the onion in 1 T. olive oil, then added 2 1/2 c. water and 8 oz. orzo which I cooked until all the water was absorbed and the orzo was tender.  I don't know if it affected the final flavor or not, I just didn't feel like eating raw onion this time.  I tried this warm and at room temp and liked it both ways. I also used slightly less vinegar and olive oil.  I think this would be something out of the ordinary to take to a potluck.

I have used this recipe a lot and thought I'd add my "tweaks".  I use the crumbled feta with tomatoes and basil and toast the pine nuts for flavor boost.  when the orzo is done, I put the oil (1/4C) on first and toss well.  This coats the pasta and will prevent too much absorbtion of the vinegar, leading to the dreaded brown color.  I have used balsamic and red wine vinegars.  I actually like a mix.  I save the pine nuts and some fresh basil for just before serving. Enjoy!

This was a delicious salad!  I added olives, peeled and deviened shrimp, and halved grape tomatoes.   I also used a Greek dressing, instead of Balsamic, was what I had on hand!  YUMMO!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes----and it has been adored by kids and adults in my family since we first tried it.  I've made a few modifications to appeal to my family's taste and budget.  I usually add approximately 1 C. of halved grape tomatoes for added color and flavor.  The pine nuts are my favorite . . . but because of the surprisingly high cost, I usually opt to substitute the same amount of lightly salted sunflower seeds.  I imagine that pistachios would also be wonderful.  This is a fabulous recipe!

Very good.  I halved the spinach, doubled the red onion, and added sundried tomatoes.  I wouldn't say it's jawdropping, but it's very solid.

I substituted red wine vinegar for balsamic (so that my salad wouldn't be brown like others mentioned) and sunflower seeds for pine nuts (more affordable ;) and added sundried tomatoes. Instead of combining all the ingredients at once, I only combined the cooked orzo, sundried tomatoes, red onion, basil, pepper, oil and vinegar to marinate in the fridge. And, every time I wanted a serving, I would toss the marinated orzo with fresh spinach, crumbled feta, and sunflower seeds. Every serving of the salad was crunchy and flavourful, even days later. I served with pita, hummus and kalamata olives.

This is a really great recipe...I love the flavors.  I boiled my orzo in chicken broth to give it a little extra flavor, and I also squirted some lemon juice over it.

This salad was a Holiday hit! I modified it just a little, and substituted toasted Pepitas (pumpkin seeds) in place of the Pine nuts. Then I added a pint of fresh Strawberries, cut into quarters to add a pop of color and sweetness. It was refreshing and a great twist to a simple holiday salad. Everyone LOVED it!

The first time I made this I thought it was good, but could have used some "oomph" as the taste was a little bland. The second time I made it, I lightly sauteed the pine nuts and red onions together and threw it into the spinach orzo. I added fresh basil instead of dried. I also thought 1/2 cup of olive oil and balsamic vinegar was just too much, so I just added some using my own judgement. And this time it came out great! My family finished it all and wanted to know when I was going to make it again. Awesome dish! Next time I'll try sun-dried tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers.

This is an excellent pasta salad recipe. I addded chopped sundried tomatoes and fresh basil and will do so next time as well. I also toasted the pine nuts. The fresh chopped spinach is so nice in this - I will definitely make it again and again!

Delicious!  I recommend reserving 1/3 of the dressing until just before serving; the pasta absorbs some of it while it's chilling; adding the last bit before serving assures it's not dried out.  Fresh basil makes a big difference, too.  Thanks for a great recipe, Christine!

I have now made this recipe twice for family birthday bbq's.....the first time I changed it a bit by adding lots of minced green onion instead of red and some minced sundried tomatoes.....Everyone loved it but I felt it needed something. Well....I have now made it and used the recipe on the site as exact and think it has great flavour as per the recipe.

I wasn't expecting to like this, as I'm not a fan of balsamic vinegar, but I couldn't stop eating it!  I would be sure to add a little extra basil and salt(to suit personal taste).  It does need three or more hours for the flavor to fully develop.  I can't wait to make this for company.

This was OK. I could see myself making it again but I didn't LOVE it.  It made a good summer side dish with the leftovers as lunch the next day.

I made this recipe for a Super Bowl party yesterday.  What a hit!  The spinach stayed bright green and the feta added just the right kick.  I'll definately make it again.

I have been making this recipe for over a year now, and whenever I bring it somewhere everyone loves it and wants the recipe!  It is excellent!  The only thing I do differently is I only add 1/2 bag of spinach so it will be more like pasta than salad. I also dont really measure anything, I just add ingredients until I think it is perfect.  Make sure to rinse the orzo with cold water though...I forgot once and it really changed the flavor.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe...it is one of my favorites!

This is my go-to for potlucks. I usually substitute walnuts for the pine nuts, and my personal secret is to use a white basalmic vinegar.

This is one recipe that definitely didn't live up to its ratings.  I thought it was bland and flavorless.  I brought it to a party and while everyone politely helped themselves to a serving, no one came back for seconds.  I even added more balsamic vinegar, feta cheese, extra olive oil and in a desperate last-attempt for more flavor, lemon juice.  I also put in cherry tomatoes and used fresh basil as other reviewers suggested--all to no avail.  The end result is less than impressive and I don't think I'll be making this again.

This is so simple and good!  I have made several times, and make 1/2 the recipe, as it makes quite a bit.  I use fresh basil, and as others suggested, add salt & black pepper.  I use tomato & basil feta, and a 6 oz bag of spinach(as that is how it is sold). I also use slivered toasted almonds, as I don't care for pine nuts.  I do agree with some other reviewers that it isn't very "pretty" looking- Maybe I'll try cherry tomatoes or some chopped red bell pepper next time.

This is a wonderful dish. It's very light, yet very
flavorful, and with tri-color orzo it's a very colorful
dish. I cut the recipe in half, substituted walnuts
for the pine nuts, added a small can of sliced black
olives (as per another reviewer's suggestion), and
added 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt to the vinaigrette.
Truly a 5 star recipe. Highly recommended!

This is a great summertime salad. I am not so keen on raw onion, so I generally leave that out. Last time I made it, I subbed cashews for the pine nuts. I like to add a bit of fresh basil leaves in addition to the dried as well as a sliced cucumber. Some roasted chicken strips (the packages of pre-cooked work well) round out the flavors nicely, and a sliced tomato add another splash of color that makes the salad come alive! LOVE this dish. Leftovers taste even better....

YUM!  I made this last night and followed the recipe to the letter.  Everyone loved it and there is very little leftover for today.  I think I'll add some rinsed garbanzo beans and halved grape tomatoes to stretch out the little I have left.  

I'll definitely be making this again!

We really enjoy this recipe. The only changes I make is I cut down on the oil/vinegar to 1/4 cup each and I add chopped tomatoes. I also buy the feta w/garlic & herb seasoning.

Very good. I got lots of compliments. I only used 1/3c of vinegar, though, and might even use less next time.  Also, I used arugula instead of spinach.  And I also toasted the pine nuts before putting them in.  Would definately make again!

I had a friend make this recipe and it was amazing. A total hit. I decided to make this same recipe and as an amature cook as I was... I didn't toast the pine nuts. It was horrible. The recipe doesn't say to toast it but with out the pine nuts toasted, the recipe is a complete disaster. The dish is wonderful is cooked correctly... and if the recipe mentioned this one minor but dramatic cooking issue.

Good....not necessarily great.  Definitely needed some salt, and I would ramp up the pepper (I used black).

This is an amazing salad. I've made it for lots of events and there are never leftovers. I add tomatoes, green, red, yellow peppers, feta cheese, olives and half the oil called for.

I halved this recipe, as it makes quite a bit.  I also substituted toasted slivered almonds for the pine nuts and it was delicious.  I found myself going back for more again and again!  YUM!

Fantastic! My husband and I love this recipe. So much, in fact, we always fight over who gets the last bite. It's great just the way it is (with a tad less oil) or with added tomatoes and olives.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  Only thing I changed was that I substituted fresh lemon juice for the balsamic vinegar, and used a bit less olive oil.

What a great salad for an outdoor party. Served it many times and everyone raves about it. I alter it by adding sliced grape or cherry tomato halves. Adds a little color to the salad. It is absolutely delicious and I have passed on this recipe to all my friends.

My partner & I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very easy to make and tasted so fresh.  Since I only had dry basil, I added some fresh flat-leaf parsley, which really gave it some zip.  It even tasted great the next day!

Loved this salad!  Next time will put in even more spinach.  It is an unusual side dish and lends itself to making some interesting additions (olives, artichoke hearts, etc.)  I'll be making this often.

Excellent recipe. This made tons of salad and I even cut the orzo down to half. Next time, I will add more feta and try the fresh basil. Tasted great the next day.

excellent! I reduced the spinach and the feta the first time I made it becuase I did not have enough, and it was delicious.  The second time I used the listed quantities and it was just as good.

Very yummy. Was a hit at our craft group lunch. Requests for recipe and to bring again. Found that half the dressing was perfect so mixed 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar with full amount of spices. Added Kalamata olives. Next time will add artichokes and cherry tomatoes also. This is a great salad.

I have made this 4 or 5 times now.  It has become my favorite summer salad dish!  I have also used walnuts or sliced almonds when I haven't had pine nuts on hand - just as good.

Replaced some of the vinegar with lemon juice. Used fresh basil, and cherry tomatoes. Sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts. This was tasty, not bland. Would make it again.

I made this 3 times trying to perfect it for a large event we host every year. I followed the recipe except I used sliced almonds rather than pine nuts to save money. We toasted the almonds, which added a really nice flavor! The day before serving we made the orzo, added the oil, vinegar, spices and onions. That allowed the flavors to meld very nicely! It also allowed all the vinegar to soak in so that it would not turn the feta down. A few hours before serving, we added the almonds, feta and the spinach, which we cut into strips rather than chopped. Fantastic recipe!

The recipe as is was bland, so I decided to tweak it a tiny bit.  The changes were very minor, but they were just enough to make it a big hit with my picky eaters.  I used the basic recipe then added bacon bits and used Newman's Own Olive Oil and Vinegar salad dressing instead of olive oil and Balsamic vinegar.  The spices and herbs in the Newman's Own dressing along with the bacon kicked up the flavor significantly.  I think next time I make it I will also add some black olives for even more flavor.

I am not sure what went wrong, but I had way too much pasta. It looked more like a pasta salad with a touch of spinach, instead of the other way around. Next time I will add much less orzo.

This was good (and yields a ton) but I should have known there'd be trouble when I saw it called for *equal parts* balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

The balsamic came on way too strong, to the point where it even discolored all of the pasta.  I'd recommend cutting the balsamic vinegar to 1/4 cup, and keeping the olive oil at 1/2.

I also used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta.  Pretty great stuff.

YUM! I've made this twice now, and omitted the feta (by accident) the second time. I didn't miss it at all, so maybe those looking to save a few calories could omit it? With or without it, it's a super fast, tasty salad, perfect for a light addition to a summer dinner, or maybe as an entree with some chicken or tuna added.  It's so yummy, I could eat half the salad out of the bowl, tho it is better after it sits a while. This is a definite keeper. Thanks again, AR community, for the recipe and helpful reviews.

This is a great go-to, make ahead dish.  I always add whatever sounds good--or is in the pantry--at the time...often sundried tomatoes, always artichoke hearts, sometimes black olives.  Substitute sunflower seeds for tree nuts to avoid allergy issues.

I found the whole pkg of orzo was too much, unless it's the main course. But, what great flavor and you can add anything else you like.

love this! Used half of the olive oil; white balsamic vinegar; fresh basil plus dried basil ; dried oregano; halved cherry tomatoes for color. This is wonderful with pine nuts but also great with toasted slivered almonds.

LOVE this salad.  served as a side dish.  I modified it accidentally, but it was a happy accident - doubled the spinach and added a chopped yellow pepper.  and therefore needed a bit more balsamic vinegar.  fantastic and several
guests wanted this recipe

It didn't seem to have enough dressing flavor to it.  We added more of the balsamic vinegar for our taste but it was still nothing I would make again.

Tasty and easy. I halved it and still had lots of leftovers. Stuck pretty close to recipe...added some red and yellow bell peppers and I make a "creamy vinaigrette" by mixing in some jalapeño ranch with the oil and vinegar. Also topped with some spicy grilled shrimp to make it a meal.

This is a really versatile recipe that largely depends on the quality of balsamic vinegar you use. I put whatever veggies i could find in my fridge into this salad and it just all turned out really good. The next day i added a can of salmon for a healthy and delicious lunch.

Love this recipe as a good base for a spinach salad. Was delicious. My substitutions are not intended as critical of the chef but rather we have milk allergies and had to improvise with what we had (too lazy to go to the store). Ofc, the feta had to go because it's dairy, and we didn't have pine nuts so used the same amount of raw filberts (hazelnuts). Used a few leaves of our fresh basil torn into the spinach base. Instead of white pepper used black, and on a whim, used about half of a medium fresh orange squeezed over the salad, then tossed. Love the flavors and the healthy ingredients!

This was really good. Easy and makes a nice side dish. I don't care for balsamic vinegar so I used tarragon vinegar and a little less than called for. It was a nice change from a tossed salad. Try it you'll love it

This was really great!  As other reviewers have said, it makes a ton...so consider halving or quartering the recipe.  Also, I toasted the pine nuts before adding them to the recipe.  Very yummy!!!

I was looking for a different salad to take to a picnic and was tired of making pasta salad. This was a wonderful salad and everyone liked it. It even tasted good the next day. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this last night. Wow, was it ever tasty! I did as a reviewer suggested and threw in some halved cherry tomatos and used fresh basil...what a lovely fresh tasty salad!!!! This would be an excellent summer pot luck salad to bring, it feeds a crowd. Don't be like me and be tempted to omit the pine nuts though (they are sooo expensive), I did end up putting them in and they add a very nice (occasional)crunch to the salad.

Delicious!! Substituted slivered almonds for pine nuts and omitted feta. Just eyeballed adding the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, I think it was a lot less than called for in recipe.

I've made a version of this salad before but couldn't find that recipe so used this. I agree with jennaucla that it is bland. However a few more splashes of balsamic vinegar perked it right up. I love the texture of orzo. With a few tweaks its a keeper.  Sue H.

We really liked this but thought there was way too much orzo for the rest of the ingredients.  I think cutting the pasta in half would be fine. Also, we added a bit more feta and a little garlic.  It was really satisfying and tasty.

I substituted cotija cheese for the feta for a sharper taste. Added grape tomatoes, and whole black olives. Used slivered almonds that I toasted and used a pomegranate infused balsamic vinegar that was wonderful!! Great recipe! Makes a lot but great as leftovers!

I made and took this to a surprise anniversary party without ever having tried it first.  Based on the combination of ingredients and reviews I was confident it would taste good.  It was a huge hit and several people asked for the recipe.  Changes I made: red onions can overpower so I used half a red and half a yellow onion.  I also added some grape tomatoes, cut in half for a touch of color.  The balsamic vinegar is a must and be sure to toast the pine nuts well for better flavor.

Yummy!  For those who dislike the strong flavor or the 'browning' of the pasta with the brown balsamic vinegar, use white balsamic vinegar.  It has a slightly milder and sweeter taste, although I find it subtle. I have also used balsamic vinaigrette dressing in a pinch.

A nice change.  6 oz of spinach was plenty (bundled the spinach leaves and diced into thin strips.) Added about half cup of chopped dried cranberries and used blackberry balsamic vinegar.  Very good.

Great base recipe....needs some modifications, since proportions are not adequate as is.  Have made this with 1/4 of the ingredients, except needed the same amounts of onion, oil and vinegar. I actually premixed the dressing and have also used raspberry vinegar instead since I ran out of balsamic...both are good.  I add some sugar too to the dressing. Also added some green pepper and goat cheese rather than feta.  I preferred the goat cheese, but that is just my taste. Change all you want...still a good idea with different ingredients than most salads. Makes ALOT of salad, which is why unless I have a crowd I only use 1/4 or 1/2 a recipe, since I don't like the spinach too wilted. Arugula is my next additive when it's ready in the garden! Thanks!

I made this for a retirement party and the friend next to me said, "I understand you made this; I want the recipe! The amount was rather large but it was almost gone at the end of the 2 hour party. It's a great refreshing summer salad. I cooked the orzo the night before, added the other ingredients the next afternoon and dressed it an hour before the "vultures" descended. I added more dried basil than it called for but I think I will add even more next time or use fresh.

It was terrific, but I modified a few things. Instead of using pine nuts, I added garbanzo beans. I also added in about 2 tablespoon of ground cumin (or to taste) which I think gives it a very nice aroma and taste.  I replaced the dried basil for fresh finely chopped cilantro. Then I added very little salt to taste. Last thing I want to say is the strong smell of balsamic vinegar goes away after refrigerating it for several hours.

This salad was great!  I used only half the amount of olive oil and balsamic and it was more than enough dressing for our family.  Also didn't have pine nuts so substituted with chopped almonds which worked just fine.  My entire family raved about this (including two 5-year-olds)!

Very good.  I made a triple batch, definately added more spice and a few modifications from other reviewers; sundried tomatoes, cucumber, diced orange bell pepper.  Also, added sugar and minced garlic to the vinegarette.  My husband raved about it.  I can't wait to serve it tomorrow.

This is just the recipe I've been looking for. I didn't change a thing except I cut it in half because there were only four of us. As good as the Orzo and Spinach deli salads I've had - but so much fresher. The family agrees - for us this is a 5!

OH YUM!  I made this for 4th of July without doing a test-run first but this turned out FANTASTIC.  I didn't want a mayo-based salad because of the heat wave we're experiencing and this fit the bill.  I only used about 5 oz. of the spinach leaves and I used about 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil instead of dried.  I skipped the pine nuts because they were insanely expensive but I added an 8.5 oz jar or sundried tomatoes - and this MADE the salad, we thought!.  I used some minced onion instead of the fresh and added about 2 T. Dijon mustard and 3 T. minced garlic to the dressing.  Couldn't stop eating this - thanks for the recipe!!!!

I tried this recipe for a mothers day picnic; everyone thought it was OK, nothing exciting. I personally think it is bland; I had to add some sea salt to it. I probably won't create this again.

Wonderful filling salad that everyone loves.  They have even eaten it as a main meal as it has everything in it.  I use slivered almonds toasted instead of pine nuts which cuts the cost and gives it another added flavor and texture.

I ran across this recipe looking for something healthy and this has got to be one of my favorites.  I love all the flavors and can be very healthy if you use low fat feta cheese.  I made the full recipe for myself one weekend to try it out.  It was gone by Sunday!  I've made it three more times since then and I still love it!

Really good! I omitted the pine nuts and added black olives, a large diced tomato, and a small can of corn. Loved the spinach idea to keep it fresh and healthy. For the dressing, I only used 1/4 cup of EEOO with the half cup of balsamic vinegar and the juice of half a lemon. I added a small garlic clove to the dressing.  Tasted better after it became very cold, so be sure to refrigerate it several hours before seving.  Makes a lot! Great for potlucks.

I looked at the combination of ingredients and went 'huh?' But the reviews were so good so I gave it a try. What a pleasant surprise! I couldn't wait to have it again for breakfast the next morning. It does make a LOT! Two recommendations: Use a GOOD quality balsamic and reduce onions! I did but will reduce even a bit more next time. Perhaps Green onion might be even better.

This was good and I will definitely try it again... I did not have any basil, but fresh basil would be delicious! I did halved the recipe and added 1/2 lemon juiced, 1 clove of garlic and I doubled the amount of feta. Tomatoes would also be good in this.  I used less olive oil than it called for.

After spending WAY too much money on buying Orzo salad and it not lasting very long, I decided to make my own.  I followed this recipe and my husband cannot stop saying how much he loves it!  He loves balsamic vinegar so he doesn't think that this recipes is overpowered by it, but if I make it for friends, I think I'm going to only use 1/4 c. of balsamic vinegar.  After reading previous reviews, I also added black olives and sundried tomatoes!  GREAT recipe that is perfect for picnics- makes a lot!

This is a great side dish and gets better in the fridge after a day. If you make it often, mix up the cheese (something sharp) in future iterations for a new flavor combo. Added olives. It is not too powerful, working perfectly as a complementary dish to a main meal.

I was really excited to try this and made it for a family cookout.  With the exception of using chicken broth to cook the orzo I made it exactly as stated.  It was horribly bland!  I tried adding halved cherry tomatoes,  a jar of sun dried tomatoes, garlic, lemon juice, salt, more basil, a Tbsp of sun dried tomato pesto and more pepper.  It still really lacked flavor.  I am really sorry - I tried to like it.  Not one person out of 20 complimented it and there was a lot left over!

This was the first time I had orzo, and I loved the texture of it. I also added some dried cranberries and sliced sun-dried tomatoes, used ground black pepper (instead of white) and omitted the spinach (I didn't have any). Quite good, but I found the balsamic vinegar to be a little overpowering. I will probably make again with a tad less balsamic vinegar.

EXCELLENT. Adults & children loved this recipe. Changes I made were: 1.) Chopped the spinach in the food processor - this makes it very fine (probably why the children had no problem eating spinach). 2.) Used sunflower seeds in place of pine nuts. 3.) Used approx. 1/3C of fresh basil. 4.) Added 1 small container of cherry tomatoes cut in half. 5.) Used feta with tomatoe and basil. I combined all ingredients except the tomatoes & dressing ahead of time & just prior to serving, added the dressing & tomatoes.

Oh-so-yummy! I halved this recipe and then used slightly less olive oil and added sundried tomatoes, but otherwise I made as directed. Great flavors that complemented the lamb roast I served with it. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This is a very good & simple recipe. I did leave out the balsamic vinegar (don't like) and added some cooked chicken. Be warned, this makes a BIG bowl of salad.

This was a lovely and easy recipe.  I added all of the ingredients but pine nuts which I replaced with silvered almonds and the crunch was great.  I can see this being great with cucumber and tomato.

i added chicken to the recipe and ate it warm. My boyfriend tasted it and didn't want another bite. I wasn't too crazy about it either. I wouldn't use the white pepper. I'm Chinese and we use white pepper in our dishes, i didn't think it went well with this one. Skip it and use black pepper. Also cut oil and balsamic vinegar in half.

Great recipe, easy, popular at a potluck, healthy.  I wouldn't say it has a completely knockout taste, so I'm holding back on a 5* (although I would definitely make again).

Fabulous!  Made exactly as the recipe stated, took to a cookout and everyone asked me for the recipe. Made the day before to let the flavors blend - definitely better the 2nd (and 3rd) day.

Wonderful salad!  Couldn't get enough of it.  It makes a fairly large amount though so next time I think I would halve it.

My friend made this recipe for a party.  It was very good; just enough dressing to coat, but not overpower, the ingredients.  I would toast the pine nuts if I made it; it crisps them a bit and intensifies the flavor so you don't need as many.  I'd probably use more spinach, too.

This really makes ALOT of pasta salad.  Unless cooking for a party, I plan on only making 1/2 the recipe from now on.  I added the spinach while the pasta was still warm to wilt it, then added everything but the cheese.  I didn't want that to melt so I only added that once the salad was chilled.  Really wish I listened to other reviewers and added kalamata olives - they would have been a great addition.

Great potluck recipe! Makes more than 8 servings, I'd say more like 10 servings.  Needs ~1 tsp salt as well as fresh ground black pepper.  Added artichoke hearts and olives as per others' suggestion.  Used less oil and vinegar (maybe cut down by 25%). Would be great vehicle for other veggies as well (blanched broccoli, zucchini, etc.).

I was really excited to try this since it had such a high rating but was extremely disappointed! I am glad I only made half (which is still a lot). I followed the recipe exactly and thought that it was too bland. I am thinking that people are rating the recipe as to how they modify it? I don't know but I will not make this again!

This is an excellent base recipe! I threw in olives, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes and used a lot less oil/vinegar- it was delicious hot or cold. It's really hard to mess this recipe up.

This salad is fantastic - even without the pine nuts which are a little pricey for our budget.  We tend to add grape tomatoes and lots of feta too.  It's good the next day too, though the spinach is more wilted.  When we travel with it, we keep the orzo and dressing separate from the veggies and mix upon arrival.

This was a great salad that I made several times in the summer as an alternative to potato salad at gatherings.  It's light and mediterranean taste made my husband and I feel like we were in Greece every time we made it!  The more feta cheese, the better.

My husband l-o-v-e-d this recipe ("dinner from heaven"); there's just something addicting about it!  I loved it for its change of pace vs. the ordinary side dish fare.  I only used a 1/2 pkg of spinach, which was plenty and subbed pine nuts for walnuts and parm for feta.  Delish!

I made this recipe for a company pot luck and it was a huge success.  Several people asked me for the recipe, which I happily passed on.  I doubled the recipe, due to the large crowd, except for the amount of spinach.  I ended up using the large family size bag of baby spinach and there was plenty.  I will make this again...thanks for the recipe.

I really liked the flavor the balsamic/olive oil dressing gave to this salad. I used fresh basil and toasted the pine nuts. Thank you for sharing.

My husband, friends, and I all loved this.  I chopped the spinach and onions extremely fine (onions in the food processor), and used tomato basil flavored feta (and used extra feta) which was great.  This is a perfect summer snack that's refreshing and full of flavor.

This is delicious!  I made it for my son's birthday party and everyone LOVED it.  I roasted the pine nuts -- 350 for 10 min -- and that gave it another layer of flavors. Next time I will add more feta, but if you don't love feta (as we do), its fine as is.  Its a keeper!

I added chopped sun dried tomatoes (the kind packed in oil) and replaced some of the oil with the oil from the tomatoes and it was fabulous!

I had most of these ingredients lying around and needed a quick side dish. It really worked out for the best. I omitted the onion and white pepper. I toasted the pine nuts and basically scaled back everything. So the ratios are pretty flexible. Just mix until it feels right. But it's delicious!

Fiance liked this!  He's not big on oily or creamy sauces for pasta salads and he gave this a thumbs up!  I felt it was a bit too much pasta though.

Excellent salad!  Has turned into my standard potluck dish and people always reach for seconds, thirds, and fourths.  I consider the pine nuts optional as the salad is just fine without them, but consider the orzo to be a must-have -- the salad is just not the same with any other type of pasta.  Light, flavorful, delicious, and attractive.

Good recipe.  I shredded spinach in food processor & is much prettier-makes orzo appear green.  Personally, you can use less than 1/2 the spinach & still tastes & looks the same w/o being so "soggy" or tough on your stomach.

Wow!  Be sure to let this salad chill for 8 hours before serving.  It makes all the difference in the blending of flavors.  My only changes were to add halved Kalmata olives and to toast the pine nuts.  I was also a couple of tablespoons short on the balsamic vinegar, so I added garlic vinegar to make up the difference.  This was really a wonderful dish!

Great recipe.  I always receive compliments and requests for this recipe each time I make it.  Best when made the night before. I don't add all of the olive oil when first making it.  I toss with some more vinegar and the remaining olive oil right before serving.  I add grade tomatoes  halved and toast the pine nuts as well.

Very good...  used a different pasta than orzo because I wanted a bigger-sized pasta.  Also added halved grape tomatoes and some dried cranberries.  Great summer side... or add grilled chicken for a main dish!

This is an excellent base recipe.  I added chopped artichoke hearts, sliced olives, fresh basil, and halved grape tomatoes.  I second the folks that mentioned the huge amount this recipe makes -- I'll halve this recipe next time and it'll still last me a week of lunches.

Oh, was this GOOD!!  I made it for a baseball playoffs potluck and everybody took seconds, if not thirds.  I took someone's advice and added cherry tomatoes for a splash of color.  Definitely goanna make this regularly!

I was pretty dubious about this recipe - in fact, so dubious that I decided to use ordinary corkscrew pasta instead of orzo.  I also left out the onion, which is not too popular in my household, and used up some leftover sliced black olives instead.  The salad was light and easy to make, and had a great flavour.  My boyfriend, who hates raw spinach, says that it's the best salad I've ever made, and I've tried out several from this website.

This came out just ok for me.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I followed the recipe- even adding fresh basil as suggested.  Maybe it was the orzo that scared everyone off- who knows?  Not many tried it and the ones who did didn't say anything- usually not a good sign.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

This is a great salad! I served it to a group of friends and everyone loved it. The only change I made was to cut back slightly on the spinach - it just seemed like too much to me. Make sure you use a very good quality olive oil and vinegar. It's a huge recipe - next time I will probably cut it in half.

A great recipie, very easy to make, and tastes wonderful.  The only changes I have made are to use frozen spinach, that has been defrosted and squeezed dry, then shredded.  
Also try using the flavoured feta cheeses, like garlic and cumin.  Also try fresh basil, and I have used a gourmet basil that has a hint of lemon to it, that also worked well.

MUY BUENO!!! All of my family loved it, including my way picky little sis. However, I doubled the pine nuts and decreased the spinach by 2. (i like crunch more than veggies) I also did not tear the spinach up cuz it looked so pretty. This salad rocks!!! I'm an orzo believer!!! (be ready for people to be like "ok is this rice? pasta? couscous???")

This is a great side dish! Makes a nice amount with leftovers. Lucky me! So very easy to make. I did use fresh basil, but otherwise followed this to a 'T'!

Very tasty.  I made it for a special birthday dinner.  Everyone was a bit shy about trying it, but once they did it was a hit.

I have made this several times. Excellent!  If you have a white balsamic vinegar available use it.  The dark makes the orzo brown..still tastss good but less visually appealing. I always get asked for this recipe...a keeper!

Super easy and rave reviews. I made a large amount for potluck, using about 10oz orzo and 16oz bag of spinach, about 10oz feta, small amount of onion, sliced almonds, and a 16oz bottle of Kraft balsamic salad dressing.

Excellent and very easy recipe! Everybody loved it. I did swap out black olives for the pine nuts & added some lemon juice & salt to the dressing. I served the feta cheese on the side. When I ate the leftovers the next day, it was not as good.

I loved this. Cut the recipe in half. Two of us had plenty  for lunch and leftover for the next day. We enjoyed the flavors, texture and the warmth of the spinach and orzo.
In all, it was wonderful.

It was really bland with just 1/2 cup balsamic, and 1/2 cup olive oil. I ended up using 1 1/2 cups of each, and it was a lot better. I also added kalamata olives (soaked in olive oil not water), and black pepper to taste. Everyone loved it!

This salad was a big hit for my family. I try to make full course salads for our concert at the park nights.  This is lacking much protein (feta cheese notwithstanding), so instead we brought along some salami to slice.  I made the recipe as written but  added juice from a lemon (about 2 TBs) and about 1/2 cup sliced cherry tomatoes and 1/2 cup sliced kalamata olives.  I tried it before adding these things and found it to have too much oil/vinegar, so the lemon seemed to neutralize that. With these additions it was fabulous!

In the summer months, I live on recipes like this one.   I did add fresh basil from the herb garden and think it gave the salad an added flavor boost.   So easy to make -- don't leave out those pine nuts!

Lovely salad.   I took it to a pot luck and it was very popular!I used fresh basil from the garden.  I would maybe cut back on dressing just a bit next time.  I can’t eat raw onions, so I just left them off.   Added capers.

I love this recipe.  Now that my daughter is celiac and can’t have orzo (gluten) I make it with quinoa and it’s just as good and has more protein.  I also add cherry tomatoes and if I have artichokes hearts, I add those too. Such a perfect salad for a summer day!

I love it and have made it several times and have shared the recipe.  I use feta cheese from a cow as I do not like goat feta.  I add a little more oil and vinegar.  I up the white pepper to ½ teaspoon.

I have made this recipe many times and it never disappoints.  This is the perfect salad to take to a BBQ because you don't have to worry about it sitting out in the sun and to make it a meal, you can add cooked shrimp or grilled chicken to it.   If you like feta cheese, you'll probably love this recipe.

As previously stated, it made way more than expected and I ate it for 5 days, but it did taste good and,actually, stayed fairly intact. As the days went on, it needed more balsamic vinegar as much had been absorbed by the orzo.

Love this! The only changes I made were omitting the red onion and toasting the pine nuts (HIGHLY recommend). If you make it ahead or expect to have any leftovers you might want to sprinkle the pine nuts on as you serve it because they do get a little soggy after a while. I've also made this substituting crumbled goat cheese instead of feta, which was also excellent.

Excellent salad for weekday lunches or a barbecue.  I cut back a bit on both the oil and balsamic, and added ground black pepper and a bit of salt.   Very satisfying.

I have been making this salad for years now. It’s one of my favorites and many people ask for the recipe. I reduce the orzo to make it more spinach forward, but if you want a pasta salad the full amount of orzo is delicious. I also add chopped sun dried tomatoes in olive oil. I have subbed Champaign vinegar when I didn’t have balsamic and it was good, but balsamic is best. It lasts for a few days in the fridge. Enjoy!

I made it without the pine nuts,(too expensive) and it was fine. Put in plastic bag for camping and the longer it sits,the better. I added fresh lemon for a bit of zing. It was a hit with all 'us' tree huggers!!

The dressing in this recipe was very bland.  No flavor.  Needs more tang.  I doubled the amount of feta cheese and it tasted better.  I'm just comparing to the same salad made popular by my local NYC Italian delicatessen.

This is a simple, versatile recipe that friends ask me to make again and again. It makes a huge amount and perfect when you have to “bring something”. I’ve done so many things with it: added extras (artichokes, mushrooms, olives, chicken breast) and/or subbed goat cheese for feta and made it vegan by leaving out the cheese.

This is a regular go-to for me for lunches. I sometimes add chicken or sliced turkey lunch meat to increase the protein. I also sometimes leave out the orzo if I want to cut out carbs. Way delicious.

I have made this many times now and it is one of my favorites. I make it just as the recipe says. It makes a large amount. I eat it the next day and I like it just as much.

Easy and delicious.  I used sun dried tomatoes and skipped on the onion.  Key is to put in the Spinach after it cools.  This lasted in the refrigerator for 4 days and was still fresh.  Oh, and I did half the recipe and had enough for 6-8 persons.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and it is delicious as it!  If making ahead of time, add only half the dressing when making, then the other half before serving. One time, instead of basalmic, I used the juice of one lemon, and added enough spiced rice vinegar to make up the difference. Also very good, and visually pleasing.

Great taste..I followed the recipe, but also added marinated artichoke hearts and Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  Also, I mixed a little 'milder' Italian dressing  with the oil and vinegar. This is a LOT of salad, but it keeps well.

This was a big hit with the family. I followed the recipe, but added shredded rotisserie chicken to make it a meal. Wonderful! If you're looking for an easy and fresh summer dinner, this is a great choice! One note -- much of the flavor is due to the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Be sure to use good brands of both!

I made this for a summer barbeque, and it was a big hit.  It's worth mentioning that one can avoid discoloration by using white balsamic vinegar.

I have made this several times now.  It has become a family favorite.  I make it without the onions and add diced tomatoes instead.  We include a protein and serve it as a complete meal.  Shrimp is the favorite.  We've also used grilled chicken breast and smoked salmon.

This salad. I discovered it a few years ago and it immediately became a regular recipe. If you like all the ingredients, you will love all the flavors when they come together. Probably my favorite recipe I've discovered from Allrecipes! Sometimes I add sundried tomatoes or dried cranberries/cherries depending on my mood. No matter what, always delicious!

This was delicious! I loved the texture and flavor. It is a huge salad so I made it about 1/4 the size. I added some grape tomatoes and a squeeze of fresh lemon but changed nothing else. I will definitely make this again.

I love orzo salad.  You can't go wrong no matter what you put into it.  I halved the EVOO and vinegar and used 3 ounces of baby spinach chopping and wilting it as others suggested and as I prefer mine less spinach intensive.  Added sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, one Persian cucumber, cherry tomatoes, black olives, and used fresh herbs.  I am eating it as I write this but am looking forward to the flavors melding overnight.  BTW, those stating the orzo turns brown was a bit of an exaggeration.  Yes, it does darken the orzo, but it's not off putting.  Thanks for the recipe and everyone's input in the reviews as they gave me good ideas.

Because I did not have regular balsamic vinegar or olive oil, I used my dark chocolate balsamic and grapeseed oil.  I would personally add more feta and a little less oil.  I'm making it again this week and will add kalamata olives.  The pine nuts are a wonderful addition!   A very wonderful summer recipe!

Be sure to rinse pasta in cold water. I used white balsamic in the dressing. I added the 1/2 the dressing to the pasta first and let it soak in. I then added all the other ingredients and put in the fridge. I also added salt and pepper to the dressing. I will then add more dressing if it needs it after chilling. I might add  cherry tomatoes.

It was a good salad but next time I will toast the orzo and pine nuts with olive oil first, then add water and cook them. I believe this will add what's missing in flavor here.

It was pretty heavy on the vinegar. My family still really liked it, but I'd half the vinegar next time. Also, I didn't have pine nuts, but I added some grape tomato halves for flavor. Very yummy. Will definitely keep this addition.

Big fan!!   I find that toasting the pinenuts and throwing them in in the last hour or so before serving really adds a nice crunch.  Great salad!

I made this for our book club. It was a great success. I toasted the pine nuts, cut back on the red onions and served it with grilled chicken. Very tasty!

The ratio of pasta was way too high.  I only put 1/3 of the pasta in it and it was still too much.  Seemed more like a pasta salad than a healthy green salad.  It was still good though.  I added some other things like tomatoes and slivered almonds.  This recipe, as written, is a starting base for a salad - just use less pasta.

I followed the proportions and found too much orzo. Otherwise, it was perfect. I used this for a "groom's" shower (potluck picnic) and I did not toss and dress it until I wanted to serve it. Nothing browned and everything got eaten quickly. Definitely will use this recipe again! Simple...

This was so good on a 90 degree day! The only change I made was to leave out the pine nuts because of an allergy . I scaled down the orzo because there are only two of us but it was wonderful!

This salad was so easy to make and the flavors did not overpower each other.  I did add extra Feta cheese only because I love it so much.  It can be easily adapted to suit your tastes.  It was a winner for me.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Yum. Can serve hot or cold. Out of pine nuts so used sliced almonds. Less oil and vinegar. Added thin carrot slices, mushroom, olives, and lemon juice. Could do anything with this base to match your dish. It's a keeper.

This salad was AMAZING!!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  But I have to tell you it makes A LOT!  I think the serving side is if you are serving as an entree.  I made is as a side salad with Cilantro Lime Grilled Chicken (on this site also 5 stars!) for 6 people and we ate a lot of it and had more than half left over!  I substituted slivered almonds for the pine nuts ad added cherry tomatoes for more flavor and color!  I did as another reviewer suggested and mixed ALL ingredients EXCEPT the spinach, and also used the white balsamic vinegar.  I added spinach just before serving.  I ate leftovers the next day and it was still delicious!   I will make this again and again!  It is almost identical  to an orzo spinach I had at a high end restaurant!

I toasted the pine nuts and added some olives and tomatoes for a more Greek feel. Additionally I used Macedonian feta which was very creamy. Made a TON of leftovers, superb recipe!

Made this salad last night for my family.  I halved the recipe because there were only 3 of us.   I made a Quiche as the main dish and the two paired together went very nice together.  My daughter complained that there were too many onions in the salad so the next time I make it, I will ease up on the onions. My husband couldn't stop complimenting me on it and ate the little we had leftover in the bowl.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!  I don't love balsamic vinegar, but in this recipe, it added just the right subtle flavor.  I left out the feta because my son doesn't like it, but I think it would have been overwhelmed the other ingredients.

Stores well and very good a few days later

I just finished making this recipe for a potluck at work later today. It was easy to make! I usually follow a recipe to a tee the first time I make it, but this time I didn't add the entire bag of spinach because I felt as if it was too much. I didn't have white pepper, so I used  cracked black. I added the sundries tomatoes, too.  It looks yummy!

This is a terrific recipe.  Not quite foodie quality, but the perfect mix of easy and delicious.  We chop the spinach more coarsely (like the photo) and it works well.  We also typically make 1/2 recipe which is plenty for 4-6 people.  We also use fresh ground pepper instead of white pepper.

This makes a huge batch!  First time I made it for a group, I increased it by 1/2, and even though everyone liked it, we had lots of leftovers.  This is my new go-to recipe for potlucks or anywhere I have to bring something.  Super easy and everyone loves it.

Very good for a crowd. A few more splashes of balsamic did the trick otherwise the proportions were right on. Used walnuts instead of pine nuts as that's what was on hand and added chopped jicama for added crunch. It was a little too much for hubby and I so it'll be around for a while, a long while.

A very mild flavor.  Probably best alongside some really heavily spiced dishes.  I wanted to really like it, but just felt like it turned out so-so.

I loved it!  Great side dish, had it with chicken and salmon.  I thought the pine nuts gave it a nice crunchy addition.  Even if you are not a huge spinach fan, you might like this recipe, and it's a great way to get your iron!

One of our favorite salads - I usually add tomatoes, and have played around with different vinegar flavors. It usually gets good feedback from guests (if they like feta!)

Awesome salad....Used goat cheese instead of feta, almonds instead of pine nuts, and added some black olives.  No measuring...just eyeballed the ingredients and was able to throw this together nice and quick.  Very tasty.

Good flavors. I toasted the pine nuts first and added Kalamata olives. I also used gluten free orzo. Sometimes the gluten free pastas do not work well in pasta salads or anything leftover for that matter, but the orzo worked out nicely and absorbed the flavors of the dressing in this one.

This is a great recipe! I have found that I don't need to use as much spinach as the recipe calls for. (About 6-7 oz.) it doesn't matter if you use black pepper instead of white either. I think it is better to use fresh basil if possible. Delicious!

This is just wonderful. Subbed chick peas for pine nuts since hubs doesn't like em and to add enough protein to make it a meal.  Chicken would be good too!

Delicious! Because I had it on hand, added sun-dried tomatoes and used toasted almonds as I was out of pine nuts. Shared with the neighbor, who loved it as well! Leftovers today - YUM! Thanks Christine!

This is so delicious and easy. We got so excited after tasting it with just the balsamic and olive oil that we forgot to add the basil and white pepper. I think the white pepper would be a nice addition. Lightly sauteed some chopped tomato and yellow onion (instead of the red) tossed it in as well.  Loved it warm, would probably love it cold as well.

This is an absolute favorite for my husband and I.  I've made it for several parties and it is always a hit.  I am not a huge fan of balsamic but the combination of ingrediants in this recipe are fantastic.

This is a good base recipe & can be easily flexed to suit your needs. I used only half of the cooked Orzo, as I wanted it to be more of a salad versus a pasta side dish. Chopped the spinach leaves using kitchen shears & subbed toasted almond slices for pine nuts (hubs & kids hate pine nuts). Served salad dry with olive oil & balsamic cruets on the side.The prepared salad without dressing stores well in the fridge.  Leftover salad made a DELICIOUS healthy meal the next day by adding grilled Key West chicken strips (also on this site) over the top. Anytime I can get my kids to knowingly & happily eat vegetables is a SMASHING success in my book. Try this recipe & tweak to your liking...you really cannot go wrong!

I added a few more ingredients to this salad: artichokes, black olives and cherry tomotoess.  It was a beautiful salad until I added the balsamic vinegar.  In addition to turning this bright salad brown, it overpowered all of the other tastes and I only used HALF of what the recipe called for.  If you love balsamic, use half.  If you don't love a vinegary tasting salad, skip this recipee or use another dressing.

Delicious!! I added a couple of things but kept the base recipe.  I added quartered cherry tomatoes, chopped black olives, and instead of feta, I used cubed provolone.  I also toasted the pine nuts as another reviewer recommended...yummy!

With some revisions this is a 5 star recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  As a side dish this serves 10 to 12.  I halved the dressing recipe and added some minced garlic.  I reduced the amount of red onion.  I like to soak slices in cold water for awhile to take out some of the sharpness.  Then drain and chop.  Lightly toast the pine nuts.  I added some drained chopped marinated artichokes.  If serving as a main dish, I will add cooked chicken.  I think grape tomatoes and kalamata olives would be good too.  After draining and rinsing the orzo, I spread it on a cookie to dry before combining all the ingredients.

I made this for a weekend get-together lunch with friends. I thought it was pretty good, but not quite a five-star recipe. My friends said they liked it too. I made it exactly as written, and should note that the recipe makes a lot of salad - those "8 servings" are pretty big, in my opinion.

This is a crowd pleaser...I take it every year to a wine tasting potluck and no matter what meat the host chooses to serve- this pairs perfectly.  It's also nice because you can serve it cool to room temp so it keeps on the counter for awhile for slow eaters or long potlucks.  Yum!

I did as other suggested and added artichoke hearts & klamata olives. Also had a yellow bell pepper I needed to use up so I threw that in there. I did reduce the amount of oil & vinegar. Husband loved it & asked next time to serve it warm

I made this for a luncheon with chicken pesto panini and fruit salad and it was GREAT! Only used a 1/4c oil. It made a huge portion, but I ate it basically breakfast lunch and dinner until it was gone. The next day I had to add more dressing as it has absorbed it all and gotten bland. Very pretty, too!

I made this for Superbowl Sunday to rave reviews.  I followed the recipe as above but added a few extra items:  Kalamata Olives, Artichoke hearts and some extra balsamic for a little more zing.  As previously reviewed, this salad makes a lot but I am happy to report, it held up great for an extra two days after I made it so that leftovers could be consumed.  I am sharing this recipe with all my party attendees!

I use a store bought Balsamic vinaigrette to save time.  We also use toasted almond slivers instead of pine nuts.  Everyone enjoys this salad.

Added some artichoke hearts (hearts of palm would have been awesome too) & toasted the pine nuts a bit, but otherwise it would have been fantastic as written.  My dinner guest LOVED it.  It makes a huge serving, so if you're cooking for two & don't want leftovers, I suggest cutting it in half.  I'll totally make this again.  Thanks for posting it!

This is absolutely delicious as a side dish.  My husband & I love greek salads when we go out for dinnner, so this was right up our alley.  I think it would be just as good served warm with grilled chicken.  And talk about easy!  So happy I gave this a try.  Thanks so much for an awesome recipe.

Excellent, easy and tastey! I added grape tomatoes, cucumber and red/yellow peppers, cut the oil and vinegar in half. Great for a large party.

followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1 jar of sun-dried tomatoes, 1 can of artichoke hearts and 1 can of sliced black olives and didn't have pine nuts so omitted it and it was amazing!

I have made this several times- we LOVE it and always get compliments when I take it places. It makes a ton- usually enough to take to a cookout and still have leftovers for lunch the next day. Highly recommend- great recipe.

This is pretty tasty and the slight spicy flavor is a nice touch. It seemed like some forward flavor was missing though. Everything seemed like an after-taste (and it was really good) but still needed something up front. Maybe a citrus? more vinegar? will play a little.

I don't like orzo but my boss made this salad for our office Holiday Party and it was delicious!  I even had seconds and took some home for dinner.  Maybe this is the ONLY way I'll ever eat orzo but it's well worth it. Yum!!!

Very delicious! I used whole wheat orzo, cut the oil & vinegar in half, used reduced fat feta & left out the pine nuts (couldn't find them at the store). Thanks for the recipe.

So good, but next time I want to add more spinach, use less orzo, and add some lemon juice.  We loved it as it was though.

This was a nice, easy salad that is different than the traditional pasta salad. I thought it needed just a little something more though. It was kind of plain.

Cut the recipe in half and the only change I made was to add fresh basil instead of dried basil.  It was very good.  Next time I may try with Arugula and cherry tomatoes.

This is a GREAT recipe. The first time I made it I didn't have any spinach on hand, but I did have broccoli I needed to use up. I blanched the broccoli for a few minutes and stuck it in ice water to cool, then drained it and let it sit while I made the rest of the salad. Be sure to only cook the orzo to al dente so that it soaks up some of the sauce when you mix it all together. Delicious and perfect for a picnic or barbeque since there is no mayo to worry about getting spoiled.

We really liked this recipe, I added cherry tomatoes, artichokes, and zucchini.  I would reduce amount of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to 1/3 cup.

Great recipe for a potluck.  I halved the olive oil (to reduce the fat content) and vinegar and added artichoke hearts.  it was very flavorful and a big hit!

This is excellent as is. I'd give it six stars if I could.  The first time I made it, I didn't have pine nuts so I used sunflower seeds instead and we all enjoyed it.  The next time I made it, I used pine nuts.  They add a lovely little crunch to the salad and makes it complete.  My husband took a large bowl to a work-related function and reported back that it was a huge hit.  Apparently the women in the group wanted to "marry" me!

Edit: I've made this many times now and I have two tips to add. Use white balsamic vinegar because the dark balsamic discolours the orzo (if you're particular about this kind of thing). The other is to lightly toast the pine nuts before adding. This really releases the the nutty flavour.

This is, without a doubt, my most favorite salad in the world.  The combination of the ingredients just play off each other.  I have given this recipe out to more people than I can remember. It is a little time consuming with the chopping of the spinach and red onion but it's so worth it.

This salad is absolute perfection!  I made it for an extended family bbq, and everyone couldn't stop raving about it.  My mom & I ate the leftovers for breakfast!  I made the recipe again two days later because I couldn't stop thinking about it.  And it's delicious with any type of vinegar. If you like mediterranean flavors you will love this salad!

I made this for friends last weekend - the rescipe was super easy.  Instad of roasted peppers I used a jar of roasted pepper pesto.  This eliminated the need for olive oil and balsamic vinegar and was very tasty.  I will definitely serve again this summer!

Yum! We don't like red onion, but otherwise followed the recipe. Very good mix of flavors. Pine nuts add a good bite, but I will probably try another nut or seed next time to save a little money. I also like a higher spinach:pasta ratio, so I will use half a box of the orzo instead.

We thought this was ok. Not great, not bad. We found the balsamic vinegar a little overpowering but liked the mix of salad ingredients. My brother suggested that he thought the same salad would taste really nice with Italian dressing and I thought that was a pretty good suggestion too.

Not bad.  Bf thought it should be warm, which kind of surprised me, but I guess he's a warm pasta guy.  I like all the flavors in this, but maybe needs a bit more orzo or a bit less spinach for me.  I halved the recipe and it does make quite a bit; we've got some leftovers for tomorrow.  I put in garlic instead of onion and I think it works well that way.  I, too, toasted the pine nuts to bring out the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Next time, I'd back off on the onion just a little, but what a fantastic side with the Cheddar Baked Chicken dish found on Allrecipes. You can make this side while the chicken bakes. So delicious!

I loved it and so did my fiance!  It mixes so many of my favorite ingredients.  I served it with Bacon wrapped Scallops (recipe on website) and it was fantastic.  Will definitely do it again, especially since it's so easy to make up ahead of time for a dinner party.

Turned out great.  As per someone else's suggestion, we added marinated artichokes chopped up and chopped olives, and it added to the flavor.  It was spectacular.  I might add more veggies to it to make it even healthier, but it was a great salad.

I did not like this recipe! However, I did sent it to work with my husband and they ate it. When I asked my husband a few months later about this recipe, he said that it was not memorable. I wont be making this again.

I love this salad and have taken it to a couple of outdoor parties.  I've toasted the pine nuts, added chopped red and yellow peppers to add some color but other than that have followed the recipe.  It's great and perfect for a hot day, goes well with anything.

This wasn't really sure how this would turn out but it was so good! I did leave out the onion and added grilled chicken. I think it would be great without the chicken as well. Thanks for the recipe!

A nice fresh and light salad, great for summer BBQ's (went along nicely with my spinach salad and beef sandwiches - sirloin tip roast using marinade from this site!).  I toasted my pine nuts, didn't add any onion (don't much enjoy raw onions) and altered the oil/vinegar ratios as I normally do (like more vinegar, less oil).  I don't think I used quite as much spinach as called for, just eyeballed it and yes, this makes a huge salad, definitely yummy!

I thought this turned out pretty good! I added sun-dried tomatoes and toasted the pinenuts as some others had suggested.  I will definitely cut back on the dressing next time though - probably half the dosage would have been sufficient.  I will definitely make this again - it's a good potluck salad!

At first, I made the recipe just as written (except I used fresh basil instead of dried).  It looked beautiful, and I was SO excited to try it, but was totally disappointed by the blah, bland taste - it was screaming for a little salt!  After adding just a bit of garlic salt, the taste improved tremendously.  The feta is a must, and I think next time I'll add some cherry tomatoes as well.  Oh - this makes a huge salad!  Perfect size for a barbecue, but if you're making it at home, definitely cut down the recipe.

It's hard to believe such a beautiful and tasty salad such as this could be so easy to make.  Wow!  The only changes I made were black pepper instead of white and I toasted slivered almonds instead of pine nuts.  I wanted to add dried cherries but my family liked the salad so much as is they wouldn't let me.  I added them to my own serving and thought it was even better.

Very delicious!  The only change I will make next time is to add the olive oil/balsamic dressing a little bit at a time.  I used all of it, and it was a little too much.  Wouldn't change anything else.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Agree with other reviews on two things:
1)Toast the pine nuts 2)Use less pasta OR
plan to add more vinegar/oil the next day. I really liked this otherwise, and I will make again.

I make this recipe for parties every chance I get.  It is always very well received, even by people who don't think they'll like it.  I usually use rigatoni pasta b/c I think it looks more appetizing, and I always add tomatoes.  I'll sometimes add roasted red peppers for variety, and I use balsamic vinagrette dressing.

Delicious. This recipe makes a ton though so next time I will cut it in half, if not thirds.

The first time I made this, I stuck true to the recipe.  It was delish, but I thought next time I'd only use 2/3 the orzo.  When next time rolled around, I took it to work for a "team food day."  EVERYONE loved it.  Also, I thought my portion reduction of orzo was perfect. Afterward I was sad because there were NO leftovers.  I won't make it for work again though because some of the ingredients make it pricey to serve to a big group of people.  Super super yummy yummy yummy!!!  Thumbs up!

A great salad to make ahead of time for a dinner party.  This is not your typical pasta salad side dish.  I received lots of compliments on this dish.  Thanks!

Excellent!!!  Very light for a summer side dish.  I served it with fresh grouper and grilled vegetables.  My daughter doesn't like onions so I put them in the food processor.  It was a big hit and had to make copies of the receipe.

This a an interesting and different salad.  A big hit with the ladies at Bunco.  I would make it again, but there are so many other good salad recipes out there, I haven't had a chance to get back to it yet.

Very good.  I quartered (?) the recipe, without really measuring, so my propotions may have been a bit off, but it came out great, and this recipe adapts easily.  I left out the pine nuts and added chopped tomatoes and a little salt.  Also less oil and more vinegar (lemon juice would also be nice).  Very good served with fish.

I made it exactly as directed and just didn't like it much. It was a little oily and the balsamic was strong.

I gave it a 5 star because everyone liked it. I thought it wasn't bad, maybe next time I will decrease the oil and add more feta cheese and onions.

Great way to use orzo pasta! I thought the feta was a little overwhelming; next time I would halve it...but I'm not much of a cheese person.

Also tried adding chopped sun-dried tomatoes, which helped even out the flavor a bit for me.

This makes a LOT - we ate it for days. Even halfing the recipe would be plenty for a family. It was very easy and like others I added halfed cherry tomatos for color. **Use "good" olive oil and feta as that will dictate the taste. (I used cheap olive oil the first time - ick!) After taking it to a party no one said much about it but I give it 4 stars because as a vegetarian I really liked it.

Great salad, I added salt and sun-dried tomatoes. I also thought it was better after it sat about 30 minutes. It tastes alot like a salad at Marcaroni Grill served with sole. Thanks for the recipe,,, will make again

Excellent!  This salad has a different, refreshing taste and is so simple.  Be sure to use a good quality olive oil and balsamic.  Thanks Christine...I'm always looking for something new in salads.
