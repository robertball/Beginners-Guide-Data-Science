What a pleasant surprise this was! I have my standard recipe for white bread and am very resistant to change, so I was tempted not to use the full amount of honey in this recipe as I thought it would be too sweet. In fairness to the recipe I "braved it" and added the full 2 tablespoons.  Since I use yeast from the jar, I just measured out 1-1/2 teaspoons. Fragrant, soft and tender, this bread has the perfect balance of sweet and salty, though it is neither. Great bread for toast, sandwiches, or even on it's own with butter and jam!

This bread is SO EASY to make and tastes great.  I used my electric knife to cut and it didn't crumble-every slice was shaped nicely.  I used this recipe and added another tablespoon (1/4 c. total) of honey to make "sweetrolls" in which rolled out, sprinkled with melted butter, cinnamon & sugar, and raisins) rolled them up and sliced, then baked in the oven and frosted.  They were amazing!  I recommend it, especially to moms with young ones (6 & 2) that like to help "cook"...I don't think you can make this bread and have it turn out bad!

Really good and it doesn't crumble when sliced. I used 2 c. white whole wheat flour, 1 c. AP flour, I used kosher salt and added 2 T. buttermilk powder. UPDATE: I bake alot of bread and this one has become a favorite. I now use melted butter instead of oil. I don't have a bread machine so I just proof my yeast and mix it up. Very good bread.

This is now my new all the time white bread recipe. So easy I love it. The family likes the bread in a lofe shape so I use the dough cycle, and bake at 350 for 30 min. checking at 25min. to be safe. I forgot the salt and DH did not notice so I now skip it all the time. I use EVOO in place of the vegetable oil. It seems healther to me. All I can say is don't let the short list of ingredients stop you this is good bread, nice smooth texture, toast up well and holds up to PB & J. brush the crust with butter and it wont get hard. Thank you LJSS for a wonderfull recipe.

Very good white bread. Slices nicely without crumbling. One thing I did find out on my last batch...I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour with 3 tsp of gluten added, changed it to 18 servings like another reviewer to make a 2 lb loaf and it rose too much and not only hit the top of the lid, but overflowed. I took it out of the bread machine and separated the dough into 2 and placed in greased loaf pans and baked at 350 for 25 min and they came out great. I think from now on I will use the 18 servings adjustment and use the dough cycle on the bread machine and bake in the oven. Made great grilled cheese sandwiches and pb and j's. Definitely going into my favorites.

Try adding 3-4 tablespoons of powdered buttermilk (found in the baking section).  We find this bread so versitile, and it is also fantastic and light and HEALTHY all by itself.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

You simply Must try this recipe!!  I was a little dubious at first, but I would rate this seven starts now, if I could!  I used real butter instead of oil, and  I increased the servings to 18 to make a 2 lb(?) loaf - I assumed the recipe made enough for a standerd 1.5 lb loaf - and put the crust on the lightest setting. The first loaf was gone in an afternoon, and I'm now making a second one for today!

Fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I put it in the bread machine and selected dough cycle.  I took the dough out and put in on a surface sprinkled with flour, punched the dough a few times, shaped it into a ball and placed it in a greased 9 x 5 loaf pan and covered it with greased wax paper.  Let it rise for 30 minites more then place it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 min.  Came out perfect.  The kids ate it in a day!

My daughter doesn't like sandwiches unless they are on white wonder bread.  I gave her this bread for her sandwich and she begged me to make it everyday!  She loves it!  Very easy to make!  Set the delay function so the bread smells so good as we are waking up!

Tried this recipe, it tasted delicious, but it was very thin/whispy... didn't turn out like the picture at all, and wouldn't work for sandwiches/jams.

I did not have any sugar and wanted some homemade bread. I found this recipe and was worried about the honey, but it did not change the taste of the bread. But I loved this and so did my family. I'll admit I was surprised how good this turned out.  This is a definite keeper and I will make if often!

Fantastic simple white bread! I use the intructions from another loaf for the order of ingredients (water, then sugar, then yeast in the water to foam up, then flour). Makes for a fluffier loaf I think.

I've tried many different homemade bread recipes of different types.  This recipe, by far, is the best! Approved by all 5 children and husband.  I have made it 3 times and changed a few things.  First I set it to 18 servings for a nice big loaf.  I added 6 tsp wheat gluten & reduced the sugar in half.  I use the dough cycle on the bread machine and it rises all the way to the top and hits the glass! I then put it in the oven at 360 degrees for 25-30 mins.  It doesn't crumble, I cut it with a bread knife.  Great for eating alone with butter and jelly, sandwiches, french toast, and different spreads.  Our absolute FAVORITE!!! I made two loaves today and between the 6 of us, they are gone by the end of the day. I plan on making this everyday from here on out.

Longtime viewer, First review. The bread is that good. "Simply White Bread? uh.. it's White Bread, how good can it be?" That's what I thought, but the ravings of the crowd won me over. What's the harm in trying it out.

I Sub. butter for Veg oil. Set my breadmachine to 1.5lb, white bread, light.

Very pleased with the results: Best looking loaf that I've made to date; soft yet firm, even density all the way through. Easy to slice (once it cools) for large sandwhiches. As another reviewer noted, grilled cheese (or grilled-anything) is amazing. 

Thank you LJSS for showing me how good plain 'ol white bread can be.

LOVE THIS RECIPE! It took me a while to figure out how to add the ingredients, since I don't have a manual. I always put the salt in first, then flour, oil and honey, water, and finally a packet of instant yeast. I have always used the instant yeast since thats all I have on hand. Works just fine!

Very good! I added cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg (just a dash of each) for a sweet smelling bread. It turned out beautifully. I will make this again for sure.

I used a bread machine on medium dark and " basic" setting. I followed the recipe except for substituting sugar for the honey. It was a great loaf of bread; crunchy outside moist inside. Next time I plan to raise the servings to 18 to get a bigger loaf out of the machine. Thanks for sharing!

Roughly one and a quarter parts liquid to three parts flour? No, no, no...a hydration in the low 40's is way, way too low. It's no wonder everyone gets a tight crumb! Hydration should be around 55%-65%.  Sure enough, I ended up adding around .5 of a cup of water while the machine was kneading because the dough was too dry and kept "knocking." This additional water didn't affect the tight crumb. Also, .25 oz. of yeast is roughly 2 1/4 tsp.

This a good simple recipe for white bread. Don't forget to let the loaf cool before slicing or it'll be gummy. Enjoy!

I've made this now several times in the last few weeks. It always comes out great; my husband likes it well enough that I've stopped buying packaged bread for the time being. This is a significantly cheaper option, better in taste and healthier.

Love this bread recipe.  Very dense much like beer bread, which I love.  Less sweet though which is also great.  This is wonderful toasted with a good blackberry jam. YUM.  I have made 5 loaves in the last week because my family loves it too.  THANKS

If I could I would give it 10 stars. It turned out perfect. It rose almost to the top of my machine and it has a wonderful texture. I have been having trouble lately with my breads not rising properly. I found the solution, weigh the dry ingredients in grams. It is alot more accurate. Next time I bake this I am going to substitute sugar for the honey just to see how it changes the flavor. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

Delicious! This is the first time I've ever made bread. It's been done for 30 min and the loaf is already half gone. It is so good, and so easy! No more store bought bread in this house :)

This is the loaf I bake on a regular basis -- about every 5-6 days.  My son uses it for sandwiches.  My variation:  I use melted butter instead of vegetable oil, add 2 tablespoons of dried milk, and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast instead of the packet.  It comes out perfect every time, is amazing while warm, and does not crumble when making into sandwiches.

Very good recipe! I was very satisfied with the baked product and bread stayed fresh and soft even after few days. This would be my CHOSEN and FAVE white bread recipe amongst the others i've tried.

Excellent.  Bf loved this, and he's picky about homemade bread.  He likes "nice, soft, white bread" and declared this was a good recipe for it.  I don't usually use my breadmaker to make bread completely, so I used the dough setting and finished it in the oven:  375 degrees for 35 minutes.  Worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I typed "white bread" in my search engine, and this popped up.  Way to simple to be good, right?  I am now making my second loaf after the first one we made last night is now a sweet, happy memory.  MAKE THIS BREAD!

EXECLLENT easy bread to make. I used 1 tabsp marg and 1 of oil melted in the hot water and added a tabsp milk powder to the four. In place of baking in machine I made dough and baked in oven. I also used it for mini rolls. Will make larger rolls next time. Any which way this is a winner of a recipe

Wonderful bread and easy to make with the breadmaker. I took another poster's advice with the yeast from a jar and used 1.5 tsp and cut with an electric knife. Fantastic recipe I intend to make for company.

Okay....I have tried many recipes for bread and this is by far the best tasting and the easiest I have made so far.  I did add some of the suggestions from others but I did go by the original recipe.  The suggestions I added were:  added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla...added 2 tbls dried milk and used butter in place of veg oil...and I did bake mine in the oven, however, at the present time I have a loaf baking in my bread machine because I wanted to make sure that my bread machine is doing a good job...we will see.  If you are like me and love home-made bread but can't seem to find the right recipe....look no further...it is WONDERFUL!!

I made this recipe last night, turned out fantastic!  Very light and fluffy.  Between me and my BF, only about 1" left of loaf.  Made recipe exactly as instructed...not too sweet, exactly right.  Wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for sharing!

After trying several bread recipes from this site, this is the one!! I love the fact that you can cut this bread and use it for sandwiches and it doesn't fall apart. I have made this recipe 3 times and it came out great as the recipe reads. Thank you so much!!

Very good recipe, the first one that I can slice for sandwiches with no problems so A+ I didn't have any honey so I tried maple syrup and it was great, although I'm sure substituting w/sugar would be fine too.

Wow!  I did not change a thing and just followed the recipe.  The bread came out so soft and yummy with a nice hard crust.  I have to admit that I ate a slice just by itself with nothing on it! Will not be searching any further for a white bread recipe. The others do not even compare. And I LOVE the fact that this uses honey as opposed to sugar.

OH MY!!!  The smell in my kitchen, while baking, was to die for.  I used a mixture of Maple Syrup and Sugar in place of the honey (didn't have any in the house) and it still tasted delicious.  So good, in fact, I'm going to start another loaf.  YUM!!!

First bread I have ever made in my machine that did not crumble when sliced.  Opposed to other reviews I might add an extra dash of salt and maybe a teaspoon or two more of honey.

I made this yesterday. It's gone. I'm making another right now. Memo to self: Do NOT increase to 2 lb loaf, the 1 1/2 lb loaf almost touches the top of the Cuisinart bread machine chamber. 

This recipe gets rave reviews in this house.

I like the simplicity of the recipe. I have made on a few time in the bread makers,,but have also converted to a  mixer/oven recipe. Both work well and give a nice fluffy slice.. But I have found that depending on the day I have to add up to 1TBSP more water ( maybe humidity level, who knows) .
This last time , I experimented by shaping and cooking as buns, which also worked well
A keeper recipe for me that I can use either in a bread machine..or the oven which I do prefer

It needed 2 and a half hours in our machine, and we also set the machine to be on large bread setting. IT TASTED AWESOME!!  The family finished half of it in a few minutes.

This bread is delicious . I made it as directed and used peanut oil. The smell will drive you crazy as it is cooking. It is soft and yummy. I had no problem making sandwiches of any kind even grilled cheese. It was a hit in my home!! Just made my second loaf today. I did had to add about a teaspoon of extra water. i saw some of the flour was not gathering to the ball in the dough cycle knead. I added a tablespoon on top of the flour that wasn't adhering to the ball. The flour then got right into the ball on the knead. Bread dough is like that some days you need less water some days more , some days none. I find the honey gives the bread just a hint of sweetness, which I like . Great recipe , will be my go for white bread . I have made so tried so many bread recipes . No more searching for a great white bread recipe!!! Thanks!

Decided to make this today and was pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely a bread that the grandkids will eat.  Perfect for Peanut butter and jelly.  I made the recipe as is.  It makes a 1.5 lb loaf.  If you want to make a 2# loaf, go to 15 servings.  If you raise to 18 servings that is way to much dough for most bread makers.  I read previous comments about dough overflowing.  Great bread!!

The bread has a wonderful taste. However, as bread machine bread often is, this is rather rubbery for me. It has a very soft internal texture, but the edges are very rubbery and difficult to bite. I have to tear them apart with my teeth rather than just bite them. Chewing is not impossible, but somewhat difficult.

I was very excited to try out this recipe, but I was disappointed in the results.  The loaf was very small and only rose about 4 inches and the outside was very hard.  On the bright side, the inside was delicious though.  Undecided if I'll try it out again.

This is an awesome recipe. Since it was vague on some of the instructions, this is what I did: proved the yeast in WARM water for 10 min then added the remainder ingredients ending with flour and sugar. And I just used all purpose. set machine accordingly, and thoroughly enjoyed the results upon completion. Easy to add ingredients, as my second loaf had fresh herbs from my garden and some garlic powder. TRY IT!!! IT'S DEEEEE-LISH!!!!

I tried this recipe along with another one that just used sugar,  Everyone agreed this loaf was better. I made it the first time exactly as listed, and entirely in the bread machine.  This time I tried using the Dough feature and baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes like others recommended. Cme out PERFECT.  

This bread is very moist and delish!

This tasted like water and flour paste. I have made another one with milk instead and butter instead of water and oil, much better.

Very easy to cut! No crumbles! YAY! I love the use of honey instead of sugar. It gives the bread a nice color and texture. I'm not a fan of clover honey, so I buy wildflower honey from our local beekeepers. A perfect bread for sandwiches or a slice with crabapple butter! Yum!

Boyfriend loved it; I thought it was just ok. 5 stars because it really is a simple white bread. Found after I put all my ingredients in and started the machine that my bread machine yeast has a conversion chart on it...my advice would be to check that out before adding your bread machine yeast. Freaked out, but added more yeast and all was well.

I love this recipe, I know it says "Simply White Bread" but I make it as my standard whole wheat bread and it is excellent.  My kids beg me to make this bread all the time. They eat the whole loaf at dinner.

My family really liked this one.  It's easy and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  It has a better flavor than other recipes that I've tried, probably due to the honey.  I used 1 tablespoon coconut oil and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.  This one's a keeper.

I felt the bread had a thick hard crust.  This is true, especially at altitude.   Even making the recipe adjusted for altitude,  the crust was very hard.

I think I will move on to a different recipe.

Used olive oil as the vegetable oil. Bread came together well in mixing phase and the result was a very nice loaf.

Very good and tasty. I used aguave syrup instead of honey. We were out of honey. It turned out great!

I made this bread but I added a few things to it.  I added a cup of brown sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla.  The bread turned out moist and sweet with a subtle cinnamon flavor.  Absolutely delicious!  The loaf was a little on the small side though. I haven't tried it without the additives but I'm sure it would be just as good plain.

Easy bread to make.  The kids love it and it keeps fresh for several days.  My favorite go to for white bread.
