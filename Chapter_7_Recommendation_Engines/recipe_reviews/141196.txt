This has become my new favorite way of eating green beans! I would add less lemon though- Somewhere between a whole and a half would be optimal! This went really well with either scallops or fish.

Like recommended, I cut back on the lemon.  I used almonds b/c that's what I had on hand.  My husband, who grew up despising green beans, really liked these.  He said these were even better than the green beans I make with bacon fat and pieces.  Now that's saying something...and since we've wanted to make healthier choices, what a bonus!

Turned out very very lemony. Probably should have used just 1/2 a lemon instead of whole. Also, felt like the walnut pieces were too chunky ... hard to get much walnut with the bean or vice versa :( .

I was very dissappointed with these beans.  There should be a measurement for how much lemon juice/zest as all lemons are different sizes! My dinner guests and I all puckered our lips at the first bite. WAY to lemony.  I would have used a third of the lemon juice and maybe added a bit of butter.

This was a hit in my house, but I suggest you cut back on the lemon juice a bit.  It sneaks up on you and gives you quite a jolt!

I had these along side some grilled swordfish and they were fantastic!!! The lemon and the thyme were an excellent combination I wouldn't have thought of in a million years. Thanks!

As written, that's a heck of a lot of lemon and walnuts for a pound of beans!  I cut back on both  by more than half and enjoyed it.

JasBradley - What a great recipe!!! I prepared your recipe for Chrismas Dinner Party and it was a great hit!! Everyone liked this dish. It was a colorful touch to the rest of our meal. I may have over done the chopped walnuts, but everyone really loved it. I fixed three separate bowls for three tables. The picture was only one of the three bowls of Green Beans. Thanks for sharing this recipe with the ALLRECIPE.COM family.

My husband loved it, for me it is a 4 1/2. I halved the recipe, used 1/8 cup of bottled lemon and 1/4 tsp. dried thyme.

I found the idea of this recipe interesting, but I had a couple issues that had nothing to do with the actual recipe. First off, my daughter and I have texture issues with any kind of nuts in with fruit, so I substituted walnut oil for the nutty flavor. Second, to soften the lemon flavor a bit I used Lemon Myrtle from Australia and seasoned it until it was right for everyone, and lastly-I did this over lima beans. No special reason other than we were green beaned out over the holidays.

Very nice recipe, but quite lemony, which I enjoyed, but you need to be mindful of what you serve this with, as a lemony taste does not go with well with some flavors.

Steamed green beans then followed your recipe...I think the beans retain more if their flavor and nutrients by steaming for about 8 mins...??

I love thyme with my roasted eggplant so I was surprised when I was not a fan of it with the green beans.  May be a personal preference.  
I love lemon on green beans and only juiced 1/2 a lemon as recommended per others but found it needed the whole lemon (could be to offset the thyme).
