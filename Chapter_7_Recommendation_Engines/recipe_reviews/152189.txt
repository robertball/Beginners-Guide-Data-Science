I love these cookies!  The second time I made them I altered the recipe just a bit, which really made them incredible:  1)I added 1 tsp of ground ginger as suggested.  2)I thought these were a tad too molasses-y, so I used 3/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey.  3)To make the dough a little less crumbly and easier to roll out, I upped the milk to 1/3 cup.  4) I like them to be a little thicker, so I rolled the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness.  Also, my pig cookie cutter was much smaller than the traditional, so this recipe made 4 dozen cookies, and I baked them for 12 minutes (you don't want to overbake).  Delicious!

Love these cookies!  Great flavor -- even better than the bakery's version. However, based on the "too dry" remarks from several of the reviewers, I only used about 5 cups of flour.  Basically, I just added flour until the dough pulled away from the bowl.

They tasted exactly like the puerquitos that my parents used to buy me as a child from our local panaderia (bakery). My one suggestion is to adjust the baking time if you dont have the marranito/puerquito cookie cutter. this cookie cutter is slightly larger then your average large cookie. I used a large tulip cookie cutter (b/c its what i had) and the first batch hardened to much, and they were okay, but they defintely didnt have that authentic marranito texture. So I lowered the timed by 3-4 mintues. Its also important to roll the batter into the right thickness...enjoy!

These turned out well but I found the dough a little difficult to work with. I did end up using the full six cups of flour. 1/2 Molasses and 1/2 honey and dark brown sugar. I also added a little orange zest for additional flavor. I had a 3.75" pig cookie cutter and baked them for 12 minutes. I would go a little less next time so they are a bit softer. The centers were soft but the feet were crunchy. Good dunkers for hot tea. The Mexican guys at work really liked them. I would make them again.

These were great! The dough was crumbly so I kept having to add shortening...i almost gave up. I'm glad I didnt! They are sooo good!

I do have to give everyone a warning about this recipe!  When you bake these babies, keep them out from your kids sight.  They will ruin dinner.  My brother visited from Houston and said these taste so much better than the bakeries there!  Thanks so much!

I made these last Christmas and my family loved them.  They looked and tasted just like the bakery.  The only thing is that they were a little hard.  I suggest using more shortening.

I WILL TRY THIS RECIPE CAUSE THE ORIGINAL SUGAR(PILONCILLO)THAT WE USE IS TO EXPENSIVE.IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS DOUGH  FOLLOW THE RECIPE THE WAY IT IS AND THEN LEAVE IT IN THE FRIDGE FOR ONE HOUR OR MORE.LIVING THE DOUGH IN THE FRIDGE WILL HELP TO WORK WITH IT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ROLL IN AND CUT THE SHAPE OF THE MARRANITO.

So, i didnt happen to have a pig shaped cookie cutter lying around, so i used the basis of this recipe for drop cookies! Well, i only used 3.75 cups of flour rather than 6, and 3/4 cup of molasses with 1/4 cup of light corn syrup. I added a dash of ginger, and they were delicious!  Now they are a family must-have!

I ended up only using 5 cups of flour - I don't think my mixer could have handled another cup. Other than that I used the recipe to a T. I think next time I'll only use 1 cup of brown sugar as I found these to be a little sweeter than the kind I'm used to - but at least I can have these anytime now instead of waiting until someone in the family visits or is visiting from Chicago!

These tasted just like the ones we grew up eating. They were great! I gave it only 4 stars because the dough was really hard to roll out, it was crumbly, so it became very frustrating and more work than I wanted to put into it.

Recipe was great i subbed in some honey and ginger and cut the molasses like other reviewers mentioned and they were soooo good. I didn't have a problem with them being too crumbly but I didn't use all the flour either. Just add the flour slowly not all at once.

I made these for a Cinco de Mayo themed party. Didn't have pig shaped cutters, so used the largest biscuit cutter I have. I used 3/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey (since folks here in Pennsylvania might not ready for the full molasses), 1/3 cup milk, about 5 1/3 cups flour (plus some additional for rolling), and 1 tsp ginger. Instead of an egg wash, I used milk brushed on top. They were some of the prettiest cookies I've ever made (and tasted great too)!

Loved it, did adjust and added ginger.  I compared two recipes and split it down the middle but this recipe did the trick.  Since the recipe was so large I split the batch in half and saved wrapped in plastic and baked the second week, it came out fabulous.

Great recipe. I also did NOT use all 6 cups of flour. (I probably only used about 5 - 5.5 cups and some for rolling out the dough) and I did the 3/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey as another reviewer recommended. They turned out soooo yummy!

I followed the reviews on the amount of flour.  I used five cups and it was easy to work dough.  I rolled out to 1/2 inch thick.  I did change the temperature on baking.  Did 350 for 12 minutes.  Cookies came out done and soft. No hard ends. Husband loves these cookies.

Wonderful cookies! I used 1/3 cup milk, 5.5 cups flour, and ginger as others have suggested. A bit more chewy (maybe cut back on the molasses) than the ones from the panderia, but otherwise identical. Love them! :D

No changes needed - unless you count the shape. I cannot find a large piggy cookie cutter, so we use our Christmas cookie cutters!
We love the recipe as is!

2nd time. I prefer it with the ginger but there still delicious w/o. By mistake I ordered the wrong cookie cutter from Amazon which came to be the best choice. I get 32 piggies. One being half the calories. You can eat two and not feel like a pig.

I followed the instructions exactly as the recipe said but my dough was too crumbly and wouldn’t stick together at all. So I added a total of 3/4 cups of milk and an extra egg just to be able to roll it out. I’m not sure where I went wrong or why I was having so much trouble but the end result was still good. They taste/look good but aren’t soft like I  expected them to be. Even so, they’re still yummy. I didn’t have a pig cookie cutter so I used other fun shapes my kids picked out. 12 minutes in the oven was long enough for these since they’re way smaller than regular piggies. :)

Followed Grasshopper's advice on the flour, and it helped a lot! I let it set in fridge for a bit, and used my hands to help warm up dough to work it with rolling pin. It is a bit crumbly, so rolled out dough to make 'em 2 at a time, which REALLY  cut down on my frustration! A little time consuming but worth it. These are better than any store-bought marranitos I can find in town.  4 out of 5 stars since i didn't follow exact recipe. Will definitely make these again.

the molasses flavor was too strong I will make it again with two-thirds the recommended amount. Aside from that they were good, but too thin, So I made them thicker and at the end, ended up making them 3/4 in thick.

I have made this over and over again as the recipe instructs with no alterations.  Perfect cookie every time.

I did this recipe and I love it. Its easy quick and fun. I did not use the cookie cutter  I cut them like cookies.  I also used 1/4 cup butter with 1/8 cup of shortning . Instead of milk i used egg nog , and i used ginger . I also used egg nog to brush the top of each cookie instead of egg. 

Great fofor Christmas  giving

This recipe for Marranitos is by far the best recipe I've gotten from Allrecipes.com.  After having a hard time finding them at mexican bakeries and stores near us, I finally decided to look for a recipe.  This is so much better than the cookies I've purchased in the past.  I have made them many times with great results. I had taken the advice of others and used 5 cups of flour.  Has worked perfectly every time.

The dough was too dry and crumbly, the second time I tied this, I used 5 cups of flour instead and it was still dry and crumbly.
