I've made this twice now and it always turns out perfectly. I used two fresh peaches and sprinkled some frozen blueberries in...the colors looked so pretty together! I also sprinked some streusel on top...1TBS butter, 2 TBS Flour and 1 TBS sugar. Work together by hand, make more as desired...makes a perfect crispy topping. Thanks for the great recipe!

BEST PEACH CAKE EVER!! Upon eating this, my Dad said;"You NEED to bake another one. Right now, like 'I'll-go-to-the-store-and-buy-you-more-peaches' right now!"  I made this with fresh peaches and added a crumb topping. My aunt's crumb topping recipe: 3/4 cup of white sugar 3/4 cup of white flour 1/2 cup butter or margarine Crumble this up and sprinkle on top. I had to cook the cake a little longer, till the topping was browned.  Hope you enjoy this as much as I did!!

Wonderful recipe, especially with fresh, ripe peaches.  Would use almond flavoring instead of vanilla next time and sprinkle nutmeg as well as cinnamon on top.  A rustic looking dessert rather then elegant.  Small quibble, if you use fresh peaches, HOW MUCH???  I ended up doing two peach spiral layers.  Also, my sides came up slightly higher then the peaches so I filled in with whip cream and sprinkled with toasted almonds.  Was a huge hit, this is a keeper.

The recipe says margarine and then later says butter. I used butter and while it was difficult to spread it was excellent. I have made it twice since once with canned pears and 1/2 the cinnamon . It is a wonderful and handy recipe .

Updated on 09/03/11.  I LOVE this recipe!

I have also made this with other fruit: 

Granny Smith apples tasted great, but I wasn't happy with the appearance & texture of sliced apples. The crust baked faster than the apple slices.  Next time, I will chop them and might zap them in the microwave before adding to the crust.  

Mangoes - our family favorite so far.  I chopped them coarsely, used the almond flavoring, and sprinkled the kuchen with toasted coconut immediate after baking.  Very pretty presentation and wonderful flavor.

This is definitely a 5-Star recipe, and a new favorite with my German family. Even without the traditional custard in the filling, they really loved this Kuchen. My only "tweak" was to use a 1/2 tsp almond extract because I had no vanilla extract.

Next time, might try adding some ground almonds to the dough, and keep the almond flavoring.  It went really well with the peaches.  The crust would be a great base for just about any other fruit, i.e., apples, pears, even berries.

I used 3-4 very large, fresh peaches from the farmer's market.  I removed the skins by dropping into boiling water for a couple minutes, and plunging into ice water.  The skins slipped right off, and the peaches were easy to slice.

I made 1 plum used 4 plums sliced  and 1 apple used 2 apples sliced. 
I made in 2 foil lined 8 inch square pan for easy removal. 
Used Splenda and 1/2 margarine and 1/2 applesauce. Had to add a bit of milk because the batter was too dry, reduced cooking time by 5 minutes because of smaller pan. 
Dough not enough for 9 inch springform double for that size.
Good basic kuchen recipe you can modify to your taste and fruit!

Awesome, I made a spiral pattern with my peaches, it tasted great. My only complaint is the way I cooked it. Because when it was done the peaches were stringy... still good though. ^_^

I always use canned peaches, with the juice drained.  I sprinkle with only a little suguar & cinnamon before baking.  The dough is pretty sticky and spreads thin in the springform pan, but I find it rises when it's baking -- but not too deep.  I'm going to try plums this summer (maybe stew then a little so they're soft to start)

If you're looking for a rich, but lightly sweet, fruity confection, this'll do nicely. I made the following changes: used a 10" springform pan and doubled the cake part; substituted butter for the margarine (I have a little Paula Deen in me); used 3 1/2 large fresh peaches; increased the sugar-cinnamon topping to 4 1/2 tbs sugar: 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon; lengthened bake time to about 50 minutes. Beware! The result is less like cake than buttery shortbread, but it is nonetheless tasty and it pairs well with the fruit. Some tips: serve with some fresh whipped cream for added moisture; leave the skins on the peach slices for a pretty, rustic look.

I love this - so here is my take on it:
1. It's a shortbread crust, so it will be dry(ish)
2.  The dough IS sticky - BUT that is EASILY remedied.  Sprinkle top with with flour as you are spreading with your fingertips.  It is literally a non issue.
3.  I always bake in a glass pie dish.  I either serve from it, or it slides right out to serve on something else.
4.  I have always used fresh peaches while they are in season, but might try this winter with some of the peaches I canned.  
5. I like vanilla with peaches, so I haven't tried the almond.. not sure I will since I think it's pretty perfect with the vanilla.
6. I pour some of the peach juice on the top - just because.
7.  I do top with a brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, and a bit of flour (all mixed together well).
8.  Then I eat it.

Delicious. I used butter instead of marg., and added a crumb topping. Used four whole peaches, sliced. I had to bake it about 55 minutes total because of the topping. Oh, and I couldn't find my springform pan, so I used an oval baking dish...worked fine! A great recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

very pretty dessert. It was also very delicious! It took a lot longer to cook than listed, I added at least 30 minutes to the cooking time.  It really never looked "golden brown" to me, so it was difficult to tell when it was done.   I didn't read many reviews- I'm not sure if anyone else had a hard time spreading the dough into the pan with their hands?! What a mess. I tried, but ended up using a spatula- and it took me quite a while.  This recipe is not something in my opinion that is easy to bake- but definitely something you should bake! It's wonderful.

Really lovely as is, though I did use almond extract rather than vanilla and real butter.  Not too sweet.  Perfect use of fresh peaches and a few blueberries for additional color.  

I did not feel the need for a strudel topping as some recommend, just some cinnamon sugar.  Also would not double it as recommended by some...the fruit should be the star of this dish.  It should be more like a tart than like a cake.  Would be great with some homemade vanilla bean ice cream.  CAUTION:  Because it is not overly sweet, you could eat the whole thing yourself!

Wonderful. The recipe was easy and a great way to use the seasonal fruit we had this summer. I added blueberries and raspberries as well as a granola topping.

Kuchen has been a treat in my family for years and this is the first I've tried my hand at making it. I'm a somewhat beginning baker at 22 but I really enjoy it. My aunt gave me her recipe but because I didn't have shortening or cream on hand I went with this one. The final product was very dry and really lacked flavor. My husband who loves the family kuchen didn't even finish his slice. The taste improves as you get to the crust but I was surprised at the blandness. The only change I made was adding 1/4 tsp of rum extract after the vanilla. Seems to me there should have been more flavor. Our family recipe is a little different, adding in a filling with the peaches comprised largely of eggs, cream, and sugar. I would suggest adding a little more sugar to this recipe!

This was very good! I did use butter as that is what I had on hand. I also followed the suggestions and used almond extract. I'm so glad I did - I think the almond flavor really made this cake special. I also added an extra sprinkling of cinnamon to the topping and used turbinado sugar in lieu of the granulated sugar for the topping. Thanks! Very nice with coffee and not overly sweet. You could serve with breakfast!

I have been making this for years (got the recipe from an old Pillsbury bakeoff booklet) and threw the booklet out by mistake during some pre-moving organzing!  So glad to have found it it, because this is one of my favorites, and I have a bunch of fresh peaches (never made it with canned) that I have to use.  Always good, always liked by everyone!  I have also used other fruit and it comes out just perfect every time.  Will be making it tonight!

My husband found it dry.  I didn't mind it but it is more something you would eat while sipping tea.  Maybe it needed more peaches to give it the moisture it needed.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the crust, as others had suggested and I used almond extract rather than vanilla.  Was a very tasty and will definitely make again.  I would consider using a bit less butter as a fair bit of it melted out and ended up on the bottom of my stove.  I baked this in a  springform pan, and this did make it easier for the butter to leak out while baking.  But, the crust was great, just the same.

Great!  Fresh peaches are a must and the only major thing to note with this recipe is that it really does not make enough to serve 12.  I opted to use a small round 8" pan instead of my springform and the batter really does spread quite thin - definitely double if you need a large enough dessert to serve.  I added almond extract instead of vanilla and it gave a wonderful flavour with the peaches.  Also used brown sugar in my topping, very yummy!

I was the only one who liked it.  It came out really pretty. I used fresh peaches. The batter was hard to spread though.  Everyone else said it was too sweet.  Maybe less sugar next time?


Update: You can use other fruits or canned fruit.  It works very well.  The pie crust comes out nice and soft.

I would recommend it with cherries or blue berries.

I cannot believe this received ANY good ratings! I was searching for my German mom's recipe and this seemed the closest so I was very eager to undertake it this morning & enjoy it later this evening after dinner. What a WASTE of not only ingredients, but my TIME! The batter was TOO STICKY to spread with my fingers(???) so I used a spatula; then there wasn't nearly enough batter! I know for a fact I followed this to a "T", so it wasn't an error. My mom baked the cake first in a type of fluted tart pan with a raised bottom; when she turned it out, she spread drained canned peaches pinwheel style on the top while still a bit warm. The juices soak right in! Then she would spread some type of sweet glaze over the top... while the cake portion was NOT "sweet" (which I prefer), the yummy jell-like topping was, and it was the most delicious cake I ever had. I wish my mom were still around so I could ask her, but in the meantime, I'm still trying to find her recipe! Think I might try this batter again, but double it... then add peaches on top afterward as I described. This also took 45 minutes to cook at 350, and it still isn't evenly cooked. Sad about losing this morning too.

I also found that it wasn't enough dough to fill a 9 in springform pan....it came out really really flat. It's too bad because I was hoping to take it to a pot luck tonight which won't be happening. I'll try to double the recipe next time.

This was super easy to make! I took it to a work potluck and it disappeared fast!  I like that it wasn't super sweet. Thanks for the great recipe.

I can't get enough of fresh peaches this time of year, so I thought I'd try this as an alternative to peach pie. The only thing I would do differently is to use brown sugar on top. Otherwise, this is great - not at all heavy, and not too sweet. Thanks!

I used fresh peaches and baked the cake in a pie plate.  I also used brown sugar on the peaches.  We really enjoyed it and I'll make this often.  Thanks!

This was very nice. I found when I was spreading the dough in the cake tin to just lightly dust my hands with a bit of flour made it easier.  Also next time I will try to use brown sugar and cinnamon, as it could use a bit of something. Otherwise a keeper.

I made this yesterday and i was a little afraid to beat the flour into the wet mixture but decided to do that and it came out wonderfull.. i do think that if you use fresh peaches you MUST taste them first, if they arent very sweet i would use 4 tablespoons sugar (2 brown sugar, 2 white).. i mixed the peaches and sugar/cinnamon in a bowl before arranging them on the dough. then drizzled the sugar syrup that was left.. my family loved it... this is also very good with raspberries oops.forgot to say, i doubled the recipe for the dough and used 2 large fresh peaches

I came up with 8 TINY servings, instead of 12, so the crust definately needs doubling. Other than that, it was an amazing desert! A keeper!

PS: The cinammon may seem too much (and kinda spoils the presentation), but it is just right.

We recently moved to a house with a peach tree. I'm experimenting with ways to convince my husband that peaches are not as bad as he remembered as a child. This was an easy first try. I added Kurogoma to half, because I like the nutty flavor. I also substituted butter, and I topped it with brown sugar. The experiment worked, and my husband took a second, larger piece,

Having spent a couple of years living in Germany with the baker driving through the village with fresh baked goodies in his station wagon, beeping for the house fraus to come get their bread and desserts, I loved kuchen.  Years ago I found a recipe for blueberry kuchen that I always make when blueberries are in season and my family loves it.  The crust recipe for this peach kuchen is the same as my blueberry kuchen, and I use my food processor to make the dough.  I used 2 fresh ripe peaches that I skinned after dipping them in boiling water for a few seconds.  It is excellent and we will now have peach kuchen when they are in season too!

I made this for a Labor Day BBQ. Everyone loved it!! I thought it was a little dry but I used fresh peaches instead of can cause that was what I had on hand.  Next time I think I will add a crumb topping per other reviews.

I doubled the "crust" as suggested by someone but I think that dried it out a bit due to the much longer cooking time.  Still tasty though and I'll make it again but will cut back the crust ingredients to 1.5 the amount instead of double.  Fresh Niagara peaches worked well.

This turned out pretty good.  I think you could use a smaller pan if you don't have the size recommended, though and it would do just as well. I thought my crust was a little thin trying to get it to cover the entire area.  As far as the timing in the oven, I think you will need to watch it and make sure you don't take it out before the peaches are bubbling in the middle.  I was given some blueberries by a neighbor & put some of them on the top as well as the peaches for color and variety.  Turned out great.

On the plus side, it's incredibly easy to make, however I found it to be completely lacking in sweetness.  I'll probably make it again, but really tweak it a lot more.

Making for the second time today - only with fresh sour cherries - I saw a few people say the didn't like that it wasn't sweet but I grew up in a german household and that is something that is typical and that I really like about european desserts as opposed to north american ones. Its more about individual flavours (almonds or hazelnuts or cherries) then just sweetness. I grew up eating kuchen mit cafe - cake and coffee - every afternoon - usually plum not peach. This would have been served with a fresh dollop of whipped cream and if sour plums or cherries sprinkled with enough sugar to cut the sour. Perfect afternoon or breakfast dish. 
I did dbl the recipe and use butter not margarine because thats just more authentic - and low cal ha ha ha :) - and have done in both spring form and just glass baking dish - lots of greasing the pan for that one. enjoy

Followed the recipe exactly except substituted almond extract for vanilla. Didn't have a springform pan so put parchment paper in a square 9" pan. VERY difficult to spread, so didn't go up the sides just made them a bit higher than the rest and sliced peaches thin. Baked for 40 min. Absolutely delicious, almost cookie-like bottom with peaches on top, WOW

Perfect as written. Fast, easy and you can use whatever fresh, frozen or canned fruit you want or have on hand. Play with it on the extracts for example lemon with blueberry, almond with peach, etc.  Many Thanks SHER!15!

I usually don't send in reviews, but this one really was a disappointment.  I've never made a kuchen, so I may not know how they are supposed to be, but this was really dry.  Not sweet at all.  More like a biscuit with peaches on it.  I definitely would not make it again.  Sorry!

This is a great recipe that is quick & easy to put together. The crust is not overly sweet, and the cinnamon complements the peaches, to my surprise (I don't recall ever combining them).  I made this with fresh just-ripe peaches but otherwise followed the recipe as written; 6 unpeeled small peaches (cut in 8ths) yielded 2 rows of slices that held together nicely and didn't turn to mush.   As other reviewers have suggested, I will try doubling the crust next time, as it is a little thin on the bottom.

Updated Sep 2015: My original review failed to mention that it was made using butter (unsalted). This recipe is now a family favourite.

The recipe doubles well in a 9x13 dish with 8 fresh peaches and the original quantities for the crust. I use cold butter straight from the fridge, which gives a crumbly result for pressing into the dish (less messy) and bakes up very nicely.

Very good. I thought the crust was a little thin, but it could be the size pan I used. This reminds me of a german apple cake my mom used to make, which I will post here later.

It became my family recipe! It's very easy to make and delicious! Play with fruit filling. My favorite is canned peaches, but canned pears taste great too!! My husband is asking me to bake it every few days :)

Hmmm this was so yummy especially  warm out of the oven. I only had half the peaches called for so I cut the recipe and made cupcakes instead.  I pressed the dough into the cupcake holder and topped it with diced peaches and the sugar mixture.  Half the recipe made 8 short cupcakes.

This was amazing!  I did use the suggestion of switching to almond extract, which was good.  I'll definitely keep this recipe around and change out the fruits and add different toppings.  Great base recipe though!

I wasn't sure how this recipe would turn out and was pleasantly surprised. I used fresh peaches as they were in season and should have cooked them more before using them in this as they were still hard when the base was browned.  I used other reviewer's suggestions and tried almond extract and the overal taste was good, but not outstanding, although good served with custard.  Will try this again with tinned peaches instead.

Family favourite this one!

Pouring some of the juice from tinned peaches over the top before sprinkling with cinamon/sugar makes the top moister and balances out the flavour a bit.

I have made this recipie about 10 times and everyone loves it, plus it looks pretty and is super easy.  Sometimes I use apricots instead of peaches.  It is fast, easy, foolproof and reliable.  What more can you ask?

Great recipe!  Although  this is the first time I’ve made such a soft dough, it was easy. Very tasty and versatile. The second time I made it I had  about a 1/2 cup of blueberries I wanted to use up so I sprinkled them on top of the peaches. Next time I will try apples, or maybe cherries, or........mmmmm.

Oh my gosh! New favorite peach dish. I used fresh peaches and decided to sauté them a bit first to get them cooking. May not be necessary with really ripe juicy peaches but I didn’t want mine staying hard. Batter was a little sticky and didn’t spread the prettiest but don’t worry it will be delicious! Love that this is something different from a pie or cobbler. I think I prefer it to both. Make this!!

I live in kuchen-land, but this was my first ever kitchen baking. I followed the recipe for the crust, subbing lemon extract for vanilla. Don’t do that: vanilla would have been better. I used frozen fruit, put them on top partially frozen. Delicious. If you want prettier looking fruit, put the cinnamon /under/ the fruit instead of on top. 

Next time, i’ll use vanilla flavoring, and i’ll separate the cookie crust into two pans, as it was plenty thick.  Delicious.

Looked pretty, but I wouldn't make this again. The peaches were good and the crust was fine, but the final product was no better than the sum of its parts. It was basically sugary peaches on a crust. It needs some sort of custard filling to take it to the next level.

Nice recipe, but next time I think I will up the sugar in the base to 1/2 cup and perhaps reduce the sugar in top.  I used fresh peaches so perhaps the lower sugar would be enough with canned peaches.

8/18 I read the recipe and many of the reviews, and chose to follow the recipe with the addition of streusel on top.  I substituted Stevia extract (solid) for white sugar as I normally do (and find that it never has messed up a recipe).  I always use European (in this case Kerrygold Irish) unsalted butter.  I used 4 large fresh yellow freestone peaches, blanching them so that the peel would come right off (leaving beautiful pink tinted peach skin.  As for rolling out the dough, which I mixed in a stand mixer (as always), I took care of the stickiness by flouring my hands and also lightly dusting what I had spread into the bottom of the springform pan.  It worked perfectly, as I let it set overnight so that the peach juices wouldn't be runny.  My mistake?  Not being more sparing with sprinkling cinnamon.  From now on, I'll use a fine screen sieve and avoid the dark clumps.

9/2/19  I again made this with fresh freestone  yellow peaches.  This time I opted to omit the Streusel topping and left the skins on the peaches.  I also corrected the cinnamon application by having a small spoon-size seive for just this kind of dusting.  If anything, I like this better than last year's version, although I think the topping with streusel or the crumble variety is a good enough option to try on occasion.  This is so good with flavorful farmers market peaches that I can hardly imagine doing it with the blandness of canned peaches.  As far as I'm concerned it's worth the wait until peaches ar

I used a 10” springform pan so I adjusted the ingredients to accommodate the larger pan. I substituted the sugar with granulated Stevia. You only use have as much Stevia as sugar. I used fresh peaches instead of canned. I loved it, my husband loved it, and so did my Sunday School class. Thanks for the recipe. I’m making it tomorrow for my sister, kids, and grandchildren.

Made it tonight.  My family loved it!  I didn't beat the sugar and egg enough, so I made a second batch of dough and used both.  I used jarred peaches from Costco and sprinkled the top with pumpkin pie spice.  Came out perfect.  We topped it w/ice cream.

Followed advice of others, 400 degrees, 50 minutes, 5 Tbsp cornstarch, foil edges for all but last 15 min.  Great result.

9.8.17  Made today with fresh peaches (not the best I've had this year) instead of canned and was quite happy with the way this turned out.  The crust/cake was very moist, and  it has good eye appeal for something that would have been even easier had I used canned peaches.  Very nice recipe, particularly during the months when fresh peaches are not in season.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it was VERY dry!   I followed the recipe  exactly !  I did use fresh peaches and because  I had read another reviewer who said hers was dry, I even added a tablespoon of  peach  juice on the top!  The crust was very wet and I had a difficult time patting it in the pan.  I had to flour my fingers, so I wonder  if that was why!

Make sure you roll or flatten the dough out to very thin.
The "cake" part is better when you allow the juice from peaches to soak through.
Just a tip.

I loved this recipe and so did my family! So easy and so good! I didn't alter a thing. I had a couple of cherries left in my cherry bowl so I threw those on top too. I'm going to make another today and I thought I'd do a plum and nectarine one. I like that you can use different fruits to switch up the tastes. I think just about any stone fruit would be awesome on this. Thanks for the recipe!

I used canned peaches and it was really good. I had to cook mine for almost 20 minutes longer than the instructions called for, but I think it turned out perfectly.

I made it with butter instead of margarine. I used fresh peaches. Comes out great and is very easy. It is simple to arrange the peach slices in a spiral, so I recommend you do that as it makes you look like a baking genius for almost no effort and zero talent!

We loved it. Delicious with a little vanilla ice cream on top while it was still warm! Changes made: I used only half of the cinnamon sugar on the top, and I used a 9.5inch pie pan instead of the 9 inch spring form pan.  I used fresh peaches in a single layer. I will use more peaches next time and over-lap them.

I used fresh peaches and plums.  I was not sure if I should have removed their peels, but I left them on.   It was fine.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used almond extract in place of vanilla.  It smelled as delicious as it tasted.  I will make again and again.  Thank you for the recipe!

I grew up on apple  kuchen but had some peaches to use up and found this recipe.  I served it at my 4th of July party and it was a hit today!  Here are the changes I made:  I subbed 1/4 C of the flour for almond meal, used almond extract instead of vanilla, unsalted butter rather than margarine, and sprinkled the top with BROWN sugar and cinnamon!  The nutty flavor with the peach was delicious.  I will definitely make this again, and may try other fruit and flavor combinations.

Great recipe! I've made it 4 times now with both fresh peaches and fresh nectarines.  I made it as listed except I used butter instead of margarine (I don't use margarine for anything...). Turned out great every time.

I made this with fresh peaches and used enough to fill the pastry.  I chilled the dough to make it easier to handle and floured my hands when spreading the dough.  My husband gave it his best compliment--"This is Greenbrier quality!"  I am making three more today to freeze.

I used butter in this dish rather than margarine and baked it in a 9" pie pan.  I also chose to use fresh peaches rather than canned and added the last of some blueberries to the mix.  The end results was good, but somewhat on the dry side.  The batter is very thick, but I didn't have any problems spreading it in the pan using a rubber spatula.  Topped it with fresh whipped cream before serving.

This was awesome. It's quick. It's easy. I've done peaches and apples. Both ways turn out great. I recommend melting the butter margarine then there is no issues.

Very nice and not too sweet.  I made it with fresh peaches (3 in my case) and butter.  The dough was sticky, but workable.  This is more like a shortbread with fruit on top, as the size prior to baking is its size after baking.  I think it would be delightful with tea or vanilla ice cream.  The next time I'll probably try it with some Ginger, Nutmeg, or Five Spice.  The Cinnamon was good, but I think one of these would take it up a notch.  Everyone enjoyed it and it was easy to do with very few ingredients or steps, so I'll make it again for sure.

I thought I'd try making this in a pie plate (I have a pretty one I'd just washed) and it worked great. I used a 1-pound package of frozen peach slices, thawed, but they didn't quite cover the bottom of the pie plate so I put a few handfuls of blackberries and raspberries in the middle. That gave it some nice contrasting color too. I used butter instead of margarine and almond extract instead of vanilla, as others suggested. I also added a handful of sliced almonds, chopped into small pieces, to the cinnamon/sugar topping. Maybe since I used a ceramic pie plate, the kuchen was done in only 25 minutes. It's delicious and not too sweet, PERFECT with coffee or hot tea. It would make a good brunch recipe or a good dessert after a large meal since it's so light and not too filling. I believe you could use just about any fruit with good results. This recipe is a definite keeper!

"Spread dough with hands over the bottom and sides of the pan." That is impossible, since the dough turns so sticky it covers your hands like a glove. I had to add more flour to be able to handle and spread it. I am not sure how much more, since it all got kind of messy.

I used 2.5 fresh peaches, cut them in slices.  Next time I will use 3.5 peaches, diced.  Definitely use almond extract.

I may even add cream cheese to peaches.

Excellent recipe!  I made the mistake of trying to move it to another plate before it was cooled and the whole thing fell apart.  So I didn't take it to the company picnic, but my kids and my hubby devoured it.  I'll try it with other fruit next time.

Very good basic recipe, no one wants to eat the exact dish every time.   I made the first recipe exactly as stated, but when it was placed in the pan, I didn't think there was enough.  So I made a second batch, this time using almond, instead of vanilla.  I placed one batch right on top of the other.  When I found it a bit dry to work with, I added peach juice, or dripped my spatula into the juice to spread.  In the end, the cake was a bit thick for the fruit.  The next time I made it, I double the recipe, and placed it in an inch larger pan and it worked just great.  1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract is a good alternative.

So simple and tasty! I preferred this warm and thought the crust could have been a tad sweeter, but other than that it was terrific. I sprinkled brown sugar on top and added a little nutmeg (just because I enjoy those flavours). I had no trouble spreading the dough in the pan, but I used margarine instead of butter so that might have made a difference. Thanks for this, Sher15!

Perfect crust similar to a tender shortbread cookie. The recipe definitely needs to be doubled so take my advice and do not make the original one - double your ingredients and you'll be happier. Original recipe will not go up the sides of pan and if you can get it up there the bottom is paper thin. I doubled it and only spread it on the bottom and I also used butter instead of margarine. What a delicious bottom cake for just about any kind of fruit - I used canned peaches as it's winter now, but I'm looking forward to using it for the upcoming spring and summer fruits!

I made this tonight for dessert.  I HATE peaches, but I LOVED this.  I'm already planning to make it for family get togethers, and I have some ideas about other variations.

It's good, but the bottom of the kuchen is very very thin.  I'd prefer a deep dish kuchen.  Give it some doughy goodness.  This ends up being a tad crunchy when it's done.  I made mine with fresh apples (Macoun) instead of peaches.  It worked out very well, 35 mins was a perfect cooking time.

So my daughter is in kindergarten and they're doing snacks each week for the letters of the alphabet. I lucked out and got "K"... A tougher letter than I had imagined since I wanted to take something healthy. This was fabulous. I did a triple batch and used a 9x13 pan and a 8x8 pan. I followed the recipe, but I used 3 fresh peaches, sliced thin, maybe ½ cup blueberries (since we had less peaches than needed), and I omitted the sugar/cinnamon and lightly sprinkled the top with turbinado sugar. 2 kids out of 23 didn't care for it, so it was a success! Thanks for sharing, Sher15!

Very tasty!  Fresh peaches and real vanilla made it extra good.  Next time I make it I will double the batter recipe however, it was much thinner than in the picture and I would have preferred it thicker.

I had all the ingredients to make this recipe, so I figured, hey why not. I was worried that it would come out flat or not moist enough...but I decided to give it a shot anyway since it had pretty good reviews. I must say- this came out delicious. It was more than what expected. Very good! Thank you for a nice, easy recipe :)

I had to double the cake part of this to get it to fit in my spring form pan but it looked great and tasted great too.  This is a great recipe.
