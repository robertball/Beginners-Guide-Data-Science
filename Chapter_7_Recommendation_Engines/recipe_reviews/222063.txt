I liked this and really wasn't sure what to think at first. I followed the recipe exactly except using 1 percent milk and plain instant coffee, which worked fine. I also just mixed the honey in with the milk, but I liked that it still wasn't too sweet. After taking it from the fridge, I wasn't too happy with it at first. The chia seed texture was just so odd. The seeds were a mix of a gel and crunchy texture which did not work for me. However, I decided to stick the pudding in the vitamix to whip it up. I normally use chia seeds in smoothies with no problem. It made the pudding nice and smooth at about 30 seconds on high. Chia seeds are so good for the stomach and I have not had any indigestion, today, which I normally do. I will definitely make this again, but double it to get more than 2 servings, and definitely blend it all together again when it is done chilling in the fridge. ty

This is so delicious! I've made it with white sugar, sugar substitutes, and coconut sugar - and also with almond and soy milk. All work wonderfully!

My new favorite dessert. I add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla as well. Allow the mixture to sit at room temp for an hour versus 30 mins to speed up liquid absorption (the seeds swell faster at warm temps). In addition, microwave the milk for a minute to warm it up before stirring it into the dry ingredients. It better dissolves the sugar and speeds up the absorption as well. Absolutely FABULOUS dessert. Must try it!

I loved this recipe.  I did change it alittle.  I used Nutella instead of the hazelnut coffee powder and Splenda plus a little vanilla instead of the brown sugar.  It was fabulous.  I plan to make this on a regular basis.

This is good!  It felt like a science experiment while I was making it, but it's no cook, chia seeds are incredibly good for you, and the end result reminded me of tapioca pudding (but with much better flavor).  I did leave the honey off because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  Plus, my 10 year old daughter loved it too--I'll make this again.

Though this pudding didn't taste bad, it didn't thicken up nearly as much as it should have even after an entire day and night in the fridge, and the chia seeds added an awkward texture that I didn't like. The seeds didn't get soft enough, so there were crunches here and there. I also didn't like that no vanilla is added, as I feel it gives it a fuller taste.

However, I did add some chia seeds to the "Chocolate Cornstarch Pudding" recipe, also on this site, while cooking and it actually turned out very good! The chia seeds were completely soft and turned out like tapioca, the pudding was thick, and the taste wasn't compromised. This recipe here is just okay, but if you're looking to add a health boost to a yummy pudding, I recommend using the traditional cooked cornstarch pudding and just throwing in some chia seeds.

Absolutely delicious! I used a combo of unsweetened almond milk/organic 2%, whisked the honey into the milk as well as splashed in a little vanilla. Easy to throw together!  As chia seed lovers, DD and I gobbled this up after dinner tonight. I'll definitely double or triple this nifty little treat for next time a little dessert craving arises!

Instead of cocoa powder, I used four tablespoons of MOCAFE Mexican spiced hot chocolate mix. Then I decided not to use brown sugar. I put in a small amount of mini chocolate chips and I didn't read to drizzle the honey, but we had some wild flower raw honey so I used 2 teaspoons of that. Also instead of milk, I used coconut milk and of course a quarter cup of chia seeds. I did not use any coffee mix.

This was sooooo good!  Perfect afternoon sweet treat.  As another reviewer suggested I used unsweetened almond milk and splenda brown sugar.  I had a packet of tasters choice instant hazelnut coffee on hand, so I threw that in and I think that enhanced the chocolate flavor.  I also blended the mixture in my magic bullet as suggested by another reviewer.  I actually made the mixture in the magic bullet cup so when it was done in the frig I just screwed on the blades and blended. I did add a few chopped walnuts - reminded me of fudge!  Very tasty - will definitely make again.

I love this chia seed pudding!  Reminds me of tapioca pudding but chocolate and with tiny little crunchies that I did not find unpleasant, too much, or distracting in any way. To me the crunchies were like little tiny bits of cookie crumbs. I used half coconut milk and half cow's milk and sweetened only with coconut sugar (very similar in taste to light brown sugar) to taste. Before serving I stir it up and added a little more milk to loosen it.  I didn't think I would like it as much as I did but I really do love it! Can't wait to experiment with other flavors! Thanks Robynowitz for a great recipe.

Very versatile!!  I made this using one 8oz carton chocolate soy milk and 1/4 cup chia seeds.  I also made it with 8oz of sugar-free orange drink (store brand Tang) and 1/4 cup chia seeds.  The orange version reminds me of Tapioca Fruit Juice Dessert my mom used to make us as kids.  Next I am going to try with Apple juice and cinnamon.  AWESOME

This was so good!  I was expecting tolerable (chia seeds after all!) but it was fabulous.  I will never buy an artificial food/ flavor laden box of instant pudding again.  I used the recipe as stated but added some coconut flakes - no coffee either.  I used 2% milk and my batch thickened perfectly.  I have a batch in the refrigerator now for tomorrow!

I have made this many, many times no. When you add the milk, add 1/4 cup first and stir to make a thick syrup. Then add the rest of the milk and stir well. This helps to avoid any clumps.

I am diabetic and had to make some changes to lower the carbs. I declined the honey and the brown sugar, and sweetened it only with 4 packets of Splenda instead. After 48 hours the pudding was still crunchy, I guess because the chia seeds never fully soften. It was interesting, though - will probably make again.

Not only is this such a healthy and easy recipe but it's also delicious! It's difficult to eat healthy when you're a student living on your own with little time to cook. But this is a great solution for my constant chocolate cravings!
I didn't have brown sugar so I used white, and I used almond milk instead of regular milk. It was also a little bit too chocolatey for my liking so I've started adding less cocoa powder and a little bit more milk.

I substituted 1 Tbsp Maple syrup (the real stuff) for one of the tablespoons of brown sugar. And left out the coffee. I loved it. My kids had an issue with the texture so next time I plan to blend it in my Vitamix to see if that helps.

This was easy to make and delicious (left out the coffee powder). I wish I had a blender to follow other reviewers. I also used 1/2 the chia seeds since we were just beginning to start using it, and didn't realize how it was going to affect the final product's structure - it was really watery. Will use the full amount next time.  Made with skim milk with no issues (warmed a minute as someone else mentioned to help with the chia swell).

So I guess I actually made a different recipe, but I didn't have any cocoa so opted for vanilla pudding.  I used 1/2 cup almond milk, 2 T chia seeds, a couple drops vanilla, some organic golden raisins and a few unsalted pumpkin seeds.  I did add a pack of domino sugar/stevia blend and it was just the right amount of sweetness.  I'll have to get use to the tapioca texture and may try blending it like another reviewer said.  I will also try the chocolate pudding as soon as I buy some.  I ate this pudding for breakfast.  It was very filling.

This was very good, but it seems like a lot more chia seeds than I expected. I've made overnight oatmeal with a Tablespoon of chia seeds, but that's an entirely different thing than this. The texture is smooth like pudding with a chia type of crunch. It's a bit different than I thought it would be, but it's very delicious. I used high grade cocoa powder which gave it a very deep, rich flavor, along with coconut sugar. It's also very filling, which is nice for a hearty snack. Try it and see what you think!

I used this as a base and it came out fantastic ---  16 ounces unsweetened almond cocount milk + 1/2 cup chia seeds , soak overnight.  Next day, add 4 packets of Stevia, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 scoop protein powder.  Mix in food processor.  Divide in bell jars.  Top with raspberries and chopped nuts.

I'm love this recipe. I tripeled the recipe and add 1/3 cup honey before storing as well as drizzle honey just before serving. I also used Coconut Milk in place of regular milk which makes it creamier. It's addicting.

i made this last night, and as of this morning it has not thickened, still a milky consistency.

i followed others suggestions and heated the milk for 30 secs in the microwave, let sit at room temp for an hour and added vanilla to round out the flavor.  i did omit the brown sugar and used 2 packets of sweet-n-low, but that should not have an effect on it thickening.  

the flavor was alright.  too much cocoa for my tastes but that may be tempered by adding the brown sugar next time.  i omitted it to keep the carbs down.  i will keep experimenting.

Delicious. Doesn't even need the honey, but it is good with it to for a sweeter taste. I substituted the milk for 1/2 almond milk and 1/2 coconut milk, then topped it with whipped coconut milk. Thank you for this wonderful lighter dessert recipe.

I make this at least once a week for a snack at work. I have never added the coffee but I follow the recipe exactly and it's perfect. It is missing a little excitement (coconut maybe?) that's why it gets 4 stars. Healthy and good though!

I did this with Splenda and almond milk. No hazelnut or coffee as I can't stand either.  I did add bourbon vanilla and a spoon of nutella (I know it's hazelnut but I like it).  It turned out great!

Made 4 servings. I just made this recipe and I can't wait to taste it in 2 hours or even overnight. I had to make some alterations because I was a little short on the cocoa powder. To make up the difference, I used Nutella for the remaining cocoa powder and also for the lack of hazelnut flavored instant coffee. I did use the same amount of regular instant coffee as the recipe stated. Even before it became gelatinous, I was licking the spoon. So good and the kids loved it too. Next time I would like to put it in blender after stirring and get a smoother texture.

I made this today for the first time and it is pretty good. I am lactose intolerant so I used cashew milk instead of milk, vanilla, dark cocoa, and just a touch of my plain instant coffee and it turned out great. There were only a few seeds with a slight crunch and it was not distracting enough to not eat it; it actually gave some texture.

Delicious, easy and fun to make. This was a perfect introduction to chia seeds for my fussy 9-year-old and 'health food-averse' husband - especially since I used Valrhona cocoa. The texture was perfect - thick and creamy.

Wow!  I made this omitting the sugar and adding a splash of REAL maple syrup.  I also used almond milk and added instant coffee, coconut and crushed pecans.  I let it sit over night, then added more milk and cocoa to get it creamy.  I also didn't finish it in one sitting, so after it sat another night, I added more milk and cocoa and liked it even better!!  My chia seeds just kept soaking up the moisture making creamy, nutritious deliciousness!  So filling and satisfying, I'm making this for life!!!

I made it with a few adjustments.  I'm not a fan of the texture of chia seeds so I blended it with the cocoa powder.  I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar and added this along with vanilla essence and milk to the dry ingredients and blended further which helped it to thicken up. I can't wait to have this for breakfast tomorrow with some sliced strawberries

I pretty much followed the recipe as-is (didn't have honey so I subbed for white sugar, since I was also extremely low on brown sugar) and I absolutely love this recipe! I'm not a picky eater by any means and I wasn't eating this with the thought that it was "health food" (which I think helped, if you think it's gonna taste gross, it's gonna taste gross ladies), I just wanted a different chocolate snack and saw this idea on a subreddit I follow. Go ahead, laugh. I actually had no idea that chia was such a super food (when it comes to food trends, yes, I live under a rock) until I googled why this recipe had so many calories! Oddly they're really high calorie but also nutrient dense so I suppose it is worth the trade-off. It was so tasty to me that I've eaten two servings, hope it doesn't make my stomach mad! Definitely similar to tapioca, yes there is a bit of a crunch, but I still thought it was tasty. Similar to munching on raspberries to me, in fact that'd be a delightful mix in!

I have made this pudding many times with a few variations.  I use an organic  high quality cacao powder,  organic coconut palm sugar, a touch of pure Canadian maple syrup and Dark Chocolate Almond Milk.  It really kicks up the chocolate level.  I also add chopped walnuts.   This makes a great breakfast as well as a dessert.  I can really feel an improvement to my energy level with this nutritious food.  (my health issues respond favorably to all organic/non GMO).

This pudding is a great source of protein and was enjoyed by my husband who normally hates "health food." I found it was sweet enough without the honey, and also added half coconut milk and half 2% milk to make it a bit more healthy. This pudding tastes great and I'll be making it regularly for breakfast!

This was uh-mazing!!  I halved the recipe so it would only be 264 calories and ate it for breakfast with some fruit.  The two changes I made were using Maxwell House International Cafe Francais instant coffee and only 1/2 teaspoon of honey, as it was plenty sweet enough with that.  I think I'll try making this again tonight with some frozen strawberries and almond extract in place of the cocoa powder.

This is excellent.  I doubled the recipe since it said it was single serving, but its very filling and would have served two easily. I used vanilla extract instead of inst.  coffee. I  took the advice of another reviewer and warmed the milk before mixing in. This worked great and it thickened right up. Was able to eat it within the 2 hours stated. I used organic chia, dont know if that had anything to do with that.  Didnt need any honey, it was plenty sweet. A very healthy treat!!

This pudding was surprisingly good. I wasn't sure how I'd do with the texture and this was my first time making a chia seed pudding. The texture wasn't bad at all and it was perfectly sweet. Definitely will make this again in the future.

I crave sweets on a daily basis, but I'm trying to loose weight.  This really made me feel good about having something that tasted so good!

I made this for my family and all of my family members but one liked it.  It was so sweet that I left the honey out.  When I first tasted it, I was surprised at how much it tastes like the store bought pudding, except for the texture.

I made a powder of the chia seeds first with my Vitamix.  Then mixed all ingredients according to directions.  The "pudding" firmed up quickly  with no clumps or crunch, and I even had to add more milk.  Also added some melted coconut oil.  Whisked it all together.  It was a little bitter--don't know if that's from grinding the seeds.  It took quite a bit of Stevia to make it palatable.  I will try it next time without grinding the seeds and compare the taste.  Also may add some coconut on top before I eat it.

Love this recipe.  Very easy and healthy.  Make it with whatever milk you have on hand.  I added vanilla per other reviews, thank you.  Omitted the honey and reduced brown sugar to 1 tablespoon, but added about 2 teaspoon equivalent of stevia.

Has a great taste, I like the crunchy texture. Would consider adding even more chia seeds next time.

I tried this and it was dreadful!  The chia seeds stayed quite hard.  I soaked it longer and even put it in the blender.  Still lots of hard bits!  What did I do wrong??

Yum! I'm always looking for ways to use chia and this is a tasty option. I used rapadura instead of brown sugar since that's what I had. Also, I didn't use the coffee powder and it was still great.

Chia seeds have  NO FLAVOR so some way to impart some flavor is sorely needed. Tapico-esque type of consistency.

This is awesome. My 8 yr. old didn't like the texture, but I loved it. I am going to try it with different flavors next time. Thanks for sharing this.
