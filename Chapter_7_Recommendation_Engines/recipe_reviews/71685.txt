I have been making this recipe for year's.  It is excellent.  One change however, I use a deep dish pie plate or quiche dish instead of an 11x13 pan.  There is never any leftover's.

Great idea to mix the taco seasoning with the sour cream, yum!  Substituted guacamole instead of avocados the layer before the sour cream.  I also mixed only half the salsa with the beans (added beef)and put the rest on top at the end.  GREAT DIP and filling too

Fixed this one for a football tailgate... Everyone LOVED it!  We had people from neighboring tailgates coming over to try it too. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Over all a good basic recipe for 7-layer dip. A whole packet of taco seasoning is very over powering. Next time I will only use half the packet. I also did not use a whole jar of salsa, which I am glad because it would have been too much.

This is definately a crowd pleaser!!!  I've been making this for the past 2 years now.  Instead of cubed avocado, I make a avocado dip just by simply mashing together avocado, salt, pepper, onions, and garlic powder.  Sometimes I just omit the avocado all together depending on who I prepare it for.

Awesome, always a hit! I add a little browned ground beef for some heartiness.
Serve with blue and white corn chips, goes fast.

This was so good.  Used light sour cream.  I forgot to buy green onions and omited the avocados but will definetly put them in next time.  A definite crowd pleaser.

This is a great party dip -- easy to make & "hearty"!  Plus, the avocados really make it-

I have enjoyed this recipe many times before; aside from being simple and rather fun to make, it tastes exceptionally good, and is a real crowd-pleaser. It is also easy to modify for health/diet restrictions, "heat" lovers, etc.

YUM!! I made this for the superbowl and it was gone in 20 minutes!! I did make some changes though..I used vegetarian refried beans, and diced some jalapeno to mix in with the sour cream/cream cheese. I used a yellow onion instead of the green onions and cut out the avacado all together (i'm not a big fan). The end result was delicious!!! Will be making again!

This dip was pretty good, but it didn't stand out to me. It was also a little watery the first day, and even worse the next day. I used fresh salsa from the deli, so maybe that's why. If I make this again, I'll drain the salsa well before using it, and cut back a little on the taco seasoning.

Great recipe. I simply warm the refried beans for 30secs in the microwave and then mix in the salsa and continue on with the recipe. We also prefer it without the lettuce.

I take this to most gatherings!  It's always a hit.  I omit the avacados, though.  I brown some hamburger meat, season it with a little taco seasoning and put it on the bottom of the dish...it's wonderful!

I did not make this with everything and I will make sure to do that next time.

It's a little on the spicy side, but easy.
