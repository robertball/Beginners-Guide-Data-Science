Excellent!!! Big hit at my party. I used less cheddar cheese, and think that next time I might eliminate it altogether. I used thawed, frozen salad shrimp. Thanks for sharing.

My mom has made this recipe for years and everyone always loves it. Only change is we've never used cheese on it......it's great without it.

Easy and delicious! Room temp or chilled, served with Ritze crackers. Use a butter knife if chilled.

I used cooked small shrimp (chopped) instead of can I think this is key.  The dish needs that crunch this provides instead of the mushiness you get out of a can. All around fun and tasty dish but the cheddar gets lost to the cream cheese so it is really only for looks.

I made this as a quick and easy appetizer and it turned out really well. I cut the recipe in half and it was perfect for 4-6 adults.
