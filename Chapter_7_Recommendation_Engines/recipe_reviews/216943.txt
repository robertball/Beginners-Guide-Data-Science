My husband -- who hates chicken with an unnatural passion the likes of which one only expects to encounter in relation to the usual suspects: anchovies, liver, random Kardashians, and the like -- THAT guy had this to say of this recipe: "Wow. That's good chicken. And you know it pains me to say that." And THEN, my 11 y.o. kid ate an unprecedented THREE servings of a non-dessert-related dish. It was like I won the Mom Olympics tonight. Got recruited on the Chinese team and plain won that thing. Many thanks for the recipe. I didn't have the fancy Chinese chili, so I used run-of-the-mill chili powder. Also, I put a broil on the last few minutes to give it a bit of edge. Apparently, it was all magic.

This is my new go-to meal to cook when I am delivering a meal to someone else.  I make it with brown rice (throw in a couple of chicken bouillon cubes with the rice water and finish with fresh parsley.  I use chicken thigh fillets--skinless and boneless.  I also have made this so often that I don't waste the precious sauce by marinating the meat at all!  I baste the meat a few times and save the yummy asian sauce to drizzle over the rice.  This is seriously the best chicken recipe I've ever made! Enjoy!

NO need to double the sauce, just reserve the marinate and pour into a sauce pan making sure you boil 5 minutes.  Use some cornstarch to thicken if needed. Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over the chicken before baking. No need to discard the marinate when you can just use as the sauce.  Also can cut back on the Sesame oil ( I used slightly less than 1/4 cup). Did not find this very spicy.  I marinated in the fridge for 24 hours and yum the meat really absorbed the flavor. Popped it in the oven the following night and it was a fast and easy meal. Used legs and thighs that I skinned removing as much fat as I could. Just make sure you bring the sauce back to a boil for 1 to 2 minutes after chicken is done. There will be sauce from the cooked chicken left in the casserole dish which you can use for extra sauce. Served it over sticky rice with green peas.  Will definately make again. Thank you for a delicious recipe Essanaye.

Very good!  I used apple cider vinegar instead of the rice vinegar which give it a sweeter taste but helped cool the spicy ingredients. Made an island rice with coconut milk, peas, lime juice and cilantro.  Good combination. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Very tasty! I used regular chicken thighs instead and I cooked for 30 mins on 350, basted the chicken and cooked for another 20 mins. It had a wonderful golden color. I served it with chicken fried rice & steamed broccoli. I will make this again!

I doubled the sauce recipe and otherwise cooked it exactly as the recipe reads.  It was delicious!  We loved having the extra sauce to eat over sticky rice.  Served the chicken and rice with an oriental green salad and will definately keep this in my "favorites" file.

Just made this tonight, and it turned out pretty nicely. It is quite spicy, so if you're spice-phobic, you can cut it in half. Not sure if it was the particular oil I used, but it's flavor overpowered the other ingredients in the marinade so I would recommend a bit less or non-toasted oil. I also cooked the marinade longer on very low heat while the chicken was in the oven so it could caramelize a bit more. Used drumsticks and thighs. Yum!

I didn't have asian chili garlic sauce but went ahead and made this and sub'd hoisin sauce instead and it tasted great. I doubled the sauce for dipping both the chicken and veggies I made.

Amazing!!!  The only change I made was to reduce the oil by half - because its such a strong flavor.  I cut up 6 chicken breasts into small pieces and marinated for the night.  I transferred chicken to a frying pan with a slotted spoon and cooked it on high.  I made a second batch of marinade and boiled that in a pan.  I then added some cornstarch/water mix to the marinade to thicken.  Once the chicken started to brown, I poured the marinade over it and let it simmer for 5 mins.  Served over rice ---- AMAZING!  Thanks for sharing this.

This was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Chicken fell apart tenderly, the sauce taste was amazing.  I know how folks on this site don't care for folks to "add their own twist" to recipes, and I agree... but, in this instance, I was out of a couple of ingredients so I subbed other items and it still turned out great.  I didn't have rice vinegar, so I used a 1/4 white vinegar.  Used regular sesame seed oil (didn't have any "Asian" style) and had no green onion for garnish.  Instead I used diced white onion and put on the chicken as it was cooking.  FABULOUS!!!  Can't wait to try it again!

A delicious recipe!  I was a little skeptical at first, but the marinade turned out terrific!  I left the chicken in the fridge a little longer than an hour and used a splash of chili powder instead of the chili garlic sauce because my local grocery stores didn't have what the recipe called for. :(  But it still turned out great!  My roommate really enjoyed it, and I will definitely make this again.  Served over sticky rice, and the chopped green onions definitely gave it a nice kick of flavor!

We enjoyed this sauce very much. Very tasty. My husband is Asian so I increased the chili sauce. Next time I make it, I'm going to increase the recipe for the sauce. As it is, it is just enough but I like a little extra.

The sauce is delicious!  Fearing it would be too spicy, I used just 2 t. of the chili garlic sauce.  It wasn't quite spicy enough so I've just made the sauce again using 1 T. of the chili garlic sauce.  I think that will be perfect for most of my family.  I did use 3 lbs. of skinless, boneless chicken breasts which I cut into 1 inch squares.  I marinated them for close to 2 hours before grilling.  The sauce wasn't enough (DS just loved it over his rice) which is why I had to make more today for the leftovers.  Next time, I will definitely double the sauce.  I may make the sauce just to keep on hand for a quick meal.

this was good, but i thought it needed something...maybe fresh ginger in the sauce/marinade or toasted sesame seeds or chopped peanuts sprinkled on top for crunch...

I made this, simplifying it quite a bit.  I skipped marinating this altogether.  I made half of the marinade, heating it on the stovetop and then thickening it with a water/cornstarch slurry, just enough to give it some nice body.  Hubs grilled boneless skinless chicken breast halves, and used the thickened marinade as a basting sauce, which worked beautifully.  This was so much simpler than making the recipe as written.  I would make it again the same way.  I served this with Sesame Noodle Salad, also from this site.

This tastes great and even better the next day.  The amount of marinade could be reduced to 1/2 or 2/3 and it would still be plenty.  I wasn't sure if the recipe intended to have the marinade poured into the baking dish with the chicken.  I did include it but next time I will only put a little bit into the pan.  Then I would baste as directed.  My chicken thighs cooked in 20-25 minutes.  Next time I will try this on chicken breast or even on pork.  Thank you Essayane for the great recipe!  UPDATE: This works well on pork chops.  I marinated all day the pan seared boneless pork loin chops.

This was delicious. I used the general idea and altered a couple of ingredients that I didn't have on hand. I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it, and it turned out great!

I loved this chicken, but the sauce was way too spicy for my liking.  I used chicken thigh cutlets and let it marinade most of the day.  The chicken was really good, and I ate two pieces (which is unheard of) Because these were cutlets, they only took only a fraction of the baking time.  I think it was so spicy because of the "Asian chili garlic sauce".  It is very spicy.  I knew that 3 T. would be way too much, so I only used 1, and used 2 of an Thai Sweet Chili Sauce I had. I will say, that despite my lips burning when I ate the sauce on my rice, and my decision to not eat the sauce after that experience, MY FAMILY loved it.  They obviously like heat.

Marinate thighs in the sauce, then roast thighs in oven.  Pour all the sauce (microwave it first) over thighs and bake another 15 minutes.  SOOOOO GOOD.  Don't altar ingredients!

Like others, I thought there was way too much sesame oil so I only added a few drops. I decided to marinate this longer so I left out the vinegar and marinated for a few hours. I scored the chicken thighs with a knife to let the marinade seep in. I added the vinegar when I made the sauce on the stove, and cooked the marinade from the chicken as well. I used far less chili oil as my kids were eating this, so we just served it with hot sauce on the side for us adults! My husband and I loved it, my picky kids not so much but they ate most of it! ;) I think next time I'll add a bit of ginger since I left out most of the chili oil, to make even more delish!

I read the description, and got a bit worried about the combination, But it was terrific. Hubby, who hates spicy, loved it. Son, who hates thighs, chowed down. I'm glad I didn't mess with the ingredients. 

A few notes, though, for newbie cooks. Thighs are a bit fatty. Take the time to cut off the fat (as much as possible) and extra skin, if you keep it on. I used a roaster pan, and put a wire rack in it, to keep the drippings away as the chicken cooked. Make sure to spray some nonstick oil on it, or you'll be cleaning up for hours. 

I brushed the marinade on every 10 minutes, mostly because I liked the taste. I did thicken it with cornstarch first. After the 30 minutes were up, I set the oven to 450 degrees, and toasted the top of the marinade covered skin. 

Voila. Incredibly tasty and moist chicken.

I made the sauce and was sad to find out that it required nearly the same ingredients as a teryaki sauce I made in the past and did NOT like.  Although I had to substitute 5tbs of Honey with 3tbs of... Pancake Syrup and I didn't have the garlic/chili paste so I substituted 1-2tbs of chili powder. No rice vinegar so I used Apple Vinegar and I added a tbs of Ground Mustard Seed and a dash or two of fine pepper.

It smelled just like the teryaki sauce I hated, but when it is cooked and glazed onto the chicken it tastes SO AWESOME! Because of the smell I gave it a 4 but the flavor was a 5!  I made fried rice to accompany this dish and it all went together well.

These were incredible. I used 2 32 ounce packages of chicken drumsticks, and doubled the marinade recipe. My three year old ate 3 drumsticks, and readily ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Awesome...if I could give it 10 stars, I would. I decreased the sesame oil to about 5 T, but kept the rest of the ingredients as written. I marinated it in the fridge for 24 hours and cooked on the grill. We both prefer this to BBQ chicken. The flavor was off the charts. I plan on using the left over marinade that was rendered down on the stove top with pork chops in the oven.

I think the ingredients as to "Asian Chili Garlic Sauce" could be more clear, as it's pretty generic and many Asian cultures have a version of chili garlic sauce. What does that mean? Korean Gochujang? Sriracha? or Sweet Thai Chili sauce? I have all three and I assumed the recipe called for Siriracha, because it is the most common of the three. This was the wrong choice. It was much too spicy, and I tolerate spice pretty well. I think the Sweet Thai Chili sauce or even the Gochujang was the route to go. So those of you wondering, unless you're obsessed with Sriracha, go with the Sweet Thai Chili sauce.

Good recipe, made as prescribed. Had to substitute rice vinegar; used balsamic.Used whole chicken cut to 10pc, by far the thighs and legs were the best.
OOOPS
Just noticed I used Sambal Oelek (1tbs ground fresh chili paste) for the 3 tablespoons Asian chili garlic sauce. 
When I do this again, I will add 1tbs of liquid smoke, just to help balance the flavors.

Wow!  This was SOOOOO good.  This was finger licking good chicken.  We used the extra sauce for shrimp a couple of days later. 
As is, this recipe is only good for a marinade.  For a finished sauce, I added cornstarch and cooked until sauce thickened.

Nice flavours. Not quite a five-star, but four-and-a-half for sure. Simple dish that the family loved. I added grated ginger and reduced the chili garlic to 1 tbsp, so the kids would enjoy. Thanks for sharing. I'll make it again

Very tasty, but wow these had quite a kick to them! The next time I will cut the chile sauce in half. DH liked it but could hardly eat his as it was too spicy for him. I used boneless chicken that I cut into strips. This was great and I will fix it again with less heat.

2/14 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/216943/asian-glazed-chicken-thighs/ ... So here I am ready to brag I made the recipe exactly only to find out I FORGOT the vinegar! :O ... Well, she said :D, I liked it - without the vinegar. I even HAVE the vinegar, just didn't write it down. We-e-ell, hmmmm, I still liked it. I marinated, but didn't follow baking directions. Darn! I forgot the VINEGAR! Darn. As I made it, not too sweet or spicy. WHY'D I forget the vinegar?! ... Update: winged the amount & added to the sauce. Pretty yummy still - & maybe it WAS a little too sweet - but NOT by much - & not too vinegary either (if I winged right :D) 'Going to thicken & mix leftovers with rice!... 7/14 'Measured everything as listed except for 2T sesame oil - & results are: more vinegar or less honey. I ran out of rice wine vinegar & couldn't take out some of the honey, but that's the plan for next time. What I figure, too, is that probably 3T cornstarch is the right amount to thicken the sauce - for about 2# thighs. Just upped another star: K, 15, keeps requesting it. Yay! 8/14 1/4c honey, 1/3c soy, 1/2c vinegar, 3T chile garlic sauce, 2T sesame oil. I only decreased honey by 1T & it maybe, maybe could use more. I think my new bottle of rice wine vinegar may be more vinegar-y than the last one. Good, too. One cup uncooked rice is a good amount for single recipe. :)  Note:

This is an excellent recipe.  You'll make it over and over, so you'll use up that chili-garlic sauce and sesame oil even if you don't use them for anything else.  
I didn't even use as much honey as the recipe calls for (4 scant tablespoons) because I used very good orange blossom honey and it was delicious. 
Rice and a salad of cole slaw (or julienned veges) with an Asian dressing complete the meal.  I use an Asian Sesame Dressing.

Definitely one of our favorites.  That being said, we weren't as much a fan of baking vs grilling.  This marinade/sauce is fantastic and caramelizes beautifully on the grill with either chicken parts or boneless skinless thighs.  I tried it with both rice wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar, I suggest going with it as written.  Also the garlic chili sauce added is a must.  I do now cut the oil in half, but I have made it both ways. Excellent recipe!

Very yummy. Somehow I ended up with too much liquid, probably because I baked the chicken instead of grilling or roasting. I basted about 4 times thought so the chicken did have a nice sticky coating.

The sauce really is fantastic, and as good, if not better than anything I've had an Asian restaurant.  I nearly went into shock when I saw the price of the sesame oil at the grocery store, so I just used regular vegetable oil, and it was still great.

Left the chicken in 5 minutes longer, but still had to cook it in the microwave a few minutes before I could eat it.  Next time, I will cook it for 45 minutes and just keep an eye the last 10 so it won't burn.  Thanks for the recipe.

this was really tasty.. we marinated this for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours and i think it would have been a lot better for even longer.. i cut this recipe in half and used three very large chicken thighs that could have passed for breasts.. i left out the honey and added a heaping tablespoon of chopped ginger.. i cut the sesame oil in half as others suggested.. i had bf grill these outside on the george foreman as i didn't want the oven heating up the house and i didn't feel like cooking this in the wok.. i boiled the excess marinade and used it to steam/sautee some veggies.. served with some rice and had a complete meal.. i told bf i think this would have gone better with some ramen noodles or some other kind of asian noodle.. he agreed.. i can't wait to try this again with a longer marinating time.. ty for the recipe

It tasted good but I was disappointed because it didn't look like the picture with a beautiful glaze.  The chicken looked like any other bland baked chicken with soft skin so I broiled it for a few minutes after baking to give it some crispness on the outside.  If you want to have the picture look you have to add a slurry of water and cornstarch to get the sauce thicker when boiling it.  Marinating is a must in this recipe to get the favors into the chicken.

we love this at our house. we broil it b/c we don't own a grill at this time. sometimes we adjust the honey, sweet chili, and garlic to suit our tastes, but other than that, we pretty much stick to the recipe.

Nice outcome for little work, definitely a "keeper". Made twice now, with changes due to comments, pantry and a 1st try. It's very easy to tweak the spice level for your own heat tolerance. We (a hot family) didn't think it was hot. IMO, the most critical change is to marinate longer if you can; 1 hour didn't do much, but 4+ is great. We don't like a lot of oil, so I reduced that to 2 TBSP, and I didn't have sesame oil so I used 1 TBSP sesame seeds the first time (okay), and tahini the second (really good). I did need to add some flour to thicken the sauce to my liking. I added clementine orange sections to the garnish the 2nd time which I'll do again. Yum!

Very good blend of flavors.  Will marinate longer than one hour next time and may add some cornstarch when cooking marinade for glaze.   I used bone-in thighs and cooked an extra 10 minutes.

It was fantastic. I Didn't have rice vinegar so I mixed white and apple cider and it gave it an extra tang. I also didn't have the chili sauce,so I added red pepper flakes and instead of sesame oil I added sesame seeds. Also in the part where one cooks the glace, I added 1tbs of brown sugar while simmering and 1 tbs of spicy Dijon mustard, also some more pepper flakes. Didn't disappoint at all!

I didn't have the asian 
chile sauce so substituted Bangkok peanut sauce and added some fresh cilantro- I could have drank the sauce it was so good.I also added fresh lime juice (of one lime) then I grilled instead of baked

Amazing stuff! I grilled these so I made the sauce, brought to a boil and added 1T cornstarch added to a 1/4 cup cold water to thicken a bit. The thighs cook relatively quickly so I painted them before putting on the grill and each time turned. The thighs had beautiful grill marks and the sauce adhered nicely. I served with steamed broccoli and steamed rice drizzled with extra sauce. These were so good, Hubs asked me to grill up a bunch to have in the fridge for lunches. Thank you!

I grilled the chicken thighs and they were amazing. I served them to my family and two of my sons friends and they all loved it. I served mine with an Asian rice pilaf. This recipe is definitely a keeper. It turned out sweet/spicy/and bit smoky.

Yum, came across this recipe trying to use up my chili garlic sauce in the fridge and used it on some chicken tenders from the freezer.  Add some veggies and serve over rice and it's a winner!  Thanks for sharing!

I've tried this recipe two ways-- as written, which is excellent! And the other time I browned up some ground chicken and then added the sauce and ate it in lettuce wraps and on top up noodles. Both ways are delish!

We really likied this.  I didn't have Asian chili sauce so I used Sambal Olek which when I googled stated it was pretty close.  I doubled all the ingredients for more sauce except the soy sauce, (1.5) just in case it was too salty.  I will be making this again.

Soooo yummy! The marinade is fantastic-just the perfect kick of sweet&spicy tingle. I served this with the usual brown rice and a mandarin orange/sliced almond/green onion salad. This is going to be a weekly treat in our family! You could use this marinade for so many different meats as well as to kick up a side dish-my guys put a bit over the rice!

I didn't care for this.  I did follow the directions as stated.  I didn't think it was too spicy as the others stated.  Also, this didn't reduce like I thought it should have.  The chicken was very pretty coming out of the oven.  I can't really add anything to do to make it better.  Maybe it was just my tastebuds.

Delicious! Definitely worth making again. The only critique I might have is that it's a tad salty. I used barbecue sauce  instead of honey because I didn't have any honey and it was great.

Just letting everyone know this works in the crockpot too.  I want to try it in the oven for the "sticky, carmalized" feel, but yesterday I had no time so I mixed the sauce, poured it over some thighs and drumsticks in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 7 hours.  I used high because my meat was still pretty frozen.  Served the falling apart chicken and sauce over rice and it was a hit with whole family.  Served with butter garlic broccoli from this site.  Yum.

I absolutely love this recipe. At first after making and tasting the sauce I thought it had bit too much sesame flavor, wasn’t expecting great results. But boy o boy. That thickened sauce was everything. I used Maggi sweet chili sauce because that’s what I had and love. I also used 12 thighs which I trimmed the fat from and marinated overnight. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Please use-the toasted sesame oil. Next

Scaled down recipe by about 1/2 as I only had a couple of thighs. Also didn't have Asian chili sauce so subbed Heinz chili sauce. Everything else as written. Turned out great!  Thighs were on sale so I'm making full recipe again this weekend!  Will probably add a few drops of sriracha to the sauce, dw is not a big fan of spicy. Will serve over rice, most likely jasmine as I'm obsessed with the stuff, and broccoli. Can't wait!!

Loved it and will make it again. BUT I am used to less salt these days so I won't salt to taste at all next time and cut back a bit on the soy sauce. I think I'll also cut back on the oil as others have suggested and thicken the sauce with some cornstarch as others have suggested as well. Very good.

This was excellent.   Didn't change ingredients except for using bone in legs and thighs.   Put chicken and marinade in sprayed baking dish.  Baked 30 minutes, then added some glaze on top and baked an additional 20 minutes as was suggested by another reviewer.  With remaining mixture, I microwaved it in glass bowl about 2 minutes, stirred, and cooked about another 2 minutes until thickened.  When chicken was done, I removed the pieces  to a plate, poured the pan juices in with microwaved sauce.  Stirred and heated up to a boil, then added 3 T. of cornstarch that was mixed with about 1//4 cup cold water.  Poured cornstarch mixture in, stirred, then microwaved about a minute and it thickened up nicely.  I placed chicken back in dish and poured sauce mixture over all.  Sorry this is wordy, thought it may be a help to someone.  We loved it.

This is consistently good - even with various substiutions.  Like white wine for vinegar; olive oil instead of sesame oil; worchester sauce for soy sauce; regular chili sauce instead of an asian one.    Marinate or not.  Still remains a good recipe.

My family loved this recipe! My son in particular was especially complimentary of this recipe. A great side dish pairing with this recipe is Sweet and Crunchy Salad, also available at the allrecipes website. I did not have time before supper to marinate the chicken. Still, the flavor was excellent. Next time, I will marinate the chicken overnight, which will no doubt provide an even more impressive taste explosion. I will also thicken the sauce with some corn starch (as other reviewers have suggested). Even stirring and cooking the mixture for five minutes does not thicken it up enough for me. I will also probably double or triple the sauce.

I used bone-in chicken thighs and substituted the rice vinegar for cider vinegar (I didn't have rice vinegar). I also added a pinch of black pepper and corn starch to the mix while it boiled to thicken it up a bit.  The chicken was very tender and juicy. I would have preferred the skin to be crispy, however. My husband and friend loved it, so I will be making this dish again. Perhaps next time I'll do less vinegar, as I found 1/2 cup to be too much for my liking.

Made this last minute because I got started too late on smoked chicken. Whipped the marinade together and used a vacuum sealer to get it ready sooner. Used 2 instead of 3 tbsp of chili garlic sauce since the kids don't like spicy. I used 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/3 since my sesame oil is very strong. Turned out wonderful-- will definitely be making this again.

It was flavorful and edible. It was slightly too salty for my taste (I used low sodium soy sauce) and I would have liked it a little sweeter and spicier. I may try this again with more chili sauce and less soy.

This is a really good and easy chicken recipe. I have used both regular white vinegar and rice vinegar. Prefer the rice but the regular will do. I cut back a lot on the garlic because people in my family complain about too much garlic. This is now in regular rotation.

Very easy to make. I liked the idea of the marinade becoming the BBQ sauce in the end. I even added the pan juices from cooking the chicken. Taste was just right. Not too spicy and not too sweet.  Will definitely make again.

Marinade tastes good but very thin.  I don't think that marinating for 1 hour makes any difference to taste so next time I'll just baste in the oven.  I used a pan with a raised grill to keep chicken from sitting in juices.  Broiled for the last few minutes to get the sticky texture.

Did not add additional garlic. Also did not separate the marinade but left it all in the oven and basted. Marinated for more than one hour, more like four only because I have the time on my hands! But followed everything else the same and loved it! Served with Couscous.

One of the family's new favorites.  I used bone-in thighs and served over a bed of Jasmine rice.  The marinade mixed with the rice to create a flavorful dish.  I did not think it was too spicy, but I do like spicy food.

I made this chicken exactly as instructed but didn't really care for the sauce. The vinegar flavor was too prominent for me and overall the flavor just wasn't that great. My kids, however, loved the chicken and inhaled it so fast my husband didn't even get a chance to try it. That being said I think it's a hit as a marinade but IMO the sauce needs tweeking.

I used thighs, drumsticks and wings because that is what I had. I thought I had sesame oil, but didn't, and it was fine without it. I basted the chicken twice with the leftover marinade while cooking. It came out a beautiful brown-red color, very tasty. Easy recipe but good enough to serve to company.

This meal is now a staple in our house!  Everyone loves it!  It all gets gobbled up right away.  I don't double the sauce though. I marinaded the chicken in it and then I thoroughly boiled it to use as a sauce.

I have made allot of Asian dishes and this is my favorite.  I did not have Asian chili garlic sauce on hand so I subbed with Fish Sauce, 1/4 teas garlic powder and 1/2 tablespoon of Frank's Hot Sauce.  So good and my kids loved it.  Also did not have time to bake it so I cooked the chicken in the wok and then added sauce.  Let that cooked by boiling hard for about 10 minutes, last 5 minutes I added a fresh head of chopped broccoli and served with white rice.  This will be family staple.

This recipe was fantastic! I made as written except left out the sauce as it was salty enough. I marinaded chicken legs and then put it on the barbecue with more sauce. It kind of caramelized the skin of the chicken and kept the rest of the chicken juicy. I got many compliments on this one and will definitely keep it in my repertoire!

Very easy and delicious recipe!  Be warned that the chili garlic sauce really has kick!  You wouldn't think so with all of the other ingredients, but it does!  I will probably cut that in half next time to make it more kid-friendly. Served with rice and veggies.

(2013) Delicious, super easy, and kids loved it!  
I used Apple Cider Vinegar and only 1/2 teaspoon of Thai Chili Garlic Paste (it's all I had), oh, and I added about a quarter cup of Ponzu sauce to the recipe.
~~~~~
~~~~~Update (8.2015) - I have been making a double batch of the sauce b/c everyone loves to pour extra on their rice and chicken.  I double it b/c I discard the marinade after I take out the chicken.

This was very good but VERY hot!  I added a lot more honey to try to counter the hot .... next time (I will make it again) I will decrease the chili sauce by half and then taste the sauce and add more as needed.  I didn't have time to marinade so I made the sauce and basted the chicken throughout the cooking process and then had extra to pour over our rice.  Very tasty.

Good recipe. Doubled the sauce though but used the ingredients listed, though I cut back on the chili/garlic sauce. As I pulled the chicken out of the oven I got a wild thought and made a gravy using wondra and a tablespoon of peanut butter. Good stuff. Now trying to imagine how to dress it up with veggies, cellophane noodles, peanuts, and sprouts.

I used boneless, skinless thighs and made 16 thighs using the same amount of sauce- I just boiled the marinade that the chicken was in and used it as well (instead of discarding it).  This really is a delicious dish. Also served w/ rice and mixed veggies.  My 2 year old daughter devoured it (go figure!) and my husband loved it. Will make again!

I made this last night but without the asian chili garlic and it was a huge hit with my husband and 18 month old.  My little man ate 2 pieces of chicken!  I marinated the chicken in all of the sauce for several hours and then as another person suggested took that marinade and microwaved it for 5 minutes and then cooked all then poured it over the chicken and cooked it.  We will absolutely be making this again!

Best chicken marinade, we loved it!  I followed suggestions from other users and doubled the sauce (glad I did, it was delicious!)  I did alter slightly, using MUCH less sesame oil (mine is extremely powerful so I only added 1-2 tsp.) and also adding some about 2 tsp. of cumin for some smoky flavor.  Mostly I found I could eyeball the measurements and adjust them to taste.  Also made coconut rice as others suggested-- when cooking rice substitute some of the water for coconut milk, add salt, lime juice & cilantro.  Will definitely be making this again!

Made this for the first time, using boneless breats & used my wok instead of baking it. It seemed like it was missing something, so I added a little ginger powder while the sauce was thickening. I think that helped, but my bf thought the vinegar flavor was too overpowering. I heated up what was left over for lunch today & added some sugar to cut the vinegar which helped. I think this is a good base recipe, but could use some creativity & tweaking to make it better. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and so juicy. Here's how I made it in my NuWave Oven.

1. Marinade is the same marinade but cut the glazing part. Just marinade the meat for 20-22 hours in the fridge.

2. Cook on the 4 inch rack, 8 minutes one side, 6 on the other. No need basting.

This is it. Unbelievably tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

This had just the right balance of flavors and was a big hit with everyone. I used bone-in thighs, cooking at 375 for 60 minutes. I didn't have honey so I used 2T brown sugar and 3T white sugar. I also added ginger. This recipe is a keeper.

I made the marinade as written and marinated chicken breast tenders (istead of thighs) about 8 hours before grilling instead of baking.  It was pretty good and to us not spicy at all.  Next time I would probably use chicken thighs and add hoisin sauce, ginger and extra chili garlic sauce.

Changed this a little, adding 1/2 the amount called for of the sesame oil (dark toasted type), and having no Asian chili sauce, added just 1 tablespoon (we are wimps when it comes to heat) of reg Heinz chili sauce. Totally awesome even with the changes, my son, his friend and myself loved it! Absolutely no left overs with this one.

I really liked the flavors in this recipe. My husband thought it was too spicy so I will decrease the amount of chili garlic sauce next time. I reduced the chicken breasts to five pieces so the marinade was the perfect amount and even enough to put on our rice. Thanks for sharing!

These had a great flavor, but I will try them next time with only 2 Tbls. of chili garlic sauce--just a little too spicy for us.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding only 2 tsp. salt.  Cooking time is accurate, these were very tender, and I did not cover the dish as it baked.

WAY TOO MUCH OIL!  The chicken did taste very good but the sauce was waaaaaay to oily.  You can get the same sesame flavour from the oil with just a couple tbs.  You also DO NOT need the extra salt with the soy sauce.

We loved it! I made it two nights in a row using boneless chicken breast. One for my husband and me, and one for ladies night. The first night I used only one tablespoon of chili sauce - perfect, a little spice with all the flavor. The second night for the ladies I just used one teaspoon of chili sauce because some of the ladies do not like spice - still, quite tasty. Rave reviews! Thanks Essanaye!

This was yummy!  I used bone-in thighs and as I'm a novice cook I had a hard time figuring out when they were done but that's my issue, not the recipe's.  Thanks, I'll definitely make this again! :)

Followed recipe to the T...It was pretty gross. Sesame seed oil was waaay too much and rice vinegar made it kinda bitter when you swallowed. My mom really knew from Chinese cooking, if I had made this for her she would’ve given me that evil mom look.

I followed the recipe exactly. I served the chicken with white rice and homemade kimchi. Delicious!!! Yum, yum!!!
My favorite part of the meal was the remaining sauce that I used for dipping the chicken.
I will definitely make this again.

A tasty dish that is a bit spicy but not too much, my chicken thighs are not as crisp or roasted as they kind of boiled in the sauce which is fine as I like to have a sauce to put on the rice.

This must be my absolutely favorite thing to make when in the mood for Chinese! Like some others said, I don’t discard the marinate after getting the chucking out, all it takes just extra time to get the liquid evaporated. I made this at least 10 times and I’m thinking to try to have boneless thighs cut in cubes next tome for no-knife easy eating!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I will be making this again.  I took the advice of a review saying to add corn starch to the last of the sauce to thicken it because it was still thin after boiling  for 5 minutes.  I feel like this would be amazing on the grill also!

Great recipe!!  Followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it. The only change I would make is to make more of the marinade/sauce. Everyone wanted more of the sauce on their rice.

I used chicken breast instead of thighs and apricot preserve instead of honey.  Came out pretty good, no leftovers.

This was great! Excellent marinade. I did the cooking part a bit different.  After the marinade, I chopped up the thigh meat and skewered the chicken and cooked on a grill.  I also also skewed and grilled some red, yellow, and orange peppers and some sweet onions and grilled those too. After cooking , Topped all the kabobs with the rendered marinade and served on a bed of rice.  The food was excellent with perfect amount of spice. Yes, the food has some heat to it but no one in our house found it too spicy.  Very happy with this recipe.

Very nice flavor. I used it on chicken thighs that I baked in the oven and they turned out fantastic. I made one change, which I do with any chicken recipe, and that is to cover the dish with foil for the first 1/3-1/2 time of baking and uncover for the rest. Use a thermometer to check the temperature and if it's not quite cooked all the way then leave it in for a few more minutes until it is. The chicken is always juicy on the inside and never burnt on the outside.

Great results with hardly any work. I subbed in a couple tablespoons of mirin for some of the honey which, to me, makes almost everything taste great. I’m not sure if it’s my oven or what, but I cooked the chicken for a total of about 25 minutes—maybe a little less, with a 5-ish minute rest period. The chicken ended up fully cooked, but very juicy and not at all dry. (I find that a lot of chicken recipes over cook the chicken.)

The sauce by itself was way too spicy.  Poured over the chicken it was good but definitely make rice to go with it.  It will help tone it down.  The sauce had a good flavor so next time I will cut down on the chili paste.  I also want my chicken a little crispier so I might broil it at the end.

The sauce is so good I could drink it. I put it on my spring rolls for lunch. Marinating the chicken for tonight. How do you debone raw chicken? Removing the skin was hard enough.

I only put in one tablespoon of the asian chili garlic sauce because my 2 year old was going to be eating it.  My liquid did not get thick but it was still delicious.

I mixed the marinade just as written, but since I tend not to plan ahead, I just stir-fried chicken thigh pieces and onion, poured the marinade over top, and boiled it down for a bit. It made an amazing stir fry sauce! The family loved it.

I tossed all the marinade into a zip loc bag and the thighs and put it in the refigerator all day.  Just b/4 baking I put all the marinade in a pot and boiled it and then thickened it with some corn starch and then baseted  the thighs  with that while it was baking.   Husband said it was a definite keeper.

I followed the recipe to a T. Chicken did not absorb the flavor well. There was not enough marinade to baste with after the first round.

I love this recipe! It’s not convenient to get Asian food here in the mountains, so I have to make my own. This is so simple & rally fast & tastes amazing! It’s sort of “ sweet & sour”, though I think of it as sweet & tangy! I love it Hot & I love it leftover & cold. I add a simple jasmine rice flavored with soy & sesame oil as a perfectly complimentary side.  I highly recommend this !

This recipe was yummy! The second time that I made it, I only marinated the chicken for a short while in about 1/3 of the marinade and then heated the rest of the marinade on the stove to thicken, about 10-15 minutes. After baking the chicken for about 10 minutes, I basted it again with the thickened marinade, then basted the chicken again after about 10 more minutes and again at the end.  Served over rice with stir-fried peapods and garlic. Delicious dinner!

I made this and it was SO, very good. I thought it was going to be too spicy but it was perfect. This will be in my top 5 forever.

So good! Husband loved it too, he asked me to add this to our regular rotation. I was not able to get the sauce to thicken like I expected,  but it was thicker. I also added the green onions at the end and served over white rice. Cook time was off more like 45mins. Over all great recipe

Used boneless
Skinless thighs and only baked for 40 minutes. Put under broiler for a couple of minutes at end. Good flavor but sweeter than we normally like. Was more like a teriyaki flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. My partner and I like a lot of sauce, so I increase the marinade and, as others have suggested, boil the marinade and use it as sauce instead of reserving half. I also love mushrooms, so I saute some in butter and add them to my plate. I've never had the sesame oil, and the first time I meant to replace it with olive oil, but I forgot and it's so delicious with no oil that I haven't bothered to add it since. Basically, this recipe is great as written, but can bear a lot of tweaks and still be delicious. Thanks so much for it!

Fantastic Asian dish! I added 3 tablespoons of oyster sauce and a 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder to add more “zip” to the sauce! Absolutely wonderful! A++!!

The taste wasn’t quite how I imagined it. The thighs were really moist though! While they were baking, I put the remaining marinade into a small sauce pan; added 2T. flour to thicken; a dash of chili powder; 1tsp. honey; 1/2 tsp. lime juice. Brushed over chicken & then again while chicken rested. I also initially marinated the thighs overnight but just didn’t seem to get the flavor I was expecting.

This is definitely one of best marinades ever! My youngest loves chicken legs, so I used one pkg of legs and one pkg if boneless/skinless thighs. I cooked the legs 10 mins longer. It was so delish that  My boys devoured it and had seconds. I served it w Jasmine Rice and steamed fresh green beans (butter and lemon/pepper seasoning). Planning on making chicken wings next.

This is a delicious meal. I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and it was not a problem. The sesame oil is important to add that rich flavor.  Also, I didn't have boneless thighs so I used what I had - bone in thighs and I took the skin off and baked them at 375 for 1 hour and it was just great. I'm making this again!

This was really good, had to get some of the odd ingredients from the store, but worth the effort.
Only had bone in thighs,  followed the directions of
Another reviewer and cooked @ 350 for 30mins, basted then cooked 20 min more... perfect! Served over rice.

Loved this!  Make sure to “boil” the marinade for 3-5 minutes. Simmering will not thicken it. Watch it carefully in the oven so not to burn the marinade. Didn’t change a thing. Will definitely make again!

My guests really enjoyed this dish.  I left out the chili sauce and garlic because of guests' tastes, but it was still delicious.  I served it with jasmine rice and bok choy and mushroom stir-fry.  Drizzling the sauce over all three dishes made for a great menu!

I followed the recipe to a T and my chicken came out rubbery. The taste of the sauce was fairly good, although it calls for too much toasted sesame oil I believe (I'd suggest trying 3/4 or 1/2 of what the recipe calls for). Also, too much work involved for what the final product was. I won't be making this again.

This was quite delicious.  I forgot to buy the rice vinegar, so I used white vinegar.  Couldn't find Asian garlic chili sauce, but did find Thai chili sauce, which I used instead.  The chicken was very tender and the sauce a bit spicy, but not too much, and also sweet. Will definitely make again!

The whole family loved this one.  I added some star anise to the marinade that was cooked down as well as eliminating the chili because the littles don’t do spicy.  Totally delicious. We will definitely have this one again.

Easy to make. Great blend of flavor and spice.
Boneless chicken thighs are much more tender than breast meat would be. One of my favorite recipes of all time.
Serve with rice and vegetables of your choice.

Make this gluten free with Tamari or gluten free soy sauce.  Check label on the Tamari to make sure there is no wheat in it.  I used low sodium gluten free sauce sauce.  Family loved it!

Overall very nice. As is, the marinade was a bit sour for me so I sweetened it with more honey. Also, you can use all of the marinade, no need to discard. Just bring it to a boil with the saved marinade. It won't thicken on its own so add corn starch and water to thicken.

Cut back the Asian Chile to one tablespoon the second time I made it and it was perfect for me. I admit that I can't handle to much spicy food....
I love this flavor!

I used bone-in chicken thighs and it was great.  I also put it all broil the last 5 minutes to get it to brown a little more.  The chicken was very moist and had a great taste.  I will definitely make it again.

Made the recipe as directed and it was wonderful! Tasted just like the takeout chicken and broccoli from our local Chinese restaurant. My husband and son ate seconds! I added the oyster sauce as per the recommendation.

I didn't have boneless thighs, so I used bone-in. It came out great. We don't usually finish all the chicken I make, but this was GONE!

Yummy! Used siracha because that’s what I had but all else the same! Served over rice with red peppers cooked in it and stirred in some raw scallions at the end. Delish! I feel like the sauce is missing something but I’m sure it’s because I didn’t have the right chili sauce, so I would recommend using what it calls for. Plenty of sauce for A whole tray of boneless skinless chicken thighs. Without having to double the sauce recipe, there was plenty.

Easy recipe but I did lessen the garlic chili paste by one tbls.  Just too hot for my personal taste but the ones who like heat lapped it up.  Did marinate about 4 hours instead but don’t think it makes a huge difference.  Would make again but would split the marinade and chicken into two groups and one with chili paste and the other without.

This is delicious, but the sauce became thin after basting the chicken. I removed the cooked chicken and kept it warm. Then I reduced the pan juices to make a nice thick sauce.

I used this marinate on chicken thighs. I put the thighs and half the marinate in a qt. food saver bag and sealed it. I put it in the refrigerator for about 2 hours and turn it over once. With the other half of marinate I reduced it down until it thickened. We grilled the thighs. We loved the flavor of the chicken and the thickened sauce was great, we spooned it over the chicken. This will be my go to marinate for chicken. May try it on pork chops.

This dish is amazing! I used rice wine instead of rice vinegar and liked it better. The first time I made it I didn’t have toasted sesame oil and used canola instead. It tasted fine that way too.

I followed the recipe as written but doubled all the ingredients as I was making a large batch.  I used large zip-lock bags for marinating and marinated them, in the refrigerator - turning from time to time,  for 24 hours.   I served them with Fried Rice.

Delicious!  Made it per the recipe and wouldn't change anything.  Easy to make .  The chicken turns out really tender, juicy and delicious.  A little spicy, but not too much.  My husband liked it too and all the leftovers got ate!

I made it tonight for my family. My husband who is a skeptic when it comes to trying new recipes, even when it has a great review. My husband had seconds and said that I should definitely make it again. He really liked the sauce for the chicken. So, I would recommend making a double batch of the sauce. It’s really good on rice too.

I did not have any Asian chili garlic sauce so I substituted it with Thai style sweet chili sauce.  Because of it's sweetness I omitted the honey.  My husband loved it and he is not a fan of chicken.  He definitely wants me to  make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Sooo good. My go to Asian chicken recipe.  I dont buy rice vinegar but sub half apple cider and half white.  I don't have the Asian chili garlic sauce but add garlic and a little heat!  My kitchen smells awesome and the sauce is great.   I cook  the sauce down in the microwave, just watch because I have burnt it twice.  This is an amazing recipe!

I Make it quite often for chicken breasts instead of thighs. I simply sear the outside of the chicken in a frying pan with the sesame oil, add some of the sauce then throw it in the oven at 275F for 25 minutes. I then use the remaining sauce the make a thicker sauce to pour over the chicken and make stir-fried rice. My husband loves it, definitely a dinner favourite.

This recipe was super easy. I added some pineapple juice from the tidbits I had and reduced. I marinated the chicken thighs for a few hours. I turned on broil for the last 10minutes with the pineapple tidbits scattered on top and served with caramelized veggies and brown basmati rice.

This is excellent!  Especially if you love Asian cuisine!  I've made this twice now and will definitely make again.  My husband also loves it.  Only changes is that I added a bit of corn starch - as others recommended - to thicken the sauce.  Amazing!  Will probably double the recipe next time!

OH MY!   This is my first ever recipe review.  This recipe deserves a review and all 5 stars! 
I read a lot of the reviews and they were right!   DELICIOUS  sauce/glaze/marinade!
Following others' advice, I cut the sesame oil in half and used a cornstarch slurry to thicken.  No Garlic Chili Sauce so I replaced it with 2 T. Hoisin Sauce and 2 full splashes of Tabasco and used a total of 5 cloves of fresh garlic. 
Cooked as per recipe at 425* for a total of 45 minutes. (Used a thermometer to be sure the meat was at 180*F for optimum tenderness.)

I didnt have the Asian chili sauce but used a spicy bbq sauce instead with bone in chicken thighs.  had to cook a bit longer but still came out very good.  Ill try it again using the proper chili sauce next time.

This was a big hit in my house although I did not use the rice vinegar and honey, I chose to add hosin sauce to mine and cook them on the stove top next time I will use just a tad less oil than it calls for but all and all great recipe!

I used bone-in thighs and omitted the chili garlic sauce (there was still plenty of flavor).  I placed all of the marinade in with the chicken.  After the hour for marinading, I reduced it for the sauce to baste over the chicken during the cook.  I think the sauce/glaze could have used broiling.

This chicken was so flavorful ! I only had 6 BS chicken thighs and that amount is usually enough for my family, but it wasn't this time as everybody wanted seconds ..! I didn't  have chili garlic sauce so I substituted some Sambal chili paste and used half the amount called for. Also just half the amount of sesame oil (that stuff is strong)  I served with brown rice pilaf and steamed vegetables.

This was delicious!  I halved the sesame oil, because that just sounded like a lot, and thickened the basting sauce with Wondra (had no cornstarch).  Cooked the thighs on the grill and they were so tender and flavorful.  The sauce/marinade takes on a different flavor as it cooks, so don't be put off by it seeming a little too spicy when it's in the marinade stage.

This is a very good recipe.  Let the bone in thighs marinate for about 6 hours. I put them on the grill and cooked them slow after the initial sear. I reserved the marinade and reduced it on the stove for about 20 minutes. i basted the chicken about every 10 minutes. This was to die for!! My husband really liked it. Will make the marinade again and use it on pork ribs..YUM.

I’ve made this several times and it is great.  However my family likes a bit more heat and a little less sweet so I made a few changes.
I added a finger size of chopped fresh ginger.
1 Tbs. hot chili oil
1Tbs. Mongolian fire oil
Only a teaspoon of honey BUT
 used 3 Tbs. Thai Sweet Chili Sauce instead of regular chili sauce.
My husband swooned!  Hahaha
Great recepie.  Thank you

made this for supper tonight and followed the recipe exactly. The sauce did not thicken well.
The chicken was very tender but more spicy than I like. If I try it again, I will tweak the chili garlic sauce down to a tablespoon and decrease the soy sauce so the end product is less salty. And I may follow another reviewer suggestion and place the chicken on a rack above the juices. A nice try!

My husband, whose not fond of chicken, raved about this & told me to be sure to save it. We don't like hot spices so I used regular chili sauce & added a little more garlic. It was fabulous!

I liked it a lot. I thickened the sauce/drippings with cornstarch after I poured it in a fat separator and brought that to a boil. Looks really nice too. Didn’t use Asian chili paste, didn’t have it. Sprinkled some chili powder in the marinade instead. Was great!

Taste was great. Just enough heat. I couldn’t get the sauce thick enough to get it sticky enough to stay on the chicken. Otherwise I would have given it five stars. Will make again.

Simple, quick and good.  I love recipes that only use ingredients I normally have on hand.  (Maybe because I cook a lot of Asian.)  But the whole family loved it.

Very good meal that everyone ate.  I didn't waste the marinade that I used with the chicken. I boiled it for a while on stove. I also added a little less than 2 TBS of the chili sauce because I was nervous it would be too spicy for the kids. It was fine. I could add more next time. I also do not like over cooked chicken and it was well above the temp when I took it out.

Delicious! Smelled sooo good in my house while it  was baking! I reduced the garlic/pepper sauce by 1 Tbs because we don’t like things too spicy in my house. It was still a little too hot for us, but really good flavor, so I would probably reduce it by another half Tbs next time. Served with rice and green beans.

I usually pick recipe based on ingredients but this was a mistake. I think part of the problem is I usually only purchase chicken breast meat. I just don’t like thighs. The recipe was a little too greasy as well for my taste.

This is a great recipe ,I did as some Korean Pepper Paste to give it a little zing. I also doubled the sauce/marinade so I could serve it over rice.

My family loves this recipe.  My husband is not a big fan of chicken thighs but he loves this.  I don't usually alter the recipe because it turns out so well.  Basting the chicken twice when it bakes just makes that yummy glaze.  This is one of my go to recipes.  I also use it for my pork tenderloin.  When you follow the recipe exactly, it always turns out right.

I was a little worried about the strength of the vinegar - it was really pungent. No worries - I always add extra honey in stuff like this (we like it sticky!) and that mellowed things out. Added a Tbs of grated ginger because I think it belongs in all things Asian. We gobbled it up!

Even though I didn't have all the ingredients or the time to marinade overnight, this turned out to be a really great dish!! Substituted apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar, & used vegetable oil for the sesame oil. Use slightly less Apple cider vinegar as it is stronger than rice vinegar (I started with 1/4 c then added a small bit at a time to my taste). I marinated for one hour, then instead of throwing out the marinade I thickened it a bit with some cornstarch, then basted the chicken with it every 15 mins until done. Hubby, who hates anything vinegar-y, LOVED this dish, & even used the extra sauce on his rice. Served it with 7-grain rice steamed in chicken broth per the suggestion of a previous reviewer, & added an Asian-style cold slaw on the side. Will definitely make this dish again when I have the proper ingredients & the time to marinade overnight, it can only make this dish even better! Thanks for helping me find something my hubby likes that isn't steak & potatoes!!

The thighs roasted 10 min., then I went to baste them with the thickened sauce.  However, the chicken pieces had released all their juices, merely "boiling" the meat.  So I skipped the sauce , drained the chicken and baked them for another 10 min., and they were again swimming in a sea of chicken juice, pale as a water chestnut.  Finally, I switched my oven to  convection and the thighs browned and the sauce glazed over the chicken.  A lot of trouble, but  delicious!

Oh my goodness! There are very few recipes that I truly get excited about, but this is one of them!! I thought I had messed up the measurements on the glaze (because I halved the recipe and wasn’t paying attention when I was measuring), but it still came out AMAZING!!!!! SO GOOD!!!!

Used top shelf ingredients and it was horrible, horrible horrible. I love chinese food and eat it often. Too much rice vineager, too much sesame oil, too much chili paste. I cook everyday and am considered a good cook but do not make asian often. These flavors are off and it was too expensive to buy all the ingedients to have it come out bad. I cannot understand the high ratings. I guess there's no accounting for taste.

We skipped adding the sugar. It was a little spicier than expected without the sweet, might add a little less heat next time. It wasn’t unpleasantly spicy though. We really like s it and will make it again!

Since we are only two now, I cut the recipe to just under half (two outsized thighs).  I wanted it sweeter, so almost doubled the honey.  After the Marines sent me to the far east for a couple years, I got to like Asian flavors, especially ginger, which recipes seldom list.  So I added a lot of minced ginger that I get at Asian food stores.  I grow my own cayenne and habanero peppers and used a little crushed cayenne and some gochujang made from those peppers.  Just right!

A really tasty recipe! Following the advice of some here, I cut the amount of sesame oil just a bit and the results were superb. My 11-year-old daughter was crazy about the sauce and gave me strict orders to make this again.

Fantastic recipe. The Marinade is perfect. Enough heat, salt and sweet. I’ve made the recipe exactly as stated and it work wonderfully. I’ve also used the marinade for beef and it’s equally as great.

I made this putting all the marinade in with the chicken then transferred it all into a pot to cook. I used 1/2 the sesame oil called for and 2 instead of 3 tbls of sriracha chili sauce (hubby a bit heat sensitive).  Put about a 1/2 cup marinade under the chicken (used large chunks of breasts) and basted and turned several times while baking.  Lastly threw under broiler to get a good sear.  We all loved this dish served with wild rice and broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!

I keep chicken thighs on hand on a regular basis  because I'm cheap (but I do buy organic non factory chicken) so always looking for recipes for thighs and this one was excellent .  Good flavor!  Make sure you have all the ingredients though as each one is important for flavor.

It was really good. Discovered after I stated that I did not have enough honey, and I reduced the chili garlic sauce to 1 tbsp because one family member can't do too much heat. Will make it again with the full amount of honey. We evaporated it before I could take photos. I served it with plain rice, the sauce was good with the rice.

Yum yum yum is all I can say! This was soooo delish. I had to make some substitutions based on necessity: apple cider vinegar instead of rice, canola oil instead of sesame, and ketchup with chili powder instead of chili sauce. I didn’t want It too spicy because of the toddler. Also a bit of ginger powder. The results were awesome. We gobbled this up with rice and green beans. I used all the marinade to cook the chicken in, then thickened the juices up with flour to make a sauce that was delicious to put over everything. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Made it as stated in the recipe but used more chicken (around 3 lbs).  Everyone loved it. Served it with the Fried Rice recipe from this site.

This is a great, simple recipe! I ran out of rice vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar for the remaining 1/4 c. and it was still great. The chili paste added quite a bit of heat to it, so I think next time, I'll only use 1 Tbsp. instead of 2 Tbsp.

Really moist, tender, chicken!  I decreased the chili paste and garlic to 2 T each for the first try.  Will probably eek it up a bit in future tries.

It was very good ... definitely will marinate for the long period as the recipe suggests.  Plus, I think I would put in less soy and salt to make the marinade sweeter.

Had a really nice flavor. Will definitely make again! The only substitute I made was using Asian Sesame Ginger Salad Dressing instead of the listed chili one.

Was good. We normally like chicken breast better than thighs so I cooked it both ways - this recipe was better on thighs.

Absolutely delicious!  Plus the odor as it cooked was terrific.  
I didn't change a thing other than to reduce the recipe because I only had four thighs...

This was pretty good it would have been better but I replaced the sesame oil with peanut sauce because that's what I had at that time. I will make it again the correct way and see if I like it better, plus I used regular vinegar, but usually that doesn't matter to much.

I added a little more honey,a little less oil would help,it kind a over powered it. It has a very savory taste,maybe a little less garlic. The sauce tastes good with rice.Looks better than it tastes,but ok.

We made this. Don't think it needs as much rice vinegar. I added a tbsp of Allegro meat marinade.  After I drained the marinade, I dusted the chicken in gluten free flour and fried in a few inches of canola oil. We didn't like the marinade as a sauce so used the different bottled Asian sauces we had in the fridge. I'd make it again, but with Asain noodles instead if rice.

Delicious flavor, tangy and juicy chicken. I didn't bother reserving marinade and separating and reducing... I just put the chicken in a baking dish, poured a little marinade over it and baked; it was still great.

I always make the recipe as is so I can rate it fair! This is delicious and juicy. Although, the next time I make this recipe I will add more honey to the marinade for thickness. I added cornstarch to thicken my sauce. I served it with white rice and a sliced avocado. I drizzled the sauce on the avocado and rice. This is a keeper  :)

Very good recipe. We ended up making a second 1/2 batch of the sauce to add to rice and pass at table.  We added pan liquid to this, separated the fat in a fat separator and then cooked for five minutes. Used whole chicken thighs and basted three times. Reduced

Yummy! I used bone-in thighs (about 4lbs), cooked it for 30 min. Added about 1/3 lb snow peas for another 6 minutes with a small amount of sauce to make sure it got on the veggies. Used the same amount of sauce, using all to marinate and then boiled what didn't go in the oven (I placed the chicken in the pan by hand so most of the sauce was boiled). Paired with some mixed rice.

I made it exactly as written first time. Now I add & subtract spices. Really dislike people who won't follow the recipe to begin with. Then u can change it to your liking. We really enjoy this!! After the first time I do stick them under the broiler for awhile for get the skin nice & crispy!!

It was OKAY...not exactly what we were looking to eat. We won't cook it again. It was super easy, though. And, wasn't a BAD meal.

Easy, with good results. 
Used sweet chili sauce. 
Served with Jasmine rice, mixed veggies, and the unused portion of the marinade to which I added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, and sufficient cornstarch to semi-thicken.

Turned out very good with a few adjustments. First off, I will reduce the amount of sesame oil next time because it's too strong with a 1/4 cup - maybe no more than 2 Tbsp. I also omitted the salt. Before marinating the boneless, skinless chicken thighs, I seasoned them with a bit of garlic powder and Schezwan seasoning. After tasting the marinade, I thought it needed a little more flavor so I added a few dashes of fish sauce and a bit more soy sauce. I marinated the chicken overnight but agree with another reviewer, you don't need to use half, just enough to cover the chicken and use the rest for basting instead. I cooked for about 40 minutes (30 minutes will do - I was multitasking). I basted the chicken every 10 minutes. Halfway through cooking, I drained the extra juices out of the pan because I prefer it without the extra juice, just the flavor. Didn't have time to stir fry rice so I made rice with peas and carrots and added some of the marinade to it. Quick and delicious meal. Next time I'll try it on the grill.

Followed the recipe except for adding salt to taste since soy sauce is salty and used balsamic vinegar because I had no rice wine. It came out great! Everyone loved it. I will be making this again.

Great recipe. Was expecting more of a honey taste but still really enjoyed the depth of flavours. I didn't have garlic sauce on hand but found an amazing recipe on food.com 

Be sure to season the thighs before dumping in the marianade

1/8 cup sesame oil, 1.5 tbl chili paste, added grated ginger, no salt, did not marinade instead cooked down sauce then added cornstarch & water to thicken. Sprayed pan with Pam then put some sauce on each piece and cooked for the full 30 mins. Took out and turned chicken covered with remainder of thickened sauce. Broiled on high til bubbly. Topped with scallion. Insanely delish! Picky HB who doesn't like dark meat ate 3 times! He said write down that recipe!

It's an excellent recipe, but its missing a crucial ingredient called "Corn Starch". To me there is no other way to thicken the sauce and bring the glaze shown in the picture!

Great recipe!! I used 3 very large chicken breasts which I cut into  half. I doubled up on the marinade as per other reviews. I didn't have any chili garlic sauce so just used normal chili sauce. I added grated ginger for extra flavour. I also subbed half the ACV for balsamic vinegar.  I added chili flakes for extra heat. I marinated the chicken for an hour. I used the sauce for basting. 
Top: I added the chicken juices from the oven tray to the marinade that's in the pot. Adds glavourvyo the sauce.

I made this almost exactly as written. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I didn't have time to marinate it so I just brought it to a boil and covered the chicken with all of it (I used boneless skinless chicken breasts). I covered the dish with aluminum foil and baked it. It was REALLY GOOD! It wasn't as spicy as I thought it was going to be, which for me was a good thing. It was sweet with a small spice. Loved it!!! Will be making this again for sure.

Very easy, and I'll definitely make it again.  I followed the recipe to the letter, though added some toasted sesame seeds (about a Tablespoon) to the marinade mix.  Served it with rice.  Next time, I'll go a little more generous with the marinade because some extra is always nice to spoon over the rice and chicken.  The BF loved it!

Excellent! The only 2 things I did different were I didn't marinade and I kicked the heat up to 500° the last 5 minutes. Definitely will double next time.

Everyone loved the taste of this chicken dish.  I followed the recipe, would  have it bake  45 minutes instead of 30 minutes and bake it covered with aluminum foil.
It was delicious with vegetables..cauliflower, carrots, and broccoli. or other mixed vegetables.  Diced cooked potatoes with sour cream and cjives.

I made this recipe with chicken breasts.  Turned out great.  The sauce is to die for and I will definitely double it next time.  I did mix and add 1/4 cup cold water with 1 T corn starch to the sauce  to thicken.  The sesame oil gave it a nutty taste.  Loved it!

Easy to make with great flavour. I came across this while looking what to do with skinless, boneless thighs. I had all the ingredients on hand with the prep and cooking times were short.

Such a simple and tasty recipe!!  The aroma and flavor was amazing.  Next time I will probably double the amount of sauce just so I've got more to put on the chicken and brown rice I served with this dish.

This is delicious! Per other reviews, I doubled the marinade so there was plenty for drizzling over the finished chicken and rice. The scallions were a great touch! Will definitely make again and again!

Made this for the family and everyone loved it (kids ages 10 & 14 and can be picky about new food).   Followed the recipe pretty much as shown, didn't want it too spicy so I didn't use the garlic chili sauce, but used sweet garlic sauce.   Made one batch of the sauce which was plenty for the one package of 4 boneless thighs that I had, both for the marinade and the sauce.  Thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch when I cooked it.  The only complaint that I got was that I didn't make enough!  Ended up giving my kids most of my piece to share.

Cut this recipe in half, because I had 4 chicken thighs.  I used " slammin' sirchacha sauce instead of Asian chili garlic sauce, because that was what I had in the fridge.   Everything else was done as instructed,  The flavor was tasty and pleasantly spicy.  I'll keep this recipe in my repertoire.

Liked the recipe, easy to prepare. I would have liked more sauce and a more sweet and spicier flavor. I will try it again, double the sauce and explore sweetening options. Here in South Texas we like our flavors more robust.

These chicken thighs were delicious.  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  Instead of 1/4 cup of sesame oil, I just used 3 Tbs.  Sometimes I feel sesame oil can be quite potent.  I didn't want it to overtake the dish.  I used sriracha as my chili garlic sauce.  I also did not add any salt because of the sodium in the soy sauce.  I let them marinate for around 5 hours.  I did let them bake for 45 minutes so they would get to 165 degrees on the meat thermometer.  My family does not usually like thighs, especially my husband, but he raved about this recipe.  I will definitely make this recipe again and often.

This is one of the best Asian chicken dishes I've made.  The sauce is sweet and spicy.  I loved having extra sauce which I poured over chicken along with packaged fried rice.

I made this tonight exactly as the recipe stated. Came out very tasty and the chicken was juicy and tender. I threw some cut up, seasoned red potatoes in with the chicken and put a little sauce on them also. Tasty. This is an easy recipe and I will be making it again.

This was delicious! I actually had all the ingredients on hand, so was able to follow the recipe, mostly as written. I only had thighs w/ bones, so added cooking time. I used all the marinade to marinate the chicken since I had a few more pieces than called for, then boiled it to thicken. Still had to add a bit of cornstarch to thicken properly. We didn't think it was too spicy at all, and although I like spicy, I don't like it hot, so there was not an issue w/ that. Oh, and I used only half the sesame oil as others had suggested.

You need to use a cornstarch & water mix to thicken the sauce.  Although it was good I think it would be better grilled instead of done in the oven.  This is similar to  General Tsao's Chicken which I prefer.

How is this for a replacement?: I didn't have chicken thighs, which I'm sure would be great, but I did have pork steaks, so why not? Also I used Huy Fong Sriracha as a stand-in for Asian garlic sauce. I love garlic so much that I had to up the ante by adding  a few hacked up good sized cloves and while I was at it, about 1/3 cup chopped white onion which I threw in because I needed to use it or lose it. Sorry, I can't let a perfectly good onion go to waste. Instead of an hour, I marinaded overnight and I cooked them on open foil in their marinade on my Weber Kettle at 350 indirect cooking method using Kingsford blue bag charcoal for fuel and maple and apple wood chunks for smoke. I cooked them to medium rare and then used direct heat over the cooler part of the coals for a few minutes to bring them up to medium using an instant read thermometer, flipping and basting with thickened sauce often to avoid burning the sugar and to get a nice even sear on both sides. I served these with basmati rice and grilled asparagus drizzled with my homemade garlic and red, white and black cracked peppercorn infused olive oil and flaked sea salt. I also served the thickened marinade on the side as a dipping sauce for the meat. Dee-lish! I definitely will make this again.

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  Easy to make and delicious.  Marinated skinless thighs for about 1 1/2 hours before baking.  would recommend simmering left over sauce as soon as you put chicken in over.  It takes a long time to thicken.

Made as directed except cut chili sauce down to 2 TBSP for mouth issues. Marinated 4 hours and used regular chicken thighs. Baked 30 min, flipped, baked 20 min, flipped so skin side up, broiled for a few minutes to brown skin. Wonderful!

The first time I made this I used avocado oil since I didn't have the sesame oil. When I did make it with the sesame oil I did not like it and neither did my family. The sesame oil overpowers the flavor so of everything else.  This tastes better with thighs rather than breasts.  I simmered the sauce for 18 minutes but it never thickened all that much. I just poured it on the chicken and put it in the oven,  no marinade time. My husband who thinks anything less than breasts is dog food was astounded how good it was. I begged him to atleast try a tiny nibble. He ended up eating four thighs and when I made it with chicken breasts he did not like it.  This recipe makes me feel like a Chinese chef at a five star restaurant. I love it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I added a tablespoon of minced ginger to the marinade. I poured all of the marinade in the bag and once finished I just put it in a small sauce pan. I added 2 table spoons of brown sugar to the sauce as it was coming to a boil. Once boiling I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch (mixed with cold water) to thicken the sauce to a typical Asian sauce consistency.  My friend and I ate every bit of it served with white rice and stir fry veggies. Also hot Chinese mustard goes great with the chicken as a condiment. ;) 4 stars since I changed it. 5 stars for my own. Lol

So easy. I was too lazy to measure the ingredients, so just went on instinct. I didn't use the Asian chili garlic sauce, but instead used some House of Tsang General Tsao stir-fry sauce that I already had in my fridge. Didn't bother with the minced garlic, since it was one of the ingredients in the stir-fry sauce.  I marinated the thighs for a couple of hours and then baked as directed. Great flavor! Will make this often.

Amazing recipe! Followed it as written but did brown the thighs on the stove before placing in the oven. It came out so good that I signed up for allrecipes.com JUST to give it five stars!

We all LOVE this recipe. One addition was toasting some sesame seeds on top, sprinkling on after the final basting.  Very Asian flavor.  Recommend serving with stir fry and rice noodles.

Excellent...so balanced. We added a slurry to thicken the sauce a bit more. Next time we'll double the sauce/marinade.

A friend and family favorite.  I substituted sriacha sauce for the garlic chili sauce, and it toned down the heat a bit for those who didn't enjoy as much "burn".  Served with Israeli couscous and veggies.  Yummy'

I made this with no changes.  It was great.  I doubled the recipe and froze half for another meal another night.  We served it with steamed rice and broccoli but Brussel Sprouts work well with this dish too.  Next time I will try it with chicken breasts to see how the two dishes compare.  The 1 hour 40 minutes cooking time included an hour marinating in the fridge.   I prepared the marinade earlier in the afternoon so it was actually about 40 min prep/cook time in the evening.

This was awesome. I used regular garlic and added some red pepper flakes because that's what I had on hand. My family rated it an 11! Super easy to make and delicious.

Made this tonight for my husband. It was simply delicious. I served the chicken with oven roasted French fries seasoned only with salt and pepper and olive oil and cooked them in the same oven with the chicken. The dipping sauce was so tasty we dipped our fries in it as well! Such a great and simple meal. I'm anxious to try this same marinade with pork and chicken wings. I will definitely be making this recipe again and sharing it with friends.

Had to change a few ingredients because I didn't have the rice vinegar, so I used Chinese cooking wine and I didn't have the Asian chile sauce, so I used sweet teriyaki hot sauce.  I also didn't have the thighs so I used legs.  I also cooked it for an hour not 30 minutes.  It was very tasty and cooked just right. I will make it again.

Very good.  Might be too spicy for the kids, but great for the adults.  Double the sauce as it goes well with plain white rice.

This is a wonderful recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand and it was very simple to put together. I do believe that the finished sauce would have would have been sufficient for 4 pounds of chicken. As it was I made 2 pounds of chicken and have plenty of sauce left over and what a great sauce it is. I may use it on my cereal tomorrow. (Just kidding.)

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have the garlic chili sauce so I substituted sirachi sauce.   Nice level of heat without being overpowering.  Super easy and quick if you marinate ahead of time.

I love this recipe, I don't boil the leftover marinade I just cook it all together in the oven which thickens it enough for my family. I  do marinate it longer than the recipe recommends - we marinated for 8-24 hours (made it multiple times) and we love it each time. We serve it with homemade fried rice and the marinade is delicious poured over the fried rice too.

I thickened the sauce with a little corn starch and used chicken thighs with skin and bone since that's what I had. Very easy, aromatic,  a family pleaser! Served with jasmine white rice. Yum!

So... first of all, the chicken came out amazing. My mom suggested I even make it for my coworkers next time there's a potluck. (FYI I'm a semi new cook, learning as I go) Secondly, I made a few changes to this recipe. It calls for garlic cloves, which I did not have so I used garlic powder. I also used low sodium soy sauce and didn't include the full amount because I'm not a fan of the taste. This recipe also called for sesame oil and rice vinegar which I also don't have, so I followed another reviewer's idea and used apple cider vinegar., and instead of sesame oil I used Trader Joe's Garlic infused Olive Oil (which I absolutely LOVE). Now on to what I didn't like and how I fixed it. While my chicken was cooking in the over and the sauce was already made, I tasted and was disappointed at how much it tasted like soy sauce (mind you I already didn't use the required amount). So I looked around my kitchen and found hickory smoked bbq sauce and poured about a tablespoon in and mixed it up, PERFECT. Lastly, I didn't really feel like cutting up green onions, so I opted for parsley instead. Overall I loved this dish with the minor changes that I made. Def gonna make it again. *adds to list of MUST MAKE AGAIN recipes* lol

This was pretty tasty, but I did find I had to make some changes to the recipe as written. First, as some other reviews have stated, the sesame oil needs to be much less, it's a very strong flavor and you need only about half as much as this recipe calls for because it's overpowering. Secondly, the sauce never really "thickened" like it was supposed to. I boiled the sauce for almost twice as long as instructed and had no thickening. It didn't change the flavor in any way, but it did make "basting" strange, since the sauce slid off the meat. But overall, it was a very tasty recipe, and I would definitely make it again with some modifications.

I will make it again but ease off the garlic. It looked great and was nice to have a chicken dish that did not need to be grilled outside.

Wonderful recipe!  On this recipe you can't just stick your finger in the marinade and go by the taste.  I did this and thought,"This is going to be terrible!"  But surprise!  When I was done and had the end results the chicken was out of this world good!  My whole family loved it!
I did cut the amount of the sesame oil in half  as some suggested!
I will make this again and again!

Great recipe. Only changes I made were; grated fresh ginger in the marinade/sauce, as well as, use a TBsp of brown sugar, orange zest and the juice of half an orange, in the finishing glaze.

Really easy recipe very spicy and delicious.  A perfect recipe for people who love spicy food.  I did modify the recipe a bit because I was cooking this for young kids.  After tasting the sauce I realized that it was too spicy for the kids.  I had already used half of sauce to marinade the chicken.  I have to admit I panicked.  So I added more honey and some sugar and kept tasting it as I was modifying it.  I added about a teaspoon of hoisin sauce.  I did all of this as I was simmering the remainder of the sauce and the sauce came out really good.  I baked the chicken with the skin on.  I served the chicken with rice and removed the skin and the kids loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty recipe! I will be making this one again because the results were delicious. The only change I made was to marinate the chicken overnight rather than for just one hour. The sauce was too thick so I might boil it for a shorter duration next time. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this meal and the leftovers.

Well, I used bone in/skin on thighs cuz thats what I had, and the sauce just kind of slid off and they never really did get very crispy.  When will I learn to follow a recipe as written!  HA.  On to the next recipe !!

This was unfortunately not what I was expecting.  I followed the recipe to the T.  Recipe was just ok. I gave it three stars because it was not terrible, but it is missing something.

Fantastic recipe.  I made it as written but only used 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs.  I cooked for 45 minutes.  I was worried that it might be a little too spicy for my husband, but he loved it too.

I agree that this is a great recipe. We loved the thickened marinade over rice.  .    Next time I make it I will pound chicken breasts to make the cooking more even. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Have made this several times and this has become my wife's and my favorite chicken dish.  As with most other chicken dishes rather than bake, I start cooking in a pan to get a sear and some caramelization and finish in the oven.  Typically serve with rice and a lighter side (eg brighter slaw, cucumber salad, etc).

I had to Change a few things Since I was in a bind for tonight's dinner. I used mirin instead of rice vinegar, grilled the chicken instead of making it in the oven, and I didn't have time to marinate it. It was great and easy.

This is a very tasty dish.  If you don't have an ingredient it is very easy just to substitute a similar one and it will still come out delicious.

The only changes I made was added cornstarch to the half  of marinade that is put on the stove top. Just to thicken it up. And I grilled it instead of  baked. This  is my favorite and families. It had the sweetness and a little hot.After I marinaded for an hour I basted the chicken every 5 minutes on the  grill with the stove top mixture. I will be making this a lot.

Our kids loved this! We are working to reduce all sugars we consume, so I only used 2T of honey; therefore, I reduced the chili garlic sauce accordingly.  For the kids, I made "rice bowls" with coconut jasmine rice, steamed green beans, green onions, - and sunflower seeds, just for fun.  For me, I made a fresh salad tossed with sesame oil and rice vinegar.  All good, but the chicken was the highlight of the meal.  Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe, and after you cook the chicken it is not terribly spicy. But the reduction tends to be spicy. I guess I would reduce the chili sauce and see how that worked. Either way this is definitely a recipe I'll make again.

OMG. Awesome recipe. Of course, anything including toasted sesame oil can't be bad. I followed the recipe, and sided with a classic fried rice (with broccoli). You have to make this!

I did not have any sesame oil but used toasted sesame olive oil.  This  left the consistency very thin, not like a sauce at all and it was over powering.  So I increased the sriracha sauce and honey and added a little flour and water while boiling.  I served this over brown fried rice.  The chicken thigh was tender and the flavor was spicy and a huge hit.  I will make this again.

My entire family loves this meal! It's so easy to make that my 12 year old daughter has even made it before! I ran out of the Asian chili paste this last time so I just used red chili flakes instead.. it didn't make a difference & I've made it both ways. This would be an easy meal to make for a group as well with white/brown rice & some green beans or broccoli. I always double the sauce cuz we love it to put on everything!

We made this for a late weeknight, spontaneous dinner and it was delicious!! We loved that is was easy to prepare and although we didn't marinade the chicken for a hole hour like it sId, it still came out super flavorful. We definitely recommend this meal and will make it again!

Tasty sauce. Only change i made was halved the sesame oil (2 Tbsp). Didn't bother measuring the garlic but used 4 large cloves minced. Used bone in skin on chicken drumsticks marinated for 4 hours and baked at 400 for 40 minutes, basting once after 20 mins.

Delicious... although I did make quite a few adjustments to up the heat factor and give it a kick while keeping the base similar. Added about 5 tbs of Sriracha, changed the rice vinegar to Apple Cider vinegar (it's what I had in the pantry but it turned out great) added some Hoisin sauce and cut WAY back on the sesame oil to just 2 tbs...the flavor of it was just too strong with the original amount and seemed to overpower everything. I've made these a few times now and they're a big hit. I also like to sear them in a cast iron skillet before I throw them in the oven and then baste the remaining marinade over them every 7-10 mins while cooking.

Thanks for this recipe, absolutely love it. I marinated the chicken over night and the thighs really absorbed the flavors. 
I love the heat, but since it doesn't agree with me very well, I added three Tbls. honey when I was boiling the marinade. Fabulous! 
Served with coconut rice and salad.

This  was quite tasty! I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but the marinade just didn't want to thicken up, so it was rather watery over all. The flavor, however, more than made up for a lack of texture. I'll make this again, with some minor modifications!

Pretty good, but drippings burn and smoke in the oven so you gotta watch that. Use foil on your pan to help with clean up.

Delicious recipe, but I doubled the recipe and it was too salty.  I would reduce the soy sauce and add more honey.  Definitely do not add any salt.  The sauce did not thicken very much so next time I will add a little corn starch/water mixture to thicken the sauce to pour over the rice.   I sliced up the leftover chicken the next day cold and put it on a salad.  Yummy!

Made these just as recipe states and we really enjoyed it.  It is spicy, so if you don't care for spicy, you'll have to tone down the chili sauce, but otherwise easy and they come out looking beautiful!!

I used boneless chicken breast and cut them in half. They turned out very tender and had a really good flavour. I added a teaspoon or so of corn starch to thicken the rest of the Sauce. Plus I only used 2 tablespoons of the garlic chili sauce and it was spicy enough for us.

I didn't have enough honey, so I also used agave syrup. I also added some orange juice to the sauce because it was a little on the spicy side for me, and some citrus really balances out the sodium. I like my sauce a little thicker, so I add more cornstarch then it called for. All in all I can't wait to make this again!

Since I don't like dark meat of chicken, I came to allrecipes for a recipe. I used Thai red curry paste, and it was delicious - not too hot. My husband loved it too. Thanks for the help.

This was really good. Spicy with a kick but not overwhelmingly. I had spicy garlic paste and found some garlic chili sauce . Omitted minced garlic and used 3 T. Of both paste and sauce. This may have made extra spicy. Our family ok with a little of chicken juice in pan over sliced chicken. Very, very good!

Very flavorful and moist! I did marinate for about 4 hours and would even do more. The cooking time was spot-on, and I'm sure basting with the reserved marinade imparted more flavor. The chicken was not as moist when reheating, but that always seems the case with chicken. I also made some Szechuan green beans and ground pork to go with it along with some Jasmine rice. Great recipe, Essanaye!

Delicious!  We will definitely be having this often!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did have to make very minor adjustments.  My sauce didn't thicken, so I added a very small amount of cornstarch and water to thicken it.  And 3 tbs. of the chili sauce would have been way too hot for us -- 2 was perfect.

Very flavorful, with just enough spice but not overpowering!  My DH grilled it outside after I marinated it for about 4 hours. We loved it and I served it with Sesame Noodle Salad from this site looking forward to having it again! Thanks for sharing, Essanaye!.

Delicious!  I used boneless skinless thighs, salted them a bit and browned In a skillet. I then removed them from the skillet and poured the sauce in. I didn't have chili oil so I used some sriracha, only had expensive raw organic honey so I used about a tablespoon of honey and some brown sugar also used fresh ginger. Simmered the sauce for a few minutes added the chicken back in and put in the oven.  Instead of basting I just turned them over a few times. Amazing!!!

A little spicy, cut down on the chili sauce if you want it less spicy, but it was OK with the sweetness.  Everyone in the house loved it, and it's one of our stand by recipes.  I cut it in half for two people.

My family loved it. I added a little less chili garlic sauce and it wasn't too spicy, but had a little kick, which was perfect for us. Next time i might to a low sodium soy sauce becasue it was just a little salty for me (and i didn't even add salt to the marinade) . I will definitely try this on legs on the grill and even make chicken wings with this marinade.

Dang this is good.  I only used 1T. of the sesamie oil as I was using the dark oil and it is really strong, plus I wanted to keep the calories down. That was plenty of oil. I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 3 Tablespoons ( thought that was excessive) Only used 2 Tablespoons of the chili sauce but will go with all 3 next time (and there will be a next time)   I basted it a couple of times while it cooked then again after it came out.   This was a great way to change up chicken and make it more interesting.  cooking time was perfect.

Not a fan - it was far too spicy.  I think it was too much vinegar but adding more honey didn't really help. I won't be making it again.

An instant favorite in my house.  Will definitely be added to the weeknight rotation.  I made double the sauce to have extra to serve over the rice.

I made this recipe yesterday and it was delicious. The only thing was I made it with bone in thighs. So I had to cover it with aluminum foil towards the end so the sauce on the skin won't turn so dark. Overall, great recipe. Will use it again.

Great dish....but as always I had to add my own twist. I added fresh orange juice , pale dry sherry, and fresh grated ginger to the sauce/marinate. I did not throw out the marinade that the chicken was in but boiled it down a bit to use with the rest. I served it with a jasmine rice that I tossed with toasted slivered almonds and fresh minced green onions. Delicious!

This was my first complex meat dish for a school project. I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine and basically eat it all the time. This dish was defiantly something else. (By something else, I mean, A+, haha) it's defiantly delightful! I added some stuff of my own. I added in onion salt and garlic powder in the sauce, not a lot, but just enough to give it some extra flavor. I also added apple cider vinagar. It gives the chicken a lovely sweet taste. I skipped out on added minced garlic and Asian chili garlic sauce, because I was either really really low on it or didn't have any. But it honestly turned out great without it! I would also recommend grilling some nicely diced onions with herbs  and chopped up chives. Along with olive oil while grilling. Also while the chicken was cooking, I would pour vinegar and the juices from the chicken onto the chicken to make it juicer. Also boiled eggs are a nice side to the dish! Thank you so much for the recipe and hopefully you might try my little tips! Very good dish! ;u;

The sauce is delicious! I marinated for three hours, and used 1T garlic chili sauce, because I thought 3T might be too spicy for my husband. I think next time I could add a little more (baby steps, lol), and, there will be a next time. Thanks for sharing!

This is my go-to Asian chicken recipe. I tripled the sauce for 6 people. (Freeze leftover) i prepared everything the day before except spreading the sauce on chicken and baking it. All the sauce was used as a marinade for two hours. Then I drained the sauce into a saucepan, boiled the heck out of it for 20 min or more then added a bit of cornstarch and boiled a bit more. Refrigerated sauce will thicken a bit more. In effect, u r making ur own Soy Vey sauce. It should darkened and not taste vinegary.

This is one of our favorite recipes EVER! I add some flour or cornstarch to act as thickener when I boil the sauce so that more of the flavor stays on top of the chicken when baked.  YUM!

I've made this twice, the first time with boneless chicken thighs as the recipe suggests and the second time with drumsticks. I much preferred it with the boneless thighs and would not recommend making it with legs.

Made it exactly as described, except I put all the marinade in with the chicken, then poured it off into a pot and boiled it until it thickened.  This took 10 minutes or so, I did not add any cornstarch, but would have taken less time if I had used a wider and more shallow pan to reduce it.  Took 35 minutes to bake at 350, came out fantastic.  It looked good too, and I forgot to chop the green onions because I was so ready to eat it ;)

I made exactly the way the recipe called for except my chicken was bone in( didn't notice it called for boneless until it was too late) so I had to cook longer and cover with foil toward the end to prevent glaze from getting to dark. Also, I made double the sauce because were a  sauce kind of family. It came out excellent. I made with an Asian green bean recipe from this site and cooked rice... What an awesome dinner it was.

I used this recipe of ingredients but used boneless thighs that I cut in small pieces and browned the chicken in a Wok with the sesame oil then added the rest of the ingredients and served over basmate Rice.   Now my wife makes me make this dish at least once a week. thanks for the great idea

Great, easy and flavorful last minute meal!! Used agave syrup instead of honey and followed the rest of the ingredients. Cooked all the marinade to a boil for a couple minutes to clear any potential bacteria and let it cool for a glaze. Basted twice during baking. Amazing!! Used green onions and instant brown rice to serve!!

This has become a family favorite for my two boys, 2 and 3, and my wife. 

I don't bother marinating and the chicken is plenty flavorful. 

I also skip the chili, the boys aren't ready for heat quite yet. 

I pour on both sides and cook smooth side up for 1st 10 minutes. I then pour on both sides again and cook the final 20 minutes bottom side up so the sauce bakes deep into the chicken. 

I also like to mince a bit more garlic than the recipe asks for. 

Serve with rice and broccoli and you have smiling faces.

Very good I will make this again and again.
I didn't have rice vinegar so I used white vinegar and a dash of sugar. I used chilli paste instead of sauce .

I followed the recipe except reduced chili paste to 2TB because I wasn't sure how much spice my kids could tolerate.  The flavor was wonderful and will make it again.  However mine didn't turn out looking like any of the photos - the sauce didn't thicken and the chicken didn't brown.  Near the end of cooking, I broiled the chicken for a few minutes and that improved it a bit but would love to know how to get the sauce nice and sticky like the photo.

First of all I have to say, I have been using allrecipes for years and this is the first time I have ever been moved to write a review.  This recipe is awesome.  I made it exactly as written except for the sesame oil - I used only a tbsp because it does have a strong flavor.  I used skin-on, bone-in thighs and cooked for 40 minutes at 425 and they were done perfectly.  I recommend marinating overnight because it really infuses the flavor in the thighs.  They came out of the oven looking like something from a restaurant!  Make this recipe tonight... you will love it!

As I normally do when I try a new recipe, I made it exactly as written the first time.  It was delicious and I wouldn't change a thing. I always want to add to recipes but not this one. It is a keeper. I will try this sauce on other proteins as well. We had ours with noodles, next time,  we'll do rice. It had a nice bite to counter the sweet honey, but it was not spicy hot.

Excellent dish. I added about a 1/4 tsp of ginger paste to the marinade. For me It gave the sauce the extra flavor I enjoy.

Really Really Good!

Be sure to use a grill and start it very hot if you want it to look like the picture with grill marks.  

I think I'll have a bite of the leftovers for breakfast :)

My husband, teen son, and I really liked this. I made it as directed here. I think I might need to cut down on the liquid ingredients to have it look a bit more like the picture with the recipe. I believe it would be even tastier if the liquid ingredients were a bit "sticky". I'll make this again with a few tweaks of my own!

I used the recipe for the sauce. I did everything as the recipe called for except cooking the chicken in the oven. I cooked it in a pan with a little sesame oil then diced it up and added it to an Asian style salad. I used the leftover cooked sauce as a little dressing. It was delicious!

Great taste, very well received. I served it with brown rice and peas.   I made no changes. When I pulled the thighs out of oven I cooled them on cookie rack to drain off some the grease.

We all enjoyed this recipe. I made it as written, but will marinade for much longer next time. I felt the chicken lacked some flavor, but the sauce made up for it.

I made this following the recipe except had bone-in thighs so I baked a little longer, and added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. WOW! what great flavor, especially over jasmine rice with green onion tossed through it. My husband got so enthused about it that he started thinking how great the sauce would be to toss baked chicken wings in, or to glaze spareribs with. I have to agree, it's the boss sauce!

Very good. I made it just as advertised and it was delicious. Next time I'll cut back just a bit on the garlic (so my wife can take leftovers to work the next day). I served it with plain brown rice and there was enough sauce left that I could drizzle the sauce on the rice. Simple--but very good.

Did not change a thing!  This is a keeper!  Cooked with skin then removed skin and brushed with sauce one more time and back in oven for a couple of minutes.  An instant favorite!

I would love to have been able to follow this recipe, but I was missing one key ingredient - the Chili Garlic Sauce. But I had everything else. So I used one TBSP of Chili Oil just to get the Chili flavor in there. In preparation for doing something with these lovely Chix Thighs, I had bought some Ginger Root. So, as I had that on hand, I added about 1 TBSP of grated Fresh Ginger Root to the marinade/basting sauce.

We have some blood pressure issues in our household, so I just skipped the salt. No one at the table picked up the salt grinder!

Oh, and I had gone searching for recipes to GRILL. So how this recipe came up is a mystery. Nonetheless, I consulted with my household grillmeister, and he said, "Fine for the Grill!" 

And it was! I split the marinade as directed and we used the extra sauce, boiled down a bit, for basting on the grill (charcoal).

Our 15-year old grandson is visiting, and he actually complimented both of us on our dinner preparation and thanked us for a delicious meal as we were picking up. Can't go wrong with that kind of review!

Oh and the leftover sauce was great on the plain rice we served as a starch. 

Definitely on our list of keepers for regular meals!

This was a HUGE success.  We tend to like spicy, but I would reduce the Asian chili garlic to 2.5 T next time.  I also doubled the chicken amount (for left overs) and the sauce which was AWESOME!!  This one is going in the rotation for sure.

This was an amazing recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have sesame oil so I substituted olive oil instead. I'm very pleased with the results and happy to find a recipe to use the boneless chicken thighs that I have in my freezer.

I was in a hurry and so didn't marinate the chicken. I just cooked on the stove with some of the marinade. Husband loved it (and he doesn't usually love what I cook). Used granulated garlic instead of fresh. I made only half the recipe and wish I had made the full. Will definitely make again.

Excellent dish. I often use the marinade for grilling, and that turns out amazing as well. I also add ginger in from time to time, and it's great with and without it.

This is really good. I ommitted the chili garlic sauce because my family is wimpy. Some reviewers recommended halving the oil, but I disagree. Sesame oil is wonderful, and that nutty flavor makes this recipe.

Also did not have chili garlic sauce so to serve 6 I subbed black bean garlic sauce 4T plus 1T hot sauce and it wasn't hot at all. Very good. Next time will use chili garlic tho. I was also nearly out of honey so used 3T honey plus 1T corn syrup plus 1T pancake syrup :)  (hey I had to get creative). Also takes 10-15 min prep, not 5 min. But then again maybe it took me longer because I had to do all this subbing. Oh I also ran out of garlic so used 5T garlic plus heavy dose of garlic powder to make up somehe other 1T.

This marinade is very good.  I have made this per the recipe and baked the chicken in the oven but it wasn't until I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and grilled them on a charcoal grill that this recipe really shined.  The reduced sticky glaze brushed on the thighs resulted in beautiful charred bits all over the mahogany colored chicken and was both sweet and smokey.  Just delicious.

Excellent. I didn't marinate but this was very tasty over fried rice (I use this site's Pineapple Fried Rice minus the pineapple and chicken, added teriyaki tofu). It was a bit spicy (I used sriracha for the chili sauce) but we all liked it that way.

GREAT!  I had some frozen thighs I wanted to use and I also had had all the ingredients.  It was fate that brought us together. It came out of the oven looking every bit as beautiful as the picture. Heavenly aroma and taste. Served with brown basmati rice cooked in chicken broth and a fresh vegetable. Mmmm.  Will definitely will have this again.

takes a while but it's totally worth the wait. I recommend making half the sauce and then just use what is left on the baking dish to pour over white rice. Just use a colander to get rid of the unwanted little chunks. A favorite. I had to cook for 45 minutes and broil for 10 using bone in skinless thighs but they are better than boneless

Made this tonight, following the recipe exactly,and it was pretty good.  It doesn't look like the picture, however.  To me the picture looks like the chicken was grilled instead of baked.  My baked version didn't have that thick layer of sauce over the top, but then again, I didn't do the last step and have extra marinade on the side.  Maybe that would have changed the presentation.  Having said that, I was expecting to find this to be very hot and spicy - and to me it wasn't.  It has flavor, yes, but isn't hot and spicy.  I served it with broccoli, but would have loved to serve it over rice, allowing the rice to soak up the marinade, but I'm watching my carbs.

Easy and tasty. Needed some getting used to as it is kind of tart from the rice vinegar. But once your taste buds get used to the taste, you will enjoy it.

I loved this, I didn't have honey so I used coconut aminos and unrefined peanut oil & Tamari as other options.  Made jasmine rice w/peanut oil scallions and thawed peas.  Delish

First let me say that I did change two things when I made this, I used just a very small amount of sesame oil perhaps a couple of tsp and the rest olive oil and I went a little easy (cut back by about a third) on the hot sauce as some of my children do not like really spicy food. I like the layer of flavor that the sesame oil adds but that much sesame oil is not to my liking.  Other than that this was yummy!  It smelled great cooking and tasted wonderful.  It was very easy to prepare and my kids loved it.  I will certainly make this again.

Really tasty, a little too spicy for my liking. I would do 1 1/2 TBS of the Garlic Chili Sauce next time. I ended up only needing to cook the chicken for 20 minutes and it was nice and moist. These would probably taste great on the grill! The sauce didn't thicken too much for basting. I might try thickening with cornstarch next time.

This was amazing and so easy. I followed recipe exactly except halved the sesame oil and it was perfect. My picky son and husband loved it. I would not use the full sesame oil though as 1/8 cup was plenty.

This is excellent; I followed the recipe exactly as presented, using an Asian sauce labeled as "mild, sweet chili sauce". It gave a great tang to the recipe without any hotness. I did add some cornstarch to the sauce while the thighs were baking in order to thicken it. The balance of all the ingredients in the marinade worked exceptionally well, and the chicken thighs turned out moist and definitely "mouth-watering good".

Doubled the sauce so that I had an ample amount to marinate and also use to baste and serve with. Used a mix of siracha and Thai garlic chili paste.

Delicious! We absolutely loved it! I marinated in all of the marinade then dumped all of it in a saucepan to boil before I put the chicken in the oven. I also had to drain the chicken about halfway thru because it was swimming in juices(I just added it to the saucepan w/the marinade & continued boiling). I did have to add a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce but, because there were so many juices in the pan of chicken, I ended up spooning some of the sauce over the thighs & sticking it under the broiler for a couple minutes. We'll be making this again & again! Thanks!!!

I will definitely use this again.  I tried this recipe at the last minute for dinner.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I used regular chicken thighs and I only marinated them for about 30 minutes.  I cooked the thighs at the same temperature as called for in the recipe.  They were done perfectly.  I served this with quinoa made in the rice cooker using chicken broth and a spinach salad.

Delicious!  We subbed Sirachi sauce for chili sauce  but kept all else the same.  Unbelievably good.  You will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend putting foil in the bottom of your pan before cooking- it's a mess to try to clean up b/c of the yummy honey that cooks.  Entire family of six loved.  Definitely one of the best chicken thigh recipes we've tried!

I marinated the chicken thighs for about 7 hours.  I followed the suggestions of others; boiling the reserve marinade, broiling for the last few minutes, and making extra sauce.  I used water and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  The sauce also works great with veggies.  I made a separate batch with mushrooms, red peppers, and green beans.  I love spicy so I added more chili garlic sauce.

I made two double batches of sauce for a double recipe of chicken. The first one was for marinade and we used apple cider vinegar because I was out of rice vinegar. We put all the marinade with the chicken thighs in a 9x 13 pan and baked as per directions.
The second double batch I used rice vinegar ( after buying some) and coked it on the stove, and added a couple of Tbsp cornstarch and it thickened up nicely. 
The first marinade was tasty and sweet, I am sure the chicken juices helped also.  The second marinade looked better and had a better texture but tasted a bit vinegary. Maybe I didn't cook it long enough? I didn't find either one spicy. Sweet and sour were the main flavours.
Next time I will follow the reviewers suggestions who said not to do a double batch of sauce, but will cook the chicken alone,  add the marinade to the other half of the sauce and then thicken it. I will also use at least half apple cider vinegar.

Cooking time was too long and the chicken came out a little dry...  The flavor was good, but I think it would be a lot better with a shorter time.

Also key is to thicken the sauce enough to get some good stick.. mine stayed thinner than I liked (shoulda used the corn starch).

Amazing, delicious, perfect as written!!!  Used all the sauce to marinade chicken, poured remaining in sauce pan while chicken baked.  Thickened up a bit with cornstarch and water at the end, then poured over thighs....stir fried cauliflower and zucchini, toasted up some Italian bread I had in the freezer...PERFECT!!

We loved this! I may have put a to bit more Asian chili sauce than some may want, but it was tasty Deluxe! One of those dishes that I wished I could eat more of, just for the flavor. We will do complete recipe next time since I halved it because there's just two of us. I'm sure the leftovers will be equally good. This will. E a new favorite for sure. Thanks for the recipe, Essanaye!

Used skinless thighs and drumsticks.  They marinated for 6 hours or so and it was delicious!  So easy to do and the family loved it.  I'll definitely make this again.

Delish! I hardly ever want to eat what I just cooked right away but tonight I had to make myself stop. I wasn't sure how the sauce would be. Was short on honey & added Agave liquid. Also a splash of Surrache sauce. About 5 minutes before I took the chicken out of the oven, I threw in some walnuts. Since I was also low on veggies, I served it on a large Romaine leaf with some stir-fried rice on the side. I only used 4 thighs so I hope have enough sauce to get close to repeating this experiment when the ice storm passes! Thank you very much for an easy delicious & forgiving recipe.

Best glaze ever. All 3 of my boys approve :) 
I've made this twice and will continue.

Made it twice, with bonelles and bone-in  thighs. Both came out excellent! The bone-in thighs took longer to cook, about an hour, and I did omit the chili garlic sauce because both my mom and I don't like spicy food. Will definitely add this dish to our rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!

DELICIOUS!! This is a winner and a keeper! I followed the recipe in step with two exceptions: I didn't add salt to the marinade, I used full-salt soy sauce; also for the glaze, I added about a quarter-cup of mirin before cooking it. I think the mirin gave it just the right amount of sweetness to balance it out. This is my kind of spicy, too! Not too hot but a heat that kind of builds. I served it with steamed jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. I look forward to making this again! I want to try grilling the chicken for it sometime too.

This recipe was outstanding!  It was easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I don't care for too much spice, so I used 1 tsp of Sriaracha...Rooster Sauce and it was perfect.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was SO delicious, and not too greasy/oily like chicken thighs can tend to be. I served it with fried rice and my family loved it. This was very easy to make on a weeknight. I love it when things spend a little time in the oven so I can prep my sides. 

Next time I will make a larger portion (I made half the recipe), and will probably add more chili sauce or maybe wasabi. I was hoping for a little more heat.

I did just a couple of things differently. I substituted balsamic vinegar for rice vinegar, and I roasted my chicken in a cast-iron skillet that has raised grill marks, so the chicken was slightly elevated out of the oil. (Some reviews said the recipe was too oily, but mine was perfect.)

Perfect combination of sweetness, spice, flavor, texture. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. The only problem is that my wife liked it so much she thinks I should be doing all the cooking now.  Oh well, it was worth it.

I added a little orange juice to sauce as well, heated oven to 350, put boneless skinless thighs in dutch oven, poured the sauce over, covered and cooked for about 1.5 hours...steamed rice, carrots, and chopped some peanuts on top which made the dish... little spicy, which we love but balances with honey.  No marinating just cooking for longer period.

This recipe was easy and my family loved it. A great way to take advantage of the value packs of bone in chicken at the store. I included 'wings' in my batch and they were great too.  One thing to watch out for is your chicken skin burning a bit. Mine chicken got pretty dark about a third into the baking, so i placed a sheet of foil over the top of the chicken. I served with stir fried asparagus and steamed rice. I will definitely make this dish again.

This is a wonderful recipe! I make it ALMOST as written, except, when I make it, I use half the sauce to marinade this meal (put all in a large ziploc bag) and save the other half for another meal. Then, I just put the chicken into a pan, pour in all the sauce with it, and bake as directed. The sauce is AMAZING on rice and this gives plenty, no need to double this recipe at all (in fact, imo, it can be halved.) Oh, I do use only about 1-2 teaspoons of the hot sauce (NEVER 3 tablespoons, this would kill some of my diners) and use half sesame oil and half peanut oil. Anyway, an absolutely delicious dinner!

This was okay.  I think the brand of chili sauce you have may make a difference, but I agree that the vinegar's flavor didn't seem to balance out.  I had to thicken the sauce with some cornstarch and water.

This is the best recipe that I have ever prepared.   Once you buy the seasonings and spices they last for at least 6 meals.  I prepare 10 chicken thighs at a time and this gets eaten up fast !!  thank you for sharing.

This recipe was delicious! I didn't have the sesame oil so I substituted with Canola oil and sesame seeds. I also added some extra Rooster sauce to spice it up even more since my husband and I love spicy food. He said he would definitely eat this again. Served this with an asian chicken salad and white steamed rice. Excellent!

GREAT Recipe!!  I made it two days in a row!  Lol.  I doubled the sauce (all except for the sesame oil).  First time I made it in the oven with chicken thighs - it was very good.  Second time I made it on the BBQ grill - it was EXCELLENT!

I made this last night served with Jasmine rice and fresh green beans that I cooked in with thighs and sauce the last few minutes.  It was quick and easy to make and was an excellent change from my everyday chicken.  Even my boyfriend who is very picky had seconds!  The only changes I made was-I used regular chili sauce, I did not have the "Asian chili Garlic sauce", and I used a dutch oven on stove top-first crisping the chicken then simmering covered with the marinade from the bag (I only let the chicken marinade for about 20 minutes).  The sauce was excellent and I can't wait to try it with other things. Boyfriend would like to try it as a dipping sauce for popcorn chicken...

Very tasty! I didn't have rice vinegar on hand so subbed it for balsamic vinegar. I was worried it was going to be sour, but it was fine and turned out great! I didn't really need to pour any remaining sauce over it as it was quite juicy enough.

I have made this twice now.  Very easy and tasty.  I used a little less rice vinegar and added a tbls. full of hoisin sauce and a little extra honey.  The first time I didn't have time to marinate but they still tasted great.  The second time I marinated them over night.  They tasted awesome.

Deeelicious!! I added some cold water & cornstarch mixture to the warmed sauce to thicken it a little, some dried chili peppers and tripled the green onions. Served it with jasmine rice and steamed asparagus.

For some reason neither my husband nor myself liked the chicken - at all - but the sauce???? Ye gods, killer, killer killer stuff!!!! Once reduced, this stuff is to die for.  I had sauted some broccoli and carrots in olive oil & ginger as a side dish - I tossed a couple of T of the sauce in it - fanTAStic.  In the future, I think I'll simply make sauce, reduce, (completely skipping the marinade), slice some b/s chicken breasts, and use as a stir fry.

I made this today & my family was very happy. The only thing is the marinade never thicken while cooking. However it turned out well. Will make again. :)

This is so easy and it was absolutely delicious!  I used bone-in chicken thighs, which worked very well.

This was excellent. I baked the chicken in the oven, pouring some of the marinade into the baking dish which worked well. Chicken was extremely tender and moist. I used only 1 Tbsp. Chili garlic sauce and might even use a little less next time. My husband loved it - we had it with white rice and the sauce was great (even if a little warm for me). My 6 yr. Old granddaughter loved the chicken (without extra sauce). She told me to give this recipe 5 stars, which I'm happy to do. I will be making this again.

This was pretty good, but I didn't have all the ingredients, so I had to improvise.  I think it would have been better grilled.

Yum! I made my own Asian chili garlic sauce and had to substitute regular vinegar for rice vinegar. I thought it came out wonderful, and my husband sure liked it!

I use low sodium soy sauce and double it.  I also use vegetable oil instead of sesame (too strong tasting to me).  One of my faves!
