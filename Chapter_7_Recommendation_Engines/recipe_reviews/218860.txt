Like everyone else I used a little bit of Worcestershire sauce instead of sherry. My roomates love when I make this. the Itailian stewed tomatoes make this good. If my pot was big enought I would put 4 cans of them in this.

We liked this but I did make changes to it by adding chili and cumin powder.  I also used the Jalapeno Cheese Sausage Links by Johnsonville (which are fabulous by the way!).  I also reduced the amount of tomatoes by 1 can and it still seemed like a lot of diced tomatoes.  Iused kidney beans instead of the white bean but only because I didn't have any.  I think the Sherry is what made this stand out flavor wise and will make sure to try this again with more modifications - only still will use the Sherry!  Grumpy said it was better the second day as he had the leftovers for lunch.

I used Johnsonville's Italian Style Chicken Sausage with Cheese to help make this chili a bit healthier.  The chili was a bit too tomato-y for our tastes and quite thick prepared as written.  I ended up adding  some broth to loosen it up.  I did add the cream sherry as directed, but still found it needed a pinch of sugar to offset the acidity of the canned tomatoes.  I kicked it up a notch with some chipotle chili powder which went very well with the cocoa.  If I made this again, I most likely would cut back on the amount of tomato paste and definitely add the chili powder for flavor.

This is a great recipe that we followed exactly and it was very good. Except for the black olives. We left them out. It doesn't call for chili seasoning so we went with a hot and spicy sausage. You can add to it if you prefer hot.

It was excellent.  I couldn't find cream sherry at the local grocery store, so I used cooking sherry with a teaspoon of sugar to sweeten it up.  I got rave reviews and even a few people asking for the recipe!! Thanks.

Loved this. Used hot Italian sausage since that is all I had and subbed carrots for the celery since I was out, as well as some Worcestershire sauce instead of the sherry! YUM! Will make again. I did enjoy it with the hot sausage but if I did it again would use half hot and half regular so that the kiddos would like it more! 

Oh, and I don't have a grill so I just chopped up the semi frozen links, cooked them a bit in a skillet while the veggies were sauteing, chopped them up a little more on my cutting board and then threw them in on top of the veggies.

My family loved this recipe - I did change up this recipe just a bit. I used some italian sausage from the Italian store in Dallas, Texas Jimmy,s (amazing sausage - reminds me of my childhood), removed the sausage from the casings and made them into balls, baked them in the oven before adding them to the chili. I only used 2 cans of tomatoes, 1 can of red kidney beans, 1 can of white kidney beans, I used moscato wine in place of Sherry, added Worcestershire sauce and sugar. At the end of simmering I did add tri-color cheese tortellinis, made some garlic, herbed, cheese bread and this dish was a big hit.

This was really tasty, but I added dried, reconstituted ancho chiles. Their smoky kick complimented the cocoa nicely.  Also, my tomatoes didn't have much liquid, so I added some beef broth and bourbon (hey! after all, this is football chili, right?!) Really gave the sauce an extra rich flavor.
