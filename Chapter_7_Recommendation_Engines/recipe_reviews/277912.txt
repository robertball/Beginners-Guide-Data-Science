I made this recipe with items on-hand because I had blood oranges I wanted to use but I had no grapefruit and no caramel sauce, and very little arugula, so I used baby spinach and a last-minute inspiration of feta cheese crumbles. So, okay, I guess I turned it into another recipe but it was so good that I'll try it again with the recommended ingredients!
