The sauce definitely gets 4 stars - really fragrant and delicious. I had a few problems with the lamb - I didn't realize the lamb I had was bone-in, so I browned it in a skillet, then threw it in with the veggies and sauce. I simmered it for about 2 hrs, then removed it so I could cut up the meat. Unfortunately there was a LOT of fat, so I ended up with not much lamb. The lamb I did have, however, was tender and flavorful. This was nice for a change but I doubt I'd make it again. (Oh, I omitted the raisins too)
