Outstanding.  This is a restaurant quality dish that requires the proper pallet.  I followed the recipe very closely, just had to add more tomato.....I used 5 very small romas and it was not enough so I added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, which then meant I had to double the pasta, I used 16 oz fettucine and 1/2 pound of pancetta that I made myself.  I did NOT add the mint......even though I have fresh in my garden,  I just couldnt imagine it with this dish....with the leftovers, I plan to add a tad to my serving and see if mint adds some depth.......overall.......very impressive dish......

I had to nix the tomatoes after a "roasting" disaster. Whoops!! But even sans tomatoes, this turned out AWESOME. So delicious...
