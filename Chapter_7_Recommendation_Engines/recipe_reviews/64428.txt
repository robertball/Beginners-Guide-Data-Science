The pineapple salsa adds a stand-out flavour, and these tacos are just as good with grilled chicken as they are with shrimp! The only change I made was to omit the reserved pineapple juice - the consistency of the salsa was just right without it. Easy to make and now a regular fixture on my weekly menus.

Very good, and super easy.  I cut the red pepper and garlic in half (both sounded like a lot to me).  So glad I did because the amounts were perfect!  I also decreased the olive oil to about 1/8 cup to reduce the fat - was still great!  I wasn't sure when to add the reserved 1/4 cup pineapple juice, so I left it out.  The salsa was was just fine without it; in fact, it would have been too runny with it.  I think next time I will add a seeded chopped jalapeno to the salsa - it needed just a little kick.  Note that you can cook these shrimp on medium heat in a non-stick pan on the stove - takes just a few minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very easy to make. I will not add the 1/4 C. of reserved pineapple juice next time to the salsa because it was a little runny. I doubled the amount of red onion in salsa and deleted the red bell pepper (my family does not like). I garnished w/ sour cream, cheese, geen onions,  and avaocado.

Very good & easy!  skipped the red pepper & used dried cilantro - also left out the pineapple juice mixed back into the salsa... not needed!  My husband ate a bunch of the shrimp on the way back in from the grill  - he thought they were great.  Will use the marinade again for shrimp just to eat alone.
