I read the other reviews before making this, and it is definately some sort of cake. I was actually looking for a cookie recipe, and found this recipe under that heading. As A cake I would rate this dessert a 4. I reduced the amount of cinnamon to 1/4, and the amount of vinegar called for to 1 tbsp, and added 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also used berry juice (Juicy Juice) instead of apple juice to strenghten the berry flavor of the batter, which I found worked very well. When I folded the berries in I allowed them to break up somewhat to add even more flavor to the batter, I also dusted the top with confectioners sugar, which presented lovely. This cake was fluffy and had wonderful rich berry flavor esp with the berry juice addition. I assume the reduction of the vinegar, allowed for better rising, and made it less dense then the others experienced. I suggest to anyone wanting a good breakfast cake, to try this with these changes it was very good.

I modified this recipe quite a bit but it was a huge hit. I wanted to make blackberry muffins. I read the other reviews first and added another egg as well as a splash of vanilla. Instead of apple juice I used lemon juice diluted with water, and instead of just tossing in the blackberries I pureed half a cup of them and stirred that into the mix, and then placed a blackberry on the top of each muffin in the pan before baking. They are DELICIOUS. So soft, fluffy and my boyfriend says they are not as overwhelmingly sweet as other muffins (he says they are almost tart). This is such a great recipe. I am going to keep it around and modify it accordingly - next time I'll increase the spices and do an apple spice muffin, and maybe also a blackberry-lemon muffin. Yum!!

This is more like a cake or a quick bread than a cookie, but I doubled the recipe, only adding half the vinegar like another rating had mentioned. Also, after reading how dense it seemed to be for alot of people, I creamed my sugar & butter, then added eggs & beat for around 3 mins so the egg whites would get nice & fluffy, then "folded" in all the rest.  The results were outstanding!!!  Made into cupcakes & frosted with cream cheese frosting. On my 2nd batch I added toasted walnuts, made it all the much better. Since I have such a hard time finding a moist zuchinni bread recipe, I'm thinking of trying that in the next few days.  Turned out very moist!!  Kids loved em'!!!!!

Taste was very good, but I found this cake-like dessert to be awfully dense.  I think it would benefit from the addition of a leavening agent -- perhaps 1/2 t. soda to interact with the vinegar.  Cream cheese frosting is a good idea!

I, too, read all the reviews before trying this recipe.  I took someone else's suggestions with the cinnamon, vinegar, vanilla, and Juicy Juice.  This recipe came out AWESOME!!  However, it was more like a muffin than a cookie.  Next time I think I will make them as muffins (topped with confectioners sugar).  Oh...one other thing....I also got the complaint about the seeds but they are blackberries so it has to be expected.  I think this recipe would work wonderfully with any berry (raspberries, blueberries, cranberries, etc..)

I made this recipe into muffins.  They turned out excellent.  I coarsely pureed the berries. Add 1 tsp. baking powder to the recipe.  I didn't have any apple juice, so used the same amount of applesauce.  Instead of all the sugar, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda, just to cut down on the calories.  It worked great.  Hubby said they were extra delicious.  YUMMMY!

This recipe was pretty good, but I had to increase the baking time to about 50 minutes to have the cake test "done". I used the toothpick test and at 40 minutes the cake was very wet inside. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used pear juice instead of apple (what I had on hand). I used freshly ground nutmeg, too. The flavor is good, and it's definitely a cake, not bar, recipe.

Followed this recipe exactly - except cooked it longer since it was still raw.  Not disgusting (so it got 2 stars instead of 1), but definitely not yummy!  I wished I had used my fresh blackberries for something else...

So good!  I didn't have apple juice, so I used the cranberry/blueberry I had on hand.  Even did this with my gluten free flour.

I only rated this 4 only because of the amount of changes I had to do to the original recipe but with the changes it came out a 5. After reading other reviewers suggestions I followed some of their ideas. I increased the margarine amount to 4tbsp, added another egg and 1/2 tsp vanilla and I added a bit more on the spices. I also dropped the amount of vinegar to 1 tbsp. I also didn't have apple juice so I added a cranberry/raspberry juice blend that I had on hand. I also pureed half the blackberries I had and folded that in just before adding the whole berries and that took care of the seed problem other reviewers had found. The batter was a beautiful purple in color. These muffins came out very much like a soft moist cake and not at all dense. My husband gobbled 2 of these up shortly after they came out of the oven and told me to make sure I don't lose this recipe. Thanks for posting.

They tasted like blueberry muffins, just maybe a little more cakey, and more blackberry-y of course. They weren't bad, but they weren't anything super special either. I did like the punch of flavor the blackberries added, and I tried blackberries in my banana bread, which was very good!

Very good!  These were gone in one day in my house.  Also there is not much fat in them.  3 tbsp butter may not sound like enough but it is possible to cream the sugar with it.  Directions are badly written unfortunately... Made a nice light cake that was delicious, made with frozen blackberries left overnight in the fridge to thaw & drain.  It is a simple cake with berries & spices - not a square.

Definitley a cake, not a cookie - but tasty!  Very nice spice flavor, very moist.  I served with powdered sugar on top and it was very nice.  Only complaint was the blackberry seeds - I'm going to try it again with blueberries.

These are really good.  I added more blackberries since I didn't want to find another recipe for 1/2  a cup, and it worked well.  There were tons of blackberries throughout.  I completely screwed up the baking bc I accidently turned off the oven in the middle and didn't realize until it took an extra hour to bake.  Oops!  My bad.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really think I've died and gone to heaven.  I used 1/2 t. vanilla as recommended and actually left out the vinegar (didn't have any).  I also used egg substitute and Parkay light.  This may be the most delicious recipe I've ever tried.

These were just OK. I didn't have any apple juice, so I used a Juicy Juice-like juice. Maybe the correct juice would have made the difference. It is a decent breakfast cake, but I would rather have something different for dessert.

This one was so good that when my husband came in and tasted it he asked me to make another one right then.  It's a very nice alternative to pies and cobblers

I took this to a blackberry party where everyone had to bring something made from blackberries. This was the only non-pie offering and was a bit hit, especially with the kids.

Did I do something wrong?  I thought that this would be a bar-type recipe, as I found it in "cookies", but, no, it is more cake-like, and a dense cake at that.
Very good, though, especially when I added cream cheese frosting.  It is a cake, though, right?

Allthough I am not quite familiar with this manic love for cinnamon that you people seem to possess I love this recipe. I am sure I will use it again and again and again and again!

I was suprised by how much the cake turned out to taste like muffins. i ended up cutting them into squares and calling them flat muffins!! my 6 year-old sister had to be told not to eat so many(and if there is such a thing as picky it's her) i also sprinkled a brown sugar and butter mixture on top to give it a little more taste. like suggested u definitely need to add vanilla and reduce the amount of vinegar! other than that, this recipe was relatively good!!

Well these are definitely a cake, not a pick-up bar... so they really didn't fit the use I had for them. They were, however, easy and good even without any changes to the recipe. They are moist and mild and yummy. They'd be great with ice cream or whipped cream on top.

This was good, but they are really more like a breakfast cake, then bar cookie.

Easy to make; children should be able to do it with minimal supervision.

Commom ingredients - berries can be store bought in freezer section.

Worth trying!

My husband does not like seeds with his blackberries. He thought this would be better with only blackberry juice and not the whole blackberries.
