It was very good!! I changed teh recipe a bit because I didn't have lemon gelitan or evaporated mil. What I did was replace the evaporated milk with a little bit of normalmilk and just cut the amount of lemon juice in half so it wouldn't be sour,but just enough to give it a hint of lemon.
It turned out great though!

I followed the recipe completely and it was great. I made it 2 days in advance because I was concerned that it might be runny but it wasn't. I served it at a baby shower and every one loved it. I put cherries in a dish on the side and let everyone decide if they wanted them or not.

Made this with a premade pie shell crust and halved the recipe, it was a perfect amount. However it didn't come out like my mom's which is almost exactly the same recipe so I don't know what happened. It wasn't really cheesy or lemony enough. Maybe I overwhipped the evaporated milk or didn't use exactly half the jello pack, who knows. Was a bit runny as well. Served with frozen berries boiled with sugar, water and cornstarch.

Excellent recipe as is. I usually make all the changes recommended by others but not this one. It was very tasty, received lots of compliments and looked wonderful in a glass pan. Thank you.

I have been looking for this recipe for years!  My birthday is in August and growing up as a child in the hot and humid Midwest summers, my mother always made this for me as my birthday cake.  She died suddenly 10 years ago before I was ever able to get this recipe from her.  I tried to recreate it on my own, and could never do it.  This is the one!  Thank you Dodie (and your mother) so much for making my childhood memories come true!

I have used this recipe for many years.  It is a favorite because it has less calories than any regular cheesecake.  This is a big hit for baby and wedding showers,too.

This cheesecake didn't turn out moist and creamy for me.  It had a spongy texture, and the taste was just okay.

This is a great recipe for groups. I am a camp cook and it's just what I was looking for for a cheese cake like dessert. I messed up and didn't read the recipe thoroughly so whip the evaporated milk, but it turned out good anyway. Also I don't think it needs the lemon juice.

I didn't want to go through the hassle of making a crust, so I just made the pie and filled up a 11x7 inch pan.  I substituted orange jello for lemon, since our family's not a lemon fan.  This pie was very sweet and delicious!  However, it wasn't the cheesecake texture I expected, since it was more like a very creamy-version of jello.  It was still yummy whatsoever and makes a great dessert!  As you can see, it's a very versatile recipe - I plan to use strawberry kiwi jello next time!

wow, very good people just loved it. I too made this for a baby shower and it was devoured. When I first made it I thought I screwed up because it was so runny but after it chilled it was great.

The cheese cake was easy to make, and tastes great! It does'nt leave you stuffed, just extremely satisfied. I highly recommend it, and I am a desert expert.

Yum!  I really like this, as does hubs, and I'm not a cheesecake fan at all.  Hubs pointed out this doesn't taste much like cheesecake, though; he says it tastes more like pudding bars or something similar.  Whatever you call it, though, it gets 5 stars from us, and it's super easy to make.  I baked the crust at 350 for 10 minutes just because I'm used to doing that, but don't really know if it makes a difference or not.  The crust didn't fall apart, at any rate.  I did modify the flavors based on what I had available and per hubs' preferences and request.  I made it a bit richer, I guess, by using chocolate graham crackers, strawberry jello (what hubs wanted and didn't have lemon anyway) and blueberry pie filling (again, what I had).  So, it turned out pink--not sure I am thrilled with the color, but oh well--and my pic looks different than as directed.  Still, it set up easily in the fridge and was easily served.  I'll make this again since we like it so much, and it would be a great dessert to take to a pot luck since it's light and very easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

The filling was very light and airy, but I was hoping for a heavier cheesecake texture.  It was good the first day but a little mushy after that.  I'd make it again if it would all be eaten on the same day.
