I made two small changes--I used chopped red bell pepper instead of green and I omitted the additional salt. I did use reduced fat mayonnaise. This did need a little more dressing, I did have to add just a little more mayonnaise/italian dressing/mustard to make it wet enough. We all liked this tuna pasta salad, especially me. Two of us went back for seconds. Out of that whole bowl, there was enough for one Tupperware container for my husband's lunch for the next day. I'd definitely make this again BUT I would increase the dressing ingredients to a half cup for both the mayonnaise/italian dressing and two tablespoons mustard. Four and a half stars.

I made this the night before a lunch and added everything except the tuna.  It was delicous.  The next morning before the dinner, I added the tuna and didn't like it so much.  So, 5 stars without the tuna!

Nice flavoring on the sauce, but needed about twice as much for the amount of pasta.   I omitted the tuna.   Next time I make this, I will also omit the egg, as I feel that added nothing, and will double the sauce.  I will leave all the veggies about the same.
