This was a pretty good Sunday night supper!  I used 1/2 c. water as the cooking liquid, and cooked for 5 hours on high.  After adding the barbecue sauce and the other ingredients, I felt the liquid needed to be reduced, so I let it go without a lid until most of the sauce would stick to the pork.  I felt the sauce was a bit sweet, so next time I will omit the honey in the sauce, as my brand of sauce is already sweet.  I also wanted to pump up the flavor a bit, and I added 1 tsp. adobo seasoning and 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika to the sauce before I reduced it.  I wasn't too sure about the slaw, but I have to say it grew on me.  The combined flavors of the slaw and the meat complimented each other, with the tiny bit of heat and tang of the slaw offsetting a little of the sweetness of the barbecue sauce.  I have to say that the BEST part of this recipe is using the Reynolds Slow Cooker Liner!  I have a 6 qt. pot, and it's very heavy and hard to manage during cleaning.  With these liners, it's a minor wipe up, and clean the lid.  I do not want to run out of these little cook's helpers.

I absolutely loved pulled pork. So I was very excited to try this recipe. I have to admit, it wasn't what I expected. I prepared it exactly as written with the exception of not using wheat buns (we do not eat those) and have to rate it at three stars for a few reasons. First, the flavor. I of course expected it to be somewhat sweet with the honey added in. It was TOO sweet. Also, the amount of barbeque sauce it calls for wasn't nearly enough. My meat definitely wasn't saturated in sauce like the photo provided. I added more directly to my sandwich. Second, the slaw. I love slaw, as does my kids. But this one was just not good. The honey, jalapeno and lime killed the flavor of the cabbage entirely (I like being able to taste the veggies too!) We ended up eating our sandwiches without it after all of us tried the slaw on a test sandwich. Another thing I noticed - the ingredients say 1 teaspoon cumin, divided. However, in the directions, it calls for 2 teaspoons cumin total. I ended up splitting the teaspoon as I rarely ever cook with cumin and didn't want to overdo it (I couldn't taste it so maybe its supposed to be 2 teaspoons.) Lastly, a note for people who don't normally cook pulled pork in a slow cooker. There will be a good bit of liquid in the bottom when you pull out the meat. The recipe doesn't state what to do with the liquid. I removed it as it would have been too soupy otherwise. We all finished our sandwiches, it wasn't horrible, I just wouldn't fix it again.

We loved the pulled pork and the easy clean up - the slow cooker liners are an awesome helper! I doubled the amount of barbecue sauce after reading other reviews and it turned out perfect. :) We didn't care for the slaw at all. The lime was extremely overpowering and not for us at all. We would've preferred a more traditional style of coleslaw.

My family thought this was fabulous!  I've tried several pulled pork recipes and this is by far my favorite.  The meat just fell apart...so tender!  I served the slaw on the side due to some picky eaters but it was also delicious.   This is definitely a keeper!

The pulled pork cooked wonderfully with the Reynolds slow cooker liner! It came out tender and juicy. We loved the mix of textures with the lime carrot slaw. Clean up was too easy. Will make this one again!

I really like it, reading all the others reviews I decided to add 1 cup of liquid  in my case I used beer, also I use  2 cups of  barbecue sauce instead of one,  once the meat was ready I took it out to pull the meat apart and use the remaining liquid to make my sauce more watery it really works , I had extra sauce to put on top of the sandwiches.

We love pulled pork. My family was surprised they liked the slaw on top of the pulled pork. Be sure to have extra BBQ sauce on hand, in our case it is Sweet Baby Rays. This was an easy clean up with the Reynold's slow cooker bag.

OMG Yumm. My family LOVED this recipe! We followed the pork instructions exactly as written, and the meat was super tender, juicy, and perfectly flavored. I loved the bite of the cumin. I adjusted the seasonings for the coleslaw to suit our tastes - I started with a 16-oz bag of slaw and used the sauce ingredients as written, then tweaked from there. I added more honey, salt, and pepper but didn't increase the lime and I omitted jalapeno (spice wimp here). It was the PERFECT accompaniment. My husband and I oohed and ahhhed over this one. Juicy, crunchy, fresh, and so tasty! I can't wait to make these again. Soon.

Loved this super easy recipe!! I used beer as the liquid but omitted the honey because of other reviews and didnt add as much cumin. Also added 2 cups of BBQ sauce instead of 1 because we like ours with a lot. Would do again!

This meal received raves!  Only 4 stars because I omitted the honey and used a mix of water and non lite beer.  I used a bottle of hickory & brown sugar BBQ sauce, which provided just enough sweetness.  Several people asked for the recipe, so I guess it was a success!

Used water instead of beer because we never have any type of light beer in the fridge. Left the BBQ sauce on the side as I am not a fan (added everything else accordingly) however the boys would have preferred the BBQ in the meat already. Used Broccoli Slaw and really liked the dressing. Cooked on high for 5 hrs. and it worked just fine.

We love pulled pork sandwiches, but not with the slaw.  Also, we preferred ours with the sauce on the pork, not mixed in.  The spices were good, I always add liquid smoke to my cooking liquid.  This recipe is flavorful and lends itself well to use in Mexican preparations also.  I used the pork to make pork nachos also.  Easy clean-up using the slow cooker liner.

Super yummy and easy recipe, my whole family loves pulled pork and this was a great recipe.  I used Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Que Sauce recipe from this site for the sauce called for.  Using Reynold's Slow Cooker Liners definitely made clean up a breeze, I'll definitely be using them again in the future!

Just made this for our work potluck and it was a hit!  The pork was tender and flavorful, the slaw was great with just a hint of  lime - refreshing.  Definitely will make this one again.

Thank you!
