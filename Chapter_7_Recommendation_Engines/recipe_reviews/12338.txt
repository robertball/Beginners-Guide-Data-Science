Last week I was out to dinner with my father in law, who saw grasshopper pie on the menu and fell in love!!  Apparently he used to eat in when he was younger and hadn't seen it in years!  Once he tasted it, he said it wasn't quite like he remembered, so that put me on the search for a pie he'd like.  This one fit the bill--he took the whole pie home with him after having a piece for dessert!  For people worried about the alcohol content, you can buy alcohol free green creme de menthe at the grocery store, which is what I did.  I used the same amount called for in the recipe and added a splash of vodka, since we wanted the alcohol, but it is easily made alcohol free for those who prefer it that way.

Wowie!  This is a dandy.  I took so many liberties with the recipe that it should have flopped.  It turned out fantastic.  Make this one.  You won't be sorry.  You could cut down on the hooch if you wanted, but why would you?

Our guests loved this.  Slightly boozy which my kids pointed out right away.  I'm knocking one point off, however, as the filling has a "whipped" trait which is not really to my liking.  That said, will make again.  PS  I bought the Oreo pie crust and its dark chocolate-ness was a winner.

I made this pie for Easter and it was great. I love grasshopper pie but never made it before. Very happy with the way it turned out. Two tips for success making it -  1) You must FREEZE the pie before serving it. The recipe states to "chill" it but it needs to be in the freezer to set. I froze mine overnight.  2) The food coloring is not necessary. The green from the creme de menth gives the pie the perfect "mint" green color.

Did the filling currdle for anyone else when you added the whipped cream to the  creme de menthe/cocao and marshmallow mixture? i think it may have had to do with the fact that after i made the filling i realized the crust was still really hot from the oven and so i waited until it cooled to fill it, leaving the bowl of filling sitting out in the warm kitchen for about ten minutes while I waited. Does anyone know how to prevent the currdeling from happening again? because the filling tasted amazing before the textural change and I think it would have made a really good pie.

I don't understand why people rate recipes and sy they are wonderful but...........and then change everything.  It is then not the same recipe. This recipe is perfect just as it is! I made it for company without trying it out first and everyone wanted the recipe, even my boss who says he does not usually like Grasshopper Pie.

This is my husband's favorite birthday dessert. I wanted to find a different recipe that used less processed ingredients. The only thing I changed was to use green Creme de Menthe and omit the food coloring. Very enjoyable pie â€” light and not as super sweet as other recipes I've tried. My husband now has a new favorite.

SO good!!   I used a premade pie crust & it was great, I imagine that a homemade one would be spectacular.  As per recommendations, I cut the creme de menthe down to a little over half.

I'm in the process of making this in memory of a very dear Irish friend that made one for our work group every year.  As I stood over the marshmallows and milk, melting them, I wondered....   
Has anyone used Marshmallow Puff or the marshmallow in a jar for this?  Seems it would be much easier.  Just don't know how marshmallow puff/cream to use and if it's as good.      Thanks

I made this for my boyfriends birthday because it was his favorite from childhood and he said it was "better than mom's".  I used Newman's O's for the crust and baked an extra 5 minutes.   This is an easy, light, perfectly balanced recipe I will definitely make this pie again and again.  Aimee P

My only comment is to stress that you buy (clear) creme de cacao.  The recipe is great, and simple to do, & is a nice dessert to do before hand.

Three stars because as good as it taste it never set.  That being said people were eating it with a spoon right out of the pie plate.  I probably wouldn't waste my time and booze trying to make it again.

Great recipe looks and flavor!!! Huge hit for our St Patrick's day party. One crucial step is that the heavy cream must be whipped first before folding into mixture so it does not turn out soupy. This is a must make again recipe for sure.

I have made this pie three times and it has turned out perfectly each time. It's light, fluffy, and a perfect summer desert. I personally do not find that it has an overly boozy flavor. I've gotten lots of complements from everyone I've shared it with! Most recently, I made a raspberry variation- I left out the Creme de Menthe, and pureed an equivalent of fresh raspberries with the Creme de Cocoa. It was fabulous!
