7.2.18  Carrots have become my husband’s favorite side dish (the man who wouldn’t touch them when we were first married).  I’m always looking for new carrot recipes, and this one’s a winner.  The orange flavor is dominant, and it has just a bit of sweetness, but doesn’t overpower.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we loved it!

This balance of sweet and savory is a perfect blend. I included it in two dinners over the holidays.

Wasn't fond of these.  Not just me, but nobody in family liked it either.

Made this to take to Christmas dinner at a friend's house.  Everyone loved it! One person said that she didn't usually like cooked carrots, but really enjoyed these.  I have made this dish before and will definitely make again!  I did not change the recipe at all.

Mmmmm.... Very good! I made them today for a planned meal for 8 people for tomorrow.   I am kinda thinking I should have made 1 1/2 times the recipe or doubled as I have a feeling it will be well liked!   Besides delicious it is a beautiful looking dish of carrots in the end.
