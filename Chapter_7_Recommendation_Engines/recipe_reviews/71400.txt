I was looking for a Dijon mustard dressing and nothing was fitting so i modified this recipe.

I used 1 large teaspoon of Dijon mustard and then eyeballed equal parts olive oil and  Rice wine vinegar. i didn't have the other vinegar, then i crushed fresh garlic. It satisfied my taste buds!!

Just whipped this up as I was serving dinner.  I wanted something different then the usual oil and vineagar.  It was very good.  I used a nice mix of baby greens as well as walnuts and golden yellow and regular raisins.  Awesome.

This is very tasty and is tangy.  I tried this as a dip with cucumbers and liked it very much.  However, if you don't like horseradish, you may not like it.

Love this! Mistakingly thought it said "honey dijon" and the family is raving! Tried it both ways and both are awesome! Served over arugula, with dried cranberries, roasted almonds, French's fried onions and feta cheese! I can't get enough! Thanks for sharing!

I had some Dijon to use up. I don't really like mustard things too much, but I do like salad dressings so I thought I'd give this a try. It was pretty decent, but the flavor was strong, so a little dressing does go a long way. The sweetener helped balance it out, though. I'd recommend this to people who like mustard more than I do, but I probably won't make this again for myself.

This recipe was a nice change from my normal dressing.  It was very zesty.
I used a couple more Splenda packets to give it a sweeter taste.

I made this to drizzle over a steak salad and it was great.  Really tangy, a little goes a long way, but really good...went well with the steak, grilled peppers and onions, spring mix, and the rest of the odds and ends that got thrown in.

I made the recipe but used real sugar instead of chemical sugar. It turned out great. I used it as a salad dressing at first, then chopped up a bunch of veggies and added elbow pasta and stirred in this dressing and it was fantastic!

I was very happy at finding a (good!) salad dressing that wasn't mayo based. My BF found the vinegar too overwhelming but I liked the tang. I've been using this throughout the week on various salads and veggie dishes just to add a zing! Used agave nectar instead of sweetener.

Deliscious, easy, storable for another day.  My husband loved this and he is Italian, used to just the oil and vinegar dressings.

This wasn't bad, but I cut the amount of vinegar and added honey and mayo to it.  Great starter recipe with lots of potential for add ons

Best salad dressing I've made yet!  Instead of using sugar packets, use an equal part of your favorite honey!  It is essential that you use a high quality apple cider vinegar for this recipe!  My partner tried this as well, and it was a smashing hit!

Excellent flavor!  I used 4 teaspoons of sugar instead of Splenda.  Served over mixed greens, chopped apple and walnut salad.  It's a keeper.

So I oiterally JUST made this like 5 minutes before writing this review. I followed the recipe except I used regular sugar (about 7 tsp) instead of the sweetner. I tasted it and all I could taste was vinegar and mustard...too much for my liking. So I had honey in the cupboard and I put a big healthy squeeze (did not measure) in it and whisked it up. MUCH better for me personally.

I'm sorry - I hate giving negative reviews, but I personally didn't enjoy this recipe. I was looking for something with a little tang to it, but for my taste buds, the vinegar overwhelmed everything else. I might try it again and halve the vinegar.  I did use this dressing on salads twice, once right after making the dressing and once after it had been refrigerated overnight, and I must say, allowing the flavors to blend overnight did help...but I still thought the vinegar was too powerful and I couldn't eat the rest. But if you really love vinegar, this is probably a great recipe! And I do appreciate you posting the recipe, ThymeForMe. Thanks!

I have been searching high and low for the perfect "sweet mustard" dressing recipe.  I'm tired of buying entire bottles, getting them home, and discovering I don't care for them.  Gave this a try by cutting it in half (since I was making a salad for just the boyfriend and myself) and using only one Tablespoon of oil to cut down on calories.  AWESOME!

This dressing is great.  I started the South Beach Diet and was having a problem finding a salad dressing on their website for phase 1 that was edible.  This was absolutely perfect.  Tangy, a little sweet and excellent ona salad with a little lean, sliced pork.  This is definitely going to be a staple in my new diet.

This was very tasty. My children are allergic to eggs and peanuts, they get tired of Italian and oil/vinegar dressings. I ran across this recipe and gave it a try...they LOVED it. (they are 3,5,13) I didn't modify it at all, poured the ingredients into the mustard bottle and shook it up. I will definitely be saving this for the next salad. THANKS

A very easy, tasty dressing.  The only change I made is to reduce the 4 packets of sweetener down to two.  (I don't care for too much sweetness)  This recipe makes enough dressing for my salads for the work week.  I whip up a new batch every Sunday.

Quite tangy! You really need to love your mustard and vinegar for this one. I didn't really like it, but others did. We had it over tossed salad. I do like that it incorporates splenda instead of sugar, but I don't think I will make it again. Thanks anyway!

I love this recipe I used 4 Tbsp of sugar instead and I added a little bit of honey. Then I actually used red wine vinegar because I did not have the apple cider vinegar! I love this recipe!

I blended all the ingredients in my single-use blender cup and it emulsified to a thick dressing. I can’t use sweeteners so I used 1/4 Cup of real sugar and I had to add 1/4 Cup of water (because it was too thick otherwise). It’s pretty yummy.

This recipe was simple and easy, just the way I like it.  I used all the ingredients except the oil and it tastes great.  My family and I all love this sugar free dressing!

Used honey and white sugar to sweeten to taste. Awesome dressing! It’s a keeper.

It turned out great. I don’t have artificial sweeteners on hand so I used a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of honey. Just perfect!

I was looking for something different but quick and easy to make. I didn't have any EVOO on hand so used regular olive oil, apple cider vinegar, the dijon mustard, and a little sugar instead of Splenda. I think it tastes pretty good! Looking forward to having it on my salad for lunch tomorrow for the full effect!

This dressing was so delicious and tangy! We cut the amount of sugar in half and I thought it still tasted sweet enough, but it was a really intense dressing, so maybe some additional sweetness would've further balanced it out. In any case, definitely a fun way to put a personal touch on any salad.

4.5 stars.  Used sugar instead of sweetener and added a bit of mayo to make it creamy.  Black pepper, salt, garlic and onion powders made it my own.  Lots of changes, I used the recipe as a starting point.  Romaine, cauliflower, carrots, peppers and tomatoes.

Not into artificial sweeteners, so I used honey and then sugar to taste, Dijon dressing with horseradish, and unpasteurized apple cider vinegar. Even my teenager loved it! 

Very bright flavor - ranch and mayo fans may want to look elsewhere.

I made it per the recipe the first time and felt like the mustard taste was a bit strong, so added a spoonful of mayo and it was perfect.  Whole family loves it!

Yum! I used a spicy brown mustard to tone down the horseradish flavor I find too strong in dijon. Buzzed this in the magic bullet. Serving this tonight with baby spinach. Thanks for sharing.

Loved this. Eased up a little on the apple cider vinegar (by 1/4) since others said this was too tangy, and added 2 good squeezes of honey (I don't use sugar substitute).  Really delicious.

I just made my 4th jar tonight.  I cut down on the vinegar tho, instead of the whole 1/4 cup that it calls for I use half water and half vinegar; much better.  I also used a very light olive oil called Tuscan Herb which I bought from a store that specializes in different types of olive oil.  Very, very good. Me and my husband love it.

The only thing I did differently was add a little fresh onion and garlic, then replaces the sugar substitute with honey. Ran it in a blender til smooth. Loved it!
