I made only a half recipe as there are only two of us.  I precooked the rice in beef broth and used Cavenders Greek seasoning.  Used a bit less meat but added some crumbled feta cheese to the cooled meat and rice mixture before stuffing the tomatoes and peppers.  We both loved it!!

I made this and is just like my moms and my yia yia`s, my moms mom.  I only used tomatoes however cause my Mrs. dosen`t like peppers. I also added about 5 peeled and quartered potatoes and baked them with tomatoes in same pan. Just add a salad and you have a complete meal.

I made a slight change with the last step. Instead of placing the lids on top, I made a light crust. A mixture of bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. It's how my Greek aunt used to make hers.

Delicious! When traveling in Greece, this was a favorite meal. Using really fabulous tomatoes is the key to this dish.

My mother in law’s recipe. I actually simmer the peppers in hot water not boiling  for a minute or 2. I  use the meatloaf package instead, of just beef. I find the mixed meat is much softer and tastier. I also use zucchini’s and add the insides  of both the tomatoes and zucchini’s to the mix.  I find dry mint adds a nice taste and  smell.

Tasty! I didn’t have Season Salt but created it from scratch. I only made peppers plus added feta cheese at the bottom of the peppers and on top. When I baked them I cut off some of the bottoms so that I could stand them up and not have to turn them. My mom taught me that years ago. I’ll make it again and up the seasoning a bit.
