Great, Easy and Tasty Soup!  I made this soup but I too baked the meatballs at 350 for 20 mins (just easier and less messy) and it turned out great.    Edited:  I've now made this recipe lots of times and now double the amount of meatballs & add finely chopped onions and garlic powder to the meatballs....my daughter's favorite part.  The recipe is a great base to add whatever you have on hand or adjust to your family's preferences. Thanks for posting this great recipe.

I added all the veggies direclty to the broth and cooked them. I didn't have ABC noddles, so I used elbow. I baked my meatballs in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. Then added them. 
I think the meatballs could have used more seasoning though. Kind of bland. Next time I am going to add onion, garlic powder, parmesan, italian bread crumbs & worcestershire sauce to the meatballs.

Very good & I have a feeling that the leftovers are going to be even better, although when I reheat this for lunch tomorrow, I might spark the seasoning up just a bit, as I thought this soup just needed, *scratches-head* ... something. I made it as directed, although I added bell pepper and some frozen corn, as well as a bay leaf while it simmered, which incidentally, I more than tripled. (The simmering time that is, prior to adding in the noodles - ditalini as I couldn't find ABC's - & meatballs.) My husband declared that it tasted like "Olive Garden soup!" and demolished his bowl, so b/t his 5 stars, and my 3, we'll go for a round "4." Oh, I also doubled the meatballs w/ 1 lb. of meat, figuring that I'd freeze the other prepared half for a different dinner night, but in all honesty, this could've used the double round o' balls.

My family enjoyed this soup.  I added some zesty italian seasoning to the soup to spice it up a bit.  The meatballs were bland in my opinion though.  Next time, I'd just use frozen meatballs.  Thanks!

Very Bland.  It's a good starter recipe, like it might be good for kids?  Which is fine, but one might want to put something basic in it like, salt.  

Sorry but we are used to food that tastes like something, the quantity of spicing up to make this soup actually taste like something is pretty significant... I would say to start with quadruple all spices.

This is amazingly good!  I didn't change a thing other than using ground chicken because that was all I had and adding a little onion to the meatballs.  That was it!  Otherwise the recipe is absolutely perfect just the way it is.  Everyone raved over it.  A very, very good recipe!

we LOVED this soup!!  i totally cheated with frozen turkey mini meatballs, but it definitely made it much easier and quicker to make.  my kids loved the alphabet pasta too :)  this almost tastes like a much yummier and healthier spaghetti-o's.

A bit on the bland side but not too bad. Skipped the potatoes since it has the pasta.

This was delicious! I used Italian sausage seasoning in the turkey instead of the various ingredients in the recipe (it ends up being basically the same thing...just more of a sausage flavor). I also used bread crumbs in place of oats. I did everything else the same way, except using orzo pasta in place of alphabet. The whole family ate it right up...I highly recommend it!

Absolutely excellent! I used lean hamburger and crushed soda crackers, fresh herbs for meatballs baked in 350 oven for 15-20 minutes.  Used frozen veg mix of broccoli, cauliflower, yellow and green squash, carrots on hand. Added a couple of bay leaves and used half cup of orzo pasta.  Very versatile and scrumptous day after especially!  Recommend you save and make this over and over!

I was expecting last minute guests and had very few groceries on hand so I had to substitute a few things.  I used ground beef for the turkey, I had no parmesan cheese so I left it out of the meatballs (how sad).  The only fresh veggies I had were 2 onions, so used them and used frozen mixed instead of celery and carrot. (We desperately needed to go shopping)  The soup came out so fantastic that I am making it again tonight keeping the substitutions the way I made it before, (except for the parmesan of course) because my guests even asked for the recipe!

This was super excellent.  I loved the tomato-ey broth and the meatballs.  I used rotini instead of alphbets, which I really liked.

If I had rated this the day I made it, I would have given it 3 stars.  I thought it was missing something. It also took me much, much longer  than the times given by the recipe. 20 min prep??? Really? With all that chopping and meatball prep? I also thought it needed to simmer longer, I gave it another half hour. Needed a large addition of ground black pepper for my tastes and a tad salt.  But it tasted soooo much better the next day and I am loving the leftovers. The meatballs were very good, I think it could use about a third more but not necessary. Didn't have quick cook oatmeal for the meatballs so used some bread crumbs and that worked fine. I added Tuscan kale, zucchini, and frozen green beans for nutrition and flavor. Also used ditalini instead of alphabet pasta. When using pasta in soups (if larger than alphabet or little stars like this ditalini) I have gotten in the habit of cooking it outside the soup, then adding just before serving and refrigerating the pasta separate from the soup for leftovers and adding just before reheating. That way the pasta doesn't soak up all the soup liquid and become mushy and turn the soup into stew. This is a very good, healthy, hearty meal for when you are craving hot tomato and veggie soup.

Yum! I was looking for a filling yet low fat soup and this one is perfect! I used what vegetables I had on hand and Rotini pasta. The soup would have been just as good without the pasta. I didn't use the tomatoe paste and I used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes. I think this is a recipe that you can change in many ways, but it always turns out great! Thanks!

Delicious!  I've never had much luck making soup, but this made for an easy, tasty, and healthy one-pot meal.  I mostly followed the recipe, though I substituted small pasta shells for the alphabet pasta, and threw in some kale and parsnips that I wanted to use up.  I think this recipe is pretty forgiving;  you could probably add in pretty much any vegetables you had on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good. I had to change it a bit due to what I had on hand, but it was tasty. The meatballs were very good (I used ground beef). I added some extra seasonings per our taste. I would have given it 5 stars, but my kids were only fans of the meatballs and ABC pasta. Husband and I enjoyed it all.

Outstanding! Very good flavor. Any pasta would do, but the kids like the alphabets. I used ground beef in place of the turkey...sprinkled a bit of Parmesan on individual servings.
