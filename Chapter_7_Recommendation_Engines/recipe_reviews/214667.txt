I thought this was an awesome meal.  Not too hard to make and not very expensive either.  I'm not a big pie crust fan, but this was definitely the exception.  Only thing that wasn't noted, was to cook the chicken before you mix it with the other filling ingredients.  I cooked mine in a skillet after seasoning the meat with chicken fajita seasoning.  I also used regular long grain white rice, as I am too cheap to buy instant rice.  I used about 1/2 cup dry to 1 cup of water and cooked for 15 minutes, then added to the filling.  I figured this way, it wouldn't be all mushy after baking the pie.  Will definitely make again!!

My Family really loved this pie. I used precooked chicken fajita meat instead of the breast and added some hot sauce for an extra kick. Overall this was a hearty satisfying easy meal!

WOW!! This was VERY good! I'd say this is up in my top 3 of dinners from AR!! It had been on my menu for almost a month and kept getting pushed into the next week, so glad I FINALLY got to make it! I did make a few changes based on our personal preferences. I left out the black olives  and the corn. Instead of Salsa I used 1/4C of Taco Sauce that needed to be used up. I also took the advice of Josh's Mommy and cooked my regular rice for 15minutes because I'm also to cheap to buy the instant rice! I threw in a handful of Monterey Jack Cheese that needed to be used up as well! I cooked the cubed chicken the night before and will do this next time as well but will shred it instead of cubing. This will definately be making it into the rotation of meals as we all enjoyed it! Thanks so much for such a simple recipe! :) **Note the chicken does need to be cooked prior to adding it to the pie and you'll need a full 8oz bag of cheddar cheese**

Oh my gosh.....AMAZING!  Will be making this over and over again!  I did use precooked fajita chicken which made the prep easier.

This was good but a little bland.  We added chipotle Tabasco and sour cream afterward.

I really enjoyed this but my husband (who will eat almost anything) really disliked it. So I went for three stars.

Yum, yum, yum!! So simple & so tasty! Change-I doubled the cumin cuz I love it. I'm not sure the prebaking of the bottom crust is really necessary, tho, as it came out a little well done(hard to cut thru). I'll definately be making this on a regular basis-we all loved it!! Thank you!

Very good...I shredded the chicken (which does need to be precooked), used cooked rice (because I wanted to use up extra rice I had in the fridge) and added a splash of hot sauce.  This recipe is worth giving a try.

This was really delicious and so easy! I left out the olives and sauteed the chicken in fajita seasoning first. I didn't pre-bake the pie crust- it wasn't necessary. I've made it twice now, and the first time I didn't have sour cream so I used cream cheese. I think both ways turned out excellent.

Awesome. Thanks! I used left over turkey from Thanksgiving and added a splash of hot sauce. Would have been great without hot sauce but I like adding it to almost everything!

really good recipe especially if you doctor it with the season you like.The ones she mentioned are fine but when you add some chili powder and a touch of cajun seasoning then you have a great combo. But i did use my own savory pie crust recipe and not store bought crusts.

This was excellent!  I didn't have olives and wanted a little zing so I added some banana peppers instead.  I also added some Chipotle Tabasco as another reviewer suggested and it turned out delicious.  I did forget the rice, unintentionally - but it turned out so well I would make it again the exacty same way.

I served this to company who absolutely loved it.  To save time, I used a rotisserie chicken from the store.  It really cut down on the prep time.

We really enjoyed this! I forgot the seasoning altogether, and it didn't matter because I used good salsa. Also ended up with expired pie crusts that smelled funny, so I used refrigerated tortillas that you toast in a pan before using. I used 7 tortillas to cover the bottom of a 9x13 and threw a few on top to finish it off. My family said they loved the crunchiness of the tortillas, so I probably won't bother with the pie crusts again. Also, I cheated the filling in the microwave for 5 min before putting it in the pan, and then only cooked it about 20 min in the oven. Can't wait to see how the flavors blend for the left overs! Thanks!!

Very good! I kind of added chili powder and adobo and other things here and there - still wish it had more kick.  But overall, this was a hit in our family and not too hard to make!

Very tasty, everyone loved it.  I left out the black olives, did not prebake the crust, doubled the cumin and added lots of Cholula hot sauce.  Turned out great, but still not enough of a kick for this Arizona gal.  Next time I will add diced jalapenos.

I made this when we had company over, and everyone loved it.  I did season the chicken with garlic and cumin as I cooked it.  I also used leftover cooked rice that was in my fridge, and I added a small can of diced green chilies.  It gave it more taste and a little more heat.

This was a delicious version of a pot pie. I had my mother in-law make me her homemade pie crust, and also used already marinade chicken from the meat counter at my local super market and the really added the extra taste to this. Also it is very important you use instant rice and not just regular. Regular rice will not cook in the bake time allowed.

We *loved* this. Great flavor, very filling and easy to make.  The filling dried out a little so will add another 1/4 cup of salsa next time.  Tried it with a can of Rotel instead of the salsa and loved it more.  Added 2 chicken breasts (not sure how much weight that ended up being), boiled with some salt, celery, onion, carrots and peppercorns then chopped. Cooked brown rice on the side (the full time, about a full cup of cooked rice) while the chicken was going - it added 20 minutes to the recipe but it was worth it.   Added an extra half teaspoon of cumin because we also love it.  Need to remember to prick a few fork holes into the crust (especially around the edge of the bottom) so that it doesn't shrink up next time.

I gave this 4 stars because I altered it a bit to give it more flavor.  As other reviewers suggested, I used a fajita mix on my chicken.  I cooked the chicken in a fry pan with the seasoning, then pull the chicken so it would have the "pulled" texture instead of cubed--personal preference.  I also did not par-bake the crust--put everything in at once and baked it....yum...yum.  DH loved it--so this will be something we will make again!

Super good!  We usually skip the pie part, and just assemble the filling as a chicken salad.  It's a great departure from standard chicken salad.

I likely will make it again, but probably will make some changes.  It was quite tasty but we were not all that impressed with the olives in the recipe.  I also did not add the rice, because it had enough carbs with the crust and the beans without adding more with rice in the recipe.  I will also add more salsa and cheese next time.  Other than the few things mentioned, I did find it quite flavorful.

I've made this a few times. I usually use a full can of corn and black beans, some extra cheese, same sour cream amount. It makes about double what I think is needed for the crust so I freeze the filling and then either use it in enchiladas or make another pie crust in a couple weeks when it's time to have it again.

So good and easy!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I was out of salsa and sour cream so I substituted low fat cream cheese and Rotel.  Yum!
