This is a great recipe.  I added some things - a tsp of vanilla to the biscuit mix, used brown sugar and cinnamon instead of white sugar and cinnamon and added walnuts to the apple mixture when I poured it into the pan.  Turned out great!

My family flipped over these! I changed the number of servings to 8 and then made a couple of small other changes after reading the reviews and needing to use what I had on hand.  I used butter in place of the margarine, decreased the water to 2 cups, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (and that amount was plenty!), used 3 TBS of cornstarch and added a good dash of cinnamon to the peach mixture.  I also used half and half in place of milk.  These are wonderful! The dough is easy to work with, the recipe if fast to throw together and the combination of flavors and textures is perfect.  My family can not wait for me to make them again. Thanks for sharing!!

Scrumptious- the aroma filled the house. The syrup you make with the peaches is very versatile- use it when making peach pie!

I love peaches and this dessert just gave me another reason to eat more of them!  I used frozen (thawed) peaches because it's only April, and it still tasted amazing.  I can't wait to make this again when peaches are in season!

Looked great and simple to make.  I cut the rolls into smaller slices so there was more of them.  They were the best part.  There was alittle too much liquid in the bottom of the pan though.

I used 6 large peaches, doubled the dough to make 12 rolls and baked 45 minutes at 350 in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.  Just the right amount of everything and made 12 generous servings.  Out of this world warm with ice cream.  You'll love this.

Mmmmmm yummy!.. This was a nice way to use up my not-so-sweet peaches from our tree.  The sauce was pretty sweet so if you prefer to you can cut back sugar to 1 cup.  I read a lot of reviews and decided to cut back the water to 1 1/2 cups for a thicker sauce.  I added some cinnamon in the peach sauce and baked at 400 for about 10 min. then I lowered temp. to 375 because they were browning fast.  I'd say this recipe takes moderate baking skills for kneading but not hard!

If you like cinnamon rolls, you will love this.  My husband had 3 servings in one night.  He actually said it was better than his mom's peach cobbler.  (That's saying alot!!)  Highly recommend.

This was a hit at a neighborhood picnic.  One suggestion--you only need about half of the syrup and you'll need to adjust the sugar and cornstarch depending on the ripeness/juiciness of the peaches.  I substituted brown sugar for the white in the whirligigs as one other reviewer suggested and it was perfect.

I just made these today. They are so fun and easy to make! I used butter and brown sugar and also half and half. These were great with the fresh peaches. Can't wait to try other fruit with them too.

All I have to say is YUMMY and I can't wait to try this with apples in the fall!!  I have been making these cinnamon buns with Bisquick for years--now with low fat bisquick, so this recipe was really easy for me.  My Dad who does not really care for peaches had more helpings than anyone--he LOVED it.  I added more peaches (both yellow and white)only because I love my fruit dishes full of fruit.  Thank you Tally for sharing such an easy recipe that I will surely use again this winter during those chilly nights.

These are great! I don't like cinnimon rolls with white sugar so subbed brown sugar and added a little lemon juice to the peach mixture. I was dubious that 1 min of boiling would give a proper consistancy so I boiled way longer than that. When it was the texture I wanted I poured in a greased pan. Also~ it was too sweet, but I don't know why some reviews are being so picky about that! It's fruit! Every piece will have a different sweetness level and astandard measurement will NEVER work for a fuit pie/cobbler/pie. You need to sample as you cook. I started at 1/2 c. Of sugar and worked up from there. I did forget to factor in the sugar from the cinnamon roll so it was a little too sweet for us. Also, next time I will do a rough chop on the peaches. I am wondering now if a can of peaches in heavy syrup could be boiled until thick and used as an lazy ice cream topper.

This was really delicious! I made a few changes based on other reviews. I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar for apple mixture.I also added a small amount of cinnamon to the apple mixture.  I will also double the roll recipe next time. I used 5 large fresh apples, and I could have used 6 or 7. All in all it was delicious and I would make it again.

This is really good!  Mine ended up too much for an 8x8 pan.  Had to use a 9x13 but that worked fine.  Wonderful flavor!  Will definitely make again but will use less water as suggested by others.

We liked this much more than peach cobbler.  I followed the suggestions of others and reduced sugar to 1 cup and water to 1&1/2 cup and used 6 peaches instead of 5.  2 cups water would just make it too soupy and it was still sweet with just the one cup of sugar.  This is really good, and I can't wait to try it with apples.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, loved it.

Very, very good with modifications.  With the addition of a tsp of vanilla, the pastry was terrific.  As written, the syrup is sickeningly sweet.  I'm very glad I read the reviews before making this recipe, as I halved the syrup ingredients AND drained most of the syrup off before putting it in the 8x8 pan.  It was still VERY sweet and moist - I cannot imagine what it would have been like if I'd made the recipe as written.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  Definitely recommend this delicious recipe but I can't imagine eating it as written.  Company-quality looks - beautiful dessert - but highly advise cutting back on the sugar!!

I did not care for this recipe. The fruit was swimming in a pool of goo. No one would eat them.  I was so upset to waste all of those peaches.  Sadly I wouldn't even try to make it again.

A great summer treat with fresh Georgia peaches!  I seriously doubted that the rolls would make enough for our family, but they were perfect!

I made this for dessert tonight and loved it.  I didn't think it was possible to beat my peach cobbler but this definitely does.  Can't wait to try it with apples.

These were okay. I thought the flavor of the biscuit mix was to much like a biscuit rather than a coffee cake type.  I will use this recipe again but use my own biscuit recipe.

This is great but WAY too much liquid. Next time I will use only one cup of water and also only 3/4 cup of sugar as it is very sweet. The rolls on top are YUMMY. I would make them to eat by themselves!  I will try this again in the  fall with apples. Sure it will be a hit!

this was a wonderfully simple recipie, and very tasty.  My picky nine year old loved it.  I think next time I will use less water to cook the peaches as it did turn out a little more soupy than i would have liked.  I also increased the cinnamon to about two tbsp. ( i just kinda dumped) will definately make again, and will try it with apples this fall.

Pretty good for a quick dessert fix. I took others advice and cut back on sugar. I used 1 cup and it was still very sweet.

Delicious!  I made this in the summer when we had an excess of fresh peaches.  It was delicious and easy, especially with a little vanilla ice cream.

These are very yummy!  Mine didn't really thicken up though - there was way too much liquid.  So next time I'll probably use a little less water in the peach mixture.  But the flavor was fantastic.  It's a lot like a cobbler.  So very good!

We rate this a 5/5 because it was sweet, kind of healthy, and it was kind of a breakfast treat but you could also have it as a dessert. It takes a while to prepare but it was all worth it.

I had to do a search because I don't ever recall seeing buttermilk baking mix but it is "a thing".  I guess they sell it in boxes like Bisquick but it is not very common on the west coast, at least in So. Cal. The recipe, however, looks great.

I mostly followed the recipe, with a few additions ,  1/2 c Truvia with the fruit, and some grated some nutmeg in the dough .  Because I'm lazy, I sprinkled the rolled out dough with Truvia and then a bunch of  cinnamon. The addition of raspberries to the peaches turned it   into Rosy Peach Melba Whirligigs.   Next time, will increase the corn starch to 3 T.

The first time I made this dessert, I followed the directions as written. I thought the syrup was too sweet and there was too much of it. The peaches ended up tasting just like canned peaches.
On subsequent attempts I reduced the amount of water, white sugar and cornstarch by at least half; added an extra peach or two; substituted brown sugar for the 2 TBSP white sugar in the roll-up mixture; added butter and chopped walnuts to the roll-up mixture; and added the peaches to the boiling water/sugar/cornstarch concoction only for a few minutes to avoid them becoming too soft.
 Note that (as directed) it's important to have the peach sauce HOT before putting the rolls on top. If you don't, the underside of the rolls will remain doughy and uncooked.
With modifications, this is a very nice recipe. I'll look forward to trying it with apples in the fall.

Super delicious! I didn't have fresh peaches so I used a 15oz can of peach slices in juice and chopped them a bit and followed with the rest of the recipe. This was very simple to throw together recipe and is so very versatile. We ate them with a side of vanilla ice cream. This ones a keeper!

I tried this tonight, and loved it. I used 7 peaches as mine were quite small.  I had some peaches in the fridge that were horrible to eat, so thought try cooking them, they were worse peaches I have ever worked with, they were dry and hard and plain awful. But this recipe turned out great and peaches tasted fine. I used all brown sugar that was only change I made, will certainly use this again and will try with apples as well.
