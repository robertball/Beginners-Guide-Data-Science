I think the reason for the poor reviews is that people don't know what a "Pudding" is. A "Pudding" is a dense, rich cake.  Sometimes with it's own sauce baked in.  This is supposed to be cake like on top and have a sauce beneath it.  Let it cool before eating and the sauce gets thicker. Serving it with ice cream or custard will cut down on the sweetness if you don't like your desserts sweet. I think the person who got a "salty" result may have used baking soda instead of baking powder.

We really liked this. Based on some other reviews I did modify this slightly and got terrific results. The cake part was the same but I reduced the sugar and water to 3/4 cup each for the 'pudding'. I used light brown sugar and got a thick pudding consistancy under the brownie. It baked in a convection oven for 35 minutes and I did let it cool and served it warm! Forget about leftovers!

I had a happy accident with this recipe.  Half way through mixing it up I realized I only had a half cup of brown sugar left in the house.  So I used it and a half cup of water and hoped for the best.  Gooey underneath, a brownie crust on top, there wasn't any of the wateriness that people complained about.  I made it in a round cake pan and it was so good!  I think I'll probably make it like this again in the future.  I used dutch processed cocoa too so it came out very dark and deliciously chocolatey.  Will be perfect with ice cream.

This was absolutely delicious and perfect for my pregnant chocolate craving!!  I have to say though that I tasted the batter and added more cocoa.  One tablespoon cocoa just wasn't enough.  I ended up with 3 tablespoons cocoa in the brownie batter and 2 in the brown sugar mixture.  It came out very pudding like and was just delicious.  The only other little change I made was to use butter instead of shortening because it's what I had.  Awesome recipe!!

Oh my gosh!  This certainly took care of any chocolate cravings I'll have for a long time.  I quadrupled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13 stoneware baker to take to a card game get together.  It took a little longer to bake than the recipe indicated, but the results were soooooo good with vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe!

Tasted a little bit baking-powdery to my husband.  I took the advice of others and used more chocolate powder in the brown sugar mixture, used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup water.  It was very good with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent, elegant, easy dessert, especially served with vanilla ice cream. I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa to batter (along with an extra tablespoon of butter) and to pudding mixture for a deep, rich chocolate. Yum!

I like a thicker sauce to the pudding, so I reduce the water and brown sugar to 1/2 cup of each and I double the cocoa (4T in all). I also sprinkle chocolate chips on top of the batter before I pour the water mixture for extra chocolatey-ness. This needs only 30 minutes to bake. Easy to make vegan with soy milk. I also omit the nuts. Delicious!

This was great!! I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers, decreasing the brown sugar to 3/4 C. and water to 1/2 C. (used hot coffee) and increasing the cocoa powder in both parts to 2Tbl. I also subbed  1/4 C. Splenda sugar blend for the 1/2 C. white sugar. If you let it set for about 30 min. after baking, the "pudding" part will set up and not be runny. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!!

I always try to make healthier versions of recipes but a lot of the time, they just don't taste that great. I'm so glad I found this recipe! It worked out perfectly. I took some of the other reviewers advice and added more cocoa but cut down on the brown sugar and boiling water (I used coffee as well). They're good on their own but they're even better with just a little bit of vanilla ice cream! Thanks for the great recipe Lynda!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband is English and immediately called it "pudding" when he saw it. I came across this recipe because I accidentally bought self-rising flour and needed to get rid of it. So, I searched for recipes that required all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt, and hoped that whatever amount of salt already in my flour was less than the 1/2 t needed (since the amount of salt in self-rising flours differ across brands). Then, I just used my self-rising flour and omitted the soda and salt. I heat up all leftovers (to refreshen the sauce) and pair with vanilla ice cream. Otherwise, it's too rich on its own. I will be making this again, since I still have 5 lbs of rising flour to get rid of!

This was very sweet, i would probably increase the chocolate and decrease the sugar next time.  It was actually better the next day right out of the fridge!

There wasn't much cake in this pudding but it was pretty tasty. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if there was more than a couple of spoonfuls of cake.

We loved this quick and easy recipe. A couple of things if you are like me you had no idea what a quart size baking dish would be. I used a 8x8 square and it came out super. Also, added double cocoa because my hubby likes things extra chocolaty. Didn't any regular flour so I used cake flour and they came out so yummy! Thanks for the keeper!

This is a very rich, very chocolatey dish. It is great if you are in the mood for a chocolate attack. I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa to the batter, as per other reviewers, and maybe 1/4 c semisweet chocolate chips. When it is ready, the bottom will be a thick liquid and the top will be sort of a crust. A dollop of whipped cream helped temper the sweetness of the pudding.

This recipe turned out great! I followed everything except I used just 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 of brown sugar. Other than that this brownie pudding was scrumptious!

I had to make a couple of adjustments, as I didn't have any milk when I decided to make this  lol.  I used 1/3 cup of heavy cream in place of the 1/4 cup milk.  Also, after reading reviews of the brownie part being dry, I added a dollop of sour cream.  I followed the recipe for everything else (didn't add any nuts). Baked in an 9x9 pan in my toaster over for 35 min.  I let it cool for 30 min before digging in (allowing it to cool somewhat lets the pudding set-up).  Topped with whipped cream.  Mmmmm!

Wow.

It had a very different taste and texture than I expected it too, but MAN it was awesome. It completely satisfied my chocolate craving. I didn't find it too sweet, or too runny. It's excellent when it's hot, but I'm letting the rest cool down for later. This is a great recipe!

This has the potential to be a great recipe but I should have read the other reviews before trying it myself.  After 40 minutes my pudding came out with a nice rich brownie crust but was still way too runny underneath.  It was also too sweet for my taste.  I will probably try it again, using the suggestions of other reviewers to add more cocoa in both the brownie mix and topping, cut the brown sugar by about half and use coffee instead of hot water in the topping, cutting down the amount of liquid there as well.  I think adding a bit more milk and/or butter to the brownie mix will make it less cakey.  I'm also considering leaving out the pecans - I didn't think they added anything special to the dessert - and adding a liqueur such as Cointreau or B&B to the topping for a more sophisticated flavor.

This recipe didn't work for me at all...all I was left with was a semi-crunchy top layer and chocolaty water underneath...and the top layer didn't even taste good.

This was delicious! It's like a crunchy brownie on top of a thick chocolate pudding/sauce. It definitely wasn't soupy and was just perfect enough for my sweet tooth.

This is by far the weirdest thing I have ever made. I didn't have any eggs, but the man wanted dessert, so I intended to deliver. Boo. The dough was much more like a paste, and the boiling sugar water you pour over the top was totally liquid, as expected. The directions say to bake until "set," and at 35 minutes, it was still totally liquid. I let it stay in until it had been about 50 minutes, and it was still pretty runny. After it started to cool, it became clear that the sugar had been boiled to the hard ball stage, because it became totally hard and sticky when you tried to eat it. The flavor wasn't great either, unless you like the flavor of dark molasses. I'm a total dessert person, and I couldn't eat more than a bite or two. Total bummer! Now I will have to soak the pan in hot water just to get rid of the leftovers. This is the first time in over 18 years of cooking that something just has turned out terribly. Very sad.

Like other reviewers, I also cut the amount of brown sugar (2/3c) and water (3/4c) in the pudding portion.  It was great and still very sweet!

I had never heard of this recipe until now.  Let me just say, I followed the directions exactly, and it was one of the easiest, most rich and delicious desserts I have ever had.  It makes the perfect amount too (not too much, so you don't over indulge!!).

This was very good, but that's after I cut the boiling water/cocoa/brown sugar mixture in half. Next time I will double the cake part (the first part).

Whoa! Holy sugary batman!  The cake itself is good...but the "sauce" is so unbelievably sweet!  I can't believe none of the other reviewers have mentioned it.  I may try this again, but I will cut the amount of sugar in the sauce down to a half a cup of brown sugar.  I have a massive sweet tooth, but this was even a bit much for me.

I use to make this dessert years ago, I thought this was the recipe & this is definately not it. I hope to locate one more like I remember it to be, I hope others that have tried this will try it again with a different recipe, because this is and awesome dessert.

This was really salty! I took the advice of other reviews and increased the cocoa and decreased the liquid.   I may try again with less salt.

This is very good, you cannot tell it's low in fat! My only change is that I use butter instead of shortening. I have been making this lately whenever I get chocolote cravings because it's so much healthier than regular brownies, yet there's still that rich chocolatey taste. And it's not too sweet either.

Everyone in my house loved this recipe! I definately did not find it too runny - the texture was perfect! I did cut the sugar down a little bit after reading the reviews of others, though. Great with ice cream on top!

This is delicious but it cannot be eaten by itself, and I am a chocolaholic.  I used it as an ice cream toppping, heated it up each time til hot and softened.  Makes a great topping, but is much too sweet to be eaten alone.

This dessert is also known as hot fudge pudding cake.  It is so easy to make and satiates a chocolate craving.  Leftovers are better at room temperature than reheated. I used a little brewed coffee in the water to give it a mocha flavor.

Delicious and oh so very decadent! My husband is dealing with extremely high cholesterol so I have done everything I can to doctor even the healthier recipes. I have made a few modifications to this recipe. For example, I used whole wheat flour in place of all purpose. I used coconut oil in place of vegetable shortening. I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the "brownie". I also added a palm full of dark chocolate semi sweet chips to the brownie. This was soooooo very rich. The hubby topped it with fat free chocolate frozen yogurt, lite cool whip, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles!!!! I do try. ;-) I will be making this for him again.

This was edible, but not something that I particularly enjoyed. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using only 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup water in the topping as other suggested. I will not make it again. The recipe for "Chocolate Cobbler" here on allrecipes.com is a similar alternative that I like so much better!

This is a very good, rich dessert--only need a small piece.  Great while still warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  This is a really easy recipe to make.  Although, I wasn't sure what "set" meant with this recipe, since the brownie part still moves on top of the pudding.  So, I think I cooked mine too long.  Next time I make this, I will know it's the brownie part that needs to set.  I will also use less pecans next time.  A keeper for sure.

I  am a great cook and my rule of thumb is to follow the recipe like your supposed to then the next go round make your changes. I new in my gut that I should of followed my glazed icing recipe athank u thow I love this site and use it frequently!!!

I've been trying to make this for years, that you for this recipe! I finally didn't end up with a burnt or watery mess, but got to enjoy a lovely brownie pudding I made myself! The only thing I changed was adding in heath bar bits. Very rich and yummy.

I added double the cocoa powder as lots of folks suggested. I also added 1tsp cinnamon to the batter. I love cinnamon and chocolate together. I used a loosely packed cup of brown sugar, which is probably about 3/4c, and 3/4c water. I think next time I'll use the full cup because I want a bit more of a sauce underneath. I served over berries and it was super tasty!

First I'd like to say this desert is a bit rich, but it tastes better when mixed with vanilla ice cream. Now, this is the second time I've made this and I ate right out of the pan and mixed my ice cream into it. Well, I didn't finish it, obviously, there's no way I could have eaten all that. But since there was ice cream sludge in it I wanted to keep it from rotting so I put it in an old ice cream bucket and stuffed it in the freezer. It never fully solidified, and tastes kinda like ice cream now! Totally freezing this whenever I make it from now on!

This was pretty good, but compared to the pudding part the brownie part was sort of dry--I'd try it again, just in case before writing it off. I used the given amount of topping, but tripled the brownie portion, similar to what others did, and the proportion seemed just fine.

Great fast recipe. I didn't have nuts so mine went sans. I also baked it at 375 for 15 mins. I used only 1/4 the water mixture. The batter tastes salty but the gooey goodness has nice texture and flavor. Not like your typical brownie but just as good

This was alright.  It didn't taste bad, it just didn't make me go 'wow'.  It smelled much better than it tasted, and the texture was a little odd.

I cut the sugar in the  second part in half like others suggested and STILL found it too sweet! The consistency is wonderful.. the bottom was rich and just thick enough, the top was chewy and really good. I used coffee instead of water but I think if I made it again, I'd use water... The coffee was a bit weird. My main complaint is that it's way too sweet... Other than that it was good.

I had a chocolate craving, and decided to try this. It was just "o.k." It didn't "wow" me at all. I'll probably just make it for my kids next time. Thanks!

Yum!! Very good, should be eaten warm from the oven with ice cream on top. I added a little more chocolate and less brown sugar and water to the sauce.

If you are a dessert lover, this recipe is not for you.  It had too many nuts.  If you cut the amount in half, I think that would be plenty.  A bit on the dry side.  I won't be making this again.

I wasn't sure if this dish was supposed to be covered, so after the baking the "pudding" stuff was all soupy.  The brown sugar, cocoa, and water mixture was way too rich for me.

Certain to satisfy any chocolate craving.  It was a bit rich for me though, probably would have been great with some vanilla ice cream.
