I have been looking for a snack that fits with my Keto Diet... Found It! Cheese Snacks of just a few Oz. are expensive! Sure they are made with "Just Cheese" and "Artisan" Cheeses to boot, but the price is like Prime Rib Expensive!
I made one change, since I used hard/block cheese, I cut slices, then halved those, then thirded those.. so a tiny rectangle about 3/4"X 1" , it made tiny crisps, but that makes it more like a snack, and less like a meal. 
I cooked them @ 400*f for 8.5 min. any longer and they got a twinge of over doneness taste to them... any less and the centers were slightly chewy. 
I also experimented with seasonings, like Cheddar and Taco Seasoning, Mozzarella and Italian Spice, Pepper Jack Cheese(by itself), and Jack and Ranch Dressing seasoning. All were great, and only took a bit of tweaking with amounts of spice, and time in the oven. It was a fun day. With loads of snacks to show for my time!! Equivalent amount of Store Bought snacks would have been prohibitively expensive! And I had FUN! You just can't buy that kind of feeling of accomplishment. BE

Perfect little snack.  This recipe is more technique than recipe, but it works very well.

Some tips:

-Use a 24 cup muffin tin to make perfect little chips. No need to use paper if it's nonstick, or use cupcake liners.
-WEIGH the cheese, then divide by 24. Now you have even portions that cook at roughly the same time. Put a little potion cup on the scale, tier it out, then add the correct weight of cheese.
-Cook only ONE cheese at a time per pan. I found that some cheeses (harder more aged) cooked faster, while others (the mozzarella especially)  took longer. Mixed pans make it impossible to time things.
-Drain on paper towel. Yes, they will be soft when you turn them out, but the added fat absorption will make them crispy and a bit less caloric. 
-Eat them soon. From past experiences with the microwave technique, I know these will only last a few days before the cheese gets 'funky' when stored at room temp. I'm not sure why, but it tends to go off fast. You could refrigerate or freeze them, but they get chewy. If that's what you're going for, have at it.

Yum!  I used this recipe as a basic method for making cheese crisps but, I varied the ingredient and experimented with a few different combinations.  My favorites were cheddar and thin jalapeño slices, mozzarella with minced Canadian Bacon (Just add minced pineapple and it would taste like Hawaiian pizza.), mozzarella and Parmesan with minced garlic (amazing!)

These came out great. Let them get brown over most of the cheese before you pull them like it says or the cheese won’t be crispy. I added salt right after I pulled them out to give them just a bit extra flavor. I would definitely recommend this for someone on Keto who is craving chips!!

These are super easy and super tasty. I make these to go with burgers instead of fries now, they work perfect! I like adding a little seasoning to them just as they come out of the oven.. ranch seasoning happens to be my favorite! YUM!

You can make these in the microwave too. I just put little piles on a paper plate a couple of inches apart because they spread a lot.  Watch closely.  If not done, you can put them back in.  So many variations in flavors and additions, just a fun treat.  They do shed a lot of grease so I put them on paper towels to absorb it.  Great cheese snack, less fat.

Been using Asiago Cheese. I cut it in thin slices and watch it closely. 7 to 10 mins at 400 f.  Make sure it's not too thick or pieces get too chewy.  I usually make a larger batch and keep it in a plastic airtight container. Great Keto snack.

I enjoy the store bought cheese crisps but they can be crazy expensive!  These are so quick and easy to make, not to mention - a perfect snack option for those following a keto diet.  I used a non-stick mini muffin pan.  I noticed less is more and you really only want to put a pinch of cheese in each - no need to spray if it's a non-stick pan!  Grease pooled on the top of each and I gently dumped it onto a paper towel (the crisps stayed put!)  I gave it a few minutes to cool, took a spoon and pressed the edge of each and they popped right out!  I put them on a paper towel to absorb a little more grease and tried to keep myself from eating them quicker than I could make them!  I used a small block of sharp cheddar, grated it and that's what I used - cheap and delicious!!

I make this with Cabot Vermont Sharp Cheddar. The flavor is most excellent. If you cook them till just the edges are brown. If you overcook, they are not dippable- they break.

Basic instructions for making cheese crisps and can be used with any cheese. Mine were parmesan. DO make small cheese piles and DO wait until almost all cheese is lightly browned. I made mine large and pulled them too soon: they were still tasty but very chewy.

I have made this and it's yummy.  it wasn't "invented" for low-carb diets, though. It's been made in northeastern Italy for centuries and is called frico.

I've been making these for several years. You can go bigger and make taco shells in exactly the same way, just fold them into taco shapes (over a wooden spoon handle or something similar) before they cool.
Note: This recipe also works in the microwave. Depending on your microwave, it takes about 2 minutes to do a platter. But you do need to put baking paper on the microwave turntable first, otherwise they'll stick.

Instead of baking in the Ben I could them in stove top griddle.  Easier way to manage the cook time, and I could flip them over.  
Love these!  Thanks for the inspiration !

These are great, especially if you love eating cheese and parchment paper bc it is impossible to peel off. Personally I'm not much of a parchment paper snacker, I'll get my fiber elswhere.

You can also do this with thin slices of cheese!
I buy Swiss sandwich slices, quarter them and bake for 7 min. I sprinkle some herbs or spices in too, too! Rosemary and a pinch of sea salt, chili powder or smoked paprika...the variations are endless!

Delicious cheese crisps.  Great for dipping and snacking.  I use my silpat liners for these and they turn out great and crispy.  I like to use a combo of multiple cheeses together also with a little italian seasoning sprinkled on top.

Baked them for only 6 min. Will do 7 next time. Used sharp cheddar, mozzarella and provolone mix, then made a 3 tray of a mix of the 2 cheeses. Turned out very nice.

I liked it but next time I’ll reduce the cook time.  They didn’t look done at 5 minutes so I let them go 2 more.  Next time I’ll stay with 5.  I’m also going to be trying other cheese besides sharp cheddar.  Not a fan.

I love these cheese crisps! Not only is it a great Keto snack for myself but my 10yr old daughter enjoys them as well. 

I can't wait to experiment with different types of cheese and seasonings.
