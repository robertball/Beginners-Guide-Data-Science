Chislic is a recipie that comes from South Dakota.  Original chislic is made from sheep or mutton.  Venison is also used in deer season.  These two meets make the best Chislic.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because I am glad it is listed but left a star off because there is way too much added to good meat.   As a native South Dakotan that lives in the heart of Chislic Territory I have to tell you that "real" Chislic is made from sheep (mutton) or deer (venison).  Cut it up in cubes as shown here, (no spices, no marinating).  skewer 5-6 pieces on sicks and deep fry for about 3 minutes.  When it comes out of the fryer sprinkle with garlic salt--thats all--you don't need all the extra spices listed in this recipie to make true original Chislic.  Chislic is traditionally served with saltine crackers and beer.  (It is not necessary to use skewers).

Very similar to steak bites.  Would make a great party appetizer although I would be inclined to serve it with a dipping sauce.  Maybe something like A1. There are a lot of different flavors at play in this recipe.  It’s a little sweet with a teriyaki flavor, but you can taste the chili powder.  I didn’t add any pepper thinking all of the chili powders were more than enough, but it definitely needs to have some black pepper to round out the combination of flavors.  My husband thought it tasted a lot like beef jerky and I was thinking the exact same thing. Also, you could use any cut of beef if you didn’t want to spend the bucks on sirloin, but sirloin is by far the most tender and juiciest.

My husband and I just tried these and we weren't fans. It was too sweet and the oil began to bubble from the sugar and the marinade.

Great recipe!  I made it with venison tenderloin.  My kids can't handle much spice, so I left out the chili powders and increased the black pepper.  I only had time to marinate for two hours, but the result was tender, flavorful, and got rave reviews from my entire family.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I made this for a farewell party for a friend moving back to SD where she grew up.  She was impressed that I made it and said it was delicious.  So did the non-SDers!

I could not find the Ancho Chile Powder in the local grocery store, so I just didn't use it. However, when I mixed the dry and liquid seasonings. it smelled EXACTLY like A1 sauce. I only made a half-batch (because it was just me eating it or so I thought), but it was the best chislic I've ever had. I had some friends try it out, and one even said it was the best they've had. Thank you Lee!
