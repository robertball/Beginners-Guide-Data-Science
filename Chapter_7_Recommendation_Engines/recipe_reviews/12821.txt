Because there doesn't seem to be a beach in N.J. that would allow anyone to cook on it, we had to take the traditional route and use the stove to steam the food. Of course we cut way back on the portions and timing is everything when you do it this way. Potatoes would have to be cooked first and so on. This is an excellent dish for anytime of the year but an even better one in the summer when you and your friends can just kick back and really enjoy this fabulous feast! Great Star!!!!

I grew up in Maine, but now live in the Midwest. On a trip back to my home state I loaded up a cooler full of the seafood straight out of the fish markets and drove straight back only stopping to refill the ice. The next day I invited a big group of friends out to a lake ( close enough!) and followed these directions. Fantastic! The seaweed I dragged all the way from Maine was novel enough to make the whole excursion!

Loved this, loved this!  We spent a day on the Oregon coast clamming and crabbing.  Pit cooking just brings out all the flavor of the seafood.  Instead of lobsters, we used dungess crabs and halibut instead of cod.  No body likes sweet potatoes so I increased the amount of white potatoes.  Fantastic.  Just remember to bring lots of napkins and big hefty plates to enjoy this properly.

This makes for a great day at the beach! We used less variety (no sweet potatoes, or sausage or bratworst, or mussels, for example) but the flavor of the fresh-cooked meal brings you to heaven's gates!  And the aroma is indescribable!  Any combination of seafood and roastable vegetables works, or even just clams, lobsters, and corn.

This is one of the best ways to have a Clam Bake, and the seaweeds a must. I grew up and live in Rhode Island and look forward to a summer time clam bake every year. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.
