I had half of a leftover "mexican"-spiced chicken breast in the fridge that I didn't know what to do with so I cut some of it up and used it in this recipe. I didn't use a whole lot of ranch dressing, just enough to make everything a little wet. This was good--nice way to use up a little bit of odds and ends in the fridge. Next time I'll use salsa instead of green chilies.

Delicious! I used really small flour tortillas and it came out to 8.  I made them exactly as stated. The hubby and the kids loved them too!!

Instead of using shredded cooked chicken, I used Oscar Meyer southwestern seasoned chicken grilled chicken strips. For two people, it calls for a 1/2 c, but I probably used about a cup. I also used a quesadilla blend cheese because it had more than just monterey jack cheese in it. I also definitely used more than 1/2 cup of cheese (the amount called for for two people). I omitted the chiles and added some green pepper and red onion, I didn't really measure, but I'd guess it was about 2 1/2 Tbsp. This really added good flavor and tasted amazing with all the melted cheese and chicken. To cut back on calories, I used the "Just 2 Good" Ranch...and you really can't taste the difference. These were SOOOO good! I made them with Lipton spanish rice on the side,and my boyfriend and I loved them!! You must try this recipe!!

These were easy and great. I tweeked the ingredients and added black beans, and green onions. I also used southwest ranch instead of regular. Being health conscious I used low fat cheese, ranch, and high fiber tortillas. It was great!

I made this recipe as written, except I cooked the quesadillas in my quesadilla maker. The chilies and ranch are a strangely good combination. We enjoyed these.
