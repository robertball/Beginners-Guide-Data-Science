This recipe alone is very bland, if you want yummy flavorful pancakes either add lemon zest and the juice from one lemon plus 2 tbls. sugar, or 1 tsp. Vanilla plus 2 tbls. of sugar. Other than that it's a great base recipe.

This is my family's favorite pancake recipe! We like it as is, but for a change up you could add a pinch of nutmeg, lemon zest or vanilla. It's great with fresh berries or peaches too. Note: The fluffier you whip the egg whites the fluffier the pancake! :)

Such a nice change from my regular pancake recipe. The ricotta adds a really nice texture, and i LOVE the fact that there is no butter, oil or sugar in the batter. My husband always tops his pancakes with butter, but said these pancakes don't need any! Will be making these again.

Had some leftover ricotta and tried this recipe. Bought more ricotta and made them again! They were just as wonderful the second time. I make a batch of pancakes, freeze the extras, and microwave them at a later time. I was afraid that these would not reheat well but they are great. My all time favorite pancake recipe. I topped with either strawberry or blueberry jam - like eating fluffy cheesecake. Dessert for breakfast - it doesn't get any better.

Used whole wheat and white flour combination. Added only blueberries. My husband said it was like eating cream cheese frosting with blueberries. That's a compliment in his book. They were rich and thick and felt sinful.

Delicious!! Here were my changes: I used whole wheat flour, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 cup sugar. Also I didn't separate the eggs.

I made this recipe this morning - it was fantastic!  I have tried other ricotta pancake recipes on this website & have not been too impressed, but this one was VERY GOOD!  I did not have a real lemon to add the lemon zest, so I added a squirt of lemon juice out of a bottle.  Not bad, but I am sure the real lemon peel would be even better.  I will certainly do that next time.  :o)

I also did not have any Canola Oil, so I used regular butter.  Very Tasty!

I also added 1 tsp of baking SODA, in addition to the baking powder.  I don't know what that stuff does, but I had used it in other pancake recipes & they came out light & perfect.  

The texture of these pancakes was what impressed me the most!  Moist, soft, fluffy, yet had the creamy texture from the ricotta.  They were just perfect, even at my high altitude on Colorado Springs!

This recipe was successful and I will make it again. I found they cooked better at 425 degrees on my griddle and it took longer than 1-2 minutes per side. They shrink up a bit, so when you place the batter, spread it out some. This helps them to cook a little faster, too.

We really liked these! Pretty rich so won't make often, but sometimes we have extra ricotta & this is a perfect way to use it.

I've had excellent ricotta pancakes in the past (at a favourite brunch place in San Francisco) & I was really hoping that these would compare... but unfortunately they missed the mark. The only alteration to the recipe I made was adding a tsp of vanilla paste. Over all, they were okay. Edible, for sure. But the consistency was just too gooey for me. I think that if I were to ever make again, I might stick to making really SMALL & thin pancakes.

I read all the reviews and thought, pancakes don't have much flavor so why be critical of the flavor!!  I made them just as the recipe said too and they were light, fluffy, and a wonderful change from cakey regular pancakes!  We had rasberry syrup on hand and that was the perfect touch.  I suppose if you don't want to use syrup you would put sugar in the pancake with other flavorings, but as far as a pancake goes, I give it 5 stars.

I must done something wrong as I had to add a lot of milk to make it anywhere near pourable.  Once cooked, they were too heavy/fatty for my taste.

10.20.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/242225/the-best-ricotta-pancakes/ ... As of now, I'm blaming myself for the denseness; thinking I didn't whip well enough.   These were dense babies.  Oh, so dense, heavy.   If I attempt again, I'm thinking a hit of baking powder/soda could make a substantial improvement - or adding some ricotta to m'regular staff.  :D

Not my favourite. They were really wet and difficult to cook through all the way. Also, there;'s so muchg ricotta the texture is really fatty, but without the sugar is seems out of balance.

i used 1/2c whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose. I also used low fat ricotta cheese. The pancakes were tasty and it is good to know that there is some nutrition in them as well as taste. I will make tyem again.

The concept of ricotta in pancakes was interesting in terms of taste and texture.  My biggest complaint is that these were nowhere near as fluffy as regular pancakes.

Didn't like at all. Bland. I expected a caky, fluffy type pancake, but the insides seemed undone. I even tried baking a while to see if the inside would be done. Maybe I did something wrong, but I won't be making again.

I halved the  baking powder and whipped the egg whites to semi-stiff as I don't love the taste of baking powder and they turned out so great that between my two adult children and a a friend I only got one small pancake....next time I will double recipe !

I liked this a lot! Very fluffy, creamy pancakes! I added a bit more flour (to a half recipe I added 1/2 cup of flour instead). I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. Thanks for a great base recipe that you can add different flavors to! I might add some lemon zest next time!
