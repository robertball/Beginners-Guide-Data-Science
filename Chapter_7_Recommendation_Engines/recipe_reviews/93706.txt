This biscotti has a delicious flavor and a crispy texture. My family loves chocolate so I used 2/3 cup of European cocoa, which is much richer than regular cocoa and 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips. The texture is crispy crunchy, but not so much that you feel like you're going to break a tooth.

I enjoyed these. But I am a major chocolate lover, and didn't find them quite chocolatey enough. Next time I'll probably add a little more cocoa.
