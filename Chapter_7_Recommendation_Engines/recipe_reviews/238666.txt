The 16 year old 'eaters' said, "The Piggiest Eaters LOVED this!"  It was gone, gone, gone!  The 'Bomb dot Com" was uttered along with the sounds of OH MAN.   I think this was a hit!

made this and everyone loved it! I served it hot out of the oven but would suggest that you let it cool before serving.

Loved this. Made a double batch and used more cheese but either way it was super delicious! Will make again.

Really good stuff.  Got lots of complements.  I used a smaller pan than what it called for so I think that's why mine was runny.  Definitely recommend using a somewhat thick brand of tortilla chips.

Oh my gosh... Everyone loves a Mexican layer dip. But this is the absolute best one I have ever tasted! I've made and served this twice and both times I had many compliments and requests for the recipe. Give it a try and see?..

This is delicious, a big hit at parties. I add fresh garlic ( 2 pressed cloves). And I like to experiment with various flavors of salsa and refried beans. Jalepeno adds a nice kick and love the flavor.

I absolutely love this.. it's my fave and definitely the first to go whenever I bring to an event, some times I put sliced jalape√±os for an extra kick and makes great left overs thank you thank you for this amazingly delicious and easy to make meal...nummy nummy :)
