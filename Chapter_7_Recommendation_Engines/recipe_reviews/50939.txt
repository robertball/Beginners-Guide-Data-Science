I have also saved all of the marinade, put it on the stove bring to a boil(to kill off any bad chicken germs). Then added some cornstartch to thicken. Dunk or drizzle over the cooked skewers just before serving..yummy!..going to try them out on my Japanese friend tommorrow for s-bowl. We will see how a 'expert' rates them :-)

I marinated this too long (overnight). It broke down the texture of the chicken into mush, so we didn't eat it. The flavor was good, so I will definately try it again but only marinate it the recommended 15 minutes!

This is excellent!  I made it just as the recipe said, but cooked it on a grill instead of under the broiler.  Came out just great!  Served with Peanut Noodles from this site and had a great meal.  This definitely is a family favorite. Thanks Dakota!

Instead of discarding the marinade, pour it into a little pot and cook to reduce until slightly syrupy, then serve a little over rice. Note: If it is too salty for your liking, add a little more sugar to balance the flavor.

Wonderful.  I doubled the marinade and made 1.5 pounds of chicken with 1/2 pound of fresh shrimp.  I did not skewer the meat and leeks, just threw it all on the pan together.  I'll definitely make this again, maybe next time using all shrimp.

My family really liked this recipie, despite the fact that I let the chicken marinate overnight, which made the soy sauce flavor too dominant.  The next time, I'll follow the recipie or use less soy sauce.  Overall, it was a quick and easy dinner.  I served the chicken with brown rice and broccoli, and we had no leftovers.

Great recipe, I make it all of the time!  I make it without the leeks and cut the chicken into strips instead of cubes to make it more like the yakitori restaurants we have locally.  Great summer grilling recipe too!

A great base recipe.  I have made this a few times, and changed it each time..but the base as written is very close to the Japanese place that we enjoy.  Highly recommended.

Didn't care for the combination of chicken, marinade, and leeks.  The leeks didn't cook up well and they couldn't decide if they were going to be "onion"-ney or if they were going to try to mimic the flavor from the chicken.

Great recipe. Instead of putting in the oven, I put my skewers on the grill.  I used bamboo skewers soaked in water since I don't have metal ones.

I made this recipe last night, but only had 1/4 cup of soy sauce, so the ginger was pretty over powering.  I used the marinade as a dipping sauce to enhance the flavor of the Chicken.  It didn't taste much like the Yakitori you get in Japan, but was a nice change.  I may try again with the correct amount of soy sauce, just to use up the Sake.

This was so good that my husband was asking me to make it again before we were even finished eating it.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground ginger, and it turned out very well.

This was just great.  Wasn't terribly fond of the leeks but the chicken was out-of-control good.  I cooked it at home and took it to my boyfriend's house.  My mother actually called me on the phone to ask me what I had cooked that smelled so good.  Excellant recipe!

I have made this recipe a few times and it always comes out perfect.  I do everything as written except:  I don't use the leeks and we grill the skewers.  It has a great flavor and the chicken comes out very tender.  It's terrific.  I pair the leftovers with the Simple Spiced Rice from this site, add my favorite stir fry vegetables and make fried rice in my wok.  Excellent.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was really good!  Juicy chicken, very flavorful - even the onions were tasty.  I broiled them because it was too cold out and they turned out great - will def make again.

Awesome recipe!  Easy, Fast and excellent flavor.  I prefer to marinate it for 4-5 hours and baste on each side during cooking.

I made this last night and I follwed the recipe to a T.  It was way too salty for my husband and I and I like my food salty.  The only flavor that I noticed was the soy sauce.  Not even the ginger or garlic.  I think that this recipe would be better stir fried.  I will try this recipe again.

I had rave compliments for the yakitori chicken sticks I prepared. I didn't have sake on hand so I substituted with white wine.  The leftovers I broiled them in the oven and they came out perfect!  Recipe was awesome!

This a very flavorful and simple dish to make. The marinade is very potent, so the meat does not need long to absorb the flavor. I let the chicken sit in the marinade for right at 15 minutes and it was PERFECT. I make this dish all the time and the whole family loves it, including my 3 year old!

Great and easy recipe to follow; I doubled the recipe. I read all the reviews about the chicken being too salty from marinating overnight, so I just added an extra cup of water and it came out perfect when I broiled it the next day. I also skipped skewering the leeks because it kept breaking into small pieces when I put it on the skewer, so I just broiled the chicken skewers on top of the cut leeks and served it with it.

I've been making this yakitori chicken for about 8 years now. We love it as much as day one! And now my two boys (7 & 3) are wild for it, too. When I prepare this, I marinate for no more than 30 min. Learned the hard way on that. Much longer and the chicken is way too salty. We skip the leeks and serve it with Weight Watchers fried rice recipe.
