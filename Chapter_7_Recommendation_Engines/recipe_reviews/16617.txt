My entire family loves these cookies.  My family begs for them!  I would suggest using 4 TBsp of cocoa, butter rather than margarine, smooth PB and 3 1/2 cups of oats.  Small changes but they make a world of difference. I have tried every which way and this is the best.  If you do it just right, they set up in about 15 minutes.

I've been having issues with these not turning out too! I have a different version of "rolling boil" every time I do it. According to the blog All in Good Food he decreases the sugar to 1 and 3/4 cup *this effects the sugar concentration* and brings to 230 degrees F under med-high heat. Just like fudge, if it's raining or humid, you will need to boil a bit longer (but not above max soft ball stage) so the cookie will suck moisture out of the air. Have all your ingredients pre-measured b/c this moves fast after removing from heat.

The perfect no-bake flavor.  I used creamy peanut butter instead of chunky, and if you do that I suggest adding a bit more oats, as they'll be kind of thin.

This recipe is messed up. I went digging in my closet to find my orginal no-bake cookie recipe. When I compared the two recipes, I found that they had the same ingredients; however, the ratios and the cooking processes were different. The oatmeal has to be added before the peanut butter because the peanut butter cools the mixture down. If you don't, your oatmeal stays firm. The desired texture for these cookies is a slighty softened oatmeal. I would look for another recipe if you prefer a more original style no-bake  cookie. I hope this helps.

These turned out absolutely perfect!  Don't be afraid to use whole oats if you don't have quick oats....doesn't make a difference.  I made it EXACTLY as stated.  I have made no bakes in the past and had them either set up to fast, or never set up.  I would say the directions to this recipe are perfectly on target!

These were a hit and easy to make! I used splenda, skim milk, light peanut butter, and light margarine, and they still tasted great.

These are just like I remember as a kid.  Sometimes I just throw them into a 9x13 pan instead of drop by teaspoon.  Very tasty.

I give this five stars because they came out exactly as they were meant to.  Following the advice of other posters I doubled the cocoa (used good quality cocoa), used creamy PB, and even reduced the butter a bit.  Boiled for about 90 seconds.  They set up perfectly and were ready to eat in LESS than an hour.  I love making these when I need a quicky fudgey chocolate fix.  Oh forgot... I used 2 1/2 cups of oats and 1 cup of coconut.  I think it would be good with just the 3 cups of oats too.

I love this recipe because it has more cocoa than other ones. It has 1/4 c instead of 2 tablespoons. This made a huge difference in the turn out. They turned out more rich and not so dried out as those recipes that call for only 2 tablespoons. My family loves these cookies, and everytime I make them I come right back to this exact recipe to make sure I make them the same way.

This is the best No Bake Cookie Recipe I've found. Have made it with both chunky and creamy peanut butter and we like it both ways. I set my kitchen timer to one minute after the mix has started boiling and have never had a problem with them setting up.

yummy! the best no bake cookie on this site in my opinion.. I use creamy peanut butter mainly because that's all i buy and I wasn't about to go get chunky just for this recipe. It is really funny how every one is reviewing to change the cocoa to 4 tablespoons instead of 1/4 a cup... because 4 tablespoons is 1/4th a cup....im sure it was a huge improvement for everyone who did that.. ha

I thought 2 cups was a lot of sugar, so I made it 1 1/2 cups and they were plenty sweet. I doubled the cocoa (per reviews) and used 1/4 cup butter and made milk 3/4 cup to compensate for the missing liquid.  I also used reduced fat peanut butter.  They ended up with a fudgy, slightly sticky texture but I wasn't sure what the original texture should be so I don't know if my reduction of butter did that.  The only bad thing was they had a kind of raw oatmeal flavor but I didn't mind. In the end, they curbed my sweet, chocolate craving and were a little healthy to boot. I would make them again for the same reason.

My husband loves these cookies.  They are a must at Christmas at our house.  The only difference I make was to increase the vanilla to 2 tsp.  Very good!

Pretty tasty. I use real butter only, instead of margarine. If you only have "old fashioned oats" and want them to be more like "quick oats", just pulse them a couple of times in a food processor.

Betty, I'm cured!  I've been going nuts looking for this recipe since gradeschool.  I tried others which didn't quite hit the mark.  This one is it!  Just as another reviewer added, I believe the key is the extra cocoa powder.  These tasted wonderful, and set perfectly.  My only complaint is that you didn't provide an excuse to tell my husband when he comes home to only find about 10 left!  Admittedly, I ate 1/4 of the batch before actually dropping them onto the wax paper.  Oops!  Thank you, Betty!

I've made these often, but due to my son having a peanut allergy I replace the peanut butter with sunflower butter.  It's a bit pricey, and hard to find, but taste delicious!  It's a peanut butter substitute that is made with ground up sunflower seeds. It also worked perfect in this recipe since it looks just like peanut butter and has the exact same consistency!  Just thought I'd let other people know that they can enjoy these yummy cookies even if they are allergic to peanuts.  Yummy for the whole family!

I grew up on this cookie, so making them always zips me right back to my childhood. Mom has been gone for years, and this year my sister asked me to make some for Thanksgiving; they were gone in no time! The thing to remember with these cookies is that you are basically making fudge with oatmeal in it. Having it come to the FULL boil, and letting it boil long enough, are crucial to them setting up properly. If you're in doubt you've cooked it long enough, use a candy thermometer and make sure you're in the 235-240 ballpark and you should be fine. Enjoy!!

One Tip!  Omit the Cocoa for a delicious peanut butter version!

all no bake cookies are not created equal.  Some recipes  make cookies rubbery or tasteless and aren't worth eating.  I set out to find the perfect recipe I grew up with -- and I found it!  Thank you!

My oh my.  I couldn't even wait three minutes for these to cool before trying them, much less an hour.  Delicious.  Divine.  My tips:  butter instead of margarine, 3.5 cups of oats, and I put the last four ingredients in a bowl before I started on the stovetop.  Once my stovetop ingredients boiled, I poured that mixture into the bowl and mixing it all went very smoothly.  I also used a medium cookie scoop, and I got 30 cookies, all the same size.

This recipe is the chocolatiest version on this site, you may think this is crazy, but I add 1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper along with the salt, it really brings out the cocoa flavor, and NO it doesn't make them spicy my 5 and 1 yr. old love these!

These are great! I remember making these at girl scout camp when I was a kid. A favorite at our house for sure. I ran out of sugar and used about 1/3 c brown sugar for the rest and they turned out so delicious and not as dry when they cooled.
UPDATE: 03/22/14 I made these again only this time I used all white sugar except I was out of vanilla. It didn't matter. The taste was fantastic and as good as always! I tossed in some raisins on a whim and these were even better! Now I wonder why I never thought of doing that before?

These are really good cookies.  My little one gobbles them up.  My grandmother has her own "No Bake Cookie" recipe that I use...it's very similar to this one.  Just about everyone enjoys these...and they are a nice change of pace from your typical peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie.  A good sweet & healthy snack for kids and their a chinch to make.  Thanks for submitting an old favorite Betty.

My mom has been making this for decades, and taught me when I was a little kid.  It's GREAT, and a staple in our family!  

Although I have to disagree with Sue who posted a review a few slots down - you DO need to boil it for one full minute, or it will not harden!

I've made it several times where I didn't boil for a full minute, just brought it to a boil, and it never hardened.  Over the last 15 years or so, I've made it close to a hundred times - boil it for at LEAST a full minute for it to harden properly.  

Thanks for posting!

This is the right recipe. I never make any substitutions, except sometimes a cup of coconut instead of one of the cups of oatmeal. I make these a couple of times a week because we are addicted! Thank you!!!

PERFECT!  Just like I remembered.  Important to time from the rolling boil stage.  Too long and they will be dry, too little and they will be gooey.  Practice makes perfect!

These are great and so easy - but I did change things up a bit. I made it 4 cups of oatmeal and 3/4 cup of splenda/sugar baking mixture, that's sweet enough for me. I boiled the cocoa mixture for 2 full minutes and instead of dropping as cookies, I spread them into a 9x13 prepped with cooking spray to set - 30 minutes in the fridge. I'll make them again and add coconut.

I thought these were ok. They were worth trying. My kids didn't really like them either. I think they were a bit too sweet.

Easy as 123...these turned out FAB.  Only reason I rated a 4 is because I made adjustments. Took advise of other folks and did the following added my modifications.  MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS PREMEASURED AND IN SEPARATE CONTAINERS SET KITCHEN TIMER TO ONE MIN BUT DONT TURN ON JUST YET. Put milk and butter in pan turn on heat, add cocoa (4tbs) then add sugar. CONSTANTELY stir at all times mixure will come to a rolling boil even while stirring.  Once rolling boil starts TURN ON TIMER.  Keep stirring until timer goes off.  Take pot off heat add salt, then vanilla (9 teaspoons= shot glass full) keep stirring add peanut butter (I did creamy) keep stirring then add oats.  Stirring mixure until completely mixed.  FINETO!  Me and my son could not get them on the wax paper as we were too busy eating from the spoon!  FAB FAB FAB!

I halved this recipe and they didn't set up at all, so don't do that!! But I tried it again later on using the normal portions and they were great!

Had trouble getting these to set. (Still trying to perfect them!)   Decided to keep them stored in the fridge, and they taste wonderful!  Make sure to measure the oats exactly according to the recipe.  Recipe is a bit too sweet, you might want to cut back a tad on the sugar!

These cookies are good and super easy to make.
One mistake I made with my first batch: I almost forgot the vanilla put it in after the oatmeal, and it was waaaay too strong and they didn't taste as good. Another thing (and mostly why I gave them 4 stars rather than 5) is that they didn't hold up really well after a few days -- they dried out and got crumbly. (I made a ton ahead as Christmas presents but tossed the last bunch because they didn't keep well.)

I made 1/2 a batch for the trial run. I was a little short on Oats and only had creamy peanut butter.  They still set and came out great. I've been looking for this recipe for 20 years, found some but they never set properly. I'm so happy to have my recipe back. Thank you!

Ok.. Instead of magarine I used organic coconut oil. I also used "natural" peanut butter and 1/2 cup coconut... AMAZING!! This is our third batch in 2 days... Love 'em'!!!

ugh...maybe I just don't get the whole 'no bake' thing but I REALLY didn't like these. I followed the recipe exactly like it says, and even set the timer for a minute as soon as it started to boil. As soon as I had all the ingredients together I thought there might be something wrong since it was very stiff, not at all gooey or runny as others have stated. But I continued the recipe and placed the balls on the parchment paper thinking, "Maybe they'll spread out into cookies as the hour goes on". Never happened. They came out hard, dry, and chalky. I gave it 2 stars just because I don't think I've ever had a no bake cookie and maybe I was just expecting too much out of them.

They're a bit on the sweet side, but I like them that way. I boiled the mixture a little longer than 1 minute, but that helped them to set up quicker. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these EXACTLY as written and they got hard in the saucepan before I could even get them on the wax paper.  I tried to pile it all into a 9x13 and smash them down while they were still hot in hopes of cutting them into bars, but that didn't work either.  Don't know how everyone else had such good luck.

This recipe has been a favorite in my family my whole entire life. The secrets include having all ingredients pre-measured, using 4 tbsp of butter and remember that you have to have your cocoa mixture at a rolling boil (that means that even though you are stirring the mix, it is STILL boiling rapidly. THEN, you start your timing -- we go 5 minutes) And we use creamy peanut butter, not chunky (not everyone likes nuts) dump the oats a cup at a time, sometimes you need 3 cups, sometimes 3.5 cups oats.
Sometimes if the weather isn't the best, the cookies won't set up. They're a mess, but we eat them anyway, and have dubbed them "Mess Cookies" - the best!

I've been making these same cookies for a long time and they are always so good! I make mine a little healthier though by reducing the sugar to only 1/2 cup and the butter to 1/4 cup. The peanutbutter already adds enough sugar (unless its natural unsweetened) and fat to the recipe. Also, you can make this recipe vegan by using soymilk and margarine.

The first time I made these I followed some of the reviewers advice and let them sit for a little bit in the pot before dropping and also added the vanilla in with the sugar mixture at the start, and I also let them boil for 90 seconds as was recommended.  They were a little too dry, but my husband loved them and they did taste great!  He was begging me to make them again so the second time I followed the recipe as written except used creamy peanut butter and they were PERFECT! Don't mess with the recipe, it is just righ!

These are my husband's favorite!  We loved this recipe.  When I first made them, I did not have an hour to let them cool, so put a bunch in the freezer for about 15-20 mins and they came out great.

Perfect!  The only change I made was to add closer to 4 cups of oatmeal as they are too sticky otherwise.

The taste was great, but they didn't set properly. I added a handful of chocolate chips like my mom used to do in her recipe and added some wheat germ and coconut. I will have to keep trying!

I followed the ingredients list exactly, and made sure that I boiled the cocoa mixture ( a full rolling boil) for about 1 and 1/2 minutes. I guess I'll have to try again, because the final result was so dry and crumbly that there was no way to spoon these out - I had to squeeze teaspoon- full amounts of the mixture together with my hands, and pray that the mixture will hold together in some sort of shape. They're cooling now, so I'm hoping the end result will not be too crumbly to eat. Very disappointed, because the ones I remember from my childhood could be spooned out onto waxed paper. I rated 4 stars because it must have been something I did wrong !
UPDATE:  I made this exact recipe again, except I used 2 and 1/2 cups of oats....turned out perfect. I'm certain that I mixed the first batch according to the recipe, so my advice to others would be to start with less oats and add more if needed. I have noticed other reviews here where other people actually used MORE oats; I have no explanation for that. It's true that you don't want them runny when you spoon them out, but my first batch was too dry !

This was exactly what I was looking for! Obviously so was the rest of my family, we didn't made it through the one hour wait though. Used smooth pb, no xtra oats, perfect, just the way they are. My new fav, for sure. Just a little note, I messed up on the first batch and they looked a bit dry, so I just added some more milk until they started sticking together properly. I know some of the reviews said they were dry, so if this happens to you just add milk until it looks right.

Eco-friendly and time saver idea - I doled out my no bake cookies on silicon baking mats which were on top o wire cooling racks. This saved time in cooling, and nothing to throw away! I also used real butter, stirred constantly throughout cooking, used creamy peanut butter, and 3 1/2 C oats. Turned out much better....

I love this recipe because it's fast, easy and there is no fuss in making them. Make sure to bring the sugar/butter/milk/cocoa to a FULL,ROLLING BOIL for exactly 1 minute, or the cookies will be mushy and the shape will not hold. Either smooth or chunky PB works well - I prefer smooth. MY ADDITIONS: added 1/2 c. more oatmeal (to avoid mushiness), milled or whole flax seed is great for more nutritional value, and for added flavor I throw in 1/2 c. coconut. Yum!

I lost my recipe and decided to look on here for another...this one is great! It was too thin after all was done, so I added another 1/4 c. peanut butter, and 1 c. oats...wow! Delish! Everyone at work loved them.

These cookies have a rich choclatey flavor and are just like the cookies I used to make back in high school. I only had creamy peanut butter around so I used that and they were still delicious. I'll use crunchy next time for the added texture. My husband went crazy and couldn't stop eating them (and he's not much of a cookie person).

Made as directed except that I poured them into a 9x13 as was suggested by another reviewer. Had to allow them to set up overnight. They could have used the extra 1/2 cup of oats but they were still delicious! I will definitely try these again.

I used butter instead of margarine, and they were still a hit with my son.

I have made this many times and I will many more.  I let it cool off in the pan a little before dropping it onto wax paper, which seems to make them thicker, when I drop them out right off the burner they seem to stay sort of wet and thin.  I have started adding other fun stuff to them, like butterscotch chips of toffee chips which is delicious and sweeter.

Super yummy and easy.  I used creamy verses chunky peanut butter and real butter verses margarine but followed the measurements.  Brought to a rolling boil for 90 seconds then added the rest of ingredients right to the same pot after removing from heat.  Cookies set well.  Note if you reshape them with your fingers they sort of leave a finger print look instead of shiny so don't touch them once you drop them.

Good recipe! Read the directions very carefully! Make sure the chocolate comes to a rolling boil, and to stir it for the right amount of time! I failed to do this properly and the chocolate took forever to harden once I set them on wax paper. They still tasted great, however!

Even though I set a timer when it began to boil mine came out pretty crumbly and a little dry. I'll try again another time, boiling for a bit less and maybe using less oats, as mine seemed not to have much "filling" and was densely filled with oats.  I did cut the recipe in half so maybe that contributed to the questionable results. I might also try using my candy thermometer and see if that yields a positive outcome.

Made exactly as the recipe reads - came out perfect! I often have problems with too hard or too soft, but boiling for exactly a minute after it starts roiling is just right.

Perfect! Definitely one of those recipes that you should have completely prepped before you begin - have the first set in the cold pan, then another bowl with the oats, salt & PB, plus the vanilla on the side ready to go. I used butter rather than margarine because I think it sets up more reliably, a tad more than 3c oatmeal, and some Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa powder (a generous 1/4 c). Oh mama, is it GOOD! I will use chunky PB next time just because that's what we typically have on hand, but creamy was definitely delicious. All in all, exactly what I was looking for. Om nom nom. :D

Really good recipe for the flavor, my husband requests this one a lot!  I too used smooth instead of chunky peanut butter.  I do find that they can be a bit dry, so I use 2 1/2c of oats and then add a bit more if it needs it.  It's a rare day that I use the entire 3 cups!

This is the recipe my mom made when I was a kid. I had lost it and so glad to have found it again. I made them exactly as the recipe states and they turned out perfectly. The absolute key to the success of the cookies is to begin timing only after the mixture has come to a rolling boil.

Reminds me of when I was a kid and my younger brother use to make these all the time.  Great recipe but I usually add more about 1 more cup of oats than what the recipe calls for.

I've tried several different No-Bake recipes over the years and this one is perfection! The cookies set up, but retain their fudginess, they hold together, but are melt-in-your-mouth, and they are splendidly easy to make, but taste like they should have been complicated. Superb!

I use to make these with my dad all the time about 15 years ago when I was a kid.  They are his favorite.  Everytime Father's Day rolls around I always make him a batch or two just to let him know how special he is and how I haven't forgotten what his favorite cookie is.

These were my 2nd try at a no bake cookie recipe from this site. THE BEST so far! I followed the recommendation of the reviewer "Shay", not changing any of the ingredients, just changing the order in which the ingredients are put in the pan. These are delishioso!! My daughter is the only kid I know that doesn't eat chocolate, and she ate 2 cookies right away! Of course, she helped make them,too.

This is the exact same recipe I was given in my 6th grade home economics class and I've been making them ever since...without giving away my age I'll just say that's been a long time.  I would say the one most important thing about this recipe is to boil the ingredients for exactly one minute.  Any longer and your cookies could come out dry any less and they may not set right and be gooey.  I like to use a mixture of half creamy peanut butter and half crunchy.  Sometimes I use all of one or the other and sometimes I'll add a little less oats and throw in some coconut.  A great, easy recipe.

Beautiful, simple.  This is a perfect recipe as is.
UPDATE:  Make it easy on yourself.  This is what I did.  Instead of spooning these cookies out, pour them.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper, and pour the whole pan onto the baking sheet.  Let them cool 10-15 minutes, and then score them with a table knife into squares...whatever size you like.  Then, pop them in the fridge for a bit.  When they are completely cooled, break them into pieces and pull off the paper.  Store as you normally would.  Hope this helps make your holiday cooking a little simpler! ;)

Used butter instead of margarine and creamy peanut butter instead of chunky.  I used my smallest cookie scoop and scooped them onto silocone mats.  Set up quick and were the perfect size.  Yum!

Very good for not having to bake them. I put them in a muffin tin though, to get more of an even shape. Everyone loved them and I had to make another batch the next day!

Couldn't keep my fingers out of the bowl while I was scooping it onto waxed paper.  It's hard to wait for these to cool.  Although they didn't set up as well as I had hoped, they tasted delicious--just like I used to make as a kid.

I would not reccomend making these in a hot and humid environment.  Mine stayed soggy and unable to hold shape.  Maybe I will try them again somewhere cold and dry.

I used 2 squares (1/4th of the 8 oz. box) of Baker's semisweet chocolate, because I didn't have cocoa powder and it still turned out great.  I  first melted the butter in the pan, added the chocolate, and then slowly stirred in milk.  I also added the peanut butter to this mixture before adding the oats, and this probably made it easier to mix in the oats.

Good recipe with no modifications needed.  I scaled the recipe for 24 and got 26 uniform cookies!  I like mine small enough for 1-2 bites.  Super easy - Just remember to time your rolling boil and you'll be fine.  I did mine for 90 seconds.

These are so easy and delicious!  I recommend letting the mixture cool a couple minutes before spooning it onto wax paper, so that they can have a little form as opposed to being glob-ish.

Made these for my friend's birthday (they are her favorite).  She (and our coworkers) loved them!  Just like the ones I remember from childhood.  Be sure to follow the cooking instructions precisely, and there should be no problems with set-up.

These were great!! Just like the kind I had as a kid. I do prefer them without the chunky peanut butter, though.

I love no bake cookies!  Mine didn't set up totally firm (but can passably be called cookies after a day of sitting there), but that's a perennial problem with me.  I reduced the sugar by 1/4 and doubled both the cocoa powder and peanut butter.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I only had old-fashioned oats, not quick cooking, and the cookies turned out fine, just a little chewier than usual.

This is the recipe I was looking for.  Tastes like the cookies that my elementary school cafeteria served with lunch - and believe it or not, that's a good thing!  
Be careful not to cook too long or they get crumbly.

I love no bake cookies and these are no exception.  They were super easy to make and mine "set" very well after about an hour.  I did however, decrease the sugar about about 1/4 cup and I used cream peanut butter instead of chunky..they still turned out great!  This recipe is a keeper.

These cookies are really good. I've made them a few times and the only thing I changed was I decreased the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. Excellent!

I am so happy to have found this recipe! I used to make no-bake cookies just like these many years ago, but I lost my recipe. I tried others, but they were never quite the same. Now I realize that the difference is the extra cocoa. Excellent!

I used to make these for my family when I was a 10 year old beginning cook. I had completely forgotten about them! I've played around with the proportions to get the right shape, but no matter the shape, they are always delicious...

My mother loves these so I make them for her.  No complaints whatsoever.  Once I made this and they didn't set correctly but I think it had to do with the humidity.  Otherwise, no problems.

These cookies are fabulous!  I didnt have quite enough oats so I substituted 1 cup of coconut and my husband loved them.  He said his mom called them "frogs" so that's what we call them but they sure disappear quickly!

These cookies are pretty good if you're in the mood for something sweet and don't feel like baking. My son asks for them often. My recipe is very similar. The only differences are: no salt and only 1/4c. of creamy peanut butter. The biggest difference (and the real trick to getting them to set up) is to bring your butter, sugar cocoa, milk mixture to a full boil and continue to boil for exactly 3 minutes. Works every time!

The taste was fantastic but I think allowing to boil longer & adding another 1/2 cup of oats will allow them to set better.  I'll definitely make again, my family really enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing.

Love theses! I'd forgotten all about no bake cookies, I bet it's been 15 years since I've had them. Just like I remembered. I added 2 extra tbls of cocoa. Perfect! I over boiled a bit so my cookies weren't dropping by he spoonful... I rolled them and they turned out fine. Yum! So rich!!!

Allow the cookies to boil for 2.5 to 3 minutes. They set up MUCH better. 1 minutes creates runny and gooey cookies that you cannot store with out a huge clumpy mess.

My personal opinion...love these WITHOUT the peanut butter.  I made them as written but it was just too much peanut butter for my personal taste.  Now I make them with NO peanut butter and they are perfect for my house!  Thanks..I had forgotten about these goodies I made when I was a teenager.

Yum. I'm having trouble waiting for these to cool, they're so good! I did as other reviewers suggested and used smooth peanut butter, 4 tbs. cocoa and 3 1/2 cups of oats. Also, I'm pleased to report back that I made these healthier by using raw cane sugar, soy milk, natural organic peanut butter and- this even shocked me- "I Can't Believe it's not Butter" in place of margarine. (It was all I had on hand). But it came out sooo good! Will definitely be making these again and again :)

Prepared just as the directions said and they were perfect. Chewy, not all dried out and chalky like others I have had.  They set in about 20 minutes, highly recommend pre measuring peanut butter, oats and vanilla so your not rushing at the last minute.

Couldn't find my old recipe so used this one - it was a bit dry - my old recipe used 2 cups oats and only 1/2 stick butter.  This was not quite as good but it was ok.

These turned out great!  I used creamy peanut butter, so I added an extra 1/2 cup oats.  I used whole oats, since I didn't have any quick, but it didn't make a difference.  I also used vanilla soy milk, since that's what I had.  I love the flavor and ease of this recipe.  I will definitely make them again.

Fun and easy! Since it is fall, I wanted some spice to it, so I added a dash of cinnamon- mmmm. Gonna come up with a way to add peppermint at Christmas time (not sure what to replace the peanut butter with...marshmallow creme?). Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good recipe!  I used the microwave rather than the stovetop.  Bringing the mixture to a boil, then checking every 30 seconds with the instant-read thermometer to get to soft-ball stage (235)!

Delish! I did make 2 personal adjustments to the recipe though. I knew I wanted more chocolate flavor so I used 1/2 cup coca instead of 1/4 and only 1/4 cup of smooth peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup. I always follow recipes to the T but I knew this would be more to my taste with the adjustments I made. Thanks for a great recipe, these tasted just like I remembered them from years ago.

Not sure where others are getting their reviews, but these cookies are extremely runny. I had to put them in the freezer and then they were still gooey. I've made them twice in case I messed something up. The taste is good, but they are just too runny and messy to bother! You have to eat them with a spoon.

My boyfriend said these were the best No Bake Cookies he has ever had, and I agree!  I reduced the amount of sugar and margarine and I didn't notice a bit.  The cookies were perfectly shaped and remained soft inside.   I can't wait to make this recipe agian!!!

YUM!  I have tried a few different recipes for no bakes and this recipe is definately tops!  Perfect consistency, flavor, and texture.  I doubled the recipe for my family and it turned out perfect.  I use creamy peanut butter and they taste great! Thanks for sharing!

I have been making no bake cookies (aka preacher cookies to us southerners) for years.  I've made them poorly and then I've made pretty good batches.  Follow this recipe, but modify it slightly - 1/2 cup more oatmeal, 3/4 cup smooth PB, and a little less than 1/2 cup cocoa.  Follow the advice of your fellow cooks here regarding the timing and you will have fugdy delicious cookies in no time.

I love this recipe! I have had dire results with no bake cookies in the past, but this recipe worked out great! I changed the peanut butter to creamy and increased the oats to 3 1/2 cups as suggested, I also increased the vanilla to 2 tsp and used butter instead of margarine. They set up almost immediately after I dropped them, it was great thank you!

Very easy and pretty tasty too! I followed everyone's suggestion to make sure I let the pot come to a definite, rolling boil and had all my ingredients already measured out to throw in. Not the most attractive cookies, but taste good especially warm and gooey.

I've used this recipe for years and the cookies are gone in a flash! I think it's the chunky peanut butter that makes this recipe! I usually buy the expensive peanut butter because the cheaper stuff just doesn't taste as good.  But this recipe is a hit with everyone! Thanks!

I made this at home a few months ago and it was fantastic!  A question I want to put out to the more cooking saavy:  I'm currently in China working as an English teacher. One of the young girls I am teaching wanted to learn to bake so I took the opportunity to combine a little baking recipe with her English lesson. Unfortunately, It looks like I over-promised. Many of the ovens here only go up to 60C! She was really disappointed when i said we couldn't make chocolate chip cookies and I really don't want to disappoint her again but I'm a little concerned that I won't be able to find quick cooking oats in beijing! They don't do alot of baking here.  So my question is 3 parts:  1) Are there any expats living in Beijing who know where I can buy these ingredients? 2) What can I replace the oats with if I can't find them?  or Are there any other No-Bake cookies that don't require them and still taste yummy? and 3) If there ARE any expats living in Beijing who use this site, how about a cup of coffee and recipe talk?!

Very very good recipe, and so easy to make! I used a square of baker's chocolate instead of cocoa since I didn't have any. I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy and used real butter. My bosses loved them, as did my boyfriend. :)

Easy, quick and delicious!!  I did up the oats to 3 1/2 cups, used butter & reduced my sugar to 1 1/2 cups (they are still plenty sweet).  I had a tin of fat free evaporated milk to use up, so used that instead of regular milk.  All in all, very yummy...my 3 boys and my nephew all enjoyed these for a snack this afternoon with a cold glass of milk!!

This recipe is AWESOME! I only had the regular rolled oats and it didn't make any difference...it still tasted great!  I also substituted 1 cup of the oats for coconut and it added some great flavor! Thanks for this recipe!

Absolutely perfect! I used to eat these with my lunch in elementary school, and this recipe is chocolatier than those, but just right. My family is a group of college students, and these disappear whenever I make them!

I've made these 2x now. First time - excellent! I didn't have quick oats and so used regular oats. I also added a little extra cocoa and used the special dark chocolate cocoa. I put some on wax paper as cookies and the rest I made as bars in a 9x7 pan. All tasted wonderful! My 2nd time- I might have cooked it too long. They were so very dry and broke apart too easily. But I'll try again. They are a little sweet so I'll try the advice of another poster and reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup.

I love this cookie.  Have been making them since I was a kid.  In fact we used to call it Mack's (my brother) cookie because he was always asking for them.  Some things other than coconut that you can add are raisins or extra chopped nuts.  At Christmas I make these and before they get set I will put half candied cherry on them to give them a little extra pizazz.  Oh...and I am in my 50's.  :)

Maybe 3.5 stars.  It is easy and you can't go wrong with cocoa and peanut butter, but there are other no bake cookies that I think are better on this site.

We make these all of the time.  THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE ON THE SITE.  I have doubled the PB, used crunchy and smooth, I have doubled the chocolate, I have used dark chocolate.  I have used 1/2 the white sugar.  They always turn out great regardless of the choices you make.  If you want a more candy like cookie then boil for one min only, you may want to freeze.  If you want a drier cookie, then boil a little longer.  YUMMY and EASY.

Very good cookies!  These are great with either smooth or chuncky peanut butter.  Wouldn't change a thing otherwise. However I do prefer butter instead of margarine in this recipe. Remember the key to No Bake cookies is to bring them to a FULL-ROLLING boil for 1 full minute.

Came out great, just like I remembered no bakes.  Used creamy peanut butter and omitted the salt.  Let mixture boil for about 1 min. 15 sec. stirring constantly, and they set up perfectly in about 30 minutes.  Will definitely make again.  (and again, and again...)

i used to make these w/ my friends all the time.  we double the recipe cuz we eat about half as we make them!  (the good days when flab wasn't an issue!)  just a thought though...you really don't have to use instant oats.  regular works fine too and they give it more chewyness like a cookie instead of like candy. if you get too anxious and take it off the heat too soon and they don't firm up...just stick them in the freezer!  great for a chocolate fix on a warm day!

These were awful!  I had high hopes after reading the reviews.  I followed the directions to a tee...which resulted in dry, overly sweet, awful cookies.  Won't waste my time on these again.  Sorry.

OK, here is a twist.  I am allergic to Dairy so I substituted ½ cup Lite Coconut Milk for the regular milk, and ½ cup of Virgin Coconut Oil (which is solid at room temperature like butter) for the ½ cup of butter.  I also added ½ cup of Coconut Shreds to continue with the theme.  They are great and no dairy.  Enjoy!

To say these cookies have "some nutritional value" is a stretch, as they are pretty much candy.  I used smooth peanut butter (personal preference), but otherwise followed recipe exactly as is.  Very easy, and very delicious.  Will definitely be making these again!

My normal recipe for these doesn't have peanut butter.  I like them with (pb) much, much better.  These were great.  Don't use regular oats!  I didn't have any quick oats and I had to find out the hard way!

For a no bake cookie that is so easy to make, that also causes my kids to rave about it - I just must give it 5 stars.  I agree that it has more of a fudge-like consistency, but who could complain about yummy fudge like cookies that don't require baking, and very little work!  I can't wait to try this recipe out with other family members.

I have been making no-bakes for years and for years before me my mother was and hers before that. They have always been a hit. We use the creamy PB. Also I don't know why this person puts any salt in it because you really don't need it.

Yum.  This was the first time I have ever made a no-bake cookie, and I was quite pleased with the end result.  I had no issues with these cookies setting up - I followed the directions exactly.  The only thing I added was sprinkles on top - thanks!

Awesome - I've been looking for this recipe for forever. I had a friend in high school whose mom always had these on hand. I feel lucky to have found this! I did make one change and used Jif Light creamy peanut butter instead of chunky. They turned out great!

These are really delicious, chewy, and fudgy cookies.  They're easy to make, and you can vary the recipe to suit your taste.  I've made this recipe several times.  I use creamy peanut butter because that's what I always have on hand.  I've also substituted a cup of coconut for the third cup of oatmeal and it turned out fine.  This is a great recipe, but it's not much different than the other no bake cookies I've made.  Still, I gave it 5 stars because these are super easy cookies that will satisfy your chocolate craving!

I made these cookies last night exactly like the recipe calls for.  However, I boiled for one minute and I don't think it was long enough.  I live in Hawaii and the humidity is pretty bad, the cookies never set.  I had to put them in the fridgerator then the freezer to get them to harden.  I probably won't make these again (at least not in Hawaii) because they just didn't turn out.  They tasted really good though.  I was going to give 4 stars but since environmental factors came into play, I'll still give 5.

Absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly, but used butter instead of margerine.  Boiled for about 1 1/2 minute (stirring constantly) and they set up perfectly, in about 1/2 an hour. SO easy and SO rich!!

I've been craving these all week and they were great! Definitely keep your eye on the clock during the boil, and DO NOT go over a minute or your mixture will be dried out.

My 5 year old loves to make cookies and she made this one all by herself. (of course I watched her using the stove).  She and her little sister said they would eat these every day.  They are very good and you don't even really have to wait a full hour for them to cool.  We were digging in within 30 minutes. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! I was desperate for cookies & wanted some NOW - so this was the perfect quick recipe. I only had creamy Jif & old-fashioned oats (a little chewy, but good) & cut sugar down to 1 and 3/4 (next time I will try 1 and 1/2) and boiled for 2 minutes like others have suggested. Stuck them in the fridge - the kids helped too!

So addictive! Use REAL butter. Also, the one minute has to be at a rolling boil or else they won't set up right.

I have use different variations of this recipe.  The results are MUCH better using real butter and no "store or generic" brands.  Be "choosey" about peanut butter.

Wonderful.  These are everything that a no bake cookie should be.  I had a little trouble with them setting in an hour.  But by the next day they were all just right.  I also used 1/2 cup less of oats, so that may be why they did not set up as quickly.

Great basic no bake cookie recipe.  These took me about 10 minutes to make and I didn't have to turn on the oven.  Very easy and tasty!  I think we ate 1/2 the recipe ourselves (my husband and I) last night and I brought the rest to work and they were snatched up instantly.  I was also asked for the recipe several times.  Thanks!

This is a family favorite!  My daughter wanted these sent to college and I couldn't find my old, stained recipe card.  I was so excited to find it here - we have loved these for years - they couldn't be easier.  Another batch is going in the mail today!

I did exactly as the recipe said and they came out soft and didn't stick together very well. They still tasted good, that is why I give it 3 stars.

These are perfect if you use real butter and for the reviewer that suggested 4tbsp. instead of 1/4 c. of cocoa, either is fine since that’s the same amount. ??

I used to think the only way to improve these was to make a double batch, but today, when I made them for the umpteenth time, I realized I didn't have enough butter.  So I substituted coconut oil for the butter, and oh man, I will never go back.  I tossed in some coconut as well, and because I can, I added some cinnamon.  I live in Guatemala where not everyone has an oven, and so many of my friends want to learn to make these.  I'm becoming very popular, thanks to this recipe.

Excellent! I replaced the margarine with coconut oil, used soy milk, and replaced a 1/2 cup of oatmeal with unsweetened shredded coconut. I used a candy thermometer and boiled the mixture to fudge temperature. No problems setting up and very delicious!

Love this recipe! Turned out great! I made a few changes. I didn't pick just one peanut butter style. I used 2/3 crunchy peanut butter and 1/3 creamy peanut butter. I also added the vanilla extract and peanut butter after it came to a boil but before I took it off the stove eye.

Perfect. Not too heavy on the sugar, and I love the peanut chunks in the cookie. I did use butter instead of margarine because that's what I had in the ice box. I always let the "batter" cool for a good 15 minutes in the pan before spooning, it makes for much more formed cookies.

Easy peasy! I used Old Fashioned Oats instead of quick oats. Like someone suggested, I put them in the Ninja for a second to make them smaller before I added them.

Came out delicious! I boil for 3 minutes after it actually starts to boil. I also let the cookies set overnight, they are usually sticky for some time after cooling but the next day they are perfect! Sometimes I make them with cocoa and coconut instead of peanut butter. I'm going to try less sugar one of these days too.

Same recipe my mother made when I was a kid, except I boiled for the  1 minute 30 seconds she did. I also use 1/3 cup cocoa. For the others that had issues with thiers setting up, you must bring these to a rapid boil that you cannot stir down before setting your timer, otherwise these will not set.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out well. Sometimes I leave out the peanut butter or use creamy instead and it always turns out well. Just be careful not to cook it for to long or it will be a little dry and crumbly.

I took other's advice and added a little extra oats, replaced margarine with butter. Get them on a sheet quick before they get crumbly! These cookies turned out so beautiful and delicious that I had to share them with my neighbors...my secret recipe of course. Lol. Thanks!

Other than using creamy peanut butter instead of chunky, this is the exact recipe I've been using for 30 years.  I bring the mixture to a full boil before I start timing the one minute, then stir in the vanilla, salt and peanut butter before stirring in the oats.   The cookies never fail to set up within a few minutes, and the texture is perfect.

Well... These "No Bake Cookies V" were definitely a notable recipe, granted they were not the best No Bakes' I've ever tried but they were good. The Cocoa powder was a smart addition and gave it a chocolate bite. All together it was great and quite easy so make and consume.

My mom and dad went out to the doctor so my mom facebook messaged me and said she wanted some cake. So I wanted to make her some so I start looking... After that I find a recipe and my sister said you aren't aloud to use the oven! So then I look up No Bake Cookies and I find this and make it my sister helped a tad. And we gave them to my parents after they got back (my dad loves no bake cookies). My dad was so happy then he found out me and my sister made them he was a tad nervous then at first he thought it was store bought. He tried them and his face lit up! He told us these were the best no bake cookies ever! He said they were even better than his grandmas! This is a great and quick recipe though I do recommend use 1/2 of a cup more oats! Over all a great recipe! Wonderful for anything!

Classic no bake recipe.  I prefer smooth peanut butter so I used that and regular oatmeal because it's what we had.  They set up in about 20 minutes.  The oatmeal was a little hard to chew the first day but softened up quite a bit the second day. If you have a large family you might want to double the recipe, the ones I made last night are almost gone!

I, too, have been making these cookies since I was a very little girl, and have loved them all my life. I have made variations, adding a half cup of coconut or nuts (cashews and pecans are good and omit the PB) I have also omitted the PB for allergies sake. This is one of those recipes in which I rarely measure, almost always add extra oats; and only bring the mixture to a rolling boil which funny enough, works out to a minute. Guess what I am trying to say is it is hard to mess up this recipe. For those who have had troubles, the only thing I can think of is perhaps altitude?? Anyway, if they don't work for whatever reason, the cooled batter still tastes good.

This is so simple and quick! They are delicious! My kids and I followed this recipe exactly (by the way, it's not fair to give a critical review of a recipe unless you've tried it the author's way)! They set perfectly, in less than an hour actually, and they are a perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter. This recipe provides an excellent beginning for any other additions you want to make to it. I might try some coconut in it next time. :) But I will have to keep from making these too often as I cannot stay out of them! Thanks for a great recipe!

I make these all the time as they've become one of my favorite cookies. I use about 1+1/3 cup oatmeal, 1+1/3 cup Fiber One original cereal, and 2/3 cup sliced almonds.  Delicious and satisfying. May try reducing sugar slightly, but they're so good this way.  I find storing these cookies in an air-tight container in the freezer gives them a nice firm consistency and they keep quite a while this way.  Great recipe.

I love making these cookies, so easy! I do like to substitute brown sugar for white. As well, I like to change the flavor by adding a half a cup of nuts or raisins or both. These cookies are so versatile I have even added cinnamon and sprinkled a variety of treats on top (coconut)before they cool. Let your imagination go wild! Love it!

Added extra 1/2 cup oatmeal, doubled cocoa, as per other reviews.  Boiled 90 seconds.  Just a note that the extra cocoa makes them ***very*** chocolaty- I love them this way, but not everyone might feel the same.  It's a very humid day here, and mine were set up to eat within minutes of hitting the waxed paper ;)

These were good, but did not completely wow me enough for me to give them five stars. Here are some suggestions:
   -Use about 5/8 cup peanut butter, in other words slightly more than a half cup. Crunchy does work best to my preference because with smooth peanut butter it ends up tasting more like dough.
   -Boil 1.5 minutes, stirring constantly, add next set of ingredients quickly, thoroughly stir, then refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. Let cookies sit about 5 minutes at room temp before serving. 
Note*** is okay to use greasing spray such as PAM brand in place of wax paper, but use it sparingly. Enjoy!

The only problem with these cookies is they never last long.  I've been making them by this recipe for years.  Their fantastic.  You do need to time the cooking exact or they won't turn out.

Ridiculously easy and ridiculously good!  Whipped these up for fun one night when I had a sweet tooth craving.  Barely took any time to make...or to eat!  Next time, might spread all the mix out on a cookie sheet, let cool, and cut or break into pieces.  Yum!

I had a hard time keeping my 3 year old away from them. They were very delicious and set quite nicely. I modified it a little bit by adding about a tsp of cinnamon.

I have been buying these from the store lately, and can't get enough of them, so I thought I'd try to find a recipe to make them. Since my daughter has a peanut allergy, I decided to make them with Sunbutter instead of peanut butter. They turned out very yummy! (I'm glad I made a double batch!) I followed the recipe exactly, and made sure to start timing one minute at the point of a full rolling boil (one you can't stir down). Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been using this recipe for a very long time and have always had trouble getting the cookies to set. The way that I was able to solve this problem was too add more peanut butter and also let it biol a little longer. If you are in a hurry, pour the cookies into a cake pan to cool, this will cause them to turn out like brownies!

Simple directions.  Followed them exactly as written and cookies turned out great.  Used Hershey's Cocoa "Specialty Dark" powder - really yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.  Been making these since I was a kid, but thought this way was easier than how I learned to make them.

Best no bakes we've ever made.  We like them chocolatey, so we cut back just a little on the pnt butter and added a bit more cocoa.  I also used my candy thermometer since I've had trouble in the past with cookies setting up.   We all LOVED them and have made them three times in a few weeks!

THE BEST!! I have been looking for a great "No Bake Cookies" recipe forever. These are perfect. I will keep this recipe and make no other recipe. I use an ice cream scoop to form my mounds and they set perfect. I used just a tad bit more peanut butter and used 2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1 (stated in previous review). I think I will be making these all the time now. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe - I used 1/2 c. cocoa and no salt. I over boiled the cookies (4 minutes) and then added just a little milk to soften them back up. Still turned out great.

This was a hit, they don't look too pretty but taste delish, made then a few tiimes now.  have I added a some coconut I had lying around, those were really good too. The only minor problem I had the first time I made em was not cooking long enough, luckily I read the other reviews so  I just cooked a bit longer.

I tried another recipe on here for these and could not get them to set up to save my life! I tried prolly 5 times! Finally i tried this one and by golly if they set up perfectly!! I have made them several times already and they set up perfect everytime! very easy! I did however change one thing or two things I used creamy peanut butter and also used 1/2 cup evaporated milk and they are awesome! I am not sure its possible to mess them up this way? At least for me, so far so good! Love it! just like i remember growing up!

I made these using the suggested modifications to the cocoa and sugar and they never set up! They were soft and "runny". They tasted good but I won't use this recipe again.

I have never made these no bake cookies before. They have always been a favorite of mine at parties. I followed recipe exactly. Turned out perfect! Would not change a thing. I will be the one volunteering these as part of the menu from now on. Wish I had made these prior to our Christmas gathering. I made them after all the family had left. Will share with friends tomorrow though.

I like this recipe better than the recipe that I have been using for years. I am going to start using this one from now on. No Bake Cookies are a favorite in my home and never last very long. Plus, they are really easy to make.

Ok, I will bare my soul here. Haha.  I had trouble deciding when to start the timer. I wasn't sure when to declare that it was at the perfect level of "boiling". Anyway, I think I boiled them too long because they looked way too dry.   When I've made them before and they turn out good, the chocolate has a little shine too it and these didn't. I also think I may have added too many oats, because they were too thick to flatten out when they hit the wax paper.    I couldn't serve those, but I had an idea. I started over making a new batch.  Instead of adding 3 cups of oats, I added 1 1/2 cups of oats and 1 1/2 cups of finely crumbled "too dry" cookies from my first attempt.  They turned out great and I didn't have to throw out the first batch!  : )

These were absolutely outstanding, never had a better cookie in my entire life. The salt was a little much though, took away from the peanut flavor. Overall decent.

These are just ok. I wish I had used my own recipe. They just don't seem to have much flavor. I did pick up a tip from these reviews: Let the liquidy part boil for the full minute! That is what my recipe was lacking. I don't think I have that part. Because of that, I am grateful for at least trying this recipe. I won't be making these again, but thank you anyway!

OH MY GOODNESS!! I have been craving these cookies for a long time, but never got around to making them. After sorting through the many recipes on the site, I chose this one. And boy, am I sure glad I did! I was out of butter, so I substituted butter flavored spry (Crisco)...and that was the only change I made. Followed the rest exactly...and made sure it was a ROLLING BOIL before I started the 1 minute timer. These came out perfect! I will be making these all the time. Thanks so much for his recipe!! A huge hit in my home!!

I'm giving this 5 stars even though mine wouldn't set up.  I think that was due to my ingredients I used.  I used 50% reduced fat margarine, 1 cup Splenda, 1 cup sugar, skim milk.  I used reduced fat smooth peanut butter.  I did bring it to a vigorous boil while constantly stirring and then timed it for 90 seconds.  I had to add about 1 extra cup of oatmeal to even get it to sorta come together.  The taste is fantastic, even if we have to eat in on a plate with a fork.  Yummy chocolatey goodness!  I'm sure with the proper full fat ingredients this would set up fine.

I used to make this recipe and rediscovered it recently.  I especially like the suggestions from "JenniferH" and "Shay"; choose 'view all reviews' and sort by 'most helpful' and theirs will be at the top.  Definitely switch to smooth peanut butter.  Some have said that it doesn't matter if you use regular or quick oats.  I used old-fashioned oats once and it turned out a lot tougher/chewier.  The quick oats are in smaller pieces and give it a much better texture.  I also prefer to use real butter.

Used butter instead of margarine, and imitation vanilla only becuase we ran out of real.  I used 3/4 cup of natural creamy peanut butter, and just a TINY bit more sugar than called for (maybe an extra few tablespoons?) Everything else was the same. Used Irish quick cooking oats this time (McCann) and these turned out delicious this time. I can't even keep my families hands off them while they are setting. I omitted the salt because I find the natural peanut butter to be a bit more salty than the regular creamy or crunchy.

These cookies are so quick and delicious! I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and they turned out plenty sweet, and creamy peanut butter. I put them in the fridge and they set within ten minutes.

This turned out almost EXACTLY like the ones my aunt used to make growing up.  The only mods I made are to use 2/3rds cup of smooth PB instead of a half chunky.  I've done a timed minute at a rolling boil both times I've made these things, and they've set up perfectly each time. This recipe is a total win!

I agree with boling the mixture a little longer after you've added the oats, especially if using old fashion oats vs. quick oats. Also I love adding coconut!!! About 1 cup is all you need and it adds another texture and an amazing taste. This is also help with those using smooth pb, instead of adding more oats. Super yummy though =)

The easiest, quickest cookie ever!  And they are SO good.  I could eat all the batter before I even get the cookies made!  I have made them twice now, and the only things I altered were using a little more oats and a little less sugar.  They are VERY sweet.

Yum!  Just like I always made as a kid - a comfort food for me!  The only thing I would add is that usually I just add the oats until it's the right consistency...oh and don't forget to lick the spoon!

Excellent cookie recipe!  I followed recipe and directions exactly with the exception of substituting water for the milk, and I used 100% dark chocolate cocoa.  These cookies set up great and tasted fine. A staple in my recipe box!

I made this recipe dairy free and it turned out great! I substituted Earth Balance "buttery" spread for the margarine and used coconut milk instead of cow's milk. The cookies hardened as they should and I cannot taste the difference! I also used gluten free oatmeal.

These cookies are amazing leave the recipe how it is and it's perfect.  The only problem people seem to have is the boiling time (not enough runny cookies ...too much dry and crumbly)  I'd say for the perfect chewy cookie just boil until your mixture can hold soft peaks in the pot and you should be fine.  In response to Sunflowerr having problems with an oven that doesn't have a high enough cooking temp... most cookies can also be made in the microwave just drop by teaspoon onto waxed paper on microwave oven glass tray. Be sure to make cookies small. Cook about a dozen at a time on full power for 45 to 60 seconds or until firm, but slightly moist. Allow to cool slightly before removing from waxed paper and repeat with remaining dough.

These are great!  Have never made these before, so I followed "Shay's" ideas and they came out perfect!  I did add a bit more oatmeal, used butter, and had everything premeasured.   Just like I remembered when I was little....Thanks!!

My husband made these tonight and they turned out a little bit flat and flimsy. They didn't set up. The first recipe that I tried from this site said to take the cookies off of the heat as soon as they come to a boil. For some reason that worked better for me as far as texture goes.  But as always - great flavor. I love these old fashioned cookies.

I've made this numerous times, usually with butter instead of marg. This last time I used ICBINB and soy milk, as I had run out of reg. milk and butter. Still turned out great. Reminds me of the ones my mom made growing up!

My first no bake cookie recipe and it turned out great. Will definitely make again. I did use real butter and about 1/2 a cup more oatmeal than the recipe called for.

I give this recipe 5 stars! This is the best no bake recipe I have made, the ratio of ingredients must be just right in order for them to set up. I added about a cup of marshmallows with the oats just for fun, and it was fantastic. Will definitely use this recipe every time I make no-bake cookies. Thanks!

These were perfect, exactly as written.  I boiled, stirring constantly, for 90 seconds from the start of boil.  They set very quickly and easily and were delicious.  I think a double batch will be necessary next time.

These turned out great and were gone in a day! Like another reviewer suggested, I used butter instead of margarine and added more oats since I used creamy peanut butter. Yum! I'll definitely make these again.

Used to make these often for my kids. They are so easy and quick. They taste even better if you put them in an airtight container and let them age a couple of weeks. If you can keep them this long!

I made these cookies last night and followed exactly according to recipe. They turned out wonderfully-well; except way too sweet for our taste and without the usual baked-cookies crunchiness which is a little disappointing!   Otherwise, it tastes good generally and it is super-easy to make them, even for a first-timer like me.   The next time around, I will reduce sugar to ½ of the recommended quantity, throw in some raisin along with chopped cashew nuts for more distinctive flavor and increase boiling time to 2 muinutes!

I have made these twice now. The second time I added 1/2 cup more oats and they was terrific. My niece stated they are her favorite cookie ever...in her long nine years that's a compliment. Thanks for making me the best aunt ever..  :)

I have made these at least 6 times in the past two weeks for track meets, all my kid's teammates expect them now. Tried other recipes, but this one is the best. I used a mixture of old fashoned oats and quick oats.Otherwise followed recipe exactly. Key to cookies turing out is the boiling time, I set timer for 1 min. once the full,rolling boil starts. Have wax paper ready before you start too.

Fantastic and highly addictive. I added some extra oats because I thought the batter looked a little thin, but I regret that decision now. Next time I'll use the recommended amount.

This recipe came out perfect!! Too perfect in fact, I can't stop eating them. I used creamy peanut butter because that is what I had on hand. My advice to those who did not have good luck with them setting up is to not start the time until the cocoa mixture is at a FULL boil. I did boil it for 1 1/2 minutes just to make sure and they are exactly like they should be!! GREAT RECIPE!!!

The only change I made was using creamy Peanut Butter instead of Crunchy.  I made this with two of my boys.  One stirred while the other two of us measured and put the ingredients in.  It was fun and they turned out great!  They set up so fast I barely had time to get them on the silicon baking sheets.  My youngest son, who is 4, protested when I said I was going to make them.  He didn't like the idea of the oatmeal.  After they were done, he LOVED them.  He didn't even realize the oatmeal was in there.  Great recipe.  I will definitely make these again.

I made these but changed them to be "non-dairy/vegan".  Even though they turned out a little dry the next day, I'm still rating as 5 stars.  The taste was great and it could have been caused by my changes.  I used raw sugar, soy milk, Earth Balance Soy Garden Spread (instead of margarine) and natural peanut butter.  They were delicious, even if it was a bit crumbly.

First time I made these, they didn't set and were gooey and sticky. They tasted good so I thought I would try it again. I read the reviews and I tried again. This time they came out crumbled and brittle. So I give up, I'm sure if you can get them right they would be wonderful, but 4 cups of sugar later, I'll stick to the ones I put in the oven.

This is my first attempt at no bake cookies..  I followed the advice of the other reviews.  I pre-measured all my ingredients.  When the sugar/cocoa/milk/margerine hit the boiling point, I started my one minute timer.  I used creamy peanut butter because that is what I had on hand.  

These were way too sweet & rich!  No one would eat them in my home.

I am so glad I found this recipe.  I made these all the time when my boys were growing up.  I also remember having them in school.  A very long time ago.  I made a batch the other day and they are still just as good and bring back wonderful memories.   Thanks so much for the reciped.

No Bake Cookies have been a family favorite in my house for years. I believe every woman on my mom's side can and loves to make them. We only use about 2 cups of oats, however, and 3 tbsp of cocoa.  We get kind of impatient waiting for them to harden, so we generally set the saucepan in cold water, while we stir in the peanut butter, vanilla, and oats until the mixture starts to feel stiff.

I have made these cookies for years and have discovered that you only have to bring it to a boil, you DO NOT have to boil for a full minute.  All that really has to happen is that the sugar needs to be completely melted.  I also just put the oats and peanut butter in a bowl together and stir them in at the same time, there is no need to melt the peanut butter in the boiled mixture first.  You can also add 1/2 cup coconut flakes, along with the oats.

I guess I'm not letting these cookies boil long enough because I can't get them to set up. I will try again tomorrow and let them boil for 1 1/2-2 minutes. Aparently just one minute isn't long enough. 
Also... I don't know why everyone is saying to go with creamy PB. I love using crunchy. It adds great texture and flavor.

These are so easy and you can have them done - start to finish in 10 minutes.  I use butter instead of margarine and I use creamy peanut butter.  Also, let it boil at a good roll for the full minute, that way they set up nice in about 20 minutes.  I love to make these for a quick and super easy chocolate fix.

Pretty doggone good. Tried it with the chunky peanut butter, but next time will stick with creamy and add a little more than called for to satisfy my love for PB. Want to try as bars instead of drop cookies too, but don't know if this resipe will hold up to that style as well as they do from a spoon.

A very quick and EASY chocolate fix! Didn't change a thing, just be sure to bring to a boil and then start the 1 minute timer, it really does make a difference!

I gave these a 4 because they were a little rich for my taste, but my husband loved them and gave them a 5!  Sooo easy to make.  I used 2 1/2 cups oats and about 3/4 cups coconut in the mix, and since these were being passed out as holiday gifts, I colored some coconut red and some green and pressed on top of the cookies when still warm and wet.  Very festive looking for minimal effort!

I love these cookies and have followed my own family recipe for a long time. I have learned a few of my own tricks along the way. Such as using one minute quick cooking oats. Using the creamy peanut butter not the crunchy. Also to spoon them out on a plate and let them set in the refrigerator. They taste all so good when their cold.

These are classic! We used to call them Fudge No-bake cookies in our house. I originally got the same recipe when I was in home ec class in jr. high in 60's. My brother used to love these as a kid. Now my grandkids love them!

Great recipe! I used the advice of SHAYMONLEA (the first review) and it was perfect! I love to cook, but i have never been able to make no-bake cookies just right. i finally found the right procedure! I also used 1.5 cups oats with 2.5 cups coconut because I ran out of oats. and I put sliced roasted almonds on top. very good!

First of all, these are AWESOME!! I'm not good in the kitchen, and I even managed to make these with no problems at all (a miracle in itself -- didn't even burn the sugar).

Personally, I did use most of the advice in the reviews. I used 4 Tbsp of Hershey's Special Dark cocoa. I did use chunky peanut butter as well (versus smooth as many people suggested). It just added a bit more texture to the whole thing, though they didn't necessarily need it. I also used the recommended 3 1/2 cups of oats (rather than 3).

Definitely read through some of the other reviews for tips! I'd like to try these again, rolling them in coconut maybe!

First time I made no bake cookies. The taste is really good, but to me the oats are way to dry and chewy and take away from cookie itself. Next time I will experiment with the oats to make it better. Maybe use rice krispies instead??

Delicious!  They came out with such a smooth and creamy consistancy, my roommate (who has never had a no-bake before) loved them.  However, I cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups because all i had was sweetened cocoa.  They still set beautifully in the fridge in 35 minutes.  Will use again!

We like to call these "no bake cookies" Star Crunches. I used creamy peanut butter & they turned out great. Next time I'll try it with the crunchy to add a little more crunch. Great recipe they turned out great & the best part, it was so easy & fast!

I didn't think there was much difference between this recipe and others I have tried; however, I still gave it a 5 because I did not add chunky preanut butter, I used creamy. Maybe that will make them taste different. But they were quick and easy to make.

These came out wonderfully for us! The only thing I have to say is pay attention to how much you cook them on the stove. Too much and they will end up too dry. Too little and they won't set up properly. Once you get the cooking time  down then you can't go wrong!

Ive been using a very similar recipe to this since I was in the seventh grade, nearly 13 years ago!  Very easy and quick, you just need to prepare yourself before hand.  Chocolatey and peanut buttery, and the oatmeal is yummy too!  Just be sure to keep them air tight when cooled.

these cookies were great!  i didn't have any chunky peanut butter on hand, so i used creamy instead.  i also added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1 and let them set up in the fridge.  that's all i did different and they were very good.  the few that made it past the cooling stage held up quite well for several days.  i will make these again!

These were GREAT!! I substited smooth peanut butter for the chunky and following others' advice, I let the mixture boil for 2 minutes rather than 1. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I've made these a few times now and they have always set up; no matter what the weather is like. Great recipe!!

These are just like the cookies I used to make as a kid.  Thanks for the memories.  Husband thought they had too much chocolate in them, though. I liked them so more for me I guess. :)

Make sure you get your rolling boil!  Used 4 Tbsp of cocoa and 3 1/2 cups of oats.  Next time I will try to put them in a 9x13 pan but it is really easy to make globs on parchment paper!

Very good!  First few batches did not set right at all.  Then I went to the store & bought different oats then what I had & the cookies came out perfect.  Very good.  I am searching for how my Grandma makes her no bakes.  They are the best.  These were not my Grandma's but very good.

Just how I remember them.  I had to give them 5 stars even though they didn't set well for me.  Any suggestions?  I live at 7000 feet so I know that's part of the problem. They tasted great and were very easy.

I keep forgetting to rate this recipe, and I use it so often, I figured I had better log my input.  This is the BEST and EASIEST no bake cookie EVER!!!!

It is a no fail recipe.  I have made it when I didn't have enough butter, and I added more peanut butter, I usually add a little more cocoa as I like the heavier chocolate flavor.  I have used Splenda and they still turn out to be edible.  Of course, these are one of my favorite quick cookies, and when it's that time of the month and I am CRAVING..this always hits the spot.  I usually have the ingredients on hand, and they are quick and easy and D-LISH!!!

There is another no bake recipe that I use when I want more formal cookies to bring to work, but this one is good for last minute, need a cookie NOW nights.

These are so good.  I doubled the cocoa powder, used creamy peanut butter, and boiled them for an extra 30 seconds.  They turned out perfect!

I'm still trying to decided whether I love or hate these cookies.  I could not get them to harden and I think it is because I used all natural peanut butter.  I suggest using Jif or something to avoid that problem. I think I would like them more if I used good quality instead of Hersheys.

Very good and easy.  I made these for a bike ride our group went on.  Everyone loved them and we renamed Peak Performance Patties because we had such a good bike ride.  One thing, I made these on a hot humid day and they didn't set.  So be careful of how hot your kitchen is

I give this 4 stars becuse they were tasty and popular. Even my super picky husband liked them!  My 2 year old loved helping make them, and helping me "clean" the bowl! What a treat, no eggs, so we could eat the "dough" for once!  Great recipe!   I could only handle 1 or 2 , I am not a sweets person, but I liked these!  No leftover though.  Hubby took care of that!

This is a recipe that my family loves! My four year old son wants me to make these all the time. We made them at Christmas along with our other Holiday treats. He wasn't sure he wanted me to put them out for Santa!!

haha so this is sort of a different recipee a bit..

I reduced to 1 1/2 cups of sugar  (half of it xylitol), double the cocoa, to 1/2 cup,  I had no milk so I used 1/2c cream and then reduced the butter to a little over 1/4c.   Then I used extra vanilla, and....

 used corn flakes instead of oatmeal (this is the only mistake, maybe they were too old or maybe the heat sort of cooked them so they have an odd texture)

Overall they are great!!   You really can't taste the xylitol so next time I might use even more xylitol than sugar, and also keep the xylitol/sugar combo to 1 cup   ( I find them really sweet even at 1 1/2 cup) .     I am waiting for them to cool...sort of ;)

Typically I don’t care for no bake cookies, but these are really delicious. I made a few alterations; special dark cocoa, 3 1-2 cups of oats, butter and creamy peanut butter. Yummmmm. This one goes in my cookbook.

This is my husband's favorite cookie. His Mother has made them for him for years. We've been married for 10 years & I just made them for the  1st time this past weekend as a surprise to him. I don't cook much at all so this simple recipe was actually a challenge for me at 1st. I almost never found the cocoa in the grocery store & I was too embarrassed to ask someone at my age.  I finally googled where in the store I'd find it & google gave me a suggestion & there it was! They came out perfect & my husband says they are the best he's ever tasted. His Mother's cookies are always dry & mine were gooey which is what he wanted all these years.  He said what on earth took me so long to try making them & he could have had the perfect cookie all this time instead of hard, dry ones LOL. Thank you for a perfect cookie recipe for the ones like me that has no clue where to start!

Made this with salted butter, so omitted salt.  Creamy peanut butter. I melt my butter before adding anything, boils quicker. This recipe is very close to the one I lost and it makes a pretty darn good cookie!!

The flavor was perfect, but they never set. This could be because I used butter instead of margarine, but I followed everything else to the letter.

I have made this cookie for years. Like many others I used creamy peanut butter. My husband loves them. I usually double the recipe and add 1 less cup of sugar which we think tastes better.

Excellent recipe! I have made these three times in the past few weeks. First time I did add vanilla. The last two times I did not. I do not think there was any difference in taste. Very easy and quick recipe.

I made this using peanut butter and also with no peanut butter due to allergies.
Both turned out well.
For the no peanut butter version I followed the recipe omitting the peanut butter, bringing chocolate mixture to a boil and boiling for a minute. I added 1 cup miniature marshmallows and vanilla and salt. Stirred until melted.
Added the last ingredients and mixed, then added 3 cups of mini marshmallows , spread in pan and refrigerate d and cut.

I used salted butter instead of margarine, I did not add salt.
I used creamy peanut butter instead of chunky.

when I make these cookies I always add the peanut butter and vanilla first.... I stir until the peanut butter is melted into the mix and then add the oats. I also add 3 1/2 cups of oats instead of 3 cups.

Used butter but everything else pretty much as written. Very easy and delicious! Oh, one more thing- always use quick cooking oats because old fashioned will not "cook" and will make chewy raw tasting oats in the cookie.  Enjoy!

No matter the ingredients,  if you want gooey, not dry, cookies-don't boil. Never boil. Slowly, on low heat, stir until the sugar is dissolved,  or almost dissolved.  I've been making these cookies for 40 years, they are my absolute favorite sweet!

Quick Tips:
- Use parchment paper. 
- Pre-measure everything to keep things warm and moving. 
- Use a large melon baller to make cookies. This is a life saver. 
- Put the pan back on the off burner while mixing  in the PB to keep the mix warm. 
- Use 3.5c oats if creamy PB.

What I do:
Pre-whisk cocoa and sugar together in other bowl .
Melt butter, then add milk when just melted. 
Add cocoa/sugar right after stirring in milk. 
Heat to rolling boil, then 60 sec boiling. 
Take off heat. 
Add vanilla and salt. 
Add 1/2 cup creamy PB that was pre-measured and ready. I like to stir in the PB while having the pan back on the burner (burner off of course). This keeps it warm. 
Stir in  3 1/2 cups of instant oats, cup at a time. 
Large melon ball scoop makes 33-35 cookies

These are just like my mom's recipe. The only difference is that I cooked them for a full two minutes at a rolling boil. I also used quick oats. They taste like my childhood favourites.

Came out great! My ex made these cookies all the time and I never had a recipe. I made these, with 3.5 cups of oats and only 4 tbsp of cocoa powder, and they came out really good. My kids like them and their mom makes them all the time, that tells me that this recipe is a keeper

I did this recipe exactly. It never hardened for me and it was still soft. Did anyone else have this problem. I make fudge all the time and this was very similar. I thought it was weird to only boil for a min. That's not even close to the soft ball stage.

I’ve made these cookies three times. I made the following changes. I doubled the cocoa and the vanilla extract as another review suggested. I also added additional peanut butter; about 1/4-1/3 cup. Everyone I give these cookies to say they’re very yummy.

Would have 5 stars if I didn’t feel it was too sweet. Would cut the sugar in half next time. Perfect cookie to make while trying to manage two small kids. I have no time to bake. Tastes great, easy, simple ingredients. Would like to make it with less sugar next time.

These cookies were a taste of childhood and a definite hit!  I used butter and unsweetened almond milk and they turned out great!  I also added a handful of cacao nibs. My daughter asked for the recipe, so this one’s a keeper!

Make sure it’s a rolling boil before you start the timer. I also agree with another reviewer who said to put the oats in before the peanut butter. Finally, every now and then I have to put another 1-2 tablespoons of oats if I don’t think it’s going to set up. Enjoy!!!

I’ve had a recipe for years that would turn out successfully at times, other times not.  This recipe had perfect results!  I did use butter instead of margarine, creamy peanut butter and a heaping 3 cups of oats.  This will be my no-fail recipe for the future!

I loved these. I would definitely make them again. The ratios of peanut butter to chocolate was perfect. I would suggest adding some flax seeds, about a half a cup.

This basic recipe has been around for ages. I remember making these with my children in their  preschool kitchen way back in the 70's.  Of course, we  Mothers handled the cooking on the stove part,  but  the  kiddos sure loved adding the peanut butter and oats.  I just made these again today,  but used chocolate chips instead of the cocoa powder, so I decreased the butter(never margarine)  to 1/4 cup and sugar to 1 3/4 cup to offset. They turned out wonderful.  I also used the old fashioned rolled oats.     I had to force myself to package them up soon after cooling,  otherwise I would have eaten half the batch myself.

Won't be making them again. They really didn't work out, and ended really sticky and just not that appetizing. Made to keep a 6-year-old busy, but I wouldn't say it was worth it.

We had some spare honey roasted peanuts, so I tossed about a 1/3 cup in. Wish I would have added more! Plan on adding raisins next time we make them too.

I've been making these for years.  My changes are:  Be sure to bring to a full, rolling boil for 2 full minutes.  I sometimes omit the peanut butter, and instead I add 1 C coconut, 1/2 C chopped pecans, and 1/2 C raisins.  This recipe is very forgiving to changes as long as you boil it properly.   I also avoid making these on rainy days, the extra humidity in the air seems to prevent them from setting properly and then they stay sticky.

I was inspired a while ago to make these, because they were a childhood favorite back in the 1960's. I have since made them several times and they really do turn out well.

I may fuss a bit more with the ingredients, specifically the cocoa. Perhaps it is the fault of memory, or fading taste buds but mine did not turn out as chocolaty as I remember. I think that it is the fault of the brand of cocoa so I may splurge and buy some Droste. 

The only other word of wisdom I have to add is make sure you really boil it, otherwise it can come out slightly gritty.

I used to make these years ago and thought of them today as it is unseasonably hot. I only varied the recipe by adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of raisins.  I also let the mixture boil for 2 minutes. Delicious!

I only made one change. I used creamy peanut butter, instead of crunchy peanut butter. Also, I used a little less than a half a cup. These took over night to setup. So next time I will only use a third of a cup of creamy peanut butter. They are very good and tasty. I will be making these again!

This is the recipe that I make for bake sales, church potlucks, and my family. I like the crunchy peanut butter better but I use creamy because it goes farther, just a personal opinion. I also boil it until it starts to stick to the sides of the pan and begins to turn granular, like maybe 3 or 4 minutes. I've never got it to set up hard enough otherwise. I get only compliments with everyone asking for them. In fact my grandson wants these instead of birthday cake for his party and our youth pastor ask me to make them for a dinner the youth selling to raise money for a mission trip so this weekend I will be making about 6 batches.

I am not generally a fan of no-bake cookies, but I was out of eggs and desperate for dessert so I tried these. I only had natural creamy peanut butter so my cookies are a little melty at room temperature, but very good refrigerated. Because the liquids start out hot, the oats actually cook, eliminating the “raw” taste and texture I usually don’t like in no bakes. I ultimately still prefer traditional baked goods, but these are a worthy substitute in a pinch!

My recipe is exactly like this except mine calls for butter, not margarine (I never use margarine for anything only real butter),
and 1 1/2 cups sugar. I just made some the other day (using my recipe) and I decided to use 1 1/4 cups sugar and I thought they were still  too sweet although husband likes them like that. I can't even imagine using 2 cups of sugar! I use creamy peanut butter. The recipe I use calls for the ingredients (except oatmeal) to boil for exactly 2 minutes then add the peanut butter and let it melt. Then I add the oatmeal. They turn out great.

I combined this recipe with the other No Bake recipe.  I used 3 good-sized tablespoons of cocoa instead of 1/4 cup (so it was short probably 1 1/2 Teaspoons).  The other recipe calls for 2 T which is 1/2 of 1/4 cup.  The result was good.  I also cut the sugar down just a little (1 and 3/4 cups) and used honey peanut butter.  I only had old fashioned oats so that is what I used.  2 more things:  1 added a splash of black coffee (brings out the chocolate) and about 3/4 cups of chopped walnuts (chocolate and nuts just go together!).  They came out great - oh and I omitted the salt (I used salted butter).  These recipes can be tweaked a little, you just have to experiment!

I’ve been making these cookies for years, not at home so I looked up this recipe to make some. All ingredients are listed with correct amount. This recipe works best when it is boiled for 2 minutes at a full rolling boil. No need to adjust ingredients.

I see a LOT of complaints about this recipe. The problem isn't the recipe, it's WHEN you make them. Like divinity, you can't make these on a rainy day or one with high humidity. They won't ever set up if you do. Hope that helps. :)

I've made these before and they turn out great every time. This time I didn't have any milk so I subbed in evaporated milk. I aslo didn't have enough white sugar so I subbed in brown sugar. I think they turned out just as good if not better! I think they are really sweet so I'm going to try and see what happens if I reduce the sugar a little.

I love No-Bake cookies. For all of you who did not like them, you probably did something wrong. I have been baking for years, and I still miss directions. (everybody does it don't worry)

If your cookies did not firm up and set right, then instead of setting them out on the counter, or where ever else you set them, then freeze them. It takes 1-1 1/2 hours to freeze. If you'd like them to be room temperature, then set them out for 20-30 minutes. They won't melt. They'll hold their shape, and still taste delicious.

If your cookies are too sweet, instead of 2 cups, add one cup of sugar. If they aren't sweet enough, add 1/4 cup sugar, and keep adding 1/4 cup until you like the sweetness.

If they are too dry, add 1-1 1/2 tbsp. milk extra to it. Keep mixing. I would not recommend any more than 2 tbsp. extra milk. 

Thanks yall! I hope this helps!

This is almost  the exactly like my mommas recipe so my tweeks were very minimal unlike some of the other changes. The only thing that I added was extra 1/2 cup of oats and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. They are perfect. Anyone having problems with them being runny just add a hand full oats if you want them a little runny so they are thinner use less oats. Same flavor either way.  IT’S ALL ABOUT THE OATS.  Never throw out a ruined batch throw back on stove simmer until stir-able and what you need pour on cookie sheet and cut into bars.

I give it's 3 stars if made the way it's written.  Instead,  I use 3/4 c. Sugar, smooth peanut butter instead of chunky and less than half a cup of butter and I add coconut.  I refrigerate them to make them stick together better.  They are a huge hit.

I've been making this exact recipe for years.  The only thing I add is about a large handful of peanuts in addition to using chunky peanut butter.  I also use butter, not Katherine.  My son's love them and now, so do my grandchildren!  Fast and easy!

I used half the amount of sugar and it was still way too sugary! Trust me in the fact that 1 cup of sugar is PLENTY for this recipe. Even with 1 cup I still could barely taste the chocolate and peanut butter, it mostly tasted like sugary oats still. Next time I plan on using 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 c. + 2 TBSP creamy peanut butter, and 1/4 c. + 1 TBSP Cocoa. I did have to add maybe 1/3 c. more or so of oats since I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy.

I have made this recipe a few times now and I always get compliments about how great they taste! I even messed up the first go round and used an additional stick of butter( misread the butter label for measurement) and they still turned out to be edible!! I place the no bakes in the frig, I feel they are so much better cold!

this is the first no bake cookies recipe that I've ever done. I made these with creamy peanut butter with honey, cause that's all I had. I also increased the oats to 3 1/2 cups. Other wise I followed the directions as stated. It's been well over an hour and they are sticky. didn't harden up much. They still taste great. I think next time I'll try it with normal creamy peanut butter, and my sis tells me 1 min isn't enough of a boil. So I'll attempt boiling it for another minute or two.

I only had dark chocolate powder and rolled oats. I was worried it wouldnt come out but they were a huge hit! And this was the first time I have ever got them to turn out! I followed the recommendation on making sure it got to a rolling boil and then letting it boil for 1 min. My daughter came home from college and was ecstatic. And my husband was too b/c I havent made them in forever since they never turn out. This will be one we make on a regular basis! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

Just a reminder, everybody lives in such different areas. The best way to get your no bakes to turn out every time is to use a candy thermometer. I had to boil for a little over 2  minutes. You want to boil the mixture until it gets to the Softball stage. js

I was really disappointed- I've made these numerous times, but couldn't remember the amounts- so I used this one- came out gritty, and flaky, couldn't make cookies at all, tried pressing into a pan but wouldn't cut into bars either. Going to store it as crumbs and use on ice cream. Found my old recipe, and it called for only 2 cups of oats and sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa and turned out the way I remember. I used old fashioned oats, but I have made it with quick oats before.

I've been making these for decades, trying all kinds of variations on it, and had a lot of trial and error with the boiling times. Today, I tried this recipe. The 1 minute boiling time wasn't enough, even with the rolling boil.  I timed it exactly, from a rolling boil (when it doesn't calm down while stirring) and they just didn't ever harden. There's no fixing these cookies if you don't get them right, so I'd rather err on the side of over-boiling than under. 2 minutes  of boiling is better than one, for me anyway.

I made these following an old recipe which is almost identical. Variation of using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1.5 c white sugar. Also 2 teaspoons vanilla. I also used creamy peanut butter, but chunky would be ok as well, may make it drier.

I've made these a thousand times, exactly as written, and everyone loves them. Two notes: 1) stick with margarine, NOT butter. I know, I'm a butter girl too, but it makes these cookies dry and crumbly. Good ol' Blue Bonnet is the way to go. 2) Once it hits a boil, stick to exactly a minute. The proper temperature is key to it setting up correctly.  Also, if you want to double your batch or if you just like to use a thermometer, bring it up to 220.5 degrees F (104.7 C). Soft but not sticky.

06.15.17 ~  No bakes are one of my son and DIL's favorite cookies.  We were going to KY to visit them, so I just had to whip up a batch!  They loved them.  My DIL likes them cold from the fridge.  I also shared some with our builders children.  This recipe was easy to make and they held their shape, nicely.

I ALWAYS USE BUTTER! Also, once you put all the ingredients in to heat up in the pot , stir quickly to get the sugar mixed just a bit. Do not stir again until the butter is melting. Minimal stirring is what keeps them from getting dry and crusty. I also let the (creamy) peanut butter sit for a minute once I take it off the heat. Again...once it is heated a bit you don't have to stir so much. They turned out amazing! My husband is my biggest critic and these are his fave cookies! For years I couldn't get them right because I stirred the WHOLE TIME! Am I getting through to you!? Haha! Lastly, I had to set aside my Pampered Chef pan because it (as designed) held in the heat for too long which also made my cookies dry. I use a regular copper bottomed, stainless steel pan and they come out perfect every. stinkin. time.

Loved it! I don't let them cool for an hour though, just eat them! I also put a bit of extra vanilla in, yum!

I was looking for something sweet but I didn't want to go to the store.  I made use of what was in the kitchen and I was not disappointed!  This was a delicious treat.  I used smooth peanut butter and butter as my alternatives and the turn out was great.  I plan to experiment with other add-ins next time to see if I can achieve maximum taste!

This is the recipe you've been looking for! Trust me. When I found it, I only had 3/4cup of oats. So I adjusted the recipe and made them. It yielded 9 wonderful throwbacks to childhood!  This recipe sets up fast!  The cookies suck all the moisture out of your mouth, just like they're supposed to!

made it exactly as it was written EXCEPT I doubled the cocoa.  I waited for it to come to a full (all across the top) rolling boil, then started the timer for 1 minute.  The texture was fine, not dry and crumbly but setting up easily for the cookie.  I use the Hershey's dark chocolate baking cocoa powder, as I'm a dark chocolate fan.  They're quite addicting!

Waaaaay to sweet.  I cut the sugar down to 1-1/4 cups  and it's perfect.  I also use coconut oil in place of butter and only use 1/4 cup.

I had a little problem with the peanut butter not melting doing it this way. I per-fur putting it in with the heat still on/just before the vanilla. I also found that 1/4 TBS works for the Vanilla extract. Just so you guys know :)

I have tried others and this is the best. I use real butter and smooth peanut butter. I also only use 1 1/2  cups of sugar then put in a 1/2 cup of vanilla protein powder, just to give it more protein all round. Very good, I can't keep them in the house.

Delicious cookies that are sooo easy! I made a couple changes: creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy, whole rolled instead of 'quick-cooking' oats (I'd go a bit less than the full three cups of oats, if you decide if you decide to go the whole rolled route). But other than that this is a super easy and very tasty recipe that takes no more than 0.5 hr. to make - start to finish!

I made a few changes... just a few!  (I love the recipe!)  I used coconut oil instead of butter.  It is healthier, but also, coconut oil sets up so well, better than butter.  Also, I reduced the sugar to one cup. Almost half!  But to us, they were plenty sweet!!   I did add 1/2 cup flaked coconut, too, and that sweetens it a bit.  In any case, they  perfect.  Try it!

This is an excellent recipe.  It's easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand (except milk - I've used evaporated, powdered, regular) and my grandkids love to help make them almost as much as they like to eat them.  I do use butter (not margarine) and smooth peanut butter.

I had left my recipe on another computer and looked this one up to remember the amounts. I made it almost exactly as written here, except I used smooth peanut butter and dark cocoa and used 3 heaping cups of oatmeal. I returned it to low heat for about 30 seconds while I stirred the oatmeal into the mixture and then removed it from the heat and stirred it until it felt like it was starting to thicken. Then I quickly dropped it onto the waxed paper and placed it in a cool area while they set. They were ready in about 15 minutes. Hub loved them!

I've been making these since high school. I am now 61. They are delicious. I've even made them with butterscotch chips, cut back on the sugar.   With the regular I also cut back on the amount of cocoa since I'm not a fan of rich chocolate. This as a recipe you can play around with.

I microwaved instead of cooking, and added 3/4 of the oats before microwaving so that half of the cookie wasn't just dry oats. I also did use a little bit more cocoa powder like the other reviews said. The batter alone was delicious, I could have eaten it that way. Most certainly am making this again.

These no bakes have been in my family for years. It was the one recipe I knew by heart because I had made them so often. But with kids out of the house do not make them as much.  I had lost my recipe  so I was glad to find it here. The only difference in this recipe from my original one is I use real butter and creamy peanut butter. The place where people mess up the most is how to long cook it.  Cooking it too long they are hard and dry. Too short it doesn't set up. Do not bring this to a rolling boil be gentle with it and it will turn out ever time.

This is an old recipe my Grandmother and Mother used to make.  It is so easy and loved by the whole family!  The recipe is awesome as is.  Due to recent changes in family member's health, I exchanged half the sugar with Stevia blend, and only used half the butter to lower the carb count and taste and texture still turned out great.  Enjoy!

I made these while camping and they are wonderful!  I did sub in one cup of cocoa crisps for 1 cup of the oatmeal as I was short.  I also used Sunflower seed butter instead of peanut butter.

These were delicious! Some have said to use less cocoa, but I thought is was just right. I like it a little more cocoa-y. I did use real butter instead of the margarine that was called for. It's what I had on hand.
This recipe doubled nicely also.

Turned out great.  So yummy!  They didn't last long in my house.  I did add about 1/2-3/4 more oats than the recipe called for.  And I chilled them in the fridge.  They were perfect!

These were really tasty and would have given 5 stars had they set up a little better. This batch stayed ooy-gooey. My co-workers really enjoyed them but I'm use to a more traditional cookie that is a little more firm like the ones my momma makes.

I made this exactly as it was written. It set up just fine and tasted amazing. I loosely measured the oats but not sure that made a difference. I added the peanut butter and then the oats. It set up in about 15-30 minutes.

I have been making these for many years. It's very hard to not eat them. They are gone fast! I also use just 1 3/4 C. Sugar and smooth peanut butter. We like whole oats because of the texture.

I made it exactly as stated, and they came out gooey and didn't set.  They flattened on the pan and I had to throw them out.  Rolling boil, cooked them for 1 minute and 4 seconds.  Didn't alter the ingredients from OP's recipe except to use creamy PB.  What did I do wrong?

I tried doubling the cocoa. There were problems. The extra dry ingredient made the mixture too dry to hold together. I had to put it back on the stove and add extra butter. Also, the extra cocoa seemed to be too much. The flavor was a bit harsh. Next time I will follow the recipe and not double the cocoa.

Everyone loves these cookies and requests them at family gatherings.  Instead of sugar, cocoa and peanut butter I like to use Nutella, because I have a nephew with a peanut allergy.  I have also used almond butter and half the sugar for those people who don't like chocolate.

Very Yum!!!  Easy and quick.  The texture was perfect- it wasn't gooey or hard as a brick.  I used Jennifer's tips (4 Tbspn Cocoa, butter, & 3 1/2 cups oats).

Tastes OK othwer than a lot of dry oatmeal, and the cookies are NOT setting up. Now I have to find a recipe that actually works and try this again. Was looking forward to having my little one try these but if she does she will need a spoon.

This is a really yummy recipe!! :) I would recommend it to anyone who loves chocolate and peanut butter. :) Be careful not to boil the chocolate, sugar, and butter too long tho. If you do, the cookies turn out grainy. 
Thanks for the great recipe!!

I have made these a few times for my husband.  The taste is good, not really different than other no bakes.  They are easy enough to make that my 5 year old can help.  The only thing I disagree with is the yield-I get about 2 dozen cookies, very small ones, not 3 dozen.

This. Is. The. Recipe.  I cannot say how many times I have attempted this recipe from other sites with complete failure.  From when I was a child and my grandmother first made them, who always got it right, I have not had success on a regular basis -well like 1 in 10 times. This is a cookie I have always loved and would unabashedly beg my friends to make it for me as mine were generally complete flops. However, another reviewer specified the 1 minute rule and that is the key ----to boil the mixture 1 minute after it starts to boil.  Not more, not less. 1 minute.  And I used butter-I won't cook with margarine-but that's just me.  So there you have it.  This is the "cat's meow!"  Be sure to have milk on hand. It will complete the consumption experience perfectly.

I first made these many, many years ago in Home Ec. I recently moved and my recipes are still packed so I found this. It's exactly the same. They were great! The recipe is perfect. For those who had problems with them not firming up or being too crumbly out of the pan, it is an issue of timing. Bring it to a boil for 1 minute. Don't start timing before it boils and don't take too long after.

At 62 i ; as well as my relatives were delighted to have the recipe again.  My sister is making them for Christmas gifts.  The only difference that I used extra crunchy peanut butter.  The original called for smooth (may have been all that was made then) peanut butter and peanuts.

Everyone loves these cookies. However, I did make some adjustments. I decreased the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, used smooth peanut butter, and added 1 cup coconut. They turned out really well.

This is just like my mom used to make growing up. We called them Brownie Nuggets. Personally, I think creamy peanut butter works better, but this is very much THE recipe for good no bake cookies.

I'm on a no-bake cookie kick and this recipe is similar to another I've recently made. I successfully replace the butter/margarine with organic coconut oil and I used Earth Balance Coconut Peanut Butter. Make sure it come to a rolling boil so the cookies will be able to set.

I like the simplicity, but am not fond of the taste and texture - I looveee crispy  crunchy  cookies. I followed the recipe, except I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, yet cookies were overly sweet!!! The margarine taste  overpowered every thing else. Hubby said they remind him of Catch Chocolate Bars, less the nuts.

Love these from when I was a kid!!! Great recipe! I used butter (because that's what I prefer) and used creamy peanut butter (what we had in the cupboard), and they were excellent! They are cooling right now! Can't wait to try a cooled off one!

Made almost exactly per recipe. My variation, I substituted 1/2 c of coconut for 1/2 c of the oatmeal, just because it sounded good. This is so easy, sets up beautifully.

Only no-bakes I've found (so far) that don't fall apart when u try & get them off the paper. Plus, i could make bigger cookies that worked just as well.

I just made these cookies and OMG are they great. This is the recipe I have been looking for since my house fire in 1987. I've tried so many recipes for no bake cookies and none of them were just right.... until now. tyvm bybet2!!  Also, a little hint for all of you. You can make this recipe without the oatmeal and it's a great fudge. You do have to boil it for 4 or 5 mins though instead of the 1 minute the recipe calls for.

I added a few marshmallows for added fluffiness but forgot to subtract a little sugar so they turned out a little sweet for my preference. I am sure the kids will love them though ;)

We always make a triple batch at our house. But we use stick butter and creamy peanut butter. The stick butter makes it stick together a little better.

This is the best! I tried a different one and it came out bad. This one is way better. I make my cookies big with a serving spoon instead of a soup spoon. Nice and big peanut butter drop cookies. This ones going in my recipe book.

These were amazing. My church had a bake sale, and I made seven batches of these, all of them turning out great! I used butter instead of margarine, though, but they still tasted the same. I never used this recipe before, but this will be my go-to one from now on!

I tried this recipe and it set up perfectly.  It tasted yummy.  The peanut butter really adds to it.  It is easy to do especially when we are camping.  I don't have to mess with the oven.  Since I did not have enough quick oats, I used half quick and half whole oats and it turned out fine.

Love this recipe!! I tried it and compared to my regular recipe for no bake cookies and this one is much better.  No problem with them setting up.  I even doubled the batch, it worked very well for me.  A "Two Thumbs Up" recipe.

So I started making this recipe around midnight, and once I had thrown the margarine, sugar, and cocoa into the pan, I realized I didn't have any milk or quick oats (rather inconvenient).

I make these cookies all the time and I follow most of the recipe, except use creamy peanut butter.  It's the only thing I am allowed to bring to bake sales at work. I do however, increase the boil time to 1 minute 30 seconds. The cookies set up every single time.

I absolutely love these cookies, however I've noticed if you use REAL butter (Cabot) rather than margarine...they get harder vs. sticky which I prefer :)

Turned out great! I know I use to off set my times because they would either never set or turn hard before I could even get them all on the parchment. Not these babies! For once I didn't have to start another batch to have one that was eatable.

Recipe calls for one minute boil but  cookies never set due to being undercooked. I've tried it twice to no avail. Otherwise flavor is nice although, I add a little more peanut butter for a better and less bland flavor.

These have always been a favorite of mine.  I like them cooked nice and long so that they get a little grainy.  Yum!  I cooked them for about 3 minutes, which was 230 degrees on a candy thermometer.  I was also told to always stir them with a wooden spoon... I don't know if that really makes a difference.  Drop them onto wax paper quickly!  Honestly, these are really easy.

It was yummy, hardened kinda fast,  but there was way too much oats and not enough chocolate. Next time I might use 3/4s of the oats used. Also very sweet if you like sugar

Super easy and super delicious recipe! I've made these three times in the past week due to popular demand and they've come out perfectly every time. The only difference is that I've used rolled oats because I don't have any quick cooking oats on hand and the texture's been perfect. This is a recipe that forgives if you get a couple measurements a little off, I know because I just eyeballed it on my first batch and they were still perf. These cookies are just mega yummy.

These are the absolutely the easiest cookies to make.  My wife asks me to make them at least once a month.  The recipe needs no changing.  The key is to let the mixture soft boil for the 1 minute.  

After you make these a few times, feel free to experiment.  We like to add about 2 tablespoons of instant espresso to the initial mix... Chocolate, peanut butter, AND caffeine!!!

This is an old recipe but instead use butter and not the margarine. I find the margarine doesn't hold it together, I also don' use peanut butter or put salt in the recipe. But everyone has their own preferences.

The basic idea is sound, but the proportions in the recipe are off. I always end up with too wet a mixture. Try boiling longer or adding more dry ingredients. I like to add some crispy rice cereal to the mix.

Awesome, just like my mom used to make! Every time I make it I follow the recipe exactly, no need for alterations. Make sure you use the right oats, they can be kind of runny if you use the wrong ones (but even then they are delicious!)

I made these and they were great.  Traded the oats for Cheerios!  My mom used to do it all the time. Just use slightly less Cheerios than 3 cups.

Delicious classic no-bake cookies! I used smooth peanut butter rather than chunky--just my preference.

I made the following tweaks after reading all of the previous reviews: used 3/4 stevia sweetener+3/4 sugar in the raw; almond milk; 1/4 cup margarine (I didn't have butter); 2 teaspoons vanilla; 3 cups of quick oats+ 1 cup shredded coconut flakes; creamy pb; and a pinch of cayenne pepper (gives it a kick and brings out the chocolate flavor). I made sure to boil it at a "rolling boil" for the full minute and have the add-in ingredients ready in a bowl to add as soon as the minute was up.  I added the peanut butter last, per someone's recommendation. Phenomenal!  The only thing I would do differently is to make sure I have crunchy peanut butter on hand, b/c that's how I made it growing up, and I think it really is better than the creamy.

So delicious!  I used Special Dark chocolate cocoa powder and I doubled the recipe.  I tossed in a little cold milled flaxseed and my kids couldn't tell at.  These are really the best I've ever made.

This is a good recipe but to make it "healthified" I used maybe half of the sugar it called for. I also added an extra cup of oats. I even substituted some the sugar with stevia. My kids didn't notice (they love these!!) and it makes a great after school snack.

I made these last night. I used JIF Natural Creamy PB w/Honey and regular Quaker Oatmeal. I made sure after reading the reviews to do the rolling boil for no more/no less than one minute. After mixing everything together I then put it in a shallow cake pan instead of drops of cookies. It came out a little gooey, but so yummy and scrumptious, lol. I will make these again :)

I tried this recipe twice... the first time I didn't boil it long enough because it was too runny coming off the spoon, so I put it all back into the pan for a couple more minutes, got it at the perfect consistency and it came out delicious, perfect no-bake. I thought that the next time I would listen to the instructions and continue boiling for one minute before taking it off the heat, so I did. This time it came out incredibly dry. I followed instructions exactly to the "T" this time around. Just kind of frustrating! The cookies are fabulous if you can get them to the correct consistency everytime, but the recipe does definitely seem a little too finicky. Which is the reason I'm giving this a 4 star instead of a 5. I'll keep trying and find that perfect batch again soon! :)

I've made this recipe about 4 times. I haven't used the crunch peanut butter because we don't use it outside of cooking (in fact, we've never used it in cooking!). 

OK, so compiling the ingredients were fine. But I'm not sure if I agree with atmospheric conditions, outdoor temperatures, whatever the heck other reviewers are saying about home and weather conditions. I followed them to the nines. 

The 1st batch just wouldn't get firm! Not even in the fridge! They were good, and we ate them, but they fell apart. The 2nd time around I added a knife full more peanut butter a spattering more of oats. Still not as firm, but didn't crumble at the mere touch. 3rd time around, I FINALLY figured it out. This recipe (For me) requires a full cup of peanut butter, and about 1/4 cup more oats to become firm. Also, an obvious note, store in the fridge when the cookies harden.

So I rated this recipe 3 stars because the recipe seems to need a little tweaking, but the taste is good.

Really good! I did use butter instead of margarine, only a cup and a half of sugar, coconut milk instead of cow's, almost double the cocoa powder, and almond butter instead of peanut. They were still awesome, as are all no-bakes in my opinion. Yum yum!

This recipe reminds me of my English teacher, Ms. Diane Wahabb, who made them one afternoon just because... the smell just pinned to my memory jajaja. So, long time after, i searched for the recipe.. voilá!.. Tried it.. and nearly died.. Peanut butter and cocoa were ment to be together! I used homemade peanut butter (less additives,less sugar, less unwanted fat), and the result was the same! Great for a hot day , when u just don't wanna turn on the oven :)

AMAZING! I couldn't stop "trying" them so I had to hide them away so that there would be some left for my boyfriend.  I made one in the shape of a heart for valentines day for him. I will certainly be making these again! Thank you for sharing this delicious and oh so simple recipe!!

I made it Vegan. . .  And used vegan margarine, and soy milk, and change the peanut butter to Almond butter (because I am allergic)  I might have to make some more because they will be gone in a few minutes. . . so quick and easy!

I did as someone else suggested and added the oatmeal (3 1/2 cups rather than just 3) before the peanut butter, although I'm not sure it made that much difference as it all pretty much stayed the same temperature throughout both additions. I do have to note, though, that before scooping out the cookies onto the wax paper, make sure you have pans or towels underneath. Otherwise you get lovely grease stains on the cardboard sewing board you're using for wrapping gifts... I'm just glad it wasn't on my table.

This recipe works great and has become my go to recipe for no bake cookies.  I do find that butter instead of margarine is key (but some may feel it is a personal preference), and although regular cocoa makes a good tasting cookie, I find that using dutch process cocoa makes for a superb flavor with these.  Only other thing is that I almost never have chunky peanut butter in the house, so use creamy peanut butter in its place.

As for any changes to amounts, I guesstimate on peanut butter - so when I make these the peanut butter may be a little light or a little heavy.  Either way they have turned out good.  

Also with the vanilla, I have used both vanilla extract and vanilla bean paste.  Both give the same results.

I have been making these cookies since I was big enough to reach the stove!  I love this recipe and was so happy to find it on this website.  The only thing I do differently is use real butter instead of margarine, use creamy all natural peanut butter, and I substitute almond milk (unsweetened) for the regular milk.  I have also found that, if you let this come to a full, rolling boil, it takes only one minute to cook after that and they turn out every time.  Another way to test is to take a few drops of the boiling mixture and drip it into a cup of cold water.  If the drops stay together instead of bursting apart, it's done.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Good no bake recipe, that reminds me of the ones I made when I was a child. I make it without the peanut butter.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is less cocoa.  Still came out great..

This is a very yummy and easy recipe. I followed the suggestions of others and used butter instead of margarine, creamy instead of crunchy peanutbutter, 4 tbsp of cocoa, and 3 cups of oats. Love, love, love! (For those who had trouble getting cookies to form, make sure you dip the cookies ASAP. If you let the batter cool any, it will dry and start to crumble. The ones I dipped immediately turned out perfect!

I cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and they were still very sweet. I didn't have any quick oats so I just used rolled oats and they turned out fine. I really liked how easy these were to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

love this recipe but i too, like many others tweak it to my own tastes, i've always used a recipe from my great great grandma with more cocoa powder which i've seen people post they changeit to 4T but that is not a change, 4T is a 1/4c. i use 1/3c cocoa and 1/3c peanut creamy peanut butter and 3 1/2c quick oats, if you don't use quick oats you will have a very tough texture.

Great recipe, just like when I was a kid. I used palm nectar sugar instead of white sugar, same amount. I added 1/2 a cup more of all natural peanut butter than the recipe calls for because we are pb lovers :). Will use this recipe for years to come. Thanks!

I used Ovaltine chocolate powder mix, 2 and 1/4 cups, instead of the cocoa and sugar because that's all I had in the house and I NEEDED these cookies.  Wow!  Took me back to third grade.

Awesome cookie! Did what someone suggested and cooked for 2 to 3 minutes. (Used whole oats and 1/3 cup cocoa powder as well as reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups) LOVE them. :)

My diabetic version: Being that oats raise my sugar level way up like alot of other people I decided to try my spin. I used Truvia & unsweetened coconut. Great substitute for the real thing. My family even likes them made this way.

I followed the recipe to the T and these cookies turned out amazing! Delicious! I admit, they did have too much of a peanut butter flavor, but it was still good. I used smooth peanut butter instead of chunky. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves no bake cookies and they are easy and pretty much mess free to make. Only thing I changed was instead of butter I used butter flavored crisco. The cookies seemed to set up a little better!

Yum!  I used natural PB because it was all I had on hand, and they still set up beautifully.  I did increase the oats to 3 1/2 cups at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Definitely a keeper!

I just tried these and they are great! Not too chocolatey, but just enough. I did use 3-1/2 cups oats. It made 2-1/2 dozen cookies. I will definately be making these again and again. This is the first recipe for these that I have found that has come out right the first time. Also, to other posters, 1/4 cup is equal to 4 Tbsp.

I made these for a BBQ, read other users comments, and followed the recipe as written, except that I used real butter.  When I first added PB, oats, and vanilla there was not enough moisture to form cookies, so I put back on the stove top, added another 1/2 to 3/4 cup PB and a few splashes milk, and stirred for about a minute and then dropped on wax paper.  I thought uh-oh, when they immediately became mini oatmeal pancakes, but came back about five minuted later and they were really easy to shape and even held shape when I layered them (with wax paper in between) and place in the refrigerator.  The result was a huge hit, everyone loved them and I will make them again...probably even today!  Might experiment some and see if I can turn it into a healthy breakfast on the go type of a bar.

This is a great recipe for one of those hot summer days when you really don't want to heat up your kitchen. You really only need 1 1/2 cups sugar, but other than that it is a great recipe that I would recommend to anyone.

AMAZING! I made them just as the recipe says, except I added an extra 1/2 C Oats, and used regular Oats because that was all I had on hand. Delicious. Will be my standard no-bake recipe from now on.

These cookies are delicious!!  I love how fast they are to whip up, and that they don't require a bunch of expensive ingredients.  Apparently everyone who tries them feels the same way because they disappear quickly.  Thanks for sharing.

Great, easy recipe!  Turned out perfect when timed 1 min. exactly from a good, rolling boil.

This is a very good recipe, the only chocolate flavored one I use- I recommend timing it after it has come to a full boil and always use real butter if at all possible.
My entire family gobbles them up in no time!

Simple and de-lish! My super-picky kids love them and it is a treat with protein and fiber! I made them a couple of times and used more peanut butter and it threw off the texture of the cookie...so, I stick to the correct measurements now!

I didn't love these, those I used oil instead of the butter. So maybe that's why. We thought the texture was a bit strange- kind of grainy. And these aren't healthy just because they use oatmeal. They still have a lot of fat and calories.

Thanks so much for this recipe.  I didn't have to adjust this recipe at all, they came out perfectly!  As soon as I tasted them, I was transported back to childhood, when my mom would make these as a special treat.  I would smell them as soon as I came home from school and make a bee-line for the kitchen.  And my mom would yell out from somewhere else in the house "Don't eat more than one of those cookies, now!  You'll spoil your supper!"

I really liked this rexipe. The only thing i had a probem with was that I was out of vanilla extract and plain oats, so I used my apple cinnamon instant oatmeal. Cookies still turned out great!

Turned out just like I remembered them.  I was a little hesitant with the crunchy peanut butter but YUMMY! 39 degrees in Florida so it was a perfect time to make them.  These will not work for us in South Florida in August though.  Unless you set your AC at 50 they will not set up correctly!

So I was craving something sweet, and in a pinch put these together with some small changes (so I didn't have to run to the grocery store).    Nutella instead of cocoa powder.  Smooth peanut butter instead of chunky.  Added unsalted pistachios for texture.    I have to admit they turned out pretty great considering I didn't follow an exact recipe. Kind of an Italian No Bake version. Yum!

These are amazing! I halved the recipe and I did use butter instead of margaine and only added 2tbl spoons of cocoa. I also ran out of white sugar so i use 1/4c brown sugar. Turned out great! I will make these again!

This recipe was great.  They turned out delicious.  The only other comment I want to make is that they were pretty rich and sweet (a good amount of pb, sugar and cocoa powder will do that).  My kids and I loved them but my husband prefers less sweet.

Yummy but seemed really moist and greasy. Possibly just the humidity where I live, but not sure. Will probably not try again. Keep on looking for a better recipe.

I made these for a kid's party once because I had an economy size container of oats.  Now even the adults beg for them every time we get together.  One of my friends said they were better than his mom's no bakes.  Eek, not touching that one with a ten foot pole.

Yummy! I use creamy peanut butter in place of crunchy, just because of personal preference. :-)

My husband's favorite cookie.  These are easy to make and take almost no time to make.  The hardest part is waiting for them to cool down and set up.  My husband has been known to eat this straight from the pot.

I followed the recipe and these cookies did not turn out at all.  They were so dry I couldn't form them into cookies.  I didn't want to throw them away so... I mushed them into an 8X8 pan, drizzled milk over top and refrigerated until they were smooth the taste was good but way too dry!  The recipe for No Bakes that is NEVER fail is "No Bake Cookies I"

These are FABULOUS!!! I agree with other reviewers who added more oats when using smooth peanut butter. Mine were a bit runny due to using smooth pb but set up in the freezer and tasted great!

Exceptional cookies and so easy to make. You can't ask for more.  Only changes I make is I use regular butter instead of margarine and we never buy chunky peanut butter in this house (personal preference) so I always use creamy peanut butter instead.  I've done these so many times and I recently found out a great little trick that I'm not sure if anyone has written it here yet but use an ice cream scoop for these puppies and it will be a breeze! I scoop up the mixture, press it against the plate, get rid of any lingering edges and they plop onto the plate.  I just press them down a little bit to make them more cookie like but it helps take a lot of work out of shaping them. Oh and one last thing, I never boil the mixture for 1 min. I just bring it up to a boil and its off the stove.  I've never had any problems with the cookies shaping or anything like that. Thanks so much for the upload!

I made these cookies last weekend. First time to ever make No Bake Cookies and they turned out perfect!! I followed the suggestions to wait till it came to a full rolling boil, then waited the one minute, before removing from heat and adding in the rest of the ingredients. Plus, I didn't have chunky peanut butter, so I used regular and they turned out great! Will make these again. Thank you!

Pretty good no bake recipe, It took longer for them to set up, so maybe a little more peanut butter, or I could just pop them in the fridge. Good flavor.

I have 4 picky boys who don't eat oatmeal at all. They love these cookies! Great healthy alternative for afternoon snack for them! I used 1.5 tsp vanilla extract and 3.5 cups oats and they came out perfect! They were set in about 20 minutes however I let them cool for an hour before putting them away. They are nice and moist and chewy. Perfect recipe!

My group loved the finished product. One suggestion, though. It is a good idea to drop them onto the wax paper quickly. It's much easier right after you stir in the ingredients, as the mixture dries out as time passes.

These were so yummy! I love the texture of the oats with the crunchy PB. I boiled for about a minute and a half and they set up perfectly.

I can make these at the drop of a hat! They are nice and chocolatety with the perfect blend of peanut butter. My 13 yr. old daughter would sit and gooble a batch if I let her. And my "choco-holic" mom adores them. Always one of the favs on my Christmas Cookie Trays =)

I had my niece and nephew over and we used this recipe for CHRISTMAS cookies and it was perfect! They are 4 and 7 and almost made them all by themselves, then as I was spooning on to the wax paper, they were right behind me with sprinkles and red-hots... perfect and easy to decorate (who woulda thunk?)  They had a ball and it was E-A-S-Y!

These are really yummy. My mom normally brings me these cookies when she visits me at college from a local amish lady, but these cookies are so much butter. I added a little more vanilla to mine (but I love vanilla) and I only used smooth peanut butter, I don't think peanuts would be very good with these. Along with a glass of milk, these cookies are a great end to a long day=)

These are SO good!  No Bake Cookies or as we have always called them Boiled Oatmeal Cookies have been a Christmas tradition in my family since before I was born.  We all love them, and when I share them with people who haven't had them before they always get rave reviews.  They're also great without the cocoa.  No changes need to be made other than simply omitting the cocoa.  FYI: I've never added salt to mine.

For those that have dairy allergy/intolerance:    Substitute milk for vanilla almond or soy milk Substitute butter with coconut oil (the thick kind) I also used 1 3/4 cups sugar since the almond milk has sugar in it.  It still taste delicious!  If you like dark chocolate try 2tlbs cocoa and 2tlbs dark chocolate cocoa.  Soooooo yummy!

Delicious!  They were almost like fudge. I put equal parts oats and coconut it these. I have made many no bake cookies but these are the first I had with peanut butter in them. They really make the cookie a hundred times better.

The cookies come out perfect every time. I went by the recipe but used smooth peanut butter. My friend tried this recipe but says it comes out runny. Just add more oats until it looks the way you want.

These were delicious! I actually used a cup less of oats because I used half and half instead of milk, and it made them too thick with the full amount, but they were perfect!

This is my go-to cookie when I have nothing in the house and am craving something sweet!  My recipe however, uses 1/2 cup cocoa, creamy peanut butter and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I also don't let it boil because I MUCH prefer a gooey-er cookie rather than a drier one.

This a fantastic recipe!  I always use butter instead of margarine, about 3/4 cup of creamy peanut butter and about 3 1/2 cups of oats.  They have fabulous flavor and it's hard to keep people out of them so they can set up!!

This is a great recipe if you make slight changes (added more oats - 3 1/2 cups total, used butter instead of margarine and 3/4 cup PB).  Mine firmed up nicely after about 15 minutes and had wonderful flavor.

They never really became very firm.  If you are looking for a moist no-bake cookie, this is it.  But if you want something more solid, try another.  I added the extra 1/2c of oat, and they are still messy.

The flavor on these is wonderful, chocolately & rich! However, boiled for full minute, & the only variation I used is ICBINBLight instead of butter & after stirring in 3 cups of oats, they were too loose so I added another full cup of oats (4 cups total). 2 hours later they are still not firm. (Note: this did not stop me from tasting a few!) I would make again & add the extra cup of oats & maybe coconut like another reader.

This recipe is amazing. I love to bake but I don't usually eat that much of what I make, but after two days my husband and I gobbled all of these up! We went hiking and took some of these with us and they were like mini delicious protein bars.  LOVE it!

These were very good. I love the rich chocolate and peanut butter taste. They were very moist, but a bit crumbly and messy when eating.

I love these cookies!  I used butter instead of margerine and creamy pb instead of crunchy because that is what I had.  Cooked mine exactly how it says for one minute after it boils (which to me means rolling boil, otherwise it would say starts to boil if they wanted it sooner).

Super easy to make. I needed a recipe for some birthday cookies and this was perfect. I did feel like I needed to add more oats but I just tossed in a handful or so more. Easy, easy, easy...and tasty too.

These are great!  They are exactly as I remember from when I was a kid.  I loved helping my babysitter make them.  I've also heard them called Refrigerator Cookies.  My husband took them to work and it was quite the trip down Memory Lane for several of his coworkers.

Just made these tonite for me and my boyfriend (serious sweet teeth!).  They're fantastic!  So easy...I have to agree with the reviewer who suggested to have the vanilla, salt, and peanut butter pre-measured.  These are so chocolate-y and peanut butter-y....just what we needed to satisfy our late night dessert cravings.  Thanks, bybet2  :)   This will be a permanent addition to my cookie repertoire!

These tasted awesome...but I must have done something wrong, or it was the weather or something because mine remained a little sticky. Next time I think I'll try cooking it a little longer than 1 minute.

This is such a simple, yet yummy recipe. I like to place the cookies by rounded spoonfulls on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet. Press down gently and put in freezer. My family loves them this way...Enjoy

I halfed this recipe so I wouldn't have so many.  I also substituted low fat creamy peanut butter and low fat margarine.  I added an extra half cup of oats too.  It turned out fantastic and didn't lack any of the yummy flavor!  I love to eat this when it is still gooey in the pot!

I was looking for something quick and easy to make with my 4 year old son because my nephew was coming over for the night and he wanted to have a dessert treat for after dinner for them.  Well we made these cookies and they were the best! I cannot get over how good these were and will def make them again!  Thank you for an awesome recipe

I sorted the reviews by most helpful and made them according the review that was second from the top. I made them w/o vanilla as I was out and used the creamy PB (the extra 1/2c as other reviewers suggested). This is my first time making them with PB and loved the salty/sweetness of this recipe. Thanks for the great addition to my cookbook!

The ingredient proportions here are perfect, but the cooking time is off by quite a bit (at least for my stove, at my altitude, etc., etc.). Cooking these for only a minute leaves me with sticky puddles of goo, no matter how long I let them sit; two minutes and 15 seconds seems perfect. Then they're absolutely delicious! I agree that it doesn't matter if you use old-fashioned or quick oats, although the quick oats are more fragmented. Both work. Thanks!

Great recipe! Instead of white sugar I used brown as it's much healthier, and I also took another members advice by adding a cup of coconut. I spread the mixture into a 9 x 13 pan and cut into pieces after being in the fridge for about an hour. Next time I might try Nutella instead of peanut butter, just to experiment. ;) Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I used to make this when I was a kid.  It's a quick chocolate fix.  This is a great recipe, they came out perfectly. I used butter instead of margarine and non fat milk.

For an added pizzazz I added 1/8 cup Smooth-n-Melty petite mint chips. It added a wonderful minty flavor to this otherwise excellent recipe! 
This is my favorite no-bake recipe, hands down!

This is the best No Bake Cookie recipe I have found!  I had all but given up on making No Bake Cookies because every recipe I've tried would not set.  Then I tried this one and it turned out perfect!  I think I'll be making No Bakes a lot more often... my family will be happy!

Excellent no bake!  I followed the advice of others and waited for a rolling boil, then I timed for 2 minutes.  I also let cool for about 10 minutes in the pan before scooping onto waxed paper.  Perfect shape & consistency!

Perfect as is....  NO need for changes!  I have learned over the years of making no bakes that you do have to be quick at the point of adding the final ingredients and then spooning them onto the parchment if you want that wonderful sheen!!  (Or else they will start setting up and getting hard before you spoon them out)

AWESOME!  I followed another reviewer's advice and had all my ingredients on hand and I waited for the perfect boil before timing.  I've made them twice this week already! Perfect for holiday entertaining. This is one recipe that deserves all its stars.

these cookies look perfect, but did not set right. the boil time of one minute actually needs to be extended to 3-5 minutes like other recipes call for. 

I will use this recipe for the future, but modify my boil time.

Love how these cookies turned out as far as how quick they set. However, I found that there was not enough chocolate taste.

For 9 years, I have tried countless recipes similar to this one. With every single recipe, we were either scrapping it off the wax paper with a spoon or eating a very hard, crumbly cookie. But not this recipe! I'm very pleased to say I have made these cookies 8 times in less than 4 months, just because they are so delicious, it's fool proof! They are really easy, and always set up just right each time. I made no modifications to the recipe other than I use creamy peanut butter, and I leave the salt out. These are OH SO YUMMY!

These are FANTASTIC!!!! I used 5 Tbsp of real butter plus 3 Tbsp of margaring (it's what I had in the fridge) and they set up within minutes. I used creamy PB and used 3 1/2 cups oats. I also used oldfashioned oats and they turned out so YUMMY!!!!! I will be using this recipe for years to come!

I used margarine, and mine took a lot longer to set than I expected (a few hours) but they ended up tasting great. Probably would be better with real butter.

Although these cookies resemble a recipe I made as a child and has since been lost.  They lacked in comparison.  I am not sure what it was that was different, but I don't remember them having milk.  These came out very runny and I had to add more oats to get them to hold together.

This was really easy, fast and fun to make. 
If you use 1/4 cup of butter, the cookies come out less greasy, dry faster and have more crunch, but with the 1/2 cup, they look more like cookies.

YUM! I've made these cookies several times. I like my no bakes cold so I usually freeze them after dropping them on a cookie sheet. My husband loves them this way as well. They stay chewing when you do this. Delish!!

Oh YES YES YES!!! Finally, the perfect chocolate oatmeal no bake cookie!  I've been trying to find a recipe that doesn't crumble by the next day.  These are actually chewy and set up so nicely.  I used creamy pnb, boiled for 2 minutes, and 3 1/2 cups oatmeal-per others recommendations.  I'm so excited, this is my quick chocolate fix, with added nutrition by way of oatmeal.  That makes it alright to pig out, right?

I lost my old recipe for these cookies & I wanted to make them so I decided to try this recipe. It tastes just the same as the ones I used to make (as far as I can tell haha), & everyone loves them! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so easy to whip up and made a great snack for movie night! I made only a fraction of the recipe, but maybe I should have made the whole thing!

Great recipe! I actually prefer to use old fashioned oats or a mix between quick and old fashioned because it gives the cookie a really nice texture. I usually have to add more oats in doing so(I'm guessing the old fashion don't absorb the liquid as well as quick cooking).

Very good taste but these are so dry that they barely held a cookie form. I had to actually shape them when they were still HOT and I burned my hands. I would recommend trying to adjust this recipe or using a different one.

I've been looking for my mom's no-bake recipe and this is it.  She added coconut shreds, walnuts and raisins or any combination she had on hand, to hers with the oats.  Try it, you'll like it.

This was the best no-bake cookie recipe I've ever tried!  The only difference is that I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy because that's what I had.  Ignore the other reviewers that say to change a bunch of things.  Don't tamper with perfection!

I cut the recipe in half, but used 3 TBSP cocoa, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 3/4 c. oatmeal. My family used to make these a lot when I was younger, and we never put peanut butter in it- so I left that out as well. I usually put my cookies in the fridge to cool down; they are chilled and ready to eat within 20 minutes.

Very good but too much sugar!  I reduced to 1 cup of sugar (doesn't set up quite as well but not so overly sweet) and used sunbutter instead of peanut butter.  Added 1 cup of unsweetened coconut for added texture/flavor. Yum!

I have been making these cookies for years. I do increase the cocoa to 1/2 cup, and use only creamy peanut butter, but that is the only change. 
You do need to have everything at the ready..but these are no fail cookies!
Everyone in the family requests these over any other cookie.
Easy quick clean-up, too!!

I'm giving this 5 stars, but if it was an option, I'd only give 4.5.  I did make some changes though.  I used Splenda, skim milk, light margarine, and used 1 3/4c of oats.  Some of the cookies were very moist, and a couple of them were dry.  My husband enjoyed them and I loved them.  Reminded me of the cookies I used to get at the school cafeteria when I was little.  I will definitely make these again!  :)

I made this the first time and didn't have near what the recipe said I would have.  Maybe if I made extra small cookies I would have.  I came out with about 20.  I made it again and doubled the recipe and it came out wonderfully!!

These are really good no bake cookies, but not the best I have had, I would probably add more oats if I make them again(seemed kinda mushy).

I love this recipe. I use sunbutter and carob powder instead of peanut butter and cocoa powder. I reduce the sugar to 1.5 cups since carob powder is not as bitter. It comes out fantastic every time.

Just what I wanted.  The consistency was a little off (still gooey after cooling for several hours).  However, that was partly my fault, I think I let the mixture boil too long.  So keep an eye on it!

No on in my family liked these cookies.  I liked the ease of making just wish they would have been eaten.  The biggest complaint was that it was too peanut buttery.

My mother used to make this recipe when I was younger, and now I make it for my kids. The only difference in her recipe and this one is the peanut butter: I use 1/2 cup of creamy (though sometimes I use a little more). I always have all of the ingredients ready before I make this, and I add the peanut butter, then the oats and stir vigorously. These are wonderful and easy enough for children to help you make. My toddler loves to help with these cookies! Just wanted to add that if you don't want to deal with the cocoa powder, you can substitue two one-ounce pouches of Hershey's unsweetened baking chocolate.

I boiled my mixture for 90 seconds.  They set perfect and weren't crumbly or runny.  We made a half-batch as a trial for an event we are required to bring cookies to next week.  We ate them all!!  Just as I remembered making as a child.

A classic!  This recipe is so easy and failproof.  I like to have my ingredients all measured and ready to use, and I boil the chocolate mixture at a rolling boil for 90 seconds.  Turns out perfect!

Wow!!! The cookies were great! (I don't think eating four is nutritional, though!). The only problem is that one person commented that they were a little grainy. But, they were super tasty! Thanks! Great recipe!

I had lost my recipe for no bakes and this one is as good as the one I lost.  I did as suggested in another review and let it cool a little to form easier. I will stop looking for the one I lost and use this one.

These are really good, but REALLY sweet. I think I will attempt cutting back on the sugar next time. My kids love them, though, and had a blast helping me make them.

Fantastic no bake cookie! My 2.5 year old wanted to make cookies. This recipe was perfect because I didn't have any eggs. He was able to help with most of cooking. Love recipes that are OK for him to help with. We just put the cookies in a 9x13 and they set up nicely. YUMMY!

While babysitting my 5 year niece she decided to pretend to be Rachel Ray and wanted to make cookies.  So we picked your recipe and they were "YUMMO!"  I have been making No Bakes for over 25 years and this recipe is the best!

Recipe is good as well if you leave out the cocoa  and just use peanut butter . I prefer  creamy . Also butter to margarine and I boil 3 minutes .

My mother has made these cookies my whole life.  I like to eat them warm in a bowl as opposed to letting them cool... tastes the same, I just don't want to wait.  :)  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It really is the closest to my mom's recipe...

This recipe is awesome!  Just exactly what I was looking for, too.  It is extremely easy to make, and tastes great.  The nature of this recipe also makes it really easy to modify.  You can add a few extras after removing from heat, if you wish (nuts, choc hips, fruit, etc -- I added marshmallows myself).  Great for kids or people who aren't very confident at cooking.

This is a great recipe for a hot summer day when the last thing you want to do is heat up the oven. These cookies are EXTREMELY rich for my taste so I formed them into non-overwhelming bit size pieces. Will improvize a little and make again.

This is an easy recipe my entire family loved. We gave it a Halloween spin by shaping our cookies into ghoatly blobs. When the cookies were set we make ghoat faces on them with Betty Crocker, orange, frosting in the tube.

I didn't have any powdered cocoa, so used 1/4 C Hershey's chocolate syrup instead and reduced the milk to 1/4 C and the sugar to 1 3/4 C to compensate.  They still turned out great!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, Betty!!!

My house was split on this one...husband and two kids think they are just okay but my youngest and I both think they are awesome!  The two of us are actually glad they don't like them as much as we do because that just leaves more for us to eat.  Since I'm the one giving the rating, I give it five stars... easy, fast, NO baking and sooooo yummy.  What more could you want in a recipe?

Delicious cookies - when they turn out.  I can't figure where I went wrong, but I made about 3 batches of 3 dozen and one batch turned out (maybe boil for 2 min instead of one?)- the others just stayed moist and goey and never solidified.  The ones that turned out were fabulous :-)
