We made the cookies and they spread so much that they overflowed the pan!  I baked them for exactly 10 minutes and they were overdone on the outside and underdone in the middle.  We probably won't make this one again.  The recipe called for only 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, I would recommend using 1 teaspoon.

I tried this recipe for a church function.  The kids liked it.  Cookie didn't bake as well in the center as the outside.  Maybe make four smaller ones instead of two large cookies.

The cookie was not very flavorful. The dough was runny before it was baked and it cooked very unevenly. I won't make this again.
