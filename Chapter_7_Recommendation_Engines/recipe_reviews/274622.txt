I must admit I went way "off the reservation" with this by combining this recipe with Chef John's "Special Roasted Potatoes" HOWEVER, I have never tried Za'atar (Zaatar) as I have never heard of it. This stuff in 'killer'! I cut russets in 'planks' and drizzled with olive oil, etc. Then I continued with this recipe. Holy Smoke!! Thanks Nicole for broadening my spice horizon. (FWIW In Corvallis, OR South Town there is a middle-eastern market that sells this called 'Bazaar International Market'.)
