Oh my goodness!  This stuff is great.  I made mostly as written...never buy garlic salt or garlic pepper, so just added salt/pepper and more garlic (probably at least twice the called for amount).  Only marinated the 4 hours and did on the grill.  My 13 year old son just devoured it!  Will make again and hopefully marinade even longer next time.  Served with grilled pineapple and rice

The name says it all!  I used 4 large boneless chicken breasts that I pounded down thin and cut in half.  I used olive oil instead of canola and let this marinate all day.  It had a hint of sweetness along with a hint of smokiness, a very nice combination of flavors.  I served this with rice and a garden salad but would love to try Wilemon's bacon ranch pasta salad with this one!

Husband called this the best chicken I've ever made.  I have to agree.  Do not skip the liquid smoke as that is the "secret ingredient" in my opinion.  I also did not have garlic salt or garlic pepper, so I used 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/4 t salt, and 1/4 t pepper.  Marinated overnight.  Will make again and again and again.

Chicken does not get any better ths  this. For those who rated less than 4 1/2 stars and stated they did not follow the recipe, why bother rating something YOU did not do right? Too pungent or salty, really?

This was good.  My grill isn't working so I had to bake it and that worked fine.  I do wish I had marinated it longer than the 4 hours to really let the flavors soak in.  I could not taste the liquid smoke at all, so I guess I'm less sensitive to it than some!  Made as written and will marinate it longer next time!

I haven't tried this recipe but wanted to say; I'm slightly dyslexic and thought your description said "I have been using my neighbors guinea pigs" (as in, instead of chicken.) After reading and re-reading it and all the comments in horror and confusion I finally realized my mistake. Now I can't stop laughing. Cheers!

I had to slightly modify this recipe due to lack of certain ingredients.  I cut out the liquid smoke, sesame seeds, molasses, and garlic pepper and it still turned out to be a fantastic teriyaki marinade.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper.  All I had on hand was chicken breast tenderloins, so they only required about 8 min grilling time on each side.  I will be making this again and again!

Sorry for the long review but I am really excited about this one. I followed it to a T, almost. The difference being,  I used a package of what they call around here, "Pick of the Chick" three thighs, three legs and three breasts, all with the bone it. I grilled the legs and thighs over indirect heat for a total of 25-30 minutes. They were done inside and the skin was a golden brown with a little char. They were beautiful! While we ate the greatest grilled chicken dinner ever, with the legs and thighs, I  continued cooking the breasts for an additional 10 minutes for a total cooking time of 40 minutes. I was thinking "I'm sure they will be sort of dried out like most big breasts with the bone in, so tomorrow we will have grilled chicken salad." The next day I took the chicken off the bone, and zapped it in the microwave to take the chill off. I then topped our salad with it and I was simply dumbfounded. The leftover chicken was still very moist, very flavorful and so tender. It was the best grilled chicken salad I've ever had. The negative reviews are crazy. It is simply delicious. This is not a difficult nor expensive recipe to make. The flavor, tenderness and the moistness has made this one of my favorite grilled chicken recipes. Thank you Wilemon for the excellent recipe! I want to come to your house for dinner!

Really good flavor...I usually avoid liquid smoke but added a splash out of respect for the author of this recipe and was pleasantly surprised. Served with a fresh romaine salad I topped with grilled red pepper and Bills Blue Cheese Dressing..so good.

This is superb!  Serve with the 'Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad' from this site and envite your neighbors asking them to bring a fresh vegetable to grill!

All the best ingredients in one dish! Marinade as long as you can for full flavor, and if you can use a real grill rather than a stovetop then all the better.

This makes delicious chicken that we really enjoyed!  I didn't have liquid smoke, so left it out, but followed all the other ingredients.  Great flavor!  Instead of grilling (b/c we like large bone-in thighs & I always worry that the outside will burn before it cooks thru), I baked at 375 for 45 minutes. The thighs were so tender and had a gorgeous color.  Thank you for sharing this keeper of a recipe!

My family pronounced this chicken "fabulous" and could you please make it again....  vs. this is "interesting" which is synonymous  for it's just okay but please don't bother in the future.  I did leave out the salt as the teriyaki sauce, Worcestershire, liquid smoke and soy sauce (use the low sodium variety) already had enough in it.  Found this marinade to be a pleasant mix of sweet, salty and smoky which is difficult to achieve, but you, Wilemon, found the secret mix!  Served this with Fried Broccoli and Onion Rice both from AR which complemented this marinade beautifully.

It is frustrating when reviewers give a negative review because there are ingredients in a recipe that they don't like. Why bother trying the recipe to begin with if you don't like some of the ingredients that are obviously going to stand out in the finished product? For those of you who are trying to decide whether or not to try this, let me just tell you that the 12 people I had for dinner last night thought it was really good. Had barbecued skewers of boneless chicken thighs marinaded for over 6 hours in this recipe, and skewers of beef tenderloin marinated in different recipe, both were a hit, but the chicken was the overall favorite. I had 16 thighs so I doubled the recipe and used regular soy sauce, so to account for the higher sodium soy sauce I omitted the garlic salt. And instead of minced garlic added five gloves of pressed garlic, I like garlic, and it certainly was not too much for anyone at the table. This is a great marinade for smokey bbq chicken thighs, definitely a keeper, and as the Japanese would say, "bursts with unami". However, I don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a good hint of smoke, or garlic, or soy sauce, or...lol, I'm sure you get the point. But if you don't have any issues with the list of ingredients, and you like barbecued chicken thighs, then by all means give this marinade a try. If you're concerned about the smoke, or salt, reduce the quantities the first time you try it, but I would recommend that you try it.

For the first time - my chicken turned out wonderful! Just don't forget to flatten the chicken. That is the REAL secret to perfectly bbq'd chicken! Enjoy. :)

This wonderful recipe INSTANTLY became a favorite with Hubs and me when we took our first bite!  It is very, very good.  And if that weren't enough, it came off the grill looking BEAUTIFUL!!  I omitted the sesame seeds and instead used about 1/2 t. sesame oil and for the teriyaki sauce and I used a product called teriyaki baste and glaze.  I reserved some of the marinade before adding the chicken and Hubs used it to baste the chicken (I used skinless, boneless chicken breast halves) as it was grilling.  It had perfect grill marks and looked beautifully moist.  Perfect presentation!  This recipe is wonderful as is, but next time I'd like to try adding some "heat" to this.  I am delighted I found this recipe!  Thank you!!

Delicious marinade that's easy to make!  I substituted honey for the molasses and used boneless/skinless chicken thighs since that's all I had.  Worked great!

This was delish!  I will be making again for sure.
Warning thou...  for skinless boneless thighs 12 minutes per side could be too long - think it will depend on your BBQ. I did mine about 6 to 7 min. per side and they were perfectly done thru.

Clearly, this recipe is not in need of another glowing review, and yet, after making this chicken marinade, I can't help but praise it!  I followed the recipe the first time, aside from using chicken breasts instead of thighs, and we nearly inhaled the grilled chicken!  I cooked the remaining marinade at a gentle boil for 15 minutes so that we could use it as a sauce on the grilled chicken.  I am now making this marinade for the second time and I increased the brown sugar, just for personal preference.  I also doubled the marinade because we scraped the pot clean last time.  Highly recommended, and so glad it's been shared with us!

This marinade was ok - flavourful and made the chicken moist. However I wouldn't say it was delectable or give it 5 stars. 

I did have to make two changes out of need - first, I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder and seeing as how there's more than enough sodium in the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce (even low sodium), and teriyaki sauce, making this substitution was obviously a healthier option. Second, I didn't have sesame seeds, so I subbed with 1 tbsp of sesame oil and cut the canola oil back to 2tbsp.

This was very tasty without the garlic salt(used fresh garlic). I didn't have liquid smoke flavoring either, but since it was cooked on my bbq, it had that smoky taste. Good stuff!

Oh, my! What a great marinade! Made this exactly as written and the flavor of the chicken breast that I marinaded overnight was fantastic. It was late in the evening when I was asked for this and was shocked to find that I was out of Teriyaki sauce! No problem when you have AR going for you, just did a search and found a great recipe and had the marinate in the bag with the chicken in no time!

Unfortunately this was not a good match for our family... my husband could not eat more than one bite, he said it tasted like a hot dog... I think the liquid smoke really was too much, and could have been eliminated.

This was awesome; we loved it and will make it again and again!  I was a bit worried about the liquid smoke, but added it anyway - then I marinated the chicken overnight and it was so good! Thanks for the great recipe!

My family found this a bit boring.  It tasted as though I just threw some soy sauce on chicken.  I marinated overnight, so it's not as though the flavor didn't have a chance to sink in.

We had a crazy week and  I ended up with chicken marinated for three days before grilling. It was amazing. I substituted sesame oil - about 1/8 tsp for the sesame seeds as I had none on hand. My husband told me to get rid of the other marinade recipes. Kids had seconds. Moms happy.

This is my new go to marinade for everything!
I was leary about so many of the ingredients being high in sodium, so instead of the garlic salt and garlic pepper, I just use garlic and pepper without additional salt,  however,  I do believe that sodium is part of what makes the chicken so tender. A word to the wise, everyone is concerns with cooking meats thoroughly to avoid bacteria. I would just as strongly caution to avoid overcooking because that toughens meat especially on the grill. I cook in very large quantities, so I have doubled, tripled, and quadrupled the recipe depending on my use for it. 

at this point I have used this marinade on chicken, on pork ribs with a little cayenne for more kick,  and on both broccoli and grilled peaches. It suits everything!

PS - don't discard the marinade after removing your meat, too much goodness and flavor to throw away. Please in a saucepan and bring to a simmer to ensure cooking out bacteria, thicken with a small amount of cornstarch if you like, and use it to enhance the rest of your meal.

Simply Brilliant! Thank you for sharing the efforts you have worked to achieve.  Easy to see you are a chef at heart. When the aroma wafts from the grill, heads turn. This has been a game changer when I BBQ at the pool for friends. I started adding 1 teaspoon of dried lemon peel and 1 tablespoon of rice wine vinegar for zing and and an acid. Your recipe is perfect, my 2 add one were merely to suit my tastes.  Thank you for taking the fear out of using Liquid Smoke. Please keep cooking and sharing, I wish I was one of your guinea pigs.

Yum!!  This was great!! I made the marinade exactly as written except I cut everything in half since it was only me eating and I probably marinated it for 6 hours.  It's a lot of ingredients, but everything works together so nicely.

This is an extremely good marinade and it is delicious on chicken thighs, cooked on the grill. The one thing I would say to improve it (and I am someone who is constantly working to improve my own recipes) is that it could use some onion flavor. That being said, next time I will add some chopped green onion to the marinade.   I marinaded thighs and put them directly in the freezer. It makes a great, easy clean up dinner. Thanks for posting!

I cook the chicken fast in  a 475 to 500 degree oven and we enjoy the pan juices immensely.  Definitely our favorite marinade.  Hot oven is key. One of these days we will grill it...sure that's delicious too.

Way too heavy-handed on both the garlic and the liquid smoke for our taste. When it comes to liquid smoke, a few drops go a very long way. Those two ingredients were all we could taste. Sorry I can't say better.

This wasn't 'delectable' in my opinion, but wasn't horrible. I followed the recipe, but used honey instead of molasses since I didn't have it on hand. To me, this ended up tasting somewhat like teriyaki chicken, when I was hoping for something with a little more zest. I think I'll stick to my Italian Salad dressing marinade for grilled chicken - always ends up juicy with just the right amount of flavor.

This really was Delectable!   By far the best grilled chicken I have ever made!   I did not use any sesame, only because I forgot I finished the bottle a few weeks ago.  I used boneless skinless breasts, and grilled them on a piece of foil.  Perfectly juicy & tender, which is a first for me!

This is a keeper. It's easy to make with typical on-hand ingredients. The flavors work together wonderfully! The gentle smokiness and subtle sweetness provide that special "what's in there?... I'll have some more" -- not too salty, not too gooey. Just right. Although there's soy sauce and teriyaki, those notes aren't predominant. The marinade works well on the grill -- there isn't too much sugar, so it allows the chicken to cook well without getting burnt. 
I tried it with skinless boneless thighs and will try it next with chicken breast skewers.

good marinade! I baked my chicken rather than grilled. I think I will grill it next time! I left out the sesame seeds, used only 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke, and garlic pwder adding sea salt and fresh ground pepper!

All in all a wonderful marinade. I made 1 change and that was doubling the liquid smoke. I love that smokey flavor (some say a bit to much) but I loved the turnout. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!! Can't wait to try it again!

We loved this! I baked it for about 45 minutes at 375 and it still turned out wonderful. I didn't have molasses but I followed the rest of the recipe just as it was. My boyfriend enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again. We had it with a side of long grain wild rice. Very satisfying.

This was really good. The only thing I did differently was I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and omitted the sesame seeds. I put the chicken in the marinade in the morning and we put the chicken on the grill in the evening, doesn't get much easier than that! Served with sugar snap peas, also from this site, and homemade bread for a great meal. Thanks, Wilemon, for the recipe!

Wife and friends loved this recipe.  I subbed black pepper for garlic pepper and smoked paprika rather than regular.  We will have this again.

I really like this marinade.  Haven't tried it on the grill, but baked in oven and tasted good.

It was OK.  Because of the oil and the chicken thighs being a little fatty it is really hard to keep them from burning from flame ups. I shut off the gas on one side of the grill and that helped a lot. I would try again but would bake them instead of grilling.

I didn't have teriyaki sauce so substituted sirachi sauce in its place(we like spicy).  My 8yr old daughter was fighting my husband for the last piece of chicken!!! Delicious- thanks for sharing!

Tried this tonight AS WRITTEN... WOW! My kids scarfed this stuff down like it was chocolate! Awesome meshing of flavors! I do not understand why so many people insist on changing up ingredients before even trying it as is. By far, THE BEST chicken marinate I ever tried!

Very tasty chicken. This was asian style and I sliced this up and served it over a bed of spinach and argula along with an Asian toasted sesame dressing. I will fix this again. It was very good and the soy wasn't too strong like teriaki chicken but this had a teriaki taste so I would call this teriaki-like. I liked it. Thanks for posting Wilemon!

Made changes based on personal preferences, but LOVED it and what it did for my grilled meats (used it on pork and beef too!).  I didn't have teriyaki so used 1 T soy sauce as called for and 1/2 T more soy sauce, 1 T sherry and 1/2 T water instead.  Not sure why low sodium soy sauce then garlic salt.  Used regular soy sauce and fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and garlic pepper.  Not crazy about liquid smoke so cut that in half and used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika.  Also added a few drops of sesame oil, and cut out the brown sugar. This has now become my ONLY marinade when grilling!

Holy moly, this was fantastic!!! I used 3 lbs of b/s chicken breasts and doubled the marinade. I also marinated for 10 hours and I'm glad I did. The flavor is wonderful but not overpowering and the meat is super juicy and tender.  Next time I will retain some of the marinade before putting the chicken to. Rush on at the end of grilling. I will also add a bit more fresh garlic. Didn't have garlic salt or pepper so used reg salt and pepper with garlic powder. I also completely forgot the canola oil, which didn't seem to be a problem. I just oiled the grill grate well before grilling and as was fine. Highly recommended!

Did not have teriyaki sauce, and instead of paprika we like the hotter "sambal oelek" chilies! added about a teaspoon of that to the marinade...only had it in the marinade for 2 hours (time constraints) and could not grill today. I think it turns out great and moist in the oven. I dumped all the marinade in w/the thighs in a skillet with very tight lid.  Part way thru cooking time I added chopped mushrooms, celery and cabbage. Also added chopped green onion. Was VERY GOOD!!!! Served with instant potatoes. Rice would have been great too, but am nearly out of my brown rice.  Thanks so much for this recipe Wilemon :)

Made this today as recipe is written, although I did add a bit of onion powder.  It was excellent!  I marinated it for about 4 hours, turning the chicken regularly.  It was very moist and flavorful!  This may become our staple marinade.  Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful!  This was perfect for the boneless, skinless thighs we had.  Great on the grill.  I didn't have molasses so I used honey.  Tasted great!  Only marinated for 3 hours but still fantastic.  Thanks!

This was great! I was looking for a recipe based on what I had in the cupboard and found this one. The only ingredient I was lacking was the teriyaki sauce and it still tasted great.  My kids ages 9,11, and 13 asked for seconds and thirds. Will make this a regular in our home. Thanks so much!

Thought the recipe lacked flavor for some reason.  Not for sure what was missing.  It was good, but I just baked it in the oven.  Maybe it is grilling that makes it great.

Great flavor.  If you grill, be aware that the brown sugar in the marinade will cause the chicken to burn if not watched.  Will be making this again and again during grilling season!

This recipe is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and used boneless chicken thighs, marinated the chicken for about 7 hours. The chicken was very tasty and very moist. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks!

Delectable Marinated Chicken Haiku: "Yes, delectable! I used chicken breasts, not thighs. Just a bit salty." Even using low sodium soy sauce, this marinade ended up being a bit on the salty side. I didn't change anything about the recipe other than using veg oil, not canola, chicken breast not thighs, and marinating for more like 6 hrs. Nice, crusty dark chicken w/ a moist interior.

This is a fabulous recipe. I loved that all of the ingredients are things I already have. I used about 10 thighs and marinaded them overnight and half of the day. We grilled the chicken until it was 135 degrees and it was perfect! So moist and super flavorful. This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent and flavorful! I didn't have enough time to marinate any longer than 1.5 hrs but it was still very flavorful. I did reserve some marinade and thickened it to use as a sauce. So yummy!

My husband loves this recipe and well, it is super easy to throw together so in my book it is a winner.  Great for when I'm really not in the mood to cook.  Mix up some marinade in 5 minutes....refrigerate and let time do the work.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is outstanding. I forgot to add the liquid smoke and we still loved this chicken. I agree with one of the reviewers who said 12 minutes per side was too long. We grilled ours about 6-7 minutes per side and they were perfect. Served this along with vegetables marinated in balsamic vinegar and then grilled. Yum!

This is RIDICULOUSLY delicious!!  Follwed the recipe pretty closely, didn't feel like lighting the grill so we broiled the boneless chicken breasts for 7 mins on each side and  HOT !!  We left the chicken in the marinade over night too, it's a keeper!

Made as written. I normally don't care to much for teriyaki anything; but my wife wanted teriyaki chicken and I ran across this recipe. This is the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had. It was simple and has great flavor. It wasn't over powering or salty. It'll be made again.

Outstanding! I didn't have the smoke flavor and I used garlic powder, salt, and pepper, otherwise everything was as the recipe stated. I used it in a crock pot with a turkey tenderloin on low while I was at work, and the taste was out of this world. Not too salty, just very well-balanced and delicious.

I am not a fan of store bought teriyaki sauce or liquid smoke.  I substituted maple syrup and balsamic vinegar and got the most tender, moist chicken thighs.  I used the rest of the ingredients though.

I used chicken breasts because it was all I had on hand. It was too cold to cook it on the grill so I cooked it on the stovetop, flipping periodically to cook uniformly. This also allowed the sauce to thicken a bit and created a nice glaze. My 6 year old LOVED it!

Excellent! I used reduced sodium worcestshire, teriyaki and soy sauces and added NO additional salt. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt also. I used olive oil instead of canola and honey instead molasses. I marinated chicken breast for 24 hours and then grilled...full of flavor! Thanks!

I thought this was good, and my boyfriend loved it - went back for seconds and thirds! I didn't have the sesame seeds, so I skipped that, and I didn't have garlic pepper so I used lemon pepper instead. In hindsight, I probably should have used garlic powder and regular pepper, but I wasn't thinking! Thanks for the great marinade.

Oh heavens....this is a keeper!!! I double it and add in some boneless breasts (also added a bit of white wine since it was in the fridge and used toasted sesame oil because I was out of sesame seeds). My husband is the grill master and says that this is the best marinade we have used in 30 years. That's saying something as his claim to fame is his marinades. Praises to the culinary creativity of Wilemon!!!

I think this was the best teriyaki -type marinade I have tried, really delicious chicken. I used 8 boneless skinless chicken breasts and added chopped green onions and grated gingerroot to the marinade. Also used vegetable oil instead of canola and didn't have garlic pepper, so I used white pepper. Used everything else that was called for and it came out great-tasty and very moist. I marinated for about 24 hours.I served it with steamed rice and stir fry veggies w/ asparagus and squash. Will use from now on. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

This marinade is awesome!  Everyone in my family loved it.  Even my 25 year old son, who normally doesn't have much to say, stated several times, "This is really good!" I followed the recipe, except I used regular pepper since I didn't have garlic pepper.  Chicken came out very moist and flavorful.  You cannot go wrong with this....it's truly is delectable & delish!

Oily marinade combined with fatty meat caused the BBQ to keep flaring up, resulting in burnt chicken.  Won't make it again.

Even without some of the ingredients ( I didn't have teriyaki sauce, liquid smoke, molasses) this still rocked!  I increased the Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce to make up the difference in not using molasses.  It was wonderful!

I found that I had enough marinade to handle 15 thighs (boneless and skinless) when all were put into a ziplock baggie.

Most definitely, this is my new favorite chicken thigh marinade!  Thanks for posting it!

7 Stars IMHO!!!...Great Cooked on The Grill Too....I Added Some Beer, Cut The Thighs in Half & Even Made Shallow Slices to Allow The Marinade to Permeate The Meat Better...Add Half a Minced Jalapeno or Serrano Pepper if You Like Some Kick.......

This is by far the best chicken I have ever tasted off of the grill. My family ate this and wanted more. I found that by adding green onion to the mix it makes for a more flavorable chicken. I also used chicken breast, pounded thin, and skewed before grilling. The words wonderfully delectable come to mind. I have tried several other recipes from this site and always found something I would change, or did not like about them. That was not the case here. I am a very picky eater and this recipe concured the great and difficult task of pleasing my choosey taste buds. Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper for sure.

WOW - delectable is an understatement. This is the best, and easiest chicken marinade that ive ever tried. I didn't have any liquid smoke or paprika, but it was still to die for. I sliced chicken breast very thin (1/3 inch), soaked it in the sauce overnight, put it on some skewers and grilled it on the BBQ. love it and can't wait to make it again. Served it with pasta salad and was a perfect summertime meal.

So good! Cut into tenders which shortened the cook time a bit and made more surface for this wonderful marinade! Also I tossed the chix onto a super hot grill, seared and burned just a bit the marinade for a delightful crispy texture. Such a winner, everybody loves it.

I thought this chicken was amazing. We were entertaining friends, two of which have celiacs. In an effort to turn this recipe gluten free, I substituted the soy sauce and teriyaki sauce with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. It turned out perfect and had great flavor. Everyone raved about it, including one of our friends who is a professional chef, and the double batch was gone in minutes!

This really is delectable! I like to put together my own marinades and BBQ sauces, but had been coming up flat this season. This marinade was easy, as all ingredients are commonly on hand, and the WOW factor is huge! Even my MIL said it was the best BBQ chicken she'd ever had!

This was absolutely delicious!!!  I did not have any teriyaki sauce or molasses, but I did use maple syrup in place of molsses.  Even though I did not have all the "right" ingredients, I am still giving it 5 stars, it deserves it!  Will be using this recipe again!  Thank you for sharing it with us!

Fixed these as written except marinated them overnight for dinner the next night. My husband thought they were good. I thought they lacked something. I may play with the recipe a bit next time and increase the teriyaki sauce and garlic. Maybe add some red pepper flakes to jazz them up.

This was okay.  When I was marinating it in the fridge it smelled so good, like barbeque sauce.  But, when I cooked it, the marinade came off and turned out sort of salty.  I think that was because of the teriyaki sauce and soy sauce.  But, I think it might have been how I cooked it as well.  We didn't have gas for our grill and it's in the middle of winter, so it's cold.  So, we didn't grill it.  We baked it instead.  I might not make this one again.

Delectable marinade, indeed. The only changes I made was to remove the skin and baked the thighs as it was raining out. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Having plenty of chicken to cook I doubled this recipe. It was flavourful but not fabulous. Although I wouldn't cut out the liquid smoke I would use a little less. Everyone ate it without complaint though. Thanks for the recipe.

We really did like this but thought the garlic was a bit much. Next time I would just use regular salt & pepper to reduce the garlic flavour. Otherwise another great recipe, Wilemon!

I've made this at least  a dozen times, so I'd say that I probably am due to write a review.  This is a legit review too, because I don't change a thing.  I make this as-is and it is absolutely incredible.  I marinate chicken thighs all day and they are so dang good.  Don't question it, just make this and enjoy the compliments.

I love making my own marinades and I have made a lot.  However - hubby and I agree - this is the best grilled chicken I have ever made!  I like how it only takes about 4 hours to marinate, instead of overnight.  I also love how I have all the ingredients already in my pantry.  Grilled some corn to go along with it and made a macaroni salad from the Weight Watchers site.  Thank you Wilemon!

This was perfect for me and my family as written.  We like things marinated longer so I marinated for 6 hours instead of 4 and I grilled for 6 minutes on each side instead of 12.  I will  definitely make this again.

This was really good - one of the best marinades that we've tried for chicken.  The only difference that i made was to use chicken breasts because that's what i had on hand.  I cut them in to thicker strips and marinated overnight.  When it was time for dinner hubby put the strips on skewers and grilled them basting with some left over marinade.

Could have been delectable and may be 5 stars if I add followed my instinct to omit the liquid smoke (and may be decrease a bit the amount of Worcestershire sauce) instead of listening to all reviews suggesting to make it without modifications. Will try to make again with adjustments.

Followed the recipe exactly.  I must be the only one because I and nobody else at the table was very impressed.  Had to really watch on the grill even over indirect heat, black burnt marinade.  For so many ingredients, not that flavorful.  I use a very simple perfect everytime marinade for chicken or pork: ¼ cup each of oil, soy, bro sugar and terriyake sauce.  Marinade over night.  Simple, easy and delicious.

I have two non chicken eaters and two non beef eaters. I was looking for something that would go with both. This recipe fit the bill! Not only was it GREAT on the chicken, but it was WONDERFUL on the skirt steak! Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

Fantastic!  I took this for our campout adventure (first time with two kids) and it was delish.  I made it in the morning and marinated the chicken in the ice box for our first nights dinner.  I didn't have molasses so this was the only exception that I made.  I will definitely try it next time with the molasses though I can't imagine it being any better.  It was also yummy to snack on two days later while unpacking the car.  Thanks for sharing!

The title does not do this recipe justice. So delicious! I make it as it says except I use boneless, skinless breasts instead. I also prefer to cook it in my charcoal grill using the lump hardwood charcoal rather than regular charcoal. It just adds to that sweet and smoky flavor. This melts in your mouth and will keep everyone coming back for more. My friends beg me to make this for them all the time!! Oh, I must add, the longer you let the chicken marinade, the better. I let it marinade for 24 hours if possible. For camping trips I prepare it and put it in a gallon zipper bag in marinade so that its ready to grill at any time while were camping!!

The marinade was delicious.  Unfortunately, we were rained out and had to bake instead of grill, but it still turned out wonderfully!  I marinated for 2 days, and can't recommend it enough.

Excellent marinade.  I used garlic powder & minced garlic and marinated the chicken thighs for 8 hours then grilled them.  Even before I put them on the grill my husband asked what smelled so good.  We loved the marinade.  Will make again.

My husband and I and my two grown sons really liked it.  I unfolded the thighs and left out the garlic salt.  I didn't think it was too salty or smoky.  I've already made it twice.

I haven't found that many 5 star recipes, but this one hits the mark. Great on chicken; also perfect for pork tenderloin / pork chops! Great job with it Wilemon - thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was terrible!  It started smelling bad as soon as I added the molasses and the liquid smoke.  I marinated for 6 hours and it was no more tender than if I would not have marinated it.  Will not make again.  Gave it one star as I had to give it one to review...

This marinade was so yummy! I will definitely be making this again.  I didn't have liquid smoke or sesame seeds, so those were omitted.  I substituted Sucanat for the brown sugar and honey for the molasses.  Also, I didn't have any real garlic nor garlic salt so I used garlic powder in substitution.  I cooked it in the oven and it was so yummy.  I bet grilling would be fabulous.

This was very good chicken.  I actually ended up doubling the liquid smoke and we didn't think it was too much at all.  Guess it just depends on what you like.

I went out and bought Molasses and Liquid Smoke because I wanted to make this EXACTLY as written.  The flavors were great together, and I love the way the meat carmelizes on the Grill.  I marinated for 8 hours and longer would have been great too!  Served with White Rice, Broccoli, Grilled Pineapple, and even some Macaroni Salad for the pickier eaters in the house.  Everyone loved it and I'll make it again!!

Smells great. Family loved it. I marinated the chicken overnight and we thought the flavor was great. I used straight garlic ( 2 cloves) and salt and pepper. Great flavor for those who don't like spicy foods.

Totally delicious! I used 1/2 of recipe--marinating 2 large  Chix breasts overnight andcut down on garlic--use low sodium sauces.   I then heated my stovetop grill pan very hot and grilled the breasts about 7 minutes on each side (turn down heat on each side last 2 minutes). Best, tender chicken I have eaten!

I added 1/2 tsp of fresh ginger & 1/2 tsp of sesame oil since I didn't have any liquid smoke. I also added 1 tsp of honey instead of brown sugar & 1 tblsp of sake.  With so many spices & how could it not taste good! I also pan fried it in a hot iron skillet with the extra marinade added as needed since I soaked only 1 hr prior to cooking. With that much flavor in such a short time I can only imagine the full effect :)

This marinade is a keeper!  Hubby and I thought this marinade was one of the tastiest ever!  I used olive oil instead of Canola Oil, chicken wings (bone in, with skin) instead of boneless skinless thigh meat;  But did not vary recipe in any other way.

Oh yes...Definitely delectable for sure.  This was one tasty piece of chicken.  I prepared just a single piece to test this out and I now have more ready to be marinated for tomorrow.  I usually know by the ingredients if I'm going to like something and this proved to be just as delicious as I was hoping for.  Yowza...can I have seconds yet?? (That one piece turned out to be a total teaser!  Good thing I had a large salad to go with, that's all I'm sayin) :0)  What are you waiting for, you should be making this already!....

Tried this with chicken tenders, as they were on hand.  Had run out of brown sugar so "heaped" the molasses.  Do not have garlic salt or garlic pepper so subbed garlic powder, 1/4 tsp salt and fresh ground pepper.  The Worcestershire gives a bit of heat which is quite tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this marinade twice now, and I'm telling you.........the flavor is just outstanding.  The liquid smoke hits just the right note.  I followed the directions exactly, mostly because the ratio of flavors is what makes the stuff taste so good.  I'm a total fan of experimenting with other people's recipes, but I think this one should probably be followed exactly in order to earn the adjective "delectable."

This was very good and I was skeptical after reading some reviews. The marinade did not smell good after mixing, but I put everything in a plastic bag and let it marinate for over 10 hours. The next day when I opened the bag it smelled great. My husband and 5 yr old liked it and they are very picky. Very easy when prepped the night before. Thanks!

Amazzing!! Our kids loved it as well! Although we did not use the molasses or sesame seeds because we did not find them, the chicken came out super flavorful and tender. And we also broiled it instead of grilling it, but we will definitely grill it next time! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Yum!  The title is accurate.  I marinated this for about 12 hours using all low-sodium ingredients.  I left out the sesame seeds and liquid smoke.  I grilled it on a grill pan on top of the stove and it turned out great.  Next time I think I will double the marinade and use half of it to baste the chicken while on the grill to give it a glaze.  We will be making this again.

Delicious!  My family devoured this chicken!  I had to bake it in the oven because we were out of charcoal, but it was still moist and tasty!  Didn't have any sesame seeds and didn't even think to use sesame oil, which I will try next time.  This recipe definitely made it in to the family rotation!

Awesome on boneless, skinless chicken thighs on the grill. My first time using liquid smoke. These were delicious!

This was the absolute best grilled chicken I have ever tasted!!!! I did what one reviewer recommended and flattened the thighs as I put them on the grill.  Simply kept turning them until they were done.  I did, however, leave out the sesame seeds, because I didn't have any.  Also used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.   Just wonderful!!! Even leftovers were scrumptious!!!!  Thank you sooo much for sharing this!!!!

Yum!!  This was sooo good.  I didn't grill it...I broiled it on high and it was so delicious.  I also didn't have sesame seeds, but that was the only thing I changed.  The meat was nice and juicy and the flavor of it was awesome.  Definitely making this again

I made this chicken last night.  The marinade was pretty easy to make although I would suggest mixing it up in a bowl first and then putting in a ziplock just because it's easier to measure the ingredients into a bowl then trying to measure and hold the bag open too.  It's very flavorful and moist.  I didn't grill it because I live on the second floor of an apartment building and don't have a grill but baking it 45-50 min in the oven between 325 and 350 worked out just fine.  My boyfriend said it was the best chicken he's ever had!  Can't wait to make it again!

A truly delectable marinade! I had to increase the worcestershire, soy, and teriyaki a bit to completely submerge the chicken (I used 8 chicken tenders). Also got a little crazy and sprinkled with thyme, ginger, and more sesame seeds prior to baking (I don't have a grill yet) at 375 for 20 minutes. Served this with the author's Bacon Ranch Past Salad.....and oh yeah!!! An all around winner of a meal!

Great marinade works with beef too! No sesame seeds but it didn't really matter. My family loves it and always asks me to use this marinade for our meat. I followed the recipe but for no sesame seeds and no canola oil so I used olive oil. Would recommend again and again!

I love chicken and am always looking for different delicious marinades.  I followed this recipe almost exactly as written except I used 6 boneless chicken breasts that I pounded and marinated for 10 hours .  Wow!  The chicken was so juicy and absolutely delectable!  I will make this dish often.  Thanks Wilemon!

The only ingredient I didn't have was sesame seeds, and at $4.49 a jar, I felt I could do without them. I marinated the chicken for a night, and half the next day. I cooked in the oven (did not barbecue) at 350* until there was no longer any pink inside the meat. The chicken was "melt in your mouth" tender and the sauce was fairly tasty, but I think I should have used a bit more of the ingredients than suggested. It could have used more flavor. My family and guests enjoyed it, that's what counts. Thanks for the recipe, I'll use it again.

Made as directed except for the garlic pepper.  In my rural area that is impossible to find.  So I did 1/8 tsp of garlic and 1/8 tsp of black pepper.  The recipe was delicous.  I can't think of any way to improve on this unless I was wanting to have it a bit more spicy.  Then I might add some cayenne pepper to the mix. Yummy and the leftovers the next day were wonderful, too.

This was very good. I didn't have the mixes spiced. So I used 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of garlic. I didn't have sesame seeds so I used 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. Olive oil instead of canola. As suggested by a previous reviewer I cooked the meat on the stove at 375 degree for 1 hour. I simply put the meat in a large piece of foil in a pyrex dish. Perfect and indeed delectable.

Our local grocery store has a sesame marinade that I have been trying to duplicate for years.  This is as close as I have ever come.  It's outstanding thanks for a great recipe!  Only change I made was to add fresh ginger and garlic.  Awesome!!

This was fantastic!  I didn't have any liquid smoke or sesame seeds but even without them, this was a very good recipe!  My husband, kids and even picky mother-in-law loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

This was really easy to put together.  The only changes I made was to substitute honey for molasses (didn't have any)and omitted the liquid smoke (don't care for it). I marinated chicken thighs for about 5 hours and could barely taste the seasonings.  Next time, I'll plan on letting them soak overnight.

I've had this recipe bookmarked for AGES - I'm kicking myself that I didn't make it sooner. I had to make a couple of changes due to what was on hand - I used sesame oil instead of sesame seeds and canola oil; I didn't have molasses and couldn't find my teriyaki, so I added a small squirt of hoisin sauce. I marinated the skinless drumsticks for 6ish hours, turning roughly every 30 mins. The meat was a touch dry (my fault - I baked them too long) but so unbelievably flavorful! I served them with sweet potato fries and homemade mac n cheese. Fantastic. Thanks!

yummy!  I left out the liquid smoke and used garlic powder instead of salt, I also used agave instead of brown sugar.  I only had an hour to marinade it and it was perfect.  Not too salty and a little sweet.

This was pretty good.  I used b/s breasts, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  My chicken dried out, which usually isn't a problem for me.  May have been my fault, but I'm not sure.  Anyway, the marinade was good.  It was missing something...not sure what exactly...I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  I probably won't make it again, but thank you for posting so I could try it!

It was easy to throw together, grilled up beautifully, but the flavor was lacking.  I won't give this a bad rating since I didn't follow directions and only marinated one hour.  I might try this again and marinate the 4 hours suggested, but there are other great marinades that just don't take that long.

This is delicious!!!  It's too cold to grill out, so I broiled it, and did marinate it for 2 days (hot stuck at work and didn't have time to cook), but those were the only changes I made...

I don't know why I've never rated and reviewed this recipe. I've made it a dozen times. It is the perfect way to cook chicken thighs. Marinate for the day, then grill or broil for dinner. I make the marinade exactly as listed. Well named recipe.

Loved this! I ended up using only freshly chopped garlic because I didn't have garlic salt. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. I don't have a bbq so I baked them at 375° for 40 minutes and they turned out great! I shredded the chicken and topped on rice. Garnished with a bit of sesame seeds and green onion. It was beautiful! I steamed some broccoli and it was the perfect meal. Thank you!

This is a new family favorite.  I used split skinless chicken breasts and sautéed on the stove as my grill was out of propane.  I boiled the remaining marinade and used it as a glaze in the last few minutes of cooking on each side.  There is enough sugar in the marinade that you really have to watch and make sure it doesn't scorch, but the end result was excellent!  Deep, complex flavors that void being overwhelming.

Very good recipe.  Everyone liked it.  Cooked it pretty much as in the recipe, except added a little spicy teriyaki marinade to give it a little heat.  Did not find it too salty at all.  And substituted a couple of breast tenders for the white meat lovers - came out fine, though a little dry as expected from white meat. Definitely putting this one in my 'favorites' file.

I mixed this exactly as written except I didn't have garlic pepper.  So what I did was sub garlic powder and black pepper.

I have that FoodSaver Quick Marinator and used it with bone-in skin on thighs.  Then cooked them in my air fryer.

Very nice flavor.  Not sweet, not garlicky and not too smokey either.  Will use this one again.

So amazing.  You can not go wrong with this recipe.  My whole family loved it.  This is definitely a keeper.   I only made a few changes.  I did not have soy sauce or teriyaki sauce.  I added smoked paprika and used olive oil instead of canola oil.  It was still amazing.  I would add more stars if I could.

I deleted the sesame seeds because i didn't have any in the house. I used thigh & breast pieces and cooked on an indoor grill and they were very good after 4.5 hours marinating in the fridge. Watch your temperature because they will burn quickly due to sugars in marinade. I might try this on salmon.

My husband and I are not big on chicken thighs so I used wings and breast halves. The marinated has such great flavor and makes the chicken remain juicy. I also used dark karo syrup instead of molasses because I didn't have it on hand. I will be using this marinade from now on.

This is a very good marinade that I will for sure make again.  I made it as written and would give it five star stars but I thought it lacked a little something - a pinch of cayenne, a little fresh ginger??  Well worth the effort, thanks!!

Perfect! This has been a no-fail hit with us. I throw it all in a ziplock bag and marinate over night thru dinner time then grill. Perfect for meaty drum sticks too.

I did not have teriyaki sauce so I used the honey garlic sauce on hand.  I have not made it with the teriyaki yet, but will next time.  Everyone (about 12 people) loved it and there was only one tiny piece of chicken left.  This will be one of my regulars.

This chicken was flippin' amazing. I will definitely make it again.  I don't buy low sodium soy sauce, so I will need to add a garlic clove and omit the garlic salt next time because it was slightly too salty. I also didn't have garlic pepper, so I just used pepper. So good! I will be trying this marinade with pork as well. :-)

Yum! The only changes I made was garlic powder for the garlic salt and regular pepper for the garlic pepper. Loved the caramelization from the molasses and brown sugar. Both hubby and his best friend took seconds, thirds and even fourths!

This is very tasty!  The only change I made was to substitute garlic powder for the minced garlic. Will definitely make this again.

Fantastic!  I didn't use the garlic salt or pepper, didn't feel that this needed any more salt.  Also, great for pork chops or tenderloin.  This is my go-to marinade for sure!

This was a pretty good recipe and fairly easy to throw together.  Looking at the seasonings I think it would be easier to take a little garlic powder and add it then put in salt and pepper rather than garlic salt and garlic pepper.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I left it out, but it turned out good just the same.  And we baked it in the oven.

Made exactly as posted and it came out amazing! Not dry, and very tender. Cooks easy and well on the grill, and the leftovers were still tasty and tender too. We normally use white meat but decided to use the dark meat thighs as in this recipe and were very happy! I did have to marinate 24 hrs due to a schedule conflict, but that probably only made them better! I am going to make batches and freeze the marinade in ziplocs for easier and faster prep next time. I Recommend this recipe for sure! Delish!!

Made this last night and the family loved it.  Was very easy too.  I used a whole chicken cut up because some of my family likes white meat. All cuts with bones in, because that's where the flavor is.  The only thing I changed was I upped the amount of marinate by 1.5 because I used the whole chicken, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Tasty!

The best chicken marinade ever!  My family goes crazy every time I fix this.  I use boneless skinless breast instead of the suggested chicken.

We really liked this. We usually make a more Hawaiian inspired grilled chicken, but this was just the thing for a change. I especially liked the paprika flavor in this. I used half smoked paprika, and think I will do ALL smoked paprika next time. SO yummy. We also used at least double the brown sugar. I added cornstarch and water to the marinade and boiled it for a long time to make a nice sauce. Serves beautifully over rice. Enjoy!

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as directed (except I doubled it because it didn't look like enough for my 8 chicken thighs) and left it for 4 hrs to marinate and it came out perfectly!  Will definently be making this again....probably with chicken breasts next time!

Great recipe. Served at a BBQ and was asked for the recipe. Used bone-in and skin-on chicken thighs, cooked over indirect heat, turning often. Moist and delicious! Didn't use liquid smoke only because I don't have it but will try with it next time. Thanks!

This recipe is a keeper, even my Brother who is a grilled chicken king was impressed, the liquid smoke made the flavor unique and not too sweet, the combo of the flavors was excellent, I used bone in thighs, marinated them for about 24 hours, didn't have garlic pepper (couldn't find it) so added about a 1/4 teas of black pepper.. very tender, the browning on the skin was beautiful.. family dinner, even my Mother was impressed.. and that's a good thing... lol

This is by far the best chicken marinade I ever made. Works good on all chicken and not just thighs. I had chicken breast cut thin. It took about 3 min on both sides.  Very tender and very good.

I used boneless chicken breast instead of chicken thoughts but I followed the rest of the recipe to the T and the taste came out great. The only thing I was dissatisfied with was the dryness of on the outside of the chicken. I thought it would've came out looking wet like the picture on the recipe. Next time I'll probably make another side batch and coat the chicken as It's cooking (like ribs). All-in-all great recipe and I'll be making it again

The title for this recipe perfectly describes how this dish turned out!  Even my pickiest eater loved it!  I did not have molasses so I used honey instead.  I didn't have garlic pepper so I simply used black pepper.  I added  a tsp. of onion powder as I use this for almost all of my marinades and dry rubs.  I also added two tbsp. of the juice from my canned pineapples that I grilled along with this and one tsp of grated ginger.  I believe that the liquid smoke is probably the secret ingredient in this recipe and I would strongly suggest not omitting it!!  I only had chicken breasts so I cubed and skewered them, grilling them for a total of 24 minutes.   I was only able to marinate the chicken for about 2 1/2 hours but the chicken still turned out tasty and juicy.  This is one of the best recipes I have found for chicken and will try this again with other meats.

It was good, but lacked the spiciness we've found in other Asian chicken recipes.  Maybe 3.5 stars if I could give it.

Excellent!! Made a few revisions just based on what I had on hand...skipped the garlic salt & garlic pepper and added a bit extra minced garlic instead. Also subbed the sesame seeds for sesame oil (1 t). Highly recommend. Has a great Asian taste to it. Pairs well with some stir fry noodles & veggies. Big hit with my entire family- a rarity in and of itself!!

I thought these were great! I docked a star only because my husband and boys  wouldn't eat it... for reasons unbeknownst to me! Only change I made was to swap honey for molasses since I didn't have any; and I baked them. This makes a lot of sauce which is handy in retaining moistness when reheating.

It is a very tasty recipe, and the color of the chicken looks fantastic... Next time, I will add some hot pepper flakes/sriracha/cayenne pepper, because as much as I enjoyed the chicken, it was clearly missing a heat element.

I made this chicken the other night on the grill. It was really good. I had everything listed except  the teriyaki sauce so I subbed hoisen sauce for  it  and it still came out  great. I served it  with grilled potatoes  and a tossed salad. My hubby loved it too. I think next time i will double the marinade and use it for a sauce to put over rice.

By looking at the recipe, I felt this was going to be too salty.  My husband is trying to watch his salt intake.  So, I left out the soy sauce and added extra teriyaki.  I also substituted garlic powder for garlic salt, and ground pepper for the garlic pepper.  My teriyaki already has sesame seeds in it, so I didn't add any extra.  I really enjoyed this.  I never thought of using molasses to a marinade. YUM!  I'm making it again!

We all know how good this marinade is so this comment is mainly for me and others who use a Traeger. I cut the oil by 2/3 of the recipe. Traeger at 450', chicken on 8-10 min (flipping halfway through). While the chicken is on, bring the remaining marinade to a boil then simmer for 5 min. Once chicken is done, bathe it in the marinade once more before putting it back on the grill for a final 5 min. SO FREGGIN MOIST AND DELICIOUS.

I added some Sriracha to give a bit of kick.I did not have the garlic salt or pepper so I used salt and pepper and added garlic powder.    I also marinated 24 hours and used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  absolutely amazing!!  going to make this again!

I was out of sesame seeds and teriyaki sauce. I added 2 extra tablespoons of soy sauce to make up for the teriyaki. I figured there was sugar in there anyway and teriyaki is basically soy sauce with sugar. I also don't buy garlic salt but I had the powder so I used that.   I will definitely get some sesame seeds for next time. This recipe was really good. I let it marinade for about 4 hours.

GReat flavor! I cooked this on a pellet grill, and it came out amazing. This is a great marinade, basically a smoky, homemade Soy vay. Even my 12-year old devoured it.

YUMMY. We loved it. Have cut up chicken and put on skewers and just slicing the breast in half to thin it.  I always adjust ingredients to our taste.  Anyone who complains it's to salty or sweet should adjust/change to what is right to make it work for you.  Simple as that!

Made it without the liquid smoke and it was incredible. On the grill is the best. A great alternative marinade for people who don't like ketchup-based marinades because they are too sweet. A permanent staple in our house.

If I could give this marinade more than 5 stars, I would!  Delicious!!  I ended up doing breasts, thighs and legs - and every piece turned out moist and fabulous!  what a wonderful flavor!  Made for Memorial Day BBQ, along with skirt steak - and everyone said the chicken was the star of the show!  would definitely make again - and again.  Wonderful!

This is fantastic!  I did everything as written except used black pepper instead of garlic pepper.  I will make this often.  My husband and I both loved it.  And I've also used it on pork tips, and they were they came out so tender and juicy that I will never have pork tips any other way.  Delish!

I tried this recipe this week.  I baked the chicken instead of grilling.  Both my husband and I thought the flavor was great.  I will grill the chicken the next time I make them.  My only suggestion is to make sure you use a good quality liquid smoke.  Once I had bought a bargain brand...NO BARGAIN!  The smell wasn't good, and the flavor was worse.  Ruined the dish I was making at the time.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I did not have low sodium soy sauce, so used regular soy sauce, but substituted regular garlic powder for the garlic salt.  Also, instead of teriyaki sauce, I substituted an equal amount of hoisin sauce (Chinese barbecue sauce), which can be found in some grocery stores in the Asian section.  Next time I make it, I might experiment with adding some cilantro and a little lime.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have EVER tried. Chicken is my favorite meat and I keep this in the fridge most of the time. This is delicious hot as well as cold, as dinner or lunch, great in salads.

Holy cow, my family could not stop raving about this.   Grilled chicken is normally not one of their favorites, but they have requested I definitely make this again.  I made almost as directed, except didn't have garlic salt or garlic pepper, so followed another reviewer and used 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/4 t salt and 1/4 t pepper.  Also I used chicken breasts this time, but can't wait to try it with the thighs!

This  was awesome! I normally don't use liquid smoke but generally make the recipe as written the first time anyway. Glad that I did! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs that were marinated for probably 8 hours or so. I put it together in the morning before work and grilled for dinner. My husband said that it tasted like excellent restaurant quality and that this one is a keeper for sure! Both of us absolutely loved this meal. The only change I made was to use olive oil instead of canola. We will be having this  many times over the summer and I may try the marinade with pork chops too.

we made this for bf's dinner.. i marinated the chicken (8 hours) and he cooked it on the george foreman.. i cut the recipe in half and used it on an extra large chicken breast that weighed 1 lb 6 oz.. i'm thinking maybe i shouldn't have cut the recipe in half bc i was hoping it would come out more flavorful.. i did have to make some modifications so maybe that's why.. i used regular soy sauce and halved the amount.. totally forgot the liquid smoke (doh!).. subbed maple syrup for the molasses.. subbed sesame oil for the seeds and used one third the amount.. instead of minced garlic and garlic pepper i used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/8 tsp black pepper.. i think the flavor was spot on.. i was just hoping for it to be more pungent.. either way bf approves.. ty for the recipe

I left out the smoke since I am not a fan. Seemed a bit oily. Rather bland, I expected it to be very flavorful but wasn't. I might try again and add more brown sugar.

This is a great flavor for chicken!  I think I'll get some molasses, rather than sub honey, and make sure to use skin on boneless thighs, next time!! It was wonderful but I found myself wanting more of that deeper flavor.

This chicken was amazing! My husband couldn't stop raving about it and he's a very good cook. I did not have molasses, so I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar and a tsp of honey as another reviewer did. I also didn't have sesame seeds, so added a tsp of sesame oil, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and regular pepper. The rest of the recipe was followed as is. I marinated for about 6 hours. The meat was so tender and flavorful. This will definitely become a regular on our dinner table! Thank you!

This marinade is LEGIT! I made it with hoisin instead of teriyaki, and it came out excellent. Marinated overnight, heated up the grill nice and hot, and they came out great. Highly recommend!

It was good, but I used thighs with skin on them, and the flavor went away with the skin. I think it definitely would have been better if the thighs were skinless.

I completely messed up this recipe and it still turned out delicious!  I didn't marinate it--just brushed the sauce over bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (which was still partly frozen) and baked it at 350 for about an hour.  Next time I will plan better and follow the recipe by using boneless, skinless thighs and marinating and grilling them.  I used full-sodium soy sauce so I didn't add salt.  Didn't use teriyaki sauce either.

My husband and I are paleo so used organic coconut palm sugar instead of brown sugar.  No soy sauce but coconut aminos.  No liquid smoke because we smoked them on the smoker..  Absolutely delish.  Keeper recipe....

We use the marinade on our chicken kabobs and it is delicious! I add a touch of flour to thicken the marinade into a glaze and apply it directly to the kabobs on the grill.

These were the best grilled thighs I have ever had.  The marinade was perfect.  The only thing I did differently was that I grilled them inside on my George Foreman grill.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very pleased with this marinade!  Like the creator, I've been on a quest for a great marinade for chicken for some time on this site and while I've found many good ones, this one was amazing.  I did not consciously make any changes to this recipe, but I didn't have garlic salt, so I doubled up on the garlic.  The use of molasses is a great idea, as I think it keeps the marinade stuck on the chicken which is always a problem with runny marinades.   Can't wait to make this again.

So good! Whole family loved it.  Very, very flavorful.  I marinated boneless, skinless chicken thighs for about 8 hours then my husband threw them on the grill for 10 min per side.  Don't get mad but I did not have the liquid smoke or molasses.  It was still amazing!

I followed the recipe pretty closely but I left out liquid smoke, because if allergies.  I also thought I had thawed out chicken thighs and I had actually thawed out chicken breast.  Because it is so hot here I baked in the oven I made extra so I used it to bake with the chicken in the oven.  I let it marinate all day.  This came out prefect!  They were moist, flavorful and my husband couldn't eat enough of them.  I will use this recipe again!  Thank you!

This marinade resulted in the best grilled boneless skinless chicken breasts I have ever had.  The only substitution, other than the breast for thigh, was pepper and garlic powder instead of garlic pepper.  I have made the recipe twice and also marinated chunks of chicken breast that I grilled on skewers with pineapple and bell pepper chunks.  I doubled the marinade recipe so I'd have extra to marinate the bell pepper and have some marinade I could use for sauce on the cooked kabobs.  The next time I'm  adding tomatoes and mushrooms.  Thanks for the great marinade.

Made for dinner and followed directions exactly. I did use boneless chicken breasts, because I do not care for thighs.  I made the marinade in the morning and it came together quickly and easily once all the ingredients were assembled. It marinated all day while I was at work, and we threw it on the grill when I got home. Served with couscous and steamed green beans.  My family had been complaining about chicken again, but once they tasted this, everyone was happy, even the picky 7 year old. This will be a regular rotation at our home.

This was just okay in my books. Hubby liked it well enough but I really didn't care for the liquid smoke flavor at all.  And I'm not really sure I even like grilled chicken thigh meat.  May try it again without the liquid smoke. Update: Tried this marinade as written again with chicken legs w/backs attached and it was way better than the first time using thighs.  Might have even been better the next day served for lunch cold. So upgrading my rating of this, just making a note that the type of chicken does make a difference for us.

Wonderfully moist and flavorful. This was our inititial use of this recipe, so I tended to follow it closely, but I reduced the oil and increased the garlic, as usual. I saw that there was no provision for basting on the grill, so I doubled the marinade amount and reserved half for basting. I love molasses and brown sugar, so will increase those next time. Outstanding recipe, and easy to execute. I marinated for the full four hours and would recommend that.

I made this for Father's Day using chicken breasts. It was a hit, even though I only had 4 hours to marinate it. Will try longer next time.

I wanted to like this recipe, but I found the chicken rather blah, and I followed it exactly.  Maybe if I had been able to marinate overnight it would have had more flavor.

I'm usually reluctant when I see an arm-load of ingredients listed in a recipe. More often than not, they are not necessary. However, I "went by the book" with the exception of adding a splash (1.5 Tablespoons) of water because I did not have low sodium soy.
Good! Dang Good!
thanx Wilemon!

This is REALLY delectable! I make my own marinades all the time but this is SOOOO good! I did not use smoke. Made really juicy chicken breast! I will be making this again and it will be good on pork too! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious. I am notorious for overcooking my meat, and this recipe turned out perfectly moist and tender. We eat chicken easily 4 or 5 times a week, and it has never been so good. This was the first time in 8 years where I served chicken and my partner did not add any additional sauce to it. Perfect marinade!

Loved it.  Followed the recipe exactly as described.  I used low sodium soy sauce so it probably needed a bit more salt but other than that it's a keeper.  So easy to make and I made double so I could freeze another portion to be used later.

They can marinate longer, if needed, up to 7-8 hours. Easy, fun, cook up fast on the grill.

I marinated the chicken 24 hours because the dinner arrangement had changed and I had already prepared the chicken.  I thought the chicken came out kind of rubbery.

Delish! I just had to let you know the smile you gave me...in your description where you say "I have experimented with so many marinades for chicken using my neighbors as guinea pigs..." all I could think of was putting this marinade on your neighbors...LOL! Thanks for the great smile and an awesome recipe! :)

Very disappointed in this recipe.  The picture makes it look delicious but my chicken did not turn out at all like this. Completely lacked flavor.  Will not make again.

I followed this exactly with the exception hat I threw in wo extra Thighs, but I had a major issue when I turned the meet never had this happen, but the grill fired up and pretty much burnt the outside of most of the thighs.  I was so bummed.  This rating is based on taste though.  I thought it was good, worth trying, but not the best I've ever had.  But all three kids ate it so that deserves 5 stars

This chicken was great! Even my picky husband said it was "superb!" The only changes I made were to substitute honey for molasses and extra virgin olive oil for canola oil because this is what I had, but it was still wonderful and juicy!

I Loved it, Husband give or take it...and I'm the very picky eater... The only thing I did not add sesame seeds did not have any & could not find a small bag or jar only huge jar and didn't want to buy it. Also Paprika, was replace by Cayenne Pepper in error. Thought I had paprika didn't look at label just saw the red and put it in. Alough it was still good just added a little spicy kick to it. Will be a go to marinaid....  I baked in oven with my pampered chef round pizza dish. I used bone in ck breast. Cooked on low 300 only because had to wait for hubby being late for almost 2 hrs... Next time will do abt 350 for abt 50 mins or grill it.

I wasn't expecting much but needed a quick marinade. This was fabulous!  I skipped the sesame seeds and instead used about 1 tsp. toasted sesame oil (I was afraid the seeds would burn on the grill), used 1 hefty tsp. garlic powder and ommitted minced garlic & garlic pepper.  I added only about 2 Tbs. of canola oil and cubed the chicken for kebabs then marinated for about 4 hours.  It absorbed the marinade and wasn't too smoky (I'm not a huge liquid smoke fan but used the full tsp. per other reviewers).  I'll absolutely make this again.  Next time I'll boil the extra marinade for 3 minutes and serve alongside.

This was a great marinade. I used chicken breasts and cut them into tender size pieces. I then grilled them, along with some hamburgers, hot dogs, and brats. Guess what? The chicken was all gone, but there were still burgers, dogs, and brats left over. My wife doesn't like grilled chicken breasts. She says they are too big and there's not enough flavor. Well, she devoured this chicken. One of my nephews even commented on how good the chicken tastes. This definitely is being used again at my next BBQ. Thanks for the recipe.

Feedback from my spouse was "the best chicken  you have ever done!!".  Used 4lbs of chicken breasts cut into 4 oz pieces and marinaded for 24 hours and cooked on the grilled.  Used triple garlic teriyaki sauce.  Awesome!

I marinated overnight using chicken breast. I used all ingredients except liquid smoke which I did not have. I found it to be too sweet. I will try it again using half the molasses.
