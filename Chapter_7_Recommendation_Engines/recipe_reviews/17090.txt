unfortunately i found this to be over powered by the taste of the pre-made bbq sauce base, i tried it again with a mix of ketchup and tomato paste and it was wonderful!

The ingredient list calls for MSG however the instructions call for meat tenderizer so there appears to be a typo here. With that being said, I left that step out altogether. This was okay but I feel it would have benefited if cooked on the stove awhile. The red wine really needed some time to cook down in my opinion.
