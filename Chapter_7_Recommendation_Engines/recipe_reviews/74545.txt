These were really good but I had to modify the recipe.  Halfway through I realized there was a lot of liquid so I eliminated the oil and the fish sauce.  At this point I added 1/4 cup of plain breadcrumbs and the consistency was perfect.  Then I realized I forgot to add the egg white so I added only 1/2 of an egg white and it was way too wet.  It took another 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs to thicken it back to normal.  I cooked it on a parchment lined cookie sheet on 350 for 30-35 minutes (can't remember exactly how long I set the timer for but you can tell when you smell them that they are done.)  I made them in walnut sized balls and got 23 balls out of 1 package of ground chicken.  I like the flavor and will make again.  I also liked adding the breadcrumbs too and it didn't detract from the flavor.  My husband dipped his in sweet chili sauce and I added mine to a soba (buckwheat) noodle bowl.

I agree with other reviewers - this is way too wet.  I have no idea how you'd put it on skewers.  An ingredient was left out for binding (oatmeal, bread crumbs, etc) or the directions are incorrect (heat to make the corn starch thicken?).  On a 1 lb recipe, I had to add 1/2 cup of quick oats and 1/4 cup of panko bread crumbs to even come close to making a meatball.  I served them with peanut sauce (a combo of recipes from here).  They were really good - after the additions.

Good recipe, I added a couple extras: chopped green onion and bread crumbs, as it was very wet. I cooked the meatballs on cookie sheets and omitted the skewers. Served on rice, add peanut sauce or other sauces to dip!

These are just fantastic - great as meatballs but even better as filling for dumplings!  Throw one piece of bread in the mixture if you are making meatballs.  So so so great.  Will make these again and again!

Too wet for skewers, but I baked at 350 fot 30-40 minutes. Added onions, more fish sauce, and msg, and used rice vineagar instead of rice wine.  Next time, I will cover them for most of the cooking time to prevent the outside from drying up.

These are really good with some modifications.  I too think they're too wet, so I just added some cracker crumbs.  I didn't have fish sauce so I used oyster sauce, and it was great!  I make these often.

I love these meatballs! Ive made them a few times and serve them with a noodle and veggie stir fry. Easy, different and healthy.

No fish sauce, but that didn't hurt.  Made them walnut sized and nuked them, then dipped in hot sauce.  Also heated leftovers in chicken broth along with assorted veggies to make a complete meal.  Versatile with subtle flavor.

Way too wet. Added bread crumbs and it just tasted like rubber.

Yup, way too wet (I even omitted the Worcestershire sauce, and halved the rice wine). The flavor was lacking, and I didn't like the texture. Not a hit in our house. Sorry.

This recipe is terrible. Way too wet. I had to add breadcrumbs and the taste was nothing I would ever want to eat again.

I halved the recipe.  From other suggestions, I added some bread crumbs and skipped the fish sauce and oil.  Had to bake in the oven as I was not able to get them to stick to the skewers.  Served them over Jasmine Rice.   No one really cared for them, but ate the rice. I wish I had some suggestion for making this better. Thanks for posting.

Great recipe! Yes, there are a lot of liquids that make it hard to form balls and put on a skewer. I mixed the ground chicken with a pound of italian sausage, omitted the egg and stuck with the rest of the ingredients which gave it great flavor. I also added some bread crumbs so they could form better and just fried them in a pan. Will definitely make again! :)

I just made these for a baby shower. I made three times the recipe. Yes way way too wet! I added bread crumbs and then rice to give Asian flavor and to help them stay together. I added half cup of rice and about 4 tbsp water. I broiled them for 8 min on high then simmered them in chicken broth so the rice could finish cooking. Pretty good.  Ill great them in a crackpot tomorrow and serve them teriyaki sauce and sweet and sour sauce. I hope they're a hit!

As other reviewers have noted, the mixture is very wet and would be completely impossible to form into balls.  I suspect that some ingredient is missing but went with what was here.

Since I'd read the reviews in advance, I decided to handle  by poaching the mixture in miso ginger soup broth (Trader Joe's sells this in a box).  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and scooped tablespoons of the mixture into boiling broth to poach.  Yes, you basically need a spoon for this mixture. It is sticky and hard to work with, but I made my best attempt to keep the mixture ball-shaped as it dropped in and began to cook.  

The final result was not very appealing and surprisingly flavorless considering how many ingredients go into seasoning the ground chicken.  I had whitish, rubbery globs of meat in my soup that didn't taste like much of anything on their own, but are edible  in the tasty broth.  I won't be attempting this recipe again.

I followed the recipe without modification. The meatballs were very good and just as I remembered them. I first had them at a Vietnamese restaurant and was looking to duplicate them. The only negative comments I got were about texture. However, the texture was correct for the dish. I chalk it up to only being familiar with Italian or Swedish meatballs. Best eaten with a Vietnamese fish sauce based dipping sauce.
