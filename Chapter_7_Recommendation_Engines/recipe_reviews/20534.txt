This recipe was an excellent base for embellishment.  Without embellishment, it fear it would not have been soup but rather a bland sloppy mess of zucchini, meat and onion. I made sure to add the liquid from the can of tomatoes, fresh chopped garlic, and mushrooms.  Most importantly, I added additional herbs and spices. 1 teaspoon each dried tyme and parsley (fresh is better but double the amount), 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper to taste, one can of beef broth and about 1/4 cup of water (broth and water actually made it a soup). Last but not least, I added a half teaspoon of cumin.  This really made the soup sing and gave it a backgroud flavor that wasn't over-powering.

This isn't soup. I added broth and additional seasonings, but it was still just okay.
