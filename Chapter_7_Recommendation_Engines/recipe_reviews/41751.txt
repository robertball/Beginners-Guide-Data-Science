It was OK... not the best thing ever, but my boyfriend and sister seemed to like it all right.  Not too exciting... but it wasn't gross, either.

I'm tempted to give this a 3 - but don't want to kill this recipe off because it has great potential. As written, it's got way too much lemon for the other ingredients (in my opinion - try it as written and add to it if you have the same opinion). I added another tsp of sugar and a little more soy and we really enjoyed it. Interesting flavor and texture combination. I cut my apple and tomatoes into bite-size pieces for easier eating. We all ended up really liking it (except for the tomato-hater among us). Thanks for the recipe!

Too much liquid, but interesting flavor combination.

Rating is based on how I made it, not on how it was written. I used 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 medium lemon, several drops of bottled hot sauce until it had a kick I was happy with (no chilies on hand), and 1/2 cup peanuts. Both hubby and I were unsure of what we thought when we first tried it, bu the more we ate, the more we liked it. I think 1/2 cup nuts gave it good crunch and flavor and more would have been too much.

I read the reviews, and the first thing I did was cut the acid in half; didn't have a lemon, so I used half a lime. I don't think this needs any salt at all considering that one of the ingredients is soy sauce which is loaded with sodium.  Although I added it this time, I won't in the future....too salty!  One cup of chopped peanuts is waaaaaay too much IMO (and that has to be where most of the calories are coming from) so just chop a few and use as a garnish.  I used multi-colored small sliced tomatoes, a jalapeño, and chili-lime cashews instead of peanuts.  Quick little side salad with an interesting combo of flavors.  The apple partners well with the spiciness of the jalapeños.   It's good, and I will make again, just needs a little tweaking.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it is a good basic recipe, but I did modify it quite a bit.
For the dressing, I omitted the salt and upped the soy sauce to two  tablespoons. I also upped the sugar to one tablespoon, and I added two tablespoons of EVOO and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I used 1/2 lemon instead of a whole one, which was plenty.
In addition, I added in about one cup of slivered snow peas, and 1 1/2 cups of canned chickpeas. I used a full cup of peanuts on the top.
The tomatoes I used were very ripe and juicy, which made the dressing just wonderful; the longer the salad sat (about 15 minutes before serving) the more the flavor of the tomatoes leached into the dressing. It was perfect!
I also served this over greens. With the addition of the snow peas and chickpeas this was a light but filling main dish salad. Thanks for the inspiring recipe!
