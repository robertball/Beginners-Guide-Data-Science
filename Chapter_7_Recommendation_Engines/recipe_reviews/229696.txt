Loved the flavor combination of this bread. The one change I made was to use fresh cranberries instead of the dried.  The bread was nice and moist and bursting with flavor.  Will definitely make this one again.  I bake in 5 mini (6" x 3 1/2") mini pans for 34 minutes.

This recipe is a winner!  I love cranberries so thought this was an interesting combo of ingredients.  I did use fresh cranberries so that it would be less sweet.  This did cause about 10 minutes of additional cooking time.   Everybody loved this recipe.  Can't wait to make again.

Anyone who has a garden with zucchini in it understands the need/desire to find new recipes to try! This bread is excellent! Surprisingly, it is not overly sweet (I was slightly concerned about that with 2 cups of sugar), the orange zest lends a nice flavor. The only thing that I did differently was to add a butter/flour/brown sugar topping that was left over from another recipe! The family loved it & I will definitely be making this bread again. I'll probably experiment with different dried fruit and a different topping! May even juice the orange used for zest, poke holes in the bread once it's baked and cooled and poor the juiced orange over it! It seems pretty versatile and I was very surprised that there weren't more reviews! This would be a great choice around the holidays also!

I made this recipe twice.  Once with dried cranberries which was very good.  The second time I used fresh cranberries and it was even better!  Very flavorful.  I will definitely save this recipe to make again.  I made small loaves and cooked for 35 minutes.

I followed recipe exactly. It was moist and full of flavor, lite and not heavy, it made 4 mini loaves in my pampered chef pan. I will definitely make it again.

This is a keeper! I added fresh cranberries instead of dried and bread turned out delicious. Followed it exactly other than that change. Everyone loved it. It's very moist with just the right spices. Making it for Christmas. It will be gone in
Minutes.

This is a great recipe.  I discovered frozen cranberries after not being able to find fresh most of the year; they worked well.  Rather than measuring different spices, I added the equivalent amount of pumpkin pie spice. Also a little vanilla.

This was my first try at making zucchini bread, it literally tastes like you're eating fall. My 15 year old son took some to school and apparently now all his friends like it too!!! Instead of 2 larger pans I used one larger one (per the recipe) and 2 smaller loaf pans to give as little yummy gifts.

Lovely twist of lemon! Wonderful seasonal recipe! Cloves were a bit too strong for us so cut back to 1/4 tsp. Otherwise, perfect!
