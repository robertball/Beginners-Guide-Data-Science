Hubs made these tonight - I'm merely the critic!  These were knock-out delicious, but I have to think his putting his own spin on them had a lot to do with that.  First,  he used beautiful, large, meaty shrimp - 13-15 count.  These big guys required more than just a third of a slice of bacon, so Hubs didn't cut the bacon until after he partially cooked it in the microwave and saw how long he needed the pieces to be.  As for the spices, he cut waaaaaaay back on the pepper and that was definitely to our liking.  Finally, he didn't want the muss and fuss of frying them, so he opted to broil them instead.  When we make these again, however, we'll make it easy on ourselves and just use a good Cajun seasoning rather than mix all the herbs and spices individually. This would be a fine and proud addition to your holiday appetizer table.

I made it using the amounts in the recipe, and it was WAY too spicy.  They were still pretty good though, and I will definitely try them again using much less pepper.

WOOOOO HOOOOO, these where so over powering with spices you lost the flavor of the shirmp. There alot of work. I think I'll try again some other time and not coat them as much. I used a quarter of the white pepper and cayenne that the recipe called for and still they were very spicy

The spiciness was good. Very flavorful dish.  Only thing I would do is cook the bacon more before wrapping the shrimp.  I would cook it in the micro and after wrapping the shrimp finish cooking in the broiler instead of in a fry pan.

We used much much less cayenne and white pepper. And medium shrimp since that's what I had in the freezer. It was soooo good!!!! We will definitely be making this again. Sooo very tasty.

Made this for company, and it was a hit. It was spicy, but we like it that way. Bacon pieces were too small to wrap around large shrimp, I would leave them bigger next time.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe and make it often (too spicy for the kids).  We leave out the cayenne pepper when preparing this.  Have made this for friends and family and they go crazy for it!  It takes a while to make because of the bacon and peeling the shrimp, but it is a great recipe!

These are always a huge hit at my annual holiday party.  Everyone asks if I am making them every year.  Yes if you follow the recipe they are extremly spicy...I cut it the spices in third and have had great success.

They are A LOT of work...but well worth the trouble.

I made these exactly as the recipe directed, except I had smaller shrimp on hand, so I wrapped two in each piece of bacon.  Mine weren't as pretty as those in the picture:  They were very dark, so if I were serving them at a party, I'd want to figure out something to make them look a little more appealing.  I mixed the spices in a ziplok bag and coated them in the bag and doing it that way may have increased the amount of coating on them, making them darker.

These are REALLY spicy!!!  The flavor's really good, but the level of heat made it a little hard to eat them.  I will cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.

I drained the bacon fat out of the skillet before I fried the shrimp in it and I think I'd leave at least some of it in the pan next time to help brown them more evenly & keep them from being too dry.

In summary, I really liked the overall flavor of these & think they will be perfect with just a little less "heat."

I did change some things from the original recipe. I bought two pounds of shrimp and realized it would have taken me forever to wrap each one. What I did instead was to chop up the bacon and cook it then through in the seasoned shrimp until it was cooked. It was okay but it definitely was way too much seasoning even for 2 pounds of shrimp.

It was the hit for the family! I went exactly by recipe and it was very good. Jalapeno I put in was not hot,but sweet. It's a hit or miss with those at store. No need to spend that money at restaurants when you can do it at home!
