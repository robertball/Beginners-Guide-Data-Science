This was very rich and delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts. Next time, I may try using coolwhip in place of the whipped cream in order to lighten it up a bit. That way I can eat more.... Try this one...

Oh my goodness, this is SO good!  We are on a low carb diet and had some friends over for dinner.  I served this and everyone raved, without even knowing that we were on any type of diet.  It's a perfect blend of fruity, creamy, and sweet....but not too sweet.  I'm going to make another batch now.

A great cranberry dish.  Something light, cool and refrishing to go with the heavy turkey, dressing and gravy. 
Can be prepared in advance.  Also a
plus!

These turned out great! I made them in paper cupcake cups. So convienent to serve. I also lowered the fat by using low fat cream cheese and low fat cool whip, omiting the butter. I garnished each "cupcake" with chopped dried cranberry-raisins and a pecan chip. (used pecans instead of walnuts.YUMMO!

This was like an ice cream dessert. I thought it was really good. Easy to make. Great for when you need a last minute dish and no time to make a fancy dish. I fixed this just before bedtime and when it was time for work in the morning, it was ready to go. I used a disposable aluminum bread loaf sized pan and it worked out fine. I'd definitely fix this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

UPDATE: 11/25/11 I made this again and this time I lined the metal pan with plastic wrap so it would be easy to remove and easier clean up. It worked perfectly! This took 4.5 hours to freeze solid in my freezer. My husband liked this quite a bit and there won't be any going to waste. It is a very rich and creamy dish. This is sweet but it's tart too with the cranberries. A wonderful ending to a great meal! Thanks again.

This salad was fine, but it wasn't memorable.  I made it for Thanksgiving and there was a lot left over (probably due in part to the need to keep it frozen, so we couldn't leave it out on the table).  I would have preferred a stronger cranberry flavor.  It was too mild and creamy for me.

I have made this salad for Thanksgiving for years, and I love it.  I double the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 glass pan and then cut it into squares to serve.  We like it best after it has thawed for a half hour or 45 minutes.  Actually, I love to eat it after the whole dinner is done, and it has completely thawed!  You can't please everyone with every recipe, but I promise you that you will please mostly everyone with this salad.  And you can't beat a good do-ahead salad for Thanksgiving!

This got great reviews at a potluck barbecue from everyone.  I substituted about 1-1/2 cups cool whip to make it lighter, and easier.  Very yummy!

Wow, this was sooo good! I made it as a fluff, did not freeze and I used the vanilla flavored cool whip to save some steps and ingredients. I made this for Thanksgiving this year but really this will be good all year, I cannot wait to try it with cherries.

I ommitted the walnuts because I'm not a fan..overall, very tasty.  I think next time though I would serve it as a "fluff" as suggested by others.

I omit the butter, and instead of crushed pineapple, use chunks and add 2 small cans of mandarin oranges.   We freeze half in a loaf pan and serve half as fluff.

I thought it was great! Used my own homemade cranberry sauce, and saved some of the whipped cream to spread over the top of the mixture once it was in the pan. But I do have to say, the kids did NOT like it quite as much as the adults.

This might very well replace my love for Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  Even my husband, who isn't a huge lover of sweets, gave this the two-thumbs up.  

Delicious as is.

It was OK - I'm just not much of a cranberry person - just made something quick to stick with the tradition - the family liked it though - especially the grandkids - I think they thought it was like ice cream!! Thanks

I've made this recipe a handful of times for different occasions, and absolutely love it.  My only substitution is that I sometimes use pecans instead of walnuts, but that is only personal preference;  the recipe is delicious just as written.  The last time I served it for a big Thanksgiving dinner,  one guest pronounced it "like fruity, nutty ice cream," and a couple of people skipped pie for an extra serving of this (I was greedy and had both LOL!).   It's also wonderful as a side dish for a light, warm-weather luncheon or brunch (mini croissant sandwiches + a leafy green salad + a mini mold of this creamy, fruity concoction = a BIG hit with guests!)

I used this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving. I changed it up a bit. I did not use the butter and I substituted 1/3 cup finely chopped pecans for the walnuts. It was wonderful!! I also used a lowfat cream cheese to help the calorie count just a bit. I will make it again and again.

My grandmother used to make this at Christmas and I never had the recipe so I was very happy to find it here.  We put this into muffin cups so that we had little individual servings.  Worked great!

After adjustments were made this recipe is very refreshing and healthy.  6oz cream cheese softened & whipped, 4 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1-16oz whole cranberry sauce, 1pound 4oz can crushed pineapple drained, 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Mix well.  Fold in 2 cups cool whip.  Blend well and fill 8x8 pan or dish.  Freeze, slice, & serve.

I used pecans instead of walnuts. Made this for family cookout and everyone loved it.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you.
