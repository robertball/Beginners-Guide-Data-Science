Five stars for vegans and those who don't have the standard eggs, milk or butter on hand, three or four stars for everyone else. I enjoyed it and it had a unique, spicy taste, but it's not the best cake I've ever made.

Love this cake!  I started making it for my two vegan sons but it's a favorite around our house, too.  I've tried two different versions but this version (boiling the spices) gives better flavor and nice color, too.

Excellent recipe- it produced a dense, moist loaf that was excellent for breakfast or a light snack. Be sure to sift the dry ingredients just as the recipe says. I also adjusted the spices to suit my taste- 1 1/2 tsps cinnamon, 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cardamom. Yummy! :)

I used coconut oil instead of shortening and, instead of brown sugar, used about 75% Evaporated Cane Juice and 25% a combo of Yacon syrup and agave nectar. Bake time 50 minutes. It turned out divinely. GREAT for dessert, even unfrosted.

I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 to make a double-layer cake in 8" pans and it worked well (see photo!). We found the cake delicious (I used a vegan "buttercream" frosting and raisins for decoration) but it turned out somewhat dry; not sure why. Next time I will do something to add more moisture, maybe a little more shortening or some milled flaxseed.

I wanted something sweet, but was out of the basic baking supplies.  I put this recipe together in 1,2 3 substituting  coconut oil for shortening and adding a few choc chips to the mix.  My sweet tooth was satisfied. This is an excellent healthy, tasty recipe! Thank you for sharing!!

My first "boiled cake", tastes great, good lift in the pan (used 8" round cake pan)
